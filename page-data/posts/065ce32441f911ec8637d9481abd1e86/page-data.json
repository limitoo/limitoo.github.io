This is important because most treatments have focussed on changing the way in which the immune system reacts to the virus,\\\" said Professor James Davies, co-lead of the study.\", \"Dr Raghib Ali of the University of Cambridge, an adviser on COVID-19 and ethnicity to the UK Cabinet Office, said in a statement that even after accounting for higher rates of COVID-19 risk factors such as work in public-facing jobs and housing in densely populated areas, \\\"there has been an unexplained residual excess risk in South Asians\\\".\", \"This new study, he added, shows \\\"that this may be due to them being more likely to carry this gene which increases their risk of death once infected\\\".\", \"The findings were published in the Nature Genetics journal.\", \"Dr. Simon Biddie, an intensive care specialist at the University of Edinburgh, said in a statement that while the study \\\"provides compelling evidence to suggest roles for LZFTL1\\\" in the lungs of patients with severe COVID-19, more research is necessary to confirm the findings.\", \"Reuters\", \"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"065ce32441f911ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"065ce32441f911ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
