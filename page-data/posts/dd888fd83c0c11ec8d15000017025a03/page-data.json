The third year Memphis guard is the current scoring leader and drawing comparisons to Michael Jordan - who will probably take that personally.\", \"Steph Curry is in intimidating form despite a weird slump of scoreless fourth quarters. When he smashed the record for 3 point field goals (FG) made (400) in 2016, he averaged five a game. He's doing it again. Strap in.\", \"Nikola Jokic is somehow just an outside chance for MVP, despite winning it last year. The \\\"Joker\\\" is shooting 60.8 percent FG, and 42.3 percent from range, while keeping Denver third in the West.\", \"Defensive Player of the Year:\", \"Utah's record has been built off a dominant start from Rudy Gobert. The \\\"Stifle Tower\\\" is down on his blocks, but is scoring at a career high, and he leads the league in rebounds.\", \"Boston isn't doing great, but that's not because of Robert Williams III. The Celtics centre, whose nickname is amazing (Timelord) leads the league in blocks.\", \"Sixth man:\", \"Miami's Tyler Herro has made himself the frontrunner, averaging 22 points off the bench.\", \"Carmelo Anthony, 37, is going to be a fan favourite for this award, especially if he keeps scoring 20 plus in wins. The ninth greatest scorer of all time needs 1132 points to pass Laker legend Shaquille O'Neal. That's around 15 points a game. He's averaging 17. Bring it on.\", \"Rookie watch:\", \"No. 4 pick Scottie Barnes has taken advantage of an injury to starter Pascal Siakim, and quickly won over Toronto fans. He's averaging 18 points and nine rebounds a game, and the Raptors are eagerly waiting to pair him with their All Star.\", \"No. 13 pick Chris Duarte might be the steal of the draft. He's filled in for Indiana's injured starters, and is putting up 18 points a night.\", \"No. 3 pick Evan Mobley received the ultimate Cleveland endorsement from none other than Lebron James after the Cavaliers stayed close with the Lakers and Mobley got an alley-oop dunk on the King.\", \"No. 6 pick Josh Giddy and Oklahoma shocked LA (and the league) with a win (admittedly with James sidelined), while he became the youngest player since Lebron to dish 10 assists in a game.\", \"No. 2 Pick Jalen Green has had a streaky start, but exploded for 30 points against Boston and almost pulled off the dunk of the decade against Oklahoma.\", \"Detroits Cade Cunningham has been injured, finally made his NBA debut, scored 2 points, and then rested the next day. He'll be eager to remind everyone why he was the no. 1 pick ASAP.\", \"Current Season Averages: 10.2 points / 57.1% FG / 100% FT / 9.7 rebounds (5.4O/5.2D) / 3.0 ast / 0.8 stl / 0.3 blks\", \"Memphis' \\\"Grizzlie Adams\\\" was a perfect 13/13 from the free-throw line, while averaging a career best 3 assists per game in a solid start to the year. His crunching screens have helped unlock both Morant and shooting guard Desmond Bane as fluid scoring options. A heartbreaking loss to the Lakers showcased what his role in the team can be, as he tallied 14 points, 16 boards, and six dimes.\"]","href_hash":"dd888fd83c0c11ec8d15000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dd888fd83c0c11ec8d15000017025a03"}},
