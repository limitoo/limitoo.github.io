Five crews worked on Sunday to extend that buffer in the remaining area to minimise the risk of any flare up breaking out of the perimeter.\", \"They have also used hand tools and portable pumps to expose and extinguish hotspots identified by thermal imaging, with support from two helicopters.\", \"Tohiariki reiterated calls for people to stay well away from the fireground, where hazards ranged from deep ash pits to smouldering peat beds.\", \"\\\"People may be thinking that it's safe to go there if they don't see flames and plumes of smoke, but this is still an active fire and our crews need to be able to concentrate on their task rather than worrying about people trying to access their maimais.\\\"\", \"There is no public access to Awarua Bay Road past the intersection with Buddle Road, and there are signs at the boat ramps on the Waituna Lagoon advising that the wetland is closed to the public.\", \"Weather permitting, drones will make another aerial assessment of the Awarua fireground tomorrow morning.\"]","href_hash":"902bca1cb89311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"902bca1cb89311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
