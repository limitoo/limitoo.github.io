G. Wodehouse and Fry said he liked the idea of \\\"being like them; dressing like them\\\".\", \"\\\"I liked the idea of looking like my grandfathers' generation.\\\"\", \"There were ties in the collar boxes Fry inherited too, meaning he already had a decent collection by the time he was 15.\", \"He bought additional ties for \\\"very small money\\\" from charity shops and used them to complete his \\\"hopelessly pretentious and absurd\\\" teenage look.\", \"\\\"I'd wear a suit and occasionally tried to walk with a cane ... I even thought about a monocle but eventually decided not to,\\\" he said.\", \"Ties may no longer be the signifiers of social standing they once were, but Fry maintains the subtle messages they send are still there, especially in England.\", \"\\\"I can still instantly see, of course, an MCC tie - the Marylebone Cricket Club ... it's got a 29-year waiting list to become a member of the MCC, so those of us who are members wear our ties with extreme pride.\\\"\", \"He recalled too, James Bond author Ian Fleming, who said: \\\"Bond never trusted anybody who tied their tie in a Windsor Knot or wore suede shoes.\\\"\", \"Fry acknowledged however that in some senses ties were \\\"dead\\\", noting that even London's five star hotels had now removed the requirement to wear them for fear of losing patrons.\", \"\\\"[Ties are] dead inasmuch as in 'cool' businesses - Silicon Valley and Hollywood and places like that - no one wears a tie; it would be considered weird,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I think the rulers of Wall Street, the really powerful ones, don't wear ties, because they can afford not to - they can imitate Steve Jobs and wear turtle necks, or they can just be loose at the collar because they are the boss, whereas the poor 'slave' has a tie and the tie is a symbol of their ... being a serf, almost.\\\"\", \"Fry encouraged workers who were still impelled to wear ties to take back some control by exercising their freedom of expression.\", \"\\\"If you wear a tie because you just have to then for goodness' sake make it a stylish one, make it a statement.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"ba905dba451911ecb4a2f54d80430ac1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ba905dba451911ecb4a2f54d80430ac1"}},
