Mr Nouri walked off the plane on 9 November 2019 and straight into custody.\", \"A short time later, a Swedish official made a phone call to deliver a message: \\\"You can go home now.\\\"\", \"The recipient of the call had been at the airport, nervously waiting for confirmation of the arrest.

He is currently on trial in Sweden.\", \"These crimes were allegedly committed during the war between Iran and Iraq. As the war neared its end, Iran's then supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, ordered the execution of about 5,000 political prisoners. \", \"Many were linked to the People's Mujahedin of Iran, an opposition group allied to Iraq.\", \"At the time, Mr Nouri was working in a prison near Tehran, prosecutors say. \", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/7CF2/production/_120368913_gettyimages-1234604541-594x594.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A courtroom sketch shows Iranian defendant Hamid Nouri sitting in the District Court of Stockholm</div>\", \"The case could raise uncomfortable questions for Iran's new president, Ebrahim Raisi, who Amnesty International has named as a member of a \\\"death commission\\\" involved in the 1988 massacre.\", \"It is also a watershed moment for human rights activists who have long campaigned for justice over the executions. Among them is Iraj Mesdaghi, a former Iranian political prisoner who survived the 1988 massacre.\", \"He says he witnessed unspeakable crimes while imprisoned in Iran.\", \"Etched into his memory, his experiences during that period have shaped his life since he left Iran in the 1990s.
