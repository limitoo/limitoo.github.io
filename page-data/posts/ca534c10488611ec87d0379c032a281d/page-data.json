What’s a royal family to do?","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-18T15:47:38.000Z","content":"[\"One of the most satisfying moments of \\u201cThe Princess Switch 3: Romancing the Star\\u201d is seeing the scheming villain Fiona, in sequined beanie and stiletto sandals, swabbing the floors of the local convent and orphanage, working off the hefty community service sentence she earned last year in the previous edition of this seasonal Netflix movie series directed by Mike Rohl.\", \"The only scene to top it is when Fiona (Vanessa Hudgens) tries to walk a dog, and ends up being hauled along a snow-dusted sidewalk like a sled by the very Great Dane at the end of the leash. But it turns out that even this batty outsider has something to contribute when her cousin Queen Margaret (also Vanessa Hudgens) needs her help \\u2014 and can commute her community service.\", \"Margaret and Fiona\\u2019s look-alike cousin from America, Stacy (also played by you-know-who), is on hand with Prince Edward (Sam Palladio), her handsome but clueless husband, for the much-anticipated Christmas pageant. One thing is certain: The celebration will be dripping with enough lights to run up a staggering electric bill. What they don\\u2019t suspect is that an intrigue of Continental proportions is going to shake up the impeccable snow globe that is Montenaro.\", \"That intrigue would involve the Star of Peace, a precious decorative relic from the Vatican (who knew there was a lending library there?), which has barely arrived when it mysteriously disappears. What the royal retinue needs is an expert on the criminal mind: in a word, Fiona.\", \"When the flamboyant answer to their prayers sashays into the room, she locks eyes with Stacy\\u2019s husband and greets him with a purring \\u201cHello, royal six-pack.\\u201d That\\u2019s how she talks. And she meows, and says \\u201cZzzzzzzttttt!\\u201d\", \"Anyone who has seen one of these movies can just take over for the characters and guess their lines as easily as the three cousins can swap clothes and accents to impersonate one another.\", \"Interchangeable though the cousins may be, Fiona grabs the spotlight this year. Through her connections she produces an ex, Peter Maxwell (Remy Hii), a former Interpol officer with the sophisticated suite of crook-catching tools needed to retrieve the Star. But, paving the way for more sequels that are less superficial, she is drawn as the one character who actually grows, who steps out of her one-dimensional bad-girl type to reveal her vulnerability. Sharing some long-buried memories, she helps us understand why she is cold and distant when she puts down her peppermint martini and feather boa.\"]","href_hash":"ca534c10488611ec87d0379c032a281d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ca534c10488611ec87d0379c032a281d"}},
