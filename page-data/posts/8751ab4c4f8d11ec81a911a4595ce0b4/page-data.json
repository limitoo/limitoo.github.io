Mr. Strickland, 62, said on Friday that the community did not owe him anything for his wrongful imprisonment.\", \"\\u201cThe courts failed me and that\\u2019s who should be trying to make my life a little more comfortable,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI really do appreciate the donations and contributions they made to try to help me acclimate to society.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Strickland said the four days back in Kansas City had been overwhelming.\", \"The sprawl of highways was especially dizzying, he said during a phone call while headed to the Independence Center shopping mall to spend $25 that someone had given him. He said he planned to buy a bag of cough drops and a shower cap \\u2014 his first purchases outside of prison in more than 40 years.\", \"The online fund-raiser, organized by the Midwest Innocence Project, was set up by Tricia Rojo Bushnell, one of his lawyers and the project\\u2019s executive director. Ms. Bushnell said she routinely raises funds for newly released clients but the amount raised for Mr. Strickland was a surprise.\", \"\\u201cI think for all of us it\\u2019s hopeful, right?\\u201d Ms. Bushnell said. \\u201cUntil the system has changed where the system is failing, the community is stepping in to fix it, to fill the void. It\\u2019s pretty amazing.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Strickland does not yet have a bank account, a phone or a form of government identification. For now, he is staying at a brother\\u2019s house.\", \"Mr. Strickland will receive the full amount of the donations as soon as he has a bank account to transfer it into, Ms. Bushnell said. The Midwest Innocence Project will also set him up with a financial adviser to help him structure the money and determine how he wishes to spend it.\", \"Ms. Bushnell printed out a packet of supportive comments that accompanied the many donations.\", \"\\u201cI wish I knew how many pages it is, but it\\u2019s very thick,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe can read them and see them and know that it\\u2019s not just monetary. The folks have messages and stories of hope for him.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Strickland was convicted in 1979 of killing three people in Kansas City the year before: Sherrie Black, 22; Larry Ingram, 21; and John Walker, 20. The only eyewitness had picked Mr. Strickland from a lineup. Mr. Strickland was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole for 50 years.\", \"One of the two other men who pleaded guilty to the murders maintained that Mr. Strickland played no part in the killings, and the sole eyewitness later recanted her testimony, Judge James E. Welsh of Missouri\\u2019s Western District Court of Appeals noted in his decision to exonerate Mr. Strickland.\", \"The exoneration advanced after the passage this year of a state law allowing prosecutors to hold hearings for potential wrongful convictions for which there was new evidence.\", \"Jean Peters Baker, the prosecutor for Jackson County, said in a statement that she filed a motion in Mr. Strickland\\u2019s case as soon as she could in August.\", \"\\u201cMr. Strickland was falsely held for 43 years and he doesn\\u2019t have a single cent to support him from the State of Missouri,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe should be paid for this wrong that happened to him. No one could argue that would not be the right thing, the just thing, to do.\\u201d\", \"Barbara O\\u2019Brien, the editor of the National Registry of Exonerations, said there is a misconception that a majority of exonerations relied on DNA evidence. Of the registry\\u2019s 2,900 exonerations, only 549 involved DNA.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s shortsighted to have a compensation scheme that turns on whether or not there\\u2019s DNA evidence of innocence because that has nothing to do with how innocent they are,\\u201d she said.\", \"Ann Jacobs, executive director of John Jay College\\u2019s Institute for Justice and Opportunity, said that the goal of re-entry into society was to \\u201cmove from survival\\u201d to a plan for long-term stability and self-sufficiency.\", \"\\u201cEverybody who, you know, goes away for some period of time has to come back and reconstruct a whole life for themselves, and their ability to do that is different depending on what their lives were like before they went in, how long they\\u2019ve been away, and what kind of support exists for them when they get out,\\u201d she said.\", \"In many cases, it is very important for those exonerated to receive a formal apology, Ms. O\\u2019Brien said. Mr. Strickland said he would have liked to receive apologies from top state officials but that he\\u2019s not dwelling on it.\", \"There are other life plans to attend to, he said, like leaving Missouri and pursuing his dream of buying a small piece of land outside of a city.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ll build a small house, a small bedroom, two- to three-bedroom house, have me some chickens and four to five dogs, a fishing pond somewhere close by, a big fence where nobody can get in,\\u201d he said. \\u201cJust some alone time, some getaway space.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8751ab4c4f8d11ec81a911a4595ce0b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8751ab4c4f8d11ec81a911a4595ce0b4"}},
