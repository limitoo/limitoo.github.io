A few years ago, a high-octane romance suddenly exploded in spectacular fashion, out of nowhere. One of us shut down. The other spiraled. In the immediate blast radius, for both parties, it was as heartbreaking as it was indecipherable. \", \"Near the end, this person expressed their desire to untangle their side of things, along with a photo of a book they had just purchased: \\u201cAttached: The New Science of Adult Attachment, and How It Can Help You Find \\u2014 and Keep \\u2014 Love.\\u201d I bought it a few days later. \", \"The result? Revelatory. Not for what I learned about them, but for what I discovered about myself, my own contribution to this romantic meltdown, and one thing or another about pretty much all the relationships that came before it. To say it changed the way I view (let alone operate in) romance since then would be a vast understatement.\", \"So \\u201cyeah, of course,\\u201d I told my therapist, like she asked me about FM radio. \\u201cI\\u2019ve read \\u2018Attached.\\u2019 What about it?\\u201d I went on to describe the various attachment styles the book describes, characterized my own, and explained how I\\u2019ve seen it reflected throughout my life.\", \"It takes a lot to surprise a therapist. But for the briefest of moments, my therapist was stunned: not because familiarity with this book and its contents made me unique, but just the opposite. She\\u2019s been recommending \\u201cAttached\\u201d for the last eight years, and I was just the latest in a new, recent stream of patients who got to this book well before she could push it on me.\", \"Published in December 2010, \\u201cAttached\\u201d sounds, superficially, like so many other schmaltzy self-help tomes that came before it (\\u201cMen Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus,\\u201d \\u201cHe\\u2019s Just Not That Into You,\\u201d \\u201cThe Rules: Time-Tested Secrets for Capturing the Heart of Mr. Right,\\u201d et al).\", \"But \\u201cAttached\\u201d is built on a key differentiator: the social science underlying its upshot, starting with attachment theory, the well-established thesis of psychology dating back to the mid-20th century dealing in children\\u2019s bonds with caregivers. \", \"One of the authors of the book, Dr. Amir Levine \\u2014 a clinical psychiatrist and molecular neuroscience researcher at Columbia University \\u2014 was working in a program using \\u201cattachment-guided therapy\\u201d to bond mothers and children when he stumbled into research he\\u2019d never seen before.\", \"The research, conducted by Cindy Hazan and Phillip Shaver, showed adults\\u2019 relationships in romantic settings as similar to the styles of children\\u2019s attachments to parents. \", \"Dr. Levine\\u2019s \\u201ceureka\\u201d moment came not long after, when he imagined that, if this research could be practically applied to adults\\u2019 love lives, its implications \\u2014 that one can (theoretically) learn how to better understand romantic partners or choose romantic partners or cope with the behaviors of a romantic partner \\u2014 could be significant. Paradigm-shifting, even. \", \"He reached out to a longtime friend and writer, Rachel Heller. He explained his revelation, and his ambition to explain this science to laypeople to help change their lives, but needed help packaging it into a digestible, actionable book that wasn\\u2019t just a bunch of research citations. Ms. Heller agreed, they wrote the book together, and sold it through an agent.\", \"To many, many people: They were on to something.\", \"The book lays out the three primary adult attachment styles, which, like those of children, are: anxious, avoidant or secure. Our attachment styles reveal themselves in romantic, emotionally intimate situations \\u2014 for example, during a fight, a breakup, or that precarious, weird moment when a relationship goes from casual dating to a serious prospect. In these situations, people with anxious attachment styles can instinctively crave emotional intimacy, and can become frenetically preoccupied with love and their ability to have,\\u00a0or lose, it (see: the aforementioned spinning out). \", \"People with avoidant attachment styles tend to reflexively align this intimacy with losing independence and being suffocated, shutting down or pushing it away (again, see: the aforementioned shutting down). \", \"And those with secure attachment styles don\\u2019t feel threatened or spun out by romantic intimacy \\u2014 they communicate warmly, and honestly.\", \"Everyone more or less falls into one of these three categories: according to Dr. Hazan and Dr. Shaver\\u2019s research, their subjects were about 56 percent secure, 20 percent anxious/ambivalent, 23 percent avoidant and 3 to 5 percent in a \\u201cdisorganized\\u201d category (where participants vacillate between two distinct styles). These styles affected the way we deal with relationship conflicts, our feelings toward sex, our expectations in romantic intimacy and everything in between.\", \"\\u201cIt was interesting,\\u201d my therapist later told me, \\u201cbecause at the time, I noticed many of my patients over the last couple months were not only familiar with the book and the context, but some of the terms: avoidant and secure and anxious.\\u201d \", \"It wasn\\u2019t just her noticing the uptick. In the three years since I read it, I saw the book more and more often on other people\\u2019s bookshelves, had more conversations about it, even overheard more conversations about it.\", \"When I asked around about acquaintances\\u2019 familiarity with the book, the following responded, excitedly, that they\\u2019ve read it: My hairdresser (and her roommate), four exes, a newly married friend\\u2019s wife, a best friend\\u2019s new girlfriend, a former roommate, an old summer camp friend, four former colleagues (one of whom called it \\u201cthe most important book I\\u2019ve ever read\\u201d) and a friend from high school I haven\\u2019t seen in over a decade. And those were just the people I knew.\", \"In 2021, \\u201cAttached\\u201d is a top-ranked book on Amazon under the \\u201cSocial Science,\\u201d \\u201cCognitive Psychology\\u201d and \\u201cLove and Romance\\u201d categories. It\\u2019s in Amazon\\u2019s Top 200 books currently. It\\u2019s been translated into 20 languages, and is the rare book that sells an increasing number of copies year to year since its release.\", \"Not long after the conversation with my therapist, I started cobbling together a theory of my own: \\u201cAttached\\u201d exploded in popularity around the start of the pandemic as single people wondered if they\\u2019d be alone the next time the world felt as if it was ending. It also, I imagined, appealed to couples who were watching their relationships crumble under the pressure cooker of the first wave of lockdown.\", \"Lee Robinson, a 29-year-old comedian from Colorado, was one of those who worried about being alone. She had a relationship end a few months before the pandemic. She was in lockdown by herself, started hearing about attachment styles that spring, and read the book later during the summer, after it was recommended ad nauseam by multiple friends. Her reaction?\", \"\\u201cIt clicked,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI was able to kind of look at old relationships with a new lens.\\u201d And now, she joked, \\u201cwithin the queer community, it\\u2019s accepted knowledge \\u2014 our version of the Bible.\\u201d \", \"The book\\u2019s prominence is such that at this point, among her friends, it\\u2019s coming up within the first three dates: \\u201cGet in the water! Are you even going to be serious with someone if you\\u2019re not talking about attachment styles?\\u201d she said, laughing. \", \"She, too, had brought it up to her therapist \\u2014 not the other way around. And of course, on her recommendation, her roommate read it as well.\", \"Sure enough: The book industry database Bookscan shows \\u201cAttached\\u201d experiencing a hockey-stick-like surge in sales,\\u00a0leaping from about 62,000 hard copies (not counting e-reader or audio versions) sold in the United States in 2019 to over 82,000 in 2020. This year, as of the end of October, about 102,300 copies have been sold.\", \"Megan Newman, the vice president and publisher of TarcherPedigree \\u2014 which, in addition to \\u201cAttached,\\u201d also published \\u201cThe Artist\\u2019s Way\\u201d and \\u201cAtomic Habits,\\u201d two other books that have transcended the \\u201cself help\\u201d label into pop ubiquity \\u2014 said it\\u2019s remarkable that sales have risen when the authors do little press and there has been little in the way of concentrated advertising and marketing efforts. She attributes much of its success to word of mouth.\", \"\\u201cThe other thing,\\u201d she added, \\u201cis the rise of TikTok.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s hard not to find something substantiating a trend on a social network, but the over 189 million views attributed to #AttachmentStyle TikTok (or the over 72 million views attributed to #AttachmentTheory) are far from inconsequential. From therapists explaining what the various attachment styles are, to millennials acting out previous relationships falling to anxious/avoidant conflicts, there\\u2019s plenty there to consume. \", \"What you won\\u2019t find much of are criticisms of the book \\u2014 which do, in fact, exist.\", \"Even though my therapist believes the book is \\u201cexcellent,\\u201d she sees it as a broad tool that should be used within the context of therapy (she admits that she\\u2019s biased). \", \"While the book offers a test to assess one\\u2019s own attachment style, she pointed out that people can get self-assessments wrong (hence, uh, the therapy profession), to say nothing of assessing others\\u2019 styles, and even more, being unable to differentiate between someone\\u2019s personality (they just don\\u2019t like to text) and the amateur pathologizing of their attachment style (\\u201cthey\\u2019re avoidant\\u201d). \", \"People who aren\\u2019t mental health professionals, she explained, don\\u2019t have the training to \\u201cunderstand all of the other biopsychosocial influences\\u201d that comprise a person.\", \"This gets at the root of one of the primary knocks against the book, from its critics: Its view toward intimacy issues is often tilted at finding partners who suit one\\u2019s own attachment style \\u2014 either one that matches, or someone with a secure attachment style \\u2014 rather than mending relationships between two conflicting attachment styles, which the book dedicates some real estate to, but not a ton. \", \"Other critics, like Rob Weisskirch, a professor of Human Development at California State University, Monterey Bay, question the larger paradigm of adult attachment theory. Dr. Weisskirch hasn\\u2019t read the book but believes the theory is limiting because it demonstrates only four types of ways people relate in relationships. \", \"He also pointed out that the ultimate goal with attachment theory is often \\u201cthinking about long-term partnership. But that\\u2019s kind of an old notion, to think that everyone\\u2019s going to be in a long-term relationship. Because there are some people who are very happy not being in long term relationship.\\u201d\", \"Alexis Hyde, the director of the Museum of Broken Relationships in Los Angeles, hasn\\u2019t read the book either, nor will she stock it in the museum\\u2019s bookstore. \", \"\\u201cAs somebody who\\u2019s in the business of them, I find broken relationships \\u2014 and the things that occur that create them \\u2014 to be incredibly nuanced,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot more causes than just: These are four types of attachment styles. And this is just the way it\\u2019s been described to me. I don\\u2019t want to engage with this kind of discourse. The self-identifying as an anxious attachment type or an avoidant attachment type, or labeling someone else \\u2014 those words become insurmountable. You\\u2019re creating these barriers of: I can\\u2019t get out of this.\\u201d \", \"Her sense is that people will say \\u201c\\u2018I\\u2019m avoidant, guess I\\u2019m never going to have a relationship.\\u2019 \\u2018I\\u2019m anxious. So I\\u2019m, I\\u2019m texting him too much, and that\\u2019s why he doesn\\u2019t like me.\\u2019 Those kinds of words have power.\\u201d\", \"Another critique is that the book flattens nuance out of some very complicated ideas, and that its success is owed to part of a larger trend of people overeager to reduce themselves or others to a single style (see: Myers-Briggs tests, Enneagram typing, Zodiac signs). They do this, goes the critique, in order to further pronounce their own identity, rather than realizing that our behavior and attachment styles (and thus, our identities) aren\\u2019t so precisely fixed, or attributable to just one single thing.\", \"\\u201cThere is a spectrum,\\u201d Dr. Levine said when I spoke to him in September. \\u201cBut what the research finds is that there is a predominant characteristic that you can find yourself gravitating toward more. And I think that\\u2019s helpful to know.\\u201d \", \"As for the critique of the book needing to be read in therapy? He agreed that this would be ideal, but contended that while not everyone has access to therapy, most people have access to a library, and something is better than nothing. He also agreed that the book attempts to negotiate the fine line between being a wonkish academic treatise, and being over-distilled \\u2014 and it may not always succeed to people\\u2019s tastes on either side.\", \"In our interview, given that he had just been read a series of pitches against his life\\u2019s work he\\u2019s no doubt heard time and time again, Dr. Levine was a remarkably good sport. This may have something to do with that fact that he\\u2019s not some globe-trotting, TED-talking, Oprah-approved sage-on-a-stage celebrity love guru, but instead, a sheepish, shy, sweetly enthusiastic Columbia academic, who spends most of his days seeing patients, conducting research, writing and talking about neural-developmental pathologies. \", \"While he foresaw a rise in sales during the pandemic, Dr. Levine remains as mystified at the book\\u2019s success over the last decade as anyone else. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think I still fully realize it,\\u201d he said, laughing. And no, he knew nothing about #AttachmentStyle TikTok.\", \"He even conceded what he would do differently if he wrote it now, which is to emphasize the need for empathy toward avoidant attachment styles, who suffer as much (if not, in many ways, more so) than those with anxious attachment styles. Their instinctive aversion to intimacy can translate to more broken relationships with people they genuinely love, and thus, more loneliness, despite deeply desiring companionship. \", \"Remarkably, when he talks about writing the book, he sounds \\u2026 exactly like nearly everyone who\\u2019s ever read it.\", \"At the time he came across the research that would form the basis of the book, he was going through a breakup (he\\u2019s in a relationship now). What he learned \\u201creally helped me so much to understand everything that was going on in that breakup. It was really an eye-opening experience.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"86f56ff641f711ec9b3a000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"86f56ff641f711ec9b3a000017025a03"}},
