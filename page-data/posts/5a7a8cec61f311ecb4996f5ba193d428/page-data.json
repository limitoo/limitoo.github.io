They were accused of using an essential worker exemption to travel through Auckland's southern boundary to Hamilton before flying to Queenstown via Wellingotn and then driving to W\\u0101naka. Auckland was at alert level 4 at the time.\\u00a0\", \"While the couple were originally scheduled to appear at the Papakura District Court on October 14, the COVID-19 alert levels have caused a series of delays.\", \"The pair appeared via audio-visual link on Tuesday and pleaded guilty.\", \"The case gripped the country mid-lockdown, with the pair coming under intense public scrutiny. After initially receiving interim name suppression, the couple were named in mid-September, releasing a statement apologising to New Zealand for their actions.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We initially sought name suppression after receiving death threats and we had genuine fear for our safety. However, we remain committed to taking responsibility for our actions and will not be seeking further name suppression,\\\" they said.\", \"\\\"We understand that strict compliance is required to stamp out COVID-19 from our country. We have let everyone down with our actions, and we wholeheartedly apologise.\\\"\", \"The pair said they had negative COVID-19 tests before travelling to W\\u0101naka and after returning and had not visited any locations of interest, nor were close contacts.\", \"Willis' mother, District Court judge Mary-Beth Sharp, also released a statement condemning the pair's behaviour. She said she was \\\"appalled\\\" by their actions and was \\\"highly embarrassed\\\".\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Had I known of their intentions, which of course I did not, I would have told them not to act so thoughtlessly and selfishly. I do not condone their conduct.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"5a7a8cec61f311ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5a7a8cec61f311ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
