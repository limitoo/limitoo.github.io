Greg Abbott directed education officials to \\u201cinvestigate any criminal activity in our public schools involving the availability of pornography.\\u201d A Republican state representative also emailed superintendents a list of 850 books, asking if they were in school libraries or classrooms.\", \"The list was a mix of half-century-old novels \\u2014 including \\u201cThe Confessions of Nat Turner\\u201d by William Styron \\u2014 and works by Ta-Nehisi Coates and Margaret Atwood, as well as edgy young adult books touching on sexual identity. \", \"The list is just one example. This fall, a talk by an award-winning writer was canceled. The first Black principal in a Dallas suburb resigned, accused of sanctioning the teaching of critical race theory.\", \"This month, a San Antonio district ordered 400 books taken off its shelves for a review. And the state education agency opened an investigation in a district in North Texas over whether it gave students books with \\u201csexually explicit content.\\u201d\", \"Absent any state law, some librarians have been told to pre-emptively pull down books.\", \"\\u201cOne minute they\\u2019re talking critical race theory,\\u201d said Carrie Damon, a middle school librarian. \\u201cSuddenly I\\u2019m hearing librarians are indoctrinating students.\\u201d\", \"My colleague Michael Powell reported that teachers are all but slapping their heads in frustration.\", \"Some pointed in particular to the clause in the state law that says a teacher must not inculcate the idea that students should feel \\u201cresponsibility, blame or guilt\\u201d because of their race or sex. The state representative, Matt Krause, went a step further, suggesting that a teacher might overstep simply by assigning a book that troubles a student.\", \"To teach Shakespeare and Toni Morrison, to read Gabriel Garc\\u00eda M\\u00e1rquez or Frederick Douglass, teachers told Michael, is to elicit swells of emotions, out of which can arise introspection and self-recognition, sorrow and joy.\", \"The challenge is no different for a social studies teacher talking of Cherokee dying along the Trail of Tears or white gangs lynching Black and Mexican people.\", \"\\u201cI have had kids triggered by difficult texts,\\u201d said Ayn Nys, an English teacher. \\u201cIt\\u2019s our responsibility to prepare students emotionally and intellectually with a diversity of voices.\\u201d\", \"Fights over books are not new, especially not in Texas.\", \"One flashpoint: the Alamo. People of Mexican and Indigenous descent have long tried to complicate an entrenched state narrative about the battle. This year, the Republican lieutenant governor pressured a museum to cancel a panel to discuss a revisionist book \\u2014 \\u201cForget the Alamo\\u201d \\u2014 examining its slaveholding combatants.\", \"Another point of argument: The 1619 Project. Now a book, the special issue of The New York Times Magazine tried to place Black Americans and the consequences of slavery at the center of America\\u2019s narrative. The law singles it out as forbidden.\", \"The Texas law does not mention critical race theory. But it does prohibit teachers from portraying slavery and racism as \\u201canything other than deviations from, betrayals of, or failures to live up to the authentic founding principles of the United States.\\u201d\", \"This conflicts with the views of many scholars \\u2014 including many writing in The 1619 Project \\u2014\\u00a0who note that from America\\u2019s founding, slavery was woven into the structure of the nation and the Constitution.\", \"\\u201cEducation is not above the fray; it is the fray,\\u201d said Robert Pondiscio, a former teacher and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a public policy group. \\u201cIt\\u2019s na\\u00efve to think otherwise.\\u201d\", \"As the first semester of a third pandemic school year draws to a close, many teachers and parents across the state are wondering: How does this end?\", \"\\u201cOK, you ban a book \\u2014 does that ban the topic?\\u201d Kathleen Harrison, another teacher, said while shaking her head. \\u201cAt what point do I practice subversion?\\u201d\", \"Chicago has a new school chief executive. New York City and Los Angeles will soon have new leadership. And Becky Pringle, who became president of the National Education Association last year, is helping shape education policy. Here, a spin through this changing of the guard.\", \"Becky Pringle: Under President Biden, teachers\\u2019 unions have re-emerged as power players in shaping federal education policy. The N.E.A., in particular, has enjoyed increased visibility: Jill Biden, the first lady and a longtime educator, is a member.\", \"But the union has been criticized for having outsize power \\u2014 both in the Biden administration and over school reopening decisions during the pandemic.\", \"Pringle defended her union in a tweet: \\u201cIt\\u2019s no secret we want to keep our students and schools safe.\\u201d And she is also plunging into the racial reckoning unfolding in the public schools. For more, here\\u2019s a profile by my colleague Erica Green.\", \"David Banks: The next N.Y.C. schools chancellor will occupy arguably the second-most-influential education job in America, after the federal education secretary.\", \"Banks, the founder of the Eagle Academy for Young Men and a close friend and key adviser to the incoming mayor, Eric Adams, has sweeping changes in mind for the sprawling, beleaguered system: He said his first priorities would include expanding early childhood education options, improving career pathways for older students, and combating students\\u2019 trauma.\", \"\\u201cThe very fabric of how we\\u2019re actually measuring our children, and measuring progress for our schools, is fundamentally flawed,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t mean that test scores don\\u2019t mean anything; they do. They just don\\u2019t mean everything.\\u201d Here\\u2019s a profile, by my colleague Eliza Shapiro.\", \"Alberto Carvalho: In 2018, he quite publicly spurned New York City and opted to stay as the head of Miami-Dade County Public Schools. But Carvalho is now heading west \\u2014 to be the next superintendent of Los Angeles public schools, the second-largest district in the U.S.\", \"The Los Angeles Times writes that Carvalho brings \\u201ca reputation for stability and improved student achievement.\\u201d Los Angeles faces \\u201csharply declining enrollment and a long-term structural deficit.\\u201d\", \"Carvalho spoke of the urgency of addressing \\u201cunprecedented learning loss and unfinished learning as a result of this pandemic that has disproportionately impacted the most fragile amongst us \\u2014 students of color, students who are poor English-language learners, and students with disabilities.\\u201d Here\\u2019s the L.A.
