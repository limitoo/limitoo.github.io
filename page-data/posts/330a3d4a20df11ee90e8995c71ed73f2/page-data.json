There's compromised patient care because you're just trying to do as much as you can with the limited time and resources that you have.\", \"\\\"There's unsafe waiting times which are being seen. There's an increase in patients having to wait and self discharging from the department who aren't receiving probably all of the medical care that we would like to provide in the best case scenario.\\\"\", \"Government figures put out in October for care capacity suggest Christchurch ED needs roughly 140 full time nurses to meet demand.\", \"It currently has about 108 full time nurses in the ED.\", \"Te Whatu Ora has been trying hard to get more staff onboard, but they were still under resourced, Isaac said.\", \"\\\"Our community deserves better.
