Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Dec. 6-12. Details and times are subject to change.\", \"LANDSCAPERS 9 p.m. on HBO. Olivia Colman and David Thewlis star in this British true-crime mini-series. Mixing drama and dark humor, it centers on Susan and Christopher Edwards (Colman and Thewlis), a married couple who in 2014 were found guilty of the 1998 murder of Susan\\u2019s parents, whose bodies they had buried in the garden of their home in an English village.\", \"LIVE IN FRONT OF A STUDIO AUDIENCE: \\u2018THE FACTS OF LIFE\\u2019 AND \\u2018DIFF\\u2019RENT STROKES\\u2019 8 p.m. on ABC. This latest entry in ABC\\u2019s series of live recreations of classic sitcoms resuscitates two shows from the 1980s \\u2014 \\u201cThe Facts of Life\\u201d and \\u201cDiff\\u2019rent Strokes\\u201d \\u2014 with the help of celebrity guests, including Jennifer Aniston, Gabrielle Union, Kathryn Hahn, Allison Tolman and Ann Dowd.\", \"A VERY HAROLD & KUMAR CHRISTMAS (2011) 5:15 p.m. on FXM. How should one introduce Kal Penn? \\u201cThe comic actor Kal Penn?\\u201d \\u201cThe former White House staffer Kal Penn?\\u201d Last month, Penn reminded the world of how novel his career has been with the release of a memoir, \\u201cYou Can\\u2019t Be Serious,\\u201d which has anecdotes about his time working for President Barack Obama and his experiences acting opposite John Cho in the \\u201cHarold & Kumar\\u201d stoner comedy movies. This holiday-themed entry in that series is a case point: Penn took a pause from his Washington role to film it, swapping the White House Office of Public Liaison for a hot-boxed sedan.\", \"DIRTY TRICKS (2021) 8 p.m. on Showtime. This documentary from Daniel Sivan (\\u201cThe Oslo Diaries\\u201d) explores a scandal among elite competitive bridge players. At the film\\u2019s center is Lotan Fisher, an Israeli bridge champion who became the focus of a cheating scandal in 2015. The documentary looks at both that scandal and at the world of high-stakes bridge playing more broadly. It has a surprising and inviting sense of humor.\", \"ENEMY OF THE STATE (1998) 6 p.m. on BBC America. Will Smith had an early dramatic starring role in this thriller from Tony Scott. Smith plays Robert Clayton Dean, a lawyer who gets framed for the murder of a congressman and teams up with a former intelligence agent (Gene Hackman) to prove his innocence. The congressman\\u2019s killing is orchestrated by a corrupt N.S.A. officer (Jon Voight), and carried out because of the congressman\\u2019s opposition to a piece of legislation that would expand the surveillance powers of intelligence agencies. In other words, the premise rests on the idea that \\u201cprivacy is imperiled by runaway electronics,\\u201d Janet Maslin wrote in her review for The New York Times in November 1998, during the impeachment inquiry against President Bill Clinton. \\u201cIn a week that finds the nation listening to surreptitiously taped Washington telephone calls,\\u201d Maslin wrote, \\u201cwho\\u2019s to say that \\u2018Enemy of the State\\u2019 doesn\\u2019t have a point?\\u201d Obviously, the potential problem of tech privacy has completely died down in the decades since and is no longer a concern \\u2014 nothing to see here.\", \"LIMBO (2021) 8:10 p.m. on HBO. A Syrian musician seeks asylum in Britain and is sent to a very remote, very weird Scottish island to wait for a verdict on his request in this sweet satire. Directed by Ben Sharrock, the film follows Omar (Amir El-Masry), a talented oud player, whose experiences on the island include a comically elementary \\u201cCultural Awareness\\u201d course and a somewhat lopsided friendship with a new housemate, Farhad (Vikash Bhai), who aspires to be for Omar what Brian Epstein once was for the Beatles. While many recent films about the migrant and refugee situation in Europe take a gritty approach grounded in the real tragedy, this one \\u201ctakes an insinuating, poetic and often wryly funny approach,\\u201d Glenn Kenny wrote in his review for The Times. The results, he said, are \\u201cboth heartbreaking and heartlifting.\\u201d\", \"WEST SIDE STORY (1961) 8 p.m. on TCM. \\u201cNothing short of a cinematic masterpiece.\\u201d That\\u2019s how Bosley Crowther characterized this original big-screen adaptation of \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d in his review for The Times after the film debuted in midtown Manhattan in 1961. Make it part of a double feature this weekend by pairing this classic version \\u2014 which stars Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer and Rita Moreno \\u2014 with the new version from Steven Spielberg and the playwright Tony Kushner, which is set to hit theaters on Friday.\", \"THE REVENANT (2015) 7:30 p.m. and 10:40 p.m. on FXM. Leonardo DiCaprio will return to theaters this week in Adam McKay\\u2019s \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up,\\u201d a climate satire that stars DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence as two scientists trying to save earth from destruction. That role is a bit of a reversal from DiCaprio\\u2019s character in \\u201cThe Revenant\\u201d: Hugh Glass, a early-19th-century frontiersman whom Mother Earth does her best to kill. In this flashy period drama, directed by Alejandro G. I\\u00f1\\u00e1rritu, an injured Glass is betrayed and left for dead by a fellow fur trapper, John Fitzgerald (Tom Hardy), and hobbles his way through the wilderness bent on revenge. It\\u2019s a movie packed with \\u201cbutchered animals, muddled ideas, heart-skippingly natural landscapes and moment after moment of visual and narrative sizzle,\\u201d Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The Times. It\\u2019s \\u201can American foundation story,\\u201d Dargis said, \\u201cby turns soaring and overblown.\\u201d\", \"A FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA DOUBLE FEATURE 8 p.m. on TCM. See two pre-\\u201cGodfather\\u201d Francis Ford Coppola movies on Sunday night. Up first, at 8 p.m.: FINIAN\\u2019S RAINBOW (1968), a musical fantasy with Fred Astaire and Petula Clark. Then, at 10:30 p.m., YOU\\u2019RE A BIG BOY NOW (1966), a comedy based on the David Benedictus novel of the same name about a romance between a New York Public Library clerk and a go-go dancer.\"]","href_hash":"a03909bc565d11ecb1614f1a68b67c36"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a03909bc565d11ecb1614f1a68b67c36"}},
