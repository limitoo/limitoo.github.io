A federal judge will decide in the spring how much the three pharmacies will pay in damages.\", \"Attorneys for the three companies argued that the pharmacy chains established policies aimed at stemming pill distribution and flagging authorities about any suspicious orders when concerns were brought up by pharmacists. They also said it was up to doctors to determine how many pills to prescribe for patients, the AP reported.\", \"But the jury sided with the attorneys for Lake and Trumbull counties, who argued that the pharmacies' distribution of the pain pills played an extensive role in creating the crisis in their communities.\", \"The two Ohio counties also sued Pittsburgh-based Giant Eagle and Rite Aid for their roles in the local opioid crisis, but both companies decided to settle the lawsuits. In a joint statement after the settlement, Giant Eagle denied playing a role in the opioid crisis but acknowledged its significance and the \\\"hard work of the public officials working to address the harms.\\\"\", \"\\\"Giant Eagle intends to continue helping the communities in which it operates to address the opioid crisis in a productive way,\\\" the statement said.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938870/opioid-case-ruling.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Three retail pharmacy chains recklessly distributed massive amounts of pain pills in two Ohio counties, a federal jury said in its verdict Tuesday.
