She was 87.\", \"Her daughter Dora Nichols confirmed her death. She did not give a cause but said Ms. Cleave had Alzheimer\\u2019s disease.\", \"When Ms. Cleave began writing the column \\u201cDisc Date\\u201d for The London Evening Standard in 1961, serious writing about pop music was in its infancy. She helped raise its profile, in columns that featured conversations with luminaries including Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and the Rolling Stones. She became a marquee byline; in 1976, The Standard called her \\u201cthe writer who gets people to talk about themselves in the way no other writer can match.\\u201d\", \"But she was best known for her regular reporting on the Beatles, with whom she had a warm relationship, and whom she described affectionately in the newspaper\\u2019s pages. Her piece headlined \\u201cThe Year of the Beatles,\\u201d published in The Standard in 1963, was one of the first major newspaper articles about the band.\", \"\\u201cTheir behavior ranges from the preposterous, farcical and impossible to the kindly, thoughtful and polite,\\u201d Ms. Cleave wrote. \\u201cYou are outraged, diverted and charmed. You are never, ever bored.\\u201d\", \"Her biggest moment stemmed from an interview with Lennon published in March 1966, in which she delved into his thoughts on organized religion. \\u201cChristianity will go,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt will vanish and shrink. I needn\\u2019t argue about that; I know I\\u2019m right and will be proved right. We\\u2019re more popular than Jesus now. I don\\u2019t know which will go first \\u2014 rock \\u2019n' roll or Christianity.\\u201d\", \"Readers, and the rest of the British press, paid little notice. But in July, a month before the Beatles began a tour of the United States, the American magazine Datebook reprinted the interview and provoked a frenzy.\", \"Lennon\\u2019s remark, which came to be widely known as a claim that the Beatles were \\u201cbigger than Jesus,\\u201d prompted demonstrations and drew the ire of many American Christians. Lennon was accused of blasphemy \\u2014 as, by extension, was Ms. Cleave.\", \"A Baptist pastor in Cleveland threatened excommunication for members of his parish who attended a Beatles concert. The Ku Klux Klan protested Lennon\\u2019s remarks. The Vatican issued a statement condemning the comparison.\", \"Lennon apologized \\u2014 albeit reluctantly \\u2014 at a news conference during the American tour, under pressure from the band\\u2019s manager, Brian Epstein.\", \"Paul McCartney said in the multimedia release \\u201cThe Beatles Anthology\\u201d that Ms. Cleave was one of the band\\u2019s go-to journalists. \\u201cMaureen was interesting and easy to talk to,\\u201d he said. Lennon, he added, \\u201cmade the unfortunate mistake of talking very freely because Maureen was someone we knew very well, to whom we would just talk straight from the shoulder.\\u201d\", \"Lennon\\u2019s line made it into The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations.\", \"The 1966 American tour, fraught with protests and the lingering fear of violence, was the Beatles\\u2019 last.\", \"Maureen Diana Cleave was born on Oct. 20, 1934, in India, which was part of the British Empire at the time.\", \"Her father, Maj. John Cleave, was a British officer stationed in India. Her mother, Isabella Mary Fraser Browne, was a homemaker. She had two sisters.\", \"Ms. Cleave attended high school in her mother\\u2019s native Ireland after the family returned there.\", \"After graduating from St. Anne\\u2019s College at Oxford in 1957, Ms. Cleave found a job at The Evening Standard as a secretary.\", \"An avid fan of pop music, she pitched a column on the subject to the paper\\u2019s editors. That idea became \\u201cDisc Date.\\u201d She traveled to Liverpool in 1963 to see the Beatles in person.\", \"She married Francis Nichols, an Oxford classmate, in 1966, and they later moved to his ancestral home at Lawford Hall in Essex. He died in 2015. Her survivors include their daughters, Dora and Sadie Nichols; their son, Bertie Nichols; and three grandchildren.\", \"After the Beatles broke up in 1970, Ms. Cleave continued covering the music scene for The Evening Standard. In a series of articles in the 1970s under the rubric \\u201cMaureen Cleave\\u2019s Guide to the Young,\\u201d she explained the hippie movement to Standard readers and explored the Hells Angels, among other topics.\", \"Ms. Cleave was diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis, also known as chronic fatigue syndrome, after collapsing on a London Underground platform in 1992. She documented her experience with the ailment in The Standard the next year. \\u201cThe medical profession lagged behind in M.E. awareness,\\u201d she wrote; \\u201cbecause there is no test, ergo it doesn\\u2019t exist.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cApart from having it, I knew little about it myself,\\u201d she added. She saw homeopathic doctors as well as traditional practitioners in an effort to manage her condition.\", \"Among the other topics she explored was women\\u2019s fitness. She also wrote profiles of painters, writers and philanthropists.\", \"But she also continued publishing reflections on her time with the Beatles. In 2005, she wrote a piece for The Daily Telegraph tied to what would have been John Lennon\\u2019s 65th birthday.\", \"\\u201cCharisma rarely survives the aging process,\\u201d she wrote, \\u201cbut, killed in the prime of life, Lennon remains a very powerful absence.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"eb83522a471611eca587435d8e257205"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eb83522a471611eca587435d8e257205"}},
