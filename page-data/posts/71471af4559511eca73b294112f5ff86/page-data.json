If the goal in making these false and unvetted accusations was to see Mr. Cuomo punished by CNN, that may explain his unwarranted termination.\\\"\", \"Cuomo's brother, former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, is under investigation for sexual assault allegations. Chris Cuomo allegedly tried to intervene and help his brother, which led to a suspension early last week and his eventual termination from CNN on Saturday.\", \"CNN issued this statement Saturday afternoon:\", \"\\\"Chris Cuomo was suspended earlier this week pending further evaluation of new information that came to light about his involvement with his brother's defense. We retained a respected law firm to conduct the review, and have terminated him, effective immediately. While in that process of that review, additional information has come to light. Despite the termination, we will investigate as appropriate.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945597/chris-cuomo.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Chris Cuomo visits SiriusXM Studios on June 18, 2019 in New York City. </div>\", \"Chris Cuomo issued a statement on Twitter following CNN's announcement.\", \"\\\"This is not how I want my time at CNN to end but I have already told you why and how I helped my brother. So let me now say as disappointing as this is, I could not be more proud of the team at Cuomo Prime Time and the work we did as CNN's #1 show in the most competitive time slow. I owe them all and will miss that group of special people who did really important work.\\\"\", \"Several people have alleged that Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed them, which led to the governor's abrupt resignation in August.
