She is truly one of our greatest ever sportspeople.\\\"\", \"Carrington embarked on an unprecedented challenge in Tokyo, contesting four different kayaking events at one Olympics.\", \"Beforehand she told RNZ that, in the end, her willingness to truly test the extent of her abilities was the deciding factor.\", \"\\\"I guess I kinda figured, if I can do it, why not try. No-one's done it and it's a big ask but why not take that opportunity and not play it too safe.\", \"\\\"That's what's exciting. It's about putting myself out there and doing the best I can.\\\"\", \"In the end she won three gold medals in the K1 200m, K1 500m and K2 500m (with Caitlin Regal) and was narrowly pipped for a fourth medal in the K4 event, with the crew finishing fourth in the final.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/271376/eight_col_lisa.jpg?1628123742\\\" alt=\\\"Lisa Carrington.

I think Gordy [Walker] was surprised, her coach was surprised that she won that 200. And from winning that gold medal in London in the 200, everyone was going, 'holy s..t, what has she just done?'\", \"\\\"Then they realised what this girl was capable of and it's taken two more Olympics for that young woman to become a New Zealand sports star to a world superstar. And I think she deserves that mantle, she's up there with Usain Bolt, she's up there with the Michael Phelps, she deserves that status.\\\"\", \"Dame Lisa hopes that her successes can inspire other Kiwis to \\\"believe and do things that they thought they never could've\\\".\", \"Her goal has always been simply to master her own talent and get better with each performance.\", \"\\\"For me to be able to achieve so highly, I guess is to not make it about the results, but for me to be able to do it, to reach more into myself to have reached that potential. It's just trying to be better than I was the day before.\\\"\", \"Coming into such intense competition on the world stage, Carrington said she still battles with nerves and fears - but has found ways to deal with it. Before a race, she faces down the fear by looking down the lane into the water and feeling grateful for the opportunity to compete.\", \"However, the chance to compete at the Olympics is the ultimate privilege, she said.\", \"\\\"Growing up to be an Olympian was the epitome of who you wanted to be. They represented so many good values and so I think for me something I thought I'd never be able to do.\", \"\\\"It's amazing.
