leading infectious diseases researcher says, after the state\\u2019s Chief Health Officer warned a \\\"peak\\\"\\u00a0of the virus could be just weeks away.\", \"Queensland yesterday confirmed another case of the highly infectious strain in hotel quarantine in a traveller from the United Kingdom but one which \\\"posed no risk to the community\\\".\", \"However, two other cases are suspected to be Omicron and are being treated as such until genomic sequencing can confirm the strain.\", \"Queensland Chief Health Officer John Gerrard said the strain would \\\"continue to spread\\\"\\u00a0as it was \\\"much more contagious than what we've seen previously with Delta\\\".\", \"\\\"It is very clear now that Omicron is very contagious \\u2014 the speed with which we will reach a peak is probably faster than we originally anticipated,\\\" Dr Gerrard said.\", \"\\\"I think we're talking more in the weeks than the months, from what we're seeing in New South Wales and the United Kingdom.\\\"\", \"Despite his warning, Dr Gerrard said Queensland Health's response towards COVID was not changing due to Omicron cases popping up.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Omicron will 'become the dominant strain'</div>\", \"Infectious diseases expert Nigel McMillan from Griffith University said he believed\\u00a0Omicron would \\\"become the dominant strain in Queensland \\u2026 over the next month\\\".\", \"But Professor McMillan said he did not think the public health response needed to change for the newest strain of concern.\", \"\\\"We've opened up, and how we're dealing with it, we know that new variants will come,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I just hope that government sticks to their guns in terms of keeping things open.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ae18a603c49c779606adcc79c31324c6\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Professor McMillan also said the mandate was not put in place to punish unvaccinated people.(ABC News: Liz Pickering)</div>\", \"He said concern surrounding Omicron was not necessarily about how \\\"infectious\\\"\\u00a0or \\\"transmissible\\\" the strain was.\", \"\\\"It's probably more around whether our vaccines will be effective,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We've got lab studies, and this is taking blood samples from people who have been vaccinated, and looking and mixing with the virus to see how much those antibodies will neutralise the virus.\", \"\\\"We know that it's about anywhere from 10-to-40 times less effective against Omicron compared to Delta.\\\"\", \"Professor McMillan said it was not yet known how those figures would translate outside of lab conditions as data was still being gathered about real world cases.\", \"\\\"While we can't exactly extrapolate from the test tube into humans, what we do know is that means that those higher levels of antibodies will be a bit more resistant, and that's why boosters are going to be important,\\\" he said.\", \"He said another factor that remains unknown was whether 90 per cent vaccinations would be enough to stave of the variant in Queensland.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Booster shot will give 'good protection'</div>\", \"Dr Gerrard also said vaccine boosters would offer better protection against Omicron to just being double dosed.\", \"\\\"When you get that third dose, you get a dramatic increase in your antibody levels, which will give you good protection against the Omicron strain,\\\" Dr Gerrard said.\", \"\\\"If your vaccination was greater than five months ago, then it's important that you get a booster.\\\"\", \"The TGA advice was initially to wait six months between the second and third dose, but that advice was changed earlier this week to be five months.\", \"Speaking in Brisbane yesterday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the advice around booster shots could change.\", \"\\\"That range may come down, we'll see what the medical advice is,\\\" he said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Vaccine mandate</div>\", \"A mandate banning people who were unvaccinated against COVID-19 from attending certain types of venues, including cafes, restaurants, nightclubs, stadiums and theme parks will take effect from Friday.\", \"Professor McMillan said with the deadline approaching, borders reopened, and Omicron in the state, there was an uptake in vaccines.\", \"\\\"In terms of the number of doses of boosters, we're kind of time-constrained in terms of who can get those, but certainly, we would expect to see more and more boosters being given out as time goes on.\\\"\", \"Professor McMillan also said the mandate was not put in place to punish unvaccinated people.\", \"\\\"People sort of say the unvaccinated people are being banned from certain places, but what they are being is protected,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"They don't see it that way \\u2014 at least some of them won't of course \\u2014 but it's actually about their health, not everyone else's.\\\"\", \"In recent days, there has been an uptake in vaccinations across Queensland with a record 62,409 jabs on Monday.\", \"\\\"On Monday, 13 December, 16,838 vaccine doses in total were administered at Queensland Health-run clinics \\u2014 of these, 7,224 were third doses,\\\" a statement from Queensland Health said.\"]","href_hash":"d3ecfb6a5de211ec835139dab13c59a0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d3ecfb6a5de211ec835139dab13c59a0"}},
