The league confirmed the incident through a video.\\u00a0\", \"The Barracudas said Hrabik was \\\"immediately removed from all team activities\\\" as the league investigated the incident.\\u00a0\", \"Arizona Coyotes President and CEO Xavier A. Gutierrez said Habrik's \\\"ignorance is astounding and unacceptable.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We are appalled by the disgusting and blatantly racist gesture that was displayed to Boko during the Roadrunners game at San Jose on Jan. 12 and support the AHL's action and suspension,\\\" Gutierrez said in a statement Friday. \\\"There is no place in society, or in our game, for racism or abuse of any kind.\\\"\", \"The Barracudas and San Jose Sharks organizations apologized for Habrik's actions.\", \"\\\"While we support the ability for individuals to atone and learn from disrespectful incidents in this context, these actions are in direct opposition to the Barracuda and Sharks organizations' values,\\\" the team said in a statement Friday.\\u00a0\", \"Statement from the San Jose Barracuda and San Jose Sharks Organizations pic.twitter.com/0lYaLuDbUl\", \"Hrabik will attend educational training on inclusion and antiracism with the National Hockey League's Player Inclusion Committee as part of his suspension, the AHL said.
