But that’s not stopping her.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-01T12:40:11.000Z","content":"[\"ATLANTA \\u2014 Tate Sequoyah Farris has never been shy about her music or her body. On an early October day in her hometown, Atlanta, the 24-year-old rapper was getting fitted for a music video for her song \\u201cDungarees,\\u201d dressed in snakeskin boxer shorts and a see-through halter top from Gucci. Her stylist, Todd White, was working alongside a seamstress, and a photographer buzzed around too, all of them like bees swarming their queen.\", \"\\u201cCan we make them shorter?\\u201d Ms. Farris asked. The shorts grazed her knees. Mr. White asked the seamstress to pin them at the middle of her thigh.\", \"Standing in front of a full-length mirror, Ms. Farris evaluated all five feet and one inch of herself. Her hair freshly braided in cornrows, with a heart braided on the left side of her head, her makeup \\u2014 a soft natural glam \\u2014 flawlessly done, Ms. Farris threw a few mock punches while twerking gently.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s giving baddie!\\u201d she said to the room as she danced with herself in the mirror.\", \"Ms. Farris, who performs under the name Baby Tate, released \\u201cI Am\\u201d last year. It\\u2019s an empowering track with a bunch of affirmations nestled in the chorus: \\u201cI am healthy, I am wealthy, I am rich,\\u201d the song starts off. \\u201cI am protected, well respected, I\\u2019m a queen, I\\u2019m a dream, I do what I want to do and I\\u2019m who I want to be,\\u201d the chorus ends.\", \"The lyrics serve as a mantra for Ms. Farris, even if she cannot always control what people say about her. In October, after a performance at Afropunk in Atlanta, she faced intense online criticism for the way her body looked in black leather boots and a belly-baring cougar-print outfit. She hadn\\u2019t intended to wear the exposed look, but her planned outfit didn\\u2019t pan out.Though she had had her doubts about showing so much of her body, she received compliments on her outfit from the audience.\", \"\\u201cOf all the festivals that I\\u2019ve performed at, Afropunk is one that I feel like, especially for Black people, you can be the most yourself,\\u201d Ms. Farris said. \\u201cEverybody is out there in so many different ranges of what Black and Afro punk looks like.\\u201d\", \"Several days later, however, as the images from the show made their way across the internet, comments turned from praise to disdain. One Twitter user said she \\u201ccould lose 10 pounds\\u201d and another said that she had \\u201cbad habits and poor discipline.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI come out with a two-inch protruding belly and it\\u2019s, \\u2018My God, she\\u2019s eating McDonald\\u2019s every day,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Farris said.\", \"Ms. Farris\\u2019s critics seemed to think she wasn\\u2019t living up to the standards of other musicians and influencers on Instagram. The so-called Instagram body, seen on rappers, reality stars and actresses, includes an extreme hourglass shape, a flat tummy, with voluptuous hips and buttocks.\", \"The physique can typically be achieved only through surgery, specifically procedures like the Brazilian butt lift, one of the most popular cosmetic surgeries, despite having the highest mortality rate for any cosmetic surgery, according to a 2017 report by the National Institutes of Health. In 2020, there were 21,823 buttock augmentations in the United States, which include implants or fat grafting, according to a report by the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.\", \"\\u201cSo many people have died and I feel like people don\\u2019t know that, they don\\u2019t care about that, especially the young girls that look up to all of us,\\u201d Ms. Farris said while pressing her fist in her hand, after her fitting. \\u201cThey see that, and they think: This is what I need to get.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Farris responded to the negative comments on social media by posting pictures of herself in bathing suits, with comments about her love for her natural body. She knows the pandemic \\u2014 which she refers to as the \\u201cpanorama\\u201d \\u2014 has affected her eating habits, but she doesn\\u2019t sweat it. She\\u2019s had a big year. After being independent for nearly seven years, she signed a record deal with Warner Records.\", \"She\\u2019s unfazed by the disapproval and wants to broaden the idea of what kinds of bodies are acceptable. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to love my body in whatever state it is in,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWhether I\\u2019m working out at the time, not working out, whether I\\u2019m eating pasta every day or I\\u2019m eating salad every day, it\\u2019s a journey. This is my vessel that I\\u2019m on this Earth with and so I got to carry it, and I\\u2019m going to continue to love it.\\u201d\", \"Mr. White, who did not style Ms. Farris for Afropunk, but has also styled Megan Thee Stallion, Latto and Summer Walker, said: \\u201cEveryone has their own style and idea of what they\\u2019re comfortable with, but for her, I think she\\u2019s just a little bit freer and more open.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think she\\u2019s scared to do anything,\\u201d he added.\", \"Ms. Farris turned the body shaming into positivity. In October, she asked her fans to post photos of themselves in their natural state, showing their natural bodies and natural hair. Many responded with photos and notes of solidarity and thankfulness. When she recalled the responses she received, Ms. Farris\\u2019s voice broke.\", \"\\u201cI already get emotional when people say that my music helped them get through any type of situation in their lives,\\u201d she said, her eyes welling. She dabbed her tears with her palm, to avoid disrupting her precise eyeliner. \\u201cTo see so many people and specifically Black women, see how I stood up for myself \\u2014 it made them feel like I stood up for them.\\u201d\", \"After she took to Twitter to defend herself, she received a direct message from Rihanna, one of her childhood idols. \", \"\\u201cI was really on the battlefield,\\u201d Ms. Farris said. \\u201cI was really out there like fending for myself, like I am right in the midst of it all, then here comes Rihanna.\\u201d\", \"She was already in negotiations to become an ambassador for Rihanna\\u2019s lingerie line, Savage x Fenty, she said, but their conversation accelerated the agreement. After her fitting for the \\u201cDungarees\\u201d video shoot, Ms. Farris started getting ready for her first Savage x Fenty photo shoot.\", \"To set the mood, she put on \\u201cLet It Show,\\u201d a song she had recorded the night before while on Instagram Live. Her bright voice rang out in the chorus over a bass-heavy beat from her iPhone speaker:\", \"\\u201cWhere my bad girls with a big belly?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c2ff5fd652a311ecb73d517cbe448943"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c2ff5fd652a311ecb73d517cbe448943"}},
