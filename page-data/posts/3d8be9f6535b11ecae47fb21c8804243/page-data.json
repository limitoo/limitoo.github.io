He had been working at an event venue and wanted to move to a larger apartment so she could have more privacy.\", \"That hope was put on hold when the pandemic hit New York and he was laid off, leaving him worried about paying for their basic needs. \\u201cIt was challenging,\\u201d Mr. Armand said.\", \"For him, though, after previous struggles with homelessness and with alcoholism, staying positive was key.\", \"\\u201cI do the best that I can with whatever I get, and I move on,\\u201d he said.\", \"The abrupt halt to Mr. Armand\\u2019s work in events was a setback that was difficult with his daughter, Chiara, under his care. Since she came to live with him in 2018, he had made it a priority to raise her with a positive mind-set and to help her build a solid foundation.\", \"\\u201cThree years later, I look at my daughter and I\\u2019m like, \\u2018Wow,\\u2019\\u201d said Mr. Armand, 65. \\u201cChiara is a very intelligent young lady.\\u201d\", \"His approach came from wanting her road to adulthood to be different from his. Mr. Armand moved to New York with his family from Colombia in 1971, and in 1976 he joined the Army. After serving for three years, he was honorably discharged, and he moved back to New York and then to California.\", \"Throughout his youth Mr. Armand struggled with alcoholism, and in California he got sober and began taking classes at the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising, first at its Irvine campus, which is now closed, and then at the Los Angeles campus. He graduated with an associate degree and moved back to New York, where he worked in the fashion industry and the events business.\", \"In 2004, Chiara was born, and Mr. Armand and Chiara\\u2019s mother separated not long after. Mr. Armand began to struggle financially, and was homeless for three years, before eventually moving to the studio apartment where he now lives with Chiara.\", \"Since being laid off last year, Mr. Armand has made ends meet through unemployment assistance and occasional bartending shifts. In September, he applied for Social Security benefits. But it was still difficult to cover the basics. So in October, Catholic Charities, a beneficiary agency of The Neediest Cases Fund, provided Mr. Armand with $1,000 to help him pay for his daughter\\u2019s braces, her school clothes and utility bills.\", \"Even though being open about financial struggles can be intimidating, Mr. Armand said that he encourages other parents to ask for assistance when they need it.\", \"\\u201cWe have to reach out and go and ask for help,\\u201d Mr. Armand said. \\u201cThere will be people that will help you.\\u201d\", \"As Chiara goes through her senior year of high school, he is helping her with college applications.\", \"\\u201cI think she is on the right path,\\u201d Mr. Armand said. \\u201cShe\\u2019s looking forward.\\u201d\", \"And Mr. Armand has begun designing his own lingerie brand, a business he has dreamed of since he was in college. He cites Kandinsky and Versace as some of his biggest influences.\", \"\\u201cDespite my age,\\u201d he said, \\u201cI\\u2019m not done yet.\\u201d\", \"Claudine Bradford also strives to be a role model and to support her daughter. Since she was 8, Ms. Bradford has raised her as a single parent and has taught her to strive for her goals.\", \"To keep the two of them going, Ms. Bradford, 47, often writes out positive affirmations that she posts around their Brooklyn home.\", \"Ms. Bradford\\u2019s desire to support her daughter, Jasmine Fischer, now 23, was especially strong during the pandemic. To help Ms. Fischer pay for college, Ms. Bradford began taking classes through the Grace Institute, an organization in New York that helps low-income women through job training and counseling services.\", \"\\u201cI decided to go back to work to make sure she\\u2019s OK, to make sure she can have a better future,\\u201d Ms. Bradford said.\", \"Because of various health issues, including diabetes, Ms. Bradford hadn\\u2019t worked since 2015 and has relied on cash assistance and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. But when her daughter told her that she was struggling to pay for college last year, Ms. Bradford wanted to find a way to help.\", \"While Ms. Bradford was taking her 10-week course, a social worker at the Grace Institute asked her about any barriers that might prevent her from completing the program. Ms. Bradford said that she was having trouble affording groceries that month, especially with Thanksgiving approaching.\", \"The Grace Institute helped connect Ms. Bradford with Community Service Society, another of the organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. In November 2020, the group provided Ms. Bradford with $174.51 in household goods and groceries, like rice and beans. She also was able to get ingredients for a Thanksgiving meal that featured candied yams she made from a special family recipe. \\u201cIt was wonderful,\\u201d Ms. Bradford said.\", \"In December 2020, Ms. Bradford graduated from the administrative professional program. And in August, she began working part-time as an enrollment specialist at the Borough of Manhattan Community College.\", \"Ms. Fischer is studying psychology at St. Francis College, and wants to start a nonprofit organization when she graduates. And Ms. Bradford is committed to making sure her daughter\\u2019s dreams come true.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s my goal, to work for her, to make sure her organization is up and running,\\u201d Ms. Bradford said. \\u201cI\\u2019m ready.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3d8be9f6535b11ecae47fb21c8804243"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3d8be9f6535b11ecae47fb21c8804243"}},
