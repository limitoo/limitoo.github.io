They spoke on condition of anonymity because the N.H.L. and its players\\u2019 union had not publicly disclosed their intentions, even as they had telegraphed them for weeks.\", \"The N.H.L., which has had dozens of its games postponed this season, said on Monday that it would pause its season for several days after a swelling number of players were ruled out of games after entering the league\\u2019s health and safety protocols.\", \"The decision that N.H.L. players would not go to Beijing, however, reflected spiraling concerns among the league, its teams and their players about the possible effects of the pandemic on the rest of the season. The N.H.L.\\u2019s retreat came only weeks before the Games\\u2019s opening ceremony on Feb. 4, and less than four months after the league announced a plan to load the men\\u2019s tournament rosters in Beijing with the sport\\u2019s biggest stars.\", \"The decision could give the league additional flexibility as it tries to reschedule games even as it braces for more postponements, since a three-week break planned to accommodate the Games can now potentially be used to make up N.H.L. postponements instead.\", \"But the absence of the sport\\u2019s best players will undercut the dazzle of the Olympic tournament, which now will most likely feature minor leaguers and overseas-based professionals instead of commanding figures like the N.H.L. All-Stars Auston Matthews and Connor McDavid.\", \"Organizers of the Beijing Olympics have vowed that the festivities will proceed as planned, but the N.H.L.\\u2019s decision to opt out injected a new burst of uncertainty into the Games.\"]","href_hash":"209e880662f811ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"209e880662f811ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
