In Bolton's final report, obtained by CBS News, his office revealed that out of 104 recommendations, only 30 had been fully implemented. \\u00a0\", \"Manger said the department is in the process of addressing most of the remaining recommendations. He said training continues to be an area in need of \\\"significant improvement.\\\"\", \"\\\"It's a difficult challenge right now because we're so short-staffed that some of the things that we could do in terms of training can't be done because we can't free up officers from their duties to address some of the training needs, \\\" Manger said.\\u00a0\", \"About 130 officers have left the force since January 6, a spokesman for the department told CBS News last month. Manger said he wants to hire 400 additional sworn officers total, and the department has a plan in place to hire about 280 this year. Bolton cautioned that efforts to increase hiring would not be a quick fix because training new recruits takes about a year. \\u00a0\", \"To investigate threats more efficiently, Manger said the department has opened two field offices in Florida and California, the two states where the department has the most cases. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's paid off in terms of some of the cases that we've had to look into,\\\" Manger said.\\u00a0\", \"Yet, officials tell CBS News threats are up because temperatures are running high when it comes to the country's political discourse. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"It remains to be seen if it just keeps increasing at the level that it has increased,\\\" Manger said. \\\"Or do we as a country get to a point where enough people say 'enough is enough, you know, this is not good for our nation to have this level of vitriol.'\\\"\\u00a0\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"71f65e0a6c8411ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"71f65e0a6c8411ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
