On set, he is the new one. His lifetime Gucci tab, eternal devotion to sweater vests or even when he will appear on set again can all be points of discussion for dissection, roasts and jokes.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of like being a rookie your first game,\\u201d Gretzky said of his first night in studio. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want to make any mistakes. So, I just felt like I\\u2019m going to follow their lead and I\\u2019m going to be the guy that kind of plays off of them.\\u201d\", \"Carter, the veteran analyst who played 10 years in the N.H.L., offered Gretzky some advice after one of their first tapings. \\u201cDo you ever go into a game saying, \\u2018I only want one point tonight and I\\u2019m going to take it easy?\\u2019 or do you go in thinking, I\\u2019m a savage. I\\u2019m getting five or six points?\\u201d\", \"Turner Sports\\u2019 exploration into hockey remains in the early stages after WarnerMedia reached a $1.575 billion, seven-year deal to split the television rights for the N.H.L. with ESPN following NBC Sports\\u2019 longtime run as the national carrier in the United States. The networks are making a large and lucrative bet that fans will continue to watch live professional sports and that hockey remains an untapped source of interest in the U.S. Turner Sports holds the rights to televise up to 72 national games each season of the agreement, including the annual Winter Classic around New Year\\u2019s Day, half the playoffs and every other Stanley Cup finals starting in 2023.\", \"For Craig Barry, the executive vice president and chief content officer for Turner Sports, the network\\u2019s first priority is not necessarily growing the audience. They know the devoted hockey fan will tune in. The goal is to expand and improve the experience of watching the sport by using smart technology, showing different points of access, and presenting the game more authentically \\u2014 like faster, sharper cuts and better camera angles \\u2014 similar to how it is presented on television in Canada.\", \"The network is aiming for hockey and culture to intersect inside the studio show where the analysts Carter, Gretzky, Rick Tocchet and Paul Bissonnette join the host Liam McHugh. Convincing Gretzky, arguably the game\\u2019s most celebrated player, to join was no small feat. Gretzky said his family had recently relocated to Missouri from California, which made taking regular treks to Atlanta more manageable.\", \"\\u201cI had a tremendous scenario in Edmonton where I was with the Oilers for the last few years and loved every minute of it, and really didn\\u2019t have the stress and pressure of being in the trenches every day,\\u201d said Gretzky, who had been a partner and vice chairman for the Oilers before resigning in May. \\u201cAnd so when this came along, it\\u2019s an opportunity to still be around the game. And I watched every game every night for years. It\\u2019s been fun and exciting and yeah, I can see myself doing it for a while.\\u201d\", \"The easy formula for Turner to replicate would be its popular \\u201cInside the NBA\\u201d studio show, shot in nearby Studio J. But the personalities of Charles Barkley, Ernie Johnson, Shaquille O\\u2019Neal and Kenny Smith have been syncing for years.\", \"The N.H.L. staff is attempting to create a show that can stand on its own with a chemistry felt from the beginning, thanks in large part to Tara August, the vice president of talent relations at Turner Sports, charged with putting together the crew in a few short months.\", \"On a recent night, the staff looked to congratulate Tocchet on his recent induction into the Philadelphia Flyers\\u2019 Hall of Fame. First, David Gibson, the producer, shared a statistic he had unearthed during the show\\u2019s production meeting among a couple dozen staff members.\", \"\\u201cAll-time leading penalty minutes for Philly,\\u201d Gibson said. \\u201cSomething to be proud of. A lot of bullies over the years.\\u201d\", \"Someone asked if any partitions used as a precaution against Covid-19 remained in the studios so a makeshift penalty box could surround Tocchet on air during the segment. Laughter ensued, a plan hatched, and less than two hours later, a surprised and game Tocchet found himself enclosed in plexiglass throughout most of the show.\", \"McHugh, a former NBC Sports host and the only member of the on-air crew present for the production meeting, quickly agreed to the bit. As the host, he steers the topics, while allowing the analysts to react on the spot.\", \"\\u201cBasically, there\\u2019s a lesson for kids here,\\u2019 McHugh joked. \\u201cDon\\u2019t prep and you too, can be on national TV.\\u201d\", \"For more serious topics, he will offer a heads up on points of discussion. Already, the crew has covered heavier notes like the racist taunt aimed at Jalen Smereck, a Black player, during a game in the Ukrainian Hockey League, the overdose death of the former N.H.L. player Jimmy Hayes and the allegations of sexual assault brought by Kyle Beach while he played for the Chicago Blackhawks.\", \"Before Tocchet was introduced to his homemade penalty box, the on-air talent, minus Gretzky, met to discuss their performance to date.\", \"Bissonnette, a former enforcer who hosts a popular podcast, \\u201cSpittin\\u2019 Chiclets\\u201d on Barstool Sports, recalled Carter addressing the Beach allegations.\", \"\\u201cAnd when it comes to maybe a guy who doesn\\u2019t play much and fills up water bottles, maybe I can comment on that,\\u201d Bissonnette said. \\u201cI look at that like that guy\\u2019s stepping up for the team because we had to tackle that and we didn\\u2019t really have to follow it up. And then we moved on and then got to talking about hockey because that\\u2019s actually what we want to do, right? It was unfortunate that we had to talk about it, but we don\\u2019t want to shy away from those things.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYeah, but it was no different, Biz, than you talking about Jimmy Hayes,\\u201d Carter said.\", \"Even Gibson, the producer, does not know all that will transpire. Bissonnette is the show\\u2019s wild card.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s that slight pause in what you\\u2019re going to say because you have to put it through the filter; whereas if it\\u2019s like on the podcast, if it slips out, you can always edit it out or you can actually drop an F bomb here and there,\\u201d he said.\", \"To Gibson and everyone\\u2019s surprise, Bissonnette recently dropped an expletive on live television.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s bad, especially for TNT,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m sure much worse has been said.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWell, it was one of those, I was grinning at you because it\\u2019s, well the sentiments, I totally agree with but \\u2026\\u201d McHugh said.\", \"Bissonnette interrupted: \\u201cYou must not listen to the podcast enough because there\\u2019s a lot worse being said on there.\\u201d\", \"Which brought the group back to the absent Gretzky.\", \"\\u201cGretzky came out, he\\u2019s the greatest player in the world but Gretzky got chirped first show,\\u201d McHugh said.\", \"\\u201cRight away,\\u201d Bissonnette said. \\u201cEveryone licking their chops. Couldn\\u2019t wait.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYou didn\\u2019t expect like a counterpunch,\\u201d McHugh said. \\u201cGretzky hit everybody. He\\u2019s like a sneaky assassin.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s Wayne\\u2019s personality though,\\u201d Tocchet said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve coached with him, I played with him. Everyone\\u2019s scared of him. So, you\\u2019re in the locker room for a game and he\\u2019ll always wanted some guy to chirp him.\\u201d\", \"Gretzky, scheduled for a limited number of on-air appearances, immediately worked to fit in with the team. Before the season, McHugh received a call out the blue. His eyes lit up and his wife asked him who the caller was. \\u201cIt was Wayne Gretzky,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHe was recommending an eye doctor.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe wants to provide entertainment for the hockey world,\\u201d Bissonnette said. \\u201cI think he feels indebted to it for what it\\u2019s provided him. I know if I was him, I\\u2019d probably be on a beach somewhere and you\\u2019d never see me.\\u201d\", \"Gretzky plans to return to the show at the Winter Classic and be involved in the playoff run. Turner Sports is researching ways to use Gretzky\\u2019s expertise with new technology. And the network is hoping that an eager hockey audience will watch on Wednesday nights and, in the spring, Sunday afternoons.\", \"\\u201cSometimes you can be focused on what you\\u2019re doing in your job and tackling serious issues or just focused on hockey, hockey, hockey,\\u201d Carter said. \\u201cBut the lines of entertainment and sports, I think here, are just so blurred that, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018What\\u2019s entertainment and what sports?\\u2019 We\\u2019re trying to mesh both together. And I think it\\u2019s worked pretty well so far.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c80ecdc1543511ecaaa77302a907c559"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c80ecdc1543511ecaaa77302a907c559"}},
