Conservatives shocked political analysts by wholly embracing a polarizing bill that just before the election the majority had vehemently opposed. Some Conservatives even hugged members of the opposition after they unanimously voted yes.\", \"Before the election, the Conservative opposition had turned a bill banning conversion therapy, the discredited practice that aims to change a person\\u2019s sexual orientation or gender expression, into one of the most contentious pieces of legislation in Parliament. Sixty-two Conservatives voted against it, while Erin O\\u2019Toole, the party leader, and 50 other Conservatives voted in favor.\", \"The legislation died when Parliament was dissolved with the election call in August. But this week the government tried again and introduced a new bill with a few additional protections to prevent attempts at conversion therapy.\", \"Then came the unexpected twist. Rob Moore, a Conservative from New Brunswick, rose on Wednesday afternoon and proposed a motion to fast track the bill and send it directly to the Senate.\", \"\\u201cI was completely taken by surprise when this happened,\\u201d Jonathan Malloy, a professor of political science at Carleton University in Ottawa, told me. \\u201cThis was something that the House previously divided on and that we expected it would again divide on \\u2014 and then it didn\\u2019t.\\u201d\", \"Exactly what went on within the Conservative caucus before Mr. Moore presented his motion is not public. But Professor Malloy said that the rare moment of parliamentary unity that followed it may mark an important point in Mr. O\\u2019Toole\\u2019s political career.\", \"At moments during the election and afterward, Mr. O\\u2019Toole has struggled to square his positions on questions like L.G.B.T.Q. rights with those of his party\\u2019s social conservatives. That has led to some policy reversals and compromises that pleased neither social conservatives within the party nor people who might consider voting Conservative but who are not social conservatives. Recently Mr. O\\u2019Toole has come under criticism for personally favoring vaccination but refusing to endorse mandatory vaccination, even for his party\\u2019s members in Parliament.\", \"Another protracted fight over the conversion therapy legislation, Professor Malloy said, would have allowed the Liberals to suggest to voters that whatever Mr. O\\u2019Toole\\u2019s personal positions, the Conservatives are guided by the socially conservative wing of their party.\", \"\\u201cFor him to apparently get some sort of agreement within the party, this is quite something,\\u201d Professor Malloy said.\", \"There\\u2019s no guarantee that the conversion therapy bill\\u2019s swift trip through the House of Commons will be repeated in the Senate. Mr. O\\u2019Toole\\u2019s influence over Conservative senators is uncertain. Last month, Mr. O\\u2019Toole removed Denise Batters, a senator from Saskatchewan, from the Conservative national caucus after she started a petition to remove him as party leader. But the party\\u2019s Senate caucus defied Mr. O\\u2019Toole, and Ms. Batters continues to sit as a Conservative. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\\u2019s decision not to allow anyone to sit as a Liberal in the Senate leaves his party without a formal voice in the Senate, presenting another potential obstacle for the legislation.\", \"And the House of Commons\\u2019 \\u201cfantastic day, \\u201d as David Lametti, the justice minister, described it, is unlikely to reflect the tone of the rest of this Parliament. Just before this session opened, Mr. O\\u2019Toole named Pierre Poilievre, the Conservative\\u2019s most rhetorically combative member, as the party\\u2019s finance critic.\", \"Conservatives have also defined inflation and the growth of the federal deficit because of pandemic support spending as their key attack points against the Liberals, which means fans of an overheated Parliament and partisan speechmaking are unlikely to be disappointed.\", \"A native of Windsor, Ontario, Ian Austen was educated in Toronto, lives in Ottawa and has reported about Canada for The New York Times for the past 16 years.
