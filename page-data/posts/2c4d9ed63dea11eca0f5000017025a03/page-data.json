They then compared each person's age of death to the average life expectancy of men and women in each country. The researchers used each country's life expectancy, as established between 2005 and 2019, as the benchmark.\", \"In short, researchers subtracted the ages of deceased people from what their life expectancy might've been had they not died of COVID-19. By doing this, they calculated an estimate of the years of life lost (YLL) for each country.\", \"Researchers estimated 4,350 YLL for every 100,000 people in the United States. Because the U.S. population is roughly 329.5 million, that means that the U.S. lost over 14 million years of life due to COVID-19.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926722/covid-19-years-life-lost-study-us-america.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">COVID-19 has taken over 14 million years of life from Americans who died from the virus, according to a new study from the University of Oxford in England.

The government then opened up 600 national testing centers and drive-through testing spots to ensure that hospitals wouldn't be overwhelmed with unaware patients experiencing symptoms.\", \"When a citizen tested positive for COVID-19, the government sent out a text message urging people to visit a website that showed the travel routes and places that person had visited. Using security camera footage and credit card numbers, the government then contacted anyone who might have crossed paths with the infected individual\\u2014a trade-off between privacy and public health that most citizens seemed to accept as a price of navigating an epidemic.\"]","href_hash":"2c4d9ed63dea11eca0f5000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2c4d9ed63dea11eca0f5000017025a03"}},
