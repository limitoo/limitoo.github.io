There\\u2019s nothing about his childhood as a gay kid in 1950s Australia, and only perfunctory mentions of his managing Eric Clapton, or producing the original Broadway stagings of \\u201cJesus Christ Superstar\\u201d and \\u201cEvita.\\u201d\", \"His association with the Bee Gees earns more attention but that\\u2019s because they were an integral part of \\u201cSaturday Night Fever\\u201d \\u2014 the focus of much of \\u201cMr. Saturday Night\\u201d and arguably Stigwood\\u2019s greatest achievement as a producer. (The new documentary works best as an addendum to the Frank Marshall film \\u201cThe Bee Gees: How Can You Mend a Broken Heart.\\u201d)\", \"Most of the time, the director John Maggio covers familiar territory: a quick primer on disco, Stigwood optioning the writer Nik Cohn\\u2019s article about the nightlife scene in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Bay Ridge, and how John Travolta found his groove, with help from the dance coach Deney Terrio.\", \"But even in what it does cover, the doc feels rushed and skimpy, relying mostly on testimonies from former executives of the entrepreneur\\u2019s company while the stars he worked with remain conspicuously absent.\", \"Stigwood also scored with the movie \\u201cGrease,\\u201d and then it was all over: He got caught in the disco backlash, lost his golden touch. Maggio ends his story in the early 1980s, even though Stigwood lived until 2016. He is thinking small about a man who used to dream big.\"]","href_hash":"e308ed6458e911ec860041a44871c280"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e308ed6458e911ec860041a44871c280"}},
