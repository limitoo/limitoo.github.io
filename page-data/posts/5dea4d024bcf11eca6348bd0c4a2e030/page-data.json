has\\u00a0long been thought that the majestic and peaceful southern right whale headed\\u00a0south to Antarctica after\\u00a0frequenting Australia's\\u00a0coast and the Auckland Islands south of New Zealand each winter.\", \"But is that where they really go?\", \"Until now, the whales' movements\\u00a0away from the breeding grounds have\\u00a0largely been a guessing game.\", \"A two-year international research project, called Tohora Voyages, tagged six New Zealand southern right whales (Eubalaena australis) in 2020 and\\u00a011 more this August, to help assess the impact of climate change on the species.\", \"The results have been myth-busting.\", \"Almost all the whales headed west from New Zealand to the south of the Head of the Bight in South Australia, with some travelling even further to Western Australia and beyond, instead of the expected east and south route.\\u00a0\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f0c292028d0bf3ebee77d33b1025e0a0\\\"

captured the hearts of New Zealanders who follow their migration almost daily online\\u00a0and helped contribute five of the satellite tags through crowdfunding coordinated by marine conservation group Ocean Live.\", \"One of the whales tagged last year, nicknamed Bill Wiremu, was tracked for more than a year providing the most comprehensive data collected on a southern right whale in the world.\", \"Team Tohora, led by New Zealand scientist\\u00a0Emma Carroll, is using genomics, stable isotopes, satellite tracking and habitat modelling to assess the recovery of the whale population and the impact of climate change.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a50dab9d474fb10e7d63b9d3e5d79691\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Lead

now number more than 2000.\", \"There have been other tagging programs in the past, but the technology and techniques have improved to now provide quality data and the tags are staying on the whales longer.\", \"An earlier project by the South Australian Research and Development Institute at the Head of the Bight tagged nine whales but data\\u00a0was only collected from three tags, also showing movement west and south in line with the New Zealand results.\", \"\\\"It's been fantastic to see the Aotearoa New Zealand whales voyaging so far and using so much of the Southern Ocean \\u2014 they're travelling further than we ever expected,\\\" Dr Carroll said.\", \"\\\"It's also a positive that they seem to be feeding both south of Australia and along the coast of Antarctica \\u2014 it could give the population resilience as, if one area has less prey, potentially the other area will have plenty of food.\\\"\", \"<img

on, and how that will impact on their recovery within that climate change context,\\\" Dr\\u00a0Andrews-Goff said.\", \"She said Bill Wiremu's movement was an exciting development.\", \"\\\"And so that in itself is surprising.\", \"\\\"Originally we had thought that we get some movements east but it just hasn't happened \\u2014 they've moved west and south.\\\"\", \"Data from the satellite tags

Andrews-Goff said drone monitoring was also helpful.\", \"\\\"They flew drones above the southern right whales to look at body condition, but also to use the imagery as\\u00a0a proxy to see what kind
