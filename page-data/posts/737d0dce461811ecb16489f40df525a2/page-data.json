It also abandons a proposal by Kaiser to pay new workers significantly less than current workers, which many had cited as a source of frustration that led to the planned strike.\", \"Hal Ruddick, the executive director of the labor coalition representing Kaiser employees, the Alliance of Health Care Unions, said in a statement, \\u201cThis contract protects our patients, provides safe staffing, and guarantees fair wages and benefits for every Alliance member.\\u201d\", \"Christian Meisner, a human resources official at Kaiser, said in a statement that the negotiations were \\u201cchallenging\\u201d but that the agreement \\u201cunderscores our unwavering commitment to our employees by maintaining industry-leading wages and benefits.\\u201d\", \"The agreement would cover a range of employees including nurses, pharmacy workers, physician assistants and nurse practitioners and must still be ratified by union members.\", \"A union spokesman said that the vote would take place over the next few weeks and that employees would continue to work their scheduled shifts during that time. Neither Kaiser nor the unions provided many details of the tentative deal.\", \"Before the agreement was reached, employees had said they were taken aback that Kaiser had offered them smaller wage increases than under their previous contract and that it had sought to reduce wages for future workers. They said they felt betrayed that the company would make such an offer amid the stress of the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cWe did unimaginable things, put ourselves in harm\\u2019s way, worked long hours, took things home to our families,\\u201d Kimberly Mullen, a registered nurse at a Kaiser facility in Southern California, said in an interview before the agreement. \\u201cIt was very insulting after a pandemic. We were all feeling \\u2014 I don\\u2019t know any other word \\u2014 backstabbed.\\u201d\", \"The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about its wage offers but has previously said that it was trying to rein in the cost of health care and that Kaiser employees in some markets are paid a significant premium above comparable workers in their areas. The unions have disputed the company\\u2019s methodology for making this determination.\", \"Ms. Mullen said in a text on Saturday that she was relieved that so many workers would not have to strike, but, \\u201cI am still holding some disappointment and animosity to the upper leadership of Kaiser Permanente.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"737d0dce461811ecb16489f40df525a2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"737d0dce461811ecb16489f40df525a2"}},
