Step inside, though, and an ersatz New York City full of singing orphans comes to life.\", \"A silver Manhattan skyline fills the background of a brightly lit sound stage, complete with miniature versions of the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building, and a set of elevated train tracks that rise up and stretch out toward seats that will soon be filled with spectators. The Tony Award-winning choreographer Sergio Trujillo (\\u201cAin\\u2019t Too Proud,\\u201d \\u201cMemphis\\u201d) instructs a group of ensemble members \\u2014 a hot dog vendor and a newspaper boy among them \\u2014 while nearby, an army of crew members rolls four enormous \\u201cmarble\\u201d pillars into place within Oliver Warbucks\\u2019s imposing mansion.\", \"It is here that \\u201cAnne Live!\\u201d will unfold on Thursday night, with an array of eight cameras capturing the action for broadcast on NBC. (West Coast viewers will watch a delayed airing; the show will be available to stream Friday on Peacock.)\", \"Directed for the stage by Lear deBessonet, the artistic director for City Center\\u2019s Encores! series, and for television by Alex Rudzinski, the production is the latest offering within the live TV musical trend NBC kicked off with \\u201cThe Sound of Music Live!\\u201d in 2013. In the time since, NBC and other networks have produced a string of widely watched theatrical spectacles for TV, both beloved (NBC\\u2019s \\u201cThe Wiz Live!\\u201d in 2015, Fox\\u2019s \\u201cGrease Live!\\u201d in 2016) and less so (NBC\\u2019s \\u201cPeter Pan Live!\\u201d in 2014), along with several hybrid specials (NBC\\u2019s \\u201cJesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert\\u201d in 2018) and live-to-tape copycats. (NBC's most recent TV musical, \\u201cDr. Seuss\\u2019 The Grinch Musical Live!\\u201d last year, was prerecorded in London\\u2019s Troubadour Theater.)\", \"But while the formula is well-established at this point, the creators see a particular timeliness in this musical\\u2019s hopeful message after a rough couple of years and as the Omicron variant renews Covid anxieties.\", \"\\u201cWhat makes this different is that it seems to have come at a right time, where the messages of \\u2018Annie,\\u2019 I think, resonate a lot more,\\u201d said Neil Meron, who has produced all of NBC\\u2019s recent live musicals, teaming with Robert Greenblatt for this one. \\u201cBecause it\\u2019s all about optimism, and it\\u2019s about how one young girl can change things and just open things up again \\u2014 opening emotions, opening hearts. And I think we crave that now.\\u201d\", \"With its diverse cast, including Taraji P. Henson as Miss Agatha Hannigan and Celina Smith in the title role, \\u201cAnnie\\u201d also offers an updated ode to family, couched within a 45-year-old musical.\", \"In 1997, Meron executive produced the made-for-TV movie \\u201cCinderella,\\u201d based on the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical and starring Brandy in the title role and Whitney Houston as the Fairy Godmother. That special was a pop culture landmark, particularly for viewers of color, and Meron hopes \\u201cAnnie Live!\\u201d might mean something similar to a new generation.\", \"\\u201cThe idea of doing \\u2018Annie\\u2019 right now, with as diverse a cast as we have, I think could even be more resoundingly emotional, especially for the Black community,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAt least I hope so. Because these are classic roles, and they\\u2019re being portrayed by the best of the best.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t want to hit people over the head with resonance,\\u201d he added. \\u201cWe just are portraying it, and people will take that; people are smart enough to understand what we\\u2019re doing without underlining it.\\u201d\", \"The \\u201cAnnie Live!\\u201d production, which includes 43 cast members, including a dog named Sandy who, conveniently, will play Sandy the dog, has been in rehearsals since mid-October. (A total of more than 350 people work on the show, including the crew and staff.) When the show goes on Thursday night, it will be before a live audience of just under 500 people \\u2014 proof of full vaccination is required and audience members will wear masks for the entirety of the show.\", \"(NBC said the entire company was fully vaccinated, including Jane Krakowski, who was originally set to play Lily St. Regis but had to leave the production after getting a breakthrough case of Covid. She was replaced by Megan Hilty.)\", \"\\u201cAnnie\\u201d has never been far from the cultural radar since the musical made its Broadway debut in 1977. (The play was based on Harold Gray\\u2019s long-running comic strip \\u201cLittle Orphan Annie,\\u201d which debuted in 1924 and was itself inspired by a 19th century poem by James Whitcomb Riley.) John Huston\\u2019s 1982 movie adaptation, with Aileen Quinn, Carol Burnett, Ann Reinking and Albert Finney, remains definitive for many. Smith, the current Annie, is partial to the 2014 movie starring Quvenzhan\\u00e9 Wallis (\\u201cBeasts of the Southern Wild\\u201d) \\u2014 she hopes to be for other young viewers what Wallis was for her.\", \"\\u201cI want to be able to be that role model for young Black girls,\\u201d Smith, 12, said in a phone interview. \\u201cThey can say, \\u2018Maybe I could do what she\\u2019s doing right now; maybe I could act.\\u2019 Because you know, we can do whatever we put our minds to.\\u201d\", \"In conversation, Smith modulates between professional poise and bursts of preteen laughter. When asked whether her family would be watching from home in Atlanta or among the live audience, Smith giggled. \\u201cOn set \\u2014 I mean, I\\u2019m a minor.\\u201d (She and the production\\u2019s other young actors keep up with school work by attending lessons with teachers on set.)\", \"Smith has starred in Tyler Perry\\u2019s \\u201cYoung Dylan,\\u201d on Nickelodeon, and in the national theatrical tour of \\u201cThe Lion King,\\u201d and she sees a through line between the plucky characters she has already played and her current one. \\u201cThey all have so much in common because they\\u2019re all so optimistic about everything,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnnie is like, \\u2018If this doesn\\u2019t happen, I\\u2019m just going to try again.\\u2019 Again and again and again.\\u201d\", \"A similar persistence has characterized NBC\\u2019s approach to live musicals since Meron and his producing partner Craig Zadan, who died in 2018, pitched \\u201cThe Sound of Music Live!\\u201d to Greenblatt, then chairman of the network.\", \"Back then, Greenblatt had been looking for ways to put NBC \\u201cback on the map,\\u201d the former chairman said in a phone interview.\", \"\\u201cAnd lo and behold, \\u2018Sound of Music\\u2019 was that monstrous rating of 18 million people who watched it live,\\u201d Greenblatt said. \\u201cPeople don\\u2019t watch television live like that unless it\\u2019s NBC\\u2019s football games or the Olympics, or an occasional big event.\\u201d\", \"The ratings for live musicals have not reached that level since, though that hasn\\u2019t been from a lack of star power. (Think: John Legend and Sara Bareilles in \\u201cJesus Christ Superstar Live in Concert\\u201d or Kristin Chenoweth and Ariana Grande in \\u201cHairspray Live!\\u201d) In addition to Henson and Smith, the \\u201cAnnie Live!\\u201d main cast includes Harry Connick Jr. as Daddy Warbucks and Nicole Scherzinger, the Pussycat Dolls lead singer, as Grace Farrell. The fact that three women of color play the female leads this year thrills Henson.\", \"\\u201cWhen I went to Howard University, which was an H.B.C.U., we got to play any character,\\u201d she said in a phone interview. \\u201cThat\\u2019s how I trained: I was used to playing any character I wanted to.\\u201d\", \"Henson studied drama at Howard and has appeared in productions of \\u201cJoe Turner\\u2019s Come and Gone\\u201d and \\u201cAbove the Fold,\\u201d among others. \\u201cThat was before Cookie,\\u201d she said, referring to her star turn on the Fox hit \\u201cEmpire.\\u201d \\u201cThat\\u2019s where I thrive: on the stage.\\u201d\", \"Scherzinger is similarly returning to her roots: Best known as a pop singer, she attended a performing arts high school, studied theater in college and has performed in a Hollywood Bowl production of \\u201cRent\\u201d and in a London-based production of \\u201cCats.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cPreparing for the stage or West End or Broadway, you have many nights to work through,\\u201d she said in a phone interview. \\u201cWe get this one shot to do it live.\\u201d\", \"Both Scherzinger, who is Hawaiian and Filipina, and Henson, who is Black, remarked that, growing up, they either never saw themselves in these roles, or wouldn\\u2019t have been able to get them.\", \"Connick wrote new lyrics to accompany a reprise of the song \\u201cMaybe\\u201d that spoke to the contemporary casting. A couple claiming to be Annie\\u2019s biological parents (played by Hilty and Tituss Burgess) arrives to take her away.\", \"\\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s fair,\\u201d Connick sings as Warbucks. \\u201cSome would agree. Maybe it\\u2019s just the way it should be: A mom and a dad and Annie makes three. I hope you don\\u2019t forget about me.\\u201d\", \"In a phone interview, Connick said the addition is \\u201ca nod to nontraditional families.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis would be this single white man with this young Black girl, potentially marrying, in this particular case, this Asian woman that I\\u2019m in love with,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThis entire production is a nod to the idea that things can be interpreted just as beautifully in nontraditional ways.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b284d68652dc11ec92eaa5b254993841"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b284d68652dc11ec92eaa5b254993841"}},
