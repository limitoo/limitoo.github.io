In his obituaries in The Times and The Post, you can read stories of his dogged reporting, defense of free speech and human rights, and superb editorial leadership.\", \"Fred approached reporting and editorial writing with a disciplined and inquisitive mind and a surfeit of energy. The editorial department he leaves behind is far larger and more diverse than the small team of editorial writers he began with when he took the job in 2000. Even as the opinion side of The Post and other major newspapers expanded, Fred never wavered in his duty to speak truth to power, whether it was in the hands of Vladimir Putin or Donald Trump.\", \"When Washington\\u2019s hometown paper centers free speech and human rights in the national conversation, it has important ripple effects at home and abroad. Fred\\u2019s advocacy on behalf of the First Amendment and justice, with Jamal Khashoggi\\u2019s murder and in general, was his guiding light and his lasting legacy.\", \"When I stepped into my current position at The Times a year and a half ago, Fred reached out; he was among the first people to congratulate me. From our conversation, I was expecting wise counsel and serious mentorship, which did come, but not before he spent half an hour trying to make me laugh with tales of ornery writers. \\u201cWhen was the last time somebody reminded you how fun our jobs can be?\\u201d he asked. After that, he\\u2019d call from time to time to ask if I was having enough fun. That dose of perspective meant so much to me.\", \"As his family, friends and colleagues at The Washington Post celebrate his life and career, I will remember him as well for his quiet, unassuming and humorous way of being.\"]","href_hash":"57fcb2005aa311ec8a719d71e16e0fd6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"57fcb2005aa311ec8a719d71e16e0fd6"}},
