With the Bills trailing by 5, Allen led a 17-play, 75-yard drive that ended with his 27-yard touchdown pass to Gabriel Davis. A successful 2-point conversion, on a pass to Stefon Diggs, gave Buffalo a 3-point lead with just under two minutes left in the fourth quarter.\", \"Among the weapons at Mahomes\\u2019s disposal is arguably the fastest player in the N.F.L., receiver Tyreek Hill. When Hill caught a pass and sped into the end zone for a 64-yard touchdown, Kansas City regained the lead with 1:02 to go.\", \"On the ensuing possession, Allen took control, attacking through the air and connecting with Davis again for a 19-yard touchdown pass. It was Davis\\u2019s fourth receiving touchdown of the night, a playoff record, and the Bills looked as if they had won the game with 13 seconds left.\", \"Buffalo kicked off into the end zone for a touchback, giving Mahomes 13 seconds to try to drive downfield. As it turned out, 13 seconds was all he needed. He guided Kansas City into field-goal range in two plays, with Travis Kelce\\u2019s 25-yard catch setting up Harrison Butker\\u2019s 49-yard field goal to force overtime.\", \"Kansas City won the coin toss and got the ball first in overtime. On Kansas City\\u2019s eighth play of the drive, Mahomes hit Kelce again for the winning score, sending Kansas City to the A.F.C. Championship game. Allen never got a chance to respond.\", \"It was a perfect finish to a wild playoff weekend in which the first three games were decided by last-second field goals. It was the first playoff weekend in N.F.L. history with four games decided on the final play, according to Elias Sports Bureau.\"]","href_hash":"5267de847f5711ecbc1bc34b7b86a4ee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5267de847f5711ecbc1bc34b7b86a4ee"}},
