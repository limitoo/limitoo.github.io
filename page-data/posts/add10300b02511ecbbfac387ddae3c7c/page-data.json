That's a lot of money. She gave them $3.5 million,\\\" Trump said in the interview from his South Florida property, Mar-a-Lago. \\\"So, now I would think Putin would know the answer to that. I think he should release it. I think we should know that answer.\\\"\", \"Trump went on to claim Putin \\\"now would be willing to probably give that answer.\\\"\", \"The former president brought up the accusation regularly during the 2020 presidential campaign, at rallies and during a debate\\u00a0with Mr. Biden.

The former president's actions regarding the withholding of the assistance led to his impeachment by the House on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Trump was acquitted by the Senate on both impeachment charges.\", \"Hunter Biden has since 2018 been under investigation for his tax affairs.
