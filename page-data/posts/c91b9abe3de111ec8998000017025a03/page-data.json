Sixty-seven percent of South Koreans view the alliance as a favorable measure under President Joe Biden, which is a \\\"substantial\\\" increase from last year's 47 percent, and the two years prior to 2020 under Trump.\", \"Also in the poll, more South Koreans believe that the U.S. would come to their defense now, as opposed to previous years. When asked if the U.S. would be \\\"fully committed to the defense of South Korea if there is a military provocation by North Korea,\\\" 77 percent of respondents were in agreement, compared to 62 percent last year.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926761/south-korea-flag.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A recent South Korea study has revealed that over two-thirds of South Koreans are in favor of a continued U.S. alliance, which is a huge increase from when former President Donald Trump was in office.

During the latter part of his presidential tenure, Trump threatened North Korea with threats of \\\"fire and fury\\\" before meeting with top leaders and also criticized the long-standing U.S. trade relationship with South Korea. He also demanded that Seoul pay for the majority of the spending bill for housing roughly 28,500 American troops on the peninsula.\", \"Along with the above-referenced stats from the poll, 35 percent of respondents said they are comfortable with U.S. forces remaining in South Korea while another 40 percent said \\\"it should be decided based on the circumstances after the signing of a peace treaty.\\\"\", \"The defense policy institute's poll took place September 10 to October 14 and has a 3.1% margin of error.\"]","href_hash":"c91b9abe3de111ec8998000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c91b9abe3de111ec8998000017025a03"}},
