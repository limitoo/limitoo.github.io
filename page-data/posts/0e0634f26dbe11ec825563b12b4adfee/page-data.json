The left-hander feathered a delivery from Taskin Ahmed through to the gloves of wicketkeeper Liton Das, and was out for 16 at 160/8, just 30 runs ahead.\", \"Tim Southee didn't trouble the scorers, out bowled by Taskin for a duck at 161/9 to bring together Neil Wagner and Trent Boult as New Zealand's last wicket pair.\", \"Boult hit two boundaries for his eight runs, but played one shot too many when spinner Mehidy Hasan Miraz was introduced into the attack.\", \"A slog into the leg side was spectacularly held by sub-fielder Taijul Islam, bringing New Zealand's innings to an end at 169 - the Blackcaps' lowest total against Bangladesh.\", \"From 136/2 when Will Young and Ross Taylor were batting together in the afternoon of day four, the Blackcaps lost 8/33, with no answers to a fired up Ebadot.\", \"Southee struck in his first over with the ball, as Shadman Islam edged behind to Tom Blundell at 3/1, seeing Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque in at No.3, with regular opener Mahmudul Hasan Joy ruled out of the rest of the tour with a finger injury.\", \"Bangladesh batted to within one shot of victory at 34/1, before Jamieson dismissed Najmul Hossain Shanto for 17, but ultimately it was too little too late for the Blackcaps.\", \"Fittingly, that saw Mushfiqur Rahim - Bangladesh's most-capped test cricketer - to the middle, with the chance to be involved in the winning moment.\\u00a0\", \"And as if scripted, it was Mushfiqur that sealed victory, cutting Jamieson for four and created history for a Bangaldesh side written off before a ball had been bowled.\", \"The two sides will now head to Christchurch for the second test, beginning on Hagley Oval on January 9.\", \"Bangladesh can look to complete their finest moment as a cricketing nation with a victory, while the Blackcaps will need to win to at the very least keep their World Test Championship title defence hopes alive.\"]","href_hash":"0e0634f26dbe11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0e0634f26dbe11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
