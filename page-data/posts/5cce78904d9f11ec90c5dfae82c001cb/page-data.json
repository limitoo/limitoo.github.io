with it?\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How are China and Taiwan involved?</div>\", \"At the centre of a deepening rift between the central government and Malaita Province\\u00a0\\u2014 the most

diplomatic ties to Taipei rather than Beijing \\u2014 a significant proportion\\u00a0of which are in the South Pacific.\", \"But in September 2019, Mr Sogavare established formal diplomatic ties with China.\", \"The ABC reported at the time\\u00a0that some $US500 million ($730 million) worth of\\u00a0financial aid had been promised\\u00a0by Beijing to the Solomons\\u00a0\\u2014 one of the

Province\\u00a0Premier Daniel Suidani has been outspoken in his opposition of the national government's decision to switch to China, and\\u00a0South Pacific geopolitical researcher\\u00a0Ed Cavanough
