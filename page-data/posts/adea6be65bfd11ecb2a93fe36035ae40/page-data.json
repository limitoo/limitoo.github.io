Propped on crutches, she talked with teammates, coaches and reporters.\", \"Bueckers had sustained a tibial plateau fracture in her left knee with less than a minute remaining in a Dec. 5 home game against Notre Dame. She is expected to miss six to eight weeks, a timeline that would allow her to return in time to play in the Big East and N.C.A.A. tournaments in March.\", \"\\u201cShe needed to solicit a couple other opinions and then the next step is there\\u2019s either going to be surgery or there\\u2019s not going to be surgery and that\\u2019s got to happen relatively soon,\\u201d Coach Geno Auriemma said after a 71-61 win over U.C.L.A.\", \"\\u201cI think by the next couple days here we\\u2019re going to have a definitive answer, yes or no,\\u201d he added.\", \"Even if Bueckers, 20, whom UConn did not make available for this story, undergoes surgery, Auriemma said he didn\\u2019t expect it to impact her recovery much. He said he was eyeing \\u201cmid-February or late-February at the latest\\u201d for her return.\", \"Bueckers\\u2019 injury has raised several questions: Should she have still been in the game \\u2014 a blowout \\u2014 at the end? What does her absence mean for UConn\\u2019s chances of winning a 12th national championship under Auriemma? Will it impact her ability to earn money through her mame, image and likeness deals? It has also raised one certainty: it will be a long six to eight weeks for the Huskies (6-2).\", \"Bueckers had amassed 22 points, 5 steals, 4 rebounds and 4 assists in 39 minutes that positioned UConn for a 73-54 blowout of a ranked Notre Dame (9-2) team before sustaining the non-contact injury. Bueckers was dribbling up the court when she stumbled, twisted her ankle and fell awkwardly on her left leg.\", \"Afterward, many on social media questioned whether Bueckers should have even been in the game at that stage.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s certainly something to talk about,\\u201d Rebecca Lobo, the former UConn and W.N.B.A. star who was part of the ABC broadcast team for the U.C.L.A. game, told The New York Times, before referencing the anterior cruciate ligament injury she had while playing with the Liberty. \\u201cBut when I tore my knee the first time, it was in the first minute of a game. Non-contact. I thought there was contact but there wasn\\u2019t. With injuries, I\\u2019m sure people are going to second guess but that can only get you so far.\\u201d\", \"What remains to be seen is how far the Huskies will get without Bueckers, who was averaging 21.2 points, 6.2 assists and 5.5 rebounds per game while shooting 56 percent from the field at the time of the injury. She had accounted for at least 45 percent of UConn\\u2019s total points.\", \"Against Seton Hall on Dec. 3, she had 23 points, 9 rebounds, 7 assists and 5 steals. On one play, she threw a three-quarter-court pass to her roommate Christyn Williams for a layup.\", \"After Bueckers\\u2019 injury, Williams said she had made chocolate chip cookies to help her feel better. \\u201cI\\u2019m hurt,\\u201d Williams said on a call with reporters. \\u201cPaige is one of our leaders on the floor \\u2014 she\\u2019s my point guard, she\\u2019s my sister. We\\u2019re family.\\u201d\", \"Without Bueckers, UConn lost, 57-44, at unranked Georgia Tech (8-2) last Thursday, snapping a 239-game winning streak against unranked opponents.\", \"\\u201cThat loss the other night probably told a lot of our players that you\\u2019re not good enough right now the way you\\u2019re playing basketball,\\u201d Auriemma said. \\u201cAnd it told our team that you\\u2019re not really playing as a team.\\u201d\", \"UConn is also dealing with injuries to the freshman Azzi Fudd, the nation\\u2019s top-ranked 2021 recruit, who is expected to miss at least two weeks because of a foot injury, and the sophomore guard Nika Muhl, who could miss several weeks with a foot injury. Neither played against Georgia Tech. \", \"UConn is actually down four guards because the freshman Saylor Poffenbarger announced last month that she was entering the transfer portal.\", \"\\u201cThey still got a lot of really, really good players, so I don\\u2019t feel really sorry for them, to be honest with you,\\u201d U.C.L.A. Coach Cori Close said.\", \"Against U.C.L.A. (5-3), five UConn players scored in double-figures as the Huskies got back on the winning track. Evina Westbrook, a redshirt senior guard, stepped into the point guard role in Bueckers\\u2019 absence and had 17 points and 7 assists to only a single turnover.\", \"Auriemma said the team as currently constituted doesn\\u2019t have the ability to \\u201cpush the ball and spread the floor\\u201d as much as it did with Bueckers, but he hoped that other players would step up in her absence.\", \"\\u201cNow when Paige and the rest of our players do come back, there\\u2019s more people in the party instead of outside hoping to get in, and feel like they belong here and can contribute not just when they have to but they\\u2019ll be able to contribute as part of the natural flow of our offense,\\u201d he said.\", \"Bueckers sat behind the UConn bench, shouting her support to teammates. After the game, she pulled on a black winter coat and limped on her crutches to meet them in the locker room.\", \"The Huskies next play No. 7 Louisville on Sunday, and they will also play No. 1 South Carolina \\u2014 which beat them in a neutral-site game in November \\u2014 and No. 9 Tennessee in the new year.\", \"\\u201cMy thought after the Georgia Tech game was all right, UConn might take their lumps in a way we haven\\u2019t seen in a really long time over the course of the next six to eight weeks,\\u201d Lobo said.\", \"\\u201cThey might take their losses in a different way. It might be losses to an unranked team, it might be less-than-pretty wins. We\\u2019re so used to watching them be so pretty offensively, but ultimately assuming she can come back at some point, I would still imagine they will be in the hunt for another Final Four.\\u201d\", \"Last month Bueckers became the first college athlete to sign with Gatorade, and The Wall Street Journal reported that she could make an estimated $1 million a year in endorsements between Gatorade and another deal with the global sneaker and streetwear reseller StockX.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not a career-ending injury, hopefully for her it\\u2019s not even a season-ending injury, so I don\\u2019t really think it will impact that stuff as much,\\u201d Lobo said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not like Gatorade and StockX are running commercials during our ABC game. They\\u2019re having her do stuff on their social media platforms.\\u201d\", \"Bueckers will be eligible for the W.N.B.A. draft in 2023. While N.B.A. rules allow players to jump to the pros after one year of college \\u2014 or the year in which they turn 19 \\u2014 prospective W.N.B.A. players generally aren\\u2019t allowed to go until they complete four years of college, although there have been exceptions.\", \"\\u201cMy argument would be that a player like Paige could potentially make more money the longer she stays at UConn,\\u201d Lobo said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just the truth that even the most recognizable college players, when you go to the W.N.B.A., unfortunately your visibility decreases. Hopefully, that changes soon but with N.I.L. it might make more financial sense to stay in school.\\u201d\", \"Bueckers is expected to be at UConn for two more seasons \\u2014 but her coach and teammates can\\u2019t wait to get her back in the next two months.\"]","href_hash":"adea6be65bfd11ecb2a93fe36035ae40"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"adea6be65bfd11ecb2a93fe36035ae40"}},
