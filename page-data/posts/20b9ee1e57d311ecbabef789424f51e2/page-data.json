I don\\u2019t have data to support that claim, but come on: You and I both know it has to be true. What else have we been doing for the last two years?\", \"Even before the pandemic annexed previously I.R.L. interactions, turning work meetings and family gatherings into extensions of screen time, the writing was on the wall. Maybe that\\u2019s the wrong clich\\u00e9: The shadows on the wall of Plato\\u2019s cave stopped being metaphors. They were us.\", \"A history of how this came to be \\u2014 how screen life came to dominate reality, replacing large swaths of it and reconfiguring others \\u2014 might begin with movies, with one of those origin myths about how early audiences mistook projected pictures for physical phenomena. Our na\\u00efve ancestors, one legend tells us, saw a black-and-white silent clip of a train pulling into a station and scrambled to get out of its way. Nowadays, our gullibility runs in the other direction. We might doubt the fact of a real locomotive if there were a video on YouTube questioning its existence.\", \"Really, though, what is happening to our minds, our morals and our politics has very little to do with movies, or television, or the other technologies that we used to blame for corrupting our youth and messing with our epistemology. What Susan Sontag called \\u201cthe image-world\\u201d is now just the world. \\u201cThe powers of photography,\\u201d she wrote in the 1970s, have made it \\u201cless and less plausible to reflect upon our experience according to the distinction between images and things, between copies and originals.\\u201d And, we might add, between experience and performance.\", \"That, along with everything else, complicates this Great Performers, traditionally an annual celebration of movie stars.\", \"In 2020, when Covid all but halted movie openings and made in-person photo shoots hazardous, we responded by opening up Great Performers, for the first time, to include performances in nonmovie media: actors who worked mainly in television; stand-up comedians; TikTok artists and Twitter jesters. We could have gone further, of course, making room for politicians and public health officials, anti-mask tantrum-throwers and their designated shamers, influencers and meme-mongers and toddlers who tumbled into frame during parental work Zooms. All of them could be classified as performers, and some of them were pretty great.\", \"This year, we faced a similar quandary. Movies are back, sort of, but it isn\\u2019t as if the status quo has been magically restored. This time, the urgent questions felt a little different. Not so much \\u201cWho is a performer\\u201d \\u2014 because finally, who isn\\u2019t? \\u2014 but rather: \\u201cWhat does a performer do to earn our attention?\\u201d\", \"What is the matter of performance, and why do some performances matter? The first part is to some extent objective. It\\u2019s possible, and can be a lot of fun, to analyze the particulars of technique that make the work work. Will Smith\\u2019s Louisiana drawl, thigh-hugging shorts and rounded shoulders in \\u201cKing Richard,\\u201d details of an impersonation of Venus and Serena Williams\\u2019s father that relies on and repurposes Smith\\u2019s own familiar and durable charm. Gaby Hoffmann\\u2019s sparrowish quickness and hawklike focus in \\u201cC\\u2019mon C\\u2019mon.\\u201d Joaquin Phoenix\\u2019s shambling, loose-hipped movement in the same film. The menacing stillness and disarmingly graceful brutality of Benedict Cumberbatch in \\u201cThe Power of the Dog.\\u201d The vocal, facial and gestural counterpoint of Ruth Negga and Tessa Thompson in \\u201cPassing.\\u201d The heartbreaking naturalness of Jos\\u00e9phine and Gabrielle Sanz in \\u201cPetite Maman,\\u201d twin sisters using their resemblance and rapport to play, of all things, a daughter and her mother.\", \"But analysis can only go so far. The effect that actors have \\u2014 the source of their power and fascination \\u2014 is more than just subjective. It\\u2019s interpersonal. Watching them act, we don\\u2019t simply appreciate their discipline or admire their craft. Whether they are professionals or not, whether they are pretending to be well-known figures from literature and history (Macbeth, Princess Diana), ordinary people or themselves, they offer the potent, sometimes uncomfortable possibility of intimacy. The illusion they create isn\\u2019t that they really are who they are playing, but rather that, whoever they are, we know them.\", \"The process of choosing \\u2014 of gleaning, from the universe of performances, 10 or a dozen great ones \\u2014 has felt to me more personal this year than it has before. Less governed by the intellectual procedures of criticism, more fully influenced by mysteries of taste and affection. This year\\u2019s Great Performers is devoted to 14 actors whose presence I couldn\\u2019t shake, who would not quit me.\", \"One thing they have in common \\u2014 maybe the only thing, beyond their effect on me \\u2014 is that they appear in stand-alone, feature-length narratives. In the olden days (which ended around 2017), it would have been clear that we were talking about movies rather than television, but thanks to streaming that distinction is now fully obsolete. \\u201cThe Power of the Dog,\\u201d Jane Campion\\u2019s epic, wide-screen western, is a Netflix thing. So is the exquisitely silver-toned period psychodrama of Rebecca Hall\\u2019s \\u201cPassing.\\u201d So is Bo Burnham\\u2019s one-man stand-up-special-cum-video-diary, \\u201cInside.\\u201d Joel Coen\\u2019s \\u201cThe Tragedy of Macbeth,\\u201d with its light-and-shadow cinematography and expressionist set design \\u2014 and with a haggard, volcanic Denzel Washington in the title role \\u2014 will appear on Apple TV+.\", \"The flood of digital content comes from a single tap, which can make everything seem equivalent. An Instagram feed, a British baking show, old \\u201c30 Rock,\\u201d new \\u201cInsecure,\\u201d plumbing tips and porn \\u2014 all that stuff might share your algorithms with past and present masterworks of cinema. The old taste hierarchies that would stack such offerings (and their fans) into pyramids of cultural status are a distant memory.\", \"Aesthetic distinctions still matter, though, and may reside precisely in the various kinds of connection that different forms offer. Episodic narratives, with their busy ensembles, are simulations of social and domestic life. They concern people in groups, inserting the viewer into the dynamics of collective behavior. From episode to episode, your allegiances and tolerances will shift in ways that are anticipated and manipulated by the creators. As you watch \\u201cSuccession,\\u201d let\\u2019s say, you might get annoyed with Kendall and decide to hang out with Roman and Gerri. When that becomes too kinky, you seek refuge in Shiv\\u2019s cynicism or cousin Greg\\u2019s goofiness. And then Logan does something that makes you feel sorry for Kendall all over again. The whole time, of course, you keep reminding yourself that you don\\u2019t really like any of these people. (Even if you\\u2019ve never watched the show, you get what I\\u2019m talking about. The same thing happens with \\u201cWhite Lotus,\\u201d \\u201cGrey\\u2019s Anatomy\\u201d or \\u201cThe Real Housewives.\\u201d) At the other end of the spectrum, the stars of TikTok offer beguiling glimpses and whispered confidences \\u2014 a state of perpetual flirtation that teases and endlessly defers the promise of something more.\", \"A single story contained in a more-or-less two-hour vessel \\u2014 what we used to just call a movie \\u2014 offers a form of engagement that is less extensive than any serial and also more intense. Cinephiles worried about the disappearance of movie theaters lament the potential loss of ephemeral communities that assemble when an audience of strangers gathers in a big, dark room. I\\u2019d suggest that what defines cinema as an art form is another kind of communion, the brief flickering of a unique bond with the people onscreen.\", \"The movies that generated this collection of performers vary enormously with respect to genre, tone, scale and theme. What they share is close attention to a single person functioning either within a circumscribed, highly charged set of relationships or in a state of isolation. Bo Burnham in his studio. Macbeth in his madness. Kristen Stewart\\u2019s Diana (in \\u201cSpencer\\u201d) in the empty chambers and whispering corridors of Sandringham House. Emi (Katia Pascariu) on the streets of Bucharest in \\u201cBad Luck Banging or Loony Porn.\\u201d Yusuke (Hidetoshi Nishijima), the widowed theater artist in \\u201cDrive My Car,\\u201d alone with his grief and guilt. Even the gregarious Richard Williams seems like a man apart, a stranger in the white, privileged world of competitive tennis, sometimes at odds with his own family.\", \"It\\u2019s not surprising that loneliness is a recurrent feature \\u2014 a subject, a mood, an artistic strategy \\u2014 in Covid-shadowed cinema. (The pandemic itself, the subject and setting of \\u201cInside,\\u201d also features explicitly in \\u201cBad Luck Banging\\u201d and obliquely in \\u201cDrive My Car.\\u201d In the first, Pascariu wears a surgical mask almost the whole time; in the second, the masks show up in an epilogue that takes place some time after the main story.) It also strikes me that solitude is a source of these characters\\u2019 credibility, of the uncanny sense of recognition we (or I, at least) feel in their presence.\", \"The idea that movies run on empathy \\u2014 a key insight of the great film critic Roger Ebert \\u2014 is by now something of a truism. But empathy can be counterfeited, coerced and abused. Audiences can be tricked into caring about people who aren\\u2019t worthy of it. Or, even worse, we can restrict our caring only to people who obviously deserve it, who we have decided in advance merit our solidarity, pity or identification. A better standard might be curiosity \\u2014 the feeling that we are in the company of someone worth knowing, however complicated that knowledge may turn out to be.\", \"One of the key words in the contemporary lexicon is \\u201cperformative,\\u201d which functions in the more heavily polemicized zones of the internet as a fancy synonym for \\u201cinsincere.\\u201d A wholly accusatory term \\u2014 nothing you would ascribe to yourself or your allies \\u2014 it implies that whoever you are accusing isn\\u2019t really mad, concerned or passionate about whatever the day\\u2019s news cycle has tossed in their path but is only pretending to be.\", \"Not to be that guy, but this usage is the opposite of what philosopher J.L. Austin meant by \\u201cperformative,\\u201d a quasi-technical term he applied to a speech act that does what it says. Examples are scarce and specific: when you say \\u201cI swear\\u201d in a court of law or \\u201cI fold\\u201d at a poker table, you\\u2019re using performatives. You can fold your cards reluctantly or mistakenly, but not ironically. The words are the deed.\", \"These divergent definitions suggest an interesting tension within our understanding of what it is to perform, perhaps especially in a world where we presume everything is being done for show. A performance is, by definition, something false, put on, artificial, self-conscious. And also, by the opposing definition, something authentic, persuasive, organic, true.\", \"In his book \\u201cThe Method,\\u201d which will be published early next year, the critic and stage director Isaac Butler traces the history of this tension as it applies to acting. Starting in prerevolutionary Russia, a new approach to theater insisted on truth \\u2014 as opposed to eloquence, bravura or technical skill \\u2014 as the highest value in acting. Its guru was Konstantin Stanislavsky. The Russian word perezhivanie, usually rendered as \\u201cexperience\\u201d and described by Butler as \\u201ca state of fusion between actor and character,\\u201d was the key to Stanislavsky\\u2019s system.\", \"The experience of the character is what the actor explores inwardly and communicates outwardly, in such a way that the spectator accepts what he or she knows is not the case. We don\\u2019t mistake Will Smith for Richard Williams, Kristen Stewart for Diana or Bo Burham for himself, but we nonetheless believe them.\", \"The arrival of Stanislavsky\\u2019s teaching in America \\u2014 where it was preached as the Method by teachers like Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler and practiced by artists like Elia Kazan, Marlon Brando and Kim Stanley \\u2014 coincided with a renewed commitment to realism in theater and film. For actors, the always elusive, you-know-it-when-you-see-it standard of realism was not faithful mimicry so much as psychological truth. There were differing ideas about how that could be achieved, but a basic tenet was that the feelings, memories and impulses of the performer were tools for mastering the character.\", \"The Method peaked in the 1950s and \\u201960s, but the mystique of authenticity remains. In popular culture, \\u201cmethod acting\\u201d now refers to an extreme commitment to erasing the boundary between character and self, a kind of total identification that is in many respects the opposite of what Stanislavsky and his American followers espoused. It means throwing yourself headlong into a character: speaking in dialect 24/7; gaining or losing a lot of weight; embracing outlandish behavior; neglecting personal hygiene. Not to find the sources of the character within yourself, but to make yourself, almost literally, into the character, to go so far into the performance that you are no longer performing.\", \"If you follow that logic far enough, it starts to loop back on itself. Didn\\u2019t we already establish that everyone is always performing? Doesn\\u2019t that make every performance a meta-performance? Isn\\u2019t authenticity another kind of artifice?\", \"That infinite regression \\u2014 the abyss of self-consciousness that opens up whenever we open our mouths or turn on our cameras \\u2014 is the explicit subject of \\u201cInside.\\u201d Like Burnham\\u2019s previous stand-up specials, and like everyone else\\u2019s, it is addressed directly to an audience. The difference is that the audience is absent, and that Burnham\\u2019s performance is contained by a literal fourth wall. Alone in a room during lockdown, with a lighting rig, a keyboard and some other equipment but no other cast or crew, he plays with time \\u2014 Does this last for 90 minutes? A year? Your whole life? \\u2014 and with the conventions of online self-presentation. He undermines his privileged, white-male assumptions with self-awareness, and then undermines the assumption that self-awareness can accomplish anything. He mocks selfie and Instagram culture with the language of their own self-mockery. He fakes emotion so knowingly that when what looks like real emotion breaks out \\u2014 when he weeps or raves or curls up in a ball \\u2014 we have to be suspicious, even if we\\u2019re moved. He is either laying open his innermost self (one meaning of the title) or else showing off his specialized knowledge of how the manipulation of meaning works (another possible meaning of the title). Or both, because the point is that there isn\\u2019t a difference.\", \"Unless you really pay attention. Movies are often said to resemble dreams in the way they assemble fragmentary images and fugitive meanings into illusions of continuity. The internet, by contrast, replicates \\u2014 and also, of course, consumes \\u2014 waking consciousness, fragmenting experience into shards of distraction, dissociation and randomness. That\\u2019s the experience Burnham tries to capture in \\u201cInside,\\u201d but you understand what he\\u2019s doing only if you keep watching, without checking your texts or your Twitter feed or using the screen-in-screen feature to keep track of the playoff game.\", \"That kind of exclusive engagement is something Burnham pointedly (and poignantly) begs for, even as he doubts it exists. His neediness turns a subtext of performance into text. Look at me! See me! Understand me! But like every other performer, he\\u2019s also saying the opposite: I\\u2019m not who you think I am. I\\u2019m not really here.\", \"What is it like to live inside that doubleness, to practice a self-presentation that it also self-erasure? The Diana in \\u201cSpencer\\u201d might have something to say about that. Kristen Stewart in \\u201cSpencer\\u201d absolutely does. The argument about how good an actress she is has long been settled. Her skill was never in dispute around here; this is her third Great Performers appearance. But her work in \\u201cSpencer\\u201d represents a new level of achievement, and not primarily because of the technical hurdles she clears. The accent is faultless, the posture impeccable, the mix of vulnerability and grit completely persuasive. But this isn\\u2019t Kristen Stewart disappearing into the role. It\\u2019s closer to the old Method ideal of an actor using her own experience to gain access to the inner life of the character. A big part of the experience that fuses Stewart to Diana is the experience of being a movie star, of living from a very young age in the glare of public scrutiny, of losing the boundary between your private and your performing self.\", \"I don\\u2019t mean that \\u201cSpencer\\u201d is shadow autobiography, or that Stewart identifies with Diana (though it\\u2019s easy enough to suppose that she sympathizes with some aspects of the princess\\u2019s plight). I\\u2019m more interested in the ways the film feeds our curiosity about both women, flattering and challenging our sense that we know them. We are taken into Diana\\u2019s confidence even as we are aware of invading her privacy, of witnessing her private agonies and anxieties. A terrible thing about her situation, among judgmental in-laws and all-seeing members of the royal staff, is the absence of anyone she can entirely trust. There turn out to be a few exceptions: her young sons; a kind dresser played by Sally Hawkins. Above all, there is the audience. Everyone else will betray her, but not us.\", \"Maybe that\\u2019s too much. Maybe you recoil from that imposition. \\u201cSpencer\\u201d is like \\u201cInside\\u201d in the way it risks alienating the viewer by demanding a kind and intensity of attention we may not be willing to confer. It also asks us to appreciate the way Diana learns to master the role of herself \\u2014 to become more authentic not by rejecting the performance of princesshood but by taking control of it.\", \"Maybe that\\u2019s just what a great actor does. And maybe, right now, the truest performances \\u2014 the great performances \\u2014 are the ones that double that accomplishment, that require actors to play actors. The two women at the center of \\u201cPassing,\\u201d Ruth Negga\\u2019s Clare and Tessa Thompson\\u2019s Irene, are friends from childhood, both Black, who find themselves on opposite sides of the color line in 1920s New York. Not that it\\u2019s so simple as that. Clare, married to a racist white man, intentionally passes for white. Irene, who lives in Harlem and is active in the Negro Welfare League, is sometimes mistaken for white in other parts of the city. Which one is performing, and what role? Those questions generate a lot of suspense and also a sense of vertigo about what is real, who is telling the truth, and whether authenticity has any bearing at all in matters of race and sexuality.\", \"The beauty of the film lies in the contrast between the two central performances. Negga plays Irene as a risk-taker and an extrovert, delighting in her secret, in the danger of exposure, and in the ongoing, improvisatory imperatives of passing. Thompson\\u2019s Irene, repressed, serious and anxious, is driven to distraction, and ultimately to violence, less by Clare\\u2019s enactment of whiteness than by the lightness of spirit she brings to it. Clare knows how to act, so to speak, while Irene, forced into a performance of respectable, middle-class motherhood, feels trapped in a lie.\", \"Emi, in \\u201cBad Luck Banging,\\u201d is ensnared in the consequences of a performance that found the wrong audience. A sex tape that she made with her husband finds its way onto the internet, causing a scandal at the school where Emi teaches. The first three minutes of the movie consist of that tape, which means that Pascariu, like Emi \\u2014 Pascariu as Emi, though we don\\u2019t know that yet \\u2014 is introduced in a state of maximum physical exposure. For the rest of the film, she is fully dressed and almost always masked, which removes some of the usual resources of screen performance. There are barely any close-ups, no visible smiles or grimacing, so we try to read her mood through her eyes and the crease between them. At the end, she confronts a hostile audience of parents who watch the naughty clip in her presence and then enact a theater of shaming and bad-faith argument, both for and against her. If the greatness of some of the other performances lies in their achievement of intimacy, Pascariu\\u2019s is great because she defends Emi\\u2019s privacy and preserves her dignity, reminding us how much we don\\u2019t know about her, even if we think we\\u2019ve seen everything.\", \"And so it is with Julie Harte, the young filmmaker played by Honor Swinton Byrne in Joanna Hogg\\u2019s \\u201cThe Souvenir Part II.\\u201d In the first \\u201cSouvenir,\\u201d Julie fell in love with an eccentric fellow who turned out to be a compulsive liar and a heroin addict, and in the sequel she is making a film about their relationship and his death. This is an overtly autobiographical film, set in the 1980s, and Julie\\u2019s movie-within-the-movie, a student film, is a replica of Hogg\\u2019s own early work. The two \\u201cSouvenir\\u201d movies together seem to amount to an act of total cinematic exposure, but they also affirm just how mysterious even our own experience can be. And the key to the mystery \\u2014 not the solution to it but the dark center of it \\u2014 is Swinton Byrne\\u2019s quiet, reserved, at times almost affectless performance. We know her by not knowing her; her performance hides as much as it reveals.\", \"Which is just what people are like. And acting, finally, is a way of acquainting us with the strangeness of being human. One of the most perfect metaphors for this strangeness \\u2014 and also one of the most perceptive considerations of acting I\\u2019ve seen onscreen \\u2014 comes in \\u201cDrive My Car,\\u201d adapted by Ryusuke Hamaguchi from a Haruki Murakami short story. The main character, Yusuke, an actor and director, specializes in an unusual form of experimental theater, presenting classic plays with multinational casts, each actor speaking in their own native language. At a theater workshop in Hiroshima, he assembles a cast for Chekhov\\u2019s \\u201cUncle Vanya\\u201d with dialogue in Japanese, Mandarin, Tagalog, Korean and Korean sign language. The actors prepare by mastering the timing of the lines, and by receiving the psychological meaning of words they don\\u2019t literally understand.\", \"The result, as presented onscreen and threaded through Yusuke\\u2019s own emotional turmoil, is almost shatteringly powerful. As Yusuke, Nishijima stands at a slight remove from the play-within-the-movie, since Yusuke hasn\\u2019t cast himself. Instead, he watches, as we watch, a kind of miracle unfold. The tenderness and melancholy of Chekhov\\u2019s play, its nuances of thwarted ambition, misdirected desire and piercing devotion, don\\u2019t emerge in spite of the linguistic cacophony, but by means of it. A more concentrated, almost spiritual form of understanding ripples among the actors \\u2014 finally including Yusuke himself \\u2014 and it seems to flow outward, from the stage to the theater audience and then from the screen to you. You don\\u2019t quite believe what you\\u2019ve seen, but you feel it. More than that: You know it.\"]","href_hash":"20b9ee1e57d311ecbabef789424f51e2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"20b9ee1e57d311ecbabef789424f51e2"}},
