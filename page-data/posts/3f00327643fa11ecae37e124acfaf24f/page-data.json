Probably that they bury their heads in the sand. Actually, they don\\u2019t; they\\u2019re just checking their eggs. But I was in the same ostrich-ignorant boat until I met Gaucho, the avian sidekick in Betsy Bird\\u2019s charming, galvanizing and slightly wacky novel \\u201cLong Road to the Circus,\\u201d about a 12-year-old farm girl, Suzy Bowles, who, in the summer of 1920, sets her sights on ostrich-riding as her ticket out of sleepy Burr Oak, Mich.\", \"Before I educate you about these \\u201ckeen, kooky, modern-day dinosaurs,\\u201d let me introduce you to Gaucho\\u2019s co-star. Suzy is the second-youngest of five kids and the daughter and granddaughter of hardworking folks who do their chores, get to church and occasionally enjoy a scrumptious-looking homemade apple pie. (You haven\\u2019t seen a lattice crust until you\\u2019ve beheld one illustrated by David Small.) Suzy loves her family, but the last thing she wants to do is become a local biddy gabbing outside the library (\\u201ca woman who sees gossip more like air than food\\u201d).\", \"One morning she follows her \\u201clag-about,\\u201d ex-cowboy uncle to a farm owned by the regal and refined Madame Marantette, formerly of Ringling Brothers (before their merger with Barnum & Bailey, apparently). There, Suzy meets Madame\\u2019s herd of ostriches, one of whom \\u2014 the ornery Gaucho \\u2014 has been conscripted to pull a surrey at the country fair. His owner has designs on a world record, and Suzy wants in on the plan. If you\\u2019ve ever read a book involving a plucky girl who falls under the sway of a reclusive outsider, you won\\u2019t be surprised to learn that preparations include not only Gaucho\\u2019s training, but also the education of Suzy, who gets a crash course in poise and tenacity. Wrangling an ostrich is no easy feat, and neither is preparing for the world she glimpses in Madame\\u2019s photo albums.\", \"But about those birds. Props to our aptly named author, a librarian who pur\\u00e9es factual information into her story without a hint of spinach aftertaste. Here\\u2019s what I learned while rooting for Suzy and getting my bearings in Burr Oak: Ostriches weigh around 320 pounds, the same as two sheep. They can run 40 miles per hour. They don\\u2019t sweat, they pant. And their eyeballs are bigger than their brains. Suzy describes Gaucho\\u2019s neck as a freaky hybrid of an elephant\\u2019s trunk and a snake. \\u201cName me one thing in this good great world important enough to justify a neck like that,\\u201d Bird writes. \\u201cOne thing. Can\\u2019t be done.\\u201d\", \"Occasionally we encounter language that\\u2019s out of step with the time period \\u2014 for instance, I don\\u2019t think a \\u201cwoman-owned\\u201d photography studio would have meant much to a 12-year-old during the Woodrow Wilson administration. But the appearance of, say, \\u201cliterally\\u201d and \\u201cdeal\\u201d in their modern incarnations may help acclimate history-wary readers. (\\u201cOlden times? Forget it,\\u201d a close relative once said of the Little House books.)\", \"Small\\u2019s illustrations will also pull in reluctant types. A cozy house at sunrise, a gaggle of feisty chickens, a scarecrow minding a field \\u2014 these drawings made me homesick for the Bowles place when I left. We learn that the setting was inspired by Bird\\u2019s grandmother\\u2019s farm, which wasn\\u2019t far from the home of the real-life circus performer Madame Marantette \\u2014 which happened to be the same house where David Small lived when Bird was growing up in Kalamazoo, Mich., in the 1980s. (He came to speak at her school.)\", \"Even more amazing is the rush that comes from racing across a field on the back of an ostrich, braids flying, Queen Anne\\u2019s lace speeding by in a blur. With its timeless messages about big dreams and the beloved people who make them possible, \\u201cLong Road to the Circus\\u201d takes you there. It is \\u2014 sorry not sorry \\u2014 a brass ring to grab with both hands.\"]","href_hash":"3f00327643fa11ecae37e124acfaf24f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3f00327643fa11ecae37e124acfaf24f"}},
