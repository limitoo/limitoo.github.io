Last year, 3,361 applications for grant money were submitted, amounting to nearly $400 million in funding requests. Of those, 1,532 applications were approved, according to FEMA.\\u00a0\", \"They can be used to purchase security systems, fences, gates and cameras, and invest in cybersecurity or training programs for congregants.
