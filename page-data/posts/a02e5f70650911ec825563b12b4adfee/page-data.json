Even if it's only half as transformative as Hubble, (you) wouldn't be over-hyping it.\\\"\", \"It will take Webb a full month to reach its orbital parking place in deep space a million miles from Earth \\u2014 known as Lagrange Point 2, or L2 \\u2014 where it can circle the sun in gravitational lockstep with Earth, minimizing fuel usage to extend its life as long as possible.\", \"Thanks to a near-perfect launch, a thruster firing Saturday night to fine-tune Webb's trajectory may need less fuel than otherwise expected, helping extend the telescope's operational life.\", \"\\\"This was such a great moment on Christmas Day,\\\" Josef Aschbacher, director general of the European Space Agency, said of the launch. \\\"The whole world has been watching this, and I'm very happy to say that team Europe has delivered. We have delivered the spacecraft very precisely into orbit in terms of altitude, speed, (orbital) inclination.\\\"\", \"The telescope is optimized to capture images of the first stars and galaxies to begin shining in the aftermath of the Big Bang, light that has been stretched into the infrared portion of the spectrum by the expansion of space itself over the past 13.8 billion years.\", \"That light can't be seen by the iconic Hubble, which Webb will eventually replace. Hubble was designed to study visible light wavelengths but even so, it has detected galaxies dating back to within a half billion years of the Big Bang.\", \"Webb should be able to push several hundred million years beyond that, detecting light that began heading out when the universe was just 200 million years or so old. That's the era when the cosmos first emerged from the hydrogen fog of birth and starlight began traveling freely through space.\", \"The long hoped-for baby pictures of the universe are expected to shed revolutionary light on the formation and evolution of galaxies, the supermassive black holes that lurk at their hearts and the life cycles of stars, from birth to the titanic supernova blasts that cooked up most of the elements in the periodic table.\", \"Closer to home, Webb also will study the atmospheres of planets orbiting nearby stars to characterize their habitability and provide routine, up-close looks at planets, moons, asteroids and comets in Earth's solar system from Mars outward to the remote Kuiper Belt beyond Neptune.\", \"Lagrange Point 2 is far beyond the reach of any foreseeable astronaut repair crews, but it's an ideal place to achieve the ultra-low temperatures required to detect infrared emissions from the infant universe.\", \"But the orbit alone isn't enough to cool Webb down to within the required 50 degrees or so above absolute zero.\", \"For the telescope's 21.3-foot-wide primary mirror and its four sensitive instruments to detect that faint heat, Webb must first unfold and stretch out a sunshade the size of a tennis court to block out the light and thermal emissions of the sun, Earth and moon.\", \"It is considered by many the riskiest part of the mission, including launch.\", \"More than 100 electrically-activated mechanisms, used to hold the sunshade's five hair-thin Kapton layers in place during the vibration of launch and the onset of weightlessness, must all unlatch flawlessly so the membranes can be pulled out on booms as planned.\", \"Each layer then must be pulled taut and separated by motor-driven cables running through dozens of pulleys.\\u00a0\", \"If it all sounds complicated, it is. If it sounds unusually risky, it is.\", \"\\\"The sun shield is where so much of the deployment risk exists because that's where so many of the single point failures exist, and it's just complicated,\\\" said Paul Geithner, deputy project manager.\", \"\\\"We have 107 little non-explosive actuator devices, membrane release devices ... That's just where so much of the deployment risk is because it's a lot of parts. They're simple mechanisms, but there are a lot of them and they all have to work.\\\"\", \"Sunshade deployment is expected to begin December 28 and if all goes well, the process will be complete by January 2.\", \"Then comes deployment of Webb's 21.3-foot-wide segmented primary mirror, the largest ever built for an instrument in space. Like the sunshade, the the mirror had to be folded up to fit inside the Ariane 5's nose cone.\", \"Starting about 10 days after launch, six of the mirror's 18 hexagonal segments, three on each side, will be folded out and locked in place. Each segment can be tipped and tilted as required to achieve a razor-sharp focus, a process that will take months to complete.\", \"Throughout the deployments and commissioning process, Webb will continue its slow cool-down to reach the requirement operating temperature. If all goes well, the first science images are expected about six months after launch.\", \"\\\"All of these single point failures, all of these deployment mechanisms have to go right to make a telescope, there's no halfway stage,\\\" Mark McCaughrean, a senior advisor for science and exploration with the European Space Agency, said in an interview with Spaceflight Now.\", \"\\\"If the sunshield only half deploys, the telescope never gets cold, the instruments won't turn on. So that's the nerve-wracking time, that first month. And after that, the five months of cool down and commissioning, and then we can start doing the science.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"a02e5f70650911ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a02e5f70650911ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
