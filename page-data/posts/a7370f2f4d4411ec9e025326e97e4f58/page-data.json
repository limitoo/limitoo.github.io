He announced his intention to be on the front lines Monday, saying martyrdom could be needed. A government spokesman told the Associated Press Abiy arrived at the front Tuesday, though did not specify the exact location.\", \"The Tigray People's Liberation Front, the former ruling party of Ethiopia that Abiy designated a terrorist group, has been advancing to Addis Ababa in recent weeks, looking to strengthen their negotiating power or to get Abiy to step down. Tens of thousands have died in the war so far.\", \"Spokesman Legesse Tulu said Wednesday that the deputy prime minister, Demeke Mekonnen, is handling the government's day-to-day operations while Abiy is absent.\", \"\\\"The situation is extremely dangerous,\\\" Adem Abebe, a researcher with the International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance, said to the AP. \\\"If (Abiy) gets hurt or killed, it's not just the federal government that will collapse, the army will as well.\\\"\", \"Awol Allo nominated Abiy for the Nobel Prize when he made peace with neighboring Eritrea.

The prospect of the ancient nation breaking apart has alarmed both Ethiopians and observers who fear what would happen to the often turbulent Horn of Africa at large. Countries including France, Germany and Turkey have told their citizens to leave immediately.\", \"Abiy also invited Ethiopians to join him\\u2014the latest call for every able citizen in the country of more than 110 million people to fight. There have been reports of hurried military trainings and allegations of forced conscription in recent months, while analysts have warned that, with the military apparently weakened, ethnic-based militias are stepping up.\", \"U.S. envoy Jeffrey Feltman told reporters on Tuesday that he fears that \\\"nascent\\\" progress in mediation efforts with the warring sides could be outpaced by the \\\"alarming\\\" military developments.\", \"The war began in November 2020 when a growing political rift between the Tigray leaders and Abiy's government broke into open conflict. Abiy quietly allowed soldiers from Eritrea to enter Tigray and attack ethnic Tigrayans, resulting in some of the worst atrocities of the war. He denied the Eritreans' presence for months.\", \"The Tigray forces have said they want Abiy out, among other demands. Abiy's government wants the Tigray forces, which it has designated as a terrorist group, to withdraw to their region as part of their conditions.\", \"\\\"Unless there is some kind of divine intervention, I don't see any chance for a peaceful resolution through dialogue because the positions are highly polarized,\\\" said Kassahun Berhanu, professor of political science at Addis Ababa University, who added he believed Abiy's announcement about going to the front is \\\"aimed at boosting popular morale.\\\"\", \"Millions of civilians are trapped and going hungry amid the fighting.
