In such a case, the warrant would need to be approved by the Interim Chief Amelia Huffman. In all other cases, warrants must be executed with officers knocking on a door, announcing their presence, and waiting a reasonable time before entering. \", \"Locke, 22, was fatally shot Wednesday morning in a downtown apartment after a SWAT team burst in the door, executing a no-knock warrant. Locke, who was wrapped in a blanket on a couch at the time, sat up with a gun, body-camera video of the shooting showed. Locke, a legal gun owner, was shot three times, and died minutes later. \", \"Frey said the leadership of the Minneapolis Police Department will work with national experts DeRay McKesson and Dr. Pete Kraska of Eastern Kentucky University to review and suggest revisions to the department's policy on no-knock warrants. \", \"\\\"Over the last several years, our team has been working with jurisdictions across the country to implement meaningful changes to search warrant execution laws and policies,\\\" McKesson said in a statement. \\\"On our call, it was clear that Mayor Frey is committed to making changes to these processes in order to protect lives in Minneapolis and we are ready to lend a hand in this critical work.\\\" \", \"In 2020, Frey issued a policy restricting the execution of no-knock warrants in the city. The policy required that officers announce their presence prior to entry in all but exigent circumstances. \", \"In Locke's killing, the body-camera video released Thursday shows that officers announced their presence as they were entering the apartment, after they'd opened the door.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"95932a16868111ecb535719b6eaf555c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"95932a16868111ecb535719b6eaf555c"}},
