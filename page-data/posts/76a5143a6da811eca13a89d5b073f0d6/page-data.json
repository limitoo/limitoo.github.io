Instead, the I.O.C. has consistently deflected calls to exert more pressure on China \\u2014 a lucrative market and an important financial and organizational partner for the Olympics.\", \"For months, rights activists have asked the Olympic committee to ensure that Beijing 2022 merchandise had not been made under duress by Uyghurs in Xinjiang. So far, the I.O.C. has been reluctant to do so, according to correspondence between the I.O.C. and a rights group, which was reviewed by The Times.\", \"Context: In years past, the I.O.C. had been willing to engage with human rights concerns elsewhere, including prodding the Russian government to investigate claims of unpaid wages in 2014. The committee defended its approach in China, arguing that sports are a tool to building a better world.\", \"Related: Tesla came under fire from political leaders and human rights groups after announcing it would open a dealership in the Xinjiang region.\", \"The Philippines will bar all unvaccinated residents from leaving their homes, except for essential reasons, in Manila and the surrounding areas.

Unlike in the early 2000s, when leftists won critical presidencies in Latin America, the new officeholders are saddled by debt, lean budgets, scant access to credit and, in many cases, tough opposition.\", \"Global effect: The left\\u2019s gains could buoy China and undermine the U.S. as they compete for regional influence, analysts say. The change could also make it more difficult for the Americans to continue isolating leftist regimes in Venezuela, Nicaragua and Cuba.\", \"Next test: In Colombia, where a presidential election is set for May, Gustavo Petro, a leftist former mayor of Bogot\\u00e1 who once belonged to an urban guerrilla group, is leading in the polls.\", \"The Molenbeek neighborhood of Brussels was the breeding ground for a cell of terrorists that killed 162 people in Paris and Brussels in 2015 and 2016.
