Inside was Mr. Epstein, who slipped out of a robe and stood naked facing the door, which Ms. Maxwell then closed, Kate testified. It was the first of what would become regular sexual encounters.\", \"Here are some key moments from the trial\\u2019s sixth day:\", \"The prosecution has told jurors that Ms. Maxwell befriended girls and helped make them susceptible to abuse by Mr. Epstein. On the stand Kate told jurors about meeting Ms. Maxwell and visiting her home.\", \"\\u201cI felt that I had found a new connection that could be really meaningful to me,\\u201d she said of making Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s acquaintance. \\u201cI was really happy that we had connected and she seemed as excited as I was to have a new friend.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Maxwell was regularly in touch, Kate said, asking what she was up to, inquiring whether she was dating anybody and wondering whether \\u201canything exciting\\u201d was going on. Although Ms. Maxwell was significantly older, Kate said she seemed \\u201calmost like a schoolgirl,\\u201d adding: \\u201cEverything seemed to be a fun, silly joke.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Maxwell had told Kate about her boyfriend \\u2014 a \\u201cphilanthropist\\u201d who helped younger people. One day, Kate said, she arrived at Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s home to find Mr. Epstein there. Ms. Maxwell introduced her, saying: \\u201cThis is the girl that I told you about,\\u201d Kate told the jurors. Then, Kate said, Ms. Maxwell suggested she squeeze Mr. Epstein\\u2019s feet.\", \"Her first sexual contact with Mr. Epstein came soon afterward, in the \\u201cdimly lit\\u201d room. Similar scenes unfolded over years in London, Palm Beach and New York, Kate testified.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t know how to say no,\\u201d Kate said, explaining why she followed some of Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s directives, adding she did not know what the \\u201cconsequences\\u201d might be if she refused.\", \"Ms. Maxwell seemed to \\u201cknow everyone,\\u201d Kate testified, adding: \\u201cShe told me she was friends with Prince Andrew, friends with Donald Trump.\\u201d\", \"When a prosecutor asked Kate why she had kept communicating with Mr. Epstein after the abuse, she provided two answers. On one hand, Kate said, \\u201cI did not want to admit what had happened to me.\\u201d Beyond that, she said she wanted to be careful about \\u201cdisengaging.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI had witnessed how connected they both were.\\u201d\", \"A defense lawyer, Bobbi Sternheim had described Kate as an \\u201cambitious\\u201d former model and \\u201cjet setter\\u201d during her opening statement, adding that she had been eager to spend time with Ms. Maxwell and Mr. Epstein. Ms. Sternheim also said that Kate, a British citizen, was working with prosecutors to secure a visa.\", \"While being cross-examined by Ms. Sternheim, Kate denied that she was trying to get a particular type of visa reserved for people who have experienced abuse. She acknowledged, though, that at one point she had thought pursuing that type of visa would be in her interest.\", \"Ms. Sternheim also questioned whether Kate\\u2019s acknowledged abuse of alcohol, cocaine and sleeping pills could have affected her memory. Kate replied that she was not allowed to be drunk or use drugs while around Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell, and remembered the events she had described to the jury.\"]","href_hash":"58ee9d9056eb11ec8b8e25c00da31604"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"58ee9d9056eb11ec8b8e25c00da31604"}},
