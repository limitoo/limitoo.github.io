He loved his emotion-free existence, or so it seemed, until he met a vivacious woman who was his exact opposite \\u2014 impulsive and ardent. She became his wife and not only made him a happy man but also dramatically changed his personality. He became a feeling human being, which in turn affected his science.\", \"Yes, physics! If being logical and rational were all that mattered, we wouldn\\u2019t need actual physicists. The job could be done by computers. Later in life, Dirac became so convinced that knowledge needs to be combined with intuitions, crazy hunches and irrational perseverance that whenever he was asked about the secret to his success, he stressed that one needs to be guided above all by one\\u2019s emotions.\", \"Dirac\\u2019s case is one of many examples offered by Leonard Mlodinow in his latest book, which treats the mental impact of the emotions. To get an eloquent reminder of this impact is timely, given the stream of recent books paying one-sided attention to rationality and knowledge. We celebrate logic and reasoning and disparage the emotions, which we find too close to our bodies \\u2014 those flawed vessels of flesh and blood that carry us around and bother us with irresistible needs and urges. The \\u201cflesh is weak,\\u201d we say. Throughout history, great (male) thinkers have argued that while animals (and women) run after their emotions and impulses, the human mind is at its noblest when it transcends these. They proudly declared \\u201cman\\u201d the only rational being on the planet.\", \"Modern neuroscience and psychology, in contrast, teach that the ancient dichotomy between \\u201ccold\\u201d logic and \\u201chot\\u201d passion is as misleading as is the idea of a gender difference. Dirac obviously never lacked feelings, and men are guided by them just as much as are women. Nonmaterial, emotion-free minds are a figment of the imagination. \\u201cNo body, never mind,\\u201d wrote the neuroscientist Antonio Damasio. Since mind, brain and body are one, it\\u2019s impossible to disentangle our vaunted rationality from the emotions.\", \"It is interesting to see this argument being developed by a writer who started his career as a theoretical physicist. Mlodinow has written previous books with and about his late friend Stephen Hawking, and others that explained how randomness permeates our lives. With \\u201cEmotional,\\u201d he dives into a field that is clearly not his own. The result is a rather intellectualized version of the emotions without all of their bodily manifestations and long evolutionary history. Charles Darwin is duly mentioned, but we don\\u2019t read about some of the greats, such as the psychologist Paul Ekman or the neuroscientist Jaak Panksepp, who placed facial expressions and emotional brain circuitry in an evolutionary context. This isn\\u2019t Mlodinow\\u2019s focus.\", \"Those interested in understanding how feelings unconsciously steer thought, however, are in for a stimulating read. Mlodinow handles this topic astutely with compelling examples and attention to the latest research, which is quite spectacular. He writes in a brisk, friendly style that easily draws you in and makes you reflect on both the recounted anecdotes and your own way of handling comparable situations. In this regard, I found it a plus that the author came to this field from the outside. He wastes little time on the academic controversies of the day, such as whether or not feelings are culturally constructed, and turns instead to the basics, such as motivation, determination and the ill-defined concept of \\u201cemotional intelligence.\\u201d\", \"Since both of his parents survived German concentration camps during World War II, some of Mlodinow\\u2019s examples refer to this period of upheaval and horror. He relates, for example, how his emaciated father was liberated at Buchenwald by the U.S. Army, in 1945. The American soldiers generously handed out fresh water, cigarettes, chocolate and food to the starving prisoners. While his father\\u2019s friend Moshe couldn\\u2019t stop eating, and ended up consuming an entire salami, Mlodinow\\u2019s father managed to control himself. Within a couple of hours, Moshe suffered from intense intestinal distress. He died the next day. The author\\u2019s father survived thanks to his restraint.\", \"This story serves to introduce impulse control and why we so often fail at it, such as when we get addicted to gambling, gaming, smoking, pornography, and foods that are fattening and sweet. We allow companies to bombard us with technologically \\u201coptimized\\u201d foods that fool the human taste buds and reward system. They trigger uncontrollable cravings, leading to obesity, which contributes to deadly conditions like heart disease and diabetes. Clearly, the ways in which we handle our emotions have real-life consequences.\", \"Mlodinow is skilled in setting up topics with gripping anecdotes while subsequently fleshing them out by explaining recent scientific discoveries. Among them is the fact that a tiny brain region makes all the difference between whether we are determined to act or remain passive. It seems to serve as a \\u201cgrit switch.\\u201d Or there is the discovery that liking and wanting are not the same thing. They are controlled by different brain circuits. We want a particular pleasure only after we have determined that it is worthy and possible to pursue it. These discoveries make you think.\", \"Whereas emotions and desires arise automatically, they don\\u2019t necessarily tell us how to behave. This gives the emotions an enormous leg up over reflexive reactions and instincts. Other species, too, don\\u2019t just follow their impulses. Despite the common misperception that they lack self-regulation, every animal needs to be able to keep its emotional impulses in check while deciding on the best course of action. As the author repeatedly reminds us, emotions may urge us to behave this way or that, but most of the time we remain in control of the steering wheel.\", \"Toward the end, Mlodinow turns a corner that I found unnecessary and out of his league. His book all of a sudden heads for the self-help section. He produces questionnaires that allow us to rate ourselves on shame, anxiety, anger, joy and so on. He also offers recommendations on how to control our emotions, such as by trying to remove ourselves from a situation, take a walk, take deep breaths or let the passage of time calm us. Perhaps some readers will find his advice useful, but for me the value of this book is as a lively expos\\u00e9 of the growing consensus about the limited power of rationality and decision-making. They are never as free as we\\u2019ve made them out to be. They walk on the leash of ancient emotions.\"]","href_hash":"dd001eee6e2c11ecab3e7f2ef8c3bb6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dd001eee6e2c11ecab3e7f2ef8c3bb6f"}},
