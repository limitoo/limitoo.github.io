Zealand's Outdoors Party, which catalogued around 90 apparent medical emergencies among athletes in at least 20 countries.\", \"Many of the same names have been shared by Australian users of Facebook and Telegram, in lists featuring European footballers and teenage athletes in the US, among others.\", \"Fact Check has analysed a sample of these lists, finding they include deaths from heatstroke, on-field collision and apparent suicide, along with retired players, a golf caddie and other cases lacking any verifiable details.\", \"For numerous cases, it was not possible to draw conclusions about an athlete's medical condition from the publicly available information.\", \"Although news reports suggest multiple athletes have indeed suffered from heart problems, experts told Fact Check that such cases were not uncommon among athletes, and were not on the rise.\", \"Andre La Gerche, the Baker Institute's head of sports cardiology, explained that sudden cardiac arrest, or SCA, often hits people without any history of heart problems.\", \"\\\"Nearly half the time, we have no idea why, even after an autopsy,\\\" he said, noting that this would usually reveal whether myocarditis was a factor.\", \"(Myocarditis is a relatively rare and typically mild side-effect of mRNA vaccines, which causes inflammation of the heart muscle).\", \"Rates vary depending on age, but Dr La Gerche said SCA affects about 1 in 50,000 athletes aged 30 and under, and that, for any age group, it causes three to five times more deaths than car accidents.\", \"\\\"So the inference that those cases are somehow due to the vaccine is wrong, because that has been happening well before [the pandemic],\\\" he said, adding that in Victoria, data from paramedics showed no increase in these incidents.\", \"Still, Dr La Gerche said he expected to see more cases of vaccine-related myocarditis in athletes, simply because young men, who are more likely to experience this side-effect, are also statistically more likely to be athletes.\", \"In the US, the Outcomes Registry for Cardiac Conditions in Athletes is tracking heart conditions among college athletes during the pandemic.\", \"Dr Jonathan Drezner, one of the register's principal investigators, told Fact Check there \\\"has not been an increase in sudden cardiac arrest or death in young athletes\\\".\", \"He labelled the lists as \\\"misinformation and wrong\\\", adding that the risk of heart problems from COVID-19 (1:200) was 100 times greater than that of vaccine-related myocarditis (1:20,000), and that he knew of just two cases of SCA linked to the disease.\", \"Meanwhile, AFP Fact Check has\\u00a0debunked posts on German social media\\u00a0claiming to show a steep rise in sudden cardiac deaths among footballers in Europe.\", \"AFP's analysis of data from the international football federation's (FIFA) Sudden Death Registry showed that, for the year to date, there had been proportionally fewer deaths from heart attack than in 2018, while experts said using social media lists to make comparisons with previous years was meaningless without standardised methodology.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">In other news:

that climate change misinformation largely falls into five categories, allowing researchers to train a machine-learning model to automatically detect bad information.\", \"The report, published in Nature, examined climate messaging and constructed a detailed history of climate change contrarianism between 1998 and 2020, based on 255,449 documents from 20 prominent conservative think tanks and 33 central contrarian blogs.\", \"According to the report, climate myths followed five identifiable themes: it's not real, it's not us, it's not bad, solutions won't work, and climate science is unreliable.\", \"The researchers found that climate contrarianism messaging had shifted over time, with \\\"it's not bad\\\" being the dominant message in 2000. As climate change science became more prominent and undeniable, \\\"solutions won't work\\\" messaging took hold, giving way by 2020 to claims that the \\\"climate science is unreliable\\\".\", \"The study also found that climate misinformation narratives repeated themselves over time.\", \"In an email,\\u00a0John Cook, a postdoctoral research fellow with the Monash Climate Change Communication Research Hub and one of the study's authors, explained: \\\"The argument goes that global warming stopped in 2016, by plotting temperature trends from the record hot year in 2016. It's exactly the same misleading technique as 'global warming stopped in 1998' that was used prior to 2016.\\\"\", \"He added that the past helped to predict future messaging.\", \"\\\"Our data shows that when you apply a certain stimuli (for example, introduction of climate legislation), you see spikes in certain types of misinformation (eg, arguing climate policy is harmful),\\\" Dr Cook said.\", \"\\\"This predictability makes it possible to anticipate future surges in climate misinformation such as in the lead up to a COP event.\\\"\", \"Dr Cook also revealed that he had been working with Facebook on addressing climate misinformation for the last year and had been talking to the social media behemoth about this machine-learning research.\\\"Facebook has been using the taxonomy we developed in this study with it's five main categories to inform how they choose myths to fact-check (to make sure they get myths across the different categories).\", \"\\\"We have also collaborated with them on detecting specific climate misinformation claims using their own methods.\\\"\", \"Edited by Ellen McCutchan\\u00a0with thanks to David Campbell, Matt Harvey and Olivia Thomson\", \"Got a fact that needs checking?
