This might sound like a trivial anachronism. But it\\u2019s typical of the movie\\u2019s attitude toward nostalgia, which relishes references at the expense of inconsistencies. In one moment the adolescent heroes are brandishing a 1989 Billy Ripken Fleer card; in the next they\\u2019re navigating the Cabbage Patch Kids craze, which happened in 1983. It\\u2019s as if a decade\\u2019s blurry reminiscence has been flattened into an indefinite, sentimental mush.\", \"When it isn\\u2019t fawning over roller rinks, \\u201cGoonies\\u201d posters, and Casio watches, \\u201c8 Bit Christmas\\u201d (streaming on HBO Max) is a warm and refreshingly earnest holiday comedy. The director, Michael Dowse, gets good, grounded comic performances out of his child actors (especially Max Malas as a charming perennial fibber named Jeff), as well as a surprisingly rich turn from Steve Zahn, who, between this and \\u201cThe White Lotus,\\u201d is doing some of the best work of his career lately. The dynamic between loving, outdoorsy Zahn and his Nintendo-obsessed son (Winslow Fegley) is the heart of the film, and \\u2014 when they\\u2019re not debating the merits of 8-bit video game consoles \\u2014 their relationship is poignant, tender and quite affecting. But the film is continually distracted by period hallmarks, and while it might have been compelling, its boomboxes and Trapper Keepers get in the way.\"]","href_hash":"e04a39db4d3a11eca9be31f7286bb75e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e04a39db4d3a11eca9be31f7286bb75e"}},
