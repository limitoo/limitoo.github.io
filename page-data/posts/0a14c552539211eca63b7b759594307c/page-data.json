A news anchor announces at one point that Santa might be quarantined, but then he shows proof of vaccination to a border control agent, inspiring cheers.\", \"\\u201cWhile we understand that some people disagree with the vaccine program and may find the ad in poor taste, we have concluded that the ad is unlikely to be seen as irresponsible or cause serious or widespread offense on the basis suggested,\\u201d Mr. King said.\", \"Tesco said in a statement the ad takes \\u201ca lighthearted view on how the nation is feeling.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe are still in the midst of a pandemic and the advert reflects the current rules and regulations regarding international travel,\\u201d the company said.\", \"Amid concerns about a new coronavirus variant, Omicron, Britain has barred travelers from 10 African countries, required face masks in shops and on public transportation and accelerated its rollout of vaccine booster shots, hoping to vaccinate every adult by the end of next month.\", \"Earlier this year, another vaccine-related ad prompted a review by the Advertising Standards Authority. In late December, when vaccine rollouts were in their early stages, the Irish budget airline Ryanair began running commercials proclaiming \\u201cvaccines are coming\\u201d and showing young vacationers without masks or social distancing with text urging customers to \\u201cjab and go!\\u201d\", \"The ad generated 2,370 complaints from viewers who felt that it was misleading, offensive and irresponsible, and that it implied that the majority of Britons would be successfully vaccinated by summer (more than half of people ages 12 and older were fully vaccinated by the first week of June). The Advertising Standards Authority banned the ads.\", \"The Tesco holiday ad drew the second-highest number of complaints in the agency\\u2019s history. The leader is a commercial from 2014, in which the betting company Paddy Power took bets on the outcome of the murder trial of Oscar Pistorius, the Olympic sprinter who was eventually convicted of killing his girlfriend. The ad attracted 5,500 complaints and was banned.\"]","href_hash":"0a14c552539211eca63b7b759594307c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0a14c552539211eca63b7b759594307c"}},
