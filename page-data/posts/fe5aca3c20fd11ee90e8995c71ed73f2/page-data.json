The teams were not able to effectively check the data,\\\" it said.\", \"The report said the 12 indicators did not provide meaningful data for the public because some of it was difficult to understand without explanation and some was only useful if viewed over longer time periods such as every quarter.\", \"It said Te Whatu Ora did not have the capability to support monthly reporting and the work required would be better used elsewhere.\", \"\\\"Local data teams are overwhelmed with data demands, do not have sufficient capacity to meet increased demand and do not have a framework/guidance to enable them to prioritise their work.\\\"\", \"The report also criticised Te Whatu Ora for its handling of data about M\\u0101ori.\", \"\\\"The inherent rights and interests that M\\u0101ori have in relation to the collection, ownership and application of M\\u0101ori data are not recognised in a clear reporting framework and in all performance reporting,\\\" it said.\", \"One of the errors that sparked the review happened because an extra line was included when data was extracted to a spreadsheet, the report said.

Te Whatu Ora is combining processes and systems from 29 organisations, and the review has been an opportunity to better understand data collection and validation.
