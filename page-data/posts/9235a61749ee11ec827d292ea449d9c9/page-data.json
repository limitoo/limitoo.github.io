City leaders advised health providers on Monday that they should not turn away adults seeking a booster shot, provided enough time had passed since they were first vaccinated.\", \"A spokesman for Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday that 732,000 adults had received booster shots so far in New York City.\", \"\\u201cLet\\u2019s get that number up a lot more, particularly as we\\u2019re getting ready for the colder months,\\u201d Mr. de Blasio said this week. \\u201cThat\\u2019s how we fight back Covid in the colder months, and that\\u2019s how we get ready for something wonderful: the holidays.\\u201d\", \"Here\\u2019s what you need to know about getting a coronavirus booster shot in New York City.\", \"The F.D.A. on Friday authorized Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna boosters for all adults, provided it has been at least six months after they completed the initial two-dose regimen. Then the C.D.C. endorsed the boosters later on Friday, after its panel of independent experts recommended them.\", \"All adults who received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine are also eligible for a booster, so long as it has been at least two months since they received the shot.\", \"New Yorkers can get booster shots at a number of places, including pop-up vans and buses, churches, local pharmacies, community health clinics and even at home.\", \"To stay updated on the rotating schedule for pop-up and mobile sites, head to the city\\u2019s Vaccine Command Center.\", \"Appointments can be booked through the city\\u2019s vaccine finder website, drugstore websites like Walgreens or family physicians.\", \"You can call 877-VAX-4NYC to find city-run vaccination sites, get a ride to your appointment if you\\u2019re older or have a disability and get help scheduling a free in-home visit. Home visits can also be scheduled via this form.\", \"On the vaccine finder website, you can choose the type of booster you want to receive and the location that\\u2019s most convenient for you. The website will ask you when you received your last vaccine shot in order to verify that you are eligible for a booster.\", \"Many adults have been able to make appointments easily and haven\\u2019t had to deal with long lines or waits, unlike when the vaccine first became available.\", \"Walk-in booster shots are available at many city-run sites as well.\", \"Adults can \\u201cmix and match\\u201d their booster shots, which means they don\\u2019t necessarily have to choose the same brand of the vaccine that they initially received. There is some evidence that mixing vaccines produces a stronger immune response.\", \"A booster shot is just one tool used to slow the spread of the coronavirus, but it is an effective one, said Dr. Denis Nash, a professor of epidemiology for the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s debate in the scientific community about where we can get the biggest impact on public health,\\u201d Dr. Nash said. \\u201cIs it through boosters? Is it through emphasizing that first shot for people who haven\\u2019t had anything, especially for the young folks who just became eligible for vaccines? Is it in the realm of testing and trying to improve the availability of tests?\\u201d\", \"Dr. Nash said there was an argument to be made for each of those measures. He added that researchers were confident that people over 65 and those with comorbidities should receive booster shots, and that researchers were still collecting evidence on the impact of giving boosters to all adults.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t know for sure, but it could be that if we have more people get the boosters now and then have a surge, we will be glad we did it,\\u201d said Mr. Nash, pointing to what\\u2019s happening in the United Kingdom and Germany, where there are significant increases in coronavirus cases despite high vaccination rates.\", \"Coronavirus cases in New York City have been on the rise recently, according to a New York Times database: The daily case average stood at 1,240 on Thursday, which is 17 percent higher than it was two weeks ago. Average hospitalizations fell 12 percent over the same time period.\", \"Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, supported New York City\\u2019s earlier decision to broaden the eligibility for booster shots, saying that the conflicting information around the shots may be perplexing for some people.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s all this confusion about who should get a booster, when should you get a booster, what kind of booster,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think what New York City is doing is really following the evidence, and the evidence is that really everybody benefits from a booster.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9235a61749ee11ec827d292ea449d9c9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9235a61749ee11ec827d292ea449d9c9"}},
