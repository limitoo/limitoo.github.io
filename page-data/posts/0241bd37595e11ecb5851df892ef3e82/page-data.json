The video appears to have been taken just after Alexander gave his committee deposition.\", \"In the video, Alexander and his lawyers refuse to take the papers. However, the server follows the men to their ride-share vehicle. He then places the papers inside the vehicle and announces that the papers have been duly served. The civil suit's details were unclear.\", \"Alexander arrived for his deposition with his lawyer Joseph McBride and conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl, according to CNN. He also gave members of the media a copy of the opening statement he planned on making to the committee.\", \"\\\"I had nothing to do with any violence or lawbreaking that happened on January 6,\\\" his statement read. \\\"I had nothing to do with the planning. I had nothing to do with the preparation. And I had nothing to do with the execution. Any suggestion to the contrary is factually false.\\\"\", \"He said that videos from the January 6 Capitol riots showed that members of the \\\"Stop the Steal\\\" rally had tried to stop people from being violent or entering the Capitol building.\", \"\\\"I went from living the American Dream to experiencing an American Nightmare where my skin color, birth name, party affiliation, ability to earn a living, belief that Christ is King, and concerns about election irregularities have been weaponized against me,\\\" Alexander's statement continued. \\\"But I can assure you I have nothing to hide because I've done nothing wrong.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948933/ali-alexander-stop-steal-january-6-committee.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Ali Alexander, an organizer of the January 6 \\\"Stop the Steal\\\" rally, has been served with a civil suit after meeting with the congressional January 6 committee.
