I hope Virginians will join me in wishing the best to him and his family,\\\" McAuliffe said in a statement.\", \"Exit polls indicated that just over half of voters said parents should have \\\"a lot\\\" of say in what is taught in their child's school. In the final weeks of the campaign, Youngkin capitalized on McAuliffe's response during a debate on whether parents should be able to opt their children out of reading certain books if they disapprove of the content.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach,\\\" McAuliffe said. Youngkin quoted McAuliffe repeatedly on the campaign trail and in ads. It resonated with Youngkin's supporters \\u2014 8 in 10 think they should have \\\"a lot\\\" of say in their children's schooling. Only a quarter of McAuliffe voters agreed. Pre-election polls found this issue energized many Republicans. Slightly more Youngkin voters selected education as their top issue, compared to McAuliffe backers.\\u00a0\", \"Democrats could at least count victories in heavily blue New York City and Boston, although a Democrat had been guaranteed to win in Boston since both candidates on the ballot were Democrats. The Associated Press projected Michelle Wu won in Boston, making her the first Asian American and the first woman to lead the city. In New York City, Democrat Eric Adams gave a heartfelt victory speech, proclaiming \\\"I am you\\\" as he said \\\"I want you to believe again. Let's bring this city back.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"In Minneapolis, voters rejected a ballot measure that would have dismantled the police department and created a new Department of Public Safety. In the city's mayoral race, embattled incumbent Jacob Frey led in the first round of ranked-choice voting, according to the Minnesota Secretary of State's office.\\u00a0\", \"In Buffalo, incumbent Mayor Byron Brown, who lost the Democratic primary to democratic socialist India Walton, ran a write-in campaign against Walton. A poll last week by CBS Buffalo affiliate WIVB had Brown leading by 17 points, and he appeared to be leading by 10,000 votes as of Tuesday night, according to WIVB.\\u00a0\", \"Clare Hymes, Adam Brewster and Aaron Navarro contributed reporting.\"]","href_hash":"3cb8632c3d6411ec8836000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3cb8632c3d6411ec8836000017025a03"}},
