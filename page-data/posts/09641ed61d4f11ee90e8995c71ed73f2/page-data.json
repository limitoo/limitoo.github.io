This will be very challenging given the many hectares of caulerpa involved, but these trials are geared towards that.\\\"\", \"It was hoped experts from California would visit the country early next month to provide first-hand insights about using suction dredge techniques to remove caulerpa.\", \"Ng\\u0101ti Manuhiri Settlement Trust's chief executive Nicola MacDonald said the trust was committed to eradicating the pest.\", \"Walsh said exotic caulerpa was challenging to deal with.\", \"\\\"Internationally, caulerpa has not been successfully eradicated from areas the size of the finds in New Zealand, and climate change and warming oceans also present a tough biosecurity challenge for everyone.\\\"\", \"He appealed to people to be vigilant by keeping boats and other aquatic equipment clean to reduce the risk of introducing or spreading any exotic seaweeds.\", \"\\\"Check your gear, especially anchors and chains. If you see any seaweed on your equipment, chuck it straight back in the waters it came from.\\\"\", \"Anyone who saw exotic caulerpa was asked to note the location, take a photo and report it to Biosecurity New Zealand on 0800 80 99 66 or online at report.mpi.govt.nz\"]","href_hash":"09641ed61d4f11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"09641ed61d4f11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
