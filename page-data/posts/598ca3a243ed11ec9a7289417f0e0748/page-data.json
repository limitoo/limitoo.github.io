He'll start in the position when the new legislative session begins, according to AP.\", \"\\\"This is truly a humbling experience, that a poor kid from Linden raised by a single mom could one day be selected as the Senate president-elect is really awe inspiring, and it is a true testament that the American dream is alive and well here in New Jersey,\\\" Scutari said after he was selected.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931661/scutari-picked-nj-senate-leader.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Democrats in the New Jersey Senate picked state Senator Nicholas Scutari on Friday to be their new leader after current President Steve Sweeney lost reelection to a Republican newcomer.

Still, Democratic Governor Phil Murphy won reelection by nearly 3 points over his GOP challenger, Jack Ciattarelli, and has said he will continue to pursue the progressive policy goals he adopted in his first term.\", \"Scutari has served in the Senate since 2004 and currently leads the powerful Judiciary Committee, which oversees hearings for the governor's appointments to courts, boards and other offices across the state. He is known for championing the legalization of recreational marijuana, which he shepherded through the Legislature this year.\", \"Sweeney said this week that he won't be fading from politics, but he stopped short of saying whether he would run again for the Senate or pursue the governorship in 2025.
