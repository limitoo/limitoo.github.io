To that end, we\\u2019ve enlisted two experts \\u2014 one familiar with the ins and outs of New York\\u2019s professional football teams, the other a nationally focused football analyst \\u2014 to answer an essential question as a weekly service to readers: Are the Jets good yet?\", \"Devin Gordon, the author of \\u201cSo Many Ways to Lose: The Amazin\\u2019 True Story of the New York Mets, the Best Worst Team in Sports,\\u201d observed the Jets from a locally focused perspective.\", \"Diante Lee, an N.F.L. analyst at Pro Football Focus, offered a national view.\", \"The Jets (2-5) ended their first-quarter scoring drought and finished a 34-31 win over the Cincinnati Bengals (5-3) in the victory formation.\", \"Who is Mike White? Your level of interest in the answer to this question should go a long way toward determining your current level of interest in the Jets. White: fifth-round pick of the Dallas Cowboys in the 2018 draft, 171st overall, out of Western Kentucky; cut by the Jets four times; had never taken a snap before this season; now a minor folk hero at MetLife Stadium.\", \"White is currently the Jets\\u2019 starting quarterback, and based on his performance on Sunday against the Cincinnati Bengals \\u2014 11 consecutive completions to start the game, more than 400 yards passing, three touchdown tosses \\u2014 he seems likely to keep the job until the team\\u2019s opening week starter, Zach Wilson, can return from a knee injury.\", \"White finished a storybook afternoon by catching the victory-sealing 2-point conversion on a bit of gutsy late trickery and gave the Jets one of this season\\u2019s unlikeliest victories, over the A.F.C. North-leading Bengals. White was poised and efficient all afternoon, completing 37 of his 45 attempts, and he made the Jets\\u2019 rookie playmakers, running back Michael Carter and wide receiver Elijah Moore, look like legitimate scoring weapons.\", \"It was such a special afternoon for the Jets, in fact, that it was easy to ignore the elephant in the room \\u2014 the suddenly urgent question that today\\u2019s offensive explosion raises for the remainder of the season: Who, exactly, is Zach Wilson?\", \"Verdict: The Jets are almost as interesting as the quarterback competition on the sideline.\", \"We\\u2019re all in for a conundrum: The Jets, strange as it may sound, are 2-5 now, and none of their games really matter.\", \"Just for a moment, let\\u2019s indulge in a little hot take artist cosplay and look at the team\\u2019s fake quarterback controversy.\", \"The Jets beat the Bengals, 34-31, at home to move a game ahead of the 1-6 Houston Texans, who have the worst record in the A.F.C. Mike White joined Cam Newton as the only quarterbacks to throw for more than 400 yards in their starting debuts, and White\\u2019s play in the fourth quarter on Sunday saved the Jets\\u2019 porous defense from blowing the game.\", \"One can almost hear the talking heads of the sports radio universe warming up for hours of discussion about whether the Jets\\u2019 offense had \\u201crallied around\\u201d White. Maybe White, a fourth-year backup, \\u201ccommanded the huddle\\u201d in a way that the rookie Zach Wilson had not. After all, the passing game was white hot to start, with each of the Jets\\u2019 first 14 passes caught, including a couple by Bengals defenders.\", \"For the first time this year, the Jets\\u2019 offense scored a touchdown in the first quarter, and their 34 points on Sunday were the most they have managed in a single game this season: 30 percent of their 2021 scoring.\", \"Four of the Jets\\u2019 next five games are against opponents with records below .500. Their odds of repeating (or bettering) Sunday\\u2019s performance depend more on that fact than whether White or Wilson is throwing.\", \"Verdict: For Halloween, the Jets dressed up as a competent offense.\"]","href_hash":"da4b8d463c2211eca0ae000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"da4b8d463c2211eca0ae000017025a03"}},
