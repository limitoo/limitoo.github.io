He and his mother volunteer with an eye toward bringing students materials that feel relevant to them, through an initiative called the Black Is Beautiful Book Project.\", \"\\u201cI remember my first book with a Black character. \\u2018Amazing Grace\\u2019 was the first book I received as a kid that had a Black character in it,\\u201d Ms. Peoples said. \\u201cThat made me very excited to read a book. And so for my son, I wanted him to have that same experience where he can get excited to see someone that looks like him.\\u201d\", \"The Black Is Beautiful Book Project is one of several Leaders Readers Network projects to promote literacy through representation, an issue enforced by the teachers the organization works with. The network collaborated with First Book, a beneficiary of The New York Times\\u2019s Neediest Cases Fund, as part of First Book\\u2019s Stories for All project, which promotes the publishing and selling of diverse titles.\", \"\\u201cSometimes publishers wouldn\\u2019t be making those books to begin with, and we\\u2019re able to come in and say that we have teachers who are asking for these books,\\u201d said Ian Kenison, a spokesman for First Book, in reference to books with protagonists of color and bilingual works. \\u201cIt shows the publishers how sought-after these books really are.\\u201d\", \"Leaders Readers was awarded $20,000 in Neediest Cases money as part of a matching grant through First Book to support projects that highlight topics such as the Tuskegee Airmen and the Little Rock Nine.\", \"\\u201cLiteracy equity is so important for students to develop that love of reading,\\u201d said Chris McGilvery, the founder and executive director of the Leaders Readers Network. \\u201cThere was the need for students to learn about other students\\u2019 cultures, and a need for students to see themselves.\\u201d\", \"Veronica Liu, the founder of Word Up Community Bookshop in Washington Heights, has heard the calls for bilingual books and stories with diverse protagonists loud and clear.\", \"\\u201cWhat comes up a lot is what kind of access is there to the things that the community wants to read,\\u201d Ms. Liu said.\", \"Ms. Liu stocks multilingual works relating to the issues faced in her community, which is primarily Black and Latino. Her store is one of the local, minority-owned bookstores from which Children\\u2019s Aid, another beneficiary of The Fund, bought books this year for its annual Reading on the Rug series.\", \"When the early childhood programs team at Children\\u2019s Aid saw in December that children ages 2 to 4 were struggling in language and literacy, it kicked off the new year with focused programming, and its annual Reading on the Rug series in March was incorporated into the effort.\", \"The series began in 2017, spearheaded by Adriana Alba, who works on early childhood programs at Children\\u2019s Aid. Ms. Alba sees reading and language skills as vital to the team\\u2019s work, and the series reinforces that by bringing underrepresented authors and illustrators to the centers she manages in Harlem, the South Bronx and Washington Heights, as well as on Staten Island.\", \"\\u201cOur population is very immigrant heavy. We\\u2019re in neighborhoods that are dealing with poverty and systemic racism,\\u201d Ms. Alba said. \\u201cFinding a way to introduce kiddos to people that look like them and stories that validated the things that they were going through on a daily basis was something really important to me.\\u201d\", \"This year, Children\\u2019s Aid bought copies of the books featured in the programming for each child, using $11,136 in Neediest Cases money. It also started a lending library and worked closely with parents to promote best practices in reading.\", \"So when Nelly L\\u00f3pez\\u2019s daughter Norismar, 4, began bringing books home, Ms. L\\u00f3pez was both prepared and excited. Ms. L\\u00f3pez, who moved to Washington Heights from the Dominican Republic in 2019 with her husband and two daughters, speaks Spanish.\", \"While she was unable to read the English-language books herself, Ms. L\\u00f3pez, 41, had attended a virtual bilingual lesson with Children\\u2019s Aid and knew how to engage her daughter.\", \"\\u201cThey were highly illustrated books with a lot of symbolism,\\u201d she said, adding that she felt she was able to help Norismar with the books.\", \"By May, Children\\u2019s Aid said, the children enrolled in the programming had improved significantly in meeting national standards for language and literacy.\", \"Akia Wells, whose daughter also participated in the program, credits the Children\\u2019s Aid campaign with her daughter\\u2019s rapid development. Ms. Wells said her daughter, Akianti, 4, could now do more than use the pictures to read. \\u201cShe\\u2019s actually reading the words,\\u201d said Ms. Wells, 44.\", \"Ms. Wells was able to watch at home as Akianti and some classmates engaged with their teachers and guests speakers through the virtual lessons (others were in person). Akianti\\u2019s lessons included a reading by the writer and photographer Charles Smith Jr. from his book \\u201cI Am America.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe author was able to read their book and express themselves,\\u201d Ms. Wells said, \\u201cand it allowed the kids to be able to do the same thing.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"92a2f5683d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"92a2f5683d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}},
