Three months after Madeleine vanished, specially trained sniffer dogs were flown in to scour the family's vacation rental. \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Traces of blood were detected inside the apartment and in the trunk of the McCann's rental car. \\u00a0\", \"Partial samples of the blood were recovered and sent to a British lab for DNA testing, but the results indicated that the blood found in the apartment did not belong to Madeleine and the results from the DNA in the rental car were inconclusive. \\u00a0\", \"Jim Gamble: Well I've seen the letter from the forensic science lab. \\u2026\\u202fThe forensic tests \\u2026 didn't say, this\\u202fDNA\\u202fis Madeleine McCann's.\\u202f\\u2026 Because actually, the full analysis of that \\u2026 says that up that up to half the forensic scientists in the lab would have had similar DNA characteristics. It was not a complete DNA sample.\\u00a0\", \"What's more \\u2026\\u00a0\", \"Jim Gamble: The car wasn't actually retained by the McCann's until weeks after Madeleine had gone missing. \\u2026 And if you are to believe that Madeleine was in the boot of the car, they must have either killed her and/or hidden her sometime earlier, recovered her body whilst the media were surveilling them, hidden it in the car \\u2026 then moved it to a place where they could dispose of it, where no one could see that happen, and then bring the car back. It just doesn't add up. The forensics don't add up.\\u00a0\", \"And yet, four months after Madeleine vanished, Portuguese police declared the McCanns \\\"arguidos\\\"\\u2014 suspects in their own daughter's disappearance. \\u00a0\", \"Peter Van Sant: The enormous media coverage in this, do you believe in some ways that pressured Portuguese authorities to say, we have our real suspects?

Of course.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"48 Hours\\\" reached out to the Portuguese police for comment, but they did not reply. \\u00a0\", \"Jim Gamble: The McCanns should have been suspects day one, minute one, hour one. And I don't believe for one second the McCanns committed this crime. But what I'm saying is \\u2026 Your attention should be, first of all, to look at the parents and actually to rule them in or rule them out - not to wait until your months down the line where you have exhausted all of your other ideas, and to then say, \\\"Well, actually, it must be the parents.\\\" Because that's not fair on anyone.\\u00a0\", \"Surprisingly, almost immediately after being declared suspects, the McCanns were allowed to fly to the U.K., returning home for the first time without their daughter.\\u00a0\", \"GERRY MCCANN [statement at airport, 2007]: We have played no part in the disappearance of our lovely daughter, Madeleine.\", \"Kate McCann told her family that Portuguese investigators had pressured her to sign a confession, in which she was to admit that Madeleine had died accidentally, and that Madeleine's disappearance had been staged. Kate refused. \\\"48 Hours\\\" spoke to Kate's mother in 2007.\\u00a0\", \"SUSAN HEALEY [2007 interview]: Kate said, \\\"Why \\u2014 why would I sign that confession?\\\" you know. \\u2026 If an accident had happened, Madeleine had fallen, Kate and Gerry wouldn't have hidden that. \\u00a0\", \"Peter Van Sant: When the McCanns were named as suspects in Portugal, were they seen as suspects in the U.K. as well? \\u00a0\", \"Jane Hill: I'm sure there were people in the U.K. who did think that they had some involvement. And that was reflected particularly in the British tabloid press.\\u00a0\", \"Some British newspapers began running unsubstantiated, sensational storylines.\\u00a0\", \"Jim Gamble: And what happened \\u2026 is, the war of the tabloids began to take place.\\u00a0\", \"The onslaught of wild accusations continued for months, effectively portraying the McCanns as killers.\\u00a0\", \"Jim Gamble: And then you get the armchair detectives. \\u2026 With social media you've got the geeks, freaks and morons. \\u2026 But when you've got this world of bile being created online, then people continually feed it. \\u00a0\", \"It wasn't until the following summer, in July 2008, that Portuguese investigators cleared the McCanns.

But the police contacted Christian B. \\u2026 and there was nothing found to investigate it any longer.\", \"While it didn't pan out, just one year later he was back on police radar. According to documents obtained by \\\"48 Hours,\\\" in 2014, 391 photo files and 68 video files of child pornography were confiscated from Brueckner's home while he was living in Braunschweig.\\u00a0 During this time, he was also charged with sexually abusing a 5-year-old. He was sentenced to 15 months in prison for committing both offenses. \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"But before serving his sentence, he fled once again to Portugal. \\u00a0\", \"Mark Hofmann: If I look at his life and criminal record, it seems a little bit like he was always fleeing and trying to escape law enforcement. So, whenever he committed a crime, whenever he was investigated in connection with some crimes, he left the country. \\u00a0\", \"Brueckner would later be extradited to Germany once again to serve his sentence.\", \"And then, if there is a house of horrors in this tragic mystery it may be a deserted factory deep in the woods of Saxony Anhalt, Germany, that Christian Brueckner once owned.\", \"In 2016 investigators conducted multiple searches of this property. \\\"48 Hours\\\" has learned these searches were part of a broader investigation into child pornography. \\u00a0And what they found was troubling. \\u00a0\", \"Mark Hofmann: Law enforcement confirmed that they found at least three girl's swimsuits in his camper van. So, of course, you need to ask the question, who do these swimsuits belong to? \\u00a0\", \"Investigators have not revealed if they know the answer.\\u00a0 But that's not all they found.\", \"Mark Hofmann: On this property they found \\u2026 USB drives containing \\u2026 pictures and videos, including videos and pictures of child abuse.\\u00a0 And also, videos which he produced himself. \\u00a0\\u2026 And these USB drives were in a plastic bag buried under his dead dog in the ground. \\u00a0\", \"It seems that Brueckner had a long fascination with recording his crimes. \\u00a0In 2018, a witness came forward saying they had seen a videotape from 2005 of Brueckner raping a 72-year-old American woman at her home in Portugal. Up until then, the attacker's identity had not been known. \\u00a0\", \"Mark Hofmann: This was not just rape. This was the most brutal form of rape I ever heard of. \\u00a0\", \"That assault had taken place close to the Ocean Club and 2 years before Madeleine McCann disappeared. Brueckner was charged and convicted for these crimes in 2019. His DNA matched DNA found at the scene. \\u00a0 \\u00a0\", \"Mark Hofmann:\\u00a0He is definitely a bad guy. He's definitely a psychopath. And he is definitely a full-time criminal. \\u2026 But the question is \\u2026 is he really guilty in the Maddie McCann case? \\u00a0\", \"Wolters will not reveal details about his current investigation into Christian Brueckner, but he is adamant about one thing.\", \"Hans Christian Wolters: We're sure that Christian B. murdered Madeleine McCann because of the evidence we have. \\u00a0\", \"Peter Van Sant: And may I speculate that that evidence may include photographs or video of Maddie McCann? \\u00a0\", \"Hans Christian Wolters: You may speculate. But I'm not allowed to tell you if you are right or if you are wrong. \\u00a0 \\u00a0\", \"But despite the evidence he says he has, Wolters admits he needs more of it in order to charge Brueckner. \\u00a0\", \"Hans Christian Wolters: And in Germany, we \\u2026 charge someone only if we are sure that he will be sentenced by the court. If there are doubts \\u2026 we don't charge him. \\u00a0\", \"Wolters says one key piece of evidence they need is to find the person who made that call to Brueckner's cellphone approximately one hour before Madeleine disappeared on May 3, 2007.\\u00a0\", \"Mark Hofmann: This might be the only person who could confirm that indeed, Christian B. was holding his cellphone \\u2026 in his hand that night. \\u2026 And this would be proof that not just his cellphone was at the crime scene, but that he was at the crime scene. \\u00a0\", \"Although investigators made an appeal to the public, they have been unable to identify the mystery caller.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Hans Christian Wolters: The phone which was used for the call to Christian B. was a prepaid phone. \\u2026 So, we are not able to find this person in an easy way.\\u00a0\", \"The McCanns have not commented on Christian Brueckner, but on \\u00a0their website they posted: \\\"We will never give up hope of finding Madeleine alive but whatever the outcome may be, we need to know as we need to find peace.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Meanwhile, Brueckner has remained silent behind prison walls where he is serving a 7-year sentence for raping that 72-year-old American woman.
