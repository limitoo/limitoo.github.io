inconvenient or, in some instances, just straight out stressful.\", \"Instead, many are now turning to new online subscription services that allow people to get new scripts online and the pill delivered to their door.\", \"Gloria, who didn't want to use her real name, signed up last year during the first wave of COVID outbreaks.\", \"\\\"I felt uncomfortable going into a doctor's surgery and waiting for a script when I didn't really need to be seeing a doctor for that, when I knew what I needed and it wasn't going to be any different from what I was on already,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"So I had a bit of a Google and came across this pill subscription service and thought I'd give it a go.\", \"These kinds of services are also available overseas, but have only popped up in Australia in the past year and a half.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How do these services work?</div>\", \"Firstly, they won't provide a script for the pill to a woman who's either never been on one before or has had serious side effects, instead they refer women to have a face-to-face consult with a GP.\", \"If a woman is eligible, though, they're directed to an online questionnaire where they answer questions a doctor usually ask like their heigh, weight, whether they smoke, what their blood pressure is if they know it and any family history of medical conditions.\", \"Then a GP who works for the service reviews the answers and the woman has an online conversation about the kind of pill she's on or has taken before, and what she wants going forward.\", \"<img

delivered has been a \\\"life saver\\\".(Supplied)</div>\", \"\\\"I think I had expected some dodgy chat bot\\u00a0but it's an excellent user experience \\u2026 and after the year or so that I've been using it\\u00a0I feel pretty confident that if something felt wrong or if I wasn't quite sure about what to do I could contact them and they'd immediately put me at ease,\\\" Gloria said.\", \"As well as the potential advantage during the pandemic, the services are also useful for women who live in regional and remote Australia \\u2014 like station hand Lucy Capel \\u2014 who can't easily access a doctor or pharmacy.\", \"Ms Capel lives on an outback station in a remote area on the Gulf of Carpentaria in north Queensland, where the nearest GP is a three-hour drive away.\", \"\\\"The pill is pretty important, you want to make sure you're protected and\\u00a0living out here, in terms of living so remotely, we have a wet season up here so for three to five months of the year you can't get into town [and]\\u00a0seeing a doctor would literally be impossible, going to a pharmacy \\u2014 don't even think about it,\\\" she said.\", \"For Gloria, previous bad experiences with GPs when she's gone to get the pill has also made the online alternative much more attractive.\", \"\\\"There is a sense of judgement that I have felt and I know friends of mine have felt,\\\" she said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Removing awkward pharmacy trips</div>\", \"Nic Blair is the founder of a service that launched this year\\u00a0and said the uptake from women had showed there was demand for alternative options.\", \"\\\"The feedback has not only been positive but it's also validated that the problem's we're trying to solve have existed and the service is actually meeting those demands and needs to, I guess, make people's lives more comfortable and their healthcare experience better,\\\" he said.\", \"As well as the pill, Mr Blair's service also allows people to order and have delivered pharmacy-only medication like the morning after pill and treatments for thrush.\", \"\\\"It's also providing a discrete platform for people to be able to access the treatments they need without the fear of judgement or facing an awkward conversation with a line of people behind you at a pharmacy,\\\" he said.\", \"As he and Gloria point out, some times that fear can mean people avoid getting the treatment they need.\\u00a0\", \"At the same time as these new services are offering an online alternative, the issue of women's access to the pill is also being considered by the nation's medical regulator.\", \"In a recent interim decision the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) blocked requests for\\u00a0the pill to be sold over-the-counter at pharmacies.\", \"The head of the TGA, Professor John Skerritt, said a\\u00a0final decision was expected \\\"before Christmas\\\".\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Risk in online consultations: AMA</div>\", \"While some women have welcomed the services, the Australian Medical Association (AMA) believes there are trade offs for women's health when consultations are done online.\", \"<img

examinations\\u00a0is \\\"essential\\\" to a proper assessment.(ABC News: Claire Campbell)</div>\", \"Dr Chris Moy is a GP and the vice-president of the AMA, and said while he understood the convenience of online services, women only need to see a doctor once a year to have their script renewed which shouldn't be a big ask.\", \"\\\"In terms of either lack of the complete knowledge about your medical history or the fact that what you think your\\u00a0history is may be different to what is required to make a proper assessment.\", \"\\\"But also that individual will not be able to do a physical examination which may be essential to making a proper assessment to what should be prescribed and the most appropriate treatment for you.\\\"\", \"Dr Moy is\\u00a0also worried that the specific focus of the services might mean GPs miss how issues in the body can be\\u00a0interconnected.\"]","href_hash":"fb5a4f783b4511eca418000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fb5a4f783b4511eca418000017025a03"}},
