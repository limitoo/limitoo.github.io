Shetty\\u2019s latest installment tries to up the ante (a fool\\u2019s errand, given how over-the-top each of the prior movies already is) by smushing them all together: The movie\\u2019s titular Anti-Terrorism Squad officer, played by the action veteran Akshay Kumar, is joined by the supercops of the previous films (Ajay Devgn and Ranveer Singh) for a bullets-and-brawn extravaganza.\", \"But movies are not math, and three is not always better than one. \\u201cSooryavanshi\\u201d is both overstuffed and paper-thin. Its haywire maximalism \\u2014 including a relentless, deafening soundtrack and cuts so rapid and inconsistent as to make you dizzy \\u2014 ornaments a patchy bomb-scare plot whose heroes and villains are both numbskulls, making unconvincing gaffes to keep the narrative moving.\", \"Even more egregious is the film\\u2019s uncritical jingoism. Shetty\\u2019s crusading state warriors, whose violence and vigilante tactics are played for laughs and hoots, have always seemed a bit tone-deaf, but \\u201cSooryavanshi\\u201d veers into apologism: The film is rife with gleeful scenes of police brutality and pernicious stereotypes about Muslims. Whenever Sooryavanshi is confronted about Islamophobia (an increasingly urgent issue in India), he starts singing the praises of the single Muslim cop on his force as if to remind everyone what a \\u201cgood Muslim\\u201d looks like.\", \"\\u201cSooryavanshi\\u201d is weighed down by such endless, didactic soapboxing, while the rest of this erratic film devotes itself to juvenile jokes (Sooryavanshi referring to his wife, Ria, as \\u201cHernia\\u201d and \\u201cMalaria\\u201d) and sultry songs that offer the film\\u2019s female lead, Katrina Kaif, her only meaningful screen time.\"]","href_hash":"01359ef640ce11ec9bdf4fd96ec1aecc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"01359ef640ce11ec9bdf4fd96ec1aecc"}},
