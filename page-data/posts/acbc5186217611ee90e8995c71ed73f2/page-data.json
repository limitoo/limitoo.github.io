The Satellite had four barges in tow when she ran into difficulties. One account suggests that she suffered a mechanical problem, while another says that she struck a floating log and started taking on water.

GLSHS Director of Marine Operations, Darryl Ertel, put the Society\\u2019s ROV (remotely operated vehicle) down on the target, and ascertained that it was not a minesweeper, but the Satellite. The minesweepers are made of steel while the Satellite was a wooden hulled vessel. We thank Josh and his crew for featuring the Shipwreck Society on Expedition Unknown.\\n \\nUnfortunately, there are no known pictures of the Satellite.
