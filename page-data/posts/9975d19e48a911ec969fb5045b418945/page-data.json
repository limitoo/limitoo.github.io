There\\u2019s family history, in Kevin Young\\u2019s poetry collection \\u201cStones,\\u201d and historical fiction, in Abir Mukherjee\\u2019s crime novel \\u201cThe Shadows of Men,\\u201d set in Raj-era Calcutta. In more contemporary matters, we also recommend John McWhorter\\u2019s take on \\u201cwoke\\u201d culture, Farah Stockman\\u2019s look at the human costs of industrial decline and the conclusion to Alice Hoffman\\u2019s Practical Magic series, about a family of witches.\", \"Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowles\", \"PATRICIA HIGHSMITH: Her Diaries and Notebooks, 1941-1995, edited by Anna von Planta. (Liveright, $39.95.) In these personal writings, the author of \\u201cStrangers on a Train,\\u201d the Ripley series and many other novels mediates between her intense appetite for work and her need to lose herself in art, gin, music and warm bodies. \\u201cThe whole book is excellent,\\u201d our critic Dwight Garner writes. \\u201cHighsmith is pointed and dry about herself and everything else. But the early chapters are special. They comprise one of the most observant and ecstatic accounts I\\u2019ve read \\u2014 and it\\u2019s a crowded field! \\u2014 about being young and alive in New York City.\\u201d\", \"THE SINNER AND THE SAINT: Dostoevsky and the Gentleman Murderer Who Inspired a Masterpiece, by Kevin Birmingham. (Penguin Press, $30.) This book tells the story behind \\u201cCrime and Punishment,\\u201d a work of literary innovation whose publication marked a turning point for both Dostoyevsky and the history of the novel. Part of Birmingham\\u2019s project is to give proper due to the inspiration provided by the 1835 trial of the \\u201cpoet-murderer\\u201d Pierre-Fran\\u00e7ois Lacenaire, which Dostoyevsky learned about in 1861. \\u201cBut where Lacenaire was cool, unflappable and languid,\\u201d our critic Jennifer Szalai writes, Dostoyevsky\\u2019s Raskolnikov is \\u201cfeverish, tormented and confused, torn between ideas and impulses.\\u201d\", \"THE SHADOWS OF MEN, by Abir Mukherjee. (Pegasus Crime, $25.95.) Throughout Mukherjee\\u2019s erudite detective series set in Raj-era Calcutta, Sgt. Surendranath Banerjee has endured many trials \\u2014 but when he is accused of murder in this latest installment, not even his British supervisor may be able to save him. \\u201cMukherjee, as he has in previous series installments, paces this story with sure-footed ease,\\u201d Sarah Weinman writes in her latest crime column. \\u201cBut there is a bitter aftertaste that lingers even more strongly, because the root of Banerjee\\u2019s discontent is the scourge of colonialist attitudes, and that cannot be washed away in a tidy resolution.\\u201d\", \"THE BROKEN CONSTITUTION: Lincoln, Slavery, and the Refounding of America, by Noah Feldman. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $30.) Abraham Lincoln, Feldman contends, embraced a new, \\u201cmoral Constitution\\u201d by purging the country\\u2019s original sin of slavery and re-establishing the nation on a more noble foundation. A professor at Harvard Law School, Feldman is \\u201ca lucid, provocative stylist\\u201d as well as \\u201ca prolific scholar and commentator on current affairs \\u2026 well equipped to assess Lincoln\\u2019s constitutional record,\\u201d Sean Wilentz writes in his review. \\u201c\\u2018The Broken Constitution\\u2019 displays its author\\u2019s usual brilliance and boldness in his contrarianism, and a passionate engagement with the past.\\u201d\", \"FALLEN IDOLS: Twelve Statues That Made History, by Alex von Tunzelmann. (Harper/HarperCollins, $26.99.) Von Tunzelmann\\u2019s goal in recounting the fates of 12 controversial statues (from King George V in Raj-era India to Robert E. Lee in the American South) is to link recent movements for social justice to the larger question of how we distort, correct and ultimately understand the past. \\u201cMany of these stories are fascinating,\\u201d James Fallows writes in his review, noting that von Tunzelmann\\u2019s experience as a screenwriter lends the book a characteristically \\u201cbreezy tone\\u201d that \\u201csuggests rather than belabors its points, and calls on imagination and the other senses to fill in the blanks.\\u201d\", \"STONES: Poems, by Kevin Young. (Knopf, $27.) Young\\u2019s lyrical new collection is about family, about death and about how families absorb and repurpose loss; the stones here bear names and life spans. Young is an expansive, almost relaxed writer \\u2014 blistering intensity isn\\u2019t his signature. But he can throw salt in the pot when it\\u2019s needed. \\u201cYoung writes in an almost harmonic register,\\u201d David Orr writes in his review. \\u201cHis work can be quirky and brainy, but it\\u2019s never alienating. \\u2026 He\\u2019s attentive to sound and wordplay, yet he largely sticks to the approachable free verse model that has dominated American writing for 60 years. His writing is warm, often elegiac and confidently temperate. There\\u2019s a lot to like.\\u201d\", \"AMERICAN MADE: What Happens to People When Work Disappears, by Farah Stockman. (Random House, $28.) Stockman, a member of The New York Times\\u2019s editorial board, brings detailed, empathetic reporting to this study of industrial decline, tracing the impact on three blue-collar workers when their Indianapolis factory relocates to Mexico. Richard Davies, reviewing it, calls the book \\u201ca gripping portrait of the human costs incurred,\\u201d as well as \\u201ca stark warning to towns and countries facing similar trends, and a lesson in how much economists can miss.\\u201d\", \"WOKE RACISM: How a New Religion Has Betrayed Black America, by John McWhorter. (Portfolio, $28.) McWhorter, a Black liberal who dissents from much of the left\\u2019s views on race, argues against the position that racism and white supremacy are \\u201cbaked into\\u201d the structure of American society. \\u201cAs in his previous books, McWhorter views it as a mistake to forge one\\u2019s identity around victimhood,\\u201d Zaid Jilani writes in his review. \\u201cHe characterizes the woke racial worldview as harmful not for normalizing antiwhite prejudices or treating the social categories of race as something concrete, but because it deprives Black people of their humanity by infantilizing them.\\u201d\", \"THE BOOK OF MAGIC, by Alice Hoffman. (Simon & Schuster, $27.99.) In the finale to her Practical Magic series, Hoffman returns to the delightfully witchy Owens family as it tries to end a love curse that has endured for centuries. Alluring on its own, the book is also a satisfying end to a timeless saga. \\u201cHoffman is not afraid to use a healthy dollop of deus ex machina to keep her complicated story moving,\\u201d Joanne Ramos writes in her review. \\u201cAnd, like the witches who populate her stories, Hoffman certainly knows how to enchant.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9975d19e48a911ec969fb5045b418945"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9975d19e48a911ec969fb5045b418945"}},
