We consider even the thought of a war between our people to be unacceptable,\\\" said Alexei Zaitsev, a ministry spokesman.\", \"Russian and Ukrainian dollar bonds, which have been hammered by the crisis, rose after Peskov spoke. Russia's dollar-denominated RTS share index climbed and the rouble recovered from a nearly 15-month low.\\u00a0\", \"But, in a sign of lingering international concern, oil hit seven-year highs above $90 a barrel. Russia is the world's second-largest oil producer, and the crisis over Ukraine has fanned fears that energy supplies to Europe will be disrupted.\\u00a0\", \"A Ukrainian presidential adviser told Reuters that Kyiv wants to borrow some $5 billion from international organisations and in bilateral aid as borderline \\\"hysteria\\\" over the threat of a Russian attack was limiting its access to capital markets.\", \"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy will speak by phone later on Thursday with US President Joe Biden on issues of security, energy and macro-financial support, Zelenskiy's spokesman said.\", \"Russia's security demands, presented in December, include an end to further NATO enlargement, barring Ukraine from ever joining and pulling back the alliance's forces and weaponry from eastern European countries that joined after the Cold War.\", \"The US and NATO responses were not made public, but both had already rejected those demands while expressing willingness to engage on issues such as arms control, confidence-building measures and limits on the size and scope of military exercises.\", \"Turkey, a NATO member that has good ties with both Kyiv and Moscow, said it was important to keep talking. \\\"All problems cannot be solved with a document, one or two meetings,\\\" Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in Ankara.\", \"Western countries have warned of economic sanctions on Russia if it invades Ukraine, building on measures imposed since 2014, when Moscow annexed Crimea and Russian-backed separatists began fighting the Kyiv government's forces in eastern Ukraine.\", \"Ukrainian, Russian, German and French diplomats discussed the conflict in eastern Ukraine in Paris on Wednesday and agreed more talks should be held in Berlin in two weeks.\", \"Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the agreement on more talks meant Russia was likely to remain on a diplomatic track for at least two weeks.\", \"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said there was hope of starting serious dialogue with the United States, but only on secondary questions, not on fundamental ones. In comments published on his ministry's website, he said President Vladimir Putin would decide Russia's next move.\", \"Putin, who has not spoken publicly on the crisis for weeks, has warned of an unspecified \\\"military-technical response\\\" - something defence analysts say could relate to missile deployments - if Russia's demands are ignored.\", \"TASS news agency quoted a senior Russian foreign ministry official, Vladimir Ermakov, as saying a nuclear missile crisis between Moscow and Washington was unavoidable without measures to ensure restraint and predictability.\", \"He said Moscow believed Washington was preparing to deploy short and intermediate range missiles to Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.\", \"Biden has said he will not send US or allied troops to fight Russia in Ukraine but NATO has said it is putting forces on standby and reinforcing eastern Europe with more ships and fighter jets.\", \"Four F-16 fighter jets flew to Lithuania from Denmark on Thursday, and six US F-15 jets landed in nearby Estonia on Wednesday as NATO reinforced its eastern flank.\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"d3d4b1ae7f9811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d3d4b1ae7f9811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
