The company's goal is to open about 1,000 HealthHUBs this year.\", \"At a Thursday webcast of CVS Health's yearly investor meeting, Lynch said the company is \\\"closer to the consumer than anyone else.\\\" She added that despite primary care holding \\\"significant influence over health care utilization,\\\" only about 10 percent of national health care spending is dedicated to it.\", \"The primary care centers plan to provide patients with care teams including doctors, nurses and pharmacists.
