The Staples Center.\\\"\", \"Sports journalist Arash Markazi took to Twitter to explain why fans may not be as supportive of the new name change.\", \"He wrote: \\\"The real value to a naming rights deal is getting it before the venue opens. Slapping a new name on an arena or stadium over 20 years after it opened is like buying a giant billboard. Fans will see it but they will only know the home of the Lakers and Kings as the Staples Centre.\\\"\", \"In a later tweet, he added: \\\"It's not that L.A is attached to the name of an office supply store, it's that many of the greatest moments in L.A sports history have occurred in a building we've called Staples Centre for over 20 years. We are not going to call it Crypto.com Arena in a few days.\\\"\", \"Actor O'Shea Jackson Jr. was also critical of the name change. He wrote on his Twitter: \\\"You've got to be kidding me. At least call it the Crypto Center. How terrible does crypto.com arena sound? I'm depressed. Just put the Kobe Statue up... we need something to cheer about.\\\"\", \"Starting small forward for the Los Angeles Clippers, Paul George, spoke about the name change in a post-game interview on Tuesday night.\", \"He told reporters: \\\"It'll be weird, I grew up this being Staples and Staples being the place to play and the place to be. It's just, I mean it's the same location but it's kind of like stripping the history here by calling it something else.\\\"\", \"Clippers' starting point guard Reggie Jackson also commented on the name change on his way out of the stadium. He told reporters that he was unaware of the change but would continue to call it the Staples Centre out of habit. He was then seen taking a photo of the Staples Center hallway sign ahead of the name change.\", \"Crypto.com CEO Kris Marszalek praised those that had supported him and his company over the years on Twitter, despite the heated backlash.\", \"He wrote: \\\"WE dedicate this one to everyone who worked tirelessly over the years to bring crypto into the mainstream. You know who you are, we're proud to stand by your side in this arena.\\\"\", \"Both the Staples Center and Crypto.com have been contacted for comment on the name change.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1934163/staples-center-name-change-cryptocom.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> An exterior view of Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles on August 29, 2015 in Los Angeles.
