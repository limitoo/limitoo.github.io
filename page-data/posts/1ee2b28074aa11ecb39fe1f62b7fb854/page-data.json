From 17 January, parents or caregivers can go to a walk-in clinic with their tamariki or use the BookMyVaccine website to book an appointment with a health provider, hauora, or general practice.

The Ministry of Health says it also accepts verbal and/or written consent.\", \"The consent, along with the name of the person providing it, will be recorded in the Covid-19 Immunisation Register.\", \"Just like with the adult Covid-19 vaccine process, children will need to stay on site under observation for at least 15 minutes after taking their vaccine. If a child has a history of an immediate allergic reaction to other products, including food, medicines or other vaccines, they can still have this vaccine but may be asked to stay a little longer for monitoring.\", \"You should be provided with a card when you are leaving to record the date/time of the first dose and the date when the child will be expected to receive their second dose.\", \"The Ministry of Health advises parents/caregivers to give encouragement prior to the vaccination to help tamariki feel relaxed.\", \"Make sure they have had something to eat and drink before as well.\", \"Check they are wearing clothes that will make it easy to access their upper arm where the vaccine will be administered.\", \"They can also take something to the appointment that will distract them, like a soft toy or phone.\", \"At the appointment, both the adult and child can ask as many questions as they like.\", \"If your tamariki have had previous reactions to immunisations, let your vaccinator know, speak to your wh\\u0101nau doctor prior to the appointment, or talk to a trained adviser on the Covid Vaccination Healthline - 0800 28 29 26.\", \"As with any immunisation, children are likely to have a sore arm and get redness, pain or swelling at the injection site.\", \"Other reactions that can occur, usually within the next day or two, include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue, general discomfort (feeling unwell, aches and pains).\", \"The Ministry of Health states these are common side effects and show that the vaccine is working.
