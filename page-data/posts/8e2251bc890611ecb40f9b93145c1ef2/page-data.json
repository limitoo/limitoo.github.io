Disney has taken on this challenge in \\u201cAlice\\u2019s Wonderland Bakery,\\u201d a novel blend of sweetness and spice that uses globally inspired food to help little viewers master resilience and adaptability.\", \"Debuting on Wednesday on the Disney Channel, Disney Junior and the streaming service Disney+, the show takes its brightly colored universe and rapid-fire surprises from \\u201cAlice in Wonderland,\\u201d the company\\u2019s fantastical \\u2014 and fantastically food-filled \\u2014 1951 animated feature film of the classic Lewis Carroll story.\", \"\\u201cWe had been looking at doing something with \\u2018Alice\\u2019 for a while,\\u201d Joe D\\u2019Ambrosia, the senior vice president for original programming and general manager at Disney Junior, said in a telephone interview. \\u201cAnd we also had really been trying to find a cooking show for preschoolers.\\u201d\", \"This half-hour animated series is not, however, a traditional cooking show with recipes to follow. Although D\\u2019Ambrosia said he hoped it would inspire families to bake together, you won\\u2019t find ingredients like dancing dodo eggs and shrinking powder in your pantry. Instead, the dishes the series features \\u2014 some entirely fanciful, like dwindling dewdrop cake, and others based on the real world, like gingerbread \\u2014 become vehicles for creativity and problem-solving. The show\\u2019s Alice may concoct something delectable so she can make a new friend, comfort an old one or show how a situation, just like a recipe, can be approached in more than one way.\", \"Alice, who relies on the magical talking cookbook of her great-grandmother, the original movie\\u2019s heroine, \\u201cuses food as essentially her superpower,\\u201d said Chelsea Beyl, the series\\u2019s executive producer and showrunner. \\u201cThis is, you know, how she connects with all these curious and peculiar characters.\\u201d\", \"Some of those characters have hardly changed since the 1951 film\\u2019s premiere. The series\\u2019s Cheshire Cat, with his indelible grin and magenta stripes, and Alice\\u2019s feline companion, Dinah, could have leapt right out of one of the old movie\\u2019s frames. Others have transformed or become diverse versions of the figures that inspired them. (This is a multicultural Wonderland.) Alice herself is not the film\\u2019s preadolescent English schoolgirl but a very American-seeming 7- or 8-year-old, running her own bakery inside a giant teacup. (In Wonderland, all things are possible.)\", \"\\u201cIn the movie, you know she\\u2019s thinking,\\u201d said Frank Montagna, the co-executive producer and art director for the show, which uses computer-generated animation to create a heightened version of the film\\u2019s world. \\u201cAnd so we wanted to really home in on that part of our Alice \\u2014 that, you know, she\\u2019s always trying to figure things out.\\u201d\", \"That entails trial and error for her, including at least one spectacular failure: In the pilot, the birthday cake Alice has baked for Princess Rosa, a new character who is the daughter of the formidable Queen of Hearts, has magic sprinkles that unexpectedly fly onto all the royal guests, causing the disgusted queen to end the palace festivities. (Pandemic-weary children will probably identify with the disappointment of a canceled birthday party.)\", \"To redeem herself and cheer up Rosa the next day, Alice hosts an intimate unbirthday celebration, a concept found in both the 1951 film and Lewis Carroll\\u2019s \\u201cThrough the Looking Glass.\\u201d This cake isn\\u2019t ordinary, either.\", \"Alice \\u201cis very, very curious,\\u201d said Libby Rue, 13, who is making her TV debut as the heroine\\u2019s voice. \\u201cHer curiosity sometimes gets the best of her, but she is very kind, and she loves making her friends happy by baking.\\u201d\", \"Other series characters get into trouble, too, like Alice\\u2019s best friend, Fergie, a descendant of the White Rabbit who appears in the book and the film. In one episode, Fergie struggles by himself to help Alice bake a huge order of pies and then lies, as a small child might, about what he did wrong. When the truth comes out, Alice reassures him that it\\u2019s always all right to ask for help.\", \"In creating Fergie and the other Wonderland characters, the concern was \\u201cto really be reflective of today\\u2019s young audiences,\\u201d D\\u2019Ambrosia said, which also meant giving them origins that Carroll might never have dreamed of.\", \"Rosa and the Queen of Hearts, for instance, look and sound Hispanic, practicing customs inspired by Cuba\\u2019s. (Because the characters come from Wonderland, their habits are sometimes inspired by the real world but are not, technically, of it.) Dad Hatter, patterned after the host of the Mad Hatter\\u2019s Tea Party, and his dapper son, Alice\\u2019s friend Hattie, reflect Japanese traditions \\u2014 a nod, Beyl said, to the importance of tea in that country\\u2019s culture.\", \"Later in the 25-episode first season, the show will introduce a caterpillar family whose influences are Persian. (Parents will be relieved that the lead caterpillar, familiar to Wonderland fans, is blowing bubbles instead of smoking a hookah.) The show\\u2019s creators have also made some formerly male characters female, and the queen herself is now merely a diva instead of a homicidal tyrant.\", \"Bringing diversity to Carroll\\u2019s work \\u201cmeans a lot,\\u201d said Eden Espinosa, who voices the queen and is herself the granddaughter of Mexican immigrants, \\u201cbecause I feel like it is acknowledging that these classics \\u2014 although there might not have been representation in them when they were, you know, brand-new \\u2014 they transcend culture lines.\\u201d\", \"The food also reflects the ethnicities the series embraces. In an episode in which Alice and Princess Rosa bake apple crumble pastelitos, this Cuban pastry functions as a preschooler\\u2019s version of Proust\\u2019s madeleine, reminding the King of Hearts (Rosa\\u2019s grandfather, voiced by the Cuban American singer Jon Secada) of the wife he misses so much. Another episode highlights mochi, Japanese rice cakes.\", \"But at a time of national concern over childhood obesity, the executive producers have taken special care not to build the entire series around desserts.\", \"\\u201cWe have a lot of episodes that are about, you know, Fergie growing veggies in his garden, which I think is really fun for kids to see and maybe want to do,\\u201d Beyl said. Even in references to sweet recipes, she added, \\u201cwe rarely say \\u2018sugar.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Young viewers will also watch Alice make dishes that include vegetables or fruits, like a carrot calzone, grape gazpacho, huevos habaneros and kuku sibzamini (Persian potato patties).\", \"\\u201cIt was really cool to not only bring the cultural elements into the food, but the music, the costumes, the casting and the set as well,\\u201d Beyl said.\", \"For example, \\u201cThe Baking Song,\\u201d written and composed by the show\\u2019s music director, John Kavanaugh, recurs throughout the series in different ways: The queen sings a salsa version, while the caterpillar episode has a version featuring Persian instruments. The series also incorporates tunes from the 1951 movie, like \\u201cThe Unbirthday Song,\\u201d and other work by Kavanaugh, such as \\u201cFood for Thought,\\u201d which conveys series themes like flexibility. (Alice believes there\\u2019s a recipe for anything or, as she puts it, \\u201cWhere there\\u2019s a whisk, there\\u2019s a way.\\u201d)\", \"The musical emphasis \\u2014 this month, Walt Disney Records will release a digital soundtrack album from the show \\u2014 also called for singing talent, so in addition to Espinosa, who has starred in \\u201cWicked,\\u201d the voice cast includes Broadway veterans like James Monroe Iglehart (\\u201cAladdin\\u201d) and Mandy Gonzalez (\\u201cHamilton\\u201d). Several comics are featured, too, like Donald Faison, Craig Ferguson and the \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d alumni Ana Gasteyer, Bobby Moynihan and Vanessa Bayer.\", \"According to Montagna, \\u201cWe really tried to push the comedic performances,\\u201d while also \\u201cpushing the boundaries of what preschool entertainment can be.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t want people to compare this with any storybook environment or other Disney shows,\\u201d he added. \\u201cWe wanted it to stand out as Wonderland.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8e2251bc890611ecb40f9b93145c1ef2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8e2251bc890611ecb40f9b93145c1ef2"}},
