After guests, including the actresses Jennifer Aniston and Uma Thurman, filled the rows of chairs, others moved to the floor. Andie MacDowell reclined on a rug among a heap of pillows. Ms. Schumacher was supposed to appear at 8:30 p.m. A gospel choir sang while everyone sat around and glanced at Ms. Schumacher\\u2019s empty chair and at each other.\", \"Since 2010, Ms. Schumacher has worked as a medium, meaning someone who receives messages from people who have died. She doesn\\u2019t have a website and is often booked months in advance. Her prices are another obstacle, with sessions priced at $1,111 per hour. (She likes the synchronicity of the number.)\", \"Ms. Schumacher might fall under a category of so-called New Age practitioners. But spiritualism \\u2014 the belief that the living can communicate with the dead \\u2014 is very old, its popularity surging in times of high mortality rates: in the Victorian era, for example, and after major wars in the United States and Europe.\", \"In late 2019, just as the world was on the precipice of a plague of biblical proportions, Ms. Schumacher said she began channeling Yeshua, a.k.a. Jesus Christ as he is known in the Old Testament. Transcribed recordings of some of those sessions appear in a new book, \\u201cThe Freedom Transmissions,\\u201d out Nov. 30.\", \"The party was for the book, but it was also a chance for her clients, many of whom hadn\\u2019t experienced the Yeshua channeling, to see what it was all about. Maybe she would channel him at the party. No one was quite sure.\", \"Ms. Aniston, who\\u2019s been seeing Ms. Schumacher since 2019, has a Rolodex of healers, astrologers and numerologists that she\\u2019s acquired over the last 30 years. Ms. Schumacher\\u2019s advice, she said, has helped her navigate personal struggles, work and friendships. \\u201cThe Yeshua channeling thing is way out there,\\u201d she had told me earlier, \\u201cand for some people, it\\u2019s going to be insane this idea of someone channeling Jesus, but it\\u2019s more about this message that she\\u2019s tapped into. Everything she\\u2019s communicated to me just resonates with me and excites me.\\u201d\", \"Rooney Mara, another client, couldn\\u2019t make it to the party, but spoke to me by phone. She hadn\\u2019t experienced Yeshua\\u2019s transmissions, but was open to the idea. \\u201cI\\u2019m pretty much open to everything,\\u201d she said, adding, \\u201cI think because she\\u2019s channeling Yeshua, that automatically closes the door for some people. But she could be channeling anyone. It doesn\\u2019t close the door for me.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Schumacher finally appeared a little after 9:30 p.m. A petite woman of 39, she walked tentatively toward the front of the room, removed her metallic gold heels, and sat cross-legged beneath the giant floral wreath, which now looked like a halo. The wall behind her was covered in photos of rainbows.\", \"\\u201cWe love you so much!\\u201d someone screamed. She put her hands together in prayer and nodded to a few fans around the room. \\u201cFor those of you that don\\u2019t know me, I\\u2019m Carissa,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI knew my whole life that I would be a channel for Yeshua.\\u201d\", \"A few weeks earlier, I had met Ms. Schumacher at her home in Escondido, Calif., outside San Diego, where she lives with her partner, David Carnell, a mission assurance engineer at a defense technology company. \\u201cHello, beloved!\\u201d Ms. Schumacher said, embracing me while their two rescue dogs milled at our feet. (\\u201cBeloved\\u201d is how Yeshua addresses readers in the book.)\", \"Ms. Schumacher wore brown leggings, suede brown boots and a turquoise hooded sweatshirt, saying that she mostly wears Faded Glory, Wal-Mart\\u2019s clothing label. A tangle of Native American medicine necklaces jangled around her neck, a gift from a Cherokee healer. Ms. Schumacher grabbed a turquoise JanSport backpack and we headed out to the Elfin Forest, a vast recreational reserve near her home.\", \"Ms. Schumacher estimated that she goes to Los Angeles almost never. She doesn\\u2019t like the collective feeling of dashed hopes that tends to fester there. \\u201cThere\\u2019s this tragic lost souls energy,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI think a lot of people go there to become something or to find themselves, and very rarely do they actually.\\u201d What they find instead are the cults, gurus, healers, psychics and the swollen egos that drive them. Ms. Schumacher doesn\\u2019t want to be known for any of the above. \\u201cI hate talking about myself,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut I have a lot to say about my journey with Yeshua.\\u201d\", \"Not that she doesn\\u2019t understand how that sounds. \\u201cI can\\u2019t even say \\u2018channel for Jesus\\u2019 without laughing,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt sounds so freaking blasphemous! And frankly, really insane.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Schumacher isn\\u2019t the only medium to attest to channeling biblical figures. Besides Esther Hicks, whose best-selling \\u201cLaw of Attraction\\u201d series in part inspired the popular 2006 documentary \\u201cThe Secret\\u201d and were based on messages she said she received from \\u201cAbraham,\\u201d there are also authors who tour lecture halls with the promise of channeling John the Apostle and the Virgin Mary.\", \"Susan Gerbic, the founder of Guerrilla Skeptics, a group that conducts sting operations of people she calls \\u201cgrief vampires,\\u201d told me that the invocation of religion was consistent with a psychic\\u2019s desire to feel special. \\u201cIf you are in conversation with dead biblical figures, then that is really special and holds a lot of power,\\u201d she said, adding that it also served as a shield against skeptics. \\u201cWho\\u2019s going to attack someone who\\u2019s playing the religion card?\\u201d\", \"Ms. Schumacher told me that she tries to avoid the spotlight. \\u201cI say no to everything,\\u201d she said. Among the things she has said no to were a potential TV show with Discovery Studios and another that the actor Rob Lowe, also a client, proposed in which Ms. Schumacher would channel for other celebrities. She wanted to say no to the book party too, she said, but her fans convinced her the party was really for Yeshua.\", \"She recalled something Brad Pitt once told her. \\u201cBrad said that in the beginning of his career, he never knew that the cost of having a public life would be his freedom,\\u201d she said, \\u201cI\\u2019ve heard that in the back of my mind all this time.\\u201d\", \"We settled on a cluster of rocks above a stream, where Ms. Schumacher pulled a pipe out of her backpack, packed it with kinnikinnik \\u2014 a Native American smoking mixture \\u2014 and began to recount how she became a channel for Yeshua. \\u201cPeople are like, \\u2018Oh, it must be so amazing being Yeshua\\u2019s channel,\\u2019 and it\\u2019s not,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI meant it is, but it requires a huge amount of discipline.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Schumacher was raised in Westport, Conn. Her father, a Catholic who became Unitarian, worked for Pitney Bowes, the mail services company. Her mother taught English as a Second Language classes. In grade school, a cemetery field trip earned her the nickname \\u201cCrazy Carrie\\u201d after she called out the names on the graves before her class would reach them. It stuck with her until middle school, when she was bullied again for developing early. \\u201cI struggled a lot with self esteem, and some of that resulted in feeling like I needed to please guys,\\u201d she said, \\u201cso that I can feel loved and wanted.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Schumacher attended Brown University, where she majored in cognitive neuroscience. She went on to work in biotech, and eventually landed in San Diego at NovaRx, a pharmaceutical company developing a lung cancer vaccine. She was vague describing her time at the company. \\u201cI was pretty traumatized,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI felt like I was dying. I just needed to let everything die.\\u201d I asked if she felt comfortable explaining what she meant. \\u201cAre you talking about the New York Post story?\\u201d she asked.\", \"In 2006, Justin Murdock, the Dole Pineapple heir, became the C.E.O. of NovaRx, after he and his father, David Murdock, invested $35 million in the company. In 2010, Ms. Schumacher accused Justin Murdock, of sexual harassment, according to a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. Mr. Murdock\\u2019s lawyer, in a comment for this article, said that the case was dismissed with prejudice and that there was no merit to Ms. Schumacher\\u2019s claims.\", \"After leaving the company, Ms. Schumacher moved to the Elfin Forest. One day, she said, she returned home from a hike and felt a blue flame swirl down her spine. She heard glass shatter and a baby cry. She said this is when she first felt Yeshua\\u2019s energy.\", \"Her naturopathic doctor suggested she meet Danielle Gibbons, who lives in southern Oregon and says she has been channeling the Virgin Mary since 1994. (She has a YouTube channel.) In 2011, Ms. Schumacher attended Ms. Gibbons\\u2019s workshop in Los Angeles, and subsequently booked private sessions with her roughly once a year. Ms. Gibbons told me that she didn\\u2019t know Ms. Schumacher was a Yeshua channel until much later, in 2019.\", \"Ms. Schumacher said that she spent the next decade preparing her channel for Yeshua. She meditated daily, cut out sugar and caffeine, and limited her diet to five foods: broccoli, cauliflower, turkey, chicken and watermelon. \\u201cIf someone\\u2019s channel is diluted,\\u201d she said, \\u201cthere\\u2019s a kind of film or gunk that the energy gets stuck in and can\\u2019t push through.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Schumacher, who dated men and women in her 20s, assumed she would also have to be celibate. But then she kept getting a message, \\u201cDavid with a black dog.\\u201d She signed up for Match.com. Mr. Carnell\\u2019s profile, which had a photo of him with a black dog, was the first one that popped up. When she took him to a John Mayer concert for his birthday, he understood when she suddenly had to go channel the dead lover and brother of a woman in another row. \\u201cThat\\u2019s love,\\u201d she said.\", \"By 2013, Ms. Schumacher had started channeling for friends, then friends of friends, and eventually put on free events. She also received a message in a dream to lead her followers into the desert. She began hosting journeys to Sedona, Ariz., where she invited clients for meditations in caves and occasionally channeled their dead relatives.\", \"Ms. Mara attended such a journey in 2018. She first wrote to Ms. Schumacher under an alias when she had just finished filming \\u201cMary Magdalene,\\u201d a 2019 film in which Ms. Mara starred. \\u201cThe first session was just out of this world incredible,\\u201d Ms. Mara said. Other mediums were more vague, making generalized statements that could apply to anyone. But Ms. Schumacher, she said, knew specifics about her family that no one could have known. \\u201cEven if she did somehow figure out who I was,\\u201d Ms. Mara said.\", \"Ms. Schumacher then invited her to Sedona. \\u201cI was definitely scared and slightly resistant to it,\\u201d Ms. Mara said. \\u201cI think I pulled up and almost turned right back around. But after a few hours I was like, \\u2018Nope, I can trust these people. We\\u2019re all just human here, searching for something.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Ms. Schumacher thinks of her referral system like trees, with each person referring six others. Rain Phoenix, Joaquin\\u2019s sister, referred Ms. Mara, who then referred the director David Fincher \\u2014 \\u201cwe had a really \\u2018wow\\u2019 session,\\u201d Ms. Schumacher said \\u2014 who then referred Brad Pitt. Mr. Pitt also didn\\u2019t write his real name, but signed his initials. \\u201cI thought he was Brad Paisley,\\u201d Ms. Schumacher said. (Mr. Fincher could not be reached; Mr. Pitt declined to comment.)\", \"Ms. Aniston was referred via a totally different tree, specifically \\u201cthe Rob Lowe tree.\\u201d When she received a session with Ms. Schumacher for her 50th birthday in 2019, Ms. Schumacher revealed details about the death of a relative that gave Ms. Aniston clarity about her childhood. \\u201cOne moment after the next just left my jaw on the floor and tears streaming out of my eyes,\\u201d Ms. Aniston said.\", \"Later that year, Ms. Aniston attended a Sedona journey, which included a heart-opening ceremony. \\u201cMy heart might have been closed down for the last 15 years or so for whatever reason,\\u201d she told me. (I wasn\\u2019t sure if she was referring to her divorce from Mr. Pitt in 2005, and I didn\\u2019t ask.)\", \"Ms. Aniston said it is not typical for her to do anything with groups of strangers. \\u201cNormally that would paralyze me with fear,\\u201d she said. \\u201cFor someone who\\u2019s built a life of walls and protection and suspicion and being, you know, a public person, it was probably the greatest gift I\\u2019ve had in terms of human experience in a long, long time.\\u201d By the end, she said, \\u201cI just put my arms around 29 strangers and thanked them for their vulnerability.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Aniston left that journey early, and the next day Ms. Schumacher said that Yeshua spoke through her for the first time. Those who\\u2019ve witnessed it since then say that Ms. Schumacher\\u2019s voice and body change. Yeshua\\u2019s voice is deeper, more measured, and has a slight British accent.\", \"When I asked what it\\u2019s like to channel Yeshua, Ms. Schumacher said, \\u201cIt feels like I\\u2019m being flushed down a toilet. I go whoosh! And he comes up. I breathe a lot. My body shakes.\\u201d On journeys, someone is tasked with holding down her ankles. Coming back into her body is hard, she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a little bit like \\u2026 womp, womp.\\u201d\", \"In the fall of 2020, Ms. Schumacher emailed recordings of Yeshua transmissions to her clients. Among them was Jennifer Rudolph Walsh, who was referred to Ms. Schumacher after leaving her longtime job running the literary department at WME. She thought Yeshua\\u2019s teachings could be a book and connected Ms. Schumacher with the publisher of Harper One, which will release \\u201cThe Freedom Transmissions.\\u201d\", \"Though there\\u2019s some Christian iconography in it \\u2014 references to the crucifixion, for instance \\u2014 the rest is a more neutral smorgasbord of divine power surrender, Buddhism, repairing the fragmented self after trauma, and accessing \\u201cthe God self,\\u201d a reference to Carl Jung.\", \"Ms. Rudolph Walsh said that Yeshua\\u2019s teachings changed her entire nervous system. \\u201cI don\\u2019t react to the weather,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t report the weather. I am the weather. And the weather is always peace.\\u201d\", \"I asked Ms. Rudolph Walsh if she believed that Yeshua was truly speaking through Ms. Schumacher. \\u201cTo me, it doesn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt matters what is being said. But do I personally believe she\\u2019s channeling Yeshua? Yes, I do.\\u201d\", \"Later I asked Ms. Gerbic, the psychic skeptic, if she believed there were any legitimate mediums in the world. \\u201cI could give you the long answer about how we don\\u2019t know all things yet and science does not know everything, but I think you know my answer: It\\u2019s all BS,\\u201d she wrote in an email. \\u201cAnd the way I know this isn\\u2019t because I\\u2019ve been doing this for so long, and know many people who have been doing this for so long. But because it is NOT possible to communicate with dead people. They are dead.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Schumacher pointed out that Ms. Gerbic hasn\\u2019t met her or read her book. \\u201cIf people want to judge, it\\u2019s their choice to do so,\\u201d she said. She also wanted to be clear that Yeshua is not her alter ego. \\u201cAnd frankly that type of response is exactly what was said to Mary Magdalene,\\u201d she said. (According to some Christian texts, after Jesus came to Magdalene in a vision, his disciple Peter ridiculed her.)\", \"Back at the party in Los Angeles, Ms. Schumacher held court. She had already signed a deal for two more books of Yeshua transmissions. A fashion designer offered to dress her for the event, but Ms. Schumacher bought a used turquoise Express dress online and wore that instead.\", \"\\u201cYeshua invites us to set our burdens down,\\u201d she told her audience. \\u201cThe problem with burdens \\u2014 where is Jenna? We were just talking about this.\\u201d She searched the room for the actress Jenna Dewan, who attended her first Sedona journey the year her divorce from Channing Tatum was finalized. Ms. Schumacher said the only way to freedom was through forgiveness. \\u201cYour freedom cannot be taken away when you lose your fortune or get put in a tabloid or whatever you people have to deal with,\\u201d she said. (Everyone laughed.) \", \"Ms. Schumacher\\u2019s fans say that she is far from a cult leader: There\\u2019s no indoctrination, they say, no mind control, no shame or isolation involved. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not going to be for everybody,\\u201d Ms. Aniston said. \\u201cBut as long as it\\u2019s not harming anyone, I feel that to each his own. Whatever makes it easier to walk through this world with a lighter step, especially today.\\u201d\", \"But Ms. Mara told me that it\\u2019s good to be wary. \\u201cAny time you\\u2019re looking to any one person for all the answers, that\\u2019s a problem,\\u201d she said. \\u201cCarissa is human like the rest of us, so you have to take from it what resonates and leave the rest.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Schumacher decided ultimately that the vibe at the Flamingo Estate wasn\\u2019t conducive to channeling Yeshua. (\\u201cI am not a go-go-gadget channel,\\u201d she told me.) Instead she channeled Kenneth, a guest\\u2019s dead father who she said liked fishing and fixing cars. Kenneth\\u2019s son, John, wiped his eyes, as did many others in the room. \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry,\\u201d Ms. Schumacher said.\", \"\\u201cDon\\u2019t be,\\u201d John said. \\u201cI loved it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"10a660044ed011ecb1f7a3d9f2af8c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"10a660044ed011ecb1f7a3d9f2af8c7c"}},
