She is still at the top of her game, and in November she tied the career record for World Cup wins in a single discipline, slalom. Petra Vlhova of Slovakia and Lara Gut-Behrami and Michelle Gisin of Switzerland will be challengers as well.\", \"In the men\\u2019s events, Alexis Pinturault of France has a silver and two bronzes at the Games, but will be looking for gold No. 1 as the reigning World Cup overall champion.\", \"The disciplines include downhill, the fastest event; super-G, with more turns added; giant slalom, still more turns; and slalom, the slowest and most technical event. There is also a combined event (downhill and slalom) and a mixed-gender team slalom event.\", \"Take the endurance test of cross-country skiing and shake it up every few kilometers by having athletes stop to shoot rifles at targets. Too many misses, and skiers must take a penalty lap. Germany, France, Sweden and Norway should dominate the medals.\", \"Joining the four-man, two-man and two-woman events is a race for just one: women\\u2019s monobob. The first world champion was crowned this year: Kaillie Humphries, a two-time Olympic gold medalist for Canada now representing the United States. But Humphries is still awaiting U.S. citizenship to compete in Beijing.\", \"Humphries is also the world champion in the two-woman bob, with Lolo Jones as her pusher.\", \"Norway dominates this sport, but the United States claimed its first gold medal in 2018 when Jessie Diggins and Kikkan Randall won the sprint relay. Diggins will be back in 2022. The revered Norwegian Marit Bjorgen has retired from Olympic competition after winning eight gold medals over three Games.\", \"For many Americans, who seem to embrace the granite rocks and brooms of curling every four years, a highlight of the 2018 Games was the U.S. men, led by John Shuster, streaking to the gold medal after a somewhat shaky 5-4 start. The Swedish men and Swiss women have been the most successful since then, and Canada is always a contender.\", \"The deep Russian team swept the top three spots in the women\\u2019s competition at the last world championships, with now 17-year-old Anna Shcherbakova on top.\", \"The American Nathan Chen skated a terrible short program four years ago that knocked him out of contention. But he won his third straight gold medal at the worlds this year, and a potential duel with Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan, the 2014 and 2018 Olympic champion, could be a highlight of the Games.\", \"In the pairs event, Sui Wenjing and Han Cong could bring the gold to the host nation. In ice dance, Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov of Russia are the world champions.\", \"There are six disciplines. In the aerials and the new big air event, skiers launch themselves off a ramp and perform flips and spins. In halfpipe, they perform in a U-shaped bowl, and in slopestyle, they ski down a course with rails and jumps. In moguls, they ski over a bumpy course and are judged on turns, jumps and speed.\", \"The only event that is timed instead of judged is ski cross, in which skiers race against one another in groups of four.\", \"Canada won four gold medals at the last Games; no other nation had more than one. That team is led by the moguls superstar Mikael Kingsbury, the defending Olympic champion.\", \"After missing out in 2018, N.H.L. players will be back at the Games, assuring a star-laden field. The United States (Patrick Kane and Auston Matthews), Canada (Sidney Crosby and Connor McDavid) and Sweden (Nicklas Backstrom and Victor Hedman) could be the strongest teams on paper.\", \"China will also be participating in the men\\u2019s event, despite concerns that the team is not nearly good enough to be competitive.\", \"In the women\\u2019s event, Canada and the United States have won all six gold medals since the sport was added, and five of the six silvers. Finland, Russia and perhaps Switzerland are likely to vie for the bronze.\", \"Germans have won 34 of 48 gold medals in this sport over the years, including seven of the last eight.\", \"In case you can\\u2019t remember, luge is the feet-first sledding race; skeleton is headfirst.\", \"To win in Nordic combined, athletes must be great at two very different events: cross-country skiing and ski jumping. After years of Norwegian domination, Germany won all three gold medals at the last Games.\", \"Nordic combined is the only Olympic sport without a women\\u2019s event, but that may change in 2026.\", \"And here\\u2019s the headfirst sledding event. The United States does much better here, winning three of the 12 golds awarded so far. (The Americans have never won luge gold.) Germany, Austria and Russia are the countries to watch this year.\", \"This is a sport that beats athletes up, thanks to the G-forces and vibrations rattling the sledders.\", \"Men jump in \\u201cnormal hill\\u201d and \\u201clarge hill\\u201d competitions, while female jumpers, who joined the Games only in 2018, are limited to normal hill. There is also a mixed-gender team competition being added this year.\", \"Some have said that the top of the ski jumping tower, where athletes wait before the exhilarating trip down, is the quietest spot at the Games.\", \"Several of the events are the same as in freestyle skiing: big air, halfpipe, slopestyle and snowboard cross (rather than ski cross). There is also a head-to-head giant slalom competition.\", \"One of the stars of the 2018 competition, the American halfpipe gold medalist Chloe Kim, will be back to defend her title, with an appearance on \\u201cThe Masked Singer\\u201d under her belt. The three-time gold medalist Shaun White plans to be back as well at age 35.\", \"Long-track speedskating, in which athletes normally race two at a time against the clock, is dominated by the Dutch. They won seven of 14 gold medals in 2018 and eight of 12 in 2014. The United States, behind the world champions Joey Mantia and Brittany Bowe, will be looking for a first gold medal since 2010.\", \"Short-track, with multiple skaters racing, and sometimes colliding, over a tight course, provided China with its only gold of the 2018 Games. South Korea will also be a major contender. Though the United States picks up medals here and there, it has not won a gold since Apolo Ohno did in 2006 and 2002.\"]","href_hash":"c80ecdc0543511ecaaa77302a907c559"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c80ecdc0543511ecaaa77302a907c559"}},
