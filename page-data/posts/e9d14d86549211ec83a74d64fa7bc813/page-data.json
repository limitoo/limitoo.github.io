Evers is running for re-election in 2022 and has made ease of women's healthcare, including abortion, a key running point. The Republicans who wrote the bills cannot override the veto due to the party not having enough votes in Legislature to do so.\", \"\\\"I've said it before, and I'll say it again today,\\\" Evers tweeted in his announcement of the vetoes, \\\"as long as I'm governor, I will veto any legislation that turns back the clock on reproductive rights in this state\\u2014and that's a promise.\\\"\", \"Some of the bills he vetoed were re-written ones proposed to him in 2019. One such bill proposed charging doctors with criminal offenses if they do not give medical care to babies that, in extremely rare cases, survive abortion attempts. Another returning bill would have required doctors to encourage women seeking medicine-induced abortions to just take one capsule in order to continue the pregnancy. The third bill from 2019 would have banned abortions based on sex or race.\", \"These vetoes come as the future of Roe v. Wade, the law that made abortion legal in the U.S., is in question. The Supreme Court is hearing cases on multiple laws across the country that would ban abortions on different levels.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945446/bans-off-our-bodies.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Wisconsin Governor Tom Evers vetoed five anti-abortion bills on Friday.

They and other opponents said babies are almost never born alive during failed abortion attempts and in the rare instances in which they are, doctors are already ethically and legally bound to try and keep them alive.\", \"The bill's supporters said the measure would remove any gray areas in the law.\", \"A second bill Evers vetoed would require doctors to provide the parents of fetuses and embryos that test positive for congenital condition information about the condition.\", \"\\\"Killing an unborn baby because of their sex, race or disability is not health care,\\\" said Republican Senator Julian Bradley in a statement. \\\"This is a radical, pro-discrimination veto from Governor Evers. Wisconsinites deserve to know life is valued whether they are a man or woman, white or black, or have a disability.\\\"\", \"A fourth measure Evers vetoed would reduce funding for abortion providers by prohibiting the state from certifying them as a provider under Medicaid. There would be exceptions in cases of sexual assault or incest or if the woman's life is in danger.\", \"The claim that a medicine-induced abortion can be reversed has been criticized by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Medical Association as not based in science and potentially threatening to the patient's life.\", \"A Wisconsin law enacted in 1849 made abortion illegal, but it has been unenforceable since the Roe v. Wade decision. That ban would take effect again if Roe v. Wade is overturned.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945448/tony-evers.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">All the bills vetoed by Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers were written by Republicans.
