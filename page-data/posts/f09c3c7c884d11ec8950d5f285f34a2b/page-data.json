It also means she will also play a more significant role at his coronation and be crowned.\", \"Camilla\\u2019s royal role has already expanded since she and Prince Charles married in 2005, but royal watchers were uncertain what it might look like when Prince Charles becomes King. It was the second marriage for both, and Camilla was dragged by Britain\\u2019s tabloids for years after her romantic involvement with Charles during his marriage to Diana, the Princess of Wales, became known.\", \"Diana was killed in a car crash in 1997, five years after her separation from Charles and a year after their divorce. Camilla was previously married to Andrew Parker Bowles, but the pair divorced in 1995. In the midst of all of the relationship drama came tell-all interviews and the publication of a recording of a tapped call that offered sordid details about the Charles and Camilla\\u2019s private life.\", \"Camilla isn\\u2019t the first royal spouse to come up against public skepticism controversy over his or her title. Queen Victoria\\u2019s husband, Prince Albert, had to fight for years to be named consort because of wariness over his German background.\", \"\\u201cWith Camilla, there is a similar kind of wariness and skepticism,\\u201d Professor Chernock said. \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t stem from being a foreigner in her case, obviously. It just stems from the origin story of their relationship.\\u201d\", \"But in the nearly 17 years since Camilla and Charles were married, they have worked to cultivate a public image of service, stability and discretion.\", \"\\u201cIt was all profoundly uncomfortable \\u2014 we know more than we ever would want to know about this couple \\u2014 and so this is part of a very careful, very long term rehabilitation strategy,\\u201d Professor Chernock said.\", \"Apart from helping repair the couple\\u2019s public image, the queen consort announcement also signals full acceptance for a spouse who has been divorced. All of Queen Elizabeth\\u2019s children save one are divorced, so it is something to which he family has grown accustomed.\", \"\\u201cIt could be an opportunity to showcase a more forgiving, more flexible, more modern idea of what the monarchy represents,\\u201d Professor Chernock said.\", \"Edward Owens, a historian and the author of \\u201cThe Family Firm: Monarchy, Mass Media and the British Public, 1932-53,\\u201d said the queen\\u2019s decision to offer Camilla the queen consort title suggests that the crown is moving with the times when it comes to divorced people.\", \"The queen famously did not attend Charles and Camilla\\u2019s wedding, since she is the head of the Church of England, which did not allow divorced people to remarry then (it now does).\", \"The queens\\u2019s intervention, Dr. Owens said, means that Camilla has \\u201cthe royal stamp of approval.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis is the queen dispelling all doubt, by making it known very publicly that it is her personal wish that Camilla take this title,\\u201d Dr. Owens said. \\u201cTo oppose this idea that Camilla would be made queen is now to oppose the personal wish of the queen, so it takes advantage of the public good will toward Elizabeth II.\\u201d\", \"Over the years, Camilla\\u2019s efforts to quietly serving the public has helped bolster both her and Charles\\u2019 image. Along with the queen\\u2019s daughter, Princess Anne, she is seen as one of the more active senior members of the royal family, doing the fundamental work that props up the monarchy, like charity events and meeting with the public.\", \"The public perception of Camilla has changed markedly during her marriage to Prince Charles, Simon Heffer, a historian, wrote in The Telegraph. \\u201cHer success is not because she has changed as a person to make the people admire her more,\\u201d he wrote, \\u201cit is because the people have changed their view of her and realized she was a very good sort all along.\\u201d\", \"On the streets of London on Monday, many who spoke about the future consort seemed to agree.\", \"\\u201cPeople have accepted her now after that Diana business and what have you,\\u201d said Eamon Gunn, 56, who works in the music business.\", \"\\u201cShe just stays in the background and doesn\\u2019t get involved,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think she does a good job at what she does. She just minds her own business behind the scenes.\\u201d\", \"Popular culture has brought the story of Camilla and Charles to a new generation, with the latest seasons of \\u201cThe Crown\\u201d and films like \\u201cSpencer\\u201d bringing fictionalized versions of their relationship to the masses.\", \"Stephanie Martin, 36, a screenwriter and playwright, said so many people have watched \\u201cThe Crown\\u201d that they feel \\u201cquite invested in their love story.\\u201d She said she was glad to see the new title. \\u201cI\\u2019m up for it,\\u201d she said. \\u201cFor me it\\u2019s about a real love story in its final conclusion. Good for her.\\u201d\", \"Some felt it was much ado about nothing.\", \"\\u201cIt wouldn\\u2019t bother me either way,\\u201d said Oliver Foley, 43, who works as a decorator. Mr. Foley said: \\u201cI\\u2019m not a royalist. I do admire the queen, but I don\\u2019t think about the monarchy on a daily basis.\\u201d\", \"Gary Power, 56, an artist, said the royal family has become less important to the British people.\", \"\\u201cWhen it became national news,\\u201d he said, \\u201cI thought: \\u2018Really?
