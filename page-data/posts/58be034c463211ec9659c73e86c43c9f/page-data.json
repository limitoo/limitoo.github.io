He spent nearly six months in jail prior to his sentencing.\", \"\\\"This is the day that you hope will come when you do this work,\\\" Richardson said in a statement emailed by his office. \\\"We are so grateful that Danny will finally be able to reconnect with his loved ones, who have been advocating for him all this time, against immense odds.\\\"\", \"Fenster will return to the U.S. via Qatar over the next day and a half, according to the statement.\", \"\\\"We are overjoyed that Danny has been released and is on his way home \\u2014 we cannot wait to hold him in our arms,\\\" his family said in a statement.\", \"According to the United Nations, at least 126 journalists, media officials or publishers have been detained by the military since the takeover and 47 remain in custody, though not all of them have been charged.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932381/myanmar-us-journalist-released-danny-fenster.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">In this photo provided by the Myanmar Military True News Information Team, released American journalist Danny Fester writes on a document while seated between two police officers at the Naypyitaw International Airport in Naypyitaw, Myanmar Monday, Nov. 15, 2021. Fenster, who was recently sentenced to 11 years of hard labor after spending nearly six months in jail in military-ruled Myanmar, has been freed. A former U.S. diplomat who helped negotiate the release said Fenster was on his way home Monday.</div>\", \"Fenster was one of more than 100 journalists, media officials or publishers who have been detained since the military ousted the elected government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi in February, and his was the harshest sentence yet.\", \"\\\"We are tremendously grateful to all the people who have helped secure his release, especially Ambassador Richardson, as well as our friends and the public who have expressed their support and stood by our sides as we endured these long and difficult months,\\\" his family said.\", \"He has been in detention since he was arrested at Yangon International Airport on May 24 as he was headed to the Detroit area in the United States to see his family.\", \"\\\"We welcome the release of American journalist Daniel Fenster from prison in Burma, where he was wrongfully detained for almost six months,\\\" U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement, using an old name for the country. \\\"We are glad that Danny will soon be reunited with his family as we continue to call for the release of others who remain unjustly imprisoned in Burma.\\\"\", \"Frontier Myanmar Editor-in-Chief Thomas Kean echoed those sentiments.\", \"\\\"Danny is one of many journalists in Myanmar who have been unjustly arrested simply for doing their job since the February coup,\\\" he said.\", \"In a statement broadcast on state TV, the military said that Fenster had been released at the request of Richardson and the chairman of the Japan-Myanmar Friendship Association. Japan, unlike the United States and the European Union, does not take a publicly confrontational stance with the military-installed government, and would like to see improved relations between Myanmar and the West.\", \"\\\"The Burmese generals were convinced that it wasn't worth it to hang on to Danny,\\\" U.S. Rep. Andy Levin of Michigan told Detroit radio station WWJ. \\\"He was innocent and he was just an annoyance for them. If they kept him and anything really happened to him, we would never forget it. We would never forgive them.\\\"\", \"Richardson said he discussed Fenster's release during a recent visit to Myanmar when he held face-to-face negotiations with Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the country's ruler.\", \"Richardson is best known for traveling to nations with which Washington has poor, if any, relations \\u2014 such as North Korea \\u2014 to obtain the freedom of detained Americans. Recently he has been involved in seeking freedom for U.S. citizens detained in Venezuela.\", \"In an interview with The Associated Press after his most recent visit to Myanmar, Richardson said his talks there had focused on facilitating humanitarian assistance to the country, particularly the provision of COVID-19 vaccines. That mission also resulted in the release from jail of Aye Moe, a young woman who used to work for Richardson's center on women's empowerment issues.\", \"When asked by the AP if there was hope for Fenster's release, he replied: \\\"There's always hope. Don't ask any more.\\\"\", \"Shawn Crispin, Southeast Asia representative for the Committee to Protect Journalists, said Fenster \\\"never should have been jailed or sentenced on bogus charges in the first place.\\\"\", \"\\\"Myanmar's military regime must stop using journalists as pawns in their cynical games and release all the other reporters still languishing behind bars on spurious charges,\\\" Crispin added.\", \"During Fenster's trial, prosecution witnesses testified that they were informed by a letter from the Information Ministry that its records showed that Fenster continued to be employed this year by the online news site Myanmar Now \\u2014 one of dozens of outlets ordered shut in the press crackdown.\", \"Both his former and current employers issued public statements that Fenster had left Myanmar Now last year, and his lawyer said defense testimony, as well as income tax receipts, established that he works for Frontier Myanmar. But without a government official's testimony to that effect, the judge only took into account the letter from the Information Ministry.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932386/myanmar-us-journalist-released-danny-fenster.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">In this photo provided by the Richardson Center, former U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.
