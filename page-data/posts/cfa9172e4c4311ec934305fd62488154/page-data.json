I believe, sometime in September, September 5 I want to say, they had over a million dollars and bail was set and able to be posted in September.\", \"\\\"So they could have had me sign the waiver for extradition and had me back in Wisconsin, and I could have been bailed out by mid-September, but they wanted to keep me in jail until November 20,\\\" he added.\", \"Rittenhouse accused the pair of trying to raise money for his bail \\\"so they can take it for their own benefit, not trying to set me free.\\\"\", \"Speaking hours after Rittenhouse's acquittal, his current attorney, Mark Richards, accused Wood and Pierce of \\\"trying to whore this kid out for money, for their own causes.\\\"\", \"Wood is now attempting to get the $2 million he helped raise for Rittenhouse back.
