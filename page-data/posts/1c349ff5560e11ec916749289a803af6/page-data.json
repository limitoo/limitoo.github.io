vaccine rollout there was initially slow, hampered by misinformation and hesitancy.\", \"But a dedicated team of local Aboriginal health workers worked hard to fix it and did.\", \"Only accessible by air or boat, the island community of Galiwin'ku is 520 kilometres away from Darwin and home to about 2,000 people.\", \"In recent weeks and months, vaccination rates have turned around\\u00a0in

vaccination rates.\", \"More recently in the Northern Territory, Binjari and neighbouring Rockhole, which initially had very low vaccine coverage, reached 100 per cent first dose rate during the most
