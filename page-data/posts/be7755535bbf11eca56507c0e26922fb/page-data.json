Trump, presenting evidence of Mr. Meadows\\u2019s deep involvement in the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\", \"In the 51-page document, the committee said it wanted to question Mr. Meadows about an email he had sent a day before the attack advising that the National Guard would be used to defend Trump supporters. The panel said it also wanted to ask him about an exchange with an unnamed senator about rejecting electors for Joseph R. Biden Jr.\", \"Mr. Meadows had been cooperating with the committee\\u2019s investigation, but he refused to appear for a scheduled deposition last week or to turn over additional documents, citing Mr. Trump\\u2019s assertion of executive privilege. The committee, which is controlled by Democrats, is slated to vote on Monday to recommend a contempt of Congress charge against him for his refusal to cooperate with its subpoena. That charge carries a penalty of up to a year in jail.\", \"Before coming to loggerheads with the panel, Mr. Meadows provided more than 9,000 pages of records to the committee. The information they contained raised additional questions, the panel said.\", \"Among the emails and text messages that Mr. Meadows turned over were the following, the panel said:\", \"The committee also said it had a number of questions prompted by Mr. Meadows\\u2019s new book, \\u201cThe Chief\\u2019s Chief,\\u201d and cited it as evidence that his refusal to testify was \\u201cuntenable.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMr. Meadows has shown his willingness to talk about issues related to the Select Committee\\u2019s investigation across a variety of media platforms \\u2014 anywhere, it seems, except to the Select Committee,\\u201d the panel wrote.\", \"The committee said it also had questions about why Mr. Meadows had used a personal cellphone, a Signal account and two personal Gmail accounts to conduct official business, and whether he had properly turned over all records from those accounts to the National Archives.\", \"The report comes as the committee is scrutinizing a 38-page PowerPoint document containing plans to overturn Mr. Biden\\u2019s victory. That document, which Mr. Meadows provided to the committee, urged Mr. Trump to declare a national emergency to cling to power and included an unsupported claim that China and Venezuela had obtained control over the voting infrastructure in a majority of states.\", \"Mr. Meadows\\u2019s lawyer has said he provided the document to the committee because he had received it by email and did nothing with it.\", \"Phil Waldron, a retired Army colonel who has promoted false claims of election fraud, said that he had circulated the document among Mr. Trump\\u2019s allies and among lawmakers on Capitol Hill in the days before the mob violence. Mr. Giuliani has identified Mr. Waldron as a source of information for his legal campaign.\", \"Mr. Waldron told The Washington Post that he had visited the White House several times after last year\\u2019s election and spoken with Mr. Meadows \\u201cmaybe eight to 10 times.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"be7755535bbf11eca56507c0e26922fb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"be7755535bbf11eca56507c0e26922fb"}},
