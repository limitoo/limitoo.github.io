Google in an effort to figure out what was wrong.\", \"\\\"We thought I had postnatal depression and anxiety so I quickly reached out for help and tried to get some medical help through the GP,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"It took about two weeks to really get the help I needed and in that time my mental health deteriorated to the point that I really was in a suicidal state.\\\"\", \"Ms Knight ended up in the emergency department at Werribee's Mercy Hospital, a move she credited with saving her life.\", \"\\\"I was admitted to the mother-baby unit, which was a really scary moment for me, but at
