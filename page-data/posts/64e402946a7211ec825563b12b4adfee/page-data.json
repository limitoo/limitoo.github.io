This time in December the Blackcaps were in India, preparing for the second test at Mumbai - where a record defeat followed.\", \"But now as we start the New Zealand home summer, there are plenty of storylines to keep things interesting for Blackcaps fans.\", \"First up, this series will be the last time we see Ross Taylor in whites, with the Blackcaps' all-time leading run scorer to call time on his career after the second match.\", \"Ajaz Patel became the first New Zealander to take all 10 wickets in an innings in the Blackcaps' last test outing. But he won't even be running the drinks today, dropped to accommodate the four-pronged seam attack of Tim Southee, Trent Boult, Kyle Jamieson and Neil Wagner.\", \"Devon Conway returns to the side after missing that India series with a broken hand, and will replace regular captain Kane Williamson at No.3 in the batting order - a hint of a post-Taylor world for New Zealand.\", \"The only real selection question for the Blackcaps will be who takes the all-rounder spot? With Rachin Ravindra and Daryl Mitchell contesting the final place in the XI.\", \"Bangladesh meanwhile are on a hiding to nothing. The Tigers have never bested the Blackcaps in New Zealand, and will have to try and do so this time without two of their best players in Shakib al Hasan and Tamim Iqbal, rested and recovering from injury respectively.\", \"TAB odds: NZ $1.06, Bangladesh $21, draw $8.80\", \"Teams (predicted):\", \"New Zealand: 1-Tom Latham (c), 2-Will Young, 3-Devon Conway, 4-Ross Taylor, 5-Henry Nicholls, 6-Tom Blundell (wk), 7-Rachin Ravindra, 8-Kyle Jamieson, 9-Tim Southee, 10-Neil Wagner, 11-Trent Boult.\", \"Bangladesh: 1-Shadman Islam, 2-Mahmudul Hasan Joy, 3-Najmul Hassan Shanto, 4-Mominul Haque (c), 5-Mushfiqur Rahim, 6-Liton Das (wk), 7-Yasir Ali, 8-Mehidy Hasan Miraz, 9-Taskin Ahmed, 10-Abu Jayed, 11-Ebadot Hossain.\"]","href_hash":"64e402946a7211ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"64e402946a7211ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
