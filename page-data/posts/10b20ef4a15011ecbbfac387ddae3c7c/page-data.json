The main electric supply to plant \\u2014 site of the 1986 explosion and meltdown that traumatized the world \\u2014 was cut off on Wednesday, with Ukrainian authorities blaming\\u00a0Russia's invading forces\\u00a0for the blackout and warning that it could lead to \\\"nuclear discharge.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"A Ukrainian national emergency services agency\\u00a0said\\u00a0if power to the plant's cooling systems \\u2014 which keep spent nuclear fuel safely surrounded by water \\u2014 is not ensured, it could create a \\\"radioactive cloud\\\" that would blow over \\\"other regions of Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Europe.\\\"\", \"The U.N.-backed global nuclear watchdog agency, the IAEA, downplayed concerns of an imminent radioactive release, saying the spent fuel was old enough and there was enough water around it in the cooling tanks to prevent a disaster, even without power. The IAEA and Ukrainian officials said backup diesel generators at the site would also be able to keep vital systems running for two to three days.\", \"On Thursday, Russia claimed the power supply cable had been restored by a team of engineers who crossed into Ukraine from Belarus, but the IAEA and Ukrainian officials said work to repair the line was still ongoing.\", \"Then came the warning from Ukraine's Defense Intelligence Agency that \\\"a man-made catastrophe is planned at the Russian-controlled Chornobyl NPP [Nuclear Power Plant], responsibility for which the occupiers will try to shift to Ukraine.\\\" \", \"CBS News is seeking information on the alleged plot by Russia from U.S. officials and the IAEA. American and European officials have warned for many weeks, even before Putin ordered the invasion of Ukraine, that the Russian leader could seek to stage \\\"false flag\\\" attacks to blame on Ukraine as a pretext for military action.\", \"The Ukrainian government said in its Friday statement that Chernobyl remained completely disconnected from IAEA monitoring systems and was \\\"de-energized,\\\" noting, two days after the power cut, that the \\\"service life of the available diesel generators is designed for 48 hours of maintenance of safety systems.\\\"\", \"Russian forces in control of the plant \\\"refused to grant access to the station to Ukrainian repair people,\\\" Ukraine's Ministry of Defense said in the statement on Friday.
