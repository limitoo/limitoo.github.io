Dowling said that Bill Bowey, assistant director in the Office of Student Responsibility and Community Standards, told him that he'd looked at his class schedule and determined Wednesday to be a suitable time.\", \"Since declining to attend the meeting, Dowling said he's been told he now has until 5 p.m. Wednesday to submit a typed written statement defending himself and that the matter would be decided by the two administration members present when the incident took place.\", \"It was back on December 1 that Dowling was posting and handing out flyers near Grand Avenue and West Pine, on or around university grounds, to promote that night's speaking event featuring the controversial political commentator Walsh. The talk, co-hosted by the SLU College Republicans, of which Dowling is a member, and Young America's Foundation, was to be focused on anti-abortion issues.\", \"The event's location had been canceled twice, first by the university, which had initially given approval for the speaking engagement, and then by St. Francis Xavier Church, which is located on campus. At the last minute, students were trying to let those who wanted to attend know that it would now take place at The Coronado hotel.\", \"Dowling said that he and two other students were approached by Jackie Weber, the director of the school's Student Involvement Center, and David Young, director of events, Busch Student Center, who expressed they were uncomfortable with SLU's name being on the same flyer as SLU College Republicans.\", \"Weber and Young told Dowling to take the flyers down, to which Dowling offered to cross out the name where he could. More discussion ensued with Dowling stating he would come back and re-post the flyers, as shown in the video above. He insisted that he was not in violation of any school policy.\", \"On December 9, Dowling received an email from Bowey regarding the December 1 incident. The letter alleged that Dowling was \\\"posting unapproved signs for an off-campus event,\\\" and \\\"that when contacted by University staff, you were allegedly confrontational, disrespectful, and failed to comply with reasonable requests made by the staff in accordance with their duties.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952727/saint-louis-university-letter.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A letter emailed to student James Dowling from Saint Louis University's Office of Student Responsibility and Community Standards on December 9.</div>\", \"Dowling was cited as violating the community standards of \\\"Failure to Comply\\\" and \\\"Inappropriate Conduct\\\" and was required to attend the hearing for his \\\"Suspendable Violations.\\\"\", \"\\\"In compliance with federal privacy laws, FERPA, and out of respect for our students' privacy, the University does not confirm, deny or comment on student conduct matters,\\\" Bebermeyer stated.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952730/witness-account-brian-shard.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Saint Louis University student Brian Shard sent this witness account to school administrators in defense of James Dowling.</div>\", \"Nicholas Baker, president of the SLU College Republicans, alleged this is \\\"yet another case of politically-motivated prosecution\\\" by the university's Office of Student Responsibility and Community Standards.\", \"According to Baker, the university had placed a prior marketing ban on the group because a previous poster didn't feature a large enough image of the \\\"masked Billiken.\\\" The Billiken is a mythological good luck figure and is SLU's mascot. Baker said the ban never stipulated it applied to materials posted off-campus and that SLU College Republicans had permission from the Student Involvement Center to co-sponsor the event. The posters for the Matt Walsh event were printed by Young America's Foundation.\", \"\\\"I'm sure that my own days at SLU are also numbered now that I've very publicly expressed my disdain for the SLU's left-wing agenda, but I will spend every minute I have left defending our rights and true Catholic values, no matter how many students, faculty, and administrators disagree,\\\" he added.\", \"Dowling said the whole situation has sullied his view of higher education.\", \"\\\"It doesn't feel good during finals week to have this extra burden of stress put on me\\u2014I'm just a student trying to get through my finals,\\\" said Dowling, noting his parents pay $50,000 a year for his education. \\\"It's not a Catholic university with actual Catholic values\\u2014it's a bait and switch. I'd argue it's more of an indoctrination camp for Woke-ism.
