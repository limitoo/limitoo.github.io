He\\u2019s intelligent, funny, but also physically unpleasant and somehow both juvenile and pedantic at the same time. The problem is they\\u2019ve just gotten married and they\\u2019re expecting a baby. They\\u2019ve been fighting over her desire for the child to have an emotional connection to her Judaism, which is secular and hazy, and when she tells her gentile husband this for the first time, he laughs, \\u201conce and loudly, like a king at some forced merriment.\\u201d\", \"I thought: I recognize this type of person. But I also thought: After all the Philip Roth novels in this world, why am I reading this particular story now? Not long ago I evacuated my home because of Hurricane Ida while the Delta variant ran rampant, as if we\\u2019d returned right back to the beginning of Covid time, violent time, dead time, and the story\\u2019s moves felt to me vaguely of another era, though I found I could still enjoy its virtuosity and laugh at its jokes.\", \"But the piece had more in mind than I knew. The husband is so strident in his atheism that he makes you want to go out and find religion, and in a peculiar way the narrative itself enacts this desire. It zooms out in the end to a kind of cosmic distance on the couple, as the unnamed woman, following her unnamed husband out of a Roman synagogue where he has done something unforgivable, notices how quiet it is: \\u201cAnd she knew this, this sound, this sound of hope collapsing, of separate divinities forming, of exclusion, of closed doors, of one story\\u2019s end.\\u201d I did not expect to arrive at this moment \\u2014 it wasn\\u2019t until the last sentence that the story revealed what it intended all along.\", \"The next, \\u201cMy Interview With the Avenger,\\u201d surprised me in a similar way. It seemed at first too much like a comic sketch, a parody of an Esquire profile (albeit a funny and note-perfect one), and it was also about a superhero, the titular Avenger, which for me is basically kryptonite. But the story is set in 2007, at the end of the Bush years, and the narrator has an ax to grind from the beginning: He wants us to know that the Avenger is not a hero but a vigilante. The Avenger is shown to be part of a subculture of self-appointed public saviors with names like Terrifica or Polar Man, whose \\u201cLycra often poorly contains their girth.\\u201d The United States has of course produced a host of less flamboyant real-life variants of these adventurers \\u2014 Bissell himself invokes Bernard Goetz \\u2014 and as I was presented with a litany of these dumb, costumed, well-equipped men, I began to think not only of Goetz but of Travis Bickle from \\u201cTaxi Driver,\\u201d then George Bush in his leather flight jacket, and then even the Q Shaman and his co-insurrectionists, right down to the Avenger\\u2019s utility belt with its \\u201cpellets of tear gas, smoke bombs, a supply of plastic zip ties.\\u201d These connections are not as tenuous as they may sound, for the portrait of the Avenger grows darker as the story continues, the masked hero less ridiculous and more suggestive, more insinuating, until even the sardonic narrator sees in him something like his own troubling reflection.\", \"The best stories here may be rooted in mockery or satire, but as they grow up and out they unfurl what had been latent inside them. Not all of them get to this level. A fantasia on John Yoo, who authored the so-called Torture Memos during the Bush administration, never quite comes alive as more than a concept. A riff on James Franco is kind of like an episode of \\u201c30 Rock\\u201d in print form. But on every page of this book Bissell sees life with mordant clarity and finds words not only to describe it but to reanimate it. The formidable \\u201cPunishment\\u201d begins as an awkward reunion between a young, flailing writer and a heartless friend from childhood with whom he used to bully classmates. By the end, it evokes a particularly American hollowness in the form of Steve, the vividly realized sociopath, and also works in an apt quote from Nietzsche that resonates throughout the entire book: \\u201cThe evil who are happy \\u2014 a species the moralists bury in silence.\\u201d \\u201cLove Story, With Cocaine,\\u201d perhaps my favorite, gives us another portrait of unrepentant malice. Despite the ironically arched brow of its title and its black humor, it\\u2019s also a moving account of a doomed affair between a young Estonian woman and an American expat who both suffer all the more for their efforts not to feel.\", \"Vigilantes, bullies, expats: To tell you the \\u201csubjects\\u201d of these stories is to tell you almost nothing about the experience of reading them, their stylistic flair, the unpredictability of their movement. They reminded me of how fiction can be not just a form of escape but a way to get lost in the actual strangeness of this world, those crooked roads that lead us through flashes of horror, delight and sudden recognition.\"]","href_hash":"934b70e95cc811ec9d251f7281e97d2c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"934b70e95cc811ec9d251f7281e97d2c"}},
