His claim to victory would deliver another a blow to President Biden\\u2019s agenda in the region, where the administration has failed to slow an anti-democratic slide and a mass exodus of desperate people toward the United States. \", \"A record number of Nicaraguans have been intercepted crossing the southwest border this year as thousands fled the country after Mr. Ortega began crushing his opposition. And more than 80,000 Nicaraguans are living as refugees in neighboring Costa Rica.\", \"\\u201cThis is a turning point toward authoritarianism in the region,\\u201d said Jos\\u00e9 Miguel Vivanco, head of the Americas region for Human Rights Watch, who called Mr. Ortega\\u2019s crackdown \\u201ca slow motion horror movie.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe is not even trying to preserve some sort of facade of democratic rule,\\u201d Mr. Vivanco said of the Nicaraguan leader. \\u201cHe is in a flagrant, open manner, just deciding to treat the election as a performance.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Ortega in June accused the opposition of trying to foment a coup. \\u201cWe are not judging candidates,\\u201d he said of his critics who had been arrested. \\u201cWe are judging criminals who have threatened the country.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Ortega first came to power after helping lead the revolution that overthrew the dictatorship of Anastasio Somoza in 1979. More than a decade later, he was ousted by Nicaraguan voters, in what was considered the nation\\u2019s first democratic election.\", \"That lesson about the risks of democratic rule appears to have shaped the rest of Mr. Ortega\\u2019s political life. He took office again in 2007, after getting a rival party to agree to a legal reform that allowed a candidate to win an election with just 35 percent of the vote. He then spent years undermining the institutions holding together the country\\u2019s fragile democracy.\", \"He made it clear that he would not tolerate dissent in 2018, when he sent police to violently smother anti-government protests, leading to hundreds of deaths and accusations by human rights groups of crimes against humanity.\", \"But the sudden sweep of arrests preceding the elections, which sent seven political candidates and more than 150 others to jail, transformed the country into what many activists described as a police state, where even mild expressions of dissent are muted by fear.\", \"A sportswriter was recently imprisoned for a series of posts critical of the government on Twitter and Facebook, under a new law that mandates up to five years in jail for anyone who says anything that \\u201cendangers economic stability\\u201d or \\u201cpublic order.\\u201d \", \"After the detentions began, the United States placed new sanctions on Nicaraguan officials and the Organization of American States condemned the government. This month, Congress passed legislation demanding more punitive measures on Nicaragua. But that pressure has not stopped Mr. Ortega from systematically eliminating any obstacle to his victory on Sunday.\", \"A recent poll showed that 78 percent of Nicaraguans see the possible re-election of Mr. Ortega as illegitimate and just 9 percent support the ruling party. Yet many refuse to question the government in public, afraid that they will be arrested or harassed by Sandinista party representatives who are stationed in every neighborhood to monitor political activities.\", \"The leader of one electoral watchdog group, Olga Valle, left the country after Mr. Ortega\\u2019s government began targeting anyone who spoke out against it.\", \"\\u201cThere was a lot of fear of showing your face,\\u201d said Ms. Valle. \\u201cThere is a total restriction of freedoms, people have absolutely no ability to meet, to organize.\\u201d\", \"The first aspiring presidential candidate to be targeted was Cristiana Chamorro, Nicaragua\\u2019s most prominent opposition leader and the daughter of the woman who unseated Mr. Ortega in 1990 after his first stint in power.\", \"Police officers put Ms. Chamorro under house arrest on a Wednesday in June \\u2014 the day after Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered remarks on the importance of strengthening democracy next door in Costa Rica.\", \"F\\u00e9lix Maradiaga, who also planned to run against Mr. Ortega, was tossed in jail days later and kept there for months before his sister was allowed a 20-minute visit.\", \"His wife, Berta Valle, who has been in exile in the United States since facing threats after the 2018 protests, said her husband has lost 45 pounds and for months his only bathroom was a hole in his cell. He told family that he is forced to remain in complete silence, except when he is subjected to daily interrogations. \\u201cIt\\u2019s psychological torture,\\u201d she said.\", \"Mr. Maradiaga has been allowed one meeting with his lawyer, surrounded by heavily armed guards, his wife added. That lawyer has since fled the country.\", \"By August, the only opposition party left standing was Citizens for Liberty, a movement on the right that some speculated would be allowed to run to at least give the impression of a fair fight. But then the electoral commission held a news conference announcing the party had been shut down.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t even finish watching it,\\u201d said Kitty Monterrey, the party\\u2019s president. \\u201cI grabbed my passports and I ran. I didn\\u2019t look back.\\u201d\", \"She slipped out in the late afternoon, avoiding the police who had been stationed out front. To reach Costa Rica, Ms. Monterrey trudged through rivers on foot and horseback for 14 hours. She turned 71 the day of her journey.\", \"\\u201cThis is not an election process at all,\\u201d Ms. Monterrey said. \\u201cElections are when you have the right to choose, but everyone is either in exile or in prison.\\u201d\", \"There are no election observers in Nicaragua, only so-called \\u201celection companions,\\u201d a hodgepodge of officials brought in from countries like Spain, Argentina and Chile, many of whom are members of their local communist parties. Their job, one member of the electoral commission recently said, is not to \\u201cintervene\\u201d but rather to \\u201cwatch\\u201d and \\u201cenjoy\\u201d the voting process.\", \"Across the country, there are few signs that a contest for the nation\\u2019s highest office is underway.\", \"Gigantic images of Mr. Ortega and his wife, who is his vice president, loom over the streets. Vaccination sites play revolutionary jingles with titles like \\u201cthe commander stays.\\u201d Government buildings fly the flag of the Sandinista party next to the national flag of Nicaragua.\", \"But aside from a smattering of fliers with opposition party logos in Managua, the capital, there are no billboards or campaign posters featuring anyone else.\", \"\\u201cOrtega\\u2019s mask is off,\\u201d said Ms. Valle, the wife of the imprisoned opposition leader. \\u201cHe can\\u2019t hide anymore.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f014caf13fb211ec8e4b8d631d452a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f014caf13fb211ec8e4b8d631d452a2b"}},
