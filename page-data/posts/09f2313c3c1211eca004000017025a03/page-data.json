Unvaccinated children under 18 will be allowed in if they are traveling with a fully vaccinated adult, officials said on Tuesday.\", \"This applies to travelers crossing at official ports of entry, as well as those arriving by passenger train. Officials said it did not matter if the proof of vaccination was in a language other than English.\", \"The long-awaited reopening on Nov. 8 comes just ahead of the holiday season, clearing the way for tourists and other nonessential travelers after about 19 months of border closures during the pandemic. It follows a recent decision by the Biden administration to reopen the country to vaccinated foreigners traveling by air.
