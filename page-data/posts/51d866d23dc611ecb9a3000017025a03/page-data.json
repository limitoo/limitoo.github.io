There are pieces that are gravel and have an uneven camber on them and in the winter we obviously have a significant amount of ice.\\\"\", \"The practice was happening on other local school buses, she said.\", \"\\\"There's a lot of five, six, seven-year-olds. Those children seated aren't able to touch the ground when sitting properly on the seats. If you're putting three to a seat, they struggle to ... put their back against the back rests,\\\" Pringle said.\", \"\\\"There's no arm rest to hold them in so that's easy to hang over the aisle. If the bus was to suddenly stop, there's very little to actually stop them from going flying so if children were standing that would be even worse.\\\"\", \"Her school has three buses offering 135 seats.\", \"But 210 students - 70 percent of the school's roll - were eligible for the school bus.\", \"\\\"We are going through a sustained period of growth for our school so on a regular basis we are having to review what bus provision we've got.\\\"\", \"She approached the Ministry of Education for another bus, but said she was told they provide one because she couldn't show that students were regularly stand up on buses even though there could be three children to a seat.\", \"To meet that threshold, the bus would need to be filled to maximum loading capacity - about 65 children seated and 10 standing.\", \"\\\"We are not willing to do that and we are not willing to allow our children to do that so because that's not happening on a daily basis, the Ministry of Education has said that we don't need any more bus provisions and they're not willing to review it.\\\"\", \"Queenstown Lakes District Mayor Jim Boult was fired up about the issue he thought had been resolved.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/113382/eight_col_original_Jim_boult.jpg?1605850910\\\" alt=\\\"Queenstown Lakes District mayor Jim Boult \\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nQueenstown Lakes District Mayor Jim Boult. \\nPhoto: RNZ / Belinda McCammon\\n</div>\", \"It has been more than three years since Waka Kotahi informed him that the Secretary for Education had decided to stop the practice and the Ministry of Education was working on that directive with an expected cost of around $20 million a year.\", \"He has sent a letter to the Prime Minister and other ministers, saying he was disappointed and shocked when schools informed him that a significant number of children would stand in the aisles under the new school bus tender arrangements.\", \"It was time to act on an issue that had long put tamariki needlessly at risk, he said.\", \"\\\"We live in an area with challenging road conditions, particularly during the long winter months.

While thankfully no children have died in these 529 crashes, shouldn't we do everything in our power to prevent any child from becoming the first one? Aren't we responsible for making sure they can travel to school each and every day safe from the chance of harm and injury?\\\"\", \"Ministry of Education infrastructure and digital leader Scott Evans said new contracts would come into effect next January after asking bidders to confirm they could provide enough seats to cater for expected numbers of eligible students.\", \"The contracts were due to expire at the end of last year but they were extended by one year to allow time to update the procurement process and make sure there were opportunities for smaller, regional suppliers, he said.\", \"\\\"Under new contracts which come into effect in January 2022, suppliers are able to carry standing passengers to allow for a necessary degree of operational flexibility to manage fluctuating demand and to ensure that no eligible student is left behind,\\\" Evans said.\", \"\\\"Operators will be required to regularly report on any standing passengers so we can monitor and manage the situation if the number of students using the school bus services increases above what is expected.\", \"\\\"Waka Kotahi sets the safety standards for school buses that the Ministry of Education and their transport service providers must follow.
