It was also the first time lawmakers gathered to vote since the requirement that anyone entering the statehouse complex show a negative COVID-19 test or proof of vaccination was implemented.\", \"Tables with officials checking documents were set up at entrances around the complex, poster boards announcing the new policy stood on easels and state troopers milled around the building as well.\", \"Some Republicans who flouted the rule said it was unenforceable and contended it ran afoul of the state constitution.\", \"\\\"It's unfair and completely discriminatory policy. They're essentially creating two classes of people, vaccinated and unvaccinated,\\\" Bergen said.\", \"But others reluctantly abided by it.
