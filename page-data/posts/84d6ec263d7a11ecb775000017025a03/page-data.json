It was a hushed, long-breathed album with a haunted twang, yet it turned into a blockbuster \\u2014 selling more than a million copies and winning five Grammy Awards including album of the year.\", \"A follow-up would have seemed like an obvious next step. Yet it has taken 14 years for the arrival of that sequel: \\u201cRaise the Roof,\\u201d due Nov. 19.\", \"\\u201cRaise the Roof\\u201d almost magically reclaims the spectral tone of \\u201cRaising Sand,\\u201d then finds ways to expand on it, delving further into both quiet subtleties and wailing intensity. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a little bit more smoky, a little bit more lustrous than the first record,\\u201d Plant, 73, said by phone from his home in western England.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely different, even though it might be coming out of the same sort of crevasse, the same fork in the landscape of our musical lives. It has a mood to it, which is laced with time and with the actual age and maturity of the songs themselves.\\u201d\", \"But the musicians needed a decade of reflection between albums. \\u201cIf we had thought we knew what we were doing in the first place, we could probably have repeated it,\\u201d T Bone Burnett, 73, the producer and linchpin of both albums, said by telephone from Nashville. \\u201cBut we didn\\u2019t. At the time, we were just kind of goofing off, having fun. And that\\u2019s what we were up against. We\\u2019ve been waiting for it to get to that point where we could just have fun doing it again.\\u201d\", \"Plant and Krauss were an unlikely pairing from the start. \\u201cWe were from two radically different worlds,\\u201d Plant said. He was the world-conquering, musically restless rock singer who had fronted Led Zeppelin. Krauss was already a luminary in the more close-knit world of bluegrass and Americana, leading the string band Union Station.\", \"They were also strikingly disparate singers, with contrasting musical instincts. Krauss, 50, grew up harmonizing in bluegrass groups, figuring out and delivering restrained, precise, locked-in ensemble parts. \\u201cI\\u2019m a regimented-type singer,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBluegrass people sing things very consistently, because there\\u2019s three parts going on most times. And if someone pulls around and goes and does something different, now the other two want to run you over with their car.\\u201d\", \"Plant was used to a lead singer\\u2019s free rein; he would improvise with every take. \\u201cI try to sing across the beat quite a bit,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf it\\u2019s a straightforward groove, I like to bounce across the left and right of the groove. I did it in Zeppelin. I kind of scuttle it, accelerate it, slow it down.\\u201d He chuckled. \\u201cIt drives them mad.\\u201d\", \"Krauss grew to appreciate their differences. \\u201cIt makes you feel like you\\u2019re hanging off the edge of a cliff,\\u201d she said by telephone from her home in Nashville. \\u201cIt is so exciting and so magnificent.\\u201d Plant and Krauss first sang together as part of a 2004 tribute to Lead Belly, and Plant proposed that they try recording together when their schedules aligned; that took more than a year. Plant initially suggested trying just three days in the studio to see if anything worked out.\", \"They enlisted Burnett, who had recently reimagined old-timey Appalachian music for the soundtrack to \\u201cO Brother, Where Art Thou?,\\u201d which featured Union Station. For \\u201cRaising Sand,\\u201d the three gathered songs \\u2014 mostly about tragic lost loves \\u2014 and transfigured them with close harmonies and an aura of suspended time. Burnett\\u2019s studio band let tempos hover and undulate; Plant and Krauss discovered how uncannily their voices could fit together.\", \"\\u201cA funny thing happens with them,\\u201d Burnett said. \\u201cWhen the two of them sing, it creates a third voice, a third part in their harmonies when there are only two parts. You know, one plus one equals two unless you\\u2019re counting, say, drops of rain. Then one plus one could equal one, or one plus one could equal a fine mist. Their voices are in that relative space where they sing together and it creates a fine mist.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cRaising Sand\\u201d was an otherworldly alternative to virtually all of its pop contemporaries (its competition at the Grammys included Lil Wayne\\u2019s \\u201cTha Carter III\\u201d and Ne-Yo\\u2019s \\u201cYear of the Gentleman\\u201d), and although it was released on the folky independent label Rounder, eager listeners sought it out. It reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart.\", \"Plant already had another project underway in 2007: the arena-sized last hurrah of Led Zeppelin that December. But the Led Zeppelin performance was an endpoint, while \\u201cRaising Sand\\u201d was a new beginning. Plant and Krauss toured for much of the next year, with concert sets that included some revamped Led Zeppelin songs. They plan to tour again in 2022.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve got a kind of a personality which we could pursue as two singers, a neat place that we made for ourselves,\\u201d Plant said. \\u201cI just liked the idea of actually singing together throughout an entire show, more or less with somebody. Concentrating, listening, being free-form at times. Letting it rip, then being pretty controlled and organized and following instructions from her. And then, sometimes, letting go so she can\\u2019t catch me.\\u201d\", \"Yet having a hit album also brought self-consciousness and pressure. Plant and Krauss tried recording new duets with their touring band just after their Grammy sweep in 2009, but scrapped those sessions. \\u201cNothing happened that was really horrible,\\u201d Krauss said. \\u201cWe just felt like it was too much at once.\\u201d\", \"They then returned to their own bands and projects: Krauss with Union Station; Plant leading his Americana-rooted Band of Joy and then, for much of the 2010s, the psychedelia-, trip-hop- and world-music-infused Sensational Space Shifters. \\u201cWe really enjoyed the fact that we have no idea about our corresponding alternative lives,\\u201d Plant said.\", \"Still, the \\u201cRaising Sand\\u201d collaborators stayed in touch. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve been sending songs back and forth for almost 14 years, trying to figure out how to continue,\\u201d Burnett said.\", \"Finally, in 2019, they regrouped. A decade of other work had made the sequel less fraught although \\u201cthere was a little bit of trepidation on my part,\\u201d Plant said. \\u201cI wasn\\u2019t sure whether we could reinvoke what we had. But it was very short-lived, that question of whether or not it was real. It was like, I bow to her, and she curtsies to me, and we see what we can do.\\u201d\", \"They went back to the venerable Nashville studio, Sound Emporium, where they had recorded \\u201cRaising Sand,\\u201d and where Burnett and Krauss have frequently recorded since. (Plant returned there this year, he said, for sessions with the 1950s guitar titans Duane Eddy and James Burton.)\", \"The core rhythm section from \\u201cRaising Sand,\\u201d Jay Bellerose on drums and Dennis Crouch on bass, had continued to work with Burnett and returned for the new album. They were joined by an expanded assortment of guitarists including Marc Ribot; Bill Frisell; David Hidalgo from Los Lobos; and Buddy Miller, a Nashville stalwart who was in Plant\\u2019s Band of Joy. A few songs added collectors\\u2019 item string instruments like a Marxophone and a dolceola, both zithers played with keyboards: tinkling, evocative, echoey, unexpected timbres. Plant and Krauss finished recording in February 2020, just before the pandemic lockdowns.\", \"\\u201cRaise the Roof\\u201d opens with a song from the Arizona band Calexico, \\u201cQuattro (World Drifts In),\\u201d which is filled with images of desolation, escape and war, perhaps conjuring Afghanistan: \\u201cNo choice but to run to the mountains where no poppies grow/You have to hit the ground running.\\u201d\", \"While most of the other songs on \\u201cRaise the Roof\\u201d ponder love, separation and longing, the album has a discreet through line. \\u201cAs we were going through the material,\\u201d Burnett said, \\u201cit was clear that a story was being told concerning a man, a woman and war. And it became clear which songs fit and the sequence they went in.\\u201d\", \"The collaborators returned to some of the songwriters from \\u201cRaising Sand,\\u201d picking up the Everly Brothers\\u2019 \\u201cThe Price of Love\\u201d and the Allen Toussaint song \\u201cTrouble With My Lover,\\u201d which was recorded by Betty Harris. And as on \\u201cRaising Sand,\\u201d they remade tracks that started as blues, old-timey, soul, country, gospel and rock.\", \"Their versions are far removed from the originals, often close to inside-out. Most often, Plant said, \\u201cWe have a kind of languid, sometimes pensive sound, with the pathos of the original song taken into another place.\\u201d\", \"They stripped songs down to just lyrics and melodies, and rebuilt them intuitively in the studio, often around sparse, subtle beats from Bellerose. They shifted \\u201cTrouble With My Lover\\u201d from a major to a minor key, and Krauss trades Harris\\u2019s New Orleans soul resilience for a neo-Appalachian plaint, lingering over the song\\u2019s loneliness and hints of betrayal.\", \"Krauss chose \\u201cGoing Where the Lonely Go,\\u201d a doleful ballad that Merle Haggard released in the 1980s. Plant seized the chance to record a soul song he had been singing since his teens: \\u201cSearching for My Love,\\u201d by Bobby Moore & the Rhythm Aces. He also brought material from Britain\\u2019s 1960s folk revival: Bert Jansch\\u2019s stoically intransigent \\u201cIt Don\\u2019t Bother Me,\\u201d which brings out Krauss\\u2019s defiant streak; and Anne Briggs\\u2019s \\u201cGo Your Way,\\u201d a wife\\u2019s troubled farewell song to a soldier she may never see again.\", \"At one of the album\\u2019s extremes, Plant unleashes his Led Zeppelin wail and echoes of \\u201cKashmir\\u201d in \\u201cHigh and Lonesome,\\u201d a song that grew out of a studio jam session. Burnett and the rhythm section were toying with a Bo Diddley beat. Plant happened to have his book of potential lyrics with him. The title is a tongue-in-cheek country clich\\u00e9; the song is not. It is equally biblical and bluesy, wondering, \\u201cIf I should lose my soul, would you still care for me?\\u201d\", \"At the other end of the dynamic scale is \\u201cThe Price of Love.\\u201d The Everly Brothers\\u2019 own version is an exuberant two-minute, harmonica-topped stomp, though they\\u2019re singing about a cheater\\u2019s bitter regrets. Plant, Krauss and Burnett took the song down to half-speed and removed any distractions. The track opens with half a minute of near-ambience as instruments quietly drop in: a bowed bass drone, shakers, a distant fiddle, eventually a few guitar notes before the beat and chords solidify and Krauss arrives like an accusatory wraith: \\u201cYou won\\u2019t forget her,\\u201d she warns. By taking their time, they concentrate the essence of the song. And as they did with \\u201cRaising Sand,\\u201d they calmly defy the impatience of 21st-century pop.\", \"The song \\u201ckind of forms before your ears,\\u201d Plant said. \\u201cWhen people stick stuff on the radio now, I think you\\u2019re allowed like 16 seconds or even less before you\\u2019re actually hitting a chorus. But then again, we\\u2019re fishing in a different pool. In fact, we\\u2019re not even fishing. We\\u2019re just trying to swim.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"84d6ec263d7a11ecb775000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"84d6ec263d7a11ecb775000017025a03"}},
