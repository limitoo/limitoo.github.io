it draws water into the skin but it doesn't form a film on the skin so it won't interfere with trapping heat or anything like that.\", \"\\\"You can also look for anti-inflammatory ingredients like oatmeal extract, niacinamide - those are two big ones.\\\"\", \"Just don't put on too much moisturiser as that can trap the heat in your skin, Wong said.\", \"Similarly, cocoa butter can form a film on the skin that can potentially trap heat.\", \"If you have really bad sunburn, Wong said, you should see a doctor and see if they could give you a steroid cream.\", \"\\\"You can also take some ibuprofen, which will be anti-inflammatory, and that can help with swelling and any of the redness that might be on your skin,\\\" Wong said.\", \"Aloe vera is commonly recommended as a treatment to soothe sunburn, but Wong warned there were a lot of inconsistencies with the plant extract.\", \"\\\"Sometimes the inner leaf actually has some irritants, so if you just grab some aloe vera from the garden and put it on your skin, sometimes that can risk making it worse,\\\" she said.\", \"Wong said it might be better to use a product that contained aloe vera.\", \"\\\"They might be a bit more careful about making sure it's the right extract but I don't think that's a guarantee.\\\"\", \"Some essential oils are marketed as a way to reduce the symptoms of sunburn and heal the skin, but Wong said they could be harmful.\", \"\\\"Essential oils are commonly irritants and their effects on skin are not very potent,\\\" Wong said.\", \"\\\"It's a big risk with little return.\", \"\\\"I would avoid using essential oils, and definitely not use undiluted essential oils.\\\"\", \"McMillan from Cancer Council Queensland said getting a skin cancer check is something to work into your routine of visiting a doctor.\", \"She said it was also important to know your own skin and check it regularly.\", \"\\\"Look for any new or changing shape, size, colour, thickness of any areas of your skin,\\\" McMillan said.\", \"\\\"It doesn't always have to be a dark-coloured mole that is a suspicious thing - it could be something that's a small pink lump.\", \"\\\"It could be something simple, it's a lesion that hasn't healed properly over, you know, a month, six weeks or so;
