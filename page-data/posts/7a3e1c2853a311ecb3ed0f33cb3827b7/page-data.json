We have to be prepared that there's going to be a diminution in protection.\\\"\", \"The World Health Organisation expects to have more information on the variant's transmissibility within days.\", \"For days, US health officials have said the new variant, first detected in southern Africa and announced on 25 November, was probably already in the United States as dozens of other countries also detected its presence.\", \"\\\"This new variant is a cause for concern but not a cause for panic,\\\" Biden said on Wednesday before the Omicron case was announced.
