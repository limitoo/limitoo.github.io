She attached two images to the post. One picture showed the fried chicken head clearly visible amongst the chicken wings. The other showed the head isolated, sitting on what appears to be the top of the takeout container.\", \"The post has received more than 23,000 engagements.\", \"\\\"I freaked out when I saw it! I couldn't stop gagging,\\\" she told Fox 35 News. \\\"I won't be ordering chicken for a longggg time.\\\"\", \"In a statement obtained by TODAY, Old School Pizza apologized for the mishap and explained that they were investigating the incident with their supplier.\", \"\\\"We've been open nearly 13 years, and have sold TONS of wings every week and have never seen anything like this...The supplier is looking into how such a thing could have happened and how it could have passed through so many checkpoints and gone unnoticed,\\\" the restaurant told TODAY.\", \"\\\"We thank all of our loyal customers and thank everyone that understands that accidents do happen, and some things are just out of our control.\\\"\", \"According to the outlet, the restaurant also offered Paulhamus a refund, but she didn't bother collecting it.\", \"\\\"Honestly, it doesn't matter,\\\" she told TODAY. \\\"Like at the end of the day, it's funny to me now. I look back on [the incident] and I laugh about it more than I'm disgusted by it.\\\"\", \"The fried chicken head isn't the only shocking food-related discovery to make headlines this year. In September, a woman in Bolivia found a human finger inside of her fast-food burger. \", \"She, too, posted the discovery on Facebook, where it also went viral. As a result, the Bolivian vice-minister for the defense of user and consumer rights temporarily closed the restaurant.\", \"In June, a woman found a deep-fried towel mixed in with her fried chicken order.\", \"\\\"I really thought that the posts complaining about weird stuff in their orders were just all made up, now I know that it really happens,\\\" she said in a Facebook post. \\\"So disgusting and embarrassing.\\\"\", \"Many commenters criticized Paulhamus for complaining about the chicken head.\", \"\\\"Oh s**t I got dead animal parts in my box of dead animal parts,\\\" exclaimed one commenter.\", \"\\\"Well thats [sic] what you get for ordering wings at a pizza joint,\\\" said another.\", \"One Facebook commenter responded: \\\"Stop eating chicken if you can't handle seeing the head!\\\"\", \"Paulhamus later updated her post to include a response to all the negative commenters.\", \"\\\"PSA: I did not expect this post to blow up the way it did...Yes I know where the wings come from,\\\" she wrote in her post. \\\"HOWEVER to me it is personally not appetizing to see the chicken head in the wings I ordered. At the end of the day I'm sharing my personal experience and we're all entitled to our own opinions.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1923737/chicken-wings.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A Pennsylvania woman has gone viral for sharing an image of a fried chicken head she found in her takeout wing order.
