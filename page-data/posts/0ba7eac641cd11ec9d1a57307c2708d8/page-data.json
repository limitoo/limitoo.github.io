Businesses have until Jan. 4 to mandate Covid vaccinations for their workers or require them to undergo weekly testing.\", \"The legal challenge was brought by a coalition of plaintiffs, including several employers and Republican-controlled states.\", \"\\u201cThe argument that they\\u2019re making is that it\\u2019s not constitutional,\\u201d said my colleague Lauren Hirsch, who covers business for The Times. \\u201cThey\\u2019re arguing that the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which is the part of the Labor Department that\\u2019s instituting this rule, doesn\\u2019t have the authority to pass it. They\\u2019re saying it would need to be done through legislation by Congress, instead.\\u201d\", \"The Biden administration filed its response to the court challenge yesterday, arguing that the rule was necessary to protect workers from the pandemic and was well grounded in law.\", \"The last time that O.S.H.A. issued a similar emergency standard was in 1983 to lower the legal level of asbestos exposure in the workplace. The following year, the Fifth Circuit overturned the regulation, saying the agency didn\\u2019t prove the order was necessary.\", \"But in the administration\\u2019s response yesterday, the Justice Department argued that \\u201cnon-regulatory options have proved vastly inadequate.\\u201d Companies have already tried many other methods to manage the risk of the virus in offices \\u2014 including incentivizing vaccines and masks \\u2014 and yet the ongoing pandemic still makes them potentially unsafe spaces.\", \"\\u201cMany lawyers that I talked to seem to think that the rules will be upheld,\\u201d Lauren said. \\u201cThe Fifth Circuit may issue a permanent stay, at which point the administration may bring it to the Supreme Court.\\u201d\", \"In the end, the legal battle may not have much effect on the rules, as companies may just move ahead with implementing them. Some trade groups who are unhappy with the mandate have told Lauren they\\u2019re still encouraging companies to begin implementing the rules, because they don\\u2019t think they will be overturned, and putting them in place requires planning.\", \"\\u201cA lot of companies wanted to implement mandates, they just didn\\u2019t want to be the first mover and were worried about litigation,\\u201d Lauren said. \\u201cBut now they can just blame the government. It\\u2019s sort of like blaming Mom, saying she\\u2019s making you leave a party, but secretly, you just want to leave the party.\\u201d\", \"Want to know more? The Times has answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about the vaccine mandate. You can also submit yours here.\", \"Pfizer and BioNTech asked federal regulators today to expand authorization of their coronavirus booster shot to include all adults over the age of 18. The F.D.A. is considered likely to grant the request, perhaps before Thanksgiving.\", \"In mid-September, an advisory board of outside experts to the F.D.A. voted against a similar request from Pfizer and instead recommended booster shots on an emergency basis for those 65 and older or at high risk of Covid-19 because of their medical conditions or jobs.\", \"Those categories were still broad enough to cover at least 60 percent of the population. Some experts have argued that the case for booster shots for the general population is stronger now, citing data from Israel that shows that the aggressive booster campaign there has dramatically limited rates of severe disease, hospitalization and death. They also point out that maintaining complicated eligibility categories may not work anyway.\", \"Moderna is expected to soon request a broadening of its emergency use authorization for its booster dose. All Johnson & Johnson recipients are eligible for a second shot as a booster.\", \"More booster news:\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic.
