It follows parts of Waikato which made this transition last week and sees restrictions ease as the region moves closer towards the 90 percent double dose mark, at which time the traffic light system will come into play.\", \"While many restrictions are easing, some are not. For example, hospitality venues must remain closed, entertainment facilities (like cinemas and casinos) can't yet operate and \\\"close contact businesses\\\" such as barbers or beauty salons must keep the doors closed. Movement for these businesses can be expected at the third step, though no date has been decided for that.\", \"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday that Auckland was being allowed the extra freedoms due to it's high vaccination rates.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Auckland hit 90 percent first dose and 80 percent second dose over the weekend, and is now a matter of weeks away from 90 percent double dose. And so while we're getting those rates higher still, we are easing into our reopening.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The restrictions we've eased to date, we've done so because we know they are the safest ones. For example, evidence shows picnics outside have not led to an uptick in cases, and from barbecues, we have evidence of just one case.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Indoor gatherings, which are not permitted now, nor when we move to step 2, continue to be a major driver of spread. So keeping it outdoors reduces the risk and helps keep cases under control.\\\"\", \"If you want to test your knowledge of the alert level 3, step 2 rules, try out Newshub's quiz here.\\u00a0\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"f822bc2c41f811ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f822bc2c41f811ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
