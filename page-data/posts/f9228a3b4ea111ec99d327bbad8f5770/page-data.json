The listing was rather more highbrow than FlogIt4U\\u2019s usual fare; it was a handwritten score, still wrapped in its original tissue paper.\", \"It turned out to be the manuscript of Malcolm Arnold\\u2019s Seventh Symphony, a work that had been thought lost for 30 years, with movements dedicated to each of its composer\\u2019s three children. It is probable that Arnold, during the period he suffered acutely from debilitating mental illness and was placed under the financial jurisdiction of the United Kingdom\\u2019s Court of Protection, bartered the score to help cover a debt.\", \"That wouldn\\u2019t have been an unusual situation for a composer as troubled \\u2014 and as productive \\u2014 as Arnold. He wrote nine symphonies, seven ballets, more than 20 concertos and 132 film scores, winning an Academy Award for \\u201cThe Bridge on the River Kwai,\\u201d before dying in 2006, at 84. But Alan Poulton, a composer, pianist and writer who is chairman of the Malcolm Arnold Society, has identified at least 18 more works that have simply vanished.\", \"This year, the 100th anniversary of Arnold\\u2019s birth, a petition signed by Julian Lloyd Webber and other musical luminaries forced the British Ministry of Justice to reconsider a decision that threatened to destroy Arnold\\u2019s documents from the time he was under the care of the Court of Protection, in the late 1970s and early \\u201980s; those papers will be relocated to the National Archives. Another large chunk of Arnold\\u2019s archive also has a new home at Eton College \\u2014 though what he, staunchly anti-establishment, might have made of that is anybody\\u2019s guess.\", \"Despite Arnold\\u2019s being one of his country\\u2019s most prominent and popular composers during his lifetime, there have been few celebrations of his centenary. His work was stubbornly, unfashionably tonal, and frequently witty; he pursued neither the pastoral idioms that obsessed Vaughan Williams, nor the serial techniques that burst onto the scene in the 1960s.\", \"\\u201cI always write music that, if I were in the audience, I would like to hear,\\u201d Arnold said at the start of Tony Palmer\\u2019s 2004 documentary about him, \\u201cToward the Unknown Region.\\u201d Though his music certainly possesses a hostile streak \\u2014 listen to the striking volte-face in his \\u201cPeterloo Overture,\\u201d as he depicts armed yeomanry descending on amassed protesters \\u2014 Arnold never gave up on the power of melody. His proclivity for tunefulness runs through his varied output, which fills most corners of the repertory. The symphonies, ballets and concertos sit alongside rambunctious concert works, many pieces for brass and wind band, and the film scores that are arguably his greatest achievement.\", \"At his peak, Arnold wrote over 20 hours of music a year, including six films, demonstrating a maniacal creativity that, together with an unhealthy obsession with sex, periods of complete despondency and unabated alcoholism throughout his adult life, coalesced in a crippling manic-depressive tendency.\", \"The \\u201cBridge on the River Kwai\\u201d score won him an Oscar, but it\\u2019s elsewhere that his wit and vigor are most precisely realized: \\u201cThe Belles of St. Trinian\\u2019s\\u201d (1954), the first in a popular comedy series set in a girls\\u2019 school; the gritty Lancashire tale \\u201cWhistle Down The Wind\\u201d (1961); and \\u201cHobson\\u2019s Choice\\u201d (1954), one of many successful collaborations with the director David Lean. (To his later chagrin, though, he turned down work on Lean\\u2019s \\u201cLawrence of Arabia.\\u201d)\", \"Charming though they are, these films do feel rather dated today, and their musical accompaniment, richly scored in a late Romantic idiom, does too. (\\u201cIf a film score comes out uninfluenced by Berlioz, it\\u2019s no damn good,\\u201d Arnold once said.) The sense of Arnold\\u2019s being profoundly out of fashion extends beyond his cinema work, though. When his Fifth Symphony \\u2014 as close to a canonical masterwork as Arnold wrote \\u2014 was performed this summer at the BBC Proms, it was the first time an Arnold symphony had been done at the Proms since 1994.\", \"Born in Northampton in 1921, Arnold\\u2019s future was certain after he saw a Louis Armstrong concert in Bournemouth at age 13, which fostered his fascination with both the trumpet and jazz, shaping his taste for lush harmonies and driving rhythms. A scholarship to the Royal College of Music meant a move to London, though he was a rebellious student, at one point discovered in the company of a young lady in Plymouth, having run away to play trumpet in a swing band. He left the Royal College at 19, for a trumpet seat in the London Philharmonic Orchestra.\", \"Initially a committed conscientious objector during World War II, Arnold signed up for the war effort following the death of his brother in action, and was eventually posted to a military staff band. Soon after, a sergeant found him in a pool of his own blood: Arnold had intentionally shot himself in the foot, forcing a move back to the orchestra.\", \"Shotguns featured in a decidedly more humorous setting after the war. In \\u201cA Grand, Grand Overture,\\u201d four gunners were cast as the nemeses of the piece\\u2019s star soloists: three vacuum cleaners and a floor polisher. This and other tongue-in-cheek works were written for the cartoonist Gerard Hoffnung\\u2019s Hoffnung Festivals, musical celebrations of the bizarre and satirical. The two decades following the war were a boom time for Arnold, who worked, traveled and drank more than ever. Reams of music followed, regardless of his personal ups and downs.\", \"His music is characterized by a kind of selflessness, a high-spirited generosity, whether he was writing celebratory music for a local brass band, a lush accompaniment for a film or pieces for his mates in the orchestra. Time spent in Cornwall following the end of his first marriage, in the early 1960s, cemented his belief in a composer\\u2019s duty to his community, and one of his proudest achievements was being made Bard of the Cornish Gorsedh in 1968.\", \"\\u201cMusic is the social act of communication, a gesture of friendship,\\u201d he said.\", \"The other side of Arnold\\u2019s high spirits was never far away, though, and his life unraveled after a career peak in the 1960s. He was a notorious drinker. And in the first of a series of disturbing episodes, he went after his first wife, Sheila Nicholson, with a knife. She managed to call the police, and so began regular periods for Arnold in and out of mental hospitals. There were numerous infidelities, and the breakdown of that first marriage and then another; by the 1970s, he had tried to commit suicide twice. Arnold checked himself into a hospital on the verge of collapse, and was under the care of the Court of Protection from 1979 to 1986.\", \"It was only because of the unwavering (and unrequited) support of his children, former lovers, friends of friends and caregivers such as Anthony Day, that he was not only brought back from the brink of mental breakdown, but eventually returned to writing music. He retired from composing in 1990 and died in Norwich, having outlived the most generous predictions.\", \"Arnold\\u2019s music isn\\u2019t out of favor everywhere. His compositions for amateur and youth ensembles appear with deserved regularity. Pieces like the dance sets (Cornish, Scottish, English); the Little Suites for Orchestra; and the Fantasy for Brass Band blend lush orchestrations with lilting themes, balancing accessibility with challenge while never pandering to nonprofessional players. Conservatory students in trombone, recorder, guitar and tuba, lacking a rich standard repertoire, are also blessed with a collection of works by Arnold that include smaller fantasies, concertos (written for performers as varied as Benny Goodman, Julian Bream and Larry Adler) and other occasional works for instruments he felt deserved their moment in the sun.\", \"His orchestrations gleam, and one place his writing will always be welcome is among orchestral musicians. For the professionals, Arnold\\u2019s music carries the feeling that he was on their side. (He was a frequent presence on the podium, particularly leading events like his Concerto for Group and Orchestra, for the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and the rock band Deep Purple, a crossover milestone.) Before focusing on composition, he was a first-rate trumpeter, eventually gaining the principal chair in the London Philharmonic, and he knew exactly what worked and what didn\\u2019t from inside the orchestral organism.\", \"His ability to traverse the sublime and ridiculous is captured on a recent recording by the Liepaja Symphony Orchestra of Latvia, led by John Gibbons, which pairs Arnold\\u2019s austere Ninth Symphony with a bizarre Hoffnung piece, the \\u201cGrand Concerto Gastronomique\\u201d for eater, waiter, food and orchestra.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s a quality in how Arnold\\u2019s music reaches audiences,\\u201d Gibbons said in an interview. \\u201cEven in the Ninth Symphony, which explores a huge range of human emotions, it\\u2019s bare enough to fully understand on a first listen.\\u201d\", \"The \\u201cGastronomique\\u201d is an illuminating snapshot of Arnold the satirist. (The movement called \\u201cRoast Beef,\\u201d winking at Elgarian nobility, is particularly delicious.) But it\\u2019s the Ninth, completed in 1986 and Arnold\\u2019s last major compositional statement, that Gibbons wants to re-evaluate.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not all about grief,\\u201d he said \\u2014 and, indeed, Gibbons\\u2019s sprightly tempos have caused consternation in some circles. \\u201cSymphonists after Mahler are expected to end in grief and existential angst, but this is more like the serene floating of a composer reflecting on life from his old age.\\u201d\", \"The Ninth\\u2019s D Major conclusion is unexpectedly sunny, but is it the satisfying arrival we might hope for? The short answer is no \\u2014 it\\u2019s a merely partial resolution, an apt quasi-ending to Arnold\\u2019s story, which continues to rumble on bumpily, well into death.\"]","href_hash":"f9228a3b4ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f9228a3b4ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}},
