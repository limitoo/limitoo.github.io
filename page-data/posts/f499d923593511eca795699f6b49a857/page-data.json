Psaki made it clear on Thursday that the United States expects Russia to respect Ukraine's border and Biden is hoping to resolve the tension with diplomacy,\", \"That diplomacy doesn't include pressuring Ukraine to cede territory to Russian-backed groups, according to Psaki. When asked about reports the United States is pressuring Ukraine to give up land to Russia as a means of deterring an invasion, Psaki said that is not true, calling it \\\"absolutely false.\\\"\", \"On Thursday, the Associated Press reported administration officials suggested the United States will press Ukraine to formally cede some autonomy of its eastern territory that's being controlled by Russian-backed separatists.\", \"Psaki said the White House plans to continue its pressure on Russia to ease up on Ukraine, making it clear that there would be significant financial repercussions if they step out of line.
