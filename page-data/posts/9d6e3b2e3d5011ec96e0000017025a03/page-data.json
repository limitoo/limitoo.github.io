Isn\\u2019t that awful?\\u201d\", \"What books are on your night stand?\", \"I\\u2019m rereading the Everyman\\u2019s Library edition of Thomas Mann\\u2019s \\u201cThe Magic Mountain\\u201d in the magnificent translation by John E. Woods. Also \\u201cThe Empress of Ireland,\\u201d an inexplicably neglected memoir by Christopher Robbins of the inexplicably forgotten Irish film director Brian Desmond Hurst, first published in 2004. The book is extremely engaging, sad and funny, and a sort of masterpiece in its way. Get it in the wonderful and wonderfully named Slightly Foxed Editions edition, if you can.\", \"What\\u2019s the last great book you read?\", \"See above.\", \"Are there any classic novels that you only recently read for the first time?\", \"I\\u2019m considering having another go at \\u201cMiddlemarch,\\u201d which I have never managed to finish. I find George Eliot\\u2019s didactic tone and suffocating authorial presence pretty well unbearable. Go ahead, Elioteers, shout abuse at me, I don\\u2019t care. And I\\u2018m reading the \\u201cAnnals\\u201d of Tacitus. Honestly, I am.\", \"Can a great book be badly written? What other criteria can overcome bad prose?\", \"Oh, yes indeed. Though I can only read him in translation, I think Dostoyevsky is an extraordinarily clumsy and slipshod writer. Nabokov thought so too, which is good enough for me.\", \"Describe your ideal reading experience (when, where, what, how).\", \"A butler at some grand house was asked by the novelist Henry Green for his definition of happiness, and the butler said something to the effect of, Sitting up in bed of a Sunday morning, listening to distant church bells and eating hot buttered toast with fingers that smell of sex. Add a book, and there you have it \\u2014 though there\\u2019s the worry of that hot butter getting on the pages. Still, a risk worth taking.\", \"What\\u2019s your favorite book no one else has heard of?\", \"Well, I can\\u2019t think of a book that no one has heard of. If you mean a neglected classic, I\\u2019d say \\u201cHerself Surprised,\\u201d by Joyce Cary. It\\u2019s part of the trilogy that includes the better-known \\u201cThe Horse\\u2019s Mouth,\\u201d but it\\u2019s every bit as good.\", \"Which writers \\u2014 novelists, playwrights, critics, journalists, poets \\u2014 working today do you admire most?\", \"How much trouble do you want to get me into?\", \"Until last year, you used the pseudonym Benjamin Black when you wrote crime novels, and reserved your real name for quote-unquote literary books. Did your reading life change as well when you were writing as Black?\", \"No, no. When I wrote my first crime novel, \\u201cChristine Falls\\u201d \\u2014 first, if you don\\u2019t count \\u201cThe Book of Evidence\\u201d \\u2014 I used a pen-name just to let readers know I wasn\\u2019t playing an elaborate postmodernist joke. Lately I had to check back on some of the BB books in order to write a sequel to one of them, and since I can\\u2019t bear to read my own work I hit on the idea of listening to them in audio form. Timothy Dalton reads a couple of the early ones superbly, and since the voice was his more than mine, I was able to judge them with some objectivity. So much so that I thought, why the pseudonym? So I killed off my dark brother. As to reading others, I\\u2019ve always been a keen admirer of the classic crime writers, Chandler, Margery Allingham, Richard Stark, etc. And above all, of course, Simenon. I read him all the time, and he never palls.\", \"Do you count any books as guilty pleasures?\", \"I wouldn\\u2019t feel guilty even if I were only reading the back of a cornflakes box. The act of reading is extraordinary \\u2014 whole worlds created out of black squiggles on a white ground \\u2014 and I\\u2019ll read anything if it\\u2019s well written. Lately I revisited \\u201cTreasure Island\\u201d and was as thrilled and charmed as when I first read it as a boy. Stevenson is one of the great, unobtrusive stylists.\", \"What\\u2019s the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently?\", \"The existence of the \\u201cWood-Wide Web,\\u201d that I heard of first in Peter Wohlleben\\u2019s \\u201cThe Hidden Life of Trees.\\u201d A truly marvelous book, literally so, for it\\u2019s full of wonder, and wonders.\", \"What moves you most in a work of literature?\", \"The style.\", \"Which books got you hooked on crime fiction?\", \"Raymond Chandler\\u2019s \\u201cThe Long Goodbye,\\u201d Richard Stark\\u2019s \\u201cThe Outfit,\\u201d Simenon\\u2019s \\u201cDirty Snow.\\u201d And dozens of others.\", \"What makes for a good mystery?\", \"I would give as answer what William Goldman said of the movies \\u2014 No one knows anything.\", \"Do you distinguish between \\u201ccommercial\\u201d and \\u201cliterary\\u201d fiction? Where\\u2019s that line, for you?\", \"Again, if the thing is well and honestly written then it\\u2019s good, as far as I\\u2019m concerned. There\\u2019s a wonderful little marginal admonition to himself in one of Charles Darwin\\u2019s notebooks: Never say higher or lower.\", \"How do you organize your books?\", \"I don\\u2019t. They have a life of their own, so I never know where anything is.\", \"What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?\", \"I can\\u2019t think of any, given what I said above about the cornflakes box.\", \"What\\u2019s the best book you\\u2019ve ever received as a gift?\", \"\\u201cDubliners,\\u201d by James Joyce. I was, I think, 12, when I was given it for my birthday.\", \"What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?\", \"Avid. I used to cry when I came to the end of one of the Just William books, by Richmal Crompton. Also a little pamphlet called \\u201cMaggie\\u2019s Rosary,\\u201d by I can\\u2019t remember whom. I think it was the first extended text I read, at the age of 7 or 8, and it too made me cry.\", \"How have your reading tastes changed over time?\", \"I read very little new fiction these days, to my shame and regret. Somehow, now that I\\u2019m old, I don\\u2019t seem to need whatever it is fiction offers. So much of it seems to me mere prattle. Isn\\u2019t that awful?\", \"You\\u2019re organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?\", \"William James, Denis Diderot, Elizabeth Bowen.\", \"What do you plan to read next?\", \"Mann\\u2019s \\u201cBuddenbrooks\\u201d \\u2014 I\\u2019m on a binge \\u2014 in, of course, the Everyman edition.\"]","href_hash":"9d6e3b2e3d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9d6e3b2e3d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}},
