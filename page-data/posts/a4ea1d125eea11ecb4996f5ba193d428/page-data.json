Having the programme rolled out in schools particularly lower decile schools I think is an excellent way to address some of the access issues we saw in the adult programme,\\\" Sinclair said.\", \"\\\"We're advocating for that, I don't think New Zealand has a good track record or any track record to achieving equity for M\\u0101ori.\\\"\", \"The key part of the puzzle was that to achieve equity one side needed to get more and the other side needed to get less, he said.\", \"\\\"The risk of a school based programme is that it's a general one and if that happens, all the very wealthy schools that are non-M\\u0101ori and Pacific will instantly access all of those services very quickly and will create an inequity.\\\"\", \"RNZ\"]","href_hash":"a4ea1d125eea11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a4ea1d125eea11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
