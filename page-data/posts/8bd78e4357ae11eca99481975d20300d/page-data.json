He said outages similar to Tuesday's in recent months and years show how the internet industry has changed.\", \"\\\"More and more these outages end up being the product of automation and centralization of administration,\\\" he said. \\\"This ends up leading to outages that are hard to completely avoid due to operational complexity but are very impactful when they happen.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947140/amazon-web-services-outage.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Amazon Web Services experienced significant outages Tuesday, affecting many users' ability to reach websites like Netflix, Delta Airlines and many more, and disrupting Amazon's smart home and speaker devices.</div>\", \"The company provides cloud computing services to many governments, universities and companies, including AP.\", \"The outage also affected Amazon's ability to provide status updates, it said.\", \"\\\"AWS is the biggest cloud provider and us-east-1 is their biggest data center, so any disruption there has big impacts to many popular websites and other internet services,\\\" Madory said.\", \"Kentik was seeing a 26 percent drop in traffic to Netflix, among major web-based services affected by the outage, Madory said.\", \"Customers trying to book or change trips with Delta Air Lines were having trouble connecting to the airline.\", \"\\\"Delta is working quickly to restore functionality to our AWS-supported phone lines,\\\" spokesperson Morgan Durrant said.\", \"The airline apologized and encouraged customers to use its website or mobile app instead.\", \"According to DownDetector, Southwest was also affected, but not American, United, Alaska or JetBlue.
