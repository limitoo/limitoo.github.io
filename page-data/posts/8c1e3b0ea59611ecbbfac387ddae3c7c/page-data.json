Among the many accolades his heroics garnered him, town planners of a massive state housing development project in M\\u0101ngere decided to name one of its main arterial roads after him - Bader Drive.\", \"The development, which began in the 1960s, would soon become home to the majority of Auckland's Pacific population. And thanks to the sterling work of the Polynesian Panthers, the stories of how families were moved and in many cases pushed out of suburbs like Ponsonby and Grey Lynn into M\\u0101ngere and \\u014ctara is now well-known.\", \"Fast forward to today, and the government is undertaking an equally ambitious plan to replace the suburb's existing 2700 state houses with 10,000 new homes which will be a mix of state and open market properties.\", \"The first stage of this development is well under way and Bader Drive is currently the focus of this work. In 2020, four large multi-level apartment buildings made up predominantly of two-bedroom homes were opened to replace a collection of ramshackle dwellings that were well past their shelf life.\", \"For someone who has lived on Bader Drive, and would often push my young daughters to sleep on long walks up and down this road, it was clear these ageing state houses were well overdue for a revamp. On rainy days the inadequate underground drainage meant the footpaths were a slippery mess and the moss and mould on these flimsy weatherboard bungalows was starkly clear.\", \"But despite the promise this splurge of new housing offers, many harbour fears we may see history repeated as Pacific families are pushed further south to make way for higher-earning newcomers.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/211080/three_col_LDR-HORIZONTAL-FINAL-colour.jpg?1570666591\\\" alt=\\\"no metadata\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"Monte Cecilia Housing Trust is the main community housing provider in the area.

Sykes says research shows at least 60 percent of people will face some kind of disability issue over their lifetime, whereas only 15 percent of the new homes have disability access in mind. Sykes says the government needs to get the balance right in providing more affordable housing while ensuring these homes match the needs of the community.\", \"\\\"When they started building all these one- and two-bedroom apartment blocks, we began to challenge them on that, and the big issue for us is that there are a whole bunch of people who need more flexible housing options, but aren't necessarily on the government's radar because they are not on the social housing register.\\\"\", \"M\\u0101ngere's local MP and Pacific peoples minister Aupito William Sio, who helped set up the community reference group, is another who has been impressing on K\\u0101inga Ora's staff the need for housing to not only accommodate larger families but also enable cultural practices, such as having a garage or lounge for prayer or funeral services.\", \"\\\"I worry about how we maintain our cultural uniqueness [when the housing is much smaller], and some of the early housing, while it was necessary, its design was more for singles and couples, not for families with children.\", \"\\\"I know the officials have good intentions and are trying to follow a certain policy direction, however if they're not from this area, they have no idea how an elderly mum or dad will require sons, daughters, nieces and nephews to live with them.\\\"\", \"Sio says home ownership rates among Pacific peoples were as high as 40 percent in the 1970s, but dropped down to 16 percent just prior to his government coming to power. He says it is now up to 21 percent and his ministry has secured a further $40 million \\\"to deliberately target\\\" home ownership rates through financial literacy education and establishing more Pacific community housing providers.\", \"\\\"My ministry is still working through the process of ensuring we can staircase Pacific peoples that have got a bit of a deposit to get that extra support.\\\"\", \"Sykes says partnering with more community housing providers could be another way to improve the outcomes for the development.\", \"\\\"It seems K\\u0101inga Ora and the developers are under so much pressure to build more and more houses, and so connecting the dots with education, health and the community services has been very piecemeal at best.\", \"\\\"There is a need for improved overall planning for the M\\u0101ngere community so that the impact of increased housing is also matched by improved facilities.\", \"\\\"And an advantage the community housing sector has is that when it's well-resourced, it knows our people better and it's able to connect people to more wraparound support and services than the government can do.\\\"\", \"In a written statement, K\\u0101inga Ora's project director for M\\u0101ngere, James D'Anvers, acknowledged the need to provide a range of purchasing options for local families.\", \"\\\"As we're only in the early stages of this development, we're continuing to investigate alternative housing options - such as progressive home ownership, shared equity and rent-to-buy - with our development partners to provide greater opportunities for local wh\\u0101nau to transition into homeowners.\\\"\", \"This includes signing an agreement with the New Zealand Housing Foundation (NZHF) to deliver 67 new homes, of which 70 percent will be available through shared equity and rent-to-buy schemes, and 30 percent will only be sold to M\\u0101ori wh\\u0101nau. There will also be six homes provided by Habitat for Humanity (HFH) and Mike Greer Homes under HFH's progressive ownership scheme. K\\u0101inga Ora also has a new shared home ownership scheme - called First Home Partner - to help first home buyers whose deposit and home loan aren't enough to buy a home.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/140144/eight_col_Housing4.jpg?1647472681\\\" alt=\\\"The new three-story apartment buildings, and right, the older state housing that is to be replaced by K\\u0101inga Ora over the next 10-15 years.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nThe new three-story apartment buildings, and right, the older state housing that is to be replaced by K\\u0101inga Ora over the next 10-15 years. \\nPhoto: LDR / Justin Latif\\n</div>\", \"Regarding the building of larger homes, D'Anvers said that within the three neighbourhoods being built in M\\u0101ngere, between 35 percent - 60 percent of planned or under-construction homes will have three to five bedrooms.\", \"\\\"We're still in the process of master planning the remaining neighbourhoods and will take into account the needs of existing and future customers.

In the past two years, over 100 homes with three to six bedrooms have been built in the M\\u0101ngere-\\u014ct\\u0101huhu area as public housing.\\\"\", \"A K\\u0101inga Ora spokesperson also pointed out that the percentage of accessible housing is inline with its national policy.\", \"But as M\\u0101ngere's local MP Aupito William Sio puts it, a sign of whether this development is a success or not, will be whether it splits up families or makes them stronger.\", \"\\\"At the end of the day, we're not a community of individuals, we're a community of families, and families like to stay together.\\\"\", \"Local Democracy Reporting is Public Interest Journalism funded through NZ On Air\"]","href_hash":"8c1e3b0ea59611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8c1e3b0ea59611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
