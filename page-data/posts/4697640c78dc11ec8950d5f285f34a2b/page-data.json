Just reading the first official statement as well as seeing the graphic images. Tonga hasn't yet fully recovered from some of the cyclones. On top of a pandemic, there is now this twin force of natural disaster,\\\" Salesa said.\", \"She had been in touch with many Tongans in Aotearoa since the latest news arrived.\", \"\\\"There is actually a sense of relief that there doesn't seem to be many more deaths reported. We know as of now, three fatalities have been reported to date. We of course still don't know the extent of the damages on the ground.
