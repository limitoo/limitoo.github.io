Mr. Costa, 36, gained attention for his Congressional coverage at the right-leaning National Review magazine before joining The Post in 2014.\", \"He is also the second well-known correspondent to exit The Post in recent days. David Fahrenthold, a 21-year veteran of the paper and a Pulitzer Prize winner for his investigations into the Trump family\\u2019s charitable donations, joined The New York Times earlier this month.\", \"Mr. Costa, who co-wrote the book \\u201cPeril\\u201d with Bob Woodward last year, has plenty of experience in television news. He served as the moderator of \\u201cWashington Week\\u201d on PBS from 2017 to 2020, and was a regular presence on MSNBC and NBC News programs from 2015 to 2020, where he was a political analyst.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve worked across platforms for much of my career, and I believe it\\u2019s a vital time for me to grow as a storyteller, and to build my muscle as a reporter on the television front,\\u201d Mr. Costa said in an interview. \\u201cThat excites me as a new challenge.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Costa is a major hire by Neeraj Khemlani, the executive who took charge of CBS News last spring. Mr. Khemlani was an unexpected pick for the role who came to CBS from Hearst, a company best known as a magazine publisher. He has been focused on reimagining a storied news division \\u2014 the former home of Edward R. Murrow \\u2014 that has struggled in recent years to compete against ABC and NBC.\", \"In the interview, Mr. Costa said he and Mr. Khemlani began discussing a possible role at the network in November. \\u201cIt started as casual conversations about the future of American democracy and how important the coming years will be,\\u201d Mr. Costa said. He said the two men \\u201cbuilt a bond.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Costa said his arrangement with CBS will allow him to continue collaborating on some reporting projects with The Post.\", \"\\u201cI am lucky to call Sally Buzbee and Fred Ryan friends,\\u201d Mr. Costa said, referring to the newspaper\\u2019s executive editor and publisher. \\u201cThese are people I\\u2019ve worked closely with, and I appreciate their support for this decision.\\u201d\", \"CBS News has filled several big roles this year. Mark X. Lima, formerly the network\\u2019s West Coast bureau chief, is now the Washington bureau chief. Anthony Galloway, the chief content officer at The Wall Street Journal, is joining CBS to oversee its streaming news programming.\", \"There are no plans for Mr. Costa to host his own show. He is expected to appear on news programs across CBS\\u2019s broadcast and streaming platforms and play a major role in the network\\u2019s coverage of the 2022 midterms and 2024 presidential race.\", \"Mr. Costa, who grew up in Pennsylvania, interned with the famed TV anchors George Stephanopoulos and Charlie Rose early in his career. He made a name for himself on the national stage with a string of scoops about the 2013 Republican-led shutdown of the federal government, earning a profile in New York magazine that declared him \\u201cthe golden boy of the government shutdown.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"173bc49c79f811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"173bc49c79f811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
