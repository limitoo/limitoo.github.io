But the secretary conceded the U.S. is currently on \\\"heightened alert by reason of the geopolitical landscape.\\\"\", \"\\\"When the specter of harm arises, we call for vigilance. And quite frankly, in the cybersecurity arena, ever-present vigilance is what we call for,\\\" Mayorkas added.\", \"DHS indicated in its assessment that \\\"Russia's threshold for conducting disruptive or destructive cyber attacks in the Homeland probably remains very high.\\\" Officials \\\"have not observed Moscow directly employ these types of cyber attacks against US critical infrastructure\\u2014notwithstanding cyber espionage and potential prepositioning operations in the past.\\\"\", \"In 2021, Russian-linked cyber gangs launched two devastating cyberattacks on the United States.

Weeks later, an attack on JBS\\u00a0\\u2014 the world's largest meat processing company \\u2013 forced the company to halt cattle-slaughtering operations at 13 of its plants.\", \"The U.S. has also blamed the Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) for the 2020 SolarWinds breach.
