No other details were immediately provided.\", \"Mr. Poitier, whose Academy Award for the 1963 film \\u201cLilies of the Field\\u201d made him the first Black performer to win in the best-actor category, rose to prominence when the civil rights movement was beginning to make headway in the United States. His roles tended to reflect the peaceful integrationist goals of the struggle. Although often simmering with repressed anger, his characters responded to injustice with quiet resolution. They met hatred with reason and forgiveness, sending a reassuring message to white audiences and exposing Mr. Poitier to attack as an Uncle Tom when the civil rights movement took a more militant turn in the late 1960s.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a choice, a clear choice,\\u201d Mr. Poitier said of his film parts in a 1967 interview. \\u201cIf the fabric of the society were different, I would scream to high heaven to play villains and to deal with different images of Negro life that would be more dimensional. But I\\u2019ll be damned if I do that at this stage of the game.\\u201d\", \"At the time, Mr. Poitier was one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood and a top box-office draw, ranked fifth among male actors in Box Office magazine\\u2019s poll of theater owners and critics, behind Richard Burton, Paul Newman, Lee Marvin and John Wayne. Yet for years racial squeamishness would not allow Hollywood to cast him as a romantic lead, despite his good looks, until he appeared in the groundbreaking \\u201cGuess Who\\u2019s Coming to Dinner\\u201d (1967), about an interracial romance. \", \"\\u201cTo think of the American Negro male in romantic social-sexual circumstances is difficult, you know,\\u201d he told an interviewer. \\u201cAnd the reasons why are legion and too many to go into.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Poitier often found himself in limiting, saintly roles that nevertheless represented an important advance on the demeaning parts offered by Hollywood in the past. In \\u201cNo Way Out\\u201d (1950), his first substantial film role, he played a doctor persecuted by a racist patient, and in \\u201cCry, the Beloved Country\\u201d (1952), based on the Alan Paton novel about racism in South Africa, he appeared as a young priest. His character in \\u201cBlackboard Jungle\\u201d (1955), a troubled student at a tough New York City public school, sees the light and eventually sides with Glenn Ford, the teacher who tries to reach him. \", \"In \\u201cThe Defiant Ones\\u201d (1958), a racial fable that established him as a star and earned him an Academy Award nomination for best actor, he was a prisoner on the run, handcuffed to a fellow convict (and virulent racist) played by Tony Curtis. The best-actor award came in 1964 for his performance in the low-budget \\u201cLilies of the Field,\\u201d as an itinerant handyman helping a group of German nuns build a church in the Southwestern desert. \", \"In 1967 Mr. Poitier appeared in three of Hollywood\\u2019s top-grossing films, elevating him to the peak of his popularity. \\u201cIn the Heat of Night\\u201d placed him opposite Rod Steiger, as an indolent, bigoted sheriff, with whom Virgil Tibbs, the Philadelphia detective played by Mr. Poitier, must work on a murder investigation in Mississippi. (In an indelible line, the detective insists on the sheriff\\u2019s respect when he declares, \\u201cThey call me Mr. Tibbs!\\u201d) In \\u201cTo Sir, With Love\\u201d he was a concerned teacher in a tough London high school , and in \\u201cGuess Who\\u2019s Coming to Dinner\\u201d he played a doctor whose race tests the liberal principles of his prospective in-laws, played by Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. \", \"Throughout his career, a heavy weight of racial significance bore down on Mr. Poitier and the characters he played. \\u201cI felt very much as if I were representing 15, 18 million people with every move I made,\\u201d he once wrote.\", \"A full obituary will appear soon.\"]","href_hash":"ef53a7546fd111eca1bf5540a99d1fb5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ef53a7546fd111eca1bf5540a99d1fb5"}},
