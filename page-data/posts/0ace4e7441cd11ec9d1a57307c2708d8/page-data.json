Mr. McAuliffe accused the Republican, Glenn Youngkin, of campaigning on a \\u201cmade-up\\u201d issue and of blowing a \\u201cracist dog whistle.\\u201d\", \"But about a quarter of Virginia voters said that the debate over teaching critical race theory, a graduate-level academic framework that has become a stand-in for a debate over what to teach about race and racism in schools, was the most important factor in their decision, and 72 percent of those voters cast ballots for Mr. Youngkin, according to a survey of more than 2,500 voters conducted for The Associated Press by NORC at the University of Chicago, a nonpartisan research organization.\", \"The nuances of critical race theory, which focuses on the ways that institutions perpetuate racism, and the hyperbolic tone of the coverage of the issue in conservative news media point to why Democrats have struggled to come up with an effective response.\", \" Mr. Teixeira calls the Democrats\\u2019 problem with critical race theory and other galvanizing issues the \\u201cFox News Fallacy.\\u201d\", \"These issues are ripe for distortions and exaggeration by Republican politicians and their allies in the news media. But Mr. Teixeira says Democrats should not dismiss voters\\u2019 concerns as simply right-wing misinformation.\", \"\\u201cAn issue is not necessarily completely invalid just because Fox News mentions it,\\u201d he said.\", \"In an interview, Mr. Teixeira said his logic applied to questions far beyond critical race theory. \\u201cI can\\u2019t tell you how many times I analyze a particular issue, saying this is a real concern,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd the first thing I hear is, \\u2018Hey, this is a right-wing talking point. You\\u2019re playing into the hands of the enemy.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Fox News is not the only institution capable of producing this kind of reaction from some on the left \\u2014 it was just the one Mr. Teixeira chose to make his point as vividly as possible.\", \"The conservative news media is full of stories that can make it sound as if the country is living through a nightmare. Rising prices and supply chain difficulties are cast as economic threats on par with the \\u201cstagflation\\u201d crisis of the 1970s, a comparison that is oversimplified because neither inflation nor unemployment is as high now. Stories of violent crime in large cities are given prominent placement and frequent airing; the same is true of coverage about the record number of migrants being apprehended at the southern border.\", \"The Biden administration has struggled to address concerns about all of these issues. Critics pounced when the White House chief of staff, Ron Klain, posted a tweet that cast inflation and supply chain disruptions as \\u201chigh class problems,\\u201d seeming to dismiss the anxiety that Americans say they have about their own finances.\", \"And despite border crossings hitting the highest number on record since at least 1960, when the government began tracking them, the Biden administration has resisted referring to the issue as a \\u201ccrisis.\\u201d President Biden has faced persistent questions about why he has not visited the border.\", \"Then there\\u2019s crime. After a year and a half of calls from the progressive left for drastic policing reform, voters across the country last week rejected candidates and policies aligned with the \\u201cdefund the police\\u201d movement. In two of the most striking examples, Minneapolis voters said no to a referendum to dismantle their city\\u2019s troubled police department. And New Yorkers elected as mayor a former police captain, Eric Adams, who strongly opposes \\u201cdefund\\u201d efforts.\", \"One liberal who apparently recognized the broader problems that Democrats have had explaining their platforms to voters was Maya Wiley, who ran against Mr. Adams in the mayoral primary as a proponent of sweeping police reforms. In an opinion essay for The New Republic this week, Ms. Wiley, a civil rights lawyer, wrote that while Republicans distorted the debate over critical race theory in Virginia, they also offered a more compelling message on education.\", \"\\u201cIf you only heard evening news sound bites, you would think all he talked about on the campaign trail was critical race theory,\\u201d Ms. Wiley said of Mr. Youngkin. \\u201cNot so. In fact, he sounded like a moderate Democrat, with the notable exception of C.R.T.\\u201d\", \"Despite the dog whistling, Wiley said, the message was effective because it was empathetic. \\u201cHe was saying he understood their pain,\\u201d she said.\"]","href_hash":"0ace4e7441cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0ace4e7441cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
