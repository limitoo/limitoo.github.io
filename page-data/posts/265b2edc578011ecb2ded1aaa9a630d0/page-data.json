So, when they asked Katie for clarification as to why guests needed to contribute to the wedding fund, Katie got mad and \\\"called [the Redditor] an a** for embarrassing her in front of everyone.\\\"\", \"Later that day, Katie's fianc\\u00e9 called the Redditor to rescind their wedding invite.\", \"The Knot reported that the average U.S. wedding cost about $28,000 in 2019 and $19,000 in 2020.\", \"While the bride's family is traditionally expected to cover a majority of the wedding costs, experts have said that it's become commonplace for both families to contribute to the wedding.\", \"\\\"In this day and age, there is no single answer to who is paying for a couple's wedding,\\\" Bryan Rafanelli, founder and chief creative officer of Rafanelli Events, told Harper's Bazaar.\", \"\\\"Be collaborative.

They also suggested that couples use candles \\\"in place of flowers,\\\" and book the photographer for \\\"8-10 hours instead of a full day,\\\" among other cost-saving tips.\", \"Many commenters felt that Katie was wrong to ask her guests to contribute to the wedding considering the number of financial options available to couples struggling to pay for their ceremony, including but not limited to leaning on family members for help or cutting costs altogether.\", \"\\\"NTA [not the a**hole].
