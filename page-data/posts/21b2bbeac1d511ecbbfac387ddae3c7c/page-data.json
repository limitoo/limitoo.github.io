The fact of the matter is they spend 24/7 with their child because we no longer have a system that provides regular respite, or a system that provides regular day programmes for people.\", \"\\\"If the Crown's not the employer then they need to start providing families with meaningful alternatives.\\\"\", \"She had no doubt the cases would drag on, costing families and the ministry even more money.\", \"\\\"Look, this money is only the tip of the iceberg in terms of what the Crown has spent fighting carer cases, they have spent millions since 2008 when the first issues were raised in the new Human Rights Review Tribunal.\", \"\\\"They lost everything that has ever been taken [before the courts]... and the Crown continues to ignore the [court] decisions.\\\"\", \"The Ministry of Health said it could not respond to questions while the matters were before the courts.\"]","href_hash":"21b2bbeac1d511ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"21b2bbeac1d511ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
