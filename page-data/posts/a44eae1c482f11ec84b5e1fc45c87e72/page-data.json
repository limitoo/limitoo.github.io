But with injuries mounting and weaknesses now revealed, divisional races could get weird.\", \"The Panthers, who added quarterback Cam Newton and returned running back Christian McCaffery from injury, could pounce on the N.F.C. South while the Buccaneers and Saints play games without key starters. The 49ers, after a statement win Monday night, have a soft stretch in their schedule. With a win likely over the Jaguars this week, San Francisco could make up some ground on securing a wild-card spot out of the N.F.C. West while the Rams are on a bye.\", \"As the intrigue in the N.F.C. heightens, the A.F.C.\\u2019s tightest races could get new leaders. The Patriots have a shot at closing the half-game gap with the Bills in the East, and the Steelers (5-3-1) have inched to within a fraction of the Ravens (6-3) in the North \\u2014 a space it will try to close in a matchup against the Chargers.\", \"Below is a look at N.F.L. Week 11, with all picks made against the spread.\", \"All times are Eastern.\", \"Byes: Broncos, Rams\", \"Last week\\u2019s record: 4-10\", \"New England Patriots at Atlanta Falcons, 8:20 p.m., Fox and NFL Network\", \"Line: Patriots -6 | Total: 46.5\", \"The rookie quarterback Mac Jones is coming off completing an astounding 82.6 percent of his passes, including three touchdown throws, against the Browns last week. New England (6-4) has now won four consecutive games and is within striking distance of the A.F.C. East lead. Jones and the Patriots\\u2019 offense should make easy work of the Falcons (4-5), whose defense has allowed over 30 points in four games.\", \"Pick: Patriots -6\", \"Dallas Cowboys at Kansas City, 4:25 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Kansas City -2.5 | Total: 55.5\", \"Yes, Kansas City (6-4) looked good defensively on Sunday but it played the Raiders, whose offense is foundering after the team released its best receiver. Now, Kansas City will try to stop the Cowboys (7-2), who feature arguably the best receiving corps in the league and average 294.3 passing yards per game.\", \"Dallas\\u2019s defense has been vulnerable to volume passers like Patrick Mahomes \\u2014 who has the second-most interceptions in the league, but is coming off a five-touchdown, zero-interception performance in which he had 50 attempts. But Dak Prescott can keep pace, and Dallas is good enough against the run to prevent Kansas City from controlling time of possession. Pick: Cowboys +2.5\", \"Green Bay Packers at Minnesota Vikings, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Packers -2.5 | Total: 49\", \"Given another week to recover from the coronavirus, Aaron Rodgers should return to form as the Packers (8-2) face the Vikings (4-5). But he\\u2019ll be without running back Aaron Jones, who is dealing with a sprained knee.\", \"All but one of Minnesota\\u2019s games this season have been decided by one score, and if the spread was a little larger, it would be tempting to bet on them to cover. But after the Packers\\u2019 sloppy performance against Seattle, Rodgers will be eager to remind the league that Green Bay can score a lot. Pick: Packers -2.5\", \"Arizona Cardinals at Seattle Seahawks, 4:25 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Cardinals -2.5 | Total: 49\", \"Injuries are the only reason for the tight spread between the N.F.C. West\\u2019s best and worst teams. The Cardinals (8-2) have played their last two games without quarterback Kyler Murray (ankle sprain), but Coach Kliff Kingsbury said \\u201cit\\u2019s going to be close\\u201d when asked if Murray will play Sunday. It\\u2019s also unclear whether receiver DeAndre Hopkins (hamstring) will be available, and Murray\\u2019s backup, Colt McCoy, is also questionable (pectoral).\", \"The Seahawks (3-6), meanwhile, just had the worst offensive outing in Russell Wilson\\u2019s career, and are uncertain of the status of starting running back Chris Carson (neck). Assuming Murray and Hopkins play, this one shouldn\\u2019t be close. Pick: Cardinals -2.5\", \"Pittsburgh Steelers at Los Angeles Chargers, 8:20 p.m., NBC\", \"Line: Chargers -6 | Total: 47\", \"Bet this one. The Chargers (5-4) have lost three of their last four games and have issues defending against the run, but the Steelers (5-3-1) could play Sunday without their three best players. Coach Mike Tomlin said he is unsure whether quarterback Ben Roethlisberger or safety Minkah Fitzpatrick will clear Covid-19 protocols, though Tomlin was more optimistic about Roethlisberger. T.J. Watt, who is second in the league in sacks (12.5), is also questionable with hip and rib injuries.\", \"Chargers defensive linemen Joey Bosa and Jerry Tillery were also placed on the Covid-19 list Tuesday and may be unable to play. But the Steelers\\u2019 potential absences are more consequential. Even with the Chargers\\u2019 inconsistency, Los Angeles should cover the spread because of Pittsburgh\\u2019s short-handedness. Pick: Chargers -6\", \"Indianapolis Colts at Buffalo Bills, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Bills -7.5 | Total: 49\", \"A win \\u2014 no matter how ugly or close \\u2014 is a win, and the Colts\\u2019 (5-5) narrowly beating the lowly Jaguars last week kept their playoff hopes realistic in the wide-open A.F.C. The Bills (6-3), though, should bring them back to reality. Buffalo\\u2019s top-ranked defense can frustrate Carson Wentz in ways the Jets and Jaguars didn\\u2019t during the Colts\\u2019 two-game winning streak, while Josh Allen relishes carving up the Colts\\u2019 secondary, ranked seventh in passing yards allowed (2,499). Pick: Bills -7.5\", \"Baltimore Ravens at Chicago Bears, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Ravens -6.5 | Total: 45.5\", \"Lamar Jackson is indeed human, and the Ravens\\u2019 (6-3) loss to Miami in Week 10 showed that Baltimore needs production from other players to have a real shot at a title. Running back Latavius Murray looks likely to play after missing three games with an ankle injury. Wondering who will step up to help Jackson will be a relevant concern in the playoffs, but maybe not this week against the Bears (3-6).\", \"Chicago\\u2019s defense is tied for fourth in sacks (25), but it has generated only nine takeaways. The rookie quarterback Justin Fields\\u2019s development has progressed after each game, but it is hard to imagine the Ravens will perform poorly in back-to-back games. Pick: Ravens -6.5\", \"Washington Footballers at Carolina Panthers, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Panthers -3.5 | Total: 43\", \"Coach Matt Rhule would not officially name Cam Newton the starter but this week\\u2019s first-team reps have gone to Carolina\\u2019s prodigal son, all but ensuring that Newton will see much more than the nine snaps he played in his first game back in a Panthers uniform. The practice should help re-establish his connection with receiver D.J. Moore and the now-healthy Christian McCaffrey, breathing new life into the Panthers\\u2019 (5-5) playoff hopes.\", \"Against a Washington (3-6) team led by the former Panthers coach Ron Rivera, Newton \\u2014 and backup P.J. Walker \\u2014 will face less of a pass rush with Chase Young out after tearing an anterior cruciate ligament. If Newton takes care of the ball, his first game back at Bank of America Stadium should be filled with Superman celebrations. Pick: Panthers -3.5\", \"Detroit Lions at Cleveland Browns, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Browns -10 | Total: 45\", \"Baker Mayfield has had an up-and-down campaign for a contract extension and is trending downward. The Browns (5-5) are last in the A.F.C. North, and he completed only 52 percent of his passes for 73 yards last week in a blowout loss against the Patriots that Mayfield left in the second half because of a knee injury.\", \"Mayfield\\u2019s status is day-to-day as he nurses that injury and an ailing shoulder, but Coach Kevin Stefanski said he expects Mayfield to play against the Lions (0-8-1), who recently played the season\\u2019s first tie. Detroit took Pittsburgh to overtime last week and looked gassed trying to finally get a win. If Mayfield is even somewhat effective, and if running back Nick Chubb clears Covid-19 protocols, Cleveland should cover at home. Pick: Browns -10\", \"Houston Texans at Tennessee Titans, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Titans -10.5 | Total: 44.5\", \"The Titans (8-2) have won both their games without their star running back Derrick Henry, but they\\u2019re still without Julio Jones (hamstring), who must miss at least two more games while on injured reserve. Ryan Tannehill, A.J. Brown and the Titans\\u2019 cast of replacement backs should face little resistance from the Texans (1-8), who are rested from a bye week but whose defense has given up the second-most rushing yards (1,232) in the league. Pick: Titans -10.5\", \"Miami Dolphins at Jets, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Dolphins -3 | Total: 45.5\", \"The Dolphins (3-7) returned their 2020 methodology of aggressively blitzing to beat Lamar Jackson last week, and it can definitely give Joe Flacco problems. Mike White threw four interceptions against the Bills, clearing up any quarterback controversy for the Jets (2-7). With Zach Wilson still recovering from a knee injury, Coach Robert Saleh elected to start Flacco, a 14-season veteran, over White. Pick: Dolphins -3\", \"New Orleans Saints at Philadelphia Eagles, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Eagles -1.5 | Total: 45\", \"After ignoring the run earlier in the season, the Eagles (4-6) have rushed for over 130 yards in each of their last four games, including two performances over 200 yards. That strategy may not work against the Saints (5-4), whose defense has given up more than 100 rushing yards only once. The Saints have been unbearably hard to predict, but even with running back Alvin Kamara\\u2019s (knee) status unclear, the defense should carry New Orleans, forcing the Eagles to revert to leaning on Jalen Hurts. Pick: Saints +1.5\", \"San Francisco 49ers at Jacksonville Jaguars, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: 49ers -7 | Total: 46\", \"Jacksonville (2-7) has played better in recent weeks, but a matchup with the 49ers (4-5) could test the Jaguars\\u2019 biggest strength: its rushing defense, which allows a mere 106 yards per game. The 49ers\\u2019 offense is predicated on misdirection and playing through contact, a challenge for a defense that\\u2019s still finding itself.\", \"Trevor Lawrence has seesawed through his rookie season so far and is tied for third in interceptions with nine. His mistakes could give San Francisco\\u2019s offense extra possessions, a less-than-sound strategy against Coach Kyle Shanahan. Pick: 49ers -7\", \"Cincinnati Bengals at Las Vegas Raiders, 4:05 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Bengals -1 | Total: 49\", \"What a difference a month makes. After Jon Gruden resigned as coach in October, the Raiders\\u2019 (5-4) efforts to remain poised and efficient have faltered in November amid more personnel shake-ups \\u2014 including the release of 2020 first-round draft picks Henry Ruggs III and Damon Arnette. Las Vegas has lost its last two games, and looked sloppy and disorganized in doing so. Kansas City last week exploited deficiencies in the Raiders\\u2019 passing defense and pointed out miscommunications in coverages, beating them with 422 passing yards.\", \"That should excite the Bengals (5-4), who hope to reawaken their passing attack. Joe Burrow threw two interceptions against the Cleveland Browns before Cincinnati\\u2019s bye, so the Bengals will be fresh and motivated to deepen the Raiders\\u2019 rut. Pick: Bengals -1\", \"Giants at Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 8:15 p.m., ESPN\", \"Line: Buccaneers -11 | Total: 50\", \"Saquon Barkley returned to practice for the Giants (3-6) after missing the last four games with an ankle injury and a positive coronavirus test. If he can play, it could be under ideal circumstances since Buccaneers tackle Vita Vea, arguably Tampa Bay\\u2019s most impactful defensive player, was carted off at the end of last Sunday\\u2019s game with a knee injury.\", \"Rob Gronkowski (back) and Antonio Brown (ankle) are also uncertain to play for the Bucs (6-3) with injuries that have hampered Tampa Bay for much of the season. Though they are the better team, the Buccaneers\\u2019 soft secondary and key absences give the Giants a chance to keep this one close. Pick: Giants +11\", \"A quick primer for those who are not familiar with betting lines: Favorites are listed next to a negative number that represents how many points they must win by to cover the spread. Raiders -5.5, for example, means that Las Vegas must beat Chicago by at least 6 points for its backers to win their bet. Gamblers can also bet on the total score, or whether the teams\\u2019 combined score in the game is over or under a preselected number of points.\"]","href_hash":"a44eae1c482f11ec84b5e1fc45c87e72"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a44eae1c482f11ec84b5e1fc45c87e72"}},
