The Oka crisis, a dispute between Canadian authorities and the Mohawk people over land rights, was reaching its height, and the frightened children crouched on the floor until Deer\\u2019s mother could drive on.\", \"\\u201cMy sense of safety was stolen from me,\\u201d Deer said. \\u201cMy sense of self-worth, as of that moment, was nonexistent.\\u201d But after spending most of her adolescence consumed by anger, she said in a video interview, \\u201cI ended up finding a way to channel that instead into my drive to prove all those people wrong.\\u201d\", \"One result is \\u201cBeans,\\u201d her first narrative feature, which was named best picture at the Canadian Screen Awards this year and has collected more than 20 prizes on the film-festival circuit. The newly released drama is a long-sought milestone for Deer, 43, a screenwriter, director, documentarian and television showrunner. (She was a creator of the comedy-drama series \\u201cMohawk Girls,\\u201d streaming on Peacock, as well as a writer for \\u201cAnne With an E\\u201d on Netflix.)\", \"A fictionalized version of her experiences, the film focuses on a bright, ambitious Mohawk girl, nicknamed Beans (portrayed by the Mohawk actress Kiawentiio). She lives with her family on the Kahnawake reserve, as Deer did, and has applied to enter seventh grade at an elite, mostly white academy that\\u2019s similar to the school Deer went to before graduating from Dartmouth.\", \"\\u201cI wanted to be the one to tell the story,\\u201d Kiawentiio (pronounced Ghee-ah-wen-DEE-o) said via video from Canada, where she was shooting the new live-action \\u201cAvatar: The Last Airbender\\u201d series for Netflix. Thirteen while filming \\u201cBeans,\\u201d she felt a personal connection to the history, having grown up in Akwesasne, a reserve not far from the conflict. \\u201cA lot of people from my community went there and were helping,\\u201d said Kiawentiio, whose own parents were teenagers at the time.\", \"Beans\\u2019 journey begins when she is caught up in the real protests that unfolded after the mayor of Oka, a town near Montreal, announced plans to expand a golf course onto land containing a sacred Mohawk burial ground. Devastated by the violence that ensues \\u2014 she is present when gunfire erupts at a confrontation between Mohawk demonstrators and the police, precipitating the 78-day crisis \\u2014 Beans falls in with a rough crowd of Mohawk teenagers. They include a charismatic boy who tries to force her to perform oral sex; the scene is based on a sexual assault Deer experienced when she was 20.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a big story,\\u201d said Anne-Marie G\\u00e9linas, founder of EMAfilms, which produced the drama. \\u201cAnd Tracey\\u2019s challenge was to talk about, of course, the bullies outside,\\u201d which in the film include the government and real-estate developers. But, G\\u00e9linas added in a video call, \\u201cshe also wanted to talk about the bullies inside her community.\\u201d\", \"Although Beans\\u2019 struggles relate specifically to her time and place, they are likely to resonate with anyone who has raised an adolescent \\u2014 or been one. When Beans practices profanity in front of her bedroom mirror, smiling proudly when she finally utters a curse, it\\u2019s impossible not to notice the doll and stuffed animals still on her bureau. And any viewer will be alarmed when a tough older girl encourages Beans to harm herself so she will be impervious to the pain inflicted by others.\", \"\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t matter if you\\u2019ve never heard of the Oka crisis,\\u201d Deer said, adding that the character is coming of age \\u201cin a tumultuous, unwelcoming world that is indicative of where we currently are.\\u201d\", \"An incident during filming reinforced that view. Deer shot \\u201cBeans\\u201d at several spots where the historical events occurred, including the Honor\\u00e9 Mercier Bridge, which Mohawk demonstrators blockaded during the crisis. It\\u2019s where the rock-throwing confrontation, recreated in the film, took place as well. When Deer began shooting in 2019, the structure was partly closed for maintenance. But some motorists, she said, assumed the movie crew had shut down the route.\", \"\\u201cThey were beeping and yelling at us and revving their engines,\\u201d said Deer, who added that the occupants of one car began shouting racial slurs. Thirty years after the Oka crisis, she said, \\u201cthe same kind of moment played out.\\u201d\", \"To show that she was not distorting the historical backdrop, Deer used archival footage throughout the film, in one case inserting an actor into the Mohawk protesters in a 1990 news clip. \\u201cNobody remembered it to be so violent, so negative, so traumatic,\\u201d G\\u00e9linas said, describing audiences\\u2019 reactions in Canada, where the response to \\u201cBeans\\u201d has been overwhelmingly positive.\", \"Although the Oka conflict ended in September 1990 with the cancellation of the golf course expansion, disputes over the land rights continue. But in the Canadian cultural sphere, the concerns of Indigenous people are gaining increased attention, said Jesse Wente, chairman of the Canada Council for the Arts and executive director of the Indigenous Screen Office in Toronto. (The organization supports Native film projects but did not contribute to the financing of \\u201cBeans.\\u201d)\", \"\\u201cI think what you\\u2019re seeing is maybe an industry that is so ravenous for stories that it\\u2019s realized it has to open the gates beyond its usual suspects,\\u201d Wente, who is Anishinaabe, said in a phone interview. He added that while Indigenous representation in the Canadian film industry had been largely confined to documentaries until recent years, artists like Deer were now delving into many genres. \\u201cWhat that means is that Indigenous cinema is about to become commercial in a way it never was,\\u201d he said.\", \"Likening Deer\\u2019s film to Spike Lee\\u2019s \\u201cDo the Right Thing,\\u201d Wente said, \\u201c\\u2018Beans\\u2019 is exactly what happens when you empower storytellers from a community who\\u2019ve had stories told about them forever, but rarely have had the opportunity to tell them themselves.\\u201d\", \"But Deer, who lives outside Montreal with her husband, stepson and a foster baby boy, often worried that \\u201cBeans\\u201d would never be made. Traumatic memories filled her with grief and anxiety as she struggled for years to write the script. In 2015, Deer finally approached G\\u00e9linas about hiring a story editor, now credited as co-screenwriter: Meredith Vuchnich.\", \"\\u201cI was a good barometer,\\u201d Vuchnich, who is not Indigenous, said by phone, explaining that Deer could use her to gauge the general public\\u2019s understanding of the crisis.\", \"\\u201cBeans\\u201d also evolved slowly because of Deer\\u2019s other projects, one of which heightened awareness of the film\\u2019s themes and introduced her to its lead actress. After reading the \\u201cBeans\\u201d screenplay, Moira Walley-Beckett, creator of \\u201cAnne With an E\\u201d \\u2014 an adaptation of the 1908 classic \\u201cAnne of Green Gables\\u201d \\u2014 hired Deer in 2018 for the series\\u2019s third season, in which the title character befriends a Mi\\u2019kmaq girl, played by Kiawentiio. The girl is forced into a residential school, one of the Canadian institutions with a long history of abuse and neglect of Indigenous pupils, a record that was further documented with the discovery of hundreds of children\\u2019s remains this year.\", \"\\u201cWe wanted to unapologetically, fearlessly tell that truthfully,\\u201d Walley-Beckett said. \\u201cAnd it was hard. And it\\u2019s a huge credit to Tracey that we were able to.\\u201d\", \"Developments in the United States, where the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements have highlighted the inequities faced by women and people of color, have also made this a propitious moment for \\u201cBeans.\\u201d The movie, Deer said, is being released at \\u201cthe most influential time that it could come out.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI realized my biggest wish back then and even today is to be seen, to be heard, to be understood,\\u201d she added. She reflected on the film\\u2019s final scene, in which the camera lingers on Beans\\u2019 face. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I hang on her for those seconds that I do,\\u201d Deer said. \\u201cSee her. See us.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"976677983fdd11ecbd6d3559cd226240"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"976677983fdd11ecbd6d3559cd226240"}},
