They offered me an induction as soon as I was ready.\\\"\", \"The induction did not lead to a quick labor, and when Jb began declining faster, doctors decided to perform a cesarean section on Parke. \\\"It was either a c-section right at that moment, or Jb would not have the opportunity to meet our son,\\\" she said.\", \"I come to you all with news that is the most joyous, but also the most somber.\\n\\nOn December 2nd, my husband Jb and I...\", \"Without questioning, the mom agreed to the C-section and 20 minutes later, their son was born. \\\"He was given to me for a quick kiss, and then a team of doctors and nurses ran him up 2 floors, and he was placed on his daddy's chest,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The miracle of all this?
