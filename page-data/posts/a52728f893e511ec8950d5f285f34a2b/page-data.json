They witnessed heavy artillery fire. \", \"Suspected Russian military vehicles were spotted in the two breakaway regions of Ukraine that President Vladimir Putin recognized as independent on Monday \\u2014 a move that has drawn fierce international condemnation and is expected to bring a round of new international sanctions against Moscow.\", \"Ukraine has accused Putin of trying to revive the Soviet Union, and the country's president is asking for more international help urgently. But as Williams reported, the war in the breakaway regions of Ukraine's eastern Donbas area has been underway since 2014.\", \"As Williams and her team travelled to the front line by truck with Ukrainian soldiers, they were ordered abruptly into a bunker \\u2014 told to get underground because a local commander had apparently deemed it too dangerous for a front line visit at that moment.\", \"When they did make it into the trenches, they found a literal quagmire: The Ukrainian forces said the snow melted early this year, leaving deep mud that they said might slow a Russian invasion down, but it wouldn't stop it.\", \" \\\"Normally it's heavy shelling, 24 hours,\\\" Private Valeri Kashkarov told CBS News.
