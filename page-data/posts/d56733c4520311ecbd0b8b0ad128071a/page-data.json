Tommy Hilfiger, who was there to receive the Outstanding Achievement Award, sat close to Kris Jenner, wrapped in a satin shawl in the red, navy and white colors of Mr. Hilfiger\\u2019s brand\\u2019s logo. \", \"The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, in a Boss suit, sat between Anna Wintour and Edward Enninful, the editor in chief of British Vogue and European editorial director of Cond\\u00e9 Nast. \\u201cOh my God, that\\u2019s John!\\u201d said the designer Henry Holland, pointing to John Galliano, on Ms. Wintour\\u2019s right. Next to Mr. Enninful was the musician Dua Lipa, in somber black.\", \"\\u201cI love Dua Lipa. She\\u2019s the best Londoner \\u2014 don\\u2019t tell Adele,\\u201d Mr. Khan said, \\u201c\\u2018Future Nostalgia\\u2019 got me through the pandemic.\\u201d He was feeling buoyant. \\u201cThis shows that London\\u2019s back,\\u201d he said, gesturing to the throng of sequins, frills and tuxedos.\", \"The jubilation has a frenetic air; the mood of a last party, a final blowout, with a fearful mania beneath the fun. A reflection both on the emergence of the Omicron coronavirus variant and the possibility of another lockdown, and on the news, received the day before the event, that the designer Virgil Abloh had died at 41. He was a lingering presence in the room, with almost every winner paying homage to him.\", \"\\u201cVirgil told me that he didn\\u2019t go a day in high school without wearing my clothes,\\u201d Tommy Hilfiger said in his speech, just after a mini catwalk show of models, who lip-synced and strutted to hits including \\u201cSatisfaction\\u201d by the Rolling Stones and Naughty by Nature\\u2019s \\u201cO.P.P.\\u201d \", \"The actor Idris Elba read Maya Angelou\\u2019s poem \\u201cWhen Great Trees Fall\\u201d in Mr. Abloh\\u2019s honor. Later, Mr. Enninful read a quotation by the designer from a manifesto given out at Mr. Abloh\\u2019s spring 2021 show for Louis Vuitton: \\u201c\\u2018As a Black man in a French luxury house, I am well aware of my responsibilities. Rather than preaching about it, I hope to lead by example, and unlock the door for future generations. I believe in making my mark with poise, style and grace.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The words offered a rare moment of self-effacement in an evening rich with posturing that twisted and turned, uniting not just \\u2014 as one would expect \\u2014 the great and good of the fashion industry, but also often disparate characters that even the strangest dinner party dream couldn\\u2019t summon: the actress Demi Moore, striding arm and arm with the Olympic diver Tom Daley to present the award for Designer of the Year to Kim Jones; the soccer player Patrice Evra presenting an award to the former GQ editor Dylan Jones for Culture Commentary; and Kylie Minogue, performing a special rendition of her hit song \\u201cSlow\\u201d in bespoke Richard Quinn, while surrounded by dancers in full face-covering floral bodysuits (the only attendees, other than servers, who were masked).\", \"The evening\\u2019s host, Billy Porter, used wit to puncture the pomposity, welcoming \\u201cthe old, the young and the old who have made their faces young.\\u201d Between several outfit changes, he quipped, \\u201cI really didn\\u2019t think I was going to make it, but luckily I got a job as a truck driver and they let me in\\u201d \\u2014 a nod to Britain\\u2019s supply chain issues and the fallout of Brexit, another of fashion\\u2019s many headaches.\", \"The award categories, in the past simple and to the point (best women\\u2019s wear designer, best men\\u2019s wear designer, best model), had been expanded to include looser, and more grandiose, themes, including \\u201cLeaders of Change,\\u201d an accolade given to 15 industry figures, under three different categories: \\u201cCreativity,\\u201d \\u201cEnvironment\\u201d and \\u201cPeople.\\u201d\", \"An absent Alessandro Michele, the creative director of Gucci, was the winner of the Trailblazer Award, presented and accepted on his behalf by the activist Sinead Burke, in pink feathers. \", \"\\u201cI am physically disabled, I have dwarfism,\\u201d she said when she introduced herself, noting that the award was dedicated to those who \\u201cmove hearts and minds.\\u201d She praised Gucci for its work in supporting L.G.B.T.Q. rights and the rights of the disabled. Mr. Michele, she said, has made a corner of the world \\u201cwhere people feel safe to be themselves.\\u201d\", \"Other winners included the up-and-comer Nensi Dojaka, who was given the BFC Foundation Award, the stylist Ib Kamara (also absent), who won the Isabella Blow Award for Fashion Creator, and Simone Rocha, who took home the Best Independent British Brand and whose label recently celebrated its 10-year anniversary. The pandemic has been tough, she said, especially for those without a big group behind them and with a small, young team.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s humbled a lot of people on a lot of different levels. It\\u2019s humanized the industry, and taken away a bit of the gloss and the sheen,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnybody who shows, I respect them. Anyone who managed to keep going.\\u201d\", \"Later, the dancer and internet phenomenon moonwalked and glided his way around the grand hall. His performance was apparently part of honoring Chanel for its contribution to art and culture. \\u201cChanel: Creating the conditions for artists to dare,\\u201d announced the giant screens behind Lil Buck, before being replaced, inexplicably, by a quotation often attributed to Mother Teresa.\", \"\\u201cI alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to create many ripples,\\u201d it read, though most guests seemed primarily focused on the fancy footwork (also footwear). Even Ms. Wintour craned her neck to watch the slides and twists.
