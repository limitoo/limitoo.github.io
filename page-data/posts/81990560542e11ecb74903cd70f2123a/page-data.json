And they are likely to be effective against the Omicron variant, many scientists believe, even if Omicron makes the Covid vaccines weaker at preventing infections. As Dr. Monica Gandhi of the University of California, San Francisco, told me, the treatments are \\u201ca huge deal.\\u201d\", \"In the simplest terms, they can help turn Covid into a more ordinary respiratory disease, similar to the common cold or flu, rather than one that\\u2019s killing about 1,000 Americans a day and dominating daily life for millions.\", \"Two treatments are on the way \\u2014 one from Pfizer and one from Merck \\u2014 and they will have both medical and psychological benefits. Not only can they reduce serious Covid illness, but they can also reduce Covid fears and help society move back to normalcy, lessening the pandemic\\u2019s huge social and economic side effects.\", \"(If you haven\\u2019t read my colleague Campbell Robertson\\u2019s story about the continuing crisis in schools \\u2014 including mental health problems among children and exhaustion among teachers, nurses and janitors \\u2014 it\\u2019s sobering.)\", \"Both Pfizer\\u2019s and Merck\\u2019s treatments are pill regimens that people take for five days after a positive Covid test. The pills prevent the virus from replicating inside the body and are broadly similar to treatments that revolutionized H.I.V. care in the 1990s.\", \"Pfizer\\u2019s version, which is likely to become widely available early next year, appears to be the more effective: It reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 85 percent in a research trial. Merck\\u2019s version, which should be available sooner, reduced risk by 30 percent.\", \"An F.D.A. panel of experts this week voted narrowly \\u2014 13 to 10 \\u2014 to recommend the approval of the Merck treatment. The agency has not yet said when its experts might vote on Pfizer.\", \"\\u201cThese will be game-changing for our ability to control Covid worldwide in 2022,\\u201d Gandhi said.\", \"In truth, the virus has already been largely defanged for most Americans, and it would be surprising if Omicron changed that. The death rate for vaccinated adults under 50 is virtually zero, according to data from Minnesota and King County, Wash. (which publish detailed statistics); the hospitalization rate is similar to that of a typical flu. For children, vaccinated and not, the risks are even smaller.\", \"But I know that many Americans remain terrified of Covid. After nearly two years of pandemic living, returning to normal can be hard, especially with the genuine uncertainty about Omicron. Once the treatments are widely available, they can offer reassurance, as a last line of defense against severe Covid.\", \"Of course, the medical benefits will be even bigger than the psychological benefits for people who remain vulnerable to Covid. \", \"Deaths are predominantly occurring among the unvaccinated, although vaccinated Americans older than 65 \\u2014 especially those with existing medical problems \\u2014 are also at some risk. So are a small percentage of younger Americans, like those who have had an organ transplant or are receiving some cancer treatments. (Find the death rate for any county.)\", \"One major advantage of the pills is that people can take them at home. Current Covid treatments, like monoclonal antibodies, are typically administered in a hospital.\", \"Another advantage is that they do not attack the part of the virus that changes most with each new variant: the spike protein. That\\u2019s why scientists expect the treatments will work even as the virus evolves.\", \"Pfizer has projected that it will produce enough doses to treat 20 million people in the first half of next year and another 60 million in the second half. The Biden administration has agreed to buy 10 million of the treatments, known as Paxlovid, at a cost of about $530 each. Americans will probably not have to pay much, if anything, out of pocket.\", \"As a rough sense of scale, 10 million treatments would have covered every American 65 and above who tested positive for Covid in the past year \\u2014 with millions of doses left over.\", \"Merck projects that it will produce more than 10 million courses of its drug, called molnupiravir, by the end of this year, and at least 20 million more in 2022. The federal government has agreed to buy 3.1 million of those courses for around $700 each. A Merck spokesperson said that the government would provide the drug to patients for free.\", \"Both treatments will present logistical challenges. People will likely need to prove that they have tested positive for Covid and then receive a doctor\\u2019s prescription. At least for the next several months, only vulnerable people \\u2014 those who are older or have medical conditions \\u2014 may be eligible. And the treatments involve a detailed schedule of pill-taking: three pills, twice a day, for five days, in Pfizer\\u2019s case, and two additional pills per day in Merck\\u2019s case.\", \"Ideally, the treatment should begin within five days of the first Covid symptoms.\", \"For people who can get access to the pills and take them as prescribed, they may make all the difference. In Pfizer\\u2019s research trial, the treatment reduced the risk of hospitalization by about 90 percent among people who started it within three days of having symptoms. There were zero deaths among the patients who received it.\", \"\\u201cThese treatments are not going to single-handedly end the pandemic, nor are they going to be anywhere near as impactful as vaccines,\\u201d Rebecca Robbins, who covers pharmaceuticals for The Times, told me. \\u201cBut if they can reach people fast enough, and that\\u2019s a big if, they have very real potential to save lives and ease the burden on hospitals.\\u201d\", \"More on the virus:\", \"The Supreme Court\\u2019s argument in the Mississippi abortion case includes \\u201cnonstop gaslighting,\\u201d Linda Greenhouse argues.\", \"Many Americans have nuanced views about abortion.
