A few weeks ago, the prices here broke a record that was set in 2012 and have only continued to inch up since.\", \"The coronavirus deserves much of the blame. Gas production fell when demand plummeted last year amid stay-at-home orders, and it hasn\\u2019t caught up as commuters and tourists return.\", \"Nationwide, the average cost of a gallon of fuel is $3.41, compared with $2.11 at the same time last year. In other words, our much-anticipated road trips have gotten roughly 50 percent more expensive.\", \"Over the weekend, my colleagues published a story about Americans who are canceling vacations and rejiggering their budgets to cope with pain at the pump.\", \"Kellen Browning, a New York Times reporter based in San Francisco, interviewed drivers in the city\\u2019s NoPa neighborhood who were lined up at an Arco charging $4.49 a gallon.

Some polling data links the president\\u2019s low approval ratings to high fuel costs.\", \"Here in California, hefty taxes have long made gas prices the highest in the nation. But fuel got even more expensive after an atmospheric storm pummeled Northern California last month.\", \"The heavy rains inundated oil refineries with water, which affected gas production in the region, The Los Angeles Times reported. The subsequent cost increases then trickled south to the rest of the state.\", \"Browning told me that some Californians he spoke to said the high gas prices had made them more willing to buy electric cars. Others said it had persuaded them to do all their holiday shopping online.\", \"Some blamed Gov.
