(Their mother, Donna, was also Anderson\\u2019s beloved elementary-school art teacher \\u2014 a fortuitous coincidence he realized only after having already met her daughters.) When the band is on the road, Anderson will occasionally send the Haim siblings affable emails: a silly YouTube video, an article that might inspire them. But this message was different, and a little mysterious: Just an untitled Word document.\", \"\\u201cAll of a sudden, a script opens up,\\u201d Haim said over a video call from her home in Los Angeles,\", \"\\u201cAnd the first name on the script is Alana.\\u201d Save for a few appearances playing herself in music videos, Haim had never acted before, and this was the first movie script she\\u2019d ever read. \\u201cIt was like \\u2018EXTERIOR,\\u2019\\u201d she recalled, giddily. \\u201cI was like, here we go. We\\u2019re reading a script. This is the movies.\\u201d\", \"As she read the screenplay for what would become \\u201cLicorice Pizza,\\u201d Anderson\\u2019s warm and nostalgic ninth feature, Haim thought he had sent it to let her know he had named a character after her. \\u201cI was honestly just flattered that he was using my name,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBecause when you think about Paul Thomas Anderson movies, the names are so incredibly iconic,\\u201d she said, citing the porn star Dirk Diggler of \\u201cBoogie Nights\\u201d (1997) and Reynolds Woodcock, the tempestuous fashion designer that Daniel Day-Lewis portrayed in \\u201cPhantom Thread\\u201d (2017). \\u201cI mean, I like my name, but do I think my name is iconic? Not when you put it next to, like, Reynolds Woodcock. But I was flattered. I was like, \\u2018Paul\\u2019s going to use my name in a movie.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"When presented with Alana\\u2019s version of events over the phone later that same day, Anderson sighed and then laughed for a long time. \\u201cWouldn\\u2019t it have been completely rude and insane of me to send her a script with a character named Alana, only to say, \\u2018Thanks for reading it, I appreciate your notes, I\\u2019m going to go hire an actress to play a woman named Alana? Oh and by the way, she has two sisters named Este and Danielle and there are multiple situations that have come from your life.\\u2019 What kind of friend would I be? That\\u2019s terrible.\\u201d\", \"But that would have been about as plausible as what was actually happening: A famous auteur was asking Haim, who had never been in a movie before, to carry his next feature. Later that night when they spoke on the phone and Anderson clarified his request, Haim \\u2014 in a torrent of \\u201cword-vomit\\u201d \\u2014 said yes immediately. A few hours later, the first doubts set in: \\u201cWhat if I\\u2019m just terrible? I was like, \\u2018I don\\u2019t even know where to look. What if I look at the camera?\\u201d\", \"Miraculously, she pulled it off in spades. \\u201cLicorice Pizza\\u201d establishes Haim as a revelatory and magnetic screen presence, a unique amalgamation of daffy, Carole Lombard screwball, early Sissy Spacek fresh-faced guilelessness, and an offbeat cartoon character\\u2019s nervy, can-do energy. Even when she\\u2019s sharing the frame with Sean Penn, Tom Waits or Bradley Cooper, it is her face \\u2014 freckled, elastic, unpredictable \\u2014 that commands the viewer\\u2019s attention. Critics have raved about the performance; David Rooney of The Hollywood Reporter called it \\u201cone of the most exciting screen debuts in recent memory.\\u201d\", \"Anderson said he knew Haim would be good but \\u201cI didn\\u2019t know she was going to be that good. I\\u2019ve worked with the same guys for like 20 years, and I just kept looking around at them for verification. Like, you have to tap me on my shoulder to make sure I\\u2019m seeing what I\\u2019m seeing. Don\\u2019t let me be delusional. And everybody collectively on set was seeing what I was seeing \\u2014 her skill and the way you can photograph her.\\u201d\", \"It helped that her co-star, the effortlessly charismatic Cooper Hoffman (son of Philip Seymour Hoffman, who was a frequent Anderson collaborator) had also never been in a movie before. Anderson cast him late in the process, after auditioning a number of young actors who felt too mannered and formally trained to match Haim\\u2019s naturalistic style. Hoffman and Haim had met briefly through Anderson five years prior, never thinking their paths would cross again, but as soon as they read together, Haim recalled, \\u201cIt was like, oh, we\\u2019re a team. We can take on the world together.\\u201d\", \"Despite the characters\\u2019 relatively chaste relationship, the age gap between them has caused some controversy. In real life, Haim, who turns 30 this month, is 12 years older than Hoffman (they bonded so much during the shoot that she still calls him \\u201cone of my best friends\\u201d), though in the movie her age is a little ambiguous. At one point the character says she\\u2019s 25, but there\\u2019s a pause between the two numerals that suggests she might be rounding up. \\u201cThere was never really a conversation between me and Paul about how old Alana was,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSomewhere in her early 20s. I say some ages in the movie, but you don\\u2019t really believe Alana. She kind of doesn\\u2019t even know how old she really is? She\\u2019s very secretive. But really, it\\u2019s about her and Gary\\u2019s friendship more than anything.\\u201d\", \"When we spoke on a late November afternoon, Haim was battling a sinus infection she blamed on the Santa Ana winds. As a Southern California breeze tickled the curtains of her open living-room window, she occasionally paused our conversation to blow her nose with humorous theatricality. (\\u201cOh, that was a lot!\\u201d) She wore a white T-shirt, jeans and, around her neck, her most prized possession, a \\u201cSisters of the Moon\\u201d pendant given to her by one of her idols, Stevie Nicks. In conversation Haim is garrulous and ebullient, occasionally clipping the ends off her sentences in an excited hurry to get to the next thought.\", \"As they were shooting, Anderson found that the actor Haim most reminded him of was Joaquin Phoenix, whom Anderson directed in \\u201cThe Master\\u201d (2012) and \\u201cInherent Vice\\u201d (2014).\", \"\\u201cShe can throw herself into something, a lot like Joaquin,\\u201d Anderson said. \\u201cYou cannot tell if they\\u2019re completely out of control, or if they\\u2019re so in their body that they\\u2019re able to make it look like they\\u2019re out of control. They\\u2019re very similar. It\\u2019s weird. They\\u2019re both feral, you know? You\\u2019re not really sure what\\u2019s coming next.\\u201d\", \"Her years onstage playing guitar, keyboards and percussion certainly taught her how to ground herself amid the chaos of a film set. \\u201cBeing in Haim, I\\u2019m doing so many different things and there are so many different distractions that you have to tune everything out and just be very present in your body,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd I think that really helps with shooting a movie.\\u201d\", \"Seeing herself in close-up on a huge screen for the first time was, she admitted, a bit uncomfortable: \\u201cLook, for my future boyfriends that I\\u2019ll maybe have, would I love to see less acne and maybe more glamorous vibes?\\u201d Haim asked rhetorically. \\u201cOf course. But it wouldn\\u2019t be truthful to the movie. Because growing up in the Valley where it\\u2019s 100 degrees outside, you would look worse if you wore makeup, because it would melt off and you\\u2019d look insane.\\u201d\", \"But those supposed imperfections \\u2014 and her contagious brand of self-acceptance \\u2014 are at the core of Haim\\u2019s refreshing onscreen charm. \\u201cI feel like there\\u2019s this whole thing where everybody has to be perfect in all these movies,\\u201d she said, candidly admitting that the only reason her skin looked \\u201cimpeccable and lovely\\u201d on our call that day was because she was using a Zoom filter. \\u201cBut, I have acne, and there\\u2019s nothing I can do about it \\u2014 and that\\u2019s OK!\\u201d\", \"Raised in the San Fernando Valley, the Haim siblings all took up instruments at a young age and formed a family band. What they lacked in social capital, they made up for with sisterly camaraderie and humor. \\u201cWe all wanted to be Barbra Streisand in \\u2018Funny Girl,\\u2019\\u201d Haim said. \\u201cThat was our Bible growing up. Like, \\u2018Oh, we might not be the most gorgeous person in the seventh grade, and no one wants to make out with us, but we could be the funniest!\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The sisters had their first gig as a trio when Alana was just 10, at Los Angeles\\u2019s storied Jewish institution Canter\\u2019s Deli. Their breakthrough came in 2013 when they released their debut album, \\u201cDays Are Gone,\\u201d a collection of sleek, percussive pop-rock songs. They\\u2019ve since collaborated several times with their former tour-mate Taylor Swift, and their best and most recent album, \\u201cWomen in Music, Pt. III\\u201d (2020), was nominated for the album of the year Grammy.\", \"Even though the siblings all harmonize and trade instruments, Alana is still known in the band, as in the family, as \\u201cBaby Haim.\\u201d Danielle is the de facto lead singer and guitarist, while the bassist Este is known for the gloriously over-the-top \\u201cbass faces\\u201d she makes onstage. Alana sometimes falls through the cracks. \\u201cI\\u2019m the baby, so that\\u2019s how I grew up with my siblings: \\u2018I\\u2019m just happy that you guys want me to hang out,\\u2019\\u201d she said modestly. \\u201cThat was my whole upbringing.\\u201d\", \"All the members of the Haim family appear sporadically in \\u201cLicorice Pizza\\u201d \\u2014 their father, Mordechai, is a bona fide scene-stealer. But Alana is the movie\\u2019s beating heart, and her star turn feels like her long-delayed \\u201cFunny Girl\\u201d moment. That was apparent from her very first day of shooting: she was not only driving a vintage moving truck that required her to learn to operate a stick shift, but also improvising hilariously alongside a deliriously entertaining Bradley Cooper, who plays a manic version of Streisand\\u2019s onetime boyfriend, the producer Jon Peters. \\u201cAt the end of the day, once I got the hang of it, I felt like a badass,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI was like, not only can I drive stick \\u2014 but a \\u201970s U-Haul with a movie star and my best friend in the truck.\\u201d\", \"She\\u2019d love to keep acting \\u2014 and working with Anderson \\u2014 if the right projects arise, but she\\u2019s also happy to have a day job to fall back on. \\u201cAfter this chapter is over with \\u2018Licorice Pizza,\\u2019 I go back on tour with my band, and I\\u2019m back to my other job that I love so much,\\u201d she said. \\u201cNothing has changed. I\\u2019m still the baby.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"439bf4e256af11ecb0a47d8f1b74d5e9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"439bf4e256af11ecb0a47d8f1b74d5e9"}},
