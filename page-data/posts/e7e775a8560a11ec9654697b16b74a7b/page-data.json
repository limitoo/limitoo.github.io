In 2014 Susan and Chris were each sentenced to at least 25 years in prison for killing Susan\\u2019s parents and burying them in their own backyard.\", \"The Edwardses claimed that Susan\\u2019s mother had shot her husband and that Susan, who hated her abusive parents, had been provoked into shooting her mother \\u2014 a crime of passion followed by years\\u2019 of guilt-ridden cover-up. Prosecutors said that Susan and Chris carried out a calculated execution for profit, an argument supported by the inconvenient fact that they opened a bank account the first business day after the killings and eventually siphoned off about 285,000 pounds of her parents\\u2019 money.\", \"The case is full of fascinating and outlandish details \\u2014 a straightforward retelling would have no trouble being greenlit \\u2014 but one stands out: what they spent the money on. They were spendthrift collectors of autographed movie memorabilia. When they turned themselves in 15 years after the killings, all they had left was some spare change.\", \"Ed Sinclair, a first-time screenwriter, and the director Will Sharpe build their four-episode series around that detail, in imaginative and highly stylized ways that shift the focus away from true-crime investigation. \\u201cLandscapers\\u201d recounts the case, but the crime is one element in Susan and Chris\\u2019s love story, a star-crossed tale of two damaged people constructing a world in which they can survive, at least until the money runs out.\", \"This involves a wide range of filmmaking tricks. Sharpe shoots some scenes as keyholes in a black screen, as if we\\u2019re watching a play. Others he stages like full-on Hollywood productions, echoing the films Susan loves, like \\u201cHigh Noon\\u201d and \\u201cThe Last Metro.\\u201d (Gary Cooper and G\\u00e9rard Depardieu are significant, if imaginary, figures in the story.) At key moments Sharpe literally breaks the fourth wall, pulling back the camera to show us the soundstage as the actors, in and out of character, walk from one set to another.\", \"In the hands of the gifted Sharpe, who directed the series \\u201cFlowers,\\u201d starring Colman, and the feature \\u201cThe Electrical Life of Louis Wain\\u201d (with Benedict Cumberbatch), these interventions are mostly engaging rather than distracting. They set up a theme of artifice and delusion, but \\u201cLandscapers,\\u201d thankfully, isn\\u2019t about the tyranny of modern media \\u2014 it\\u2019s more about the ways in which ordinary, troubled people make sense of their lives by casting themselves in the stories of heroism and self-sacrifice that they\\u2019ve seen at the movies. The show doesn\\u2019t have to take a position on whether the Edwardses were telling the truth about what happened in the real world, because it lives inside the reality they constructed.\", \"If \\u201cLandscapers\\u201d doesn\\u2019t, in the end, entirely fulfill the promise of Sharpe\\u2019s visual wizardry, it\\u2019s down to the screenplay by Sinclair, who is also Colman\\u2019s husband and producing partner. It doesn\\u2019t match the inventiveness of the direction, and it\\u2019s also more murky (and sentimental) than it needs to be about Susan\\u2019s true nature, which slightly dampens Colman\\u2019s performance. She spends most of the series playing things down the middle, and she\\u2019s only able to break out her fierce, splendid technique in a few scenes.\", \"The script does much better by Chris, though, and \\u201cLandscapers\\u201d is a showcase for Thewlis, with his angular frame and his distinctive style of commanding awkwardness. He perfectly captures Chris\\u2019s willing subservience to Susan, and the way that his love for this \\u201cfragile\\u201d woman, who\\u2019s also demanding and manipulative, shapes his personality in a manner that might seem pathetic to us but that is ennobling and ego-boosting to him.\", \"Thewlis is phenomenal throughout \\u2014 in a pinpoint moment when Chris is thrown off by evidence of Susan\\u2019s dishonesty, or in the larger gestures of the movie-love scenes, as when he twirls a six-shooter like a pro (before dropping it, of course). \\u201cLandscapers\\u201d may be noncommittal on the Edwardses\\u2019 guilt, but Thewlis absolutely nails Chris.\"]","href_hash":"e7e775a8560a11ec9654697b16b74a7b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e7e775a8560a11ec9654697b16b74a7b"}},
