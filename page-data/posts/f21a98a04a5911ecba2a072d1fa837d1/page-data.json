The sheen appeared in the same area as the Huntington Beach oil spill last month that was caused by a damaged pipeline.\", \"\\\"Oil sheen approximately 30x70' in size has been reported in vicinity of damaged pipeline,\\\" the Coast Guard wrote. \\\"Unified Command has dispatched pollution responders, aircraft and boats to investigate reported sheen.\\\"\", \"\\\"It's right where the other incident occurred,\\\" a public information officer told CBS Los Angeles.\", \"The Huntington Beach Fire Department said it deployed a safety boat to evaluate the surrounding area and has preventive equipment on standby if necessary, according to CBS Los Angeles.\", \"Although a new leak has not been confirmed, several local politicians said they had been informed of the reports.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Just received news that there's another reported oil spill in the same location as the previous #HuntingtonBeachOilSpill or nearby, 30' x 70' sheen being currently observed,\\\" California State Senator Dave Min tweeted. \\\"Will post further updates as I get them.

The only foolproof way to stop these incidents is to end offshore drilling in California.\\\"\", \"Last month's oil spill, initially reported on October 2, spewed 25,000 gallons of oil into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Orange County, according to the Associated Press. Coast Guard officials said it came from\\u00a0a leak in a pipeline\\u00a0owned by Houston-based Amplify Energy Corp. that shuttles crude oil from offshore platforms to the coast. Authorities believe the anchor of a cargo ship named Beijing dragged along the ocean floor and damaged the pipeline as early as January, CBS Los Angeles reports. The investigation into the previous oil spill is ongoing.\", \"Sophie Reardon is a News Editor at CBS News.
