What we want is for migrants to be encouraged to come here and settle for the long term,\\\" Nana said.\", \"There were sporadic examples of migrants being vulnerable to exploitation, he said.\", \"\\\"Rather than tying a migrant to one specific employer, we may tie that migrant to an industry, occupation or region.\\\"\", \"Nana also said the number of temporary migrant visas with pathways to residence should be linked to the number of residence visas on offer.\", \"\\\"Large queues for residency have left many migrants in flux and unable to settle. The mismatch between migrant expectations and the reality of residence falls well short of manaakitanga, and is not good for our international reputation as global competition for some skilled migrants intensifies.\\\"\", \"Another recommendation was that Treaty interests should be recognised in immigration, Nana said.\", \"Public submissions on the proposals are open until Christmas, with the final report set to presented to the government by April.\"]","href_hash":"9138fa4e3ff811ec9cabdb609ea31a58"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9138fa4e3ff811ec9cabdb609ea31a58"}},
