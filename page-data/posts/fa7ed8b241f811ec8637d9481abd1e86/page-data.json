Her team helped the man with food and a phone.\", \"\\\"He was using public toilets and had to fill his car up and stuff,\\\" she says. \\\"Very dangerous and very risky to the public.\\\"\", \"Beachlands resident Dave Austin's been trying to keep his business going amid the pandemic. Adding to his anxiety, his son's in a tiny flat with two COVID-positive people.\", \"\\\"It's just one level of confusion and frustration across the whole board,\\\" he says.\", \"He's frustrated because he and his son have struggled to get clarity, especially regarding how long his son - who's negative - must isolate for.\", \"On one call with public health, he says officials insisted his son was not at home but in MIQ.\", \"\\\"She couldn't believe that he wasn't in an MIQ. She said he's registered here as being in an MIQ,\\\" Austin says.\", \"There's been a sharp rise in people isolating at home with the virus.
