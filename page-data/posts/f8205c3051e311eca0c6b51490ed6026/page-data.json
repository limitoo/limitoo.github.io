Mallory and his climbing partner, Andrew Irvine, didn\\u2019t survive, but whatever images they shot might answer the question of whether they reached the summit. When Fukamachi subsequently sees a reclusive Japanese climber, Habu (voiced at different ages by \\u00c9ric Herson Macarel and Lazare Herson Macarel), snatch the Vest Pocket Kodak, he suspects the device might be legit.\", \"Employing a faintly \\u201cCitizen Kane\\u201d-like approach to structure, the movie\\u2019s first half alternates between Fukamachi\\u2019s investigations into what motivated Habu\\u2019s disappearance and flashbacks to Habu\\u2019s life, with the contents of the camera serving as the functional equivalent of Rosebud. Patrick Imbert, making his feature-directing debut, works with a plainness of line and motion and a subdued color palette that appear to owe more to certain anime artists than the textured illustrations of the original manga. Imbert is said to have drawn inspiration from the \\u201cGrave of the Fireflies\\u201d filmmaker Isao Takahata, among others.\", \"The present action of this time-hopping film is subtly placed several years before the unmentioned real-life discovery of Mallory\\u2019s body, sans camera, in 1999.
