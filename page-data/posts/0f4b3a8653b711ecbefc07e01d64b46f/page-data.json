to win approval in parliament for her anti-vaccination mandate bill in recent weeks, One Nation leader Pauline Hanson is continuing to campaign against such measures, speaking at a so-called \\\"freedom\\\" rally last weekend in Broadwater, Queensland.\", \"\\\"In England, now it's stated that more people are dying with COVID who are double-vaxxed than unvaxxed,\\\" Senator Hanson told the assembled crowd. \\\"It is a fact.\\\"\", \"The\\u00a0latest data\\u00a0published by the UK Health Security Agency shows that of 3,726 COVID-19 deaths over a three-week period to November 21, 2,903 were people fully vaccinated against the disease, compared to 708 unvaccinated people.\", \"However, those figures do not mean that vaccinated people are at a higher risk of death from COVID-19.\", \"The UK report also provides the rate of death per 100,000 people in each group.\", \"That data reveals that the rate of death among unvaccinated people across the UK was higher for every age bracket when compared to those who were double-dosed.\", \"According to Tony Blakely, an epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne, when it came to being infected with the Delta variant of coronavirus, fully vaccinated people were around 90 per cent less likely to die than those who weren't vaccinated.\", \"\\\"We can say mathematically if vaccination reduces your chance of death by, say, 90 per cent, then once more than 90 per cent of the population is vaccinated you would expect the [number of] deaths among the vaccinated and unvaccinated to be similar,\\\" Professor Blakely said in an email.\", \"He noted that high rates of natural COVID-19 infection in the UK community added complexity.\", \"\\\"For example, if 90 per cent of the population are vaccinated and, of the remaining 10 per cent half of them (that is, 5 per cent of total population) have already had a natural infection, they will be better protected than the vaccinated,\\\" he explained.\", \"\\\"So, because an increasing fraction of the unvaccinated have had an infection in the past, this will tip more of the infections, hospitalisations and deaths to be among the vaccinated.\", \"\\\"But the bottom line remains \\u2014 the unvaccinated have a much much higher chance of death on their first infection than do the vaccinated.\\\"\", \"Additionally, in footnotes attached to its data, the UK agency notes that vaccinations were prioritised for individuals who were more vulnerable to catching COVID-19, while \\\"individuals in risk groups may be more at risk of hospitalisation or death due to non-COVID-19 causes, and thus may be hospitalised or die with COVID-19 rather than because of COVID-19\\\".\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">No, the Omicron virus variant is not a massive cover-up of

of the Omicron variant has prompted a wave of bans on travel from southern African nations.(Reuters: Sumaya Hisham)</div>\", \"With planned easings of border restrictions postponed and quarantine for returned travellers re-established, the emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has evidently alarmed health officials and governments.\", \"Online, however, some social media posters have suggested that the variant is a global ruse designed to cover up cases of serious adverse reactions to COVID-19 vaccines.\", \"A screenshot from an Indian tech company blog forms the basis for such claims, with the image highlighting a list citing \\\"a number of heart-related complications\\\" including \\\"heart failure, arrhythmias, heart inflammation and blood clots\\\" among potential symptoms of an Omicron infection.\", \"According to those alleging a cover-up, these symptoms match known side-effects of COVID-19 vaccines.\", \"\\\"So after a year of covering-up mass [vaccine] casualties with BLOOD CLOTS, HEART INFLAMMATION & HEART FAILURE, they try to tell us that the new Omicron variant causes BLOOD CLOTS, HEART INFLAMMATION & HEART FAILURE???,\\\" one Twitter user wrote alongside the screenshot.\", \"But as an administrator of the tech blog has since clarified, the post did not identify any COVID-19 symptoms, including heart complications, unique to the Omicron variant.\", \"\\\"All the symptoms mentioned are already existing with the coronavirus,\\\" the administrator wrote in a comment on the blog post, which has since been updated to remove the references to heart-related symptoms.\", \"\\\"Just type the Symptoms of the Coronavirus in your browser and you can find all these symptoms on many trusted health or news Portals. I haven't mentioned anything new here.\\\"\", \"Indeed, as Jason Kovacic, the executive director of the\\u00a0Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, told Fact Check, COVID-19 could affect the heart and cardiovascular system in a number of ways.\", \"\\\"These include blood clots, increased inflammation, heart failure and heart rhythm problems,\\\" Professor Kovacic wrote.\", \"\\\"A heart attack can also be triggered in several ways by COVID-19 infection, including by small blood clots in the arteries to the heart, due to the massive inflammatory response seen with COVID-19 infection causing a \\u2018plaque rupture' that is the usual cause of myocardial infection, or via other ways.\\\"\", \"As for whether Omicron specifically led to heart-related symptoms, Professor Kovacic explained that there was \\\"very little data about the nature\\\" of infections caused by the variant.\", \"\\\"As far as we are aware, there are no data yet about the effects of the Omicron variant on the heart and whether its effects are more severe, similar, or less severe than other variants.\\\"\", \"He added that for the vast majority of the population, the benefits of vaccination against COVID-19 \\\"overwhelmingly\\\" outweighed any potential risks.\", \"\\\"Myocarditis/pericarditis has been reported to occur in 12.6 cases per million doses of the second-dose mRNA vaccine among those 12 to 39 years of age,\\\" Professor Kovacic noted.\", \"\\\"However, myocarditis/pericarditis is more likely to be seen following COVID-19, with one study showing rates as high as 450 cases per million in males under 20 years of age.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">No, a 'detox' won't undo your vaccination</div>\", \"<img

potentially uncomfortable results.\", \"As\\u00a0NBC reports, a video viewed hundreds of thousands of times on TikTok before being removed claimed that people can \\\"detox\\\" from \\\"the vaxx\\\" by soaking in a bath containing minerals such as borax \\u2014 a common cleaning agent that\\u00a0may cause eye and skin irritation\\u00a0and is\\u00a0poisonous if ingested.\", \"The video was created by Dr Carrie Madej, who\\u00a0describes herself\\u00a0as \\\"an osteopathic internal medicine doctor\\\" and has previously been\\u00a0caught out by fact checkers at PolitiFact\\u00a0for falsely claiming that COVID-19 vaccines contain \\\"RNA-modifying transhumanism-nano-technology\\\".\", \"Though the original video has been deleted, it lives on through TikTok's \\\"duets\\\" feature, which allows users to react to and record their own videos alongside the original.\", \"In one such video, seen by Fact Check, Madej says her bath will take care of radiation poisoning and pesticides, and that the borax will \\\"take nanotechnology out of you\\\".\", \"Other users have made their own videos spruiking similar recipes.\", \"These baths have been promoted through Australian Telegram channels alongside other supposed cures to detox from the COVID-19 \\\"spike protein\\\" \\u2014 a harmless protein that is produced\\u00a0then destroyed\\u00a0by the body following vaccination, in the case of the vaccines available in Australia.\", \"So, can a \\\"detox\\\" undo the vaccination itself?\", \"Dr Kylie Quinn, an immunologist with RMIT University, told Fact Check that trying to detox the body of a vaccine was like trying to put \\\"the genie back in the bottle\\\", and that it was not possible to \\\"make your immune system forget\\\" the series of events triggered by a vaccination inside the body's cells.\", \"Similarly, NBC quoted virologist Angela Rasmussenas as saying it was \\\"just not physically possible\\\" to undo the vaccine process.\", \"In a statement published on her website, Dr Madej claims: \\\"I have never stated that I can detox anyone from the current jabs\\\".\", \"\\\"The detox was never specific for a jab or vaccine, and I have always advised not to take the jabs since \\u2026 no one knows how to detox from them.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">In other news: Anthony Albanese's claims on Australia's broadband speed
