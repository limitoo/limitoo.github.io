Wade, the decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-02T01:16:46.000Z","content":"[\"The Supreme Court seemed poised on Wednesday to uphold a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, in what would be a momentous and polarizing decision to roll back the abortion rights the court has defined over the last half century.\", \"During sometimes tense and heated questioning in almost two hours of oral arguments, the court\\u2019s six conservative justices signaled they are comfortable with the Mississippi law, even though upholding it would be flatly at odds with Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion and prohibited states from banning the procedure before fetal viability, currently around 23 weeks.\", \"Moving that line to 15 weeks would discard decades of precedent. Several of the conservative justices appeared ready to go further and overrule Roe entirely, letting states decide whether and when to ban abortions \\u2014 an outcome that would transform regulation of abortion in 20 or more states that have been seeking to impose more restrictions and that would further inflame the long-running political and cultural divisions over the issue.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re arguing that the Constitution is silent and, therefore, neutral on the question of abortion?\\u201d Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh asked a lawyer for Mississippi, with seeming approval. \\u201cIn other words, that the Constitution is neither pro-life nor pro-choice on the question of abortion but leaves the issue for the people of the states or perhaps Congress to resolve in the democratic process?\\u201d\", \"Until the last few years, the prospect of overruling Roe would have seemed far-fetched. But President Donald J. Trump came into office having vowed to name justices who would overrule Roe. His three appointees have reshaped the court, which now has a six-justice conservative supermajority.\", \"The court\\u2019s three liberal members said that overruling Roe soon after a change in the court\\u2019s membership would damage the court\\u2019s legitimacy. Indeed, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said, doing so would pose an existential threat to the court.\", \"\\u201cWill this institution survive the stench that this creates in the public perception that the Constitution and its reading are just political acts?\\u201d she asked.\", \"\\u201cIf people actually believe that it\\u2019s all political, how will we survive?\\u201d she asked. \\u201cHow will the court survive?\\u201d\", \"The most significant change in the court\\u2019s composition was the most recent one. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died last year, was a committed supporter of abortion rights, saying that access to the procedure was crucial to women\\u2019s equality. Her replacement, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, is a conservative who has spoken out against \\u201cabortion on demand.\\u201d\", \"Emboldened by the changes, state legislatures have enacted scores of restrictions and bans, many of them at odds with existing precedent, in the hopes of winning a favorable outcome from the Supreme Court in cases like the one heard by the justices on Wednesday.\", \"The law at issue in the case, Dobbs v. Jackson Women\\u2019s Health Organization, No. 19-1392, was enacted in 2018 by the Republican-dominated Mississippi Legislature. It banned abortions if \\u201cthe probable gestational age of the unborn human\\u201d was determined to be more than 15 weeks. The statute, a calculated challenge to Roe, included narrow exceptions for medical emergencies or \\u201ca severe fetal abnormality.\\u201d\", \"Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who is both an institutionalist and an incrementalist, proposed taking a significant step that would stop short of allowing states to bar abortion entirely.\", \"\\u201cThe thing that is at issue before us today is 15 weeks,\\u201d he said, suggesting that the court could uphold Mississippi\\u2019s law and leave for another day the question of whether earlier cutoffs are constitutional.\", \"\\u201cIf you think that the issue is one of choice, that women should have a choice to terminate their pregnancy, that supposes that there is a point at which they\\u2019ve had the fair choice \\u2014 opportunity to choose \\u2014 and why would 15 weeks be an inappropriate line?\\u201d he asked.\", \"But none of the other conservative justices gave much indication that they were interested in the chief justice\\u2019s intermediate approach.\", \"Justices Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch asked a series of questions of the lawyer for the Jackson Women\\u2019s Health Organization, Mississippi\\u2019s sole abortion clinic, suggesting that they saw no half measures.\", \"The arguments were a vivid display of the continued intensity of the divide over abortion and the issues it touches on. The justices and advocates on both sides debated topics that ranged from the weight that should be given to the court\\u2019s precedents to the fundamental rights of women and what it means to have life.\", \"The court\\u2019s decision is not expected until June or July, and coalitions at the court may shift as the justices deliberate and exchange draft opinions. But the vote on the bottom line of whether the Mississippi law passes constitutional muster, on the evidence of Wednesday\\u2019s questioning and the justices\\u2019 earlier writings, seemed likely to be 6 to 3, splitting along the usual lines.\", \"The court\\u2019s three liberal members \\u2014 Justices Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \\u2014 were adamant that Roe should stand, and they will presumably dissent.\", \"The live question in the case is whether Chief Justice Roberts can attract votes from the other conservative justices for his narrower approach, one upholding the Mississippi law but not overruling Roe in so many words. It seemed that he would face an uphill fight.\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett, for instance, asked a question suggesting that a ruling overturning Roe would not have a ripple effect on rulings on the right to privacy or gay rights. She also asked questions about the availability of adoptions.\", \"Still, Chief Justice Roberts worked hard to narrow the question before the court.\", \"When it decided Roe in 1973, the court said states could not ban abortions before fetal viability, the point at which the fetus can survive outside the womb. That was around 28 weeks at the time, but because of improvements in medical technology, it is around 22 to 24 weeks now.\", \"Roe also established a framework to govern abortion regulation based on the trimesters of pregnancy. In the first trimester, it allowed almost no regulations. In the second, it allowed regulations to protect women\\u2019s health. In the third, it allowed states to ban abortions so long as exceptions were made to protect the life and health of the mother.\", \"The court discarded the trimester framework in 1992 in another landmark decision, Planned Parenthood v. Casey. But Casey retained what it called Roe\\u2019s \\u201cessential holding\\u201d \\u2014 that women have a constitutional right to terminate their pregnancies until fetal viability.\", \"On Wednesday, Chief Justice Roberts repeatedly questioned whether the viability line \\u2014 the standard that allows abortions up to 22-24 weeks \\u2014 was crucial and whether it was an integral part of Roe.\", \"His point, it seemed, was that the court could move the line without overruling Roe.\", \"\\u201cWas viability an issue in the case?\\u201d he asked Scott G. Stewart, Mississippi\\u2019s solicitor general, referring to Roe. \\u201cI know it wasn\\u2019t briefed or argued.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Stewart said no.\", \"The chief justice acknowledged that Casey called viability \\u201cthe core principle or a central principle in Roe.\\u201d But he said that nothing in Casey \\u2014 which also gave states leeway to impose restrictions on abortions if they did not impose an \\u201cundue burden\\u201d on women \\u2014 turned on viability.\", \"Chief Justice Roberts added that much of the rest of the world has limits similar to the one in the Mississippi law.\", \"Julie Rikelman, a lawyer for the abortion clinic challenging the Mississippi law, disputed that, saying that limits in many other countries are subject to significant exceptions.\", \"Should Roe be overturned, at least 20 states will immediately or in short order make almost all abortions unlawful, forcing women who can afford it to travel long distances to obtain the procedure.\", \"In remarks to reporters on Wednesday, President Biden said the court should leave its abortion jurisprudence undisturbed. \\u201cI support Roe v. Wade,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s the rational position to take and I continue to support it.\\u201d\", \"At the argument, Mr. Stewart, Mississippi\\u2019s lawyer, said that Roe and Casey have caused turmoil and should be overruled outright. The decisions, he said, \\u201chaunt our country.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThey have no basis in the Constitution,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey have no home in our history or traditions. They\\u2019ve damaged the democratic process. They\\u2019ve poisoned the law. They\\u2019ve choked off compromise.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Stewart said the availability of abortion is a question best determined by the political process, not judges.\", \"\\u201cAbortion is a hard issue,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt demands the best from all of us, not a judgment by just a few of us.\\u201d\", \"Chief Justice Roberts expressed frustration with Mississippi\\u2019s litigation strategy. In the state\\u2019s petition seeking Supreme Court review, officials told the justices that \\u201cthe questions presented in this petition do not require the court to overturn Roe or Casey,\\u201d though lawyers for the state did raise the possibility in a footnote. Once the court agreed to hear the case, the state shifted its emphasis and began a sustained assault on those precedents.\", \"That amounted to a bait-and-switch, Chief Justice Roberts suggested.\", \"Mr. Stewart said the state was presenting the court with all of the available options.\", \"Ms. Rikelman, representing the abortion clinic, urged the justices to respect precedent and women\\u2019s autonomy.\", \"\\u201cFor a state to take control of a woman\\u2019s body and demand that she go through pregnancy and childbirth, with all the physical risks and life-altering consequences that brings, is a fundamental deprivation of her liberty,\\u201d Ms. Rikelman said. \\u201cPreserving a woman\\u2019s right to make this decision until viability protects her liberty while logically balancing the other interests at stake.\\u201d\", \"The more liberal justices pressed Mr. Stewart on the dangers of overruling a longstanding precedent after changes in the membership of the court.\", \"Justice Breyer quoted from Casey: \\u201cTo overrule under fire in the absence of the most compelling reason to re-examine a watershed decision would subvert the court\\u2019s legitimacy beyond any serious question.\\u201d\", \"He said the court\\u2019s authority was at stake.\", \"\\u201cFeelings run high,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd it is particularly important to show what we do in overturning a case is grounded in principle and not social pressure, not political pressure.\\u201d\", \"Justice Kagan said that the court should not unsettle a half-century of law under Roe and Casey.\", \"\\u201cSome people think those decisions made the right balance and some people thought they made the wrong balance,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut in the end, we are in the same exact place as we were then \\u2014 except that we\\u2019re not, because there\\u2019s been years of water under the bridge, 50 years of decisions saying that this is part of our law, that this is part of the fabric of women\\u2019s existence in this country.\\u201d\", \"But Justice Kavanaugh said that some precedents deserved to be overruled.\", \"\\u201cIf you think about some of the most important cases, the most consequential cases in this court\\u2019s history, there\\u2019s a string of them where the cases overruled precedent,\\u201d he said, listing several, notably Brown v. Board of Education, which barred segregation in public schools.\", \"\\u201cWhy then doesn\\u2019t the history of this court\\u2019s practice with respect to those cases tell us that the right answer is actually a return to the position of neutrality?\\u201d he asked.\"]","href_hash":"5caabf57530d11ecb74ec955a41e95b6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5caabf57530d11ecb74ec955a41e95b6"}},
