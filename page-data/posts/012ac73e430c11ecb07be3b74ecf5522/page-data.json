Lukashenko of Belarus has once again turned to his most reliable patron and supporter: President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. The two have met in person at least five times this year, and Moscow has been steadfast despite a storm of criticism from Western leaders.\", \"Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin\\u2019s spokesman, said on Thursday that Russia was doing all it could to resolve the situation, according to the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. But he also warned of the possibility of a military escalation, given the presence of troops on both sides.\", \"\\u201cIndeed, the rise in tensions on this border where highly armed people \\u2014 meaning the military \\u2014 are present on both sides is a matter of utmost concern to all sober-thinking people in Europe,\\u201d Mr. Peskov told reporters.\", \"But it was not clear what, if anything, Russia was doing to resolve a crisis that has escalated the tensions between Mr. Lukashenko and the European Union to their highest level yet since the Belarusian strongman claimed a victory in a broadly disputed election last year.\", \"To Mr. Putin, the crisis appears to be an opportunity to force European governments \\u2014 many of which claim that Mr. Lukashenko is an illegitimate leader \\u2014 to negotiate directly with the Belarusian ruler. On Thursday, Mr. Putin held that line in his second phone call in recent days with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, who has been Europe\\u2019s primary interlocutor with the Russian president in times of crisis.\", \"\\u201cThe importance of settling the acute migration crisis that has emerged as fast as possible in accordance with international humanitarian norms was confirmed,\\u201d the Kremlin said of the phone call. \\u201cVladimir Putin spoke in favor of resuming contacts between E.U. countries and Belarus with the goal of solving this problem.\\u201d\", \"Underscoring Russia\\u2019s support, Russian strategic bombers conducted exercises with Belarusian forces for the second day in a row on Thursday, the Belarusian Defense Ministry said.\", \"\\u201cWe must constantly monitor the situation on the border,\\u201d Mr. Lukashenko said. \\u201cYes, these are bombers that are able to carry nuclear weapons.
