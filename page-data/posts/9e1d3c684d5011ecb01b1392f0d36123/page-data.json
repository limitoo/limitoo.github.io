Rittenhouse was tried on multiple felony charges after fatally shooting two men and wounding another.\", \"In the Instagram post, the Saddle River Range said it wanted to \\\"clear up some confusion\\\" about the sale.\", \"\\\"We are celebrating the life that Kyle Rittenhouse now gets to live because he was able to defend himself without being penalized for it. This is a big win for the Second Amendment and cause for celebration,\\\" the post's caption said.\", \"\\\"For those of you who think we are celebrating 'the death of innocent people,' we apologize that you didn't take the time to gather and evaluate the actual facts from the case. We hope you decide to do so in the near future,\\\" the caption added.\", \"Speaking with KPRC, Saddle River Range owner Thomas Bolsch said that the sale is meant to celebrate \\\"the acquittal from a Second Amendment standpoint and a right to defend yourself point.\", \"\\\"We did not celebrate and we do not celebrate the loss of life,\\\" Bolsch told the news station. \\\"I wouldn't change a thing.\\\"\", \"The gun store's sale follows last week's acquittal of Rittenhouse by a Kenosha jury, which found him not guilty of first-degree intentional homicide and four other charges in the shooting deaths of Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber and the wounding of Gaige Grosskreutz on August 25, 2020. The defense argued that Rittenhouse had acted in self-defense.\", \"\\\"I didn't do anything wrong. I defended myself,\\\" Rittenhouse told the jury.\", \"Gun rights advocates applauded the jury's decision. National Foundation for Gun Rights Executive Director Dudley Brown said, \\\"When we saw the video evidence of Kyle defending himself and others in Kenosha, WI, NFGR made the decision to support him right away, and we're thrilled to see that he is now a free man.\\\"\", \"Gun control advocacy groups had a much different response to the verdict. One of them, March for Our Lives, said, \\\"Young people are enraged watching this trial, and we refuse to accept this as our normal.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939713/kyle-rittenhouse.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A Texas gun store is holding a \\\"not guilty\\\" sale following the not guilty verdict reached last week by the jury in the Kyle Rittenhouse homicide trial.
