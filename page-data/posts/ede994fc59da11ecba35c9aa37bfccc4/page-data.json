Although Moore's \\\"hypetags\\\"\\u2014like his other contraptions\\u2014appear to have a comical edge, TikTokers are not seeing the funny side.\", \"Hypetags are a \\\"digital price tag for your sneakers that updates with their current price on [online marketplace] StockX,\\\" Moore explained in the video.\", \"\\\"After paying way too much for these shoes, I realized there was no way non-sneakerhead normies would know how valuable they were, so I had to figure out a new way to flex,\\\" he added.\", \"The footage then cuts to a video call with friends, where one suggests that Moore take the live price \\\"and put it right on the shoe.\\\" So, he did exactly that.\", \"Moore coded and 3D printed the tags, adding digital screens to the front. The tags are clipped straight onto the laces.\", \"At the end of the video, Moore attempted to show off his rising sneaker value, but was left with a price drop instead.\", \"Although all clues point to the invention being a joke, many TikTokers were left annoyed by the premise of \\\"hypetags.\\\"\", \"\\\"If i see you wearing this, i'm stepping on your shoes,\\\" wrote one commenter.\", \"\\\"How to get mugged 101,\\\" added another.\", \"\\\"I understand this is a joke, but some people really be like this, I feel bad for those people,\\\" posted a third TikTok user.\", \"A sneaker collector, @cyberexboyfriend, said Moore's video was emblematic of how the community had changed in recent years. \\\"The whole point of sneakers is that they were a collectors' club with history and storytelling behind each shoe,\\\" he said. \\\"It was very much, if you knew how much they cost, you knew how much they'd cost. It's stealth wealth.\\\"\", \"In August, Moore unveiled another sneaker-based invention on his TikTok account\\u2014the \\\"Shoom.\\\" It is, of course, a camera that shows off your sneakers when you're on a video call for work.\", \"He vowed to fight a scourge of modern life\\u2014people stealing your phone charger. The Cable Clamp Cover replaces the outlet cover on your wall, but the technology means the charger can't be taken out of the wall without a screwdriver.\", \"The charger cable is fed through the new cover and the charging brick slips right into it. The cover is then screwed into the wall, essentially trapping the charger inside so family, friends or roommates can't take it for themselves.\", \"Unlike Moore with the \\\"hypetags,\\\" however, Benedetto was inundated with comments from people demanding to know where they could get their hands on one.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949251/sneakers-store.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Sneakers are displayed on the wall of a store in Paris on October 8, 2019. </div>\"]","href_hash":"ede994fc59da11ecba35c9aa37bfccc4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ede994fc59da11ecba35c9aa37bfccc4"}},
