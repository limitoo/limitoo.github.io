Because of that, the dye is also often used as a reference point for coaches and racers to talk about when to start turns, which can sometimes be a few feet above the line.\", \"\\u201cI sometimes wonder what they did before blue dye,\\u201d said Breezy Johnson, an American downhill skier, on Instagram after a competition in December 2021. \\u201cHats off to those people,\\u201d she added.\", \"Contrast is key in these winter sports.
