The official announcement comes five years after FARC, or the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, signed a peace deal that concluded a half-century of political attacks. Among the acts carried out by the army were assassinations, kidnappings, and other forms of political dissent, the AP reported.\", \"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken released a statement on the decision and attributed the designation removal to the army's disbandment. He explained that the rescindment was made because FARC \\\"no longer exists as a unified organization that engages in terrorism or terrorist activity or has the capability or intent to do so.\\\"\", \"However, there were other reasons why FARC, which now operates in Colombia as a far-left political party, was removed from the list. According to the Associated Press, keeping the army on the list prevented U.S. agencies and their contractors from assisting development projects in the country.\", \"Despite the transition into politics, some former members of FARC have held out and created organizations of their own. Dissidents of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia-People's Army and Segunda Marquetalia are now labeled as foreign terrorist organizations in the U.S.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942566/farc-mural.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Biden administration formally removed the designation of the FARC guerilla army on Tuesday.
