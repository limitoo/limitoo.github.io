A day earlier, the building had pancaked into a heap of concrete.\", \"With scores still missing, government officials, security forces and volunteers descended on the area, as families crying and huddling nearby awaited news of their loved ones.\", \"Mr. Hamzat did not specify what problems the inspectors found that had led them to order construction halted. \\u201cThey saw some abnormalities,\\u201d he said, \\u201cso they shut it down for those things to be corrected.\\u201d\", \"But the head of the Lagos State Building Control Agency, Gbolahan Oki, said the developer had used inferior material in the construction. \\u201cThe materials he used, the reinforcement, are so terrible,\\u201d Mr. Oki told journalists.\", \"The high-rise was one of three that were being put up by Fourscore Homes, a Lagos-based real estate firm.
