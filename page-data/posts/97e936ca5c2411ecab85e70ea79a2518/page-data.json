The buzz was not because of a stylish aesthetic or historical significance, but rather the contrast between the truck\\u2019s retro looks and its very modern electric motor.\", \"Anyone can buy the motor, known as the Eluminator e-Crate, for $3,900, but the pickup is a one-off. It was custom built to show enthusiasts they too can turn geriatric gas-guzzlers into efficient machines.\", \"Customers can buy it \\u201cto put in whatever car they want to build,\\u201d said Mark Rushbrook, global director of Ford performance motorsports. \\u201cClassic Mustangs or a Galaxy or F series truck \\u2014 they can buy the motor and install it.\\u201d\", \"Ford is not alone in imagining a future in which people swap the combustion engine in their car for an electric one. In 2019, General Motors tucked a 450-horsepower motor and other components from its Bolt E.V. inside a 1962 C-10 pickup; in 2020, General Motors put the e-crate it is developing into a 1977 K-5 Blazer.\", \"In London, where drivers of older gasoline-powered cars pay extra to drive in certain parts of the city, London Electric Cars, a specialist in bespoke conversions, keeps busy modifying cars that are 20 years or older with electric motors it buys from salvage yards.\", \"\\u201cLast year we finished an old school Mini. We put in a Nissan Leaf and the performance was unbelievable, so much above and beyond the petroleum engines,\\u201d said Barry Stephenson, a technician at the company. While a conversion isn\\u2019t cheap \\u2014 it costs between \\u00a325,000 and \\u00a350,000 (about $34,200 and $68,500), Mr. Stephenson said some customers are willing to make the investment, motivated by a desire to not contribute to the pollution and waste generated by the production of a new car.\", \"\\u201cA well-maintained used car can be made so that it is no longer consuming energy and creating pollution,\\u201d Mr. Stephenson said. \\u201cTo reuse and maintain them and enjoy them is really important to us.\\u201d\", \"Emission-free and mostly maintenance-free, E.V.s are also fun to drive, with rapid acceleration and smooth handling, said Pat McCue, whose company, MLe Racecars, worked with Ford on its F-100 truck modification. Converting to electric can also increase the life of the car, since many gas engine parts are no longer necessary and a lot of associated maintenance is eliminated.\", \"\\u201cIf you have half an open mind and you drive one of these cars around, you\\u2019re going to get out smiling,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople are going to get so used to the idea of the E.V. grin.\\u201d\", \"Generating buzz for electric cars, especially among hardcore devotees of combustion engines, is important to Ford, which has set a goal that 40 percent of its sales will be electric vehicles by 2030.\", \"With that in mind, souping up the F-100 was a tease, a way to generate enthusiasm, according to Phoebe Wall Howard, auto reporter for the Detroit Free Press. It may have worked too well. After the F-100 was revealed, tweets flooded the feed of the Ford chief executive Jim Farley, imploring him to turn the vehicle into a consumer product.\", \"\\u201cIt changed the passion level, using the F-100,\\u201d Ms. Howard said. \\u201cFord showed that if you buy the electric motor, you can take something you love from your childhood and go back to the future.\\u201d\", \"Putting electric motors where people don\\u2019t expect to find them is not confined to older cars. In motorsports, where innovations like disc brakes, airflow enhancing bodies, seatbelts and roll cages were tested before they hit the general consumer market, manufacturers are demonstrating electric racers.\", \"Formula-E is best known, with its international series of televised races, but electric racers are also seen on drag strips and in endurance competitions. In 2022, the National Hot Rod Association will hold its first series for all-electric vehicles. Even NASCAR is considering an exhibition series with electric cars, according to Sports Business Journal.\", \"\\u201cVery often when motorsports adopts something it broadens the adoption of it,\\u201d said Russ O\\u2019Blenes, G.M.\\u2019s director of performance and racing propulsion. With electric motor drag-racing expertise from Mr. McCue\\u2019s company, G.M. created the Chevrolet eCOPO Camaro and put it on a racetrack in 2018. It could deliver 700 horsepower and cover a quarter mile in 9 seconds. Even so, Mr. O\\u2019Blenes said some spectators weren\\u2019t ready for electric racing then. \\u201cNow, more and more people are interested.\\u201d\", \"When G.M.\\u2019s e-crate is released, it will be part of a complete implementation package including batteries and a computer management system. According to Mr. O\\u2019Blenes, the company feels this is the best way to ensure modifications are done safely. Ford\\u2019s e-crate, released earlier this month, is the motor only; buyers must acquire, design and install the ancillary components.\", \"Bozi Tatarevic, an automotive journalist, said that will not dissuade customers.\", \"\\u201cMost of these are done by enthusiasts,\\u201d he said, so the e-crate is a \\u201cfast pass\\u201d for those who want the ease of going to a dealer, buying the motor and putting it into a car.\", \"Ford says it will keep an eye on how the e-crate is being used by monitoring social media and other online forums; user feedback could influence future iterations of the motor and associated products. That\\u2019s because even though do-it-yourself modifiers are a small part of an automaker\\u2019s customer base, they are likely to be the company\\u2019s most technically-savvy customers, said John McDonald a former manager at G.M. who now runs Caeli Communication, a crisis and leadership consultancy firm.\", \"\\u201cThey deeply understand how you produce the product, why it is engineered the way it is,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re going to be very quick to give you feedback that is specific and actionable and that\\u2019s the feedback you want to get.\\u201d\", \"The speed at which battery technology and social media are coming together makes crowdsourcing an effective way to find innovators in the field. That is how Mr. McCue, who is also a high school teacher in Bothell, Wash., came to be the person both G.M. and Ford relied on for their showy concept E.V.s.\", \"Mr. McCue\\u2019s very first electric conversion came out of his automotive class at Bothell High School. The two-year effort got the attention of Foundry10, a Seattle-based philanthropic research program that studies methods of learning.\", \"With a grant from Foundry10, Mr. McCue\\u2019s next class project was an 800-volt electric dragster called Shock and Awe that at 166 miles per hour held the speed record for a car with doors until Ford\\u2019s electric Mustang Cobra 1400 beat it in 2020.\", \"\\u201cIn the electrification world, everything is so new and there aren\\u2019t established experts,\\u201d Mr. Rushbrook said, explaining how Ford decided to involve Mr. McCue, his brother, Peter, and the racecar driver Jeff Lane in the F-100 integration.\", \"Partnering with a high school teacher running a small company may be an unusual move for a major carmaker, but to Mike Geylin, editor in chief of EVReport.com, when technology is advancing quickly, expertise gets noticed.\", \"\\u201cOne thing the industry has learned slowly is \\u2018not invented here\\u2019 is a real quick way to go out of business,\\u201d Mr. Geylin said.\", \"When the automobile era began more than a century ago, most cars were powered by lead iron batteries or steam, not gas. \\u201cAs gas cars became more reliable and less cantankerous, when gas cars became more convenient to drive, they took over,\\u201d said Leslie Kendall, historian and curator at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. \\u201cIt\\u2019s happening in reverse now.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"97e936ca5c2411ecab85e70ea79a2518"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"97e936ca5c2411ecab85e70ea79a2518"}},
