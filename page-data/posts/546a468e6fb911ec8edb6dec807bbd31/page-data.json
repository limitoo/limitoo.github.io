But none \\u2014 not Jonathan Taylor, not Ezekiel Elliott, not Derrick Henry \\u2014 remind him of himself.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not saying that to be boastful,\\u201d Dickerson said. \\u201cNo one ran like I ran.\\u201d\", \"With a distinctive upright running style \\u2014 and wearing Rec Specs and a neck roll \\u2014 Dickerson rushed for 13,259 yards, mostly for the Rams and Colts. When he retired, in 1993, that total ranked second in N.F.L. history. It\\u2019s now good for ninth, but even three decades later, Dickerson, 61, still holds three significant records: No one has rushed for more yards as a rookie (1,808), in a playoff game (248) or in a single season (2,105).\", \"Dickerson, whose memoir, \\u201cWatch My Smoke,\\u201d comes out this month, discussed in a telephone interview why he thinks those records won\\u2019t fall for a while, if ever; the N.C.A.A.\\u2019s decision to allow college athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness; and whether he\\u2019ll let his son play tackle football.\", \"This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and condensed.\", \"Before Derrick Henry got hurt, did you think he would break your single-season rushing record? [Henry fell 78 yards short of the record in the 2020 season and had been expected to challenge it in 2021, with the addition of a 17th regular-season game to the N.F.L. schedule. Dickerson set the record in the 1984 season.]\", \"In all honesty, no. There\\u2019s just something about that record, I don\\u2019t know what it is. Maybe it\\u2019s supposed to last longer, or maybe my lifetime. I kept telling guys, a big part of it is you can\\u2019t fall behind, you can\\u2019t get hurt. I most definitely didn\\u2019t want to see Derrick Henry get hurt. I\\u2019d rather see him break my record all day long than get hurt. I just didn\\u2019t think he\\u2019d break it. I didn\\u2019t think Adrian Peterson would break it when he got close.\", \"Why not?\", \"When he was trying for it, I was at Toys \\u201cR\\u201d Us with my little girl. She was maybe 4 or 5, then. Jackie Slater calls me and he\\u2019s blowing my phone up like: \\u2018Man, you watching this game? What the hell you doing at Toys \\u201cR\\u201d Us, A.P.\\u2019s gonna get the record.\\u2019 I said, \\u2018He ain\\u2019t gonna get it.\\u2019 I just had a feeling. And sure enough, what did he wind up? Nine yards short? [Peterson finished 8 yards short in 2012.]\", \"The one I think is going to last is that 1,808, that rookie record. It\\u2019s so hard for a rookie to come in and do it.\", \"And you almost didn\\u2019t set the single-season mark because you got turf toe in Week 8.\", \"Oh, most definitely. I mean, my toe still bothers me to this day. I couldn\\u2019t walk on it at all. I couldn\\u2019t even touch it. Like a bedsheet, if it touched it, it was like dropping a book on it. Gary Tuthill, the trainer, was the one who came up with the idea for a toe piece. I still have my toe piece right here, two of them. It saved my career because I played with it my whole career. I could not play without it. A toe is a debilitating injury. People don\\u2019t realize. You don\\u2019t even think about a toe. But it\\u2019s a horrible injury if you have to put pressure on it, push off it being a running back or offensive lineman. You can\\u2019t do it.\", \"Have you imagined how different it would be if you played today, with the N.C.A.A. permitting college athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness?\", \"That\\u2019s way overdue. It\\u2019s sad because it should have been like that years ago. I think about myself. I think about guys before me that were poor Black kids that were just trying to help their family out, the little bit they could. Wasn\\u2019t like we were getting rich. They vilified you for it. They made you out to be a bad guy. But you come from nothing. You\\u2019re trying to help out a little bit with what you have as a talent.\", \"We didn\\u2019t have anything. I was trying to help my mother out. My dad died when I was 17 years old. For me, people think I made all this money at S.M.U. Come on, seriously. I got $1,000 a month. Sometimes it was $500. I was trying to help my mother out. She was an older lady still cleaning houses.\", \"[The N.C.A.A. levied against S.M.U. the so-called \\u201cdeath penalty,\\u201d canceling the football program for the 1988 season, after an investigation found repeated recruiting violations including facilitating payments to players.]\", \"Your passion for that transfers over to your advocacy for better health benefits for retired N.F.L. players, it feels like.\", \"Let me tell you something: The N.F.L. is another no-good entity. I bet if you talked to 100 players, I bet you 85 to 90 of them are going to say they hate the N.F.L. I just think that\\u2019s sad. I heard the other day from two guys. What\\u2019s ironic about it is these are white guys. They say the same thing that we Black guys say: They just want you to go somewhere and die. They don\\u2019t want to help you, they don\\u2019t give a damn about you.\", \"When we came up in the league, we had no health care. I was able to pay for my health care \\u2014 still am paying for my health care. But think about guys who can\\u2019t pay. I know one guy, Drew Hill. He passed away because he didn\\u2019t have enough money to pay for his high blood pressure medication.\", \"In your book, you discuss football\\u2019s impact on your body and brain. How are you doing?\", \"I have good days and bad days. I can\\u2019t sleep. Last time I had a really good night\\u2019s sleep was about three years ago and I slept on a plane going from L.A. to London. I can remember it, I remember very well. Sometimes I may sleep two hours, I may sleep four hours. I just went to a sleep apnea place to see if I have it. It\\u2019s horrible, man.\", \"I know for me, I won\\u2019t have a long life living like this, not being able to sleep. It just won\\u2019t happen. People ask would I do it all over again if I knew what would happen. Yeah, I would do it and I\\u2019d do it for one reason: My mom. I\\u2019d do it for Viola Dickerson. It gave my mother and my family a life they never would have had. And me, too.\", \"Are you at all concerned that you have chronic traumatic encephalopathy (C.T.E.)?\", \"I mean, I\\u2019m sure. I know I do, some form of it. Not advanced yet. But sometimes I have a short fuse and sometimes I don\\u2019t. Something small, like a guy blows a horn at me, and man, my insides go ballistic. I mean, I\\u2019ll go crazy. Like, crazy crazy. We guys talk about that, how you have that short fuse. That\\u2019s the football, the aggressiveness. I\\u2019ll get real aggressive. I don\\u2019t like that. I don\\u2019t like to act like that. Because once I start, I can\\u2019t stop. It\\u2019s almost embarrassing, it\\u2019s uncontrollable. It\\u2019s almost like the Incredible Hulk. I cannot control myself. I don\\u2019t care if the pope was here, I\\u2019m going to curse and go ballistic. And I don\\u2019t like to act like that.\", \"Knowing what you do, will you let your son play tackle football?\", \"Well, he\\u2019s 9 years old, and he plays flag football. I\\u2019ve talked to him about football. I said: \\u2018Listen, you\\u2019re playing flag. There\\u2019s going to come a point where it\\u2019s tackle.\\u2019 He says, \\u2018Dad, I understand.\\u2019 I said: \\u2018No, there\\u2019s going to be hits and tackling. It\\u2019s going to be more physical.\\u2019 If he wants to play, would I let him play? Yeah, probably. I would. I wouldn\\u2019t want to stop him. But I want to give him everything he has to work with to know how dangerous that sport is.\"]","href_hash":"546a468e6fb911ec8edb6dec807bbd31"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"546a468e6fb911ec8edb6dec807bbd31"}},
