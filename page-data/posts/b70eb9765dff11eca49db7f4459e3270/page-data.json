However, alarmed by the involvement of veterans and military service members in the assault on the Capitol, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered a one-day stand down in the spring to discuss extremism and subsequently formed the Counter Extremism Working Group. It has been tasked with updating the Pentagon's definition of extremist activity and adding training on extremist groups that might try to recruit former service members, as well as transition checklists for those leaving military service.
