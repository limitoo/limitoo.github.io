Many more are stranded on floodplain islands with no way to leave except by boat or helicopter, possibly until after Christmas.\", \"And with a second year of the weather phenomenon known as La Ni\\u00f1a in full swing, meteorologists are predicting even more flooding for Australia\\u2019s east coast, adding to the stress from the pandemic and a recent rural mouse plague of biblical proportions.\", \"Quotable: \\u201cIt feels constant,\\u201d said Brett Dickinson, a 58-year-old wheat farmer who lives in northwest New South Wales, about a six-hour drive from Sydney. \\u201cWe\\u2019re constantly battling all the elements \\u2014 and the animals, too.\\u201d\", \"Related: The planet is getting its own \\u201cblack box\\u201d in case climate change destroys humanity.

The unit, Talon Anvil, pinpointed targets for airstrikes, including convoys, car bombs and command centers.\", \"But the small, shadowy force \\u2014 at times fewer than 20 people \\u2014 sidestepped safeguards, alarmed its military partners and repeatedly killed civilians, a Times investigation found. Senior C.I.A. officers complained to Special Operations leaders about the disturbing pattern of strikes.\", \"Details: The U.S. military billed the air war against the Islamic State as the most precise and humane in military history. It said strict rules and oversight by top leaders kept civilian deaths to a minimum. In reality, the majority of strikes were ordered not by top leaders but by relatively low-ranking commandos in Talon Anvil.\", \"Background: The Times reported last month that a bombing carried out by Talon Anvil in 2019 killed dozens of women and children, and that the aftermath was concealed from the public and top military leaders. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered a high-level investigation into the strike. People who saw the unit operate firsthand said it was part of a pattern of reckless strikes that started years earlier.\", \"President Jovenel Mo\\u00efse was about to name names when he was assassinated in July.

The Times interviewed more than 70 people to understand what happened in the last seven months of the president\\u2019s life.\", \"He had ordered his staff to be ruthless, even with the power brokers who had helped propel him into office. Mo\\u00efse had known several of them for years, and they felt betrayed by his turn against them, his aides say.\", \"Details: His wife, Martine Mo\\u00efse, described how gunmen stayed to search the room after they shot him, hurriedly digging through files.

But plans are in the works to change the building before the planned reopening in 2024.\", \"On Thursday, the latest in a series of controversies around the renovation unfolded when the National Heritage and Architecture Commission of France approved proposals to modernize the interior. New lighting and contemporary art will be installed, and the cathedral will rearrange its furniture.\", \"Proponents say the proposals will create a conversation across centuries and allow for an easier and more pleasant visit. But critics argue that the changes will disfigure the 850-year-old cathedral and disturb the harmony of its Gothic design.
