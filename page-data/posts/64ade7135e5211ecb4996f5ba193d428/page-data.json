Our clients felt the exact same way after dinner was over\\\".\", \"\\\"It was a beautiful moment and one I'll never forget.\\\"\", \"The money, which included extra donations from people on social media,\\u00a0 was supposed to be split between Brandt and the other servers who waited on the party. But Brandt's manager said it needed to be split between the bartenders, cooks and food runners as well. Brandt's lawyer, Bill Horton told The Washington Post that had never happened before but she split the tip anyway.\", \"The trouble started when she reached out to Wise to thank him and told him about the tip being split, Horton said. Wise called Oven & Tap and told them he wanted Brandt and the other servers to receive the entire tip, which the restaurant agreed to do.\", \"But Horton said Brandt was fired for telling Wise about it.\", \"Oven & Tap told The Washington Post, via a public relations company, the restaurant normally takes a cut of servers' credit card tips and splits them among other workers. President and chief executive of the firm representing the restaurant, Natalie Ghidotti said cash tips are given to servers in their entirety.\", \"Ghidotti said the restaurant splits tips for large groups on a case by case basis.\", \"She said the restaurant \\\"immediately honoured\\\" Wise's request. She confirmed Brandt was let go but wouldn't reveal why.\", \"Oven & Tap also sent Brandt a cease and desist letter claiming she has permanently damaged the restaurant's reputation. It comes after it was flooded with negative reviews and comments online.\", \"Wise started a GoFundMe page for Brandt after she was fired which has raised more than $8000.\"]","href_hash":"64ade7135e5211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"64ade7135e5211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
