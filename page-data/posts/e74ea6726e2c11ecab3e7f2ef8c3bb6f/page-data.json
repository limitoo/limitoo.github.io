Why do so many other kids want to watch?","country":"us","create_time":"2022-01-05T13:40:41.000Z","content":"[\"Over the protests of my fellow concerned parents, I want to admit something: I don\\u2019t care all that much about screen time, the great child-rearing panic of the 21st century. So many of us have come to believe that if our children spend more than a certain amount of time staring at a screen, whether television, phone or iPad, they will succumb to some capitalist plot to turn them all into little consumption monsters with insatiable appetites for toys, sugar, more screen time. This seems absurd to me, but as the father of a 4-year-old, I have not been immune to screen-time shaming \\u2014 it upsets me to see my child watching a vapid show like \\u201cPaw Patrol\\u201d on our iPad. These moments of protest usually come, it should be noted, when I\\u2019m sitting beside her, staring at my own phone, scrolling through Twitter.\", \"\\u201cThis show is dumb,\\u201d I\\u2019ll sometimes say. She almost always ignores me. Her stony silence then prompts me to try to think of a show that\\u2019s not dumb, which is an impossible task \\u2014 because what kids\\u2019 programming isn\\u2019t dumb?\", \"For the last two years, her favorite show has been \\u201cOctonauts,\\u201d about a diverse band of animals who explore the oceans and swamplands in vessels called GUPs. They help whales and eels and flamingos in need. What\\u2019s left unsaid, but certainly seems clear enough to me, is that the Octonauts have colonized the Vegimals, a species of squeaking underwater creatures who all resemble one sort of vegetable or another. The Vegimals\\u2019 oppression does not register with my daughter, who has watched every \\u201cOctonauts\\u201d episode multiple times, owns a small fortune in toy GUPs and goes to her preschool dressed in a sweater with Kwaazi, an incorrigible pirate cat, knit across the front. I have not yet talked to her about how the Vegimals are portrayed as infantile, loyal beings who love to bake kelp cakes all day, but I plan on doing so soon.\", \"What effect do all these television shows have on the developing brain of a 4-year-old? I don\\u2019t honestly know, but I try not to worry too much about it. Life is long and full of different stimuli. I spent most of my preteen years reading horny fantasy books by Piers Anthony and the science fiction of L. Ron Hubbard. The \\u201cgood\\u201d books I read mostly involved warrior mice who were probably also colonialists. I\\u2019m fine now. A wary ambivalence seems like the most healthful way to go.\", \"There is one type of video I refuse to let my daughter watch: toy videos. Parents with kids of a certain age will certainly know what I\\u2019m talking about here, but for the rest, a toy video is an internet genre, usually found on YouTube, that features someone playing with another plastic monstrosity, often one with tie-ins to \\u201cPaw Patrol.\\u201d The genre has spawned many toy-video variants: Some feature adults; others, kids. Some have even been deliberately packaged to hide their true content from concerned, but perhaps less than vigilant, parents.\", \"On occasion, especially on long drives, I\\u2019ll hand my daughter the iPad. She watches \\u201cPeppa Pig,\\u201d which I, of course, hate \\u2014 those British pigs with their phallic noses prattling on about nothing. Invariably, after about 20 minutes or so, I\\u2019ll look back and see her, still strapped into her car seat, brow furrowed, jabbing at the screen with her finger. Then I\\u2019ll hear the same high-pitched nonsense, but in a much worse British accent, and know she has switched from Peppa proper to a video of some adult with Peppa toys who, for God knows what reason, is re-enacting a scene in which Peppa and her brother, George, go jump in muddy puddles or whatever.\", \"\\u201cNo!\\u201d I yell.\", \"My daughter then looks up, annoyed.\", \"There\\u2019s no real logic to this, of course. What\\u2019s the difference between watching the Anglophone silliness of Peppa, a show that exists only to sell toys, and a video of someone playing with the toys themselves?\", \"Until recently, my daughter and I were somehow able to avoid the king of toy videos: Ryan Kaji. There\\u2019s no one way to describe what Kaji, who is now 10 years old, has done across his multiple YouTube channels, cable television shows and live appearances: In one video, he is giving you a tour of the Legoland Hotel; in another, he splashes around in his pool to introduce a science video about tsunamis. But for years, what he has mostly done is play with toys: Thomas the Tank Engine, \\u201cPaw Patrol\\u201d figures, McDonald\\u2019s play kitchens. A new toy and a new video for almost every day of the week, adding up to an avalanche of content that can overwhelm your child\\u2019s brain, click after click.\", \"Kaji has been playing with toys on camera since Barack Obama was in the White House. Here are a few of the companies that are now paying him handsomely for his services: Amazon, Walmart, Nickelodeon, Skechers. Ryan also has 10 separate YouTube channels, which together make up \\u201cRyan\\u2019s World,\\u201d a content behemoth whose branded merchandise took in more than $250 million last year. Even conservative estimates suggest that the Kaji family take exceeds $25 million annually. But we\\u2019re a full decade into being stunned by YouTuber incomes, and I\\u2019m not sure these numbers should be alarming, or even surprising.\", \"Ryan\\u2019s parents, Shion and Loann Kaji, met while they were undergraduates at Texas Tech University. Shion, the son of a microchip executive, moved to the United States from Japan when he was in high school and still speaks with a slight accent. Loann\\u2019s family escaped Vietnam on a boat and shuttled through refugee camps in Malaysia and Singapore before they made it to the United States; she grew up in Houston wanting to be a teacher. After college, Shion left to get his master\\u2019s in engineering at Cornell, but he returned to Texas within a year, after Ryan was born. (He would complete his master\\u2019s degree online.) They moved in together and began the uncertain and difficult work of trying to piece a family together.\", \"Which is all to say, these aren\\u2019t your stereotypical parents of a child star, who, frustrated with their own crashed Hollywood dreams, put their kid through singing and dancing lessons in the living room of a bungalow in Van Nuys. But neither are they just an adorable couple who stumbled into fame and fortune. They\\u2019re much cannier than that.\", \"In his first-ever video, Ryan Kaji, then just 3, squats on the floor of the toy aisle at Target. He looks very cute, doe-eyed with a Beatles mop cut. He\\u2019s being filmed by Loann. \\u201cHi, Ryan,\\u201d she says brightly.\", \"\\u201cHi, Mommy,\\u201d Ryan says.\", \"\\u201cWhat you want today?\\u201d Loann asks. \\u201cWhat is your pick of the week?\\u201d\", \"Ryan stands up and picks out a \\u201cLego choo-choo train.\\u201d He does seem precocious, but not obnoxious \\u2014 he doesn\\u2019t rattle off factorials or sing \\u201cOver the Rainbow\\u201d or \\u201cTangled Up in Blue\\u201d or anything like that. Just a 3-year-old who seems a little advanced for his age, especially when it comes to expressing himself. There\\u2019s little that distinguishes this video from the millions of other family videos on YouTube, and Loann herself says she didn\\u2019t really expect anything to come from it other than something to share with her son\\u2019s grandparents. If you\\u2019re being uncharitable, you might note how \\u201cpick of the week\\u201d seems to suggest a plan for unending content.\", \"Shion saw no issue with it \\u2014 why would he? \\u2014 but he worried about the cost of buying toys nonstop for Ryan to play with on YouTube. And so the young couple agreed to allocate $20 a week in production costs, toys included. Loann would film everything on her phone and edit the videos on her laptop.\", \"At the time, Ryan was watching a lot of YouTube shows. His favorites were \\u201cEvanTubeHD\\u201d and \\u201cHulyan and Maya,\\u201d each of which served as inspiration. Children\\u2019s content on YouTube tends to be derivative in this way. Once a specific toy or activity becomes popular, copycats emerge, knowing that algorithms will pick up and spread their version of \\u201cSlime Time\\u201d or what have you. A result is a self-referential world where thousands of children do the exact same thing on thousands of separate channels.\", \"When Ryan was getting started, one of the most popular and copied trends involved a giant papier-m\\u00e2ch\\u00e9 egg filled with toys. Loann says Ryan wanted to do a giant-egg video, but this would have broken the weekly budget. Loann improvised. She had a lot of old toys based on the movie \\u201cCars\\u201d lying around, which she stuffed into the requisite papier-m\\u00e2ch\\u00e9 egg. In the video, Loann wakes Ryan up from a pretend nap. He seems genuinely surprised and begins smacking away at the egg with an inflatable toy. Then he begins pulling some clearly used toys out of the egg and feigning great surprise. The video currently has over a billion views.\", \"The giant egg was Ryan\\u2019s breakthrough. His channel\\u2019s audience began growing at an explosive rate, which then placed pressure on Loann to keep feeding her son\\u2019s new fans. \\u201cI was worried,\\u201d Shion says. \\u201cEvery time I looked at other YouTubers, I didn\\u2019t see the huge growth that we were seeing over a short period of time.\\u201d That growth wasn\\u2019t just limited to the United States; Ryan was becoming popular in Asia, as well. \\u201cI was concerned about how much we could keep doing this without putting too much pressure on Ryan.\\u201d\", \"Virality is mostly luck: A teenager does a dance on TikTok, and suddenly every middle- and high-school kid has seen it, and before you know it, the dancer has 100 million followers and 15 separate sponsorship deals. Some critics will divine great importance from the tiniest of details and build a theory about what the kids really want, but there\\u2019s usually nothing outside the brutal logic of algorithms and the insatiable appetites of children.\", \"When Ryan\\u2019s egg video went viral, Loann saw an opportunity to make some extra income, though she didn\\u2019t know all that much about monetizing videos. Their first paycheck from YouTube was for about $150. At the time, Shion was still working as a structural engineer, and while he wanted to help Loann, who had a job as a teacher, someone needed to earn a steady salary.\", \"But after about a year of continued growth and bigger paychecks from YouTube, Shion and Loann both realized that they needed to commit fully to influencer life or risk squandering Ryan\\u2019s rare gift. They wanted the core of their channel, at the time called Ryan\\u2019s Toys Review, to remain the same \\u2014 Ryan playing with the toys he liked, from \\u201cCars\\u201d and \\u201cThomas & Friends\\u201d \\u2014 but they needed help. So they hired a couple of editors and started a production company, Sunlight Entertainment. Loann, who was pregnant at the time with twin girls \\u2014 Emma and Katie, who are now 5 years old and appear frequently in Ryan\\u2019s videos \\u2014 finally quit teaching to become a full-time YouTube mom.\", \"Shion held out a little longer, but he, too, eventually left his job to manage his son\\u2019s business. \\u201cI started to feel like I was the dead weight in the family,\\u201d Shion told me. Ryan needed full support from both parents. \\u201cSo that\\u2019s when I realized, OK, we need to kind of step back, and we have to see how we can support Ryan in his branding.\\u201d\", \"Shion and Loann noticed that a lot of kid YouTube channels were focused more on the brand of the toy than on the brand of the talent. They were, in plainer terms, just adding \\u201cThomas the Train\\u201d to their titles and hoping that other kids who wanted to consume every single video about Thomas the Tank Engine would stumble upon their content. Shion thought this was backward. Ryan, not the toys, should be the brand. Shion was proposing an interesting evolution: Given Ryan\\u2019s popularity, why couldn\\u2019t he create his own brands, his own characters, his own toys? Why help Thomas when you can create your own universe of characters, diversify your content streams, ramp up merchandising and license your content to some of the biggest platforms in the world? \\u201cPeople are watching Ryan, not the toy he\\u2019s showing,\\u201d Shion says. \\u201cSo, oftentimes, we create a new original, animated character that\\u2019s inspired by Ryan.\\u201d\", \"Today, Ryan\\u2019s World includes the separate channels \\u201cCombo Panda,\\u201d \\u201cRyan\\u2019s World Espa\\u00f1ol\\u201d and \\u201cGus the Gummy Gator.\\u201d Ryan doesn\\u2019t put in extensive appearances in all these videos; sometimes he just gives a short introduction. In one recent video, the action starts with Ryan in his backyard holding a rubber ball. He tosses it halfheartedly in the air, watches it bounce and then says that Peck and Combo \\u2014 two of the cartoon characters in Ryan\\u2019s World \\u2014 are going to teach viewers about gravity. He\\u2019s on camera for all of 35 seconds.\", \"Loann and Shion say that cameos like this are their way of limiting the amount of time Ryan needs to be on camera, which is their main concern these days. Still, there\\u2019s little doubt that he has spent most of his childhood being captured on video. Many of these appearances are banal; some are of dubious taste, like \\u201cRyan\\u2019s First Business-Class Airplane Ride to Japan.\\u201d Others are just more videos of a cute kid playing with toys. Right now, as I am typing this, the latest entry in the Ryan\\u2019s World feed is an hourlong video in which Ryan is present for a vast majority of the screen time. He gives a few scientific facts about the strength of spiders, plays with some toys and is his usual, charming self, all while wearing a Ryan\\u2019s World T-shirt.\", \"In 2017, the Kajis established a partnership with Pocket.watch, a licensing company headed by a former executive from the Walt Disney Company. Pocket.watch handles the Ryan\\u2019s World franchise, including the deals with Walmart, Amazon and Skechers. But even as the family enterprise was expanding, Shion says, most viewers at that time still wanted to see Ryan play with familiar toys. So, Ryan continued to do \\u2014 and generate a great deal of revenue from \\u2014 what he had always done: picking up a popular toy and playing with it on camera. In 2019, Truth in Advertising, a consumer watchdog group, filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission, accusing the Kajis of \\u201cdeceiving millions of young children\\u201d by not adequately disclosing their advertisers. (A spokeswoman for the family said that they \\u201cstrictly follow all platforms\\u2019 terms of service and all existing laws and regulations, including advertising-disclosure requirements.\\u201d) The brand, which has continued to profit from sponsored content on its YouTube channels, also makes money from its line of Ryan\\u2019s World toys, multiple deals with streaming networks and licensing deals.\", \"Today, Sunshine Entertainment, the production company Shion and Loann created, has 30 employees. And the Kajis have traded Houston for Hawaii. When I asked Loann why they moved, she said, \\u201cWell, I always wanted to live in Hawaii, and now that we can afford it, we thought, Why don\\u2019t we just do it?\\u201d\", \"Last summer, I traveled with my daughter to Simi Valley, Calif., for a taping of the Nickelodeon show \\u201cRyan\\u2019s Mystery Playdate,\\u201d a half-hour-long, professionally produced recapitulation of many of the motifs from Ryan\\u2019s YouTube videos. The night before the shoot, I asked my daughter to watch an old episode of the show on our iPad. She didn\\u2019t seem particularly interested at first, but when I moved to turn it off, she slapped my hand away and said she liked Ryan. Which didn\\u2019t surprise me \\u2014 why wouldn\\u2019t she like him? But I admit I did feel slightly disappointed. Over the next few days, I had her sample a bit more from the Ryan Kaji media empire: A science lesson in which Ryan and his little twin sisters mix baking soda and vinegar; a game of tag played between Loann and Ryan; and the giant-egg video that started it all. She, of course, liked the egg the best.\", \"The Nickelodeon shoot was at a remote studio lot that had been made up to resemble a boulevard, with long stretches of building facades that somehow evoked historic Boston and the Wild West at the same time. Crew members in masks and plastic face shields were standing around the set, waiting for the talent to arrive. The Kajis\\u2019 tight schedule and their desire to spend as much time as possible in Hawaii means that Ryan flies to Los Angeles, films a season\\u2019s worth of shows, then heads right back home.\", \"The conceit of \\u201cRyan\\u2019s Mystery Playdate\\u201d is relatively simple. Ryan, Shion and Loann play a game. Ryan generally wins. Shion usually loses. Loann wins some and loses some, but she mostly hovers as a positive, encouraging presence. At some point, the mystery play date arrives. Today\\u2019s two guests were the Pie Ninja, who throws pies, and Major Mess, a burly military man who loves to make messes.\", \"A blast of cheery music sounded, then a round of recorded applause. Ryan emerged from a door wearing a pair of polarized sunglasses. Next came Loann and Shion, dressed in brightly colored jumpsuits, followed by a couple of production assistants who carried water and clipboards. The first contest was a simple memory-based matching game. Whoever missed got a pie in the face from the Pie Ninja. Before shooting started, however, Shion and the director on the set had to negotiate whether Shion would be hit with one or two pies. Shion said he didn\\u2019t really have any problem with two pies, which pleased the director.\", \"When the filming started, Ryan kept the scene together as Loann and Shion repeatedly forgot their lines. This, Loann would tell me later, is how nearly all these shoots go. Ryan rarely makes mistakes, nor does his positive attitude waver much. He spends a majority of \\u201cMystery Playdate\\u201d with an amazed, gape-mouthed look on his face.\", \"Watching the Kajis coming together as a family to play these games reminded me of a moment from high school, when I was driving around town with a couple of classmates I didn\\u2019t know particularly well. One of them, an exemplary student who did things like run for student council, divulged that she and her parents played board games together once a week. This seemed absolutely insane to me, but I didn\\u2019t say anything about it, because you never know if your family\\u2019s dysfunction is atypical or if everyone else is just lying about their happy lives. I pictured this classmate seated on the floor of a living room, one much bigger than mine, playing Parcheesi with her bookish parents. This image persisted, and for the next year, I felt a great deal of hostility toward her. Today I play games with my daughter almost every night, but I suppose there\\u2019s still part of me that thinks about that happy family and still cannot fathom how such things could ever be possible.\", \"Why do children want to watch happy children playing with toys they can\\u2019t have? Are they responding to the toys or to the images of a happy family? Are they envisioning a life they already feel may be out of reach? And at what age does aspiration turn into resentment? I imagine my daughter will grow tired of these toy videos when she learns to feel real jealousy, which I suppose is a good reason to hope she just keeps watching them.\", \"And yet there\\u2019s something a bit unsatisfying about this explanation. Because if it were true that children just want to watch other children doing the things they most want to do, the most popular videos would show kids watching \\u201cPaw Patrol\\u201d on an iPad. The Kaji empire and its thousands of imitators, oddly enough, have created perhaps the only world in which children do not stare at screens. It\\u2019s a nice dream, I admit, but not to the extent of persuading me to allow my daughter to keep watching videos. The limits we set as parents may be arbitrary, but they are all we\\u2019ve got.\", \"Ryan\\u2019s life, despite its fictional presentation as a parade of remarkable discoveries that he shares with his enthusiastic parents, may not be all that different from my daughter\\u2019s. During the shoot in Simi Valley, after a long stretch of filming in the intense sun, I overheard a crew member say to him, \\u201cIf you finish this scene, you can play Minecraft.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e74ea6726e2c11ecab3e7f2ef8c3bb6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e74ea6726e2c11ecab3e7f2ef8c3bb6f"}},
