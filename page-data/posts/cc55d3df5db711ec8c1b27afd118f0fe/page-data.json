Adam Kinzinger (R-IL) was the only GOP representative to back the Democrats in the House vote that passed 221-209, pushing the legislation to President Joe Biden to sign.\", \"The passage follows months of wrangling between the parties with Senate Republicans opposing any action by Democrats to raise or suspend the nation's borrowing limit. A deal between McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) ended the GOP's threats to filibuster a borrowing limit hike.\", \"It meant that last week, 14 Republican Senators joined every Democrat in the evenly split upper house to allow a one-time vote to lift the debt ceiling with a simple majority.\", \"The Senate voted on Tuesday along party lines to raise the debt ceiling on Tuesday 50-49 after Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) missed the votes, before it was passed by the House.\", \"While raising the debt ceiling is usually a bipartisan vote, Republicans wanted the Democrats to do it on their own as they try to pass the $1.75 trillion Build Back Better Act.\", \"Ex-President Donald Trump has also criticized McConnell's handling of the debt ceiling. Last month, Trump called on McConnell to \\\"be fully prepared to use the DEBT CEILING in order to totally kill the Democrat's new Social Spending (Wasting!) Bill, which will change our Country forever.\\\"\", \"Raising the debt limit does not mean there will be new government spending but like a credit card, simply allows the Treasury Department to continue to pay off the nation's bills.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952245/marjorie-taylor-greene-mitch-mcconnell.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">GOP Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (left) has criticized Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell over the debt ceiling vote.
