The union plans to file a lawsuit against the mandate, a move that the police union tried back in October and failed.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943531/bill-de-blasio-corrections-officers-vaccine-mandate.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Mayor Bill de Blasio expects more corrections officers to become fully vaccinated as they start to miss paychecks and exemptions are refused.

Resignations and retirements have piled up, and guards are continuing to work round-the-clock shifts, with no time for meals or rest, Boscio said.\", \"Suspending jail workers over the vaccine mandate could be deadly, the union chief warned.\", \"\\\"To move forward with placing what little staff we do have on leave tomorrow would be like pouring gasoline on a fire, which will have a catastrophic impact on the safety of our officers and the thousands of inmates in our custody,\\\" Boscio said Tuesday.\", \"The promised suspensions threaten to add to the problems at the city's jails, which includes the notorious Rikers Island complex. The jails, rotted by years of neglect, have spiraled out of control during the pandemic with staggering violence, self-harm and the deaths this year of at least 14 inmates \\u2014 the most since 2013.\", \"The troubles have led to growing calls to overhaul or immediately close Rikers Island, which the city has said will be shuttered by 2027. The city on Tuesday announced it had awarded contracts for work on new jails in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx.\", \"Last week, members of the House Oversight Committee, including New York Representatives Carolyn Maloney and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, sent letters to New York City district attorneys expressing \\\"grave concerns\\\" that excessive bail amounts were putting too many people in jail.\", \"At the same time, staffing levels have dropped sharply during the pandemic. Uniformed personnel fell from a staff of 10,862 in 2017 to 8,388 in 2021. At one point in the summer, one-third of guards were out sick or medically unfit to work with inmates and an untold number of guards went AWOL, the city said.\", \"The vaccine mandate for jail workers is taking effect as scientists are racing to learn more about the Omicron variant, which was identified last week by researchers in South Africa. No cases have been detected in the United States, though de Blasio said he believes it's \\\"very likely\\\" there will eventually be cases reported in New York City.\", \"De Blasio announced an additional vaccine mandate Monday for child care workers, reiterating his commitment to the mandates he's unveiled for almost the city's entire municipal workforce in recent months.\", \"The Department of Correction said it held town halls, called employees and gave them literature to encourage them to get vaccinated. It also offered a $500 bonus, parked a truck displaying a pro-vaccine message on a digital billboard at Rikers Island and recruited Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, author Piper Kerman and former New York Mets player Mookie Wilson to tape messages for the department encouraging workers to get the shots.\", \"The campaign has moved the needle, with Monday's 77 percent vaccination total among jail workers up from 72 percent a week earlier and 46 percent in late October when the mandate was announced. Still, at all other city agencies, at least 86 percent of workers have received at least one vaccine dose\\u2014and most agencies were reporting vaccination rates above 90 percent as of Monday.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943535/department-corrections-vaccine-mandate-new-york.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">As of 5 p.m. Monday, New York City's Department of Corrections said that 77 percent of staff had received at least one dose of the vaccine.
