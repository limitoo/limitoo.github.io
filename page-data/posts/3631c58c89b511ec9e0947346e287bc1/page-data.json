The Parental Rights in Education bill, commonly referred to the \\\"Don't Say Gay\\\" bill by its critics, would apply to such topics in primary grade levels, as well as in cases where the discussions are deemed \\\"not age-appropriate.\\\"\", \"The bill, proposed by Republican State Senator Dennis Baxley, would extend to student support services, including counseling, and would require school district personnel to give parents all information related to a student's \\\"mental, emotional or physical health or well-being,\\\" unless it's believed that such disclosure would result in abuse. Parents would be able to sue districts that do not follow these requirements.\", \"The bill's purpose, according to its text, is to \\\"reinforce the fundamental right of parents to make decisions regarding the upbringing and control of their children.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"If Florida legislators pass the bill, it would go into effect on July 1, with all school district plans having to be updated by June 30, 2023.\\u00a0\", \"Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who supports the bill, said at a roundtable in Miami on Monday that he doesn't approve of \\\"injecting these concepts about choosing your gender\\\" at schools.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We've seen instances of students being told by different folks in school, 'Oh, don't worry. Don't pick your gender yet. Do all this other stuff.' They won't tell the parents about these discussions that are happening,\\\" DeSantis said. \\\"That is entirely inappropriate. Schools need to be teaching kids to read, to write. They need to them them science, history.
