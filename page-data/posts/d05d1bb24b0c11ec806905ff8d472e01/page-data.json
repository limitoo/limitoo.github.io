On Thursday, the country also reported its highest single-day surge in cases at 65,371 new infections.\", \"Weekly infections now stand at more than 362 per 100,000 people, while the peak during last year's lockdown was just above 197. In some parts of the country, infection rates have soared past 1,000 per day, causing intensive care units to reach capacity and hospitals to become overwhelmed, Reuters reported.\", \"The situation has gotten so dire that Bavaria implemented a statewide lockdown on Friday, closing bars and clubs for at least three weeks and canceling this year's Christmas markets due to virus transmission.\", \"Thomas Bareiss, Germany's tourism commissioner under Merkel, said Sunday that rising infection rates make it clear that compulsory vaccinations for the public will soon be \\\"unavoidable.\\\"\", \"\\\"For me it is politically no longer justifiable that entire industries, retailers, restaurants, clubs, bars and the entire cinema, cultural and event scene live in a state of crisis prescribed by the state for 20 months and are faced with great existential fears, while others...take the freedom not to vaccinate,\\\" Bareiss said, per Sky News. \", \"Daniel Gunther, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) minister president of the Schleswig-Holstein state, also echoed those concerns. He told German media that he would now be prepared to introduce vaccinations requirements for the public.\", \"Other politicians, including Bavarian State Premier Markus Soeder, called for a quick decision to make COVID-19 vaccinations compulsory throughout the country. Danyal Bayaz, a member of the Greens and Finance Minister in Baden-Wuerttemberg added that it would be a \\\"mistake\\\" to rule out a mandatory requirement as infections soar across the nation, Reuters reported.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937279/germany-covid-19-vaccine-mandate.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Several politicians in Germany have said they support mandated vaccines for the general public amid a wave of new infections across the country.

It is the first European country to require all of its citizens to be vaccinated by law.\", \"\\\"We have not managed to get enough unvaccinated people to get vaccinated. The most recent measures have increased daily vaccinations but not enough,\\\" Schallenberg told reporters on Friday. \\\"For a long time, it was consensus in the country that a vaccine mandate is not necessary, but we have to face reality.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"d05d1bb24b0c11ec806905ff8d472e01"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d05d1bb24b0c11ec806905ff8d472e01"}},
