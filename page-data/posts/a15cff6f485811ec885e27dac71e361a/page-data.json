Perusing the offerings, I\\u2019m reminded of an inelegantly named but beloved stromboli restaurant in New Brunswick, N.J., known as Stuff Yer Face. (To be clear, I support the sentiment, not the misspelling.)\", \"Let\\u2019s begin at the top of the advice, how-to and miscellaneous list, where Ree Drummond\\u2019s \\u201cThe Pioneer Woman Cooks Super Easy!\\u201d has been perched for four weeks. Immediately following a table of contents featuring Festive Brie Bites, Stepped-Up Sausage Balls and Pantry Pizza Pronto, the self-proclaimed \\u201caccidental country girl\\u201d re-enacts the cover of her first book, \\u201cThe Pioneer Woman Cooks.\\u201d The offspring crowded around her kitchen counter are taller than they were 12 years ago, and the Dutch oven in Drummond\\u2019s hands is now green instead of red, but our titian-haired hostess still has a familiar twinkle that says, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to serve you the chicken fried steak of your dreams.\\u201d Luckily for lazy chefs, her message is one of convenience. Life is too short not to opt for frozen dough, microwaveable rice and Cool Whip.\", \"Speaking of not sweating the small stuff: Tabitha Brown\\u2019s \\u201cFeeding the Soul\\u201d just enjoyed a six-week run as a best seller. The TikTok star shares recipes for vegan fish sticks, tuna melts and pulled pork, but the real goal of her book is to nourish confidence; after all, Brown writes, \\u201cToo many people leave this world without ever letting their brilliance and creativity see the light of day.\\u201d Drew Barrymore also gets in on the you-do-you game with \\u201cRebel Homemaker,\\u201d which recently touched down for one week on the advice, how-to and miscellaneous list. In search of a recipe for Autumn Hug in a Bowl? Look no further. As the actress puts it in a manifesto at the front of the book, \\u201cI have heard comfort food is through the roof. Everyone is looking to soothe.\\u201d\", \"The gastronomic theme also extends to the middle grade hardcover list, where \\\"The Complete Cookbook for Young Chefs,\\u201d \\u201cThe Complete Baking Book for Young Chefs\\u201d and \\u201cThe Official Harry Potter Baking Book\\u201d are holding their own. And let\\u2019s not forget \\u201cDragons Love Tacos,\\u201d which continues its 334-week streak on the picture book list. Yes, I am aware that it doesn\\u2019t include recipes, but a story celebrating the crunch of crispy tortillas certainly deserves an honorable mention on my food tour.\"]","href_hash":"a15cff6f485811ec885e27dac71e361a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a15cff6f485811ec885e27dac71e361a"}},
