Because I think that\\u2019s the best possible school for someone who wants to become a writer.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cEssays Two,\\u201d Lydia Davis\\u2019s new collection of 19 pieces on translation and the learning of languages, all written over the past two decades, offers overwhelming proof of the benefits to a writer of a practice of translation. This claim makes \\u201cEssays Two\\u201d sound like a book that will delight only philologists and polyglots when, in fact, readers with no interest in translation, little taste for essays and zero desire to become writers will nonetheless find themselves burning through its 571 pages with equal parts confusion (What on earth is happening to me?) and relief (Thank God this is happening to me!), and, finally, recognition that the mind we\\u2019re meeting on the page is awake to the world in ways that feel necessary and new. \\u201cEssays Two\\u201d joins \\u201cEssays One\\u201d (2019), Davis\\u2019s collection of 35 pieces on writers and writing, the two volumes conspiring to a singular astonishment of pleasures.\", \"Since Davis began publishing stories in the 1970s, a career commemorated in 2009 with the publication of her 700-page \\u201cCollected Stories,\\u201d a book that argued for her lasting place in American letters, she has had a parallel career as a translator. Davis has brought two dozen French authors into English, some in a mode of advocacy (Dani\\u00e8le Sallenave; Conrad Detrez), some as acts of critical admiration (Maurice Blanchot, Michel Leiris) and some needing no qualification (Proust, Flaubert). And yet, \\u201cEssays Two\\u201d makes clear that Davis hasn\\u2019t had two careers running in parallel, hasn\\u2019t attended to translation as preparation for becoming a writer, so much as she has translated throughout her writing life as a way of regularly renovating her relationship with language, a constant tuning of her instrument.\", \"There are any number of amazements in \\u201cEssays Two.\\u201d Some involve deep dives into a writer, others brief, bracing immersions. There are seven separate engagements with Proust, essays approaching the author\\u2019s work from different directions but all centered on Davis\\u2019s translating of \\u201cSwann\\u2019s Way.\\u201d We learn, for example, that Davis first read Proust 25 years before she began her translation, and at the time she didn\\u2019t, or wasn\\u2019t able to, finish reading even that volume, the first of Proust\\u2019s seven-volume novel. Rather, she read the final third only as she translated it \\u2014 an idea that for many of us might seem counterintuitive: Mustn\\u2019t one have first read a book to translate it? Davis\\u2019s experience flips the idea: How can one read a book if one isn\\u2019t first translating it?\", \"\\u201cWhat is hard to determine,\\u201d Davis writes, \\u201cis what sort of influence reading Proust for the first time had had on me as a young writer.\\u201d In \\u201cHammers and Hoofbeats,\\u201d an essay that made my brain\\u2019s jaw drop as I read it, Proust\\u2019s influence on Davis materializes as she thinks through, or imagines, the sounds Proust would have heard as a child:\", \"This 187-word sentence is a list, grammatically a sentence fragment, one constituted of 14 dependent clauses that evoke the fragmentary nature of sensation, offering a sonic portrait of a provincial past. Not in 14 lifetimes would it have occurred to me to imagine what Proust (or any writer) would have heard in childhood, but Davis\\u2019s attention to the idea puts the reader into different proximity to what translation does and what writing as a practice demands and too frequently overlooks: an osmotic awareness of the world, a quality of vision and audition that a writer transfigures into a sequence of \\u2014 not words \\u2014 sound. The yield of that attention is delivered in Davis\\u2019s subsequent, grammatically ironclad, sentence:\", \"The alliterative c\\u2019s that run through Davis\\u2019s phrases and carry over into Proust\\u2019s; the \\u201cow\\u201d that rings five times, from Davis\\u2019s \\u201csounding\\u201d to Proust\\u2019s: Davis\\u2019s and Proust\\u2019s sonics marry at the second colon, Davis\\u2019s exquisite \\u201ctolling for deaths, clamoring for weddings\\u201d performing the loss and gain of life and memory \\u2014 bells so greedily alive they demand not death but joy. Here we find an answer to Davis\\u2019s question of influence, Davis not sounding like Proust but thinking, unintimidated, collegially, with him.\", \"Engagements like these populate \\u201cEssays Two,\\u201d making a reader want to return to reading, not to say living, with a different, Davislike (ugly word for beautiful idea) attention. The most surprising such acts of attention in the collection, and the most illuminating of the practice of translation to the monoglot, are conceptually the least promising. \\u201cI do certain things backward,\\u201d she tells us, a claim that certainly applies to her learning Spanish by reading \\u201cThe Adventures of Tom Sawyer\\u201d in Spanish translation and then translating the Spanish into English and then comparing her translation of it with Twain\\u2019s original, not to see what is lost in translation but gained through its practice: in part, a more precise sense of Twain\\u2019s singularity.\", \"There are also Davis\\u2019s accounts of translating English books into English \\u2014 Laurence Sterne\\u2019s \\u201cA Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy\\u201d (1768); the children\\u2019s book \\u201cBob, Son of Battle\\u201d (1898) \\u2014 older Englishes into contemporary English, an effectively foreign language into a domestic one, what all translation ultimately, inevitably, entails. Other essays have Davis learning Dutch and Norwegian, documents of ingenuity and curiosity that make the reader \\u2014 while reading them, at least \\u2014 think: I could, no, should, do that too. That one won\\u2019t hardly matters. Mystically, the essays make one feel one has.\", \"The final essay in the collection, \\u201cThe City of Arles,\\u201d is the seeming outlier, about Davis\\u2019s time in and research on the French city of Arles. Davis calls the piece \\u201cnotes\\u201d \\u2014 the word comes from Latin, where it meant \\u201ca mark\\u201d \\u2014 and composes it as a series of discrete stories with names (\\u201cA Single Sheep and a Doorway\\u201d; \\u201cThe Mosquitoes of Arles\\u201d). The essay is an attempt, through attention, to transmogrify a city into a substance, to seek the words that might \\u2014 as Davis\\u2019s body of work, through time, continues to do \\u2014 translate the hidden marks in which the world is written.\"]","href_hash":"992f5ada542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"992f5ada542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}},
