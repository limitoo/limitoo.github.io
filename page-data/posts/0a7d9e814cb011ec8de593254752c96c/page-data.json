A federal judge in Oklahoma has denied a death row inmate's request for a stay of execution. Judge Stephen Friot on Tuesday, Nov. 23, 2021, denied the request from inmate Bigler Stouffer II. The 79-year-old Stouffer is scheduled to receive a lethal injection on Dec. 9. He was convicted and sentenced to die for the 1985 slaying of schoolteacher Linda Reaves.</div>\", \"Laird said he filed an appeal of the judge's ruling with the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver.\", \"Among those who testified during a hearing Monday before Friot was former Republican state Senator Ervin Yen, an anesthesiologist who spoke about his experience administering midazolam, a sedative that is the first drug used in lethal injections in Oklahoma. Yen, who is running as an independent for governor in 2022, was hired by the Oklahoma Office of the Attorney General to testify at a cost of $1,500 per day, court documents show.\", \"Yen wrote in a report for the court that in his opinion, a 500-miligram dose of midazolam, which Oklahoma's lethal injection protocol calls for, would cause a person to be unconscious within seconds and unable to feel pain.\", \"Yen also testified that he was a witness for the state during the October 28 execution of John Grant, who convulsed and vomited after receiving the first dose of midazolam.\", \"Stouffer could still avoid the death penalty if Republican Governor Kevin Stitt agrees to grant him clemency, which the state's Pardon and Parole Board recommended last week in a 3-2 vote, citing the state's history of problematic lethal injections.\", \"Oklahoma had one of the nation's busiest death chambers until problems in 2014 and 2015 led to a de facto moratorium.
