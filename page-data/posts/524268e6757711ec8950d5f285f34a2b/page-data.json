But the tour operator insists that its health protocols are safe enough.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-01-14T12:21:48.000Z","content":"[\"As the Omicron variant of the coronavirus continues to surge onboard cruise ships, forcing several cruise lines to cancel and postpone voyages, Atlantis Events, a gay and lesbian tour operator, is preparing to launch one of its biggest events on Sunday: a 5,500-person Caribbean cruise marking the company\\u2019s 30th anniversary.\", \"Even as the pandemic is raging around the world and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a stark warning telling Americans to avoid travel on cruise ships, regardless of their vaccination status, Atlantis insists that its vaccination mandate, testing requirements and health protocols are enough to provide a safe environment for guests throughout the voyage. Many passengers are convinced.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s time to start living our lives again and vaccines and tests allow us to do that. This isn\\u2019t Covid 2020,\\u201d said Andre Mayer, a graphic designer from Germany who paid more than $4,000 for the weeklong cruise on board Royal Caribbean\\u2019s Oasis of the Seas. \\u201cThis is going to be the wildest party for our community in two years. I\\u2019m talking dirty dancing, sex, drugs, raves, orgies and sweet, sweet freedom.\\u201d\", \"For the hundreds of cruise passengers who contracted the coronavirus on board other ships in recent weeks, many falling ill and spending days in quarantine, their experience couldn\\u2019t have been further from the carefree vacation that Mr. Mayer anticipates. After testing positive, many hoped to isolate in their airy rooms with balconies, but were transferred to basic quarantine facilities \\u2014 some of them without windows \\u2014 and served food that they described as cold and hideous.\", \"For some booked on the Atlantis anniversary cruise, these reports and the omicron wave of the virus is causing them to reconsider their plans. But the company\\u2019s strict cancellation policy does not offer refunds for changes made within 60 days of departure, forcing guests to weigh health risks against losing thousands of dollars.\", \"\\u201cThe Covid reality changes so quickly that there needs to be more flexibility,\\u201d said Aiden Morgan, a 44-year-old dance teacher from Boston. Mr. Morgan sold his ticket on Facebook, but was only offered a $1,480 for his $3,800 ticket.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m getting a lot of pressure from my friends to go and believe me, I really want to go and get it on, but it just seems crazy to me to risk getting sick and being trapped on a boat,\\u201d Mr. Morgan said. \\u201cSome nights I lose sleep and get the sweats just thinking about being in a cold room all alone with Covid.\\u201d\", \"Rich Campbell, chief executive officer of Atlantis Events, said that his events company was not able to offer the same flexibility as billion-dollar cruise lines, which have many fleets and sailings to transfer bookings, and the financial resources to offer refunds.\", \"\\u201cIn order to exist we take massive risks to operate these charters,\\u201d Mr. Campbell said. \\u201cWe signed a contract with the cruise line that cannot be changed or canceled. If I told Royal Caribbean that I was canceling the cruise tomorrow, they would come back and say \\u2018great but you still owe us the money.\\u2019 \\u201d\", \"Out of the 2,700 rooms sold, Mr. Campbell said only 35 have been canceled since Jan. 1.\", \"For guests who cannot travel because of government restrictions or lockdowns, Atlantis is showing more flexibility and issuing credits for future cruises, Mr. Campbell said. Because of the fast-changing circumstances of the pandemic, he said, the company is approaching cancellation requests on a case-by-case basis and trying to accommodate as many people as possible.\", \"\\u201cWe are here to take care of people and we are doing our best,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut if someone comes to us and just says they want their money back, because they don\\u2019t feel comfortable going on the cruise, then we recommend that they take out \\u2018cancel for any reason\\u2019 travel insurance.\\u201d\", \"Since restarting operations in the United States in June, many cruise lines and tour operators have adopted flexible cancellation policies, offering credit or refunds to customers who want to make itinerary changes because of the coronavirus. \", \"Before the pandemic, Atlantic Events hosted more than 25,000 guests each year, organizing specialty gay and lesbian events on cruise ships and resorts around the world. Last year it was forced to cancel or postpone several events, including its 30th anniversary cruise.\", \"\\u201cWe had almost two years with no income, and we are a tiny self-financed company. It was a huge challenge to survive,\\u201d Mr. Campbell said.\", \"While the company does not offer refunds, it says that the health and safety of its guests is a top priority and it will be enforcing Royal Caribbean\\u2019s health and safety protocols, which includes a mask mandate indoors except while eating and drinking and in crowded spaces outdoors. Royal Caribbean officials say that while the Omicron variant has driven up cases on board its ships in recent weeks, most infections have been mild and have not resulted in severe illness. Still, with a growing number of crew members and passengers contracting the virus, the cruise line, like other cruise companies, has canceled several voyages this month in what it said was \\u201can abundance of caution\\u201d as a result of \\u201congoing Covid-related circumstances.\\u201d\", \"Passengers booked on the Atlantis cruise are closely watching the Celebrity Millennium cruise ship, which was chartered by another L.G.B.T travel company this week for a seven-night Caribbean cruise. The capacity for that ship is much smaller, at 2,218 passengers, but coronavirus cases have been reported to the C.D.C. and reached their threshold for an investigation. \", \"Andrew Dubry is a model and entrepreneur from Arizona who has been on several Atlantis cruises. Though a fan of their events, he called on the company, using Facebook, to cancel the cruise and reschedule for a later date. \\u201cSo many people feel forced to go because they can\\u2019t get their money back, it\\u2019s not right,\\u201d Mr. Dubry said. \\u201cMaybe they are worried that it will be empty if they give people the option to cancel, but it\\u2019s their 30th anniversary. I don\\u2019t see why they don\\u2019t just reschedule and make it the big fun party at a better time.\\u201d\", \"Ron Davis, a 50-year-old talent manager from Nashville who will be embarking on his 26th Atlantis cruise on Sunday, said the calls to cancel the cruise are overblown and exacerbated by the stigma against gay cruises that presumes they are all drug-fueled sex parties with no limits.\", \"\\u201cThe cruise is whatever you make of it and there is something for everyone,\\u201d Mr. Davis said. \\u201cI have never been part of an orgy, I have never done cocaine off a stair rail. Sure, if you want that you can find it, but it\\u2019s not all people having rampant sex out in the open.\\u201d\", \"For Mr. Davis, the upcoming cruise does not feel any more dangerous then taking a flight, or going for happy hour at his local bar where customers are not tested beforehand.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think I\\u2019m bulletproof, but I\\u2019m doubled vaxxed and boosted and I\\u2019m careful,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Campbell, the Atlantis chief executive, says that while the 30th anniversary cruise will be a big event for the company, it will be more restricted compared to previous years.\", \"\\u201cThere will be safety protocols and walls and barriers and things in place designed to do the opposite of the business we\\u2019re in, which is to bring people together,\\u201d he said.\", \"Still, for many guests, this will be their first big outing since pandemic restrictions were imposed in 2020. Some passengers expect that people who have been cooped up at home will try to make up for lost time.\", \"\\u201cSo many people have been starved of company and human touch,\\u201d said Costas Raptis, 41, a banker from Greece who sold his ticket online because of fears that he will have to quarantine if he catches the virus. \\u201cEveryone will party hard and hook up and trust me: If they get a few little Covid symptoms, they are not going to tell nobody.\\u201d\", \"Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.
