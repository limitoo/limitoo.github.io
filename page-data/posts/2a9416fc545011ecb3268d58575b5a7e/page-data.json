The Berlin theater is pinning hopes of a return to its former vibrancy on his collaborative approach.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-03T07:46:56.000Z","content":"[\"BERLIN \\u2014 This fall, a new era at the Volksb\\u00fchne theater got off to a curiously muted start. Ren\\u00e9 Pollesch, the theater\\u2019s new artistic director, did not deliver a splashy opening salvo or unveil his first season with a flourish. Instead, four actors parlayed the writer-director\\u2019s signature banter in the cumbersomely titled \\u201cThe Rise and Fall of a Curtain and Its Life In Between.\\u201d If the low-key chamber piece seemed typical of Pollesch\\u2019s work, it was also hardly earth-shattering.\", \"Then again, considering all of the recent turbulence at the Volksb\\u00fchne, maybe a little restraint isn\\u2019t such a bad thing.\", \"Ever since the storied Berlin theater\\u2019s longtime artistic director Frank Castorf was fired in 2017, the Volksb\\u00fchne has sailed on choppy waters. Castorf had run the playhouse since 1992 and had doggedly kept the theater\\u2019s East German spirit alive in the newly reunified Berlin: His leadership style was iron fisted, but he transformed the Volksb\\u00fchne into one of the most exciting and influential forces in European theater, and he built a cult following for his own punishingly long reworkings of the classics from a Marxist perspective.\", \"From Castorf, the torch passed to Chris Dercon, a Belgian who was previously the director of Tate Modern in London, and who planned to turn the Volksb\\u00fchne into a showcase for visiting performers from around the world.\", \"The regime change didn\\u2019t go as planned. For many in Berlin, the replacement of a provocateur from the former East Germany with a slick international transplant was an all-too-potent symbol of a city that was losing its edge. Protesters briefly occupied the theater and, after a series of increasingly hostile episodes \\u2014 including one in which feces were left in front of the artistic director\\u2019s office \\u2014 Dercon quit, only a few months into the job.\", \"In 2019, Dercon was succeeded by Klaus D\\u00f6rr, a veteran theater administrator who was supposed to stabilize the Volksb\\u00fchne until a permanent artistic director took the reins. But this March, D\\u00f6rr abruptly resigned after 10 of the Volksb\\u00fchne\\u2019s female staff members accused him of sexual harassment and creating a hostile workplace.\", \"It was against this stormy backdrop that Pollesch, 59, arrived this summer to lead the house. All of the theater\\u2019s hopes for a return to its former vibrancy have been pinned on Pollesch, a veteran of Castorf\\u2019s Volksb\\u00fchne who is considered one of Germany\\u2019s most distinctive theatrical auteurs, and whose start here is both a homecoming and a new beginning.\", \"In an interview at the theater, Pollesch spoke lovingly of the \\u201cspirit of the old Volksb\\u00fchne\\u201d that he had felt since he saw his first play at there at 17. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the way people interact with each other here, how the entire staff is involved in what\\u2019s happening onstage,\\u201d he said.\", \"But he was also quick to dispel the hope, or the fear, that he was a Trojan horse for reinstating the theater\\u2019s old guard.\", \"\\u201cWe are not Castorf,\\u201d he said. \\u201cCastorf ran the theater very differently than we do.\\u201d\", \"By \\u201cwe,\\u201d Pollesch means himself and a team of actors and theater professionals that he has assembled as an advisory committee. It\\u2019s a cooperative model that is rare in the German theater world \\u2014 and unique for a theater the size of the Volksb\\u00fchne, which has a large staff and a full-time acting ensemble.\", \"Pollesch described how the members of the committee helped him plan his inaugural season: The actor Martin Wuttke, a regular collaborator who is best known for portraying Hitler in the film \\u201cInglourious Basterds,\\u201d recommended the Hungarian director Kornel Mundruczo; the actress Lilith Stangenberg proposed the Filipino experimental filmmaker Khavn de la Cruz. The Volksb\\u00fchne will premiere works by both directors early next year, Pollesch said.\", \"With the young French director Julien Gosselin and the Argentine choreographer Constanza Macras also working at the house this season, the Volksb\\u00fchne\\u2019s globe-trotting lineup looks like it could have sprung from one of Dercon\\u2019s unrealized seasons. But that program was not the result of any agenda to make the house more international, Pollesch said. It emerged organically from his discussions with the advisory board.\", \"That collective approach also mirrors the way the director develops his own quirky plays through intense collaboration with a small group of artists he knows and trusts. A typical Pollesch show is characterized by fluent, chatty dialogue that combines the silly with the philosophical, and by high-energy performances from a group of charismatic actors. Pollesch devises the text of his plays, as well as the staging, for specific performers, whose creative input during the rehearsal process effectively make them co-authors.\", \"\\u201cOften, he sets out with nothing more than a theme, a title,\\u201d Wolf-Dieter Ernst, a professor of theater studies at the University of Bayreuth, said in an email. He added that performers loved working with Pollesch because his method created a \\u201ca kind of safe space for exhausted actors and actresses.\\u201d By applying a similar approach to running the Volksb\\u00fchne, Pollesch was trying to \\u201crun a theater in a more democratic, and less toxic, way,\\u201d Ernst said.\", \"Pollesch, who was born in Friedberg, a small city outside Frankfurt, studied theater at the nearby University of Giessen. In the 1980s, that school was considered the theoretical cradle of \\u201cpostdramatic theater,\\u201d a self-reflexive and deconstructive approach to writing and directing for the stage. Inspired by the theories of Bertolt Brecht and by postmodern artists like the director Robert Wilson, the playwright Heiner M\\u00fcller and the performing ensemble the Wooster Group, postdramatic theater is less concerned with plot or textual fidelity than with exploring \\u2014 and exploding \\u2014 the relationship between a stage presentation and its audience.\", \"Postdramatic theater is often dense, difficult and theoretical, yet Pollesch\\u2019s work is anything but. The lack of narrative or conventional characters may confound expectations about what theater is, but his plays rarely feel obtuse or obscure. In fact, they\\u2019re surprisingly fun and punchy \\u2014 and rarely exceed 90 minutes.\", \"In Pollesch\\u2019s first stint at the Volksb\\u00fchne, he ran its smaller, off-site venue, the Prater, from 2001 to 2007. He also staged shows on the main stage, where his work contrasted sharply with productions by Castorf, whose dark, demanding shows could last up to 12 hours.\", \"Since Castorf\\u2019s ouster, Pollesch has been a fixture at another storied Berlin playhouse, the Deutsches Theater, and has also worked on main stages in Zurich and in Hamburg, Germany. Last year, Berlin critics and audiences went gaga for a Pollesch show unexpectedly staged at the Friedrichstadt-Palast, a 2,000-seat revue theater.\", \"Yet the director\\u2019s inaugural work for the Volksb\\u00fchne has met with a different response.\", \"\\u201cRise and Fall of a Curtain\\u201d hardly amounted to the grand statement of purpose that many expected. If it was unmistakably Pollesch, it also felt slight, as if the director was up to his old tricks at a time when he was expected to wow everyone with a bold new vision. The critical consensus was that the auteur was writing tired backstage chatter for an audience of his own groupies.\", \"\\u201cInstead of timpani and trumpets and manifestoes to usher in a new start, we get a display of cluelessness,\\u201d wrote Peter Laudenbach, a theater critic, in the S\\u00fcddeutsche Zeitung newspaper. Reviewing \\u201cMr. Puntila and the Giant Thing in Mitte,\\u201d the house\\u2019s third new Pollesch production in three months, Laudenbach concluded that it added to the \\u201cdisappointing picture that the Volksb\\u00fchne under Pollesch has offered so far.\\u201d\", \"The director\\u2019s flexible and collaborative approach to programming, and the fact that the theater is tight-lipped about its plans, make it difficult to say what the future of the Volksb\\u00fchne under Pollesch may look like. The director is much clearer about what not to expect. The old Volksb\\u00fchne\\u2019s classic productions won\\u2019t be coming back, he said, recalling the disappointment he once felt after seeing a decade-old revival at the theater during the Castorf era.\", \"\\u201cIt had nothing to do with now,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou can watch movies that were made in a different era,\\u201d he added. \\u201cTheater ages insanely fast.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"2a9416fc545011ecb3268d58575b5a7e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2a9416fc545011ecb3268d58575b5a7e"}},
