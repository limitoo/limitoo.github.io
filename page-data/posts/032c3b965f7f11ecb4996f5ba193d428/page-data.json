Tidal wave of Omicron likely coming to a hospital near you soon,\\\" Dr. Tom Frieden, former chief of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), posted on Twitter.\", \"Preliminary data in South Africa suggests Omicron leads to milder illness than the Delta variant, which is still driving much of the current wave. But a British study released on Friday found no difference in severity between the two variants.\\u00a0\", \"Either way, Omicron's extraordinary level of infectiousness means it could cause many additional deaths, the top U.S. infectious disease expert, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said on Friday.\", \"\\\"When you have a larger number of people getting infected, the total amount of hospitalizations is going to be more. That's just simple math,\\\" Fauci told CNBC.\", \"Fauci also said officials are discussing whether to redefine what it means to be \\\"fully vaccinated\\\" to include booster shots, which according to early studies significantly improve protection against severe cases from the Omicron variant. President Joe Biden warned on Thursday that unvaccinated Americans face \\\"severe illness and death\\\" in coming months.\", \"The latest surge is creating yet another round of disruptions to daily life, though widespread lockdowns have not been put in place.
