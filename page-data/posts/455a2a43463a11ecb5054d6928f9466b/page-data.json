Most Chevrolets and GMC models will be affected.\", \"These changes will remain in place through the 2022 model year, according to GM Authority. \\\"Looking ahead, the inclusion of these features with affected models in the future hinges on the availability of microchip supplies,\\\" a November 12 post on the blog read.\", \"There is a possibility that some models can have heated and ventilated seats added later on when the parts become available again. In the meantime, customers affected by the changes will receive credit compensation, which could range from $150 to $500.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1920276/2021-gmc-terrain.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">General Motors is suffering from a microchip shortage, affecting various features that are typically in their models.

This marks the first time since then that the computer chip shortage did not cause General Motors factories to close. But, some of the factories will only be running on one shift per day.\", \"Phil Amsrud, the senior principal analyst for IHS Markit who studies the chip market, told U.S. News & World Report that this still doesn't mean the microchip shortage is coming to an end. \\\"It's just not a sign that the patient is through all the rough spots and it's a matter of weeks before they're released from the hospital,\\\" he said.\", \"Other car companies have been affected by the chip shortage, as well. BMWs will lose their Touchscreen feature, and Cadillac temporarily removed their popular Super Cruise feature (which has since been reinstated and is available in new Escalades).\", \"General Motors' Chief Executive, Mary T. Barra, said in a conference call with reporters that she \\\"had met with a number of semiconductor suppliers to improve G.M.'s supply of computer chips,\\\" according to The New York Times. \\\"We are specifically working on a strategy to make sure that we are not seeing these types of constraints in the medium term and certainly in the long term,\\\" Barra said.\"]","href_hash":"455a2a43463a11ecb5054d6928f9466b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"455a2a43463a11ecb5054d6928f9466b"}},
