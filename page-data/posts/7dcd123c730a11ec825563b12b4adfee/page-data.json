It doesn't work for those who want to hustle, it doesn't work in terms of spontaneous idea generation.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We believe that going to work is a good thing, that people deal with each other [in-person] for innovation and creativity,\\\" he told CNBC.\", \"JPMorgan \\u2014 the largest bank in the U.S. \\u2014 does not have a blanket policy regarding vaccines, given differing laws across the country.\", \"\\\"We're not trying to be consistent because as you pointed out, there are different laws and different requirements and cities and states and schools and so here we're adjusting locally,\\\" Dimon said.\\u00a0\", \"But 97% of staffers based out of the company's main headquarters in Manhattan are vaccinated, according to Dimon.\\u00a0\", \"His remarks come after Citigroup, the fourth-largest bank in the U.S., on Monday took a hardline approach to vaccines. The bank is demanding that workers get their jabs by the end of this week or risk losing their jobs under the company's vaccination rules. Employees with qualifying religious beliefs or medical conditions will be exempt. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"Complying with the requirement means either submitting proof of vaccination by the January 14 deadline or receiving an approved medical or religious accommodation or state-permitted exemption,\\\" a source with knowledge of the bank's policies told CBS MoneyWatch, while noting that the same deadline does not apply to branch staff.\\u00a0\", \"Debate is swirling around the definition of fully vaccinated, too. The Omicron variant is said to be able to evade two-dose vaccines, and some institutions, from Facebook parent company Meta in Menlo Park, California, to the Metropolitan Opera in New York City are starting to require that individuals demonstrate that they've been boosted beyond their initial vaccine regimen to return to offices and attend performances indoors.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"7dcd123c730a11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7dcd123c730a11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
