Ngata-Aerengamate that coach Glenn Moore contributed to her having a mental breakdown.\", \"In a social media post earlier this week Ngata-Aerengamate alleged Moore told her she didn't deserve to be in the team and she was selected only to play the guitar.\", \"The end of year Northern Hemisphere tour was a tough one for the Black Ferns.\", \"They lost all four tests, beaten convincingly by England and France in what was their first internatioanal rugby in two years due to Covid.\", \"New Zealand Rugby chief executive Mark Robinson says the independent inquiry will run alongside the review the NZR is doing of the Black Ferns end of year tour.\", \"Robinson said the terms of reference are being drawn up and a panel including rugby and non-rugby people being sought.\", \"\\\"We have a huge amount of sympathy for anyone going through a challenging time like this...I know that our people have been in contact with Te Kura to make sure that she has got all the support possible at this time.\", \"Robinson said they also wanted to \\\"understand\\\" what Ngata-Aerengamate wanted to see as part of the review.\", \"Robinson wouldn't give his thoughts on the tenor of the alleged comments.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/282296/eight_col_Black_Ferns_coach_Glenn_Moore_16x10.jpg?1638836452\\\" alt=\\\"Black Ferns coach Glenn Moore\\\"

\"He praised the work Moore has done for the sport...but stopped short of endorsing him as the right person to continue coaching the Black Ferns.\", \"\\\"We have a huge amount of regard for the work that Glen has done over many, many years....but we are taking (this) really seriously,\\\" said Robinson.\", \"He added this was the chance for a \\\"pause to undertsand where we can be better.\\\"\", \"The independent report is expected to be completed by the end of January but Robinson would guarantee it would be made public.\", \"<img

chief executive Mark Robinson \\nPhoto: Photosport\\n</div>\", \"Meanwhile New Zealand Rugby's deal with US equity Silver Lake is at a stalemate and may yet fall over.\", \"In March NZR, the provinces and M\\u0101ori Rugby voted unanimously in favour of the Silver Lake proposal which was worth $387.5 million for a 12.5 percent stake in the commercial rights.\", \"Silver Lake has since reduced their potential equity stake to 7.5 percent.\", \"But NZR has been unable to finalise a deal with the Players Association whose sign-off is needed for it to proceed and Robinson knows time if running out.\", \"\\\"We need to move quickly in this area as we feel the investment not only in rugby but in sport is happening quickly and transforming the ability of sporting codes and organisations right around the world.\\\"\", \"Asked if the deal could still fall over he said \\\"it's a possibility\\\".\", \"\\\"(But) the fact we are meeting again (next week with the Players Association) shows there is a real intent and desire to want to do something so we have just got to keep going.\\\"\", \"AUT senior lecturer in sport management Dr Richard Wright said Silver Lake might start looking elsewhere if a deal was not done soon.\", \"\\\"If I was Silver Lake I'd be looking at the [world champion] Springboks and look at giving New Zealand a sort of time limit and saying take us or leave us, if not the Spingboks have got to be looking at a quite an investment or even the Wallabies.\", \"\\\"I don't think New Zealand Rugby can wait indefinitely but I believe Silver Lake are passionate enough and the All Blacks' brand is strong enough that they'll be willing to wait a few more months.\\\"\",
