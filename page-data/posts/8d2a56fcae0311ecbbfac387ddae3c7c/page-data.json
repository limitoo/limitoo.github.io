He's got a good fat lip and a bleeding nose, and hopefully it's nothing much more than that. We'll have to track him and see how he cleans up.\\\"\", \"Barrett, twice named world player of the year, earlier this month said his recovery period in the aftermath of the injury against Ireland was \\\"extremely challenging\\\".\", \"\\\"I'm well aware of how concussion can lead to retirement if it doesn't work out. Kane, my brother, had to give up his career because of it. I see plenty of good friends and team mates have done the same in the past,\\\" he told the New Zealand Herald.\", \"\\\"It's probably the closest I've been to retirement and I wasn't ready for it... The hardest thing about this one was not finding the cure. That's the million-dollar question with a lot of these concussions. It was frustrating.\\\"\", \"Before the incident, Barrett put in a strong first-half performance that included a try and 13 points before leaving the field.\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"8d2a56fcae0311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8d2a56fcae0311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
