Their shooting percentages have been really consistently high over the whole unit.\", \"\\\"The going to the post, which is very good to be able to see that from a team perspective, but also acknowledging the work they've done since the December camp.\\\"\", \"The quartet had four specialist coaching sessions over the Christmas break and Dame Noeline believes that has helped them come into the tour better prepared.\", \"\\\"So, we'll see how we go but it's not actually an area of concern that I'm worried about at the moment.

I think having somebody like Te Aroha come back into the mix where she knows her very well and vice versa.

Not only from what she does on court but she's quite an energiser bunny and quite a lovely person to have within the mix.\", \"\\\"I think the ACL and understanding what is required for her to come back at that level to be an elite athlete is going to take a bit of work.
