Antonio Guterres, the secretary-general of the United Nations, described the restrictions as a form of \\u201ctravel apartheid.\\u201d\", \"Now, though, with Omicron already spreading widely in Britain, the government concluded that it had lost the battle to prevent its importation from abroad.\", \"On Tuesday, the health secretary, Sajid Javid, announced the end of the \\u201cred list\\u201d restrictions for England that applied to Angola, Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, South Africa, Zambia and Zimbabwe.\", \"\\u201cGiven that there is community transmission of Omicron in the U.K. and that Omicron has spread so widely across the world, the travel red list is less effective in slowing the incursion of Omicron from abroad,\\u201d Mr. Javid said in Parliament.\", \"\\u201cWhile we will maintain our temporary testing measures for international travel, we will be removing all 11 countries from the travel red list, effective from 4 tomorrow morning,\\u201d he added.\", \"Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, which maintained similar red lists, followed London\\u2019s lead on Tuesday.\", \"World Health Organization officials thanked Britain for lifting the restrictions, which they had criticized as overly blunt and economically damaging. In South Africa, the minister of tourism, Lindiwe Sisulu, welcomed Britain\\u2019s decision, saying that the red list \\u201cwas a huge deterrent for Brits who were considering traveling to South Africa at a time when our tourism industry was just beginning to recover.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Javid said he would consider whether travelers who were already in quarantine hotels \\u2014 some of whom have complained about the conditions \\u2014 would have to finish their 10-day stay. \\u201cI am told that the practice in the past was to require them to complete their quarantine period,\\u201d he said, before adding that he had \\u201casked for urgent advice\\u201d on the issue.\", \"Fully vaccinated travelers coming to England from anywhere still have to show proof of a negative coronavirus test taken recently before departure, and then take a PCR test within two days of arrival and stay in quarantine until they receive a negative result.\", \"The travel industry argues that these rules are deeply damaging.
