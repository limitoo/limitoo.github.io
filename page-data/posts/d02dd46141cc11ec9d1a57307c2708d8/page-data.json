Instead, white jurors who were less educated served.\", \"Davidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk first proposed a deal on Abdur'Rhanman's behalf to change his execution sentence to three life sentences.\", \"\\\"Overt racial bias has no place in the justice system,\\\" Funk said during the 2019 hearing.\", \"\\\"Further, and most importantly, the pursuit of justice is incompatible with deception.

That's what happened in 2019, the first time Watkins threw out Abdur'Rahman's death sentence.\", \"His attorneys eventually signed an agreement with Attorney Funk to reduce his sentence in return for Abdur'Rahman agreeing to drop any future appeals. At the time, Katrina and Shawanna Norman said they were relieved that the legal maneuverings were finally over.\", \"In an unusual move, the state Attorney General's Office appealed, arguing that Watkins didn't have the authority to modify Abdur'Rahman's sentence based merely on an agreement with the district attorney. The Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals agreed. It said Watkins could review the petition again but ordered him to follow procedures outlined in the appeals court's decision. That order set the stage for Tuesday's do-over.\", \"A spokesperson for the Attorney General's Office said in an email that prosecutors are reviewing Watkins' order and \\\"considering next steps.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"d02dd46141cc11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d02dd46141cc11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
