Although vaccines had arrived, distribution was a challenge. Holiday plans had been disrupted.\", \"I was even writing this newsletter. (This time, I\\u2019m filling in for Soumya, who\\u2019s taking a much-deserved break.)\", \"But we\\u2019ve been making progress. Hospitals are not overwhelmed in Los Angeles, one of the national centers of the pandemic at this time last year. Millions of Californians are vaccinated and have gotten booster shots, providing them with a level of protection against illness and hospitalization that felt unimaginable a year ago. The Rose Parade is back on.\", \"And we still managed to deepen our understanding of this vexing, beautiful state. Here are some of the stories that taught my colleagues and me something new \\u2014 or, at least, made us think \\u2014 about California:\", \"Gov. Gavin Newsom\\u2019s sound defeat of the recall\", \"It has long been relatively easy to attempt a recall of the governor of California. But as my colleague Shawn Hubler reported, there are reasons that the only person to have successfully unseated the state\\u2019s leader is the singular Arnold Schwarzenegger.\", \"Although Californians spent months in a state of limbo \\u2014 wondering whether we\\u2019d be asked to decide whether to oust Newsom from office and if so, when \\u2014 once the election was on, the governor tried to beat back the campaign against him by leaning into national political divisions. The choice, he said, was effectively between him and former President Donald J. Trump, between science and conspiracy theories. The strategy worked, as voters across the state \\u2014 including in the political seesaw that is Orange County \\u2014 rejected the recall.\", \"A wave of anti-Asian violence\", \"Early this year, a string of jarring attacks, captured on video, reignited simmering fear and hurt among Asian Americans who have felt like targets for violence and harassment. For many, the anxiety started with the former president\\u2019s rhetoric \\u2014 his insistence on calling the coronavirus \\u201cthe China virus\\u201d or the \\u201cKung Flu\\u201d \\u2014 but in 2021, that anxiety and fear coalesced into outrage.\", \"That was before March, when a gunman shot and killed eight people in Georgia, six of whom were women of Asian descent working in spas. Across the country and in California, my colleagues and I reported, Asian Americans were at once devastated and galvanized. Leaders demanded serious action to address anti-Asian discrimination.\", \"But as my colleagues Kellen Browning and Brian X. Chen recently wrote, agreeing to fight racism is one thing. Reaching consensus on what that actually entails is quite another.\", \"Climate change\\u2019s continuing chokehold\", \"In 2020, while huge swaths of the West burned, many tourists sought refuge at and around Lake Tahoe, the azure gem of the Sierra Nevada. This year, as the Caldor fire burned dangerously close, residents were forced to flee in an exodus that felt symbolic: a cherished sanctuary, suffocating in smoke.\", \"This year, in addition to contending with fire and power outages, Californians became acutely aware that the state is running out of water. (My colleague Thomas Fuller wrote about a Mendocino innkeeper pondering the reality of $5 showers.) And scientists say drought is very much in the future, even if it is raining or snowing where you are now. But as I learned when I reported on San Diego\\u2019s long, difficult journey to water stability, the situation isn\\u2019t hopeless.\", \"The enduring changes brought about by the pandemic\", \"Last year felt like one long string of crises, each one colliding with the one that came before it, like cars piling up on the freeway. (Drive safe this weekend, by the way.) This year, it felt as if there were finally opportunities to take stock of ways the pandemic helped us break free from some of the conventions of life before.\", \"In California, as my colleague Conor Dougherty reported, a small pilot program aimed at getting homeless people off the streets, away from Covid-19, and into hotels, also showed a possible path forward for making a dent in the state\\u2019s enormous homelessness crisis.\", \"As Soumya reported in October, Clement Street in San Francisco\\u2019s Richmond District was spared the financial ruin that ravaged other cities in large part because it is relatively self-contained \\u2014 residents can find most of what they need within a short walk or bike ride. Clement Street\\u2019s success, she wrote, shows how neighborhoods of the future can be resilient.\", \"Here are a few more uplifting stories that defined this year:\", \"Vegetarian chili with winter vegetables.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from Lori Cassels, a reader who lives in Alameda. Lori recommends Point Reyes National Seashore:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California. Email your suggestions to CAtoday@nytimes.com. We\\u2019ll be sharing more in upcoming editions of the newsletter.\", \"How are you marking the start of the 2022? Are you making any New Year\\u2019s resolutions?\", \"Share with us at CAtoday@nytimes.com.\", \"Sometimes, two birds in the bush may be better than a bird in the hand.\", \"It seems as if that would be the case, anyway, for the avian enthusiasts who recently participated in the Golden Gate Audubon Society\\u2019s 122nd annual Christmas bird count.\", \"Their mission, The San Francisco Chronicle reports, was to tally every bird within about 177 square miles over the course of a day.\", \"That task, birders said, requires a kind of Zen-like patience.\", \"\\u201cIt can be hard. It\\u2019s not for everyone,\\u201d Terry Horrigan told The Chronicle. \\u201cSometimes, for hours, you\\u2019re just looking and looking and looking.\\u201d\", \"Thanks for reading.
