The S&P 500 ticked up 1% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq was up 1.4%.\", \"European stocks also rose. Benchmarks in London, Frankfurt and Paris had gained by midday. Stock indexes in Shanghai, Tokyo and Hong Kong ended lower, though losses were  smaller than Friday's fall, sparked by reports that the new COVID-19 variant, first  spotted in South Africa, appeared to be spreading\\u00a0around the globe.\", \"As health authorities scrambled to analyze the new variant, traders  were clinging to hope that it would be less severe than other  strains of the virus.\", \"\\\"The potential for a less deadly form of the virus does appear to  provide some respite to the risk-off sentiment dominating Friday's  trade,\\\" said Joshua Mahony, senior market analyst at IG. \\\"However, the  weeks ahead are fraught with danger for investors.\\\"\", \"Monday's rebound comes after stocks on Friday marked their\\u00a0biggest daily loss since February\\u00a0as investors were spooked by the new variant, which some scientists are concerned could prove to be more contagious or deadly than earlier varieties.
