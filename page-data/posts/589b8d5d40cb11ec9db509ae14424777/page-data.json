It has increased substantially since 1990 and many groundwater sites continue to degrade.\", \"The likely biological mechanism for nitrate increasing the risk of bowel cancer is complicated and is influenced by dietary factors, especially the balance of red meat, fruit and vegetables and gut microflora.\", \"New Zealand experiences one of the highest rates of bowel cancer in the world with an average of 3000 cases per year. It is our second biggest cancer killer, causing an average of 1200 deaths per year.\"]","href_hash":"589b8d5d40cb11ec9db509ae14424777"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"589b8d5d40cb11ec9db509ae14424777"}},
