Great day to spend with friends and whanau on December 25 this year,\\\" MetService meteorologist Angus Hines says.\", \"\\\"The high to the west is swelling up over the country, and you know high pressure generally leads to settled weather.\\\"\", \"NIWA has issued its Christmas forecast - and it's tipping the North Island to have the best day.\", \"\\\"The warmest weather looks to be in the northern and western North Island. The eastern South Island will have low clouds, particularly during the morning, and cooler than average temperatures,\\\" says NIWA meteorologist Ben Noll.\", \"\\\"An onshore wind flow will bring some extra clouds and prevent a hot Christmas in the eastern North Island.\\\"\", \"Hines says there could be a little bit of shower activity around the Gisborne region, especially during the morning, but there's lots of sunshine in store as well.\", \"\\\"What about temperature-wise? Well, we were looking at a slightly cool Christmas and now that's gone up a bit, maybe to around about average temperatures for the time of year,\\\" Hines says.\", \"\\\"So not an absolute scorcher but some good temperatures in store around the country.\\\"\", \"The warmer spots are likely to be the central North Island on 25C-26C, with one or two spots maybe touching 27C. The rest of the North Island should have around 20C-24C.\", \"The South Island will be a few degrees cooler. A few spots along the eastern side could be waking up to chilly morning before warming up to around 20C in the afternoon, Hines adds.\"]","href_hash":"93124338621111ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"93124338621111ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
