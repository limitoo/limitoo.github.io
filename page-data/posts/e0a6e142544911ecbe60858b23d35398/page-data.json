The prosecutor has accused Mr. Peleg, his former wife and a man suspected of being an accomplice of kidnapping.\", \"Mr. Peleg would be arrested only if he were to leave Israel because the country does not extradite its citizens until a definitive conviction has been issued, and an arrest warrant is not considered sufficient, said one of his lawyers, Paolo Sevesi.\", \"Eitan was expected to return to Ms. Biran\\u2019s home in northern Italy, in time to celebrate the final days of Hanukkah with his family there.\"]","href_hash":"e0a6e142544911ecbe60858b23d35398"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e0a6e142544911ecbe60858b23d35398"}},
