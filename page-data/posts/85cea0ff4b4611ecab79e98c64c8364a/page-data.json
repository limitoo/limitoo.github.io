Nevertheless, she will continue to be involved in tennis, the sport she loves so much.\\\"\", \"France's foreign minister had earlier called on the Chinese authorities to provide more reassurance, echoing a statement by the Women's Tennis Association that the images were \\\"insufficient\\\" proof.\", \"\\\"I'm expecting only one thing: that she speaks,\\\" France's Jean-Yves Le Drian told LCI television, adding that there could be unspecified diplomatic consequences if China did not clear up the situation. The United States and Britain had also called for China to provide proof of Peng's whereabouts.\", \"Current and former tennis players, from Naomi Osaka to Serena Williams to Billie Jean King had joined the calls seeking to confirm she was safe, using the social media hashtag #WhereIsPengShuai?\", \"The concern over Peng came as global rights groups and others have called for a boycott of the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February over China's human rights record.\", \"On Nov. 2, Peng posted on Chinese social media that former Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli had sexually assaulted her several years ago.\", \"Neither Zhang nor the Chinese government have commented on her allegation. Peng's social media post was quickly deleted and the topic has been blocked from discussion on China's heavily censored internet.\", \"Hu Xijin, editor-in-chief of the state-backed Global Times, posted a 25-second video on Twitter on Sunday that showed her smiling, waving and autographing giant tennis balls for children at the Fila Kids Junior Tennis Challenger Finals tournament. The Global Times is published by the People's Daily, the official newspaper of China's ruling Communist Party.\", \"The tennis event's official WeChat page shows photos of her at the tournament. Peng, 35, was the world No.1 doubles player in 2014, the first Chinese player to achieve a top ranking, after winning the doubles titles at Wimbledon in 2013 and the French Open in 2014.\", \"On Saturday night, Peng visited a popular restaurant in downtown Beijing, according to a video posted by Hu that a restaurant manager confirmed to Reuters.\", \"Seven people including Peng were at the Sichuanese restaurant, said the manager, Zhou Hongmei, adding that they ate in a private room and were joined by the restaurant's owner.\", \"\\\"It was crowded at the restaurant as usual,\\\" Zhou said, showing a bill that included noodles and bamboo shoots. \\\"They didn't have much. I think they mostly chatted.\\\"\", \"The Women's Tennis Association, which has threatened to pull tournaments out of China, said the photos and video were \\\"insufficient\\\" and did not address the WTA's concerns, a spokesperson for the group told Reuters by email.\", \"The International Tennis Federation said it would continue to seek confirmation from Peng that she was safe.\", \"Chinese state media outlet CGTN on Wednesday released what it said was an email Peng had sent to the WTA's chairman denying she was sexually assaulted.\", \"Chairman Steve Simon said he had a hard time believing that Peng herself had written the email.\", \"-Reuters\"]","href_hash":"85cea0ff4b4611ecab79e98c64c8364a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"85cea0ff4b4611ecab79e98c64c8364a"}},
