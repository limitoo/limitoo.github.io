In exploring the beauty and singularity of a face, the camera can also disclose the anguish of a soul.\", \"But some of Dumont\\u2019s zooms have a more profane, or at least a more worldly connotation. Seydoux\\u2019s character, France de Meurs, is a popular television anchor and correspondent who hosts a nightly news show that ends, as such broadcasts typically do, with a close-up. To some extent, \\u201cFrance\\u201d \\u2014 the movie and its possibly allegorical heroine alike \\u2014 is structured around the tension between the banality of television and the sacredness of cinema, and around the difficulty of telling them apart.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re becoming an icon,\\u201d France\\u2019s producer \\u2014 a chain-vaping, scene-stealing comic foil named Lou (Blanche Gardin) \\u2014 enthuses, using the word in the usual secular way, as a synonym for celebrity. But Dumont is also interested in an older, overtly religious meaning. An icon is more than a picture: It\\u2019s a pictorial incarnation of holiness.\", \"The irruption of the divine into ordinary life \\u2014 sometimes sublime, sometimes violent, sometimes absurd \\u2014 has preoccupied this director for much of his career. In addition to two historical features about Joan of Arc, he has made films set in contemporary France (including \\u201cThe Life of Jesus,\\u201d \\u201cHumanit\\u00e9\\u201d and \\u201cHadewijch\\u201d) that vibrate with metaphysical implications. They can be brutal, unnerving and also puzzling.\", \"\\u201cFrance\\u201d is all of those things, but also curiously slack, especially as France spirals through a series of personal and professional crises. The first of these \\u2014 the least dramatic but also, for her, the most consequential \\u2014 occurs in the midst of a Parisian traffic jam, when her car strikes a deliveryman\\u2019s motor scooter. He is knocked down, and something is knocked loose in her. Desperate to atone, she gives money to the man\\u2019s family that they never asked for, and buys him a new scooter once he has recovered from his injuries.\", \"It isn\\u2019t enough. Or maybe her emotional turmoil has another source. France is married to a dour novelist (Benjamin Biolay), and lives with him and their obnoxious young son (Gaetan Amiel) in a pretentiously decorated Paris apartment. For a while, she leaves them, and her job, for an old-fashioned rest cure at an Alpine spa. There, she meets a mopey young man (Emanuele Arioli) who claims to be a professor of Latin.\", \"In the second part of the movie, dramatic incidents pile up, as France suffers danger on the job, romantic betrayal, tabloid scandal and devastating tragedy. The close-ups continue to accumulate, the discreet tears sometimes blossoming into full, face-contorting sobs. But while France remains interesting, thanks to Seydoux\\u2019s tough and resourceful performance, \\u201cFrance\\u201d loses its emotional force and its intellectual focus. A potentially insightful exploration of the loss of self in a media-saturated world amounts, in the end, to a series of shallow images.\"]","href_hash":"7ba85502592411ecae989d0fdd9ef1e0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7ba85502592411ecae989d0fdd9ef1e0"}},
