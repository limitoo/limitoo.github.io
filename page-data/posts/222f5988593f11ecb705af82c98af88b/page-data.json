But how ready other European states, especially Germany, are to embrace Mr. Macron\\u2019s vision is not clear.\", \"For Germans, who prefer that their leaders be publicly reserved to the point of blandness, Mr. Macron\\u2019s style can appear a little swaggering. The new German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, will meet the president Friday in his first foreign visit.\", \"The European presidency, which France has not held for 13 years because of the slow rotation among 27 members, is something of a political tool for Mr. Macron in that the French presidential election will be held in April.\", \"However, he refused to confirm his candidacy for re-election, vowing only that he would exercise his five-year mandate \\u201cuntil the last quarter hour.\\u201d It is widely expected that Mr. Macron, 43, will only formally enter the race in the first couple of months of 2022, leaving his opponents to take swipes at one another as he looks on.\", \"The president, whose tendency to equivocate on difficult issues has led to his being called the \\u201con-the-other-hand\\u201d president, has never wavered in his firm support for the European project, despite the steady rise of a far right in France whose banner is nationalism. He has long advocated \\u201cstrategic autonomy\\u201d for Europe, making it less U.S.-dependent for its defense.\", \"His vision of a more assertive France, acting as Europe\\u2019s leader, could appeal to center-right voters. The retirement of Mr. Scholz\\u2019s predecessor, Angela Merkel, long seen as the de facto E.U. leader, leaves Mr. Macron more room for maneuver.\", \"The cascade of objectives he announced on Thursday reflected his determination to make a mark.\", \"Among the plans Mr. Macron outlined were a Euro-African summit in February to \\u201crebuild\\u201d relations and offer a \\u201cNew Deal\\u201d for Africa; a security summit in March to galvanize joint European military exercises and development of a shared defense industry; measures to turn Europe into \\u201ca digital power; the creation of a six-month \\u201cEuropean civic service\\u201d for citizens under 25; and a tightening of the union\\u2019s external borders as Europe faces immigration pressures it has been unable to control.\", \"\\u201cI am a proud European,\\u201d Mr. Macron said, as he described how the continent had come together to fight the pandemic. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a beautiful thing, Europe.\\u201d He continued: \\u201cWhen you defend Europe, you have to defend it completely. You have to correct it. You have to confront its faults, its bureaucratic complexities, its deviations.\\u201d\", \"For Britain, which left the European Union last year and has since been embroiled in several fights with France over fishing rights, migrants and other issues, Mr. Macron did not refrain from some scathing words.\", \"He accused Britain of operating an economic model that relies \\u201con the illegal work of foreigners.\\u201d He suggested that Prime Minister Boris Johnson\\u2019s government was incapable of \\u201cgood faith.\\u201d He said he could not forget Britain\\u2019s role in the Anglo-American sale this year of nuclear-powered submarines to Australia, which upended a previous commitment to buying conventional French submarines.\", \"This submarine contract, he said, amounted to the deliberate undermining of a \\u201cFrench vision in the Indo-Pacific\\u201d and was \\u201cnot exactly a flagrant sign of friendship, to use a touch of understatement.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"222f5988593f11ecb705af82c98af88b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"222f5988593f11ecb705af82c98af88b"}},
