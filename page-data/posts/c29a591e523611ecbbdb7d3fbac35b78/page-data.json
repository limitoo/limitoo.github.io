On the fifth day, prosecutors tried making one thing clear: She knew.\", \"Over more than five hours of cross-examination on Tuesday, Robert Leach, the assistant U.S. attorney and lead prosecutor for the case, pointed to text messages, notes and emails with Ms. Holmes \\u2014 and with her business partner and former boyfriend, Ramesh Balwani \\u2014 discussing problems with Theranos\\u2019s business and technology. Mr. Leach had a common refrain: No one hid anything from Ms. Holmes. As Theranos\\u2019s chief executive, he argued, she was to blame.\", \"\\u201cAnything that happens at the company was your responsibility at the end of the day?\\u201d Mr. Leach asked.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s how I felt,\\u201d Ms. Holmes said.\", \"It was the culmination of three months of testimony and four years of waiting since Ms. Holmes was indicted on charges of wire fraud and conspiracy to commit wire fraud in 2018. Prosecutors have shown jurors evidence of faked product demonstrations, falsified documents and communications with the goal of showing that Ms. Holmes knowingly misled investors, doctors, patients and the world about Theranos.\", \"The outcome of her case has consequences for the tech industry at a moment when fast-growing start-ups are amassing wealth, power and cultural cachet. Few start-up founders have been prosecuted for misleading investors as they strive to hustle their long-shot business ideas into existence. If convicted, Ms. Holmes, 37, who has pleaded not guilty, faces up to 20 years in prison.\", \"Theranos rose to a $9 billion valuation in 2015, raising $945 million on Ms. Holmes\\u2019s promise that its blood testing machines could perform hundreds of tests quickly and cheaply using just a few drops of blood. She started the company in 2003 after dropping out of Stanford University.\", \"But in reality, prosecutors have argued, Theranos\\u2019s machines could conduct only a dozen tests, and those were unreliable. Instead, it secretly used commercially available machines from Siemens. After that and other misrepresentations were exposed, Theranos voided two years\\u2019 worth of blood test results. It also settled lawsuits with investors and the Securities and Exchange Commission, ultimately dissolving in 2018.\", \"In her initial testimony, Ms. Holmes tried dismissing the fraud accusations as too simple and as a misunderstanding of her statements. She also pleaded ignorance to many of Theranos\\u2019s problems, emphasizing her lack of experience and qualifications to run a scientific lab.\", \"Under cross-examination on Tuesday, Ms. Holmes admitted to making mistakes. \\u201cThere are many things I wish I did differently,\\u201d she said.\", \"Theranos mishandled a 2015 expos\\u00e9 in The Wall Street Journal about problems with the company\\u2019s technology, she said.\", \"\\u201cWe totally messed it up,\\u201d Ms. Holmes said. She also admitted to reaching out to Rupert Murdoch, owner of The Journal who invested in Theranos, to quash the story.\", \"Ms. Holmes said she also regretted the way Theranos treated Erika Cheung, an employee who raised concerns about the company\\u2019s lab practices. After Ms. Cheung left the company, Theranos hired a private investigator to track her down and serve her with a legal threat.\", \"\\u201cI sure as hell wish we had treated her differently and listened to her,\\u201d Ms. Holmes said.\", \"The testimony followed dramatic revelations about Ms. Holmes\\u2019s relationship with Mr. Balwani. On Monday, she said through tears that she had been raped as a student at Stanford and that Mr. Balwani had emotionally and physically abused her in the wake of that experience.\", \"She accused Mr. Balwani, who is 20 years her senior, of controlling what she ate, how she presented herself and how much time she spent with her family. She said he forced her to have sex with him against her will and told her she had to \\u201ckill herself\\u201d to be reborn as a successful entrepreneur.\", \"It was the first time Ms. Holmes told her side of the story of Theranos\\u2019s rise and fall, which had been held up in podcasts, documentaries and scripted series as a tale of Silicon Valley arrogance and comeuppance. Her testimony complicated that narrative, casting new light on the behind-the-scenes relationship between herself and Mr. Balwani, which they had kept secret as her profile rose.\", \"Ms. Holmes tried tying her relationship with Mr. Balwani to her fraud charges by stating that he impacted \\u201ceverything about who I was,\\u201d including Theranos. She said she pushed him out of the company and broke up with him after she learned that Theranos\\u2019s lab, which Mr. Balwani oversaw, had major issues.\", \"\\u201cThere was no way I could save our company if he was there,\\u201d she said on Tuesday.\", \"Mr. Balwani has denied assault accusations. He was indicted on fraud charges alongside Ms. Holmes and will be tried separately next year. He has also pleaded not guilty.\", \"Over a long and detailed day of testimony, Mr. Leach lingered on the relationship, using text messages between Ms. Holmes and Mr. Balwani as his primary evidence. He asked Ms. Holmes to read text messages that showed her exchanging affectionate remarks with Mr. Balwani. The pair called each other \\u201ctiger\\u201d and \\u201ctigress\\u201d in between pep talks about building Theranos.\", \"\\u201cNo one but you and I can build this business,\\u201d Mr. Balwani wrote in one exchange.\", \"After each, Mr. Leach asked Ms. Holmes to verify that she had just read an example of Mr. Balwani acting lovingly toward her. Reading the messages, Ms. Holmes cried for a second time on the stand.\", \"Jill Hasday, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School who has written a book on intimate partner violence and the law, said the prosecution\\u2019s tactic could work to undermine Ms. Holmes\\u2019s previous testimony, depending on jurors\\u2019 understanding of abuse.\", \"\\u201cMy gut is, it can be effective, because people have a lot of misconceptions about intimate partner violence, among other things that it\\u2019s constant,\\u201d Ms. Hasday said.\", \"The trial, which is scheduled to end in December, resumes next week.\"]","href_hash":"c29a591e523611ecbbdb7d3fbac35b78"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c29a591e523611ecbbdb7d3fbac35b78"}},
