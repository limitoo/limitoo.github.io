Mr. Peltz has experience taking on big consumer companies: He won a seat on the board of Procter & Gamble in 2017.\", \"It is unclear how much of a stake Trian owns or what it is calling for, though one of the people said the firm had begun buying shares in Unilever before the company\\u2019s pursuit of the GlaxoSmithKline business became public. Shares in Unilever were up nearly 7 percent in London.

The company\\u2019s stock has fallen nearly 4 percent in premarket trading.\", \"The company is in worse shape now than before the pandemic propelled its growth, Blackwells said, with \\u201chigh fixed costs, excessive inventory, a listless strategy, dispirited employees and thousands of disgruntled shareholders.\\u201d A representative for Peloton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\", \"The department store Kohl\\u2019s has received a roughly $9 billion offer to go private in a deal with an investment consortium backed by the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, according to two people familiar with the matter. Shares of the department store are up more than 30 percent than premarket trading.\", \"The offer highlights the resurgent interest that activist investors are showing in department stores, as brick-and-mortar retailers have struggled with supply chain issues in the pandemic and increasing competition from online sites. Shares of retailers have been under pressure for the past several years, while those of online sites have, until recently, been soaring.\", \"Kohl\\u2019s is already under pressure to improve its share price. The activist firm Macellum Advisors, which has a 5 percent stake in Kohl\\u2019s, urged the retailer in a letter last Tuesday to explore strategic alternatives, including a sale. That was after it raised similar criticisms over Kohl\\u2019s stock performance last year. The hedge fund Engine Capital has also been calling on Kohl\\u2019s to consider a sale, along with other strategic initiatives.
