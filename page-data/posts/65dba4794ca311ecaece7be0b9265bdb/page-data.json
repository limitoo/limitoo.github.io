It is hard to believe so with his up-to-date skill set.\", \"\\u201cI kind of have succeeded on every single level, and there\\u2019s one thing missing,\\u201d he said, referring to a Grand Slam title. \\u201cI hope I can do that next year.\\u201d\", \"He has exceptional power and reach and, like Medvedev, remarkable mobility at 6-foot-6. He has one of the best first serves and backhands in the world and improved court positioning and a shored-up forehand that was often a decisive punch down the stretch in Turin as he knocked out the world No. 1 Novak Djokovic in a three-set semifinal and then the second-ranked Medvedev in a match much shorter in length and thrills.\", \"\\u201cI feel like it\\u2019s inevitable Zverev is going to win a major,\\u201d said Patrick McEnroe, the ESPN analyst and former U.S. Davis Cup captain. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been saying for a couple years that he\\u2019s been knocking on the door. Now he\\u2019s banging on it.\\u201d\", \"He was already pounding loudly in 2020 at the U.S. Open, where he lost in a nervy, five-set final to Dominic Thiem in which Zverev lost a two-set lead and both players seemed to shrink from the prospect of breaking through.\", \"But though Zverev did not reach a Grand Slam final in 2021, this has been a reaffirming year with six singles titles, including the Olympic gold medal in Tokyo after stopping Djokovic along the way. Zverev, long considered soft when it mattered most, seems more clearheaded under duress and better at making tactical shifts and smart decisions on the fly.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s been a great player for a long time,\\u201d said Mischa Zverev, his brother, who has been coaching him in their father Alexander\\u2019s absence from the tour. \\u201cSascha has all the shots, that big serve and big backhand and is moving well. But I think this week he really played intelligent tennis and was truly an all-rounder. I even saw him hit a backhand slice down the line and come to net to finish off the volley. He stepped it up when he needed to and was very patient when necessary. He mixed up his serve very well and mixed up the pace of his shots very well.\\u201d\", \"After complaining of weariness and losing quickly to Medvedev in the semifinals of the Paris Masters indoors earlier this month, Zverev came back at him with conviction in Turin, losing in the round-robin in a third-set tiebreaker after holding a match point and then raising the bar on Sunday, reading the flow of play, including Medvedev\\u2019s increasingly desperate drop shots.\", \"\\u201cIt was almost like he used all his senses to play today,\\u201d Mischa Zverev said of his brother. \\u201cAs much as seeing the ball and feeling it when it touches the racket, he was literally trying to think a few steps ahead, trying to listen to the crowd and the way the opponent hits the ball, soaking up all the information he could get and using it to his advantage.\\u201d\", \"It was an impressive performance but Zverev, despite his big-bang game and capacity to charm in three languages, remains a divisive figure who is difficult for many spectators to fully embrace because of the ongoing tour investigation into his alleged physical violence against a former girlfriend, Olya Sharypova. Other sports might have suspended him until the resolution of such an investigation, but men\\u2019s tennis, lacking a clear policy until this year, has allowed him to keep playing (and keep winning).\", \"He has denied the allegations of abuse, made by Sharypova in media interviews, and said that he welcomes the inquiry so he can clear his name. He has said he has been able to play so well in 2021 because he knows the truth and is confident that he will eventually be vindicated. But his performance has been a display of compartmentalization, surely not as straightforward as Zverev has made it look.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m his brother, so I\\u2019ve always had faith and belief in him from the day he was born,\\u201d said Mischa Zverev, who is 10 years older and preceded him on tour. \\u201cBut yes, to win six tournaments, two Masters finals and Olympic gold, that\\u2019s a great year for anybody and especially with the things that were going on off the court, it\\u2019s more so impressive.\\u201d\", \"But there is a cost, both in lost sponsorship and lost support.\", \"\\u201cI think it\\u2019s affected him personally a lot more than he\\u2019s let on,\\u201d McEnroe said. \\u201cThese allegations hanging over him are very uncomfortable, and we can only hope it works out for everybody, including the young woman in this situation. But the larger issue for tennis if I put on my ESPN hat and former U.S.T.A. hat is that, let\\u2019s be honest, these young guys at the moment are not moving the needle for tennis the same way the older guys have. They are not selling tickets the first week of the U.S. Open the same way that Nadal, Federer and Djokovic have been doing.\\u201d\", \"There is an achievement gap, of course. Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Djokovic have been dueling for 15 years and have won 20 Grand Slam singles titles apiece. But there is also an appeal gap with Zverev\\u2019s off-court issues and with Stefanos Tsitsipas, fairly or unfairly, having to fend off accusations of gamesmanship this summer because of his extended off-court breaks during matches and taking criticism after saying he didn\\u2019t see a need for someone his age to get a Covid-19 vaccine, though he later said he planned to get the shot.\", \"For now, Medvedev seems the most broadly appealing of the lead pack: an unorthodox, occasionally contortionist player and creative conversationalist who engages with and sometimes confronts a crowd (as he did again in Turin) but generally with a twinkle in his eye.\", \"He senses the concern about the future of men\\u2019s tennis but knows his history. There were doomsayers when Bjorn Borg and John McEnroe retired, doomsayers when Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi retired, but along came new champions and rivalries that gathered gravitas.\", \"\\u201cTennis is a great sport, so I don\\u2019t see why our generation would miss on something,\\u201d Medvedev said. \\u201cOf course, maybe we don\\u2019t do 20 Grand Slams, yet nobody did before Roger, Rafa and Novak, so they were also worse than them if we can say like this. It\\u2019s definitely not going to be a shame.\\u201d\", \"For now, Medvedev, 25, has one major title, which came at this year\\u2019s U.S. Open where he stopped Djokovic\\u2019s Grand Slam attempt in the final. For now, Zverev has none and has yet to defeat a top-10 player in a Grand Slam tournament, but as he and his brother head to the Maldives for a break after a confidence-building season, Zverev is already flashing ahead to 2022.\", \"\\u201cMy gut tells me and not even my gut, my brain, my eyes, my senses tell me he has the talent and has everything needed to win a Grand Slam,\\u201d Mischa Zverev said. \\u201cI believe it will happen soon, but that it will never happen is also a possibility. I can\\u2019t predict the future, but I always believed he could be No. 1 and will win Grand Slams, and I still believe that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"65dba4794ca311ecaece7be0b9265bdb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"65dba4794ca311ecaece7be0b9265bdb"}},
