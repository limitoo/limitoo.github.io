He was pronounced dead later that day.\", \"Mujahid Abdul Halim, a member of the Nation of Islam, was arrested as he fled the ballroom. (He was known as Talmadge Hayer at the time and later as Thomas Hagan).\", \"Within two weeks, two other men were arrested and later indicted in the killing: Muhammad Abdul Aziz (formerly Norman 3X Butler) and Khalil Islam (known also as Thomas 15X Johnson).\", \"The trial over Malcolm X\\u2019s killing began on Jan. 22, and all three men took the witness stand to deny the accusations. But several weeks later, Mr. Halim testified a second time, telling jurors that he had been involved in the murder and that his two co-defendants were innocent. He declined to name the real killers.\", \"Still, the jury convicted all three men, and they were later sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.\", \"Mr. Halim filed two affidavits between 1977 and 1978 that detailed the logistics of the killing and reasserted his claim that his two co-defendants were innocent. He gave partial names of four members of a Nation of Islam mosque in Newark, N.J., saying they had been his partners in the assassination.\", \"A defense lawyer moved for the case to be reopened in light of new evidence, but a judge denied the motion.\", \"After Mr. Aziz\\u2019s attempts to be released on parole had been twice denied, his application was approved in 1985, and he was released after 20 years in prison, when he was 46 years old.\", \"Two years later, Mr. Islam was also granted parole. He died in 2009.\", \"Mr. Halim was released in 2010).\", \"The publication of Manning Marable\\u2019s \\u201cMalcolm X: A Life of Reinvention,\\u201d a best-selling biography that attempted to reshape the perception of Malcolm X\\u2019s legacy, spurred new calls for the Justice Department and the New York State attorney general to start full investigations into the assassination.\", \"Experts argued that a review could be conducted under a federal law that allows cold cases of violent crimes against Black people that predate 1970 to be reopened. But the calls for a new investigation went nowhere.\", \"The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., announced that he was beginning a preliminary review of the case as Netflix released a series that argued that Mr. Aziz and Mr. Islam could not have been at the Audubon Ballroom when Malcolm X was killed.\", \"\\u201cWho Killed Malcolm X?\\u201d explored the potential culpability of the four members of the Nation of Islam mosque in New Jersey mentioned in Mr. Halim\\u2019s affidavits. The episodes depicted the four men\\u2019s involvement as an open secret in the city.\"]","href_hash":"8d0816a247d611ec95eb5b776b545811"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8d0816a247d611ec95eb5b776b545811"}},
