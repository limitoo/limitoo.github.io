Shortly after he hops off the bike, he has a heart attack and dies.\", \"After the shocking ending, we couldn\\u2019t help but wonder: Are companies usually in the dark about how their products will be used in a movie or TV show, as Peloton reportedly was? What does the typical product-placement agreement look like? And if a company is particularly upset with how its product is portrayed, does it have any legal recourse?\", \"According to Nancy C. Prager, an intellectual property and entertainment lawyer, there are two types of product-placement agreements: one in which a company pays to be featured in show or movie, and another in which a production company procures a trademarked product to be used onscreen.\", \"Peloton declined to state on the record whether it was involved in any formal product-placement agreement, but if a production company wants to use a trademarked product, Ms. Prager said, it must get a special license to show the product and brand logos. (In the episode, the Peloton logo is clearly visible on Mr. Big\\u2019s bike, and the instructor video closely resembled a real Peloton course.)\", \"Ms. Prager explained that under trademark law, a principle known as nominative fair use allows production companies to use a trademark as long as the product is shown being used in a way consistent with the original trademark.\", \"\\u201cNominative fair use does not to apply, though, when you use the protected mark in a way that disparages the mark or the brand,\\u201d Ms. Prager said. HBO \\u201ctarnished Peloton\\u2019s good will to consumers,\\u201d she added, noting that Peloton products purport to make their customers stronger and healthier.\", \"\\u201cThe tarnish can be evidenced by the stock price plummeting,\\u201d she added, referring to the 11 percent drop in Peloton stock overnight after the episode aired. The stock\\u2019s value continued to fall on Friday.\", \"In Ms. Prager\\u2019s view, that means Peloton could reasonably consider litigation, especially if HBO did not disclose the story line involving the product.\", \"\\u201cIt was a misstep that Peloton wasn\\u2019t fully aware of the script,\\u201d said Stacy Jones, the chief executive and founder of Hollywood Branded, a marketing and branding agency in Los Angeles.\", \"Peloton did not know how the bike or its instructor Jess King would be featured in the show, according to a report in BuzzFeed News. Ms. Prager and Ms. Jones agree that withholding those details leaves HBO in murky legal territory.\", \"\\u201cThe production forgot that product placement is supposed to be mutually beneficial, and they did not put their thinking cap on about the damage that this would cause the brand,\\u201d Ms. Jones said.\", \"\\u201cThink of product placement as an alternative form of advertising,\\u201d David Schweidel, a professor of marketing at Emory University Goizueta Business School, said on Friday.\", \"In recent years, companies have been seeking out product-placement agreements more than ever, he said. The increased use of streaming platforms means viewers are seeing fewer commercials, driving companies to make greater use of product-placement deals to promote themselves.\", \"\\u201cIf I can\\u2019t reach my customer base with a traditional television commercial anymore, I take the product in the program itself,\\u201d Professor Schweidel said. \\u201cThen, they can\\u2019t avoid it.\\u201d\", \"He estimated that product-placement advertising was worth well over $20 billion in 2021.\", \"For production companies, the arrangements can be mutually beneficial, since featuring recognizable brands can make a show more realistic, Ms. Jones said.\", \"In this particular case, the inclusion of Peloton was integral to advancing a story line. \\u201cPeloton provided a solution to their problem,\\u201d she said.\", \"Usually when a company is so unhappy with how its product has been portrayed that the idea of litigation is floated, \\u201cTV shows claim that it\\u2019s a parody, that viewers obviously knew that this was fictional,\\u201d Beth L. Fossen, an assistant professor of marketing at the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University, said on Friday.\", \"That approach usually works for shows like \\u201cSaturday Night Live,\\u201d she said.\", \"But given that Peloton was the subject of unfavorable headlines this year about a child dying in an accident involving one of its treadmills, the story line may have \\u201chit a little too close to home\\u201d for that argument to work, Professor Schweidel said.\", \"At least for the time being, it seems that Peloton is uninterested in pursuing litigation. In a statement on Saturday, Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a cardiologist on Peloton\\u2019s health and wellness advisory council, noted that \\u201cMr. Big lived what many would call an extravagant lifestyle \\u2014 including cocktails, cigars and big steaks \\u2014 and was at serious risk as he had a previous cardiac event in Season 6.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Steinbaum said that Mr. Big\\u2019s lifestyle choices, perhaps in conjunction with a family history of heart disease, were most likely the cause of his death.\", \"In fact, she speculated, \\u201criding his Peloton bike may have even helped delay his cardiac event.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"61df9e4e5ad911ec94274d68bc9cfdf1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"61df9e4e5ad911ec94274d68bc9cfdf1"}},
