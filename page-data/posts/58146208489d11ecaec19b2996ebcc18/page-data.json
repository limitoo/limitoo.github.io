But skipping a bird doesn\\u2019t have to mean skipping gravy. Gravy is the great unifying force of the Thanksgiving table, essential to every side, from the mashed potatoes to the roasted vegetables.\", \"Eric Kim just shared a new recipe for his simple, delicious, make-ahead vegetarian gravy, and though he says the nutritional yeast is optional, please don\\u2019t skip it. Without the roasty-toasty bits of browned pan drippings, which give a traditional gravy its body and heft, you really do need to find other ways to build flavor.\", \"Nutritional yeast, made from the tiny crumbs of Brewer\\u2019s yeast, is no longer active, but it still carries an umami-rich flavor thanks to naturally occurring MSG. Just a tablespoon of the stuff will transform two cups of gravy, giving it serious depth. And it keeps for ages, which means you\\u2019ll be able to find other uses for the rest of the canister.\", \"Eric\\u2019s gravy recipe also calls for basic vegetable stock, but before you start your Thanksgiving cooking, it\\u2019s worth remembering that there are so many vegetarian stocks you can use when you\\u2019re making gravies, stuffings and other dishes, too.\", \"And if you\\u2019re really, really, really into making stock, you can make a Super Veg Stock by making kombu-mushroom broth using a fresh vegetable stock instead of water, and then whisking miso into it.\", \"But what about recipes for this week? Right now, I want David Tanis\\u2019s wobbly mapo tofu on hot white rice, or maybe Zainab Shah\\u2019s comforting sabzi: carrots, peas, cauliflower and potatoes in a spicy tomato dressing seasoned with ginger, garlic and toasted cumin seeds. Learn Zainab\\u2019s basic technique, and you can use any vegetables you like, adding in chard or fennel, cabbage or green beans, or swapping out peas for soybeans.\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"This way for more vegan and vegetarian Thanksgiving recipes. And if you haven\\u2019t been in charge of the meal before, spend a little time with this great guide, which walks you through the process of menu planning, how much food you need to cook per person, and more.\", \"And Eric wrote a beginner\\u2019s guide to cooking Thanksgiving, which has some great suggestions like cheesy pizza stuffing; mashed sweet potatoes with roasted garlic; green bean, artichoke and radicchio salad; and a gorgeous caramel apple pudding for dessert.\", \"Thanks for reading the Veggie and see you next week!
