Rubin, said that Mr. McMichael was trying to \\u201cde-escalate\\u201d a potentially violent situation when he pointed his shotgun at Mr. Arbery as he was sprinting toward him. And Mr. Rubin said that Mr. McMichael acted in self-defense when he pulled the trigger after Mr. Arbery turned toward him and the two men tussled.\", \"At that point, Mr. McMichael \\u201chas no choice, because if this guy gets his gun, he\\u2019s dead or his dad\\u2019s dead,\\u201d Mr. Rubin said, referring to Mr. McMichael\\u2019s father and fellow defendant Gregory McMichael. As a veteran of the U.S. Coast Guard, Travis McMichael was taught \\u201cnever lose your weapon. And that\\u2019s why he shoots,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Rubin\\u2019s opening remarks followed the prosecution\\u2019s opening statement, in which the lead prosecutor, Linda Dunikoski, said that it was Mr. Arbery who had been \\u201cunder attack\\u201d by the defendants. \", \"Mr. Rubin was the first of the three defense teams to offer an opening statement as the trial opened on Friday. Franklin Hogue, a lawyer for the elder Mr. McMichael, spoke next, echoing the argument that the defendants had acted in self-defense. Gregory McMichael, he said, was \\u201cin abject fear that he is about to witness his only son be shot.\\u201d A lawyer for the third defendant, William Bryan, deferred his statement until later in the trial.\", \"Mr. Rubin\\u2019s argument in favor of Travis McMichael\\u2019s innocence, rooted in the citizen\\u2019s arrest law and the principle of self-defense, had been widely expected.\", \"He spent the first part of his statement focusing on the break-ins and property crimes in Satilla Shores, the neighborhood where Mr. McMichael was living in his parents\\u2019 house. It was a neighborhood \\u201con edge,\\u201d Mr. Rubin said. Residents posted their concerns on social media. Some told their children not to play outside after dark. People put up security cameras. As a result, Mr. Rubin said, \\u201cpeople were alert to suspicious behavior.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Rubin noted that Mr. Arbery had been spotted via security cameras in a half-built house in Satilla Shores four times before the afternoon of Feb. 23, 2020, when he visited the house, sprinted away, and was soon chased by the three men in two trucks.\", \"In two cases, the owner of the house, Larry English, had called the police, but Mr. Arbery had vanished before they arrived. Mr. English, Mr. Rubin said, had been telling neighbors that a suspicious person had been visiting the house, and that items had been taken from a boat he sometimes kept on the property.\", \" Mr. Arbery\\u2019s fourth visit to the property \\u2014 in which he never seemed to do more than walk aroound \\u2014 occurred on the night of Feb. 11. That evening at around 7:30, Mr. McMichael left his house to fill up his car and saw a figure darting across the street, and then hiding in the shadows. It was a man, who eventually emerged from behind a portable toilet.\", \"Mr. McMichael aimed the headlights of his truck at the man and got out of his car to ask why he was there. Mr. Rubin said Mr. McMichael then saw the man reach into his waist, as if reaching for a weapon.\", \"So on the day of the confrontation and the killing, Mr. Rubin said, Mr. McMichael had probable cause to assume that a burglary had occurred \\u2014 thus giving him the right to make a citizen\\u2019s arrest \\u2014 and reason to suspect that Mr. Arbery might be armed, given the alleged movement of his hand toward his waistband on the night of Feb. 11. \", \"After the shooting, Mr. Rubin said, Mr. McMichael was \\u201cdistraught,\\u201d \\u201cupset\\u201d and covered in blood. \", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s no glee in having done what he just did. It\\u2019s awful,\\u201d he said.\", \"He asked the jurors to put aside their emotions and apply the law to the facts of the case: \\u201cThe only right verdict is not guilty on each and every count in the indictment.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Hogue, the attorney for Gregory McMichael, then walked jurors through the events of the February afternoon from his client\\u2019s point of view. The elder Mr. McMichael was sitting outside his home upholstering the seats to his truck when he saw Mr. Arbery \\u201csprinting\\u201d past his house, causing him to become convinced that Mr. Arbery was running \\u201caway from something or someone,\\u201d Mr. Hogue said. \", \"Certain that Mr. Arbery was the same man he had seen in videos from a neighbor whose boat had been burglarized, he yelled out to his son. The two got into Travis McMichael\\u2019s truck and chased Mr. Arbery with the sole intention of detaining him for police or identifying him, Mr. Hogue said.\", \"He noted that Travis McMichael was in the driver\\u2019s seat while his father sat atop his grandson\\u2019s car seat in the back, later moving to the bed of the truck where there was a toolbox he could sit on. \"]","href_hash":"70dd13923e7611ecaaa065220501d844"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"70dd13923e7611ecaaa065220501d844"}},
