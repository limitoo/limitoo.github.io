According to another affidavit, Mr. Halls had called out \\u201ccold gun,\\u201d indicating that the gun did not contain any live rounds, and handed it to Mr. Baldwin.\", \"But Mr. Halls\\u2019s lawyer, Lisa Torraco, contended in an interview with Martha MacCallum on Fox News that the main responsibility for checking the gun was with the film\\u2019s armorer, claiming that it was \\u201cnot the assistant director\\u2019s job.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhat I can tell you is that expecting an assistant director to check a firearm is like telling the assistant director to check the camera angle or telling the assistant director to check sound or lighting,\\u201d she said in the interview. \\u201cThat\\u2019s not the assistant director\\u2019s job. If he chooses to check the firearm because he wants to make sure that everyone\\u2019s safe, he can do that, but that\\u2019s not his responsibility.\\u201d\", \"The film\\u2019s director, Joel Souza, who was wounded in the shooting, later told a detective that the firearms were checked by the film\\u2019s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, and \\u201cthen the firearm is checked by the assistant director Dave Halls, who then gives it to the actor using the firearm,\\u201d according to another affidavit released as part of a search warrant application.\", \"Larry Zanoff, a veteran armorer whose past films include \\u201cDjango Unchained\\u201d and \\u201cFantastic Four,\\u201d said it was common practice on a film set for the first assistant director to be one of the people responsible for inspecting guns on set, including checking to make sure a gun is empty before the armorer hands it to an actor.\", \"The shooting on the set of \\u201cRust\\u201d killed Halyna Hutchins, an up-and-coming cinematographer.\", \"Since the shooting, public scrutiny has been largely focused on Mr. Halls and Ms. Gutierrez-Reed, because investigators reported that they handled the gun shortly before the incident. In an affidavit released by the sheriff\\u2019s department, a detective, Joel Cano, wrote that he learned that shortly before the shooting, Mr. Halls had picked the gun up from a gray cart that had been set up by Ms. Gutierrez-Reed and had taken it onto the set, where he handed it to Mr. Baldwin and yelled \\u201ccold gun.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Torraco disputed that chain of events in the Fox interview, saying, \\u201cThis idea that my client grabbed the gun off of a prop cart and handed it to Mr. Baldwin absolutely did not happen.\\u201d Ms. Torraco said she has heard differing accounts from crew members on set.\", \"She did not directly give her client\\u2019s account. \\u201cMy client went through something that was such a freak accident that he\\u2019s in shock,\\u201d Ms. Torraco said. \\u201cHe\\u2019s having a hard time sorting out what happened.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Halls has not responded to several requests for comment; Ms. Torraco\\u2019s office declined to comment last week and has not responded to several requests for comment this week.\", \"Mr. Halls has been the subject of complaints on previous film productions. In 2019, Mr. Halls was fired from a movie, \\u201cFreedom\\u2019s Path,\\u201d after a gun discharged unexpectedly on set, causing a minor injury to a crew member, its production company said. Ms. Torraco did not respond to a question in the Fox interview about the previous complaints.\", \"No criminal charges have been announced in the case, but the district attorney overseeing it, Mary Carmack-Altwies, has said that her office has not ruled them out. As details have emerged around a series of errors on set that preceded the fatal shooting, how a live round got into the revolver that Mr. Baldwin handled remains unclear.\"]","href_hash":"bfaed2bc3bfb11ecbd75000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bfaed2bc3bfb11ecbd75000017025a03"}},
