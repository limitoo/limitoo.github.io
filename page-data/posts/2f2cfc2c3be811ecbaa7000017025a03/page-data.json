Already the format for more than a few of the recent past\\u2019s most richly entertaining shows \\u2014 \\u201cBojack Horseman,\\u201d \\u201cBob\\u2019s Burgers,\\u201d \\u201cRick and Morty,\\u201d \\u201cArcher,\\u201d \\u201cTuca & Bertie\\u201d \\u2014 it has only gained momentum. New series arrive every week (and that\\u2019s not counting the quarterly infusion of anime), perhaps driven by a combination of evolving tastes and pandemic-induced production shifts.\", \"They can take the form of superhero and science-fiction genre stories, like Amazon Prime Video\\u2019s \\u201cInvincible,\\u201d HBO Max\\u2019s \\u201cGen:Lock\\u201d (premiering Thursday) or Adult Swim\\u2019s \\u201cBlade Runner: Black Lotus\\u201d (Nov. 13). Many still crop up in the broad category of wacky-family comedies, like Fox\\u2019s \\u201cThe Great North\\u201d or \\u201cThe Harper House\\u201d on Paramount+. Some lean into animation\\u2019s license for transgression, like Adult Swim\\u2019s \\u201cTeenage Euthanasia,\\u201d Netflix\\u2019s \\u201cChicago Party Aunt\\u201d or Tubi\\u2019s \\u201cThe Freak Brothers\\u201d (Nov. 14). Others, you suspect, might require too much courage to try to pull off with live actors, like \\u201cFairfax,\\u201d Amazon\\u2019s satire of teen influencers and hypebeast culture, or \\u201cQ-Force,\\u201d Netflix\\u2019s irreverent comedy about a cadre of L.G.B.T.Q. spies.\", \"Inspired by the return of Netflix\\u2019s \\u201cBig Mouth,\\u201d here are three excellent adult-animation series that take very different approaches to the same goal: Whether it\\u2019s through theatrical smuttiness, minimalist degradation or surreal fantasy, each has something to say about the real lives of young people.\", \"The most unrelentingly and entertainingly dirty show on the small screen returns with a fifth season on Friday. Like neurotic New Yorkers in a Sondheim musical, its adolescent characters are endlessly talkative when it comes to their obsessions: masturbation, the dimensions of the organs involved in masturbation, the likes and dislikes of the classmates they think about while they\\u2019re masturbating.\", \"The show continues to use the sexual and romantic panic of its perpetual middle schoolers as a frame for commentary that is earnest but mercifully unpedantic; early episodes of Season 5 take on subjects like body image and the shame-free universality of being a teenage perv. And the rapid-fire jokes are as sharp as those on many shows better known for their topical humor. (The budding activist Missy, voiced by Ayo Edebiri, leads a campaign against the school\\u2019s problematic mascot, the Scheming Gypsy.)\", \"Nick Kroll, a creator of the show, and John Mulaney give vivid life to the central characters, the neurotic nerd Nick and the brash nerd Andrew. But what sets \\u201cBig Mouth\\u201d apart is its collection of shaggy hormone monsters, sleek love bugs and other beings sent from an alternate dimension to help guide the human teenagers through their difficult years, spicing questionable advice with insults and raunchy one-liners. It\\u2019s as if adolescence had a particularly gamy lounge act as its soundtrack, a conceit made literal in the Shame Wizard, a master of dispensing shame because he can\\u2019t feel it himself; David Thewlis wraps the character in glorious layers of smarm. (Stream it on Netflix.)\", \"As coming-of-age allegories go, this recently completed anime series, on Funimation, is right on the nose. A school building suddenly drifts out of our world and is suspended in a black void; the 36 middle schoolers trapped inside must overcome their anxieties and jealousies and work together to find a way back, a process commonly known as growing up. The voyagers also acquire strange new powers, as teenagers tend to do. The coolest kid can fly; an antagonistic outsider can order whatever she wants from her own magical version of Amazon, and has to keep the community supplied with material goods.\", \"The challenges they face are also easy to parse as Japanese social critique: the student-council types institute rules that keep everyone constantly working; students who freeze in place like statues turn out to have disappeared into \\u201cTwin Peaks\\u201d-style curtained rooms where they can play video games or lift weights in solitude. (A girl is chastised for calling them hikikomori, the Japanese term for extreme recluses.) Western viewers won\\u2019t have too much trouble following along, even though the story is told in the elliptical, fragmentary style typical of science-fiction anime.\", \"A healthy appetite for teenage romanticism can get you through \\u201cSonny Boy\\u201d despite the middling writing, but the real reason to watch the 12-episode season is the striking animation overseen by the director Shingo Natsume \\u2014 minimalist but evocative in the character designs, and lusciously detailed and inventive in the psychedelic succession of worlds the travelers pass through. The animation studio Madhouse has a proud tradition in feature anime, and the work of Natsume and his artists (including the manga veteran Hisashi Eguchi) recalls some Madhouse landmarks: the elegant frenzy of Satoshi Kon\\u2019s \\u201cPaprika,\\u201d the languorous melancholy of Mamoru Hosoda\\u2019s \\u201cThe Girl Who Leapt Through Time.\\u201d (Stream it on Funimation.)\", \"In 2008 HBO premiered \\u201cThe Life and Times of Tim,\\u201d a roughly animated (the characters looked Etch A Sketched), quietly raunchy workplace cringe comedy that built a small but devoted following. Weighing the show\\u2019s insider cred against its paltry viewership, HBO canceled \\u201cTim\\u201d after two seasons, changed its mind, and then canceled it for good after Season 3.\", \"But that was before HBO Max, which is now the home of the first season of \\u201cTen Year Old Tom,\\u201d the writer and director Steve Dildarian\\u2019s follow-up to \\u201cThe Life and Times of Tim.\\u201d If you were part of the earlier series\\u2019 cult, you\\u2019ll be happy to know that \\u201cTom\\u201d is largely the same show. The animation and the dialogue are as crude as you remember, and the 10-year-old hero is a mini-Tim, downtrodden and subject to constant embarrassment but more bemused than upset. Being slightly more sane than everyone around him is no defense against the elaborate scenarios of humiliation that Dildarian constructs.\", \"Tom, voiced by Dildarian in a diffident monotone that slides into strangled alarm, is a wised-up Charlie Brown; he talks like an adult but his ignorance of things like condoms or how to start a fire without burning down the house gets him into trouble. His moral compass is wider than those of the adults around him, but he\\u2019s easily led astray. The cast of bad role models includes David Duchovny as a sketchy ice cream truck driver, Jennifer Coolidge (returning from \\u201cTim\\u201d) as the loudly entitled mother of one of Tom\\u2019s friends and a highly amusing John Malkovich as Mr. B, the tyrant in charge of band, yearbook, the spelling team and who knows what else at Tom\\u2019s school. (Stream it on HBO Max.)\"]","href_hash":"2f2cfc2c3be811ecbaa7000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2f2cfc2c3be811ecbaa7000017025a03"}},
