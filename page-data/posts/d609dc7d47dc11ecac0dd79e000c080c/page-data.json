bird habitat is back before federal Environment Minister Sussan Ley.\", \"The proposal to build the\\u00a0Turtle Cove Haven Retirement Village\\u00a0has been previously rejected\\u00a0on environmental grounds.\", \"The village would be built near the coast\\u00a0at River Heads, across the Great Sandy Strait from K'gari (Fraser Island) in Queensland's Wide Bay Burnett region.\", \"The Great Sandy Strait is a declared Ramsar site, meaning it contains\\u00a0wetlands recognised under\\u00a0a United Nations convention to be of international significance.\", \"But most importantly for conservationists, the sand flats next to the proposed development are a crucial feeding ground for famished eastern curlews at\\u00a0the end of\\u00a0their epic migration from as far away as Russia.\", \"Both BirdLife Australia and the Queensland Wader Study are opposing the\\u00a0latest proposed\\u00a0project, which is smaller and set further back from its previous iteration.\", \"BirdLife Australia's Andrew Hunter says the development\\u00a0will\\u00a0still impact the birds and is\\u00a0calling on the government to do everything in its\\u00a0power to protect the habitat.\", \"Mr Hunter says over 1,000 critically endangered eastern curlews have\\u00a0been seen roosting there.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Development\\u00a0proposal scaled back</div>\", \"The proposal to build the retirement village has been scaled down several times, with an original plan to build up to\\u00a0500\\u00a0independent living units\\u00a0later changed\\u00a0to less than half that.\", \"In rejecting that proposal in 2020,\\u00a0Ms\\u00a0Ley noted that the development would encroach on the\\u00a0250-metre buffer zone from the highest astronomical tide (HAT), which was deemed too close to the critically endangered eastern curlew habitat.\", \"Now a third plan consisting of 84 independent living units, an onsite sewage treatment plant and internal roads has been put to the federal Environment Department.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e0b099d366f18f7b326911b79a348e4b\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Eastern curlews migrate huge distances from China and Russia\\u00a0to Australia.(Getty Images: Ko Konno)</div>\", \"Because the developers have submitted a new plan, the Minister now needs to determine whether the new proposal will have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance.\", \"If that is deemed to be the case, the proposal will be declared a controlled action and assessed under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation\\u00a0Act.\", \"That could then result in strict conditions being put on the development, or in the development proposal being rejected again.\", \"According to the developer's (Anscape Pty Ltd) submission to the Minister,\\u00a0its\\u00a0latest proposal would now be \\\"located at a distance of 250 metres from [the highest astronomical tide]\\\".\", \"BirdLife Australia's Andrew Hunter\\u00a0says\\u00a0that's still too close.\", \"\\\"They've increased the buffer from 200 to 250 metres but we don't see that as being sufficient to alleviate the impacts on the birds.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Developers say project won't impact\\u00a0shorebirds</div>\", \"The eastern curlew (Numenius madagascariensis)\\u00a0is the world's largest migratory shorebird.\", \"It breeds in China and Russia, then migrates to Australia around August.\", \"Once considered abundant, global populations have crashed since the 1980s.\", \"On current trends, only\\u00a010 per cent of the bird's 1993 population levels will remain by 2035, according to the Threatened Species Recovery Hub.\", \"Loss of habitat at key migratory stopover points in the Yellow Sea is considered a major reason for the decline.\", \"But in Australia, coastal development is also considered a threat to the species.\", \"However, Anscape director Brian Clarke, who is trying to get permission to develop the site, says\\u00a0he is more than confident it can go ahead without impacting the birds.\", \"Mr Clarke says he has spent thousands on environmental assessments over nearly 10 years.\", \"\\\"We reduced [the number of units]\\u00a0to 250 and that was still knocked back. Then we did\\u00a0it to 190,\\u00a0even though\\u00a0we got the public environmental\\u00a0report\\u00a0[PER] done scientifically,\\\" he said.\", \"The environmental assessor who Mr Clarke employed to survey the site, Roger Currie of REMC, said a 100- to 150- metre buffer from the birds would be\\u00a0more than adequate.\", \"\\\"I spent five\\u00a0years studying the site. I observed the curlew behaviour for five\\u00a0years and I wrote a public environmental report\\u00a0which was\\u00a0a 1,400-page document,\\\" he said.\", \"Part of that research included flight initiation distance (FIDS) assessments, which involve\\u00a0creating disturbances and measuring the distance at which the birds take flight.\", \"\\\"We also did an experiment with a tractor and a slasher and the tractor could drive within 20 metres without disturbing the birds.\\\"\", \"Both Mr Currie and Mr Clarke said the 250-metre buffer was recommended to the minister by a researcher who hadn't visited the site.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Project has 'become a political football'</div>\", \"According to Mr Clarke, the problem was when he bought the property, there was an existing development approval on\\u00a0it.\", \"But in the meantime, the EPBC Act had come into force, meaning it was much more difficult to develop the property than he'd been led to believe.\", \"\\\"I bought it on the basis of the approvals that were given to me by the council,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"It's become a political football. I'm 78 now, I've had a couple of heart troubles. I'm just sick of fighting.\\\"\", \"Both Mr Clarke and Mr Currie\\u00a0also said they felt the project was being used as a scapegoat, while much bigger and potentially damaging projects were being approved.\", \"\\\"I think the Minister needed an example, given that Adani had just been approved, that she would be tough on EPBC referrals,\\\" Mr Currie said.\", \"\\\"If [the government]\\u00a0could approve a coal mine when the CSIRO said 'no, we're not confident you should go ahead with it', how can you knock back a little retirement village at River Heads?\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Weak' legislation can't protect Australian biodiversity</div>\", \"Even minor disturbances to the birds can cause major problems,\\u00a0according to ecologist and policy researcher April Reside from the University of Queensland.\", \"When they arrive after their migration from the northern hemisphere, they're famished and have little energy to flee or find food, she says.\", \"\\\"When they do these massive intercontinental migrations, they're so starving they're actually beginning to digest some of their [internal organs],\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"They're eating themselves from the inside out.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/9960f8607a51368bbd58cf54dfc87f51\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Many bird species in Australia, such as the black-throated finch, are dying a \\\"death of a thousand cuts\\\".(ABC North Queensland: Hannah Palmer)</div>\", \"Robert Bush from the Queensland Wader Study Group says the group is\\u00a0opposed to the development in its current form, and developers need to do\\u00a0more than the bare minimum to ensure habitats are protected.\", \"Development rejections under EPBC referral have been\\u00a0extremely rare since the Act\\u00a0came into force in 2000, according to Mr Bush.\", \"\\\"The EPBC Act 1999 is extremely weak,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"You can count on two hands the number of projects that have been turned down.\", \"Dr Reside says many bird species in Australia, such as the black-throated finch found around the Adani coal mine development,\\u00a0are dying a death of a thousand cuts.\", \"\\\"There are a bunch of birds in Australia\\u00a0that are endangered\\u00a0or critically endangered\\u00a0and one of the issues is they\\u00a0have a really large range\\u00a0they occupy,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"So the government\\u00a0looks and says 'this is a massive area, we'll just take away one little bit and then this little bit over here'.\\\"\", \"Mr Bush says it's\\u00a0a similar case for the eastern curlew.\", \"\\\"The two\\u00a0largest flocks in\\u00a0Australia are\\u00a0on the Great Sandy Strait where this area is, and in Moreton Bay.\", \"\\\"And both of these flocks are challenged by development:\\u00a0one in Toondah\\u00a0Harbour by the Walker Corporation and the other up there.\\\"\", \"But Mr Currie said the developers had done more than enough to get approval.\", \"\\\"This is the third referral and the third referral is based on the 250-metre buffer,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"There would be no reason for the Minister not to approve it this time.\\\"\", \"A decision on whether the proposal will be a controlled action requiring assessment under the EPBC Act is expected to be made on November 23, a spokesperson for Ms\\u00a0Ley said.\", \"\\\"The Minister will receive a detailed departmental report before forming a view,\\\" they said.\"]","href_hash":"d609dc7d47dc11ecac0dd79e000c080c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d609dc7d47dc11ecac0dd79e000c080c"}},
