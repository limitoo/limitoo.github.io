Bush. \\\"I join the international community in condemning Vladimir Putin's unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine. The American government and people must stand in solidarity with Ukraine and the Ukrainian people as they seek freedom and the right to choose their own future. We cannot tolerate the authoritarian bullying and danger that Putin poses.\\\"\", \"Former President Barack Obama said Russia launched an attack on Ukraine \\\"not because Ukraine posed a threat to Russia, but because the people of Ukraine chose a path of sovereignty, self-determination, and democracy.\\\"\", \"\\\"For some time now, we have seen the forces of division and authoritarianism make headway around the world, mounting an assault on the ideals of democracy, rule of law, equality, individual liberty, freedom of expression and worship, and self-determination,\\\" Obama said. \\\"Russia's invasion of Ukraine shows where these dangerous trends can lead \\u2013 and why they cannot be left unchallenged.\\\"\", \"Obama urged Americans, regardless of party, to support Mr. Biden's efforts to sanction Russia.\\u00a0\", \"Obama critics pointed out that in a 2012 presidential debate, he appeared to mock then-candidate Mitt Romney for calling Russia the biggest geopolitical threat.
