But it still is unusual for many families, involving some combination of antigen tests, outdoor meals (where the weather allows) and underlying anxiety.\", \"With that mind, my colleagues and I put together a brief history of Thanksgiving celebrations since the 1850s, focusing on unusual years like this one. Farther down in today\\u2019s newsletter, you\\u2019ll also find last-minute cooking tips, suggestions for holiday television and more.\", \"However you spend the day, we hope it\\u2019s a good one. We want to say thanks specifically to two groups of people: first, to everybody who\\u2019s working today (including our colleagues putting out The Times and delivering the print edition); and, second, to all of you \\u2014 the readers of The Morning. We are grateful that you make time in your day for this newsletter.\", \"The first appearance of the word \\u201cthanksgiving\\u201d in The Times digital archives \\u2014 which go back to 1851 \\u2014 did not refer to the holiday. It instead was a reference on Oct. 4, 1851, to \\u201can appropriate prayer and thanksgiving\\u201d from a reverend at the opening of the Queens County\\u2019s annual agricultural exhibition.\", \"\\u201cThursday was quite a jubilee in the pleasant village of Jamaica, Long Island,\\u201d an unnamed reporter for The New York Daily Times wrote. \\u201cThe ruddy, manly appearance of the farmers, and the freshness, delicacy, and real natural loveliness of their wives and daughters, (for which the county is justly renowned,) were sights to cheer and amaze the citizen, and many were there to witness and enjoy them.\\u201d\", \"The first mention of the holiday occurred less than a week later, in a brief news item reporting that the governor of Massachusetts had declared Thursday, Nov. 27, 1851, as \\u201ca day of public thanksgiving and praise.\\u201d There was no national Thanksgiving holiday at the time.\", \"As other states announced when they would also be observing the holiday that year, The Times printed an infographic \\u2014 of questionable value \\u2014 on Oct. 31, 1851:\", \"The origin story of Thanksgiving that\\u2019s often told in school \\u2014 of a friendly meal between pilgrims and Native Americans \\u2014 is inaccurate. (As far back as 1974, The Times ran an article describing the holiday as a \\u201cnational day of mourning\\u201d for many Native people.)\", \"The real origin of the national holiday dates to Abraham Lincoln. On Oct. 3, 1863, he called for the country, \\u201cin the midst of a civil war of unequaled magnitude and severity,\\u201d to set aside the last Thursday in November as \\u201ca day of Thanksgiving.\\u201d The Times published his Thanksgiving proclamation on the front page, and several times subsequently.\", \"While reciting the country\\u2019s many blessings \\u2014 a productive economy, bountiful harvests and a growing economy \\u2014 Lincoln also recommended that Americans give thanks \\u201cwith humble penitence for our national perverseness and disobedience.\\u201d\", \"Lincoln\\u2019s proclamation was in part a response to Sarah Josepha Hale, an editor who had spent decades campaigning for a national day of gratitude.\", \"Like this year\\u2019s version, Thanksgiving in 1918 occurred in the midst of a global pandemic. But the atmosphere was surprisingly joyous. World War I had ended on Nov. 11, and the country was celebrating, despite a horrific number of influenza deaths in October. During the weeks leading up to Thanksgiving, Times articles contained relatively few mentions of the so-called Spanish flu.\", \"\\u201cThanksgiving Day this year will evoke a gratitude deeper, a spirit of reverence more devout, than America has felt for many years,\\u201d a Times editorial on Nov. 19 said.\", \"One factor may have been that the pandemic briefly receded that November, before surging again at the end of the year. As has happened over the past two years, a virus ebbed and flowed in mysterious ways.\", \"By 1930, the country\\u2019s mood was much darker. A front-page headline on Thanksgiving Day that year reported: \\u201c450 Tons of Food Given to Needy, But Supply Fails.\\u201d The police turned away elderly men and women to reserve the food for families with young children.\", \"The Times also reported that the Thanksgiving tradition of ragamuffins \\u2014 in which children would dress up and go door to door asking for coins or treats \\u2014 seemed to be fading in Manhattan. \\u201cThings ain\\u2019t the way they used to be,\\u201d a police officer said.\", \"In 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to spark the economy by moving Thanksgiving one week earlier, to create a longer Christmas shopping season. Critics mocked the policy as \\u201cFranksgiving,\\u201d and it failed. Roosevelt announced in 1941 that he was abandoning the experiment for the next year.\", \"Roosevelt ultimately settled on the fourth Thursday of the month \\u2014 a middle ground that made sure the holiday would not occur later than Nov. 28 and that Christmas shopping could always begin in November.\", \"Thanksgiving in 1963 came only six days after the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and most public celebrations were canceled. The Macy\\u2019s parade was an exception, The Times reported, because the organizers felt its cancellation would be \\u201ca disappointment to millions of children.\\u201d\", \"The Kennedys gathered at the family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass., but they skipped their usual game of touch football. \\u201cLike millions of other Americans, they will give the day over to the children and mourn together their loss,\\u201d The Times wrote.\", \"The Covid-19 pandemic arguably caused a bigger break in Thanksgiving traditions than anything that came before. Since Lincoln\\u2019s proclamation, even during war, depression and tragedy, most Americans still found ways to gather with family and friends for a holiday meal.\", \"But the threat from a pandemic \\u2014 better understood in 2020 than it had been in 1918 \\u2014 caused many people to stay home last year.\", \"Today will be different. The pandemic is not over, but the worst of it almost certainly is. Vaccines have allowed most Americans to gather safely.\", \"The country is hardly in a joyous mood. Even as people are happy to be together again, many are mourning the losses of the past two years and deeply worried about the country\\u2019s future. Yet mixed feelings are also part of the Thanksgiving tradition, all the way the back to Lincoln\\u2019s proclamation.\", \"More on the holiday: For Rafael Alvarez \\u2014 a writer for \\u201cThe Wire\\u201d \\u2014 today is a chance to remember his father\\u2019s penknife and his parents\\u2019 Baltimore dreams.\", \"Beijing is now going after Hong Kong\\u2019s universities, Shui-yin Sharon Yam and Alex Chow write.\", \"The guilty verdicts in the Arbery case are a welcome respite, Charles Blow writes.\", \"Rich: Kanye West created a jacket for Gap.

Because of the pandemic, there were no spectators, the route spanned only one block and thousands fewer participants marched.\", \"This year, the parade is almost all the way back: About 6,500 people will be working on it, up from 960 last year. The number of giant balloons and floats is back to roughly what it was two years ago. And 10 marching bands, many of which couldn\\u2019t travel last year, will fill the streets.\", \"There is one caveat: No kids under 12 will participate. Everyone in the parade must be fully vaccinated, but children 5 to 11 were eligible for their first shots only a few weeks ago. (They can still watch; spectators have no vaccination requirement.)\", \"Their absence will be curious in an event whose stars have included Pikachu, SpongeBob SquarePants and Shrek. \\u201cThis year, the young people waving from floats will be vaccinated tweens and teens \\u2014 so viewers can perhaps expect less unadulterated joy and wide-eyed wonder,\\u201d The Times\\u2019s Julia Jacobs writes.\", \"The televised parade will feature the Rockettes, Carrie Underwood, Mickey Guyton, Kristin Chenoweth, Jon Batiste and Nelly. It starts at 9 a.m. Eastern, and you can watch it on NBC, Telemundo or the Peacock streaming service. \\u2014 Sanam Yar, a Morning writer\", \"Skip brining, stuffing, trussing and basting with this turkey recipe.
