Mr. Averett, 29, grew up on a cattle ranch in Baker City, Ore., and spent his days hiking, camping and skiing. \\u201cHe loves a good rodeo,\\u201d said Ms. Seals, 28, a native of Chino Hills, Calif., who said she \\u201cwent to private school, played volleyball and worried about homecoming.\\u201d\", \"Their first date happened a week after they matched on Bumble, at Oddfellows Caf\\u00e9 and Bar in Seattle, where both were living at the time. Ms. Seals, who earned a bachelor\\u2019s degree in nursing from Seattle University, was working as a nurse at Highline Medical Center, now St. Anne Hospital, in Burien, Wash. Mr. Averett, a graduate of Macalester College, was an officer with the Seattle Police Department.\", \"That date was the first of three they had in three consecutive days. \\u201cWe were feeling each other pretty quickly,\\u201d Ms. Seals said, and the two made time for one another despite their conflicting schedules. \\u201cI was working nights; Elliott was working days,\\u201d she said.\", \"Said Mr. Averett, \\u201cI told Rachel I loved her a month into dating.\\u201d Less than a year into the relationship, a tragedy struck that led them to become even closer.\", \"On Sept. 4, 2017, Mr. Averett\\u2019s mother, a former detective with the Seattle Police Department, suffered an accident on the family\\u2019s cattle ranch in Baker City, Ore. She was kicked by a cow, and the injury was fatal. \\u201cIt was a freak kind of thing,\\u201d Mr. Averett said.\", \"Afterward, Ms. Seals recalled him telling her over the phone, \\u201cMy mom is dead.\\u201d\", \"[Click here to binge read this week\\u2019s featured couples.]\", \"\\u201cI honestly thought it was remarkable that Rachel didn\\u2019t bail on me,\\u201d Mr. Averett said. \\u201cI was a total wreck.\\u201d That same year, Mr. Averett and Ms. Seals each lost a grandmother; Ms. Seals\\u2019s family dog passed away, too. \\u201cIt was like someone was dunking our heads under water and we just couldn\\u2019t get back up for air,\\u201d Ms. Seals said.\", \"A bright spot came a couple of years later, on May 21, 2019, when Mr. Averett proposed on the back patio of the cafe where they had their first date. A few months later, the couple moved to Silver Spring, Md. Ms. Seals is now a labor and delivery nurse at George Washington University Hospital. Mr. Averett is finishing his third year at Georgetown University Law Center.\", \"\\u201cI wanted to be a police officer because my mom had done it,\\u201d he said, but, \\u201cI\\u2019ve always wanted to go to law school.\\u201d\", \"Their wedding on Jan. 8 took place at Padua Hills Theatre in Claremont, Calif. At the ceremony, which was held in an outdoor gazebo, Douglas Raguso-Hove, Mr. Averett\\u2019s former sergeant who was ordained by the Universal Life Church, officiated before about 125 vaccinated guests.\", \"The indoor reception that followed included a fog machine, a smoke machine and glow sticks and headbands handed out by the D.J. \\u2014 accessories the couple happened to be wearing for their impromptu cutting of the cake.\", \"\\u201cWhen we set out planning, my one goal for our wedding was, \\u2018Let\\u2019s have a party,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Seals said. \\u201cAfter dinner it was like, \\u2018Now it\\u2019s a party.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"For Mr. Averett, the celebration had been a long time coming. He had been certain he wanted to marry Ms. Seals since late 2018, when Mr. Raguso-Hove had asked him if he thought he could live without her, and, he said, \\u201cI knew the answer was no.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"17c45a447ff911ecb7240b41c070d58c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"17c45a447ff911ecb7240b41c070d58c"}},
