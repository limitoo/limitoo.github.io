It\\u2019s been a shock to my system.\\u201d\", \"Speaking over the phone from her home in Los Angeles\\u2019s Beachwood Canyon, where she\\u2019s spent the morning immersed in prayer and deep stretching, she explains that her new mantra, which prioritizes calm and adaptability over unnecessary stress, was born out of a gathering of her friends at the start of 2021 at which they each shared their vision for the year ahead. As it turned out, it was just the shift in thinking she needed. During the first half of the year, as Los Angeles grappled with Covid-19 and lockdown measures, she not only began working on the fifth and final season of \\u201cInsecure\\u201d but also released the humorous self-help book \\u201cBamboozled by Jesus: How God Tricked Me Into the Life of My Dreams.\\u201d While tackling these two career-defining projects, Orji discovered she had no choice but to carefully distinguish between things she could feasibly achieve and things she could not. Especially when, on account of pandemic safety protocols, the filming schedule for \\u201cInsecure\\u201d stretched from three to six months. \\u201cI think I would\\u2019ve killed myself trying to do everything,\\u201d she says. Instead, she adapted and even found creative ways to enjoy herself: In late May she rented a Bentley for a week and hand-delivered copies of her book to stores around Los Angeles (\\u201cI said, \\u2018Hey, let\\u2019s look back on this when it\\u2019s all done and really have some good memories.\\u2019\\u201d)\", \"Still, the last hurrah for the \\u201cInsecure\\u201d cast and production team, a notably diverse group of collaborators amid the prevailing whiteness of Hollywood, did feel slightly dampened. For the final season, the show relied heavily on separate filming units to tackle multiple story lines at once and Orji recalls unexpectedly bumping into other cast members in between scenes, having been unaware that they were also shooting that day. \\u201cThey\\u2019d be like, \\u2018Well, yes, I\\u2019m here, but I\\u2019m kind of not here,\\u2019\\u201d she says. The method changed the behind-the-scenes atmosphere of the ensemble series \\u2014 which has received 11 Emmy nominations to date \\u2014 and Orji recalls thinking to herself, \\u201cThis is not how I want us to go out!\\u201d\", \"Self-reflection and spirituality color every aspect of Orji\\u2019s life. When asked how she manages the professional demands of Hollywood, she describes embarking on hourlong walks near her home and chatting with a higher power: \\u201cI\\u2019m like, \\u2018I\\u2019m really proud of who I\\u2019m becoming, whatchu think?\\u2019\\u201d This summer, she spoke with the model Hailey Bieber on her YouTube channel, which has over a million subscribers, about reconciling faith and the world of entertainment, two seemingly disparate spheres, with the pair covering on-screen nudity and sex. At one point, expressing frustration with the intense focus on the latter, for different reasons, in both realms, Orji confidently proclaims, \\u201cBeing a virgin is not the best thing about me!\\u201d\", \"She employs a similar brand of casual confessional within her stand-up comedy, unpacking with verve and wit the complexities of coming of age in the suburbs of Maryland and Pennsylvania as the daughter of Nigerian immigrants (her mother features in the joke she shares with T in the video above). It\\u2019s an approach that often calls to mind the work of Hasan Minhaj and Trevor Noah, who also extract material from their experiences at the center of cultural crossroads, but Orji\\u2019s poignant observations and sharp explorations of Black womanhood are entirely her own. \\u201cAs a child of immigrants and as the only girl of four children, my voice was stifled growing up,\\u201d she tells me. Then she chuckles. \\u201cBut it didn\\u2019t stop me from using it.\\u201d Last year, she achieved the comedian\\u2019s dream: an HBO stand-up special. Titled \\u201cMomma, I Made It!,\\u201d the show weaves together sections from an hourlong set Orji performed at the Howard Theatre in Washington, D.C., with scenes from a pilgrimage she made in 2019 to Nigeria, where she visited her grandfather\\u2019s village, conducted on-the-street interviews with passers-by (had they heard of \\u201cYvonne Orji the actress\\u201d? Cue blank stares) and perfected the art of market haggling. \\u201cThat was my love letter to the immigrant struggle, the immigrant hustle, the immigrant sacrifice,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt was important to me because I knew it would be important to my parents.\\u201d\", \"Orji\\u2019s original plan was to become a doctor. But she is quick to admit that her heart wasn\\u2019t fully in it. \\u201cI would have been a horrible doctor,\\u201d she says, all three syllables of \\u201chorrible\\u201d stretched out to their fullest comedic potential. Even the idea of surgery makes her queasy. \\u201cI was hopefully going to just talk to you and your pain would go away,\\u201d she says jokingly. In 2006, she found her true calling, though, while preparing for a Miss Nigeria beauty pageant and deciding to try stand-up for the talent section. \\u201cI started discovering my funny from that moment on,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI realized it wasn\\u2019t a fluke or a one-time thing. Then I was like, \\u2018How do you make a life out of this?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"She spent the following years performing wherever she could: fashion shows, wedding receptions, baby showers. In 2009, she moved to New York to pursue comedy in earnest, working a temp job during the day and doing stand-up at night. Then, six years later, she was cast in \\u201cInsecure\\u201d with, as she has described in past interviews, \\u201cno agent, no manager and no experience.\\u201d She nevertheless secured an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series this year.\", \"Soon, our conversation turns to the changing landscape of Hollywood, where directors \\u2014 including Michaela Coel, Ava DuVernay, Shonda Rhimes and, of course, Issa Rae, one of the creators of \\u201cInsecure\\u201d \\u2014 seem to be spearheading a renaissance of sorts for Black creatives. Orji is hopeful but careful with her words. \\u201cWe\\u2019re getting what we probably always should\\u2019ve been getting,\\u201d she says.\", \"The fifth season of \\u201cInsecure\\u201d will premiere on Oct. 24, but Orji has already said farewell to the character who changed her life. She recalls filming the show\\u2019s final episode, which was written by Rae herself, and becoming emotional: \\u201cI looked at Issa and said, \\u2018You wrote the heck out of this episode.\\u2019 I knew it even as we were filming.\\u201d What\\u2019s next? For now, Orji is still trying to approach things with a sense of ease, and not putting pressure on herself to find \\u201cthe next great role.\\u201d But about one thing she is certain: She wants to play a superhero one day. When asked if she would prefer to enter the noirish world of the D.C. films or the sprawling Marvel Universe, she almost answers but stops herself, letting a thick pause hang in the air. Then she says, only half-jokingly, \\u201cWhoever calls first and gives me the bigger bag.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8b7ccd5841f711ec9b3a000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8b7ccd5841f711ec9b3a000017025a03"}},
