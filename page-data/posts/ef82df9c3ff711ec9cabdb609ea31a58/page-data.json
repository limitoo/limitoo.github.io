The congresswoman discussed the right-wing conspiracy theories about the assault during an interview with Fox News Sunday on Sunday, calling them \\\"dangerous.\\\"\", \"She said there was no truth \\\"at all\\\" to claims that liberals or the \\\"deep state\\\" coordinated the January 6 attack to set up Trump supporters.\", \"\\\"It's the same kind of thing that you hear from people who say that 9/11 was an inside job, for example,\\\" Cheney pointed out.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927781/liz-cheney.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Representative Liz Cheney (R-Wyoming) said it's \\\"un-American\\\" to suggest that the January 6 attack on the Capitol was a \\\"false flag\\\" operation.

Its trailer promised to tell the \\\"true story behind\\\" January 6. A commentator in the program suggested that the attack was a \\\"false flag\\\" operation.\", \"Cheney quickly condemned Carlson and Fox News for allowing that show to broadcast.\", \"\\\"It appears that @FoxNews is giving @TuckerCarlson a platform to spread the same type of lies that provoked violence on January 6. As @FoxNews knows, the election wasn't stolen and January 6 was not a 'false flag' operation,\\\" the congresswoman tweeted on October 28.\", \"Carlson later defended his special before it began to stream on Fox Nation on November 1.

Cheney was ousted in May from her role as chair of the House Republican Conference and is facing a 2022 primary opponent backed by Trump.\", \"Along with GOP Representative Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, Cheney is one of two Republicans serving on the House selection committee investigating the assault against the legislative branch. Cheney and Kinzinger have faced criticism from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican, for their involvement in the probe. Additionally, pro-Trump GOP House members have called Cheney and Kinzinger \\\"spies for the Democrats.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"ef82df9c3ff711ec9cabdb609ea31a58"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ef82df9c3ff711ec9cabdb609ea31a58"}},
