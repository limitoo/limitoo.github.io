The judge denied bond after prosecutors called video of the shooting \\\"horrific\\\" and said the suspect \\\"methodically and deliberately walked down the hallway aiming the firearm at students and firing.\\\"  \", \"The suspect could face additional charges, McDonald said. Prosecutors are also considering filing charges against his parents. Police said the teen's father purchased the gun just days prior to the shooting. McDonald declined to comment on whether the suspect took the gun or whether it was given to him illegally.\", \"McDonald said there's evidence that suggests \\\"this was not just an impulsive act,\\\" and that it was planned \\\"well before the incident.\\\" \", \"\\\"We've charged four counts of first-degree murder, which requires premeditation,\\\" she said. \\\"And I am absolutely sure after reviewing the evidence that it wasn't even a close call. It was absolutely premeditated.\\\" \", \"Police said they responded to Oxford High School just before 1 p.m. on Tuesday after receiving reports of an active shooter on the premises. The suspected shooter, who was identified as a sophomore at the school, fired at least 30 rounds, police said. He voluntarily surrendered to police and was taken into custody within minutes, officials said. \", \"Authorities have not yet determined a motive for the shooting. \", \"Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said Wednesday that when authorities encountered the suspect, he was walking down a hallway with 18 rounds left, seven in his pocket and the rest in a magazine. \", \"\\\"With this much ammunition still with him... the quick actions of the school and the lockdown, as well as the deputies going to the danger, saved lives,\\\" he said.  \", \"Bouchard said the school had contact with the suspect the day before the shooting regarding \\\"concerning\\\" behavior, and that his parents were brought in the day of the shooting for a meeting. Bouchard did not say what the \\\"concerning\\\" behavior was but said there were no school records of the suspect being bullied. \", \"The four deceased victims have been identified as 14-year-old Hana St. Juliana, 17-year old Madisyn Baldwin, 17-year-old Justin Shilling and 16-year old Tate Myre. Seven others were wounded in the shooting, including a 47-year-old teacher at the school, which is about 45 minutes north of Detroit. The sheriff said it did not appear that the students were specifically targeted.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"0c15ef4a536d11ec8431677512b10b72"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0c15ef4a536d11ec8431677512b10b72"}},
