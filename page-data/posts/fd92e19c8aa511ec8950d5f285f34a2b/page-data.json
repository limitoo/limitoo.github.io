But the original songs shine.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-02-10T19:19:28.000Z","content":"[\"Rarely are romantic comedies titled more desperately than \\u201cMarry Me.\\u201d There is something pleasing about the bluntness. And because it\\u2019s a command that involves Jennifer Lopez, we\\u2019re permitted to skate atop the movie\\u2019s despair. But the ice is thin. Lopez has rarely stayed emotionally still long enough to luxuriate in moods less emphatic than \\u201cI will\\u201d and \\u201cI do.\\u201d Her comedies argue for restlessness as a quest for true stability: The right man soothes her nerves, dispels her doubts, restores her worth. But none of those movies has been as point-blank as this new one, whose original source is a punky graphic novel.\", \"The pop star she\\u2019s playing, Kat Valdez, has agreed to a stunt wedding during a live concert (and before a presumed online audience of 20 million) with her pop star boyfriend, Bastian. Within minutes of the ceremony, Kat discovers that he\\u2019s been messing around with one of her assistants but she decides to wed someone and picks the divorced dad (Owen Wilson) holding a \\u201cmarry me\\u201d sign in the crowd. Lopez performs this choice so lifelessly yet with such automatic determination that it\\u2019s fair to classify the sign as a cue card.\", \"This brand-new relationship is Kat\\u2019s way of mourning her suddenly old one. Introspection and grief never cross her mind. \\u201cWhy do I pick the wrong guy?\\u201d is as inward as things get. Amazingly, the next day, she endorses sticking with the brand logic of the marriage while doing yoga in her soulless high-rise home. She couldn\\u2019t have selected a blander, less objectionable stranger for a husband than Charlie Gilbert. He teaches middle-school math, co-parents one of those only-in-a-movie preteens (she\\u2019s spunky yet unsure of herself) and speaks in Wilson\\u2019s drawling whine.\", \"Charlie dislikes the demands of Kat\\u2019s celebrity. \\u201cHer entire life is sponsored,\\u201d he cries, upon watching her shoot a post for Vitamix. But he concedes to the arrangement because, it seems, the daughter (Chloe Coleman), a big Kat Valdez fan, will finally believe her dad likes fun. He never sits her down to talk about fun\\u2019s downsides. Does she know why he and her mom aren\\u2019t together? How aware is she that Kat\\u2019s been married three other times and that one of those marriages lasted for two days? It doesn\\u2019t matter because this movie vows to satisfy all involved parties.\", \"Does \\u201cinvolved\\u201d include me? I just kept counting the missed opportunities. Once, at about the halfway point, Charlie bets Kat that she can\\u2019t give up her accouterments of affluence and live like, say, Jenny from the block. Yet what Kat requests in exchange is so \\u2026 puny \\u2014 for Charlie to open some social media accounts \\u2014 that I hurt for her imagination. (That\\u2019s his daughter\\u2019s version of proof of life.) There\\u2019s a movie in that premise, nonetheless. Maybe even some stakes: Kat may yet discover where she keeps the wine glasses and how to properly use a Vitamix (they\\u2019re called lids, Kat.) And, online, Charlie might meet a woman who dreams of even more for him. And hopefully, Lopez would play her, too.\", \"She has her moments as Kat. They\\u2019re mostly physical: mincing down a school hallway in formfitting, scarlet couture under a parka; uttering the word \\u201cPeoria\\u201d then appearing there, as if the mother ship abandoned her. Here is a star who\\u2019s been performing for so long that performance is all, as an actor, she knows. If Kat isn\\u2019t teaching Charlie\\u2019s math students how to dance in order to calm their pre-competition jitters, she\\u2019s luring them into singing one of her hits at a school formal. This is Lopez\\u2019s best mode, and she\\u2019s always known it.\", \"But rather than indulge her stardom and its candy shell, the movie, which Kat Coiro directed from a screenplay credited to three writers, seems to apologize for them. Kat wishes for a kind of pedestrian normalcy, a common prayer of princesses in everything from the delight of \\u201cRoman Holiday\\u201d and \\u201cNotting Hill\\u201d to the despondence of \\u201cBeyond the Lights\\u201d and \\u201cSpencer.\\u201d \\u201cMarry Me,\\u201d though, has an awkward, translucent ply. Kat\\u2019s discography includes a catchy convolution whose chorus is \\u201cI am the love of, the love of my life.\\u201d\", \"So many parallels exist between Lopez\\u2019s character and what, in reality, we know Lopez has withstood that the movie all but doubles as one of those brand-burnishing docu-selfies, right down to a crowd-pleasing retreat into the arms of a white suitor after someone charismatic and brown has let her down. The Colombian singer Maluma plays Bastian; he\\u2019s a bag of cuddles here, masquerading as a red flag. At some point, Kat even notes that she\\u2019s never been nominated for anything. (The happiest we see her in the whole movie is on Grammy nomination day.)\", \"The original songs are the best things in the movie. Those, and the two or three scenes in which Sarah Silverman \\u2014 as Charlie\\u2019s sidekick and, somehow, a school guidance counselor \\u2014 appears to abandon a script that it pained me to watch her obey. The pain extends to Lopez. I spend her movies waiting for the moments in which she seems most relaxed and least forced, when the effort has fallen away and the person she\\u2019s playing is free to do and be and feel. \\u201cMarry Me\\u201d is a sad tale that\\u2019s too busy leaping from plot point to plot point for Lopez to express anything close to real. It tells a lot and shows nothing.\", \"I keep referring to her and Kat as entertainers, which, of course, they are. But what Lopez performs here \\u2014 what she\\u2019s frequently performing \\u2014 is the business of entertainment. She\\u2019s the star as executive, and all she often lets us see is execution. (Kat\\u2019s truest friend is her manager, an efficient Englishman, whom John Bradley plays with persuasive concern.) Kat and Charlie don\\u2019t meet much of each other\\u2019s families. And the movie denies them any chance to explore the weirdness of this relationship. He\\u2019s something Kat must do \\u2014 although not carnally, never that; we just get a morning after in which she\\u2019s long removed herself from his bed and is taking work calls. Which is fine. But don\\u2019t call this love when all we see is task management.\"]","href_hash":"fd92e19c8aa511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fd92e19c8aa511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
