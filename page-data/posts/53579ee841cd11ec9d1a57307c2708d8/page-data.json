The committee also demanded information from Mr. Trump's personal assistant, two of his special assistants, his deputy chief of staff and White House personnel director on January 6.\", \"\\\"The select committee wants to learn every detail of what went on in the White House on January 6th and in the days beforehand,\\\" Congressman Bennie Thompson, the committee's chair, said in a statement. \\\"We need to know precisely what role the former president and his aides played in efforts to stop the counting of the electoral votes and if they were in touch with anyone outside the White House attempting to overturn the outcome of the election.\\\"\", \"Thompson said that the committee was seeking information from Miller because the former senior advisor to the president said he was part of efforts to spread false information about alleged election fraud and to convince state legislatures to change the results. \\u00a0\", \"Documents obtained by the select committee show that Molly Michael, one of Mr. Trump's former special assistants, forwarded an email to former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Clark with talking points about unsubstantiated claims of voting irregularities and forwarded other emails aimed at overturning the election results, Thompson wrote in a letter informing her the committee was issuing her a subpoena.\", \"Several of those who were sent subpoenas were near Mr. Trump on the Ellipse on January 6 as he rallied supporters on January 6, including Miller, McEnany, former special assistant to the president Cassidy Hutchinson and former White House personnel director John McEntee.\\u00a0\", \"The full list of people subpoenaed Tuesday are:\", \"The flurry of subpoenas follows a half dozen the committee issued Monday as it ramps up its investigation into why and how a group of Trump supporters broke into the Capitol and delayed the certification of the election.\\u00a0\", \"The committee demanded records and depositions from the latest batch by late November and early December.
