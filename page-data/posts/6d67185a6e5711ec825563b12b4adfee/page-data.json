The Border Force could not be reached for comment.\", \"Tennis Australia and government officials moved quickly to stress that Djokovic, who has said he is opposed to COVID-19 vaccinations, had received no preferential treatment.\", \"Djokovic, who has won nine titles at Melbourne Park including the last three, confirmed on Tuesday that had received a vaccination exemption to allow him to play at the Australian Open, which starts on Jan. 17.\", \"Australian tennis great Rod Laver, after whom the main showcourt at Melbourne Park in the state of Victoria is named, warned that Djokovic might face hostility from the local crowd.\", \"\\\"I think it might get ugly,\\\" Laver told News Corp. \\\"I'd think the Victorian people would be thinking 'Yes I'd love to see him play and compete, but at the same time there's a right way and a wrong way.'\", \"\\\"Yes, you're a great player and you've performed and won so many tournaments, so it can't be physical. So what is the problem?\\\"\", \"Melbourne local Christine Wharton said it was a \\\"disgrace\\\".\", \"\\\"We've all done the right thing, we've all gone out and got our jabs and our boosters, and we have someone that's come from overseas and all of a sudden he's been exempt and can play, and I think it's an absolute disgrace and I won't be watching it.\\\"\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"6d67185a6e5711ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6d67185a6e5711ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
