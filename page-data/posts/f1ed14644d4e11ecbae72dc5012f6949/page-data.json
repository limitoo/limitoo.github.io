Canceled last year because of Covid-19, the annual Art Basel Miami Beach fair returns next week, unfolding throughout the area. Beginning on Tuesday with invitation-only hours, and open to the public Thursday through Saturday, it will feature 253 galleries exhibiting work inside the city\\u2019s Convention Center, as well as a dizzying number of accompanying satellite art fairs, pop-up shows, and celebrity-studded private dinners.\", \"It\\u2019s a sprawling cultural circus that has come to be called \\u201cMiami Art Week,\\u201d complete with corporate branding exercises, from a sculptural forest by the stage designer Es Devlin (commissioned by a Chanel fragrance) to a \\u201cYacht the Basel\\u201d fete hosted by the snack food Cheetos, with \\u201cdynamic original art pieces created from Cheetos\\u2019 iconic orange dust.\\u201d\", \"The return of Basel\\u2019s Miami fair couldn\\u2019t have come soon enough for the gallerists about to converge on Florida from around the globe. While contemporary art auctions are once again smashing records, overall gallery sales remain sluggish. A midyear Art Basel and UBS report by the economist Dr. Clare McAndrew found that nearly half of the 700 surveyed dealers saw a continued decline in sales during the first six months of 2021. Mega-dealers like Larry Gagosian and David Zwirner, with blue-chip rosters and multiple outposts, were rebounding quickly, the report said. But many smaller dealers, who had relied on Art Basel to develop new clients and introduce emerging talents, had been struggling.\", \"Marc Spiegler, Art Basel\\u2019s global director, can pinpoint the moment when Miami\\u2019s revived art frenzy took off: Sept. 20, when the U.S. government said it would lift the Covid travel ban on most visitors from Europe and Asia in November, thus making the Miami fair the first truly international one in the U.S. since the pandemic\\u2019s start.\", \"Spiegler\\u2019s phone immediately began burning up with messages from dealers who had previously passed on participating: \\u201cBy the end of that week more than 30 galleries \\u2018uncancelled,\\u2019\\u201d he said, noting that despite all the grousing over \\u201cfair fatigue,\\u201d there was still no digital substitute for buying and selling art in the flesh. Nearly half the fair\\u2019s exhibitors will now be arriving from overseas and Latin America. \\u201cI\\u2019ve read all the predictions that art fairs were finished, that nobody was going to travel anymore,\\u201d Spiegler continued. \\u201cWe have a show only marginally smaller than the one in 2019.\\u201d\", \"This is no doubt a relief for Art Basel\\u2019s owners, the Swiss MCH Group, whose stockholder reports show they have lost more than $109 million since the pandemic\\u2019s start. Yet if the Miami fair\\u2019s return is reason for MCH to cheer, the future of its other two art fairs \\u2014 Art Basel Hong Kong, scheduled for March 2022, and the flagship Art Basel in Switzerland, scheduled for June 2022 \\u2014 remains uncertain. Even setting aside the growing wave of government repression and censorship in Hong Kong, there is a mandatory quarantine of up to three weeks for visitors entering the city. Come March, if that quarantine remains, Spiegler said it\\u2019s hard to imagine a full-fledged Basel fair happening. And with Covid infections surging again across Europe, sparking new lockdowns, it\\u2019s anyone\\u2019s guess what June will bring.\", \"These potential losses in revenue for Art Basel make the smooth execution of the Miami fair all the more crucial. To avoid crowding, entry tickets are now timed and proof of a Covid vaccination or a recent negative test is required, as is the wearing of masks. These protocols may seem familiar \\u2014 and reassuring \\u2014 to visitors from New York or Los Angeles, but they\\u2019re almost nonexistent throughout Miami. Local officials have found themselves overruled on mask mandates by the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, who has tried to make himself the face of Republican opposition to Biden administration virus policies. For Spiegler, however, the subject isn\\u2019t open to debate.\", \"\\u201cWhen you bring together thousands of people from all over the world, wearing masks is the only thing that makes sense,\\u201d he said. And if a fair attendee, say, a billionaire art collector, refused to comply with the mask mandate? Would Basel\\u2019s security physically eject them from the Convention Center? \\u201cThat\\u2019s what it means to have a mask mandate,\\u201d Spiegler answered firmly.\", \"Beyond Art Basel, the mood within Miami\\u2019s year-round art scene is anything but tentative. Superblue, a joint venture of the heavyweight Pace gallery and Lauren Powell Jobs\\u2019s Emerson Collective, opened this past spring inside a 31,000-square-foot renovated warehouse in the Allapattah neighborhood. Not to be outdone, Fotografiska, the privately owned global string of photography museums, has announced that it is moving into the 42,000-square-foot warehouse right across the street, next door to the Rubell Museum, with its David Rockwell-designed building set to open in 2023.\", \"And in the city\\u2019s pre-eminent galleries, business is strong. At the Fredric Snitzer Gallery, the director, Joshua Veasey, said things are as busy now as at any point during his six-year tenure there. He credits the established collectors who fled cities up north or out west, riding out the coronavirus in their new Miami residences, who began visiting the gallery for the first time.\", \"\\u201cAfter being stuck inside for so long, there was a lot of redecorating,\\u201d Veasey quipped. \\u201cThese are the problems of the wealthy.\\u201d Yet the fresh faces at the gallery didn\\u2019t emerge out of Miami\\u2019s newly arrived \\u201ctech bros,\\u201d from the aspiring new media mogul Bryan Goldberg to the PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel, who have relocated here amid a wave of Silicon Valley cheerleading from the city\\u2019s mayor. New lower-key clients come with the more typical collector backgrounds of finance and real estate development.\", \"What has trickled down from the tech industry is the love of all things NFT. Art Week hosts a bewildering array of NFT-themed gatherings, including the daylong NFT.BZL conference, featuring a bulging roster of NFT artists, tech figures, and both the city and county mayors. One of the many new NFT marketplaces, SuperRare, has even enlisted the engineers at SuperWorld to install 20 3-D sculptures throughout Art Basel\\u2019s Convention Center, viewable there only on their app \\u2014 a novel way to get in front of influential eyeballs while sidestepping the fair\\u2019s curatorial committees and the roughly $60,000 (and up) booth fee.\", \"\\u201cI was skeptical at first, I wanted to see if NFTs would have more than five minutes of life,\\u201d conceded the Miami multimedia artist Carlos Betancourt, one of the few established local talents to have embraced the new blockchain-based medium. He said the key to his comfort was finding a platform, Aorist, with a curator, Ximena Caminos, who was already a longtime supporter of his work. That, and Aorist\\u2019s willingness to produce a real-life version of his seen-only-on-a-screen NFT piece \\u201cWhat Lies Beneath,\\u201d which spotlights global warming\\u2019s rapid melting of the polar ice caps. The result, whose sale will benefit a local underwater sculpture park, is a pair of faux icebergs \\u2014 one of which is 20 feet high and 30 feet wide, wrapped in collages of Sven-Olof Lindblad\\u2019s photos of actual icebergs, and set afloat in the oceanfront pool of Miami Beach\\u2019s Faena Hotel.\", \"While room rates at the Faena \\u2014 starting at $3,300 a night, $5,500 for an ocean view \\u2014 may limit the audience for \\u201cWhat Lies Beneath,\\u201d it\\u2019ll still be hard to avoid seeing Betancourt\\u2019s artwork and its varied styles around Miami next week. \\u201cInto The Everglades,\\u201d his animated silhouettes of Florida wildlife, will lope nightly across the side of downtown\\u2019s 35-story-high InterContinental Miami hotel; \\u201cMilagro!,\\u201d a 38-foot-long string of 245 handcrafted charms, commissioned by the city of Miami Beach, will hang across a busy city boulevard; and two of his photos \\u2014 homoerotic portraits of both himself and his longtime partner and collaborator, the architect Alberto Latorre \\u2014 will be featured in a group show, \\u201cSkin in the Game\\u201d inside a Beach storefront.\", \"His ubiquity, Betancourt said, is proof that Miami\\u2019s museums and collectors alike have finally embraced the city\\u2019s own artists, prodded by Art Basel\\u2019s attention to made-in-Miami work. \\u201cPeople had an inferiority complex here for many years,\\u201d he continued, recalling his arrival from Puerto Rico as a teenager in 1980, discovering an art scene that too often looked elsewhere for direction. The shift is evident next week as local institutions proudly exhibit work steeped in Miami\\u2019s social fabric.\", \"For starters, Anastasia Samoylova\\u2019s \\u201cFloodZone\\u201d photos at the HistoryMiami museum capture an often surreal visual interplay of flora, fauna, and crumbling concrete; Gary Monroe\\u2019s \\u201cRefuseniks\\u201d photographs at Florida International University\\u2019s Miami Beach Urban Studios offer a poignant study of early \\u201980s Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union rebuilding new lives in a then-unraveling South Beach; and Jared McGriff\\u2019s otherworldly paintings at the NSU Museum of Art Fort Lauderdale depict visions of Black life that are simultaneously troubled and stirringly gorgeous.\", \"This seriously minded artwork is being presented within the context of a tropical weeklong party. If that seems contradictory, Betancourt believes that embracing that contradiction is precisely what has made Miami finally come into its own as an art city: \\u201cWe enjoy the party and that manifests itself in our work,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what Miami brings to the equation \\u2014 we do it all unapologetically.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f1ed14644d4e11ecbae72dc5012f6949"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f1ed14644d4e11ecbae72dc5012f6949"}},
