It's another win in the books, but really from a black jersey point of view the more important game is tomorrow morning in Northampton.\", \"It was said on Friday that the Black Ferns deserve scrutiny, well here it is.\", \"This is shaping as their biggest challenge perhaps ever in their extremely successful history, as they've never had to go into a test off the back of such a resounding loss. Even in World Cup finals they've been favourites with no real need to change the way they've played, as across the park they've always had better players.\", \"Except last weekend. Hopes weren't high for a side missing Olympic gold medallists Portia Woodman and Kelly Brazier, even though neither had played much (if any) fifteens this season.\", \"But to be demolished 43-12 by an England team that was unlucky not to get more came as a serious shock. Especially since the current world champions were often the architects of their own demise, with ball kicked away aimlessly and lineouts butchered at an alarmingly regular rate, so now the real pressure is on them to bounce back.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/133353/eight_col_JGF11555.jpg?1636227851\\\" alt=\\\"England vs New Zealand\\r\\nNew Zealand's Krystal Murray\\r\\n\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nBlack Fern Krystal Murray on the charge during last weekend's disappointing loss to England in Exeter.  \\nPhoto: PHOTOSPORT\\n</div>\", \"Coach Glenn Moore has rung the changes, but that could mean a team that was starting all over again last week after a long pandemic-enforced break will be in the same situation again in the second test.\", \"There are only five caps worth of experience between the starting hooker Grace Houpapa-Barrett and locks Joanah Ngan-Woo and Kelsie Wills, so the one area that they need to clean up fast if they are to be any chance rests on a combination that has only been training together for a week.\", \"Presumably the idea will be to get the ball into Woodman and Ayesha Leti-I'iga's hands as fast and often as possible, which admittedly has worked in the past but will be put to the test against this professional England outfit. That's professional in the fullest sense of the word, too - while plenty has been made about Super Rugby Aupiki and the benefits it will bring to the Black Ferns, another defeat here will really show just how much ground has to be made up on what the RFU are doing in terms of women's rugby.\", \"In terms of what this tour now represents with a home World Cup coming up next year, this test is where the rubber meets the road for the Black Ferns.
