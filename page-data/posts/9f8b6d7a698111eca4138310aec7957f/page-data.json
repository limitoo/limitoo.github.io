This act of rebellion was met with suspension and the school\\u2019s admonishment that \\u201cnice girls have long hair.\\u201d\", \"Judging from the many photos that remain of Lee (1905\\u20141983), she never chopped off her hair again. But she continued to cut a path of her own for the next four decades.\", \"An accomplished Depression-era figurative painter and tremendously successful commercial artist through the 1940s and \\u201950s, Lee learned at a young age that to stay in the game she had to at least pretend to play by the rules. Her farm scenes and family gatherings might summon a Rockwellian sentimentality or the wholesomeness of Grandma Moses (with whom she\\u2019s sometimes compared), but beneath the surface of her Americana is a simmering feminism.\", \"Fearless and confident women star in most of her works, and they are not restricted to stereotypically female activities. We see them wrangling horses, shooting arrows, and taking pleasure. Vladimir Nabokov even referred to one of her paintings in \\u201cLolita.\\u201d It\\u2019s a perspective we don\\u2019t see elsewhere at the time \\u2014 not in Thomas Hart Benton\\u2019s men in the fields, Grant Wood\\u2019s self-righteous small-town folk, or Reginald Marsh\\u2019s silver-screen wannabes.\", \"Lee showed with prominent galleries, sold works to major museums and painted three murals for the W.P.A. Life magazine sent her around the world as an artist-correspondent and she produced award-winning art for major advertising campaigns. But like many figurative painters of the era, especially women, Lee fell into relative obscurity when Abstract Expressionism took over 20th-century taste. Such artists working in the 1930s and \\u201940s were simply \\u201cmarginalized by fashion,\\u201d said the art dealer Deedee Wigmore, who has represented Doris Lee\\u2019s estate since 1991.\", \"But a major new retrospective, \\u201cSimple Pleasures: The Art of Doris Lee,\\u201d traveling nationally through 2023, is reintroducing her to the public through more than 70 examples of her fine and commercial artworks. A companion show at D. Wigmore Fine Art in Manhattan, through Jan. 28, is presenting another 40 works.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019s at this really interesting nexus of folk art, American Scene and Modernism,\\u201d said Melissa Wolfe of the Saint Louis Art Museum, who curated the current retrospective with Barbara Jones of the Westmoreland Museum of American Art in Greensburg, Pa., where it\\u2019s on view through Jan. 9. \\u201cBut basically, she was seen as too unserious to take seriously. Her work is figurative, accessible, and could be decorative and these things were perceived as feminized and not taken seriously. I know the New York School wasn\\u2019t monolithic but work that was perceived as masculine \\u2014 the active, big, aggressive, troubled, full of doubt \\u2014 that\\u2019s what was taken seriously.\\u201d\", \"Born Doris Emrick in Aledo, Ill., to a banker-merchant father and a schoolteacher mother, Lee grew up a self-described \\u201ctomboy\\u201d on her grandparents\\u2019 farms, skipping piano lessons to paint on her neighbor\\u2019s porch. She graduated with a B.A. in philosophy in 1927 and married Russell Lee, who became an acclaimed photographer for the Farm Security Administration.\", \"Lee studied painting in Paris with Andre L\\u2019Hote, a Cubist painter, and also in San Francisco with the realist painter Arnold Blanch. In 1931, the Lees followed Blanch and his artist wife, Lucile Lundquist, to the artists\\u2019 colony in Woodstock. Lee also took a studio on 14th Street in Manhattan. Lee left Russell for Blanch in 1939. They lived together but never married, spending summers in Woodstock, where they were central figures in the art world\\u2019s social scene and exhibited regularly, and winters in Florida.\", \"Woodstock was a progressive place, and Lee fit in. She joined the American Artists\\u2019 Congress, which aimed to combat the rise of fascism in Europe, and she made her opinions clear on inequality. In a talk in 1951 titled \\u201cWomen as Artists,\\u201d she pointed out how \\u201cstupid\\u201d it was that young women were taught to find husbands, and told the audience, \\u201cWe cannot afford to neglect or discourage any talent because of the artificial barriers of race, class, or sex.\\u201d\", \"If her work wasn\\u2019t overtly political, she sneaked some messaging in there, often diffusing any overt cultural critique with a playful and humanizing sense of humor. In \\u201cIllinois River Town\\u201d (1937), one of several works critics called \\u201cBruegelian,\\u201d figures buzz around a beach as a woman lifts her drawers to relieve herself. In \\u201cThe View, Woodstock\\u201d (1946), a woman stands before a blue house tending her kitchen garden with a pitchfork as a man lazes nearby. \\u201cUsually, it\\u2019s the man who introduces us to the estate,\\u201d said Ms. Wolfe, who suspects that Lee is slyly quoting Grant Wood\\u2019s \\u201cAmerican Gothic\\u201d (1930).\", \"Lee first rose up with the American Scene painters \\u2014 a movement that flourished during the Depression, when artists like Wood and Benton forsook European modernism to develop their own art form, recording whatever they imagined it was that made America American \\u2014 its land, customs, ideals, aspirations. Lee also brought in folk art, which she and Blanch collected, and which MoMA had recognized as a distinctly American art form. And she never forgot her European education.\", \"Lee\\u2019s work was not for everyone. (She did however report that she received \\u201clots of fan mail from people in prisons and asylums, long letters telling all.\\u201d) Public criticism catapulted her to the national stage, when her painting \\u201cThanksgiving\\u201d \\u2014 a busy kitchen scene of multigenerational women \\u2014 won the prestigious $500 Logan Purchase Prize at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1935. If Lee\\u2019s cartoonlike figures channel the German Dada artist George Grosz, her focus \\u2014 the intensity of the women\\u2019s labor \\u2014 feels much truer to life than the era\\u2019s more typical depictions of the idyllic Thanksgiving table.\", \"The award\\u2019s donor, Josephine Hancock Logan, publicly called Lee\\u2019s work an \\u201cawful thing\\u201d and then founded the Sanity in Art movement to purge the \\u201cmodernistic grotesqueries\\u201d of Surrealism and Dada from American art.The Art Institute of Chicago responded by buying the work. Lee, meanwhile, told The Washington Post that \\u201cto paint beautiful pictures was not my aim\\u201d and that if some of the faces looked \\u201clike cartoons,\\u201d as had been suggested by Time Magazine and others, \\u201cso do some people.\\u201d\", \"That same year, Fortune magazine wrote that \\u201cshe particularly dislikes that the last word about her painting is \\u2018optimism,\\u2019\\u201d and quoted her saying that what she actually felt was \\u201ca sort of violence.\\u201d Life magazine later interpreted her comment as a \\u201ccomic sense of violence,\\u201d but Wolfe thinks otherwise.\", \"\\u201cMany of her early works seem to be about this kind of inner churning or a desire for physical freedom,\\u201d the curator said, referring to works like \\u201cThe Runaway\\u201d (1935), which shows a woman on horseback speeding away from a farm.\", \"Lee\\u2019s relative privilege helped her subsist as an artist during the Depression, as did Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. As the cultural historian John Fagg, who contributed to the \\u201cSimple Pleasures\\u201d catalog noted, the renegade heiress created the Whitney Studio Club, where artists like Lee could show and sell their work.(Lee was included in the first Whitney Biennial, in 1932.)\", \"Soon she caught the attention of art directors and editors, too. Lee\\u2019s style had become crisper and flatter, with large areas of juicy delineated color, which made it easier to reproduce. (She also had an eye for design details \\u2014 furniture, architecture, plant life, technology, jewelry \\u2014 which lent itself well to illustrations.)\", \"In 1941 she joined Associated American Artists, the buzzy gallery of entrepreneur Reeves Lewenthal, who aimed to make money by bringing fine art to the masses. As consumerism and the advertising age exploded, he produced her prints and landed her jobs with companies like American Tobacco and General Mills, and also got her designing fabric and ceramics and illustrating books, including the Rogers & Hart Songbook. \\u201cShe was so tenacious,\\u201d Jones said. \\u201cShe went after everything. She was often the only woman working with these groups of men, and she could really hold her own.\\u201d\", \"Her first assignment for Life, in 1939, was to commemorate the musical \\u201cShowboat.\\u201d It was the first Broadway production with a racially integrated cast, which she portrayed rehearsing. Life then commissioned her to paint African American women in South Carolina \\u201cas a source of fashion inspiration\\u201d for a 1941 issue. She later reworked one of the nine fashion plates into \\u201cSiesta\\u201d (1944) \\u2014 a vaguely eroticized painting of a Dionysian Black woman \\u2014 which won third prize in the Carnegie Institute show. Assignments in North Africa, Mexico, Cuba, and Hollywood followed.\", \"Lee didn\\u2019t differentiate much between her fine and commercial art. One common thread is her persistent depiction of women as happy and confident, whether on the farm or in Hollywood. \\u201cShe makes no apologies for her women and their joy, which I think shows a great deal of liberation,\\u201d said Emily Lenz, director and partner at D. Wigmore.\", \"Her work became more streamlined and abstract in the 1950s and \\u201960s. Lee and Blanch were close with Milton Avery and his wife, Sally Michael, and some argue that she was under their influence. (Wolfe argues that it was reciprocal.) Lee was spending more time in Florida, and her paintings reflect the sunny, nautical surroundings.\", \"In 1968 Lee was diagnosed with Alzheimer\\u2019s. She died in 1983 in Clearwater, Fla. She did not have children and in a 1951 talk discussed how it riled people. \\u201cI remember hearing one woman say, \\u2018The most wonderful thing a woman can create is her family and home and you\\u2019ll never know that feeling\\u2019,\\u201d she recounted. Her rebuttal: \\u201cAnd you\\u2019ll never know the feeling of being an artist.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9f8b6d7a698111eca4138310aec7957f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9f8b6d7a698111eca4138310aec7957f"}},
