They publish the blockbuster, then send the pair of scientists off to an influential morning news program, \\u201cThe Daily Rip\\u201d \\u2014 think \\u201cMorning Joe,\\u201d with a dash of \\u201cLive With Kelly and Ryan\\u201d \\u2014 to promote the news. And that\\u2019s when things start to go awry. \\u201cKeep it light, fun,\\u201d one producer tells the scientists, who are played by Jennifer Lawrence and Leonardo DiCaprio. As soon as they sit down, the Joe Scarborough proxy, played by an irresistible Tyler Perry, leans in to ask what\\u2019s really on his mind: Is there life on other planets?\", \"After putting up with the morning-show-style banter for much of the segment, Jennifer Lawrence\\u2019s character has had enough. \\u201cMaybe the destruction of the entire planet isn\\u2019t supposed to be fun,\\u201d she yells. \\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s supposed to be terrifying and unsettling and you should stay up all night, every night, crying.\\u201d\", \"The clip of her losing it on the air earns wide attention \\u2014 as a meme that gets likes and laughs on social media. Her boyfriend, a reporter for a sardonic news site called Autopsy, moves fast to make the most of her outburst under a two-sentence headline that\\u2019s its own kind of internet clich\\u00e9: \\u201cYou Know the Crazy Chick Who Thinks We\\u2019re All Going to Die? I Actually Slept With Her.\\u201d\", \"Back at The Herald, a social media specialist delivers a slick PowerPoint presentation to show that the story isn\\u2019t driving much traffic. The news cycle moves on.\", \"I\\u2019m a little hesitant to praise a political movie, because Hollywood\\u2019s political statements tend to be vapid. Talk is cheap, and an impassioned outburst at an awards show is free. True spontaneous passion is usually reserved for, say, defending the method acting involved in the show \\u201cSuccession.\\u201d What makes \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up\\u201d interesting is that its writer and director, Adam McKay, is putting his money, and his career, where his mouth is.\", \"Since breaking out with \\u201cAnchorman,\\u201d a broad parody of local TV news, he has made a pair of films with a political edge, \\u201cThe Big Short,\\u201d a gonzo take on the financial crisis, and \\u201cVice,\\u201d the bitterly comic story of Vice President Dick Cheney. \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up\\u201d has a raft of stars \\u2014 the president is played by Meryl Streep \\u2014 and the familiar arc of big-budget disaster flicks like \\u201cArmageddon\\u201d or \\u201cThe Day After Tomorrow.\\u201d But while all of Mr. McKay\\u2019s films have been attuned to the intertwined roles of media and politics, this is his first movie since \\u201cAnchorman\\u201d to put the news media squarely in its sights.\", \"The new opus shows Mr. McKay as \\u201cone of America\\u2019s most incisive media critics, even if he\\u2019s not necessarily recognized that way,\\u201d said David Sirota, a co-producer of the film, who is better known as a combative journalist who advised Senator Bernie Sanders during his 2020 presidential campaign and now runs The Daily Poster, an investigative news site.\", \"Mr. McKay said he tried five different ideas that would allow him to make a movie about the climate crisis, but nothing worked. \\u201cHow do you tell this story, the biggest story in 66 million years, without exaggeration, since the Chicxulub comet, bigger than the Black Plague, bigger than Krakatoa?\\u201d he said in an interview, describing the question that kept him up at night.\", \"\\u201cHow can we be looking at the greatest story in human history,\\u201d he continued, \\u201cbut most nights I\\u2019m not hearing it talked about \\u2014 or when it is being talked about, it\\u2019s in the fourth block, or the ninth story down?\\u201d\", \"He hit on the solution while talking one night in January 2019 with Mr. Sirota, who was venting about the news media\\u2019s passive reaction to climate change, saying it was as though a meteor was headed for earth and no one seemed to get it. Soon, the two were texting plot points back and forth.\", \"\\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up\\u201d is populated by politicians and Silicon Valley madmen denying reality for their own reasons, behaving in ways that are recognizably self-interested and deluded. But the real villain is a news media that is forever chasing after a distracted audience and, as a result, simply \\u2026 cannot \\u2026 focus.\", \"When the two scientists emphasize the reality of the coming apocalypse during their appearance on \\u201cThe Daily Rip,\\u201d the host played by Mr. Perry is singularly focused on one thing: whether the meteor will take out his ex-wife\\u2019s house in Florida. The other host, played by Cate Blanchett as a charming, hyper-educated, amoral stand-in for Mika Brzezinski, is more interested in the DiCaprio character\\u2019s nerdy sex appeal.\", \"(I did ask Mr. McKay if we could have a moratorium on fictional female journalists sleeping with their subjects, even if they\\u2019re Mr. DiCaprio in the guise of a nerdy scientist. He replied that \\u201cthe funnest characters are the ones who are sleeping with people and a little reprehensible.\\u201d)\", \"One of the charms of \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up\\u201d is that none of its characters are immune to the vanities of this media age. At one point, a high-minded NASA official who is trying to save the planet is pictured rejoicing that a pop star, played by Ariana Grande, has reunited with her boyfriend.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s me calling myself out,\\u201d Mr. McKay said. \\u201cI am in no way above this. I really want Ben Affleck and J. Lo to find happiness together, and I really am excited about what next thing is Taco Bell going to make \\u2014 is it a burrito full of little burritos?\\u201d\", \"In a twist right out of the movie itself, much of the publicity for \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up\\u201d has been focused on Hollywood gossip. Early in the rollout, Mr. McKay told Vanity Fair that he hadn\\u2019t spoken with his longtime partner Will Ferrell, the star of \\u201cAnchorman\\u201d and other McKay films, including \\u201cStep Brothers\\u201d and \\u201cTalladega Nights,\\u201d since he cast a different actor to play the lead in a planned HBO series about the Los Angeles Lakers.\", \"Seeing a Hollywood spat push aside an earnest message on climate change was \\u201calmost hilariously ironic,\\u201d Mr. McKay said. (Then he spent a few more minutes talking about how the chatter about him and Mr. Ferrell wasn\\u2019t quite accurate. For the record: \\u201cThat\\u2019s not why Will and I split up \\u2014 we\\u2019d been split up for three months. That turned us into not talking.\\u201d OK!)\", \"Mr. McKay was also unable to stay out of the fray over the actor Jeremy Strong\\u2019s interview with The New Yorker last week about his role in the show \\u201cSuccession,\\u201d of which Mr. McKay is also an executive producer.\", \"Good journalism is always a balance between telling people what they want to hear and what they need to know. Mr. McKay\\u2019s contention is that decades of a hyperactive media market, and years of Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and TikTok, have thrown things out of whack.\", \"I was reminded of that point the other night at the introduction of a new journalism program named in honor of Harry Evans, the crusading Times of London editor who came to New York after refusing to do the bidding of the paper\\u2019s owner, Rupert Murdoch. Mr. Evans, the historian Simon Schama recalled, had been a \\u201chot-metal journalist\\u201d who had overcome British legal restrictions to expose the ravages of the drug thalidomide in the 1970s. His great subject, Mr. Schama noted, was corporate malfeasance.\", \"\\u201cIf he were here now, he would say the slow death of the earth isn\\u2019t a small thing to get upset about,\\u201d Mr. Schama said.\", \"We don\\u2019t live, exactly, in the world of an Adam McKay satire. My colleague Dennis Overbye wrote last week that when he brought word of a dangerous asteroid to a New York Times news meeting in 1998, the reaction was \\u201cpurposeful pandemonium,\\u201d not denial. And \\u201cMorning Joe\\u201d gets more criticism for doom-saying about American democracy than for frivolity.\", \"When it comes to the climate story, the media\\u2019s failings are undeniable, and there is still a wide gap between the urgency and the attention it commands. However, the journalism on the topic has grown more urgent in tone and more widely seen over the last few years. It\\u2019s harder-edged, more numerate and more closely connected to the floods, fires and December tornadoes that have upended millions of people\\u2019s lives.\", \"But great satire amplifies obvious truths, and there\\u2019s no doubt that \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up\\u201d contains those moments of recognition. David Roberts, the author of the clean energy newsletter Volts, called it \\u201cthe first good movie about climate change.\\u201d\", \"The global failure to slow carbon emissions, like the failure to control the Covid-19 pandemic, is partly a story about hard science. But it\\u2019s more about society\\u2019s ability or inability to take action, and the news media had played a large role in that willful turning away from a difficult truth. \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up\\u201d ends \\u2014 spoiler alert! \\u2014 badly for humanity, but before it does, a Fox News-style host whistles manically past the grave. We\\u2019ll be moving on, he tells his viewers as the world is ending, to \\u201cthe story that everyone is talking about tonight \\u2014 topless urgent care centers.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a36ba0fa5ba211ecb14637193b15a515"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a36ba0fa5ba211ecb14637193b15a515"}},
