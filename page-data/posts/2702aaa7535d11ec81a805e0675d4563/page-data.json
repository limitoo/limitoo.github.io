I think it was the largest crowd I've ever spoken to before,\\\" Trump replied.\", \"\\\"And I reverse it. The insurrection took place on November 3, that was Election Day, and before and after, that was to me the insurrection. And January 6 was a protest.\", \"\\\"But if you would have looked at the crowd, says nobody wants to talk about that, I believe it was the biggest and most people\\u2014and I've spoken to very big crowds\\u2014I have never spoken in front of a crowd that size.

We would have had tremendous security, but they turned that down.\", \"\\\"Also, the police say we're not given proper instructions by Capitol Hill, which is Pelosi.
