Kyiv and its Western allies say this is a baseless pretext to invade a democratic country of 44 million people.\", \"But so far Russian forces have failed to crush Ukraine's military and remove its leaders, while Zelenskiy has rallied his people and Western military aid has poured across the Polish and Romanian borders.\", \"Russian troops have advanced in the south but have yet to capture a city in the north or east. Western countries have said they believe that after a planned lightning strike on the capital Kyiv failed in the early days of the war Moscow has turned to tactics involving far more destructive assaults.\", \"Britain said on Thursday a Russian column northwest of Kyiv had made little progress in over a week and was suffering losses.\", \"The Western-led sanctions designed to cut off the Russian economy and government from international markets have bitten hard, with the rouble plunging.\", \"The pounding of Mariupol underscored U.S. warnings that the biggest assault on a European state since 1945 could become increasingly attritional after Russia's early setbacks.\", \"Russia has repeatedly pledged since Saturday to halt firing so at least some trapped civilians could escape Mariupol.
