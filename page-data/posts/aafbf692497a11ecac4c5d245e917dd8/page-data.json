Google pointed to his work with Yelp and the News Media Alliance, which represents publishers including The New York Times Company.\", \"\\u201cMr. Kanter\\u2019s past statements and work representing competitors who have advocated for the cases brought by the department raise serious concerns about his ability to be impartial,\\u201d Peter Schottenfels, a Google spokesman, said in a statement.\", \"Mr. Kanter, who was confirmed by the Senate earlier this week as the assistant attorney general for antitrust, has been a longtime behind-the-scenes player in building arguments against tech giants.\", \"Google\\u2019s lawyer said Mr. Kanter had represented Yelp in connection with an antitrust case filed against Google that was led a group that included the Justice Department.

Mr. Kanter did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.\", \"The request is the latest attempt by a tech company to discredit the regulators leading antitrust investigations into their practices.

Amazon has also asked that Ms. Khan be recused from any antitrust investigation into the company.\", \"While federal officials are supposed to avoid real or perceived conflicts of interest, experts have said that Mr. Kanter\\u2019s situation may be different because he is not switching sides in the cases against Google. Instead, he is going from being a Google opponent on behalf of private clients to arguing similar concerns on behalf of the government.\", \"Google also said that Mr. Kanter had made previous statements critical of Google that showed he had \\u201cprejudged\\u201d whether it had violated antitrust laws. Failing to recuse Mr. Kanter \\u201cmight also add fuel to suggestions that the department\\u2019s actions might be unduly influenced by Google\\u2019s competitors,\\u201d said the Google lawyer, Virginia Gibson, from the law firm Hogan Lovells.\"]","href_hash":"aafbf692497a11ecac4c5d245e917dd8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"aafbf692497a11ecac4c5d245e917dd8"}},
