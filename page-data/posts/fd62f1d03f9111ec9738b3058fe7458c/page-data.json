He performed at a high enough level to prevent the judges from taking away his belt.\", \"In the end, the two rivals shook hands, a gesture that some would have not predicted after a year of trash talk and insults. Usman has now defended his title five times and is marching closer to potentially usurping Georges St-Pierre as the greatest welterweight of all time.
