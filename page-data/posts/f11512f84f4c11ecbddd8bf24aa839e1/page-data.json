It was recorded by Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan and Judy Collins, among others.\", \"One of Sondheim's greatest triumphs was his Pulitzer Prize for the 1984 musical Sunday in the Park with George, about 19th-century French Neo-Impressionist artist Georges Seurat.\", \"As Sondheim collected accolades, New York City's Broadway theater industry underwent many changes. It had a key role in American culture through the 1950s, with many Broadway songs making the pop charts, but lost significance as rock music gained a hold on the public starting in the 1960s.\", \"Increasingly, musicals borrowed material from television and movies, instead of the other way around, composer Mark N.

Instead of telling a story from beginning to end, he would jump backward and forward in time to explore a single theme. It was called the \\\"concept musical.\\\"\", \"Broadway audiences were introduced to Sondheim in 1957 when he wrote the lyrics for West Side Story to go with Leonard Bernstein's music and it became an American classic.\", \"The story about a love affair between a Puerto Rican girl, Maria, and a white boy, Tony, in working-class Manhattan was turned into an Oscar-winning film in 1961.

He later said his mother took out her wrath over the divorce on him. He found a surrogate family in the nearby household of Hammerstein and his wife, Dorothy.\", \"Hammerstein, who along with partner Richard Rodgers created the classic musicals Oklahoma! and The Sound of Music, taught the teenage Sondheim how to write musical theater.\", \"After Sondheim became famous, he mentored others on Broadway. When Miranda began work on a rap musical about American founding father Alexander Hamilton, Sondheim encouraged and critiqued him. The play became a smash hit on Broadway in 2015.\", \"In box office success, Sondheim fell short of Andrew Lloyd Webber, the composer behind The Phantom of the Opera and Cats with whom Sondheim shared a birthday.\", \"Sondheim pushed audiences' boundaries, which sometimes resulted in box office flops.\", \"Some of his least commercially successful plays were lauded by critics. Those included the 1976 Pacific Overtures, which depicted Japan during an age of Western colonialism, and his 1990 off-Broadway production Assassins about real-life figures who each set out to kill an American president.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/281446/eight_col_000_Was8984437.jpg?1637966216\\\" alt=\\\"US President Barack Obama presents the Presidential Medal of Freedom to theater composer and lyricist Stephen Sondheim at the White House in Washington, DC, on November 24, 2015.
