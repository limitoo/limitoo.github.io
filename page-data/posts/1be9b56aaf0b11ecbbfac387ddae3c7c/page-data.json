Now we are at the point where customers don't even come in because there's hardly anyone in the city and people don't have money to spend.\\\"\", \"The store made just two sales last week.\", \"\\\"My lease comes to an end in a month so I will be closing doors and going. There's no other positive factors that could keep me here because financially I'm drained,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Even though borders are open I don't think we can actually play the waiting game, it could be months but it could be years before the city turns around again.\\\"\", \"The store is in Queen's Arcade, where more than half of the retailers have closed down or relocated.\", \"The speciality music store Marbecks Records is among those remaining.\", \"Owner Roger Marbeck said seeing neighbours in the arcade leave was devastating.\", \"\\\"It's kind of like a big family in here, so it's tragic. These are people's lives, 60 percent of them gone.
