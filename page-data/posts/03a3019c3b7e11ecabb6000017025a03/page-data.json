One might think that serving as a staffer in Barack Obama\\u2019s White House is good material for another memoir, by a different person. But the actor Kal Penn writes about both experiences in \\u201cYou Can\\u2019t Be Serious,\\u201d which Gallery Books will publish on Tuesday.\", \"The book has attracted early attention for its most personal detail: Penn is gay, and engaged to Josh, his partner of 11 years. Their relationship is conveyed in one chapter that is mostly about their earliest dates, during which they seemed comically mismatched.\", \"Penn also writes about growing up in suburban New Jersey and fully catching the acting bug while performing in a middle-school staging of \\u201cThe Wiz.\\u201d He is candid about his fight against the entertainment industry\\u2019s tendency to cast actors of color in stereotypical roles. And he recounts the \\u201csabbatical\\u201d he took after establishing a Hollywood career to campaign for Obama and then serve in the public engagement arm of his administration.\", \"Below, Penn talks about finding the story he wanted to tell, the self-loathing he first felt while writing it and the filmmaker who inspired his career.\", \"When did you first get the idea to write this book?\", \"The first idea, which I rejected, came the day I left the White House. My manager called me. I describe him in the book as like every character from the TV show \\u201cEntourage\\u201d in one person. Heart of gold but also a lion.\", \"And he said, \\u201cYou need to write a book. I\\u2019ll set you up with meetings.\\u201d I said, \\u201cDan, what am I going to write a book about?\\u201d He said, \\u201cThere aren\\u2019t many actors who have been in politics.\\u201d I said, \\u201cThe governor is literally Arnold Schwarzenegger.\\u201d And the reason I took the sabbatical was not to write a book. I don\\u2019t like the optics of that and, more importantly, I don\\u2019t have a story to tell.\", \"Later I thought, maybe I do have a story to tell: I\\u2019d love to write a book for the 20-year-old version of me. There was never a book that said, \\u201cThis is how you navigate the entertainment industry as a young man of color.\\u201d And I\\u2019ve met a lot of people who were told they\\u2019re crazy for having multiple passions. We\\u2019re in a society that just doesn\\u2019t encourage that kind of thing. So I thought maybe my experiences might make somebody smile or feel a little more connected, and I had a chance to put it together and write it during the pandemic.\", \"What\\u2019s the most surprising thing you learned while writing it?\", \"There was a point three months into writing it when I felt the kind of self-loathing that I haven\\u2019t felt since middle school. I texted a bunch of my writer friends, and they all either said, \\u201cYeah, buddy, welcome to being an author,\\u201d or \\u201cWhy do you think so many of us drink so much Scotch?\\u201d Just a sea of those types of responses.\", \"Up until that point, I\\u2019d written fiction, essentially scripts and characters. It\\u2019s very different when you\\u2019re creating a character or a plotline: That\\u2019s not you, you can take a break from it. With this process, it\\u2019s \\u201cOh my God, there\\u2019s no escaping my own brain.\\u201d I was not prepared for it.\", \"In what way is the book you wrote different from the book you set out to write?\", \"I was sure that I wanted to share two stories: one about my parents and their upbringing; and the story of how Josh and I met. He showed up with an 18-pack of Coors and turned my TV from \\u201cSpongeBob\\u201d to NASCAR. I thought, \\u201cThis guy\\u2019s leaving here in 40 minutes with 16 beers.\\u201d So the fact that we\\u2019re together 11 years later is funny because so many people have stories of dates that went awry but now they\\u2019re married and have kids.\", \"In the book\\u2019s outline, there was no ending. I always struggled with that. I thought there was going to have to be some kind of a positive wrap-up, a story of triumph after years of typecasting and racism. And then \\u201cSunnyside\\u201d happened. I sold this show after I had already started writing the book. There\\u2019s a chapter I write about how it\\u2019s truly my dream show: a big network [NBC], a diverse, patriotic comedy that would hopefully bring people together and make them laugh.\", \"And then it slowly unraveled. With everything else in the book, I have the perspective of time. This was still raw. I ended up putting it as the last real chapter because it\\u2019s a perfect example of how much has changed and how much has yet to change.\", \"We often think of goals as: Everything has now been fixed, so end of story. In reality, everything is a constant mess of back and forth.\", \"What creative person who isn\\u2019t a writer has influenced you and your work?\", \"I always say Mira Nair, and I would have said this years ago, before this book was ever on the table. Her second film, \\u201cMississippi Masala,\\u201d came out when I was in eighth grade. It was the first time I\\u2019d seen South Asian characters onscreen that weren\\u2019t stereotypes or cartoon characters.\", \"They were deeply flawed, deeply interesting humans. They make love, they have financial problems. And that happened around the time \\u201cThe Wiz\\u201d happened, so she was one of the people who inspired me to pursue a career in the arts.\", \"So when I got a chance to work with her on \\u201cThe Namesake,\\u201d it meant a lot to me. And \\u201cThe Namesake,\\u201d the novel \\u2014 Jhumpa Lahiri\\u2019s writing was introduced to me by John Cho, from \\u201cHarold & Kumar.\\u201d All of those influences intersecting are very meaningful to me.\", \"Persuade someone to read \\u201cYou Can\\u2019t Be Serious\\u201d in 50 words or fewer.\", \"If you want to feel like you\\u2019re having a beer with somebody who smoked weed with a fake president and served a real one, whose grandparents marched with Gandhi and whose parents certainly didn\\u2019t move to America for him to slide off a naked woman\\u2019s back in his first film.\"]","href_hash":"03a3019c3b7e11ecabb6000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"03a3019c3b7e11ecabb6000017025a03"}},
