Here the friendly mundanities of a workingman\\u2019s daily routine meet the grim shadow cast by the country\\u2019s Magdalene laundries.\", \"At those secretive institutions, which lasted from the 1700s through the 1990s and were typically run by Catholic nuns with the support of the Irish government, so-called \\u201cfallen\\u201d girls and women were imprisoned, worked and abused, their children often taken from them and neglected, or even killed. In 2014, a mass grave containing the remains of some 800 babies and children was uncovered in a septic tank in the County Galway town of Tuam. Only in the past decade have the Catholic Church and Irish society begun to confront the horrors of the laundries that incarcerated approximately 30,000 women.\", \"For the fictional villagers in \\u201cSmall Things Like These,\\u201d as for its readers, the specter of these laundries is fleeting at first \\u2014 a shock of cold you pass through quickly, with a reflexive shiver, before emerging into the next patch of sun. The protagonist, a coal and timber merchant named Bill Furlong, is himself the son of an unmarried Catholic mother who \\u201chad fallen pregnant\\u201d at 16 and avoided the torment of a Magdalene home through the charity of her Protestant employer. Now an adult with daughters of his own, Furlong is going about his coal-delivery rounds one day when he finds one of the nuns\\u2019 abject charges locked inside a freezing shed. He takes the girl into the convent and shares a fraught cup of tea with the tyrannical Mother Superior. It\\u2019s clear that eventually he\\u2019ll have to decide whether to rescue the girl or leave her to her fate, turning a blind eye as the rest of his community would doubtless prefer.\", \"There\\u2019s little modernity in Keegan\\u2019s Irish town. Except for passing mentions of Jeeps and airports and 1980s British TV shows like \\u201cAll Creatures Great and Small,\\u201d we barely see evidence of technologies, idioms or trends more recent than the Industrial Revolution. Reading the story I felt immersed in a 19th-century landscape, rather than one set in the years of my own teens. Instead of Pac-Man and \\u201cPurple Rain\\u201d and Madonna, the references are to shipyards and Dickens, anthracite, homemade fruitcakes and Beechams Powder, a constipation remedy that dates from 1842.\", \"Such homey quaintification of Irishness is a fairly familiar trope, but here it\\u2019s likely accurate enough: The country was still sunk in the past in 1985, when a doctor\\u2019s prescription was required to buy condoms. And Keegan\\u2019s prose, as she describes this trapped-in-amber world, is both nostalgic and practical: The scope of village life may be small, but its texture is rich. Neighbors are welcoming. Customers give Furlong gifts. Moments of interpersonal contact shimmer like the dimming jewels of a sense of community that, for many of us, has vanished into bygones.\", \"But the quaintness, Keegan implies, is a veneer over rot. Beneath the charming give-and-take lurk steely warnings and a sociopathic lack of empathy; even Furlong\\u2019s wife, Eileen \\u2014 a proper, middle-class mother of five \\u2014 refuses to entertain the reality of others\\u2019 suffering. And so the town allows vicious crimes, against its most vulnerable residents, to go on unobstructed.\", \"Curiously, by casting Furlong as a reluctant but good-hearted hero and the women around him as largely enablers and cowards \\u2014 protective of their own children but otherwise seeing no evil \\u2014 Keegan almost seems to suggest that in this community it was the women who were most keenly implicated in perpetuating the suffering of their own. Not only the nuns themselves, but the gossips and bystanders and repressed and fearful bourgeoisies like Eileen, who knew of the crimes and stubbornly turned their faces away.\", \"As in Ursula K. Le Guin\\u2019s story \\u201cThe Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas,\\u201d this Ireland is a place whose cheeriness depends on the misery of its scapegoats.\"]","href_hash":"166128a2521411eca6a5c3c45fca6cf6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"166128a2521411eca6a5c3c45fca6cf6"}},
