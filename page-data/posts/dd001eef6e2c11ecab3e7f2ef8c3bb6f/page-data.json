His first, \\u201cLoyalties,\\u201d appeared more than three decades ago, in 1989.\", \"\\u201cLoyalties\\u201d was about growing up in an idealistic and radical family \\u2014 his father, a union organizer, had been a member of the Communist Party in the 1940s \\u2014 under constant surveillance and harassment from the F.B.I.\", \"His new one is subtitled \\u201cA Kid in the Newsroom.\\u201d It\\u2019s about how he fell in love with newspapering. As a teenager he was hired as a copy boy at The Evening Star, an afternoon daily in Washington, D.C.\", \"It was the moment when his future forked. He felt he\\u2019d been handed a ticket to the rest of his life. The \\u201cglorious chaos\\u201d and \\u201cpurposeful commotion\\u201d of a good newspaper appealed to Bernstein on a primal level.\", \"He found a different kind of family at The Star. His own parents, in their idealism, had been distant figures. At the paper he discovered people who were \\u201cless complicated, less fraught.\\u201d He barely graduated from high school and dropped out of college.\", \"Newspapering required different habits of mind.\", \"Bernstein found \\u201ca haven in reporting, especially the way The Star went about it: proceeding without judgment or predisposition to wherever the facts and context and rigorous questioning led, to some notion of the truth in all its complexity. I liked that place. And the comfort and purpose it gave me.\\u201d\", \"When I learned, a few months ago, that a Bernstein journalism memoir was coming down the tracks, I marked it as a must-read.\", \"His Watergate reporting, with Bob Woodward at The Washington Post, brought down a presidency and inspired a generation of muckrakers. He was portrayed in movies by Dustin Hoffman and, less flatteringly, by Jack Nicholson. He was a dandy; he had top-flight hair.\", \"His lively bachelordom was well chronicled. He jilted the beloved Nora Ephron, who delivered a version of their short marriage in her novel \\u201cHeartburn.\\u201d He\\u2019s been a big beast of the media world for five decades.\", \"He\\u2019s forced to live the \\u201cGroundhog Day\\u201d nightmare of being asked, every time he turns around, if the latest outrage is \\u201cworse than Watergate.\\u201d At 77, he is entering his anecdotage. Who wouldn\\u2019t want to read about his sense of all these things, and to view his dashcam footage?\", \"That\\u2019s not what \\u201cChasing History\\u201d is. The book tells the story of his journalistic apprenticeship at The Evening Star, the Pepsi to The Washington Post\\u2019s Coca-Cola, from 1960 to 1965. He was in his teens and early 20s. It ends before he gets to The Post, and long before he sets eyes on Woodward or Ephron.\", \"The result is a fond, earnest, sepia-toned book, the color of old clippings. It\\u2019s pretty good. I mean, it\\u2019s OK. It\\u2019s better than a sharp stick in eye. It\\u2019s just \\u2026 long and pokey and a bit underthought. I might not have finished it if my paycheck didn\\u2019t depend on leaving a clean plate.\", \"A lot happened in the world in the early 1960s, \\u201cChasing History\\u201d reminds us: Russians in space; Bay of Pigs; the Cuban missile crisis; the March on Washington; John F. Kennedy\\u2019s assassination; the Beatles\\u2019 touchdown in the United States; the Chaney, Goodman and Schwerner murders in Mississippi; the Selma-to-Montgomery march.\", \"Bernstein was thrilled to feel a part of these events by osmosis, as those in a newsroom do, even if his role was mostly taking dictation from reporters in the field. He describes these historical events in detail, as if few had written about them before.\", \"He\\u2019s evocative about newsrooms themselves circa 1960: the books and papers, the gunmetal desks, the dirty Royal typewriters, the \\u201chailstorms\\u201d of typing, the bulletins arriving, the printing press rumbling through the floor.\", \"He made himself useful. He learned by following the grizzled old guys \\u2014 they were mostly guys \\u2014 around. He learned to cover fires, to talk to cops, to take good notes, to carry shotgun rolls of dimes for pay phones.\", \"He\\u2019s good on the camaraderie he found. He was brilliantly hazed by a co-worker who told him, while Bernstein was wearing a beloved cream-colored suit, that he had to \\u201cwash\\u201d all the staff\\u2019s used carbon paper.\", \"The Star\\u2019s staff included big characters, like the columnist Mary McGrory. Bernstein found his own younger crowd, among them the journalist Lance Morrow. This cohort rented a rambling house together.\", \"\\u201cWorking for The Star was a little like being part of a troupe of actors in a repertory company,\\u201d he writes, \\u201call of us absorbed in the same project, all wrapped up in the stories, the work.\\u201d He continues: \\u201cWe were smart, we never had enough money and we often had too much to drink.\\u201d\", \"His enthusiasm was infectious. If he\\u2019d been a dog, his head would have always been outside the car window.\", \"Bernstein attended the University of Maryland, but rarely went to class. There\\u2019s a measure of suspense in watching him try to avoid being drafted. He eventually joined an Army Reserve unit.\", \"It rankles the author still that The Star recognized he had talent and energy but would not hire him as a reporter because he didn\\u2019t have a college degree. This was during a period when journalism, long seen as quasi-blue-collar work, was being invaded by dapper young men from the Ivy League.\", \"\\u201cMy view was that you might be better prepared by graduating from horticultural school than from Yale or Princeton,\\u201d Bernstein writes. \\u201cAt least that way you could write the gardening column.\\u201d\", \"I was a cub reporter once, and journalism memoirs to me are salted peanuts. \\u201cChasing History\\u201d lacks the parched wit of Russell Baker\\u2019s \\u201cThe Good Times\\u201d and the shrewdness of Mencken\\u2019s \\u201cNewspaper Days.\\u201d It doesn\\u2019t have the gruff charm of Pete Hamill\\u2019s \\u201cA Drinking Life,\\u201d the omnidirectional belligerence of Michael Moore\\u2019s \\u201cHere Comes Trouble\\u201d or the sparkle of Molly Ivins\\u2019s remembrances, to name a few that come to mind.\", \"Had it run to 175 pages, \\u201cChasing History\\u201d might have been a small classic. Bernstein makes journalism sound like what it is \\u2014 a humble calling that can be a noble one.\", \"His heart glows remembering his early days in the business, but he can\\u2019t quite make ours glow alongside his. If at 370 pages this book overstays its welcome, well, the kid was all right.\"]","href_hash":"dd001eef6e2c11ecab3e7f2ef8c3bb6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dd001eef6e2c11ecab3e7f2ef8c3bb6f"}},
