sporting venues, and transporting spectators around for two weeks of competition, traditionally comes with a significant environmental footprint.\", \"Aware of this, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) moved towards a more flexible model that allowed future Olympics to operate in a more affordable and sustainable way.\", \"While all upcoming Olympics have committed to being carbon neutral, from 2030 onwards host cities will be contractually obliged to go one step further and operate as \\\"climate positive\\\".\", \"The Brisbane 2032 Olympics will be the first Games held to this standard.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What is a\\u00a0'climate-positive'\\u00a0Olympics?</div>\", \"Put simply, it means the Olympic Games will have to offset more carbon emissions than it produces.\", \"To achieve this, the Brisbane 2032 organising committee will need to minimise emissions linked to the event and implement \\\"lasting zero carbon solutions\\\" for the Games and beyond, according to the IOC.\", \"Sustainable development specialist from the University of Queensland, Dr Cle-Anne Gabriel, said it was about more than just \\\"doing no harm\\\".\", \"To make it a reality is no small feat \\u2013 past Olympic Games have had a carbon footprint of more than 3 million tonnes.\", \"<img

away, the specific details of how Brisbane 2032 will achieve a climate positive Games are yet to be laid out.\", \"But Brisbane has a major head start in reducing emissions and costs \\u2013 more than 80 per cent of the venues needed for the Games already exist.\", \"For those that still have to be constructed, the bid submitted to host the 2032 Games refers to an aim for a \\\"6-star Green Star\\\" building rating on any new vertical infrastructure, and that Games infrastructure will incorporate technologies such as electric vehicle charging equipment.\", \"While not a confirmed venue for the 2032 Games, Carrara Stadium on the Gold Coast is an example of an existing energy-efficient option.\", \"Used for the athletics and opening and closing ceremonies at the 2018 Gold Coast Commonwealth Games, Carrara Stadium has a ring of solar panels circling the top of the stadium\\u00a0that supply\\u00a0roughly 20 per cent of the stadium's total electricity needs.\", \"<img
