The oversize exhibition space was meant to make room for large-scale objects and performance pieces that galleries could not fit in their standard fair booths.\", \"But the sideshow display of giant, colorful canvases, 3-D installations and multichannel videos ended up transforming the whole fair-going experience, adding a curated art option \\u2014 something more like a museum show \\u2014 to the seemingly endless grid of retail spaces that make up the event. At the booths, visitors shopped. At Meridians, they watched, walked through and interacted with the art. It made Art Basel Miami Beach more engaging.\", \"Part of the credit goes to the work; it was well received, as they say in the art world. But another part goes to the curator, Magal\\u00ed Arriola, who pulled together a lineup of artists, present and past, stretching up and down the Americas, including Fred Wilson, a New Yorker; the Cuban-born Ana Mendieta; and Luciana Lamothe, from Argentina.\", \"Ms. Arriola is well positioned to know art along this particular meridian. She is the director of Museo Tamayo in Mexico City, long a connection point between art and artists in the Americas. Her r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 as a curator includes shows in San Francisco; Bogot\\u00e1, Colombia; and Buenos Aires.\", \"\\u201cAnd I\\u2019m actually half-French, half-Mexican,\\u201d she said during a recent interview on the front steps of Museo Tamayo, which was closed for renovations. \\u201cI work mostly in the U.S. and Latin America, but I also have made connections to Europe.\\u201d\", \"In Mexico City, she was part of an ambitious group of artists and curators who began their careers in the mid-1990s. They collectively pushed the gallery scene to expand exponentially, morphing from a scattering of informal exhibition spaces to an established capital of contemporary art, with institutions like Museo Jumex and Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil showcasing international talents.\", \"In fact, she worked at both of those places, and as an independent curator, before taking the top job at Tamayo in 2019. She is known locally as the person who knows everyone.\", \"\\u201cI started at Carrillo Gil, and back then it was supposed to be more for younger artists \\u2014 and I was young at that time \\u2014 so I was working with my own generation of people,\\u201d she said. Her peers include central figures of the era, such as the artists Francis Al\\u00ffs and Yoshua Ok\\u00f3n and the gallerists Jos\\u00e9 Kuri and M\\u00f3nica Manzutto.\", \"Since then, she has maintained a forward-looking focus, helping emerging talents find platforms for their work. The first major curatorial effort at her current job, titled \\u201cOtrxs Mundx,\\u201d featured 40 artists, many of whom had never shown previously in a museum setting.\", \"\\u201cWhat I think is very important now is that, at Museo Tamayo, she has been very close to young artists. She is always working with new generations,\\u201d said Ana Mar\\u00eda S\\u00e1nchez Sordo, another prominent curator in Mexico City and currently the manager of Galerie Nordenhake, which will have a booth at Art Basel Miami Beach this year.\", \"The 2021 edition of Meridians will showcase a number of up-and-coming names, though Ms. Arriola said coordinating was different from curating typical museum shows, which are usually based on a theme or intended to serve as a retrospective of an artist\\u2019s career. Instead, the display is a roundup of big pieces that commercial galleries are looking to show off.\", \"\\u201cIt really takes shape out of what the galleries send,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIn some cases, of course, I have conversations that can orient things, but the result is mandated by whatever is put forward.\\u201d\", \"The projects that were proposed this year were distinct from 2019, mostly because of the pandemic, Ms. Arriola said, and there were fewer of them. Many artists were forced by the global lockdown to work from their homes instead of larger studios and simply did not have the space to produce substantial objects.\", \"She was also challenged to include galleries from Central and South America, where recovery from the pandemic has been slower than in the United States. \\u201cI did the same reaching out to Latin American galleries,\\u201d she said, \\u201cbut people are still catching up from two years ago.\\u201d\", \"Only one of those galleries will be present at Art Basel Miami Beach: A Gentil Carioca, in Rio de Janeiro, will bring a two-dimensional piece by the Brazilian artist Maxwell Alexandre, depicting \\u201cBlack bodies on brown paper, exploring the color brown\\u2019s sociopolitical connotation as a word to veil blackness,\\u201d according to the gallery\\u2019s description.\", \"Because, by default, this year\\u2019s show is heavy on galleries from the United States, it will reflect topics that dominated the social discourse in the country over the past 20 months, particularly the Black Lives Matter movement.\", \"\\u201cWhat you will find the most are all these different proposals that are dealing with race issues and class issues and power issues, which of course, are all somehow interlinked,\\u201d Ms. Arriola said.\", \"Among the works that fit in that broad category are Todd Gray\\u2019s 14-part, 30-foot-long \\u201cSumptuous Memories of Plundering Kings,\\u201d which examines the enduring fallout of colonialism and slavery (presented by New York\\u2019s David Lewis gallery). Also, there is a new painting, 20 feet long and 7 feet tall, by Conrad Egyir, a Detroit-based artist whose work mixes iconography from his native Ghana with references to present-day American culture (presented by the Jessica Silverman gallery of San Francisco).\", \"There is also one performance piece in the show: \\u201cContract and Release\\u201d by Brendan Fernandes, a series of six small sculptures inspired by a chair that Isamu Noguchi designed as a set piece for a 1944 ballet performance of \\u201cAppalachian Spring\\u201d by the Martha Graham Dance Company. The prop was static, but Mr. Fernandes\\u2019 versions rock precariously and dancers will try to balance themselves upon them, investigating notions of freedom of movement and imposed restrictions. (The piece will be presented by Chicago\\u2019s moniquemeloche gallery.)\", \"\\u201cContract and Release\\u201d will be activated over about 538 square feet \\u2014 more space than some entire art fair booths are allotted \\u2014 and so it is exactly the type of work Meridians makes possible at Art Basel Miami Beach.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a really great opportunity to show something which could only otherwise be seen in a museum,\\u201d said the gallery\\u2019s owner, Monique Meloche.\"]","href_hash":"e4591782503411ecb8ac430814490bde"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e4591782503411ecb8ac430814490bde"}},
