\"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Crisis setting in</div>\", \"Since the summer, thousands of migrants, mostly from the Middle East, have flocked to Belarus to try to enter Europe through neighbouring EU member states Poland, Latvia or Lithuania.\", \"The West accuses Minsk of having lured the migrants with the promise of an easy crossing into the EU and then forcing them to stay at the border as retaliation for sanctions imposed over the regime's suppression of dissent in the ex-Soviet country.\", \"Anxious not to repeat the migration crisis of 2015, the EU has backed Poland, Latvia and Lithuania, who have barricaded their borders despite the deaths of nearly a dozen migrants.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b0657aa553acc7485b6159fea4b61d19\\\"

cannon in freezing temperatures on a crowd of hundreds of people who advanced on a border post after a week of living in a makeshift camp.\", \"Polish Defence Minister Mariusz Blaszczak warned on Wednesday that the crisis could last \\\"for months or even years\\\".\", \"Around 4,000 people are believed to be currently stranded along the Polish border, where the majority of the migrants are concentrated.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/048d7be971fbd28f71c1170b2e114024\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Migrants from the Middle

entrenched, the Belarusian authorities put up some 1,000 migrants in a \\\"logistical centre\\\" this week \\u2014 a move that could make the camp a semi-permanent presence on the borders of the EU.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What the sides are saying</div>\", \"The EU accuses Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko of engineering the crisis to force the Europeans to restart dialogue,

Poland is serving as a rampart \\u2014 the first in the line of defence of Europe to prevent an influx of migrants.\", \"Mr Lukashenko's main political and financial backer Moscow, for its part, has
