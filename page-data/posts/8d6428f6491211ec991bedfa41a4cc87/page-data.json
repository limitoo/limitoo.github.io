Kennedy. President Ronald Reagan started the tradition of sending the turkeys to a farm, instead of a table, and on Friday, Biden will pardon his first turkey.\", \"The pardon ceremony will take place in the Rose Garden and will give Biden a chance to reflect on the \\\"time-honored traditions of Thanksgiving\\\" and offer well wishes of a safe and healthy holiday to Americans, according to the White House.\", \"Set to begin at 3:15 p.m., Americans can watch the turkey pardon live on the White House's YouTube channel.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935813/watch-live-stream-turkey-pardon-biden.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">President Joe Biden will pardon a turkey on Friday in a ceremony in the Rose Garden.

They each weigh about 40 pounds and were raised near Jasper, Indiana. They were raised by National Turkey Federation Chairman Pihl Seger and Andrea Welp, a turkey grower, in cooperation with Farbest farms.\", \"\\\"I know the kids have really had a lot of fun raising the birds, especially dancing to loud music to try to get them used to all of the media attention for their big day,\\\" Welp said on Thursday, referencing her children.\", \"Representative Larry Bucshon, whose district includes the farm, said he's always in \\\"awe\\\" of the farm's expansive network that puts \\\"quality food on the table for millions of families across the globe.\\\"\", \"Technically speaking, Biden will only pardon one of the turkeys, as the other is an alternate. Luckily for them, however, both will get a reprieve and reside at Purdue University after they leave Washington, D.C.\", \"Historically, presidents have used the turkey pardon as a lighthearted event and an occasion to poke fun at themselves. During his first turkey pardon in 2017, Trump acknowledged that he overturned a number of former President Barack Obama's executive orders, but said his counsel informed the pardons Obama issued for Tater and Tot a year prior couldn't be revoked.\", \"\\\"So we're not going to revoke them,\\\" Trump said. \\\"So Tater and Tot, you can rest easy.\\\"\", \"In 2018, Trump joked that Carrots refused to concede the election to Peas and demanded a recount and in 2019, he joked that the turkeys \\\"already received subpoenas to appear in [Representative] Adam Schiff's basement,\\\" in a joke about the impeachment inquiry.\"]","href_hash":"8d6428f6491211ec991bedfa41a4cc87"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8d6428f6491211ec991bedfa41a4cc87"}},
