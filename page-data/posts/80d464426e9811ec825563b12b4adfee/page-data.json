His case was heard in Louisiana by Judge John Howard Ferguson, who ruled against Plessy, setting off a chain of events that led to the 1896 Supreme Court case.\", \"Descendants of the Plessy and Ferguson families were at the event.

Board of Education, which started the process of ending racial segregation.\", \"Governor Bel Edwards and other speakers at the event said the pardon highlighted the importance of acknowledging and educating the public about past injustices rather than promoting a sanitised version of history.\", \"In some US school districts, conservatives have sought to ban teaching of concepts from critical race theory, an academic framework that examines how racism has shaped American society.\", \"\\\"We cannot undo the wrongs of the past but we can and should acknowledge them and learn from them,\\\" said Phoebe Ferguson, a descendant of Judge Ferguson.\", \"-Reuters \"]","href_hash":"80d464426e9811ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"80d464426e9811ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
