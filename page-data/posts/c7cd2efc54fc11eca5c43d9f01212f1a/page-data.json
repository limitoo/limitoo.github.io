And at this year\\u2019s Games, every one of the competitors will be a woman.\", \"Men, of course, have been zipping down the bobsled track at the Olympics since 1924, first in four-man sleds and, since 1932, in two-man teams as well. It took until 2002 for women to get a two-person event, and ever since athletes and their supporters have been campaigning for a second.\", \"But rather than adding the four-person sled as a medal event for women, the International Olympic Committee has chosen monobob instead. (Men will continue to race in only two- and four-person sleds.)\", \"The event is one of seven additions to the Olympics program for 2022, and the only one of the group that will be contested only by women.\", \"Also being added are freestyle skiing big air jumping events for men and women (big air was already on the program for snowboarders) and a handful of mixed-gender classifications: a snowboard cross relay, a short-track speedskating relay, and team events in ski jumping and freestyle skiing aerials.\", \"Monobob, however, may get the most attention. The event was appealing to the I.O.C. in many ways, but particularly because of its competitive balance. The cost of entry for the smaller sleds \\u2014 a monobob might cost about $15,000, while a two-person is more like $70,000 \\u2014 and the need for only a single driver has democratized results: Brazil and Jamaica won medals at last season\\u2019s World Cup, for example, and a Cambodian recorded a top-10 finish.\", \"In addition, all monobob sleds will come from the same manufacturer, equalizing in part the technological advantages that wealthy nations have long enjoyed. In all the years of bobsled at the Games, only Germany, Switzerland, the United States, Canada and Italy have won more than one gold medal.\", \"Elana Meyers Taylor, a veteran American driver, has two silvers and a bronze at three Olympics in two-person bobsled. Now she is hoping to add a solo medal to her trophy case. While no American is yet fully qualified for the team, Meyers Taylor is in a strong position to return to the Games in the new event.\", \"The U.S. also has a strong contender in Kaillie Humphries, the gold medalist for Canada at the last two Olympics, and the reigning world champion in monobob and two-woman. She became a U.S. citizen this week. \", \"Drivers often learn in a monobob, which can be used as a development sled, but Meyers Taylor had never driven one until last January.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s a steep learning curve,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThey can skid out, they just don\\u2019t have the weight, the speed. They don\\u2019t glue to the curb the way a two-man does. They\\u2019re a ton more skittish.\\u201d\", \"The monobobs complete a bobsled course roughly two seconds slower than a two-person bob. \\u201cThe less weight you have, the slower you\\u2019re going to go,\\u201d Meyers Taylor said.\", \"While every team has a sled from the same manufacturer, they are not identical. The aerodynamics have to stay the same, but teams can make small modifications to gain an edge. \\u201cIt\\u2019s how you repair them, how you set up the bob,\\u201d Meyers Taylor said.\", \"Meyers Taylor and other international sledders recently spent three weeks testing the Beijing track that will host the Olympics. There were only two crashes in that time, Meyers Taylor said.\", \"\\u201cBut the course is challenging to be fast on,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a very tricky track. On the first two curves you can lose a lot of time.\\u201d\", \"Despite being a potential medal contender in both women\\u2019s events, Meyers Taylor said she had mixed feelings about monobob\\u2019s addition. Asked her favorite event, she replied with certainty: \\u201cFour-man. I have a huge preference for four-man.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe were fighting for four-man,\\u201d Meyers Taylor said. \\u201cPart of the draw of bobsled is the team aspect of it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c7cd2efc54fc11eca5c43d9f01212f1a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c7cd2efc54fc11eca5c43d9f01212f1a"}},
