This represents the ninth successful launch and landing of this Falcon 9 first stage booster, which has now been involved in six Starlink launch missions.\", \"According to the company's website, there have been 139 SpaceX launches since 2006, and of these, 129 have been Falcon 9 missions, making it \\\"the main workhorse for SpaceX.\\\"\", \"As well as accounting for over 94 percent of SpaceX rocket missions, Falcon 9s have a high success rate of over 98 percent, with just two mission failures in the history of its use.\", \"In addition to the current generation of Falcon 9 rockets known as \\\"Block 5\\\" models, SpaceX also currently has the more powerful Falcon Heavy rocket at its disposal. This rocket model has currently only flown three times, twice in 2019 and once in 2018, with more launches planned for the future.\", \"After already breaking its record for launches, SpaceX has more blast-offs still planned for 2021, with at least five more launches are planned for what remains of this year.\", \"The leaked email read: \\\"What it comes down to, is that we face a genuine risk of bankruptcy if we can't achieve a Starship flight rate of at least once every two weeks next year.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944764/falcon-9-launch.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">An image showing the launch of a Falcon 9 rocket.
