Gabrielle Hamilton is leaving us, she writes in her farewell column for The New York Times Magazine this week, closing her laptop on a column she\\u2019s written since 2016 and returning to the restaurant she was forced to shutter by the pandemic. That\\u2019s a boon to diners in New York but a sad day for those of us who luxuriated in her sentences and recipes, which now will appear only occasionally, like albino squirrels or snowy owls.\", \"Gabrielle\\u2019s column doesn\\u2019t have a recipe attached to it. It\\u2019s instead an exploration of the allegory of stone soup and what it\\u2019s like to cook a meal with whatever scraps and bits of food you have on hand. \\u201cYou start out with nothing but a smart and sincere idea and stay very faithful to your idea, keep your head down, do your work as you believe it should be done,\\u201d Gabrielle wrote. \\u201cYou stir your pot of water faithfully and contentedly and let the idea itself capture the imagination and curiosity of the villagers.\\u201d\", \"Somewhat self-servingly, that sounds like no-recipe recipe cooking to me, as in this whatever-you\\u2019ve-got fried rice. (Give that a try!) But it\\u2019s also a way of thinking about the communities we live in and feed, and how much we count on those at our tables to bring forth what they have for the communal good. Gabrielle has contributed much to ours, and I hope we can all raise our glasses to her in gratitude and tribute alike.\", \"Of course we\\u2019ve got plenty of new (actual) recipes to delight you this week as well. Yewande Komolafe explored the role of plant-based cooking in West Africa and the diaspora and brought us new recipes for roasted mushrooms in ata din din, a red pepper relish, the steamed bean cakes known as moin moin and coconut-lemongrass tapioca with caramelized citrus.\", \"Yotam Ottolenghi, meanwhile, offers a recipe for devil\\u2019s food cake with hazelnut praline, that is, in his words, \\u201ca rich, dark cake (for a rich, dark December).\\u201d You\\u2019ll want to sink your teeth into that.\", \"And Jerelle Guy has come through with some amazing ideas for Christmas morning (though I think they\\u2019d play well on any morning of the month): a raisin cinnamon roll wreath (above), cinnamon toast popcorn and eggnog overnight French toast.\", \"Thousands and thousands more recipes are waiting for you on New York Times Cooking. It\\u2019s true that you need a subscription to access them. Subscriptions support our work! If you haven\\u2019t already taken one out, I hope that you will subscribe today. (We are offering gift subscriptions as well.)\", \"Please get in touch with us at cookingcare@nytimes.com if anything goes sideways while you\\u2019re cooking or using our site and apps. Someone will get back to you. (You can also write to me if you\\u2019re particularly outraged or want to say hello. I\\u2019m at foodeditor@nytimes.com. I read every letter sent.)\", \"Now, it\\u2019s nothing to do with smothered pork chops or supernatural brownies, but I\\u2019ve been grooving through Neal Stephenson\\u2019s latest, \\u201cTermination Shock,\\u201d alternating between the doorstop-thick novel itself and Edoardo Ballerini\\u2019s commanding performance of the words in the audio version.\", \"Here\\u2019s an important and exceptionally well-done two-part series from The Boston Globe and The Press-Herald of Portland, Me.: The Lobster Trap, about the existential threat that climate change holds over Maine\\u2019s lobster industry and the people it feeds.\", \"The Wire has dropped its paywall for its archive of work by Greg Tate, the influential culture critic who died earlier this month, at 64. Please explore it.\", \"Finally, in The Times, Isabelia Herrera put me on to Jean Dawson and Mac DeMarco, \\u201cMenthol,\\u201d which she calls \\u201cgritted-teeth pop-punk, music for cheap cigs and driving with too many friends in the car.\\u201d I\\u2019m in.
