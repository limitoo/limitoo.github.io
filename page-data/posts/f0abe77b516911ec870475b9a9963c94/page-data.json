For the fiscal year that ended on September 30, 9 percent of Black inmates were granted parole while 23 percent of white inmates were approved.\", \"Additionally, since November of 2019, the board, composed of three members, has had 4,700 requests for pardons, with about an equal numbers of Blacks and whites. Only 18 percent of Black applicants were granted pardons compared to 24 percent of white applicants.\", \"This decreasing trend began when Jimmy O'Neal Spencer was charged with killing two women and a child in Guntersville in July of 2018 while on parole.\", \"\\\"It only took the one bad apple to have really changed this in the direction of 'Lock them up, throw away the key,'\\\" said Aimee Smith, an attorney who has represented clients before the board for about 20 years.\", \"Overall during the fiscal year, the board denied parole to 3,584 prisoners and granted only 648, making the approval rate for the last year lower than half the average for the past decade, which was 37 percent.\", \"Pardons have also decreased in the past couple years. The board granted just 27 percent of applicants in the last fiscal year, down from 79 percent two years ago.\", \"The prison population is mostly made up of inmates incarcerated for violent crimes, lowering the approval numbers, according to the head of an advocacy group for crime victims.\", \"\\\"I mean, there are some horrible, horrible crimes, and unless you sit there each and every day and listen to all of them, you don't realize how violent these people are,\\\" said Janette Grantham, state director of Victims of Crime and Leniency, or VOCAL. \\\"And when we let one of them out, they're going to go live next door to somebody.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941753/alabama-paroles-pardons-black-prisoners.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The low number of pardons and paroles reflect the a prison population mostly composed of inmates incarcerated for violent crimes, the head of an advocacy group for crime victims said.
