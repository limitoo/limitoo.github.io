He has a boy-next-door smile and an aw-shucks manner. He\\u2019s brawny. He hikes.\", \"But in April, in an emotional interview on \\u201cGood Morning America,\\u201d the former N.F.L. linebacker, who made hearts flutter two years ago as the virginal leading man on ABC\\u2019s aggressively heterosexual hit dating franchise \\u201cThe Bachelor,\\u201d said the no-going-back words \\u201cI\\u2019m gay.\\u201d\", \"Underwood, 29, brawls with contradictions. He\\u2019s a Christian who refuses to believe in the version of God he learned about as a Catholic altar boy. He loves football, but the locker room is where he felt most afraid to reveal his true self.\", \"Now he shops at Kohl\\u2019s and on Rodeo Drive. He has a boyfriend, and is also attracted to women, but is not bisexual. His Grindr tribes would probably be Clean-Cut and Rugged.\", \"So much identity straddling \\u2014 that\\u2019s what brings Underwood back to reality television for \\u201cComing Out Colton,\\u201d a new six-episode docu-series on Netflix that arrives Dec. 3. The series, which started filming before his \\u201cGood Morning America\\u201d appearance, is a heartfelt but carefully packaged diary, in which Underwood reveals his sexual orientation to unsuspecting family members, friends and others, and gets a crash course in gay.\", \"Underwood hopes the show helps people see how coming out can be a gift. But he also wants to make amends for going on \\u201cThe Bachelor\\u201d in a failed attempt, he said, to \\u201cbury being gay.\\u201d And to address troubles that arose in turn, including a restraining order filed against him by his ex-girlfriend and criticism that he\\u2019s cashing in on something he shouldn\\u2019t.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve lived my life so publicly straight, and I ran from a community I\\u2019ve belonged to my entire life,\\u201d he said over breakfast at Hugo\\u2019s, a diner on Santa Monica Boulevard he picked. \\u201cI knew there was going to be a lot of people who didn\\u2019t understand. Maybe at the end of these six episodes, people still don\\u2019t understand. But at least I\\u2019ve tried to undo the wrongs.\\u201d\", \"Underwood gets an assist on the series from his friend Gus Kenworthy, the skier and Olympian who came out as gay in 2015. Compared to Underwood, Kenworthy is a gay sage: He teaches Underwood what cisgender means (\\u201ccis means that your gender that you identify with is the same as the gender you were assigned at birth,\\u201d he explains in one scene) and sits with Underwood for a history lesson at the Stonewall Inn.\", \"An executive producer on the series, Underwood knows he has privilege and a platform, which is why he said he sought counsel from people who aren\\u2019t white gay cisgender men, including Nicole Garcia, a transgender Latina pastor. In an email, Garcia said Underwood could be a role model, especially to let young athletes know they \\u201ccan be male, athletic, gay and be successful, loved and respected.\\u201d\", \"This being reality TV, Underwood didn\\u2019t prepare the people he comes out to on camera \\u2014 what we see, he said, is their genuine reaction to the news that he is gay. Initially, that didn\\u2019t sit well with his mother, Donna Burkard, the first person he comes out to on the show. (Underwood\\u2019s parents are divorced but on good terms.)\", \"Burkard said her son\\u2019s revelation was a surprise, and she was uneasy with the camera but resigned to it. Then her mama bear emerged.\", \"\\u201cWe decided if we could help a single family, and hopefully multiple families, by showing the love and support that I believe I displayed, other gay men and women in hiding could see a flicker of hope that their parents are going to respond with open arms,\\u201d she said in a phone interview.\", \"Underwood\\u2019s biggest protector on the show is his father, Scott Underwood, who said he loves his son \\u2014 \\u201ca strong person,\\u201d he called him for coming out on national television. But did he have to get the news while they fished?\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not saying I\\u2019m upset about it, but I would have preferred it had been done differently,\\u201d he said by phone. But his son is \\u201can entertainer, let\\u2019s face it,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what he\\u2019s chosen to do for his career.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAm I going to say it\\u2019s for fame?\\u201d he added, referring to his son\\u2019s decision to star in the series. \\u201cNo. Did he come out on TV for money? Sure. But who in reality entertainment doesn\\u2019t leverage their life and put it all out there for money?\\u201d\", \"Check out Underwood\\u2019s recent Instagram post about the series, and it\\u2019s clear that a lot of people think his post-\\u201cBachelor\\u201d controversies should disqualify him from a Netflix deal. (Many others disagree.)\", \"An online petition with over 35,000 signatures as of late November asks Netflix to cancel the series because of stalking and harassment allegations that Underwood\\u2019s ex-girlfriend, Cassie Randolph, outlined in a restraining order she filed against him in September 2020. Randolph was the woman Underwood chose to marry on \\u201cThe Bachelor,\\u201d but their season didn\\u2019t conclude, as most do, with their engagement.\", \"In November 2020, Randolph dropped the order, and the two reached a private agreement that prevents much from being said publicly. Underwood has apologized for his behavior.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s more sad than anything else that I was ever even in a position to say the things I said to her or do the things I did,\\u201d Underwood said. Randolph did not reply to requests for comment.\", \"Jeff Jenkins, an executive producer of \\u201cComing Out Colton,\\u201d said a talent agent originally pitched the show to him as a reality series about Underwood and Randolph as a couple. When their relationship ended, Jenkins said, the show\\u2019s direction pivoted. Underwood met with him to explain that he was considering coming out.\", \"\\u201cWe saw the positive of him sharing his story,\\u201d said Jenkins, an executive producer of \\u201cI Am Cait,\\u201d a series about Caitlyn Jenner\\u2019s life as a transgender woman, with which \\u201cComing Out Colton\\u201d shares L.G.B.T.Q. reality show DNA.\", \"Asked about Underwood\\u2019s motives, Jenkins said: \\u201cHe already has fame and \\u2014 not to speak out of turn \\u2014 but this documentary is not going to make him rich.\\u201d\", \"Damla Dogan, Netflix\\u2019s director of unscripted series, wrote in an email that the streaming service trusted the producers to address Underwood\\u2019s \\u201ccomplicated story, which includes him taking accountability.\\u201d Asked how the show fits into Netflix\\u2019s strategy for queer programming, especially following the accusations of transphobia in Dave Chappelle\\u2019s most recent comedy special, \\u201cThe Closer,\\u201d Dogan said, \\u201cIt would be unfair to Colton to put the weight of all L.G.B.T.Q. representation on his shoulders.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOne person\\u2019s experience will not fill the void of queer stories on TV,\\u201d Dogan wrote in an email. \\u201cWe have to do better as an industry to highlight more kinds of lives and love.\\u201d\", \"Then there\\u2019s the timing. The series begins on Nov. 6, 2020, five months before Underwood revealed his sexuality on TV, which means he came out to his professional team before his family. To some, that appears more like a monetized career move than an unvarnished emotional reckoning.\", \"John Casey, the editor-at-large for The Advocate, wrote in an opinion column that Underwood \\u201chas failed women and the L.G.B.T.Q.+ community by deriding our coming out process, particularly for those of us who took on great peril to be ourselves.\\u201d\", \"Attempts to reach Casey were unsuccessful. The L.G.B.T. advocacy organization GLAAD, which is thanked in the show\\u2019s credits, declined to comment.\", \"Underwood said his hand had been forced because, as he also told Variety, he got an anonymous email last year from someone who claimed to have nude photos of him at a spa known for a gay clientele. He admits he was there, but the photos never surfaced. The first person he ever came out to was his publicist.\", \"Underwood knew his family had to be next. Having cameras around, he said, captured the drama but also held him accountable. He said he found comfort thinking: \\u201cToday you\\u2019re about to come out to your dad and you cannot run.\\u201d (He came out to people in his life off-camera, too.)\", \"The only time Underwood looked antsy in our conversation was while talking about his boyfriend of several months, the political strategist Jordan C. Brown. Underwood didn\\u2019t say much other than that he was \\u201cvery happy and very in love\\u201d with Brown and that the two men\\u2019s families have met.\", \"\\u201cThe easiest way for me to say it is that it was like me bringing a girl home,\\u201d Underwood said, blushing and sounding like someone who really is new to this whole gay thing. \\u201cLike, nobody batted an eye.\\u201d\", \"Underwood isn\\u2019t sure what comes next \\u2014 maybe another gay TV project of some kind. His priority, he said, is doing something he has never been good at. \\u201cI have to take care of myself first,\\u201d he said.\", \"And that means social media, Christians, gay guys, Bachelor Nation, everybody else will have to wait.\", \"\\u201cIf it does not make me happy and it does not fulfill me, I don\\u2019t want anything to do with it,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"d22fb99450fd11ecadbd77e2cddf63f3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d22fb99450fd11ecadbd77e2cddf63f3"}},
