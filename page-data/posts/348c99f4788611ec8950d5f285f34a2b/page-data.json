But while many people have been urging President Biden to \\u201cfocus\\u201d on inflation, there have been many fewer suggestions about what he might actually do. (Wander around the White House muttering, \\u201cI\\u2019m focused, I\\u2019m focused\\u201d?) For the most part, controlling inflation is now a matter for monetary policy, and the main thing Biden can do is let the technocrats who control money do their job \\u2014 which means not engaging in Trump-style haranguing of the Federal Reserve.\", \"One thing the Biden administration has been doing, however, is trying to toughen up antitrust policy, arguing that highly concentrated ownership in many industries \\u2014 largely a result of decades of lax regulation \\u2014 is helping keep prices high and possibly contributing to recent inflation.\", \"I\\u2019d describe this initiative as controversial, except that there\\u2019s hardly any controversy, at least in the media: Biden\\u2019s linkage of monopoly power to inflation is facing vehement, almost hysterical, criticism from all sides, including many progressive commentators. And I find that vehemence puzzling; I think it says more about the commentators than it does about the administration.\", \"Let\\u2019s stipulate that monopolies aren\\u2019t the reason inflation shot up in 2021 \\u2014 because there was already plenty of monopoly power in America back in 2020. True, profit margins, as measured by the share of profits in gross domestic product, have increased quite a lot recently:\", \"Most of that rise, however, probably reflects big returns to companies, like shippers, that happen to own crucial assets at a time of supply-chain bottlenecks. It\\u2019s possible, as Senator Elizabeth Warren has suggested, that some companies are using general inflation as an excuse to jack up prices, abusing their monopoly power in ways that might have provoked a backlash in normal times; that\\u2019s certainly not a crazy argument, and making it doesn\\u2019t make Warren the second coming of Hugo Chavez. Still, such behavior can\\u2019t explain more than a small fraction of current inflation.\", \"But as far as I can see, the Biden administration and its allies aren\\u2019t claiming otherwise. They\\u2019re simply emphasizing monopoly power because it\\u2019s one thing they might be able to do something about.\", \"And where is the policy harm? On one side, toughening up antitrust enforcement in sectors like meatpacking is something the U.S. government should be doing in any case. On the other side, there\\u2019s no hint that the administration\\u2019s antimonopoly rhetoric will lead to irresponsible policies elsewhere.\", \"As I said, all indications are that Biden and company will leave the Fed alone as it raises interest rates in an effort to cool demand. And I haven\\u2019t seen any important Democratic figure, inside or outside the administration, calling for Nixon-style price controls. The most interventionist policy that seems remotely possible would be something like John F. Kennedy\\u2019s jawboning of the steel industry after an obviously coordinated jump in steel prices \\u2014 and it\\u2019s hard to imagine Biden sounding nearly as hard-line and critical of big business as Kennedy did in that speech, as you can see in the video below.\", \"So why the barrage of criticism, not just from the right \\u2014 which was to be expected \\u2014 but from the center and even the center-left?\", \"I don\\u2019t really know the answer, but I have a few suspicions.\", \"Part of the problem, I think, is an obsession with intellectual purity. Some policy wonks outside the administration apparently expect the policy wonks inside the administration \\u2014 many of them friends and former colleagues \\u2014 to keep sounding exactly the way they did when they weren\\u2019t political appointees. But look, that\\u2019s not the way the world works. Political appointees are supposed to serve the politicians who appointed them. Dishonesty or gross misrepresentation of reality isn\\u2019t OK, but emphasizing the good things one\\u2019s employers are trying to do is OK \\u2014 and part of the job.\", \"Beyond that, it sure looks as if many people who consider themselves progressive are made deeply uncomfortable by anything that sounds populist \\u2014 even when a bit of populist outrage is entirely justified by the facts. Imagine the reaction if Biden gave a speech sounding anything like Kennedy on the steel companies (again, video below). How many Democratic-leaning economists would have fainting spells?\", \"So here\\u2019s my suggestion: Give Biden and his people a break on their antitrust crusade. It won\\u2019t do any harm. It won\\u2019t get in the way of the big stuff, which is mostly outside Biden\\u2019s control in any case. At worst, administration officials will be using inflation as an excuse to do things they should be doing in any case. And they might even have a marginal impact on inflation itself.\", \"Did monopolization make supply chains vulnerable?\", \"Netflix is raising prices. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s about supply chains or labor shortages.\", \"Has Biden\\u2019s jawboning of the beef industry been working?\", \"The economics and politics of market concentration.\", \"Kennedy versus the steel industry.\"]","href_hash":"348c99f4788611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"348c99f4788611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
