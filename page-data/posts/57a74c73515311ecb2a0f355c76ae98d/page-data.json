countries, the University of Technology Sydney found it was Canberra's partners who were picking up much of the slack.\", \"UTS's Australia-China Relations Institute has released figures that show\\u00a0the value of 12 Australian exports to China affected by sanctions fell by $US12.6 billion ($17.3b) in the first nine months of this year compared with 2019.\", \"During the same period, the value of US exports of the same commodities increased by $US4.6 billion ($6.3 billion), while those of Canada and New Zealand jumped by $US1.1b and $US786 million, respectively.\", \"Insitute director James Laurenceson said the data showed Australia's pursuit of closer security ties with the US and other western democracies was not stopping its allies from capitalising on its trade predicament.\",

US\\u00a0and other Australian allies were understandable\\u00a0and in the national interests of those countries.\", \"But he said it was imperative Australia faced up to the cost of its own actions,

western economies were \\\"decoupling\\\" from a bloc led by China, the numbers suggested otherwise.\", \"\\\"But what I am suggesting is that we should be very clear on what the costs are and who is bearing those costs \\u2014 and\\u00a0it is Australia and Australian producers alone.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d92763ef0a0cb9721e6fae2fa143a9a5\\\"

who trades with whom,\\\" Dr Wilson said.\", \"\\\"And so what we're really seeing is international commercial businesses and markets adjusting around that dam wall between Australia and China,

coal, which highlighted\\u00a0the unpredictable\\u00a0nature of the fallout.\", \"He argued that a bigger issue at play was China's refusal to play by the rules of global trade.\", \"\\\"It's not the
