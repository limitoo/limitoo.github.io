Instead common symptoms include a runny nose, sneezing, headaches and fatigue.\\u00a0\", \"This research is backed up by anecdotal evidence from doctors in the United States. Washington emergency room doctor Gregg Miller told Fortune patients with Omicron \\\"are less likely to lose a sense of smell\\\" than those with Delta.\\u00a0\", \"Other common COVID-19 symptoms include brain fog, feeling dizzy or lightheaded and eye soreness.\\u00a0\", \"Symptoms of Omicron in vaccinated people overall seem to be less severe than Delta but the World Health Organization is warning it shouldn't be seen as mild.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It does not mean it should be categorised as mild. Just like previous variants, Omicron is hospitalising people, and it's killing people,\\\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus\\u200b said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"In fact, the tsunami of cases is so huge and quick that it is overwhelming health systems around the world.\\\"\", \"The Government has released a COVID-19 readiness checklist after New Zealand moved to the red traffic light setting.\\u00a0\", \"The checklist urges Kiwis to make a plan for if they or one of their family members gets sick or has to isolate, to gather the information they will need, share the plan with household members and friends and reach out to friends and whanau.\\u00a0\", \"It also has advice for dealing with COVID-19 symptoms such as a sore throat and fever.\\u00a0\", \"For a sore throat, the Government suggests nasal sprays, lozenges and cough mixture as well as honey, kawakawa or other balms, and ice blocks. For fever and pain relief, paracetamol and ibuprofen are suggested.\"]","href_hash":"a789b69a7cb311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a789b69a7cb311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
