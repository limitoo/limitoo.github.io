land.\", \"\\\"We haven't decided the exact location yet but we're looking at developing a project around 500 to 1,000 megawatts in an area between George Town and Flinders Island,\\\" he said.\",

consultant Marc White has raised doubts about whether the ambitious project will go ahead.\", \"\\\"These projects are certainly reliant on the Marinus interconnector,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"A lot of the offshore wind projects are quite speculative in nature and that's because they're really reliant on the national market.\", \"The interconnector is set to play a key role in whether the project stacks up financially.\", \"\\\"The Marinus interconnector is really the linchpin\\u00a0for that size project.\\\" Mr White said.\", \"There's a number of wind farm proposals in the state.\\u00a0Some
