She detailed a relationship with a married teacher who she said had begun grooming her when she was 16 years old. They began a sexual relationship shortly after her 18th birthday, she said.\", \"Ms. Rohl said that she had asked to read the letter aloud virtually from her home in Gainesville, Fla., at a school board meeting on Nov. 15 but that the board had denied her request, saying only people who were physically present could speak, Ms. Rohl said.\", \"So she booked a plane ticket to New York.\", \"At the board meeting, Ms. Rohl found she was not alone. Over a dozen alumnae followed her remarks at the podium. One after another, they spoke of sports coaches who had touched them inappropriately when demonstrating techniques, teachers who had texted privately with students and had them at their homes unsupervised, and a predatory culture so well-known that older girls would warn incoming seventh graders which teachers they should stay away from.\", \"For many it was a moment long past due, the #MeToo movement at last sweeping through Babylon, forcing a confrontation with a culture that they believe put students in danger.\", \"\\u201cThis is so normalized that in retrospect, if a teacher came over and touched you \\u2014 touched your shoulder, touched your hair, commented on your body \\u2014 the thought that it would ever be something worth reporting was not on anyone\\u2019s radar,\\u201d Ms. Rohl said in an interview.\", \"After the meeting, which stretched past midnight, five additional teachers were placed on paid leave while the concerns were being investigated, according to several people present and news reports. The school district would not say whether the removals had resulted from the allegations. According to the Suffolk County Police Department and the Suffolk County District Attorney\\u2019s Office, no charges have been filed relating to any of the allegations.\", \"Linda J. Rozzi, the Babylon schools superintendent, did not respond to an email requesting a response to the allegations.\", \"Deirdre Gilligan, a spokeswoman for the school district, declined to respond to any specific allegations, including claims that school officials, including the superintendent, had known about the issues for years and had done nothing. In an email, Ms. Gilligan said little more than that the school district had received the reports and was investigating.\", \"\\u201cThe district does not tolerate abuse of any kind, takes all allegations very seriously and is committed to acting upon each and every claim we receive,\\u201d Ms. Gilligan wrote in a statement. \\u201cWe commend the brave individuals for coming forward and sharing their voices.\\u201d\", \"The New York Times contacted the six teachers who were placed on leave, as well as other teachers who have been accused of wrongdoing, but did not receive responses from any. The Times is not naming those who have been accused because they have not been criminally charged and the accusations are still under investigation.\", \"The school district has taken some steps to try to address the allegations. This month, the Crime Victims Center, a Long-Island based nonprofit group that advocates for victims, will begin providing sexual harassment training for all school personnel. The center will also conduct training for employees on their obligation to report child abuse or neglect; under New York State law, all school staff members who have contact with children must report such claims. The rule has been in effect for teachers since 1973.\", \"Still, calling the reports \\u201ctroubling,\\u201d Letitia James, New York\\u2019s attorney general, announced an investigation into the high school last month.\", \"Former students blamed the insular culture of Babylon, a mostly white, middle-class community, known for its quaint village atmosphere and beaches, as partially to blame. The small school has only about 100 students per grade, according to students; teachers have often taught entire families, sometimes several generations, fostering familiarity that can slip into intimacy, several alumnae said.\", \"\\u201cYou think that you\\u2019re in this respectable little town where nothing goes wrong \\u2014 you don\\u2019t lock your doors at night,\\u201d said Darcy Orlando Bennet, 30, who graduated in 2009. \\u201cBut you end up getting sexually assaulted by your teacher, and nobody believes you.\\u201d\", \"The concerns go beyond the six teachers who were reassigned. During her 10th-grade year, Ms. Bennet and others recalled, a tennis coach was investigated by the school after a student accused him of things like tapping students on the behind and lifting their skirts with his racket.\", \"The coach was removed from his position with the tennis team but remained a teacher of special education, she said. He retired in 2018, and no legal action was ever taken, she said. The school district did not respond to questions about the events. The man did not respond to a message left on his cellphone requesting comment.\", \"Some of the behavior being reported by alumnae rises to the level of illegality, including sexual harassment, endangering the welfare of a child, sexual abuse and sexual assault, said Laura A. Ahearn, the executive director of the Crime Victims Center. Since the school board meeting, Ms. Ahearn said, victims have contacted the center, which works with the county to provide support services for crime victims.\", \"In interviews with nine former students, several said that the first time they had spoken of their concerns was at the school board meeting. But others, like a New York City police officer who graduated from Babylon in 2008, said they had reported incidents to counselors and school officials while seeking help at the time, only to be rebuffed or even threatened with punishment themselves, accused of instigating the inappropriate behavior.\", \"The officer, Barbara Maier, 31, who asked to go by her maiden name because she said she wanted to maintain her privacy as a victim of sexual assault, said that when she reported it, school officials had threatened her with suspension, saying she had broken school rules by kicking her attacker and leaving campus without permission.\", \"\\u201cKnowing what I know now and comparing it to all these things from the past, my wheels started turning,\\u201d Ms. Maier, who still lives in the community, said. \\u201cI thought: \\u2018Wait, how come no one reported anything that was going on? How did this go on for so long?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Corinne Samon, 52, never reported an incident from 1982, in which she said a teacher had approached her in a shop room at Babylon and slapped her on the behind while making a lewd comment. She was 12 years old and in the seventh grade, she said.\", \"\\u201cAs a 12-year-old, there is so much shame and self doubt and blame,\\u201d Ms. Samon said, \\u201cand just this feeling of, \\u2018What did I do wrong?\\u2019 When we did nothing wrong.\\u201d\", \"In November, nearly four decades after the incident, Ms. Samon filed a police report, she said. Though the time for filing under the statute of limitations had expired, and no charges could be pressed, the exercise felt cathartic, she said.\", \"\\u201cI felt so good when I finally did that,\\u201d she said.\"]","href_hash":"8e21d81a580f11eca8558baf2e88c715"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8e21d81a580f11eca8558baf2e88c715"}},
