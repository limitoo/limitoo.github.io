The bill was backed by Senate Republicans and signed in August by Governor Greg Abbott.\", \"In the lawsuit's filing, the DOJ argues that the Texas bill violates a number of federal laws, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The acts helped to uphold the right to vote, which is guaranteed by the 15th Amendment.\", \"This was brushed off by Governor Abbott, who has previously called the law a \\\"paradigm\\\" for other states to pass similar measures, and has said that it would make it \\\"harder to cheat at the ballot box.\\\"\", \"Opponents, however, have argued that the law unfairly restricts access to voting for no specific reason.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926671/texas-voting-law.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The U.S. Department of Justice is suing the state of Texas over a new restrictive voting law that makes it harder for minorities and other groups to cast their ballots.

This includes blocking voters from getting answers to questions or receiving clarification on any portion of a ballot.\", \"The codified bill even states that assistors are to \\\"confine [their] assistance to reading the ballot to the voter.\\\"\", \"Texas has placed further restrictions on mail-in and absentee ballots, which the DOJ stated was already limited to \\\"a small subject of the electorate, even in the midst of a global pandemic.\\\"\", \"Senate Bill 1 further restricts Texas citizens by \\\"[disenfranchising] eligible mail voters based on paperwork errors or ommissions immaterial to their qualifications to vote.\\\"\", \"The lawsuit was filed by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, who sued the state seeking injunctive, preventative, and permanent relief for alleged violations of Texans' rights to vote.\", \"Also named in the lawsuit was a long list of previous court cases in which it was argued that Texas had applied similar voting restrictions.
