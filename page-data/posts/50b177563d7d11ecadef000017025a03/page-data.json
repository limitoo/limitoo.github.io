Given that her new book, \\u201cWonderland\\u201d (Phaidon) is an anthology of fashion images shot mainly for Vogue, that\\u2019s curious.\", \"But since the book, which arrives on Nov. 17, was built on Lewis Carroll\\u2019s \\u201cAlice\\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland,\\u201d perhaps it\\u2019s not so curious after all. As Alice confronts a cast of bewildering characters, she asks, \\u201cWho in the world am I?\\u201d Leibovitz, through fashion, poses the same question.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve grown doing work in this genre,\\u201d she said, \\u201cbut it didn\\u2019t go along with my perception about myself and my work. I come from a place where I want things to really matter.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAmbivalence and irony are in the book,\\u201d she told me later.\", \"As a student at the San Francisco Art Institute, Leibovitz was inspired by the gritty, spontaneous photography of Robert Frank and Henri Cartier-Bresson. Though she admired the fashion work of Richard Avedon, Helmut Newton and Irving Penn, she had no desire to emulate them. \\u201cI thought fashion was silly,\\u201d she said.\", \"We met at Studio 525 in Chelsea, where Hauser & Wirth was holding a five-day \\u201cWonderland\\u201d pop-up show during Fashion Week in September. (The Southampton outpost of the gallery will be showing some of the same photographs from Nov. 6 through Dec. 23.)\", \"Four gigantic screens projected a selection of Leibovitz\\u2019s work, from a pregnant Melania Trump in a gold lam\\u00e9 bikini, to Lady Gaga in Valentino haute couture. Leibovitz, who is 72, was moving gingerly on an aching hip that badly needs replacement surgery, pushing herself the way she did two months earlier when she shot puffers, parkas and jackets near an active volcano in Iceland.\", \"She was dressed in her typical uniform of black pants and matching shirt. That morning she\\u2019d asked one of her teenage daughters if she should wear a 20-year-old tattered blue shirt but was promptly told, \\u201cWear the black one.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m just a creature of comfort,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t imagine anyone is looking at me.\\u201d\", \"Leibovitz is one of the top portrait photographers in the world, but I\\u2019ve long been a fan of her fashion photography \\u2014 in many ways, I think it\\u2019s her strongest work. For most people, \\u201cWonderland\\u201d will be their first exposure to Leibovitz\\u2019s talent in this area.\", \"The 341 images in the book bear the hallmarks of the Leibovitz style \\u2014 masterly use of color, theatrical staging, artful interplay between artificial and natural light \\u2014 but the best of them live up to the book\\u2019s title. They are enchanting, wrapped in a visual narrative that showcases her gifts as a powerful storyteller.\", \"\\u201cWhen one typically does a fashion shoot the goal is to illustrate the clothes,\\u201d explained Phyllis Posnick, Vogue\\u2019s contributing editor and a frequent Leibovitz collaborator. \\u201cAnnie \\u2018dresses\\u2019 the picture.\\u201d\", \"When I complimented Leibovitz on the book, she replied, \\u201cI\\u2019ll believe that as far as I can throw you. I\\u2019ve been around the block too long.\\u201d\", \"Fifty years, in fact, starting as a photojournalist at Rolling Stone. She captured some of the most defining moments of the era, from President Nixon\\u2019s ignoble exit from the White House, to a naked John Lennon curled up in a fetal position around Yoko Ono. At Vanity Fair, she became known for her quirky, conceptual portraits of boldface names, including a nude, seven-months pregnant Demi Moore.\", \"Then, in 1993, the writer Susan Sontag, Leibovitz\\u2019s companion, encouraged her to deepen her work by documenting the conflict in Sarajevo. But in 1998, Vogue\\u2019s editor in chief, Anna Wintour, now Cond\\u00e9 Nast\\u2019s global editorial director, approached her about working for the magazine. A year later, she was sent to Paris during the couture shows to shoot a photo essay with its fashion editor, Grace Coddington. The story featured Kate Moss and Sean Combs, then known as Puff Daddy.\", \"Leibovitz, who had never attended a fashion show before, was \\u201cin awe,\\u201d she said of the artistry on display. \\u201cIt was like performance art.\\u201d The experience gave her a greater appreciation of fashion. \\u201cBut I could never be a bona fide fashion photographer,\\u201d she added, explaining that she thinks of herself as a \\u201cconceptual artist using photography.\\u201d\", \"James Danziger, whose gallery represented Leibovitz for over a decade, was the first to show her fashion images in 2006. \\u201cIt\\u2019s likely that historically these images, which are great fashion photographs, will best stand the test of time,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThis is the way it is in photography. Most celebrities are forgotten but fashion lasts.\\u201d\", \"Leibovitz continued at Vogue for the next 23 years, creating a substantial body of work but thought it was \\u201ctoo soft\\u201d for a book. Then Covid-19 happened, and she found herself quarantined with her three daughters at her 200-acre farm in Rhinebeck, N. Y. She\\u2019s owned the property for 25 years; it\\u2019s where her large family gathers \\u2014 she\\u2019s one of six children \\u2014 and where Sontag often used to write.\", \"In lockdown with her daughters for nearly a year, she was grateful for the time together. Two of her most fanciful photo essays in the book, \\u201cAlice in Wonderland\\u201d and \\u201cThe Wizard of Oz,\\u201d were shot when her daughters were young \\u2014 the oldest is now 20, the twins 16. \\u201cAt the time I was reading fairy tales to them, so I was really living in that world,\\u201d she said.\", \"The book also reawakened memories of Sontag. Leibovitz reminisced about the time Sontag read \\u201cAlice\\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\\u201d to her. \\u201cWe had blankets under a tree,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt was such a beautiful day, and Susan had such a wonderful voice.\\u201d\", \"Leibovitz shot the \\u201cAlice\\u201d pictures with Coddington in 2003, during Cond\\u00e9 Nast\\u2019s free-spending days, when no one blinked an eye about sending a crew of 30 to 40 people to a chateau in northern France. \\u201cWhen you look at each picture and how much time it took, it\\u2019s really mind-boggling,\\u201d Coddington said.\", \"The photographs were based on John Tenniel\\u2019s original illustrations in the Carroll book, including one of Alice squeezed inside the White Rabbit\\u2019s house. The set designer produced a replica, scaling it to the model Natalia Vodianova\\u2019s proportions. \\u201cThe house was really incredible, with a little table and chairs,\\u201d Coddington said. \\u201cBut Annie thought the windows were wrong, so the designer had to rebuild the whole thing.\\u201d\", \"Fashion designers were cast as characters in the book, among them John Galliano as the Queen of Hearts, Tom Ford as the White Rabbit and Marc Jacobs as the Caterpillar. Karl Lagerfeld, who had wanted to be the White Rabbit, appeared as himself.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve always loved the way Annie brings a sense of narrative or storytelling to her fashion images,\\u201d Wintour wrote in an email. \\u201cShe has an eye for character, conflict, romance, drama \\u2014 you always feel something interesting is happening, or about to happen, or has just happened.\\u201d\", \"In another fashion essay Leibovitz offers a hilarious parody of famous couture shoots of the past. In 1963, decades before Photoshop, Melvin Sokolsky took models out of the studio and shot them in a plexiglass bubble over different parts of Paris. Leibovitz placed Ben Stiller, reprising his \\u201cZoolander\\u201d role, inside a duplicate bubble and dangled it from a crane over the Seine. Karen Mulligan, Leibovitz\\u2019s longtime studio manager, recalled having to reassure Stiller\\u2019s worried publicist that if he fell in the river, scuba divers were on standby.\", \"A passionate researcher who loves history, Leibovitz is drawn to the narrative essays because they give her something to focus on besides clothes. In 2007, she traveled to Spain for a story based loosely on Hemingway\\u2019s \\u201cThe Sun Also Rises.\\u201d Leibovitz had planned to shoot Pen\\u00e9lope Cruz and Cayetano Rivera Ord\\u00f3\\u00f1ez, the great-grandson of the famous matador who\\u2019d inspired the character of the bullfighter in the Hemingway novel.\", \"\\u201cThe day before the shoot we heard that Cayetano had been gored by a bull and was heading to the hospital,\\u201d Mulligan recalled. \\u201cThen he suddenly showed up. He\\u2019d bandaged his own leg. We had to get him into those tight matador pants and blood kept seeping through.\\u201d\", \"Like Ord\\u00f3\\u00f1ez, Leibovitz seems to thrive on stress. \\u201cShe tortures herself and everybody else,\\u201d Coddington said. \\u201cBut she\\u2019s unique, and I admire the effort she puts into each picture.\\u201d Others who\\u2019ve worked with her say that her relentless perfectionism can lead to angry outbursts, but agree that she\\u2019s less reactive now.\", \"\\u201cI was ruthless in getting the photograph,\\u201d Leibovitz admitted. \\u201cI haven\\u2019t had the best behavior.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWorking with Annie isn\\u2019t for the faint of heart,\\u201d said Mary Howard, her set designer of 30 years, adding, \\u201cAnnie never wants to have regrets.\\u201d\", \"She also doesn\\u2019t want to lose control over an interview. We sat opposite each other at a long table that was piled with research material \\u2014 for me and on me. The latter was encased in see-through plastic and, according to Leibovitz, contained an email in which an unnamed person had written \\u201csome not very nice things.\\u201d I was tempted to ask, \\u201cLike what?\\u201d and then found myself glancing over to see if I could read it.\", \"Leibovitz kept her notes on her left. I kept my notes on my right. We were like two lawyers squaring off before a jury composed of giant digital celebrities surrounding us in the gallery. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if I have the ability to talk about the work while it\\u2019s flashing like this,\\u201d she said.\", \"But talk she did \\u2014 right through many of my questions. It was the first interview she\\u2019d done about the book and admitted she was nervous.\", \"Instead she discussed all the great work being done in photojournalism, and how she doesn\\u2019t understand why every form of photography isn\\u2019t embraced. \\u201cIsn\\u2019t it?\\u201d I asked. She replied, \\u201cWell, if something\\u2019s not real enough\\u2026.\\u201d Earlier when I\\u2019d asked her to define the meaning of the word \\u201cwonderland,\\u201d she said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s the opposite of real \\u2014 unreal.\\u201d As in fashion.\", \"\\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s the friction that makes the work so good,\\u201d I suggested.\", \"She paused. \\u201cPossibly.\\u201d\", \"Leibovitz was more comfortable discussing the book\\u2019s portraits. In 2007, she received the first of three commissions from the royal household to photograph Queen Elizabeth II, who was annoyed that she\\u2019d had to wear the full regalia of the ancient Order of the Garter.\", \"Leibovitz thought the queen\\u2019s tiara didn\\u2019t look right with the ornate robe, and in a BBC documentary, she\\u2019s heard saying, \\u201cCould we try without the crown? It will look better, less dressy.\\u201d The queen says, \\u201cLess dressy? What do you think this is?\\u201d But she ultimately removed the tiara.\", \"The pictures of Caitlyn Jenner for Vanity Fair represent fashion at its most transformative. The former Olympic decathlon gold medalist sported a number of outfits, including a gold corset and a black Zac Posen dress. \\u201cWe weren\\u2019t trying to do journalism,\\u201d she explained. \\u201cIt was a construction, an acquired look. We were there to support her as she became a woman.\\u201d\", \"When working for Vogue Leibovitz has to remind herself that even portraits need a fashion element. \\u201cI try to downplay it as much as I can,\\u201d she explained. \\u201cI\\u2019m totally on the subject\\u2019s side. Sometimes Vogue will help with the clothing, but Michelle Obama was adamant about wearing her own. \\u201d\", \"When Leibovitz went to photograph Senator Tammy Duckworth, the senator had already selected her outfit: a St. John Knits suit that she\\u2019d purchased on eBay. \\u201cShe explained that she got all her suits off eBay,\\u201d Leibovitz said. \\u201cI told her, \\u201cC\\u2019mon, let\\u2019s do it. I love that I get to have those little moments.\\u201d\", \"Leibovitz had trouble finding the perfect ending for the book, finally selecting a photograph from Alexander McQueen\\u2019s last collection in 2010. The brilliant 40-year-old designer committed suicide that year on the first day of New York Fashion Week. \\u201cMcQueen\\u2019s collection had been shipped to New York for Grace and me to shoot,\\u201d she recalled. \\u201cWe took it into a large building in Brooklyn, and as we lifted the pieces out, we thought, Let\\u2019s leave them in the shipping boxes.\\u201d\", \"Throughout the day, as Coddington and Leibovitz worked in silence, the light moved slowly across the room. Finally, it cast a beatific glow on the model standing in the wooden crate. Dressed in a coat tailored from lacquered gold feathers, she\\u2019s like a Renaissance archangel fearsome in her gilded glory.\", \"Leibovitz, the un-fashion photographer, captured the perfect fashion moment.\", \"Patricia Morrisroe is the author of \\u201cMapplethorpe: A Biography\\u201d and \\u201cThe Woman in the Moonlight,\\u201d a novel.\"]","href_hash":"50b177563d7d11ecadef000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"50b177563d7d11ecadef000017025a03"}},
