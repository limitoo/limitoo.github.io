Extending military support to Ukraine is critical now. We need more defensive weapons to be able to defend ourselves.\", \"\\\"This is a full-fledged war, a full scale invasion. It means that the losses are huge and very much hope that we will have enough strength, enough defensive weapons to be able to defend ourselves and that it will be enough for us to prevail.\\\"\", \"She said Ukraine would defend itself against Russia as it had no other choice.\", \"\\\"We stay firm, committed, we will resist, we are on our territory. Ukraine is a peaceful nation ... no one wants war, however we need to protect ourselves and we will do so. There is no other choice.\\\"\", \"\\\"We do not have another choice. We have a powerful enemy on our territory - and with all means which we have we try to protect our own territorial integrity and our state sovereignty.\\\"\", \"Ukraine had cut off diplomatic relations with Russia and was inviting partners to follow its example, she said.\", \"\\\"We deem it unacceptable to maintain diplomatic ties with the aggressor state which openly attacks its neighbour without any reason. We count upon the proper reaction by the international community.\", \"\\\"Now the masks have fallen, we see that Russia - which has repeatedly insisted it was no party to the conflict - is now to be the country it has always been and all Ukrainians are now provided with the opportunity to defend themselves, to defend their country and ultimately to defend their future.\", \"\\\"Under the shellings were children, women, elderly people and we see that instead of seeking ways to deescalate the situation Russia is putting more pressure on Ukraine, on Europe, on the entire world.\\\"\", \"She said Russian troops were suffering losses - personnel as well as more than 30 tanks, up to 130 armoured combat vehicles, seven airplanes and six helicopters.\", \"\\\"The whole security architecture of the world is at stake. We need to stay vigilant and to act now.\\\"\", \"She said Ukraine was very grateful for the support shown so far by New Zealand.\", \"\\\"We enjoy excellent relations with New Zealand ... we are really grateful and we appreciate all the signs of support.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"d2b3bbf095f811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d2b3bbf095f811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
