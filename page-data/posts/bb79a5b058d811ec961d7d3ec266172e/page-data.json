Something in me instead wanted to see the wonderful Al Hirschfeld drawings of Sondheim\\u2019s shows and characters over the decades \\u2014 how Hirschfeld captured the beating hearts of \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d and \\u201cCompany\\u201d and \\u201cFollies\\u201d and \\u201cSweeney Todd\\u201d and \\u201cSunday in the Park With George\\u201d and \\u201cInto the Woods\\u201d and more.\", \"As a boy growing up in the Boston suburbs in the 1970s, Hirschfeld\\u2019s images were my first ticket to Broadway, transported by their publication in the Times\\u2019s Arts & Leisure section. And they were also how I formed an early bond with my parents, one that endured over time and even into their years with Alzheimer\\u2019s.\", \"My parents weren\\u2019t really Sondheim fans; they loved \\u201cSend In the Clowns\\u201d because of Judy Collins, not his \\u201cA Little Night Music.\\u201d But they grew up going to Broadway shows and revered Sondheim\\u2019s mentor Oscar Hammerstein II and Hammerstein\\u2019s shows with Richard Rodgers; \\u201cOklahoma!\\u201d was the first musical they took me to, in Boston, when I was 6. Around that time, I asked my parents why we got The Times when we didn\\u2019t live in New York. They said they still considered themselves New Yorkers and they loved Arts & Leisure and the stories \\u200band drawings \\u200babout theater.\", \"The drawings? Those were Hirschfeld\\u2019s. You can \\u200bsee some of them \\u200bin \\u200ba new guest essay this morning \\u2014 nine Hirschfeld drawings of Sondheim shows on Broadway, with an accompanying essay by Ben Brantley, a former chief theater critic of The Times.\", \"I wanted to showcase the drawings in Opinion to make the case for why they are more evocative and kinetic than even the best photos and videos of Sondheim\\u2019s shows, an argument that Ben builds beautifully. But I also wanted \\u2014 hoped \\u2014 that others might enjoy seeing these drawings once again in The Times (or for the first time) and thinking about \\u200bhow they fell in love with theater. His drawings were like a lifeline for my parents to New York City over the decades, and they helped open the door for me to Sondheim.\", \"This is how:\", \"I made my way to New York in 1989, as a freshman at N.Y.U., where I met a dorm mate who looked like Hirschfeld\\u2019s drawing of Little Red Ridinghood from Sondheim\\u2019s \\u201cInto the Woods.\\u201d Her name was Danielle \\u200bFerland, and it turned out she was Little Red in the original 1987 Broadway production of that musical. To be classmates with someone who had been on Broadway in Sondheim\\u2019s shows was one thing; for her to have also been immortalized by Hirschfeld was a whole different level of fame. (I told my parents about this Hirschfeld-in-the-flesh excitedly by phone.)\", \"Danielle and other friends introduced me to Sondheim\\u2019s music and lyrics, well beyond \\u201cSend In the Clowns,\\u201d and some of the songs I heard evoked the Hirschfeld drawings I remembered: \\u201cAmerica,\\u201d from \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d and Hirschfeld\\u2019s portrait of Chita Rivera, who played Anita, and \\u201cMove On,\\u201d from \\u201cSunday in the Park With George,\\u201d and Hirschfeld\\u2019s drawings of Bernadette Peters and Mandy Patinkin from that production. Look at the images in our guest essay and see how Hirschfeld\\u2019s black lines almost vibrate with life \\u2014 the \\u201cwhorls and swirls and loops\\u200b,\\u201d as Ben writes.\", \"\\u200bAs my parents grew older, it was harder to take them to see shows with me. But in my years as the theater reporter at The Times, they would ask what I was seeing in New York and were delighted to hear about Angela Lansbury performing in a 2009 revival of Sondheim\\u2019s \\u201cA Little Night Music.\\u201d They remembered her bulging eyes from Hirschfeld\\u2019s drawings; they remembered seeing her on Broadway long ago. They couldn\\u2019t remember the name of that show, but it was a thrill all the same.\", \"About a decade later, I took my mother to see Lerner and Loewe\\u2019s \\u201cMy Fair Lady\\u201d at Lincoln Center Theater. In spite of Alzheimer\\u2019s, she whispered the lyrics to \\u201cThe Rain in Spain\\u201d by heart. She still remembered Broadway. It would be the last show she saw. She is in assisted living now, and my father has passed. In a way, this guest essay is for them. Images, like songs, can stir such specific and happy memories; Mom recalling the lyrics to \\u201cThe Rain in Spain\\u201d is one of my happiest. When I see her this Christmas, I will take my book of Hirschfeld drawings to show her and see if she remembers them.\"]","href_hash":"bb79a5b058d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bb79a5b058d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}},
