Removing parking is just going to kill businesses in those areas.\\\"\", \"Holmes, who was also on the Hibiscus and Bays Local Board, was concerned changes under the plan would not require local sign-off, with no obligation to provide replacement parking elsewhere.\", \"Auckland resident Abhi Kumar gave the idea a thumbs down when he spoke to RNZ on Dominion Road.\", \"\\\"I think it's a terrible idea. The infrastructure for public transport isn't good enough to do that. There's already nowhere to park, businesses are suffering because of that ... I think there needs to be other incentives to minimise traffic.\\\"\", \"He said some newly built town houses already had insufficient road-side parking.\", \"Meanwhile, Aucklander Annie Mein supported the parking strategy, saying it was time for people to jump on their bikes or the bus.\", \"\\\"We need to get over our use of cars ... those metal boxes have had their day.\\\"\", \"Auckland Council's planning committee will vote on the proposal today.\", \"If approved, the strategy will go out for public consultation next year.\"]","href_hash":"d24e66de3cd811ec9836000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d24e66de3cd811ec9836000017025a03"}},
