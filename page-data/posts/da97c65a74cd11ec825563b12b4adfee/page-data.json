Many are living without things that most take for granted: running water, indoor plumbing and sanitation.\\u00a0\", \"The $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill that President Biden signed into law in November provides nearly $12 billion to fix the problem. That funding is desperately needed in rural Alabama.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"When there is a lot of rain, you cannot flush the toilet,\\\" Perman Hardy, who lives in Lowndes County, Alabama, told CBS News.\\u00a0\", \"If the toilet is flushed, sewage would be on the floors of Hardy's house.\\u00a0\", \"In the unincorporated areas of this county, where Martin Luther King Jr. famously led a march from Selma to Montgomery, there's no municipal sewage system.
