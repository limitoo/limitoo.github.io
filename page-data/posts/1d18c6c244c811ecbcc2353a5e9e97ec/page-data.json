It was a tight game as usual,\\\" Bok captain Siya Kolisi told reporters. \\\"I was so happy with the team to stay disciplined and keep adding to the scoreboard.\", \"\\\"We were able to go back to what we know in the second half. Every time we carry we go in as hard as we can.

Unfortunately, we were second best at times. We've almost shot ourselves in the foot and it hurts.
