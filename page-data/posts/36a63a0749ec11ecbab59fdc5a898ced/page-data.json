His body was then dragged several blocks to the Elks Arch, a large landmark in downtown Dallas. Brooks was strung up on a telephone pole and lynched on the corner of Main and Akard Streets.\", \"\\u201cWhile the attorneys were preparing the motion, a mob entered the courtroom and killed the defendant,\\u201d Judge Robert Seay wrote in the court record. \\u201cCase dismissed.\\u201d\", \"The arch was dismantled less than a year later, but on Saturday morning, a new landmark will be erected where it once stood. In a ceremony at the site of Brooks\\u2019s lynching, the Dallas County Justice Initiative plans to unveil a historical marker acknowledging the crime that occurred 111 years ago. Local advocates say the marker will be the first memorial of its kind for a lynching victim in Dallas County.\", \"\\u201cEverybody knows J.F.K. was assassinated here in Dallas, we have no problem recognizing that part of history,\\u201d George Keaton Jr., executive director of the nonprofit organization Remembering Black Dallas, said in a recent interview. \\u201cBut when it comes to our people of color, the sins and the wrongdoings that white America has done to our people, they do not want to be known.\\u201d\", \"According to Christopher J. Dowdy, chief academic officer at Paul Quinn College in Dallas, Brooks had been fixing a furnace in the home of a white family on Feb. 27, 1910, when the family\\u2019s 3-year-old daughter, Mary Ethel Beuvens, went missing. Brooks, who was believed to be 59 years old, was found with the toddler less than four hours later. For his research project, \\u201cDallas Untold,\\u201d Dr. Dowdy combined the sensationalized local articles from the time with court records to provide a textured account of what happened to Brooks.\", \"After the man and the child were examined by doctors, Brooks was charged with rape. Dr. Keaton said there was no proof of that crime and the child had no injuries.\", \"An estimated 5,000 people witnessed the lynching at Elks Arch, a three-story white, blue and purple structure that marked the main entrance to the city, according to Dr. Dowdy. Its white metal was inscribed with the name of every county in Texas.\", \"The Dallas County Justice Initiative, which is also led by Dr. Keaton, worked to secure funding for the marker from the Community Remembrance Project of the Equal Justice Initiative, which \\u201ccollaborates with communities to memorialize documented victims of racial violence.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOne of the great tragedies is that there are many lynchings that we\\u2019ll never know anything about, because there was just no way to document them,\\u201d Bryan Stevenson, the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, said in an interview. \\u201cAnd so this marker for Allen Brooks represents what happened to him, but it also represents what happened to thousands of other people, many of whose names we\\u2019ll never know.\\u201d\", \"Next month, the Dallas County Justice Initiative plans to hold a second ceremony honoring Reuben Johnson, who was lynched in 1874.\", \"\\u201cMost Americans know very little about this history when it is so central to the American story,\\u201d Mr. Stevenson said.\", \"While the two historical markers will represent only a small fraction of the racial violence that took place in a state where at least 335 lynchings of African Americans occurred, Dr. Keaton said, they\\u2019re more than he could have imagined 20 years ago.\", \"\\u201cThis means a lot to me,\\u201d Dr. Keaton said. \\u201cIt means that Dallas has moved forward.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"36a63a0749ec11ecbab59fdc5a898ced"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"36a63a0749ec11ecbab59fdc5a898ced"}},
