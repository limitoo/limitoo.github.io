Cockburn-Hood described the area as \\\"the saurian beds\\\", and we now know the marine sediments preserved fossils from 70 million years ago.\", \"McKay went to the Waipara during the winter of 1872, and he was spectacularly successful, collecting several partial skeletons of marine reptiles and hundreds of bones.\", \"Among this material were two rather unimpressive, compressed, semi-spherical groupings of bones. These sat in Canterbury Museum's storerooms, unidentified and stuck inside the concretions they were excavated in, for over 120 years.\", \"It would take until the late 1990s to realise the importance of the fossil. Museum preparator and famous fossil collector Al Mannering and his colleagues prepared these two unloved fossils, chipping away the stone to reveal the bones contained in the rocks.\", \"Visiting English scientist Arthur Cruickshank believed these fossils were remarkable and possibly similar to plesiosaur material he had seen from South America.\", \"In 2004, Canterbury Museum's geology curator Norton Hiller and Mannering published a paper, in which they suggested the two groups of bones, the size of soccer balls, were actually the two sides of the skull of the same animal - one remarkably similar to plesiosaurs from South America.\", \"In 2014, internationally renowned marine reptile experts Rodrigo Otero (Universidad de Chile) and Jose O'Gorman (Argentina's Museo de La Plata) visited New Zealand and examined the specimens. They concluded Hiller and Mannering were correct. The two halves were indeed from the same animal and the Waipara fossil was most similar to a group of plesiosaurs hitherto only known from Chile and Argentina.\", \"They described the Canterbury Museum specimens fully and gave them the scientific name Alexandronectes zealandiensis, Latin for Alexander's swimmer from Zealandia.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/108639/eight_col_Cover_image_v2.jpg?1599103223\\\" alt=\\\"No caption\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nSkull of the elasmosaur Tuarangisaurus keyesi, a long-necked marine reptile about eight metres long that lived about 80 million years ago, at the same time as the dinosaurs. \\nPhoto: Specimen from the National Paleontological Collections, GNS Science.

The results were extraordinary, showing previously unseen features of the anatomy.\", \"Without the CT scanning technology, these details could only have been seen by destroying the fossil. We examined the creature's inner ear and concluded, based on the orientation of the ear, that it maintained a posture where its head was habitually held either perpendicular to the body or just slightly below the body (not like Loch Ness monster fans would maintain, up in the air like a sock puppet).\", \"We also saw a feature known as the stapes, also unseen in plesiosaurs up until then. The stapes is a small umbrella-shaped bone in the middle ear which transmits vibrations from the eardrum to the inner ear.\", \"This work allowed us to conclude that Alexandronectes zealandiensis was an unusual plesiosaur.\", \"It belonged to a unique group of southern-hemisphere plesiosaurs now called the Aristonectinae. This group was part of the Plesiosaur family known as elasmosaurs. They were the last experiment in plesiosaur evolution, with the longest necks of all plesiosaurs.\", \"*Paul Scofield is an Adjunct professor at University of Canterbury\"]","href_hash":"0e51a0b06c2c11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0e51a0b06c2c11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
