Authorities from the Washington State Department of Agriculture (WSDA) tweeted a picture of the Asian giant hornet that had been caught in a beetle trap, saying the location it was found was within flight distance of destroyed nests.\", \"\\\"British Columbia authorities recently found an #AsianGiantHornet in a Japanese beetle trap not far from where nests were eradicated in Washington,\\\" the tweet said. \\\"The location was well within the flight distance from the U.S. nests.\\\"\", \"Asian giant hornets, also informally known as murder hornets, are an invasive species that was first identified in the U.S. in December 2019.\", \"It is the largest species of hornet in the world, measuring two inches in length. And its sting is incredibly painful. Nathaniel \\\"Coyote\\\" Peterson, a YouTube personality who films himself being stung and bitten by insects, described it as \\\"searing pain. Absolute searing pain.\\\"\", \"The WSDA said that the species is not normally aggressive towards humans, but occasionally mass hornet attacks can happen. It said that in extreme cases, humans can be crippled and even killed by Asian giant hornets. The venom of a murder hornet is similar to other stinging insects, but because of its large size it can deliver a larger dose.\", \"\\\"A sting can damage tissue and cause substantial pain,\\\" the WSDA said.\", \"Since they were first found in the U.S. and Canada, authorities have been working to eradicate any nests to prevent them from establishing a colony. The invasive species attack and destroy honey bee hives, with just a few murder hornets able to decimate a hive in hours. They go into a \\\"slaughter phase\\\" where bees are killed by decapitation.\", \"The destruction of bee hives has huge implications for the environment and local ecosystems, so ensuring they do not become a permanent presence has become a key issue to agricultural authorities.\", \"The first murder hornet found in the U.S. in 2021 was discovered by a resident living near Marysville in June. The  first murder hornet nest of 2021 was found in August in northern Washington. A second nest was found just a few weeks later, to the southwest of the first. The nests were destroyed, with one containing an estimated 1,500 insects at various stages of development.\", \"WSDA officials said the dead murder hornet found in the beetle trap likely came from one of these nests. One Twitter user suggested that the presence of a murder hornet on the U.S./Canadian border could mean there are more nests out there.\", \"In response, the WSDA said: \\\"Actually, the timing of the capture could mean it came from one of the nests we eradicated. Another is a possibility, too.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1925269/murder-hornet.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A dead murder hornet was found in British Columbia within flying distance of the nests eradicated by Washington state officials. </div>\"]","href_hash":"a01c2d643cb911ec846b000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a01c2d643cb911ec846b000017025a03"}},
