But Mr. Feldman gets it wrong: Lincoln did not break the Constitution.\", \"\\u201cContemporary observers \\u2026 understood that the Emancipation Proclamation left the original Constitution in tatters,\\u201d Mr. Feldman writes. Admittedly, some thought the proclamation unconstitutional, but Lincoln had carefully crafted the proclamation so that it was within his power under the Constitution.\", \"Mr. Feldman\\u2019s article leaves out a critical point. The Emancipation Proclamation did not free all enslaved people. It freed enslaved people only in territory controlled by the Confederacy. That made it a war measure sanctioned by the president\\u2019s power as commander in chief.\", \"We venerate Lincoln today, so it is important to understand his vision. Working within the framework of the document written in 1787, he championed a vision of the Constitution based on equality and liberty.\", \"William M. TreanorWashingtonThe writer is the dean of Georgetown Law Center.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Noah Feldman\\u2019s suggestion that Lincoln \\u201cbroke\\u201d the Constitution stands things on their head: The Constitution was \\u201cbroken\\u201d by the South when it seceded, not by Lincoln when he tried to keep the Union intact.\", \"Lincoln\\u2019s use of force against the South and his emancipation of slaves were not unconstitutional. In fact, Mr. Feldman\\u2019s arguments conflict with unmentioned Supreme Court decisions issued during and after the Civil War, most notably the Prize Cases, in which the court ruled that the Union blockade of Southern ports was constitutional.\", \"The Emancipation Proclamation also fell well within the strictures of the Lieber Code, which was issued in 1863 and set rules of conduct for Union soldiers. It was recognized then and now as the first comprehensive statement of the international law of war.\", \"Robert FabrikantWashingtonThe writer, a retired professor at Howard University School of Law, has written extensively about legal aspects of the Civil War, focusing on the Emancipation Proclamation.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"If only Noah Feldman would send a copy of his essay to the \\u201coriginalists\\u201d on the Supreme Court. Ideally he would add a question for them to consider: Which Constitution do you think the country needs now, the seriously compromised one the founding fathers felt required to enact, or the evolved one Lincoln employed at a time of national distress?\", \"Our current distress requires our justices to look carefully at their philosophies and hopefully have the vision and courage of Lincoln. Think voting rights! Will our Union evolve or regress?\", \"Hopefully they will take note of the irony that Lincoln was the first Republican to lead our country.\", \"Elizabeth BjorkmanLexington, Mass.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"I, for one, am weary of the hysteria, near panic and negativity over supply chain shortages or delays in food or gift items this season. Swapping out a pumpkin pie ingredient or a side dish seems a petty adaptation to what is likely a temporary inconvenience. If we need to modify the Thanksgiving menu or drop to our second-gift choice, who cares?\", \"Do we forget the isolation, dread, sickness and terrors one year ago when Covid ruled the land? And who would trade these adjustments for all that?\", \"Let\\u2019s get perspective, people! This holiday season we have vaccines, relief, travel, parties, smiles and open schools, stores and restaurants \\u2014 and an abundance of normality.\", \"The pandemic taught us to appreciate the bigger things: connection to people, health, nature and a more customary holiday time. Gratitude is not stuck in the container ship morass off the coasts.\", \"This year, whatever imperfections there may be, we know that \\u201cHappy Thanksgiving\\u201d is not an empty rote phrase, but a truly heartfelt sentiment.\", \"Mimi ReimelLanghorne, Pa.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cStaples Center in Los Angeles to Be Renamed Crypto.com Arena\\u201d (Business, Nov. 18):\", \"When I was a boy in Baltimore, the Orioles (and the Colts) played at Memorial Stadium, named to honor our veterans. There is no greater symbol of how American values have changed than \\u201cCrypto.com Arena.\\u201d\", \"I weep for what we\\u2019ve become.\", \"Charles MerrillNew York\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cRising Winter Heating Bills Loom\\u201d (Business, Nov. 9):\", \"While winter weather and the threat of inflation loom large, the disparate energy burdens faced by people of color, low-income households and those living in rural communities are nothing new.\", \"In rural, high-poverty towns like Albany, Ga., residents regularly receive electricity bills as high as $800 per month, in many cases more than they pay for rent, forcing many families to choose between keeping the lights on or having food on the table.\", \"Albany is just one example of a broader national problem, with millions of U.S. adults living in households unable to afford electricity, even in normal times.\", \"We need comprehensive policies that protect consumers from price gouging by utility companies and treat this issue like the crisis it is \\u2014 not only to provide immediate relief for hurting families, but also to make sure all households are able to affordably access essential public utilities at a national scale year-round.\", \"Mica WhitfieldAtlantaThe writer is Georgia state director for 9to5, National Association of Working Women.\"]","href_hash":"7cad3fc24aeb11eca12b936322fbc2a5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7cad3fc24aeb11eca12b936322fbc2a5"}},
