Here is everything you need to know.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-04T15:41:14.000Z","content":"[\"The first of Walmart's early Black Friday sales is now live, with reduced prices on a number of laptops, TVs, headphones and miscellaneous electronic devices.\", \"The retailer has multiple events lined up throughout November, each of which is dedicated to different item categories. For instance, there will be one later in the month that focuses specifically on discounts for lifestyle products.\", \"The sale that is currently running, however, is mostly about tech. This event started on Wednesday, November 3 and will continue until November 7, meaning that you still have plenty of time to check out what's on offer.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Walmart Early Black Friday TV Deals</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926277/samsung-55-inch-4k-smart-tv.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A 55 inch 4K Smart TV from Samsung is currently discounted at Walmart. </div>\", \"For example, there is a Sceptre 50 inch Ultra HD TV going for $248, which is marked down from $328. You will get an even bigger saving of $200 though if you plump for the Samsung 55 inch 4K Smart TV, but getting that one will set you back $847.99, so you will have to decide what best suits your budget.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Walmart Early Black Friday Gaming Deals</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926266/evoo-gaming-156-laptop.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Image shows the EVOO Gaming 15.6\\u201d Laptop that is currently on offer as part of Walmart's early Black Friday sale. </div>\", \"Meanwhile, gamers can choose from a variety of powerful laptops at Walmart, including one from EVOO gaming. Priced at $999, it has a 144 hz monitor, an Intel Core i7-10750H processor, a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2060 graphics card, a 512GB SSD, and 16GB of RAM.\", \"If that's a little too expensive, then you can also pick up a cheaper model from the same manufacturer (at a cost of $689.99) but this will obviously have lower specs. Elsewhere, the price for a Lenovo Flex laptop has been slashed down to $399 and the Acer Spin 3 is going for $529 (it was previously listed for $699).\", \"On the other hand, if you are more of a desktop person and are on the hunt for a new monitor, then there is a deal for the LG 32-inch UltraGear. This displays in a QHD resolution of 2560x1440, has a refresh rate of 165Hz and is capable of running in High Dynamic Range (HDR).\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Walmart Early Black Friday Headphone Deals</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926270/bose-quietcomfort-35-wireless-headphones-ii.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Image shows the Bose QuietComfort 35 II wireless headphones that are currently on sale at Walmart. </div>\", \"Outside of TVs and laptops, you can also get a pair of Apple AirPods for $114 at Walmart, which is lower than the recommended manufacturer's price. It is worth noting that earphones listed here are the second-generation models, so they wont have all of the shiny new features from the latest version.\", \"Sticking with the theme of listening devices, the Bose QuietComfort 35 II noise cancelling headphones are going for $179. For context, that is almost half their regular price at Walmart, so that is a good deal if you are seriously into music.\", \"Walmart also has some homeware deals running at the moment, with things like ice cream makers, grills and pans.
