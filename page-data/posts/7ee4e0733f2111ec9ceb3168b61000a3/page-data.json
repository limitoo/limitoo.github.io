Trump\\u2019s White House, an Atlanta district attorney is moving toward convening a special grand jury in her criminal investigation of election interference by the former president and his allies, according to a person with direct knowledge of the deliberations.\", \"The prosecutor, Fani Willis of Fulton County, opened her inquiry in February and her office has been consulting with the House committee, whose evidence could be of considerable value to her investigation. But her progress has been slowed in part by the delays in the panel\\u2019s fact gathering. By convening a grand jury dedicated solely to the allegations of election tampering, Ms. Willis, a Democrat, would be indicating that her own investigation is ramping up.\", \"Her inquiry is seen by legal experts as potentially perilous for the former president, given the myriad interactions he and his allies had with Georgia officials, most notably Mr. Trump\\u2019s January call to Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, urging him to \\u201cfind 11,780 votes\\u201d \\u2014 enough to reverse the state\\u2019s election result. The Georgia case is one of two active criminal investigations known to touch on the former president and his circle; the other is the examination of his financial dealings by the Manhattan district attorney.\", \"Ms. Willis\\u2019s investigation is unfolding in a state that remains center stage in the nation\\u2019s partisan warfare over the vote.\", \"The Biden Justice Department has sued Georgia over a highly restrictive voting law passed by the Republican-led legislature, arguing that it discriminates against Black voters. At the same time, Mr. Trump is aggressively seeking to reshape the state\\u2019s political landscape by ousting Republicans whom he considers unwilling to do his bidding or to adopt his false claims of election fraud. He is supporting a challenger to Mr. Raffensperger in next year\\u2019s primary, and has been courting possible candidates to run against the Republican governor, Brian Kemp. One Trump ally, former Senator David Perdue, is weighing such a run, while another, the former football star Herschel Walker, is eyeing a Senate bid. (A new governor would not have direct power to pardon, which in Georgia is delegated to a state board.)\", \"Instead of impaneling a special grand jury, Ms. Willis could submit evidence to one of two grand juries currently sitting in Fulton County, a longtime Democratic stronghold that encompasses much of Atlanta. But the county has a vast backlog of more than 10,000 potential criminal cases that have yet to be considered by a grand jury \\u2014 a result of logistical complications from the coronavirus pandemic and, Ms. Willis has argued, inaction by her predecessor, Paul Howard, whom she replaced in January.\", \"By contrast, a special grand jury, which by Georgia statute would include 16 to 23 members, could focus solely on the potential case against Mr. Trump and his allies. Ms. Willis is likely to soon take the step, according to a person with direct knowledge of the deliberations, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the decision is not final. Though such a jury could issue subpoenas, Ms. Willis would need to return to a regular grand jury to seek criminal indictments.\", \"Ms. Willis\\u2019s office declined to comment; earlier this year, in an interview with The New York Times, she said, \\u201cAnything that is relevant to attempts to interfere with the Georgia election will be subject to review.\\u201d\", \"Aides to Mr. Trump did not respond to requests for comment; in February, a spokesman called the Fulton County inquiry \\u201cthe Democrats\\u2019 latest attempt to score political points by continuing their witch hunt against President Trump.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Raffensperger made his view of Mr. Trump\\u2019s election meddling clear in a book released this month, on Election Day: \\u201cFor the office of the secretary of state to \\u2018recalculate\\u2019 would mean we would somehow have to fudge the numbers. The president was asking me to do something that I knew was wrong, and I was not going to do that,\\u201d he wrote.\", \"Of Mr. Trump\\u2019s call, Mr. Raffensperger wrote, \\u201cI felt then \\u2014 and still believe today \\u2014 that this was a threat.\\u201d\", \"A 114-page analysis of potential issues in the case was released last month by the Brookings Institution, with authors including Donald Ayer, a deputy attorney general during the George H.W. Bush administration, and Norman Eisen, who was a special counsel to President Barack Obama. The report concluded that Mr. Trump\\u2019s postelection conduct in Georgia put him \\u201cat substantial risk of possible state charges,\\u201d including racketeering, election fraud solicitation, intentional interference with performance of election duties and conspiracy to commit election fraud.\", \"Mr. Trump\\u2019s ongoing commentary about what took place in Georgia may not be helping his cause. In September, he held a rally in Perry, Ga., attended by thousands of followers, as well as Mr. Walker and Representative Jody Hice, who is running against Mr. Raffensperger.\", \"At the rally, Mr. Trump recalled how he phoned Mr. Kemp, who refused his entreaties to intervene.\", \"\\u201cBrian, listen,\\u201d Mr. Trump said he told the governor. \\u201cYou have a big election-integrity problem in Georgia. I hope you can help us out and call a special election, and let\\u2019s get to the bottom of it for the good of the country.\\u201d\", \"The Brookings authors asserted that these comments could help prosecutors establish \\u201cintent\\u201d to convince lawmakers to commit election fraud \\u2014 a crucial hurdle in proving a solicitation case against Mr. Trump.\", \"\\u201cI think he worsened his exposure with those comments,\\u201d Mr. Eisen said. \\u201cThe mere fact of his conversation with Kemp is evidence of solicitation of election fraud, because Trump\\u2019s demand was based on falsehoods. By commenting on it further at the rally, he offered the prosecution free admissions about the content of that exchange.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Willis has said a racketeering charge is on the table. Such cases are often associated with prosecutions of mob bosses, using the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, and Georgia has its own state version of the law.\", \"\\u201cI always tell people when they hear the word racketeering, they think of \\u2018The Godfather,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Willis said earlier this year, explaining that the concept could also extend to otherwise lawful organizations that are used to break the law. \\u201cIf you have various overt acts for an illegal purpose, I think you can \\u2014 you may \\u2014 get there.\\u201d\", \"One of her best-known prosecutions came in 2014 when, as an assistant district attorney, she helped lead a racketeering case against a group of educators involved in a cheating scandal in the Atlanta public schools.\", \"\\u201cFani\\u2019s personal experience with RICO cases will be a tremendous benefit,\\u201d said Gwendolyn Keyes Fleming, an author of the Brookings report and a former district attorney of neighboring DeKalb County.\", \"Building a racketeering prosecution in the election case would require prosecutors to detail an organized effort by Mr. Trump and his allies. One of them, Senator Lindsey Graham, called Mr. Raffensperger last November and asked whether all mail-in votes could be thrown out in counties with high rates of questionable ballot signatures. On Dec. 3, Mr. Trump\\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, appeared before a State Senate subcommittee, repeated conspiracy theories and pressed for the appointment of an alternative, pro-Trump slate of electors. He later made similar requests before a state House committee, saying Atlanta elections officials looked like they were \\u201cpassing out dope, not just ballots.\\u201d\", \"In late December, Mark Meadows, then the White House chief of staff, made an unannounced visit to Cobb County with Secret Service agents in tow, to view an election audit in process. (\\u201cIt smelled of desperation,\\u201d a top aide to Mr. Raffensperger, Gabriel Sterling, has said. \\u201cIt felt stunt-ish.\\u201d) Around the same time, Mr. Trump called Mr. Raffensperger\\u2019s chief investigator, asking her to find \\u201cdishonesty\\u201d in the election. He also called Chris Carr, the state attorney general, asking him not to oppose a lawsuit filed by the Texas attorney general challenging the election results in Georgia and other states.\", \"Some testimony in the congressional proceedings has already been of interest to state investigators, including that of Byung J. Pak, a former U. S. attorney in Atlanta who has told the committee that he resigned in January after learning that Mr. Trump planned to fire him for declining to spread falsehoods about rampant voter fraud in Georgia.\", \"Mr. Graham\\u2019s office declined to comment. Mr. Giuliani\\u2019s lawyer, Robert Costello, said he did not have time to discuss the case.\"]","href_hash":"7ee4e0733f2111ec9ceb3168b61000a3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7ee4e0733f2111ec9ceb3168b61000a3"}},
