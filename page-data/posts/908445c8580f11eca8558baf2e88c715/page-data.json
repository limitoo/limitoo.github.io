Mr. Hatfield made the mistake of congratulating Mr. Knight on his habit of walking eight miles a day and received a swift correction from his billionaire boss.\", \"\\u201cI was running,\\u201d Mr. Knight says dryly in a promotional video, bearing a slightly aggrieved expression. \\u201cJust running not very fast.\\u201d\", \"Nike makes shoes for sprinters and distance runners who cover all kinds of terrain. The conversation with Mr. Knight left Mr. Hatfield with an idea to design a shoe for a large, fast-growing and often overlooked market: runners who aren\\u2019t in a hurry.\", \"\\u201cThere needs to be a shoe for the slower runner,\\u201d Mr. Knight says in the ad. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s me.\\u201d\", \"What is not said explicitly in the video is that Mr. Knight is in his 80s. Age is never mentioned in any of the CruzrOne\\u2019s marketing copy. By positioning the CruzrOne as a shoe with excellent support for runners who \\u2014 for whatever reason \\u2014 go at an extremely slow pace, Nike can offer a product designed for the older athlete to the general market.\", \"It\\u2019s a perfect example of what Rob Chess, a Stanford Graduate School of Business lecturer, calls \\u201cstealth design\\u201d: a product that addresses specific needs of older consumers in a form that doesn\\u2019t scream, well, \\u201cold.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYou basically put all these elements in that make it much more usable by an older customer, but you don\\u2019t necessarily advertise and play up those elements,\\u201d Mr. Chess said. \\u201cOr if you do, you certainly don\\u2019t position them as, you know, \\u2018Gee, we\\u2019re doing this for older people.\\u2019\\u201d (A Nike spokesperson declined requests for interviews.)\", \"It\\u2019s part of a seismic shift in the way companies market to consumers who have lived past their 55th birthday. The large and rapidly expanding demographic has enormous spending power, yet it has historically been treated as a homogeneous group that spends its days either in the louche leisure of a Viagra ad or the frail dependence of a Life Alert spot.\", \"In contrast, longevity experts said, today\\u2019s most effective marketing campaigns focus on the specific needs a product or service addresses, and the lifestyle of the person buying it \\u2014 ideally without explicitly mentioning age at all.\", \"\\u201cI still see the word \\u2018senior\\u2019 and \\u2018elderly\\u2019 too often,\\u201d said Susan Golden, the director of dciX, a program of Stanford\\u2019s Distinguished Careers Institute for midlife professionals, and a lecturer at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. \\u201cThe idea is to market not to a name and not to an age, but to the stage of life or vibrancy.\\u201d\", \"As of April, U.S. households headed by people 55 or older held $92.3 trillion, or 69 percent of the country\\u2019s total wealth, according to Lowell Ricketts, a data scientist at the Institute for Economic Equity at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Older people today are wealthier than previous generations, and there are a lot more of them. By 2060, 95 million people in the United States will be 65 or older, up from 52 million in 2018, and constitute 23 percent of the population, up from 16 percent, according to the Population Reference Bureau, a nonprofit research group in Washington.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re the biggest opportunity, and the fastest-growing opportunity,\\u201d Mr. Chess said.\", \"One reason so few products target older adults is a belief among many entrepreneurs that they are less willing to change brands or discover new products, said John Zapolski, founder and chief executive of Alive Ventures, a start-up studio that invests in brands focused on older people. Another is that a lot of people whose birth dates might qualify them for the demographic don\\u2019t like to think of themselves as old, or don\\u2019t recognize themselves in the version of old presented in a particular ad.\", \"A marketing campaign that positions a product for an aging consumer is unlikely to attract younger buyers, said Joseph Coughlin, founder and director of the AgeLab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\", \"\\u201cBut guess what?\\u201d he added. \\u201cWe also know that old people will run with their hair on fire away from it.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Coughlin said companies instead needed to position their products as being for \\u201can ageless lifestyle\\u201d that \\u201ckeeps people engaged and productive, healthy and well.\\u201d\", \"On one hand, this approach risks dressing up the same social stereotypes and pressures in new language, akin to the magazine covers exhorting readers to \\u201cget healthy\\u201d rather than explicitly telling them to lose weight, or makeup ads promising skin that looks \\u201crevitalized\\u201d without using the word \\u201cyounger.\\u201d\", \"On the other, focusing on consumers\\u2019 actual needs instead of their assumed age has the added benefit of appealing to all of a product\\u2019s potential users. An example offered by Margaret Morganroth Gullette, a cultural critic and resident scholar at the Women\\u2019s Studies Research Center at Brandeis University, is the recent marketing campaign for the absorbent underwear Depend.\", \"\\u201cThis is an athlete, 20 reps deep,\\u201d an announcer intones in a 2020 ad as a middle-age woman works out outdoors, \\u201cand sprinting past every leak.\\u201d In another TV spot, a woman who does not appear old enough to collect Social Security leads a business meeting.\", \"Not all older people have use for absorbent underwear, but everyone with incontinence does: people who are pregnant or postpartum, who are taking certain medicines, who have bladder conditions or any number of temporary or recurring health issues.\", \"\\u201cIt was making absorbent underwear dignified and part of an ordinary life,\\u201d Dr. Gullette said. An ad that acknowledges this bodily reality, rather than just showing an older model, she said, is \\u201cin some ways more revolutionary.\\u201d\", \"The CruzrOne, with its marketing campaign\\u2019s focus on pace rather than age, is another such example. Some older runners might prefer a shoe for a slower pace, but so might novice runners, or someone recovering from an injury. In this new approach to marketing, age matters less than the lifestyle of the buyer, Dr. Golden said: \\u201cA 65-year-old and a 25-year-old could be as excited and engaged in life, or an 80-year-old could be running marathons.\\u201d\", \"This last part, at least, is something Nike has long acknowledged. In the very first televised Nike ad featuring the famous \\u201cJust do it\\u201d slogan, in 1988, the camera zooms in on the Golden Gate Bridge, where a bare-chested runner is making his daily 17-mile trek, Nike Airs on his feet, gray chest hair rippling in the morning breeze.\", \"\\u201cPeople ask me how I keep my teeth from chattering in the wintertime,\\u201d Walt Stack, then 80, explains to the camera. \\u201cI leave them in my locker.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"908445c8580f11eca8558baf2e88c715"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"908445c8580f11eca8558baf2e88c715"}},
