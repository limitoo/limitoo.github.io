The health minister, Olivier V\\u00e9ran, said that over 400,000 vaccination appointments had been booked on Wednesday.\", \"V\\u00e9ran said the current wave would be \\u201cstronger and longer\\u201d than the one over the summer but that \\u201cno lockdown, no curfew, no store closures, no travel restrictions\\u201d would be enforced.\", \"Instead, V\\u00e9ran said, by focusing on vaccinations and social distancing measures, \\u201cwe are making the choice to reconcile freedom and responsibility.\\u201d\", \"Numbers: About 70 percent of the population is fully vaccinated. But the number of new daily cases has spiked to about 30,000 over the past few days.\", \"Kids: The European Union\\u2019s drug regulator approved the Pfizer vaccine for young children. For many, protection can\\u2019t come soon enough: In France, the surge has led to the closure of 8,500 school classes, up from 4,100 last week.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"The tennis star\\u2019s accusation of sexual assault against a former vice premier has shaken the Chinese Communist Party\\u2019s veneer of morality.\", \"Before Peng Shuai\\u2019s accusation, Zhang Gaoli was best known as a low-key technocrat. As he quietly ascended to top leadership, he skirted scandals and controversy. One of the few profiles of him in the Chinese media described Zhang, 75, as \\u201cstern, low-key, taciturn.\\u201d\", \"Now, Peng\\u2019s allegation has made Zhang a symbol of a political system that prizes secrecy and control. Her accusation raises questions about how far the party\\u2019s elite carry their declared ideals of clean-living integrity into their heavily guarded homes.\", \"Background: Early in Xi Jinping\\u2019s term as the Chinese leader, lurid reports about officials\\u2019 sexual misdeeds at times surfaced in state media, disclosures intended to signal that he was serious about purifying the party. Now, Xi\\u2019s priority appears to be fending off scandal. References to Peng\\u2019s account were nearly wiped off the internet inside China.\", \"Many alumni of Darul Uloom Haqqania madrasa, one of Pakistan\\u2019s largest and oldest seminaries, are now ruling Afghanistan.\", \"Administrators of the madrasa \\u2014\\u00a0located close to the Afghan border \\u2014 argue that the school has changed and that the Taliban should be given the chance to show they have moved beyond their bloody ways.\", \"But its critics call it a university of jihad and blame it for helping to sow violence across the region for decades. They also worry that extremist madrasas, potentially emboldened by the Taliban\\u2019s victory in Afghanistan, may fuel radicalism in Pakistan.\", \"A wide reach: The Haqqani Network \\u2014 the Taliban\\u2019s military wing, responsible for hostage takings, suicide attacks and targeted assassinations \\u2014 is named after the madrasa and retains connections there.\", \"Notable alumni: The foreign minister, the higher education minister, the justice minister, and the acting interior minister, who led much of the Taliban\\u2019s military efforts and carries a $5 million bounty from the U.S. government on his head.\", \"As you get this newsletter, people across the U.S. will be preparing to celebrate. Here\\u2019s some holiday news.\", \"If your accordion breaks in Mexico City, you take it to Francisco Luis Ram\\u00edrez. He has kept untold numbers of the country\\u2019s beloved instruments playing during more than 50 years in business.\", \"The annual British visual arts award, founded in 1984, used to celebrate a buzzy individual artist. But for the past three years, there has been no single winner.\", \"In 2019, artists surprised judges and shared the prize. During the coronavirus pandemic, prize organizers distributed funds. This year, judges will draw a winner from a shortlist of five collectives, each of whose work has as much to do with social activism as it does art.\", \"The nomination of these collectives underlines the quandary for the Turner Prize today: Is its role to capture the zeitgeist, or to reward excellence?\", \"Some celebrated the move as an anticapitalist decision. Others mocked it as a kowtow to performative social justice creators. \\u201cIt\\u2019s all well and good having these views, which are probably genuine \\u2014 but where is the bloody art?\\u201d one longtime critic of the prize said.\", \"Read the full article here.\", \"These crispy shrimp cakes are served with an herby, chile-flecked mayonnaise that\\u2019s sort of like a tartar sauce, but spicier.\", \"Our critic calls \\u201cDrive My Car,\\u201d a Japanese film about grief, love and art based on a short story by Haruki Murakami, a \\u201cquiet masterpiece.\\u201d\", \"If you\\u2019re trying to \\u201clook rich,\\u201d check out the Round Jacket, a puffer that Kanye West designed for Gap.\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: Unlocked (four letters).\", \"And here is today\\u2019s Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.
