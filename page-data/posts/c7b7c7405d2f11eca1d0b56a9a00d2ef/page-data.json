The treasury secretary said that is an example of how the money could go directly to help local businesses.\", \"\\\"Here, it's very easy to connect the policy with the personal,\\\" Yellen said. \\\"What this will do is prevent small business owners of color from closing two of their locations. And better yet, it will help people open two more.\\\"\", \"The funds will be distributed in packages of over $200 million for the largest banks, and under $100,000 for smaller institutions.\", \"The funding announcement is part of $12 billion for CDFIs and minority banks set aside in legislation that Harris helped write when she was a U.S. senator for California, which passed in late 2020. That follows an investment of $1.25 billion in COVID relief funds to over 800 similar lenders in June, per Reuters.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952015/kamala-harris-janet-yellen-treasury.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Vice President Kamala Harris speaks during the Freedman Bank Forum as Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen look on in Washington Tuesday.
