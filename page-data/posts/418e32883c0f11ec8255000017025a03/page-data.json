Progressive Democrats have pushed for the measure, which would go beyond what other cities have done to overhaul policing, while moderate Democrats and Republicans have expressed alarm about a rise in violent crime and called instead for improving the current system.\", \"\\u201cThey need to be restructured, but don\\u2019t get rid of them,\\u201d said Carman Mahone, a customer-service worker who opposes the amendment, calling it the most important issue on her ballot. \\u201cWe need them. Have you seen all this shooting and everything going around?\\u201d\", \"But patience with the status quo has worn thin in Minneapolis. Many residents share stories of unpleasant encounters with police officers, or of the fear they felt during the civil unrest that overwhelmed the city last year.\", \"If the amendment passes, the Minneapolis Police Department would cease to exist, and the City Council would have more oversight of a replacement agency. That new department would almost certainly still employ armed officers to respond to some emergencies, but there would no longer be a required minimum number of officers.\", \"Jason Chavez, a City Council candidate whose ward includes the site of Mr. Floyd\\u2019s murder, said he supported the ballot item and a public safety approach that focused more on addressing the root causes of crime.\", \"\\u201cPeople oftentimes are like, \\u2018Look, I don\\u2019t feel safe when a cop is near me, but I also don\\u2019t feel safe walking outside,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Chavez said as he and campaign workers held signs at a busy intersection on Tuesday morning. \\u201cWe should not have a system that does that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"418e32883c0f11ec8255000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"418e32883c0f11ec8255000017025a03"}},
