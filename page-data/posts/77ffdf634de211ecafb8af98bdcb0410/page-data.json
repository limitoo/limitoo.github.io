They\\u2019re the way we open and start cars now \\u2014 and more \\u2014 and it\\u2019s unlikely the primitive keys of the past are coming back.\", \"At an upstate New York gathering of the International Motor Press Association before the pandemic, members spent a day tooling about roads near Bear Mountain in lots of new cars. I took turns in an Alfa Romeo, two BMWs, a Volvo, two Volkswagens, a Lexus, an Acura \\u2026 and I forget the others.\", \"Not once did I touch an ignition key.\", \"Certainly, the shift from cranks and solenoids and bits of small metal to remote, wireless contraptions isn\\u2019t only about science and technology. There are elements of convenience, design, ecology and fashion. But mostly it\\u2019s about science and technology.\", \"Sometimes, however, one might wish for a real key; the alternatives are not bulletproof. Tesla drivers recently punched up the smartphone app they use to unlock and start their cars. The app was not responding, as a server had gone down. The Tesla key \\u201ccard\\u201d would work \\u2014 Tesla\\u2019s version of a fob \\u2014 but drivers who depended on their phones were stuck. The problem was sorted out fairly quickly, and Elon Musk, the company\\u2019s chief, tweeted apologies.\", \"\\u201cIt was Chrysler in 1949 that introduced the key that operated the combined ignition and starter switch,\\u201d said Brandt Rosenbusch, manager of historical services for the former Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (now called Stellantis). \\u201cPrior to this,\\u201d he added, \\u201ccars were started by turning a key to power the ignition and drivers then pushed a starter button either on the floor or instrument panel.\\u201d Before the 1960s, most vehicles required a separate coded key to switch on the ignition and one to open the doors or trunk.\", \"Many years ago, after I was newly licensed, I\\u2019d regularly ask Dad, \\u201cCan I have the keys?\\u201d That meant just one thing: can I take the car? Usually he\\u2019d toss them over, one key for the ignition, one for the doors of the Oldsmobile. \\u201cBe careful,\\u201d he\\u2019d say.\", \"Do teenagers today ask, \\u201cDad, can I have the fob?\\u201d\", \"It took decades for the fob \\u2014 believed to be related to the German word fuppe, meaning pocket \\u2014 to acquire remote capabilities and send coded radio signals to a receiver in the vehicle. Often the first \\u201cfob function\\u201d was allowing drivers to lock and unlock the doors. Advancements in technology granted it the ability to open the trunk, activate an alarm system and eventually develop \\u201csmarts\\u201d: simply carry it into the cockpit and push the \\u201cstart\\u201d button on or near the dash. The new technologies also help to foil the best efforts of the gone-in-60-seconds bandits.\", \"Some 20th-century keys developed personalities. Volkswagen favored the switchblade key, which slid out of the fob like a shiv. Some ignition keys that were coded were usable only in a particular car. In Volvo\\u2019s new electric XC40 Recharge S.U.V., the \\u201cstart\\u201d function is in the driver\\u2019s seat: with the fob in a pocket, he need only place his backside on the cushion and the motor starts. When he lifts (off the cushion, that is) the engine stops.\", \"Years ago, the engineers for the Porsches that raced at Le Mans determined that locating the ignition to the left of the steering wheel saved time on the race start. Drivers of other cars had to use their right hands to first start the engine and then to engage first gear. At Porsche, the left hand turned the key and the right engaged the gear shift simultaneously: Most of today\\u2019s Porsches place the ignition switch on the left.\", \"Several vehicle operating functions have already been outsourced to smartphones. For example, an app for some BMWs can remotely start the auto; it will run for 15 minutes, heating or cooling the cabin, before automatically shutting off. But some type of hardware \\u2014 a wireless fob, round or square, with tiny buttons to open and close doors, hatches, windows and sunroofs, and perhaps a \\u201cpanic\\u201d function to set off the car\\u2019s alarm system \\u2014 will most likely remain until mobile devices \\u201celiminate the need for a physical piece of hardware altogether,\\u201d said Todd Parker, director of global design for General Motors.\", \"The march of key-fob progress is assuredly unstoppable, and the ultimate recipient \\u2014 the car buyer \\u2014 is in its cross hairs. At the Volvo of Queens dealership in Bayside, Peter Fearon, a salesman, said the migration from metal key to electronic controller was a fait accompli. \\u201cEverything in the car is computer controlled,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEverybody\\u2019s happy.\\u201d\", \"Not everybody, said John Albanese, who works at Bayside Volkswagen next door to Volvo.\", \"\\u201cUsually older people, they don\\u2019t like the push button to start the car,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re afraid they\\u2019ll forget to shut off the car. They think it\\u2019ll somehow fail. A young person just wants to talk to the car. \\u2018Start the car, drive me home.\\u2019 It\\u2019s a totally different mind-set.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Albanese, who has been selling automobiles of assorted brands for 43 years, also suggests that modern fob devices complicate the delivery process. \\u201cWe explain the functions but half the time what we tell customers goes in one ear and out the other,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd the owner\\u2019s manual \\u2026 well, that\\u2019s never touched, never opened.\\u201d\", \"There\\u2019s also the question of replacing a lost modern fob. Figure more than $200, Mr. Albanese warns, \\u201cand then each key has to be programmed, because each car is different.\\u201d (I recall surreptitiously copying the ignition key for Dad\\u2019s Oldsmobile: $1.75.)\", \"Whatever. Mr. Parker of G.M. believes that the modern key \\u201cis enabling us to completely redefine the vehicle ownership experience.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cCar keys \\u2014 no matter what form they take \\u2014 will create a seamless bridge between an individual driver\\u2019s unique preferences and the vehicle itself,\\u201d he added. \\u201cOur vehicles will automatically adjust settings like cabin temperature, lighting, music and seat positioning prior to even opening the door.
