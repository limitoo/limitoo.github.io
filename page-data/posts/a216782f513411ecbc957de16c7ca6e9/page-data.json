Leonard, a senior researcher at the Department of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona. Leonard spotted it at the Mount Lemmon Observatory in the Santa Catalina Mountains, Arizona, Space.com reported.\", \"Scientists are hoping that in December C/2021 A1 Leonard might be close enough and bright enough to be seen with the naked eye.\", \"Speaking to astronomy magazine Sky at Night last week, comet chaser Jos\\u00e9 J. Chamb\\u00f3 said the comet's brightness had increased \\\"dramatically\\\" when he took two photos of it a couple of weeks apart last month.\", \"The comet might be moving incredibly fast relative to Earth, but because it's covering such a huge distance, C/2021 A1 Leonard may be visible after sunset for several days.\", \"According to Sky at Night, the comet may become visible to the naked eye between December 10 and December 16, peaking in brightness on December 13.\", \"Meanwhile, the Virtual Telescope Project is due to host a live-stream of the comet on December 8. It's due to host the stream starting at 4 a.m. UTC (11 p.m. ET on December 7) on its webTV page here.\", \"An orbit diagram of C/2021 A1 Leonard is available on TheSkyLive and shows how its path around the sun is highly elliptical\\u2014meaning instead of having a circular orbit like Earth does, it is shaped like an oval.\", \"As such it will swing into the inner solar system, crossing the orbital path of Venus, before shooting off into space once again in a sling-shot effect enabled by the sun's immense gravity.\", \"It's not due to return again for tens of thousands of years, and it's thought it last visited us about 70,000 years ago, Space.com reported.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Position in the Night Sky</div>\", \"The comet's position in the sky will change daily. Charts showing its location are available to see on EarthSky.org, which states it will start off being visible in Northern Hemisphere skies before becoming visible in the Southern Hemisphere later on.\", \"Comets are giant balls of ice and rock traveling through space, producing long tails behind them whenever they pass near the sun.\", \"Whenever Earth passes through one of these comet tails, the fragments burn up in our atmosphere which is what causes meteor showers.\", \"Arguably the most famous comet is Comet 1P/Halley, also known as Halley's Comet. It can be observed from Earth about once every 75 years.\", \"Meanwhile the next meteor shower will be the Geminids, which are due to peak on the night of December 13 to December 14, according to the American Meteor Society.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941498/girl-using-telescope.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A file photo of someone standing in the twilight pointing a telescope at the sky.</div>\"]","href_hash":"a216782f513411ecbc957de16c7ca6e9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a216782f513411ecbc957de16c7ca6e9"}},
