The Australian Open begins on Monday.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-01-16T10:57:57.000Z","content":"[\"Novak Djokovic, the top men\\u2019s tennis player in the world, was detained on Saturday by border authorities in Australia, the latest turn in a legal dispute over his travel visa that has drawn interest around the world and inflamed tensions during a rapidly spreading coronavirus outbreak.\", \"The Australian minister for immigration revoked Djokovic\\u2019s travel visa for the second time on Friday because of concerns that Djokovic had violated the country\\u2019s rules intended to limit the spread of the virus, arguing that his high-profile status could harm the nation\\u2019s battle against the coronavirus.\", \"The matter could be resolved in a courtroom showdown Sunday at 9:30 a.m. local time. If the decision to cancel the visa is upheld, Djokovic, 34, could be forced out of the Australian Open tennis tournament and deported, a stunning development should it unfold that way. Then again, if the court rules in favor of Djokovic and allows him to remain, that would be equally shocking to many people who feel the player has already received preferential treatment.\", \"Both sides are expected to submit legal papers laying out their arguments to the court on Saturday after Djokovic was ordered to attend the hearing remotely by video from his attorney\\u2019s offices.\", \"Djokovic\\u2019s legal team asked that a full panel of judges hear the case rather than a single judge, which would mean the court\\u2019s decision on the matter could not be appealed. Justice David O\\u2019Callaghan said he would inform the parties later on Saturday of his decision on that question.\", \"Djokovic was appealing the most recent ruling in a case that has highlighted the global challenge of balancing the fight against the coronavirus and a return to so-called normal life, amid a swirl of political ramifications.\", \"The matter has produced outrage in Australia and beyond. Djokovic, who refuses to be vaccinated, has long held unorthodox and unscientific views of health. Many see the visa controversy as his devious attempt to leverage his status as an elite sports star to flout rules followed by ordinary Australians and others who travel there. The law states that anyone entering the country is required to be vaccinated against the coronavirus unless they have a medical exemption.\", \"In Serbia, Djokovic\\u2019s home country, and elsewhere, the ongoing incident is seen by some as an unfair attempt to prevent him from winning a record 21st Grand Slam by defending his title at the Australian Open, which begins Monday. Earlier in the week, his supporters clashed with police in Melbourne.\", \"In a statement explaining why he revoked Djokovic\\u2019s visa a second time, Alex Hawke, Australia\\u2019s minister for immigration, argued that if Djokovic were allowed to remain in Australia and play, the influential tennis star could harm efforts to combat the virus. The government has conceded that Djokovic poses no imminent threat to spread the disease. It is more about the example it would set by allowing him to stay.\", \"\\u201cGiven Mr. Djokovic\\u2019s high-profile status and position as a role model in the sporting and broader community,\\u201d Hawke said in a statement, \\u201chis ongoing presence in Australia may foster similar disregard for the precautionary requirements following receipt of a positive Covid-19 test in Australia.\\u201d\", \"Djokovic\\u2019s lawyers argue that the government unfairly based their decision to revoke his visa again on the premise that Djokovic would engender anti-vaccine sentiments and not on the rule of law.\", \"All of it comes during a surge in coronavirus cases globally, and particularly in Australia, which has endured long lockdowns and restrictions. Initially, sentiment in Australia seemed to support Djokovic because he came to Melbourne under the impression that he had a legal exemption. But as more information emerged, including false statements and Djokovic\\u2019s cavalier approach after he tested positive in December, the mood has largely turned against him.\", \"Djokovic was initially given an exemption to the federal requirement that everyone entering Australia be vaccinated against the coronavirus so that he could play in the Australian Open. It was granted based on a positive test he took in Serbia on Dec. 16. But soon after he arrived at the Melbourne airport on Jan. 5, he was detained by the federal authorities and sent to a hotel for refugees and asylum seekers.\", \"A judge quickly rescinded the detention order on procedural grounds, saying that Djokovic had not been given a fair opportunity to consult with representatives and allies, like the organizers of the tournament. He was allowed to leave detention and hit the practice courts and prepare to compete for what would be his fourth consecutive Australian Open title and record 10th over all.\", \"But an investigation revealed irregularities and inaccurate statements on Djokovic\\u2019s visa application \\u2014 which Djokovic later acknowledged and apologized for on Wednesday. The documents failed to state that Djokovic, who lives in Monte Carlo, had traveled between Serbia and Spain during the 14 days ahead of his arrival in Australia. Djokovic attributed the error to human oversight by one of his handlers.\", \"The Australian government also expressed concern that on Dec. 18, a day after Djokovic learned that he had tested positive, he hosted journalists at his tennis center in Belgrade for an interview and photo shoot, without informing them. Those revelations led to the second visa revocation on Friday.\", \"Some skeptics wondered if Djokovic\\u2019s positive test might have been faked to help him earn the exemption. On Friday, Zoran Gojkovic, a member of Serbia\\u2019s coronavirus crisis team, said the player\\u2019s positive test result was valid. He added that Djokovic had not violated any Serbian laws, especially since the state of emergency was lifted last month.\", \"Djokovic is in a distinct minority among fellow players on the ATP Tour. More than 90 percent have been vaccinated, the men\\u2019s sport\\u2019s leading organization reports, and most enjoy far greater ease of movement.\", \"In 2022, the tour does not require vaccinated players to take more than an initial test after they arrive at a tournament, unless they develop symptoms. Unvaccinated players and team members will have to be tested regularly.\", \"The draw for the Australian Open has already been completed, with Djokovic the top seed and scheduled to play Miomir Kekmanovic in the first round. If Djokovic is forced to withdraw after the schedule of play comes out on Sunday, he will be replaced by a so-called lucky loser \\u2014 a player who lost in the qualifying rounds.\", \"\\u201cAustralian Open is much more important than any player,\\u201d Rafael Nadal, who has also won 20 Grand Slam titles, said on Saturday. \\u201cIf he\\u2019s playing finally, OK. If he\\u2019s not playing, Australian Open will be a great Australian Open with or without him.\\u201d\", \"But Martina Navratilova, the Hall of Fame player and analyst, told the Sunrise television program in Australia that Djokovic should withdraw on his own to end the drama. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just the right thing to do,\\u201d she said, \\u201cbut I don\\u2019t think he will do that because he wants that 21st title.\\u201d\", \"Many players felt fatigue over the saga, lamenting the distraction from the actual sport. But Alex de Minaur, an Australian player ranked No. 34, expressed compassion for a nation grappling with the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cLook, Australians have gone through a lot,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no secret about that. They\\u2019ve had it very tough. They\\u2019ve done a lot of work to protect themselves and their borders.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cIf you wanted to come into the country, you had to be double vaccinated. It was up to him, his choices, his judgment.\\u201d\", \"In Serbia, President Aleksandar Vucic accused Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who has been criticized for his handling of the pandemic ahead of elections, of unfairly targeting Djokovic, who is a national hero. The president said Australia\\u2019s government had not only disrespected Djokovic, but all of Serbia, too.\", \"\\u201cIf you wanted to ban Novak Djokovic from winning the 10th trophy in Melbourne, why didn\\u2019t you return him immediately? Why didn\\u2019t you tell him, \\u2018It is impossible to obtain a visa?\\u2019\\u201d Vucic said, adding, \\u201cWhy are you mistreating him? Why are you taking it out not only on him but also on his family and the whole nation?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f9f5509476fd11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f9f5509476fd11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
