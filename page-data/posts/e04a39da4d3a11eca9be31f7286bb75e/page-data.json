The movie, at points, recalls the first few \\u201cHarry Potter\\u201d films \\u2014 and not just because Maggie Smith, Jim Broadbent and Toby Jones play charming eccentrics.\", \"Framed by the brusque Aunt Ruth (Smith) telling her grand niece and nephews a story on Christmas Eve, the movie follows Nikolas (Henry Lawfull), a poor but altruistic boy in medieval Finland, who journeys northward to find a mythic city called Elfhelm. Friendly allies accumulate along the way \\u2014 including the wisecracking mouse Miika (voiced by Stephen Merchant), a chipper pixie (Zoe Margaret Colletti) and an ebullient elf (Jones) \\u2014 while snide villainesses (Sally Hawkins and Kristen Wiig) test the limits of Nikolas\\u2019s giving spirit.\", \"At points, the prodigious cast of characters and their quips feel eye-rollingly familiar. (When a partying elf declares, \\u201cthis is the resistance,\\u201d Miika snorts, \\u201cto what, sanity?\\u201d) But any weak spots are overshadowed by the movie\\u2019s joys \\u2014 particularly its handsome imagery. As Nikolas\\u2019s father describes Elfhelm, his tale comes alive in enchanting shadow silhouettes around their cabin. Similarly, whenever the movie pivots between Nikolas\\u2019s snowy terrain and Aunt Ruth\\u2019s cozy bedroom setting, the director, Gil Kenan, does not cut; he effects a seamless camera pan.\", \"It\\u2019s an elegant visual decision, highlighting how the best stories \\u2014 for children and adults alike \\u2014 are experienced as real, tangible. Whether or not you believe in magic, \\u201cA Boy Called Christmas\\u201d may be the rare Netflix fare that kindles the holiday spirit.\"]","href_hash":"e04a39da4d3a11eca9be31f7286bb75e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e04a39da4d3a11eca9be31f7286bb75e"}},
