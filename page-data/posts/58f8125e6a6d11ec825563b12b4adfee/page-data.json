The Associated Press contributed to this gallery.\", \"Nevada Democrat Harry Reid (December 2, 1939-December 28, 2021), a lion of the Senate, was known as one of the toughest dealmakers in Congress for more than three decades. A former amateur boxer, he brought a willingness to draw partisan blood, and famously espoused: \\\"I would rather dance than fight, but I know how to fight.\\\"\", \"Born in meager circumstances in Searchlight, Nevada \\u2013 a town he once said had 13 brothels and not much else \\u2013 Reid lost his alcoholic father to suicide. His mother was a laundress at a bordello. He would put himself through law school at George Washington University in D.C., working nights as a Capitol Police officer.\", \"By 28 Reid was elected to the Nevada Assembly, and at 30 became the youngest lieutenant governor in the state's history. As the former head of the Nevada Gaming Commission, and a participant in sting operations against organized crime, Reid was once targeted with a crude bomb planted in his car. \", \"First elected to the House in 1982, Reid won his first Senate race in 1986, and four more after that, becoming Senate Majority Leader in 2007. During his career, he played a key role in landmark Democratic legislation, from the economic stimulus package after the Great Recession, to President Barack Obama's signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act, in 2010. \", \"He pushed to move Nevada's presidential caucuses to February, at the start of the nominating season, boosting the state's importance. He steered hundreds of millions of dollars to the state, but was also instrumental in blocking construction of a controversial nuclear waste storage facility at Yucca Mountain outside Las Vegas. A champion of suicide prevention, he defended social programs, but also voted against most gun control bills, and proposed ending legal prostitution in his home state. \", \"Reid was also known for his abrupt style, typified by his habit of unceremoniously hanging up the phone without saying goodbye. \\\"Even when I was president, he would hang up on me,\\\" Mr. Obama said in 2019.\"]","href_hash":"58f8125e6a6d11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"58f8125e6a6d11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
