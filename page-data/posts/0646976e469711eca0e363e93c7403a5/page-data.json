Criminal actors will typically look to disrupt critical services and publish stolen material to the internet and to media outlets in an attempt to apply further pressure on a victim to expedite their extortion demands.\\\"\", \"The proportion of state-linked malicious cyber activity was down slightly from last year's 30 percent but that was because of the greater proportion of criminal incidents recorded.\", \"\\\"State-sponsored activity is less likely to disrupt services and, indeed, sophisticated actors will go to great lengths to hide their activity from detection, while attempting to extract valuable data that may help in gaining a geostrategic or political advantage,\\\" Fong said.\", \"\\\"It is becoming increasingly difficult to distinguish between state and criminal actors, particularly in cases where we are able to intervene early, but also because the line between state and criminal is becoming increasingly indistinct. State actors sometimes work alongside or provide havens for criminal groups, and we are increasingly seeing criminal groups now using capabilities once only used by sophisticated state actors.\\\"\", \"In the 2020/21 year, 26 percent of incidents had insufficient information to assess anything about the actor responsible or their motivation. The remainder of recorded incidents was made up of proactive work by the centre or events such as a data leak where the centre was unable to investigate any further.\", \"The centre estimated it prevented $119 million of harm to New Zealand organisations this year.\", \"Since June 2015, when the centre first started operating its prevention capabilities, it had prevented about $284m of malicious activity.\"]","href_hash":"0646976e469711eca0e363e93c7403a5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0646976e469711eca0e363e93c7403a5"}},
