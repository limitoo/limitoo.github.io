But it turned out he was just asking the director whether he was going to film in black and white. Mr. Washington believes that if you look at everything through the lens of a political agenda, you lose the plot as an artist.\", \"The director and his stars wanted to make a \\u201cMacbeth\\u201d that was universal, not topical.\", \"Ms. McDormand told me that she was not interested in modern interpretations of Macbeth as an emblem of toxic masculinity, or in correcting the stereotype of Lady Macbeth as a harridan.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s banal\\u201d to make Shakespeare politically correct, she sniffed. \\u201cIt\\u2019s bigger than that.\\u201d\", \"But the casting still makes a difference. A fan approached Mr. Hawkins to tell him how amazing it was to see two Black actors, representing good and evil \\u2014 Macduff and Macbeth \\u2014 in the final, searing sword battle on a bridge.\", \"Mr. Coen goes for abstraction and chiaroscuro in the movie. Besides removing color, all the costumes and sets are stripped of ornamentation. The gray gloaming and hallucinatory mists envelop a spare and savage landscape, with the witches shape shifting into three black birds.\", \"The disorienting first scene features the whispery, scratchy voice of the staggering British actress Kathryn Hunter, who plays one witch divided into three; she sounds like she\\u2019s gurgling blood.\", \"It\\u2019s Mr. Coen\\u2019s first cinematic adventure since his brother traded the silver screen for the stage \\u2014 \\u201cOf course, I missed him,\\u201d Joel told me \\u2014 and he doesn\\u2019t want us to know if we\\u2019re in Macbeth\\u2019s wild mind or on the wild moors.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s the essence of Joel, I have to say,\\u201d Ms. McDormand said.\", \"The director was careful about fiddling with the verse, noting, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want to sing the song without the melody.\\u201d\", \"In keeping with the vision of a \\u201cpostmenopausal\\u201d Macbeth, they did change a line Macbeth speaks to his wife: \\u201cBring forth men-children only/For thy undaunted mettle should compose/Nothing but male.\\u201d \\u201cShould compose\\u201d has become \\u201cshould have composed.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re a couple at the end of their ambition, not at the beginning of their ambition,\\u201d Ms. McDormand said. \\u201cIn our interpretation, she starts realizing that she\\u2019s become expendable and that\\u2019s what drives her insane, not the fact that they kill Duncan and there\\u2019s blood on her hands. She\\u2019s given up her soul to the dark forces, and he\\u2019s not confiding in her anymore. He\\u2019s not asking for her help.\\u201d\", \"The actress said that, for her and \\u201cD,\\u201d their long marriages provided insight: \\u201cDenzel and Pauletta have been married as long as Joel and I have.

Fear is contaminated faith.\\u201d\", \"Unlike some other top movie stars, Mr. Washington is just as comfortable playing villains, antiheroes and deeply flawed men as he is portraying heroes. If there was ever any pressure on him, as there was on leading Black actors like Sidney Poitier back in the day, to choose saintly, role-model parts rather than demonic, criminal parts, he ignored it.\", \"\\u201cWhat he decides he will do, he will do,\\u201d said Brian Grazer, who produced Mr. Washington\\u2019s hits \\u201cAmerican Gangster\\u201d and \\u201cInside Man.\\u201d \\u201cWhat he decides he won\\u2019t do, he won\\u2019t do.\\u201d\", \"The actor is nonpareil at playing lethal and unpredictable. His eyes can go dead and scary, full of razor blades, even as he offers that magnetic smile. In life, as in art, Mr. Grazer said, you know that this is not a guy you want to mess with.\", \"Mr. Washington was chilling as the bodyguard out for revenge in the 2004 film \\u201cMan on Fire,\\u201d and as the sociopathic L.A.P.D. narcotics cop Alonzo Harris in the 2001 thriller \\u201cTraining Day,\\u201d for which he won an Oscar.\", \"\\u201c\\u2018Training Day,\\u2019 I ad-libbed, like, 50 percent of what you hear,\\u201d Mr. Washington said. The director, Antoine Fuqua, used real Los Angeles gang members named Bone, Killer and Hitman as extras. \\u201cWe had a lot of real folks that had done real things, so I used those people. I learned from those people.\\u201d\", \"Ethan Hawke, who was taken on a terrifying ride as Jake Hoyt, Mr. Washington\\u2019s tyro partner in that film, recalled the actor\\u2019s threat of violence.\", \"\\u201cIt was like playing music with Miles Davis or baseball with Babe Ruth,\\u201d said Mr. Hawke, who was nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actor for his role. \\u201cDenzel changed my life. To be 30 and get to work with one of the greats of all time? I\\u2019ve never seen anybody be a flat-out better storyteller. He knows what the audience is thinking. He knows how to surprise them. His imagination is so thorough.\", \"\\u201cThe greats can play offense and defense, and most people can\\u2019t. Jack Nicholson, Gene Hackman and Denzel manage to be equally compelling as protagonist and antagonist.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Washington\\u2019s other co-stars are equally effusive.\", \"Meryl Streep talked to me about his \\u201cmesmeric power over an audience\\u201d onstage. Tom Hanks said, about their dazzling duet in \\u201cPhiladelphia\\u201d: \\u201cI sat beside him for three weeks shooting the trial. I had no dialogue. It was a thriller of an acting class. He follows no rules but pursues the moment. No nonsense, but a looseness that can\\u2019t be faked. A one-on-one scene with him is a game of hardball catch \\u2014 he is both daring you to keep up and propelling you to do more.\", \"\\u201cHe is our Brando. Nicholson. Olivier. And, like me, he steals office supplies and notebooks from the set dressing.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Hanks recalled that, at one point on the set, \\u201cWe were talking about our New York City days as broke actors \\u2014 about the same age, peers, trying to learn craft and get work. I noted that we were in the same boat at the same time. \\u2018Yeah,\\u2019 he said. \\u2018But you could catch a cab in Manhattan.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Those who know Mr. Washington say he can be guarded; he can be suspicious of putting himself in others\\u2019 hands, or of being taken out of context because he doesn\\u2019t want to play into someone else\\u2019s narrative. He keeps it low key, driving himself places without a posse. He isn\\u2019t a regular on the Hollywood party scene.\", \"Actors who work with him are never sure where they stand. He can be charming or elusive, but not buddy-buddy.\", \"\\u201cI did not try to be his friend, hang out at a Lakers game or go to birthday parties,\\u201d Mr. Hawke said. \\u201cI just wanted to offer him my best.\\u201d\", \"Melissa Leo has worked with him in three movies \\u2014 \\u201cFlight\\u201d and two of the \\u201cEqualizer\\u201d ones \\u2014 and still calls him \\u201cMr. Washington.\\u201d\", \"Ms. McDormand agreed: \\u201cHe\\u2019s actually a really lovely human being but he does really need to protect his process. He has a very trusted team of people that he\\u2019s worked with for years, that was his pod.\\u201d\", \"When Liev Schreiber starred with Mr. Washington in \\u201cThe Hurricane,\\u201d he said he expected a friendly Denzel and got a prickly Hurricane instead.\", \"\\u201cI thought he really hated me,\\u201d Mr. Schreiber said.

But, he added, Mr. Washington plumbs such dangerous and painful depths as an actor, that small talk could be distracting. \\u201cI never worked with an actor who seemed to care more.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Grazer said that Mr. Washington told him that he wouldn\\u2019t play Frank Lucas in \\u201cAmerican Gangster\\u201d unless the Harlem murderer and drug trafficker was shown paying for his crimes in the end.\", \"Bruno Delbonnel, the brilliant French cinematographer for \\u201cThe Tragedy of Macbeth,\\u201d said that he is accustomed to being the first on set at 5 a.m., so he was surprised to see Mr. Washington beating him there.\", \"\\u201cDenzel was there, always,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was a competition between him and me. He tried to beat me, because he was rehearsing alone for an hour or so on set with no light.

Spike Lee made his displeasure clear when Mr. Washington lost the Oscar in 1993 for his stunning performance in \\u201cMalcolm X\\u201d to Al Pacino for \\u201cScent of a Woman,\\u201d but Mr. Washington said graciously that if he had won, \\u201cI would have felt badly. It was Pacino\\u2019s time.\\u201d\", \"When he accepted the American Film Institute Life Achievement Award in 2019, it was clear that he was getting more publicly spiritual.
