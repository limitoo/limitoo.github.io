He then gave the flag a salute before he left.\", \"Homeowner, Karla Cruz, reportedly watched the incident that was captured on her security camera and felt pleased by the FedEx driver's actions.\", \"\\\"I was like, 'Oh, he's gonna fix the flag, that's a really kind act,'\\\" Cruz said, according to WJZY. \\\"And then he salutes it, and my heart melts. I thought, maybe he's a veteran.\\\"\", \"The homeowner said that she now wants to find the FedEx driver to acknowledge his action.\", \"According to the news outlet, Cruz takes great pride in honoring the flag as it symbolizes her family's journey from Mexico.\", \"\\\"We came here and we adore Mexico. But we adore this country and the opportunities it brought our family. America brought us the American Dream,\\\" she said. \\\"We got a house here. It's been amazing. The fact that he [the FedEx driver] came and put our flag up is great.\\\"\", \"The American flag has been honored by citizens in various ways over the past few months including in dire situations. During the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in August, a U.S. embassy staffer saved the flag from being burned as staff members were being evacuated.\", \"Embassy staffers were told to destroy any materials that the Taliban could use as propaganda. Those materials included all American flags, papers, electronics, and sensitive items with embassy or agency logos.\", \"The American flag, however, was \\\"meaningful\\\" to the staffer and he wanted to keep it, according to J.P. Lawrence, a reporter at Stars and Stripes.\", \"Many Americans honor the U.S. flag year-round during numerous occasions including Veterans Day and Memorial Day. Similar instances include Flag Day, which is observed across the U.S. every year on June 14, as a day to commemorate the adoption of the American flag, but it is celebrated as a state holiday only in Pennsylvania.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936352/fedex-driver-hangs-fallen-american-flag.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A FedEx driver in North Carolina was reportedly captured on a home security camera hanging up an American flag and giving it a salute.
