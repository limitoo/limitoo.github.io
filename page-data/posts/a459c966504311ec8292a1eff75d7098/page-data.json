So that's the answer, is more lockdowns, more lockdowns, more fear and therefore he doesn't have to do his job of fixing the supply chain because we'll just keep this whole thing going.\\\"\", \"\\\"Always a new variant,\\\" Cain said.\", \"Hegseth then claimed that a new variant would emerge every couple of years, implying they would be timed to coincide with election years. \\\"You can count on a variant about every October, every two years,\\\" he said.\", \"Cain told Hegseth: \\\"Yep, you're probably right. However, they could speed up. The variants could come more quickly.\\\"\", \"Hegseth then mimicked a person on a phone call, saying: \\\"We're gonna need a new variant here.\\\"\", \"Some on social media condemned the conspiracy theory, while others pushed the idea that Democrats were using variants to gain an advantage in elections.\", \"\\\"Here comes the MEV - the Midterm Election Variant!\\\" Texas Rep. Ronny Jackson tweeted. \\\"They NEED a reason to push unsolicited nationwide mail-in ballots. Democrats will do anything to CHEAT during an election - but we're not going to let them!\\\"\", \"But Mike Sington said Fox had created a \\\"conspiracy theory out of thin air that the Democrats are making up new COVID variants.\\\" He added: \\\"Of course they offer no evidence.\\\"\", \"Actor George Takei urged people to be wary of misinformation and to take steps to protect themselves from the virus.\", \"\\\"If you are scared of the new Omicron variant, get your booster right away and stay masked up indoors while in public places,\\\" Takei tweeted. \\\"If you think Omicron is a Democratic hoax, then I don't know what to say other than to try turning off Fox News and OANN.\\\"\", \"Political commentator Brian Taylor Cohen added: \\\"Notice how the same people attacking Biden and saying there will \\\"aLwAyS Be AnOtHeR VaRiAnT\\\" are the same ones pushing vaccine skepticism that creates an opening for these variants in the first place.
