It has led to canceled bus trips in Los Angeles and the Seattle area and caused unplanned gaps in transit service in Chicago that have drawn complaints from train and bus riders.\", \"In San Francisco, where a vaccine mandate for all city employees created a shortage of transit workers, a handful of bus routes were temporarily suspended, and riders were warned that they could see more crowding and longer wait times on other bus routes.\", \"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs New York\\u2019s subway and buses and is the nation\\u2019s largest transit agency, has accelerated hiring, but still has vacancies for more than 600 train operators, train conductors and bus drivers. Currently, the M.T. A. employs 3,195 train operators, 2,946 conductors and 11,850 bus drivers.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a big problem,\\u201d said Lisa Daglian, the executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A., a watchdog group. \\u201cIn order for there to be sufficient service, there needs to be sufficient crews.\\u201d\", \"So the M.T.A. recently sent nearly 800 letters to train operators and conductors who had retired within the past three years, asking them to come back to work for up to $35,000 for three months. So far, 20 retirees have taken up the offer.\", \"Many transit agencies reduced staff or froze hiring in the early days of the pandemic as people stayed home and their ridership and revenue plummeted. Now, many are eager to fill their ranks and return to full service.\", \"Amtrak, which did not hire workers for more than 16 months after slashing train service nationwide, saw a 10 percent drop in the number of train engineers and conductors from attrition and is in the process of hiring 200 people to fill openings, said a spokesman, Jason Abrams.\", \"King County Metro, which serves the Seattle area, has hired back 200 part-time bus drivers who were laid off last year because of budget cuts. The agency, which has canceled trips in recent weeks because of a driver shortage, is also hiring \\u201cfor the foreseeable future as public transportation in the Puget Sound region continues to grow in 2022 and beyond,\\u201d said Sean Hawks, a spokesman.\", \"In New York, the M.T.A. lifted a hiring freeze for certain workers in February after federal pandemic relief stabilized the agency\\u2019s finances and has made tackling crew shortages a priority. Still, the staffing shortages continue to cause thousands of subway and bus trips to be canceled every month, frustrating riders and hobbling the agency\\u2019s efforts to lure back the ridership it needs to address its financial woes.\", \"\\u201cWe have a specific problem with these crew-related delays, and we are attacking that aggressively because we don\\u2019t want to lose ground,\\u201d said Janno Lieber, the M.T.A.\\u2019s acting chairman and chief executive officer.\", \"But hiring transit workers is not easy when there is a national labor shortage.\", \"\\u201cLots of industries are having trouble recruiting workers,\\u201d said Ruth Milkman, a sociology professor at the City University of New York, adding that many people are not looking for jobs because they may have saved money during the pandemic or have to care for children or relatives.\", \"Though transit jobs have traditionally been good jobs that are secure even in economic downturns, the pandemic highlighted the risks of working on a train or bus when other people work safely from home. At least 173 M.T.A. workers have died from Covid, according to the agency.\", \"\\u201cIf you have a choice \\u2014 and you do have choices right now because so many employers are having trouble finding people \\u2014 you might want to pick something safer and less physically strenuous,\\u201d Prof. Milkman said.\", \"Many transit jobs also require special licenses or test-based certifications that require experience, which can further limit the pool of qualified applicants, said Nicole Smith, a research professor and chief economist for Georgetown University\\u2019s Center on Education and the Workforce. \\u201cI think people are interested in these jobs, but they don\\u2019t have the skills to get started right away,\\u201d she said.\", \"Even when transit agencies find qualified workers, she added, it can take months to train them and even longer to replace all the experience and institutional knowledge lost when veteran workers retire. \\u201cAs much as everyone wants to get this done in weeks or a couple of months, it\\u2019s going to take a couple of years,\\u201d she said.\", \"Many transit agencies have stepped up their recruiting and hiring efforts, including the Chicago Transit Authority, which has been hosting virtual and in-person job fairs. Some agencies have resorted to bonuses and incentives that are usually only offered to the most sought-after job candidates.\", \"New Jersey Transit bus drivers, who start at $22.20 per hour, are required to have a commercial driver\\u2019s license. But with increased competition, the agency is offering bonuses of $6,000 to those with commercial driver\\u2019s licenses and $3,000 to those with a permit for one. The agency is also increasing marketing and outreach efforts, including to military veterans, said Jim Smith, an agency spokesman.\", \"The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, which serves the Houston area, has also offered generous incentives for new bus drivers, light rail operators and mechanics and is working to increase starting salaries. \\u201cWe\\u2019re definitely getting more applicants because of it,\\u201d said Tracy Jackson, an agency spokeswoman.\", \"Still, Mr. Costa, the union leader, said hiring bonuses might bring more workers in the door, but it would not necessarily keep them in their jobs. \\u201cThese bonuses are a knee-jerk reaction,\\u201d Mr. Costa said, adding that agencies needed to make long-term changes, including increasing pay and benefits and creating safer working conditions to ensure a stable work force.\", \"In New York, the M.T.A. has added more instructors and training sites to get new hires on the job faster, said Craig Cipriano, the acting president of New York City Transit, which is part of the M.T.A. The eight-month training period for train operators has been shortened by about two months, in part by reducing practice time in train yards.\", \"Agency officials hope to have enough bus drivers by the end of the year, but said they will not be fully staffed with train conductors and operators until next year.\", \"Salaries start at $37.97 an hour for train operators, $23.67 an hour for train conductors and $25.49 an hour for bus drivers.\", \"Even with the worker shortage, Mr. Lieber said on-time train performance has steadily improved. There were 14,000 canceled or delayed train trips related to crew shortages in October, down from about 17,000 such trips in August, according to the agency.\", \"The authority has also increased efficiency, including revising crew schedules and paying overtime to make shifts longer so that more trains can run in a shift. \\u201cWe\\u2019re taking this sense of urgency that the pandemic created as a broader motivator for problem solving and innovation,\\u201d Mr. Lieber said.\", \"Mr. Milligan, who commutes from Beacon, N.Y., to his new job as a train conductor, had worked as a sales representative for Verizon and a night auditor for a hotel. He said the benefits of working for the M.T.A. \\u2014 including a pension plan and opportunities to move up \\u2014 outweighed the risk of being exposed to the virus.\", \"\\u201cI got lucky that there was such a need,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s rewarding. It\\u2019s challenging. I\\u2019m looking forward to taking a step up.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9d888a3451c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9d888a3451c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}},
