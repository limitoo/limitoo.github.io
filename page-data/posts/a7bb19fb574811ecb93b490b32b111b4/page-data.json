But America doesn\\u2019t have anything close to a comprehensive family policy. That means no guaranteed paid family leave, no universal child care or preschool and a patchwork system of elder and disability care that leaves millions without support.\", \"American families are drowning as a result. In some states, the average cost of a full-time child-care program is nearing $20,000 a year; the median yearly cost of a private room in a nursing home is over $100,000 \\u2014 a figure that well exceeds the median household income in the United States. And workers in the child care and eldercare industries routinely make poverty wages.\", \"[You can listen to this episode of \\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\\u201d on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]\", \"Ai-jen Poo is a co-founder and the executive director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance, a MacArthur \\u201cgenius\\u201d grant winner and the author of \\u201cThe Age of Dignity: Preparing for the Elder Boom in a Changing America.\\u201d\", \"Fixing America\\u2019s systems of care has been Poo\\u2019s life\\u2019s work. But for her, the current state of America\\u2019s care infrastructure is more than a looming crisis; it\\u2019s a huge opportunity \\u2014 one that, if solved, could supercharge the American economy, ensure dignified care across our life spans and revolutionize the future of work. And Poo\\u2019s movement may be on the brink of a major victory: If signed into law, the Build Back Better Act would be the most transformative investment in children and caregiving in generations.\", \"This conversation is about how caring for the people we love became so atrociously unaffordable and unmanageable \\u2014 and what it would take to change that. It also explores why Poo thinks we should view child care and eldercare as essential infrastructure for running our economy and society, the racialized history of why the United States lags behind most of its peers in developing comprehensive family policy, the cultural narratives that have caused America to undervalue care work for so long, how solving the care crisis would be a policy \\u201cwin-win-win\\u201d for everyone, Poo\\u2019s view that \\u201ccare is a problem the market cannot solve\\u201d and why Poo believes that the future of work is inextricably linked to the future of care.\", \"You can listen to the whole conversation by following \\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\\u201d on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.
