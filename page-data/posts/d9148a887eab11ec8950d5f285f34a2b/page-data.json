Many people who had already seen the movie thanks to China's booming pirate video market quickly noticed some key differences.\", \"The Tencent version is 12 minutes shorter than the original, and it has a very different ending. Somewhat paradoxically, the climatic ending of the U.S. movie, in which two high-rise office buildings symbolizing Western conformism and capitalistic consumer culture are blown up, has been removed. \", \"Instead, a title card appears informing viewers that \\\"the police rapidly figured out the whole plan and arrested all criminals, successfully preventing the bomb from exploding.\\\" \", \"The protagonist, portrayed by Edward Norton \\u2014 and Brad Pitt as his split personality \\u2014 was \\\"sent to lunatic asylum receiving psychological treatment,\\\" according to the Chinese version of events.\", \"The buildings did fail to explode in the novel from which the movie was adapted, too, due to mistakes made by the protagonist as he mixed chemicals for the bomb.

Weeks later, a revised version was released without some of the more violent scenes.\", \"It wasn't clear which government agency might have ordered the changes to \\\"Fight Club,\\\" or whether the importer simply chose to self-censor the release to avoid having to pull it back down. \", \"Either way, many viewers aren't happy about the changes to the hugely popular film. \", \"Users on China's Twitter-like Weibo platform complained that the alternate ending could spark arguments between people who had only seen one version about how the story actually ends.\", \"\\\"I may have believed this ending if I was watching for the first time,\\\" said one person in a post that included a screengrab of the end slate used in the Tencent version.\\u00a0\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"d9148a887eab11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d9148a887eab11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
