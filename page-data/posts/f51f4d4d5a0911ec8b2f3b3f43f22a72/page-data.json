China, Myanmar, North Korea and Bangladesh\\u00a0and added Chinese artificial intelligence company SenseTime Group to an investment blacklist.\", \"Canada and the United Kingdom joined the United States in imposing sanctions related to human rights abuses in Myanmar.\", \"Marking Human Rights Day,\\u00a0Washington also imposed the first new sanctions on North Korea\\u00a0under President Joe Biden's administration and targeted Myanmar military entities, among others.\", \"\\\"Our actions today, particularly those in partnership with the United Kingdom and Canada, send a message that democracies around the world will act against those who abuse the power of the state to inflict suffering and repression,\\\" Deputy Treasury Secretary Wally Adeyemo said in a statement.\", \"The North Korean mission at the United Nations and the Washington embassies of China, Myanmar and Bangladesh did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\", \"The measures are the latest in a raft of sanctions timed to coincide with Mr Biden's two-day virtual Summit for Democracy, where he announced initiatives to bolster democracy around the world and support for pro-democracy legislation in the United States.\", \"Mr Biden said on Friday that commitments made by some of the more than 100 world leaders at the summit would push back against rising autocracy around the world, fight corruption and promote human rights.\", \"The Treasury on Friday added Chinese artificial intelligence company SenseTime to a list of \\\"Chinese military-industrial complex companies\\\", accusing it of having developed facial recognition programs that can determine a target's ethnicity, with a particular focus on identifying ethnic Uyghurs.\", \"As a result, the company will fall under an investment ban\\u00a0for US\\u00a0investors.\", \"SenseTime is close to selling 1.5 billion shares in an initial public offering (IPO).\", \"After news of the Treasury restrictions earlier this week, the company began discussing\\u00a0the fate of the planned $767 million offering with Hong Kong's stock exchange, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.\", \"UN\\u00a0experts and rights groups estimate more than a million people, mainly Uyghurs and members of other Muslim minorities, have been detained in recent years in a vast system of camps in China's far-west region of Xinjiang.\", \"China denies abuses in Xinjiang, but the US\\u00a0government and many rights groups say Beijing is carrying out genocide there.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Sanctions imposed on

the junta's forces have killed more than 1,300 people since the coup in February.(Reuters)</div>\", \"The Treasury said it was imposing sanctions on two Myanmar military entities and an organisation that provides reserves for the military.\", \"The Directorate of Defence Industries, one of the entities targeted, makes weapons for the military and police that have been used in a brutal crackdown on opponents of the military's February\\u00a01 coup.\", \"The Treasury also targeted four regional chief ministers.\", \"Canada imposed sanctions against four entities affiliated with the Myanmar military government, while the United Kingdom imposed fresh sanctions against the military.\", \"Myanmar was plunged into crisis when the military overthrew leader Aung San Suu Kyi and her government on February\\u00a01, triggering daily protests in towns and cities and fighting in borderlands between the military and ethnic minority insurgents.\", \"Junta forces seeking to crush opposition have killed more than 1,300 people, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) monitoring group.\", \"Campaign group Global Witness said in a statement the measures fell short of targeting Myanmar's natural gas industry, a key source of foreign currency for the junta, and were \\\"unlikely to materially impact the military junta's bottom line\\\".\", \"The US also blacklisted North Korea's Central Public Prosecutors Office, along with the former minister of social security and recently assigned Minister of People's Armed Forces Ri Yong Gil, as well as a Russian university for facilitating the export of workers from North Korea.\", \"North Korea has long sought a lifting of punishing US\\u00a0and international sanctions imposed over its weapons programs and has denounced US\\u00a0criticism of its human rights record as evidence of a hostile policy against it.\", \"The US\\u00a0State Department on Friday also barred 12 people from travelling to the United
