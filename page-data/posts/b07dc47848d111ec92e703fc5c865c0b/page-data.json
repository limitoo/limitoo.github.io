Those who are vaccinated must be tested at least once per week, and potentially more if they are symptomatic or have a close contact with someone who tests positive.\", \"With Wednesday\\u2019s update to the protocols, unvaccinated players must wait for their results before entering a team facility, while vaccinated players and staff can enter their facilities, but must remain masked while they wait for results.\", \"In a memo sent to all 32 teams Tuesday night, the league also urged clubs to set up drive-through testing facilities for players, staff and any friends and family who may visit them for the holiday.\", \"The league also reminded its teams of existing prohibitions aimed at reducing potential exposure to the coronavirus. Unvaccinated players are not to gather in groups of more than three people outside of the team facility; visit a nightclub or bar where more than 10 people are present; attend concerts and other events; or attend parties in homes where there are more than 15 people, if they all do not wear masks.\", \"Dr. Allen Sills, the league\\u2019s chief medical officer, said the N.F.L. tightened restrictions because the league saw its highest number of confirmed positive coronavirus tests in the previous two weeks. \\u201cThat wasn\\u2019t a total surprise to us because our numbers mirror the number of cases in the country,\\u201d he said.\", \"Between Oct. 31 and Nov. 13, there were 81 confirmed positive cases in the N.F.L., 34 players and 47 staff, the most in any two-week period this season. The players affected included high-profile starters like Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, Los Angeles Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa, and Cleveland Browns running back Nick Chubb.\", \"In the prior two-week period, there were 35 confirmed positive cases, including 11 players.\", \"In the United States, there were more than 85,000 positive cases per day on average in the 14-day period that ended Tuesday, an 18 percent increase, according to data collected by The New York Times. The number of cases has risen fastest in the Midwest and Northeast, where cooler temperatures are driving people to spend more time indoors.\", \"About 94 percent of all players and nearly all coaches and staff are vaccinated, according to the N.F.L., so most of the league\\u2019s infected personnel have had milder symptoms. Sills said Wednesday there has not been any uncontrolled spread of the virus inside team facilities, and that in some mild cases vaccinated players, coaches and staff have been able to return in fewer than the prescribed 10 days because they tested negative twice in a two-day period.\", \"Jeff Miller, a league spokesman, said the implementation of the tighter protocols was not in reaction to Aaron Rodgers, the Green Bay Packers\\u2019 unvaccinated quarterback, who tested positive for coronavirus two weeks ago and was later fined $14,650 for failing to follow Covid-19 protocols agreed on by the league and the players\\u2019 union.\", \"The Packers were fined $300,000 for failing to monitor whether players adhered to the guidelines.\", \"To enforce the toughened protocols, the league said it would be \\u201cperiodically reviewing footage from surveillance cameras in club facilities\\u201d and penalizing players and clubs \\u201cas warranted.\\u201d Teams must install cameras in their weight rooms and cafeterias and must keep the video from those cameras for 30 days in case the league needs to review it.\"]","href_hash":"b07dc47848d111ec92e703fc5c865c0b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b07dc47848d111ec92e703fc5c865c0b"}},
