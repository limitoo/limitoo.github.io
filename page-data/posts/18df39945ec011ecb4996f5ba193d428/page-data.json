Corporations that already have butts in seats are sending workers home. A number of colleges and universities this week also announced they would revert to virtual learning models, effective immediately.\\u00a0\", \"Even company leaders who were once staunchly opposed to remote work, notably in the banking industry, are rethinking their positions on in-office work. For example James Gorman, the CEO of investment bank Morgan Stanley, this week said he had been \\\"wrong\\\" about pushing for in-office work when he said last June he expected workers back at their desks by Labor Day and threatened to cut pay for no-shows.\", \"\\\"If you can go to a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office.

I thought we would have been out of it past Labor Day and we're not.\\\"\", \"\\\"I think we'll still be in it through most of next year,\\\" Gorman told the news outlet. \\\"Everybody's still finding their way and then you get the Omicron variant; who knows, we'll have Pi, we'll have Theta and Epsilon, and we'll eventually run out letters of the [Greek] alphabet. It's continuing to be an issue.\\\"\", \"Morgan Stanley does not have a firm return-to-work date and remains in a sustained period of transition, a spokesperson told CBS MoneyWatch.\\u00a0\", \"Asset managers Citadel, Blackstone and Millennium Management are also reverting to remote work as of this week, Bloomberg reported.\\u00a0\", \"Tech industry leaders Facebook and Google and ride share company Lyft previously announced extensions of their pandemic-driven remote work phases. Lyft employees now have the option to work remotely for all of 2022.\\u00a0\", \"Apple is also delaying its January return to office, and even giving employees a $1,000 stipend to spruce up their at-home workstations, according to reports.\", \"The announcements come as Covid cases rise across the country, with the Delta variant continuing to surge and the new, even more highly contagious Omicron variant demonstrating some ability to evade vaccines.
