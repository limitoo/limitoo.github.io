And that based on these qualities, any of the candidates being reviewed would be deserving of bipartisan support.\\\"\", \"The senators emphasized an \\\"urgency\\\" to quickly confirm the president's choice, with the goal of maintaining a swift pace similar to the October 2020 confirmation of Justice Amy Coney Barrett, according to the first participant in the meeting.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We're anxious to get started,\\\" Senator Richard Durbin, the Illinois Democrat who serves as the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, told reporters outside the White House after the meeting.\\u00a0\", \"Every Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee except Dianne Feinstein attended the meeting in the Roosevelt Room, according to the participants.\", \"In anticipation of the president's decision, former Alabama Democratic Senator Doug Jones officially started his temporary role as nomination advisor, or \\\"Sherpa\\\" for the Supreme Court nominee earlier this week.
