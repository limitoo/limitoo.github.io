Associated Press reporters at the scene saw police going in and out of the boat on Monday morning. \", \" The seizure was confirmed by two people familiar with the matter. The people couldn't discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. The Reuters news service also quotes a Spanish police source as saying the vessel was seized.\", \"A Spanish Civil Guard spokesman confirmed to the AP that officers from the Spanish police body and from the FBI were at the marina searching the vessel Monday morning and said further details would be released later. \", \" A Civil Guard source told The Associated Press that the immobilized yacht is Tango, a 254-foot vessel that carries Cook Islands flag and that Superyachtfan.com, a specialized website that tracks the world's largest and most exclusive recreational boats, values at $120 million. The source was also not authorized to be named in media reports and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. \", \" The yacht is among the assets linked to Viktor Vekselberg, a billionaire and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin who heads the Moscow-based Renova Group, a conglomerate encompassing metals, mining, tech and other assets, according to U.S. Treasury Department documents. All of Vekselberg's assets in the U.S. are frozen and U.S. companies are forbidden from doing business with him and his entities.\", \" The move is the first time the U.S. government has seized an oligarch's yacht since Attorney General Merrick Garland and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen assembled a task force known as REPO - short for Russian Elites, Proxies and Oligarchs - as an effort to enforce sanctions after Russia invaded Ukraine in late February.\", \" Vekselberg has long had ties to the U.S., including a green card he once held and homes in New York and Connecticut. The Ukrainian-born businessman built his fortune by investing in the aluminum and oil industries in the post-Soviet era. \", \" Vekselberg was also questioned in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and has worked closely with his American cousin, Andrew Intrater, who heads the New York investment management firm Columbus Nova. \", \" Vekselberg and Intrater were thrust into the spotlight in the Mueller probe after the attorney for adult film star Stormy Daniels released a memo that claimed $500,000 in hush money was routed through Columbus Nova to a shell company set up by Donald Trump's personal attorney, Michael Cohen. Columbus Nova denied that Vekselberg played any role in its payments to Cohen.\", \" Vekselberg and Intrater met with Cohen at Trump Tower, one of several meetings between members of Trump's inner circle and high-level Russians during the 2016 campaign and transition.\", \" The 64-year-old mogul founded Renova Group more than three decades ago. The group holds the largest stake in United Co. Rusal, Russia's biggest aluminum producer, among other investments. \", \" Vekselberg was first sanctioned by the U.S. in 2018, and again in March of this year, shortly after the invasion of Ukraine began. Vekselberg has also been sanctioned by authorities in the United Kingdom.\", \" The U.S. Justice Department has also launched a sanctions enforcement task force known as KleptoCapture, which also aims to enforce financial restrictions in the U.S. imposed on Russia and its billionaires, working with the FBI, Treasury and other federal agencies. That task force will also target financial institutions and entities that have helped oligarchs move money to dodge sanctions.\", \" The White House has said that many allied countries, including German, the U.K, France, Italy and others are involved in trying to collect and share information against Russians targeted for sanctions. In his State of the Union address, President Joe Biden warned oligarch that the U.S. and European allies would \\\"find and seize your yachts, your luxury apartments, your private jets.\\\"\", \" \\\"We are coming for your ill-begotten gains,\\\" he said.\", \" Monday's capture wasn't the first time Spanish authorities have been involved in the seizure of a Russian oligarch's superyacht. Officials there said they had seized a vessel valued at over $140 million owned by the CEO of a state-owned defense conglomerate and a close Putin ally.\", \" French authorities have also seized superyachts, including one believed to belong to Igor Sechin, a Putin ally who runs Russian oil giant Rosneft, which has been on the U.S. sanctions list since Russia annexed Crimea in 2014.\", \" Italy has also seized several yachts and other assets.\", \" Italian financial police moved quickly seizing the superyacht \\\"Lena\\\" belonging to Gennady Timchenko, an oligarch close to Putin, in the port of San Remo; the 215-foot \\\"Lady M\\\" owned by Alexei Mordashov in nearby Imperia, featuring six suites and estimated to be worth $71.5 million; as well as villas in Tuscany and Como, according to government officials.\"]","href_hash":"8b1f0e46b40e11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8b1f0e46b40e11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
