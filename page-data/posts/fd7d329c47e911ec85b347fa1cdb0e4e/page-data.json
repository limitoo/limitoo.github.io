But in Parliament on Wednesday, faced with a corruption scandal and bad news on other fronts, his Houdini-like skills deserted him.\", \"Mr. Johnson spluttered as the leader of the Labour Party, Keir Starmer, demanded he apologize for his role in the furor over Conservative Party lawmakers taking lucrative outside work. It was part of a pattern of reversals and broken promises, the Labour leader said, that included the government\\u2019s likely retreat on a high-speed rail link between northern cities.\", \"\\u201cEverybody else has apologized for him, but he won\\u2019t apologize for himself,\\u201d Mr. Starmer thundered. \\u201cA coward, not a leader.\\u201d\", \"It has been a brutal stretch for a prime minister who only two weeks ago was hosting world leaders at a climate conference in Glasgow. \", \"Now, Mr. Johnson faces a low-grade mutiny from his party over the second-jobs scandal, which has sent London tabloids into a feeding frenzy over the perceived \\u201csleaze\\u201d factor in government. He risks letting down his party\\u2019s newfound base in England\\u2019s industrial heartland by weakening plans for the rail connections. And he could ignite a trade war with the European Union if he rips up post-Brexit rules governing Northern Ireland.\", \"While Mr. Johnson\\u2019s 80-strong majority in Parliament has so far made him bulletproof, even amid the pandemic\\u2019s misery and Brexit\\u2019s turmoil, analysts said he was entering the most perilous phase of his tenure yet.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s a weaker figure today than probably he has ever been at any point since entering No. 10, if you look at the polls and you look at how quickly some of his base is fracturing,\\u201d said Matthew Goodwin, a professor of politics at the University of Kent. The Conservative Party\\u2019s \\u201cinternal Civil War was real,\\u201d he added.\", \"Mr. Johnson\\u2019s plight was evident in Parliament. When he tried to regain his footing by lobbing questions about corruption back at Mr. Starmer, a lawyer who once earned extra money advising clients, the speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, rebuked Mr. Johnson for not playing by the rules of the weekly \\u201cPrime Minister\\u2019s Questions\\u201d session. Conservative backbenchers were left to grumble restively.\", \"Two weeks ago, Mr. Johnson instructed them to vote in favor of a botched attempt to save a Conservative colleague, Owen Paterson, who broke lobbying rules and was threatened with suspension from Parliament. An outcry forced Mr. Johnson to back track and his reversal was complete this week \\u2014 in humiliating fashion \\u2014 when he proposed banning lawmakers from being paid as consultants on parliamentary business.\", \"That angered those who now face the loss of a lucrative sideline, while the debacle has rattled other Conservative lawmakers who fret about being punished by voters over the ethics scandal that has engulfed their party. \", \"Many were elected for the first time in 2019 in districts in the north of England that once solidly supported the Labour Party \\u2014 gritty towns and cities where a lawmaker\\u2019s annual salary of around \\u00a380,000, or $107,000, is seen as generous.\", \"More disappointment is likely to come on Thursday when the government is expected to water down its promises to spend tens of billions of pounds on new train networks to connect cities in the north. Critics cite this as an example of the fuzziness behind the government\\u2019s marquee policy of \\u201cleveling up\\u201d \\u2014 spreading economic prosperity to the middle and north of England.\", \"John Curtice, a leading public-opinion pollster who is a professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow, said Mr. Johnson\\u2019s handling of the lobbying debacle had \\u201cmanaged to annoy more or less everyone and raised doubts about the quality of his leadership and his judgment.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Johnson is also taking a mild hit in opinion polls in which he has typically come out ahead. After trailing the Conservative Party for months in the polls, Labour has grabbed a one-point advantage for the first time since January. But Mr. Curtice characterized it as a \\u201cdent, not a tsunami\\u201d and, by historic standards, not a significant lead. For Mr. Johnson to face a genuine threat to his leadership from within the Tory ranks, analysts said, the party\\u2019s poll numbers would have to collapse.\", \"Still, there are worrying signs beneath those numbers. Mr. Johnson is losing support among people who voted for Brexit. As many as a quarter of those who voted for the Conservatives in 2019 now say they don\\u2019t know which party to vote for, Mr. Goodwin, of the University of Kent, said.\", \"Among their grievances: Mr. Johnson\\u2019s broken promise not to raise taxes, worries about high public spending and the failure to stop an influx of migrants crossing the English Channel from France in small boats.\", \"\\u201cThat is reflecting a broader concern over the direction of Johnson\\u2019s premiership,\\u201d Mr. Goodwin said. \\u201cHe\\u2019s basically alienating the right-wing flank of his party.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Johnson will likely weather the corruption scandal. The problem, Mr. Goodwin said, is that \\u201cthere are bigger and darker clouds on the horizon\\u201d with a variety of problems looming.\", \"Among them, Britain has been in a tense negotiation with the European Union over the trade arrangements that govern Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom but shares a border with Ireland, a member of the European single market. Mr. Johnson is expected to decide in a few weeks whether to rip up those rules, a move that could quickly escalate into a trade war with the European Union.\", \"Negotiators for both sides are trying to devise solutions. Mr. Johnson\\u2019s negotiator, David Frost, said on Wednesday that the government\\u2019s preference was still to make a deal with the European Union before Christmas.\", \"But Mr. Johnson left open the prospect of a confrontation. The European Union, he said in Parliament, used a provision in the trade deal last January to restrict shipments of coronavirus vaccines from Continental Europe to Northern Ireland. For Britain to do the same thing, he said, would be \\u201cperfectly legal.\\u201d In fact the European Union reversed course within a matter of hours and did not pursue its threat.\", \"The European Union has warned it would retaliate by imposing extra checks on trucks carrying goods to and from Britain \\u2014 a move that could cause chaos in the busy days before Christmas. A clash over Northern Ireland would also antagonize the Biden administration, which worries about the corrosive effect it might have on the 1998 Good Friday Agreement that ended decades of sectarian violence there.\", \"Rather than risk all that, many analysts expect Mr. Johnson to back down. But some predicted he would do so only after a show of brinkmanship, since a clash with Brussels could unify an otherwise querulous Conservative Party.\", \"\\u201cHe might actually like a nice period of war with Europe because it will appeal to his backbenchers,\\u201d said Jonathan Powell, who served as chief of staff to a former prime minister, Tony Blair. \\u201cBut he\\u2019s still going to have to back down, which will cause more political instability in Northern Ireland.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"fd7d329c47e911ec85b347fa1cdb0e4e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fd7d329c47e911ec85b347fa1cdb0e4e"}},
