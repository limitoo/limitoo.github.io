This was predictable. This was predicted,\\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a news conference yesterday. \\u201cWe should assume that it\\u2019s in other states as well.\\u201d\", \"Omicron, a highly mutated version of the coronavirus that was first identified in South Africa, has been detected in more than 25 countries. But that still raises the question: If Omicron is spreading far and wide, why was the first U.S. case discovered in San Francisco?\", \"As with most things, there\\u2019s an element of randomness here. If we think back to the spring of 2020, an early coronavirus outbreak at a Seattle nursing home signaled terrible luck \\u2014 not that the city was the most infected in the nation.\", \"It\\u2019s most likely a similar situation in San Francisco. The city is one of the most vaccinated places in the country \\u2014 with 77 percent of residents fully immunized against Covid-19 \\u2014 so it\\u2019s not particularly susceptible to coronavirus outbreaks.\", \"But its popularity with global travelers does make it vulnerable to contagion imported from elsewhere.\", \"On Tuesday, before the Bay Area case was identified, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, announced expanded Omicron screening at San Francisco International Airport, calling it one \\u201cof the busiest international airports in the country.\\u201d\", \"Indeed, the San Franciscan infected with Omicron had returned from a trip to South Africa on Nov. 22. The patient\\u2019s symptoms began three days later.\", \"That set off a rapid chain of events. The infected person, who is between the ages of 18 and 49, was tested on Sunday and got a positive result on Monday. In less than 24 hours, scientists at the University of California, San Francisco, had determined that it was Omicron.\", \"Newsom chalked up the diagnosis to California having \\u201cthe most robust testing program and protocols in the nation\\u201d as well as strong collaborations with major academic centers such as U.C.S.F.\", \"Compared with the nation overall, California does perform genetic sequencing on a higher percentage of coronavirus samples \\u2014 roughly one in five. (Since August, those tests have shown that at least 98 percent of Californians with Covid-19 have been infected with the Delta variant.)\", \"Dr. Mark Ghaly, the state\\u2019s secretary of health and human services, said that the San Francisco patient was self-isolating and had mild symptoms that were improving, and that no close contacts had tested positive \\u2014 what he called \\u201ca testimony to the importance of vaccinations.\\u201d The patient had received two doses of the Moderna vaccine but no booster.\", \"Though scientists must still determine how well the shots will ultimately protect against Omicron, many experts expect they will ward off severe illness and death, if not infections altogether. Answers about whether Omicron is more contagious or deadly remain elusive.\", \"In light of Omicron\\u2019s arrival in the United States, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the president\\u2019s top medical adviser, said that Americans should not wait for pharmaceutical companies to develop a booster shot designed for the new variant and that the available doses would provide extra protection.\", \"\\u201cGet boosted now,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe may not need a variant-specific boost.\\u201d\", \"For more:\", \"Prosecutors are reopening old cases against police officers.\", \"Pasta with caramelized peppers, anchovies and ricotta.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from Barry Naiditch:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
