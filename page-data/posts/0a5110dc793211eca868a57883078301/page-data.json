Circuit Court of Appeals late Tuesday night.\\u00a0\", \"According to the letter and other filings, the handout includes just four pages of documents from the Office of Records Management, records the former president has attempted to shield from the committee.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"As this Court observed, the former President asserted executive privilege over six pages of documents from the fourth tranche and President Biden declined to uphold that assertion,\\\" the filing to the court read. \\\"Because two of the six pages are similar to pages that are contained in the first three tranches and subject to this Court's administrative injunction, the Archivist intends to produce only the remaining four pages.\\\"\", \"The Appeals Court panel to which the letter was addressed already ruled that three initial tranches of documents could be handed over to the House committee, finding that a former president does not have the right to exert executive privilege if a current president disagrees. \\u00a0\", \"However, to give Trump's team time to bring the question before the Supreme Court, the judges\\u00a0 paused the enforcement of their ruling by issuing an administrative injunction.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"This Court specifically stated in its December 9, 2021 decision,\\\" Tuesday night's filing explains, \\\"that its administrative injunction encompassed only records from the first three tranches, which were the only tranches at issue in the appeal.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"The Archives, represented by Justice Department lawyers, noted in its filing that President Biden refused to exert executive privilege of the documents, but ordered the document transfer to be delayed 30 days longer than stipulated to give his predecessor time to ask a court to stop it.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Despite that opportunity, the former President did not move for a preliminary injunction in district court with respect to records from the fourth tranche or even amend his complaint to seek relief with respect to any such records.

These include daily presidential diaries, the files of then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, multiple binders belonging to then-White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany and White House talking points alleging voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election.
