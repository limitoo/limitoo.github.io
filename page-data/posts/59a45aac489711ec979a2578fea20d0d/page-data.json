They declined to elaborate or say if Ford might invest in a new semiconductor factory with GlobalFoundries. The current memorandum of understanding does not call for a cross-shareholding between the companies.\", \"Thomas Caulfield, GlobalFoundries\\u2019 chief executive, said the agreement would foster innovation and \\u201censure long-term supply-demand balance.\\u201d\", \"Ford and other automakers have had to idle vehicle plants intermittently this year because they have been unable to get enough computer chips \\u2014 the brains needed to control engines, transmissions, brakes, infotainment systems and more.\", \"General Motors is also having discussions with chip companies about ways to secure enough chips to keep its factories running. \\u201cWe are specifically working on a strategy to make sure that we are not seeing these types of constraints in the medium term and certainly in the long term,,\\u201dG.M.\\u2019s chief executive, Mary T. Barra, said on a conference call last month.\", \"The auto industry\\u2019s chip shortage stems from the beginning of the pandemic, when auto plants closed for about two months to prevent the spread of the coronavirus among workers. At the same time, sales of computer and game consoles soared, and their producers increased semiconductor orders. When automakers resumed production, chip suppliers had little capacity available for them.\", \"Ford was particularly hard hit earlier this year because a chip plant owned by one of its key suppliers was shut down by a fire. In the second quarter, it was able to make only about half as many vehicles as it originally expected, although its supply of chips has steadily improved since then.\", \"GlobalFoundries was formed in part through acquisitions of plants formerly owned by the chip maker Advanced Micro Devices and IBM. It had an initial public offering of stock in October and is investing heavily to expand its output.\", \"Mr. Farley visited Mr. Caulfield in September at GlobalFoundries headquarters near Albany, N.Y., to discuss how the companies could cooperate, according to a person familiar with the matter.\"]","href_hash":"59a45aac489711ec979a2578fea20d0d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"59a45aac489711ec979a2578fea20d0d"}},
