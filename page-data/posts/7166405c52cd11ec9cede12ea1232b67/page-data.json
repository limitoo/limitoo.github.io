Trump tested positive for coronavirus three days before his first debate with Joseph R. Biden Jr. in 2020, two former administration officials said Wednesday.\", \"The White House did not announce the positive test at the time, and the president received a negative result shortly afterward and carried on with a campaign rally and the debate, the officials said. The account was first reported by The Guardian, which cited a forthcoming book by Mr. Trump\\u2019s chief of staff, Mark Meadows.\", \"The two former officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly, confirmed the timeline on Mr. Trump\\u2019s test results contained in \\u201cThe Chief\\u2019s Chief,\\u201d by Mr. Meadows, Mr. Trump\\u2019s fourth and final White House chief of staff.\", \"The revelation came nearly a year after widespread speculation that Mr. Trump was sick when he first shared a stage with Mr. Biden for their first presidential debate on Sept. 29, months into the pandemic.\", \"The White House declined repeatedly at the time to give a precise chronology of when precisely Mr. Trump first received a positive coronavirus test result. The administration first told the public in the early hours of Oct. 2 that Mr. Trump had tested positive. Mr. Trump was hospitalized later that same day.\", \"Mr. Trump\\u2019s positive result was revealed only after a top adviser, Hope Hicks, was reported to be sick with Covid-19. At the time, Mr. Trump intimated in an interview with Fox News that Ms. Hicks might have given him the virus.\", \"But Mr. Meadows wrote in his book that three days earlier, on Sept. 26, Mr. Trump received a positive test shortly before departing the White House for Air Force One to travel to Pennsylvania for a rally. The White House doctor, Sean Conley, called to deliver the news. \\u201cMr. President,\\u201d Mr. Meadows writes that he told Mr. Trump, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got some bad news. You\\u2019ve tested positive for Covid-19.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Trump\\u2019s response rhymed with \\u201c\\u2018Oh spit, you\\u2019ve gotta be trucking lidding me,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Meadows wrote. The day of the positive result was the day that Mr. Trump held a large Rose Garden event announcing his nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the U.S. Supreme Court.\", \"According to The Guardian, Mr. Meadows wrote that the positive test was taken with an older testing kit, and that the new one was the \\u201cBinax system, and that we were hoping the first test was a false positive.\\u201d Mr. Trump took the second result as \\u201cfull permission to press on as if nothing had happened,\\u201d Mr. Meadows wrote, according to The Guardian. Mr. Meadows asserted in the book that he \\u201cinstructed everyone in his immediate circle to treat him as if he was positive\\u201d during that trip.\", \"The two former officials who confirmed the positive test did not recall Mr. Meadows giving such a directive. And a few hours after the positive test was received, Mr. Trump walked to the back of Air Force One and chatted with reporters, not wearing a mask. One of the reporters, who works for The New York Times, later tested positive for the virus.\", \"The day after the positive result, Mr. Trump attended an event for military families.\", \"Mr. Meadows wrote in his book that Mr. Trump appeared physically off around the time of that test, although by the time of the first debate against Mr. Biden, he seemed a little better.\", \"\\u201cHis face, for the most part at least, had regained its usual light bronze hue, and the gravel in his voice was gone,\\u201d Mr. Meadows wrote, according to The Guardian. \\u201cBut the dark circles under his eyes had deepened. As we walked into the venue around five o\\u2019clock in the evening, I could tell that he was moving more slowly than usual. He walked like he was carrying a little extra weight on his back.\\u201d\", \"In a statement released by his office, Mr. Trump replied, \\u201cThe story of me having Covid prior to, or during, the first debate is Fake News. In fact, a test revealed that I did not have Covid prior to the debate.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Trump did not address when he had received a positive test. Mr. Trump was not independently tested right before the first debate.\"]","href_hash":"7166405c52cd11ec9cede12ea1232b67"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7166405c52cd11ec9cede12ea1232b67"}},
