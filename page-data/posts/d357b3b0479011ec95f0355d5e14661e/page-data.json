That was COP15 (COP stands for \\u201cconference of the parties\\u201d), and it was held in Copenhagen. I write \\u201cnear\\u201d a COP because back then fashion was not considered central to the climate conversation. It wasn\\u2019t, somehow, serious enough.\", \"Fashion was so marginalized, in fact, that in order to talk about its role in creating, and fighting, climate change, it had to hold its own conference. And so the Copenhagen Fashion Summit, which focuses on sustainability, was born.\", \"It took more than a decade, but things have changed. There has been a lot of talk this year about financial bigwigs finally coming to the COP table, but this is the first year that fashion had a meaningful, extended presence. As Stella McCartney, who created a special \\u201cFuture of Fashion\\u201d materials exhibition at the Kelvingrove Art Gallery said, after almost two decades of pushing fashion to acknowledge its effect on the environment, she was a \\u201cCOP virgin\\u201d no longer.\", \"Here\\u2019s what else stuck with me from COP26.\", \"Smack in the middle of the Blue Zone (the official delegate area \\u2014 that is, the one where world leaders spoke), there was an installation by a fashion collective called Generation of Waste made to mimic a bar chart of the various stages of textile waste, from design through raw materials, garment production and so on.\", \"The United Nations Environment Program released a new version of the fashion charter initially created in 2018, now with 130 signatory companies, including, for the first time, LVMH, and with stronger commitments to halve carbon emissions by 2030 (and reach net zero by 2050).\", \"On the fringe, Federico Marchetti, the former Yoox Net a Porter chairman, unveiled a digital ID created by the fashion task force of Prince Charles\\u2019s Sustainable Markets Initiative: a scannable garment tag that acts like a DNA trace for a product\\u2019s manufacturing history, using blockchain technology.\", \"And Textile Exchange, an NGO that sounds like a fabric trading post but actually focuses on creating global standards in fashion, presented a trade policy request to national governments supported by 50 brands. That is an unsexy term for a plea to create tariff and import-export structures that incentivize companies to use \\u201cenvironmentally preferred materials\\u201d rather than, say, polyester. Which is, by the way, the most used material in the entire fashion industry.\", \"No one uttered the now discredited but formerly very popular \\u201cfashion is the second most polluting industry on the planet\\u201d fake stat. Everyone has finally agreed it\\u2019s one of the worst, and that\\u2019s plenty bad enough.\", \"Degrowth: meaning to make less product. Meaning the action taken in response to the fact that in the first 15 years of this century, clothing production doubled in volume, but the number of times a garment was worn before being thrown away decreased 36 percent. For a long time the response to this kind of data was to urge consumers to \\u201cbuy less!\\u201d and \\u201cwear longer!\\u201d Now it seems that brands have owned up to their role in the problem.\", \"That said, it\\u2019s hard to imagine Bernard Arnault of LVMH or Ralph Lauren standing up at their annual shareholders meeting and announcing that their strategy for 2022 is \\u201cdegrowth.\\u201d (It almost sounds like a potential \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d skit.) Except that Halide Alag\\u00f6z, the chief sustainability officer of Ralph Lauren, revealed during a New York Times Climate Hub panel that the brand had secretly been trying it out.\", \"Yup: Ralph Lauren has been practicing degrowth. Not that they call it that, exactly.\", \"The company calls it \\u201cfinancial growth through degrowth of resources,\\u201d according to Ms. Alag\\u00f6z. Which is a terrible name for an interesting initiative, but Lauren is working on it. What it discovered was that it could decouple production from profits, so that even as the company made less stuff, it was able to make money \\u2014 largely by maximizing its understanding of sell-through. It ended up with less wasted product that had to be downstreamed to outlet stores.\", \"\\u201cWe have seen our financials getting better although we produce less units compared to five years ago,\\u201d Ms. Alag\\u00f6z said.\", \"Designers are also getting creative when it comes to product that exists in the world. One of my favorite points came from William McDonough, an author of \\u201cCradle to Cradle,\\u201d a sort of founding manifesto on the circular economy, who pointed out that we should think of garments as source materials that can be re-sourced for second and third use.\", \"This is exactly what the British designer Priya Ahluwalia was thinking when she teamed up with Microsoft to create a platform called Circulate, which allows consumers to send their own used clothes to her company. If the clothes are in acceptable condition, they will get remade and incorporated into her next collection, and the donor will get \\u201creward points\\u201d toward a new purchase with the brand. It\\u2019s a sourcing hack Ms. Ahluwalia said has opened up a whole new channel for fabric and ideas for her.\", \"It\\u2019s a growing buzzword in fashion, thanks to regenerative agriculture, a farming technique that helps to restore soil health and nutrients. One of the less discussed aspects of fashion is just how intertwined it is with agriculture \\u2014 many brands are now investing in supporting regenerative farming \\u2014 but the word has jumped its tracks and filtered up to companies that boast about a \\u201cregenerative strategy\\u201d and \\u201cregenerative tactics,\\u201d which seems to mean \\u2026 well, it's not clear what it means. But it sounds good, right?\", \"This is the sort of fuzzy language that can lead to charges of greenwashing, which is why Textile Exchange is working on a specific definition, out next year.\", \"Honestly, they could expand the definition to encompass a whole lexicon of fashion so everyone would be using the same language. For example, another word I bet we will hear more of comes courtesy of a McKinsey report: \\u201cnearshoring,\\u201d which is to say using suppliers that are not necessarily in your country but are not halfway around the world. After all, according to a presentation by the British brand Bamford, the average merino wool sweater journeys 18,000 miles during its production cycle, from raw material to factory to atelier to shop.\", \"A project for COP27, perhaps.\"]","href_hash":"d357b3b0479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d357b3b0479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}},
