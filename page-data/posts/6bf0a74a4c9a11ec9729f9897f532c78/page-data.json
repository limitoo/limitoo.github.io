Justice Department officials said this strong enforcement aims to ensure a fair and competitive market.\", \"Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who leads the Justice Department's antitrust division, told the AP the companies were \\\"seeking to further consolidate an already cozy sugar industry.\\\"\", \"\\\"Their merger would eliminate aggressive competition in the supply of refined sugar that leads to lower prices, better quality, and more reliable service,\\\" he said.\", \"U.S. Sugar denied this and said it plans to fight the lawsuit. In a statement, the company argued that the merger would increase production and distribution and provide a more secure supply.\", \"\\\"This transaction will improve supply chain logistics and will not result in higher prices or any harm to customers and consumers,\\\" the company said. \\\"We look forward to making our case in court.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938875/attorney-general-merrick-garland.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Attorney General Merrick Garland called antitrust enforcement a pillar to ensuring economic opportunity and fairness.

It says the proposed acquisition would \\\"further consolidate an already concentrated market for refined sugar.\\\" It would cut down on competition, leaving only the new consolidated company and one other major sugar company selling a significant share of refined sugar in the southeastern U.S., the Justice Department contends.\", \"The Justice Department says U.S. Sugar, which operates a large refinery in Florida, sells all of its sugar through a marketing cooperative known as the United Sugars Corporation. Imperial Sugar operates a refinery in Savannah, Georgia, and a sugar transfer and liquidation facility in Ludlow, Kentucky.\", \"\\\"Robust antitrust enforcement is an essential pillar of the Justice Department's commitment to ensuring economic opportunity and fairness for all,\\\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \\\"We will not hesitate to challenge anticompetitive mergers that would harm American consumers and businesses alike.\\\"\", \"The companies announced the acquisition in March, saying that it would return Imperial Sugar to all-American ownership. Imperial Sugar is a subsidiary of Louis Dreyfus Company, which is headquartered in the Netherlands. The Justice Department says Imperial Sugar's revenues were over $700 million in 2020.\", \"When the acquisition was announced, the companies said it would help expand production and reduce manufacturing costs and would increase the security of the U.S. sugar supply.
