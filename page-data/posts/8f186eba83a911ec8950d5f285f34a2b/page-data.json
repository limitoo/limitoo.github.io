In 2019, Morgan Cooper wrote and directed a trailer for an imaginary \\u201cFresh Prince\\u201d reboot, re-conceiving the original as a lurid, soapy modern prime-time drama for adults. Smith liked what he saw and bought the concept. The resulting series has the newcomer Jabari Banks playing Will: a smart and athletic kid torn between his obligations to his old West Philly crew and the expectations of his upper-crust Los Angeles kin.\", \"Also arriving:\", \"Feb. 3\", \"\\u201cDragon Rescue Riders: Heroes of the Sky\\u201d Season 2\", \"Feb. 11\", \"\\u201cMarry Me\\u201d\", \"\\u2018Nightmare Alley\\u2019\", \"Starts streaming: Feb. 1\", \"In the end-of-year crunch of blockbusters and awards contenders, the director Guillermo del Toro\\u2019s visually sumptuous and thematically rich take on William Lindsay Gresham\\u2019s creepy 1946 crime novel, \\u201cNightmare Alley\\u201d (previously adapted, beautifully, in 1947), didn\\u2019t draw as much attention or as big of an audience as it deserved. Now that it\\u2019s arriving on Hulu, fans of film noir will have another chance to catch up. Co-written by del Toro and Kim Morgan, \\u201cNightmare Alley\\u201d has Bradley Cooper playing a sketchy drifter who gets a job at a carnival, where he learns the secrets of a mentalism act and starts passing himself off in high society as a psychic. As usual with del Toro\\u2019s work, the elaborate set designs and memorably offbeat characters are eye-catching, pulling viewers into a morally unsteady world where nearly everyone is either a hustler or a mark.\", \"\\u2018Pam & Tommy\\u2019\", \"Starts streaming: Feb. 2\", \"The mini-series \\u201cPam & Tommy\\u201d is partly about the tumultuous romance and tabloid scandals of the rock drummer Tommy Lee and the actress Pamela Anderson. The show\\u2019s third major character is played by one of its producers and creators, Seth Rogen, who takes on the role of a disgruntled carpenter looking to exact some revenge on the celebrity couple, selling their homemade sex tape in retaliation for an unpaid bill. Sebastian Stan plays Lee and Lily James plays Anderson in the series, which also features the work \\u2014 and the ironic sensibilities \\u2014 of the director Craig Gillespie (\\u201cI, Tonya\\u201d) and the screenwriter Robert D. Siegel (\\u201cThe Wrestler\\u201d). While \\u201cPam & Tommy\\u201d is based on a true story, it has a satirical edge, commenting on how the public sometimes prefers to be entertained by celebrities\\u2019 private lives more than by their actual work.\", \"Also arriving:\", \"Feb. 1\", \"\\u201cYour Attention Please\\u201d Season 2\", \"Feb. 3\", \"\\u201cThe Deep House\\u201d\", \"Feb. 4\", \"\\u201cBeans\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe Beta Test\\u201d\", \"Feb. 5\", \"\\u201cRick and Morty\\u201d Season 5\", \"Feb. 10\", \"\\u201cGully\\u201d\", \"Feb. 11\", \"\\u201cDollface\\u201d Season 2\", \"Feb. 17\", \"\\u201cA House on the Bayou\\u201d\", \"Feb. 18\", \"\\u201cThe Feast\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe King\\u2019s Man\\u201d\", \"Feb. 22\", \"\\u201cHow It Ends\\u201d\", \"Feb. 24\", \"\\u201cThe Last Rite\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSnowfall\\u201d Season 5\", \"Feb. 25\", \"\\u201cNo Exit\\u201d\", \"\\u2018Reacher\\u2019 Season 1\", \"Starts streaming: Feb. 4\", \"The author Lee Child\\u2019s best-known creation is Jack Reacher, a stoic, hulking ex-military policeman and inveterate wanderer who, in over two dozen novels, has frequently stumbled into dangerous situations where he has felt compelled to right wrongs and help the helpless. Tom Cruise played Reacher in two solid action movies, but fans of the books complained that the actor\\u2019s physical type was never quite right. The tall and muscular Alan Ritchson looks much more like Child\\u2019s character in the pulpy TV series \\u201cReacher.\\u201d Its first season adapts the first Reacher novel, the 1997 \\u201cKilling Floor,\\u201d in which the beefy do-gooder kicks around the suspicious locals in a small Georgia town to unravel a murder mystery involving his brother.\", \"\\u2018The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\\u2019 Season 4\", \"Starts streaming: Feb. 18\", \"Season 3 of this award-winning period dramedy ended on a down note, with the stand-up comedian Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) being kicked off a lucrative tour and her manager, Susie Myerson (Alex Borstein), dropping into deep debt. After a two-year hiatus, \\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\\u201d is due for a reset \\u2014 because this isn\\u2019t the kind of series where characters wallow for long. The creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, and her writing-directing partner (and husband), Daniel Palladino, will keep moving their story further into the 1960s, when American popular culture started becoming a bit freer and Midge and Susie can find more outlets for a frank, funny, fast-talking kind of comedy.\", \"Also arriving:\", \"Feb. 4\", \"\\u201cBook of Love\\u201d\", \"\\u201cPhat Tuesdays\\u201d\", \"Feb. 11\", \"\\u201cHomestay\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI Want You Back\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSofia Ni\\u00f1o de Rivera: Lo Volver\\u00eda a Hacer\\u201d\", \"Feb. 18\", \"\\u201cLOL: Last One Laughing Canada\\u201d\", \"\\u201cLov3\\u201d\", \"\\u2018Suspicion\\u2019\", \"Starts streaming: Feb. 4\", \"Based on the Israeli series \\u201cFalse Flag,\\u201d the thriller \\u201cSuspicion\\u201d begins with an abduction caught on a security camera, as the son of a powerful American media mogul is grabbed by masked criminals. Though the mogul is played by Uma Thurman, she is not the show\\u2019s lead. Instead, \\u201cSuspicion\\u201d is about a handful of seemingly unrelated Londoners who are hauled in by the police because of their possible connections to the crime. The series is structured as a mystery, with the investigators piecing together what actually happened and who was involved. But it is also a slice-of-life drama, following the suspects as their lives are upended by an unexpected accusation.\", \"\\u2018Severance\\u2019\", \"Starts streaming: Feb. 18\", \"It\\u2019s tough to pin down the genre for \\u201cSeverance,\\u201d which is perhaps best described as a science-fiction dramedy satire. Created by Dan Erickson \\u2014 with Ben Stiller serving as an executive producer and as the director for the first few episodes \\u2014 the series is set at Lumen Industries, a conglomerate that offers its employees an unusual benefits package. If they choose, workers can divide their work and personal lives so that while they\\u2019re at the office, they have no memory of home, and while they\\u2019re at home, they don\\u2019t recall what happened during the workday. With its sterile, dystopian look and its hints at deeper mysteries, \\u201cSeverance\\u201d recalls similarly allusive and abstract TV shows like \\u201cThe Prisoner\\u201d and \\u201cNowhere Man.\\u201d Erickson aims to keep viewers at once disoriented and intrigued.\", \"Also arriving:\", \"Feb. 11\", \"\\u201cThe Sky Is Everywhere\\u201d\", \"Feb. 18\", \"\\u201cLincoln\\u2019s Dilemma\\u201d\", \"\\u2018Kimi\\u2019\", \"Starts streaming: Feb. 10\", \"The director Steven Soderbergh and the screenwriter David Koepp titled their new film \\u201cKimi\\u201d after the name of a fictional voice-activated digital assistant, akin to Siri or Alexa. Zo\\u00eb Kravitz plays Angela, a woman suffering from agoraphobia who works as a voice-stream interpreter for the company behind Kimi, helping to refine the device\\u2019s utility. When Angela thinks she hears a murder on one of her streams, she has trouble making her bosses or the authorities take her seriously, and she decides to investigate herself. Shot \\u2014 and set \\u2014 during the pandemic, \\u201cKimi\\u201d borrows from the likes of \\u201cRear Window\\u201d and \\u201cPanic Room,\\u201d telling a thriller story with a small cast and limited locations.\", \"Also arriving:\", \"Feb. 3\", \"\\u201cRaised By Wolves\\u201d Season 2\", \"Feb. 10\", \"\\u201cThe Girl Before\\u201d\", \"Feb. 18\", \"\\u201cPainting with John\\u201d Season 2\", \"Feb. 28\", \"\\u201cMy Brilliant Friend: Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8f186eba83a911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8f186eba83a911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
