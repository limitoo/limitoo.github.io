Several apartments up, a boy with a bad toothache is waiting for the dentist. The mailman is forced to climb the stairs because the kids have taken over the elevator. In the flat below that of a man with a broken leg, a married couple has just moved in.\", \"For Ali Mitgutsch, who died in Munich on Jan. 10 at 86, all these stories happen on a single teeming page, each of them told not with words but through pictures. And pages like it filled his children\\u2019s books.\", \"They have lined the bookshelves of generations of children in Germany, where he became a household name, and where he was celebrated as the father of what Germans call the \\u201cWimmelbuch\\u201d (meaning a book that is swarming) \\u2014 books whose detailed drawings of vast groups of people may include visual jokes and anecdotes.\", \"Over his career he drew more than 70 books, which have sold millions of copies and been translated into 15 languages. He also produced puzzles and posters.\", \"Their success anticipated similar publishing phenomena, most notably the British illustrator Martin Hanford\\u2019s \\u201cWhere\\u2019s Wally?\\u201d series.

The book, which is still in print, in 1969 won Germany\\u2019s prestigious youth book prize the Deutscher Jugendliteraturpreis.\", \"\\u201cCheeky, funny and affectionate, he looked at the world and at our human weaknesses,\\u201d said President Steinmeier, who in 2018 gave Mr. Mitgutsch Germany\\u2019s highest civilian honor, the Bundesverdienstkreuz.\", \"Mr. Mitgutsch did not like the word \\u201cWimmelbuch,\\u201d even though his publisher used it in the titles of many of his later books. He preferred the term \\u201cself-narrating picture book.\\u201d Indeed, texts were rare in his books; words were usually found only on signs within a picture.\", \"In his 2015 memoir, written with Ingmar Gregorzewski, Mr. Mitgutsch recalled lying awake in bed as a child in the summer during World War II, straining his ears and letting his imagination run, greedy for the bustle of city life in his working-class neighborhood of Munich. His drawings, done from a bird\\u2019s-eye perspective (usually from roughly the height of his third-floor childhood apartment), gave views of everyday life that were at once encompassing and intimate; it reminded some reviewers of the Flemish Renaissance painter Pieter Bruegel.\", \"Alfons Mitgutsch was born on Aug. 21, 1935, the youngest of four children of Ludwig and Pauline Mitgutsch. His father, who had trained as baker, became a railroad worker after injuring his hand in World War I.
