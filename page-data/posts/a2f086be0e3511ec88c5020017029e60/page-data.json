However, the Taliban took over Kabul in mid-August.\", \"Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr show on Sunday, Sir Nick was asked how the predictions had been wrong.\", \"\\\"I think everybody got it wrong is the straight answer,\\\" he said. \\\"Even the Taliban didn't expect things to change as quickly as they did.\\\"\", \"The chief of the defence staff said: \\\"I don't think what anybody predicted was how fragile that Afghan government was and how fragile it was in relation to the command of its armed forces.\\\"\", \"The Taliban is expected to announce a new government in the coming days, meaning foreign powers will have to adapt to the prospect of dealing with a Taliban administration.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">International help needed</div>\", \"Sir Nick said it was too early to say how the Taliban would govern, but there was a possibility the militant group would be less repressive than it was in the past. \", \"\\\"On the face of it, it doesn't look good at the moment. But let's see what happens. It may well change,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I also think they're not stupid enough to [not] know the Afghan people have changed and they want a slightly different sort of governance.\\\"\", \"On Sunday, the Taliban was accused of murdering a female police officer. The killing comes amid reports the group is escalating its repression of women.\", \"Sir Nick said it was now down to the international community to encourage the Taliban to govern in a different way, he added.\", \"\\\"They're going to need a bit of help to run a modern state effectively,\\\" he said. \\\"If they behave, perhaps they'll get some help.\\\"\", \"Asked whether military intelligence was wrong, Sir Nick said: \\\"No... many of the assessments suggested it wouldn't last the course of the year and, of course, that's proven to be correct.\\\"\", \"He said: \\\"It's a much broader thing than just strictly military intelligence.\", \"\\\"The way it works in this country is we have the joint intelligence committee which sits inside the Cabinet Office.
