This should include vaccines, high-quality surveillance systems, a focus on clean air indoors, and financial support for people to isolate when sick.\\\"\", \"With a change in restrictions, Victoria University of Wellington and Umbrella Wellbeing clinical psychologist Dr Dougal Sutherland says they government will no longer encourage working from home.\", \"But Sutherland warns there may be psychological consequences for workplaces encouraging their people to return in person.\", \"Flexibility and agility will be key for adjusting to this new normal, he said.\", \"\\\"It seems likely many people will continue working from home, at least some of the time. This presents a challenge to organisations about how they create psychologically safe teams in a dispersed environment. There is also the challenge of how to support people with different levels of anxiety associated with increased human contact.\", \"\\\"Research shows that allowing people to work from home a few days a week is associated with better wellbeing and productivity, so allowing workers to continue a hybrid office/home set-up should be encouraged.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"8bfda1e8bb6a11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8bfda1e8bb6a11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
