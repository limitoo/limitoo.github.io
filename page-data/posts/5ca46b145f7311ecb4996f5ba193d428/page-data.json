For those new to the sport, and there seem to be a lot following the success of Netflix's Drive to Survive series focussing on F1 and its cast of characters, safety cars are the great equaliser in any race.\", \"Cars are inevitably bunched together before a restart can continue and those who play their cards right can find themselves getting a fresh set of tyres 'for free', meaning the time it takes to pit is negated by the slowness of the pack.\", \"Verstappen did just that and, in retrospect, Mercedes and Hamilton probably wish they had too. Instead they opted for track position over fresh tyres. For both teams, their strategy was a gamble but Red Bull and Verstappen had the slight advantage of having literally nothing to lose by going for it.\", \"Here's where things get weird. Verstappen was in second place but had five lapped cars between him and leader Hamilton. FIA race director Michael Massi had the unenviable task for figuring it how and if they could restart the race with only three laps to go, all the while trying to focus on getting Latifi's Williams safely off the track.\", \"A first call was made, that the lapped cars could not unlap themselves on the restart. This would mean they couldn't 'race' against Hamilton or Verstappen and were technically obliged to get out of Verstappen's way as he lunged for Hamilton. This didn't sit well with Red Bull's Christian Horner and, it should be noted, the Sky commentators either who believed the lapped cars should be moved ahead to let Hamilton and Verstappen have their proper race positions realised.\", \"Massi made his final fateful call, only the lapped cars between Verstappen and Hamilton would unlap themselves and the safety car would leave the track leaving one lap - ONE LAP - for a shootout between Verstappen and Hamilton. We know the rest: Verstappen, on his much fresher tyres, had a strong advantage over Hamilton, took the lead and won the world championship.\", \"People are rightfully or wrongfully upset about what took place and believe Hamilton was robbed of his championship in order to give viewers a Ron Howard-esque (or Netflix documentary series) dramatic finish to the race. But the alternative, finishing and deciding the championship in a procession behind a slow moving safety car isn't so appealing either.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/283064/eight_col_Max_Verstappen_raises_trophy.jpg?1639606605\\\" alt=\\\"Max Verstappen wins the F1 title\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nMax Verstappen wins the F1 title \\nPhoto: Photosport\\n</div>\", \"Without getting into it too much or risking drawing the ire of some pundits, we should consider that Mercedes opted not to pit for fresh tyres knowing a late shootout was possible. Hamilton's own team mate Valtteri Bottas, on crossing the line and hearing the news said, \\\"I knew he needed new tyres.\\\" We should also give pause when criticising the decisions of Massi when he had a matter of seconds to make a call with Mercedes Toto Wolff and Red Bull's Horner screaming in his ears and a car to clear from the track.\", \"Finally, a dubious call went Hamilton's way earlier in the race when he was passed by Verstappen but went of track to stay in the lead. If he'd be forced to give the position back, his teammate Sergio Perez could've snuck in with him and led to a very different race. Sometimes things go in your favour, sometimes they don't, \\\"it's a motor race,\\\" as Massi said.\", \"Let's instead look at back on the highlights of this spectacular season, the first worth watching in a long time. Even Hamilton was basically admitting Formula 1 was bit boring in the past couple years. With big changes coming to car designs to even the playing field and encourage more passing, and now a firmly established rival for Hamilton, we could be entering a golden era for the sport.\", \"Yuki Tsunoda, Sergio Perez and Carlos Sainz in Abu Dhabi\", \"Carlos Sainz and Ferrari deserve a shoutout for his third place finish after a strong and consistent season with the ever improving Ferrari who took out third place in the constructer's championship with the help with his teammate Charles Leclerc.\", \"Verstappen's teammate Sergio 'Checo' Perez, the \\\"absolute animal\\\" the \\\"legend\\\" as he was called by his team during the race did an incredible job defending and challenging Hamilton to help Verstappen catch up to the leader. Mercedes and Hamilton called it dangerous driving but it looked more like very good driving to the audience and commentators.\", \"With Red Bull's sister team Alpha Tauri being such a brutal incubator for young drivers (New Zealand's own Brendon Hartley getting chopped after one season) it's nice to see Tsunoda recover through the year after a bad start and end the season with his best finish yet, P4.\", \"Pierre Gasly and Esteban Ocon continue to prove their worth\", \"While we're on the subject of Alpha Tauri, Pierre Gasly put in yet another stellar year for the team after his dramatic mid-season demotion from Red Bull in 2019. Gasly went on to prove his chops, driving in a midfield car he won the Monza grand prix in 2020 and earned a podium finish in Azerbaijan this year.\", \"He's consistently found himself a competitive qualifier and finished most races with the top ten. His future with the team, given its aforementioned role as an incubator for Red Bull, seems a bit up in the air. Red Bull haven't given any public signals of promotion and chose Sergio Perez over him for 2020. It might be nice to see Gasly take his future into his own hands and look at a move to another team in the near future.\", \"It would be very cool if that team was Renault/Alpine where he could join fellow young French driver Esteban Ocon who's made a triumphant return to F1 after a similarly shocking drop when Racing Point's owner chose to replace him with his son Lance Stroll in 2018. Ocon proved he was ready for the big leagues, after some excruciating errors in his first stint, and has performed consistently, even getting a race win at the Hungarian Grand Prix after starting from eight on the grid.\", \"Alas former world champion Fernando Alonso has replaced the outgoing Daniel Riccardo and has extended his contract to 2022. But two young French drivers driving for a team partly owned by the French government? C'mon.\", \"The many goofy smiles of Daniel Riccardo and Lando Norris\", \"McLaren has become the most loveable team in F1 by signing the two happy-go-lucky scamps on the grid. Riccardo and Norris are impossible not to love and have earned themselves a huge number of fans with their goofy antics on the paddock. Both have put in good performances to boot and McLaren's trajectory as a top team continues to rise, earning fourth place in the constructer's championship.\", \"Norris came so close to his first victory at the Russian Grand Prix but persistent showers and his decision not the pit for intermediate tyres cost him as he spun out in the final few laps. Close behind was Hamilton who very nearly made the same call not to pit and went on to win the race. It was moving to see Hamilton comfort poor Norris who was obviously devastated. Let's hope for a P1 in 2022.\", \"Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen's title fight\", \"A bit obvious but it's what made the season so thrilling. There was a point in the Abu Dhabi grand prix where both rivals were a full 24 seconds ahead of the rest of the pack which just goes to show what level these two were driving at.\", \"Tension increased throughout the season after their clashes/crashes at Silverstone and Monza and Hamilton had to deliver a superb comeback to wrest championship points away from Verstappen. Going into the final race totally equal on points set up the perfect showdown and, controversy aside, watching Hamilton and Verstappen's slow cat and mouse as the safety car went in and Hamilton had to restart the race on the final lap had everyone on the edge of their seats.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/274701/eight_col_top.jpg?1631554959\\\" alt=\\\"Crash of Max Verstappen and Lewis Hamilton at the Italian Grand Prix 2021.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nJust one of the racing battles between the pair that ended in a crash. \\nPhoto: PHOTOSPORT\\n</div>\", \"The final word\", \"There was so much to unpack in this season I joined fellow RNZ F1 fan Sarah Robson for a quickfire round up.\", \"What did you make of the final race? \", \"Sarah Robson: Sir Lewis Hamilton was robbed and I still don't think I've come to terms with it.\", \"Francis Cook: Better than finishing behind a safety car but inconsistent and confusing calls from Massi. All unlapped cars should've gone through the previous lap.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/276796/eight_col_cs.jpg?1633537917\\\" alt=\\\"Ferrari F1 driver Carlos Sainz\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nCarlos Sainz in his Ferrari \\nPhoto: PHOTOSPORT\\n</div>\", \"Your driver of the year? \", \"SR: It's got to be a tie between Pierre Gasly and Carlos Sainz. Gasly's been so consistent, especially in qualifying, and looks to be knocking on the door for a seat in the top Red Bull team. Sainz, ever under-rated, has driven brilliantly in his first season at Ferrari. He's had the longest active points-scoring streak of the season, but has barely rated a mention when he's made it on to the podium.\", \"FC: Lewis Hamilton. His comeback from the back of the grid to win the race in Brazil was stunning stuff and marked the beginning of his overall comeback in the season. He was brilliant in the final desert duels and magnanimous and gracious in the face of his crushing last lap defeat. He was clearly fighting back emotion when he embraced Verstappen and got on the podium but managed to spray a bit of champagne and take a mouthful.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/135586/eight_col_000_9UJ2MF.jpg?1639424528\\\" alt=\\\"Champion Red Bull's Dutch driver Max Verstappen (right) greets second-placed Mercedes' British driver Lewis Hamilton after the Abu Dhabi F1 Grand Prix at the Yas Marina Circuit on 12 December, 2021.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nAn emotional Lewis Hamilton congratulates Max Verstappen on his victory. \\nPhoto: AFP / Andrej Isakovic\\n</div>\", \"Favorite moment of the season? \", \"SR: The McLaren 1-2 at Monza. McLaren's first win since 2012, McLaren's first 1-2 since 2010 and Daniel Ricciardo's first win since Monaco 2018. When those papaya cars crossed the line, it was honestly the most joy I've felt watching any sporting event. Ever.\", \"FC: Esteban Ocon win in Hungary. It was a season where teamwork was on full display and Fernando Alonso working the pack to help Ocon get his first win was touching stuff.\", \"Predictions for 2022? \", \"SR: It's so hard to know with a new car and new regulations. Expect Lewis Hamilton to come back firing and more determined and ever. And after a good run of form towards the end of this season, watch out for Alpine.\", \"FC: Hamilton is going to get a run for his money not just from Verstappen but also from new teammate George Russell who I think will fly in the Merc.\", \"Biggest disappointment?\", \"SR: Daniel Ricciardo's form in his first year at McLaren. He went to the team with the expectation he'd out-perform Lando Norris, but Norris ended up having the far better season. But he'll be determined to impress next year in the new car and show he's still one of F1's best.\", \"FC: Haas were just so hard to watch and Mick Schumacher's debut season was a non-event. They've made it clear they had essentially given up and were focussing on 2022 so let's see how that goes with the new car.\", \"Quote of the year:\", \"SR: \\\"Tell Esteban to defend like a lion\\\" - Fernando Alonso on the radio in Qatar GP, urging his teammate to help him secure his first F1 podium in seven years.\", \"FC: \\\"Toto, it's called a motor race. We went car racing.\\\" - Massi standing up to a raging Toto Wolff on FIA radio.\"]","href_hash":"5ca46b145f7311ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5ca46b145f7311ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
