And I liked Bibi. I still like Bibi,\\\" Trump said, referring to Netanyahu by his nickname, in the remarks published by the Yediot Aharonot newspaper. \\\"But I also like loyalty. ... Bibi could have stayed quiet. He has made a terrible mistake.\\\"\", \" Netanyahu congratulated Mr. Biden more than 12 hours after the election had been called and after most other world leaders. Netanyahu didn't refer to him as president-elect in the tweet, and followed it up with a post praising Trump.\", \"Trump appeared to be particularly incensed by a video released by Netanyahu on Jan. 20, the day Mr. Biden was inaugurated, in which Netanyahu said he and Mr. Biden had a \\\"warm personal friendship going back many decades.\\\"\", \"Congratulations President @JoeBiden and Vice President @KamalaHarris on your historic inauguration.\", \"President Biden, you and I have had a warm personal friendship going back many decades. pic.twitter.com/3cO4Zb1o1Q\", \"\\\"I haven't spoken to him since. F-- him,\\\" Trump was quoted as saying.\", \" Netanyahu was replaced as prime minister last summer after he was unable to form a governing majority in the wake of four hard-fought elections in less than two years.\", \" The Trump administration took unprecedented steps to support Israel, including dropping objections to its settlements in the occupied West Bank and recognizing Jerusalem as its capital. After proposing a Mideast plan that was adamantly rejected by the Palestinians, the administration brokered normalization agreements between Israel and four Arab states.\", \"Trump said his decision to recognize Israel's annexation of the Golan Heights, which it captured from Syria in the 1967 war, helped Netanyahu ahead of Israeli elections in April 2019.\", \" \\\"I did it right before the election, which helped him (Netanyahu) a lot,\\\" Trump said.\", \" The Trump administration also withdrew from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, to which Israel had been strongly opposed. After he re-imposed U.S. sanctions that had been lifted under the deal, Iran began publicly exceeding the limits it had set on its nuclear program. Mr. Biden is now working with world powers to try to restore the agreement. \", \" \\\"I'll tell you what - had I not come along, I think Israel was going to be destroyed,\\\" Trump said. \\\"I think Israel would have been destroyed maybe by now.\\\"\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"5c48054c59b811ec85d31be2e4c2c325"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5c48054c59b811ec85d31be2e4c2c325"}},
