He was 87. \", \"The cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife, Maura Smith, said.\", \"Over a six-decade career, Mr. Schapiro trained his camera\\u2019s eye on an astonishing array of people across the American landscape as he sought to capture the emotional heart of his subjects, whether they were narcotics users in Harlem, migrant workers in Arkansas or movie luminaries in Hollywood.\", \"\\u201cI enjoy waiting for that moment when I sense something about someone,\\u201d Mr. Schapiro said in a 2017 interview with David Fahey, a friend and owner of the Fahey/Klein Gallery in Los Angeles.\", \"As a freelance photographer in the 1960s for Life and Look, the oversized magazines that brought photojournalism into American homes, Mr. Schapiro documented the struggle for civil rights. When those magazines folded in the early 1970s or scaled back, he moved to Los Angeles and made his living by producing promotional material for movies, album covers and portraits of celebrities.\", \"All the while, he remained a social justice activist, documentarian and cultural historian and in his 80s was taking pictures of the Black Lives Matter movement. He last photographed a demonstration, against the death penalty, a year ago in Terre Haute, Ind.\", \"On the cultural front, he found his way in 1961 to the Village Vanguard in Greenwich Village, where his camera captured a fabled live performance by the jazz pianist Bill Evans. He made arresting images of Barbra Streisand, including one where she is soaking in a bathtub, her cigarette holder in silhouette (\\u201cone of my favorite photographers,\\u201d Ms. Streisand wrote on Twitter after his death). He caught Andy Warhol being dazzled by the charismatic actress Edie Sedgwick. And he shot the cover for the debut issue of People magazine in 1974 \\u2014 a portrait of Mia Farrow in her role as Daisy Buchanan in \\u201cThe Great Gatsby.\\u201d\", \"Always self-effacing, he maintained that the many striking images he had made of David Bowie had sprung from the singer\\u2019s imagination. As Mr. Schapiro told The Chicago Tribune, \\u201cI was merely the conduit from genius into the light of day.\\u201d\", \"At 5-foot-3 Mr. Schapiro often succeeded in his goal of disappearing, of becoming \\u201ca fly on the wall\\u201d and waiting for something to unfold in front of him.\", \"\\u201cYou didn\\u2019t get the sense from his photographs that Steve was even in the room,\\u201d Sidney Monroe, co-owner of a photojournalism gallery in Santa Fe, N.M., that exhibited Mr. Schapiro\\u2019s work, said in an interview.\", \"Mr. Fahey described Mr. Schapiro as \\u201ca spiritual person, empathetic and giving,\\u201d adding, \\u201cHis primary motivation was to help the world be a better place.\\u201d\", \"A photo essay in 1961 exposed the primitive conditions for migrant workers in Arkansas. First published in Jubilee, a Catholic magazine, then republished by The New York Times Magazine, his work led to the installation of electricity in the workers\\u2019 camps.\", \"After reading a 1962 New Yorker essay by James Baldwin about the Black experience, Mr. Schapiro traveled with Mr. Baldwin on his 1963 tour of the South. Among the many pictures he took was one of Mr. Baldwin holding a record album by the Contours called \\u201cDo You Love Me (Now That I Can Dance),\\u201d an image that Mr. Schapiro said always made him feel Mr. Baldwin\\u2019s loneliness. Subsequent editions of Mr. Baldwin\\u2019s classic \\u201cThe Fire Next Time\\u201d (1963) were illustrated with more than 100 of Mr. Schapiro\\u2019s images from their journey together.\", \"On that tour, Mr. Schapiro crossed paths with and photographed a young John Lewis, then chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee; Mr. Schapiro said later that the portrait showed \\u201csomeone who knows who he is.\\u201d When Mr. Lewis died in 2020, Mr. Schapiro\\u2019s portrait of him appeared on the cover of Time and is scheduled to become a U.S. postage stamp, Mr. Schapiro\\u2019s wife said. It will not be his first stamp; his 1980 portrait of Paul Newman became one in 2015.\", \"Mr. Schapiro also encountered the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and photographed him often, including on the 1965 voting rights march from Selma to Montgomery, with the crowds swelling along the route.\", \"\\u201cHe was important to the movement,\\u201d Ava DuVernay, the filmmaker, wrote on Twitter after Mr. Schapiro\\u2019s death. \\u201cHis images moved minds during a crucial time.\\u201d\", \"After Dr. King\\u2019s assassination, Mr. Schapiro immediately flew to Memphis. He went first to the rooming house from which James Earl Ray had fired the fatal shots at Dr. King, and he managed to get pictures of Mr. Ray\\u2019s handprint on a bathroom wall. Mr. Schapiro was then granted access to Dr. King\\u2019s empty room at the Lorraine Motel and photographed the artifacts \\u2014 an open briefcase, used coffee cups \\u2014 of a life suddenly cut short.\", \"\\u201cIt was not a picture that Life ran,\\u201d Mr. Schapiro told The Chicago Sun-Times in 2020. \\u201cBut it became an important picture to me.\\u201d\", \"Stephen Albert Schapiro was born during the Great Depression, on Nov. 16, 1934, in Brooklyn and grew up in the Bronx. His father, David Schapiro, owned a stationery store in Rockefeller Center, where his mother, Esther (Sperling) Schapiro, also worked.\", \"Steve attended Stuyvesant High School and Amherst College. After a year, he transferred to Bard College in upstate New York, which he found more suitable for free spirits like himself. He majored in literature and graduated in 1953.\", \"He had discovered photography at summer camp at the age of 9 and as he grew up, he continued taking pictures. Enamored of Henri Cartier Bresson, the French photographer, he sought to emulate his style as he roamed the streets of New York.\", \"\\u201cHe had a great sense of design in his photographs, and at the same time gave you some information about the situation he was capturing,\\u201d Mr. Schapiro said of Mr. Bresson. \\u201cBut most of all, he hit an emotional, sometimes extremely symbolic moment regarding his subject \\u2014 even if he was just capturing Henri Matisse in his studio.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Schapiro then studied more formally with W. Eugene Smith, a photojournalist renowned for portraying social conditions of the mid-20th century. Mr. Schapiro even embedded with Mr. Smith for a time in his Manhattan loft. He learned how to make prints and picked up some tricks of the trade, like showing two points of interest in a portrait, which Mr. Smith told him would make the viewer\\u2019s eye go back and forth and thereby hold the viewer\\u2019s attention.\", \"Above all, Mr. Schapiro said in a 2019 interview with photo.com, Mr. Smith \\u201cgave me a sense of humanity and the human condition.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Schapiro was married three times. His first two marriages ended in divorce.\", \"In addition to his wife, Ms. Smith, (no relation to W. Eugene Smith), he is survived by two sons, Theophilus Donoghue and Adam Schapiro; two daughters, Elle Harvey and Taylor Schapiro; and four grandchildren. Another son, Teddy Schapiro, died in 2016.\", \"Mr. Schapiro\\u2019s photographs have been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian, the Getty Museum and elsewhere. They have also been collected in books, including \\u201cAmerican Edge\\u201d (2000), about people living on the edge of society, and \\u201cSchapiro\\u2019s Heroes\\u201d (2007), intimate profiles of 10 celebrities. Some of his other books are based on his work on movie sets, including on \\u201cThe Godfather,\\u201d \\u201cTaxi Driver\\u201d and \\u201cThe Way We Were.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Schapiro believed that his civil rights images stood out because so few photographers were covering the movement. But he said the power of photography had been diminished in recent years because of its ubiquity.\", \"\\u201cI think we are on the way to a day when cameras as we have known them will be obsolete,\\u201d he told The Chicago Tribune in 2016. \\u201cWe will be using just cellphones to take photos as the technology advances and the quality gets better.\\u201d\", \"But, he added, \\u201cI will ever believe that it is the photographer who counts, not the camera.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"65bb4a9c7d6911ec805a197153eb7a2f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"65bb4a9c7d6911ec805a197153eb7a2f"}},
