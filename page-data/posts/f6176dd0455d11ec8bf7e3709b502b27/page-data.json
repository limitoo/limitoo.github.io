The LongHouse board gave little explanation for the change at the time, and more than 30 donors, many of them major supporters, have said they are withholding further gifts.\", \"Several donors said they have removed LongHouse from their wills. One board member resigned in October but has not given a reason for her departure. An ex officio member of the board resigned in protest.\", \"\\u201cI was astonished,\\u201d said Marcia Wilson, a donor and former trustee who has suspended her gifts. \\u201cFlabbergasted. Everyone had nothing but praise for Matko. I still don\\u2019t understand the logic.\\u201d\", \"Some of the donors are also upset because they say Larsen changed a trust agreement seven weeks before he died to reduce his bequest to the organization. Last month, a donor filed a complaint with the New York State Attorney General\\u2019s Office, asserting that several board members had not fulfilled their fiduciary responsibilities to LongHouse because, the complaint said, they had actively supported changes to the agreement that reduced the bequest to LongHouse.\", \"Supporters of the board say the decision to replace the director was motivated by an expansion of LongHouse\\u2019s mission. They say the institution will soon become not just a garden and sculpture reserve, but a full-time museum, one that incorporates Larsen\\u2019s home as a site for exhibitions. For that, the trustees decided they wanted a curator with broader experience.\", \"An interim director, named in October, is Carrie Rebora Barratt, a former deputy director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art who later led the New York Botanical Garden as its president for two years, ending in 2020.\", \"Karen A. Monroe, the lawyer who incorporated LongHouse in 1991 as a nonprofit, the year before it opened to the public, blamed Tomicic for encouraging the dissent. \\u201cOnly some donors are unhappy,\\u201d she said.\", \"\\u201cThat is not by a stretch of the imagination, the majority of them,\\u201d she continued. \\u201cThere\\u2019s always a couple of them, what do they call it, the \\u2018noisy minority\\u2019?\\u201d\", \"Tomicic declined to comment. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want any trouble for me or my family,\\u201d he said.\", \"The board\\u2019s defenders say it was Larsen\\u2019s prerogative to decide how he wanted to distribute his assets. They also say the institution is in a good financial position despite the potential cutback in gifts, and that donations are running ahead of last year because some existing donors have increased their support and new benefactors have stepped forward.\", \"\\u201cDespite messages from a few upset donors, we remain confident, financially solid and grateful to our supporters,\\u201d the board said in a statement.\", \"Though the way forward for LongHouse now seems more complicated, Larsen\\u2019s legacy as a textile designer is clear. His textiles grace interiors that included Frank Lloyd Wright\\u2019s Fallingwater and his work is in the permanent collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum.\", \"In 1975, he bought land in East Hampton to create a microcosm that reflected his designs, global travels and art collection. Today, it includes the house where he had lived and grounds filled with roughly 60 contemporary sculptures, a combination of pieces on loan and permanent works, including Buckminster Fuller\\u2019s \\u201cFly\\u2019s Eye Dome\\u201d and Yoko Ono\\u2019s giant, monochromatic chess game, \\u201cPlay It by Trust.\\u201d\", \"Tomicic, 56, who studied at the University of Zagreb in Croatia and at the New York Botanical Garden, started at LongHouse in 1996 as executive director and was paid $194,075 in 2019, according to the institution\\u2019s most recent tax returns. He had previously worked as a personal assistant to Henry Geldzahler, the Met curator and former New York City cultural affairs commissioner.\", \"During his years at LongHouse, he built personal relationships with board members and staff, which is why there is an emotional cast to the dispute now engulfing the sculpture garden. When Dianne Benson, one of the board members who voted to replace Tomicic, got married last year, it had been Tomicic who had walked her down the aisle.\", \"\\u201cThis is not an \\u2018et tu Brute\\u2019 moment,\\u201d Benson said in regards to her vote. \\u201cMy personal feelings and what is best for LongHouse are two entirely different things.\\u201d\", \"Some staff were also upset by the news that Tomicic had been let go, according to Joanne Kahn, who worked part-time in the gift shop and said she later resigned as a result.\", \"An arborist, Ray Smith, said he had donated specimen trees and his company\\u2019s services to LongHouse for 18 years, work that he said would have cost the institution well over $900,000.\", \"\\u201cAfter what\\u2019s happened,\\u201d Smith said. \\u201cAnything they need, they\\u2019ll have to pay for.\\u201d\", \"Susie Gelman who, with her husband, Michael Gelman, said they have given $100,000 to LongHouse since 2012, said they were stunned.\", \"\\u201cI really don\\u2019t see how my husband and I can continue supporting LongHouse,\\u201d Gelman wrote in an email. \\u201cIt pains me deeply.\\u201d\", \"Some of the donors who say they are withholding their gifts say they are concerned that Tomicic\\u2019s tense relationship with Peter Olsen, 68, a trustee and Larsen\\u2019s companion of 30 years, who lived with him, played a role in Tomicic\\u2019s departure.\", \"The board has denied that. It has acknowledged that it was not initially forthcoming about what exactly had precipitated its decision to remove Tomicic, but has said that its reticence to reveal details earlier this fall in the face of criticism was an attempt to be professional and discreet. In an Oct. 19 letter to the institution\\u2019s members, the board\\u2019s co-presidents said that the \\u201csilence about the change in leadership was meant to be respectful to all the parties,\\u201d who \\u201cagreed to part ways.\\u201d\", \"More recently, in an email to The New York Times, the board expanded on its explanation and said it understood the commotion as a signal of how deeply its members regard the institution. \\u201cWe ask for patience and in return promise to be more forthcoming and open,\\u201d the board wrote.\", \"The change in directors, it said, was based on LongHouse\\u2019s need to transition from \\u201cone man\\u2019s residence with limited public visitation to the grounds, to a more fully public institution.\\u201d One of the first priorities of its plan is to convert Larsen\\u2019s 13,000-square-foot home into a museum, the board said, and to do that it felt LongHouse needed \\u201cnew leadership with commensurate skills and experience to help professionalize and sustain\\u201d it.\", \"The board described Barratt, the interim director who had, in her time at the Met, helped oversee the renovation of the American Wing and Islamic galleries, as having \\u201cextensive experience in museum and public garden leadership.\\u201d\", \"The complaint filed with the attorney general\\u2019s office argues that LongHouse will be significantly affected by the changes in the trust agreement that were made shortly before Larsen\\u2019s death. The complaint says that under a trust agreement Larsen made in April 2020, the bulk of his estate, including his Park Avenue apartment, was to go to LongHouse when he died.\", \"But the agreement, according to the complaint, was amended in November 2020, just before Larsen\\u2019s death, to substantially reduce the gift to LongHouse by allotting additional money to a trust that will pay Olsen a stipend of $120,000 a year. Olsen was also given lifetime use of the apartment with its maintenance fees covered.\", \"The board said it could not comment on the complaint because it has not seen a copy of it, but it released a statement to present its perspective on the changes to the trust agreement.\\u201cThe majority of Jack\\u2019s estate goes to LongHouse,\\u201d the statement said. \\u201cWhat is provided to Peter also reverts to LongHouse on his demise.\\u201d\", \"The complaint says that several board members campaigned for the changes that would help Olsen, at the expense of LongHouse.\", \"\\u201cHow can you be on the board of LongHouse and not stand up for LongHouse and let monies that were initially directed to LongHouse go elsewhere?\\u201d said Wilson, one donor who has suspended her gifts.\", \"The board, responding to such concerns, said in a statement: \\u201cIn all of these matters, the Board acted ethically and in the best interests of LongHouse after careful deliberation and in fulfillment of its fiduciary duty.\\u201d\", \"Olsen declined to comment beyond saying that he fully supports the board\\u2019s actions and plans, \\u201cwhich I believe to be consistent with Jack\\u2019s vision.\\u201d\", \"The complaint to the attorney general\\u2019s office expresses concern that Larsen approved these changes during a period when his health and mental acuity were compromised, just after he had been released from the hospital after breaking a femur in a fall. It says one draft of the changes was shown to Larsen while he was still in the intensive care unit and that the final draft was signed six days after his discharge from that unit.\", \"Other friends suggest such concerns are ill-founded. \\u201cAlthough his physical condition was deeply deteriorating,\\u201d said Roseline Koener, an artist in Westhampton who visited Larsen, her friend, several times after he left the hospital, \\u201che always kept his mind.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f6176dd0455d11ec8bf7e3709b502b27"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f6176dd0455d11ec8bf7e3709b502b27"}},
