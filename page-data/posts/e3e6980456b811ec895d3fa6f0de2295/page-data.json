Whoever wins that primary will face Democrat and voting rights activist Stacey Abrams in the election on November 8, 2022.\", \"Perdue lost his Senate seat in a runoff against Democrat Jon Ossoff in January.\", \"Georgia, long considered a ruby-red state, is now a key battleground for the Republicans and Democrats, after Democrat Raphael Warnock beat Republican rival Kelly Loeffler in another January runoff there and the Democrats won back the state from the GOP in the 2020 presidential election.\", \"Many of Perdue's supporters say he can beat former Georgia Congresswoman Abrams in the gubernatorial race in 2022, while Kemp cannot. Kemp narrowly defeated Abrams in a previous gubernatorial contest in Georgia in 2018 by 55,000 votes.\", \"Betfred believes that a Republican is likely to win next year's election, despite Abrams being a popular choice with punters.\", \"Perdue has odds of 13-8 of declaring victory in 2022, while Kemp has 7-4 odds. Abrams has 2-1 odds, while Republican Vernon Jones has odds of 25-1.\", \"\\\"She was also a popular choice with punters in the Vice Presidential market in 2020, although she fell away towards the closing stages.\", \"\\\"Her being the Democrat candidate for Georgia Governor in 2022 is all but assured and we have her at 2-1 to go on and win the election.\", \"\\\"It is hard not see a Republican ultimately winning the race but seeing Republicans tear themselves apart in an ugly Primary will be a delight to Stacey and her campaign.\", \"\\\"The Republican fight will be fascinating but we have Perdue as slight favourite over Kemp just now. Trump's endorsement will be all but assured and the attacks on Kemp will only intensify over the campaign.\", \"\\\"Music to the ears for Stacey Abrams!\\\"\", \"Betway meanwhile ranks Abrams as favorite to win with odds at 8-11. She is followed by Kemp with 7-4 and then Perdue at 11-4.\", \"The news that Perdue will run, first reported on Sunday by Politico, divided Republicans. Several reports said that Perdue was persuaded by former president Donald Trump to run against Abrams, after Kemp refused to help block the 2020 election results in the state, which helped Democrat Joe Biden beat Trump to win the presidency.\", \"The news came only days after Abrams launched her campaign last week.\", \"Perdue's campaign website went live late on Sunday evening, urging Georgia voters to \\\"join our team to stop Stacey Abrams.\\\"\", \"Please note, political betting in the United States is considered illegal, but it is legal in Europe and many other countries.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945916/david-perdue-stacey-abrams.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Former senator from Georgia David Perdue is due to face Democrat and former Georgia Congresswoman Stacey Abrams in the 2022 Georgia Gubernational election in November 2022. </div>\"]","href_hash":"e3e6980456b811ec895d3fa6f0de2295"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e3e6980456b811ec895d3fa6f0de2295"}},
