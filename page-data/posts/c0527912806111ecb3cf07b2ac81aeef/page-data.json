But in September, the city said it was moving forward with the design, prompting a legal challenge filed this month by critics who asked a judge to review the city\\u2019s approval process.\", \"\\u201cWe are frustrated,\\u201d said Jacob Morris, the historian who is challenging the decision by the Public Design Commission, which reviews all permanent monuments on city property. He said the agency violated its own rules when it declined to hear additional public testimony before voting for conceptual approval of the $689,000 project in a September meeting.\", \"\\u201cThis is our last resort,\\u201d Morris added\", \"For several years, Morris and others have worked to erect a figurative sculpture called \\u201cSisters in Freedom\\u201d in the same spot in Downtown Brooklyn. It would honor historically significant Black women like the investigative journalist Ida B. Wells and the educator and abolitionist Sarah J. Garnet.\", \"When he was Brooklyn borough president, New York City Mayor Eric Adams had supported the traditional monument that Morris would like to see built. In 2019, Adams wrote a letter to city officials saying that the artwork would \\u201celevate these great, empowered women further into our consciousness.\\u201d\", \"A spokeswoman for the mayor, Amaris Cockfield, did not respond to questions about where he stands on the decision to proceed with a more abstract effort at Abolitionist Place.\", \"City officials said that the plan to install the Rasheed work is not final as yet and announced that the artist began holding online community engagement sessions this week to hear thoughts about her design. In addition, the Public Design Commission said it would continue to review the design and seek public input.\", \"\\u201cWe plan to have another public hearing on this when it returns for preliminary review,\\u201d Keri Butler, executive director of the agency, said over email.\", \"One expert on the city\\u2019s public design approval process said she thought the legal challenge to the commission\\u2019s approval last fall faced an uphill fight.\", \"A legal challenge to get the monument back into a public hearing \\u201cseems a bit extreme,\\u201d said Michele H. Bogart, an art historian specializing in the city\\u2019s public works. \\u201cHe\\u2019s trying to force them to change the way they operate, to make room for more public comment.\\u201d\", \"Shawn\\u00e9 Lee, whose family has fought for preserving the neighborhood\\u2019s abolitionist history, supports the lawsuit. \\u201cI would like to see the Public Design Commission change their process and become more inclusive to the community,\\u201d she said. \\u201cArt is a form of expression, but are you allowing us to express our concerns?\\u201d\", \"The park in which the abolitionist artwork will be featured is being steered by the city\\u2019s economic development agency and the design has been approved by the Department of Cultural Affairs.\", \"Rasheed, a former public-school teacher whose text-based banners have adorned the Brooklyn Museum\\u2019s facade, has drafted a design that includes a free-standing sculpture, mosaic reliefs and messages of social justice spread across the park.\", \"Kendal Henry, assistant commissioner for public art with the city\\u2019s cultural affairs department, characterized the artist\\u2019s vision as \\u201cdeeply rooted in collaboration.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe welcome the input of everyone with a good-faith interest in working with their neighbors to create a monument,\\u201d Henry added in a statement.\", \"Earlier this week, Rasheed, in one of her online sessions, engaged with the public and explained that community input would determine many core elements of her installation, like the texts. \\u201cWe can only do this if we can respect each other,\\u201d she said.\", \"She later sent The New York Times a statement in which she said: \\u201cI want to be mindful of creating something that invites conversation, rather than stating historical facts.\\u201d\", \"She said Morris and others were misrepresenting her work.\", \"The questions and texts that will be used in the work \\u201care designed to elicit discussion,\\u201d Rasheed said. \\u201cAnd I am excited that this project is not and will never be the only project addressing abolition in Brooklyn.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c0527912806111ecb3cf07b2ac81aeef"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c0527912806111ecb3cf07b2ac81aeef"}},
