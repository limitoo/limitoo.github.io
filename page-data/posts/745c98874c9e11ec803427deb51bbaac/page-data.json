Hsu told the Associated Press that he was effectively held hostage by Chinese authorities.\", \"The Chinese authorities were seeking to convince Hsu's father, a former chairman of a government real estate company who allegedly embezzled $63,000 to return to China and face justice. Hsu's father has said he is innocent and is a target of a political vendetta.\", \"Despite the family background, Hsu appeared to be a bargaining chip between the United States and China. Earlier this month, Hsu was told he was going home. He would return safely to Seattle, and seven Chinese nationals who were convicted of crimes in the U.S. would be released from prison and sent back to China.\", \"According to a U.S. official who was knowledgeable about the administration's talks with Beijing about Hsu told the AP that Hsu was not a \\\"deliverable\\\", and what looked like a prisoner exchange to some was not actually a prisoner exchange, but rather a product of long and continuing efforts to get Beijing to live up to international obligations.\", \"\\\"The PRC should never have subjected U.S. citizens to coercive exit bans. The PRC had been failing to meet its international obligations to take back their nationals who have been ordered removed,\\\" the official said, using the acronym for the People's Republic of China. \\\"There are additional Americans subject to exit bans and arbitrary detentions in the PRC, and we will continue to work to secure their release.\\\"\", \"\\\"I'm tired. Just tired,\\\" Hsu said. \\\"I haven't seen my parents for four years. I haven't seen my wife for a year and a half. We have a lot of things to talk about.\\\"\", \"These trades are not uncommon between China and other countries; Canada, Australia and a number of European countries have also said their citizens have faced arbitrary detention in China.\", \"\\\"There's no deterrent imposed on Beijing to doing it again,\\\" said Sophie Richardson, China Director at Human Rights Watch. \\\"The problem is if you took the truly principled road, a lot of people would still be sitting in arbitrary detention in China.\\\"\", \"Despite the challenges, Hsu said he is grateful to everyone who worked behind the scenes to bring him home. He said he is happy to be in a free country but thinks often about his relatives. \\\"I hope all is well with my family in China,\\\" he said.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938910/daniel-hsu.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Daniel Hsu, a U.S. citizen, is finally back in his home of Seattle after fighting to escape China for four years. U.S. citizen Daniel Hsu poses for a portrait in the apartment in Shanghai, China, April 13, 2020. </div>\", \"From August 2017 until February 2018, Hsu was held in solitary confinement in Hefei, the capital of Anhui province. The walls in his beige room were covered in rubber, Hsu told the AP in a 2020 interview. The table was wrapped in soft, gray leather. White blinds covered two barred windows. There were no sharp edges.\", \"Five surveillance cameras recorded his movements, and two guards kept constant, silent watch. They followed Hsu to the shower and stood beside him at the toilet.\", \"Lights blazed through the night. If he rolled over on his mattress, guards woke him and made him turn his face toward a surveillance camera that recorded him as he slept.\", \"When he was released from the so-called education center, he was subject to an exit ban and barred from leaving China. Under Chinese law, authorities have broad discretion to block both Chinese citizens and foreign nationals from leaving the country. The U.S., Canada, Australia and the U.K. have issued advisories warning their citizens they can be prevented from leaving China arbitrarily, even over disputes they may not be directly involved in.\", \"Hsu's is not the first case of hostage diplomacy involving China.\", \"In September, an agreement was reached to allow Meng Wanzhou, a senior executive at Chinese technology giant Huawei, to return home from Canada after a three-year diplomatic standoff. Meng had faced a U.S. extradition request on charges of fraud for allegedly misrepresenting the company's business dealings with Iran.\", \"Within hours of Meng's release, Beijing freed two Canadians who had been detained in China on national security charges shortly after Meng's arrest in Canada. China's Foreign Ministry said at the time the Canadians were released for health reasons and downplayed any connection with Meng's case. Canada has long maintained that the men are innocent.\", \"The next day, two American siblings who, like Hsu, had been blocked from leaving China for years in an apparent effort to coerce their father to return to China, returned to the United States.\", \"Hsu's luck didn't change until the weeks leading up to the November video conference. Hsu said he got a call from the U.S. Embassy in Beijing four days before Xi and Biden spoke, on the afternoon of November 11. He was instructed to get to Guangzhou, a southern Chinese megacity about 900 miles from his apartment in Shanghai, in time for a charter flight home early that Sunday morning.\", \"He went to see his 103-year-old grandmother, who lives in Shanghai. She cried when he told her he was leaving. \\\"I could tell she was wondering if she'd see me again,\\\" he said.\", \"Hsu had never told her about his exit ban because he worried for her health. He never told her about his six months in solitary confinement. Or the fact that his wife, also innocent of any crime, had also been blocked from leaving China until last year for reasons that were never clear to them. As a consequence, their teenage daughter was effectively orphaned for nearly three years, living on her own in their big, empty house in Seattle.\", \"November 14 dawned in Guangzhou with a rare and glorious blue sky, and the sunshine seemed to match Hsu's mood. At the airport, he walked across the tarmac toward a waiting Gulfstream 5 jet \\u2013 the plane that would finally carry him home.\", \"Hsu said he saw seven people disembark, though he didn't know who they were.\", \"Only one of them--Xu Guojun, a former Chinese bank executive, now bald and wearing baggy camouflage pants--was in handcuffs. A pair of police clad in hooded white hazmat suits, with goggles, facemasks, blue gloves and blue booties escorted him off the plane.\", \"Xu had fled China in 2001 after being accused of embezzling hundreds of millions of dollars. China's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection put out a statement trumpeting Xu's return to the motherland as a \\\"major achievement\\\" in China's global anti-corruption fight, which has intensified under Xi Jinping. A federal court in Las Vegas sentenced the former Bank of China manager on conspiracy charges in 2009 and ordered him and his co-conspirators to pay $482 million in restitution. He spent nearly 13 years in U.S. prison, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\", \"Two of the other returnees, Zhang Yujing and Lu Jing, tried to enter Mar-a-Lago in 2019. Zhang was sentenced to eight months for trespassing and lying to federal agents, while Lu was sentenced to 59 days for resisting arrest, according to DHS.\", \"Two others, Wang Yuhao and Zhang Jielun, were convicted of illegally photographing a naval air station in Key West, Florida, in 2020.\", \"The final pair, Sun Yong and Tang Junliang, had been convicted of financial crimes in Utah, according to DHS and Justice Department records.\", \"And then it was Hsu's turn. He walked up ten boarding stairs onto the plane. He had a single suitcase and one carry-on.\", \"\\\"I felt like I was already on U.S. soil. That was really a relief,\\\" Hsu said. \\\"I took a deep breath when I sat down in my chair.\\\"\", \"He said he spent the six-hour flight from Guangzhou to Guam reading \\\"Dune\\\" in Mandarin, playing video games and chatting with a half dozen Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers also on the plane. Then there was a three-hour layover in Guam and a seven-hour flight to Honolulu. He said he spent the 24-hour layover in Hawaii sleeping in his hotel room, then it was back on the jet for a five-and-a-half-hour flight to Phoenix.\", \"In Phoenix, he switched to a commercial flight, which was delayed by nearly three hours. As Biden and Xi spoke of Taiwan, trade, climate change and the mutual need to avoid conflict, Hsu paced the Phoenix airport, exhausted and aimless. \\\"I tried to read a book or read something on my phone, I just can't,\\\" Hsu said. \\\"I couldn't focus on anything. I couldn't wait to see my wife.\\\"\", \"Finally, at nearly 10 p.m. local time, Hsu touched down at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. A representative from the Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs was waiting for him. So was his wife, Jodie Chen.\", \"\\\"I just held her and gave her a hug,\\\" Hsu said. \\\"A very big one, very tight.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938939/daniel-hsu-shanghai-apartment.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">U.S. citizen Daniel Hsu poses for a portrait near his apartment in Shanghai, China, April 13, 2020.
