The tables were crowded with empty bottles, dirty plates were stacked up and the bathroom had run out of soap.\", \"In the corner, the bar\\u2019s owner, Marco Ant\\u00f4nio Targino, was eating a plate of fried pork cracklings. \\u201cFor those who like filth,\\u201d he said with a smile, \\u201cthis here is a beauty.\\u201d\", \"Out front, the cobblestone alley was packed with unmasked revelers, swaying and singing around a makeshift samba band. It was the biggest crowd since the start of the pandemic, and Mr. Targino was soaking it all in.\", \"\\u201cIt feels like I\\u2019m alive again,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t die.\\u201d\", \"Neither did his bar. The pandemic lockdowns and lost sales nearly killed the place, and the hundreds of drinking spots like it. But now, in one of the clearest signs that Rio de Janeiro is returning to something like normal, the city\\u2019s \\u201cdirty feet\\u201d are back.\", \"That\\u2019s the name for the hole-in-the-wall joints that spill out onto Rio\\u2019s sidewalks with plastic tables and chairs, offering cold beer and something fried at almost any hour of the day. Known as \\u201cp\\u00e9 sujo\\u201d in Portuguese, a dirty foot is a cross between a dive bar and a greasy spoon, where the grit and grime are part of the charm. The countertops are rusty, the prices cut-rate, and shoes and shirts often optional.\", \"\\u201cThe big restaurants don\\u2019t let you smoke. Here you can smoke almost anything,\\u201d said Sandro Lima Rodrigues, a bald, goateed server at La Paris, a dirty foot where a breakfast of espresso and grilled bread smeared with processed cheese costs 90 cents.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re the essence of Rio,\\u201d he added.\", \"Yes, Rio de Janeiro has golden beaches, breathtaking views and its colorful Carnival, but many Cariocas, as its residents are known, agree that to discover their city\\u2019s spirit, you need to experience a dirty foot.\", \"\\u201cRio is not a democratic place,\\u201d said Marcelo Freixo, a history professor who now represents Rio in Brazil\\u2019s Congress. \\u201cBut you can escape that inequality in a few places: the sambas, the beaches and the dive bars.\\u201d\", \"The pandemic forced a quarter of Rio\\u2019s restaurants and bars to close, according to a local trade group, and the city just set new rules restricting the unvaccinated from entering bars amid concerns over the Omicron variant. Yet, in a relief to many Cariocas, most of the dirty feet are still going strong.\", \"Fernando Blower, a Rio bar owner who runs the trade group, attributed their resilience to the fact that many are family-run operations that got creative.\", \"The Blowfish\\u2019s Den, or Toca do Baiac\\u00fa, sold art donated by a well-known cartoonist who regularly drinks at the bar. La Paris opened when the police weren\\u2019t watching and sold takeout beer when they were. Confectionary and Bar Solange (that\\u2019s one bar, and no, it doesn\\u2019t make candy) hand-delivered plates of beef ribs and liver to its neighborhood regulars. All three kept paying their employees through the lockdowns, even without government assistance.\", \"The Senate Warehouse, or Armaz\\u00e9m Senado, sold toothpaste, toilet paper and bleach. The two brothers who own the place took out a roughly $5,000 loan and then restarted their samba nights at a time when the city still restricted gatherings. (Their decision made headlines when the mayor showed up \\u2014 and was photographed singing without a mask. He paid a fine.)\", \"Mr. Targino, 64, first began drinking at what would become the Blowfish\\u2019s Den in the 1980s after days working as a banker nearby. Over cheap beer and cacha\\u00e7a, he befriended the other regulars, including a local boat mechanic.\", \"In 2007, the bar went up for sale. Worried it would turn into another gentrified restaurant, he bought it and renamed the place after a longtime waiter who he said resembled a blowfish. He sketched a new logo on cigarette papers: an overweight, beer-drinking fish.\", \"\\u201cIt was really filthy,\\u201d Mr. Targino said. \\u201cDeplorable. A latrine.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cNow it\\u2019s just a mess,\\u201d he said.\", \"To clean up the place, Mr. Targino hired the boat mechanic, Geraldo Serrador. Now the bar\\u2019s janitor and handyman, he did not appreciate his boss\\u2019s description of its hygiene.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m worried right now there\\u2019s a dirty glass in the kitchen,\\u201d Mr. Serrador, 61, shouted over a samba band.\", \"Dirty feet are close siblings of other types of casual bars, the boteco and botequim, which started as corner stores and derive their name from \\u201cbodega.\\u201d\", \"The origins of the term \\u201cdirty foot\\u201d aren\\u2019t so clear. Some bar owners attribute it to poor clientele who wore only sandals or lacked shoes. Others said it was because customers used to spit on the floors, which the bars would clean with sawdust.\", \"\\u201cYou came out of there with your feet dirty,\\u201d said Paulo Mussoi, a Rio journalist who has written a column about dirty feet for more than 20 years.\", \"For decades, the bars were mostly for working-class men. Many even lacked women\\u2019s bathrooms. But in the 1990s, Rio\\u2019s middle class discovered dirty feet and boteco, and they quickly became fashionable, celebrated as hidden culinary gems.\", \"The food in dirty feet bars shows influences from Portugal, West Africa and Brazil\\u2019s Northeast. There are fried sardines, pickled eggs, gizzards and stews made from cow\\u2019s feet and oxtail. The bars have inspired imitators that mimic their low-key style but with higher prices. Cariocas call them \\u201cclean feet.\\u201d (It\\u2019s an insult.)\", \"Your average dirty foot is a neighborhood hangout that reflects the rhythms of Rio life. Take Confectionary and Bar Solange, in a residential section of Rio\\u2019s middle-class Gloria neighborhood, south of downtown.\", \"Pel\\u00e9 Joensson, 57, a Swedish immigrant, said he arrives most days around 6 a.m. to buy coffee and carry one of the bar\\u2019s plastic chairs across the street to watch his neighborhood wake up. He then spends hours socializing.\", \"\\u201cIf you live alone, this is where you have your social life,\\u201d he said.\", \"By late morning, a waiter and cook known to everyone as \\u201cToninho,\\u201d or Little Tony, put out fresh pork stew ($3 a plate.) Three construction workers on break leaned against the other end of the bar, sipping soda. Hours later, neighbors celebrated a local doorman\\u2019s birthday with cake and a raffle for frozen cod.\", \"By nightfall, the scene got louder. Customers pulled the flimsy plastic chairs from a stack by the door and added them to widening circles of friends. Each group shared one 20-ounce bottle of beer ($1.40) at a time, split into small glasses. The approach is designed to keep anyone from drinking warm beer, sacrilege in Brazil. The bottles sit in snug coolers known as \\u201clittle shirts,\\u201d which, in Portuguese, is slang for a condom.\", \"One particularly boisterous group included a taxi driver, a real estate agent, one of the first transgender executives at Unilever, and a retired salesman in leather pants.\", \"\\u201cWhat makes a dirty foot?\\u201d asked the real estate agent, Luiz Felipe Cavalcante. \\u201cBeer, food, people, friendship, soccer. Oh, and women, women!\\u201d\", \"Aparecida Ara\\u00fajo, a cement saleswoman, chimed in with another missing ingredient: \\u201cDrunks talking nonsense.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Targino, the Blowfish\\u2019s Den owner, said that what defines a dirty foot is not its food or drinks, but its laid-back ethos.\", \"\\u201cIf you take a pig, bring it into your house, bathe it, put a bow around its neck and leave it in your backyard, what\\u2019s it going to do? It\\u2019ll throw itself in the mud and get dirty all over again,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI want to go where I feel good, have my shirt open and wear flip flops. That\\u2019s where I\\u2019m in my natural habitat, just like that healthy little pig.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ecc1b00c548911ec9f18057e46f69c02"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ecc1b00c548911ec9f18057e46f69c02"}},
