The idea came earlier this year when she noticed the six Abbott World Marathon Majors, which typically take place throughout the year, would all be held within a two-month span due to postponements caused by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.\", \"Flanagan's initial goal was to run all six races in Berlin, London, Tokyo, Chicago, Boston and New York. When the 2021 Tokyo Marathon was postponed to early March of next year, Flanagan decided to use a substitute course in Portland, which she used for training throughout her professional career.\", \"In her Instagram post announcing the challenge, Flanagan described it as a \\\"total running eclipse that will never happen again in my lifetime.\\\" But she acknowledged reaching the goal would be difficult.\", \"\\\"This goal is hard. But I need it to be,\\\" she wrote. \\\"It's what makes me feel most alive.\\\"\", \"Flanagan tackled her first Project Eclipse marathon in Berlin on September 26 and ran her second in London one week later. Two back-to-back marathons came the following week\\u2014with the Chicago Marathon on October 10 and the Boston Marathon on October 11\\u2014and she completed her fifth in Portland the following week.\", \"Flanagan has completed each of the five marathons so far in under 3 hours, which was another element of the goal she outlined during a September conversation with Self.\", \"In the days before the race in New York, Flanagan posted photos and videos on social media that showed her exploring the city and visiting the course.\", \"\\\"Honestly, I had no idea that this project would be as magical as it has been. This is the most fun that I've ever had running,\\\" Flanagan wrote in an October 28 Instagram post. \\\"When I cross the finish line in NYC, elated and exhausted, I already know I will wish that I could do this all over again.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"1a3c7cba41f711ec837d000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1a3c7cba41f711ec837d000017025a03"}},
