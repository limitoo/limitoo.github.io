Researchers noted reactionary jumps in derogatory stories about the United States, NATO and its allies on December 7, following the video conference between President Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin, then again on January 10 at the start of negotiations in Geneva, Switzerland.\", \"Recently, Moscow's online armies have spun out wild tales of disinformation accusing the U.S. of hiring mercenaries to carry out a chemical attack plot and revisiting false narratives aligning Ukrainians with Nazism.\", \"\\\"Disinformation is a significant threat,\\\" deputy national security adviser Anne Neuberger told reporters Wednesday, during her diplomatic mission to Brussels. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"The disinformation narrative is that Ukraine is the source of the crisis. That is not the case \\u2014 Russia is the source of the crisis,\\\" Neuberger stressed.\", \"Russia is also perpetuating the lie that there are \\\"significant NATO forces in Ukraine, significant threats in Ukraine to Russia, Neuberger added. \\\"That is not the case.\\\" She reiterated that Russia has amassed over 100,000 troops at Ukraine's border.\", \"Propaganda is flooding Telegram channels, according to the Ukrainian Crisis Media Center, a non-governmental organization backed by supporters of Ukraine's sovereignty.\\u00a0 The group took note of one recently hatched claim that Ukraine and NATO are plotting an undercover operation code named \\\"Crushing Sword.\\\" That story, initially posted on the telegram account of Yan Leshchenko, self-proclaimed military leader of the so-called Luhansk People's Republic, and circulated by Russian state media, uses bogus footage of Ukrainian aggression as a pretext for Russian military deployment.\", \"While many messages are posted anonymously, others on Telegram connect to pro-Russian Ukrainian politicians such as Yevheniy Muraiev, the owner of \\\"NASH\\\" TV channel and one of Moscow's chosen candidates for pro-Russian leadership, according to recent British intelligence reports concluding Putin plans to install a puppet government in Kyiv.\", \"The White House dispatched its top cybersecurity official to NATO, Tuesday, to organize its mission to detect and deflect Russian cyberattacks \\u2013 both against Ukraine, as well as possible retaliatory cyberattacks against Europe and the U.S. Neuberger equated Russia's use of cyber with \\\"a kind of kinetic operations\\\" intended to destabilize a target population and government. \\\"The goal of Russian disinformation is to\\u2026 shake confidence in a country's government or to make it difficult to assess a situation.\\\"\", \"Cyber criminals attempted to \\\"shake confidence\\\" in Ukraine last month, targeting more than 90 websites linked to 22 Ukrainian government organizations on January 14 in a three-pronged operation intent on driving Russia's state-sponsored story, according to top Ukrainian cyber official Victor Zhora.\", \"Approximately 50 websites were defaced with a \\\"much smaller number of organizations and IT infrastructures\\\" suffering damage. \\\"Some external IT infrastructures were destroyed,\\\" the deputy chairman of the State Service of Special Communications and Information Protection of Ukraine told CBS News.\", \"Hackers successfully employed specially designed \\\"wiper malware\\\" on two of Ukraine's government agencies, but there is no indication that personal information has been compromised.\", \"And while the Ukrainian government has yet to formally attribute the attacks to Moscow, the investigation points to familiar Russian tactics.\", \"\\\"It's a part of hybrid warfare against Ukraine.

It's a good lesson for all of us. It's one more hit in a series of cyber attacks, but we showed that our security cyber security system is working.\\\"\", \"The State Department\\u00a0issued a fact sheet\\u00a0last month, highlighting five themes Russia has been trying to refine and peddle in its disinformation campaign to rationalize its own actions in Ukraine. For one, there's \\\"Russophobia\\\" \\u2014\\u00a0 falsely portraying Russia as an 'innocent victim' of U.S. aggression, downplaying the Soviet's alliance with Hitler during WWII and portraying the collapse of Western societies as \\\"imminent.\\\"\", \"\\\"Disinformation has been part of Russian military doctrine for more than a decade,\\\" said James Lewis, a researcher and tech expert at CSIS. \\\"The one thing Russians have learned is if you tell a falsehood often enough, there'll be people who believe it.\\\"\", \"Lewis says that lesson learned was reinforced back in 2016, when Kremlin-backed trolls revamped their 'classic playbook' with an online disinformation campaign designed to sow doubt about the presidential election. The result culminated in a massive network of fake social media accounts or 'bots' programmed to spread divisive political content across the internet that would further exacerbate existing rifts in American society. But Russian meddling in U.S. elections \\u2014 surfacing again for a bite in 2020 \\u2014 offered up its share of hard-earned lessons to U.S. officials, too.\", \"Experts tracking Kremlin-backed information warfare have welcomed the administration's approach to combating Russia's disinformation campaign, along with efforts by social media companies to curb fake news at its source.\", \"\\\"One thing that's improved in recent years is that the social media companies have gone from saying, 'Oh, we're just, we're just a bulletin board\\u2026.' to making a much more aggressive effort to weed out fake information,\\\" Lewis said. \\\"The Russians create hundreds of bogus individuals, using artificial intelligence to tweet out nonsense. But there's a much stronger effort to expose that.\\\"\", \"Margaret Brennan and Olivia Gazis contributed to this report.\", \"CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.\"]","href_hash":"759ed11a852311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"759ed11a852311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
