She said the payments have increased to more than $1 billion since September. They were told they needed to collect the overpayments, despite staffers currently working through a backlog of benefit applications.\", \"Last September, the commission's vacancy rate increased to 46 percent, a stark contrast to the 13 percent to 25 percent of full-time staff vacancy rate between 2015 and 2019. Granting exemptions from typical hiring processes and using emergency assistance were some suggestions the report gave to the VEC to alleviate the problem.\", \"Forty specific recommendations were given to the commission for improvement as part of the 200-page report. The agency's information technology system will go offline at 5 p.m. Monday to implement a new one. Customers will not be able to call the VEC during that time.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928528/vec.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">More than a year and a half into the coronavirus pandemic, the Virginia Employment Commission is still swamped with backlogged claims, its call centers are underperforming and serious staffing problems persist, according to a scathing interim report the state's legislative watchdog agency presented to lawmakers on Monday.
