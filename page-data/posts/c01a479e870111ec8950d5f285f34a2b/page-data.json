Michael Scott's confession came first. He was questioned over four days:\", \"OFFICER (1999 interrogation): Come on Michael, you're doing good. Tell us. Let's do this today. Let's do it. \", \"MICHAEL SCOTT: I remember seeing girls. \\u2026 I remember one girl screaming, terrified. \", \"Scott told investigators that he and the others only intended a simple robbery.

Is that the gun you walked up behind somebody with and shot in the head?\\u00a0 \", \"Joe James Sawyer: I frankly couldn't believe it. \\u2026 They terrorized him. And he was afraid to say no.\", \"Forrest Welborn denied having anything to do with the murders, but police were convinced he was the lookout that night and Michael Scott placed him at the scene.

He, like the others, first came on police radar when, in 1991, just days after the murders, Maurice Pierce had been caught with that .22 caliber gun at the mall near the yogurt shop. Pierce told the detectives back then that he had given the handgun to Welborn and that it had been used in the yogurt shop murders.\", \"Erin Moriarty: Why would he say that? \", \"Forrest Welborn: I don't know.\", \"Welborn has always maintained his innocence despite pressure from the police.\", \"Forrest Welborn: They would get right in my face and, you know, tell me everything I said was a lie. \", \"Remember, false confessions in this case were nothing new. Jones said that six written false confessions were obtained when he was in charge. So, when he learned that the two confessions were all the new investigators seemed to have, it gave him pause.\", \"John Jones: I go, well, maybe I shouldn't get that shirt out just yet.\", \"It wasn't long before the case against the men began crumbling. Charges against Forrest Welborn were dismissed after two grand juries failed to indict him. And later on, charges were dropped against Maurice Pierce for lack of evidence. Everything fell apart except the cases against Michael Scott and Robert Springsteen. And with Scott and Springsteen's confessions, the victims' families felt prosecutors had a strong case.\", \"Barbara Ayres-Wilson (outside courthouse, 2010): These young men have been implicated and they have confessed. And they can withdraw it, but the truth is, they actually were there, and they actually did the murders.\", \"In 2001, nearly 10 years after the murders of Eliza Thomas, Amy Ayers and Sarah and Jennifer Harbison, the yogurt shop murder trials began. Both defendants \\u2014 Robert Springsteen and Michael Scott \\u2014 faced the death penalty.\", \"Joe James Sawyer: The only thing that ever tied Robert or Mike Scott to that crime scene were their confessions.\", \"Confessions that both defendants said were coerced. The two were tried separately. Springsteen's trial was first. Neither of the men would testify against one another. So instead, prosecutors used their confessions against one another, reading parts of the confessions to the juries. Springsteen's lawyer, Joe James Sawyer, was frustrated that he couldn't cross-examine Scott.\\u00a0\", \"Joe James Sawyer: I thought the trial was massively unfair to my client and that it was being done systematically and with deliberation.\", \"The trial lasted three weeks. The jury deliberated for 13 hours and then, reached a verdict.\", \"JURY FOREPERSON: We the jury find the defendant Robert Springsteen IV guilty of the offense of capital murder \\u2026\", \"Guilty. Springsteen was condemned to death row. \", \"In 2002, Michael Scott went on trial. He was convicted as well. He was sentenced to life in prison. But the case didn't end there. Fifteen years after the murders, came a shocking turn of events.\", \"NEWS REPORT: In a 5-4 decision, the court behind me said that Michael Scott's constitutional rights were violated during his trial and therefore should get a new one. \", \"Both Scott and Springsteen's convictions were overturned on constitutional grounds. The Sixth Amendment gives defendants the right to confront accusers \\u2014 and remember, in Scott and Springsteen's trials, their confessions were used against one another, but they weren't allowed to question each other in court.\\u00a0\", \"Joe James Sawyer: And the relief \\u2026 the relief was incredible. \", \"But that relief for the defendants came as a devastating blow to the victims' families.

Our girls were murdered.\", \"Sonora Thomas: It ruins your sense of fairness. It ruins your sense of \\u2014 that we live in a just world. \", \"Even though their convictions were overturned, Scott and Springsteen were not released. A new district attorney, Rosemary Lehmberg, was determined to retry them. In an effort to find more evidence, her office had ordered DNA tests on vaginal swabs taken from the victims at the time of the murders. It's called Y-STR testing \\u2014 and was fairly new in 2009 when \\\"48 Hours\\\" spoke with D.A. Lehmberg.\", \"Rosemary Lehmberg: This technology searches for male DNA only \", \"A partial male DNA profile was obtained from one of the victims believed to have been sexually assaulted. And no one expected what it would reveal.\", \"Erin Moriarty: Does that DNA match any of the four young men who were originally accused and two of them who've been convicted?\", \"Rosemary Lehmberg: It does not.\", \"The DNA did not match any of the original four suspects, including Scott and Springsteen.\\u00a0 And that's significant because Springsteen, in that confession he said was coerced, told investigators he raped one the girls.\", \"CeCe Moore is a DNA expert and genetic genealogist whom we asked about the case and the role of Y-STR DNA in criminal cases.\", \"CeCe Moore: It is a tool that can eliminate almost everyone \\u2026 It should eliminate everybody but the suspect.\", \"Erin Moriarty: If their Y-STR does not match, they did not contribute that DNA?\", \"CeCe Moore: Because of \\u2026 where that DNA was found, yes, in this case, it's very important. \", \"The district attorney was focused on finding the source of that DNA \\u2014 she wondered if Springsteen and Scott had another partner.\", \"Rosemary Lehmberg: I remain really confident that \\u2026 both Springsteen and Scott were responsible for killing those four girls.\", \"But in 2009, with no matches on that DNA, Lehmberg dropped charges against Springsteen and Scott. After nearly 10 years behind bars, they were released \\u2014 but not exonerated, leaving open the possibility they could be retried at a later time.\", \"ROSEMARY LEHMBERG (at press conference): This was a difficult decision and one I'd rather not have to make. \", \"The question remained though: whose DNA was it?\", \"Amber Farrelly: I know who it is.\", \"Joe James Sawyer: The killer's.\", \"Erin Moriarty: You're convinced that that \\u2014\", \"Amber Farrelly: That is a certain truth. \", \"Amber Farrelly was part of both Scott and Springsteen's defense teams.
