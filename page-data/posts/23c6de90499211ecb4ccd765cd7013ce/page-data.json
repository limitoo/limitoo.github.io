So did Andrea Sestini Hlavackova, the retired Czech star with whom Peng reached the Australian Open final in 2017.\", \"\\u201cWe played many tennis battles together and spent half a year together on tour,\\u201d Hlavackova said in an Instagram post. \\u201cNow my wishes are for her to be OK and sending her strength if she is not.\\u201d\", \"It is a message and a campaign that has quickly expanded beyond the confines of the sport. Only a few days ago, Peng was a prominent figure in her home country but hardly a household name beyond.\", \"But the intrigue surrounding the lack of direct contact with Peng has made waves and headlines around the world in the wake of her explosive if unsubstantiated allegations against Zhang Gaoli, a former Chinese vice premier. On Friday, the United Nations and the United States government were also asking for answers. \\u201cWe join in the calls for P.R.C. authorities to provide independent and verifiable proof of her whereabouts and that she is safe,\\u201d said White House spokesperson Jen Psaki, referring to the People\\u2019s Republic of China.\", \"Psaki said she did not have details about the case but that women around the world should be able to speak out about sexual assault and seek accountability. \\u201cWe will continue to stand up for the freedom of speech, and we know the P.R.C. has zero tolerance for criticism and a record of silencing those that speak out and we continue to condemn those practices,\\u201d she added.\", \"As support and concern for Peng continue to build, it is unclear what her situation means for tennis. But it is clear what it could signify: an abrupt and major change in the game\\u2019s business model and growth strategy.\", \"Tennis officials have been focused on the Chinese market for decades. One of the many reasons they pushed successfully for the sport to return to the Olympics \\u2014 it became a full medal sport again in 1988 \\u2014 was to help build tennis in China, where Olympic sports were given priority by the government.\", \"The men\\u2019s tennis tour was the first to bring one of the sport\\u2019s biggest events to the country, awarding its year-end championships, then known as the Tennis Masters Cup, to Shanghai in 2002 and bringing it back from 2005 to 2008.\", \"But it is the women\\u2019s tour that has made the biggest commitment to the country, increasing its stake significantly in the years after Li Na became China\\u2019s first Grand Slam singles champion at the 2011 French Open and then followed up by winning the 2014 Australian Open. The tour eventually approved the move of a tournament from Tokyo to Li\\u2019s home city of Wuhan and, most significantly, awarded its year-end championships, the WTA finals, to Shenzhen in 2019 in exchange for doubling the event\\u2019s prize money to $14 million and committing to a new arena.\", \"Steve Simon, an American who is the chairman and chief executive of the WTA Tour, shepherded that decision even if some in the higher echelons of the sport viewed it as a money grab rather than an attempt to find the ideal spot for big crowds and big buzz.\", \"But Simon argued that Shenzhen and the rapidly growing Pearl River Delta region was a potential hotbed for the sport and that the size of the 10-year agreement gave the WTA stability and flexibility.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a huge opportunity for us,\\u201d Simon told The New York Times in January 2018. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to allow us to do some things as a tour and invest with a long-term vision and planning, and we haven\\u2019t had that opportunity before.\\u201d\", \"Nearly four years later, so much has changed. The coronavirus pandemic shut down the sport for five months in 2020, and China has canceled every tournament scheduled in the country since the tours resumed. At the same time, political tensions have continued to rise between China and the parts of the world where tennis has long been strongest: the United States, Europe and Australia.\", \"Even without Peng, this was going to be a challenging landscape for tennis to navigate, but the Peng situation appears to have underscored the cultural divide and potentially accelerated the exit strategy.\", \"There has never been a case like this in China: a prominent athlete making such significant allegations against one of the country\\u2019s major political figures. Though Simon received an email from Peng this week, Simon has cast doubt on its authenticity and insisted that the tour wants verifiable proof that Peng is safe. He has said that no one in the tennis community has been able to contact her directly.\", \"Simon has called for a full investigation into Peng\\u2019s allegations of sexual assault, an inquiry free of censorship. That could prove even trickier to achieve in a country unlikely to embrace outside demands on how it conducts its internal affairs.\", \"The International Olympic Committee, with even more at stake as it prepares to take the Winter Olympics to Beijing in February, has argued for tact and behind-the-scenes diplomacy rather than direct confrontation. But Simon and the WTA have decided, after careful and lengthy consideration, to make a stand and have doubled down \\u2014 insisting that if Chinese authorities do not comply, the tour would be prepared to pull out of China, where it had 11 events on the schedule this year.\", \"The men\\u2019s tour, which has four events of its own in China, has offered plenty of support for Peng but, as of yet, no such ultimatum. Simon, with even more at risk commercially, has taken a much bolder path, believing that raising the temperature and raising global awareness of Peng\\u2019s situation was necessary.\", \"\\u201cWhen you\\u2019re talking about allegations such as this and sexual assault, when a woman has the courage to come up and reflect these and state it, you have to have the courage to then follow up and go through the right process and get to the right solution at the end of the day,\\u201d Simon said in an interview on Sunday. \\u201cYou cannot water down or compromise this type of an issue.\\u201d\", \"Peng has had to be strong before, overcoming numerous injuries, adversity and isolation. . She had a procedure to repair a heart defect not long before leaving home at age 14: sent by Chinese officials to train at the Evert Tennis Academy in Boca Raton, Fla.\", \"\\u201cShe didn\\u2019t speak any English, and she was with us for two years,\\u201d Chris Evert said on Friday. \\u201cShe was painfully shy, and most of our coaching was with sign language. I remember we were always trying to make her laugh. She was intense on the court. It was hard for her to fit in with the language barrier, and I sensed a real loneliness.\\u201d\", \"But her talent was clear. With exquisite timing, big baseline power and double-fisted groundstrokes, often sharply angled, that were reminiscent of Monica Seles, Peng was viewed as a potential champion in China even before Li broke through.\", \"Peng was also part of a group of Chinese women\\u2019s players who were successful in convincing the Chinese Tennis Federation to allow them more freedom of choice in their own careers and to be able to keep a much greater share of their own prize money.\", \"Peng had not matched Li\\u2019s singles achievements, peaking at No. 14 in the rankings in 2011, but she did reach the No. 1 ranking in doubles in 2014 after winning Wimbledon the previous year with Taiwanese partner Hsieh Su-wei.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019s just so good,\\u201d said McHale, who won the Tianjin Open with Peng in 2016. \\u201cI loved playing with her. I didn\\u2019t have to do that much. She always seemed to know where to be on the court.\\u201d\", \"But after a resurgence in 2016 and 2017, Peng\\u2019s career has dipped and in August 2018, she received a six-month ban from the tour, three months of it suspended, after an investigation by the Tennis Integrity Unit confirmed that she had offered a financial incentive to Alison Van Uytvanck to withdraw as her doubles partner after the sign-in deadline so she could play with a different partner at Wimbledon in 2017 (Peng ended up not playing the tournament at all).\", \"She has not competed since early 2020 and appeared headed for a low-profile finish to her long career. How things have changed.\"]","href_hash":"23c6de90499211ecb4ccd765cd7013ce"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"23c6de90499211ecb4ccd765cd7013ce"}},
