Due to security concerns, Trudeau and his family left their downtown home last weekend and his location has not been disclosed.\", \"The prime minister has said the convoy represented a \\\"small fringe minority\\\" and the government would not be intimidated.

Last week, the party ditched its leader in part for not initially backing the blockade enthusiastically enough.\", \"- Reuters\"]","href_hash":"3bc0c06087a911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3bc0c06087a911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
