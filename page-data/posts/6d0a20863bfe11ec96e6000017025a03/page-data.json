Bell.\", \"With its underlying finances in better health, the company said it would reward shareholders with a $1.25 billion share-buyback program, which it said will be completed before it announces its full-year results.\", \"Analysts questioned whether that was a good use of money, especially as world leaders have gathered in the Scottish city of Glasgow for a U.N. climate summit known as COP26 where the focus is on how to reduce carbon emissions.\", \"\\\"Generosity in good times is all well and good, but that shouldn't come at the expense of long-term financial stability, particularly given the considerable spending on renewable and low-carbon projects that's likely over the coming years,\\\" said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown in London.\", \"For now, it's clear that the oil business can be extremely lucrative if the price backdrop is favorable. Like others in the sector, BP has benefited from rising oil and gas prices in recent months, compared with last year when they fell sharply following the onset of the pandemic.\"]","href_hash":"6d0a20863bfe11ec96e6000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6d0a20863bfe11ec96e6000017025a03"}},
