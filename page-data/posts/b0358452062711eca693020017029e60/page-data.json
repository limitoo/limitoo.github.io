Then he let the animals roam.\", \"The result was captured on video by a drone - it's gone viral after Mr Jackson shared it online.\", \"\\\"There was no way I could get up there and see her, say cheerio, or go to the funeral,\\\" he told the BBC.\", \"\\\"So I felt hopeless, helpless - I didn't really know what to do.

That was before Covid outbreaks forced new lockdowns in Australia.\", \"On Thursday, Mr Jackson was still under a state-wide lockdown, on his property in Guyra in rural New South Wales.\", \"But his sheep tribute was being played on Australian TV stations and widely shared on social media.\", \"His aunt would have enjoyed that, he said.\", \"\\\"She would be proud as punch to see so many people smiling and enjoying the heart I've made for her.
