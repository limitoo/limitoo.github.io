But these days, the company\\u2019s repertory has more to say about it or perhaps a different way of saying it, with a deeper urgency and radiance \\u2014 and dancing that seems to be crying for a kind of freedom. \\u201cRevelations,\\u201d Ailey\\u2019s 1960 classic, still closes many of the company\\u2019s programs, but does it have to? What if, as an experiment, the company started the show with \\u201cRevelations\\u201d? And what better time than now, when audiences are so grateful for live performance, to shake things up?\", \"The company\\u2019s repertory, which has improved during the tenure of the artistic director, Robert Battle, allows for more choices. Ailey didn\\u2019t open its season Wednesday at New York City Center with \\u201cLazarus,\\u201d by the hip-hop master Rennie Harris, but it should have. The opening was a gala affair on Wednesday, ending with, of course, \\u201cRevelations.\\u201d The sobering and gorgeous \\u201cLazarus,\\u201d on Thursday, was even more spellbinding as it explored the systemic oppression of Black people that began centuries ago and continues today.\", \"Has \\u201cLazarus\\u201d become more potent and raw? Is it more relevant given the dramatic events that have occurred \\u2014 the murder of George Floyd and the wave of uprisings in 2020 that demanded an end to police violence against people of color \\u2014 since its premiere in 2018? Yes and yes and more yes.\", \"Bearing witness to \\u201cLazarus\\u201d was more than experiencing another reunion of a dance company that had been put on hold by the pandemic. The company delivered a performance in which dance became something else: a release, somehow both stirring and settling. The dancers, with their blistering footwork, sliced up the stage. It\\u2019s a shame that because of pandemic-related safety issues, this season is shorter than usual: \\u201cLazarus\\u201d is scheduled for only one more performance, on Dec. 16.\", \"On Friday night, along with \\u201cRevelations\\u201d \\u2014 the crowd roared throughout, even though the performances weren\\u2019t as well-oiled as usual \\u2014 the company presented premieres by Battle and its resident choreographer, Jamar Roberts. Both pieces were released as digital works during the pandemic; this was their first time onstage with a live audience.\", \"Roberts\\u2019s \\u201cHolding Space,\\u201d named for the empathetic action of being present for another person, also refers to its architecture. The cast members, arranged in rows, perform in solitary squares. When Roberts was choreographing the work, there were safety protocols in place requiring dancers to be six feet away from one another. For the first part of \\u201cHolding Space,\\u201d this is evident: The tense opening movements comprise a web of arms and legs \\u2014 flinging, reaching, twisting \\u2014 within invisible walls.\", \"The discordant music, by Tim Hecker, along with Brandon Stirling Baker\\u2019s otherworldly lighting \\u2014 bright white, icy blue and, later, a golden amber \\u2014 creates a sci-fi feel as dancers escape their confinement to drift into solos. A cube appears; inside, the dancer Jacqueline Green stretches and contorts her long limbs with sculptural ease, as well as what seems to be a yearning to escape: With a flexed foot, she stretches a leg in front of her torso and arches back \\u2014 a test not only of her balance, but also of her daring and resolve.\", \"When Green exits the cube, others take her place, last of all Yannick Lebrun, who pushes against phantom forces, lurching his torso forward and back and opening his arms like wings. When he comes out of the structure, James Gilmer touches him on his back and takes over the dance; here, the lighting switches to amber and the music gives way to silence.\", \"For this solo \\u2014 an addition, and a good one, to the virtual version \\u2014 Gilmer, showing the flexibility in his strength, allows the movement to soften as it flows through his bones. His change of shirt indicates a transformation as well: Before, the dancers\\u2019 tops featured a structured edge between the shoulder and the sleeve. Now they\\u2019re soft, and the dancing follows suit \\u2014 no longer hard and angular, the choreography floats along now as a vehicle for tenderness and healing.\", \"Certainly, in look and in choreography, Roberts, also credited with scenic and costume design, has created something stylish. But is it lasting? \\u201cHolding Space\\u201d ends up in the category of a pandemic dance \\u2014 not only for its spatial arrangement, but for its themes of isolation, confinement and, ultimately, transformation. While it has beautiful moments \\u2014 Gilmer\\u2019s solo, especially \\u2014 it feels anchored to a period of time and its constrictions without being particularly revelatory as a work of art. Battle\\u2019s \\u201cFor Four,\\u201d a snazzy seven or so minutes set to music by Wynton Marsalis, is more surprising. It\\u2019s light and buoyant \\u2014 or so it seems.\", \"In it, the dancers \\u2014 Renaldo Maurice, Solomon Dumas, Bel\\u00e9n Indhira Pereyra and Samantha Figgins \\u2014 hit the musical notes with their bodies. They hit hard. Their wild energy, alluring at first, becomes frenetic, almost manic over time; are they having fun or are they desperate? Despite the dancers\\u2019 showbiz smiles, sequined overalls and clapping hands, \\u201cFor Four\\u201d has something ominous simmering beneath its surface.\", \"It\\u2019s a sprint to make it to the finish line: Dumas is electrifying, feverish, while Figgins is a vision of lithe fluidity. Pereyra's perpetual swirl of motion is only boosted by her whipping, bountiful hair \\u2014 never has hairography been so delightful. When, suddenly, an American flag is projected onto the back of the stage, Maurice, shirtless, collapses to the floor; the projection slides to the floor, too, where bits of red seem to spread over his skin like blood.\", \"When the final notes play and the dancers stand calmly at the back of the stage, each with a raised fist salute, Maurice rolls on the floor in the shape of an opened fan \\u2014 or a needle spinning on a record. \\u201cFor Four\\u201d isn\\u2019t just about the need to dance amid a pandemic: It\\u2019s a frantic fight for freedom of body and mind.\"]","href_hash":"adfba03c560811ecad79bf692bbe56d0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"adfba03c560811ecad79bf692bbe56d0"}},
