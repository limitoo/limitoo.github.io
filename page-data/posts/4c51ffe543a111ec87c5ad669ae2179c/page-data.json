He swipes it rhythmically up and down the wooden fencing and its building poster, a motion common to generations of graffitists and guerrilla wheat-paste-poster artists. Except that in place of a spray can or glue roller, his instrument is a lightweight VuPoint Magic Wand digital scanner, a cheap device about the size of an electric toothbrush, often used to digitize book pages and legal documents. And so instead of leaving art on the streets, Relph is slowly extracting it. Acting as a kind of human image-scraper, he has spent the past seven years amassing a vast archive of renderings of the buildings that form or will form the city\\u2019s sardine-can skyline, a once and future New York that feels mythical, mind-boggling, and often, frankly, terrifying.\", \"More than 100 of his digitally stitched-together streetscapes \\u2014 some of them graffiti-marked and squiggly, the results of urban chance and lo-fi methods \\u2014 have been gathered in a new book called \\u201cEclipse Body & Soul Syntax.\\u201d\", \"Taking up an unlikely position within the rich history of New York City street photography that stretches from Berenice Abbott and Ezra Stoller to Roy DeCarava and Camilo Jos\\u00e9 Vergara, Relph\\u2019s collection, published by Pre-Echo Press, might be described as the first post-internet expression of the genre. The images mostly show buildings that are, in one sense, real or in the process of becoming so. But the rendering posters, created by design firms and developers, are also highly fictive, cinematic branding documents created to comply with a city law requiring public images of buildings under construction.\", \"Taken together, they depict a wildly aspirational luxury metropolis that seems to have tipped over without warning into \\u201cBlade Runner\\u201d dystopia, a city agglomerating by algorithm, recalling a line from J.G. Ballard\\u2019s 1975 novel \\u201cHigh-Rise\\u201d: \\u201cThis was an environment built not for man, but for man\\u2019s absence.\\u201d\", \"Relph, 42, rose to prominence 20 years ago through videos and films he made with former London art-school classmate Oliver Payne that wove urban and suburban landscapes, experimental music and anomie into unclassifiable meditations on belonging and place. In a recent interview near his Brooklyn apartment, he said it had never occurred to him to take photographs of New York, where he has lived for the last 18 years and now teaches at Pratt Institute. But then, one birthday, he received the Magic Wand as a gift.\", \"\\u201cIt was really about just having the scanner with me in my bag when I was walking around,\\u201d said Relph, who is thin and wiry, with a mop of unruly brown hair tumbling toward his eyes. \\u201cI\\u2019m a walker. That\\u2019s how I make work, generally speaking. I just couldn\\u2019t ignore these posters, these very stark images. I pay attention to images. And the purpose of these is in one sense clearly defined and in another not at all.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cWhen I scanned the first few buildings, I thought: I have these images but I didn\\u2019t technically take a picture. And there was something really attractive about not having to point a camera.\\u201d\", \"As a teenager, Relph was diagnosed with obsessive-compulsive disorder, which he continues to manage and which has shaped portions of his work. At times over the last several years, he said, the building posters consumed his thinking, the city\\u2019s up-and-out overdrive providing him with more material than he could possibly encompass.\", \"The project was first included in MoMA PS 1\\u2019s \\u201cGreater New York\\u201d exhibition in 2015 but at that point, Relph said, he was really only getting started. Eventually, the work came to seem as if he was erecting a parallel-dimension New York in its entirety on his hard drives. Meanwhile, in the analog city, beginning in 2011, construction spending grew for eight consecutive years, reaching an all-time high of $60.6 billion in 2019 before the pandemic slump, more than any other American city, completely transforming swaths of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens.\", \"\\u201cThere is a slight rush in gathering more and knowing there are more to get,\\u201d Relph wrote in an email after our interview. \\u201cAnd there is an exhaustion in wanting/having to do so.\\u201d\", \"The painter Matt Connors, who founded Pre-Echo Press in 2016 to publish books by artists he admires, said that after learning of Relph\\u2019s project he would sometimes text him photos of extraterrestrial-looking construction renderings. \\u201cAnd invariably he would say, \\u2018Oh yeah, I already got that one,\\u2019\\u201d Connors said.\", \"\\u201cNick\\u2019s work kind of dances around finding ways of materializing itself, and it even dances around its subject,\\u201d he added. \\u201cHe didn\\u2019t know how this body of work would come to live in the world, and when I get excited about work one of my first impulses is to say to someone, \\u2018It should be a book.\\u2019 In this case, the original material, the posters, are printed objects, and so it really made sense to put it back out on paper.\\u201d\", \"The book \\u2014 whose surrealist title is a mash-up of imaginary storefront names taken from the renderings \\u2014 is almost entirely without text, except for a short poetic introduction in which Relph says, of the project: \\u201cReader, it had the taste of theft/A theft so tiny as to be absurd.\\u201d Leafing through its pages feels like reading Rem Koolhaas\\u2019s 1978 classic \\u201cDelirious New York\\u201d on psilocybin. It also feels like walking through parts of the actual city in perpetual twilight, viewed through dirty sunglasses, wondering \\u2014 especially against the backdrop of a global pandemic and a mounting climate crisis \\u2014 what possible reason could account for so many stupendous structures?\", \"Sometimes, the streets seem swept of humanity. At other times, people appear, tiny, attractive pedestrians and office workers, occasionally recurring like clones, concocted by graphic designers; unlikely vegetation and over-attractive trees spring up; a rendering of the Shed makes it resemble a mechanized version of the worm from \\u201cDune,\\u201d rearing up to devour pedestrians on the High Line. Occasionally, a wavy glitch that looks like human fingers intrudes. This is, in fact, Relph\\u2019s fingers, which show up when he tries to get the 8.5-inch scanner working by rubbing its rollers against his hand.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s all very low-tech,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI would try to get the best scan I could but sometimes the poster was faded or wrinkled or I\\u2019d scan over it too fast. Often, I was on my bicycle and I\\u2019d get up and balance on it to get to a tall poster, but I never carried a ladder or any other gear. \\u201d\", \"There is something of fl\\u00e2nerie in Relph\\u2019s methods, or what he and Payne have called \\u201cpower-dossing,\\u201d a tweak on the British slang for avoiding work by wandering around. Asked if the project proceeded from a philosophical position on the future of cities under late capitalism \\u2014 Baudelaire\\u2019s \\u201cpassionate spectator\\u201d or Walter Benjamin\\u2019s more politically pointed roving saboteur \\u2014 Relph demurred.\", \"\\u201cSome of these images have a really death-y feel,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPart of the reason why it took me so long to get this body of work done was me questioning: \\u2018Do I really want to put these images back out into the world?\\u2019 On the other hand, I certainly don\\u2019t think everything in this book is inherently evil. It\\u2019s never that simple.\\u201d\", \"Michelle Cotton, head of artistic programs and content at Mudam, the contemporary art museum of Luxembourg, where five enlarged versions of Relph\\u2019s scans are now on view in an exhibition called \\u201cPost-Capital: Art and the Economics of the Digital Age,\\u201d writes in a catalog essay that the images seem, at the very least, to \\u201cdescribe a certain poverty in excess, perhaps indicative of a culture in which even bricks and mortar find their value in the fulfillment of digital prophecies.\\u201d\", \"In an interview Cotton added: \\u201cI think Nick\\u2019s been able to make something which will be read as a hugely significant document in terms of what it has to say politically, socially, economically about how we\\u2019re living in this moment. Part of the irony is, we all know that artists move into downtrodden parts of a city because it\\u2019s what they can afford and then their presence makes it into a desirable neighborhood where sleek buildings like this get built and the artists get priced out.\\u201d\", \"As it happened, only a stone\\u2019s throw from the apartment where Relph now lives in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, a new 17-story apartment complex is rising above the mostly low-slung neighborhood. During our interview in the courtyard of his building, the metallic clang of construction and bleating trucks often drowned out speech. Before I left, Relph produced the scanner from his bag and walked dutifully over to the municipal-green plywood fence to register one more edifice of an uncertain future.\", \"\\u201cAnother couldn\\u2019t hurt, could it?\\u201d he asked.\"]","href_hash":"4c51ffe543a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4c51ffe543a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}},
