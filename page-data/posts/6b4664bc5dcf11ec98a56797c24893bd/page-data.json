The case is ironic considering George's job, which would likely require her to investigate instances of animal cruelty, provide humane treatment to animals in her care, and enforce animal welfare laws.\", \"According to the local news outlet, George had moved out of her mobile home in December 2020 due to tax forfeiture, leaving behind her German shepherd.\", \"An unnamed man interested in buying the home recently visited the abandoned property. There, he found the back door ajar and a deceased dog inside.\", \"Police arrived at the scene, reported New Castle News, and, looking through the mobile home's window, saw dog feces covering 25 to 35 square feet of the living room carpet.\", \"The animal's body was located near the home's front door.\", \"Per the same report, authorities from the Shenango Township Police Department spoke to George, who reportedly told them that the dog couldn't walk up or down the steps of her home and died of old age.\", \"While living at her new residence, George said she would occasionally bring food and water to the dog. She also told police that she would leave the German shepherd alone for weeks to months at a time.\", \"According to police documents obtained by the news outlet, George has been employed by the Lawrence Humane Society and, at the time of the incident and arrest, was working as an animal enforcement officer.\", \"While George's alleged actions may sound improbable, these cases, in which an animal welfare worker is accused of having caused abuse, do occur.\", \"In October, it was reported that an animal \\\"rescuer\\\" in Florida was accused of keeping over 40 animals in filthy, \\\"deplorable\\\" conditions. According to authorities, the woman had allegedly been using her animal rescue nonprofit, SAFFARI (Save A Furry Friend Animal Rescue, Inc.), as a front to sell drugs.\", \"The same month saw reports of animal neglect at a pet hotel and a veterinarian charged with sexually abusing dogs.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952455/german-shepherd.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A stock photo of a German shepherd.
