Broadwater, was vacated by a state court judge in Syracuse, N.Y., who concluded, in consultation with the local district attorney and Mr. Broadwater\\u2019s lawyers, that the case against him was deeply flawed.\", \"As a result of the conviction, Mr. Broadwater, 61, spent 16 years in prison before being released in 1998 and was forced to register as a sex offender.\", \"In a statement posted on the website Medium, Ms. Sebold, who described the rape and the ensuing trial in \\u201cLucky,\\u201d said she regretted having \\u201cunwittingly\\u201d played a part in \\u201ca system that sent an innocent man to jail.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI am sorry most of all for the fact that the life you could have led was unjustly robbed from you,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cAnd I know that no apology can change what happened to you and never will. It has taken me these past eight days to comprehend how this could have happened.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sebold\\u2019s statement was reported earlier by The Associated Press. Her publisher, Scribner, said she was not available for additional comment.\", \"Scribner said last week that it had no plans to update the memoir\\u2019s text based on Mr. Broadwater\\u2019s exoneration. But on Tuesday, the company said it would cease distribution of \\u201cLucky\\u201d while it and Ms. Sebold \\u201cconsider how the work might be revised.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Broadwater, in an interview with The New York Times on Tuesday, said he was \\u201crelieved and grateful\\u201d for Ms. Sebold\\u2019s apology.\", \"\\u201cIt took a lot of courage, and I guess she\\u2019s brave and weathering through the storm like I am,\\u201d he said. \\u201cTo make that statement, it\\u2019s a strong thing for her to do, understanding that she was a victim and I was a victim too.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sebold was 18 and a student at Syracuse University when the rape that led to Mr. Broadwater\\u2019s wrongful conviction occurred.\", \"In \\u201cLucky,\\u201d which was published in 1999, she gives a searing account of the assault and of the trauma she subsequently endured. She also writes in detail about the trial and about how she became convinced she had recognized Mr. Broadwater, whom she referred to with a pseudonym in the book, as her attacker after passing him on street months after the rape.\", \"The memoir chronicles mishaps in the case, including the fact that a composite sketch of her attacker, based on her description, did not resemble him. The book also describes Ms. Sebold\\u2019s fear that the prosecution might be derailed after she identified a different man, not Mr. Broadwater, in a police lineup.\", \"Later, she identified Mr. Broadwater as her attacker in court. After a brief trial, he was convicted of first-degree rape and five other charges.\", \"\\u201cLucky\\u201d started Ms. Sebold\\u2019s career and paved the way for her breakout novel, \\u201cThe Lovely Bones,\\u201d which also centers on sexual assault. It has sold millions of copies and was made into a feature film.\", \"Although Ms. Sebold gave Mr. Broadwater the fictitious name Gregory Madison in the memoir, he said he had been forced to suffer the stigma of being branded a sex offender even after being released from prison.\", \"He had always insisted he was innocent and was denied parole several times for refusing to acknowledge guilt. He took two polygraph tests, decades apart, with experts who determined that his account was truthful.\", \"He tried repeatedly over the years to hire lawyers to help prove his innocence. Those efforts were unsuccessful until recently, when a planned film adaptation of \\u201cLucky\\u201d helped raise new questions about the case.\", \"Timothy Mucciante, who was working as executive producer on the film version, said in an interview with The Times that he had started to doubt Ms. Sebold\\u2019s account after reading the memoir and the script earlier this year.\", \"Mr. Mucciante said he had been struck by how little evidence was presented at Mr. Broadwater\\u2019s trial. He said he had been fired from the production after raising questions about the story. (The feature film was dropped after losing its financing, Variety reported.)\", \"\\u201cIt seemed like Anthony was wronged,\\u201d Mr. Mucciante told The Times.\", \"Mr. Mucciante hired a private investigator, Dan Myers, who had spent 20 years with the Sheriff\\u2019s Office in Onondaga County, N.Y., before retiring as a detective in 2020. After finding and interviewing Mr. Broadwater, Mr. Myers became convinced he had been falsely accused.\", \"Mr. Myers, who shares office space with a law firm, recommended that Mr. Broadwater hire one of the lawyers there, J. David Hammond. Mr. Hammond reviewed the investigation and agreed that there was a strong argument for setting the conviction aside.\", \"In their motion to vacate the conviction, Mr. Hammond and a second lawyer, Melissa K. Swartz, argued that the case rested entirely on two flawed elements: Ms. Sebold\\u2019s courtroom identification of Mr. Broadwater and a now-discredited method of microscopic hair analysis.\", \"Mr. Mucciante\\u2019s production company, Red Badge Films, is now working on a documentary about the case, \\u201cUnlucky,\\u201d with a second production company, Red Hawk Films. Mr. Broadwater and those who helped vacate the conviction are also participating.\", \"In her statement, Ms. Sebold expressed sorrow that in seeking justice for herself, she had harmed Mr. Broadwater beyond the 16 years he was incarcerated \\u201cin ways that further serve to wound and stigmatize, nearly a full life sentence.\\u201d\", \"She also sounded anguished over a question that remains unresolved.\", \"\\u201cI will also grapple,\\u201d she wrote, \\u201cwith the fact that my rapist will, in all likelihood, never be known.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"7d7829ea523811ecbb736d974ee9e743"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7d7829ea523811ecbb736d974ee9e743"}},
