Jess Kerr claimed the best bowling figures of her career at international level with four wickets for 35 runs. Kerr nabbed the big wicket of Indian captain Mithali Raj on 59 runs.\", \"Opener, Bates celebrated her 11th international ODI century, at a run a ball pace on the way to scoring 106 runs, as the White Ferns were proactive early on.\", \"Bates was thrilled with her individual performance, while she complimented her team-mates for their discipline.\", \"\\\"It's massive...you get a lot of confidence,\\\" Bates said.\", \"\\\"We knew the ball didn't turn too much and backed ourselves against the spin.\\\"\", \"\\\"Amy (Satterthwaite) swept beautifully and made it look like there were a lot of gaps out there.\\\"\", \"Bates had luck on her side, due to a rusty Indian fielding display.
