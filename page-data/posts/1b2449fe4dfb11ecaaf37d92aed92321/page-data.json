That would make him eligible for parole in about six years, after serving a total of 40 years. Skahan will decide how the sentences should run at a hearing next month.\", \"But Henry also says she will also continue to seek evidence to exonerate Payne.\", \"Payne was convicted on murder charges in the killing of Charisse Christopher and her 2-year-old daughter, Lacie Jo. Christopher's son, Nicholas, then aged 3, was also stabbed, but survived.\", \"Payne told police that he had been at the apartment building to meet his girlfriend when he heard the victims and tried to help them. But he said he panicked and ran away when he saw a white police officer.\", \"Payne's attorneys have argued that police focused exclusively on Payne as a suspect despite his lack of a prior criminal history. They have argued that the person responsible for the murders is Christopher's ex-husband, Kenneth Christopher.\", \"\\\"We have argued in our commutation petition that the victim's ex-husband is the responsible party, whether he did it himself or whether or not he got somebody to do it, that's something we're still investigating,\\\" Henry said. \\\"But he had a background of serious domestic violence towards every woman he was ever married to.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1612776/pervis-payne.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Pervis Payne picture in Riverbend Maximum Security institution in Tennessee.</div>\", \"Holman is optimistic that her brother will be exonerated one day.\", \"\\\"People often ask us, what makes you hold on for so long?

Our faith and hope has allowed us to keep searching for the truth and fighting for justice.\\\"\", \"Holman said the campaign to get her brother off death row \\\"took off like a rocket\\\" after his case was taken up by the Innocence Project, which has argued that it bears all the hallmarks of a wrongful conviction rooted in racial bias and crucial missing evidence.\", \"The Innocence Project has noted that the prosecution employed racial stereotypes to portray Payne as a \\\"hypersexual and violent drug user who attacked a white woman\\\" and the use of such stereotypes are known to contribute to wrongful conviction and sentencing.\", \"\\\"That's been something that has been put on Black men as it relates to white women for many years,\\\" Holman said.\", \"And Payne had come very close to being executed. He was scheduled to be put to death last December, but Gov. Bill Lee granted him a reprieve due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The reprieve expired in April, but a new execution date had not been set.\", \"And although the Supreme Court ruled that executions of the mentally disabled were unconstitutional in 2002, it wasn't until Lee signed a bill earlier this year making retroactive Tennessee's law prohibiting the execution of the intellectually disabled that the state had a mechanism for an inmate to reopen a case to press an intellectual disability claim.\", \"\\\"If we would not have worked to get this law passed, it's very possible that Pervis wouldn't be here today,\\\" Holman said.\"]","href_hash":"1b2449fe4dfb11ecaaf37d92aed92321"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1b2449fe4dfb11ecaaf37d92aed92321"}},
