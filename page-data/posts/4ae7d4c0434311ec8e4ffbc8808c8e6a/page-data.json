There are some exceptions among older people and those with weakened immune systems.\", \"But while vaccines remain effective against the worst outcomes, a number of published studies show that their protection against infections has fallen. My colleagues in the Graphics department, Amy Schoenfeld Walker and Josh Holder, put together a few charts to help understand what we know. (If you\\u2019re reading this on mobile, you may want to pinch to zoom in.)\", \"As seen above, a study in England examined the vaccines\\u2019 effectiveness against the Delta variant over time. It found that the Pfizer vaccine was about 90 percent effective at preventing symptomatic infection two weeks after the second dose, but that the vaccine dropped to 70 percent effectiveness after five months.\", \"The same study found that the Moderna vaccine\\u2019s protection also dropped over time.\", \"Two additional studies, in the U.S. and in Canada, also found that the vaccines\\u2019 protection dropped over time.\", \"Still, both the English and Canadian studies found that even after several months, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines remained highly effective at preventing hospitalization.\", \"\\u201cThe main objective of the Covid vaccine is to prevent severe disease and death, and they are still doing a good job at that,\\u201d said Melissa Higdon of the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, who compiles research on Covid vaccine performance.\", \"But the decline in protection against infection will still have an impact.\", \"\\u201cWith true declines in vaccine effectiveness, we\\u2019ll likely see more cases overall,\\u201d Higdon said.\", \"Pfizer and BioNTech asked the F.D.A. this week to authorize boosters for all adults. But experts have been divided over whether booster shots are necessary for those beyond the most vulnerable. Some also worry that a national focus on boosters will serve as a distraction.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s easy with all the discussion about boosters to lose that really important message that the vaccines are still working,\\u201d said Eli Rosenberg, the deputy director for science in the Office of Public Health at the New York State Department of Health. \\u201cGoing from an unvaccinated to a vaccinated person is still the critical step.\\u201d\", \"What does it look like when you keep children out of school for 18 months? Uganda is finding out.\", \"Since the early days of the pandemic, officials there have kept more than 10 million primary and secondary school students at home. And while Uganda\\u2019s leaders say it\\u2019s the safest option, the effects are stark.\", \"A recent report released by the government found that \\u201c30 percent of the learners are likely not to return to school forever\\u201d and that 3,507 primary and 832 secondary schools in the country were likely to close.\", \"Young women, abandoning hopes of going to school, are getting married and starting families instead. School buildings are being converted into businesses or health clinics. Teachers are quitting, and disillusioned students are taking menial jobs like selling fruit or mining for gold.\", \"The \\u201cgovernment has not left schools closed to punish you, but rather, to protect you from harm,\\u201d the education minister, Janet Museveni, who is also the country\\u2019s first lady, said on Twitter in September. She said that the government did not want to risk having parents become infected by students, who \\u201cwould become orphans \\u2014 just like H.I.V./AIDS did to many of our families.\\u201d\", \"Uganda saw a surge in cases in June driven by the Delta variant, but the country now has a relatively low infection rate, recording 67 deaths last month, and is now averaging 372 new cases per day.\", \"Mukasa Nicholas, 18, said that he had waited six months for classes to start before moving to Kampala, the capital, to find a job. He now sells medical masks on the street, bringing in about $2 a day.\", \"\\u201cIf my parents ask me to return to school,\\u201d he said, \\u201cI will reject them.\\u201d\", \"President Yoweri Museveni said in a televised address last month that parents should expect schools to reopen in January, along with other small businesses like bars, hair salons and recreational centers.\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic.
