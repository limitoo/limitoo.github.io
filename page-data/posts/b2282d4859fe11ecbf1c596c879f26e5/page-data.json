Any big plans for the weekend? I\\u2019ve been thinking about that question, a staple of workplace chitchat, at once an invitation to share something personal with a colleague and a challenge to quickly scour one\\u2019s mental datebook for something, anything that might rise to the level of a \\u201cplan,\\u201d never mind a \\u201cbig\\u201d one.\", \"I\\u2019ve noticed people have started asking about \\u201cbig plans\\u201d again, whether for the weekend or the holidays, and the question feels loaded in new and tricky ways. Do my plans sound too risky, given the latest variant news? Too cautious? What am I revealing about my levels of comfort/discomfort with the pandemic moment when responding?\", \"Of course, the query isn\\u2019t always meant to be taken literally; it\\u2019s small talk, a low-stakes opening, telegraphing that we\\u2019re not just workaday drones but multidimensional humans with lives outside of our jobs. But that\\u2019s another social byproduct of the pandemic: Apparently casual exchanges feel newly freighted. It\\u2019s not necessarily a bad thing, thinking harder about how we describe our lives. We might even periodically ask ourselves about our big plans \\u2014 for this weekend, for next year, for the future. How do our responses shift, moment to moment?\", \"I don\\u2019t mind telling you that my big plans this weekend involve watching the new season of \\u201cHow To With John Wilson,\\u201d finishing Katie Kitamura\\u2019s riveting novel \\u201cIntimacies\\u201d (one of the Book Review\\u2019s 10 Best Books of 2021), checking out some of Eric Asimov\\u2019s favorite wines of 2021. (I\\u2019m curious about the \\u201cfresh, energetic, textured and eminently digestible\\u201d Australian riesling called \\u201cOpa, Watch Out!,\\u201d but it sounds tough to track down in the U.S.)\", \"Tara Parker-Pope has some wellness advice worth putting into practice this weekend, including \\u201cGive the best hours of your day to yourself.\\u201d If you\\u2019re taking a trip over the holidays, be sure to spend a few minutes with \\u201cOmicron and Holiday Travel: 12 of the Most Pressing Questions.\\u201d Don\\u2019t miss these tips for getting through the holidays, whether you\\u2019re wondering about gathering in groups or just feeling generally overwhelmed. This story about reconfiguring holiday traditions might offer just the permission you need to skip some seasonal obligations altogether.\", \"Whatever you get up to this weekend, let the At Home Catharsis Songs playlist be your soundtrack. It\\u2019s an eclectic assortment, and good for when you need a break from \\u201cCarol of the Bells.\\u201d Thanks to everyone who contributed.\", \"Keep sending your best books, songs, recipes, ideas, movies, shows, advice, what-have-you of 2021 to athome@nytimes.com.
