You know, people forget that he was a great drummer as well as a sweater-wearing nice guy from the '80s, poor fella.\\\"\", \"When he spent two years in the mid-1990s drumming for Morrissette, he was inspired primarily by the playing of Jane's Addiction's Stephen Perkins.\", \"\\\"My drums were set up like him, the whole thing,\\\" Hawkins told the AP. \\\"I was still sort of a copycat at that point. It takes a while and takes a little while to sort of establish your own sort of style. I didn't sound exactly like him, I sound like me, but he was a big, huge influence.\\\"\", \"He and Grohl met backstage at a show when Hawkins was still with Morrissette.

Hawkins and the other members of the band are killed off one by one. The premise came out of their work on their 10th studio album at a home in Los Angeles.\", \"He also drummed and sang for the side-project trio Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders.
