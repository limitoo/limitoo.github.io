Painfully inhibited, neglected by her family and racked with guilt over her meaninglessly violent actions overseas, Isabelle is not at ease in this world. She struggles to find reasons to go on.\", \"At least she is not alone. Isabelle joins a multigenerational group of veterans who create antiwar artwork and poetry out of paper they fashion from discarded military uniforms. There she meets Will (Sam Adegoke), who has been blaming himself for the death of a vet he had been a mentor to, Timothy Reyes.\", \"\\u201cThis Is Not a War Story,\\u201d which Lugacy also directed, is a naturalistic, chat-heavy narrative that captures the difficulties wrought by the unimaginable trauma individuals face as they attempt to forge connections and find peace after war. It opens with Timothy drifting around the New York City subway, taking pills and ultimately dying unnoticed in his seat, a warning about the perils of coming home. The cast is supplemented by real-life veterans in supporting roles who speak to their own experiences.\", \"In the film, Will uneasily takes Isabelle under his wing. \\u201cI hate the word \\u2018healing,\\u2019\\u201d he observes. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not some point of arrival. It\\u2019s something you\\u2019re doing all the time.\\u201d\", \"Unfolding at a restlessly melancholy pace, the film is less a plot-driven story than an assemblage of conversations and encounters. Its power lies in the tentative friendship that takes root between Isabelle and Will. Though their discussions \\u2014 which touch frankly on issues including the horrors of Abu Ghraib \\u2014 can seem contrived and literal-minded, the edgy vulnerability and emotional stiltedness the actors bring to their characters\\u2019 rapport is palpable and authentic. When the two eventually achieve a more relaxed, harmonious relationship, it feels like a minor miracle.\"]","href_hash":"61faf9a43d6111ec8344000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"61faf9a43d6111ec8344000017025a03"}},
