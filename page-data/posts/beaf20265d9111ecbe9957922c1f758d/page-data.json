It caught the attention of publications of all kinds, including this one, and has been studied and replicated by countries around the world. The urgency has only been exacerbated by the raging pandemic.\", \"The work by Dr. Kingston and her team was first recognized by then Prime Minister Theresa May \\u2014 who appointed a member of Parliament, Tracey Crouch, as the first minister for loneliness in 2018. But the Frome Model, as it is known, reached a milestone just a few weeks ago when the National Health Service (N.H.S.) in Britain, locked in permanent funding for the program after years of patchwork financial support.\", \"The efforts haven\\u2019t ended at Frome. In November, the government of Victoria, Australia, agreed to create the position and Japan added one in February amid rising suicide rates. And cities around Britain and as far away as Sweden and Colombia are studying Frome\\u2019s experience and hoping to copy its success in reducing emergency hospital admissions, an achievement that is gold dust in a time of rising health costs.\", \"So why Frome? And what was so special about its approach?\", \"The effort begun here is based on a model of health care driven by the local medical clinic, the Frome Medical Practice, that seeks to improve the emotional well-being of patients by tapping into community connections and volunteer groups to help people deal with such problems as loneliness and social isolation, which are not usually viewed as medical problems.\", \"\\u201cIf this was a franchise it would be a very attractive one to sell,\\u201d said Will Palmer, a 59-year-old fashion industry consultant who helps British brands enter foreign markets. Mr. Palmer doubles as one of Frome\\u2019s \\u201chealth connectors,\\u201d who link people to community groups and services ranging from home heating advice to help with hearing aids and cooking lessons.\", \"One of the most striking things about the Frome idea is that apart from eight paid connectors like Mr. Palmer, this city of just under 30,000 has also trained 1,140 voluntary \\u201ccommunity connectors.\\u201d Cafe owners, taxi drivers and other ordinary residents have been taught how to advise their friends and neighbors about the community groups and services that often go underused for the simple reason that people do not know they exist.\", \"Mr. Palmer\\u2019s specialty is getting people digitally connected. Recently he was sitting in the Cheese and Grain Cafe giving smartphone lessons to John Willis, a 77-year-old retired builder who feels his generation is being isolated by the rise of online shopping and government services.\", \"\\u201cWe are being left behind,\\u201d Mr. Willis said. \\u201cEveryone communicates online nowadays and you have to pay through the nose if you can\\u2019t shop online.\\u201d Mr. Willis\\u2019s digital lessons were organized through the medical practice, along with advice on how to reduce large utility bills that were worrying him after the death of his ex-wife, Eileen, 18 months ago left him depressed and anxious.\", \"\\u201cI was on the verge of a mental breakdown and had terrible headaches and stress,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t be bothered going out or seeing anyone but it\\u2019s hard to say you\\u2019re lonely because you are supposed to be a hard man.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Palmer and his team of 70 volunteer \\u201cdigital connectors,\\u201d who help point people toward digital training and free Wi-Fi or donated electronic devices, are just part of a vibrant network of community services that can be mobilized to deal with some of the emotional issues that often exacerbate people\\u2019s health problems.\", \"In the parking lot outside the coffee shop, several unused toilets have been converted to a community fridge, which dispenses donated food to whoever wants it, and the Frome Coat Rack offering free jackets and other clothes.\", \"A few meters away is the Talking Bench, a wooden seat where Hayley Morgan, health connector, and Janet Copsey, a volunteer, wait each Wednesday morning to talk to anyone who just wants to chat or is looking for advice about the often bewildering lineup of community groups in Frome.\", \"Ms. Copsey, 60, has been trained to advise people about everything from joining choirs and sports groups to finding tips on green lifestyles.\", \"The Talking Bench is an offshoot of a popular Talking Caf\\u00e9, where strangers can get together; Ms. Copsey is also involved in a postcard-writing project which sends friendly missives to people with little social contact.\", \"Just around the corner is Share, a nonprofit \\u201clibrary of things\\u201d that cuts waste by lending items ranging from donated power tools to geothermal cameras for monitoring home heat- loss.\", \"While many cities have vibrant community networks, the unusual thing about Frome\\u2019s initiative is the role of the medical practice in mobilizing them as part of a deliberate strategy to strengthen patients\\u2019 resilience and well-being.\", \"Dr. Kingston, 56, has worked at the Frome Medical Practice for 26 years, spending much of that time frustrated that her patients often needed more than a drug. But she lacked the resources to help them with the nonmedical stresses and crises exacerbating their health problems.\", \"In 2013, she won National Health Service funding for her practice and for the wider local government district of Mendip, with its population of 115,000, to employ Jenny Hartnoll, a dynamic community development worker who wanted to compile a guide to existing community services and to see whether there were any obvious gaps that could be filled by new groups.\", \"\\u201cBecause we\\u2019re on the edge of Somerset [county] they let us get on with things and our practice was big enough to do things at scale but not so big that you had to have a committee of 50 people making decisions when you wanted to try something new,\\u201d said Dr. Kingston.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not just lonely people who benefit from more social connections, we all have that basic human need and by recognizing that fact you can support people instead of waiting until there\\u2019s a crisis,\\u201d she added. \\u201cIf the real reason you are depressed and not sleeping is that you\\u2019re bereaved or have lost your job then no pill is going to cure that but just asking people what\\u2019s on their mind helps you to formulate a better plan for them.\\u201d\", \"The practice now employs the health connectors, who earn \\u00a320,000 to \\u00a326,000 a year ($26,450 to $34,400; some are part-time), and a team of nurses to reach out to vulnerable people who need support. The community development work led by Ms. Hartnoll means the nurses and doctors know what services are available to help each person, and the hundreds of community connectors trained by her team are spreading that information even further.\", \"Ms. Hartnoll, 54, encouraged retired software worker Patrick Abrahams, 70, for instance, to set up a Men\\u2019s Shed, which now offers two weekly sessions where both men and women can gather to share woodworking and other projects, often repairing things for services like the Community Fridge and the local hospital.\", \"Ron Carver, an 87-year-old retired master carpenter who is known as \\u201cEl Presidente\\u201d of the shed, says he enjoys passing on his skills \\u201cbut the camaraderie is what you really want.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cA lot of us are on our own, so it\\u2019s great to get together,\\u201d said Mr. Carver, whose most recent project was a small wooden coffin for the ashes of his wife, Iris, who died in 2018.\", \"Dr. Julian Abel, a retired palliative care consultant, said the results in Frome of fostering human relationships and a more compassionate community as a part of medical care amounted to \\u201ca medical miracle.\\u201d\", \"It was Dr. Abel who got access to local medical data in 2018 and published a report, peer-reviewed and published by the British Journal of General Practice, showing that from 2013 to 2017, when the program was underway, emergency hospital admissions in Frome fell by 14 percent while they rose by 29 percent in the broader county of Somerset, even though the demographics are similar.\", \"\\u201cThere are no other interventions which have ever reduced population emergency admissions like this,\\u201d he said.\", \"Ms. Hartnoll shies away from the idea that loneliness has been or could ever be eradicated and says her work has been helped by having a town council that is innovative and focused on community development. \", \"Nonetheless, Frome\\u2019s reputation has been transformed from that of a place where it could be dangerous to go into town on a Saturday night 20 years ago to an unusually friendly and caring community, helping to attract an influx of middle-class newcomers from London and elsewhere.\", \"One result \\u2014 unhappy to some \\u2014 has been a surge in home prices, prompting a backlash from some longtime residents.\", \"Andy Wrintmore, a 6-foot 9-inch-tall drummer in a punk rock band who was elected Frome\\u2019s mayor this year, says he cannot afford to buy a house \\u201cso I can see why some \\u2018Old Fromies\\u2019 are not happy.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBut I still think the changes in the community have been fantastic,\\u201d said the 29-year-old mayor.\", \"Ms. Hartnoll is adamant that there is nothing special about Frome that suggests the model cannot succeed elsewhere. The Mendip district is ethnically homogeneous \\u2014 in the 2011 census 98.7 percent of household leaders were white \\u2014 but the city has enough economic problems to dispel any notion that it is some ideal community, she said.\", \"Ms. Hartnoll\\u2019s team is struggling to keep up with international requests for information and training, work that is not covered by their N.H.S. funding and would ideally be funded by international philanthropy.\", \"Dr. Marcello Bertotti, a senior research fellow at the University of East London, said Frome was \\u201cat the vanguard\\u201d of the growing movement to better incorporate nonclinical solutions into medical care.\", \"\\u201cSince 2019 the N.H.S. has funded 1,470 community \\u2018link workers\\u2019 in medical practices around the country but Frome has been really pioneering by also having all those volunteer community connectors,\\u201d he said. \\u201cCities all around the world are taking notice.\\u201d\", \"Before Covid arrived, the Frome team was visited by interested groups from Hong Kong, Colombia, Italy, Australia and elsewhere, and in the past eight months it has given online advice to others from Denmark, Portugal, and Ontario and British Columbia, Canada.\", \"Friends in Umea, a community group from the Swedish city has conducted a series of Zoom meetings with Ms. Hartnoll\\u2019s team and is working with doctors and nonprofit groups to copy some of its approach.\", \"\\u201cWe are suggesting a model similar to the one in Frome and we are on our way from theory to practice,\\u201d says Bjerre Ljungberg, one of the group\\u2019s board members.\", \"\\u201cIt feels like we are taking part in a worldwide network against loneliness,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"beaf20265d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"beaf20265d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}},
