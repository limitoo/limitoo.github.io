All visitors must be redirected to a single entrance so they can show proof of vaccination and go through a temperature check.\", \"This increase in security is in response to an incident on December 2 regarding Republican lawmakers who refused to comply with the statehouse's mandate. A stand-off occurred between state troopers and legislators who defied a new mandate that blocked those who could not provide proof of vaccination against COVID-19 or a negative test.\", \"\\\"You have no right to stop us,\\\" Republican Assemblyman Erik Peterson told troopers as they were denied entry into the Assembly. \\\"You see this? You see this, folks? Denying us entry into our house.\\\"\", \"At the time, state troopers did not provide any explanation for the blocking of legislators. Some lawmakers compared the incident to that of a dictatorship, with Assemblyman Hal Wirths at one point yelling \\\"this is America!\\\"\", \"In total, 28 members of the Assembly were involved, eventually gaining entry. An email was sent to the state police demanding an explanation. The incident was called \\\"a colossal failure of security\\\" by Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin, a Democrat.\", \"\\\"Twenty-eight members of the minority caucus could not be bothered to exhibit common decency and humanity all because they would rather have a couple of minutes on TV news,\\\" he added.\", \"Due to the incident, Assembly meetings have been switched back to remote.
