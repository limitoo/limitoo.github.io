Health officials said they were trying to persuade parents of the benefits of vaccinating their children without applying pressure or any form of coercion.\", \"In a bid to reassure the public, Prime Minister Naftali Bennett accompanied his son David, 9, to a vaccination center of the Clalit Health Services in the seaside town of Herzliya, north of Tel Aviv.\", \"\\u201cI call on all Israeli parents to come and have their children vaccinated,\\u201d Mr. Bennett said. \\u201cIt is safe and it safeguards our children.\\u201d In a video posted on the prime minister\\u2019s official Twitter account, David said he had agreed to be filmed to encourage other children to get vaccinated.
