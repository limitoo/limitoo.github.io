Ravid said Trump added: \\\"F*** him.\\\"\", \"On January 20, Netanyahu congratulated Biden on his \\\"historic\\\" inauguration, adding that the pair had a \\\"warm personal friendship going back many decades.\\\"\", \"According to transcripts released by Ravid, Trump told the journalist: \\\"Nobody did more for Bibi. And I liked Bibi. I still like Bibi,\\\" referring to Netanyahu by his nickname. \\\"But I also like loyalty.\\\"\", \"Trump also wrongly states that Netanyahu was one of the first people to congratulate Biden on his victory. In fact, the Israeli prime minister waited several hours after the election was called for Biden to congratulate him and his message arrived after greetings from a number of other world leaders.\", \"\\\"The first person to congratulate Biden was Bibi. And not only did he congratulate him, he did it on tape. And it was on tape.\", \"\\\"The first person who congratulated Joe Biden, because this was an election in dispute, it's still in dispute. The first person who congratulated was Bibi Netanyahu, the man that I did more for than any other person I dealt with.\\\"\", \"Trump added: \\\"Bibi could have stayed quiet. He has made a terrible mistake.\", \"\\\"He was very early. Like earlier than most. I haven't spoken to him since. F**k him.\\\"\", \"This is a developing story and will be updated as more information becomes available. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949117/trump-benjamin-netanyahu.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">In this photo provided by the Israeli government press office, Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump speak at Ben Gurion International Airport in Tel Aviv on May 23, 2017.
