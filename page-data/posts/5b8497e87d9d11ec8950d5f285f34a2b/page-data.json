But when they start getting together as a group, as a mob, and start being disruptive, in any way or form, that's a different thing.\", \"\\\"If they're coming in to do what everyone else is doing -- to enjoy the tennis -- and if they've got a T-shirt on that says, 'Where is Peng Shuai?', that's fine.\\\"\", \"Peng's situation became a matter of concern in November when the former women's number one doubles player alleged that a former Chinese Vice Premier, Zhang Gaoli, had sexually assaulted her in the past.

T-shirts at Melbourne Park this week after raising more than A$10,000 on a GoFundMe page.\", \"Reuters\", \"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"5b8497e87d9d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5b8497e87d9d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
