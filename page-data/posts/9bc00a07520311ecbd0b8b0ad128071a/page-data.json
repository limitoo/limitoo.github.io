He said that China, Russia, Iran and international terrorism were the \\\"big four\\\" threats facing U.K. spies, with China taking the No. 1 priority slot.\", \"The Associated Press reported that Moore called China \\\"an authoritarian state with different values than ours,\\\" saying Beijing conducts \\\"large-scale espionage operations\\\" against the U.K. and its allies, tries to \\\"distort public discourse and political decision-making\\\" and exports technology that allows for a \\\"web of authoritarian control\\\" around the world.\", \"\\\"Beijing believes its own propaganda about Western frailties and under-estimates Washington's resolve,\\\" Moore added. \\\"The risk of Chinese miscalculation through overconfidence is real.\\\"\", \"Moore also said the government in Beijing backs \\\"bold and decisive action,\\\" specifically citing its refusal to acknowledge Taiwan as an independent country despite its split from mainland China in 1949.\", \"\\\"Beijing's growing military strength and the [Chinese Communist] party's desire to resolve the Taiwan issue, by force if necessary, also pose a serious challenge to global stability and peace,\\\" Moore said.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942427/richard-moore-mi6-united-kingdom.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Richard Moore, the Chief of Britain's Secret Intelligence Service, also known as MI6, said China, Russia and Iran pose three of the biggest threats to the U.K. in a fast-changing, unstable world.
