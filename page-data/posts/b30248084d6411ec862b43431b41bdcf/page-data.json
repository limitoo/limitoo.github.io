Military aircraft unloaded government cars and other heavy cargo earlier this week. And a wave of clean-cut Secret Service agents has filled otherwise quiet luxury inns.\", \"President Biden is in town for Thanksgiving, with more than just his family in tow.\", \"\\u201cTeam after team after team of people come through with jeans and T-shirts, but then you notice they have a little clipboard with the White House insignia,\\u201d said Jack Fritsch, who runs the Antique Depot just near the local ferry drop-off. \\u201cYou recognize the haircuts. They\\u2019re Secret Service agents.\\u201d\", \"The Bidens\\u2019 decision to spend Thanksgiving on Nantucket this year renews a family tradition that dates back to 1975, when Mr. Biden and his wife-to-be spent their first holiday together. In his memoir, \\u201cPromise Me, Dad,\\u201d Mr. Biden said the couple had multiple invitations to Thanksgiving dinner that year. Instead of disappointing anyone, they decided to spend the holiday on the island with Mr. Biden\\u2019s two young boys, Beau and Hunter, at the recommendation of his chief of staff, Wes Barthelmes.\", \"\\u201c\\u2018What you need is a nuclear Thanksgiving,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Biden wrote Mr. Barthelmes told him. \\u201cMeaning the nuclear family alone. Only Wes Barthelmes was a Boston guy, so what he actually said was \\u2018nucle-aah Thanksgiving.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Now, the Bidens have a far more expansive family along for the trip \\u2014 including children, grandchildren and in-laws. So they are staying in a home they have visited in the past, that of David Rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle Group private equity firm.\", \"Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, deflected a question this week about the president\\u2019s decision to stay at a billionaire\\u2019s home after having run as champion of the middle class and criticized the rich for not paying their fair share.\", \"\\u201cThis is a time to put politics aside, spend time with your loved ones, and talk about what you\\u2019re grateful for,\\u201d Ms. Psaki said.\", \"Before he was president, Mr. Biden managed to blend in with the local crowds. Residents said they might see him walking cobblestone roads near the harbor in search of a coffee or taking a plunge in the icy waters of the Atlantic to celebrate the holiday.\", \"\\u201cObviously when he was senator there wasn\\u2019t that much commotion,\\u201d Mr. Fritsch said. Even as vice president, \\u201cno one minded.\\u201d\", \"But with his new job, Mr. Biden brings a dizzying array of security personnel, members of the media and White House officials, not to mention a parade of family members: his children, Ashley and Hunter; Hunter\\u2019s wife, Melissa; grandchildren Naomi, Finnegan, Maisy, Natalie, Hunter Biden II and Beau; and Naomi\\u2019s fianc\\u00e9, Peter Neal.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s a little bit of excitement,\\u201d said Noah Karberg, the assistant manager of Nantucket Memorial Airport. He noted that the island has welcomed former secretary of state John Kerry and former vice president Mike Pence. Still, he has asked his staff to stay a little later than usual for the arrival of Air Force One on Tuesday night.\", \"\\u201cWe get to handle a really big aircraft,\\u201d he said.\", \"Rep. William Keating, Democrat of Massachusetts, said his phone line has been inundated with calls from residents describing the additional security presence on the island.\", \"\\u201cThese are people who are used to famous people coming and going,\\u201d said Mr. Keating, who represents Nantucket as well as Martha\\u2019s Vineyard, where the Obamas own a home. \\u201cBut I guess it\\u2019s just the entourage and all of the intended things that go with the president.\\u201d\", \"The Bidens took a break from Thanksgiving in Nantucket in 2015, just six months after Beau died of brain cancer at age 46. They went to Rome that year instead. The family has returned to the island occasionally since then, but did not spend Thanksgiving on the island in 2019 because of the travel commitments of Mr. Biden\\u2019s presidential campaign. Last year, they stayed in Rehoboth, Del., because of concerns about the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cPeople missed him, but mostly it was sympathy,\\u201d Mr. Fritsch said.\", \"One thing the president will not be able to escape during his holiday getaway are reminders of the labor shortages that have hit employers nationwide, including the local Faregrounds Restaurant & Pudleys Pub, where patrons are welcomed with a sign warning of potential delays.\", \"Bill Puder, the owner of Faregrounds, still remembers nearly two decades ago when an unfamiliar Dr. Jill Biden called the restaurant and asked if it would cater Thanksgiving dinner for her family.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t even know who he was,\\u201d Mr. Puder said of the then-senator.\", \"Mr. Puder said the Bidens have regularly chosen his restaurant, which is decorated with Boston sports memorabilia, to cater their Thanksgiving meal. When he did not receive an order from the Bidens in 2019, he called the first lady to be sure.\", \"\\u201cIt went to an answering machine and she called me right back and said, \\u2018No, I\\u2019m sorry, I should\\u2019ve told you,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Puder said.\", \"This year, instead of cooking for the Bidens, Mr. Puder has another task: cooking Thanksgiving dinner for 100 members of the Secret Service.\", \"\\u201cIt really is an honor,\\u201d Mr. Puder said.\", \"Still, he emphasized that locals are accustomed to famous visitors \\u2014 presidents, senators and sports stars alike.\", \"\\u201cBelichick has come in here,\\u201d Mr. Puder said with a smile, referring to Bill Belichick, the head coach of the New England Patriots.\"]","href_hash":"b30248084d6411ec862b43431b41bdcf"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b30248084d6411ec862b43431b41bdcf"}},
