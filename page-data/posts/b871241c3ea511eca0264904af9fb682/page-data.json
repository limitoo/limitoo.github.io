Trump\\u2019s frenzied efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, refused to cooperate on Friday with the House committee investigating the Jan. 6 Capitol attack, leading to a sharp rebuke from the committee\\u2019s chairman.\", \"The standoff between Mr. Clark and the committee is the second such confrontation since Congress began investigating the circumstances surrounding the Capitol violence, seeking information on Mr. Trump\\u2019s attempts to subvert the election. The House has already voted to find one Trump ally, Stephen K. Bannon, in criminal contempt of Congress for stonewalling the inquiry.\", \"\\u201cMr. Clark\\u2019s complete failure to cooperate today is unacceptable,\\u201d said Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the chairman of the committee. \\u201cAs prescribed by the House rules, I have considered Mr. Clark\\u2019s claim of privilege and rejected it. He has a very short time to reconsider and cooperate fully. We need the information that he is withholding, and we are willing to take strong measures to hold him accountable.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Clark appeared before the committee on Friday but delivered a letter saying he would not answer substantive questions. He cited attorney-client privilege protecting his conversations with Mr. Trump.\", \"\\u201cHe is duty-bound not to provide testimony to your committee covering information protected by the former president\\u2019s assertion of executive privilege,\\u201d Mr. Clark\\u2019s lawyer, Harry W. MacDougald, wrote in a letter to the committee, which was reported earlier by Politico. \\u201cMr. Clark cannot answer deposition questions at this time.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Bannon also cited Mr. Trump\\u2019s directive for former aides and advisers to invoke immunity and refrain from turning over documents that might be protected under executive privilege in his refusal to cooperate. A federal judge expressed skepticism on Thursday about the merits of Mr. Trump\\u2019s lawsuit against the committee seeking to block from release at least 770 pages of documents related to the Capitol riot.\", \"Under federal law, any person summoned as a congressional witness who refuses to comply can face a misdemeanor charge that carries a fine of $100 to $100,000 and a jail sentence of one month to one year.\", \"Mr. Thompson suggested such a penalty could await Mr. Clark, once a little-known official who repeatedly pushed his colleagues at the Justice Department to help Mr. Trump undo his loss.\", \"The committee has issued a subpoena seeking testimony and records from Mr. Clark, a focus that indicates it is deepening its scrutiny of the root causes of the attack, which disrupted a congressional session called to count the electoral votes formalizing President Biden\\u2019s victory.\", \"Mr. Thompson contrasted Mr. Clark\\u2019s refusal to cooperate with the actions of Jeffrey A. Rosen, who was acting attorney general during the Trump administration, and previously sat for a lengthy interview with the committee.\", \"\\u201cHis refusal to answer questions about the former president\\u2019s attempt to use the Department of Justice to overturn the election is in direct contrast to his supervisors at the department,\\u201d Mr. Thompson said in a statement. \\u201cIt\\u2019s astounding that someone who so recently held a position of public trust to uphold the Constitution would now hide behind vague claims of privilege by a former president, refuse to answer questions about an attack on our democracy and continue an assault on the rule of law.\\u201d\", \"Mr. MacDougald\\u2019s letter argued that Mr. Clark had nothing to do with the events of Jan. 6.\", \"\\u201cHe has informed me he worked from home that day to avoid wrestling with potential street closures to get to and from his office at Main Justice,\\u201d the letter said. \\u201cNor did Mr. Clark have any responsibilities to oversee security at the Capitol or have the ability to deploy any Department of Justice personnel or resources there.\\u201d\", \"But the Senate Judiciary Committee said in a recent report there was credible evidence that Mr. Clark was involved in other efforts to interrupt the peaceful transfer of power, citing his proposal to deliver a letter to state legislators in Georgia and others encouraging them to delay certification of election results.\", \"The Senate committee also said Mr. Clark recommended holding a news conference announcing that the Justice Department was investigating allegations of voter fraud, in line with Mr. Trump\\u2019s repeated demands, despite a lack of evidence of any fraud. Both proposals were rejected by senior leaders in the department.\", \"The New York Times reported in January that Mr. Clark also discussed with Mr. Trump a plan to oust Mr. Rosen, and wield the department\\u2019s power to force state lawmakers in Georgia to overturn its presidential election results. Mr. Clark denied the report, which was based on the accounts of four former Trump administration officials who asked not to be named because of fear of retaliation.\", \"Mr. Clark\\u2019s subpoena is one of 19 issued by the committee. The panel has interviewed more than 150 witnesses so far, according to a person with knowledge of its activities.\"]","href_hash":"b871241c3ea511eca0264904af9fb682"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b871241c3ea511eca0264904af9fb682"}},
