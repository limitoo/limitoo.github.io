With Carlos Correa hinting he might leave, there is no telling what the team might look like next season.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-04T02:22:04.000Z","content":"[\"HOUSTON \\u2014 Dusty Baker talked eloquently over the weekend about how this particular group of Houston Astros was gritty and battle-tested. After a win in Atlanta pulled the team to within three games to two in this World Series, he and star shortstop Carlos Correa both spoke of this team\\u2019s knack for dramatic comebacks.\", \"The harsh reality is, Houston also has plenty of unwanted experience the other way. The Astros now have played in three World Series in the past five years, but in getting trounced, 7-0, in Game 6 on Tuesday night, the Astros have lost two of those three. Making it sting even more, Washington clinched the 2019 title at Houston\\u2019s Minute Maid Park, and Atlanta danced on their field this week.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s tough, big time,\\u201d Baker said after watching Atlanta pitchers hold his Astros to a .224 batting average and .298 on-base percentage during the series and seeing Atlanta out-homer Houston by 11-2. \\u201cThey played great. We couldn\\u2019t keep them in the ballpark. We walked somebody, then that led to the crooked-number innings. The pitching shut us down.\\u201d\", \"Baker congratulated his counterpart, Brian Snitker, the team and the city of Atlanta. He talked about how \\u201cyou\\u2019ve got to keep on trucking, and that gives you even more incentive next year.\\u201d Winters are never easy, but this one comes with particular complications in Houston.\", \"The Astros this year were booed relentlessly and could not outrun the cheating scandal that always will hover over their one World Series title, in 2017. Some contended they needed to win another title so that their core group of Correa, Jose Altuve, Alex Bregman and Yuli Gurriel would earn back some semblance of legitimacy for their achievements. Correa said he did not see it that way, eschewing the \\u201coutside noise.\\u201d Instead, he offered another defense of his team as Tuesday night turned into Wednesday morning.\", \"\\u201cSecond place is not good enough for us,\\u201d Correa said. \\u201cI know it\\u2019s not good enough for you guys. But it speaks volumes of how good our organization, our talent in the clubhouse is. Five A.L.C.S.\\u2019s in a row, three World Series in five years. I mean, I don\\u2019t know what else you want to ask from a great ball club.\\u201d\", \"Immediate questions surround the future of both Correa and Baker. Neither the star shortstop nor the manager are signed for next year. When he stepped to the plate in the ninth inning against Atlanta\\u2019s closer, Will Smith, Correa acknowledged that he was focused on what he knew could be his farewell.\", \"\\u201cIt was the only thing going through my mind, to be honest,\\u201d said Correa, who took two strikes, then a ball, then lined out to right fielder Adam Duvall. \\u201cA lot of feelings, mixed emotions. I spent seven years with this club. Yeah, it was going through my mind for sure.\\u201d\", \"Correa is one formal filing away from free agency. He thanked the Astros owner Jim Crane and the front office for respecting his wishes not to negotiate during the season, but realistically, the odds of him returning are slim. The largest contract the Astros have executed since Crane purchased the team in 2011 was the five-year, $151 million extension signed by Altuve in 2018. With Francisco Lindor banking $341 million over 10 years with the Mets, the price for Correa is likely to stretch well beyond Houston\\u2019s comfort zone.\", \"In some ways, Correa, a two-time All Star and 2015 A.L. Rookie of the Year, sounded as if he was offering a valedictory address.\", \"\\u201cTo the fans, I want to say thank you for your support,\\u201d Correa said. \\u201cMy time here was amazing, the seven greatest years of my life. I got here as a boy, turned into a man, grew in this city and the fans embraced me.\\u201d\", \"For Baker, 72, this was another bitter loss. Though he is a three-time manager of the year and has led his teams to 1,987 victories \\u2014 12th on the career list \\u2014 this is the second time he has guided a team to the World Series and lost it. In 2002, his San Francisco Giants led the then-Anaheim Angels three games to two before losing.\", \"\\u201cI think you get over it,\\u201d Baker said. \\u201cOther people don\\u2019t let you get over it. And other people don\\u2019t get over it. To me, we did all we could to get to this point.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cQuite frankly, this one doesn\\u2019t hurt quite as much as the first one did because the first one, I thought we had that won, you know what I mean? More than this one.\\u201d\", \"Baker also has had a run of bad luck to fall just short of the World Series. His 2003 Chicago Cubs were within five outs of the N.L. pennant when a foul ball in the stands, the infamous Steve Bartman play, derailed their season. In his two seasons managing the Washington Nationals, his teams won 95 and 97 games, each earning the N.L. East title. Yet he was fired.\", \"In Houston, he maneuvered the Astros to within one win of the A.L. pennant during the pandemic-shortened 2020 season before losing Game 7 to Tampa Bay. Then this.\", \"\\u201cI feel bad. I feel terrible because I\\u2019m not really ready to go home,\\u201d Baker said. \\u201cI haven\\u2019t been home since I left in February, so you know I must love these guys and love what I\\u2019m doing. I mean, when\\u2019s the last time you weren\\u2019t home? It\\u2019s dang near, I looked on the calendar today and it\\u2019s almost Thanksgiving.\\u201d\", \"Baker made it clear he hopes he is back because, after this loss, he said, he\\u2019s \\u201cstill got some unfinished business.\\u201d\", \"If he is back, it will be with a team that most likely will be significantly altered. Correa\\u2019s return is in doubt. The ace Justin Verlander, who missed all season after having Tommy John surgery, is a free agent. So, too, are the starter Zack Greinke and the key relievers Kendall Graveman, Brooks Raley and Yimi Garcia.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019d be sad, but like I said, he\\u2019s not a free agent yet,\\u201d Jose Altuve said of Correa\\u2019s possible departure, adding, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t lost my hopes.\\u201d\", \"Bregman, too, lobbied for the Astros to do what it takes to keep Correa.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s one of the smartest baseball players in the world,\\u201d said Bregman, who badly struggled in this World Series, batting just .095 (2 for 21) with two R.B.I. and no home runs. \\u201cAnd he\\u2019s one of the hardest working. He eats, sleeps and breathes the game. It\\u2019s been honestly amazing to play with him.\\u201d\", \"The seasons are long and the endings, for the nine teams who play in the postseason and leave it off a loss, are harsh. Summers come with no guarantees, and after playing in the A.L.C.S. in five consecutive seasons and winning only one World Series, it was difficult enough for the Astros to believe that they wouldn\\u2019t be forcing Atlanta into a Game 7 on Wednesday.\", \"\\u201cI mean, it really hurts,\\u201d Baker said. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s over.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"fd0fdb483d5811ecb8de000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fd0fdb483d5811ecb8de000017025a03"}},
