He is giving it all of his proceeds to the National Museum of American Jewish History, a Smithsonian-affiliated institution in Philadelphia that recently emerged from bankruptcy.\", \"For the museum \\u2014 whose collection includes the piano on which Irving Berlin wrote \\u201cAlexander\\u2019s Ragtime Band\\u201d and one of Albert Einstein\\u2019s pipes \\u2014 Weitzman\\u2019s money is more than a lifeline. The museum will spend $10 million to buy its building, which had been sold to a former trustee\\u2019s family and leased back for $1,000 a month.\", \"The rest will go toward an endowment. Weitzman said the result would be that the museum could operate \\u201cdebt-free and rent-free, so everything it pays attention to will be for itself and not for trying to stay afloat.\\u201d\", \"The museum is responding by changing its name to the Weitzman National Museum of American Jewish History. It will make the new name official on Monday, the last day of Hanukkah, although Misha Galperin, the museum\\u2019s chief executive, shared the news early in a post on the eJewish Philanthropy website.\", \"Weitzman, who turned 80 in July, said before the auction that he planned to give away the proceeds. He described the sale as a form of estate planning, unloading one-of-a-kind items he had collected over 20 years that he believed would have enduring value. But he said his children did not want to inherit them and, as he put it, \\u201cNo one takes a U-Haul to the cemetery.\\u201d\", \"The museum had been preoccupied with financial problems for the past decade \\u2014 since it completed its $150 million building on Independence Mall, a short walk from Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell Center. For the five-story building, the museum took out a $35 million construction loan, Galperin said. The museum had counted on fund-raising to pay it off, he said, but as the financial crisis of 2008 deepened, donations slowed.\", \"\\u201cFor the next 10 years, they were servicing that debt, running out of cash,\\u201d said Galperin, who was brought in as a consultant in 2019 and became chief executive last year. \\u201cThe museum was in serious financial trouble.\\u201d\", \"Roughly $30 million in debt at the beginning of 2020, it filed for bankruptcy on March 1, before the pandemic hit. Then the museum closed down. \\u201cNo revenue,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand because we were in bankruptcy, we weren\\u2019t eligible for federal assistance under PPP,\\u201d the federal paycheck protection program. The museum laid off 25 employees, two-thirds of its staff.\", \"It emerged from bankruptcy in September with a plan that essentially eliminated the debt. Some $17 million was owed to banks. That amount was reduced to $10.5 million after negotiations and was paid off by the deal for the building and some donations. Another $14 million was owed to a group of current and past supporters, among them the philanthropist Sidney Kimmel. Galperin said they forgave that money.\", \"Galperin said that Mitchell Morgan, whose family bought the building and leased it back, had given the museum three and a half years to devise a long-term plan, a timeline that Galperin called \\u201cenough of a runway to figure out what to do next.\\u201d\", \"Weitzman was already acquainted with the museum before Galperin approached him in September. Weitzman had donated $1 million in 2018 for a gallery about Jews who settled in American in the 17th century.\", \"Weitzman said Galperin was straightforward, mentioning what Weitzman had said about giving away the money from the auction. \\u201cHe said, \\u2018This is our goal. We want our building back. We don\\u2019t want to get kicked out in a couple of years. We need someone or some people to secure our future,\\u2019\\u201d Weitzman recalled. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s what I did.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"31af5ba653c211ec837b352508947485"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"31af5ba653c211ec837b352508947485"}},
