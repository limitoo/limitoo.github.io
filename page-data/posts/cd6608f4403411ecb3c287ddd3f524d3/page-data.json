When it's actually much more likely that there's shades of grey through all of this and for many people, pushing political messages online in a very loud and co-ordinated way, it may actually be that they don't have any sort of coherent political ideology.\\\"\", \"Stepping away from the computer and reaching out to people was key.\", \"\\\"Engage in conversations with people and try to understand where they are coming from and treat them as if their concerns are sincerely held and are coming from a place of pro-social concern,\\\" Barraclough said.\", \"But what could not be ignored was the minority of nefarious bad-faith actors trying to drive such debate, he said.\", \"Social media platforms had more work to do to address the discourse they were allowing, but no one should expect or want them to act as the arbiters of free speech, he said.\", \"Hannah said while bots were not behind the torrent of comments on Facebook livestreams, they were still playing a role in proliferating misinformation.\", \"\\\"We did observe a couple of weeks ago that a petition that was started by a New Zealand-based organisation on Change.org around vaccine mandates very quickly got picked up by different foreign language Twitter accounts who were retweeting it at volume, which really did suggest a bot farm.\\\"\", \"University of Auckland Business School associate professor Arvind Tripathi said misinformation was not new as rumour and innuendo had always existed.\", \"But social media had allowed for misinformation on steroids with the platform's own algorithms facilitating that, he said.\", \"\\\"So with the social media algorithm the idea is that the things that you like or comment on or that you show you have a preference for, they will bombard you with more of those things,\\\" Tripathi said.\", \"Barraclough put it another way: \\\"People need to understand that what they're seeing on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube is not a representative picture of what everyone is saying or thinking.\", \"\\\"The platforms use AI recommender systems that mean that they will mainly show you what they think you want to see.\", \"\\\"Social media isn't like a window to look outside, it's more like having someone bring you things they think you want to see.
