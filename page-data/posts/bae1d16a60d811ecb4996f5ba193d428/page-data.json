I just can't. I've tried everything humanly possible. I can't get there,\\\" Manchin told \\\"Fox News Sunday.\\\"\", \"\\\"This is a no on this piece of legislation. I have tried everything I know to do,\\\" he added.\", \"Manchin has been central to talks over the legislation for months, and his support for the bill is crucial to its passage in the evenly divided Senate. Over the summer, Manchin convinced Mr. Biden and Democratic leaders to scale back their $3.5 trillion initial proposal, setting a $1.75 trillion limit on spending he would be willing to support.\", \"But talks\\u00a0broke down over the past week, particularly over the child tax credit, which is set to expire at the end of the year. Manchin was pushing for the price tag for the tax credit to span 10 years, which would have constituted the bulk of the spending in the package.\", \"Last week, Mr. Biden sounded confident he could craft a deal with Manchin that would satisfy congressional Democrats. \\\"It takes time to finalize these agreements, prepare the legislative changes, and finish all the parliamentary and procedural steps needed to enable a Senate vote,\\\" the president said in a statement last Thursday.\", \"Manchin's withdrawal of support is a blow to progressive Democrats, who agreed to pass Mr. Biden's $1 trillion infrastructure plan earlier in the fall with the expectation that Manchin would back the Build Back Better Act.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"bae1d16a60d811ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bae1d16a60d811ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
