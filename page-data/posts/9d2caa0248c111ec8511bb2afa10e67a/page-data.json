For example, take the expansion of Medicare and Medicaid. Rural Americans are statistically older, sicker, heavier and poorer than their urban counterparts. Moreover, Covid killed rural patients at twice the rate of urban ones.\", \"But it\\u2019s a fair debate whether those policies truly benefit the patients they are intended to help. It\\u2019s also an open question to what extent Democrats are willing to fight for these rural voters, especially as the party\\u2019s social priorities diverge from the average rural American\\u2019s. But in the handful of swing states that historically determine national elections, the decision to ignore rural voters comes at a high cost.\", \"Mark E.

We are business owners, employees, farmers, teachers, entrepreneurs, students, retirees from all walks of life, deer hunters and vegans.\", \"We work hard for worthy Democratic candidates in the many state and local elections between the presidential spectacles. But we also help with the nonpartisan work of local government and community organizations in the county\\u2019s many small towns and smaller villages.\", \"If Mr. Brooks comes on the Fourth of July, he can join us in the annual parade, in pickup trucks and on foot, waving flags and singing \\u201cI\\u2019m a Yankee Doodle Dandy\\u201d and other patriotic favorites until our voices are hoarse and our guitar strings break.\", \"Michael French SmithHonor, Mich.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cRepublican Censured by a Divided House for a Violent Video\\u201d (news article, Nov. 18):\", \"So what that Representative Paul Gosar was censured? He gets to remain a congressman. Anyone in any other organization would be summarily fired for a similar stunt. He is unrepentant after the vote, going so far as to retweet the animated video of him killing Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and assaulting the president.\", \"He no doubt plans to act the martyr, wearing his censure like a badge of honor, designed to stir his angry constituents to re-elect him by an even greater margin.\", \"I don\\u2019t know what the bigger scandal is, whether it\\u2019s Mr. Gosar\\u2019s actions or the virtual lock step support given him by the rest of his party, with Kevin McCarthy leading the way, pointing the finger at Democrats with sanctimonious false equivalencies that are Republicans\\u2019 stock in trade.\", \"But the underlying problem is Mr. Gosar\\u2019s supporters in Arizona.

In other words, she was treated as if she were a potential presidential assassin.\", \"Yet Kathy Griffin is a comedian.
