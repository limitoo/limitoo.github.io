These episodes capture the show’s brand of boundary-pushing satire.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-26T10:17:57.000Z","content":"[\"\\u201cIt\\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\\u201d is one of the most successful comedies in TV history, but it isn\\u2019t for everyone.\", \"The show has obviously done something right \\u2014 its upcoming 15th season, debuting Wednesday on FXX, will make it the longest-running live-action sitcom in U.S. television history. But fans of today\\u2019s gentler comedies, like \\u201cSchitt\\u2019s Creek\\u201d and \\u201cTed Lasso,\\u201d will find little optimism or redemption in \\u201cSunny.\\u201d They won\\u2019t even find much character growth.\", \"What they will find is a brilliant ensemble of self-centered neurotics who somehow manage to be likable, despite their best efforts. (Think \\u201cSeinfeld,\\u201d if everyone were stupider and worked in a South Philly Irish pub.) The show, which is available to stream on Hulu, has at times been called offensive. Its creator, Rob McElhenney, calls it \\u201csatirizing ignorance.\\u201d If you aren\\u2019t yet familiar, here are five great episodes (technically six) that should give you the overall flavor \\u2014 somewhere between a delicious Jim\\u2019s cheesesteak and a beer with a cigarette butt in it.\", \"Season 4, Episodes 5-6\", \"Spoiler alert: Mac and Charlie, two of the show\\u2019s main characters (played by McElhenney and Charlie Day, an executive producer), do not die in this two-parter. They do, however, fake their deaths in order to avoid being murdered by Mac\\u2019s jailbird father (Gregory Scott Cummins). It\\u2019s a long story. \\u201cFirst step,\\u201d Mac warns Charlie, \\u201cdo not douse yourself with lighter fluid.\\u201d Step 2 involves removing a lot of Charlie\\u2019s teeth.\", \"Season 4, Episode 13\", \"A longtime fan favorite, this episode follows the rehearsal and performance of a stage musical written by Charlie, who is generally relegated to doing \\u201cCharlie Work.\\u201d (\\u201cBasement stuff,\\u201d as he once described it. \\u201cCleaning urinals, blood stuff, your basic slimes, your sludges \\u2014 anything dead or decaying, I\\u2019m on it.\\u201d) That\\u2019s probably with good reason; his musical\\u2019s many terrible double entendres suggest a flair for the kind of unintentional offensiveness that would get him fired from most other jobs.\", \"Season 5, Episode 10\", \"Dennis (Glenn Howerton) is the gang\\u2019s Lothario, whose depravity is matched only by his arrogance. But just in case, he has designed a program, \\u201ca careful, systemic approach that has allowed me to become the playboy that I am today.\\u201d \\u201cYou\\u2019re a complete sociopath!\\u201d his sister, Dee (Kaitlin Olson), exclaims in horror. As is often the case, she speaks for the audience as the show knowingly eviscerates its male characters\\u2019 macho toxicity.\", \"Season 6, Episode 13\", \"This hourlong special finds the gang determined to live in the holiday spirit but thwarted by ghosts of Christmas past. The episode includes several of the most memorable moments in Sunnydom, including a scene in which Frank (Danny DeVito) sews himself into a leather couch. There\\u2019s also a bloody animated spoof of Rankin-Bass Christmas specials, involving chain-saw dismemberment, a meat grinder and a singing group of racist California Raisins.\", \"Season 7, Episode 7\", \"In what is probably a meta moment reflecting the frustrations of brainstorming another new plot, the gang undertakes a game of its own making that includes stoppage time for injuries, a level devoted to \\u201cemotional battery and public humiliation\\u201d and a lot of drinking. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about to get real dark, real quick,\\u201d Dee says, before the game devolves into a frenzy of absurdity and nihilism.
