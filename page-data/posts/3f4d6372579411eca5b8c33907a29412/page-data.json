White House press secretary Jen Psaki said during a conference that U.S. athletes will still be able to attend, but that they hold a \\\"fundamental commitment to promoting human rights\\\" and thus will not send representatives. This move comes as the two countries are attempting to work together to curb climate change.\", \"The U.S. and human rights organizations have accused the country of a multitude of crimes, including suppressing elections in Hong Kong and enacting human rights violations against Muslim Uyghurs, the AP reported. China has denied all such allegations.\", \"However, they are criticizing the U.S. for their decision to pull potential diplomatic figures from the games. The country's United Nations mission referred to the boycott as a \\\"self-directed political farce,\\\" while the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said that \\\"no one would care about whether these people come or not\\\" in a tweet.\", \"As for the country itself, Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said that the country will take appropriate action against the boycott, saying it \\\"seriously violates the principle of political neutrality of sports established by the Olympic Charter and runs counter to the Olympic motto 'more united.'\\\"\", \"\\\"China has emphasized time and again that no one should imagine they could ask China to understand and support them in bilateral and global affairs when they blatantly interfere in China's domestic affairs and undermine China's interests,\\\" Zhao said at the time. \\\"We hope the U.S. can create favorable conditions for coordination and cooperation with China in major areas.\\\"\", \"It is currently unknown which representatives that the U.S. originally planned to send.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946847/beijing-2022.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">U.S. announced a diplomatic boycott of the games due to human rights violations.

The games are set to open on February 4, 2022.</div>\", \"Rights groups have pushed for a full-blown boycott of the games, accusing China of rights abuses against ethnic minorities. The U.S. decision falls short of those calls but comes at an exceptionally turbulent time for relations between the powerhouse nations and was met with a barrage of criticism from China.\", \"The U.S. is attempting to interfere with the Beijing Games \\\"out of ideological prejudice and based on lies and rumors,\\\" said Zhao.\", \"Other major countries have yet to say if they will follow the American lead.\", \"Zhao warned the U.S. to \\\"stop politicizing sports\\\" and cease what he said were actions undermining the Beijing Winter Olympics, \\\"otherwise it will undermine the dialogue and cooperation between the two countries in a series of important areas and international issues.\\\"\", \"Even the ruling Communist Party's notoriously opaque Central Commission for Discipline Inspection issued a response in the form of a lengthy screed on its website entitled \\\"The Spirit of the Olympic Charter Cannot be Tarnished.\\\"\", \"\\\"Some Western anti-China politicians\\\" have shown a \\\"defensive Cold War mentality aimed at politicizing sport,\\\" the article said, calling that a \\\"clear violation of the Olympic spirit and a challenge to all people who love the Olympic movement.\\\"\", \"People on the streets of Beijing were overall dismissive of the U.S. move.\", \"\\\"I don't think it matters at all if they would come or not.
