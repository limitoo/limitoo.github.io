Iger was a humble weatherman. He started his career in 1973 at a cable station in Ithaca, N.Y., where his duties involved standing in front of a map and doing that awkward talking-into-space thing while reciting temperatures.\", \"On Thursday, he went out the way he came in.\", \"\\u201cThere is light rain falling across the Southland this morning, expected to get just a little bit heavier as the jay \\u2014 day \\u2014 progresses,\\u201d Mr. Iger said on an early-morning KABC newscast in Los Angeles, standing in unannounced for the station\\u2019s usual weather guru, Leslie Lopez. \\u201cHowever, this is just a prelude to a big storm.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Iger, who will retire on Dec. 31, is typically movie-star smooth. But he was a little stiff as he stood sideways and read off the KABC teleprompter. Jitters? Harder than it looks?\", \"Then he relaxed, even tossing in a few charismatic ad-libs.\", \"\\u201cVery nippy on Saturday morning by the way \\u2014 62 degrees in the Los Angeles area,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe beaches, near where I live? Ooh, 46 degrees on Saturday morning. That\\u2019s when I bike ride. I think I\\u2019m going to have to watch out for some early-morning frost!\\u201d\", \"Ms. Lopez, who was standing just off screen, and Leslie Sykes, KABC\\u2019s longtime morning news anchor, rushed over to congratulate him at the end of the segment. \\u201cYou did great!\\u201d they both shouted. They continued to gush until Scott Reiff, a reporter, cut in from a helicopter.\", \"\\u201cAll right, I think we have to go to traffic here,\\u201d Mr. Reiff said. KABC is owned by Disney.\", \"Mr. Iger, 70, was 23 when he last did the weather. He was something of a flop, lasting only a year. But the experience was transformative. As he wrote in \\u201cThe Ride of a Lifetime,\\u201d his 2019 business memoir, \\u201cThat year of toiling in obscurity (and performing with mediocrity) convinced me to abandon the dream I\\u2019d had since I was 15 years old \\u2014 to be a network news anchorman.\\u201d\", \"He has joked in interviews over the years that giving the residents of Ithaca their daily weather report left him with a useful skill. \\u201cIt taught me how to give people really bad news,\\u201d he said in 2019 while promoting his book. \\u201cIt\\u2019s Memorial Day. It\\u2019s going to rain all weekend.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"52458340591211ecac7f3b05c8d33227"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"52458340591211ecac7f3b05c8d33227"}},
