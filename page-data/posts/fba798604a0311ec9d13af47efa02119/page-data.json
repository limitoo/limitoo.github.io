If you don\\u2019t already receive the daily newsletter, sign up here.\", \"Ray Dalio made his name by predicting the financial crisis of 2008. He has built the world\\u2019s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, with some $223 billion under management. He has also become something of a public intellectual and life coach, advocating a particular style of management he describes as \\u201cradical transparency.\\u201d\", \"In two weeks, his third book in five years, \\u201cThe Changing World Order,\\u201d will be published. It is an attempt to better understand the current economic environment and the challenges that it presents by delving into centuries of economic ups and downs.\", \"The book is a provocative read for those of us questioning where in the arc of history the American Empire resides and what may happen to the economy next. There are few tomes that coherently map such broad economic histories as well as Mr. Dalio\\u2019s. Perhaps more unusually, Mr. Dalio has managed to identify metrics from that history that can be applied to understand today. He examined four empires: the Dutch, British, American and Chinese.\", \"He writes that each followed almost the exact same path:\", \"Today, Mr. Dalio is most concerned about the end of the American Empire and the beginning of another Chinese Empire, a transition he believes could lead to war. He writes that Americans misunderstand the Chinese and their own place in history.:\", \"He believes any attempt by the United States to control or change China will only backfire:\", \"Ultimately he concludes that \\u201cIf the US continues to decline and China continues to rise, what matters most is whether or not each can do so gracefully.\\u201d\", \"I spoke to Mr. Dalio by video call, and he acknowledged that before doing the research, he \\u201creally didn\\u2019t have much of an understanding of the connection with internal conflicts, external conflicts, the cost of war \\u2014 financial and nonfinancial \\u2014 and the impact of nature.\\u201d\", \"He was particularly shocked by the role of natural disasters on economies. \\u201cNature, meaning climate, it was surprising to me \\u2014 that it caused more revolutions and more deaths and wars and depressions,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Dalio said he\\u2019s not a pessimist. \\u201cI\\u2019m not trying to be fatalistic,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI am trying to give that arc. I\\u2019m trying to get measurements that are objective.\\u201d\", \"When asked to name a comparable period in history that ended well, Mr. Dalio pointed to the late 1960s, during the Vietnam War and the War on Poverty, when the value of the dollar was decreasing and inflation was increasing rapidly. \\u201cWe got through that with adjustments,\\u201d he said, \\u201cthough we didn\\u2019t have an external power that was as strong as China.\\u201d\", \"Another point of optimism, he said, is that \\u201cthe worst case doesn\\u2019t affect most people as badly as it sounds when you read it.\\u201d He cited the Great Depression as an example. \\u201cMost people remained employed, and going through the wars, most people remained alive.\\u201d\", \"Still, he is not convinced that central bankers can solve current challenges such as supply chain shortages and inflation, which is one of the reasons that he has become intrigued by cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin.\", \"He said one of the superpowers of the central bank is that most people don\\u2019t understand the relationship between monetary policy and the value of their money.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019ll be hidden,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople will look at how much they\\u2019re worth in nominal dollars, not in inflation-adjusted dollars. So they\\u2019ll say, \\u2018I\\u2019m safe,\\u2019 as they will lose 4, 5, 7 percent per year.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Dalio is convinced that if people better understood this and understood the various cycles of economies, their outcomes would be better and crises would be easier to avert.\", \"\\u201cI have a principle: If you worry, you don\\u2019t have to worry. And if you don\\u2019t worry, you have to worry.\\u201d\", \"What do you think?
