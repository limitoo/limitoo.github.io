A morning stroll near his building, in Ridgewood, Queens, did not offer up anything with the kind of Wilsonian surreality the show specializes in \\u2014 but our destination, a dollar store Wilson described as one of his favorites, did. He told me that he spends a lot of time in dollar stores when he has writer\\u2019s block. Nearby he pointed out a display of tools from Trisonic, a budget brand he investigated in a 2016 short film, before collecting the things he\\u2019d come for: sink strainers, a miniature folding chair, a toilet seat with a fluffy white Pomeranian printed on its lid. On the way to the checkout, he marveled at a product he said he\\u2019d already purchased from a different dollar store: a clock radio with a built-in fish tank far too tiny for a fish, a \\u201ccool dollar-store-only object.\\u201d The entire place suddenly felt like a tidy analogue of Wilson\\u2019s show: filled with things too mundane, too accidentally strange, too tacky or sad or flawed or lacking in panache, to actively star in anyone else\\u2019s account of the world.\", \"\\u201cHow To,\\u201d now in its second season, is (nominally) a tutorial, offering advice on subjects like wine appreciation and parking, and (formally) a documentary, following its themes to a bowling-\\u200bball factory or to interview a teenage real estate agent \\u2014 and (ultimately) a form of memoir, a personal essay on video. But Wilson does magic with his staggering archive of street footage, all full of details that, if you encountered them yourself, you\\u2019d ponder for days: peculiar behaviors, dreamlike coincidences, strange omens and general \\u201cglitches in the Matrix,\\u201d as he puts it. Two workers mop a sidewalk in balletic unison; a man in a parked car idly sucks a woman\\u2019s toes; a woman places a live pigeon in a Duane Reade bag like a salad she\\u2019ll finish later. \\u201cSharing your most intimate thoughts can be a disturbing and messy experience,\\u201d Wilson observes, as we watch a police officer pluck a sweater from a pool of blood on a subway floor. It would take a lot of footage to craft a timeline of romance from images of people publicly flirting, groping, proposing, marrying and bickering, and even more to end it with paramedics removing a corpse from an apartment building. Imagine the volume you\\u2019d need to be able to end it, as Wilson does, with paramedics dropping that body.\", \"There are highbrow precedents for Wilson\\u2019s close attention to the strange-and-ordinary, but what \\u201cHow To\\u201d often resembles is the stuff you\\u2019d see posted to Twitter or TikTok in 20-second chunks, with glib captions about urban living or relatable moods. Wilson, who is 35, says that he loves seeing that kind of stuff online \\u2014 \\u201cbut I find it so tragic that it just kind of disappears.\\u201d He\\u2019d always felt compelled to build something larger from that material, lest it vanish into a \\u201cformless blob of content\\u201d or rot on an old hard drive. \\u201cThe impulse to make the work like this to begin with,\\u201d he says, \\u201cwas about giving a shape to all the stuff I was afraid of losing.\\u201d\", \"People talk about television\\u2019s capacity for novelistic depth, but surely the medium has more in common with pop music: We expect it to obey certain rhythms, resolve its motion in certain ways, pulse appealingly in the background even when our attention is divided. Part of what\\u2019s bewitching about \\u201cHow To\\u201d is the extent to which it manages to replace those conventions with its own. \\u201cI get so bored watching something when I begin to realize the pattern,\\u201d Wilson tells me. Each of his episodes contains at least one moment in which you can scarcely believe the turn things have taken. The very first \\u2014 \\u201cHow To Make Small Talk,\\u201d which aired in October 2020 \\u2014 leads Wilson from collecting a sweater from an ex to a vacation in Canc\\u00fan, where he discovers MTV filming spring-break content; there he meets Chris, a weary-eyed party bro who eventually reveals that he came here in the wake of a friend\\u2019s suicide and is processing his grief in the least reflective environment imaginable. It\\u2019s one of a few remarkable turns in the episode. What\\u2019s more astonishing is that you might, watching it, have one of those rare TV experiences when you realize all the typical rhythms have fallen away, and what you\\u2019re watching has become unpredictable and alive \\u2014 and somehow you\\u2019re not sure whether you\\u2019ve been watching it for 15 minutes or 45.\", \"Wilson presents as having lived the life of a middle-class tristate Everyman, only marbled with an obsessiveness that pulls him in deeply weird directions. He was born in Queens, to city natives who soon moved the family to Long Island. One of the first things he told me was that he was grateful for his parents\\u2019 support, in part because he\\u2019d been \\u201ca bit of a tyrant \\u2014 I was just very focused on making my little movies, growing up. Sometimes I would miss family vacations just to finish these pathetic little projects.\\u201d At one point, he says in the show, he made a movie every day. In a first-season episode he reveals a pile of notebooks in which he\\u2019s tracked everything he\\u2019s done each day for more than a decade, a grid of bullet points memorializing the four strips of bacon he ate or a train he took to Union Square.\", \"When he was young, he says in the second season\\u2019s \\u201cHow To Remember Your Dreams,\\u201d his friends wouldn\\u2019t let him play Dungeons & Dragons with them, \\u201cbecause they said I wouldn\\u2019t take it seriously.\\u201d In response, he says, \\u201cI completely rejected fantasy from there on out. I started to only read books about real stuff and became obsessed with the authenticity of documentary filmmaking.\\u201d He struggled to fully enjoy fictional TV and was especially annoyed by things like dream sequences. (We see a shot of a barbershop named the Sopranos.) \\u201cWhile everyone else was going to Comic Con,\\u201d he says (as a man dressed like a wizard exits Washington Square Park), \\u201cI started going on court-TV shows to fill the void\\u201d (a 16-year-old Wilson appears, beaming, at the plaintiff\\u2019s table on an episode of \\u201cThe People\\u2019s Court\\u201d).\", \"He studied film at the State University of New York at Binghamton, where he made a documentary about balloon fetishists. Afterward, in the city, he worked a series of video-related jobs, each disillusioning in its own way: advertising, shooting infomercials, combing through a private investigator\\u2019s surveillance footage or serving as a production assistant for a reality show called \\u201cAmerican Gypsy,\\u201d which offered \\u201cone of the first moments when I was like, this is all fake.\\u201d\", \"The impulse to hoard funny chunks of reality is reflected in Wilson\\u2019s apartment, the same rooms where he films his cat vomiting or his ruined risotto getting flushed down the toilet. (The toilet, he says, is a \\u201cvery underrepresented image\\u201d on TV; he didn\\u2019t think it was weird to flush food down one until his show aired and people commented.) As he was showing me title cards from the series, which he paints on bits of newsprint, I realized that he was surrounded by stuff from the show: a chart of the \\u201cMandela Effect\\u201d explored in the first season; a painting of a relatable amputee from the new \\u201cHow To Throw Out Your Batteries\\u201d; some vintage Ray-O-Vacs from the same episode; he was even wearing a T-shirt from the parking convention in \\u201cHow To Find a Spot.\\u201d A nearby shelf was stocked with those \\u201cbooks about real stuff,\\u201d including Studs Terkel with his interviews of ordinary Americans. Another of Wilson\\u2019s favorites is Susan Orlean\\u2019s \\u201cSaturday Night,\\u201d portraits of how various Americans spend the evening, from 1990. While hiring for his second season, Wilson kept mentioning wanting someone like Susan Orlean, until an HBO executive pointed out that they could probably just ask Susan Orlean, who came on board as a writer.\", \"Wilson told me about his love for the Austrian filmmaker Ulrich Seidl\\u2019s \\u201cIn the Basement\\u201d \\u2014 \\u201cjust a bunch of very slow portraits of people in their basements,\\u201d each space devoted to some unique purpose. He showed me a clip from one of his favorite artists, George Kuchar: \\u201cHe made this series called \\u2018The Weather Diaries,\\u2019 where he would go to this motel in the Midwest every year and try to document extreme weather but then just get really distracted.\\u201d He\\u2019s an admirer of Louis Theroux\\u2019s BBC documentaries, of \\u201cHeavy Metal Parking Lot,\\u201d of the many hits of close documentary attention to how bizarre ordinary life can be.\", \"\\u201cEverything is such a performance these days,\\u201d he said. It\\u2019s not as if Wilson is above using shtick to shape his show \\u2014 his voice-over is a beautiful one, deploying sinus noises and uncomfortable trailings-off to keen effect. But he does seem to have a fear of his reality being distorted. While constructing the show\\u2019s first season, he says, \\u201cI would break down and cry in the edit, just because I felt all these hands trying to shape this thing that was so intensely personal to me.\\u201d Working in advertising, he\\u2019d seen how you could degrade and commercialize someone\\u2019s work. His show\\u2019s format, he hoped, was protection from that \\u2014 at the very least, he joked, he wasn\\u2019t about to be recast with Ryan Seacrest.\", \"If you want to see an Edenic, before-the-fall depiction of American adults, look for clips of Groucho Marx\\u2019s \\u201cYou Bet Your Life\\u201d television broadcasts. They began in 1950, when you could find guests who hadn\\u2019t yet absorbed the norms of televisual behavior, and would present themselves the same way they might have addressed a new neighbor or an Elks lodge. They seem touchingly pure, while Marx, waggling his brows in the midcentury equivalent of \\u201cthat\\u2019s what she said\\u201d jokes, might as well be from the \\u201990s.\", \"The people Wilson features on his show occasionally remind me of those guests. It\\u2019s not that they don\\u2019t understand proper TV behavior; these days we learn that before addition and subtraction. But even successful efforts to replicate it tend to be helped along by editing; Wilson likes to say that on reality TV, if you kept any shot rolling just a few seconds longer, the illusion would be shattered. \\u201cHow To\\u201d is constantly finding people who crackle to life in those extra seconds. It\\u2019s important, Wilson says, to see these unpolished portraits, \\u201cbecause a lot of the stuff we consume makes us feel like we\\u2019re not enough, sometimes. Because we\\u2019re not cheery enough or sharp enough.\\u201d He uses the word \\u201crepresentation\\u201d here \\u2014 the representation of ordinary American ungainliness.\", \"The people he focuses on do trend toward those typically neglected by television. They\\u2019re middle-aged with brusque local accents or wealthy but not in a worldly way; they have some kind of sales patter or nutty theory you\\u2019d normally tune out; they\\u2019re nerdy or goony or oversharers. Sometimes they aren\\u2019t trying to meet the expectations of televisibility; sometimes they\\u2019re trying too hard, and the effort is coming out lopsided. Sometimes they\\u2019re absurdly televisable, as with one Vivian Koenig, a no-nonsense older woman seen giving her husband a theatrical \\u201ccan\\u2019t you see I\\u2019m busy\\u201d gesture that puts America\\u2019s top comics to shame. If TV works like pop music, seeing these humans on it is as recklessly thrilling as seeing Harry Styles pluck a random dad from an arena crowd and hand him a microphone.\", \"It must be exciting, I told Wilson, when amid the countless conversations he records, he realizes he\\u2019s stumbled across a real live one.\", \"\\u201cDo you not feel that,\\u201d he asked, \\u201cwhen you talk to someone that is slowly revealing a cascading story to you, or they don\\u2019t always realize how interesting it is?\\u201d\", \"Most of us, I said, are busy, and cautious, and when a stranger starts opening up about, say, their anti-circumcision concept album, we politely vanish.\", \"\\u201cI do that, too, sometimes,\\u201d Wilson said, \\u201cwhen I don\\u2019t have the time or the camera.\\u201d But when he\\u2019s seeking this stuff out, \\u201cyou can tell immediately if someone wants to be recorded or not. And in that moment, when they give you an inch and you continue talking to them, and you raise the camera a little higher, a little higher, you begin to realize that oh, my God, so many people have a story.\\u201d Often, he told me, he would film someone for an entire day before they even asked what it was for; they just wanted to be recorded.\", \"Holding the camera himself, he says, \\u201cchanges the energy of the room.\\u201d Part of Wilson\\u2019s charm is that he almost never lets this energy provoke a cringe, except at his own expense. That reversal is the point of astonishment in \\u201cHow To Cover Furniture,\\u201d a rumination on how we try to protect things from harm. At its climax, an interior designer answers Wilson\\u2019s questions with a friendly evisceration of his whole vibe: His camera, she says, is a protective mechanism, which he uses to connect with people from behind a barrier. She looks into its lens and offers advice that feels both kind and situationally hostile: \\u201cI would love for you, sometimes in your life, in your head, to be like, \\u2018I should put the camera down in this situation. I should just be John.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"In his 2017 short \\u201cThe Road to Magnasanti,\\u201d Wilson observes that Brooklyn\\u2019s new condos \\u201cwill often decorate their halls with murals of the street, and photos of a New York they\\u2019re trying to replace \\u2014 which may actually end up coming in handy, because soon enough that city will only exist in pictures.\\u201d Preserving the texture of that city is one of Wilson\\u2019s fixations. He chooses wider shots that can \\u201cbasically also act as a photograph, if people need to go back and reference what one corner looked like.\\u201d His prepandemic footage, he says, is very likely \\u201cone of the most comprehensive archives of what New York looked like right before it changed forever.\\u201d\", \"And yet one of the main impressions you get, watching his show, is that New York could hypergentrify itself into one continuous A.T.M. vestibule, or sink under rising oceans, and somehow you\\u2019d still go outside and find its residents, over by the deposit envelopes or oyster beds, doing their casually deranged thing.\", \"Television offers us both a chance to learn about the world around us and a chance to imagine other worlds entirely, but an unsettling amount of programming somehow combines the worst of these possibilities. It takes us to exotic worlds but insists on filling them with familiar narratives; or else it purports to show us reality but makes that reality offensively artificial. Wilson\\u2019s quirks and anxieties \\u2014 the vexed relationship with fiction, the terror of impermanence, the hunger to observe \\u2014 seem to have channeled him toward a lovely alternative. He wanted to be able to make his own entertainment, he told me, because so much around him felt straitjacketed, \\u201ctrying to make different versions of the same thing.\\u201d He seemed sincerely baffled by all the repetition. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know why everyone feels like they need to chase these archetypes a lot of the time,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know why people are so afraid of just, like, doing something new.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a3059f5d574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a3059f5d574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}},
