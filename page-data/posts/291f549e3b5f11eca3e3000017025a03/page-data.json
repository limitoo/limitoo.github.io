Held since 1978, the institution was named by Bloomberg News as the most accurate in the United States during the 2016 presidential election.\", \"Consisting of 1,209 adults, those polled were all above 18 years old, and the questions were given to constituents over the phone in both English and Spanish.\", \"Of the 1,209 polled, 1,032 of them were also registered to vote in the United States.\", \"The poll, held from October 18 to October 22, found that 42 percent of those questioned believed the Democratic Party represented a more pressing threat to democracy, compared to 41 percent who believed the Republican Party was more at fault.\", \"An additional eight percent felt that both parties were of an equal threat to the country, while the remaining nine percent were either unsure or had no opinion.\", \"Naturally, among party lines, both Democrats and the GOP blamed the other party for the issues of democracy that have been seen in recent years, with 87 percent of Democrats blaming Republicans, and 88 percent of Republicans blaming Democrats.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1923905/democratic-donkey-logo.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A new Marist poll has found that more Americans find the Democratic Party to be a bigger threat to democracy than the Republican Party. Here, a donkey, the animal mascot of the Democratic Party, can be seen. </div>\", \"The poll also broke down the results based on a variety of other socioeconomic factors, including household income, education, gender and race.\", \"The majority of those with a post-secondary education believed that the GOP was to blame, with 48 percent of college graduates blaming Republicans compared to only 36 percent who faulted the Democrats.\", \"Among those without a college degree, the results were nearly completed flipped, with 46 percent blaming Democrats and 36 percent blaming Republicans.\", \"Additionally, women significantly felt more out of favor with the Republican Party compared to men, with 47 percent blaming the GOP compared to 35 percent blaming Democrats.\", \"While the majority of white Americans polled faulted the Democratic Party more, minorities overwhelmingly blamed the Republican Party.\", \"About 45 percent of Latinos took issue with the GOP's handling of democracy. Among African-Americans, the disparity was even greater, with 70 percent blaming Republicans compared to only 13 percent blaming Democrats.\", \"The results also landed similarly among people's support for 2020 presidential candidates, with 80 percent of those who had voted for President Joe Biden faulting the Republican Party, and 86 percent of those who had voted for former President Donald Trump faulting the Democratic Party.\", \"While the majority of Americans still believe that elections are free and fair, major pollsters have noted a risk of democratic backsliding in recent years, largely due to unsubstantiated claims of widespread voter fraud.\", \"Rick Hasen, a law professor at the University of California, Irvine, wrote in September that \\\"the United States faces a serious risk that the 2024 presidential election, and other future U.S. elections, will not be conducted fairly, and that the candidates taking office will not reflect the free choices made by eligible voters under previously announced election rules.\\\"\", \"\\\"The conduct of former President Donald J. Trump in repeatedly and falsely claiming that the 2020 election was stolen has markedly raised the potential for an actual stolen election in the United States,\\\" Hasen continued.\"]","href_hash":"291f549e3b5f11eca3e3000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"291f549e3b5f11eca3e3000017025a03"}},
