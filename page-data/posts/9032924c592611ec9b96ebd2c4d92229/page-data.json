I mean, to tackle something of that scale and in a few months to get to a stage where we can drive out it's pretty big so we really appreciate that.\\\"\", \"The road closure meant many of their summer bookings had been cancelled. While people could catch a water taxi, fly or leave their car further down the road, many didn't want to.\", \"Clegg said the couple were desperately trying to keep a positive outlook on their business.\", \"Lynley Perkins Clegg said while the council subsidised air, water taxi and barge services were fantastic but booked out quickly and had limited schedules.\", \"She would love to see the road opened for visitors before next summer.\", \"\\\"It sort of happened in the middle of what I would say was the quiet season, when a lot of the tourism businesses are closed anyway in the Sounds but now coming out of that where it's going to get busy, it's really starting starting to bite the reality of the situation, I think it's really hitting home.\\\"\", \"Dave McFarlane and Dorothy Lewis have been back in their Nopera Bay home for a week.
