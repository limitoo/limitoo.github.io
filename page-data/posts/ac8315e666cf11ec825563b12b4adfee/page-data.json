The staff that are working that will be working out how far they have spit the cherry pit will be fully masked and gloved, all hygiene will be well looked after and they're not actually touching it with their hands.

So it's not actually spitting saliva or anything, they're actually throwing the pit from their mouth out onto the mat.\\\"\", \"Good technique made a difference, Cruickshank-Giles said.\", \"\\\"It's all in the tongue. Those that are really good at it, they've got all the juices off the pit so it's literally just the pit and they're spitting it out by rolling their tongue, and some even do a bit of a run up.\\\"\", \"Most did not practice, instead saving up their pit-spitting prowess for the competition mat.\", \"\\\"In the past, a lot of people that have come along to the event have been holidaying in the area and come along out of curiosity,\\\" Cruickshank-Giles said.\", \"\\\"We normally find it's actually a tourist or a holiday-maker that wins and it's just a talent they didn't realise they had.\", \"\\\"The good side of that is that the trophy gets moved around the country a fair bit.
