Blinken, in a statement on Monday, sharply criticized the test as \\u201crecklessly conducted.\\u201d\", \"The U.S. Space Command said the debris is likely to remain in orbit for years or even decades, adding to a vast array of space junk. A few days before the Russian test, the space station had to dodge debris from a 2007 Chinese weapons test.\", \"\\u201cThe Ministry of Defense of Russia successfully completed a test,\\u201d the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday, in the country\\u2019s first official acknowledgment. \\u201cThe result was the destruction of an inactive Russian space apparatus.\\u201d\", \"The debris cloud, the statement said, posed no risk to the International Space Station, other crewed spaceships or satellites.\", \"Earlier on Tuesday, the deputy chairman of the Russian Parliament\\u2019s committee on defense, Yuri Shvytkin, had denied any test took place. \\u201cThe fantasy of the State Department knows no bounds,\\u201d Mr. Shvytkin said, the Interfax news agency reported. \\u201cRussia is not militarizing space.\\u201d\", \"There was no explanation for the contradictory statements or indication that Russia\\u2019s two cosmonauts on the International Space Station had received advance warning.\", \"Along with two Americans and one German astronaut on board, the Russians took shelter for about two hours on spaceships docked to the station that could return them to earth if needed.\", \"NASA\\u2019s administrator, Bill Nelson, said he had \\u201cno reason to believe\\u201d Russia\\u2019s human spaceflight program was aware of the military missile test. He noted the debris cloud also endangered three astronauts now aboard China\\u2019s Tiangong space station.\", \"The international fallout from the episode spread Tuesday. In a post on Twitter, Florence Parly, France\\u2019s defense minister, did not mention Russia by name but criticized \\u201cvandals\\u201d for polluting outer space.\", \"\\u201cSpace is a common good, that of the 7.7 billion inhabitants of our planet,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSpace vandals have an overwhelming responsibility by generating debris that pollutes and puts our astronauts and satellites in danger.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Parly said the European Union was cleareyed that space was a new \\u201cterritory for conflict.\\u201d\", \"Managing space junk has been a looming problem for years. The Russian test added to an already vast swarm of junk in orbit, including old satellites, parts of rockets and debris from earlier antisatellite weapon tests by China, India and the United States.\", \"The surprise Russian weapons test added to already mounting military tensions throughout Eastern Europe this fall as Belarus has driven migrants toward the Polish border, the United States is conducting a naval drill in the Black Sea and Russia has massed troops along the Ukrainian border.\"]","href_hash":"2201bbea476011ec9170231307a08eec"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2201bbea476011ec9170231307a08eec"}},
