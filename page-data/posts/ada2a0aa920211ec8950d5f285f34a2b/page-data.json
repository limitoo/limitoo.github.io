And it's very sad to even talk about but you have to do it. And it's the proverbial needle in a haystack.\\u00a0\", \"Jonathan Vigliotti: Why are you here today? \", \"Damien Hurt | Volunteer searcher: Really just to support the family. \\u2026 Hopefully we can bring peace to the family.\", \"Jonathan Vigliotti: What drives you to do this for a total stranger, somebody you don't even know?\", \"Keri Park | Volunteer searcher: It felt that it should be a community effort ... you just want closure for this family so much. \\u2026 And that's why we're out here. It's why we keep coming.

He pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and illegal possession of an assault weapon. If convicted, Larry could face up to 25 years to life in prison.\", \"Billy Little: His ego was so damaged by the fact his wife didn't want to be with him anymore and he couldn't handle it. So, he killed her.\", \"Although there is still hope Maya could be found any day, a victim's body is not required to convict someone of murder.\", \"Billy Little: This is one of the strongest circumstantial cases I've ever seen\\u2026 you don't have a body. So what? \\u2026 You don't get to get away with murder because you're good at disposing of bodies.\", \"But Larry maintains Maya left on her own.

She says without a body, the prosecution may be at a disadvantage.\", \"Aleida Wahn: They need strong evidence \\u2026 And the question is what do they have? Do they have something that they're going to bring out in a courtroom that definitely ties Larry to murder?\", \"Those loud bangs recorded on the neighboring security camera may not be proof of anything. An FBI analysis was inconclusive. \\u00a0\", \"Aleida Wahn: They couldn't definitively say those were gunshots because the sound quality was not good enough.\", \"In November 2021, Larry's attorney filed documents with the San Diego Superior Court with more allegations about Maya.\", \"Aleida Wahn: They believe that she had this wild lifestyle, that she was out there having affairs, she's dating different men off the internet \\u2026 that she's drinking excessively, that she's become this completely different person. And so, they're pointing to third party culpability.
