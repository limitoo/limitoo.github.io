Trump\\u2019s possible links to Russia, the indictment presented a lengthy narrative but the direct evidence appeared lean.\", \"The indictment said the lawyer, Michael A. Sussmann, had made a false statement by telling an F.B.I. official that he was not representing a client in presenting the information. Mr. Sussmann, who has pleaded not guilty, has denied saying that. No one else was present and their conversation was not recorded, so the direct and clearly admissible evidence appeared to boil down to one witness.\", \"This week, additional pieces of evidence emerged into public view that were not in the indictment \\u2014 one of which appears to dovetail with the accusation against Mr. Sussmann by the special counsel, John H. Durham, who was appointed during the Trump administration, while several others appear to conflict with it. \", \"The material emerged in court filings and at a status conference before a judge on Wednesday.\", \"It is not clear whether all of the newly disclosed evidence will be admissible. But the jostling between prosecutors and defense lawyers could offer a preview of aspects of the trial, which they said on Wednesday would last about two weeks and Judge Christopher R. Cooper said could begin in May or early June.\", \"While the charge against Mr. Sussmann is narrow, it has received significant political attention in part because Mr. Durham concluded that the Hillary Clinton campaign had helped push the suspicions, which concerned possible secret communications between computer servers associated with Mr. Trump\\u2019s company and the Kremlin-linked Alfa Bank. The F.B.I. decided the suspicions were unfounded.\", \"In accusing Mr. Sussmann of telling the F.B.I. official \\u2014 James A. Baker, then the bureau\\u2019s general counsel \\u2014 that he had no clients, Mr. Durham claimed that Mr. Sussmann was actually representing both a technology executive and the Clinton campaign. Mr. Sussmann, via his lawyers, denied that he told Mr. Baker that he had no client, while maintaining he was there on behalf of only the executive, not the campaign.\", \"One piece of newly disclosed evidence, described in a filing by Mr. Durham\\u2019s team on Tuesday evening, consists of handwritten notes by an F.B.I. lawyer to whom Mr. Baker spoke about the meeting that day. The Durham filing quoted the notes as saying \\u201cno specific client.\\u201d\", \"That evidence is similar to another set of handwritten notes previously cited in the indictment by another F.B.I. official who also spoke to Mr. Baker after the meeting. The indictment quoted those notes as listing Mr. Sussmann\\u2019s name, then a dash, then the name of his law firm, then a dash, and then the words \\u201csaid not doing this for any client.\\u201d\", \"It is not clear whether such notes \\u2014 or testimony by the F.B.I. officials who took them \\u2014 would be admissible at a trial under complex rules of evidence. Those rules generally ban statements made outside court as hearsay, but they make exceptions subject to judges\\u2019 interpretations.\", \"The indictment also said that in February 2017, Mr. Sussmann met with the C.I.A. and conveyed similar and related concerns, citing a post-meeting memorandum by two agency employees that said he was \\u201cnot representing a particular client.\\u201d Mr. Durham portrayed that as showing Mr. Sussmann had repeated a false statement.\", \"But at the hearing on Wednesday, a lawyer for Mr. Sussmann, Sean Berkowitz, cited evidence turned over by the prosecutors last week that muddies that picture by suggesting he may instead have told them he had a client.\", \"Emails by agency personnel ahead of the meeting, Mr. Berkowitz said, included statements like \\u201cSussmann said he represents a client who does not want to be known\\u201d and \\u201cthe plan should be to convince Sussmann that it is in his and his client\\u2019s interest to go to the F.B.I.\\u201d A draft version of the agency\\u2019s post-meeting memo also referred to Mr. Sussmann having a client, he said.\", \"A prosecutor working for Mr. Durham, Andrew DeFilippis, told the judge that \\u201calthough we\\u2019re not, you know, interested in a full factual debate before the court,\\u201d an agency employee had spotted the reference to a client in the draft memo and \\u201ccorrected\\u201d it for the final version. Mr. De Filippis did not address references to a client in the earlier emails.\", \"Those disclosures followed a court filing on Monday by Mr. Sussmann\\u2019s defense team that revealed contradictory things Mr. Baker had said under oath about the key interaction in Justice Department interviews, which Mr. Durham\\u2019s team disclosed to them last week.\", \"In 2019 and 2020 interviews, Mr. Baker recalled the interaction in two different ways that each clashed with the indictment\\u2019s version. In the first, he said Mr. Sussmann told him the cyberexperts who developed the Alfa Bank theory \\u201cwere his clients.\\u201d In the second, he said Mr. Sussmann never said if he was representing anyone and Mr. Baker didn\\u2019t ask, but assumed he had no client.\", \"In the Tuesday court filing, Mr. Durham\\u2019s team accused the defense of \\u201ccherry-picking\\u201d the evidence and putting forward a \\u201cskewed portrayal.\\u201d\", \"The 2019 and 2020 interviews \\u201coccurred years after the events in question, and Mr. Baker made these statements before he had the opportunity to refresh his recollection with contemporaneous or near-contemporaneous notes,\\u201d they said, adding that he had since \\u201caffirmed and then re-affirmed his now-clear recollection of the defendant\\u2019s false statement.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"97276248589111eca8055d9984dbe8fd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"97276248589111eca8055d9984dbe8fd"}},
