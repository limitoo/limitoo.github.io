I try to keep, sort of, the camera to my eye,\\\" she said. \\\"But of course, it was very emotional. First of all, I had just been sprayed with gravel from a mortar round that could have killed us very easily. So I was shaken up, and when we were told that we could run across the street by our security adviser, I ran and I saw this family splayed out and I saw these little moon boots and puffy coat.\\\"\", \"Addario added that, even though she felt it was disrespectful to take the photo, she thought that she had to.\", \"\\\"This is a war crime,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"Addario said that she was in a civilian area at the time, and she believes the attack was intentional.\", \"\\\"They're on the run.
