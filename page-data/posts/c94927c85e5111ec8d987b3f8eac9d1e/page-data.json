In Daniel Raggett\\u2019s bravura production, the mysterious con woman of the play\\u2019s title draws the ambitious techie Ariel into her duplicitous orbit. Playing a fictionalized take on the real fraudster Anna Sorokin, the lauded Princess Diana of \\u201cThe Crown,\\u201d Emma Corrin, proved a stage natural in this West End debut: sleek, stylish and intriguingly dangerous.\", \"Harold Pinter Theater, London\", \"Kit Kat Club, London\", \"This 1966 musical is rarely absent from the London stage for long. But I\\u2019ve seldom seen it so angrily, or movingly, realized as in the production from the fast-rising director Rebecca Frecknall that opened recently at the Kit Kat Club, as the Playhouse Theater has been renamed. The West End venue has been refashioned into a Weimar-era Berlin nightclub, complete with backstage corridors full of dancers, and drinks, that audience members discover on the way to their seats. Jessie Buckley is blistering as the hapless Sally Bowles, and Eddie Redmayne is a sinister and sinuous Emcee. The two reinvent their iconic roles from scratch, and are given robust support by Liza Sadovy and Elliot Levey as the doomed couple at the musical\\u2019s bruised heart.\", \"International Theater Amsterdam\", \"Amid a lean spell for Shakespeare on the London stage, a one-off livestream from Amsterdam during the coronavirus lockdown in February found something current in some time-honored texts. \\u201cRoman Tragedies\\u201d amalgamated Shakespeare\\u2019s three Roman plays \\u2014 \\u201cJulius Caesar,\\u201d \\u201cCoriolanus\\u201d and \\u201cAntony and Cleopatra\\u201d \\u2014 into a riveting six-hour marathon conceived well before its Belgian director, Ivo van Hove, had become a Broadway and West End presence. (The triptych was first performed in 2007.) These studies in political discord and societal discontent found multiple correspondences with the present, not least in the storming of the Capitol in Washington, D.C., the previous month: Democracy is fragile in Shakespeare\\u2019s plays, and it certainly felt so then.\", \"Royal Court Theater, London\", \"At 83, Caryl Churchill shows no sign \\u2014 thank heavens \\u2014 of slowing down or easing up on the adventure and surprise that characterize her work. \\u201cWhat If If Only,\\u201d her latest offering, ran a mere 20 minutes, but without leaving the audience feeling shortchanged. Churchill\\u2019s searching wit and intelligence were evident at every turn, as was the crystalline clarity brought to the play by her frequent director, James Macdonald, and a superb cast headed by John Heffernan and Linda Bassett, playing characters with names like Someone, Future and Present. The potentially cryptic, in their hands, made perfect sense.\", \"Southwark Playhouse, London\", \"Why must seemingly every film become a stage musical? I was beginning to feel I\\u2019d had enough after watching this misbegotten venture, which is adapted from the same novel by Jack Engelhard as the 1993 Robert Redford and Demi Moore movie. The outline remained: A couple is thrown into turmoil when the wife is offered a million dollars to sleep with a smooth-talking man of means, here played by Ako Mitchell. What was missing was any real characterization, motivation or decent music. The production resembled a cruise ship lounge act: appropriate for a show that was entirely at sea.\", \"MC93; Bobigny, France\", \"The first performances of \\u201cWhat Should Men Be Told?\\u201d (\\u201cQue Faut-Il Dire aux Hommes?\\u201d) took place under unusual circumstances. Last January, theaters were still closed in France under coronavirus restrictions \\u2014 they didn\\u2019t reopen until May \\u2014 and to keep artists onstage, some theaters held private daytime performances for industry professionals. This collaboration between the director Didier Ruiz and seven men and women of faith provided unexpected respite from the outside world. All were nonprofessional actors opening up in monologues about their relationship to spirituality, whether they had spent decades in a Dominican cell or found shamanist beliefs late in life. Even to this atheist, the result felt like a soothing meditation.\", \"Com\\u00e9die-Fran\\u00e7aise, Paris\", \"In Stefano Massini\\u2019s \\u201c7 Minutes,\\u201d the director Ma\\u00eblle Po\\u00e9sy found a play that both widens the horizons of the Com\\u00e9die-Fran\\u00e7aise, France\\u2019s oldest and most prestigious theater company, and plays to its strengths. This contemporary blue-collar drama \\u2014 a rarity in the Com\\u00e9die-Fran\\u00e7aise repertoire \\u2014 follows 11 women who fear for their jobs after the textile factory where they work changes hands. They meet to discuss whether they should accept or reject an offer from the new management team, which initially seems too good to be true. The cast, drawn from every generation within the company\\u2019s permanent acting troupe, delivered the debate with passion, nuance and a compelling hint of working-class rebellion.\", \"Le Lucernaire, Paris\", \"The premiere of \\u201cOut of Sweat\\u201d was delayed twice because of the pandemic, but it was worth the wait. The play, by Hakim Bah, won the 2019 Laurent Terzieff-Pascale de Boysson writing prize, created by the Lucernaire theater to encourage new talent and help produce their work. It deftly tells the stories of a handful of characters from an unspecified African country. One woman has already emigrated to France, while another decides to seduce a Frenchman online, abandoning her children and unfaithful husband. Yet \\u201cOut of Sweat,\\u201d co-directed by Bah and Diane Chavelet, is no gritty drama: Each scene is a self-contained work of poetry, carried by the musical lilt in Bah\\u2019s writing. A superb and versatile cast completes this showcase of Black talent.\", \"Avignon Festival\", \"The Italian director Emma Dante has become a regular visitor to the Avignon Festival, and \\u201cMisericordia,\\u201d one of two productions she presented there this year, exemplified her mastery of movement-based theater. In this spare show, three women rally around a mentally disabled young man, Arturo, whose mother has died. Dante gives the characters a larger-than-life physicality to express their frustrations, as money becomes tight and their home life fraught. The back-and-forth gestures and quips among them are meticulously timed, and as Arturo, Simone Zambelli, a trained dancer, anchors every scene, his limbs bending and darting eloquently in bittersweet solo turns.\", \"Teatro Nacional D. Maria II; Lisbon\", \"Gus Van Sant certainly doesn\\u2019t lack confidence. For his first stage production, \\u201cAndy,\\u201d a musical inspired by the life of Andy Warhol, he opted not only to direct but also to write the script, design the sets and compose the music. Predictably, \\u201cAndy,\\u201d which had its premiere as part of Lisbon\\u2019s Biennial of Contemporary Arts, failed on pretty much all counts, with labored pacing, dubious songs and characters that never acquired inner lives. The inexperienced cast valiantly tried to save Van Sant from himself, but this will go down as a lesson in the perils of hiring big names who lack a basic knowledge of stagecraft.\", \"Salzburg Festival / Deutsches Schauspielhaus\", \"The German actress Lina Beckmann gave the performance of the year in this epic Shakespeare mash-up that traces the development of the Bard\\u2019s most bloodthirsty monarch. Selecting carefully from the vast panorama of the eight War of the Roses plays, the director Karin Henkel keeps her staging (seen at both the Salzburg Festival in Austria and the Deutsches Schauspielhaus in Hamburg, Germany) focused and uncluttered despite the large dramatis personae. For much of the lengthy evening, the Houses of Lancaster and York are brought to life by a handful of nimble actresses playing multiple roles. But the production belongs to Beckmann, whose volcanic performance as Richard III is a master class in shape-shifting, dissembling and uncanny persuasion: in other words, in acting itself.\", \"Berliner Ensemble\", \"Robert Wilson\\u2019s legendary production of Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht\\u2019s \\u201cThe Threepenny Opera,\\u201d which ran for over 300 performances at the Berliner Ensemble, was going to be a hard act to follow. If Barrie Kosky, the director of the new production at the theater, where what is Berlin\\u2019s most famous musical premiered in 1928, felt under pressure, his assured staging doesn\\u2019t show it. Kosky\\u2019s bold reimagining scrupulously avoids the Weimar clich\\u00e9s that have hardened around the work over the past 90 years. Working with a flawless cast from the theater\\u2019s acting ensemble, Kosky has produced something full of savage and gleeful menace \\u2014 and the firecracker score has rarely sounded better.\", \"Volksb\\u00fchne Berlin\", \"As Germany slid back into lockdown last winter, the Volksb\\u00fchne forged ahead with a series of new plays, streamed online, exploring ancient Greek drama and myth. The most arrestingly beautiful was the director Claudia Bauer\\u2019s Ovid-inspired \\u201cMetamorphoses (overcoming mankind),\\u201d a hypnotic combination of drama, dance and music whose premiere was one of the most exquisitely filmed digital productions of the pandemic. Seven actors (wearing blank masks) and three musicians imaginatively conjured the magical transformations whereby women become birds and men turn into flowers. At the same time, Bauer used the stories about the porous relationship between humans, nature and the gods to reflect on a range of timeless and contemporary issues, including gender fluidity, toxic masculinity, exploitative capitalism and climate change. \", \"M\\u00fcnchner Kammerspiele; Munich\", \"When I first saw Wolfram Lotz\\u2019s dramatic monologue \\u201cThe Politicians\\u201d (\\u201cDie Politiker\\u201d) embedded in a 2019 reimagining of \\u201cKing Lear,\\u201d I was startled by the verve and inventiveness of this manic, free-associative monologue. In the short time since, Lotz\\u2019s screed has taken on a surprising life of its own in several stand-alone productions throughout Germany and Austria. In Felicitas Brucker\\u2019s concise and furiously paced staging at the M\\u00fcnchner Kammerspiele, three performers give a dazzling rapid-fire delivery of this enigmatic and repetitive text. Clocking in at 65 minutes, \\u201cThe Politicians\\u201d feels like a sustained freak-out: an exhilarating roller coaster of bravura acting and transformative stagecraft, in the service of a distinctively bold (and odd) new dramatic text.\", \"Salzburg Festival\", \"A new staging of Hugo von Hofmannsthal\\u2019s rarely performed \\u201cThe Falun Mine\\u201d was intended to celebrate the Austrian writer who was one of the Salzburg Festival\\u2019s founders, and whose morality play \\u201cJedermann\\u201d is the event\\u2019s perennial favorite. Sadly, Jossi Wieler\\u2019s production, which arrived in the midst of the festival\\u2019s centennial celebrations, was so lackluster that it felt like the opposite of a rediscovery. Indeed, the inert staging was so dreary that one could wish \\u201cThe Falun Mine,\\u201d never performed during Hofmannsthal\\u2019s lifetime, had remained buried. Here\\u2019s hoping some other theater or director can successfully excavate it in the future.\", \"\"]","href_hash":"c94927c85e5111ec8d987b3f8eac9d1e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c94927c85e5111ec8d987b3f8eac9d1e"}},
