Children will get good protection from one dose and it's not ideal to bring the gap further forward, so we recommend it only with children who have got very high-risk medical problems.\", \"\\\"They get a good vigorous immune response. And also the second point is that children are at much lower risk of severe Covid disease. We would be hoping that with a longer gap with your first to your second dose, that you'll get better immunity and more durable immunity.
