Except he had placed himself in a bad situation. At 17 he was barely equipped to handle the responsibility of having a gun in a place of chaos and violence.\", \"And Mr. Rittenhouse did not know how to de-escalate tension. When he felt threatened his solution was to shoot to kill. He could have put down his \\u201ccool\\u201d gun and surrendered after the first incident. But twice more, twice, he shoots to kill. As if that were his only choice.\", \"Three times this boy used what should be the last resort of any thinking person. I am not sure a life in prison would have been the answer. He is just a kid making adult decisions with a kid\\u2019s brain. But he has paid nothing for his actions. The consequences of that will reverberate for years.\", \"Jo TraffordPortland, Maine\", \"To the Editor:\", \"While I understand that self-defense can be tricky for a prosecutor, I thought reckless endangerment, at the very least, might stick. Two people are dead and one maimed, with zero accountability.\", \"Even drunken drivers who didn\\u2019t mean to kill anyone are held accountable. They got behind the wheel with alcohol in their system, and Kyle Rittenhouse walked down the street with a semiautomatic rifle over his shoulder.\", \"Each scenario, a disaster in the making \\u2014 this one proving, once again, that the law and justice are miles apart.\", \"Debora SteinBronxville, N.Y.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Kyle Rittenhouse may have prevailed in his claim that he acted in self-defense under Wisconsin law, but what does that say about the state of affairs in America? Is it really OK for him to march down the street with an AR-15-style rifle over his shoulder? Is it really OK for him to shoot demonstrators when they perceive him to be the threat and seek to disarm him?\", \"Where does this all end?\", \"And you can be sure that the extremists on the right will not be so quick to defend the use of semiautomatic rifles or the self-defense claim when it is a left-wing protester or a Black man who shoots someone because he believed that the person was a threat.\", \"David S. ElkindGreenwich, Conn.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"In \\u201cSelf-Defense Is Difficult to Disprove, Experts Say\\u201d you write, \\u201cThe acquittal points to the wide berth the legal system gives to defendants who say they acted out of fear.\\u201d\", \"Wow. Yet another punch in the face to the thousands of women abuse survivors incarcerated for acts of self-defense. This verdict had nothing to do with justice. This verdict was a clear message about power and control, and exactly who in American society is permitted to hold it.\", \"Valerie M. FieldSea Cliff, N.Y.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cRittenhouse and the Right\\u2019s White Vigilante Heroes,\\u201d by Charles M. Blow (column, Nov. 22):\", \"The verdict makes me more fearful and more concerned about the state of the country. I grew up in Mississippi under Jim Crow laws. Never have I been so afraid of white people.\", \"My fear is based partly on the degree to which those with positions of authority, such as Judge Bruce Schroeder, coddle vigilantes. The judge went to extraordinary lengths to protect Kyle Rittenhouse. The verdict will embolden other white vigilantes, especially when they learn of the benefits inuring to Mr. Rittenhouse: job offers and potential speaking engagements.\", \"God help us if an unintended consequence of the coddling of vigilantes is that those with reasonable fear begin arming themselves and shooting at the first sign of perceived danger.\", \"Devarieste CurryWashingtonThe writer is a retired lawyer.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Kyle Rittenhouse, who killed two young men as a teen, has the opportunity to deter gun violence through his public words and deeds, or to worsen it by the same. I hope he is mature enough to make the right decision.

It is to promote equity and inclusion by helping my fellow physicians and me center the care we provide around our patients\\u2019 lived experiences, without reinforcing stigmatization or negative stereotypes. It is designed to stimulate awareness about language and concepts most of us didn\\u2019t learn in medical school, moving us closer to racial justice and equity in medicine.\", \"Language, like science, must evolve over time based on new revelations and deeper understanding, evidenced by your own newspaper\\u2019s updates to its style guide to modify racial and ethnic identifiers.
