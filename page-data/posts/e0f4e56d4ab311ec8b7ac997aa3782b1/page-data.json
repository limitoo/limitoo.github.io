But none had quite the dramatic vision of Jack Tworkov, the abstract expressionist painter, in the middle of the previous century. \\u201cImagine a great catastrophe. And all this mowed down,\\u201d he mused then, looking at photographs of buildings, envisioning rust and dust. \\u201cAnd tourists wandering around in all that emptiness \\u2014 where was the Flatiron, the Empire State \\u2014 looking for past grandeur. Imagine good old New York someday just like Egypt.\\u201d\", \"Tworkov is one of scores who come bearing aper\\u00e7us in the German American writer and artist Edith Schloss\\u2019s memoir, \\u201cThe Loft Generation,\\u201d discovered in rough-draft form after her death in 2011. It\\u2019s been polished into a glowing jewel of a book by several editors including Mary Venturini, who worked with her in later years at a magazine for expats in Rome, and Schloss\\u2019s son, Jacob Burckhardt.\", \"Schloss was likely underappreciated as an artist, being a woman and mother in a macho era, but she was equanimous and resourceful. Jacob was sometimes left with a dog for a babysitter, and celebrated his first birthday crawling on a high terrace overlooking Naples. His father, Rudy Burckhardt, a filmmaker and photographer whose cityscapes had drawn Tworkov\\u2019s gaze, is here just another entrant in a Who\\u2019s Who of art-world characters, cataloged in a 16-page glossary accompanied by a photo of a list scribbled by Schloss: \\u201cfamous people whose hand my little hand has shaken.\\u201d\", \"They are a spiky, ambitious lot. We encounter the poet John Ashbery, to whom Schloss complained about being called \\u201csemiabstract\\u201d by a critic. \\u201c\\u2018Isn\\u2019t all life semi?\\u2019\\u201d he replied consolingly. And the composer Elliott Carter, who sneered of folk music\\u2019s influence on modern urbans: \\u201cWe are not shepherds. We are not coming out of the hills. We are not folk.\\u201d The dancer and choreographer Merce Cunningham rears up \\u201clike a furry old faun\\u201d; the gallerist Leo Castelli has a Felix Unger-ish fastidiousness.\", \"Schloss writes of a time, incredible as it may seem now, when painters in New York had the clout of movie stars. (These days, maybe even movie stars no longer have the clout of movie stars.) The Bob De Niro she gossiped with over a temperamental kerosene stove on the street was the actor\\u2019s father. Franz Kline, another abstract expressionist, with whom she danced the tango, \\u201chad a sort of Bogart-like cool and melancholy.\\u201d Strolling downtown alongside Willem de Kooning, the Dutch painter, leader of this set, \\u201cwas like walking with Clark Gable in Hollywood.\\u201d\", \"De Kooning and his wife, Elaine, a.k.a. \\u201cQueen of the Lofts,\\u201d are among the more completely filled-out figures in a collection of mostly outlines and shadows, darting in and out of time. At Bill\\u2019s studio, Schloss, who\\u2019d escaped Nazi Germany studying languages abroad as a teenager, first beheld the takeover of former industrial spaces that transformed real estate as well as art. So powerful was the romance of New York lofts, surpassing the Parisian garrets before them, that prefabricated luxury versions are now an industry standard. They were \\u201cstages for work and for a whole new free way of living,\\u201d Schloss writes, describing her crowd\\u2019s appropriation of cable spools for coffee tables as if they were The Borrowers, a perpetual ascension of creaky stairs, parlor games absent an actual parlor and meals taken at the Automat.\", \"All five senses are shaken awake by \\u201cThe Loft Generation,\\u201d which might as well be subtitled A Study of Synesthesia, punctuated by \\u201ccream-colored screams,\\u201d a hotly debated phrase the poet Frank O\\u2019Hara used to describe Cy Twombly\\u2019s canvases in ARTnews. Schloss got a reviewing gig there \\u2014 she compares the work to embroidery or knitting \\u2014 to smoothe Jacob\\u2019s admittance to a nursery school \\u201conly for the children of working mothers\\u201d; painting apparently didn\\u2019t qualify. There is sight, of course, with color insets of Schloss\\u2019s bright and optimistic daubings alongside work by her more dour-seeming contemporaries. There is sound, in her recounting of the unholy clamor of the Chelsea neighborhood where she and Burckhardt shacked up: the rattling of iron window shutters, mating cats, the fire and burglar alarms and \\u201cthe intermittent swish of cars down Sixth Avenue, like long sighs.\\u201d (Next time you misplace the AirPods Pro, think of John Cage teaching Schloss to appreciate ambient noise as part of life\\u2019s symphony.)\", \"There is taste, too: the wild rice with chicken livers eaten on the floor, naturally, and the photographer Francesca Woodman declaring \\u201cspaghetti is my only religion.\\u201d Also smell: the \\u201cjuicy, semen-like\\u201d whiff Schloss gets from chanterelle mushrooms collected in Maine, say, or the odor of \\u201cmouse turds and straw\\u201d in a horse-drawn coach in Ischia. And plenty of touch and texture, like the fur-lined teacup and flip books of the Swiss surrealist Meret Oppenheim, whom the author addresses affectionately in the second person.\", \"If nostalgia is a sixth and often fogging sense, it is absent in a book that feels manifestly present, clear and alive even while describing the past. Though Schloss reminisces about many friends she lost, and moments when she was overlooked, \\u201cThe Loft Generation,\\u201d as the sly pun of its title suggests, is not dragged down by sorrow or regret. With her talent for art and writing and social life, Schloss may have spread herself too thin for greater renown. Or maybe her greatest gift was being in the blazing-hot There and attuned, basically happy as those around her strove and schemed. \\u201cOnce, it shot through me like a high-voltage charge,\\u201d is how she remembers a Cage concert. \\u201cThis is it, we\\u2019re on top of our time.\\u201d Rocked by Twombly: \\u201cThis was us, and this was New York, and this was where it was at.\\u201d\", \"After the scene broke up and Schloss settled in serener Italy, the World Trade Center would rise and fall. The Cedar Tavern, where she and her colleagues had gathered, would become a CVS and the artists would move to Bushwick. Good old New York. Still going.\"]","href_hash":"e0f4e56d4ab311ec8b7ac997aa3782b1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e0f4e56d4ab311ec8b7ac997aa3782b1"}},
