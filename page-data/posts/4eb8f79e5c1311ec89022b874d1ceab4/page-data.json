Close-ups show two large glowing spheres inside its head. These, the MBARI said, are the creature's eyes.\", \"The two small indentations where you might expect the eyes to be are actually its olfactory organs.\", \"\\\"Its eyes look upwards to spot its favorite prey\\u2014usually small crustaceans trapped in the tentacles of siphonophores\\u2014from the shadows they cast in the faint shimmer of sunlight from above,\\\" a statement from the MBARI said\", \"\\\"But how does this fish eat when its eyes point upward and its mouth points forward? MBARI researchers learned the barreleye can rotate its eyes beneath that dome of transparent tissue.\\\"\", \"Barreleye fish were first described in 1939. The species grows up to around six inches in length. They are found in oceans across the world, from the waters of Japan to Baja California.\", \"It is thought barreleye fish hover below siphonophores so they can steal their food. Siphonophores are unusual marine organisms that can grow up to 33 feet in length and drift around the ocean with thousands of stinging tentacles that are used to capture small animals.\", \"Barreleye fish are mostly motionless in the water, with its body horizontal and its eyes looking upwards. When it sees prey caught in the siphonophore tentacles, it rotates its eyes forward and swims up to get it.\", \"The fish does not produce light like some other deep sea creatures. The glowing seen in the video is from the remote operated vehicle used in the dive shining on light colored tissue underneath a transparent dome, the Monterey Bay Aquarium said.\", \"\\\"Picture the blue-green body parts as upward facing eyes underneath a clear dome like an astronaut helmet,\\\" it said in a Facebook post. \\\"The blue-green color to the eyes are pigments to help them find their bioluminescent prey.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950104/barreleye-fish.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Stock image of a barreleye fish.
