The bulletproof plates inside are rated at level IIIA by the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), which provides protection from longer-barreled handguns, but not rifles.\", \"The vests are offered in three different sizes, and the smallest weighs only 3 pounds, allowing for easy wearing and transportation by children.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948146/schoolchildren.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">An Arizona firefighter has created a line of bulletproof vests for children. Here, kids can be seen entering school in New York.</div>\", \"Goodman also told KTVK-TV that his vests could've prevented the loss of life that occurred in Michigan on Nov. 30, when a gunman killed four students and injured seven others at Oxford High School.\", \"\\\"It is sad, but we can't pretend this is not happening. We prepare for other things. If you look at schools, we have fire drills and fire extinguishers in every classroom,\\\" Goodman continued. \\\"This is also something that is a realistic threat, and we have to prepare for it.\\\"\", \"Escape Armour does not appear to be the only company working to create reinforced products for kids in schools.\", \"An online business called BulletBlocker has a number of bulletproof products for sale that are designed to be used in the classroom and workplace. This includes bulletproof backpacks, binder inserts, and tablet cases.\", \"Some of these backpacks can now even be purchased at major office supply retailers such as Staples, which currently lists a ballistics-grade backpack for sale on its website.\", \"The Washington Post reported in 2019 that sales of bulletproof school products had been increasing each year since 2016.\", \"The outlet also reported that school security in general had evolved into a $2.7 billion yearly business. This includes the production of active shooter mediation devices such as emergency shields and crisis response training.\"]","href_hash":"866c6bf6589111eca8055d9984dbe8fd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"866c6bf6589111eca8055d9984dbe8fd"}},
