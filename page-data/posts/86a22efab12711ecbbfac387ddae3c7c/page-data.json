But, Mr. Biden added, \\\"I don't want to put too much stock in that at this time because we don't have that much hard evidence.\\\"  \", \"A U.S. official said Wednesday that U.S. intelligence officials had determined that Putin was being misinformed by his advisers about the poor performance of Kremlin troops in Ukraine.
