He was a good worker and a fast learner.\", \"Toms loved motorbikes - he had a Ducati Monster, a GasGas 250 and a Honda CBR 600 - so fixing them was a natural fit. There were Thai meals and beers after work and weekend trips to Waiouru for motocross.\", \"\\\"We were mates, not just work mates,\\\" his colleague Courtney would later tell detectives, describing Toms as a popular guy. \\\"He was pretty active on the girlfriend side of things.

Why are you discharging him?'\\\"\", \"At lunch on the day of his discharge, the family found him delusional and anxious.

Let's go',\\\" Natahsa says. \\\"It's where he felt safe.\\\"\", \"After he was shot dead, Auckland DHB's mental health unit reviewed his care.\", \"\\\"Clinicians told the review team that increasing pressure for beds has meant that discharges occur when patients are settled enough for intensive community follow up rather than when they are completely settled,\\\" the review said.\", \"For Toms, the lack of bed space meant he was released before \\\"full resolution of his mood and psychotic symptoms\\\".\", \"His illness exacerbated his risk-taking behaviour, his mental health records say. On 11 March, two weeks after he was discharged and three weeks before he was shot, Toms was arrested for driving his motorbike dangerously.\", \"Here was another chance for police to recognise his mental illness. And they nearly took it. Toms was upfront with the officer who took him into custody for the night, saying he'd drunk three beers and smoked cannabis and that he had bipolar disorder.\", \"\\\"At first I evaluated him as being in need of care and frequent monitoring. I changed it straight away to 'not in need of specific care',\\\" the officer later explained, saying Toms seemed fine and was taking his medication.\", \"\\\"We did not enter an alert on Toms' dossier in NIA [National Intelligence Application, a police records system] in regards to him having mental health issues. It is not something we always do as a matter of routine.\\\"\", \"Toms' mental health records say marijuana use \\\"destabilised his mental state typically by increasing his paranoia\\\" and that \\\"he also used methamphetamine on occasion\\\".\", \"Toxicology tests found small traces of meth, cannabis and alcohol in Toms' blood after he was shot. Police asked a forensic pathologist what effect the meth had but he said it was \\\"not possible to correlate a post-mortem blood level of methamphetamine with a specific behaviour\\\".\", \"Toms' work colleagues didn't think he had a drug problem. \\\"I have never seen Jerrim in a state where I thought he was whacked out or anything like that,\\\" Courtney told detectives. \\\"In the hours that we saw him, he was a perfectly regular guy.\\\"\", \"That was the man they said goodbye to for the last time when he left work on the Thursday before Easter. But by the early hours of Easter Saturday, Toms was losing touch with reality.\", \"He deleted his Facebook friends and posted a series of strange messages.\", \"\\\"Divine love, I'm home. We are all one or we are not one.\\\"\", \"He told his mum, Joan, the house now belonged to him and she should leave. Joan went to Natasha's house and at 2.25am phoned the mental health Urgent Response Service.\", \"She was put through to a Duly Authorised Officer (DAO), a statutory position under the Mental Health Act and the first point of contact for mentally ill people living in the community.\", \"The DAO told Joan to call police for a welfare check but, according to the Auckland DHB review of his case, these checks are poorly understood.\", \"\\\"Some DAOs believe these welfare checks will lead ultimately to a mental health review at some place of safety but there is no policy to guide this practice nor any agreed response with the police.\\\"\", \"Joan called police for the welfare check at 2.51am but by 3.22am they had closed the job, leaving only summary comments in the event log. \\\"Male not at address, presumably left in white Legacy,\\\" the notes read. \\\"Event closed.\\\"\", \"About one minute after the job was deleted, an off-duty officer on his way home from a shift pulled up alongside a white Subaru on the side of State Highway 1.

The Eagle helicopter was overhead providing commentary to the officers below. The crew saw and filmed everything.

The swabs would then be irrelevant.\\\"\", \"Detectives later asked an ESR scientist to examine whether some marks found on the patrol car were made by the machete, but his report, dated September 2018, was inconclusive. \\\"These marks could have been made by different areas of the same tool or by different tools.\\\"\", \"***\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/278687/eight_col_211028_JERRIM-TOMS-MEMORIAL005.jpg?1635455784\\\" alt=\\\"The stretch of road on the Twin Coast Highway where Jerrim Toms was shot.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nJerrim Toms was shot on a deserted highway. \\nPhoto: RNZ / Claire Eastham-Farrelly\\n</div>\", \"The homicide investigation into the death of Jerrim Toms was named Operation Hamlet.\", \"Maybe detectives were simply acknowledging a tragedy.
