We're talking about things like the L&P bottle in Paeroa, the Ohakune carrot, and lots of things like that,\\\" Sharp said.\", \"\\\"For a lot of young people in the town, they've seen it all their lives and it was part of their history, part of their background and they were really attached to it.\\\"\", \"Sharp said the number of signatures on the petition to return the sign showed the depth of feeling in Panmure.\", \"\\\"That is a huge number for a town like Panmure and we expect it to reach the thousand signature mark. The groundswell of support and anger against Auckland transport is definitely growing.\\\"\", \"But in a statement, Auckland Transport spokesperson Natalie Polley said reinstating the sign was not recommended as it would be a public safety risk.\", \"\\\"The engineering company contracted to examine the sign said that although a new foundation appeared feasible, structurally the existing post doesn't comply with current standards. Retrofitting the existing sign to comply is expected to be very difficult and expensive.\\\"\", \"In 2020, Auckland Transport offered the sign to the local board along with quarter of a million dollars, because they say it had the legal responsibility for place-making, but the board did not accept the offer.\", \"While Auckland Transport said they were continuing discussions with the board, for now the sign's fate is still yet to be agreed.\"]","href_hash":"5f2ae2df7c9a11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5f2ae2df7c9a11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
