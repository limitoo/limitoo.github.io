During the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant, starting from 1873, a man from Rhode Island named Horace Vose was responsible for \\\"selecting with the utmost care\\\" the \\\"noblest gobbler\\\" in the state for the president's Thanksgiving dinner, according to a 2011 blog on an archived White House website.\", \"The White House Historical Association explains: \\\"The First Families did not always feast upon Vose's turkeys, but the yearly offering gained his farm widespread publicity and became a veritable institution at the White House.\\\"\", \"Following Vose's death, from 1914, the opportunity to give a turkey to a president was open to all and such gifts were often associated with \\\"patriotism, partisanship and glee,\\\" the association says.\", \"According to the National Turkey Federation, the presentation of the National Thanksgiving Turkey has been observed since 1947 when former president Harry S.

Kennedy began a trend of publicly sparing a turkey gifted to the White House back in November 1963. The turkey, which at the time wore a sign that read \\\"Good Eatin' Mr. President,\\\" was spared by Kennedy just three days before his assassination in Dallas, Texas.\", \"While former presidents Lyndon Johnson, Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and Ronald Reagan have all held turkey press conferences, it wasn't until 1989 during the presidency of George H.W.
