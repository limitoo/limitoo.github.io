The Mala Market, a fine source for Chinese ingredients based in Nashville, Tenn., has assembled a kit including harder-to-find components like da hong pao Sichuan pepper, whole spices including cassia bark and a roasted oil called caiziyou. You supply the everyday items like shallots, onions, sesame seeds and fresh ginger for the precise seven-step recipe that will take a good two hours to prepare, and time to cool. The result will be a 17-ounce jar (provided) of chile crisp, plus enough material for another batch suitable for decanting into smaller six or eight-ounce containers for gift-giving. Chile oil without the crunch can also be made.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.
