The tribes petitioned after failing to get the items back, tribal officials said.\", \"The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Review Committee discovered a \\\"preponderance of the evidence for cultural affiliation\\\" between the Muscogee-speaking tribes known to live near the ancient settlement and the remains and artifacts from it. After the discovery, tribal officials said the University of Alabama will violate federal law if the items are not given back to the tribes.\", \"\\\"We have requested the return of our ancestors for years, and the excuses for delay are over. With the finding that the remains and funerary objects discovered in Moundville are culturally affiliated with the seven tribes that have petitioned for their return, there is no reason to wait any longer. The time has come for our ancestors to rest in peace,\\\" said David Hill, Principal Chief of the Muscogee (Creek) Nation, said in a statement.\", \"\\\"5,892 of our ancestors deserve a proper burial. They don't deserve to be in a box in the basement of the University of Alabama,\\\" Hill added.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939247/native-american-tribes-petition-moundsville-artifacts.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">In this 2002 file photo, Eugene Futato, senior archeologist and curator of archaeological collections at the Office of Archaeological Services, pulls out a drawer of Mississippian Indian ceramic vessels from Moundville, in Moundville, Ala. Leaders of several American Indian tribes are asking the University of Alabama to return nearly 6,000 human remains and artifacts from the school's archaeological park and museum. </div>\", \"\\\"We stand before you today fighting for the return of our ancestors \\u2014 ancestors who were removed from their place of rest for purposes of what \\u2014 research, for development and often more common, yet horribly tragic, because archaeology was someone's privileged hobby,\\\" Tina Osceola of the Seminole Tribe of Florida said during a presentation to the committee.\", \"The Alabama site, simply known as Moundville because of the large earthen mounds constructed there, was occupied from about 1020 to 1650, according to the presentation. While its ancient name is unknown, the city at its peak was one of the largest Native American settlements in North America, according to the university. But it was largely abandoned around the time European explorers arrived in the region.\", \"The 1990 federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act requires federally funded institutions, such as universities, to return Native American remains and cultural items to lineal descendants, Indian Tribes, and Native Hawaiian organizations. However, the return has been slow and complicated when sites, such as the Alabama settlement, predate written history.\", \"The tribes argued Tuesday that there is linguistic, oral tradition and archeological evidence that the occupants of Moundville were their ancestors.\", \"Muskogean-speaking tribes were the only tribes living within 140 miles (225 kilometers) of the Alabama site when European explorers arrived in the area, according to the presentation by tribal officials. They said oral traditions place tribal creation near Moundville or speak of large regional gatherings at centers like Moundville. They also said the DNA evidence shows a close genetic connection of the seven tribes.\", \"Tens of thousands of indigenous peoples, including the Muscogee Nation, were forcibly removed from their ancestral homelands by the U.S. government between 1830 and 1850 during the devastating Trail of Tears.\", \"One of the six committee members abstained from Tuesday's vote because the committee had not heard from university officials.\", \"In a recent letter to tribal officials, James T. Dalton, executive vice president and provost of the University of Alabama, said that the university hopes to work with the tribes. Dalton said the University of Alabama will be providing more suggestions on the \\\"most productive and efficient manner to address the pending joint request.\\\"\", \"While nearly 83,000 remains in the U.S. had been returned to descendants under the federal law, the National Park Service indicates remains of about 116,000 Native Americans are still held by institutions around the country.
