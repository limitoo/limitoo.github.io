Requiring visitors to be vaccinated lessens the potential for Covid-19 to be introduced to a prison. This will also help minimise impacts on the wider health system, which could face additional pressure if a Covid-19 outbreak occurred in a prison.\\\"\", \"Beales said inmates are some of the most susceptible to the virus, with many vulnerable due to pre-existing conditions and the potential ease of transmission in a prison environment.\", \"An outbreak in prison would also disproportionately affect M\\u0101ori, he said.\", \"\\\"As we have seen internationally, Covid-19 can be extremely devastating in residential environments with large numbers of people living in close proximity to each other. Internationally many prison staff and prisoners have become very unwell and some have died as a result of Covid-19 outbreaks in prisons,\\\" Beales said.\", \"Despite managing 21 Covid-19 infected people during the pandemic, he said Corrections have managed to avoid transmission to prisoners or staff.\", \"However, Beales said the department had to proactively plan and prepare for the potential of an outbreak within its prisons.\", \"\\\"We have already taken extensive measures to keep Covid-19 out of prisons, with health screening and PPE requirements a standard part of our entry requirements for all visitors. We are also managing newly received prisoners separately for their first 14 days in custody, and carrying out routine testing for Covid-19 on days 0, 5 and 12.\", \"\\\"This is yet another step we are taking to ensure the health, safety and wellbeing of the people we manage and our staff, and to give extra assurance to the wh\\u0101nau and friends of those in prison that we are taking every step to protect them from Covid-19.\\\"\", \"Beales said corrections will continue to provide facilities to ensure prisoners are able to contact friends and wh\\u0101nau until they are able to meet the new requirements.\", \"Corrections will be contacting approved visitors of current inmates to outline the new requirements in the coming days.\"]","href_hash":"39f714123d3211ec8abe000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"39f714123d3211ec8abe000017025a03"}},
