Now her fans are furious. Even the talk-show host Drew Barrymore \\u2014 played by the talk-show host Drew Barrymore \\u2014 is critical of Sophie\\u2019s actions.\", \"After an on-air meltdown, Sophie heads for Scotland, in part to flee her readers\\u2019 ire, and in part to find writerly inspiration. Her father was a spinner of yarns, Sophie\\u2019s daughter reminds her on a video call. His vivid stories about a Scottish castle where his parents were groundskeepers were particularly rich.\", \"In Dunbar, at a quaint bed-and-breakfast, Sophie is welcomed by a kind group of locals who gather to knit. She also encounters Cary Elwes, who plays Myles, the duke of nearby Dun Dunbar castle. Thanks to his rambunctious dog, Hamish, he and Sophie meet cute in town. Impulsively, Sophie decides to purchase Myles\\u2019s castle and he becomes its cranky tenant with a plan to get the estate back.\", \"Likeable stars with little frisson, Elwes and Shields are also saddled with a formulaic script. It also doesn\\u2019t help matters that Elwes, whose last lead in a romantic comedy was \\u201cThe Princess Bride,\\u201d does not look at ease. The supporting cast is more relaxed (particularly Andi Osho as Maisie, and Lee Ross as Thomas, Maisie\\u2019s former sweetheart and Myles\\u2019s servant. But no one\\u2019s happier for their close-up than the pup who portrays the dogged matchmaker. It\\u2019s tempting to say, he puts the ham in Hamish, but then isn\\u2019t that an Easter dish?\"]","href_hash":"c7010ebc4d5411ec9e9669a9812fa393"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c7010ebc4d5411ec9e9669a9812fa393"}},
