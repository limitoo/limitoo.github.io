The borders are opening up, there's less restrictions, so it's about time...\", \"\\\"If all things work out, I get this win and we're talking titles. I'd love to bring it back to New Zealand and do it in front of my people.\\\"\", \"While well aware what was on the line, Kara-France was far from getting ahead of himself.\", \"On the contrary, the man who went by the nickname \\\"Don't Blink\\\" said he had his eyes wide open to the task at hand.\", \"A belief backed up by what he had done in the wake of his statement-making knockout of former bantamweight champion Cody Garbrandt in December.\", \"\\\"I ran a marathon around Christmas time, just because I wanted to test myself ... that's where I'm at in my career, I'm doing everything I can.\", \"\\\"If it's seeing my strength coach, combat trainings with wresting, jiu-jitsu and kickboxing, doing my breathing sessions, seeing my sports psychologist, working with our physio. I've even got a chest freezer for ice baths and a sauna in my garage to get more recovery.\", \"\\\"I'm putting everything into this. Eight weeks of dedicating myself to this and when it's fight week there's no stone left unturned. No woulda coulda shoulda.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/243714/four_col_1610CKB.jpg?1601009290\\\" alt=\\\"City Kickboxing UFC fighters Kai Kara-France, Israel Adesanya and Shane Young.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nCity Kickboxing UFC fighters Kai Kara-France, Israel Adesanya and Shane Young. \\nPhoto: Photosport\\n</div>\", \"It's what Kara-France calls his champion mindset.\", \"A mindset he has had to work on, cultivate and solidify with big performances on the big stage.\", \"And a mindset that meant he wasn't one bit intimidated by wrestling-specialist Askarov's unblemished record.\", \"\\\"It shows he's done everything right, being 14 and 0.\", \"\\\"But he's also coming off four decisions in the UFC, he missed weight in his last fight and he's had a year off.\", \"\\\"My last fight was just three months ago, so I'm fresh off a high profile fight and I know that feeling. He's going to have to figure that out when I'm standing right in front of him.\", \"\\\"I don't really see any pressure or mystique with him having an undefeated record. In the fight game, especially MMA, eventually you're going to lose.\\\"\", \"For now, though, Kara-France felt he was done with defeat.\", \"After more than a dozen years grinding his way to this point, he was determined to celebrate his birthday with a bang.\", \"\\\"I have a task in front of me and that's all I'm focussed on. It's the biggest fight of my career, against the No 2 guy.\", \"\\\"I know it's leading to the title but I'm not thinking about that. I'm just going to go out there, have fun, back myself and show everyone why I'm the best in the world.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"5bdc22a8ad3e11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5bdc22a8ad3e11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
