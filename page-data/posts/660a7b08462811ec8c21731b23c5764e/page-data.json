However, his calls to the president's personal cellphone, as well as to his bodyguard and secretary, went unanswered.\", \"\\\"I was desperate to try to get in touch with him because I felt like what was happening was awful and it was going to be a stain on his presidency. I wanted him to be the guy to stop it,\\\" Christie said.\", \"Trump has faced blame from members of his own party for allowing the violence at the Capitol to unfold and for fueling anger in the country over the presidential election. Trump falsely maintains that he won the race and that the only reason he's not in the White House for a second term is that fraudulent ballots were cast.\", \"Although there were some instances of election fraud, as is the case in most elections, Trump hasn't offered any evidence that there was enough fraud to have changed the race's outcome.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932313/donald-trump-chris-christie-january-6.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie said he was \\\"desperate\\\" to get in contact with former President Donald Trump on January 6 during the U.S. Capitol riot.

Trump reportedly believed if these results were sent back, state legislators could give him another term in office.\", \"But Pence pushed back on Trump's pressure to insert himself in the proceedings, saying in a statement on January 6 that this went would go beyond his constitutional duties. Instead, Pence saw his role as overseeing the process and allowing valid objections to be heard.\", \"On the morning of January 6, Trump called for Pence to \\\"do the right thing\\\" and send the results back to the states, saying if he didn't it would be a \\\"sad day\\\" for the country. Trump added that he would be \\\"very disappointed\\\" in his vice president if he allowed the election certification to proceed.\", \"\\\"I think it was an awful act to a vice president who had been extraordinarily loyal and a guy who deserved much better,\\\" Christie told Axios, referring to Trump's treatment of Pence.\", \"As the assault on the Capitol unfolded, Christie said he called former senior counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway, who agreed the two needed to try to reach Trump. Having failed to get in touch with the former president, Christie went on ABC News and said Trump \\\"caused\\\" the attack to occur and is the \\\"only one to make it stop.\\\"\", \"\\\"The president has to come out and tell his supporters to leave the Capitol grounds and to allow the Congress to do their business peacefully.
