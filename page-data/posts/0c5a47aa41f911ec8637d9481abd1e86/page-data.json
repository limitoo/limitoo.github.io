I thought there was something wrong with my vehicle - it wasn't obvious to me - and he was trying to warn me.\", \"\\\"Then he pulled beside me and got very close, to the point where I was almost forced off the road. I put my window down and he started screaming incoherently - but what I did understand is that he recognised me as a former Labour Party president because the first thing he told me was he's never voting Labour again.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The reason was we're 'forcing people to jab themselves with poisons'. It was really very frightening, he was very exercised and red in the face\\u2026\\\"\", \"No one is being forced to inject themselves with anything, of course.
