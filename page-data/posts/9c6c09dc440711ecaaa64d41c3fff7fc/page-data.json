She attended a conference on promoting democratic elections in Libya. And she secured a commitment for the United States to join a nonbinding international declaration to protect civilians against cyberattacks.\", \"During a tightly-choreographed trip to France this week, Ms. Harris appeared determined to assert herself as a diplomatic asset for a president who believes he knows more about the process \\u2014 and the vice presidency \\u2014 than most.\", \"The trip, coming amid declining approval ratings for President Biden and Ms. Harris within the United States, also provided a chance to cement the global profile of the vice president, who has demonstrated aspirations for higher office.\", \"\\u201cI think there is no question that I\\u2019m here as a representative for my country,\\u201d Ms. Harris said. \\u201cAnd my presence here is reflective of the priorities that the United States has as it relates to France.\\u201d\", \"But 10 months into her vice presidency, Ms. Harris\\u2019s track record on delivering on the administration\\u2019s global priorities has been mixed.\", \"Earlier trips, to Southeast Asia and Central America, served as crucial tests on collaborating with allies and confronting adversaries on the global stage. Experts said they were still trying to process whether Ms. Harris\\u2019s five-day trip to France, which ends Saturday, had helped her establish American priorities overseas.\", \"\\u201cI think she\\u2019s been really hidden this whole time and out of the sight of most Europeans,\\u201d said C\\u00e9lia Belin, a visiting fellow in the Center on the United States and Europe at the Brookings Institution. \\u201cI think she\\u2019s been quite under the radar.\\u201d\", \"The main diplomatic achievement Ms. Harris brings home from the trip was the announcement on Wednesday that the United States had joined a French-led global initiative to protect civilians against cyberattacks and protect elections from digital threats. That may have helped soothe France\\u2019s anger over a lucrative submarine deal it had with Australia that Canberra abruptly canceled in favor of a new one with the United States and Britain.\", \"Ms. Harris\\u2019s meeting with Mr. Macron came at a particularly challenging time, Ms. Belin said, as France \\u2014 like the United States \\u2014 confronts a rise in far-right and nationalist rhetoric.\", \"Mr. Macron faces a tough re-election campaign next year and a likely challenge from a far-right firebrand, and has in response has moved to the right on issues like immigration and crime.\", \"\\u201cThe irony of this trip and this meeting,\\u201d Ms. Belin said, was that France was \\u201cundergoing a particularly nonprogressive moment that extends out as very much an opposition to what she represents.\\u201d\", \"But Ms. Harris \\u2014 who often has lunch with Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken to discuss foreign policy issues \\u2014 came with none of the blunt messaging she has delivered on other trips abroad. During her first foreign trip as vice president, to Guatemala, she came with tough messages on two challenging issues even as she met the country\\u2019s leaders: surging migration and the corruption that plagues the Latin American country.\", \"In public comments, Ms. Harris said the United States would not welcome asylum-seeking migrants from Guatemala who entered the country illegally. She also voiced support for an anti-corruption unit whose integrity had been criticized by Guatemala\\u2019s president, Alejandro Giammattei. \\u201cWe will look to root out corruption wherever it exists,\\u201d she said.\", \"\\u201cShe struck the correct balance between trying to establish productive relationships and being extraordinarily frank,\\u201d said Stephen McFarland, a former ambassador to Guatemala during the Obama administration. Still, he added, that message had done little to sway the Guatemalan government.\", \"Just a month after Ms. Harris\\u2019s visit, an anti-corruption prosecutor, Juan Francisco Sandoval, who had been investigating Mr. Giammattei, was abruptly fired and fled the country.\", \"Ms. Harris\\u2019s next trip, to Singapore and Vietnam, was touted as an effort to bolster economic and public health partnerships.\", \"But it came during the Biden administration\\u2019s chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, forcing her senior aides to face questions about the historical parallel between that exodus and the U.S. evacuation of American citizens in 1975 from Saigon during the Vietnam War.\", \"William Choong, a senior fellow at the Yusof Ishak Institute, a research organization in Singapore, said Ms. Harris was a \\u201cgood trooper\\u201d for the Biden administration, \\u201cdelivering a very commendable performance and delivering an emphatic note about American commitment to the southeast region as well as the wider Indo-Pacific.\\u201d\", \"During her trip, Ms. Harris also took a tough line with China, accusing Beijing of intimidation in the South China Sea and pledging to challenge its \\u201cbullying and excessive maritime claims.\\u201d China condemned Ms. Harris\\u2019s comments, and stepped up its criticism of the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\", \"While Ms. Harris\\u2019s time in France kept her largely free of controversy and allowed her to establish a greater presence, however controlled, on the world stage than on past trips, she is facing significant headwinds at home.\", \"The Biden administration is facing rising inflation, a domestic agenda whose success is still in question, a global pandemic that has not receded, and a damaging Democratic loss in the Virginia governor\\u2019s race that has some in the party questioning whether the White House is taking the right cues from American voters.\", \"There is also the issue of lagging approval ratings for both President Biden and Ms. Harris: a recent USA Today-Suffolk University poll found that 28 percent of voters approved of the job the vice president is doing.\", \"Symone Sanders, Ms. Harris\\u2019s press secretary and senior adviser, told reporters en route to Paris that dismal new polling reflected \\u201ca snapshot in time,\\u201d and that Ms. Harris was focused on other matters, including a social spending deal.\", \"Allies of the administration treaded gingerly when asked how Ms. Harris\\u2019s performance abroad could change her own political fortunes.\", \"Former Senator Chris J. Dodd of Connecticut, a member of the Biden campaign\\u2019s vice-presidential search committee and a confidant of the president, praised the job she had done in Paris, and said the vice president\\u2019s political future could include being a part of a longer list of Democratic candidates should the Biden presidency be limited to one term.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m hoping the president runs for re-election,\\u201d Mr. Dodd said, \\u201cbut for whatever reason that might not be the case, it\\u2019s hard to believe there would be a short list without Kamala\\u2019s name on it. She\\u2019s the vice president of the United States.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9c6c09dc440711ecaaa64d41c3fff7fc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9c6c09dc440711ecaaa64d41c3fff7fc"}},
