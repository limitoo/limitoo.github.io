They're running out stock eh, we put the requests through and sometimes it takes three days to get that stock through,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"For instance we had 75 requests yesterday, and New World could only do 25. We're running by the skin of our teeth to be honest.\\\"\", \"Kake said staff were finding ways to get supplies to get them to wh\\u0101nau, but he was not sure how much more it could be stretched.\", \"It is a problem being faced by providers right across T\\u0101maki Makaurau as the number of Omicron cases continues to surge.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/129429/eight_col_vaccinea.jpg?1630478130\\\" alt=\\\"No caption\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPapakura Marae runs a Covid testing centre, as well as support services and vaccination centres.  \\nPhoto: RNZ / Te Aniwa Hurihanganui\\n</div>\", \"Papakura Marae runs a testing centre, as well as support services and vaccination centres.\", \"Dozens of people have been testing positive there every day.

They have not had a situation where they have run out yet, he said, but supply lines are precarious.\", \"Kake said the marae is losing staff, though they are prepared.\", \"\\\"Our kaimahi? Yeah we're dropping like flies. We're planning to be down about 30 percent of staff and we've got backups.\", \"\\\"I've diverted staff, we've just got to move people around to where the priority is. I've got to explain that to our funders, I'm waiting for the first one to object and then I'll serve with the Covid response, 'well you come and do it'.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"0f142a969cfa11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0f142a969cfa11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
