Honduran security forces surrounded Hern\\u00e1ndez's neighborhood Monday night and the Supreme Court of Justice scheduled an urgent meeting Tuesday morning to select a judge to handle the extradition request. A standoff ensued. \\u00a0 In a video released by Hern\\u00e1ndez's legal team, apparently from inside his home, attorney F\\u00e9lix \\u00c1vila said that everything would have to wait until the Supreme Court designated a judge on Tuesday to consider the case. \\\"Meanwhile, it is understood that no arrest order exists.\\\" \\u00a0 However, at a police barrier to the neighborhood, Rasel Tom\\u00e9, vice president of the newly elected National Congress, said Hern\\u00e1ndez had to turn himself in or he would be captured at 6 a.m. Tuesday. \\u00a0 Shortly before that deadline, Hern\\u00e1ndez released an audio recording via Twitter thanking those praying for him. \\u00a0 \\\"It is not an easy moment,\\\" he said. \\\"I don't desire it for anyone.\\\"\", \"He said the National Police had already been informed by his lawyers that \\\"I am ready and prepared to cooperate and go voluntarily with their accompaniment in the moment the judge designated by the honorable Supreme Court of Justice decides it, to able to face this situation and defend myself.\\\" \\u00a0 It was a long-awaited fall for a leader reviled in his home country, who enjoyed support from the Trump administration but has been kept at arm's length by a Biden White House targeting Central America's endemic corruption as a root cause of migration. \\u00a0 The specific charges Hern\\u00e1ndez's faces are not known, but federal prosecutors in New York had previously named him a co-conspirator in a drug trafficking case, alleging that his political rise was fueled with drug profits. Hern\\u00e1ndez has long denied any wrongdoing. \\u00a0 U.S. officials confirmed the extradition request to CBS News on Tuesday, but the Department of Justice would not give any information on the nature of the accusations against Hern\\u00e1ndez.\", \"Hern\\u00e1ndez left office January 27 with the swearing in of President Xiomara Castro.\", \"The same day, Hern\\u00e1ndez was sworn in as Honduras' representative to the Central American Parliament.\", \"His lawyer, Hermes Ram\\u00edrez, told local media that his client had immunity as a member of the regional parliament and said government forces were not following proper procedures. He said Hern\\u00e1ndez was inside the home. \\u00a0 Various contingents of the National Police, including special forces and military police, were present around Hern\\u00e1ndez's neighborhood Monday night. Barriers at all the entrances kept out media and even residents. \\u00a0 Members of the security forces entered the area with weapons, wearing balaclavas and with handcuffs dangling from their ballistic vests. Some neighbors said the house had been dark and they believe unoccupied. \\u00a0 Hern\\u00e1ndez often pointed to the fact that Honduras began allowing the extradition of Hondurans on drug trafficking charges while he was president of the congress as part of his defense. \\u00a0 But U.S. prosecutors have alleged that he was taking bribes from drug traffickers on the promise of protecting them once he was Honduras' president. U.S. prosecutors in New York repeatedly implicated him in his brother's 2019 drug trafficking trial, alleging that his political rise was fueled by drug profits.\", \"That brother, Juan Antonio \\\"Tony\\\" Hern\\u00e1ndez, himself a former Honduran congressman, was sentenced to life in prison on drug and weapons charges in March 2021. At his sentencing Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Laroche characterized the crimes as \\\"state-sponsored drug trafficking.\\\" \\u00a0 Juan Orlando Hern\\u00e1ndez took office on January 27, 2014. He used a friendly Supreme Court to overcome Honduras' constitutional ban on reelection and won a second term in 2017, in elections marred by irregularities. \\u00a0 Around midnight Monday, 56-year-old Jorge Arturo Vega, a supporter of Castro's Liberty and Refoundation party, stood outside a police barricade at Hern\\u00e1ndez's neighborhood celebrating. \\u00a0 \\\"This is a party we've been waiting a long time for,\\\" Vega said, thinking back over the dozen years since Hern\\u00e1ndez came up in the congress. \\\"We couldn't stand this drug trafficker, criminal, killer in the presidential house any longer.\\\"\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"9b7070b88e6711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9b7070b88e6711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
