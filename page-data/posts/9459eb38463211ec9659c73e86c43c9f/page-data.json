Eric Kim wrote about salad for The Times this week, and delivered a terrific recipe with the essay, for green salad with dill vinaigrette (above). That could be part of your meal tonight, maybe alongside some roasted salmon.\", \"As good as that recipe is, though, my main takeaway from Eric\\u2019s story came from one of the chefs he interviewed, Jim Burke, of Wm. Mulherin\\u2019s Sons in Philadelphia, who doesn\\u2019t ever use black pepper in his salad dressing. \\u201cPepper is an extraordinarily assertive flavor,\\u201d Burke told Eric. \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t have a place in everything, especially with delicate leaves.\\u201d\", \"I laughed at that. It reminded me of a brushback the chef Ned Baldwin threw at Jeff Glor, a correspondent for \\u201cCBS This Morning,\\u201d who interviewed Baldwin about his book \\u201cHow to Dress an Egg\\u201d in 2020. Baldwin was preparing a black sea bass for the camera, dressing it with salt, lemon and herbs. \\u201cAnd pepper too,\\u201d Glor said. Baldwin cut him off. \\u201cNo pepper,\\u201d he said. \\u201cDon\\u2019t believe in pepper.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s a valuable lesson these chefs offer. Consider it in your cooking moving forward. I\\u2019ve been largely off pepper except as what they call a finishing spice for months now, and it\\u2019s been revelatory.\", \"(On the other hand, these black pepper chicken thighs with mango, rum and cashews are bonkers delicious, as is this black pepper beef and cabbage stir-fry.)\", \"What else to cook this week? I\\u2019m thinking sheet-pan paprika chicken with tomatoes and Parmesan; tomato rice with crispy Cheddar; millionaire\\u2019s shortbread; and Korean cod jeon, pan-fried cod sliders on Hawaiian rolls.\", \"I\\u2019m also thinking a lot about Thanksgiving pies and desserts. Maybe a cranberry curd tart this year, or some pecan pie truffles? Maybe baked apple cider doughnuts, a simple bread pudding, a spiced pumpkin pie? Practice makes perfect!\", \"Thousands and thousands more recipes are waiting for you on New York Times Cooking, including hundreds appropriate to the coming Thanksgiving feast.

It\\u2019s good fun.\", \"Women have been admitted to the formerly all-male cowboy institution Deep Springs College in rural California and, as Tessa Love reports for Outside, that doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s changing.\", \"Here\\u2019s a new poem by Tracy K. Smith in The New York Times Magazine, \\u201cWe Feel Now a Largeness Coming On.\\u201d\", \"Finally, I\\u2019ll leave you with a soundtrack for the week, from the infinite playlists of NTS Radio: \\u201cIsland Time.\\u201d Easy skanking!
