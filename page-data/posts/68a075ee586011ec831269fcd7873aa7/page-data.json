Dishy details like this are delightfully sprinkled throughout \\u201cIs There Still Sex in the City?,\\u201d a one-woman show written by and starring Bushnell that opened on Tuesday at the Daryl Roth Theater. But she offers more here than mere fodder for fans of her conflicted urban fairy tale of female sexual liberation, which grew from her mid-\\u201990s column for The New York Observer into the enduring franchise.\", \"With her frank and unpretentious point of view, Bushnell developed an appealing and assured mode of storytelling that marries aspirational fantasy with friendly confessional. Making her stage debut at 63, the author synthesizes her own personal and professional life as if it were a surprisingly eventful night on the town, inviting audiences behind the scenes and into her cozy confidence with a wink and a cocktail. (Cosmopolitans are available for purchase at the theater entrance.)\", \"Bushnell\\u2019s onstage memoir proceeds at a quick clip. When she emerged from puberty flat-chested, her father said soberly, \\u201cI\\u2019m afraid no man is ever going to love you.\\u201d (\\u201cThanks, Dad.\\u201d) She climbed off the bus to Manhattan in a Loehmann\\u2019s outfit picked out by her mother, hoping to write her way to a Pulitzer. She landed her first byline with a wry piece on how to behave at Studio 54. (\\u201cIf someone dies, ignore them.\\u201d) She met her Mr. Big, and then he dumped her just as she published the book \\u201cSex and the City,\\u201d in 1996, which would upend how readers, and later viewers, thought about women and sex.\", \"Under the direction of Lorin Latarro, Bushnell is conversational and accessible onstage; there\\u2019s a wonder and humility to her tone even as she settles behind the velvet ropes of high society, which makes her endearing rather than alienating to those looking on from the outside. Her prose doesn\\u2019t play for laughs, but humor stems from Bushnell\\u2019s pithy matter-of-factness. There\\u2019s an economy of detail, too, that works smartly in performance. On the set of \\u201cSex and the City,\\u201d a crane \\u201cshining a very large light, as bright as the sun\\u201d fills her with awe. (\\u201cAnd it\\u2019s all because of something I wrote.\\u201d)\", \"The stage, outfitted like a living-room-size walk-in closet, drips in shades of pink, with pairs of Manolo Blahniks enshrined in glowing chambers (the set design is by Anna Louizos, and lighting by Travis McHale). Sound design by Sadah Espii Proctor cleverly calls up city scenes, from clinking brunch silverware to bustling Midtown traffic. Bushnell breezily cycles through svelte silhouettes from the costume designer Lisa Zinni, in step with the scribe\\u2019s philosophy of fashion as pleasure.\", \"Sexual agency and consumer gratification may no longer represent the very vanguard of modern feminism. (The revelation that Bushnell paid to house her own formidable footwear collection \\u2014 unlike Carrie, whose closet was a gift from Mr. Big \\u2014 perhaps doesn\\u2019t make her bell hooks.) But the imaginative framework that Bushnell laid out in \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d has served as a formative foundation in popular culture \\u2014 and it\\u2019s a fun playground to retread here with its romantic, sunny-voiced architect.\", \"In answer to the title question, Bushnell has decamped to the Hamptons, where she relishes planting vegetables, staying in and hula-hooping. These are the bonus years, Bushnell says, an opportunity to reinvigorate and reap the benefits of self-knowledge. Her own Charlotte, Miranda and Samantha have also moved into the neighborhood, proof of her enduring thesis that friendship is life\\u2019s greatest love story.\"]","href_hash":"68a075ee586011ec831269fcd7873aa7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"68a075ee586011ec831269fcd7873aa7"}},
