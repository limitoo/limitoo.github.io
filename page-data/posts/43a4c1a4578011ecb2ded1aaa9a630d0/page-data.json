Putin of Russia discussed ways to ease mounting tensions in the region.\", \"While the skirmish was not unusual, it was a reminder that even as leaders in Moscow and Washington were engaging in high-stakes diplomatic negotiations, a war that has claimed thousands of lives over the past seven years showed no signs of abating.\", \"A recent influx of Russian soldiers along the border with Ukraine has led to fears of a wider conflagration and the prospect that Russia might be planning an invasion of the eastern European nation. \", \"The exchange of fire on Tuesday broke out at three locations along the so-called line of contact, a roughly 250-mile-long barricade of trenches and fortifications between Ukrainian soldiers and their opponents in a protracted war of attrition.\", \"The Ukrainian side suffered no casualties, according to the press office of the Ukrainian armed services. It was unclear if the separatists had any losses. According to the Ukrainians, it was the separatists who fired first.\", \"\\u201cUkrainian defenders opened fire in response,\\u201d the press service said in a statement, \\u201cand forced the enemy to cease fire.\\u201d\", \"Though such violence occurs almost daily in the region, in this period of explosive tension there are fears that an errant bullet or mortar shell could be all that is needed to touch off a serious escalation.

There were seven soldiers killed in September, two in October and six in November. Last week, a 22-year-old soldier named Valeriy Herovkin became the first killed in December.\"]","href_hash":"43a4c1a4578011ecb2ded1aaa9a630d0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"43a4c1a4578011ecb2ded1aaa9a630d0"}},
