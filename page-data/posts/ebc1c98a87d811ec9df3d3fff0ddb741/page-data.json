The attitude seems to be 'just let anyone into the country and no worries if we all get Omicron'. Anyone who thinks that will work out well for us is deluded,\\\" Midwifery Employee Representation & Advisory Service (MERAS) co-leader Jill Ovens said.\", \"The problem would not be a lack of hospital beds but a shortage of staff if large numbers of health workers are off sick with Omicron, Ovens said.\", \"DHBs and the Ministry of Health are already working with health sector unions on preparedness plans, in anticipation of 20 percent or more staff off sick at any one time, she said.\", \"Already, there are severe shortages in many health professions - midwives, nurses, and allied health. There are maternity units that should have four midwives on duty but struggle to get two.\", \"\\\"I don't think those calling to scrap self-isolation understand we don't have the staff to run our hospitals, aged care facilities and community services even without Omicron circulating.
