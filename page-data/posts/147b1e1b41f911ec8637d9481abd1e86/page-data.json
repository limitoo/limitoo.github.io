And that day they just got on with it.\", \"\\\"New Zealand just don't waste energy on things they cannot control. It is such a vital thing for all sports people. If you start concerning yourself with things that go wrong you can forget about the things that need to go right.\", \"The 61-year-old is particularly complementary of New Zealand's attitude towards match officials and bad decisions that go against him.\", \"Oxenford says on numerous occasions he witnessed a New Zealand player supporting himself or a colleague if the wrong decision was made.\", \"\\\"They can get a 50-50 call against them and they say 'oh well, that is what happens.' If you get a call against them wrong very often they will come up to\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's incredible. It gives umpires confidence the way to umpires the way you think you should. They genuinely wish you well before and during the game. It is nice to be treated like an equal rather than an enemy on the field.\", \"\\\"If you can take all the negative energy out of your psyche it is a great way to go about it. Watching them actually helped me with my umpiring. You think \\\"technology proved I got that one wrong ... that's tough. But I am going to move forward.\\\"\", \"The nexus for the Blackcaps positive outlook on cricket was sewn by Brendon McCullum following the death of former Australian international Phil Hughes, Oxenford believes.\", \"He says McCullum was all about respect for the game, the opposition, fans and officials, and following Hughes' death the former New Zealand skipper implemented those traits within his team.\", \"\\\"They played with absolute freedom after that. They were playing Pakistan in a test in the UAE when it happened. They did not want to play.\", \"\\\"They were talked into finishing the game. When they finally came back they bowled no bouncers and did not appeal. Rod Tucker said to them you have to appeal.\", \"\\\"They basically just went out and slogged and played brilliantly and thought 'why don't we play like this all the time?''\", \"The now-retired umpire is a big fan of the current crop of New Zealand players who play England in the T20 Cricket World Cup semi-finals on Thursday morning.\", \"\\\"Kane Williamson is a ripper. Martin Guptill is a cracker. Their fast bowlers - Trent Boult and Tim Southee are brilliant.''\"]","href_hash":"147b1e1b41f911ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"147b1e1b41f911ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
