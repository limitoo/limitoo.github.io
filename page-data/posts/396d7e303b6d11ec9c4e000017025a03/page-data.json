He and his colleagues came up with a simple experiment. As Bail writes in his recent book, \\u201cBreaking the Social Media Prism,\\u201d they recruited 1,220 Twitter users who identified as either Democrats or Republicans, offering to pay them $11 to follow a particular Twitter account for a month. Though the participants didn\\u2019t know it, the Democrats were assigned to follow a bot account that retweeted messages from prominent Republican politicians and thinkers. The Republicans, in turn, followed a bot account that retweeted Democrats.\", \"At the time, a lot of concern about the internet\\u2019s role in political polarization centered around what the digital activist Eli Pariser once called filter bubbles, a term for the way an increasingly personalized internet traps people in self-reinforcing information silos. \\u201cThe echo chamber idea was reaching its kind of apex in terms of its public influence,\\u201d Bail told me. \\u201cIt nicely explained how Trump had won, how Brexit had happened.\\u201d Bail\\u2019s team wanted to see if getting people to engage with ideas they wouldn\\u2019t otherwise encounter might moderate their views.\", \"The opposite happened. \\u201cNobody became more moderate,\\u201d said Bail. \\u201cRepublicans in particular became much more conservative when they followed the Democratic bot, and Democrats became a little bit more liberal.\\u201d\", \"Social media platforms have long justified themselves with the idea that connecting people would make the world more open and humane. In offline life, after all, meeting lots of different kinds of people tends to broaden the mind, turning caricatures into complicated individuals. It\\u2019s understandable that many once believed the same would be true on the internet.\", \"But it turns out there\\u2019s nothing intrinsically good about connection, especially online. On the internet, exposure to people unlike us often makes us hate them, and that hatred increasingly structures our politics. The social corrosion caused by Facebook and other platforms isn\\u2019t a side effect of bad management and design decisions. It\\u2019s baked into social media itself.\", \"There are many reasons Facebook and the social media companies that came after it are implicated in democratic breakdown, communal violence around the world and cold civil war in America. They are engines for spreading disinformation and algorithmic jet fuel for conspiracy theories. They reward people for expressing anger and contempt with the same sort of dopamine hit you get from playing slot machines.\", \"As the recent Facebook leaks reveal, Mark Zuckerberg has made many immoral and despicable decisions. But even if he were a good and selfless person, Facebook would still probably be socially destructive, just as most other big social media platforms are.\", \"It turns out that in a country as large and diverse as ours, a certain amount of benign neglect of other people\\u2019s odd folkways is more conducive to social peace than a constant, in-your-face awareness of clashing sensibilities. Little is gained when people in my corner of Brooklyn gawk at viral images of Christmas cards featuring families armed to the teeth. And people in conservative communities don\\u2019t need to hear about it every time San Francisco considers renaming a public school.\", \"Right-wing politics has come to revolve around infuriating imagined liberal observers. It\\u2019s as if angry conservatives live with hectoring progressives in their heads all the time. Social media may not have created this mentality, but it badly exacerbates it. After all, there\\u2019s no point owning the libs if none are watching.\", \"The value of psychic distance can apply within communities as well as between them. In 2017, Deb Roy, director of the M.I.T. Center for Constructive Communication and former chief media scientist at Twitter, held informal meetings in small towns to talk to people about social media. Several times, people told him they\\u2019d given up speaking to neighbors or others in town after seeing them express their opinions online. It was the first time, Roy told me, that he heard directly from people for whom social media \\u201cis blocking conversations that otherwise would have been happening just organically.\\u201d\", \"Roy believes that the potential for a healthy social media exists \\u2014 he points to Front Porch Forum, the heavily moderated, highly localized platform for people who live in Vermont. But it\\u2019s notable that his best example is something so small, quirky and relatively low-tech. Sure, there are ways of communicating over the internet that don\\u2019t promote animosity, but probably not with the platforms that are now dominant. In a country descending into a perpetual state of screeching acrimony, we might be able to tolerate each other more if we heard from each other less.\"]","href_hash":"396d7e303b6d11ec9c4e000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"396d7e303b6d11ec9c4e000017025a03"}},
