U.S. customs officials were assisting that effort by adding personnel and screening lines at those alternate crossings to keep people and goods flowing.\", \"Jennifer Frigger-Latham, the vice president of sales and marketing at Emo Trans, a logistics company, said that businesses that needed to ship auto parts, food and other goods across the border were paying extra to reroute the freight through Buffalo, where the crossing remained open, at least for now.\", \"\\u201cIn the current market, people are so used delays and frustrations because of Covid, they\\u2019re much quicker react these days and throw money at the problem,\\u201d she said.\", \"But Linda Dynes, the executive vice president of Canadian operations for Farrow, a 100-year-old custom broker, said finding alternate routes was not always easy.\", \"One crossing between New Brunswick and Maine had not been consistently open over the last week, she said.
