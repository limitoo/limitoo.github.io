But the House is not expected to take up the measure, and administration officials said Mr. Biden would veto it should it reach his desk.\", \"For Republicans who forced the action, it was a prime opportunity to paint the administration\\u2019s efforts to increase coronavirus vaccinations as federal overreach, a central component of their campaign message going into the midterm elections next year. It was also an unusual successful vote for the minority party.\", \"\\u201cThe federal government, elites in Washington, cannot micromanage citizens\\u2019 personal choices without a legitimate basis in the law and the Constitution,\\u201d said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader and a polio survivor who has been an outspoken proponent of coronavirus vaccines. \\u201cAnd that goes double for presidents going far beyond the bounds of their office and their authority.\\u201d\", \"The vaccines have proved to be safe and effective in stemming the spread of the coronavirus. Laboratory experiments also indicated that a booster shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine might provide some protection against the Omicron variant, according to a study published online on Tuesday.\", \"The legislative action is likely to further politicize the pandemic response, particularly as Republican leaders have struggled to quell vaccine misinformation and skepticism in their ranks and draw a distinction between opposing the mandates rather than the vaccines. Republicans, who conceded that they would not be successful in overturning the rule without veto-proof majorities, said they would weaponize the mandate as further evidence of the Biden administration\\u2019s heavy-handed approach to governance and continue to push for action.\", \"\\u201cIf you keep plowing forward with it, and with everything that\\u2019s been done to say that \\u2018Hey, this is falling flat across the country,\\u2019 that\\u2019s his liability,\\u201d said Senator Mike Braun, Republican of Indiana, who spearheaded the effort. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s just another bad subject that he\\u2019s been doctrinaire about and not flexible.\\u201d\", \"The concern from centrist Democrats signaled that some in the president\\u2019s party are wary of fully embracing the mandates beyond those for federal workers and members of the military. Mr. Tester and Mr. Manchin both cited concerns from businesses in their states about the ability to retain workers should the regulation prevail over continuing court challenges.\", \"\\u201cWhat it says is, it was put forth with all the best of intentions, but it\\u2019s putting some businesses in a bind,\\u201d Mr. Tester said before the vote, adding that he was supportive of vaccines as well as federal mandates for health care workers and military personnel. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about certainty for businesses moving forward.\\u201d\", \"With the two Democrats in support, the vote was 52-48 to pass the bill.\", \"The administration previously announced a series of vaccine mandates for health care workers and military personnel; in November, it said that a vaccine and testing mandate would go into effect in January for the private sector. But a federal appeals court kept in place a block on the private-sector requirement. In issuing the rule, the court declared, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration had overstepped its authority.\", \"While some companies welcomed the OSHA requirement as a way to move forward, others have resisted, citing concerns about exacerbating a challenging labor shortage. Some of the largest private employers, including Walmart and JPMorgan Chase, have yet to outline a broad mandate for all employees.\", \"A recent poll of 543 companies by the consulting firm Willis Towers Watson found that 57 percent either require or plan to require Covid-19 vaccinations. That includes 32 percent that plan to mandate vaccines only if the OSHA rule takes effect. Seven percent said they planned to impose regulations regardless of the outcome.\", \"Republicans last week threatened to block a government funding bill over the mandates, which would have led to a shutdown. But they failed to win any Democratic support for a proposal that would have barred funding for carrying out any mandates.\", \"In this instance, Republicans used a once-obscure law, known as the Congressional Review Act, to counter the imposition of the mandate. The law gives Congress the ability to overturn a regulation with a simple majority in both chambers, and it cannot be filibustered in the Senate.\", \"At a news conference on Wednesday, Republican proponents said that while they were vaccinated and wanted their constituents to be as well, the bid to overturn the rule was a referendum on federal overreach and proof of their willingness to fight for the people they represent.\", \"\\u201cEncouraging and requiring are two different things,\\u201d said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia. She charged that the mandate was \\u201ckilling the American spirit of being able to make decisions about yourself.\\u201d\", \"A majority of Democrats denounced the Republican effort as one to undercut the inoculation of Americans. Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said that \\u201ctaking tools out of the toolbox is just plain dumb.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere should be one message and one message only coming from this chamber to the American people,\\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader. \\u201cGet vaccinated, get boosted, and stay safe yourself \\u2014 keep your families, your communities and our country safe.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"96423d8a589111eca8055d9984dbe8fd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"96423d8a589111eca8055d9984dbe8fd"}},
