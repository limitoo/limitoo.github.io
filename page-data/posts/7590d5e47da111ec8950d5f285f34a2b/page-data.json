Kirby, the Pentagon spokesman, said.\", \"Most of the 8,500 troops would take part in a NATO response force that might soon be activated, Kirby said. The remaining personnel would be part of a specific U.S. response to the deepening crisis, Defense Department officials said, most likely to provide assurance to American allies in Eastern Europe who fear that Russia\\u2019s plans for Ukraine could extend to the Baltics and other countries in NATO\\u2019s so-called eastern flank.\", \"The Biden administration continues to insist that the U.S. does not intend to go to war with Russia over the issue. Since Ukraine is not in NATO, the alliance is not bound by its treaty to come to Ukraine\\u2019s defense. But Russia\\u2019s buildup of troops on Ukraine\\u2019s border and NATO\\u2019s response have nonetheless raised the specter of a war that could escalate and widen.\", \"NATO: Some member countries are putting their forces on standby and sending additional ships and fighter jets to Eastern Europe to reassure allies in the region, as Britain joined the U.S. in ordering families of diplomats out of Ukraine, citing \\u201cthe growing threat from Russia.\\u201d\", \"Analysis: Here how U.S. and Russian diplomats could avert a war.\", \"The rapid spread of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus offers \\u201cplausible hope for stabilization and normalization\\u201d in the coming months, thanks to natural immunity through infections as well as vaccinations, Dr. Hans Kluge, the top W.H.O. official in Europe, said in a statement released yesterday.\", \"Dr. Kluge warned, however, that it was too early for nations to drop their guard, with so many people unvaccinated around the world. \\u201cThe pandemic is far from over, but I am hopeful we can end the emergency phase in 2022 and address other health threats that urgently require our attention,\\u201d Dr. Kluge wrote, adding, \\u201cIt is far too early to relax.\\u201d\", \"As nurses and doctors around the world struggle with Omicron cases, evolutionary biologists are engaged in a struggle of their own: figuring out how the variant came to be. Earlier variants differed from the original Wuhan version of the coronavirus by a dozen or two mutations. Omicron has 53 \\u2014 13 of which are rarely, if ever, found in other coronaviruses.\", \"Global trends: The U.S. reported a steady decrease in cases over the past week, to a daily average of about 690,000 new cases on Sunday. Cases in Western Europe appear to be plateauing, while Eastern Europe is still facing surges.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"The military seized power in Burkina Faso yesterday, ousting Roch Marc Christian Kabor\\u00e9, the country\\u2019s democratically elected president, after mutinous soldiers stormed his home. It is the latest in a series of military coups in sub-Saharan African countries struggling to beat back a rising tide of Islamist violence.\", \"Kabor\\u00e9 had been leading Burkina Faso, a poor and landlocked country of 21 million people in Western Africa, since 2015. But he faced growing criticism from soldiers and civilians over his government\\u2019s failure to stem militant attacks that have destabilized broad parts of Burkina Faso, displaced 1.4 million people and caused 2,000 deaths last year alone.\", \"The coup was announced on state television by a fresh-faced officer who said that the military had suspended the Constitution and dissolved the government, and that it was closing Burkina Faso\\u2019s borders until further notice. He introduced Lt. Col. Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, a top commander, as the country\\u2019s new leader.\", \"Kabor\\u00e9: The spokesman gave no indication of the president\\u2019s whereabouts, saying only that he had been captured \\u201cwithout bloodshed\\u201d alongside other civilian leaders and that he was being kept \\u201cin a secure place.\\u201d But there were signs that the ousted president did not go easily.\", \"A longstanding source of local pride and affection, Welsh mountain ponies have seen many of their traditional roles vanish. A new initiative aims to ensure their continued survival.\", \"The soundtrack to Disney\\u2019s \\u201cEncanto\\u201d has hit the No. 1 spot on Billboard\\u2019s top albums chart for a second time.
