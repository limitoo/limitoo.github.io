Safe to say I'm absolutely exhausted,\\\" she said.\", \"As the rest of New South Wales was emerging from lockdown, her family had to stay in after her eight-year-old daughter was exposed to coronavirus at school in the Hunter region.\", \"When that quarantine period ended, it was just five more days before her five-year-old son was exposed to the virus, sending them back into isolation.\", \"\\\"What's to stop this happening again, because my daughter's school had two outbreaks already,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"They're eight and five, they're bored.\\\"\", \"\\\"They just want to be with their friends \\u2026 it just devastates me to see a mental health impact on my eight year old\\\"\", \"It's a frustration shared by thousands of parents across NSW, Victoria and the ACT.\", \"Most of the active clusters currently listed by the Victorian health department are in schools and childcare centres, and virtually every day brings more schools exposed to the virus.\", \"And young people are making up a steadily growing share of each state's infections.\", \"While case numbers are dropping in all age groups in NSW and Victoria, they're falling faster among adults.\", \"And that means younger people \\u2014 who are fast becoming the only groups of unvaccinated people mingling in close quarters \\u2014 are dominating reported\\u00a0coronavirus cases.\", \"People aged 0-19 are close to making up half of NSW's cases each day, and Victoria is trending the same way.\", \"And that's unlikely to change soon, with 5-11 year olds unlikely to be able to get a vaccine before the end of this year.\", \"So how do you keep schools open as the virus circulates, while so many of the people in them remain susceptible to infection?\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Rapid testing could transform outbreak management</div>\", \"The Doherty Institute may offer a way to break free of the vicious cycle, as virus-affected states transition away from chasing COVID zero at all costs.\", \"Research led by the institute has found there may be an alternative that keeps a lid on coronavirus cases, but lets kids stay in the classroom.\", \"The \\\"test-to-stay\\\" regime would mean that rather than sending coronavirus-exposed children immediately home, you would test them every day before school.\", \"\\\"It makes a lot of sense because you do cut off the infectious days spent in school by catching them in the morning before the students go to school,\\\" said Dr Nick Scott from the Burnet Institute, part of the Doherty Institute-led team.\", \"The modelling suggested that using a test-to-stay strategy with classroom contacts would be \\\"approximately equivalent to 7-day quarantine of classroom contacts in both primary and secondary schools, but with a significantly lower number of face-to-face teaching days lost.\\\"\", \"In primary schools, the institute's simulations suggested test-to-stay would result in an average of 27 cases per incursion, compared to 26 under the current regime.\", \"But it would only result in 69 classroom days missed across the outbreak, compared to 256 now.\", \"\\\"The fact that the model comes up with this is validated by the fact that studies in the United Kingdom that have compared both these approaches have found the same thing, that either is as effective as the other,\\\" the Doherty Institute's Professor Jodie McVernon said.\", \"\\\"Obviously, the outcomes for children and the economy and parents and all of those sorts of things are dramatically different.\\\"\", \"Professor McVernon presented the findings to the National Cabinet on Friday.\", \"The Doherty Institute also said twice-weekly surveillance screening of students using rapid antigen testing would \\\"markedly reduce outbreak risk\\\".\", \"That surveillance would, however, slightly increase the number of school days lost, because it will detect and cause the isolation of asymptomatic students who may not have infected any of their classmates.\", \"Victoria has just taken a step in the direction of a test-to-stay system, by cutting quarantine times for students who are primary close contacts.\", \"The state's government yesterday announced that quarantine times will be reduced to seven days if students take a rapid antigen test every day for a week after leaving isolation.\", \"\\\"I've been listening to school communities, parents, carers and students themselves, about the impact that 14 days of isolation has had on them,\\\" Education Minister James Merlino said.\",

family had to go back into isolation.(Supplied: Niki Mahaffey)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Children missing out</div>\", \"Under the current system, parents across the eastern states are counting the cost \\u2014\\u00a0not just in their ability to juggle work and home commitments.\", \"For Ms Mahaffey, it's seeing her children struggle with disruption and missing face-to-face contact with friends and teachers.\", \"\\\"My daughter loves school, she loves learning. She got really low during isolation when she couldn't see her friends. She perked up a bit when they started doing lessons via zoom because at the beginning they weren't,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"There's only so many times we can cook and play Lego and you know, make playdough.\\\"\", \"For families with two working parents, the isolation hokey pokey is even more disruptive.\", \"\\\"I'm lucky in that I don't work, I gave up my job back in March. So I cannot imagine the disruption to other people's lives when this has happened,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"The whole preschool basically shut down, and while I've been in this lockdown with my son, my daughter's school had another case.\", \"\\\"I don't have any hope at the moment.\", \"\\\"It's not sustainable, even if I had to go another week. I said to my husband, 'I can't do this anymore.'\\\"\"]","href_hash":"359ed84640c511ec86a5336d99224f30"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"359ed84640c511ec86a5336d99224f30"}},
