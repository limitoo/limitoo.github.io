A Meta spokesperson told CBS News that West violated policies on hate speech, bullying and harassment, and he can't post on Instagram for 24 hours.\\u00a0\", \"West was responding to a segment on Noah's show from Tuesday that discussed West and ex-wife Kim Kardashian's post-divorce tension. During the clip, Noah accused West of harassing Kardashian and related the domestic abuse he witnessed through his mother, who was shot in the head by his stepfather after their divorce.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"What she's going through is terrifying to watch and shines a spotlight on what so many women go through when they choose to leave,\\\" Noah said.\\u00a0\", \"West wrote racial slurs \\u2013 \\\"Koon baya\\\" \\u2013 pointed at Trevor in a now-deleted Instagram post on Wednesday, according to the Wrap.
