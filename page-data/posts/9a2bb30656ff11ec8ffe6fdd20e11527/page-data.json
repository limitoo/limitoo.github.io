people's spending activity, as well as their spending intentions, rose 2.1 per cent in November, to reach 110.3 points.\", \"It nudges the record high since the index began in 2019, of 111.1 points recorded in December that year.\", \"The bank's chief economist, Stephen Halmarick, said the data showed\\u00a0Australia's\\u00a0economic recovery from the most recent east coast lockdowns was\\u00a0strong.\", \"He explained that this was because households that were unable to undertake their normal spending on many services during lockdowns have been stashing away hundreds of billions
