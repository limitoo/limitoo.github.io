The state\\u2019s leading figures appealed for federal aid, which was promptly granted \\u2014 and rightly so. Helping people and communities in need is what nations are supposed to do.\", \"Observers couldn\\u2019t help noticing, however, that some of the Kentucky politicians asking for aid \\u2014 notably Senator Rand Paul \\u2014 had in the past not only opposed aid for other disaster-struck states but sneered at their pleas. What should we make of this hypocrisy?\", \"The truth is that it runs deeper than \\u201caid for me but not for thee.\\u201d Remarkably, if you look at how the federal budget affects U.S. regions, there\\u2019s a consistent pattern in which conservative states that preach the importance of self-reliance are in fact heavily subsidized by liberal states, especially in the Northeast.\", \"The Rockefeller Institute publishes regular estimates of states\\u2019 \\u201cfederal balance of payments\\u201d \\u2014 the difference between the amount the feds spend in a state and the amount they collect in taxes. In Virginia and Maryland a lot of federal spending consists of the salaries of government workers. Elsewhere, however, it\\u2019s mainly Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, plus some military spending. Here\\u2019s what the map of per capita balances of payments looked like in 2019:\", \"Topping the list of net beneficiaries was, yes, Kentucky, where residents received an average of $14,000 more from Washington than they paid in taxes. To put this in perspective, Kentucky\\u2019s 2019 net inflow of federal funds \\u2014 $63 billion \\u2014 was roughly 30 percent of the state\\u2019s G.D.P. that year.\", \"Economic geographers often interpret regional economies using the \\u201cbase-multiplier model.\\u201d The idea is that what drives a local economy is its \\u201cexport base,\\u201d the stuff it sells to other places; the income generated by that export sector in turn supports jobs in local services, from health care to restaurants. The economy of New York City, for example, is largely driven by the financial industry; the money earned there directly or indirectly supports most of the city\\u2019s other jobs.\", \"So what is Kentucky\\u2019s export base? Not the traditional industries: In 2019, the state, which has more than four million residents, had fewer than 6,000 coal miners, while the distilling industry \\u2014 which, to be fair, has been growing \\u2014 employed only about 5,000 people. On the other hand, more than 250,000 Kentuckians worked in health care and social assistance \\u2014 and who do you think paid for a lot of that? So, in a real sense, Kentucky\\u2019s economy lives on federal dollars.\", \"And that\\u2019s OK! The main reason Kentucky is such a large net recipient of federal funds is that the state is relatively poor \\u2014 it\\u2019s in a region that has to some extent been economically stranded as production and wealth concentrate in large, highly educated metropolitan areas. As a lower-income state, Kentucky receives the full benefit of federal programs like Medicare, but pays relatively little in income or payroll taxes, so it gets much more than it pays in. And that is actually how the social safety net is supposed to work. We want individuals who for whatever reason are hurting financially to receive support from the more fortunate, which necessarily implies large transfers from rich states like New Jersey to lower-income states like Kentucky.\", \"What\\u2019s not OK is when states that are huge net beneficiaries of progressive taxation and the social safety net preen and posture about self-reliance and the evils of big government. It\\u2019s even worse when they assert some kind of moral superiority over the metropolitan areas that pay their bills.\", \"I mean, it\\u2019s amazing that we\\u2019re still doing the thing where small towns and rural areas are held up as the \\u201creal America,\\u201d where politicians from, say, Montana are still lecturing urbanites that they need to get out of the big cities. Yes, it would probably be a good thing if more New Yorkers had a sense of what life is like in Montana. But how many Montanans have a good sense of what life is like in Queens \\u2014 which happens to have twice Montana\\u2019s population?\", \"Not that Queens is the real America \\u2014 or at least no more than anywhere else in this nation. We should see ourselves as one nation. And it would be nice if people in places like Kentucky both accepted that and acknowledged how much they benefit from being part of a greater whole.\", \"Did climate change cause those tornadoes? Not exactly, but it made them more likely.\", \"The troubles of the heartland.\", \"Many Real Americans depend on food stamps.\", \"Remember when Covid was a big-city problem?\", \"Not about tornadoes, but never mind.\"]","href_hash":"1d68da145d0411eca0d451c3ff894cab"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1d68da145d0411eca0d451c3ff894cab"}},
