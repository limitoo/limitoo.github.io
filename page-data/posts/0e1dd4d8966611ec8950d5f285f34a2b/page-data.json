A second person described her as \\\"outraged,\\\" since she believed this conversation was going to be more informative and not a formal deposition.   \", \"\\\"This is not my understanding,\\\" Guilfoyle told the committee, and then said she would cease to continue the conversation until her lawyers had further discussions with the committee about the format, the people said. \", \"A spokesman for the committee declined to comment. \", \"When contacted for comment by CBS News, Joseph Tacopina, counsel for Guilfoyle, issued a statement accusing the committee of leaking details of the exchange. \", \"\\\"Ms. Guilfoyle, under threat of subpoena, agreed to meet exclusively with counsel for the Select Committee in a good faith effort to provide true and relevant evidence,\\\" the statement said. \\\"However, upon Ms. Guilfoyle's attendance, the Committee revealed its untrustworthiness, as members notorious for leaking information appeared. Then, while counsel briefly halted the meeting to address the matter, our concerns about the presence of the Committee's members were validated, as the Committee within less than two minutes leaked news of the break to the media, as Chairman [Bennie] Thompson did only a month earlier when revealing to the press that our client's phone records had been confidentially subpoenaed.\\\"   \", \"The statement went on to assert that when Guilfoyle's lawyers contacted the committee about this story, \\\"they too were shocked and appalled\\\" and believed this story was based on a politically-motivated \\\"leak.\\\" \", \"\\\"It is now abundantly clear to us that their only real interest was to sandbag our client and use today's interview as a political weapon against President Trump and those who support him,\\\" the statement said. \", \"While Guilfoyle has not been issued a subpoena by the committee, she agreed to Friday's conversation with the understanding that a subpoena could be issued if she did not engage with the committee, two of the people said. \", \"It is unclear whether Guilfoyle will reengage with the committee later Friday or in the coming days. \", \" \", \"Robert Costa is CBS News' chief election and campaign correspondent based in Washington, D.C.\"]","href_hash":"0e1dd4d8966611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0e1dd4d8966611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
