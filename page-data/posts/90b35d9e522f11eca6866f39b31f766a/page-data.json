He can't do work experience. He can't even take on a Saturday job.

To actually be in a place where we're booking our medicals and we've had our medicals all uploaded now, it's just like, this thing is actually happening.\", \"\\\"If that comes back saying that we are residents of New Zealand, it will be like we've won $50 million.
