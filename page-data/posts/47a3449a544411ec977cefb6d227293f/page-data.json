While most people have already received their full payment, those who had eligible children in 2021 can claim the Recovery Rebate Credit on their next tax return.\", \"Economic Impact Payments, also known as stimulus checks, that were sent out in 2021 are advance payments of the Recovery Rebate Credit. Those who don't receive the full amount they're owed by December 31 can claim the remainder of the money when they file their taxes in 2022.\", \"Since the 2021 economic impact payments were based on a person's 2020 or 2019 return, any eligible dependents that came into the family in 2021 weren't included in the payment. Those who qualify for the Recovery Rebate Credit can claim the child on their 2021 tax return, which is filed in 2022, according to the Internal Revenue Service.\", \"Payments won't go out as a separate check, as they did in 2021, though. Those who are eligible for an additional payment as part of the American Rescue Plan will receive the credit as part of their 2021 refund.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944542/american-joe-biden-stimulus-checks.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Some Americans who gained a dependent in 2021 could be eligible for a $1,400 payment as part of the Recovery Rebate Credit when they file their taxes in 2022. President Joe Biden delivers remarks on the Omicron COVID-19 variant following a meeting with his COVID-19 response team at the White House on November 29 in Washington, D.C. </div>\", \"Eligible dependents must be under the age of 19 at the end of the year unless they're a student and then they can be up to 24 years old, or any age and permanently and totally disabled. The dependent must also be a child, brother, sister, foster child, stepbrother, stepsister, half-brother, half-sister or a descendent of any of them.\", \"However, to claim a dependent for the Recovery Rebate Credit a taxpayer must meet certain income requirements. Taxpayers are eligible for the full economic impact payment if they have an adjusted gross income under $75,000 or have an income of $150,000 and are married and filing jointly.\", \"The American Rescue Plan increased Child Tax Credit amounts from $2,000 for eligible children to $3,600 for children under 6 and $3,000 for children between 6 and 17 years old. While many people received nearly half their allotted credit in monthly payments going back to July, some will claim their full credit amount when they file their taxes in 2022.\", \"While many are hoping for another stimulus check in 2022, it's not looking likely. A Change.org petition for monthly $2,000 stimulus checks has almost reached 3 million signatures, but legislators have all but taken stimulus checks off the table.\", \"It's unlikely Republicans would back another round of payments given the opposition they had to the third round and they'd likely argue stimulus checks are even less necessary given the increase in vaccinations and businesses reopening. It's also possible Democrats couldn't even get a unified caucus together on the issue, making another round of stimulus checks extremely unlikely to come to fruition.\"]","href_hash":"47a3449a544411ec977cefb6d227293f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"47a3449a544411ec977cefb6d227293f"}},
