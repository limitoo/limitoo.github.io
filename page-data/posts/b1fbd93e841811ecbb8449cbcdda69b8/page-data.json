Ms. McShane, now 36, was intrigued. Mr. O\\u2019Reilly, 38, recalls thinking, \\u201cThere\\u2019s no way we could afford a townhouse.\\u201d\", \"Not on their own, anyway. So they teamed up with Ms. McShane\\u2019s brother and his wife to buy the four-story house for $3.3 million, converting it into two duplexes.\", \"Life in Boerum Hill, with its 19th-century brick and brownstone rowhouses, has allowed the couple to \\u201cbreathe a little deeper than in Manhattan, where we were previously,\\u201d said Mr. O\\u2019Reilly, the president of a co-working company. The \\u201cquaint\\u201d neighborhood is also minutes from amenities including Whole Foods and Trader Joe\\u2019s, he said. (Sure, there were more restaurants and bars on the Lower East Side, their old neighborhood, said Ms. McShane, a lawyer, but they made scant use of them.)\", \"Residents praise the access to transportation, with 13 nearby subway lines \\u2014 though only one station, the F/G at Bergen Street, is inside the neighborhood\\u2019s borders. \\u201cIf you jump on the 2 or 3 train, it\\u2019s 10 to 15 minutes to Wall Street,\\u201d said Howard Kolins, who bought a circa 1899 brick building with a former college buddy in 1987 for $415,000.\", \"Mr. Kolins, a live-events producer, is the president of the Boerum Hill Association, a civic group that has worked to preserve the low-rise character of the neighborhood. To that end, it was instrumental in the creation of the Boerum Hill Historic District, with nearly 250 buildings, in 1973, and the Historic District Extension, with an additional 288 buildings, in 2018.\", \"\\u201cBoerum Hill is, as we like to say, \\u2018a village in the city,\\u2019\\u201d said Sue Wolfe, an agent with Corcoran and a onetime Boerum Hill resident. The neighborhood has long since transcended the time when \\u201cRealtors would have to say \\u2018Brooklyn Heights vicinity\\u2019\\u201d to attract buyers, Ms. Wolfe said.\", \"Now, Mr. Kolins said, \\u201cWe all say, \\u2018Gee, I couldn\\u2019t afford to live here if I was buying today.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"According to a map of Brooklyn Community District 2, Boerum Hill is bounded by Schermerhorn Street to the north; Warren Street to the south (although some say Baltic Street); Court Street to the west; and Fourth and Flatbush Avenues to the east.\", \"With its many Greek Revival and Italianate rowhouses, the neighborhood is part of what\\u2019s known as \\u201cbrownstone Brooklyn.\\u201d Prospective buyers often think of it \\u201calmost like getting out of the city, because you have beautiful treed blocks, the buildings are very historic, you see lots of sky,\\u201d said Tamir Shemesh, an agent with Douglas Elliman. (Mr. Shemesh is currently selling condos at 561 Pacific Street, a 12-story building with a Japanese-inspired aesthetic.)\", \"Thai, Japanese, Italian, French, Mexican, vegan and other cuisines abound at numerous neighborhood restaurants, many of them on Smith Street, a major thoroughfare where \\u201cyou can shop, you can eat, you can get shoes, you can get your nails done,\\u201d Mr. Kolins said.\", \"Cultural offerings include Roulette, a performance venue on Atlantic Avenue, another bustling business corridor, and the Invisible Dog Art Center, housed in an 1863 factory building on Bergen Street.\", \"The area\\u2019s attractions led Ryan Serhant, a real estate agent familiar to viewers of Bravo\\u2019s \\u201cMillion Dollar Listing New York,\\u201d to buy an 8,000-square-foot brownstone on Pacific Street in 2018 for $7.6 million.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s location, location, location,\\u201d Mr. Serhant said. \\u201cI can walk home from a Nets game at the Barclays Center,\\u201d and the trip to his SoHo office \\u201ctakes me 16 minutes by car.\\u201d\", \"One neighborhood concern is the construction of 100 Flatbush Avenue, planned as the city\\u2019s first all-electric tower and the first of two towers in a project by Alloy Development. The developers have scaled back the size of the project, which will include affordable housing and two schools, and have been \\u201cvery responsive,\\u201d Mr. Kolins said, but some residents remain concerned about a 44-story building facing low-rise homes on State Street.\", \"The median price of the 220 condominium and co-op units sold in 2021 was $1.275 million, a 6.3 percent increase over the median price of the 71 units sold in 2020, according to information provided by Ms. Wolfe and her daughter, Lissa M. Wolfe, also of Corcoran. The median price of the 36 townhouses sold during 2021 was $2,937,500, an increase of 2 percent over the median in 2020, when 19 townhouses sold.\", \"As of Jan. 20, 61 homes in Boerum Hill were listed for sale on StreetEasy. The most expensive was a 10-room townhouse at 75 Bond Street, listed for $5.75 million. The least expensive was a 453-square-foot studio at 58 Saint Mark\\u2019s Place, listed for $595,000. (The highest priced condominium was an eight-room home with four bedrooms at 265 State Street, listed for $4.85 million.)\", \"Of the 18 available rentals, the highest priced was a three-bedroom, three-bath apartment at 342 Bergen Street, asking $6,500 a month; the lowest was a four-room unit at 376 Atlantic Avenue, listed for $3,400 a month.\", \"Both worldly and homey, Boerum Hill offers \\u201ca sense of urban life\\u201d while \\u201csomehow feeling like a small village,\\u201d Mr. Kolins said.\", \"The neighborhood \\u2014 whose borders touch other popular areas like Park Slope, Fort Greene, Gowanus and Downtown Brooklyn \\u2014 is home to \\u201ca lot of Wall Streeters and attorneys,\\u201d along with \\u201ca lot of creative people,\\u201d he said. Bringing residents together are a yearly plant sale, a potluck holiday party and a biennial house tour. (In 2020, the house tour was canceled because of Covid-19, but \\u201cwe\\u2019re thinking of doing it this year virtually,\\u201d Mr. Kolins said.)\", \"The Hoyt Street Association maintains Hoyt Street Garden (one of three community gardens), where arts events and story hours are held. The garden is gated, but keys are given out \\u201cto neighbors and those who work nearby,\\u201d according to the association\\u2019s website.\", \"Boerum Hill has been \\u201cmore community oriented than we anticipated,\\u201d said Mr. O\\u2019Reilly, the erstwhile Manhattanite. \\u201cIt\\u2019s nice to walk down the street, and you get a nod from your neighbors.\\u201d\", \"Elementary schools in Boerum Hill include P.S. 261 Philip Livingston, at 314 Pacific Street, and P.S. 038 The Pacific School, at 450 Pacific Street.\", \"In 2020-21, P.S. 261 enrolled 691 students, from prekindergarten through fifth grade. In 2018-19, the most recent school year for which data was available, 58 percent met state standards in English, compared with 48 percent citywide; 53 percent met standards in math, compared with 50 percent citywide.\", \"In 2020-21, P.S. 038 enrolled 547 students, from prekindergarten through fifth grade. In 2018-19, 63 percent met standards in English and 61 percent met standards in math.\", \"M.S. 447 The Math and Science Exploratory School, at 345 Dean Street, enrolled 539 students from fifth through eighth grades in 2020-21. In 2018-19, 83 percent met state standards in English, compared with 47 percent citywide; 85 percent met state standards in math, compared with 41 percent citywide.\", \"While technically only the F and G stop inside Boerum Hill\\u2019s borders (at Bergen Street), other accessible lines include the A, C, B, D, N, Q, R, 2,3, 4, and 5 trains.\", \"According to the Boerum Hill Association, modern Boerum Hill began in the 1960s when a new resident, Helen Buckler, bought and renovated an old brownstone and sought a charming name to attract others to the area. She found it on a 1775 map depicting the 80-acre farm of Simon Boerum. Although there was no hill, the name Boerum Hill was born.\"]","href_hash":"b1fbd93e841811ecbb8449cbcdda69b8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b1fbd93e841811ecbb8449cbcdda69b8"}},
