Before 2014, they were already very pro-European Union\\u2026 At that moment and before 2014, there was no majority. \\u00a0If you polled the nation, we wouldn't have more than 50% of Ukrainians in favor of the NATO membership. Now, we have very high figures of Ukrainians if they ask if they want to be in NATO.
