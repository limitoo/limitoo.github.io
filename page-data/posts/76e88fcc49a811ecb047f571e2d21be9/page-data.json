Come on out!\\u201d to whoever is hiding inside as a police dog whimpers nearby.\", \"Moments later, the officers drag their quarry, a Black teenager suspected of stealing a car, out of the shed and throw him face down on the ground. As they handcuff him behind his back, one officer steps on his head, pushing it into the snow.\", \"\\u201cWhat did you do?\\u201d an officer asks, as a second one steps up and kicks snow in the teenager\\u2019s face. At another point in the encounter, which was captured on police body-camera footage, a different officer puts his foot on the teenager\\u2019s head.\", \"On Friday, two current members of the Ewing Township Police Department in New Jersey and a retired lieutenant were charged in a federal indictment with violating the teenager\\u2019s civil rights by using unreasonable force in the incident. All three defendants are white.\", \"The three officers\\u2019 actions were not only unwarranted, according to the indictment, but also unnecessary because other officers who were arresting the teenager had the matter under control and had not asked for assistance.\", \"Two of the three men charged in connection with the incident \\u2014 Michael Delahanty, the retired lieutenant, and Officer Matthew Przemieniecki \\u2014 face up to 10 years in prison if convicted. The third, Officer Justin Ubry, faces up to a year in prison.\", \"Each of the defendants was released on a $50,000 bond after an initial court appearance on Friday. They are prohibited from leaving the country, and they were ordered to surrender their firearms by Monday. They are scheduled to be arraigned on the charges next week.\", \"Eric Marcy, a lawyer for Mr. Ubry, said his client had done nothing wrong.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s a good police officer, he has a good reputation in the community, and his actions do not constitute a violation of federal criminal civil rights laws,\\u201d Mr. Marcy said in an interview.\", \"A lawyer for Officer Przemieniecki did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Delahanty\\u2019s lawyer could not immediately be reached.\", \"The duty statuses of Officers Przemieniecki and Ubry could not be confirmed on Friday. The township\\u2019s mayor, Bert Steinmann, and the Police Department did not respond to requests for comment.\", \"But Mr. Steinmann told NJ.com on Friday that while they had remained on active duty while federal investigators examined the matter, \\u201cobviously that\\u2019s going to change today.\\u201d\", \"The incident that prompted the charges happened on a frigid morning in January 2018 as officers in Ewing Township, a Trenton suburb, responded to a report of a stolen car.\", \"The vehicle had been in an accident when the officers found it, and they saw the driver run off. A short while later, they found him in the shed.\", \"According to the indictment, Mr. Delahanty was the first officer who stepped on the teenager\\u2019s head in the body-camera footage, which was first made public by The Trentonian. Officer Przemieniecki kicked snow into the teenager\\u2019s face several times, and Officer Ubry did the same, the indictment says.

It was unclear whether he was injured \\u2014 and if so, how seriously \\u2014 in the incident.\", \"The accusations against the officers were first raised by Lalena Lamson, a retired Ewing Township police officer, in a whistle-blower lawsuit she filed against the township in 2019 alleging various acts of wrongdoing in the department, according to The Trentonian.
