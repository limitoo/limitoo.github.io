He is a veteran defense attorney.\", \"The former president hasn't been accused of wrongdoing.\", \"The Washington Post reported on Monday that the Republican Party's executive committee approved the payments in recent weeks, though requests were made in early summer.\", \"The newspaper cited \\\"a person with direct knowledge of the payments.\\\"\", \"The RNC's decision to cover some of Trump's personal legal bills will be seen as an indication that the GOP is still hitched to the former president, and a Republican Party statement to the Post appeared to confirm this.\", \"\\\"As a leader of our party, defending President Trump and his record of achievement is critical to the GOP,\\\" the party said. \\\"It is entirely appropriate for the RNC to continue assisting in fighting back against the Democrats' never ending witch hunt and attacks on him.\\\"\", \"Trump has no official status within the Republican Party and isn't currently an elected official, but he remains the de facto leader of the GOP and has continued to offer endorsements to some Republican candidates.\", \"A series of polls has also shown that Republican voters still favor Trump as the party's candidate for the 2024 nomination, while the former president has repeatedly hinted at another White House run.\", \"Though he may face opponents for the party's nomination including former Vice President Mike Pence, former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Trump is the candidate to beat.\", \"Some Republicans have tried to distance themselves from the former president, with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell repeatedly urging his party to move on from the 2020 election.\", \"However, Trump remains a powerful force in the GOP and his continued claims of voter fraud in the election have found support with many of the party's elected officials.\", \"Even those GOP candidates who've maintained their distance from Trump have found the former president tying himself to them.
