Trump has been grumbling quietly to friends and visitors to his Palm Beach mansion about a rival Republican power center in another Florida mansion, some 400 miles to the north.\", \"Gov. Ron DeSantis, a man Mr. Trump believes he put on the map, has been acting far less like an acolyte and more like a future competitor, Mr. Trump complains. With his stock rising fast in the party, the governor has conspicuously refrained from saying he would stand aside if Mr. Trump runs for the Republican nomination for president in 2024.\", \"\\u201cThe magic words,\\u201d Trump has said to several associates and advisers.\", \"That long-stewing resentment burst into public view recently in a dispute over a seemingly unrelated topic: Covid policies. After Mr. DeSantis refused to reveal his full Covid vaccination history, the former president publicly acknowledged he had received a booster. Last week, he seemed to swipe at Mr. DeSantis by blasting as \\u201cgutless\\u201d politicians who dodge the question out of fear of blowback from vaccine skeptics.\", \"Mr. DeSantis shot back on Friday, criticizing Mr. Trump\\u2019s early handling of the pandemic and saying he regretted not being more vocal in his complaints.\", \"The back and forth exposed how far Republicans have shifted to the right on coronavirus politics. The doubts Mr. Trump amplified about public health expertise have only spiraled since he left office. Now his defense of the vaccines \\u2014 even if often subdued and almost always with the caveat in the same breath that he opposes mandates \\u2014 has put him uncharacteristically out of step with the hard-line elements of his party\\u2019s base and provided an opening for a rival.\", \"But that it was Mr. DeSantis \\u2014 a once-loyal member of the Trump court \\u2014 wielding the knife made the tension about much more.\", \"At its core, the dispute amounts to a stand-in for the broader challenge confronting Republicans at the outset of midterm elections. They are led by a defeated former president who demands total fealty, brooks no criticism and is determined to sniff out, and then snuff out, any threat to his control of the party.\", \"That includes the 43-year-old DeSantis, who has told friends he believes Mr. Trump\\u2019s expectation that he bend the knee is asking too much. That refusal has set up a generational clash and a test of loyalty in the de facto capital of today\\u2019s G.O.P., one watched by Republicans elsewhere who\\u2019ve ridden to power on Mr. Trump\\u2019s coattails.\", \"Already, party figures are attempting to calm matters.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re the two most important leaders in the Republican Party,\\u201d said Brian Ballard, a longtime Florida lobbyist with connections to both men, predicting Mr. Trump and Mr. DeSantis \\u201cwill be personal and political friends for the rest of their careers.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Trump\\u2019s aides also have tried to tamp down questions about the former president\\u2019s frustrations, so as not to elevate Mr. DeSantis.\", \"Still, Mr. Trump has made no secret of his preparations for a third run for the White House. And while Mr. DeSantis, who is up for re-election this year, has not declared his plans, he is widely believed to be eyeing the presidency.\", \"Mr. Trump and his aides are mindful of Republicans\\u2019 increasingly public fatigue with the drama that trails Mr. Trump. The former president\\u2019s false claims about fraud in the 2020 election \\u2014 which Mr. DeSantis has not challenged \\u2014 and his role in the events leading to the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol have some Republicans looking for a fresh start.\", \"Mr. DeSantis is often the first name Republicans cite as a possible Trump-style contender not named Trump.\", \"\\u201cDeSantis would be a formidable 2024 candidate in the Trump lane should Trump not run,\\u201d said Dan Eberhart, a Republican donor. \\u201cHe\\u2019s Trump but a little smarter, more disciplined and brusque without being too brusque.\\u201d\", \"Notably, Mr. Trump, a longtime student of charisma and mass appeal, as well as an avid reader of polling, has refrained so far from publicly attacking Mr. DeSantis, who is a distant but potent second to him in polls on the 2024 G.O.P. field. His restraint is a break from the mockery and bullying he often uses to attack Republicans he perceives as vulnerable. Mr. Trump made no reference to the governor at a rally in Arizona on Saturday.\", \"Mr. DeSantis has $70 million in the bank for his re-election, a war chest he stocked with help from the Republican rank-and-file and donor class, alike. He has raised his profile in the same spaces Mr. Trump once dominated. The governor is ubiquitous on Fox News, where he is routinely met with the sort of softballs that once arced toward Mr. Trump. And he frequently mixes with the well-tanned Republican donor community near the former president\\u2019s winter home in South Florida.\", \"It was not always this way.\", \"Mr. DeSantis was a little-known Florida congressman in 2017, when Mr. Trump, who was then the president, spotted him on television and took keen interest. Mr. DeSantis, an Ivy League-educated military veteran and smooth-talking defender of the new president, was exactly what Mr. Trump liked in a politician.\", \"It wasn\\u2019t long before Mr. Trump blessed Mr. DeSantis\\u2019s bid for governor and sent in staff to help him, lifting the lawmaker to a victory over a better-known rival for the party\\u2019s nomination.\", \"Mr. DeSantis survived the general election and has often governed in a style that mirrors his patron, slashing at the left and scrapping with the news media. But that alone doesn\\u2019t placate Mr. Trump. As with other Republicans he has endorsed, the former president appears to take a kind of ownership interest in Mr. DeSantis \\u2014 and to believe that he is owed dividends and deference.\", \"\\u201cLook, I helped Ron DeSantis at a level that nobody\\u2019s ever seen before,\\u201d Mr. Trump said in an interview for a forthcoming book, \\u201cInsurgency,\\u201d on the rightward shift of the Republican Party, by the New York Times reporter Jeremy W. Peters. Mr. Trump said he believed Mr. DeSantis \\u201cdidn\\u2019t have a chance\\u201d of winning without his help.\", \"The former president\\u2019s expectation of deference from Mr. DeSantis is a reminder to other Republicans that a Trump endorsement comes with a price, a demand that could prove particularly consequential should he run again and have a stable of Republican lawmakers in his debt.\", \"At times, Mr. Trump has sought to kindle his relationship with Mr. DeSantis. He has suggested the governor would be a strong choice for vice president. Similar courtship has helped win deference from other potential rivals. But Mr. DeSantis has not relented.\", \"\\u201cI wonder why the guy won\\u2019t say he won\\u2019t run against me,\\u201d Mr. Trump has said to several associates and advisers, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe private conversations.\", \"Mr. Trump began the recent contretemps by attacking the governor\\u2019s refusal to acknowledge whether he had received a Covid-19 booster shot.\", \"\\u201cThe answer is \\u2018Yes,\\u2019 but they don\\u2019t want to say it, because they\\u2019re gutless,\\u201d Mr. Trump said in a television interview this month, referring only to \\u201cpoliticians\\u201d but clearly alluding to Mr. DeSantis. \\u201cYou got to say it \\u2014 whether you had it or not, say it.\\u201d\", \"Mr. DeSantis\\u2019s response came on Friday in an interview on the conservative podcast \\u201cRuthless.\\u201d Speaking in front of an in-person audience near St. Petersburg, Fla., the governor said one of his biggest regrets was not forcefully opposing Mr. Trump\\u2019s calls for lockdowns when the coronavirus first began to spread in the spring of 2020.\", \"\\u201cKnowing now what I know then, if that was a threat earlier, I would have been much louder,\\u201d Mr. DeSantis said. The governor said he had been \\u201ctelling Trump \\u2018stop the flights from China\\u2019\\u201d but argued he never thought in early March 2020 that the virus \\u201cwould lead to locking down the country.\\u201d\", \"Mr. DeSantis then moved quickly to place blame on Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who advised Trump on the country\\u2019s Covid response, a much safer target with conservatives.\", \"The former president did not immediately respond. Without a Twitter account, his hair-trigger retorts have become less frequent. A spokesman for Mr. Trump also did not respond to requests for comment. An adviser to Mr. DeSantis declined to comment.\", \"Mr. DeSantis, however, has touched on a delicate issue, one of the few on which Mr. Trump is to the left of his party\\u2019s hard-liners: the efficacy of the vaccine and deference to public health experts\\u2019 advice on how to curb the spread of the virus.\", \"Mr. Trump has begun blasting warning shots at Mr. DeSantis and other aspiring Republicans, signaling he intends to defend the vaccines his administration helped develop. In an interview with Candace Owens, a right-wing media personality, the former president said \\u201cthe vaccine worked\\u201d and dismissed conspiracy theories. \\u201cPeople aren\\u2019t dying when they take the vaccine,\\u201d he said.Mr. DeSantis, though, has been much more eager to focus on his resistance to Covid-19 restrictions, past and present, than to make a robust case for vaccination and booster shots.Notably, at his rally on Saturday, Mr. Trump did not promote vaccines and criticized so-called Covid \\u201clockdowns.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Trump\\u2019s loudest antagonists are likely to continue to stoke the tension between the two men. Ann Coulter, the conservative commentator who has fallen out with the former president, delighted in the dust-up this week.\", \"\\u201cTrump is demanding to know Ron DeSantis\\u2019s booster status, and I can now reveal it,\\u201d Ms. Coulter wrote on Twitter. \\u201cHe was a loyal booster when Trump ran in 2016, but then he learned our president was a liar and con man whose grift was permanent.\\u201d\", \"In an email, Ms. Coulter, herself a part-time Florida resident, put a finer point on what makes Mr. DeSantis\\u2019s rise unsettling for the former president. \\u201cTrump is done,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cYou guys should stop obsessing over him.\\u201d\", \"Jeremy W. Peters contributed reporting.\"]","href_hash":"c48239b6775911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c48239b6775911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
