The white marble and stone walls of the Henry Morrison Flagler mansion \\u2014 now a museum of life in the Gilded Age \\u2014 glowed in a wash of spotlights.\", \"At the lookout point, the rooftop bar and pool of the Ben hotel, the voices of nicely turned-out men and women struggled against thumping, party rhythms. The margaritas and sauvignon blanc were flowing.\", \"It was the start of another pleasant evening in the sister cities of the Palm Beaches, fabulously wealthy Palm Beach and the striving business city of West Palm Beach.\", \"They and nearby Boca Raton \\u2014 another place with more than its share of Bentleys, Aston Martins and Maseratis \\u2014 often see a surge in visitors in early December when their art museums \\u2014 the Norton Museum of Art and the Boca Raton Museum of Art \\u2014 attract spillover audiences from the tens of thousands of art lovers going to Art Basel Miami Beach. This year the museums are presenting strong Latin American exhibitions in contrast to the mostly contemporary work at Art Basel.\", \"A couple of days in the Palm Beaches and Boca Raton gives you plenty of time to go to the exhibitions and take a look around.\", \"In Palm Beach, Ta-Boo and Bilboquet are popular restaurants on Worth Avenue, a promenade of high-end resort wear, jewels and art galleries.

A few minutes\\u2019 drive north of downtown West Palm Beach, manatees, the curious, lumbering sea mammals, congregate in the cooler months in warm water spilling from a power plant on the Intracoastal Waterway. It is a sanctuary called Manatee Lagoon.
