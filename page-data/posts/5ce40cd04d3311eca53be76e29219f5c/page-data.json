of running the country to his deputy as rival fighters approach the capital Addis Ababa.\", \"The 45-year-old prime minister, a Nobel Peace Prize winner and former soldier, arrived at the front on Tuesday, government spokesman Legesse Tulu told reporters without giving details on the location.\", \"Deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen is handling day-to-day government activities, Mr Legesse said.\", \"The war in Africa's second-most populous nation is estimated to have\\u00a0killed\\u00a0tens of thousands of people, and countries including France, Germany and Turkey have told their citizens to leave immediately as rival fighters from Ethiopia's northern Tigray region advance.\", \"Last month Tigrayan forces and their allies threatened to march on the capital Addis Ababa, sparking fears the country could spiral into all-out civil war.\", \"US envoy Jeffrey Feltman told reporters on Tuesday that he fears that \\\"nascent\\\" progress in mediation efforts with the warring sides could be outpaced by the \\\"alarming\\\" military developments.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/bfad65000b266ae9cde69f74b2cf5807\\\"

2018, and a growing political rift turned to war in November 2020.\", \"\\\"Unless there is some kind of divine intervention, I don't see any chance for a peaceful resolution through dialogue because the positions are highly polarised,\\\" said Kassahun Berhanu, professor of political science at Addis Ababa University.\", \"He added that he believed Mr Abiy's decision to go to the front is \\\"aimed at boosting popular morale\\\".\", \"The Tigray forces have said they want to march on the capital to oust Mr Abiy and install a new government.\", \"Mr Abiy's government wants the Tigray forces, which it has designated as a terrorist group, to withdraw to their region.\", \"The Prime Minister this week not only announced he would go to the battlefront but also invited Ethiopians to join him, the latest call for every able citizen in the country of more than 110 million people to join the fight.\", \"\\\"Let's meet at the war front,\\\" Mr Abiy wrote on Monday.\", \"Hurried military trainings and allegations of forced conscription have occurred in recent months, while analysts have warned of the growing presence of ethnic-based militias as the military was said to be
