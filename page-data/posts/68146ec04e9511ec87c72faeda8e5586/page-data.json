Mr. Lewis\\u2019s best friend already has an outfit picked out. And Marisol Sanchez, Mr. Lewis\\u2019s mother, says she will throw a party outside the local police station: She has a bakery on standby, to make the cake.\", \"For more than three months, the group has gathered each morning on a corner in the Bronx, at a makeshift shrine to Mr. Lewis, 21, a local kid with a big smile who was shot and killed at a nearby bodega in August. On a chilly October evening \\u2014 two months to the day since they lost \\u201cJ.J.,\\u201d as Mr. Lewis was known \\u2014 they all gathered again, sharing memories and fantasizing about the day his killer is caught.\", \"\\u201cI have a strong feeling they\\u2019re going to find him soon,\\u201d Ms. Sanchez said.\", \"But that was more than a month ago. She is still waiting.\", \"In the years before the pandemic, the New York Police Department was solving nearly 90 percent of the murder cases in the city. But in 2020, as shootings and homicides increased, the percentage of homicides the police solved, a statistic known as the clearance rate, plummeted to around 60 percent, according to the department\\u2019s records.\", \"The impact fell especially hard in the Bronx, where shootings reached their highest levels in nearly 15 years. This year, the police are solving around 62 percent of murders in the borough, said Lt. William O\\u2019Toole, who leads the Bronx\\u2019s homicide squad. In addition, he said, 17 murder suspects \\u2014 including the man the police believe killed Mr. Lewis \\u2014 have been identified and have active warrants issued against them.\", \"But, Lieutenant O\\u2019Toole said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s harder with the pandemic.\\u201d\", \"In a city blanketed with surveillance equipment and video cameras, the police say some of the city\\u2019s most dangerous pockets do not have enough. The widespread use of masks during the pandemic has made it more difficult to identify assailants, they say. And, the police say, new discovery laws that allow the names of informants to be turned over to defense lawyers have deterred many potential witnesses from coming forward.\", \"\\u201cThe increase in shootings, that\\u2019s got to have a negative impact on clearance rates,\\u201d said Peter Moskos, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \\u201cTheir caseload literally doubled overnight. The odds are never great. That\\u2019s the unfortunate truth.\\u201d\", \"The challenge is particularly acute for gang- and drug-related homicides, which the police believe may have been an impetus for Mr. Lewis\\u2019s killing, with his killer possibly mistaking him for another man.\", \"\\u201cThe dynamics that play out with gang and drug homicides are in neighborhoods that typically don\\u2019t have very good relationships with law enforcement, so they question whether they\\u2019re able to trust the police with sharing information they might have,\\u201d said Anthony Braga, a criminology professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\", \"In the Bronx, Lieutenant O\\u2019Toole said, officers have noticed much more reluctance when speaking to the community, a phenomenon he attributes to the state\\u2019s discovery laws. \", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not for lack of trying,\\u201d Lieutenant O\\u2019Toole said of the rate of unsolved homicides. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not getting a lot of community help.\\u201d\", \"For Ms. Sanchez, much of that rings hollow. Her son was not known by the police to affiliate with any gang or drug activity. His shooting was caught clearly on video. And the man who pulled the trigger was not wearing a mask. The gunman\\u2019s face, fully visible on video footage, has haunted her.\", \"In the weeks after Mr. Lewis died, Ms. Sanchez and her husband, Joseph Trinidad, were patient. The police said they identified a suspect within hours, but they did not want to release his picture, for fear of scaring him out of New York, Ms. Sanchez said. As the months have dragged on, she and her husband have grown frustrated at the lack of progress.\", \"Between each monthly balloon release, a hard question looms: What if the phone call never comes?\", \"Mr. Lewis spent nearly all of his short life in the Bronx, most of it on Bainbridge Avenue, where he lived with his parents and two younger brothers. A prankster with a big appetite, he was known for calling \\u2014 not texting \\u2014 friends and family, and for his fiercely protective nature.\", \"After his death, neighbors recounted stories of Mr. Lewis escorting women and children home. One friend said that Mr. Lewis would often pay for a car to take her to and from her overnight job, so she didn\\u2019t have to walk alone to a bus stop.\", \"Ms. Sanchez, who was born and raised in the borough, knew the dangers that lay outside her doorstep for a teenage boy in the Bronx. She and her husband painstakingly kept Mr. Lewis off the street \\u2014 he wasn\\u2019t allowed to be outside at night, and kept busy with odd jobs and school. He had friends who had been to jail, but he eschewed street life and urged friends to pursue work or creative outlets like rapping or clothing design.\", \"\\u201cThe block ain\\u2019t it,\\u201d he used to say, friends recalled. As a teenager, Mr. Lewis participated in the New York Marine Cadets. He dropped out of high school briefly before pursuing his G.E.D., and participated in Summer Youth, an employment program, in the Bronx.\", \"Mr. Lewis had passed his nursing test in July, and intended to start school in September. He had a small group of close friends, would help his parents with anything but unloading the groceries, and was known for showering friends with money whenever he had it. For years, Mr. Lewis would spend time at the bodega down Bainbridge Avenue, chatting with the owner. He was there so often the man brought in an extra folding chair and set it up behind the counter.\", \"That\\u2019s where Mr. Lewis was headed on Aug. 13, when he stepped out to get a soda. He shouted to his mother that he was going to the store, and asked if she needed anything; she said she didn\\u2019t, and he left.\", \"Seconds later Mr. Lewis returned, as if he had forgotten something.\", \"\\u201cI love you, Mami,\\u201d he shouted through the door. It was the last time Ms. Sanchez heard her son\\u2019s voice.\", \"What happened in the next 20 minutes has left the police perplexed and Mr. Lewis\\u2019s family with precious few answers.\", \"Mr. Lewis walked down Bainbridge Avenue to the bodega. Video footage from inside shows him picking up a bottle of water. As he stands at the counter, the gunman \\u2014 whom the police identified as Kemel Smith \\u2014 is seen approaching Mr. Lewis from behind. He silently shoots Mr. Lewis seven times, and walks calmly out of the store; Mr. Lewis crumples to the floor.\", \"The shop\\u2019s owner, with whom Mr. Lewis had spent so many afternoons, closed Mr. Lewis\\u2019s eyes, Ms. Sanchez said. Her son was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. Mr. Smith, who the police say was known in the area to sell marijuana and cocaine, does not appear to have returned to the neighborhood since.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t have anything concrete,\\u201d said Lieutenant O\\u2019Toole. There is no indication that Mr. Lewis and Mr. Smith had any kind of rivalry, or even knew each other.\", \"After months of quietly searching for Mr. Smith, the police finally released the suspect\\u2019s mug shot to the media in October. The release devastated Ms. Sanchez, who saw it as confirmation that officers did not have any idea where her son\\u2019s killer might be.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t understand how they haven\\u2019t caught him yet,\\u201d she said recently, at a Halloween party thrown in honor of Mr. Lewis. Dressed in a \\u201cBeetlejuice\\u201d costume (\\u201cJ.J. used to love \\u2018Beetlejuice,\\u2019\\u201d she said), Ms. Sanchez tried briefly to embrace the celebration, but instead sat quietly in the corner. Her two younger sons would not come to the event, she said. They had refused to celebrate the holiday without their older brother.\", \"\\u201cI know his mother wants a lot of questions answered about what happened,\\u201d said Lieutenant O\\u2019Toole. \\u201cThey live it every day. They get up and their son\\u2019s not there.\\u201d\", \"But, he said, the police had been looking for Mr. Smith for only three months.\", \"\\u201cWe have his name, we have his photo,\\u201d Lieutenant O\\u2019Toole said. \\u201cEventually, we usually get the answers.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"68146ec04e9511ec87c72faeda8e5586"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"68146ec04e9511ec87c72faeda8e5586"}},
