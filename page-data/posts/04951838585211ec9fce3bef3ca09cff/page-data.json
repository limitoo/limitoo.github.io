She\\u2019s not the first: The female self-image has long been fodder for critics like John Berger (\\u201cMen look at women. Women watch themselves being looked at\\u201d), Sigmund Freud (cf. \\u201cthe castration complex\\u201d) and the film theorist Laura Mulvey, who wrote in 1975 that \\u201cin a world ordered by sexual imbalance, pleasure in looking has been split between active/male and passive/female.\\u201d\", \"McCormack continues these lines of inquiry, contemplating the various familiar, circumscribed shapes the female figure has been forced to take on the canvas: dead, floating Ophelias; endless sacrosanct Madonnas; denuded women of leisure; persecuted wives; coquettish nymphs and wrathful deities \\u2014 fetishized and tragic all. Yes, McCormack says, women sometimes peer; but at least within the canon, they are mostly peered at.\", \"This is the author\\u2019s second book after 2019\\u2019s \\u201cThe Art of Looking Up,\\u201d a survey of classical ceiling art, from the azul tiles of the Iranian Imam Mosque to the Medici frescoes in Italy. Her more polemical follow-up is as incisive and provocative on the subject of motherhood as was \\u201cMatrescence and Maternality,\\u201d a two-part exhibition she guest curated at Richard Saltoun Gallery in London in 2019 and 2020.\", \"\\u201cWomen in the Picture\\u201d opens with a rather pedestrian encounter from the author\\u2019s own experience. On a visit to the National Gallery in London, her infant child bouncing on her hip, McCormack is approached by a male stranger, who tells her, \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t look too deeply into the symbolism in this one.\\u201d She is gazing at \\u201cThe Story of Griselda,\\u201d a 15th-century triptych whose central focus is \\u201ca longhaired woman surrounded by a lot of men in tights and a menagerie of animals. In the painting, men talk a lot.\\u201d Fleeing the stranger\\u2019s \\u201ctedious \\u2018mansplaining,\\u2019\\u201d McCormack finds no refuge around the corner, where she sees hanging another Renaissance painting of \\u201ca woman on the ground with her throat pierced, oozing blood from her jugular and with a deep gash on her forearm, her wrists already hooked with rigor mortis; her high round breasts and gently curving stomach egregiously exposed.\\u201d\", \"Such archetypical figures, branded into the collective consciousness, order the book\\u2019s chapters. Venus, befittingly the first, is especially engrossing, her range of poses encompassing the celestial (\\u201cVenus Coelistis was thought of as a pure and unearthly body of a woman which stimulated thoughts about divine love and the beauty of the soul\\u201d) and the earthly (\\u201cVenus Vulgaria was the earthbound Venus associated with fertility, sex, procreation and the beauty of the living world\\u201d). The chapter \\u201cMaidens and Dead Damsels\\u201d implores us to query our own responses to Titian\\u2019s painting \\u201cThe Rape of Europa.\\u201d \\u201cDo we share Europa\\u2019s desperation?\\u201d she writes. \\u201cOr do we quicken with the thrill of conquering her?\\u201d A stellar section called \\u201cMonstrous Women\\u201d asks if \\u201cMedusa was originally a Black African deity from Libya \\u2026 a question that classics scholars have wanted to shrug off and undermine.\\u201d\", \"However, McCormack\\u2019s analysis snags on pop culture. She recounts public disagreements over female pubic hair, from celebrities to Cosmopolitan polls (\\u201cthe female body is gripped by societal expectations about hairless pubic regions \\u2014 expectations that are codified by the smoothness of Venus images\\u201d); menstrual politics on Instagram, which censored the poet Rupi Kaur in 2015 for posting a photo of herself lying in bed, her sheets and pajamas stained with menstrual blood; and Kim Kardashian\\u2019s 2014 Paper Magazine cover, a glass \\u201cperched on her anatomically impossible (photoshopped) butt.\\u201d The relitigation of these issues reads as an attempt to be \\u201ctopical,\\u201d which feels unnecessary given the timeliness of the work overall.\", \"\\u201cWomen in the Picture\\u201d mounts a sensitive and probing critique of the motifs, the preordained poses and affectations of the female figure in art. If feminism aspires to render itself obsolete, McCormack\\u2019s project too yearns for a future when critiquing such postures \\u2014 the flayed victims, the temptresses and the sexless \\u201cmammies\\u201d \\u2014 will no longer be necessary. For now it is.\"]","href_hash":"04951838585211ec9fce3bef3ca09cff"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"04951838585211ec9fce3bef3ca09cff"}},
