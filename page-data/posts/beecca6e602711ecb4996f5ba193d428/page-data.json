I've been terrified because the reality is, it's got to show up here at some point and I think as soon as we start hearing about cases in Wellington I will not be going on any local buses anymore and taxis would end up being for an absolute emergency,\\\" Kaye said.\", \"She was angry she had been put in this position.\", \"\\\"We've done the right thing, we've got our shots and we need the transport to get to where we're going, or we're stuck but we can't risk it,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"A lot of us have got disabilities and we're at high risk - like, in the case of epilepsy getting a fever can trigger seizures quite badly, so we don't want to be getting sick.\\\"\", \"COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said the Government had been careful to balance the need to keep people safe from the virus while ensuring everyone could access necessities like food, medicine and transport.\", \"Kaye said in the Government's effort to be inclusive, it had excluded a large number of people.\", \"\\\"There are thousands and thousands of New Zealanders who cannot drive on medical grounds - I wish the people who made the rules would think about this.

Some are doing separate vaccinated only and mixed.\", \"\\\"Again, with public transport they have conducted risk assessments for their drivers and are mandating vaccinations.\", \"\\\"We did recommend to NZTA and MoT [Ministry of Transport] that it would be sensible for the Government to mandate public transport due to its essential nature. A number of operators run both school and public transport services, so it would have made sense for consistency and good risk management, but Cabinet did not see it that way,\\\" McFadgen said.\", \"The New Zealand Taxi Federation wrote to the Minister for COVID-19 response, the Minister of Health and the Minister of Transport earlier this month, explaining its members did not feel safe under the current settings.\", \"* Name changed to protect privacy\", \"RNZ\"]","href_hash":"beecca6e602711ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"beecca6e602711ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
