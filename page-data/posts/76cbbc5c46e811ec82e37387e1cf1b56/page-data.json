Lawmakers in the worst-hit regions are leading a nationwide debate over whether Spain should reintroduce more restrictions to prevent a serious Covid-19 resurgence this winter.\", \"The Basque regional government said that all areas in which the infection rate exceeds 150 cases per 100,000 inhabitants should suspend mass events and other gatherings, in particular those where food and drinks were served and where social distancing could not be guaranteed. The region\\u2019s 14-day average infection rate climbed just above 180 per 100,000 inhabitants this weekend, compared with a nationwide rate on Monday of 82 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, according to Spain\\u2019s health ministry.\", \"The regional government said it would also ask the Basque judiciary to mandate proof of Covid-19 vaccination for people seeking to enter restaurants and nightclubs.\", \"\\u201cWe are not doing well,\\u201d Gotzone Sagardui, the regional health minister, told a news conference, adding that the virus was again spreading \\u201cwith a worrying speed of growth.\\u201d\", \"Spain\\u2019s health regulators lowered the country\\u2019s status to \\u201clow risk\\u201d in October after a plunge in the nationwide infection rate from a summer peak of over 700 cases per 100,000 inhabitants in late July. That improvement was largely attributed to a successful vaccination campaign, and 79 percent of the population is now fully vaccinated.\", \"Booster shots are now being given to people who are over 70 or living in nursing homes, and Spain\\u2019s government is expected to soon offer vaccinations to children under 12.\", \"At the same time, however, the country\\u2019s pandemic response has recently involved a patchwork of restrictions put in place by regional governments, which are responsible for health care.\", \"I\\u00f1igo Urkullu, the Basque region\\u2019s leader, has led a push to require vaccination in certain business sectors \\u2014 as has happened sweepingly in Italy and some other countries \\u2014 and has urged Spain\\u2019s central government to set nationwide rules.\", \"Ximo Puig, the leader of the eastern region of Valencia, also said recently that his government was considering whether to require vaccination passes for entry into some venues.\"]","href_hash":"76cbbc5c46e811ec82e37387e1cf1b56"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"76cbbc5c46e811ec82e37387e1cf1b56"}},
