In minutes, Kenosha police officers arrived at the woman\\u2019s home.\", \"Mr. Blake, who is Black, appeared to be trying to enter the car and had a knife in one hand when Rusten Sheskey, a white officer, shot him seven times. Several of Mr. Blake\\u2019s children were in the back seat of the car.\", \"The police shooting, which was captured on a bystander video, came during a summer of anger and demonstrations across the country over police violence following the murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. Protests erupted in Kenosha, too, but attention quickly shifted from the shooting of Mr. Blake to the fires and looting that were unfolding in Kenosha.\", \"Only days after Mr. Blake was shot, Mr. Rittenhouse, who lived about 30 minutes away in Antioch, Ill., brought a semiautomatic rifle that was stored in Wisconsin to downtown Kenosha, where he said he wanted to protect businesses and provide medical care.\", \"Mr. Rittenhouse, 18, who is facing five felony counts, has testified that he was defending himself from the three men he shot during a chaotic evening along the streets of Kenosha.\", \"He is charged with reckless homicide in a first shooting, in which he killed Joseph Rosenbaum, who Mr. Rittenhouse said was chasing him and lunged at his gun.\", \"After Mr. Rittenhouse fell to the ground while jogging away from a group of people pursuing him after the first shooting, he fatally shot Anthony Huber, who had swung a skateboard at him. He was charged with intentional homicide \\u2014 a count often called murder in other states \\u2014 in the death of Mr. Huber, who was a friend of Jacob Blake\\u2019s and had been there for protests.\", \"Seconds later, Mr. Rittenhouse shot another man in the crowd, Gaige Grosskreutz, after Mr. Grosskreutz moved toward him while holding a handgun, leading to a count of attempted intentional homicide. He also faces two charges of endangering safety by pointing his gun at two people.\", \"Jurors began deliberating over the charges shortly after 9 a.m. on Tuesday and went home in the evening without reaching a verdict. They will return on Wednesday morning for more deliberations.\", \"The group of 18 possible jurors who watched the trial was winnowed down to 12 through a process that is unusual but a tradition in Judge Bruce Schroeder\\u2019s court. Eighteen slips of paper with the jurors\\u2019 numbers were placed into a brown container that was spun around, and then Mr. Rittenhouse himself drew six of the papers out of the contraption; those jurors were dismissed, though they were asked to remain at the courthouse as alternates if one of the 12 jurors suffers an illness or is dismissed during deliberations.\", \"As they were deliberating, the jurors asked for copies of the first part of the jury instructions that have to do with self-defense. Later, they asked for the rest of the instructions. Otherwise, they had no questions for the judge on Tuesday.\", \"Outside the courthouse, a small group of Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s supporters and detractors gathered and occasionally squabbled with each other in front of a throng of reporters.\", \"Justin Blake, Mr. Blake\\u2019s uncle, has spent most days on the courthouse steps, where he has waved a Pan-African flag and said he believed that Mr. Rittenhouse should be convicted. Bishop Tavis Grant, a pastor and activist in East Chicago, Ind., said he hoped the attention on Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s trial would bring more scrutiny on another decision he found unacceptable: a choice by the Kenosha County district attorney, announced in January, not to charge Officer Sheskey in the shooting of Jacob Blake.\", \"Mr. Blake has rarely spoken publicly since the shooting, but he told CNN in August that he \\u201cdidn\\u2019t agree\\u201d with destructive protests over police conduct but that he understood why they had taken place. He also said he believed that Mr. Rittenhouse was treated differently by the police because he is white.\", \"\\u201cFor the reasons they said they shot me, they had every reason to shoot him, but they didn\\u2019t,\\u201d CNN quoted Mr. Blake as saying about Mr. Rittenhouse. \\u201cHonestly, if his skin color was different \\u2014 and I\\u2019m not prejudiced or a racist \\u2014 he probably would have been labeled a terrorist.\\u201d\", \"On Tuesday, Justin Blake said it was important for his nephew to stay busy.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s just trying to do something that engages him and gets his mind moving and keeps him off thinking of bad things,\\u201d Justin Blake said. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a Blake. We shake and we go. It\\u2019s in our DNA \\u2014 we don\\u2019t stop.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6d3bd9f1474311ecaeb78b6ee2a6b943"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6d3bd9f1474311ecaeb78b6ee2a6b943"}},
