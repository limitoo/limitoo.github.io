Here are eight books to be grateful for, wherever you are: New poetry collections from the great Patrick Rosal and Frank Bidart, novels about the lives (and deaths) of women in North Dakota and South Korea, a posthumous spy story from the beloved John le Carr\\u00e9. The New York Times Magazine\\u2019s ambitious and far-reaching 1619 Project has been turned into an even more ambitious and far-reaching book, the political insider Huma Abedin offers a revealing look at her public and private lives, and the religion reporter Mark Oppenheimer explores grief and resilience in a Jewish neighborhood haunted by violent tragedy. These books aren\\u2019t \\u201ceasy reading\\u201d \\u2014 the stories they tell can be complicated and uncomfortable, uncompromising \\u2014 but they pursue their truths tirelessly and often beautifully, and that\\u2019s a good reason to give thanks, anytime.\", \"Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowles\", \"THE 1619 PROJECT: A New Origin Story, edited by Nikole Hannah-Jones, Caitlin Roper, Ilena Silverman and Jake Silverstein. (One World, $38.) A revised and expanded version of a series of essays first published in The New York Times Magazine in 2019, this essential book delivers an account of America\\u2019s entanglement with slavery and its legacy, from the country\\u2019s colonial beginnings to today, that is cogent, meticulous and revelatory. \\u201cDespite what demagogues claim,\\u201d Adam Hochschild writes in his review, \\u201chonoring the story told in \\u2018The 1619 Project\\u2019 and rectifying the great wrongs in it need not threaten or diminish anyone else\\u2019s experience, for they are all strands of a larger American story. Whether that fragile cloth holds together today, in the face of blatant defiance of election results and the rule of law, depends on our respect for every strand in the weave.\\u201d\", \"LEMON, by Kwon Yeo-sun, translated by Janet Hong. (Other Press, $20.) This taut South Korean novella \\u2014 about the murder of a beautiful teenage girl, as recalled from the alternating perspectives of three women who knew her \\u2014 is not so much narrated as spilled, confessed, blurted out. \\u201c\\u2018Lemon\\u2019 should be read slowly and closely in order to appreciate it when Kwon pulls off what I can describe only as a sleight of hand,\\u201d Oyinkan Braithwaite writes in her review. \\u201cHer sentences are crisp, concise and potent; just one contains as much meaning as two or three of your average storyteller\\u2019s. \\u2026 Her hypnotic effect will stay with the reader long after the last page has been read. You\\u2019ll wish there were more; but you\\u2019ll be grateful it ended as it did.\\u201d\", \"SILVERVIEW, by John le Carr\\u00e9. (Viking, $28.) The great espionage writer\\u2019s last completed novel features a young bookstore owner in an English seaside town who gets caught in the machinations between two cunning spymasters, as le Carr\\u00e9 reveals an intelligence agency marred by political factions and morally questionable acts. \\u201cIn le Carr\\u00e9\\u2019s world of cunning stratagems, the question is not only whether they will work but whether they will be worth it, Joseph Finder writes in his review. \\u201cIf \\u2018Silverview\\u2019 feels less than fully executed, its sense of moral ambivalence remains exquisitely calibrated.\\u201d\", \"BOTH/AND: A Life in Many Worlds, by Huma Abedin. (Scribner, $30.) Hillary Clinton\\u2019s longtime aide opens up about the 2016 election and the very public dissolution of her marriage in this memoir. Abedin shows readers what it was like to be in rooms where decisions are made while bearing the burden of unimaginable choices of her own. \\u201cIt\\u2019s clear from the outset that this book is not a sidekick\\u2019s tale, but the story of a person of substance \\u2014 someone determined to tell her own story,\\u201d Susan Dominus writes in her review. \\u201cThe catalog of her Job-like suffering \\u2014 the shame to which she was subject for actions other than her own \\u2014 is at times excruciating to read; but it is as if in uttering those episodes aloud, she ensures that they do not own her.\\u201d\", \"SQUIRREL HILL: The Tree of Life Synagogue Shooting and the Soul of a Neighborhood, by Mark Oppenheimer. (Knopf, $28.95.) In 2018, a shooter killed 11 people at the Tree of Life synagogue in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood of Pittsburgh. Oppenheimer\\u2019s propulsive narrative traces the aftermath as residents bury and mourn, organize rallies, and field the onslaught of national media and \\u201ctrauma tourists.\\u201d \\u201cOppenheimer paints the portrait of an urban neighborhood that never ceded its tightknit Jewish population to the suburbs,\\u201d Irina Reyn writes in her review. \\u201cHow \\u2018Mister Rogers\\u2019 Neighborhood\\u2019 became the site of the most deadly antisemitic attack on American soil and what happened afterward unfold with the precision of the best suspense stories.\\u201d\", \"O BEAUTIFUL, by Jung Yun. (St. Martin\\u2019s, $27.99.) A journalist risks everything to chase a scoop in the oil fields of her native North Dakota, only to discover it\\u2019s not the story she was expecting. This mesmerizing and timely novel, the author\\u2019s second, provides an on-ramp into conversations about racism, environmentalism, journalism, economics and sisterhood. \\u201cThe loudest voices in \\u2018O Beautiful\\u2019 are the ones we never hear,\\u201d Elisabeth Egan writes in her latest Group Text column. \\u201cThey\\u2019re the perspectives and experiences of women who have disappeared\\u201d \\u2014 principally, \\u201cthe 28 women, teenagers and girls (\\u2018a figure that\\u2019s both shockingly high and surely an undercount\\u2019) from the Mahua tribe who have been reported missing over a period of two years. When Elinor turns her attention to their stories, her article \\u2014 and her future as a woman of words \\u2014 begins to take shape.\\u201d\", \"THE LAST THING: New & Selected Poems, by Patrick Rosal. (Karen & Michael Braziller/Persea, $26.95.) Physical exuberance takes flight in Rosal\\u2019s poetry, which counters emotional and historical pain with sheer delight in the body. His newest work abandons realism for dream visions and monologues. \\u201cThe language in these pages remains visceral, demotic, open to all comers and capable of neat aural effects,\\u201d Stephanie Burt writes in her review. \\u201cRosal\\u2019s lively vernacular \\u2014 especially in the lengthier, newer poems \\u2014 can sound almost improvised, proudly suited for oral delivery: The poems invite us to hear them out loud.\\u201d\", \"AGAINST SILENCE, by Frank Bidart. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $25.) Bidart\\u2019s poems float and swerve, at once cinematic and oddly intimate. Here he seems interested in individual and collective ethics, and sees a threat in silence \\u2014 both the kind that opposes speech in life and the kind found in death, which we\\u2019re all up against. \\u201cBidart is exciting to read and hard to explain,\\u201d Daisy Fried writes, reviewing the book alongside four other recent poetry collections. \\u201cBidart is dispassionate but never detached; at his most thinky he often seems most tender. His poems recognize, and help us recognize, the inherent harm in what we hold dear, defend and even worship.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c3c5dc9a4d6411ec862b43431b41bdcf"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c3c5dc9a4d6411ec862b43431b41bdcf"}},
