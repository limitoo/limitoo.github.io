played out.\", \"\\\"Have you got any strong feelings about possible shark mitigation at all?,\\\" one journalist asked Mr Millachip's widow on Sunday, the day after he disappeared.\", \"It seemed the public discussion around the 57-year-old father's death would head down the well-trodden path of drum lines and shark culls.\", \"But a press conference on Monday took things in a different direction when Fisheries Minister Don Punch said the\\u00a0WA Government was looking to install more shark enclosures.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"That's part of our $17 million shark hazard mitigation program, and we've set aside funding for shark enclosures,\\\" Mr Punch said.\", \"Local councils\\u00a0are encouraged to apply for funding for an enclosure, which are delivered in partnership with the government, he said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Few WA beaches have enclosures despite funding offer</div>\", \"Yet\\u00a0WA only has a handful of enclosures dotted across the state.\", \"Sorrento, Quinns, Coogee and Cottesloe beaches are the only locations with enclosures in Perth.\", \"In the South West, only Dunsborough, Busselton and Middleton beaches are protected.\", \"Esperance and Albany will also have their own barriers soon, bringing the state's total to nine.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/377a1766764f29e0522333b657753372\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

WA, do so few beaches have that kind of protection for swimmers?\", \"One of the most obvious reasons is that enclosures don't work for every beach.\", \"Coogee Beach is one example of a spot they do work, after the City of Cockburn went its own way and installed one without government funding in 2014.\", \"\\\"In terms of the swimming and recreational activities people do at Coogee Beach, it's well suited to that in terms of swimming and small paddle sports and stuff like that,\\\" the City's marina and coastal engineering officer, Jon McKay, said.\", \"<img

Coogee Beach is well suited the conditions.\\u00a0(Supplied: City of Cockburn)</div>\", \"\\\"I imagine it's probably less suitable for surfing and activities like that, that need wide, open expanses of water, and also I know it's more challenging to implement in more exposed, open ocean locations,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"Mr Punch said he is not sure why more local governments have not taken up the government's offer.\", \"\\\"I'm absolutely available for any local government that wants to look at beach mitigation and to work with them in terms of shark mitigation and beach mitigation issues,\\\" he said.\", \"Cockburn's barrier costs the city around $90,000 each year to lease.\", \"Asked whether other locations had been deterred by the cost, Mr Punch said: \\\"No council has raised that with me\\\".\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Shark barriers remain\\u00a0controversial\\u00a0</div>\", \"One swimmer at Port Beach on Monday told the ABC he was concerned about animals getting stuck in the net.\", \"While that might have been the case for older-style enclosures, Mr McKay said Cockburn had not experienced any similar issues with barriers installed by local company Eco Shark Barrier.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c9f258e58a7e5531c6cfd9aa2afc6c8b\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The council says the nets have given swimmers \\\"peace of mind\\\".(Supplied)</div>\", \"\\\"That was a key consideration for the city in initially installing the barrier,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We have had instances where fish or seals or dolphins have made their way into the barrier, usually during winter if there's been some storm damage.\", \"\\\"On those occasions, either the animal's swum out itself, or Eco Shark Barriers themselves will come down and let down one section of the barrier and the animal will swim out again.\", \"Mr McKay said the barrier had also helped bring more people to the beach by giving swimmers \\\"peace of mind\\\".\", \"\\\"I know that people do travel from far afield within the metro area to swim at Coogee beach because of the shark barrier,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"Even more controversial though is other kinds of mitigation strategies open to authorities, like drum lines.\", \"In the wake of the attack that claimed Mr Millachip's life, a number of Port Beach regulars stridently opposed any measure that could harm sea life.\", \"\\\"That's their habitat, the ocean.
