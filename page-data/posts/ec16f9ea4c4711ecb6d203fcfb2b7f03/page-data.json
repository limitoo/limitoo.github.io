Few performers are shy when it comes to discussing their influences and obsessions, but in DeBose\\u2019s telling, it\\u2019s impossible to separate any step of her career from the people who helped her get there.\", \"She has indeed been in good company. Growing up in Raleigh, N.C., DeBose began dancing competitively at age 7 \\u2014 she says she \\u201cstarted with the whole \\u2018ballet, tap, jazz\\u2019 of it all\\u201d \\u2014 and dreamed of becoming a backup dancer for Madonna. Soon after finishing high school, she was a finalist on the reality TV show \\u201cSo You Think You Can Dance.\\u201d And over the past decade, she has starred in six back-to-back Broadway musicals and booked two stage-to-screen adaptations, the most recent of which, Steven Spielberg\\u2019s \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d comes out next month. But while her list of collaborators includes greats like Lin-Manuel Miranda \\u2014 she played a supporting role in the original production of \\u201cBring It On: The Musical\\u201d in 2011 and the Bullet in \\u201cHamilton\\u201d from 2015 to 2016 \\u2014 as well as Robert De Niro (\\u201cA Bronx Tale\\u201d), Adrienne Warren (\\u201cBring It On\\u201d), Diane Paulus (\\u201cPippin\\u201d), LaChanze (\\u201cSummer: The Donna Summer Musical\\u201d) and the entire starry cast of Ryan Murphy\\u2019s \\u201cThe Prom\\u201d (2020), it\\u2019s her offstage relationships especially that would make any up-and-comer swoon.\", \"While still in high school, she joined the actors Charlotte d\\u2019Amboise and Terrence Mann\\u2019s musical theater summer intensive, Triple Arts, at Western Carolina University, and the legendary stage couple took DeBose under their wing, coaching her for auditions and encouraging her to skip college and go straight to Broadway. Following that advice paid off \\u2014 \\u201cI had the benefit of learning in real time,\\u201d DeBose says \\u2014 and she was soon cast in \\u201cBring It On.\\u201d When the cheerleading acrobatics that that show required began to take a toll, DeBose\\u2019s mother suggested she rush a different show to cheer herself up, and she caught a performance of the 2011 revival of \\u201cFollies.\\u201d She was so mesmerized by the veteran actress Jan Maxwell\\u2019s turn as former showgirl Phyllis Rogers Stone that she left a note for her at the stage door afterward. Months later, DeBose received a call from a friend who was starring alongside Maxwell; apparently, Maxwell, having related to the professional doubts DeBose had expressed in her note, had taped it to her dressing room mirror for inspiration. The two women struck up a friendship that lasted until the older actress\\u2019s death in 2018.\", \"Such a charmed arrival onto the New York theater scene is almost unheard of and, aware that her current wealth of opportunities is rare, DeBose is determined to prove herself worthy of them. \\u201cI don\\u2019t ever want anybody to look at my work and think, \\u2018Why does she have that when they could\\u2019ve hired someone else?\\u2019\\u201d she says. \\u201cI don\\u2019t ever want to ask myself, \\u2018Did I do enough?\\u2019\\u201d It\\u2019s not impostor syndrome, she assures me, but rather a perfectionist impulse \\u2014 one that led her, for example, to brush up on her little-used tap skills last year for her role as an old-timey schoolmarm in Apple TV\\u2019s musical series \\u201cSchmigadoon!\\u201d (2021); in between shooting in Vancouver she would take Zoom classes and watch YouTube tutorials in her hotel room.\", \"In other ways, too, there is something distinctly 21st century about DeBose\\u2019s career. Besides being an openly queer woman of Afro Latinx descent, she has bounced from role to role \\u2014 often with little time to prepare \\u2014 in a way that is reflective of our current gig economy. In the 1960s and \\u201970s, a performer with her skill set might have been cast in a single musical and ridden the wave of its success for years, touring with the production around the world and resting on the laureled association. But DeBose\\u2019s ability to move quickly through roles has reaped its own rewards: She has earned a Tony nomination and won a Chita Rivera Award \\u2014 both for her most recent Broadway appearance, as Disco Donna, one of the leads in \\u201cSummer\\u201d \\u2014 among other accolades. Her dancing in that show, as in each of her performances, had the precision and dynamism of a lifelong performing arts kid who stopped formal training just before conservatory programs could overwrite her natural inclination toward wild abandon. And so she can put her mark on choreographic work whether it is more exacting, as in \\u201cHamilton,\\u201d or looser, as in \\u201cBring It On.\\u201d She credits her versatility, too, to her knack for meeting directors and choreographers where they are. \\u201cMost creators are very intense, and each has their own brand of intensity, their own language,\\u201d she explains. \\u201cI think part of the reason I\\u2019ve been able to continue to book jobs is because I chose to learn how to speak other people\\u2019s artistic languages quickly.\\u201d\", \"And, yet, she admits she was nervous, understandably, when Spielberg called to personally offer her the role of Anita, the Nuyorican bridal shop employee who leads \\u201cAmerica,\\u201d the crackling paean to immigrant double consciousness in \\u201cWest Side Story.\\u201d \\u201cNot only am I remaking \\u2018West Side Story,\\u2019 but I\\u2019m stepping into Rita Moreno\\u2019s shoes \\u2014 and she is beloved not only by Latinos but by the entire industry and musical fandom,\\u201d DeBose says. \\u201cI had to really search my soul.\\u201d But Moreno herself \\u2014 who won an Oscar for her performance as Anita in the 1961 film, and who both executive produced and stars as Valentina, an updated version of the original\\u2019s Doc, in the new adaptation \\u2014 encouraged DeBose to make the role her own and offered herself as a sounding board during production. \\u201cI genuinely like the woman she is, and mentorship, especially for young women, is beautiful and hard to come by in this industry,\\u201d DeBose says.\", \"Humility aside, DeBose says she would love to originate a character, and laments the lack of dance-heavy roles created for new stars, naming Charity Hope Valentine (\\u201cSweet Charity\\u201d) and Roxie Hart (\\u201cChicago\\u201d) as the last of the greats. A coy smile wraps around her coffee cup when I ask her, quoting Oprah Winfrey\\u2019s 2021 interview with Meghan Markle, \\u201cWho is having that conversation?\\u201d \\u2014 namely that of staging a \\u201cSweet Charity\\u201d revival. It\\u2019s a fool\\u2019s game to dream-cast any artistic project \\u2014 especially when that project is an as-yet-unplanned Broadway revival of a 1966 production that doesn\\u2019t get much lip service these days \\u2014 but the idea of DeBose as the meandering dancer for hire who has \\u201cso much love to give,\\u201d and longs for a brighter future with her two best friends, lingers for the rest of our conversation.\", \"When the subject changes to DeBose\\u2019s love of the \\u201cMamma Mia!\\u201d movies, she explains that it\\u2019s the chemistry between Meryl Streep\\u2019s character and her two friends that most appeals to her. Earlier, she mentioned, too, the maternal energy that underpins the relationship between her Anita and Rachel Zegler\\u2019s Maria in \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d and, aware of the support she received from Moreno, I ask if the three actresses might ever put on denim overalls and do aerial splits on a Greek island. \\u201cHonestly, Rita could still do the jumps,\\u201d DeBose says with a laugh. \\u201cTo have your best girls always have your back, and to be able to laugh and cry and sing \\u2018Chiquitita\\u2019 to each other, that\\u2019s all I could ask for.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ec16f9ea4c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ec16f9ea4c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}},
