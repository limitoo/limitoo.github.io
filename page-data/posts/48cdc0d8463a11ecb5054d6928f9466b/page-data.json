His comments come as the U.S. has urged the European Union to stay vigilant of Russia's movements, but the bloc's diplomats do not believe that the country will attempt to invade neighboring Ukraine anytime soon despite noticing its military growth.\", \"In a move condemned by the West and other world leaders, Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine in 2014. The same year, pro-Russia separatists began seizing land in eastern Ukraine, and Russia continues to support the rebels that still control some territory there today, the AP reported.\", \"Ukraine also alleges that Russia has kept tens of thousands of troops and military equipment near their shared border since earlier this year. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said last week that the numbers of Russian troops were close to 100,000, BBC reported.\", \"Though Stoltenberg did not outrightly say Monday that Russia may be making preparations to invade Ukraine, he did advise Moscow to be more open about its military expansion.\", \"\\\"We call on Russia to be transparent about its military activities,\\\" Stoltenberg told reporters. \\\"It is important to prevent escalations and reduce tensions.\\\"\", \"\\\"We see an unusual concentration of troops, and we know that Russia has been willing to use these types of military capabilities before to conduct aggressive actions against Ukraine,\\\" Stoltenberg said.\", \"The White House has also spoken out about Russia's recent military buildup.
