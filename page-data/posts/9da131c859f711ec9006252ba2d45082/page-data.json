They insist the job market, with a 4.2 percent unemployment rate, has never been better, delivering wage gains for lower-paid workers that Mr. Biden believes will help lift more people into the middle class. They say those benefits will endure for years, even once inflation, which accelerated at its fastest pace in 40 years last month, cools down.\", \"The struggle is also entwined with Mr. Biden\\u2019s fight against Covid. Administration officials say that the anxiety voters are expressing to pollsters is less about the economy and the president\\u2019s handling of it and more an expression of pent-up frustration with a pandemic that has persisted for nearly two years.\", \"White House officials say they have no plans to shift Mr. Biden\\u2019s messaging on economic issues, even as poll after poll shows his approval ratings in decline and voter worry over inflation swamping all other views of the economy. Their strategy remains focused on stressing the administration\\u2019s work to spread vaccinations and end the pandemic without further lockdowns, cheering the nation\\u2019s progress in economic growth and promising that Mr. Biden\\u2019s policies will bring down prices for oil, food and consumer goods.\", \"\\u201cEvery economic indicator shows an economy that is growing, that is stronger, that is creating jobs, that is putting more money in people\\u2019s pockets, and that is in part a result of President Biden\\u2019s economic agenda,\\u201d Kate Bedingfield, the White House communications director, said in an interview. \\u201cI think what you hear from the president is that he understands that when people experience a higher price at the grocery store or at the gas pump that has an impact on their budget, and so he\\u2019s doing everything in his power to bring those prices down.\\u201d\", \"Still, there is an economic and political chasm on inflation between the administration and American voters. Recent polls by Monmouth University, CNBC and even the liberal Navigator research group show rising anxiety over the issue and warning signs for the Democrats who control Congress ahead of the midterm elections. Consumer confidence surveys show price increases are denting Americans\\u2019 optimism for the economy in the year ahead. The University of Michigan\\u2019s survey of consumers shows Americans have lower expectations for the growth of their incomes, adjusted for inflation, over the next year than they have since the waning years of the Obama administration.\", \"Administration officials have consistently underestimated the size and persistence of price increases throughout this year, declaring at regular intervals that they would abate as various pandemic-related challenges worked their way through the global economy. On Friday, after the Labor Department reported that prices rose at their fastest annual rate since 1982, Mr. Biden issued a statement saying the data did not reflect more recent trends, which he said showed prices moving down for cars and gasoline, among others.\", \"\\u201cToday\\u2019s numbers reflect the pressures that economies around the world are facing as we emerge from a global pandemic \\u2014 prices are rising,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut developments in the weeks after these data were collected last month show that price and cost increase are slowing, although not as quickly as we\\u2019d like.\\u201d\", \"While Mr. Biden has acknowledged the pain people are feeling from price increases, he and his top aides continue to say that the overall economic picture is brighter than consumer surveys suggest, a disconnect that polls show could pose political problems for the president and fellow Democrats in the 2022 elections. They see the economy showing signs of what liberal economists have long said is the recipe for delivering the full gains of economic growth to low-paid and middle-class workers, even after factoring in rising prices.\", \"The ingredients include a tight labor market, where job openings far outnumber job seekers and employers are being forced to raise wages for workers in retail stores and restaurants. And they include robust government aid programs over the last two years that have helped American workers build up savings, pay down debt and avoid the threat of eviction or foreclosure even amid economic hardship.\", \"Officials point to estimates by Arindrajit Dube, an economist at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, that find the lowest-paid 70 percent of American workers have seen wage increases over the last two years even after accounting for inflation. They say the raises and pandemic aid programs, including direct checks to low- and middle-income households and an expanded tax credit for parents that has been delivered in monthly payments, have given typical households an inflation-adjusted increase in how much money they have to spend.\", \"Administration aides read those statistics, and some survey data like Americans\\u2019 belief that jobs are plentiful, as evidence that Americans are happier with their economic situations than would be expected from reading and watching what they call unbalanced coverage of the economy in the news media. Cable news networks mentioned \\u201cinflation\\u201d more than 10 times as often last month than they have in a typical month since 2009, according to data from the Internet Archive analyzed by the GDELT Project. Since July, they have mentioned \\u201cinflation\\u201d more often than \\u201cunemployment\\u201d for the first time since 2009.\", \"\\u201cI have never seen a stronger labor market than the one we\\u2019re seeing today,\\u201d Jared Bernstein, a member of Mr. Biden\\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview. \\u201cIt is accomplishing something that is at the absolute core of Biden-nomics, which is providing bargaining clout to middle- and low-wage workers at a level that we haven\\u2019t seen in decades.\\u201d\", \"But other measures suggest workers are correctly perceiving a slowdown or reversal in their real wage gains. An analysis by Jason Furman of Harvard University, a former top economist for President Barack Obama, shows most workers have seen slowing inflation-adjusted wage gains \\u2014 or even wage declines \\u2014 that have worsened as price increases heated up this year. Friday\\u2019s Consumer Price Index underscored the point, showing surging prices for rent, cars, gasoline and household staples like cereal and eggs.\", \"\\u201cThe real economy is doing quite well both in absolute terms and somewhat well relative to expectations,\\u201d Mr. Furman said in an email. \\u201cInflation and real wages, however, are terrible.\\u201d\", \"The president has in recent weeks painted a bifurcated picture of the economy in speeches and news releases. He promotes what he calls historic progress on several measures. But he quickly turns to acknowledging the sticker shock that families have experienced at the grocery store, the gasoline pump and a variety of online shopping sites.\", \"\\u201cEconomic growth is stronger here than virtually any other nation,\\u201d Mr. Biden said on Friday. \\u201cAmericans have more money in their pockets than this time last year \\u2014 $100 more each month than last year \\u2014 even after accounting for price increases. But we have to get prices and costs down before consumers will feel confident in that recovery. That is a top goal of my administration.\\u201d\", \"While Mr. Biden\\u2019s comments are aimed broadly at voters, they have a singular intended audience in Congress: Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a centrist Democrat, who has cited inflation as a reason not to back a $2.2 trillion collection of spending programs and tax cuts that Mr. Biden is attempting to pass through Congress by year's end, jeopardizing the bill\\u2019s prospects.\", \"Mr. Biden will need every Democrat in the Senate to support the measure for it to pass. Mr. Manchin has in recent days repeated his fear that the spending in the bill, which includes initiatives to fight climate change and invest in children, parents and workers, could exacerbate price increases further \\u2014 a claim that administration officials and Mr. Biden say is unfounded.\", \"Republicans have used inflation as a club against the bill and Mr. Biden\\u2019s popularity. \\u201cThere would never be a good time to pass the Democrats\\u2019 reckless tax-and-spending spree,\\u201d Senator Shelley Moore Capito, Republican of West Virginia, said on Friday, \\u201cbut these inflation numbers indicate that now is the absolute worst time for Democrats to do just that.\\u201d\", \"Many liberal groups fear that messaging is hampering Mr. Biden\\u2019s agenda, which would deliver on a wide range of longstanding progressive priorities for the economy, like investments in universal prekindergarten and in reducing the cost of child care. Those groups have urged Mr. Biden to pin the blame for rising costs not on his policies, but on large corporations that progressives say are leveraging their market power to hike prices and pad profits.\", \"The American economy gives large companies the power \\u201cto jack up prices on the backs of workers and consumers,\\u201d said Rakeen Mabud, the managing director of policy and research at the Groundwork Collaborative, a progressive advocacy group in Washington. \\u201cThat\\u2019s exactly what we\\u2019re seeing now. And that\\u2019s exactly why this fear-mongering around inflation is proving so effective.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9da131c859f711ec9006252ba2d45082"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9da131c859f711ec9006252ba2d45082"}},
