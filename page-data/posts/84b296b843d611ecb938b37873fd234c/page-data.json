In the Netherlands, a partial lockdown will see indoor venues close early and sporting events held without spectators, Reuters reported.\", \"Schallenberg has rejected the idea of a lockdown for everyone, saying he did not want the two-thirds of vaccinated Austrians to be forced to face the same lockdown as the unvaccinated, although other restrictions may apply to everyone.\", \"During a visit to Bregenz in the west of the country on Thursday, he said: \\\"I don't see why two-thirds should lose their freedom because one-third is dithering. For me, it is clear that there should be no lockdown for the vaccinated out of solidarity for the unvaccinated.\\\"\", \"He also warned that the unvaccinated face an \\\"uncomfortable\\\" winter and Christmas, and lamented that the proportion of the population that was vaccinated\\u2014about 65 percent\\u2014was \\\"shamefully low.\\\"\", \"Measures were put in place this week to curb COVID and encourage vaccinations.\", \"From Monday, unvaccinated people who had not recovered from an infection, were barred from restaurants, hotels, hairdressing salons and large public events.\", \"In October, Schallenberg announced lockdown restrictions for the unvaccinated should be put in place once coronavirus patients take up 30 percent of ICU beds. COVID patients currently take up around a fifth of ICU beds, according to Reuters, with the numbers rising.\", \"Authorities are also looking at implementing a vaccine mandate for some professional groups. \\\"We can break this wave together,\\\" Schallenberg said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931335/student-vaccinated-vienna.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A student is vaccinated against the coronavirus (Covid-19) at a vocational school in Vienna on September 14, 2021.
