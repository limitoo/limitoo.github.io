Or the Omicron Family Restaurant in Wisconsin. Or to be a member of one of the various fraternities, sororities and honor societies whose names feature an \\u201cOmicron\\u201d \\u2014 maybe more so if there\\u2019s also a \\u201cDelta\\u201d in there.\", \"In May, the World Health Organization announced that it would start naming Covid-19\\u2019s \\u201cvariants of interest\\u201d after Greek letters. The policy was meant to simplify the technical names of variants and head off confusion caused by naming diseases after geographical locations. (The Spanish Flu, for example, did not actually originate in Spain.)\", \"\\u201cDelta\\u201d is easier to remember than \\u201cB.1.617.2.\\u201d But if your business has an Omicron in its name, you might wish more people were talking about the B.1.1529 variant.\", \"Dr. Harshil Shah, the director of Omicron Sensing, an electrical manufacturer in Mumbai, said that news of the variant has affected the company\\u2019s web presence. \\u201cOur name used to be on the first page when you search for Omicron,\\u201d Dr. Shah wrote in an email. Now, its website is buried behind page after page of news about the coronavirus pandemic.\", \"Omicron Sensing is one of many organizations whose name was benign a few weeks ago but now calls to mind a highly transmissible variant of concern. Now, they are grappling with marketing strategies as they find themselves at a tangent to the biggest news story of the last two years: Covid-19 and its growing list of mutations.\", \"The question is, do they embrace the connection?\", \"Omicron Energy, a company that sells testing equipment for electrical systems, was so named because its founder, Rainer Aberer, thought Greek letters evoked technical expertise and mathematics. Today, a statement on Omicron Energy\\u2019s website reads: \\u201cThere is nothing we can do about this hopefully short-lived connotation.\\u201d (The Omicron variant is being closely monitored; early data show that it is highly contagious but may cause milder symptoms than other variants.)\", \"The Delta Omicron International Music Fraternity, one of several fraternal organizations that share a name with two Covid variants of interest, projected similar patience and stoicism in a statement, saying its members were \\u201cbemused at the coincidence,\\u201d but that its members \\u201cdo not anticipate any change to the work we do.\\u201d\", \"Epidemics, disasters and other tragedies have been known to give previously neutral names a sudden charge. Ayds, an appetite-suppressing candy, had been sold for decades before the AIDS epidemic turned its commercials into morbid camp artifacts.\", \"At first, the company doubled down. \\u201cLet the disease change its name,\\u201d a spokesperson for Ayds told Advertising Age in 1986. But by 1988, its chairman told The New York Times that sales of Ayds had fallen by more than 50 percent.\", \"Hurricane Katrina had a similar impact on the popularity of the storm\\u2019s namesake. Following the 2005 storm, the number of Social Security card applications for babies named Katrina dropped precipitously, according to government data.\", \"And the CBC reported in September that some people who share a first name with Osama bin Laden are still feeling the personal repercussions 20 years after 9/11.\", \"In the case of Omicron, some are meeting the naming overlap with benign curiosity or humor.\", \"Tara Singer, the president and chief executive of the Omicron Delta Kappa honors society said that she wasn\\u2019t concerned about the public relations impact of the Omicron variant on her organization. \\u201cDelta Air Lines weathered this well, so we will, too,\\u201d she said in a phone interview.\", \"Delta Air Lines is recovering from a serious, pandemic-induced decline in business (as is the airline industry in general). Still, the Delta variant was a tricky subject at the company. A spokesperson for Delta told The Times that, internally, employees often refer to \\u201cthe variant\\u201d rather than invoking the company name.\", \"The airline also responded with a bit of humor. Henry Ting, the company\\u2019s chief health officer, wrote on Twitter: \\u201cWe prefer to call it the B.1.617.2 variant since that is so much more simple to say and remember.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Singer noted that some Omicron Delta Kappa members have been having fun with the coincidence. She recalled hearing another member say that if a Kappa variant hits, \\u201cthen I\\u2019ll go get a Corona beer.\\u201d\", \"The Omicron Family Restaurant in West Bend, Wis., is taking the double puns of Omicron and Corona one step further. Last Friday, it began offering a bottle of Corona beer with a T-shirt that reads \\u201cI Got Corona at Omicron\\u201d for $15.\", \"John Tsiampas, the restaurant\\u2019s manager, said he has noticed an uptick in foot traffic since the variant emerged. \\u201cSome will stay and eat, some just come for a photo and then they leave,\\u201d he said in a phone interview.\", \"Mr. Tsiampas\\u2019s father and uncle opened the restaurant in 1990 after emigrating from Greece in the 1960s, and chose the name Omicron to honor their Greek heritage and to stand out from other restaurants.\", \"While Mr. Tsiampas acknowledges that there is some baggage to the name today, he\\u2019s grateful that it was chosen over his father\\u2019s other top name choice: the Burning Bush.\", \"\\u201cWe were like, \\u2018Yeah, we\\u2019re not doing the Burning Bush,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Tsiampas said. \\u201cWe\\u2019d get too many comments about that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"d257d58d5d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d257d58d5d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}},
