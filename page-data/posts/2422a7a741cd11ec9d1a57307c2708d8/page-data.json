Especially when it\\u2019s a literary behemoth like Tolstoy\\u2019s \\u201cWar and Peace.\\u201d\", \"The epic undertaking \\u201cwas a thrill because I\\u2019m a Black African-English woman, and I have a perspective which I invite the audiences to join me on,\\u201d said Newton, who has reclaimed the spelling of her name given at birth. \\u201cI give my emotion to it. I encounter Napoleon \\u2014 Thandiwe does. I encounter Natasha. I comment with the way I breathe and the energy I put in my body and voice as I digest the different ideas that Tolstoy puts forward, different values.\\u201d\", \"Still, there were moments far less wondrous.\", \"\\u201cI practically gag in passages where he\\u2019s talking about Negroes,\\u201d she said. But when the Audible representatives asked whether she wanted them removed, \\u201cI said, my God, no. It\\u2019s essential that we see his ignorance, that we feel his lack when he\\u2019s so brilliant writing about the psychology of men and war and philosophy and history.\\u201d\", \"Newton has turned that eye of evaluation on her own life and career. She is an executive producer of \\u201cPresident,\\u201d a documentary about the first presidential election in Zimbabwe after Robert Mugabe resigned. The film had just been nominated for a Gotham Award and shortlisted by IDA Documentary Awards. She has wrapped \\u201cGod\\u2019s Country,\\u201d about a Black professor who relocates from New Orleans to Montana and finds herself the victim of mysterious bullying. And she is currently in Los Angeles shooting the fourth season of HBO\\u2019s \\u201cWestworld.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBut after that, I don\\u2019t want to be hired as an actress anymore,\\u201d said Newton \\u2014 her passions now more aligned with empowering others, writing and producing, and stepping in front of the camera only on her own terms. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to give myself anymore. I\\u2019ve come to the end of it \\u2014 and I feel amazing. I feel full.\\u201d\", \"Still, she went on, \\u201cthe way I\\u2019ve been treated as a woman of color being an actor, the stories that I haven\\u2019t been able to tell, the limited characters that I\\u2019ve had to frustratingly wrestle with to provide truth, the pain I\\u2019ve suffered over being treated badly in work situations, and also the sad, sad waste \\u2014 because I know that there\\u2019s so much more I could have done \\u2014 I\\u2019m now really tired. I just don\\u2019t feel that it\\u2019s worth what I put in.\\u201d\", \"These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"1. Critical Race Theory The academic endeavor of critical race theory is to reveal what is already happening, which is that we are progressing, we are evolving, and it\\u2019s important that we document our progress. And people who want things to stay the way they have been, because it has benefited them to enslave Africa, to exploit India, to abuse South America \\u2014 you name it, humans have done it. We\\u2019re a grubby lot. But we are making progress because every living entity wants to heal. Every living thing is trying to move towards the sun.\", \"2. Documentaries, Especially Werner Herzog\\u2019s I think you could put a spotlight on literally anybody and create a documentary. And I love documentary because it asks us to really look, really see, really witness. If I could only talk about one, I want to talk about Werner Herzog for sure. \\u201cGrizzly Man\\u201d is an absolute epic. That\\u2019s a Shakespearean character right there, Timothy Treadwell [who lived with bears in Alaska, and was killed by one].\", \"3. Shona-to-English Translator My mother speaks five different African languages, but Shona is her first. It\\u2019s the language of her childhood, her people, her history, her original culture. And I don\\u2019t speak it. And the more I\\u2019ve been encountering modern Zimbabwe, looking at my own history, wanting to create an archive for my children, the more I\\u2019ve been trying to update my vocabulary. So my Shona-to-English translator has become a real pal in recent years.\", \"4. Music as Protest I\\u2019m discovering myself through music at the moment in a really interesting way, and it\\u2019s kind of mirroring my experience as a woman, as a mother. I\\u2019m loving Cleo Sol right now. I love music as protest. I think songwriters, singers, are shamans. They are touching a divine \\u2014 certainly not all \\u2014 but they open up the landscape of their spirit, their soul. I think of people like Tommy Yorke, Billie Eilish \\u2014 performers, creatives, artists who touch a nerve, almost like an acupuncture when you hit that meridian and it just taps into something.\", \"I\\u2019m fascinated by Kanye West \\u2014 Ye, as he now is. I\\u2019m interested in the art, commerce, media, religion, protest, personal trauma, how that\\u2019s all playing out in his work. I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s healthy for one person to be so obsessed to have the spotlight on them. One of the sad things about our time is that we\\u2019re all gazing at the moon, or gazing at these people who are gazing at the moon, when we shouldn\\u2019t be so distracted. It\\u2019s like James Baldwin said: Entertainment is a narcotic. I feel like the entertainment business is like getting your vaccination. Some of it is really good for you; too much of it going to kill you.\", \"5. WTF With Marc Maron I wanted to be on for years and years, and he never invited me. My poor little ego got slapped about because I thought he was so wonderful. [But eventually] I had the enormous honor of having him encounter me. We spoke about really painful, tough things, and he was a lovely, grumpy teddy bear.\", \"6. Contemporary Dance I was a dancer, and I did a TEDGlobal talk called \\u201cEmbracing Otherness.\\u201d [I said that] I grew up on the coast of England in the \\u201970s. My dad is white from Cornwall, and my mom is Black from Zimbabwe. From about the age of 5, I was aware that I didn\\u2019t fit. My skin color wasn\\u2019t right. My hair wasn\\u2019t right. My history wasn\\u2019t right. My self became defined by otherness. [But when I was dancing] I\\u2019d literally lose myself. And I was a really good dancer. I would put all my emotional expression into my dancing. I could be in the movement in a way that I wasn\\u2019t able to be in my life, in myself.\", \"7. V-Day I love the podcast \\u201cIntersectionality Matters!\\u201d with Kimberl\\u00e9 Crenshaw, who is one of the creators of critical race theory. She\\u2019s also a dear friend and was a fellow board member of the organization V-Day \\u2014 brainchild of Eve Ensler, its goal is to end violence against women and girls worldwide \\u2014 where we met a decade ago. She\\u2019s devoted literally her life and her relationships to law and to human rights, and to empowering women of color and attempting to ensure their protection and justice for the crimes against them. I\\u2019m collaborating with Kimberl\\u00e9 and the African American Policy Forum on a project dealing with police brutality against women of color. Kimberl\\u00e9 coined the hashtag #SayHerName, which was inspiration for the song by Janelle Mon\\u00e1e, Beyonc\\u00e9, Alicia Keys and others.\", \"8. James Baldwin James Baldwin is to be read by everyone, everything, all of it. Just the genius of him \\u2014 his sexuality, how he thought about religion, race. My husband spent years trying to find, because it\\u2019s out of print, \\u201cA Rap on Race\\u201d by Margaret Mead and James Baldwin. I should put every page on Instagram, just to share with people.\", \"9. Margaret Mead Margaret Mead to me is like a rock star. Like super cool. I\\u2019m an anthropologist [who studied at Cambridge] and an archaeologist by trade. And I do see the bigger picture, unfortunately and fortunately. I see what humanity is doing, and the fact that this is all in the last tiny blip of time, and we\\u2019re [expletive] it up so severely.\", \"10. The Freedom From Torture Charity The only professional play that I\\u2019ve had the honor to be part of was \\u201cDeath and the Maiden,\\u201d which is by Ariel Dorfman. I did it at the Comedy Theater in London\\u2019s West End. The character I played, Paulina, was a torture survivor, and the director set up time at the charity Freedom From Torture so that we could talk to survivors. I spoke to a Congolese woman and a man from Chad, and it changed my life. I\\u2019ve been part of Freedom From Torture \\u2014 ambassador, fund-raiser \\u2014 ever since. I think it\\u2019s of incredible importance to have a sense of what people go through in the war between nations, the war within a nation, the jockeying for power and the cheapness of human life that is illustrated in the way that we control minds and bodies through torture as a way of manipulating people. It\\u2019s unspeakable.\"]","href_hash":"2422a7a741cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2422a7a741cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
