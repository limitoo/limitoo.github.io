Iranian-born United States citizen who was found in his underwear hiding in the bedroom of a suburban Adelaide drug house is sentenced to at least five-and-a-half years in jail over an $18 million meth bust in 2018.","country":"au","create_time":"2021-11-07T20:28:38.000Z","content":"[\"A\\u00a0United States citizen who was brought to Australia specifically to help manufacture more than $18 million worth of methamphetamine in a suburban Adelaide lab has been jailed for more than nine years.\", \"Shahram Kamali, 43, pleaded guilty to manufacturing a large commercial quantity of a controlled drug.\", \"Police found a large-scale meth lab and about 37 kilograms of methamphetamine, along with more than 15 kilograms of other material, at a Morphett Vale property in October 2018.\", \"Judge Jane Schammer said the amount seized would have equated to more than 360,000 individual street deals with a value of more than $18 million.\", \"Kamali was found hiding in a bedroom at the back of the property wearing only his underwear, and was then arrested.\", \"Judge Schammer said Kamali was \\\"specifically brought from America\\\" for his hands-on role in the drug\\u00a0operation.\", \"She rejected his claim that he only put water in some buckets, as there was evidence he had been living at the property and his fingerprints were found on many manufacturing items.\", \"Those items were found in nearly every room of the premises, and included\\u00a0pots and buckets containing methamphetamine in various stages of production.\", \"Judge Schammer described it as a simple but highly sophisticated methamphetamine lab that had no odour, which made it\\u00a0harder to detect.\", \"She said the offending only came to light when police intercepted a phone call.\", \"Kamali had flown to Sydney from the United States in September 2018, with his passenger card stating he intended to stay at a property in Sydney for 14 days.\", \"Two days later he travelled to Adelaide.\", \"The District Court heard Kamali claimed he was asked by an Iranian friend to travel to Australia to inspect granite and assist him with an ongoing construction business.\", \"That Iranian friend had loaned Kamali money to pay for his father's funeral, and Kamali planned to use the\\u00a0$10,000 to $15,000 he expected to earn\\u00a0to repay his friend.\", \"<img

on\\u00a0Marston Drive.(ABC News: Tom Fedorowytsch)</div>\", \"Judge Schammer said Kamali \\u2014 who had a history of ice addiction \\u2014 must have known the nature of the enterprise he was participating in, and that it was the large-scale manufacturing\\u00a0of methamphetamine.\", \"\\\"You had a degree of familiarity [with the drug],\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"You were used for this role and specifically brought from America for this role.\", \"\\\"The fact you were selected for this task shows that the level of trust placed on you by others further up in the chain was greater than that placed in the co-accused.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Lengthy jail time the 'only appropriate penalty'</div>\", \"At the time of the drug bust, police\\u00a0described the meth lab as \\\"one of the largest\\\" ever found in South Australia.\", \"Judge Schammer accepted Kamali was low in the hierarchy of the drug enterprise.\", \"She sentenced Kamali to nine years and six months in prison with a non-parole period of five years and six months.\", \"\\\"Methamphetamine is a terrible drug which causes misery to those who are addicted to it, their families and to the wider community.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/1629c772635dbe2a4e37b88f505ad295\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Police raided the

age of 16 to peddle cigarettes on the streets \\u2014 was motivated by financial reward.\", \"\\\"I accept you are sorry and remorseful for the offending,\\\" Judge Schammer said.\", \"\\\"You are ashamed at your inability to continue to work and send money home to your family.\\\"\", \"In 2008, Kamali fled Iran to seek asylum in the United Kingdom after threats were made on his life.\", \"That asylum application was rejected and he briefly returned to Iran, before being smuggled out of the country to the United States where he spent 11 months in immigration detention.\", \"He had his asylum application accepted and he became a US citizen in 2016.\", \"Judge Schammer said Kamali is unlikely to pose any further risk to the Australian public as he is likely to be deported to the United States upon his release from custody.\", \"Co-accused Houshang Naroie and Misagh Habibi have already been sentenced to more than eight years in jail for their role in this offending.\"]","href_hash":"4e309fb2404c11ecae054fadf5d1b332"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4e309fb2404c11ecae054fadf5d1b332"}},
