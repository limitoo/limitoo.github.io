The event resulted in 10 people dying and hundreds of others injured when a crowd surge occurred, crushing and trampling many people.\", \"The lawsuits, similar to the others, blame Scott and the companies for failing to have basic safety precautions, The Associated Press reported.\", \"\\\"Defendants egregiously failed in their duty to protect the health, safety, and lives of those in attendance at the concert, including but not limited to the failure to provide adequate security personnel to implement crowd control measures, proper barricades, and the failure to provide a sufficient amount of emergency medical support,\\\" the suits said.\", \"Around 50,000 people attended the sold-out concert, according to AP. People started to push toward the front even before Scott took the stage.\", \"\\\"You became an organism,\\\" Steven Gutierrez, 26, from Ellenville, New York, said. \\\"We're all one. You're moving with the crowd. The crowd's like water. It's like an ocean.\\\"\", \"Despite Gutierrez being 391 pounds and over 6 feet tall, he was unable to stop himself from being pushed among the crowd.\", \"Ezra Blount, a 9-year-old who attended the concert with his father Treston Blount, was the latest victim to die after being trampled, according to ABC13. After being on life support for days, he died on Sunday, Nov. 17.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1940043/astroworld-lawsuits-travis-scott-live-nation.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Two people who knew an unidentified victim of a fatal incident at the Houston Astroworld concert embrace at a memorial on Sunday, Nov. 7, 2021. The family of two close friends from suburban Chicago who were killed at the Astroworld concert in Houston this month have filed wrongful death lawsuits against rapper Travis Scott, the Live Nation entertainment company and others. </div>\", \"Patino and Jurinek were both college students, Patino at the University of Dayton in Ohio and Jurinek at Southern Illinois University-Carbondale. They had been football teammates at Neuqua Valley High School in Naperville.\", \"Like the loved ones of the other victims, a partner in the Chicago law firm Corboy & Demetrio, which filed the lawsuits this week in Harris County Courts in Houston, said the families are trying to make sense of something that makes no sense.\", \"\\\"A healthy, strong 20- or 21-year-old child goes off to a concert thinking he's going to have some fun, and they're going to be celebrating, in this case, Jake's 21st birthday,\\\" Corboy said, according to the Naperville Sun. \\\"Nobody expects to go to something as happy and joyous as concert where they end up dying. Nobody anticipates when they pay these high prices for these concert tickets that they have to worry about things like that.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1940045/astroworld-ezra-blount-travis-scott-lawsuits.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Astroworld concert incident has resulted in the deaths of 10 people, the lastest being Ezra Blount, a 9-year-old boy who was trampled.
