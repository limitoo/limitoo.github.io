But his testimony at times lent support to Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s central claim, that he was acting in self-defense when he shot Mr. Grosskreutz and two other men. The testimony underscored a broader challenge for prosecutors, who face the burden of disproving the scenario laid out by Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s lawyers.\", \"Those lawyers have argued that Mr. Rittenhouse fired in self-defense during a chaotic, lawless night in Kenosha on the third night of protests and rioting after the police shooting of Jacob Blake on Aug. 23, 2020. The first man Mr. Rittenhouse shot, Joseph Rosenbaum, was erratic and threatening to people on the street that night, the defense has said, and in the split second before Mr. Rittenhouse shot him, Mr. Rosenbaum lunged in his direction and reached for his weapon. After Mr. Rittenhouse shot him four times and fled down the street, he shot two others who were pursuing him, Anthony Huber and Mr. Grosskreutz.\", \"\\u201cI thought that the defendant was an active shooter,\\u201d said Mr. Grosskreutz, who also testified that he came to the protests to provide medical help to people who needed it.\", \"Under cross-examination by a lawyer for Mr. Rittenhouse, Mr. Grosskreutz gave testimony that suggested his role in the events of Aug. 25, 2020, was complicated. Like Mr. Rittenhouse, Mr. Grosskreutz was armed that night, and he was asked why he had falsely told police detectives shortly after the shooting that his Glock pistol had fallen out of its holster that night \\u2014 rather than saying he had pulled it out, as visual evidence showed. Under questioning, he also acknowledged that he was carrying the gun concealed without a valid permit to do so and that he had denied a request from the police in September 2020 to interview him about the shootings.\", \"As Mr. Grosskreutz described the seconds before Mr. Rittenhouse shot him, he was shown photos that captured him pointing his gun at Mr. Rittenhouse.\", \"\\u201cSo when you were standing three to five feet from him with your arms up in the air, he never fired, right?\\u201d Corey Chirafisi, a defense lawyer, asked.\", \"\\u201cCorrect,\\u201d Mr. Grosskreutz answered.\", \"\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t until you pointed your gun at him, advanced on him with your gun \\u2014 now your hands down, pointed at him \\u2014 that he fired, right?\\u201d Mr. Chirafisi said.\", \"\\u201cCorrect,\\u201d he said.\", \"Through five days of testimony, several witnesses who have been called by the prosecution have offered accounts that were complex, rather than plainly favorable to the state\\u2019s case against Mr. Rittenhouse. Some witnesses have given testimony that was ambiguous \\u2014 helpful to the prosecution at some moments and helpful to the defense at others.\", \"One witness, Richie McGinniss, a videographer for The Daily Caller, a conservative news and opinion site, who was standing near Mr. Rittenhouse at the time of the first shooting, told the jury his life was at risk by the shots Mr. Rittenhouse fired. The testimony offered support to a count of reckless endangerment that is among six charges, including first-degree intentional homicide, in the prosecution\\u2019s criminal complaint.\", \"Mr. McGinniss gave searing and emotional testimony of the trauma and personal danger that he endured, telling the jury that he stepped out of the line of fire just before Mr. Rittenhouse shot Mr. Rosenbaum, 36, and had to stamp his own legs on the ground afterward to make sure he had not been hit by a bullet.\", \"Mr. McGinniss recalled on the stand how he had tried to save Mr. Rosenbaum\\u2019s life, applying pressure to his wounds and loading him into a vehicle to take him to a hospital. When the two were in the back of the S.U.V. together, as Mr. Rosenbaum was dying, Mr. McGinniss tried to reassure him, he testified.\", \"\\u201cI was just telling him that we\\u2019re going to have a beer together afterwards, and it was all going to be OK,\\u201d Mr. McGinniss, visibly shaken at the memory, told the courtroom.\", \"But Mr. McGinniss also offered what could be the defense\\u2019s most crucial witness testimony: that he saw Mr. Rosenbaum chase Mr. Rittenhouse into a parking lot, lunge at him and reach for the barrel of his rifle.\", \"\\u201cHe threw his momentum toward the weapon,\\u201d Mr. McGinnis said in court.\", \"Another prosecution witness, Kariann Swart, testified last week that she was the fianc\\u00e9e of Mr. Rosenbaum and perhaps the last person close to him to see him alive, giving an account of their relationship to the jury and describing her anguish at hearing that he had been killed.\", \"On the morning after he was fatally shot, she said, she went to the parking lot and saw the mark on the pavement where he had been slain.\", \"\\u201cI put my hand in it, and my hand was wet with his blood,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI collapsed on the ground.\\u201d\", \"But Ms. Swart also gave testimony that concurred with an assertion by the defense that Mr. Rosenbaum was behaving strangely in the hours before he was killed.\", \"She said that on the day of the shooting, Mr. Rosenbaum was released from a hospital and that he was taking medications for bipolar disorder and depression. When Mr. Rosenbaum visited her at the motel where she was staying, Ms. Swart said, she had specifically told him not to go to downtown Kenosha, where the unrest had been occurring for several nights in a row. He went anyway, carrying a small plastic bag of items from the hospital, she said.\", \"Jason Lackowski, another prosecution witness and one of the armed men who was in Kenosha that night with the goal of protecting property, told the court last week that Mr. Rosenbaum was \\u201ca babbling idiot,\\u201d downplaying the threat that Mr. Rosenbaum might have posed to Mr. Rittenhouse.\", \"But he also testified that in the minutes after the shootings, he found Mr. Grosskreutz\\u2019s pistol lying on the street and emptied its chamber.\"]","href_hash":"e306cae8410611ec97c95fe9a96736a6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e306cae8410611ec97c95fe9a96736a6"}},
