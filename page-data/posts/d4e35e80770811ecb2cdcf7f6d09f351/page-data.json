but data shows the pace that people are getting vaccinated has slowed.\", \"About 91.55 per cent of that cohort have received at least one dose of vaccine, while 88.7 per cent are fully vaccinated.\", \"Queensland's Deputy Premier Steven Miles said all that was needed to achieve that goal was \\\"for all of those people who have had their first dose to get the second dose\\\".\", \"Mr Miles said there was an expectation that would happen \\\"now that people are getting back into the swing of things\\\"\\u00a0after the festive season.\", \"\\\"I suspect some people whose three or four week mark fell over the Christmas New Year holiday period, they might have been away [or] they might not have wanted to get their second dose at that time,\\\" he said.\", \"According to infectious disease specialist Dr Paul Griffin, trends elsewhere have shown\\u00a0vaccination rates \\\"slow towards the end,\\\" given people who have resisted getting\\u00a0vaccinated and \\\"have resisted all the

already been seen in the number of hospitalisations in Queensland.\", \"He said unvaccinated people were an \\\"over-represented\\\" cohort of the people in hospital, and that there were parts of the population that \\\"don't understand the benefits\\\" of being vaccinated.\", \"\\\"I'm seeing these people every day,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Particularly large groups of pregnant women, for example, who are needing to be admitted to hospital because they didn't get vaccinated and now they're getting the infection and getting some of the most significant manifestations.\\\"\", \"<div

South Wales and Victoria both have 94 per cent of their over-16 population double dosed, while the ACT has a rate of 98.8 per cent.\", \"Dr Griffin said\\u00a0the TGA's looming\\u00a0decision about whether the protein vaccine Novavax would be available in Australia\\u00a0could soon also have a positive effect on the rate.\", \"\\\"That will give an option to some people that have been reluctant
