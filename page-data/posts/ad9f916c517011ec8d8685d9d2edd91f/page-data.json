I mean, the virus keeps surprising us.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Within 36 hours of discovering the new variant, these scientists alerted the world. Some countries, including the U.S., are now banning travel from several countries in southern Africa in an attempt to prevent the spread.\\u00a0\", \"Sigal's team is collaborating with other scientists to find out if the variant is more transmissible or evades immunity. The lab has received multiple requests for samples of Omicron, which are being packed and shipped off to other research institutes around the country.\\u00a0\", \"Scientists will know in about 10 days whether existing vaccines can stop Omicron, but Sigal is confident the current vaccines will still provide protection against severe illness and hospitalization.\\u00a0\", \"But Sigal warned that as long as Africa lags behind in vaccinations, the virus will continue to mutate. Omicron has mainly infected young people in Africa, and South African doctors say those infected have mild symptoms for the most part.\\u00a0\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"ad9f916c517011ec8d8685d9d2edd91f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ad9f916c517011ec8d8685d9d2edd91f"}},
