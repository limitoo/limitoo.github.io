Besides Ukraine, it focuses on central and Eastern Europe, former Soviet republics, the Balkan countries and Turkey.\", \"\\\"The magnitude of the humanitarian crisis unleashed by the war is staggering,\\\" said Anna Bjerde, the World Bank's vice president for the Europe and Central Asia region. \\\"The Russian invasion is delivering a massive blow to Ukraine's economy and it has inflicted enormous damage to infrastructure.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"The report said economic activity is impossible in \\\"large swaths of areas\\\" in Ukraine because infrastructure like roads, bridges, ports and train tracks have been destroyed.\", \"Ukraine plays a major role as a\\u00a0global supplier of agricultural exports like wheat\\u00a0but that's now in question because\\u00a0planting and harvesting have been disrupted\\u00a0by the war, the report said. The war has cut off access to the Black Sea, a key route for exports, including 90% of Ukraine's grain shipments, it said.\", \"\\\"The war is having a devastating impact on human life and causing economic destruction in both countries, and will lead to significant economic losses in the Europe and Central Asia region and the rest of the world,\\\" the report said.\", \"Belarus, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova and Tajikistan also are forecast to slide into recession this year, while economic growth projections have been cut for the region's other economies because of the war's ripple effects.\", \"The World Bank said the humanitarian catastrophe is the biggest initial shockwave from the war and will likely be its most enduring legacy, as the wave of refugees fleeing Ukraine is \\\"anticipated to dwarf previous crises.\\\"\", \"More than\\u00a04 million people have fled Ukraine, with\\u00a0more than half going to Poland\\u00a0and others heading to countries like Moldova, Romania and Hungary. An additional 6.5 million have been displaced internally. Those numbers are expected to swell as the war drags on, the World Bank said.\", \"The report issued a stark warning that \\\"the war will increase poverty in the region due to the recession and food price inflation.\\\"\", \"Beyond the humanitarian crisis, the lender said \\\"the war is also delivering a sizable blow to the global economy through multiple channels.\\\"\", \"The war and sanctions have\\u00a0scrambled global trade routes\\u00a0and pushed up shipping and insurance costs, \\\"which magnifies strains on global value chains,\\\" the report said, noting that industries getting hit include food, automobiles, construction, petrochemicals and transport.\"]","href_hash":"b5d04d1ab9d311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b5d04d1ab9d311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
