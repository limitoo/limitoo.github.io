The NDAA has become law every year for six decades.\", \"Authorising about 5 percent more military spending than last year, the fiscal 2022 NDAA is a compromise after intense negotiations between House and Senate Democrats and Republicans after being stalled by disputes over China and Russia policy.\", \"It includes a 2.7 percent pay increase for the troops, and more aircraft and Navy ship purchases, in addition to strategies for dealing with geopolitical threats, especially Russia and China.\", \"The NDAA includes $300 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which provides support to Ukraine's armed forces, $4b for the European Defense Initiative and $150m for Baltic security cooperation.\", \"In relation to China, the bill includes $7.1b for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative and a statement of congressional support for the defence of Taiwan, as well as a ban on the Department of Defense procuring products produced with forced labour from China's Xinjiang region.\", \"It creates a 16-member commission to study the war in Afghanistan.
