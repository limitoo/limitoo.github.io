Some Republican governors have argued that Mr. Biden does not have the authority to impose these mandates, which are estimated to cover more than 100 million workers.\", \"And federal judges in Georgia, Louisiana and Missouri \\u2014 all appointed by Republicans \\u2014 have agreed in part, creating a roadblock for the administration\\u2019s push to vaccinate all Americans. Before the court orders, local and private mandates had helped boost vaccination rates. \", \"Here\\u2019s where the court cases stand: \", \"A federal judge in Southern Georgia on Tuesday blocked the vaccine mandate for employees of federal contractors. \", \"U.S. District Court Judge for the Southern District of Georgia R. Stanley Baker \\u2014 appointed by President Donald J. Trump \\u2014 issued a preliminary nationwide injunction saying that he is \\u201cunconvinced\\u201d that the administration has the authority to impose the vaccine rules for contractors. The judge also argued that the mandate would \\u201chave a major impact on the economy at large.\\u201d \", \"The order was in response to a lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of Georgia, Alabama, Idaho, Kansas, South Carolina, Utah and West Virginia.\", \"A Trump-appointed federal judge in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana issued a nationwide preliminary injunction last week to halt the start of Mr. Biden\\u2019s national vaccine mandate for health care workers.\", \"The injunction, written by Judge Terry A. Doughty appointed by Mr. Trump, effectively expanded a separate order issued by a federal court in Missouri by another Trump-appointed judge, Matthew Thomas Schelp. The earlier order had applied only to 10 states.\", \" Congress should make the mandate, not a government agency, Judge Doughty wrote. \", \"The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services appealed both rulings. \", \"Employers and governors in mostly Republican states have opposed Mr. Biden\\u2019s mandate that employees of large companies must be vaccinated or get tested weekly, arguing that it was overreach with various lawsuits. \", \"A panel of three Republican appointed judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans has blocked the mandate nationwide multiple times, declaring that the rule \\u201cgrossly exceeds\\u201d the authority of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\", \"In a filing asking the Fifth Circuit to withdraw its stay, the Justice Department argued that requiring large employers to force their workers to get vaccinated was within their administrative reach. \", \"The ruling by the panel of the Fifth Circuit is unlikely to be the final word. Some challenges to the mandate are in other circuits, and the Supreme Court is expected to eventually decide the matter.\"]","href_hash":"94947f64580c11ecbceed761c9a788a1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"94947f64580c11ecbceed761c9a788a1"}},
