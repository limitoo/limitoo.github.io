We regularly work with our law enforcement partners to determine the credibility of any threats. As always, we would like to remind members of the public that if they observe anything suspicious to report it to law enforcement immediately.\\\"\", \"The Michigan State Police, among law enforcement agencies responding to the posts, said in a statement Thursday it was unaware of any credible threats.\", \"CBS Los Angeles reports that the L.A. Unified School District, the nation's second-largest, said it's safe to send kids to school Friday but it takes all threats very seriously.
