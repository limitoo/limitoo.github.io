Jack Howell of the Covington Police Department told The Associated Press that a white Mercedes-Benz connected to Young Dolph's shooting was found to be used in another shooting on Nov. 12 in Covington, a city located 40 miles north of Memphis.\", \"Two people exited the Mercedes at an intersection, firing around 40 rounds from high-powered rifles into a car they had followed out of a high school football game at night, Howell said.\", \"Two women were shot, with one dead and the other still in hospital care, said Howell.\", \"Days after, Young Dolph was buying cookies at a Memphis bakery when two men in the same Mercedes got out of the vehicle and shot into the establishment, killing the rapper, according to the Memphis police. Information on the suspects has yet to be released and no arrests have been made despite police releasing photos captured from surveillance footage.\", \"Covington police are searching alongside Memphis police and the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation for the suspects, thought to be from the Memphis area, Howell said.\", \"The Mercedes was found on Sunday in a Memphis neighborhood, with evidence connecting the vehicle to both shootings, Howell said.\", \"Young Dolph, 36, also known as Adolph Johnston Jr., was in Memphis, his hometown, for a series of Thanksgiving turkey giveaways and to visit a cancer center.
