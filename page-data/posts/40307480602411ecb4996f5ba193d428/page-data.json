When it's time to give birth, sea lion mums can choose spots near popular beaches, like we saw last year near St Kilda Beach. To make sure they get the space they need with their new pup, temporary restrictions for dogs may be put in place at some beaches,\\\" Hanlin said.\", \"\\\"We'll be keeping an eye on the sea lion mums and where they settle with their pups. Some beaches or areas where people can usually walk their dogs off lead may change to on lead only temporarily to help keep both the sea lions and dogs safe. We'll put signs out if this is needed.\", \"\\\"Sea lions can be difficult to spot and generally aren't afraid of people. As they'll have new pups, it's important to give them a wide berth and keep dogs away. If you come across wildlife, including sea lions, put your dog on a lead and stay 20m away.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"40307480602411ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"40307480602411ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
