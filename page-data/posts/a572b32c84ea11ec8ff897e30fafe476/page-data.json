The lead singer-songwriter of the British punk band X-Ray Spex and the first woman of color in Britain to front a successful rock band, she looks and sounds impossibly, wonderfully young. She has a mouth full of braces, soft eyes and an open smile. The name appealed because it suggested a kind of plastic, she said. Yet there was little synthetic about the rebellious performer with the startling voice. Nor are there any false notes in \\u201cPoly Styrene: I Am a Clich\\u00e9,\\u201d a documentary directed by her daughter, Celeste Bell, and Paul Sng.\", \"Five years after her mother\\u2019s death in 2011, Bell, though emotional, was able to face a cache of photos, flyers, diaries, poems and lyrics. More than a journeyman rockumentary, \\u201cPoly Styrene\\u201d is a thoughtfully finessed filial reckoning: a daughter\\u2019s journey toward understanding her mother as a young artist and as a young woman of color. Styrene\\u2019s mother, a legal secretary who was white, met Styrene\\u2019s father, a dapper Somali dock worker, at a club. She and her sister grew up in a Brixton estate.\", \"Bell provides the film\\u2019s contemplative narration. The actress Ruth Negga (\\u201cPassing\\u201d) reads Styrene\\u2019s diaries and poems, as well as interview transcripts. Recollections from her X-Ray Spex bandmate Paul Dean and other musicians, including Sonic Youth\\u2019s Thurston Moore, give a sense of time, place and, occasionally, bad-lad culture. But it\\u2019s the female rockers who pay resonant tribute: the X-Ray Spex saxophonist Lora Logic; Kathleen Hanna; and Neneh Cherry, who credits Styrene for her sense that a woman of color has a place in rock and punk.\"]","href_hash":"a572b32c84ea11ec8ff897e30fafe476"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a572b32c84ea11ec8ff897e30fafe476"}},
