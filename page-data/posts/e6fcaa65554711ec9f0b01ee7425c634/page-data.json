It is uncertain whether any of those cases involved the Omicron variant.\", \"The man said that his friends \\u2014 a group of about 30 people \\u2014 had come from all over the country for the event, which ran Nov. 19-21. About half of them also later tested positive for the virus, he told the officials. \", \"The man, officials said, was fully vaccinated and had gotten a booster just weeks before the convention. He has recovered from mild symptoms that began shortly after the convention ended, and has provided names and contact information of several in his group to health officials. Since the friends live in other states, their names were forwarded to those states\\u2019 health departments. Details of their cases are not known. \", \"The Minnesota man\\u2019s case was among the first reports of Omicron in the United States, and it presented a worrisome possibility for health officials: Might the anime convention, which drew tens of thousands of people to the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center for three days, have been a vector for spreading the new variant, which scientists fear may be able to spread more quickly than any other variant? \", \"After learning that the man had attended a large convention in New York, Kathy Como-Sabetti, manager of the Covid epidemiology section for the Minnesota Department of Public Health, said: \\u201cI kind of went, \\u2018Wow, well, this changes our story.\\u2019 This changes the picture of what we\\u2019re dealing with.\\u201d \", \"At the Anime NYC conference, focused around a popular animation style that originated in Japan, attendees were fairly compliant about wearing masks, the man told officials. But some rooms were very crowded, at capacity, with crowds standing shoulder to shoulder, he said. \", \"Convention attendees were required to provide proof that they had received at least one vaccine shot and they had to wear masks, according to the convention website. The rules allowed entry \\u201cimmediately after\\u201d a first dose. People are seen as having full vaccination protection two weeks after a second dose of a two-dose vaccine. \", \"\\u201cTime will tell how large it becomes,\\u201d Ms. Como-Sabetti said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to say that it is a super spreader. Certainly we\\u2019re concerned about that.\\u201d\", \"Officials cautioned that much remains unknown: The man and his friends could have been infected in other venues \\u2014 at restaurants, hotels or other locations during their trips, or at another time. \", \"Still, the prospect of a cluster of cases raised new questions about the nation\\u2019s virus detection capabilities and the limits of its contact-tracing efforts, which have been disparate and limited since the start of the pandemic. \", \"Michael Osterholm, the director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said that he was concerned about the contact-tracing ability of health departments across the country, given their strained resources and the public\\u2019s general lack of cooperation with investigators. Also worrisome, he said, is the small number of cases that are being tested for the Omicron variant.\", \"\\u201cVery quickly we\\u2019re going to see a number of Omicron cases around the country in many locations, just as we\\u2019ve seen in Minnesota,\\u201d he said.\", \"After Minnesota officials learned that the convention attendee had the Omicron variant, they informed the New York City Health Department. City health officials said that they had begun sending text messages and emails to tens of thousands of the anime convention\\u2019s attendees, urging them to get tested. \", \"Dr. Ted Long, who oversees the city\\u2019s contact tracing program, said that he was aware of five positive cases so far among New York City residents who attended the anime convention. But he said it was not yet known if those people had been infected by Omicron or Delta, nor was the convention known to be the site where they had gotten sick. \", \"\\u201cWe haven\\u2019t found evidence of widespread transmission at the convention,\\u201d Adam Shrier, a spokesman for New York City\\u2019s contact tracing program, Test and Trace Corps, wrote in an email. \", \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is assisting the Minnesota and New York City health departments in tracking any cases, a spokeswoman said, but details were still being worked out on Saturday morning. C.D.C. disease investigators held a conference call on Saturday morning with officials from local health departments.\", \"Infectious disease specialists said that the first Omicron case to be linked to the anime convention was likely identified in Minnesota because that state\\u2019s health department has a robust genomic sequencing system, and not necessarily because the patient was the original index case.\", \"Organizers of the convention stressed that it was uncertain where the man had contracted the virus. \", \"\\u201cHe was just one person who was at our event,\\u201d said Kelly Comboni, president of LeftField Media, which organized the convention. \\u201cThere have been no other mass cases reported from our event, and we are now way past two weeks\\u201d since the convention\\u2019s end.\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\", \"\"]","href_hash":"e6fcaa65554711ec9f0b01ee7425c634"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e6fcaa65554711ec9f0b01ee7425c634"}},
