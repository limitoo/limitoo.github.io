Lindemann, a regional cadre of the Free Democrats, on Twitter.\", \"The parties in the new coalition have agreed to legalize the sale of cannabis \\u2014 as long as it is sold in licensed establishments that can tax it properly and ensure both quality control and that it is sold only to adults. After four years, the parties vow to re-evaluate the law and its effect on society.\", \"If Germany does legalize recreational marijuana, it will become the first major European country to do so, after Canada and certain U.S. states, opening a significant market for legal cannabis growers and dealers.

A study released last month found that only 30 percent of respondents thought the drug should be legalized for recreational use. Another 59 percent believed it was better left the way it has been since 2011: a medicinal product that requires a doctor\\u2019s prescription.\", \"And while the Greens campaigned on clear rules for cannabis use and the Free Democrats have argued legalization could bring money into state coffers, the outgoing conservative government insists legalization is dangerous.\", \"\\u201cCannabis legalization would be a breach of the dam,\\u201d Stephan Pilsinger, the conservative parliamentary faction expert on drugs, said in October. \\u201cAt some point, unfortunately, we\\u2019ll be talking about legalizing all drugs.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b8c12d874d5011ecb01b1392f0d36123"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b8c12d874d5011ecb01b1392f0d36123"}},
