The police gave him all of their notes relating to their 1977 inquiry and asked for his view on them, so he knew - perhaps better than anybody - what was going on at Lake Alice.''\", \"Sutherland said the college had indicated it was willing to discuss an apology, but not until the inquiry reported back on Lake Alice next year.\", \"He said this was not good enough and he wanted action before the end of this year.\", \"''We are pleased they will meet and we can sit down and talk through with them how they might frame their apology.\", \"\\\"In terms of the timeline, I am concerned about that. Every day that passes the survivors of Lake Alice are getting older and fewer in number, and so we need to push it along faster than the Royal College seems to be indicating.''\", \"RNZ has approached the RANZCP for comment.\", \"Sutherland said survivors would welcome an apology even at this very late stage.\", \"''Survivors have waited a long time to get any justice for what happened to them when they were children at Lake Alice, so I think the apology will mean something and at any rate it will be one way for the Royal College to atone for their failure to act in the past.''\", \"Sutherland, who was a witness at the Royal Commission into Abuse in Care's Lake Alice inquiry earlier this year, said he had no doubt its findings on the Lake Alice Child and Adolescent Unit would condemn the regime that was in place at Lake Alice under Leeks in the early 1970s.\", \"''They will condemn it and I am sure they will find, as did retired Justice Rodney Gallen (in 2001), that it was outrageous in the extreme.''\"]","href_hash":"4a40f8c6482711ec8068d5a343c8d4a8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4a40f8c6482711ec8068d5a343c8d4a8"}},
