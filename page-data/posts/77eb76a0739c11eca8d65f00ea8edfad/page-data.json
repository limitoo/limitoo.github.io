That's what happened to a woman in China whose video blogs about going into a citywide lockdown during a blind date have gone viral.\", \" Over 100 virus cases have been reported in the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou since last week, as China battles to contain multiple local outbreaks of the Delta and Omicron variants of the coronavirus.\", \" Parts of the city were abruptly placed under lockdown last Wednesday when a woman surnamed Wang was having dinner at her blind date's house.\", \" \\\"Just after I arrived in Zhengzhou, there was an outbreak and his community was put under lockdown and I could not leave,\\\" Wang told Shanghai-based outlet The Paper on Tuesday, adding that she went there for a week-long trip to meet potential suitors. \\\"I'm getting old now, my family introduced me to ten matches...
