A video published by Belarusian media showed people trying to enter Poland using uprooted trees and various thrown objects. However, the Associated Press reported that there is \\\"no way to independently verify\\\" the events in the video due to Belarus's barring of journalists.\", \"Despite the lack of clarity surrounding the video, Poland is taking extra precautions against its eastern neighbor. The country is accusing Belarus of encouraging Middle Eastern migrants to cross the borders of its neighboring countries, particularly Poland. Lithuania and Latvia have also experienced similar migrant surges.\", \"The Associated Press received a statement from Belarus State Border Guard Committee spokesman Anton Bychkovsky. It stated that the migrants are attempting to \\\"exercise their right to apply for refugee status in the EU,\\\" further explaining that they \\\"are not a security threat.\\\"\", \"However, other officials seem to disagree. A spokesman for German Chancellor Angela Merkel recently spoke to reporters and accused Belarus of \\\"acting as a human trafficker.\\\"\", \"\\\"It instrumentalizes refugees and migrants in a way that's politically and from a humanitarian point of view condemnable,\\\" said spokesman Steffen Seibert, \\\"and Europe will make a united stand against this continuous hybrid attack.\\\"\", \"Belarus denies any wrongdoing in these recent incidents.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928160/polish-border-authorities.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A picture taken on November 8 shows Poland's law enforcement officers watching migrants at the Belarusian-Polish border.
