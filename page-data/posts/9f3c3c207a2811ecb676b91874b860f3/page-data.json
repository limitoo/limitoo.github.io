The year was 1970, she was an out-of-work teacher on the South Side of Chicago, and she was spending her days counseling women in need.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think we were crazy,\\u201d said Arcana, now 78. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think we were stupid. I think that we had found something that was so important, so useful in the lives of women and girls.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe were radicalized in the arena of women\\u2019s bodies,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe knew that what we were doing was good work in the world. And we knew that it was illegal.\\u201d\", \"Arcana was part of the Jane Collective, a disparate, rotating group of women who ensured safe abortions for thousands of women in Chicago between 1968 and 1973. Despite the law, women were still getting abortions. But they were often performing them on themselves and winding up in the hospital, or paying the mob with no guarantee of survival.\", \"During these years, because of Arcana and other women, if you lived in Chicago and needed help, you could call a number and talk with a woman who would offer a safer alternative. Members of the collective provided counseling and arranged the procedures, which they eventually administered \\u2014 11,000 all told during that period. But then in 1972, Arcana and six other members of the group were arrested, each charged with 11 counts of abortion or conspiracy to commit an abortion with a possible 10-year sentence for each charge. Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision issued in 1973, saved them all.\", \"Now, close to 50 years later, members of the collective are sharing their stories in a pair of movies at the Sundance Film Festival, which begins Thursday: the HBO documentary \\u201cThe Janes\\u201d; and a fictionalized account titled \\u201cCall Jane,\\u201d starring Elizabeth Banks and Sigourney Weaver, and looking for distribution.\", \"The movies are debuting at a particularly crucial time for abortion rights. The Supreme Court heard arguments in December over the legality of a Mississippi law that bans abortion after 15 weeks; it is expected to issue a decision this summer. Should the court uphold the law, the ruling would be at odds with Roe v. Wade, which declared abortion a constitutional right and forbade states from banning the procedure before fetal viability (23 weeks). \", \"The Sundance filmmakers make no secret that they support abortion rights but say they want their work to show the complexity of the subject.\", \"In \\u201cCall Jane,\\u201d Banks plays Joy, a mother and housewife who seeks out an illegal abortion after learning that her pregnancy is life-threatening \\u2014 her attempt to secure one legally having been denied by an all-male hospital board. The movie\\u2019s director, Phyllis Nagy (whose credits include the screenplay for \\u201cCarol\\u201d), said she wished she could show it to the Supreme Court\\u2019s conservative justices. \\u201cI would sit there and say, \\u2018Now, talk to me,\\u2019 and it wouldn\\u2019t make any difference, probably,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut artists need to start having the kinds of political conversations with society that aren\\u2019t didactic,\\u201d she added. \\u201cNothing else has worked.\\u201d\", \"The makers of \\u201cThe Janes\\u201d hope those with differing views will allow themselves a look at life before Roe v. Wade. \\u201cThis is a glimpse at history; I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s an advocacy film,\\u201d said Tia Lessin, who directed with Emma Pildes, whose father used to be married to Arcana. Arcana\\u2019s son, Daniel, is a producer on the film. Lessin added, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a real life story about what happened and the lengths that women went to to have abortions and to enable other women to have abortions.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cDo I hope that people\\u2019s takeaway will be \\u2018let\\u2019s not go back there\\u2019? Sure. But I really hope it moves people to engage in conversation. Love the film, hate the film,\\u201d she said before Pildes jumped in: \\u201cTalk about the issue.\\u201d\", \"And there is plenty to discuss.\", \"The Jane Collective was formed when a college student, Heather Booth, now 76, received a desperate call from a friend looking for an abortion. Booth, active in the civil rights movement, found a doctor willing to help and passed along the information. \\u201cI made what I thought was a one-time arrangement,\\u201d she said in an interview. Soon another woman called. Then another. Booth found herself negotiating fees and learning the intricacies of the procedure so she could counsel women. After a few years, Booth, by then a mother working on her graduate degree at the University of Chicago, recruited others to fulfill the growing need.\", \"\\u201cI was working full time. The number of calls were increasing. It was certainly too much for one person,\\u201d she added.\", \"Marie Leaner, now 80, was raised Roman Catholic and taught to believe that abortion was a sin. At a community center on the West Side of Chicago, she ran a program for teenage mothers. \\u201cI just thought it was atrocious that these women didn\\u2019t want to carry the babies but they felt this was their punishment for being in love or being sexually involved with someone,\\u201d she recalled. \\u201cI decided I wanted to do something about it.\\u201d\", \"She offered up her apartment for the procedures and occasionally held the hands of the women who came through. As one of the few Black women in the group, she said, \\u201cI knew that Black and brown people wouldn\\u2019t partake of the service if they couldn\\u2019t see themselves involved in it.\\u201d\", \"Even all these years later, Arcana can still see the face of a 16-year-old girl who came to her home with her two friends asking Arcana for help. She was already five months pregnant, and Arcana performed the procedure on her living-room floor. She stayed with the girl all day and then drove her home.\", \"\\u201cShe said to me, \\u2018But I want you to stop two blocks away from where I live, and I\\u2019ll get out there,\\u2019\\u201d Arcana recalled. \\u201cShe touched my shoulder and she said, \\u2018Because you know,\\u2019 and I said, \\u2018Yes, I do. Yes, I do.\\u2019 I let her out on that corner, and she went home to her parents. I have no idea what she said to them, but I will always remember that goodbye.\\u201d\", \"The Janes\\u2019s story has been told before \\u2014 in the 1995 book \\u201cThe Story of Jane: The Legendary Underground Feminist Abortion Service,\\u201d by Laura Kaplan; and in two films shown at festivals, \\u201cJane: An Abortion Service,\\u201d a 1995 documentary, and the fictionalized \\u201cAsk for Jane\\u201d (2018) with Arcana as a consulting producer.\", \"Arcana was surprised Sundance chose to screen both new films. To the festival organizers, it seemed like an obvious choice. \\u201cWe felt that the two are kind of in conversation with each other,\\u201d said Kim Yutani, the director of programming, who also selected the French film \\u201cHappening,\\u201d an adaptation of the memoirist Annie Ernaux\\u2019s book recounting her own illegal abortion in France in the 1960s.\", \"The films\\u2019 \\u201cpresence in our program is more an indication of a moment in society than any agenda of the programming team,\\u201d the Sundance director Tabitha Jackson said. \\u201cIf there is a statement to be made, it is the timeless one of \\u2018we follow the artists.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Nagy\\u2019s approach feels more personal. The director wasn\\u2019t interested in anything resembling homework or what she called \\u201can elevated after-school special.\\u201d In her film, Joy spends less time fighting the system and more time fighting her circumstances as a married college graduate whose life has been reduced to the domestic tasks expected of a mother and a wife.\", \"Yet Nagy doesn\\u2019t shy away from the gritty details of abortion. The first 40 minutes of the film are spent on Joy\\u2019s fruitless quest to secure one, and 10 more are dedicated to the procedure itself.\", \"\\u201cI was really way more concerned with getting the medical facts correct,\\u201d said Nagy, who didn\\u2019t meet any of the Janes but did consult with a man who performed abortions back then. (The film\\u2019s screenwriters, Hayley Schore and Roshan Sethi, shared early drafts with Arcana.) \\u201cYou need to spend that time, I think, in order for people to get to know her. But more importantly, to know that this is putting women through the wringer. This is not something you can easily look away from.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9f3c3c207a2811ecb676b91874b860f3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9f3c3c207a2811ecb676b91874b860f3"}},
