It's been a massive challenge. It's been exciting for sure.\\\"\", \"Formula One's managing director for motorsport Ross Brawn, another veteran whose career dates back to the 1970s and who has run teams and also served as a Ferrari technical director, hailed a real break with the past.\", \"He said the aim was \\\"to get a closer competition going on for the future while still leaving it a meritocracy.\", \"\\\"I think there'll be a bit of disparity at the beginning but I'm confident these rules and this regime and this culture will lead to much better racing.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/289163/eight_col_WING.jpg?1647370011\\\" alt=\\\"The front wing of Pierre Gasly's Scuderia AlphaTauri.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nAlphaTauri front wing \\nPhoto: PHOTOSPORT\\n</div>\", \"The most obvious changes are the increase in wheel size from 13 to 18 inches, with low profile Pirelli tyres, and new look front and rear wings designed to reduce the aerodynamic turbulence for cars following behind.\", \"There are fairings on the front wheels and radically different interpretations of the sidepods, which are almost non-existent in the case of champions Mercedes, while the floors generate more ground-effect downforce.\", \"\\\"We may see that we don't quite hit a bullseye in terms of following (cars) but we'll still be so massively ahead of where we were, because the (old) cars were dreadful,\\\" said Brawn.\", \"\\\"We'll still be a long way ahead of where the old cars are and then we'll evolve it.\\\"\", \"The race weekend has also been condensed, with media activities moved to Friday from Thursday and more points for the three Saturday sprints to be held in Imola, Austria and Brazil.\", \"Each team will also have to run young drivers in two Friday practice sessions over the course of the season.\", \"The budget cap, now reduced to $210 million, has introduced another strategic element.\", \"\\\"You have to decide extremely carefully where you invest your dollar in R&D.
