He was 95.\", \"His death was confirmed by his wife, Lorraine Gordon.\", \"Mr. Gordon\\u2019s debut novel, \\u201cThe Rabbi\\u201d (1965), which dealt with the title character\\u2019s marriage to a minister\\u2019s daughter, was lodged for 26 weeks on The New York Times\\u2019s best-selller list. But most of his subsequent eight books fared less successfully when they were published domestically, although they have proliferated since as e-books.\", \"\\u201cWhen I began, my market was America: You either made it in America or didn\\u2019t make it,\\u201d he told The Times in 1996. \\u201cWell, now your market is the world.\\u201d\", \"Michael Gordon, his son and literary agent, said in an email that Mr. Gordon\\u2019s books have sold some 25 million copies in 34 languages.\", \"Mr. Gordon\\u2019s \\u201cThe Physician\\u201d (1986) \\u2014 the first book in a dynastic trilogy that began in 11th-century Persia, continued during the American Civil War with \\u201cShaman\\u201d (1992) and ended with a modern woman doctor dealing with the morality of abortion in \\u201cMatters of Choice\\u201d (1996) \\u2014 had an initial print run of only 10,000 copies in the United States.\", \"But it eventually sold some 10 million copies, including more than six million in Germany, where, in the 1990s, six of Mr. Gordon\\u2019s novels were on best-seller lists simultaneously.\", \"In 2013, \\u201cThe Physician\\u201d was adapted into a German film, in English, starring Tom Payne, Stellan Skarsgard and Ben Kingsley. An award-winning musical based on the book is about to tour Spain.\", \"The novel, based on meticulous research, follows the odyssey of an 11th-century Scottish protagonist, Robert Jeremy Cole, who wants to study medicine in the Middle East, where medical schools were reputed to be more advanced than those in Western Europe. Since Christians were barred from Islamic schools, Cole disguises himself as a Jew.\", \"The book\\u2019s success, even abroad, was a fluke. Just before the publication date, Mr. Gordon\\u2019s editor at Simon & Schuster left and his agent retired. But Karl H. Blessing, who worked for Droemer Knaur, a German publisher, was captivated by the book and invested heavily in promoting it.\", \"\\u201cWhile Gordon has been published in 38 countries, Spain and Germany, where he is most popular, are two countries that grapple with a history of anti-Semitism,\\u201d Andrew Silverstein wrote in The Forward this year. \\u201cWhile not all of Gordon\\u2019s eight books have Jewish themes, most do, and his Jewishness is well known, which may play a role in his popularity in these two countries.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gordon won Spain\\u2019s Silver Basque Prize twice for best-selling book, in 1992 and 1995. His novels were also popular in Italy and Brazil.\", \"His last novel, \\u201cThe Winemaker,\\u201d a story of factions dueling for the Spanish throne at the end of the 19th century, was published in 2012.\", \"Mr. Gordon's \\u201cShaman\\u201d won the James Fenimore Cooper Prize from the Society of American Historians as the best historical novel of 1991 and 1992. Peter Blauner praised it in The New York Times Book Review, writing that Mr. Gordon \\u201cthrows in all the twists and turns readers expect in a historical drama, but he takes the corners with a measured sense of pace and irony.\\u201d It was a best seller only in Europe, however.\", \"Noah Gordon was born on Nov. 11, 1926, in Worcester, Mass., to Robert Gordon, a pawnbroker who had immigrated from Russia, and Rose (Melnikoff) Gordon, a sales representative.\", \"He served in the Army during World War II, but the war ended before he was scheduled to be shipped to the Pacific. He enrolled in Boston University on the G.I. Bill, his parents hoping he would study to become a doctor. But he lasted one semester in a pre-med course before switching his major to journalism.\", \"\\u201cEver since childhood I had nursed two ambitions of my own,\\u201d Mr. Gordon wrote on his website. \\u201cI wanted to be a newspaperman, and I yearned to write the kind of novels that made me love books.\\u201d\", \"He earned a Bachelor of Science degree in journalism in 1950, then remained at the university to earn a master\\u2019s in English and creative writing the next year.\", \"Moving to New York City, he worked as an editor for Avon Publishing and then at a picture magazine named Focus.\", \"He married Lorraine Seay, who was a student at Clark University when they met in Boston. In addition to her, he is survived by their daughters, Lise Gordon (who worked with him on the screenplay for \\u201cThe Physician\\u201d) and Mary Beth Gordon; their son, Michael; and four grandchildren. A sister and brother died before him.\", \"After several years, the couple returned to Massachusetts, where Mr. Gordon worked for The Worcester Telegram. He was then named the science editor of The Boston Herald after writing articles, on his own initiative, about medical breakthroughs. He began working on \\u201cThe Rabbi\\u201d in his spare time while editing a medical journal when his agent said a publisher had agreed to a modest advance for \\u201cThe Rabbi.\\u201d\", \"He wrote his second novel, \\u201cThe Death Committee,\\u201d about three young doctors at a Boston hospital, while editing another publication, The Journal of Human Stress. (\\u201cThe Death Committee\\u201d was also a Times best seller, although just briefly.) He gave up editing in 1975 and began his third novel, \\u201cThe Jerusalem Diamond.\\u201d\", \"For years he wrote from a farmhouse in Ashfield, Mass., in the Berkshires, until moving back to Boston in 1995.\", \"\\u201cEach morning I go to my computer in anticipation of the emails I receive from readers in many countries,\\u201d Mr. Gordon wrote on his website. \\u201cI am grateful to every reader, for enabling me to spend my life as a scribbler of tales.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"1d585de44e1611ec8e63fdd9d381a2ce"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1d585de44e1611ec8e63fdd9d381a2ce"}},
