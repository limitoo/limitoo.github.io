Top European disease experts said Thursday that it could be the dominant form in Europe within months.\", \"Scientists in South Africa have reported a sudden, sharp rise last month in coronavirus cases among people in that country who had already been infected, in a study that has not yet been reviewed and published by a scientific journal. The authors noted that there was no such upswing when the Beta and Delta variants emerged.\", \"They did not say how many of those reinfections could be attributed to Omicron, but South Africa\\u2019s National Institute for Communicable Diseases reported on Wednesday that when it conducted a genetic analysis on a sampling of coronavirus-positive test results from November, almost three-quarters were the new variant.\", \"\\u201cPopulation-level evidence suggests that the Omicron variant is associated with substantial ability to evade immunity from prior infection,\\u201d the authors of the unpublished study wrote.\", \"In an online briefing held by the World Health Organization\\u2019s regional office for Africa, South African scientists presented a blunter version of the same conclusion, simply based on the country\\u2019s raw numbers: About 40 percent of South Africans have had the coronavirus and about 30 percent have been at least partially vaccinated (though there is no doubt some overlap), and yet the number of new cases is soaring.\", \"\\u201cWe believe that previous infection does not provide them protection from infection due to Omicron,\\u201d said Anne von Gottberg, a microbiologist at the communicable disease institute.\", \"South Africa has the world\\u2019s fastest-growing caseload, though the figures are small compared with those in many other countries. In the first half of November, it was averaging about 260 new reported cases a day. On Tuesday, the figure was over 4,300, the highest in months. It jumped to more than 8,600 on Wednesday, and to more than 11,500 on Thursday.\", \"Scientists say that the number and type of changes suggest that Omicron is much more transmissible than earlier forms of the virus, though solid proof of that is still lacking. As countries around the world have raced to implement new travel rules, with some barring fliers from southern Africa, experts say those measures could have a limited effect if not accompanied by other steps, including expanding vaccinations, wearing masks and social distancing.\", \"\\u201cBorder control can reduce the risk of importation and can buy time,\\u201d Dr. Takeshi Kasai, the World Health Organization\\u2019s regional director for the western Pacific told an online news conference on Friday. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s not possible to completely stop the virus unless you completely close the border, which has a significant impact.\\u201d\", \"\"]","href_hash":"b9680ed2547911ec8374a36c0ef6d50b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b9680ed2547911ec8374a36c0ef6d50b"}},
