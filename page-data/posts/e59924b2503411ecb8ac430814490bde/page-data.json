It will also be the first edition whose content has been overseen by Design Miami\\u2019s new curatorial director, Wava Carpenter, who was appointed in April.\", \"Ms. Carpenter, 47, however, is anything but new to the fair: She was its first employee 15 years ago and has been involved with it on and off, in various capacities, ever since.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019s always had her fingers in what we were doing,\\u201d said Craig Robins, a co-founder of Design Miami. \\u201cThis is now just where it\\u2019s being formalized; it\\u2019s on a larger scale, and she\\u2019s got more responsibility.\\u201d\", \"Starting in 2006, Ms. Carpenter worked full time for five years at the fair, which has its roots in a one-off event, Design 05. For several years, she worked for two design-focused websites but continued, initially, to work for Design Miami part time. In 2019 she returned as a consultant. Her responsibilities have included, among other things, organizing talks, writing catalog text, curating exhibitions and working on designer collaborations. She was also involved in DM/BX, a retail website, which Design Miami introduced in September.\", \"\\u201cStorytelling, in some way, is a through line of it all \\u2014 why something is interesting, why it\\u2019s worth knowing,\\u201d Ms. Carpenter said over tea at a sunny outdoor cafe near her office in Miami\\u2019s Design District, about a 15-minute drive from South Beach. \\u201cThat\\u2019s true in writing articles. That\\u2019s true in curating exhibitions. It\\u2019s even true in merchandising a web shop.\\u201d\", \"As curatorial director, Ms. Carpenter supervises the content of Design Miami\\u2019s fairs in Florida and Basel, Switzerland. (The most recent Swiss edition, in September, was curated by her predecessor, Aric Chen, although she was involved in other aspects of the event.) Podium, an offshoot of Design Miami that was introduced in Miami last year and held in Shanghai this month, is also part of her sphere. (A version in Doha, Qatar, is planned for next spring.) She\\u2019ll keep working with DM/BX, too.\", \"For the last few years, Design Miami\\u2019s fairs, including Podium, have had a theme. The theme for December, which was conceived by Ms. Carpenter, is \\u201cHuman Kind.\\u201d The intention, she said, is \\u201cto talk about leveling hierarchies\\u201d including, she added, \\u201call the creatures of the earth, and among humans as well.\\u201d\", \"The interpretations of that theme are diverse. Southern Guild, a gallery in Cape Town, will be exhibiting ceramics that examine the culture of South Africa\\u2019s Indigenous Xhosa culture, for example. Chicago\\u2019s Volume Gallery will feature pieces by the Los Angeles-based artist Tanya Agui\\u00f1iga; the work is a commentary on threats against Black and Indigenous people and other minorities.\", \"Her commitment to inclusion is nothing new. \\u201cWava has always been a major advocate and champion of unrepresented studio artists and young, up-and-coming emerging talent,\\u201d said Ashlee Harrison, director of the Americas for Carpenters Workshop Gallery (no relation to Ms. Carpenter).\", \"Ms. Carpenter recently co-curated an exhibition at the New York location of Carpenters Workshop Gallery through Anava Projects, an organization she co-founded in 2019 to help socially conscious artists expand their reach. (She remains active in Anava, even at her new position.). Titled \\u201cThe New Guard: Stories from the New World,\\u201d it opened last month. It includes pieces by artists like Anubha Sood and Susannah Weaver.\", \"\\u201cI really like to work with young designers and help them get opportunities,\\u201d Ms. Carpenter said. \\u201cI just get a kick out of trying to make those connections so that they have a leg up.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Carpenter was born in Indianapolis and raised in Astor, Fla., about 300 miles from the Miami Beach tent that will house Design Miami. It was, as she put it, \\u201ckind of middle-of-nowhere Florida.\\u201d She became interested in art as a child, inspired in part by her maternal grandfather, a commercial artist who worked on projects such as painting murals in homes and churches and designing lighting fixtures.\", \"After earning an undergraduate degree in humanities and philosophy in 2003 from Florida State University in Tallahassee, Ms. Carpenter moved to Miami and was hired by an art restorer, which led to helping update hotels like the Sagamore Hotel South Beach. \\u201cI started working with interior designers and I was like, \\u2018I love this!\\u2019\\u201d she said. That passion inspired her move to New York City, to pursue a master\\u2019s degree in the history of decorative arts and design from Parsons School of Design in its partnership with the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, which she earned in 2006. Later that year, she moved back to Florida to work at Design Miami.\", \"Ms. Carpenter lives with her partner, Ren\\u00e9 Morales, chief curator at the P\\u00e9rez Art Museum Miami, and their 10-year-old daughter in the Roads neighborhood of Miami, about five miles south of the Design District.\", \"Although Design Miami has expanded since its inception, one thing has not changed: the lack of a universal term to describe the creations it exhibits, which are sometimes called collectible design, or, alternatively, functional design.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely work that doesn\\u2019t fit into definitions,\\u201d Ms. Carpenter said, \\u201cbut I like to support that work that doesn\\u2019t fit very well.\\u201d\", \"It is a category that, she added, \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t live strictly in the art world.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m happily calling it design.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e59924b2503411ecb8ac430814490bde"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e59924b2503411ecb8ac430814490bde"}},
