Packed with sensors and powered by wind, the Explorer is currently being tested in the Gulf of Aqaba off the coast of Jordan.\", \"\\\"These are exciting times for Task Force 59 as we team with the Royal Jordanian Navy to establish our hub for Red Sea operations in Aqaba and deploy some of our new maritime robotics,\\\" Captain Michael Brasseur, commander of NAVCENT's new task force for unmanned systems and artificial intelligence, said in the Navy's official release.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950936/us-navy-sailboat-drone.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">U.S. Naval Forces Central Command has begun testing a drone modeled off of a sailboat. Above, the aircraft carrier USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN 71) leaves its San Diego homeport on January 17, 2020.</div>\", \"Designed by the California-based company Saildrone, the craft measures 23-feet long and 16-feet tall and can endure voyages up to a year in length. In addition to wind power, it also utilizes solar power for its various sensors. The drone is meant to help expand lines of sight for its various larger crafts without increasing their carbon footprint, according to the Navy.\", \"\\\"Our Saildrones leverage machine learning and artificial intelligence to enhance maritime domain awareness, extending the digital horizon with a sustainable, zero-carbon solution,\\\" Brasseur said.\", \"The Navy established Task Force 59 in September with the aim of integrating unmanned drones into its fleet of ships. Tests were run in the Arabian Gulf in October (an exercise officially dubbed \\\"New Horizon\\\") and off the coast of Bahrain earlier this month.\", \"\\\"Ongoing evaluations of new unmanned systems in U.S. 5th Fleet help drive discovery, innovation and fleet integration,\\\" the Navy's statement continued. \\\"The U.S. Navy is learning important lessons that will inform future operational employment. The Middle East region's unique geography, climate, and strategic importance offer an ideal environment for unmanned innovation through multilateral collaboration. The area includes the world's largest standing maritime partnership, Arabian Gulf, Red Sea, Gulf of Oman and parts of the Indian Ocean.\\\"\", \"The U.S. Coast Guard began testing drone vessels designed by Saildrone in late 2020 off the coast of Hawaii. Their machines have also been tested in the past on yearlong data collection missions and trips between Hawaii and San Francisco. According to the company, its drones are designed for long-term tasks, equipped with standard cameras, infrared cameras, automated receivers, and radar.\"]","href_hash":"77a141265c7611ecaf31ffba7c6777e4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"77a141265c7611ecaf31ffba7c6777e4"}},
