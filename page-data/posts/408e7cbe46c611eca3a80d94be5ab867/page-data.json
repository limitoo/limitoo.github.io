But it got people talking. Now the show’s lead actress is staying positive ahead of opening night.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-16T10:17:28.000Z","content":"[\"The British actor Jeanna de Waal is obviously not the first person to play the part of Diana, Princess of Wales, or even the first person to do it this year. \\u201cWhen we started, it was a lot less populated, the pool of people who played her,\\u201d said de Waal, who stars as the title character in \\u201cDiana, the Musical,\\u201d which opens on Wednesday after a long pandemic delay.\", \"She is not disconcerted by the Diana-Industrial Complex. \\u201cI watch them all, and I can see what they\\u2019re doing,\\u201d she continued, speaking of the other Dianas in circulation \\u2014 currently, Emma Corrin in \\u201cThe Crown\\u201d and Kristen Stewart in \\u201cSpencer\\u201d (there\\u2019s also Diana herself, who appears in the CNN documentary series \\u201cDiana\\u201d). \\u201cWhat I mean is, we all got the same homework, and we all have the same sources, but we all do it differently,\\u201d de Waal said. \\u201cThere are two million ways you could tell her story.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cDiana, the Musical\\u201d tells it in song. The tale of Diana\\u2019s ill-fated marriage to Prince Charles, the heir to the British throne, the production is a frothy, peppy, archly exuberant trip through the familiar byways of this tragic royal relationship, from the couple\\u2019s blundering courtship to the recrimination-filled conclusion of their marriage. (There\\u2019s a sad coda at the end, foreshadowing Diana\\u2019s doomed future.)\", \"It\\u2019s been a long road to Broadway, and de Waal has been there for all of it, since the production\\u2019s first workshop, at Vassar College, in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., back in 2017. The musical opened at La Jolla Playhouse in 2019, moved to Broadway the following year, and shut down after nine previews in March 2020. The set was locked up at the Longacre Theater; the cast and crew scattered.\", \"In person, de Waal, 33, doesn\\u2019t immediately evoke Diana. For one thing, she dyed her dirty-blond hair dark during lockdown, and has kept it that way since. (She wears a series of increasingly dramatic Diana wigs for the show.) She is also forthright and un-self-conscious in a way that Diana, who always seemed brittle beneath the glitter, never was.\", \"De Waal is onstage for almost the whole musical, portraying a sheltered, unworldly young woman whose hidden gifts \\u2014 charisma, sex appeal, a knack for publicity, an extraordinary common touch \\u2014 turn her into a global celebrity and a stealth influencer. \\u201cSometimes, though, it\\u2019s best,\\u201d she sings, \\u201cto be underestimated.\\u201d\", \"In taking on the part, de Waal has had to contend not just with all the other dramatic Dianas, but also with legions of opinionated Diana fans who bring their own preconceptions to new depictions of her. Then there is the problem of lowered expectations. In October, a version of the musical, filmed in an empty theater late last year, was released on Netflix. The response, to put it mildly, was very bad.\", \"The New York Post called it \\u201cthe flop of the year.\\u201d The Guardian gave it one star and said it was \\u201ca Rocky Horror Picture Show of cluelessness and misjudged Judy Garlandification.\\u201d\", \"On Twitter, mesmerized viewers seemed to be hate-watching the show as they would a terrible camp classic. \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry but the Diana musical might be the best worst musical ever written,\\u201d one viewer tweeted.\", \"The good-natured de Waal responds to questions about this awkward situation with what appears to be constitutional equanimity. (\\u201cShe\\u2019s so centered,\\u201d is how the musical\\u2019s director, Christopher Ashley, put it.) Even as the mean tweets came in, her direct messages were filled with enthusiastic responses from people who loved the musical, she said. In addition, the broadcast got people talking, she said, and put the production on lists of shows to watch on Broadway.\", \"\\u201cLook, we didn\\u2019t film this for Netflix because we thought it was bad,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe thought it was fantastic.\\u201d\", \"Ashley said in an interview that the production had made numerous changes since filming the Netflix special. The theater\\u2019s emptiness \\u2014 the lack of laughter, of applause, of an audience\\u2019s ineffable energy \\u2014 drained the production of its high-octane metabolism, he said. \\u201cHaving an audience changes what it feels like.\\u201d\", \"Early Broadway audiences appear not to have heard, or not to care, about the unfortunate publicity. At a preview the other night, the theater was filled with Diana-philes eager to bask once more in a story they know so well. They wore \\u201cDiana\\u201d face masks; they applauded the cunningly staged, lightning-quick royal costume changes; they queued to buy mugs, hoodies and other merchandise. There was applause for iconic outfits; gasps at the appearance of the princess\\u2019s love rival, Camilla Parker Bowles; and a standing ovation at the end. In the line for the bathroom, women debated the relative evilness of Charles and Camilla.\", \"The producers always promised that the show would make it to Broadway after the pandemic. But they had no idea what that would entail. \\u201cI remember the phrase \\u2018flattening the curve,\\u2019\\u201d Ashley said, referring to the city\\u2019s coronavirus lockdown. \\u201cWe thought it would be for a few weeks. The possibility that it would be 600 days before we were back in production on Broadway \\u2014 that was something we didn\\u2019t plan for.\\u201d\", \"As the days without pay stretched on, the cast and crew had to find other sources of income. For de Waal, that came from running Broadway Weekends at Home, a remote version of the musical theater camp that she founded with her sister, Dani, a former actor who works for Google. Hundreds of people signed up during the pandemic, paying a subscription fee to be taught by Broadway and West End performers.\", \"Born in Germany and raised in England, De Waal was always obsessed with musical theater. \\u201cI became a fanatic,\\u201d she said. \\u201cFor birthdays and Christmases, I would ask for CDs of original cast recordings.\\u201d After earning a degree at the Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, she got a job in the ensemble of, and as an understudy in, \\u201cWe Will Rock You\\u201d on the West End. \\u201cIt was a baptism of fire,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI had never done any mic technique work. You know that old thing where singers just sang really loud? You don\\u2019t need to do that with a mic. I bought a microphone, and I practiced at home.\\u201d\", \"In the late aughts, she moved to New York. \\u201cI had no agent, no job, and I started doing Times Square open calls,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI knew no one, and I felt very grown-up and free.\\u201d But soon the work was rolling in: parts in \\u201cAmerican Idiot,\\u201d \\u201cCarrie,\\u201d the \\u201cWicked\\u201d national tour, \\u201cFinding Neverland,\\u201d \\u201cWaitress\\u201d and \\u201cKinky Boots,\\u201d to name a few.\", \"She had a steady string of gigs until her late 20s, when the parts began to dry up. She worked as a caterer and kept going to auditions. She was one of the first people to read for the part of Diana in the workshop; she was hired virtually on the spot.\", \"\\u201cJeanna has been an extraordinary partner in the process,\\u201d Ashley said. \\u201cShe\\u2019s really used these couple of years to deepen her feelings about Diana, to make individual moments more and more specific in terms of the emotion of the scene. Even how she holds herself and her mannerisms have gotten more layered.\\u201d\", \"Back in New York, mid-pandemic, the long, strange delay gave the production the incidental gift of time.\", \"\\u201cNew musicals can make use of the wealth of response you get from that preview period,\\u201d Ashley said. \\u201cHow are the audiences responding? Where do they get quiet? Where do they get restless?\\u201d Two new songs were added; changes were made to dozens of pages of the script and lyrics.\", \"The story also shifted. Originally it focused on Diana\\u2019s disillusionment at the shattering of her happily-ever-after childhood dream. Now it is a sharper, spicier tale about a love triangle that sabotages a marriage. As Diana once said, referring to Camilla: \\u201cThere were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhat we have now is a much more juicy and titillating story of what this marriage was, with Charles and Camilla orchestrating the whole thing and continuing to see each other,\\u201d de Waal said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s also the story of a woman\\u2019s revenge.\\u201d\", \"De Waal was just a child when her father came into her room one morning in late August 1997 and told her that Diana had been in a serious (and ultimately fatal) car accident. But in studying her for the part, de Waal has come to love and admire the princess \\u2014 the way she tried to make something of her life, the way she made a difference.\", \"\\u201cEvery single aspect of this show has come from a place of wanting to celebrate this person,\\u201d de Waal said. \\u201cShe did a hell of a lot more than most people. Who knows where her life would have gone?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"408e7cbe46c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"408e7cbe46c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
