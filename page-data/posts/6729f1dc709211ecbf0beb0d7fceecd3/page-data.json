The rate of hospitalization for kids under five \\u2014 who are not yet eligible for the vaccine \\u2014 is the highest since the pandemic began.\", \"The hospitalization rate among these kids has surged since mid-December to more than 4 in 100,000 children. That's up from 2.5 per 100,000, according to the CDC.\", \"However, the hospitalization rate overall among kids under 18 remains lower than any other age group. They also account for less than 5% of average new daily admissions, the CDC says.\", \"CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said at a briefing Friday that the numbers include kids who are admitted to hospitals due to COVID or other reasons, but then are found to have the virus.\\u00a0\", \"Experts note the Omicron variant appears to be less severe than other variants, but the sheer fact that it's spreading so fast \\u2014 and so many people are getting sick \\u2014 is putting a strain on employers and on hospitals, Michael George reports for \\\"CBS Saturday Morning.\\\"\", \"Nationally, COVID hospitalizations are up in 46 states, a 40% rise from the previous week's average.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It is so easy to transmit that there are lots of patients that have it, but thanks to the vaccine are experiencing either no symptoms or very mild symptoms,\\\" said Dr. Jo Anna Leuck, assistant dean for Curriculum at TCU and UNTHSC School of Medicine.\", \"But unvaccinated individuals who test positive are 17 times more likely to be hospitalized, according to the CDC.\", \"In St. Louis, ICU nurse Denise Huffman said, \\\"We're seeing younger people die.

The CDC says there's a good chance that could happen in the U.S. as well, but they caution that different parts of the country will likely surge at different times.\", \"President Biden on Friday offered some hope.\", \"\\\"COVID, as we're dealing with it now, is not here to stay,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We're going to be able to control this.
