The maps the commission submitted for approval had no majority-Black districts in the city of Detroit, which has 15 such districts under the maps drawn in 2011.\", \"Following a request for an opinion on the meeting from state Senators Jeff Irwin and Ed McBroom, Nessel released a 14-page opinion stating that the commission would likely have some instances where a private meeting was necessary, she could not say for sure this was one of them.\", \"The state constitutional amendment that created the commission in 2018 includes language stating that all business conducted that could influence the drawing of the new maps is required to be public.\", \"\\\"If this presumption is correct, then the Commission was conducting 'business' that should have been done in an open meeting,\\\" Nessel wrote.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938068/michigan-redistricting-dana-nessel.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Michigan's redistricting commission should not have held a private meeting to discuss memos related to racially polarized voting and the federal Voting Rights Act's requirement that people have an opportunity to elect minority candidates, Attorney General Dana Nessel said on November 22, 2021.

At a meeting last week, two commissioners said they were considering potentially releasing the memos.\", \"The panel plans to take final votes on maps in late December, after which lawsuits appear likely.\", \"The commission's experts have said African Americans could still elect candidates of their choice in seats where they comprise under 50 percent of the voting-age population. It has since proposed state House maps with three to seven majority-Black districts\\u2014up from zero under earlier drafts but down from 11 in the map that was drawn a decade ago\\u2014but none for Congress or the state Senate.\", \"FAIR Maps, a conservative group tracking the redistricting process, said the panel should make public all legal memos, minutes and available footage from the closed meeting.\", \"\\\"The Constitution says the public has the right to know what they did and what they discussed.
