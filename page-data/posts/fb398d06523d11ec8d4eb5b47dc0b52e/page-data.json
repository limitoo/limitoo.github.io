Trump and a quieter one that is pushing back.\", \"First, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia called her freshman colleague Nancy Mace of South Carolina \\u201ctrash\\u201d for condemning Ms. Boebert\\u2019s remarks in a television interview.\", \"Ms. Mace then used a series of emojis \\u2014 a bat, a pile of excrement and a crazy clown \\u2014 to describe Ms. Greene, then kept up a steady stream of social media attacks, calling her a liar, a grifter and a nut.\", \"Representative Adam Kinzinger, Republican of Illinois, came to Ms. Mace\\u2019s defense, calling Ms. Greene \\u201cunserious circus barker McSpacelaser\\u201d \\u2014 a reference to a social media post that she once circulated suggesting that wildfires in the West had been started by lasers owned by the Rothschilds, a Jewish banking family.\", \"Mr. Kinzinger added that Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader and would-be speaker who has done nothing to discipline rank-and-file members of his conference for bigoted and violent statements, \\u201ccontinues his silent streak that would make a monk blush.\\u201d\", \"Then Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida, an ally of Ms. Greene\\u2019s, took to Twitter to amplify an attack by the right-wing provocateur Jack Posobiec denouncing Ms. Mace as a \\u201cscam artist\\u201d for promoting coronavirus vaccinations on CNN.\", \"The carnival-like behavior would amount to little more than a sideshow if it did not have real implications for midterm campaigns and, possibly, a fractured Republican majority in 2023. Party leaders again chose to remain mum as their backbenchers brawled, and Democrats took full advantage of the spectacle.\", \"\\u201cThe atmosphere is what it has been and what has been created by the Republican Party over the last 50 years, where they have continued to move down the path of divisiveness, of acrimony, of threats and accusations, which have demeaned the politics of America,\\u201d Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader, told reporters.\", \"He again called on Republican leaders to discipline their members, referring to the episode that touched off the hostilities: public comments by Ms. Boebert in which she suggested that Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota and a Muslim who wears a hijab, could be a suicide bomber and called her a member of the \\u201cjihad squad.\\u201d\", \"The House\\u2019s three Muslim lawmakers \\u2014 Ms. Omar and Representatives Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Andr\\u00e9 Carson of Indiana, all Democrats \\u2014 suggested that their party was looking at options to sanction Ms. Boebert.\", \"\\u201cMuslims in this country are proud Americans, hard-working members of our community,\\u201d Mr. Carson said. \\u201cAnd we are not anyone\\u2019s scapegoat.\\u201d\", \"These should be heady days for House Republicans. Off-year elections this month showed real disenchantment with Democratic control of the House, Senate and White House. Redistricting in Republican-controlled state legislatures has given the party a running start to win the four or five seats it needs to control the House, and polling suggests that a narrow plurality of Americans would rather have Republicans in control of Congress. Given the party\\u2019s structural advantages on redistricting, access to polls and enthusiasm, that suggests a much broader victory would be at hand if the voting were today.\", \"Michael Steel, a former spokesman for Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the former Republican speaker, said the party\\u2019s leaders should be working behind the scenes to calm dissent and keep members focused on building a platform and an argument for control.\", \"\\u201cThe top priority right now should be for everyone in the canoe to have their rifles pointing outward, not at each other,\\u201d Mr. Steel said. \\u201cAnd the focus should be on addition, not subtraction. That means keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow, even if some of those frogs are pretty ugly.\\u201d\", \"Instead, Republicans are stepping on their own message. On Tuesday, CNN unearthed another video of Ms. Boebert from September, when she said she turned to Ms. Omar and referred to the \\u201cjihad squad,\\u201d again insinuating that she could be a suicide bomber.\", \"Ms. Omar has said that no such confrontation occurred. During a call initiated by Ms. Boebert on Monday \\u2014 ostensibly to offer contrition \\u2014 the situation only devolved further, as Ms. Boebert refused to apologize and instead demanded that Ms. Omar publicly ask forgiveness for \\u201canti-American\\u201d comments.\", \"Democrats were not the only ones who condemned Ms. Boebert\\u2019s behavior. Ms. Mace, a highly regarded newcomer and the first woman to graduate from the Citadel military college, appeared on CNN to say, \\u201cI have time after time condemned my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for racist tropes and remarks that I find disgusting, and this is no different than any others.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Greene, who like Ms. Boebert is a favorite of Mr. Trump\\u2019s, criticized Ms. Mace on social media and on Stephen K. Bannon\\u2019s broadcast, \\u201cWar Room,\\u201d and condemned Republican leaders.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re always all over us whenever we say or do anything, but it\\u2019s the Nancy Maces that should be called out,\\u201d Ms. Greene told Mr. Bannon. She added that she, not Ms. Mace, represented the Republican base, a comment seconded by others on the far right, including Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona.\", \"Representative Peter Meijer, Republican of Michigan, defended Ms. Mace.\", \"\\u201cNancy is a serious legislator who rolls up her sleeves and looks for solutions where they can be found, such as federal cannabis decriminalization, but also digs in and fights when progressives put politics above policy,\\u201d Mr. Meijer said. \\u201cI can\\u2019t think of a single credible thing those attacking her have even tried to accomplish.\\u201d\", \"Republican leaders were left pointing fingers at their Democratic counterparts, who they said had also taken no action against members who had crossed lines, whether through anti-Israel comments or exhortations to protesters that they said encouraged violence.\", \"Mr. Hoyer did say that Mr. McCarthy reached out to him to say Ms. Boebert wanted to apologize to Ms. Omar, an overture that Mr. Hoyer said would not end well. He was proved correct.\", \"Mr. McCarthy finds himself in a delicate position. He does not know how large a majority his party might win in November, especially since much of the redistricting has focused on shoring up incumbent advantages than creating more competitive races. A sweeping Republican win would allow him to write off the votes of his party\\u2019s fringe.\", \"But if the Republicans claim a narrow majority, Mr. McCarthy would need virtually all of the conference\\u2019s votes to claim the speakership, a prize he has sought for nearly a decade. The far right brought down Mr. Boehner in 2015, and Republican divisions over the prospects of Mr. McCarthy\\u2019s speakership sunk his last run for the post weeks later.\", \"A handful of members, including Ms. Greene, have been cool to the idea of granting him the gavel should his party claim the majority.\"]","href_hash":"fb398d06523d11ec8d4eb5b47dc0b52e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fb398d06523d11ec8d4eb5b47dc0b52e"}},
