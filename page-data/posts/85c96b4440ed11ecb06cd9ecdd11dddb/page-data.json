The agency said that the looming presence of turtle soup has resulted in \\\"decades and decades of exploitation,\\\" according to an attorney representing the Center for Biological Diversity.\", \"\\\"Alligator snappers are some of the fiercest, wildest creatures in the Southeast,\\\" said attorney Elise Bennett in a news release by the Center, \\\"but overexploitation and habitat destruction have put their lives on the line.\\\"\", \"Around 360,000 alligator snapping turtles live in 12 states. However, those numbers could drop to 5 percent of that without the proper protections. This drop is recorded in a Federal Register notice sent by the Fish and Wildlife Service. Ten of these states have banned the capture of alligator snapping turtles; the agency said that Louisana allows fishers to capture one per day, while Mississippi permits one capture per year. These limits could be retracted if their threatened status is confirmed.\", \"\\\"Many restaurants served turtle soup and purchased large quantities of alligator snapping turtles from trappers in the southeastern States,\\\" the Fish and Wildlife Service statement said. \\\"In the 1970s, the demand for turtle meat was so high that as much as three to four tons of alligator snapping turtles were harvested from the Flint River in Georgia per day.\\\"\", \"None of the 12 states in which the turtles inhabit have commented on the notice.
