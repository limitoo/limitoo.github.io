Kathy Hochul urged New Yorkers on Tuesday to get a coronavirus vaccine booster if they believed they were at high risk or lived in a \\u201chigh transmission area,\\u201d jumping ahead of a possible decision by federal regulators to authorize an additional shot for all adults.\", \"Ms. Hochul went further than earlier comments, but still created some confusion by offering a vague definition of high risk. That may not be an issue for too long, as the Food and Drug Administration is aiming to authorize booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech\\u2019s coronavirus vaccine for all adults as early as Thursday, according to people familiar with the agency\\u2019s plans.\", \"That would expand the number of Americans eligible for additional shots by tens of millions. Some states, including Arkansas and Colorado, recently moved to allow all adults to get a booster instead of waiting for a decision by the federal government. On Monday, New York City urged everyone 18 and older to get a booster shot.\", \"Ms. Hochul said at one point that people should get a booster if they lived in an area with a positivity rate above 4 percent or 5 percent. That includes the area around Albany, the capital, and the Finger Lakes region, according to state data; New York City is at about 1.5 percent.\", \"\\u201cAnyone who lives in these areas and feels risk, that they\\u2019re at risk of catching this virus, they should go get a booster,\\u201d Ms. Hochul said during a briefing in Buffalo on Tuesday afternoon. \\u201cI want to be crystal clear on that.\\u201d\", \"As of Tuesday afternoon, Ms. Hochul had not issued any formal guidance defining a high risk area. Her office later said that the governor did not want to set strict guidance in order to coax as many people to get a booster. \", \"Indeed, Ms. Hochul suggested she was trying to avoid putting out statewide guidance for boosters, stressing that transmission rates varied widely by region and people\\u2019s personal circumstances were different. She said the metric for determining a high transmission area was flexible, adding that \\u201cwhat I\\u2019m not looking for is a broad brush statewide approach to treat every region in the state identically.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Hochul, a Democrat, did not specify whether rates should be considered at a regional, county or citywide level, but she seemed to suggest that vast swaths of the state currently fell under her interpretation of high risk. Even so, she has framed the decision around boosters as one best left to individuals.\", \"She said, for example, that people who live in more densely populated areas or interact with many people on a daily basis may feel more inclined to get a booster and should do so if they so desire.\"]","href_hash":"767f61fd473511ec86b6b916bf4b769a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"767f61fd473511ec86b6b916bf4b769a"}},
