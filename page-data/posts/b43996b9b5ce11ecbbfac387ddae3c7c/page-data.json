in Suai, which prompted an Australian SAS officer to step in and overrule him.\", \"Operator K allegedly directed soldiers to shoot anything that moved outside their camp, including all dogs in the area.\", \"\\\"This concerned me as we had clearing patrols out in the area and this would be dangerous,\\\" SBS soldier AC told military police.\", \"Fisher said the legacy of East Timor was \\\"deeply damaging to the relationship between New Zealand and Australian special forces\\\" in the years that followed.\", \"\\\"It's significant to me that when it came to deploying to Afghanistan,

helicopters, no nothing.\", \"\\\"Pretty light on logistics and exactly the sort of situation where you would turn to your Anzac brother and say, why don't we work together?\\\"\", \"The New Zealand Defence Force confirmed that \\\"NZSAS did not conduct any joint operation in Afghanistan with Australian SAS\\\".\", \"However, it said relations between the special forces played no part in this.\",
