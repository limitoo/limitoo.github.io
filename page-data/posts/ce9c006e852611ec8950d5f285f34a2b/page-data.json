Exemptions will be available only to pregnant women, people who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons and people who have recently recovered from Covid-19. In this first phase, no fines will be imposed for failure to comply.\", \"That changes in mid-March, when the police are to start conducting random checks of vaccination status \\u2014 including during traffic stops. People who cannot produce proof of vaccination can be fined up to 600 euros (about $675). Those who contest their fines could eventually see them increased to \\u20ac3,600 (about $4,100).\", \"In a third phase, for which no starting date has yet been set, the government would create a formal vaccination registry of all residents, and automatically assess fines for noncompliance. If the pandemic recedes enough, though, this phase might never be put into effect, officials say.\", \"Polls suggest that many Austrians support the mandate, but the issue has also galvanized a noisy protest movement in the country. Tens of thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets across the country in recent months to oppose pandemic restrictions, chief among them the vaccine mandate, which was first proposed in November. At the time, cases were surging in the country, driven mostly by unvaccinated people, and Austria introduced a lockdown that applied only to the unvaccinated.\", \"About 76 percent of people in Austria are now fully vaccinated. Even so, a new surge that began in late December has sent new cases soaring to record levels; the daily average has nearly doubled in the last two weeks.\", \"Making vaccines mandatory rather than voluntary has been a threshold that European democracies have long seemed unwilling to cross. Leaders have stressed respect for civil liberties and drawn contrasts with the policies of more authoritarian governments.\", \"But as the pandemic stretches into a third year with vaccination rates plateauing in a number of countries, some leaders have changed their minds.\", \"\\u201cThe path to freedom is the vaccine mandate,\\u201d Chancellor Karl Nehammer of Austria said when the law was debated in Parliament last month.\", \"Last year, when he was interior minister, Mr. Nehammer noted the difficulty governments faced in persuading skeptical people to get inoculated voluntarily.\", \"\\u201cIt is not a question of ideology, it is a question of convincing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t do and try enough to convince so that the unvaccinated get vaccinated.\\u201d\", \"Other countries are watching Austria\\u2019s move to a near-universal mandate closely.\", \"In neighboring Germany, where about one in three people are not considered to be fully vaccinated, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has announced plans for a general vaccine mandate, and the country is slated to introduce one next month for health care workers and residents of nursing homes and care facilities. Italy now requires nearly everyone over 50 to be vaccinated; Greece has a similar rule for residents over 60.\"]","href_hash":"ce9c006e852611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ce9c006e852611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
