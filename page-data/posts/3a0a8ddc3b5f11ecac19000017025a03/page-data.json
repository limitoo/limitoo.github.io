As we pass this bleak milestone, we asked our colleague Lynsey Chutel, based in Johannesburg, to reflect on the legacy of another pandemic.\", \"Summer is approaching in South Africa, and like the purple jacaranda trees blossoming all over Johannesburg, the country is yearning to open up. South Africa has been under varying levels of lockdown since March 2020, and has had the highest number of Covid-19 infections and deaths in Africa.\", \"It is not the first time in recent memory that a pandemic has made South Africans face our collective mortality. In the early 2000s, South Africa was at the center of the H.I.V./AIDS pandemic. If the coronavirus turned our world upside down in less than two years, H.I.V./AIDS shook South Africa\\u2019s foundation for more than a decade.\", \"The two pandemics moved at very different speeds through society, creeping into every aspect of the culture. While the coronavirus pandemic quickly ripped through the world, AIDS moved stealthily, quietly killing thousands before doctors and officials could decide how to respond.\", \"The lessons from the earlier pandemic helped to inform South Africa\\u2019s fight against Covid-19. Many of the scientists who have led the response were the same faces we saw trying to make sense of H.I.V./AIDS. Covid also primed South African society to more readily accept a science-based response. While misinformation has still been common, it was not as widespread as it was two decades ago, when the country\\u2019s health minister suggested that fruit and vegetables could be used to treat AIDS.\", \"Death from AIDS often took many months or years. At funerals, few dared to name the cause of death, which carried a heavy stigma. By contrast, Covid-19 deaths were often quick and lonely, with victims isolated in hospital rooms away from friends and family. By December, as South Africa struggled to contain a second wave driven by the Beta variant, which was first discovered here, we learned how to mourn in small, muted funerals.\", \"In both pandemics, fresh graves mushroomed. During the second and third waves of the coronavirus pandemic, the sprawl of cemeteries felt relentless, as my colleague, veteran photographer Joao Silva, has documented. Silva was also in South Africa years ago to document the AIDS crisis.\", \"This is also why the pace at which vaccines have arrived has been reassuring. About 21 percent of South Africans have been vaccinated. And although fewer than 6 percent of Africans have been fully vaccinated, this is still faster than the arrival of antiretroviral drugs in Africa during the H.I.V./AIDS pandemic.\", \"\\u201cWith H.I.V. there was no political will,\\u201d said Sibongile Tshabalala, the chairwoman of the Treatment Action Campaign, the group that lobbied for access to H.I.V./AIDS drugs. Although some of the stigma against AIDS remains, she said that this time the government has worked hard to acquire Covid-19 vaccines, with limited but tangible success.\", \"Scientists have warned that we may never be fully rid of Covid-19. But by ensuring that the lessons of the past do not go unheeded, South Africa seems better equipped to handle the public health disasters of the present \\u2014 and of the future.\", \"About 9,000 unvaccinated New York City municipal employees were placed on unpaid leave today.\", \"The Police Department estimated that as many as 2,500 employees out of its staff of 55,000 would be placed on leave, but officials were confident they could manage the absences. The Sanitation Department put workers on 12-hour shifts and told many to plan to come in on Sundays.\", \"An additional 12,000 workers, including about 6,500 police officers, have applied for a medical or religious exemption from the vaccine. They are allowed to continue to work, while being tested weekly, until their cases are decided.\", \"The vaccine mandate has been especially contentious within the Fire Department. More than 2,000 New York City firefighters \\u2014 out of a total uniformed force of about 11,000 \\u2014 have taken sick days over the past week in what city officials describe as a large-scale protest against the mandate. \", \"Some 91 percent of municipal workers had gotten at least one shot by Monday, the mayor said. About 84 percent of the Police Department had received at least one dose of the vaccine, up from 70 percent on Oct. 19.\", \"In Chicago: A judge blocked a vaccine mandate for police officers until the issue can be addressed in arbitration.\", \"Our colleague Jessica Grose, who recently moved her coverage of parenting from the newsroom to the Opinion desk, has been looking into when \\u2014\\u00a0or if \\u2014\\u00a0schools should stop requiring children to wear masks.\", \"\\u201cBecause the masking issue has been so divisive, I fear we haven\\u2019t been able to have a practical, nuanced and data-driven conversation about what a good masking policy would look like now that nearly all school-age kids can soon be vaccinated,\\u201d she wrote.\", \"Some experts believe that school masks are still necessary, especially to protect immunocompromised children and those under 5. But others point out that there is a cost to children wearing masks \\u2014 especially those with speech difficulties, autism or sensory challenges.\", \"\\u201cWe need to figure this out,\\u201d Linsey Marr, an engineering professor at Virginia Tech who studies the airborne transmission of viruses, told Jessica. \\u201cThe vaccine should change things for us, and we don\\u2019t want kids to wear masks in school indefinitely.\\u201d\", \"We encourage you to read Jessica\\u2019s piece in full, but here are a few key takeaways:\", \"In general, though, experts were unanimous in urging parents to vaccinate their children.\", \"\\u201cEvery person I spoke to said children 5 and up should get the vaccine,\\u201d Jessica wrote. \\u201cMaybe the carrot of mask-free schools will inspire some more hesitant families to get their children vaccinated.\\u201d\", \"Related: A White House official said the Pfizer pediatric vaccination program is set to be \\u201cat full strength\\u201d next week.\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic. Send us a response here, and we may feature it in an upcoming newsletter.\", \"Sign up here to get the briefing by email.\"]","href_hash":"3a0a8ddc3b5f11ecac19000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3a0a8ddc3b5f11ecac19000017025a03"}},
