I know that, from that range, a two-putt birdie was still good, so to hole that one was a bonus, for sure.\\\"\", \"The world No.7 matched or bettered whatever her closest rivals could throw at her down the stretch - Aussie Stephanie Kyriacou also carded 65 to grab a share of ninth, 13 strokes back.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I know a lot of the top names were playing really well and this is a golf course where there are a fair amount of birdies, so I just tried to have my share of them and just have fun out there.\", \"\\\"It helps when you go into the final round with a four-shot cushion. You could shot the same score, but you still have the shots from the last three days.\", \"\\\"That definitely helps. I birdied the first hole, and holed two really good putts for par on two and three, and that set the momentum up.\", \"\\\"I just tried to not look back and keep going forward.\\\"\", \"After several weeks in Asia and the Middle East, Ko will now return to the LPGA Tour for the Pelican Women's Championship at Belleair, Florida, this week.\"]","href_hash":"1b4d830841f911ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1b4d830841f911ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
