They are adventurous, textured with abrupt tangents and suffused with humor. You might begin by gushing about Michaela Coel\\u2019s 2020 HBO mini-series, \\u201cI May Destroy You,\\u201d only to end up contemplating the history of precolonial Nigeria. Along the way, you might consider Nina Simone\\u2019s 1969 performance of \\u201cTo Be Young, Gifted and Black,\\u201d captured in Questlove\\u2019s 2021 documentary \\u201cSummer of Soul\\u201d; laugh about the age-old beef between Nigerians and Ghanaians; lament tokenism in the creative industries; and eventually rejoice in the power of Octavia Butler\\u2019s mind.\", \"At least, this is how our conversation over coffee in a small white office at the back of Jack Shainman Gallery in New York went last month. \\u201cThere was so much empathy in her words,\\u201d Ojih Odutola said of Butler\\u2019s stories, as she fingered the sleeves of her sweatshirt. \\u201cIt was a place to go, to explore safely and try ideas.\\u201d Indeed, reading Butler, whose science fiction novels are imbued with a deep sense of play and imagination despite their sometimes dark themes, changed Ojih Odutola\\u2019s life and inspired her most recent exhibition, \\u201cToyin Ojih Odutola: A Countervailing Theory,\\u201d which opens at the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., this week.\", \"The show, which was commissioned by the Barbican in London and was on view there from August 2020 until earlier this year, takes the artist\\u2019s experiments with form and narrative to new levels. Featuring 40 large-scale monochromatic drawings and an electrifying soundscape by the Ghanaian British artist Peter Adjaye, it chronicles a forbidden relationship in a fictional ancient Nigerian civilization ruled by the Eshu, a class of female warriors, who manufacture male laborers called the Koba. The contours of this mythology had been gestating since Ojih Odutola read Butler\\u2019s \\u201cPatternmaster\\u201d (1976), a coming-of-age novel set in a deeply bifurcated society, at 19. But it wasn\\u2019t until 2019 that the artist decided to develop her own story, which, she said, was an attempt to write herself into \\u201ca history of Nigeria that felt safe, exploratory and queer.\\u201d\", \"Ojih Odutola, 36, was born in Ife, Nigeria, and moved to the United States with her mother and younger brother when she was 5 years old. The family lived in California\\u2019s Bay Area, where her father was already based, until 1994, then relocated to Huntsville, Ala. Drawing, which she began to do at a young age, helped Ojih Odutola process these moves and her experiences growing up in the South. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a diaristic quality to it that I love,\\u201d she said of the medium. \\u201cEven when there are mistakes in the work, it\\u2019s indicative to me of that 9-year-old who was just trying to copy what she saw in the world and interpret it onto another surface.\\u201d\", \"Despite her early love of image-making, though, Ojih Odutola did not consider herself an artist until her first solo exhibition, \\u201c(Maps),\\u201d at Shainman in 2011. The show opened before her final year at California College of Arts, where she was studying painting and drawing. (Before graduate school, Ojih Odutola received her bachelor\\u2019s degree from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, where she majored in studio art and communications.) On view were hypnotic ink portraits depicting Black people, many of them shown mid-action, against plain white backgrounds and removed from any additional contextual clues: To whom does the hand descending from the top of \\u201cLetting the Ring Finger In\\u201d (2011) belong? And what is the figure in \\u201cSo Sure of Yourself, You Are\\u201d (2011) looking at so intently? The exhibition signaled the emergence of a distinctive style defined by soothing pen strokes and vigorous shading that together create a rippling effect, as if the drawings themselves are pulsing with life.\", \"Ojih Odutola refined this technique and pursued her interest in storytelling in \\u201cToyin Ojih Odutola: To Wander Determined,\\u201d her 2017 solo exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Colors \\u2014 an array of desaturated pinks, sky blues, forest greens and dirt browns \\u2014 entered the images. And the 18 nearly life-size charcoal, pastel and pencil portraits wove a capacious tale centered on two young Nigerian aristocrats who lounge in bed, roam their vineyards and write dispatches updating each other on their travels. The artist herself also took on a new role: \\u201cThe works presented here are entrusted to the current Marquess of UmuEze Amara, TMH Jideofor Emeka, and his husband, Lord Temitope Omodele from the House of Obafemi,\\u201d Ojih Odutola wrote, assuming the voice of the deputy secretary of the couple\\u2019s estate, in a letter included in the exhibition. Losing herself entirely within this fully realized invented universe, she moved from merely translating experiences to constructing them.\", \"The enthusiastic reception of Ojih Odutola\\u2019s work has both confirmed her talent and reflected the appetite of our current moment. In recent years, gallerists and viewers have been increasingly eager to see images of Black people in the kinds of art institutions from which they were long excluded. But Ojih Odutola is not interested in simply inserting Black faces into traditionally white spaces, or in mirroring back to white audiences what they presume to know about Black people. Instead, she wants to question the logic behind what we, as Black people, believe, and to burrow into the sense of uncertainty created by imagining alternative existences. Her images ask us to think beyond representation and to wrestle with the implications of power, to consider who gets to tell stories about the world.\", \"With \\u201cA Countervailing Theory,\\u201d Ojih Odutola pushed these questions \\u2014 and herself \\u2014 even further. She returned to a monochromatic palette but instead of using white backgrounds, she drew with white charcoal and pastel on black canvas. For both iterations of the show, she specified that the works should be hung unevenly, and the walls painted in a monochromatic gradation to produce an undulating effect. And although she had never collaborated with another artist before, she approached Adjaye about creating a spectral soundscape that would reinforce the installation\\u2019s self-contained world. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a really intuitive composer, and he was able to translate the beats that pictures can\\u2019t,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe was able to form this new, beautiful language of sound into this visual language, which is also otherworldly and strange.\\u201d\", \"Ojih Odutola\\u2019s hope is that visitors will surrender themselves and their imaginations to the exhibition completely, enabling a kind of sacred experience. Toward the end of our conversation, just before she answered the questions below, she referenced a note she included (this time in the voice of a fictional Nigerian archaeologist) at the end of the show. \\u201cWe appreciate and welcome all those who are willing to engage in this fascinating discovery with us,\\u201d the wall text reads, \\u201cdespite not knowing the full extent of its meaning.\\u201d Though the statement is a coda of sorts for \\u201cA Countervailing Theory,\\u201d it is also a sentiment that rings true with her entire body of work, an invitation to submit to the fantasy and join her in her reverie.\", \"What is your day like?\", \"No day is ever the same. Because of the nature of being an artist now, there is so much more involved than just making a work. I wish I had a routine, but it\\u2019s just not possible.\", \"How much do you sleep?\", \"Six hours a night, give or take. I find nocturnal activity in the studio to be very fruitful, so sleep for me is predicated on that. The best work I\\u2019ve ever done, across the board, in any series, has been at night when I\\u2019m fully in the long haul. Around three or four in the morning, some things go down and it\\u2019s magical.\", \"How many hours of creative work do you think you do in a day?\", \"It\\u2019s incalculable. It never stops in the studio; it follows you everywhere.\", \"What\\u2019s the first piece of art you ever made?\", \"A perfect rendering of Timon from \\u201cThe Lion King\\u201d (1994) when I was 9 years old.\", \"What\\u2019s the worst studio you ever had?\", \"I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ve ever had a bad studio. Every studio I\\u2019ve been in, I\\u2019ve been grateful to have it.\", \"When you start a new piece, where do you begin?\", \"Each one is different, but usually there is an idea in the form of a question. That question is just the impetus because then there is the material. I could have this question but then the pastel could be like, \\u201cNo, that\\u2019s not what we do.\\u201d It becomes a puzzle and every individual piece is an opportunity to test things and figure it out.\", \"How do you know when you\\u2019re done?\", \"When someone pries the work out of my hands.\", \"How many assistants do you have?\", \"None, but I wish I did; my life would be so much easier.\", \"Have you assisted other artists before? If so, who?\", \"I haven\\u2019t.\", \"What music do you play when you\\u2019re making art?\", \"That\\u2019s a good question. It depends on the mood, but mostly it\\u2019s jazz. I\\u2019ve been listening to a lot of Sonny Rollins lately.\", \"Are you bingeing any shows right now?\", \"I just started watching \\u201cFoundation\\u201d (2021) and \\u201cScenes From a Marriage\\u201d (2021).\", \"What\\u2019s the weirdest object in your studio?\", \"A pair of Gucci loafers I bought recently in Italy. They were way too expensive and they were the worst shoes of all time. Every time I was walking, all these Italians were looking at me with pity, like, \\u201cWhat are you doing?\\u201d They are now my studio shoes as a reminder to me that there\\u2019s luxury within you and don\\u2019t need that to be justified with these petty little objects.\", \"How often do you talk to other artists?\", \"All the time. It\\u2019s the joy of my life. I love hashing out ideas.\", \"What do you do when you\\u2019re procrastinating?\", \"Oh, god. I watch movies, read. I like to walk a lot, it\\u2019s been a big thing for my mental health.\", \"What\\u2019s the last thing that made you cry?\", \"Thinking about my parents\\u2019 reaction to my show.\", \"What do you usually wear when you work?\", \"An apron, and whatever I feel is clean that day.\", \"If you have windows, what do they look out on?\", \"Another building, and it\\u2019s creepy. They are doing construction right now and it\\u2019s freaking me out because that means there are people who are going to move in soon, so I\\u2019ll need to get some curtains.\", \"What do you bulk buy with most frequency?\", \"Latex gloves.\", \"Do you exercise?\", \"No.\", \"What are you reading?\", \"\\u201cTell Them I Said No\\u201d (2016) by Martin Herbert, \\u201cOpen Water\\u201d (2021) by Caleb Azumah Nelson and \\u201cBlackspace: On the Poetics of an Afrofuture\\u201d (2020) by Ana\\u00efs Duplan. \\u201cTell Them I Said No\\u201d is about artists, like David Hammons, who turned their backs on the art world. \\u201cOpen Water\\u201d is just a beautiful story: It\\u2019s great to have good fiction that reminds you of parts of yourself that you might have forgotten. And \\u201cBlackspace\\u201d taught me how to lean back into the imaginary of not just Black bodies but also Black spirituality. We have been forced to think about our bodies so much in spaces but not so much about our spirits.\", \"This interview has been edited and condensed.\"]","href_hash":"c755b478495611ec8d6899bfb6d9e253"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c755b478495611ec8d6899bfb6d9e253"}},
