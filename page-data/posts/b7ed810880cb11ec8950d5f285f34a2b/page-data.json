Only some adventurous batting from the lower order helped them to 100 runs, surviving a hat-trick chance for Leigh Kasperek in the process.\", \"\\\"It's always nice to contribute to the team effort,\\\" reflects Devine.\\u00a0\", \"The result completes an unbeaten season for the Blaze, who were upset in last year's final by Canterbury Magicians and sought to make amends.\", \"\\\"Our processes have been really clear throughout and we just stuck to them,\\\" says Devine. \\\"We knew they had threats with the ball all the way through, so we knew we needed a good total and we were able to do so.\", \"\\\"Maddy's got a really good head on her shoulders. She sometimes reins me in and I sometimes rein her in - it's all about partnerships with the bat and ball.\\\"\", \"Devine also contributed with ball in hand, taking the key wickets of Katey Martin and Kate Ebrahim, whom she served a parting message, as she left the field.\", \"Blaze 175/4 (Devine 92, Green 55, Black 2/36) Sparks 100 (Martin 16, Black 16, Kasperek 3/23)\", \"Wellington win by 75 runs\", \"More to come\"]","href_hash":"b7ed810880cb11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b7ed810880cb11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
