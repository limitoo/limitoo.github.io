And this is any sexual stuff. But I think clearly right now, we see a focus on transgenderism, telling kids they may be able to pick genders and all of that.\\\"\", \"The bill is designed to limit how the LGBTQ community is discussed in public school classrooms by restricting conversations, considered \\\"instruction,\\\" particularly related to the youngest elementary children. But those limitations could be felt in higher grades. \", \"The bill allows parents to sue school districts if they are not privy to situations related to their children or if their students are encouraged to have discussions on sexual orientation and gender identity.\", \"Florida's House has approved the bill, and it will appear before the Senate for a vote on Monday.\", \"Nationwide, there are 18 similar bills moving through nine state legislatures. The advocacy group, The Trevor Project, has denounced them and said its research shows LGBTQ students who learned about LGBTQ issues or people at school had 23% lower odds of reporting a suicide attempt in the past year.\\u00a0 \\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"d73ffe749c9011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d73ffe749c9011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
