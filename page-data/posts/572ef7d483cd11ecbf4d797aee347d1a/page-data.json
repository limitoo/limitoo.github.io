The latest addition to this cohort is 20-year-old Molly, a New Yorker who has just met her distant cousins in Paris.\", \"Thankfully it is they, not sweet, passive Molly, who are the subjects of \\u201cPrayer for the French Republic,\\u201d Joshua Harmon\\u2019s ambitious and maddening, thought-provoking and schematic new play, directed by David Cromer at Manhattan Theater Club.\", \"At the very beginning, the matriarch, Marcelle Salomon Benhamou (an excellent Betsy Aidem), painstakingly explains her family\\u2019s genealogical ties to Molly (Molly Ranson). They are so complicated that Marcelle has to repeat them for the young woman\\u2019s benefit, and of course the audience\\u2019s as well. Even then, it takes much of the play\\u2019s three-hour running time and some toggling between 2016-17 and 1944-46 for the connections and their consequences to sink in.\", \"Harmon (\\u201cSignificant Other,\\u201d \\u201cAdmissions\\u201d) has set himself quite a challenge because Molly has arrived at a critical juncture for Marcelle; her husband, Charles (Jeff Seymour); and their 20-something children, Daniel (Yair Ben-Dor) and Elodie (Francis Benhamou). Daniel, who wears a kipa, has come home with a bloodied face after an antisemitic aggression. It is just another example of what Charles feels is an increasingly scary climate for Jews in France, a last straw that makes him want to move to Israel.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s the suitcase, or the coffin,\\u201d he says, referring to his ancestors\\u2019 forced wandering as he may be about to emulate it. (One of the play\\u2019s most fascinating aspects, though an underexplored one, is how these characters represent two strands of French Judaism: Marcelle\\u2019s Ashkenazi ancestors have been rooted in France for centuries, while Charles\\u2019s are Sephardic Jews who lived in North Africa for generations before relocating from Algeria in the 1960s.)\", \"The Benhamous have spirited arguments that have the urgency of life-or-death decisions: Should they stay or should they go? What does it mean to be Jewish in France? (The play\\u2019s title refers to a prayer that has been said in French synagogues since the early 19th century.)\", \"Some of the show\\u2019s concerns, including the temptation of appeasement via assimilation \\u2014 a position embodied by Marcelle\\u2019s brother, Patrick (Richard Topol) \\u2014 echo those Harmon explored, in a much more comic vein, in his blistering debut, \\u201cBad Jews,\\u201d from 2012. That show was dominated by a hurricane-like character named Daphna, and she now has a marginally milder-mannered relative in Elodie, who injects volatile energy every time she opens her mouth.\", \"Incidentally, Ranson was also in \\u201cBad Jews\\u201d and once again finds herself on the receiving end of impassioned, and often wickedly funny, tirades and put-downs that have the biting rhythm of New York Jewish humor rather than a French sensibility. (A faux pas: The Benhamous buy croissants in an American-type cardboard box rather than the paper bags used in French boulangeries.)\", \"All of this would be enough to pack any story, but Harmon also transports us to the end of World War II for several scenes with Marcelle and Patrick\\u2019s older relatives \\u2014 their grandparents, Irma and Adolphe Salomon (Nancy Robinette and Kenneth Tigar, both heart-wrenching), have somehow managed to survive in occupied Paris and held on to their piano store.\", \"The two narratives progressively start bleeding into each other, with Marcelle and Patrick\\u2019s father, Pierre (Peyton Lusk in the 1940s, Pierre Epstein in the 2010s), embodying the link, both literal and metaphorical, between past and present.\", \"Cromer, a technically astute and emotionally sensitive director, handles the back and forth as well as you might expect \\u2014 he puts a stage turntable to evocative, if perhaps a little clich\\u00e9d, use, for example. Still, it\\u2019s not hard to feel the show\\u2019s tension slacken when we leave the Benhamous. The play\\u2019s finale that aims for the lofty and falls short, you may wonder what the future holds for them.\"]","href_hash":"572ef7d483cd11ecbf4d797aee347d1a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"572ef7d483cd11ecbf4d797aee347d1a"}},
