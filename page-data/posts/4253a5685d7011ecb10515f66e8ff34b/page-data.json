The company also said that laboratory experiments had indicated that the drug would attack a key protein in the Omicron variant.\", \"Pfizer said that the pill, Paxlovid, reduced the risk of hospitalization and death by 88 percent when given within five days of the onset of symptoms to unvaccinated people at high risk of severe Covid. About 0.7 percent of patients who received the drug were hospitalized within 28 days of entering the trial, and none died. By contrast, 6.5 percent of patients who received a placebo were hospitalized or died.\", \"America\\u2019s response to the Omicron variant highlights how much progress has been made over the past two years \\u2014 and how much work remains in a country that is now averaging 120,000 cases a day, a 49 percent increase over two weeks. Here\\u2019s what it takes to understand a variant.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"A new generation of floating, autonomous probes that can collect data on temperature, density and other subjects for years \\u2014 diving deep underwater, and even exploring beneath the Antarctic sea ice, before rising to the surface to phone home \\u2014 has enabled scientists to learn much more about the immense, forbidding Southern Ocean.\", \"The dominant feature of that ocean, extending up to two miles deep and as much as 1,200 miles wide, is the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. It is the world\\u2019s climate engine, and it has prevented further warming by drawing deep water from other oceans and pulling it to the surface. Our interactive shows how the current works.\", \"But those probes have shown that global warming is affecting the Antarctic current in complex ways, and those shifts could complicate the ability to fight climate change in the future. In addition, the Southern Ocean is getting warmer, potentially putting the Antarctic\\u2019s vast, thick ice sheets at risk.\", \"Quotable: In effect, \\u201cAntarctica is melting from the bottom,\\u201d said Henri Drake, an oceanographer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\", \"Bruised by haphazard pandemic border controls and an ongoing crisis with Belarus, the E.U. proposed changes yesterday that could chip away at the unfettered movement of people within the bloc. The proposed reforms must still be approved by national governments and the European Parliament, which could take months.\", \"Under the new rules, member states could introduce border checks whenever they wanted and extend them almost indefinitely. They would then be able to suspend some protections for asylum seekers if neighboring countries orchestrate migratory flows to the bloc\\u2019s borders, as Belarus has done in recent months.\", \"The European Commission, the bloc\\u2019s executive arm, said the changes would help member countries better respond to troubles stemming from migration and the pandemic. But critics argue that the proposals would scale back one of the E.U.\\u2019s main achievements, the freedom of movement of people and goods, and would introduce significant cuts to humanitarian protections.\", \"By the numbers: Almost 1.7 million people live in one country in the Schengen area, which allows passport-free travel among participating countries, and work in another, while an estimated 3.5 million people cross an internal border every day. Undermining the area would not only be a political risk; it could also have enormous economic consequences for the bloc, one Slovenian lawmaker observed.\", \"When Jack Nicas, a Times reporter in Brazil, first arrived in Rio de Janeiro, a colleague immediately invited him to a \\u201cdirty foot\\u201d \\u2014 a Brazilian blend of a dive bar and a greasy spoon. \\u201cMy reputation, it appeared, had preceded me,\\u201d he writes.\", \"Wherever Jack has reported \\u2014 Oakland, Calif.; the tiny town of Phoenix, Ore.; and now Rio \\u2014 he has sought out these hubs of community, he explains: \\u201cThey are haunts for people of all stripes, the spots where people go to let go, and the kinds of places that make a city what it is.\\u201d\", \"The New York of Wes Anderson\\u2019s sprawling comedy-drama \\u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums,\\u201d released 20 years ago this month, blurs fact and fiction.\", \"The story of a family of former child geniuses, it is Anderson\\u2019s only film shot entirely in and around New York City.

Son Chas is in the midst of a nervous breakdown following the death of his wife in a plane crash, in a perpetual state of fear and paranoia. For audiences at the New York Film Festival, where \\u201cThe Royal Tenenbaums\\u201d first unspooled in October 2001, Chas\\u2019s state of mind seemed undeniably, unnervingly contemporary.\", \"This is the perfect week to plan your Christmas dinner if you celebrate that holiday \\u2014 or consider an end-of-year blowout meal even if you don\\u2019t.
