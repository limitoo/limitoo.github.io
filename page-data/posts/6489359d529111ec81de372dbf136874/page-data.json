Ms. Tokhmafshan suggested the interdisciplinary response to the pandemic among scientists, in fields ranging from public health, to immunology, zoology and epidemiology, helped people to understand the connections between science and their own well-being.\", \"\\u201cThe general public may not know scientists in real life, but most people know a doctor or a nurse,\\u201d Ms. Tokhmafshan said. \\u201cNow everyone has at least heard of a scientist or read something by a scientist.\\u201d\", \"Conducted by Gallup, the poll interviewed people from August 2020 to February 2021, while vaccine trials were underway and largely before Covid vaccines were publicly available in many countries.\", \"Worldwide, trust levels rose most substantially among people who said they knew \\u201csome,\\u201d \\u201cnot much\\u201d or \\u201cnothing at all\\u201d about science since the poll was last conducted in 2018. This suggests that people without much experience with science may have gained awareness of its importance during the pandemic, according to the study\\u2019s authors.\", \"The percentage of people who said they had \\u201ca lot\\u201d of trust in science increased by at least 10 points in East Asia (especially China), Latin America, Eastern Europe and Southeast Asia.\", \"Within the United States, the survey found that 54 percent of Americans said they had \\u201ca lot\\u201d of trust in scientists, an increase of 9 percentage points from the 2018 poll. The most recent U.S. survey data was collected from August 2020 to October 2020, as confirmed coronavirus cases per 100,000 people rose by 60 percent.\", \"The results may surprise those who monitor the surge of misinformation about the virus, which has led many to question vaccines, to reject public health measures such as masking and distancing or to seek unapproved treatments like antimalarial drugs or ivermectin, which is mainly used as an animal deworming drug.\", \"A more recent Gallup poll conducted in July found confidence in science has increasingly diverged across partisan lines. Since the last poll was taken in 1975, Republican confidence in science fell by 27 points while Democrat confidence increased by 12 points. \", \"\\u201cThe share of people who fall victim to conspiracy theories and misinformation has grown, just as the percentage of people who trust science and respect science has grown,\\u201d Ms. Tokhmafshan said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a growth that has happened on both sides.\\u201d\", \"The survey also found people in the United States have significantly less confidence in the government\\u2019s perception of science. Only 13 percent of Americans said their government officials valued the opinions and expertise of scientists \\u201ca lot\\u201d \\u2014 derived from a question posed during the final stretch of the administration of former President Donald J. Trump.\", \"\\u201cAlthough this report provides a snapshot of views in 2020, prior to successful vaccines or licensed treatments, it\\u2019s vital that we can listen to \\u2014 and understand \\u2014 people\\u2019s views,\\u201d said Beth Thompson, an associate director of policy at the Wellcome foundation, in a statement.\", \"Maimuna Majumder, a computational epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Boston Children\\u2019s Hospital who was not involved in the poll, said she had noticed more people taking an interest in her perspective than they would have before the pandemic. She also found that the politicization of the pandemic has influenced who does and does not trust her as a scientist.\", \"\\u201cThe fact that I\\u2019m also Muslim, BIPOC, and use she/they pronouns impacts who finds my perspectives as a scientist to be trustworthy,\\u201d Dr. Majumder wrote in an email.\", \"In Ms. Tokhmafshan\\u2019s eyes, scientists should elevate the voices of scientists from marginalized groups, as well as increase outreach to underserved communities that might harbor historical mistrust in medical institutions.\", \"\\u201cRepresentation and equity is very, very important for building trust,\\u201d Ms. Tokhmafshan said.\"]","href_hash":"6489359d529111ec81de372dbf136874"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6489359d529111ec81de372dbf136874"}},
