That's not necessarily the spinners' fault.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"But it also shows the strength with where we're at with our pace bowling unit at the moment.\", \"\\\"The key message that went to Ajaz is in New Zealand conditions, we think our four seamers is how we're highly likely to go. The role that they play isn't one that perhaps is the same as you'd play in Asian or overseas conditions.\", \"However, that doesn't mean the Blackcaps will enter the summer's first test without any player capable of bowling spin.\", \"Fresh from his maiden test series, 22-year-old Rachin Ravindra has been included in the 13-man squad, and will likely slot in at No.7 in the batting order as the all-rounder, Stead all but confirms.\", \"\\\"Don't forget, we still do have Rachin Ravindra in the side as well. So it's not like we're saying 'there's definitely no chance we're playing a spinner.'\", \"\\\"Given the history of playing at Mt Maunganui, I'd be surprised if Rachin's not part of that starting XI.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"d0bd6ab4637911ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d0bd6ab4637911ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
