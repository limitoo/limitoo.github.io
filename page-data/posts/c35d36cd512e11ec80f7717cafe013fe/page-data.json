The World Health Organization (WHO) classified it as a variant of concern on Friday.\", \"The U.S.'s travel ban does not apply to American citizens, who are still able to travel home.\", \"But the flurry of flight cancellations and struggles finding a connecting flight means Brady has been trying to book a flight home since Friday with no success, the station reported.\", \"\\\"We went from having two flights to zero flights and then after that we booked, I don't know, we probably booked 10 flights in total,\\\" Brady told the news station. \\\"It hit us like a ton of bricks and of course every other traveler is going through this right now.
