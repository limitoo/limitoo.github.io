But Hardwick always seemed to know where she was going, and who she was going to be. Bored by academic research and skeptical about her job prospects, she dropped out of Columbia and began writing for Partisan Review. For years she lived in drab rooming houses, sometimes on the edge of starvation. Eventually she became part of the Review\\u2019s inner circle, married Robert Lowell and helped found The New York Review of Books. When she died in 2007, she was one of the most influential \\u2014 and feared \\u2014 American critics of the postwar era. William Phillips, the co-editor of Partisan Review, called her, dryly, \\u201cone of our most cutting minds.\\u201d\", \"Hardwick\\u2019s reviews were always penetrating, and sometimes brutal. She made a lifelong enemy of Lillian Hellman and did not spare even her best friend, Mary McCarthy, from malicious satire when she parodied McCarthy\\u2019s 1963 novel \\u201cThe Group\\u201d in The New York Review. But she was a romantic at heart and her life\\u2019s grand passion was literature \\u2014 worth all the poverty, sacrifice and burned bridges. She read everything and took her role as a standard-bearer seriously: If not her, then who? Hardwick\\u2019s marriage to Lowell, whom she thought one of the best poets of his generation, was a manifestation of this great literary passion. Hardwick was cleareyed about Lowell\\u2019s mental illness but reluctant to give up on him, even in his nastiest phases. \\u201cI will never find his equal,\\u201d she wrote to a friend. By saving Lowell, over and over, she saved his extraordinary gift; her loyalty was as much to the poetry as to the man. Hardwick knew history was watching, and she knew what was expected of her: \\u201cIt\\u2019s been my experience that nobody holds a man\\u2019s brutality to his wife against him.\\u201d\", \"The Hardwick-Lowell marriage comprises the heart of \\u201cA Splendid Intelligence,\\u201d the first, succinct biography of Hardwick (1916-2007), despite an early disclaimer that we won\\u2019t hear much about Lowell. Cathy Curtis follows the lead of two recent books \\u2014 \\u201cThe Dolphin Letters, 1970-1979,\\u201d edited by Saskia Hamilton, and \\u201cRobert Lowell: Setting the River on Fire,\\u201d by Kay Redfield Jamison \\u2014 in revealing Hardwick\\u2019s trials, strength and compassion during the Lowell years. Curtis sheds new light on Hardwick\\u2019s academic wanderings with Lowell in Iowa and Ohio, and their miserable sojourn in Europe. (Hardwick shopped, cooked and cleaned with no help from Lowell. \\u201cI have known the bottom of drudgery and ugliness,\\u201d she wrote to her friends the writers Peter and Eleanor Taylor.) We learn, through liberal quotation of Hardwick\\u2019s unpublished letters, how deeply she suffered through Lowell\\u2019s manic episodes, hospitalizations and adulterous love affairs. She wrote to friends about the \\u201cmoral and psychological torture\\u201d Lowell inflicted upon her, and constantly apologized to editors for missing deadlines on account of \\u201cfamily troubles.\\u201d\", \"For all her pain, Hardwick tried hard to keep her husband\\u2019s struggles private: The farther he fell, the straighter she stood. But by the time Lowell left her for the writer Caroline Blackwood, a daughter of a Guinness heiress, in 1970, Hardwick was ready to let go. Blackwood had her own problems and, as Hardwick predicted, could not give Lowell the practical and emotional support he needed during his manic phases. He died in a New York City taxi, on his way back to Hardwick. She later said the marriage, despite its turbulence and indignities, was the best thing that ever happened to her.\", \"Like her friends Elizabeth Bishop and Susan Sontag, Hardwick made her literary name in a man\\u2019s world that was tough and unsentimental, and she was initially suspicious of second-wave feminism. Her critique of Simone de Beauvoir\\u2019s \\u201cThe Second Sex,\\u201d which appeared in Partisan Review, is a masterpiece of feminist equivocation: \\u201cThis book is an accomplishment; on the other hand, if one is expecting something truly splendid and unique like \\u2018The Origins of Totalitarianism,\\u2019 by Hannah Arendt, to mention another woman, he will be disappointed.\\u201d Hardwick argued that women lacked worldly experience, and were thus incapable of matching men\\u2019s literary accomplishments. Someone had to raise the children, make the meals and clean the house, and \\u201cwomen are fairly well adapted to this necessary routine.\\u201d\", \"This review was widely praised; Lowell wrote to Peter Taylor that Hardwick had proved \\u201cwith all the eloquence of Shelley that no woman can ever be as good as a man.\\u201d (He was only half-joking, Curtis notes.) Although Hardwick admired her husband\\u2019s groundbreaking 1959 collection \\u201cLife Studies,\\u201d she was more skeptical toward what she considered the excesses of women confessional poets. She admitted that she felt a \\u201cnearly unaccountable attraction and hostility to the work of other women writers. Envy, competitiveness, scorn infect my judgment at times.\\u201d She commended Sylvia Plath\\u2019s austere poetry, but characterized her suicide as an act of dramatic performance art. She infuriated Maxine Kumin when she called Anne Sexton\\u2019s suicide \\u201cso stagy.\\u201d\", \"Yet Curtis, the author of a biography of the artist Elaine de Kooning, among other books, complicates our understanding of Hardwick\\u2019s feminism, such as it was, noting that she was less complacent about women\\u2019s struggles than she appeared. (\\u201cCourage under ill-treatment is a woman\\u2019s theme,\\u201d she wrote in 1973.) Hardwick published a celebrated essay collection, \\u201cSeduction and Betrayal,\\u201d about women writers, and had strong female literary allies, not only McCarthy, but also Bishop and Adrienne Rich, who rallied round her during the \\u201cDolphin\\u201d controversy, when Lowell published parts of her letters without her permission; and she was devoted to Sontag, who dedicated an essay collection to her. Joan Didion wrote that Hardwick was the only writer she knew \\u201cwhose perception of what it means to be a woman and a writer seems in every way authentic, revelatory, entirely original.\\u201d\", \"As the years passed, Hardwick grew less wary of the women\\u2019s movement. She conceded in 1985 that her review of \\u201cThe Second Sex\\u201d had been shortsighted, and that Beauvoir\\u2019s work had ushered in a new era for women. And she understood better than most the obstacles women faced in their struggle to gain power, writing that \\u201cwomen will have to take it from the present holders \\u2014 men. \\u2026 It will not come as a gift.\\u201d\", \"Curtis treats Hardwick\\u2019s work with respect and admiration, though her detailed, dutiful summaries of essays and fiction sometimes grow tedious, and come at the expense of historical context and literary insight. Her discussion of Hardwick\\u2019s acclaimed novel \\u201cSleepless Nights\\u201d quickly dissolves into a list of blurbs and reviews. If we get too many details about the work, we sometimes get too few about the life. Curtis skims over Hardwick\\u2019s childhood and adolescence in Kentucky and her relationship with her parents, who are shadowy figures here. Alarming suggestions of sexual assault are dropped into the narrative and left to sit, unexplored. Curtis spends considerable time on the Hardwick-Lowell marriage, but is nearly silent about Hardwick\\u2019s experience of motherhood.\", \"These omissions may be due to a dearth of primary sources \\u2014 Hardwick\\u2019s daughter, Harriet Lowell, declined to be interviewed for the book \\u2014 but even well-known figures sometimes get short shrift. I wanted to know more about Hardwick\\u2019s sustaining friendships with McCarthy, Sontag, Rich, Bishop and Arendt \\u2014 legends whose names appear often, but mostly in outline. Curtis quotes from letters among these brilliant women, but does not really probe the deeper currents of their affections, alliances and rivalries. Still, I finished this book with a strong sense of Hardwick\\u2019s resolve and intelligence. Hardwick, who hated biographies, might have approved.\"]","href_hash":"408e7cc246c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"408e7cc246c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
