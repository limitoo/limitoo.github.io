We believe that the community takes care of each other. It doesn't make sense that our legislators here in the state continue to go after folks for their personal lives, because that's really not what we're about here.\\\"\", \"She said that the bill will immediately stop access to care for 90% of the people that see her for abortions and that those patients will likely be forced to consider going out of state or to continue unwanted pregnancies.\", \"Her biggest fear is for women who will seek dangerous alternatives to a medical abortion with the help of a doctor - but she also fears for herself.\", \"\\\"I'm afraid for my personal future and the future of my career as a result of this.\\\"\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/464/cpsprodpb/10301/production/_98950366_presentational_grey_line464-nc.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Presentational grey line</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How does this law differ from other restrictions?</div>\", \"Most abortion restrictions that have been proposed before have relied on criminal penalties or some form of regulatory punishment.\", \"The Texas law, which was signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott in May, instead authorises \\\"a private civil right of action\\\", which allows people to sue to enforce the law even if they themselves have not been harmed.\", \"An ordinary American, from Texas or elsewhere, may now be able to seek up to $10,000 (\\u00a37,200) in damages in a civil court against abortion providers and doctors - and possibly anyone at all involved in the process.
