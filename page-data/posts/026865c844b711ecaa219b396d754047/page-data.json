Or, more realistically, backed Christie and TJ Perenara to do the job.\", \"The Beauden Barrett v Richie Mo'unga selection saga has rolled on, with Barrett getting the nod after his excellent performance against Wales.\", \"It's almost at the point now where we have to accept that Ian Foster is simply using the two as horses for courses, with every chance Mo'unga will be back starting next weekend.\", \"For Beauden Barrett though, his selection is somewhat coupled with his brother Jordie, whose fine form has meant he is now definitely the first choice fullback and a reliable goalkicker as well. That was the one thing Mo'unga had over Beauden, but now the 100 test veteran can just get his kid brother to take the tee for him.\", \"Sam Cane is still being kept on ice even though he got through the game against Italy unscathed.\", \"Just exactly what the backburner approach to his comeback does for his future captaincy will be interesting, as Samuel Whitelock has been a natural fit as leader and doesn't look like he's in any mood to call it a day any time soon. At 33, he still has another World Cup in him and will likely leave as the most capped All Black of all time.\", \"Sevu Reece's selection shows how one massive deviation in his career could have seen him be playing against the All Blacks rather than for them, his discharge without conviction of a male assaults female incident in 2017 saw a contract with Irish province Connacht torn up.\", \"Had he gone and played the way he has that has seen him be a regular on the try-scoring charts in Super Rugby, it is highly likely that he would be eligible for a green jersey right now after a three-year residency.\", \"The All Blacks will go in as favourites, but there is an air of mystery over this test after Ireland's demolition of Japan last weekend.\", \"The Irish will still need all their key players to have their best games of the year all at the same time, but the All Blacks will be very mindful that is exactly what happened the last time they went to Dublin.\"]","href_hash":"026865c844b711ecaa219b396d754047"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"026865c844b711ecaa219b396d754047"}},
