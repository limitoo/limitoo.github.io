The International Criminal Court, which the U.S. is not part of, has a track record of 10 convictions over two decades.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The first way that they can build it \\u2014 and it may be sufficient in this case \\u2014 they can look at the pattern of the attack,\\\" Stephen Rapp, a former U.S. ambassador at large for war crimes, told CBS News senior investigative correspondent Catherine Herridge.\\u00a0\", \"Rapp, who has built cases against dictators and sought accountability for genocide, said Putin would be seen as \\\"an international pariah\\\" if there is a war crimes designation against him.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It also means that he can't travel anywhere, no more summits, because he'd be putting himself in danger,\\\" Rapp said.\\u00a0\", \"Securing justice in the court does not happen quickly.\\u00a0\", \"The court had to pull the arrest warrant for Libyan leader Muammar al-Gaddafi after he was executed by his own people.
