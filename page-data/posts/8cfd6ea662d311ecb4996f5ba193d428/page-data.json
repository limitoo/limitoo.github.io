We of course looked at all the options,\\\" Silver says.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Frankly we're having trouble coming up with what the logic would be pausing right now.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We're finding ourselves where we knew we would get to - that this virus will not be eradicated and we're going to have to live with it\\\".\", \"Silver says 90 percent of the current NBA cases are the omicron variant.\\u00a0\", \"He says public health officials and other leagues have been consulted constantly as the league shapes its daily assessment of risk.\", \"\\\"It's not just our doctors but the medical community.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"They're already realizing you can move away from the 10-day protocol when you have players that are vaccinated\\\".\", \"Several Bulls' players among the 10 shut down by positive tests this month said they felt fine and were essentially asymptomatic.\\u00a0\", \"Bulls guard DeMar DeRozan said his only symptom after testing positive was \\\"boredom.\\\"\", \"Silver says data points to vaccination and booster compliance as the reasons why.\", \"\\\"We have a lot of data we look at in terms of players and coaches that have gone through the three-shot protocol - two MRNA shots and then a booster.\", \"\\\"Only a very small number of those people have been breakthrough cases where they turn positive. And essentially, they've been asymptomatic.\", \"\\\"I would just say to our community, to everyone, at least based on the data the NBA has, the boosters are highly effective.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We strongly encourage everyone to get them. Our league is around 97 percent vaccinated. We're up to about 65 percent boosted.\", \"\\\"We do think there's an opportunity to potentially lead here. Maybe we can demonstrate there's a way that people can move forward,\\\" Silver says.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Again, recognizing this virus unfortunately isn't going anywhere and is going to be part of our lives for the foreseeable future.\\\"\", \"There are contingencies at the ready and activation could come quickly if a rash of positive tests takes out multiple teams ahead of the marquee date on the NBA regular-season calendar: Christmas Day.\", \"\\\"We'd need to talk for a few hours to talk about the contingencies,\\\" Silver says.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Beginning from the day we initially shut down the league in March of 2020, we've done nothing but look at contingencies. So of course, we always have those.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"But at least as of now our plan is to move forward with not only the Christmas Day games but there are roughly 23 games scheduled between now and Christmas.\\\"\", \"Silver says every day the NBA gets overnight testing results, looks at rosters and considers what the \\\"right and responsible\\\" thing to do taking all factors into consideration is to continue to play.\\u00a0\", \"More intense testing will take place starting after Christmas.\", \"\\\"It's only that we're shifting to a different protocol post-Christmas, and that plan had been in place for several weeks.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Same with the rest of the country. I've read something that roughly a third of the country travels for the holiday break.\\\"\", \"Reuters.\", \"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"8cfd6ea662d311ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8cfd6ea662d311ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
