Police confiscated several blank vaccination cards from him and initiated criminal proceedings.\", \" It wasn't immediately clear what impact the approximately 90 shots of COVID-19 vaccines, which were from different brands, had on the man's health.\", \" German police have conducted many raids in connection with forgery of vaccination passports in recent months. Many COVID-19 deniers refuse to get vaccinated in Germany but at the same time want to have the coveted COVID-19 passports that make access to public life and venues such as restaurants, theaters, swimming pools or workplaces much easier.\", \" Germany has seen high infection numbers for weeks, yet many measures to rein in the pandemic ended on Friday. Donning masks is no longer compulsory in grocery stores and most theaters but it is still mandatory on public transportation.\", \" In most schools in Germany, students also no longer have to wear masks, which has led teachers' associations to warn of possible conflicts in class.\", \" \\\"There is now a danger that, on the one hand, children who wear masks will be teased by classmates as wimps and overprotective or, on the other hand, pressure will be exerted on non-mask wearers,\\\" Heinz-Peter Meidinger, the president of the German Teachers' Association, told dpa. He advocated a voluntary commitment by teachers and students to continue wearing masks in class and on school grounds, at least until the country goes on a two-week Easter holiday.\", \" Health experts say the most recent surge of infections in Germany - triggered by the BA.2 omicron subvariant- may have peaked.\", \" On Sunday, the country's disease control agency reported 74,053 new COVID-19 infections in one day, while less than a week ago it had reported 111,224 daily infections. \", \" Overall, Germany has registered 130,029 COVID-19 deaths.\"]","href_hash":"b942c798b3f711ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b942c798b3f711ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
