Now, I wonder how I can sit at Christmas or Easter lunch knowing the person passing the salt might have thought it was reasonable to leave me in the wilderness during an international crisis.\", \"How are returning Australians supposed to buy a round for old mates who barely made a peep as we lost loved ones, life savings and health without access to home? I wonder whether we can feel truly secure among our compatriots or in our Australian citizenship ever again.\", \"My countrymen's support of Australia's border policies, or silence in the face of their impact, has been traumatising and I am struggling with the consequences of that unacknowledged trauma.\", \"Australia, I believe, needs a reckoning \\u2013 and much of it will be done within the family unit.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Deciding to stay put</div>\", \"I am not one of the unlucky Australians who got stuck while visiting loved ones overseas or caught by cancellations when flight caps were imposed. I chose to stay in Germany when the pandemic broke out.\", \"I'd just returned to Berlin after visiting Australia and was offered a job that could not be matched back home. Even as the pandemic began ravaging Europe in early 2020, I believed I'd have more stability in Germany.\", \"Returning to Australia would have meant living with my family on the Sunshine Coast \\u2014 something I hadn't done in more than a decade \\u2014 while trying to find employment during a crisis.\", \"I knew Australia's border restrictions were tough, but I wasn't outraged in the early days. I was accepting and \\u2013 dare I say it \\u2013 proud that Australia seemed to be dealing with the virus better than many countries. This was a once-in a-lifetime public health emergency. I could cop the sacrifice while the government put in place safe and reasonable pathways for return.\", \"The problem is, it never really did.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Alarm bells start to ring</div>\", \"My sad acceptance of border restrictions turned into loud alarm bells in April this year when Australians in India were told they would face jail if they tried to return home amid one of the world's most lethal outbreaks.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/6d54af4aa2bb27d6d00ee71d86f2019e\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> \\\"The pandemic and Australia\\u2019s response to it has warped my sense of nationality, likely irrevocably,\\\" Rebekah says.\\u00a0(Supplied: Rebekah Ison)</div>\", \"Then I started looking into what it would take to get home. What I found was a minefield of ever-changing bureaucracy, unaffordable plane tickets, cancellations, and expensive hotel quarantine. My conclusion was that returning home was just not going to be possible for me.\", \"And it seemed many Australians thought our \\\"strong borders\\\" were not inhumane, but reasonable. The Australia Talks survey found in March this year\\u00a079 per cent of Australians thought the international border should stay shut.\", \"Even after Delta had taken hold in Victoria and NSW, fully vaccinated Australians were treated as a threat. They were met with hostility or told\\u00a0\\\"you decided to stay there\\\" or \\\"you've had plenty of time to come home\\\".\", \"My immediate family has been empathetic, but some close members have also said they can see both sides.\", \"I have struggled to reconcile how my family can say they want me home but not speak out against border measures or write to an MP to protest. I don't understand how they can't see that not getting involved is a vote for the status quo.\", \"There are things I can't expect my family in Queensland to truly understand. They don't know what it's like to spend every day for more than a year stalked by serious illness. Most Australians, and certainly Queenslanders where COVID-19 has had relatively little impact, don't know what it's like to try to dodge COVID outbreaks popping up like spot fires among friends and colleagues.\", \"But I'm not the only one wrestling with these feelings. Many Australians overseas feel misunderstood and invalidated by their friends and family back home.\", \"I often feel that some Australians see me as a traitor deserving of limited rights for choosing to weather the pandemic in another country where I had a home and a job.\", \"After such different pandemic experiences, I wonder whether my loved ones and I can ever truly understand each other on this issue.
