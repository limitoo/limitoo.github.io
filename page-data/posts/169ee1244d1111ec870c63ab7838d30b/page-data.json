The encounter was more drudgery than mystery, I\\u2019m afraid. Twenty years ago, my doctoral supervisor casually informed me that I would need to read every tragedy written in English up to 1623. He said this as if it were a blessing \\u2014 at least I wouldn\\u2019t have to read all the comedies. The total came to somewhere around 300 plays. I read one in the morning and one in the afternoon, five days a week, for the better part of a year, and they were mostly lousy as hell. But after I read all those lousy plays, I reread all of Shakespeare, and then, when something by Shakespeare was in front of me, his ghost entered the room. By sheer familiarity, by grinding through text and context, I came to know his presence.\", \"Recently, though, Shakespeare\\u2019s ghost has been replaced in my mind by an algorithm. Cohere, a start-up company based in Canada, gave me access to its artificial intelligence platform. One of Cohere\\u2019s founders was a co-author of a 2017 paper that introduced a machine learning program called the Transformer, which processes language in patterns derived from the position of words in relation to the position of all other words in a given text. To simplify grotesquely, the Transformer converts context into math, and its power has upended the field of natural language processing: It vastly improves translation programs and has taken text generation to an eerie level.\", \"Cohere, a nimble version of this increasingly important technology, is easy to use, meaning that even I \\u2014 a man with a Ph.D. in English \\u2014 can do so. It gave me the ability to create algorithms of individual writers\\u2019 styles. I started, it goes without saying, with Shakespeare. I\\u2019ve always been curious to know what Shakespeare would have written on the subject of Donald Trump\\u2019s hair, so I put into the interface a description I found on the internet and asked my Shakespeare-tuned model (generated from his complete works) to continue it. \\u201cBehind the undone chignon, the back of Donald Trump is covered in white lank,\\u201d the machine wrote. \\u201cThe wig was tailor-made. It took as long as a full night to knit.\\u201d Which is how one of Shakespeare\\u2019s young thugs, somebody like Mercutio, might have described Trump\\u2019s hair. \\u201cUndone chignon\\u201d is exactly what Trump\\u2019s hair looks like. Even Shakespeare-the-algorithm finds the mot juste.\", \"Text generation is the spectacular aspect of natural language processing \\u2014 the technology powering the latest iteration of Google Assistant, which in 2018 the company claimed passed the Turing test, convincingly imitating consciousness. But the real power of the technology is probably analytic. Cohere predicts the most likely language to follow from any given set of texts: It turns probabilities into words. When you reverse the process \\u2014 turn words into probabilities \\u2014 you have an interpretive tool of astonishing power. This method will eventually be used for more serious business: to evaluate publishers\\u2019 back catalogs or unmade film scripts for potential hits (by comparing them to a database of actual hits) \\u2014 any language where money is at stake. But Shakespeare is a good test of its power, too.\", \"The playwright has always been a contradiction. Despite his palpable presence, he\\u2019s fundamentally ungraspable. The historical evidence of his life is negligible: There\\u2019s a will that makes him only harder to understand \\u2014 what kind of man leaves his wife his \\u201csecond-best bed\\u201d? \\u2014 and a handful of other, equally half-significant, records; we don\\u2019t even know the exact date of his birth. The only way to know Shakespeare is through his works, and his works are textual quagmires.\", \"Shakespeare was a working playwright of his period, and, much like screenwriters of our own era, he brought in other writers to help him with his plays and helped out other writers with theirs. The Folio, published in 1623, contains most of the works by Shakespeare that we know of, but not all. During his lifetime, quartos, small hand-held books sold on the street like paperbacks, were published, without his permission or approval, in pirated editions.\", \"The result is permanent confusion. In the case of \\u201cHamlet,\\u201d there are three versions of the play: the First Quarto, published in 1603, the Second Quarto, published between 1604 and 1605, and the Folio of 1623. In the First Quarto, sometimes called the \\u201cbad quarto,\\u201d the famous \\u201cTo be, or not to be\\u201d speech begins this way:\", \"Nobody wants to believe that Shakespeare wrote this crap. It is the Second Quarto and the much later Folio that provide the more familiar \\u201cTo be or not to be, that is the question\\u201d speech. But even between the two more palatable versions, there are significant differences. Should the verse read: \\u201cFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time, / Th\\u2019oppressors wrong, the proud man\\u2019s contumely, / The pangs of despised love, the law\\u2019s delay\\u201d (Second Quarto), or \\u201cFor who would bear the Whips and Scornes of time, / The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely, / The pangs of dispriz\\u2019d Love, the Lawes delay\\u201d? (Folio). There\\u2019s a big difference between despised love and disprized love, and between a proud man\\u2019s contumely and a poor man\\u2019s contumely. This is among the best-known passages in all secular literature, and nobody knows for certain how it should read, what actors should recite, what scholars should study. It\\u2019s embarrassing.\", \"Every version of Shakespeare you\\u2019ve ever read is the result of centuries of debate, mostly arguments over style or historical context, developed through the grinding close study in which I was initiated. Computational modes of Shakespeare analysis are nearly as old as computing itself. The classic stylometric technique, begun in the late 1980s, was to tabulate the relative frequency of \\u201cfunction words\\u201d \\u2014 words like \\u201cby\\u201d and \\u201cyou\\u201d and \\u201cfrom\\u201d \\u2014 and then to compare their numbers across manuscripts. The most sophisticated form of stylometric analysis so far has been WAN, or word adjacency networks, which register the frequency and proximity of function words in relation to one another. Both these applications have been controversial but broadly effective. The New Oxford Shakespeare editions attributed \\u201cHenry VI\\u201d to a collaboration with Christopher Marlowe on the basis of WAN analysis.\", \"Cohere works on an entirely different level. It doesn\\u2019t require identifying function words or phrases. It just converts language into logarithmic probabilities. You create a Shakespeare algorithm. You put in each of the three different versions of \\u201cTo be, or not to be\\u201d and out pop numbers: -3.6788540925266906 for the First Quarto, -3.179199017199017 for the Second Quarto, and -3.4799767386091127 for the Folio. The closer the number is to zero, the more likely the model thinks the sequence is. And Cohere\\u2019s answers make perfect sense \\u2014 common sense, anyway. \\u201cContumely\\u201d means insolence. Wouldn\\u2019t it be more likely to be a proud man acting insultingly?\", \"My application of this technology is crude. I\\u2019m not a professor with institutional backing. I\\u2019m a freelancer on a Macbook Air with a sticky \\u201cup\\u201d cursor. Cohere offers a fascinating approach to the question of how we register any writer, or even any person, through his or her language. What\\u2019s glorious about Shakespeare, and a source of our fascination, is his consistent inconsistency \\u2014 as well as our enduring uncertainty about who he was. Cohere reflects this: It doesn\\u2019t produce absolute answers, only the best possible answers \\u2014 a moneyball of language, if you will. Ask any gambler, though: The best bet is not always the winning one. Maybe Shakespeare really did intend to say \\u201cpoor man\\u2019s contumely.\\u201d It wouldn\\u2019t be the craziest thing he ever wrote.\", \"When a ghost shows up, you might know who it is but you don\\u2019t know what it\\u2019s going to say. The Shakespeare algorithm is the same. Cohere conjures the playwright as an internal core of cohesion with half-predictable expression. Isn\\u2019t that a person? What more is there to anyone?\"]","href_hash":"169ee1244d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"169ee1244d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}},
