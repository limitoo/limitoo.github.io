About 40 staff were in the garden, including Johnson and his partner Carrie, even though restrictions at the time meant only two people from separate households could mix outdoors.\", \"Further parties were also reportedly held throughout 2020 and one even took place the day before Prince Philip's funeral on April 17 last year.\", \"Sky News presenter Trevor Phillips became emotional while interviewing Conservative Party chairman and minister without portfolio Oliver Dowden on Sunday as he told him how his daughter died while isolating at home the same weekend a Downing Street party was held.\", \"\\\"Let's go back to that April 17-18 weekend, and I just want to say something about what I did during that week and other people will have exactly the same story. That week I saw my two daughters at various times outside - one was pregnant, one was very ill. Their mother, stepmother and I weren't allowed to meet them together. We all stuck to the spirit and the letter of the rules,\\\" Phillips told his guest.\", \"\\\"On the Saturday, after watching the funeral of Prince Philip, I went to one of my friends' 70th birthday parties. He hired a tent - he's got loads of friends, but he's hired a tent for just six of us so we could sit outside - he stuck to the spirit and the letter of the rules. And at dinner I get a call, my daughter's collapsed, and as you will know, for months she'd been isolated, she was ill.\", \"\\\"By the following morning she had died and she had stuck to the spirit and letter of the rules, and there are going to be thousands of people who have that story in their background and, if I may say so, you are in here telling me about a civil servant's inquiry, that will not answer that anger.\\\"\", \"Dowden acknowledged Phillips' daughter's death and how much he's \\\"suffered\\\" following this.\", \"\\\"I know how much so many people in this country have suffered, the privations they have been subject to, the steadfastness with which people obeyed the rules and it is totally wrong if there has been any way in which, and we have seen some examples of this, those rules have not been fully obeyed in Downing Street,\\\" Dowden said.\", \"Moments later, in an interview with shadow health secretary Wes Streeting, Phillips apologised, saying: \\\"I apologise to viewers if I brought something personal into this discussion, let's try and keep above that.\\\"\", \"But Streeting said he didn't believe Phillips needed to say sorry.\", \"\\\"By the way, Trevor, I don't think you should apologise for talking about your personal pain because millions of people up and down the country are having the same conversation.\\\"\", \"Until last week, Johnson repeatedly denied there were any illegal gatherings at 10 Downing Street during the lockdown months. He claimed he thought the gathering was a worked event and he has since apologised.\", \"\\\"I have learned enough to know that there were things we simply did not get right,\\\" he said on Wednesday.\\u00a0\", \"The partygate scandal has prompted calls for Johnson to resign immediately, including from those within his party.\"]","href_hash":"81816ee0773e11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"81816ee0773e11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
