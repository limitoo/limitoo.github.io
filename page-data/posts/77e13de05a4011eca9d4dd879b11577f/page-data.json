It's a failure of imagination, and I wrote after January 6 that one of the findings ... of the 9/11 Commission was a failure of imagination,\\\" she told Geist.\", \"\\\"There is no sense of duty or honor on the part of many of the people who worked for Trump. They don't want to cooperate, probably they're complicitous in some way and they don't want that to be proven, but I am very worried, and it didn't end with his defeat.\\\"\", \"In the past, Clinton has been particularly critical of Republican politicians who had worked alongside her during her time as senator, such as Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Clinton stated in 2019 that Graham had had a \\\"brain snatch\\\" and said it was a \\\"fair question\\\" when she was asked if he had hold his soul to the devil.\", \"The former secretary of state also outlined a plan for Geist that she said would help Democrats maintain their congressional control into the 2022 midterm elections.\", \"\\\"It is a time for some careful thinking about what wins elections, and not just in deep blue districts where a Democrat ... is going to win,\\\" Clinton stated. \\\"I understand why people want to argue for their priorities, that's what they believe they were elected to do, but at the end of the day, nothing is going to get done if you don't have a Democratic majority.\\\"\", \"Clinton's interview comes just days after she released a short clip showing her reading an excerpt from the 2016 victory speech that she would've given had she beaten Trump.\", \"During that reading, a visibly emotional Clinton stated that she hoped the speech would encapsulate \\\"the kind of country that I want for the world.\\\"\", \"\\\"My fellow Americans, today you sent a message to the whole world: Our values endure. Our democracy stands strong,\\\" she read.\", \"\\\"Fundamentally, this election challenged us to decide what it means to be an American in the 21st century.
