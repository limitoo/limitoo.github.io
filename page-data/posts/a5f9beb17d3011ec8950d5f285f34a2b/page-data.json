Foley being \\\"reluctant to work with the Consumer Product Safety Commission\\\" over a recall of its treadmills was listed as another misstep.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We believe that no board exercising reasonable judgment could leave Mr. Foley in charge of Peloton,\\\" wrote Jason Aintabi, chief investment officer at Blackwells.\", \"Peloton did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\u00a0\", \"Aintabi could well be waging an uphill battle, as Foley and other insiders yielded control of more than 80% of Peloton's voting power as of Sept. 30, according to a proxy filing.\\u00a0\", \"Shares of Peloton were up more than 5% in early trade Monday.
