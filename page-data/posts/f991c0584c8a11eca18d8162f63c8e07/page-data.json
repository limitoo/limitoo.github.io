On her new solo album she struggles to sustain the long, lush lines of \\u201cEs gibt ein Reich,\\u201d from \\u201cAriadne auf Naxos\\u201d; soft phrases waver in \\u201cRitorna vincitor\\u201d (\\u201cAida\\u201d) and \\u201cWhen I am laid in earth\\u201d (\\u201cDido and Aeneas\\u201d); \\u201cUn bel d\\u00ec,\\u201d from \\u201cMadama Butterfly,\\u201d is shaky from start to finish; high notes are difficult throughout. She endures \\u201cEinsam in tr\\u00fcben Tagen\\u201d (\\u201cLohengrin\\u201d) with steely determination, and the exuberant \\u201cDich, teure Halle\\u201d (\\u201cTannh\\u00e4user\\u201d) similarly seems to press her to her limits.\", \"But there is still time for Netrebko, 50, to do a staged \\u201cQueen of Spades,\\u201d excerpted with focused passion here. And the \\u201cLiebestod\\u201d from \\u201cTristan und Isolde,\\u201d while audibly challenging for her, is movingly \\u2014 and, at moments, ecstatically \\u2014 negotiated. Given a meaty stretch to shine in the \\u201cTristan\\u201d prelude, the orchestra of the Teatro alla Scala, under its music director, Riccardo Chailly, is otherwise mellow and very much in the background. \\u201cSola, perduta, abbandonata\\u201d (\\u201cManon Lescaut\\u201d) and especially \\u201cTu che le vanit\\u00e0\\u201d (\\u201cDon Carlo\\u201d) convey, with generous, fiery, largely secure singing, the urgency of Netrebko\\u2019s best live performances. ZACHARY WOOLFE\", \"Recorded in a Paris church days after a lockdown in France ended last December, this moving release of Bach cantatas and Handel arias is surely one of the most affecting albums to emerge from the pandemic. Opening with the soprano Sabine Devieilhe and the lutenist Thomas Dunford bewailing Christ\\u2019s agonies on the cross in the song \\u201cMein Jesu! was vor Seelenweh,\\u201d and ending in a blaze of trumpet-topped praise with the \\u201cAlleluja\\u201d that concludes the cantata \\u201cJauchzet Gott in allen Landen,\\u201d the album\\u2019s narrative arc \\u2014 from sinfulness and repentance to faith and joy \\u2014 is immensely satisfying.\", \"Much of that is because of the supreme detailing that Pichon (Devieilhe\\u2019s husband) draws from his starry ensemble Pygmalion, including the benediction that Dunford wraps around Cleopatra in \\u201cPianger\\u00f2,\\u201d the second of her laments from \\u201cGiulio Cesare\\u201d; Matthieu Boutineau\\u2019s feistily impulsive organ solo in the sinfonia from \\u201cWir m\\u00fcssen durch viel Tr\\u00fcbsal\\u201d; and the ethereal, almost cleansing violin of Sophie Gent in \\u201cTu del Ciel ministro eletto,\\u201d the heart-stopping plea for mercy from \\u201cIl Trionfo del Tempo e del Disinganno.\\u201d Devieilhe is at the core of it all, wielding her voice with flashing sharpness one moment, crushing tenderness the next. DAVID ALLEN\", \"Brahms had all but decided to retire from composing when, in the early 1890s, he became friendly with the clarinetist Richard M\\u00fchlfeld and was inspired to write a series of major works, including two clarinet sonatas that have long been mainstays of the repertory.\", \"Anthony McGill, the New York Philharmonic\\u2019s principal clarinet, and the splendid pianist Gloria Chien offer vibrant and insightful performances of the sonatas on their new album. These works, like much of late Brahms, can come across as weighty and thick-textured, but this duo brings wonderful transparency to the scores. Even in dark, stormy episodes, McGill and Chien play with unforced fervor and eloquence.\", \"Particularly impressive is the way they convey the coherence of the final movement of the second sonata, written as a theme and variations \\u2014 music that often seems awkwardly intricate, with curious turns and twists. The album also includes a glowing account of Jessie Montgomery\\u2019s mellow \\u201cPeace,\\u201d as well as an ebullient, dazzling yet unshowy performance of Weber\\u2019s virtuosic Grand Duo Concertant, which here sounds aptly grand. ANTHONY TOMMASINI\", \"The Attacca Quartet\\u2019s name comes from the musical term for playing without a pause. And the group seems to be taking that literally: Their new album, \\u201cOf All Joys,\\u201d is their second this year after releasing their Sony Classical debut, \\u201cReal Life,\\u201d in July.\", \"\\u201cReal Life\\u201d was a shot of adrenaline, an electronic dance record that remixed music by the likes of Flying Lotus and took a refreshingly broad view of the string quartet form. \\u201cOf All Joys\\u201d \\u2014 a juxtaposition of Renaissance arrangements and contemporary works by Arvo P\\u00e4rt and Philip Glass \\u2014 couldn\\u2019t be more different, yet its conceptual swerve from \\u201cReal Life\\u201d is fitting for an ensemble equally comfortable in Haydn and Caroline Shaw.\", \"Glass\\u2019s \\u201cMishima\\u201d Quartet is the only proper string quartet on the new album, which takes its title from a line in the John Dowland song \\u201cFlow My Tears.\\u201d The rest is adaptation \\u2014 an insistence on the elasticity of music, borne out with rich, organ-like sonorities in pieces like the Dowland or John Bennet\\u2019s \\u201cWeep, O Mine Eyes.\\u201d\", \"With a teeming \\u201cMishima\\u201d at its heart, the album is also a testament to how few ingredients are needed to inspire emotional intensity \\u2014 as in the players\\u2019 sudden shifts, during that quartet\\u2019s final movement, between churning arpeggios and streaks of lyricism. At the end of P\\u00e4rt\\u2019s frosty \\u201cFratres,\\u201d you might find yourself trying to reconcile the album\\u2019s title with its solemn sound world. But perhaps joy is something beyond mood; it may simply lie in the making of, and listening to, music. JOSHUA BARONE\", \"Not many artists would place Mussorgsky, Debussy, Jennifer Higdon and Anthony Davis on the same album. But the pianist Stewart Goodyear intriguingly locates in all of them \\u2014 as well as in two pieces by Goodyear himself, inspired by his Trinidadian roots \\u2014 the fundamental influence of Liszt.\", \"Goodyear\\u2019s playing here has both virtuosic flash and deeply considered feeling. When approaching Davis\\u2019s \\u201cMiddle Passage\\u201d \\u2014 after the poem of the same name by Robert Hayden \\u2014 he handles the more improvisatory sections with a pugilistic force indebted to Davis\\u2019s own 1980s reading on the Gramavision label. But Goodyear also treats Davis with a meditative touch that calls to mind the lush rendition of \\u201cMiddle Passage\\u201d recorded by Ursula Oppens, who commissioned the piece.\", \"The final line of Hayden\\u2019s poem, \\u201cVoyage through death to life upon these shores,\\u201d gives a sense of the emotional range of the rest of the album. Selections from Debussy gambol and ruminate; Higdon\\u2019s \\u201cSecret and Glass Gardens\\u201d moves from a guarded interiority to brash, attention-grabbing declarations. And Goodyear\\u2019s performance of Mussorgsky\\u2019s \\u201cPictures at an Exhibition\\u201d likewise covers much ground, including a delightful \\u201cBallet of Unhatched Chicks\\u201d and a stately \\u201cGreat Gate of Kiev.\\u201d SETH COLTER WALLS\"]","href_hash":"f991c0584c8a11eca18d8162f63c8e07"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f991c0584c8a11eca18d8162f63c8e07"}},
