There are no mass vaccination sites. Pediatricians are being enlisted to help work with parents. The vials \\u2014 and the needles to administer doses \\u2014 will be smaller.\", \"Schools like Franklin Sherman Elementary, which is hosting its own vaccination clinic, will be central to the effort. By spotlighting the school, the White House hopes to offer the public a reminder of an earlier era when the country pulled together to fight a terrifying disease. (Among those who contracted polio is Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, who walks with a slight limp as a result.)\", \"The school and its \\u201cpolio pioneer\\u201d students are mindful of their place in history; one of them, Jackie Lonergan, now 75, told The Washington Post that parents did not question whether their children should get the experimental vaccine developed by Jonas Salk. (In a rare interview in 1993, Dr. Salk told a reporter that his vaccine had offered \\u201cfreedom from fear.\\u201d)\", \"Public health experts view vaccinating young children against the coronavirus as a critical step toward bringing the pandemic under control. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children ages 5 to 11 at the end of October, and last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention followed suit by endorsing the recommendation.\", \"But persuading parents to get their children vaccinated has sometimes been difficult, even when the children are older. In more rural and conservative areas of the country, school officials are treading lightly in promoting the vaccine.\", \"A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation published last month before the F.D.A.\\u2019s action, found that 27 percent of parents said they would \\u201cdefinitely not\\u201d get their 5-to-11-year-olds vaccinated against the coronavirus. An additional 33 percent said they would \\u201cwait and see\\u201d how the vaccine was working before getting their children the shots.\", \"White House officials say that Dr. Biden will continue to visit pediatric vaccination clinics across the country in the coming weeks. On Monday morning, Xavier Becerra, the secretary of health and human services, and Miguel Cardona, the education secretary, sent a letter to to school superintendents and elementary school principals across the country urging them to encourage childhood vaccination, including by holding clinics.\", \"\\u201cThis is a very exciting development and a significant opportunity to protect some of our youngest learners and our communities,\\u201d they wrote.\"]","href_hash":"f22bc17840a611eca349312d5990ed4d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f22bc17840a611eca349312d5990ed4d"}},
