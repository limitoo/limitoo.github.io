Mr Trudeau responded by accusing the NDP's climate policies as being lacklustre. \", \"Mr Singh, leader of a left-wing party vying to be a progressive alternative for Liberal voters, was the one who most frequently hammered away at the prime minister, accusing him of failing to deliver on his promises.\", \"The fast-paced format and crowded stage meant there was little sustained back-and-forth, but all the leaders managed to land a few jabs.\", \"Pressed by Conservatives' leader Erin O'Toole on why he has not taken a tougher tone on China, Mr Trudeau snapped that \\\"you do not simply lob tomatoes across the Pacific\\\" when trying to solve geopolitical issues. \", \"He also continued to be pressed on his decision to call a snap election two years ahead of schedule in the hopes of securing a majority - an issue that has dogged him since the election call.  \", \"Polls suggest his Liberals are stuck roughly in the same place they were in late 2019, the last time Canadians voted federally, when he ended up with a minority government. \", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">O'Toole makes a big tent pitch</div>\", \"The Conservative leader's opening pitch was directed squarely at progressive and centrist voters who might be considering his party. \", \"\\\"I'm a pro-choice ally to the LGBT community,\\\" Mr O'Toole said. \\\"Our platform, includes a detailed plan on climate change.\\\"\", \"In the 2019 election, the Conservatives struggled with social and environmental issues.

Ms Paul - the first black and Jewish woman to lead a national party - took issue with comments Mr Blanchet made about systemic racism, saying she had previously invited him to \\\"get educated\\\" on the topic. \", \"When he took offence at her response, she countered \\\"it was not an insult, it was an invitation to educate yourself\\\".\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Green party makes its pitch </div>\", \"The two televised debates this week were a chance for Ms Paul to make an impression on voters. Recently elected to lead the Greens, she has faced internal party turmoil that has threatened to derail the party's national campaign and her place at the helm. \", \"Ms Paul has focused most of her efforts on winning a seat in a Toronto riding that has been a Liberal stronghold in recent years. The Greens held two seats in the House of Commons at dissolution but have struggled to make any real impact in national opinion polls. \", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/5DA0/production/_120486932_ask_canada_generic-2x-nc.png' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Ask Canada</div>\", \"We spoke to some voters before the debate to see what they felt was at stake in this election.

Every spend they make pushes us further in a debt crisis, and pushes more debt onto our kids. \", \"Matt Deeming, 29, from Surrey, British Columbia \", \"This election is about Canada's recovery from the pandemic.
