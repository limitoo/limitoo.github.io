And they always kind of say, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019ll come to your videos when I feel down,\\u2019\\u201d said Caitlin Galamaga, 24, who posts videos on YouTube and TikTok in which she listens to pop music and talks about her life for more than 160,000 subscribers.\", \"Fans are looking for creators \\u201cwho just really give off that cozy vibe,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s like cozy energy around them, and they make you feel comfortable.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Galamaga recently posted a clip listing her own favorite \\u201ccomfort content,\\u201d which included traditional standbys \\u2014 TV shows like \\u201cThe Office\\u201d and \\u201cThe New Girl\\u201d \\u2014 alongside popular streamers like JackSepticEye and Valkyrae, who often record themselves playing video games.\", \"Not all YouTubers scratch the comfort creator itch, according to Ms. Galamaga. \\u201cYour favorite creators might be people whose content you really enjoyed, but your comfort creator would be more like your go-to when you\\u2019re feeling down,\\u201d she said. They\\u2019re \\u201cthe people who pull you out of like that sad place and give you some inspiration, some hope and some joy.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s a new twist on an age-old phenomenon: Relaxing has always been one of the primary reasons people read, watch TV or consume media of any kind.\", \"The deprivations of the last 18 months have left people of all ages seeking mental salvation from their media diet. In a July 2020 New York magazine article titled \\u201cWelcome to Peak Comfort TV,\\u201d Kathryn Van ArenDonck described how pandemic-era audiences were turning away from brutal prestige dramas like \\u201cBreaking Bad,\\u201d and toward lighthearted fare like \\u201cAvatar: The Last Airbender\\u201d and \\u201cFloor Is Lava,\\u201d a goofy game show.\", \"\\u201cWith the terror of a global pandemic sending anxiety sky high and rendering TV one of the few safe entertainment outlets, the desire for comfort has become particularly noticeable,\\u201d she wrote.\", \"This television dynamic also exists among young viewers; Gen Z\\u2019s obsession with \\u201cThe Office\\u201d is well documented. But for many young people, TV doesn\\u2019t offer the same level of intimacy as digital content creators, many of whom pump out hours of content every day while interacting directly with their viewers on social media and in the comments section of their streams.\", \"\\u201cTo me, a \\u2018comfort creator\\u2019 is someone whose content brings people comfort, peace, relaxation or other feelings of happiness,\\u201d Alayna Saunders, 21, a student at James Madison University, wrote in an email. \\u201cBy watching a video, you are able to take your mind off of whatever may be occupying it and change the emotional environment you are in.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Saunders said that her favorite comfort creators are a YouTuber duo called the Game Grumps and another named Vinny Vinesauce, and that she\\u2019ll put on their old videos as \\u201ccalming background noise\\u201d while doing other things. For her, the familiarity is the appeal. \\u201cI love Vinny and the Grumps partly because I know what to expect from them. I understand their humor and how they work,\\u201d she wrote.\", \"Young fans describe their comfort creators as akin to emotional security blankets. Fin, a 16-year-old high school student from Georgia, wrote in a Twitter message that the videos made by popular Minecraft YouTubers including Quackity and Dream have offered a lifeline \\u201cwhen I\\u2019m not in the best place mentally.\\u201d\", \"Hosannah, 16, a high school student in Florida, said that watching her comfort creator \\u2014 a YouTuber called Jschlatt \\u2014 helped her navigate through some dark times.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s an amazing distraction and I became very thankful for that distraction after coming out of a very abusive relationship,\\u201d she wrote in an email. \\u201cI became almost attached to him when I had no one else to go to. He makes me feel safe and not have to think about some of the traumatic things I\\u2019ve gone through.\\u201d\", \"There have been extensive discussions of the topic of mental health among many content creators. It follows, then, for young people to conceive of their relationships with these creators in mental health terms. \\u201cI see a lot of YouTubers being incredibly open about where they are mentally, the things that they\\u2019re going through,\\u201d Ms. Galamaga said. \\u201cAnd I think it makes everybody feel a little more comfortable talking about it.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cComfort shows, you know, you feel connected to characters, but they\\u2019re not real,\\u201d Ms. Galamaga said. \\u201cWhereas when you have content creators, they\\u2019re real people, and they tend to be a little more open about how they\\u2019re feeling and you feel connected to them on a personal level.\\u201d\", \"Shelby Renae, 24, a content creator with 1.3 million subscribers on TikTok, wrote in an email that fans often call her their comfort creator. She believes livestreams offer an especially effective way for young viewers to form the kind of so-called parasocial relationships that so many viewers crave, leading to feelings of ease.\", \"\\u201cMany livestreams are cozy and comforting, especially since it typically is for many hours and you get to see someone just chilling a lot of the time,\\u201d she wrote. She cited the rise of low-key streaming formats like \\u201cmukbangs or relaxing podcasts, which can again give that feeling of relaxing with a friend.\\u201d\", \"Over the years she\\u2019s spent as a creator, Ms. Renae has leaned in to her fans\\u2019 desire for low-impact streaming. \\u201cI\\u2019ve learned that not every moment needs to be high action and hilarious to a true supporter, and that they will watch when you\\u2019re really just being you,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cIt can feel like the presence of a familiar friend without you having to put in the effort from your end.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9e384784510011ec84ad8b2c0031a03f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9e384784510011ec84ad8b2c0031a03f"}},
