He long insisted that the two men convicted with him were innocent.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-22T08:23:24.000Z","content":"[\"Waiting in the holding area of a Manhattan courthouse in 1966, Talmadge Hayer turned to the two men who were standing trial with him. He told them that he intended to confess to his role in the assassination of Malcolm X and make it clear that they were innocent.\", \"\\u201cI just want to tell the truth, that\\u2019s all,\\u201d he said when he took the stand.\", \"But the jury was not convinced. Mr. Hayer had told a different story earlier in the trial, and he still refused to name his co-conspirators or to say who they were working for. Eleven days later, the jury convicted all three men of first-degree murder.\", \"The other two men, known then as Norman 3X Butler and Thomas 15X Johnson, went down in history with Mr. Hayer as the assassins of an icon of the Civil Rights era. It would take 55 years to clear their names, and Mr. Johnson would not live to see his exoneration.\", \"The convictions of Mr. Butler and Mr. Johnson, who, while in prison changed their names to Muhammad A. Aziz and Khalil Islam, were thrown out in that same courthouse last week after a 22-month review of the case.\", \"But long before the new investigation that led to the exonerations, Mujahid Abdul Halim \\u2014 the name that Mr. Hayer later chose \\u2014 had insisted on the men\\u2019s innocence in an effort to set the record straight and to atone in some way for his role in a hugely consequential act of violence.\", \"Mr. Halim was released on parole in 2010. Now 80, he lives quietly in the Sunset Park neighborhood of Brooklyn, about five miles away from the courthouse that linked him inextricably to the two innocent men.\", \"He appears to keep a low profile. His name and a years-old photo of him were not recognized at a nearby Muslim community center and mosques in the area. At a barbershop, pharmacy and deli on Mr. Halim\\u2019s block, workers said they did not know him. And his wife said at their apartment that Mr. Halim was reluctant to be interviewed.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know why he wouldn\\u2019t want to,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut I think there\\u2019s a lot of people that really still feel differently about some things and maybe even about him.\\u201d\", \"Two days earlier, a man answering to Mr. Halim\\u2019s name had responded only briefly to the news that Mr. Aziz and Mr. Islam would have their convictions thrown out.\", \"\\u201cGod bless you, they\\u2019re exonerated,\\u201d he said through a closed door.\", \"Mr. Halim was 23, a follower of the Black nationalist group the Nation of Islam and a member of its Newark mosque in 1964, when, he said in an affidavit years later, two men brought him into their car on a street in downtown Paterson, N.J., to discuss killing Malcolm X.\", \"Malcolm X had spent 12 years in the Nation of Islam, rising rapidly to its top ranks as it expanded. But in 1964, fissures between him and the sect\\u2019s leader, Elijah Muhammad, widened into a messy split. Mr. Muhammad privately seemed to imply that he should be executed, according to Federal Bureau of Investigation files. And two months before the killing, Minister Louis Farrakhan wrote in the Nation\\u2019s official newspaper that Malcolm, his former mentor, was worthy of death.\", \"So when Mr. Halim was approached in Paterson, his deep religious zeal led him to believe he was being tested, he told Peter Goldman, a journalist who interviewed him in prison for a biography of Malcolm X.\", \"\\u201cI just believed, man. And I was the type of person that if I had to stand up for what I believe, I would do it,\\u201d Mr. Halim told Mr. Goldman.\", \"In an affidavit, Mr. Halim recalled the planning of the assassination.\", \"\\u201cWe met a few times to discuss how to carry out this killing,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cSometimes we talked while driving around.\\u201d\", \"In the affidavit, he also identified the other men he said were involved in the plot: Leon Davis, Benjamin Thomas and two men whose full names he did not know, \\u201cWilliam X\\u201d and a man who went by \\u201cWilbur or Kinly.\\u201d\", \"They decided against targeting the civil rights leader\\u2019s home, which was heavily guarded, and settled instead on the Audubon Ballroom in uptown Manhattan, casing it the night before the assassination.\", \"On Feb. 21, 1965, as Malcolm X was about to deliver a speech at the ballroom outlining a new anti-racist movement focused on Black empowerment, Mr. Halim was one of three men who rose after a brief distraction and opened fire. In the chaos that followed, Mr. Halim was shot in the leg and apprehended.\", \"The other shooters, including the man who fired the fatal shotgun blast, escaped; within 10 days, Mr. Aziz and Mr. Islam, Nation of Islam enforcers who were out on bail on charges that they had beaten up a defector from the group, were arrested. (None of the co-conspirators whom Mr. Halim identified later were ever charged with the crime, and all are believed to be dead.)\", \"Even as the trial approached, Mr. Halim did not expect his co-defendants to be found guilty.\", \"\\u201cI actually felt that the brothers would be cut loose,\\u201d he said years later in a prison interview with the journalist Tony Brown. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t think they were going to be convicted until this trial started going on, and it became obvious what was being done. And at that point I had to say something.\\u201d\", \"It did not matter. Despite Mr. Halim\\u2019s statement, the testimony of alibi witnesses, and a complete lack of physical evidence tying Mr. Aziz and Mr. Islam to the shooting, the ballroom or to each other, they were convicted along with him.\", \"Mr. Halim continued to call for the exoneration of his co-defendants in the years that followed. In 1977, he wrote the affidavit in which he again said the men were innocent and identified the other assassins.\", \"In another affidavit, the following year, he provided more detail about his recruitment into the assassination plot and the plan itself, saying that he hoped the additional statements \\u201cwill clear up any doubt as to what took place in the killing of Malcolm X and the innocence of Norman Butler and Thomas Johnson.\\u201d\", \"But just as his testimony had been ignored, the affidavits failed to accomplish their purpose. Mr. Aziz and Mr. Islam\\u2019s motion to wipe out their convictions was denied by a judge, Harold Rothwax, who was known for his hard-line approach to defendants.\", \"In prison, the weight of what he had done appeared to crash down on Mr. Halim, according to the independent historian Abdur-Rahman Muhammad, who has studied Malcolm X\\u2019s life and death for more than 30 years and hosted a Netflix documentary series on the assassination.\", \"After Elijah Muhammad, the Nation of Islam leader, died in 1975, his son, Warith Deen Mohammed, began instructing his followers in a new set of beliefs, including ideas about the afterlife, while simultaneously restoring Malcolm X\\u2019s good name. At that point, the historian said, Mr. Halim became concerned about the state of his soul.\", \"\\u201cHe had a complete breakdown in prison because he had been holding it down on a pack of lies,\\u201d Abdur-Rahman Muhammad said. \\u201cHe took a man\\u2019s life over a lie.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Goldman said in an interview last week that he had been struck by what he felt was Mr. Halim\\u2019s sincere penitence.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s hard for me to say I liked a murderer, particularly the murderer of a man I so respected,\\u201d Mr. Goldman said. \\u201cBut that\\u2019s where I ended up.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Goldman, who is friends with Mr. Aziz, said that Mr. Aziz too, had forgiven Mr. Halim for his role in the murder that led to the wrongful conviction, in part because of the affidavits and in part for religious reasons. Mr. Aziz had referred to his former co-defendant, Mr. Goldman said, as having \\u201can innocent heart.\\u201d (Mr. Aziz is not currently granting interviews.)\", \"Mr. Halim spent more than 40 years in prison. He received a bachelor\\u2019s and a master\\u2019s degree in sociology and participated in a work-release program that allowed him to spend much of the week outside prison.\", \"For a time, Mr. Halim worked at the Manhattan Psychiatric Center on Wards Island and at a Steak\\u2019N\\u2019Take fast food restaurant. He was released in 2010 and has lived in Brooklyn since, on the opposite side of the city from the Audubon Ballroom where he participated in the assassination that changed his life \\u2014 and the lives of the innocent men convicted with him.\", \"\\u201cHe doesn\\u2019t want to ever appear to be benefiting from what he did,\\u201d said the historian, Mr. Muhammad. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why he doesn\\u2019t do interviews. He is genuinely trying to save his soul from the hellfire, and he doesn\\u2019t want to benefit at all from what he did. He\\u2019s ashamed of what he did.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"54ced47a4b6d11ec8f1e1dda8f45ee32"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"54ced47a4b6d11ec8f1e1dda8f45ee32"}},
