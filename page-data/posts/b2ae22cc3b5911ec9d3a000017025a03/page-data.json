So if Amazon\\u2019s TV version of catches on, there\\u2019ll be enough story to tell to keep the show running longer than the \\u201cGame of Thrones\\u201d series and \\u201cThe Lord of the Rings\\u201d movies combined. \\u201cThe Wheel of Time\\u201d starts as simply as the novels do: with the tale of the mystic Moiraine (Rosamund Pike) who helps a group of young people escape the shadow forces pursuing them, while knowing that someone in her charge may be their land\\u2019s long-prophesied champion in an ancient, eternally recurring battle against civilization-destroying chaos agents. As with the books, the TV series is as much character-driven as it is lore-driven.\", \"Also arriving:\", \"Nov. 5\", \"\\u201cThe Electrical Life of Louis Wain\\u201d\", \"\\u201cA Man Named Scott\\u201d\", \"\\u201cTampa Baes\\u201d\", \"Nov. 12\", \"\\u201cAlways Jane\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMayor Pete\\u201d\", \"Nov. 19\", \"\\u201cEverybody Loves Natti\\u201d\", \"Nov. 29\", \"\\u201cBurning\\u201d\", \"\\u2018Hawkeye\\u2019\", \"Starts streaming: Nov. 24\", \"The recent run of Marvel Cinematic Universe TV series have featured some real departures, with shows like \\u201cWandaVision,\\u201d \\u201cLoki\\u201d and \\u201cWhat If\\u2026?\\u201d sporting unusual narrative structures and stories that ventured into the more mystical areas of Marvel Comics. But the six-part mini-series \\u201cHawkeye\\u201d promises to be more of a grounded action-adventure, in the vein of \\u201cThe Falcon and the Winter Soldier\\u201d (and with some of the same characters). Jeremy Renner reprises his role as the Avengers\\u2019 resident archer and family man Clint Barton, who finds himself training a prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9e, Kate Bishop (Hailee Steinfeld), in hopes that he can take care of his latest crisis and get home in time for Christmas. \\u201cHawkeye\\u201d was inspired in part by comic book stories penned by Matt Fraction, who brought a playful quality to the title character that should carry over well to television.\", \"\\u2018The Beatles: Get Back\\u2019\", \"Starts streaming: Nov. 25\", \"The 1970 documentary \\u201cLet It Be\\u201d captured both the recording of one of the Beatles\\u2019 final albums and the personality conflicts that ultimately led to the band\\u2019s breakup. The director Peter Jackson\\u2019s three-part docuseries \\u201cGet Back\\u201d takes the original footage from that documentary (supervised at the time by the director Michael Lindsay-Hogg) and refashions it into a larger story: about the making of the original film, and about what was really happening in the Beatles\\u2019 lives back then that even a fly-on-the-wall camera couldn\\u2019t catch. Jackson\\u2019s version is meant to be a more nuanced take on the band circa 1970, catching the passive-aggressive sniping but also the genuine pleasure these musicians took in working together on classic songs like \\u201cDon\\u2019t Let Me Down\\u201d and \\u201cThe Long and Winding Road.\\u201d\", \"Also arriving:\", \"Nov. 12\", \"\\u201cCiao Alberto\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHome Sweet Home Alone\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOlaf Presents\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe World According to Jeff Goldblum\\u201d\", \"\\u2018The Great\\u2019 Season 2\", \"Starts streaming: Nov. 19\", \"Season one of \\u201cThe Great\\u201d introduced the \\u201coccasionally true\\u201d story of Catherine II (Elle Fanning), who marries the cruel and capricious Russian emperor Peter III (Nicholas Hoult) and then begins trying to wrest power from him in ways both subtle and overt. The second season picks up not long after the events of last year\\u2019s finale, in which the two headstrong aristocrats reached a wary rapprochement, for the sake of their unborn child and for their own private agendas. The series\\u2019 creator Tony McNamara was one of the Oscar-nominated screenwriters of \\u201cThe Favourite,\\u201d another unapologetically anachronistic historical dramedy.

However the series eventually ends, its star, Hailee Steinfeld, continues to bring wit and passion to the role of an artist who wants badly to leave a lasting legacy, but a stubborn patriarchy and the looming threat of Civil War have her fearing that she\\u2019ll never get the chance to be heard.\", \"\\u2018Finch\\u2019\", \"Starts streaming: Nov. 5\", \"Tom Hanks gets back into \\u201cCast Away\\u201d mode in the science-fiction drama \\u201cFinch,\\u201d playing the title character: a resourceful scientist who is one of the few survivors of an Earth ravaged by environmental disasters. Fearing he is dying of radiation poisoning, Finch builds a robot named Jeff (voiced by Caleb Landry Jones) and fills it with as much useful knowledge as he can, hoping Jeff will help him drive from St. Louis to San Francisco \\u2014 and that the machine will take care of Finch\\u2019s dog after his master is dead. The road trip is filled with surprises and dangers, but most of the movie is just a long conversation between a man and his well-meaning but frequently bumbling creation, as Finch tries to explain to Jeff both how and why to survive tough times.\", \"\\u2018The Shrink Next Door\\u2019\", \"Starts streaming: Nov. 12\", \"The journalist Joe Nocera\\u2019s true-crime podcast \\u201cThe Shrink Next Door\\u201d tells the story of Dr. Isaac Herschkopf, a psychiatrist who allegedly took control of his patient Martin Markowitz\\u2019s life, moving into his ritzy Hamptons estate and eventually guiding his financial decisions. In the TV adaptation, Paul Rudd plays the doctor and Will Ferrell plays Marty. The two actors lean into both the comic and the dramatic possibilities of the codependent relationship that develops between these two men: One who is pushy and the other a pushover. The mini-series\\u2019s narrative stretches across decades, as the writer Georgia Pritchett and the director Michael Showalter seek to explain how this situation got out of hand, between a charming opportunist and a person who desperately needed his approval.\", \"Also arriving:\", \"Nov. 3\", \"\\u201cDr. Brain\\u201d\", \"Nov. 5\", \"\\u201cHello, Jack!

In Season 1, Wilson tried to get a handle on basic concepts like friendship, ownership, security and memory. By the end of the run, he (like everyone else on the planet) saw his life upended by disease and death.
