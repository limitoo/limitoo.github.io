And this is one of those poems, in which David Baker has me thinking of what I\\u2019ve gained and lost trying to be there for my own children, for the relatives I love but don\\u2019t call enough. And \\u201cHold Hands,\\u201d like some of our most intimate moments, ain\\u2019t a story that\\u2019s easy to understand. But it\\u2019s the story we return to, hoping to remember that then \\u201cwe were holding hands as hands/were holding us.\\u201d Selected by Reginald Dwayne Betts\", \"By David Baker\", \"We were in the trees. White curtains opened.Your shoulders in my hands then your kneesdrew upward. Rain like petals there. Rainlike breeze. Now the birds were in the treestwo stories up, our window, where blowingleaves were level with our sheets. We werein the street. We were holding hands as handswere holding us. What hands there were werewhere we were. In trees. Our children thereas songbirds were. The hands where we werein the trees were holding us there. Where wewere in the street. Please the rain to pleasethe petals in the breeze like rain. Please todraw your hair along my hands your handsare holding us. Lines along the window laneare holding us like songs. As now the songs thesirens in the trees. Lines along the window lane.Your hair in feathers where the children are.Whose curtains singing. Whose hands areholding us who cry like birds. Hold hands.The birds are in the trees. The birds ourchildren there in cages singing in the trees.\", \"\"]","href_hash":"a314fece485811ec885e27dac71e361a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a314fece485811ec885e27dac71e361a"}},
