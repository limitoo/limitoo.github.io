Brookline, Massachusetts, has a seasonal ban on gas-powered leaf blowers, as does Montclair, New Jersey, and Burlington, Vermont.\\u00a0\", \"Leaders in those communities have been urging homeowners and landscapers to use electric-powered devices instead, and the advice appears to be sticking. Demand for electric powered lawn equipment is expected to grow into a $14.1 billion industry by 2024,\\u00a0according\\u00a0to market research from the Freedonia Group.\", \"Gas-powered tools emit pollutants that could lead to lung cancer, heart disease and respiratory problems, California lawmakers say.\\u00a0 Using a gas-powered lawn mower for an hour generates the same amount of emissions roughly as a car driving from Los Angeles to Las Vegas,\\u00a0according to the California Air Resources Board.\", \"Lawmakers in Illinois last year introduced a bill that, if passed, would ban the operation or sale of gas-powered leaf blowers. The measure is still undergoing amendments. A similar\\u00a0bill\\u00a0in New York, introduced two months ago, now sits in a state Senate committee.\", \"Some landscapers say they're open to switching to electric devices, but that battery-powered hedgers and leaf blowers don't yet pack enough power.\", \"Andrew Bray, vice president of government relations at the National Association of Professional Landscapers,\\u00a0told the Associated Press that some of the devices cannot finish a day's work without being recharged multiple times, Bray said.\", \"\\\"With leaf blowers, for example, they don't yet have the battery power needed for commercial use,\\\" Bray said.\\u00a0\", \"Still, lawn care professionals like David Hernandez of Sod and Turf Pros in Los Angeles, see emissions-free electric tools as the future. Said Hernandes, \\\"You won't be having all that gas up in your nose, you won't be inhaling it \\u2014 because I've been there, I've done that.\\\"\", \"Khristopher J.
