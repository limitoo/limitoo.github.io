Kamau Bell was growing up, Bill Cosby was the \\u201cwallpaper of Black America\\u201d and an inspiration, Bell said in a recent interview. Bell\\u2019s new documentary, \\u201cWe Need to Talk About Cosby,\\u201d surveys the star\\u2019s long career and cultural impact, as well as the accusations of sexual assault that culminated in his conviction, on three counts of aggravated indecent assault, in 2018. Cosby was freed from prison in June 2021 after an appeals court ruled that his due process rights had been violated.\", \"The four-part documentary \\u2014 which premieres on Showtime on Sunday \\u2014 consists of clips from his shows and standup act, conversations with women who accused Cosby and a parade of other interviewees who try to process the Cosby story and his legacy.\", \"As a comedian and host of shows like CNN\\u2019s \\u201cUnited Shades of America,\\u201d Bell said he has become known as a guy who is willing to have difficult conversations. But the one about Cosby was tougher than most, generating criticism from both sides: Some Cosby accusers didn\\u2019t talk to him because they didn\\u2019t want to be part of a project that includes Cosby\\u2019s achievements. At the same time, Bell said, he has been accused of tearing down a Black role model when he could be examining white transgressors instead.\", \"Last week, Cosby criticized the project through his spokesman, Andrew Wyatt, who added that Cosby continues to deny all allegations against him. Wyatt also praised Cosby\\u2019s work in the entertainment industry. \\u201cMr. Cosby has spent more than 50 years standing with the excluded,\\u201d he said in a statement.\", \"As a reporter who covered Bill Cosby\\u2019s trials for The New York Times, I am familiar with the accusations against him. But the documentary sets those accusations in a deep context of American culture and Cosby\\u2019s career.\", \"Recently I spoke to Bell by video call about making the series, and about his belief that Cosby\\u2019s story is a story about America. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"Hi Kamau. How are you doing?\", \"[Laughs.] You\\u2019ve covered this story a lot, so I think you probably have some sense of how I\\u2019m doing. And then add Black into it.\", \"You\\u2019ve described to me the trepidation you felt about getting involved in something that had the potential to be \\u201ctoxic.\\u201d What do you mean by that?\", \"We reached out to people, and we got so many \\u201cno\\u201ds so quickly. At the time, he was still in prison, and I thought, Oh maybe we can finally have the productive Bill Cosby conversation. But with every note I got from people who were really doing well in show business, what I\\u2019m hearing is, \\u201cThis is a bad idea.\\u201d Not that they would say that outright, but the feeling was, No, I don\\u2019t want to touch that. Maybe they didn\\u2019t want to touch it with me, but I think generally they don\\u2019t want to touch it.\", \"Why would they say that?\", \"I mean specifically for Black people, whether you were involved indirectly or not, it\\u2019s hard to have a productive conversation about Bill Cosby without frustrating some of your audience who still wants to support him, whether they believe he did these things or not.\", \"How did the idea for the documentary come about?\", \"The idea came very naturally in a conversation with [Boardwalk Pictures Production]. I liked their work, they liked my work, and we started talking about comedian documentaries. Generally, there are not enough great comedian documentaries, and then through that conversation it was, \\u201cCould you do one about a comedian who has fallen?\\u201d There are any number to hold up, but Bill Cosby was the one we talked about. And I\\u2019ve been thinking about this Bill Cosby conversation for years.\", \"What did you hope to achieve?\", \"When I started making it, as we say in the doc, he was in prison. It sort of felt like the Bill Cosby story was, in large part, over. So maybe now we can have the conversation, and it\\u2019s a conversation I was already having in my head and with other people. Seeing people online trying to have it, the conversation wasn\\u2019t happening in a productive way.\", \"We have to learn something from this. If we don\\u2019t have the conversation, I don\\u2019t think we\\u2019re going to learn. The guy that I believed he was when I was growing up and when I was a young adult \\u2014 that guy would want me to learn something from this.\", \"So on some level, your example, Bill Cosby, led me to try to figure this out.\", \"So what did you figure out?\", \"[Kierna Mayo, the former editor in chief of Ebony magazine] said something to the effect of, \\u201cBill Cosby is key to understanding America.\\u201d To me, that\\u2019s what this is about.\", \"There are two runaway forces of oppression in America: One, how we treat nonwhite people. The other is how we have treated women through the history of this country. And if you look at Bill Cosby\\u2019s career, you can see things he did that makes this better and makes this worse. I believe there\\u2019s a lot to learn there.\", \"You use a timeline device in a powerful way that allows you to talk about the highlights of his career and also locate the timing of the accusations against him.\", \"I don\\u2019t like when documentaries tell some personal story but they don\\u2019t connect to history. Because you want to know what was happening when that happened \\u2014 that helps give us the sense of why this is even more interesting.\", \"It doesn\\u2019t make sense to talk about Bill Cosby as if he was a solo man in the world. You have to really see how the boys-will-be-boys culture of Hollywood, specifically in the \\u201960s, invites a kind of behavior that allows predators to hide.\", \"It also lays this timeline of his career, the timeline of America and the timeline of the accusations on top of each other, which helps you see them in a new way.\", \"You raise the question about who else knew at the time about the accusations against Cosby, but you don\\u2019t come up with many specific answers. Did you try to talk to senior figures in the industry?\", \"Yeah. but we didn\\u2019t have access to any of those people. And I\\u2019m not an investigative journalist, so there\\u2019s a point at which I have to accept that I\\u2019m here to take all that we know and start to figure out what were the circumstances through which this went down.\", \"Ultimately, the bigger thing is it\\u2019s clear that the industry overall is not doing a good job, and the people who run the industry are probably still not doing the best job they can do. That\\u2019s the bigger issue to me.\", \"At times, it seems that the \\u201cWe\\u201d in \\u201cWe need to talk about Cosby\\u201d refers mainly to a Black audience. Are there some complexities of the Cosby case that are particular to Black people?\", \"I would say the \\u201cWe\\u201d is those of us who feel connected to Bill Cosby. Now it just so happens that a lot of those people are Black people. But let\\u2019s be clear: He was America\\u2019s dad, not Black America\\u2019s dad. He was universal. Everybody who worked on this, no matter what their race was, if they were of a certain generation, they were like, \\u201cYeah, I watched that show and felt like I was part of that family, too.\\u201d\", \"Even this interview is complicated: For a lot of people, I will be tearing down a Black man in a white newspaper in front of a white man. And the question is, why isn\\u2019t this interview about Harvey Weinstein, or Trump, or other people who have had allegations of sexual assault? Those are the questions that are coming at me now on social media \\u2014 like, why this man?\", \"What do you say to your detractors?\", \"I learned long ago you can\\u2019t win those battles on social media, so I\\u2019m sort of allowing them to happen. I\\u2019m going to handle it by talking to you and other outlets, and by making sure I talk to Black press outlets, places where maybe those people will go. But I don\\u2019t think there\\u2019s any resolving it. If those people watch it, they will learn it is a more nuanced conversation than I think they believe it is.\", \"This is another trite thing to say, but\\u00a0we have to be on the right side of history here. Can this be an opportunity for a large percentage of this country to actually work to make the system and structures better, from the highest levels of show business and corporate America, through working-class America, all the way down to how sex education is taught in schools? There are so many levels of this \\u2014 those of us who want to be on the right side of history have to do the work to rebuild these systems.\\u00a0\", \"You ask many times in the documentary, \\u201cWho is Bill Cosby now?\\u201d Did you come to a conclusion yourself?\", \"Somebody who has always taught us about America and is still teaching us about America, even if it\\u2019s in ways he does not want to. And it is very important for us to learn all of the lessons of Bill Cosby if we\\u2019re actually going to be a better society.\", \"Also embedded in that, and it\\u2019s hard to say it, but in the greater context: [Cosby is] one of the key figures for Black America and America in the 20th century. And one of the greatest standup comedians of all time. And the creator of one of the best sitcoms of all time. And, throughout a lot of his career, an advocate for Black excellence. But if you want to engage with that, you have to engage with the other stuff.\", \"Cosby was released from prison before you finished the documentary. How did his release change things?\", \"I didn\\u2019t want this, but it gave it a more immediate feel \\u2014 this is an active situation again. He\\u2019s out in the world again, which means all the defenders are out there in the world again and feel emboldened. So it feels both more important to tell this story and scary to tell this story, because people are invested in protecting him.\", \"The most valuable conversation to me isn\\u2019t the film \\u2014 it\\u2019s the conversation that we all have after we watch the film. No matter what you think about Bill Cosby\\u2019s story, it is critical that we create a society that treats survivors of sexual assault better.\"]","href_hash":"8161e53e807111ec98fd29e4dc2c1030"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8161e53e807111ec98fd29e4dc2c1030"}},
