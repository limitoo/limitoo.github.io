COVID\\u00a0patients in Queensland since the pandemic began.\", \"But with the state's\\u00a0border rules set to relax in December, that number could skyrocket as the pandemic reaches rural areas for the first time.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Low vaccination rates, big risks</div>\", \"The RFDS is working to get ahead of the deadly disease, travelling to isolated communities to deliver and

vaccination rate is less than 60 per cent.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f836567396997ef2e3af0155e530576f\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

the Commonwealth on Monday, outback Queensland has 53.2 per cent of its eligible population fully vaccinated, and 63.4 per cent with one dose.\", \"Central Queensland, Bowen Basin, Mackay and the Whitsundays are at 57 per cent fully vaccinated, and almost 75 per cent with one dose.\", \"That is on par with parts of outback Western Australia.\", \"RFDS chief medical officer Katie Clift said she was\\u00a0worried\\u00a0about regions that were a long way from a major hospital.\", \"\\\"Vaccination will reduce disease severity but also the spread of the disease.\\\"\", \"<img

this for a long time \\u2014\\u00a0moving unwell patients is what we do.\\\"\", \"LifeFlight operates six fixed-wing planes and 10 helicopters across the state.\", \"\\\"Like all healthcare providers,

flying emergency room to far flung areas was not enough of a challenge, there are still concerns that Queensland's hospital system may struggle to keep up as patient numbers rise.\", \"Public

University infectious diseases physician\\u00a0Emma McBryde told the ABC the systems could be \\\"tested very strongly in the next few months\\\".\", \"A Queensland Health spokesman\\u00a0said it was prepared for \\\"Delta incursions\\\" of COVID-19.\", \"Across the state, the department has about 380 staffed intensive care beds, but that can expand to 570 if demand increases.\", \"The hospitals share 1,355 ventilators, and more than 300 negative pressure rooms, which has increased since the pandemic.\", \"A spokesman said not all COVID patients would\\u00a0need hospital care.\", \"\\\"We have the ability to provide care to patients who are well enough to be treated at home or other non-hospital settings.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Bracing for the worst\\u00a0</div>\", \"Dr Clift said the RFDS had\\u00a0detailed modelling on how it could\\u00a0function if its aeromedical team were infected.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We have got some strategies in place to model what it would look like if a proportion of our staff were unable to work for periods of time, and how we might keep the service operational.\", \"\\\"(It's) our absolute priority to maintain to the areas that rely on RFDS for medical care and for aeromedical retrieval.\\\"\", \"Those areas are vast, spanning 1.73 million square kilometres with 20 aircraft\\u00a0that take-off from bases in Cairns, Townsville Mount

worked to treat isolated communities, particularly Indigenous residents who may be reluctant to be airlifted to a distant hospital, away from their family network.\", \"\\\"It's a very bespoke
