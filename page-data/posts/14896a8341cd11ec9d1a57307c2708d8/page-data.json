It produced the earlier report on depiction along with the University of Southern California Annenberg Inclusion Initiative and others.\", \"Kashif Shaikh, a co-founder of Pillars and its president, said that when the group discussed the findings, those in the industry often said they did not know where to find Muslim writers or actors.\", \"The database, Shaikh said, aims to give Muslim actors, directors, cinematographers, sound technicians and others, who could help create more nuanced portrayals, the chance to compose online profiles that can be reviewed by those hiring for film, television and streaming productions.\", \"That way, \\u201cMuslims around the country would be able to opt in and talk about their talents, talk about their expertise,\\u201d Shaikh said. \\u201cIt was really meant to be a resource for studios, for the film industry.\\u201d\", \"The report on depiction, \\u201cMissing & Maligned,\\u201d was issued in June and analyzed 200 top-grossing movies released between 2017 and 2019 across the United States, Britain, Australia and New Zealand.\", \"Of 8,965 speaking characters, 1.6 percent were Muslim, the report said. It added that just over 60 percent of primary and secondary Muslim characters appeared in movies set in the historical or recent past. Just under 40 percent appeared in three movies which took place in present-day Australia, the report said, and most of those characters \\u2014 including \\u201cthe only present-day Muslim lead\\u201d \\u2014 appeared in one movie, \\u201cAli\\u2019s Wedding,\\u201d released in 2017.\", \"Pillars, along with the Inclusion Initiative and the British actor Riz Ahmed and his production company, Left Handed Films, also released a companion report titled \\u201cThe Blueprint for Muslim Inclusion\\u201d that was intended to \\u201cfundamentally change the way Muslims are portrayed on screen.\\u201d\", \"Before the reports were issued, Shaikh said, Pillars had begun conversations with Disney, which supported the creation of the database with a $20,000 grant.\", \"Latondra Newton, senior vice president and chief diversity officer of Disney, said in a statement that the support was part of an ongoing effort \\u201cto amplify underrepresented voices and untold stories,\\u201d adding: \\u201cWe are honored to support the new Pillars Muslim Artist Database.\\u201d\", \"This follows the announcement last week of a guide, \\u201cThe Time Is Now: The Power of Native Representation in Entertainment,\\u201d that was the result of a partnership between Disney and IllumiNative, a nonprofit group that works to raise the visibility of \\u201cNative Nations and peoples in American Society.\\u201d\", \"That guide was created \\u201cto help move beyond the outdated, inaccurate and often offensive depictions of Native peoples in pop culture,\\u201d the group said in a statement. It includes sections on \\u201cCombating Negative Stereotypes,\\u201d \\u201cAvoiding Cultural Appropriation\\u201d and \\u201cSupporting Native Storytellers.\\u201d\", \"The support of the Pillars and IllumiNative projects is the most recent example of how Disney has promoted diversity amid complaints that Hollywood offers too few opportunities to women, people of color and the disabled.\", \"Some of Disney\\u2019s best known offerings from decades ago, including \\u201cSong of the South\\u201d and \\u201cDumbo,\\u201d have been criticized for including racist imagery and what have been seen as thinly veiled racist caricatures.\", \"\\u201cAladdin,\\u201d an Oscar-winning animated movie that Disney released in 1992, featured a mainly white voice cast and an opening song with lyrics about a faraway place: \\u201cWhere they cut off your ear/If they don\\u2019t like your face/It\\u2019s barbaric, but hey, it\\u2019s home.\\u201d (Disney said in 1993, after objections by members of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, that the ear-cutting reference would be removed but the word \\u201cbarbaric\\u201d remained.)\", \"Over the last several years, however, as the company\\u2019s executive chairman, Robert A.
