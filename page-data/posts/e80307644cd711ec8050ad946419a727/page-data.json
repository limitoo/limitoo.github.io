Right-wing politicians and media figures have promoted it as a COVID-19 treatment.\", \"However, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have warned people not to use Ivermectin as a COVID-19 treatment. Clinical data hasn't shown the drug to have any effect on preventing COVID-19 or reducing symptoms in COVID-19 patients.\", \"Merck, a pharmaceutical company that manufactures the drug, has said there's \\\"no meaningful evidence for clinical activity or efficacy in patients with COVID-19.\\\"\", \"Nevertheless, Littell has remained a major proponent of the drug. He reportedly writes prescriptions for the drug for people in other states who can't get local medical professionals to do so, Yahoo News reported.

Kory has said that a \\\"pharmageddon\\\" over Ivermectin has occurred, with the pharmaceutical and medical industries initiating a \\\"PR campaign designed to destroy\\\" the drug's reputation.\", \"In December 2020, Kory told the U.S. Senate that Ivermectin is \\\"effectively a 'miracle drug'\\\" that could stop diseases and their transmission.
