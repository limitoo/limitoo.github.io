Andrew Cuomo caused him to resign.\", \"She said she would rather remain focused on the current investigations of her office, including various probes into the National Rifle Association and the financial dealings of former President Donald Trump and the Trump Organization.\", \"\\\"I have come to the conclusion that I must continue my work as attorney general,\\\" James, 63, said in a statement. \\\"There are a number of important investigations and cases that are underway, and I intend to finish the job. I am running for re-election to complete the work New Yorkers elected me to do.\\\"\", \"James was expected to be a formidable opponent for Gov. Kathy Hochul, who succeeded Cuomo after his resignation, as James has been a public figure since she assumed the position of attorney general in 2019 with various comments about the lawsuits against the NRA and Trump.\", \"She has been vocal in recent weeks saying Hochul should take more significant measures to slow the spread of COVID.\", \"\\\"All I can say is, I respect her tremendously. Always have,\\\" Hochul said Thursday \\\"This is a very bad day for Donald Trump and the NRA.\\\"\", \"The lawsuit led by James against the NRA into alleged financial mismanagement and violation of state laws and the organization's bylaws caused the group to attempt to file for bankruptcy and relocate to Texas to avoid the lawsuit, according to James' office.\", \"In the days following her announcement, Fordham law professor Zephyr Teachout, state Sen.
