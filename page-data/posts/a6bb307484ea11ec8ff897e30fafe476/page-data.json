She says in the film that borders \\u201cmean nothing to hummus.\\u201d\", \"The contestants live in Israel but come from diverse backgrounds. At the festival they are generally paired with someone whose origins differ from their own to create an assigned dish. For example, Ali Khattib, from an Alawite village in the Golan Heights, and Shlomi Meir, who runs an Eastern European restaurant in Haifa, work together to make a traditionally Syrian soup with a base of bulgur wheat soaked in yogurt.\", \"A lot of the observations in \\u201cBreaking Bread\\u201d \\u2014 the repeatedly offered notions that food is a common language or that politics has no place in the kitchen \\u2014 seem trite and perhaps overly optimistic.
