Hartle appeared by videoconference from his defense attorney's office to plead guilty to a misdemeanor of voting more than once in the same election. He told Kierny he regrets his actions and accepted full responsibility for them.\", \"David Chesnoff, Hartle's attorney, stopped Hartle from describing publicly how he voted early with a ballot mailed to his dead wife. Rosemarie Hartle died in 2017 but her name stayed on the voter rolls.\", \"State Attorney General Aaron Ford's office agreed to reduce two felony charges against Hartle to the misdemeanor, Chesnoff told the judge.\", \"Kierny accepted the deal but was unhappy with it. Hartle was fined $2,000 and has to stay out of trouble for a year. The judge set Nov. 17, 2022, as a date to review the result.\", \"\\\"This seems to me to be a cheap political stunt that kind of backfired,\\\" Kierny said, \\\"and shows that our voting system actually works because you were ultimately caught.\\\"\", \"\\\"Not to follow the negotiations would be a political stunt of my own and I am not willing to do that,\\\" she said.\", \"Hartle, 55, is a chief financial officer for companies owned by Republican party finance chairman Donald Ahern. If convicted of the two felonies, he could have received up to eight years in prison.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1934013/donald-hartle-voter-fraud-november-2020.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">On Tuesday, a state court judge said that a Las Vegas man's claim of voter fraud was \\\"a cheap political stunt\\\" that backfired.
