The administrator had approached Humphrey, who was also a member of the school's track team, to inquire why he would run track in addition to playing baseball.\", \"Humphrey told WPIX-TV that he told the administrator \\\"it never hurts to gain speed.\\\"\", \"However, the man reportedly told Humphrey that he was already fast enough, and that he had \\\"gained that speed by running from the police.\\\"\", \"\\\"That was racist. There was no reason for him to say that,\\\" Humphrey added.\", \"In light of the encounter, Humphrey and his family decided that he was going to transfer schools, as he didn't \\\"feel like I have to stay at a program where they're going to look at me different, or feel uncomfortable at a place I have to go to Monday through Friday.\\\"\", \"Humphrey added that this was not the only time he had experienced this kind of treatment at Iona Prep.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1940038/baseball-bat.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A New York high school baseball player has transferred schools after a \\\"racist\\\" incident with an assistant coach.

Dozens of Iona Preparatory students reportedly took part in the event.\", \"A spokesperson for Iona Prep, a private Catholic school run by the Edmund Rice Christian Brothers, would not speak to reporters about the incident.\", \"However, Brother Thomas R. Leto, school president, did send a letter to parents and students, in which he noted that the staff member who had made the racist comment had resigned.\", \"Leto called the man's actions \\\"behavior that Iona Preparatory does not condone for its students and will not accept from its faculty and staff.\\\"\", \"\\\"One of the most important aspects of our school community \\u2014 the acceptance and respect of every student \\u2014 has been infringed upon,\\\" Leto continued. \\\"On behalf of the administration and staff, I am deeply sorry to this student and those most offended and negatively impacted.\\\"\", \"\\\"We remain fully committed to being an open, welcoming, embracing and nurturing community, where every young man holds a special place in the brotherhood of Iona men,\\\" he concluded.\", \"Leto also remarked that Iona Prep had recently undergone a respectfulness campaign, and stated that the school had launched an internal investigation into the incident.\", \"Humphrey is now on track to graduate from the local public high school, and has already committed to continuing his baseball career at Boston College.\"]","href_hash":"1dacb6be4da811ec8c059bdc2486d736"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1dacb6be4da811ec8c059bdc2486d736"}},
