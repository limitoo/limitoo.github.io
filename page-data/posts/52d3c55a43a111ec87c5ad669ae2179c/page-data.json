She impressed him with her ability to identify species on sight.\", \"\\u201cI was heading the table at the activities fair for the botany club and I had this terrarium of carnivorous plants,\\u201d Mr. Zhang said. \\u201cMost people will walk by and grab some candy and won\\u2019t even talk to us or have any questions. But then this girl, Sarah, walks by and was like, \\u2018Oh my goodness, is this a Nepenthes?\\u2019 So I was very nerdy and super impressed because not only did she take notice, but she also knew what the name of the plant was.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Santucci later joined the botany club and the two became friends. They began exchanging plants as gifts for birthdays and bonded over plant shows.\", \"By 2016, Mr. Zhang\\u2019s feelings for Dr. Santucci had grown more than platonic. That year, he worked up the courage to ask her what she was doing for Valentine\\u2019s Day. \\u201cI was actually going to do a movie night with somebody else and I could see he was disappointed so I was like, \\u2018Hmm, there\\u2019s potential here,\\u2019\\u201d Dr. Santucci said.\", \"She agreed to go on a date the next day, however, and Mr. Zhang took Dr. Santucci out for dinner at the Princeton Quadrangle Club.

While they had talked about marriage, Mr. Zhang wanted to surprise Dr. Santucci with a proposal on the trip.\", \"But Dr. Santucci had a feeling the question was coming. \\u201cThis whole trip was just very nice, very well planned. So I thought it was going to be a special trip, if you know what I mean,\\u201d she said.\", \"Mr. Zhang took care to make the moment distinctive. \\u201cI have this side hobby of working with rocks and minerals and things like that, so what I decided to do was make a ring box out of bismuth,\\u201d Mr. Zhang said.\", \"But the box had broken the morning of the proposal and had to be repaired.
