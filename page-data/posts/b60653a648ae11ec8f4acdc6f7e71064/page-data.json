The documents, called The Facebook Papers, were shared with journalists in October. The Wall Street Journal first reported on the documents and the issues at Instagram with the help of Frances Haugen, the whistle-blower.\", \"Doug Peterson, the Nebraska attorney general and another leader of the investigation, said the states would examine the \\u201cthe techniques utilized by Meta to increase the frequency and duration of engagement by young users and the resulting harms caused by such extended engagement.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhen social media platforms treat our kids as mere commodities to manipulate for longer screen time engagement & data extraction, it becomes imperative for state attorneys general to engage our investigative authority under our consumer protection laws,\\u201d Mr. Peterson said in a tweet.\", \"Spanning tens of thousands of pages and gigabytes of data, the Facebook Papers show a company struggling to deal with many issues that come as a byproduct of its enormous scale and billions of users, spanning topics like misinformation, addiction and manipulation of users around the world. Much of the information came in the form of detailed reports investigating the issues, laid out by the company\\u2019s research division.\", \"Meta has said the research efforts are intended to address the issues they pinpoint, with the aim of improving the company\\u2019s products and services.\", \"The documents detail that roughly a third of teenage girls who already felt bad about their bodies said Instagram made them feel worse. \\u201cComparisons on Instagram can change how young women view and describe themselves,\\u201d the documents said.\", \"Meta has disputed the characterization of the initial reporting on Instagram\\u2019s issues, saying that the story lacked context and left out vital information.\", \"Representatives for Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday.\", \"This is a breaking story.
