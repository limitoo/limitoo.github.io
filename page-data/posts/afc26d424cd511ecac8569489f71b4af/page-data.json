The world they show us is too dark for anything but the cruelest of tales, the bleakest of forms.\", \"And no wonder. The systems that control our lives \\u2014 institutional racism, predatory capitalism, the prison-industrial complex \\u2014 seem as powerful and implacable as gods. What can humans do about fate, these playwrights suggest, but submit to it and hope to preserve the story?\", \"Lynn Nottage has sometimes been one of them. Her two Pulitzer Prizes are for works in which the world and its people are trapped in an abusive relationship. In \\u201cRuined,\\u201d women prove to be the real targets in the Congolese civil war. In \\u201cSweat,\\u201d steelworkers resisting their union-busting management inexorably wind up busting one another.\", \"But Nottage\\u2019s delightful new play, \\u201cClyde\\u2019s,\\u201d which opened at the Helen Hayes Theater on Tuesday, dares to flip the paradigm. Though it\\u2019s still about dark things, including prison, drugs, homelessness and poverty, it somehow turns them into bright comedy. In Kate Whoriskey\\u2019s brisk and thoroughly satisfying production for Second Stage Theater, we learn that, unlike Oedipus and his mom, people who may have little else nevertheless have choices.\", \"Which is not to say the choices are easy. In the kitchen of the truck stop diner that gives the play its title, the cooks making the sandwiches have all served time. Letitia (Kara Young) \\u201cgot greedy\\u201d and stole \\u201csome oxy and addy to sell on the side\\u201d after breaking into a pharmacy to obtain \\u201cseizure medication\\u201d for her daughter. Rafael (Reza Salazar) held up a bank but (a) with a BB gun, and (b) only because he wanted to buy his girlfriend a Cavalier King Charles spaniel. We don\\u2019t at first get the story of how Montrellous (Ron Cephas Jones) wound up behind bars, but he is so saintly that Letitia, called Tish, believes it must have been elective.\", \"In any case, like the others, he has paid the price, and keeps paying it. As the joint\\u2019s proprietor, Clyde (Uzo Aduba), enjoys pointing out, she\\u2019s the only employer in Reading, Penn., who will hire \\u201cmorons\\u201d like them. She does so not because she too was once incarcerated; don\\u2019t accuse her of a soft heart. (Of the crime that landed her in prison the only thing she says is that the last man who tried to hurt her \\u201cisn\\u2019t around to try again, I made damn sure of that.\\u201d) Rather, Clyde has shady reasons to keep the overhead low and the morale even lower.\", \"In Aduba\\u2019s hilarious and scalding performance, Clyde, wearing a succession of skintight don\\u2019t-mess-with-me outfits by Jennifer Moeller, is a shape-shifting hellhound, all but breathing fire. (The pyrotechnics are by J&M Special Effects.) Though \\u201cnot indifferent to suffering,\\u201d she tells Montrellous, she doesn\\u2019t \\u201cdo pity,\\u201d which is an understatement. Popping up like a demon in a small window between the front and the back of the restaurant, she roars orders and insults; when she emerges, in full glory, among her minions, it is only to exert her fearful, foul-mouthed dominance.\", \"Into this uncomfortable equilibrium comes Jason (Edmund Donovan), recently out of prison and covered with white supremacist tattoos. (The other characters, in this production, are Black and Latino.) At first it seems that Jason\\u2019s integration into the kitchen will form the story\\u2019s spine: Tish quickly warns him that she knows all about \\u201cbreaking wild white horses.\\u201d But it turns out to be less of a spine than a rib. Despite his tats and defenses, Jason is a puppy, fully domesticated before the play is half over.\", \"This conception of Jason worried me at first. People who have seen \\u201cSweat\\u201d will recognize him as one of the perpetrators of a heinous attack on a Colombian American busboy at the climax of that play, also set in Reading. (Another character suffers a traumatic brain injury in the process.) If Nottage\\u2019s aim was to keep \\u201cClyde\\u2019s\\u201d a comedy, even one about redemption, Jason had to be rebuilt; in the writing though not the performance \\u2014 Donovan faultlessly negotiates the contradictions \\u2014 the seams sometimes show.\", \"Even if you don\\u2019t know \\u201cSweat,\\u201d though, \\u201cClyde\\u2019s\\u201d may slightly cloy. The three other cooks, with their softball crimes, begin to seem a pinch too adorable. Tish, in Walker\\u2019s superb performance, is a smart, sharp, heavily defended kitten; Rafael, a huggable romantic; Montrellous, an impeccably kind sage \\u2014 \\u201clike a Buddha,\\u201d Rafael says, \\u201cif he\\u2019d grown up in the hood.\\u201d Jones fulfills that description perfectly, correcting for the character\\u2019s Zen imperturbability with subtle dashes of pain and sacrifice.\", \"Still, where\\u2019s the action? Another underdeveloped plotline explores the possibility of the diner becoming a destination restaurant. In yet another, a pro forma (but totally heartwarming) romance buds between two of the characters. And the series of fantastical sandwiches Montrellous creates, inspiring the others to make their own as a way of dreaming big, threatens to convert from a leitmotif into an annoyance when it is forced to bear too much meaning.\", \"Yet in \\u201cClyde\\u2019s,\\u201d Nottage does something shrewd with the obvious underlinings that can sometimes make her meticulously researched plays feel didactic. By putting them into a character whose goal is in fact to educate, and by blowing them up into amusing overstatements, she keeps the play itself from becoming gassy. When Montrellous says that sandwiches like his grilled halloumi on home-baked herb focaccia are \\u201cthe most democratic of all foods\\u201d \\u2014 or that \\u201cthis sandwich is my freedom\\u201d \\u2014 we see something about his personality, not just the playwright waving semaphore flags.\", \"It also helps that Takeshi Kata\\u2019s cleverly expanding set, lit for comedy by Christopher Akerlind, allows Whoriskey to hit the ground running and barely pause for 95 minutes. She leans beautifully into the sweetness of the cooks but also, bending the other way, into the sourness of Clyde, for whom Nottage has written great zingers. When Rafael complains about the rotting Chilean sea bass she expects him to cook, she responds, approximately, \\u201cYou think Colonel Sanders didn\\u2019t fry up a couple of rats to make ends meet?\\u201d\", \"Playwrights sometimes do the same. In this case the shortcuts were totally worth it; that \\u201cClyde\\u2019s\\u201d is a comedy does not mean it doesn\\u2019t have tragedy baked in. (It was originally called \\u201cFloyd\\u2019s\\u201d \\u2014 until George Floyd was murdered.) Though it ultimately rejects the Greek model, it is still about gods and mortals. What is Clyde but a greasy-spoon Satan, the diabolical voice seductively whispering \\u201cDon\\u2019t get too high on hope\\u201d to people trying to escape their past?\", \"Still, the cooks are in purgatory, not hell. They are not merely victims of fate; they can use their moral imagination to resist the Clydes of this world. That they discover the power of that imagination in the most unlikely way, by making food, is what makes the play funny. The point would be much the same, though, if it weren\\u2019t: Sometimes, there\\u2019s a good reason you can\\u2019t stand the heat. When that happens, get out of the kitchen!\"]","href_hash":"afc26d424cd511ecac8569489f71b4af"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"afc26d424cd511ecac8569489f71b4af"}},
