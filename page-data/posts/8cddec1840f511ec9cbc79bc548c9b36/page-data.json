They called themselves \\u201cpolio pioneers.\\u201d\", \"On Monday the school again earned a place in the spotlight, by running a coronavirus vaccine clinic for its students that the first lady, Jill Biden, visited with the surgeon general, Dr. Vivek Murthy. Dozens of young children, accompanied by their parents, trooped through its brightly colored gymnasium to get their shots.\", \"The visit kicked off what White House officials said would be a national push, led by Dr. Biden, to persuade parents and guardians to vaccinate 5- to 11-year-olds now that the shots are available to them. The administration has already shipped 15 million pediatric doses across the country to doctors\\u2019 offices, children\\u2019s hospitals, community health centers, pharmacies and schools, with the goal of vaccinating all 28 million children in the age group.\", \"Dr. Biden offered a simple and direct message to parents: \\u201cThis vaccine is the best way to protect your children against Covid-19. It\\u2019s been thoroughly reviewed and rigorously tested. It\\u2019s safe. It\\u2019s free, and it\\u2019s available for every child in this country.\\u201d\", \"Public health experts view vaccinating young children as a critical step toward bringing the pandemic under control. The Food and Drug Administration authorized the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children 5 to 11 at the end of October, and last week the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention endorsed it.\", \"It is too soon to tell how the rollout is going. The C.D.C. will not release data on how many young children have been vaccinated until Wednesday, officials said.\", \"But at Franklin Sherman Elementary in the suburbs of Washington, demand was high. The school has 355 students and quickly filled all 260 appointments at Monday\\u2019s clinic, run by the Fairfax County Health Department. Dr. Biden and Dr. Murthy, who said he was eager to get his 5-year-old vaccinated, handed out stickers to students who had just gotten their shots.\", \"\\u201cYou guys are leaders,\\u201d Dr. Biden told them, \\u201cso thank you for being so brave.\\u201d\", \"Later, the two addressed students and their parents. \\u201cThe truth is that Covid is not harmless in children,\\u201d Dr. Murthy said, adding, \\u201cWe have tragically lost hundreds of children to the pandemic.\\u201d\", \"The administration\\u2019s campaign to vaccinate young children does not look at all like the rollout for adults, nearly a year ago. There are no mass vaccination sites. Pediatricians and pharmacies are doing much of the work. The vials \\u2014 and the needles to administer doses \\u2014 are smaller.\", \"The administration is also hoping that schools like Franklin Sherman will play a major role. On Monday, Xavier Becerra, the secretary of health and human services, and Miguel A. Cardona, the education secretary, sent a letter to school superintendents and elementary school principals across the country urging them to encourage vaccination, including by holding clinics.\", \"But getting parents comfortable with vaccinating their children has sometimes been difficult, even when the children are older. In more conservative areas of the country, school officials are treading lightly in promoting the vaccine.\", \"A survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, published last month before the F.D.A.\\u2019s authorization for younger children, found that 27 percent of parents said they would \\u201cdefinitely not\\u201d get their 5-to-11-year-olds vaccinated against the coronavirus. An additional 33 percent said they would \\u201cwait and see\\u201d how the vaccine was working before getting their children the shots.\", \"That was not the case nearly 70 years ago, when Dr. Jonas Salk announced that he had invented a vaccine against poliomyelitis, the virus that causes polio. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was paralyzed by polio, led the push to eradicate the disease, known then as \\u201cinfant paralysis\\u201d because it so often struck children. (Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, also contracted the disease when he was two and walks with a slight limp as a result.)\", \"By drawing attention to Franklin Sherman Elementary, the White House hoped to remind the public of that earlier era, when the country pulled together to fight a terrifying threat. When Dr. Biden and Dr. Murthy arrived on Monday, they chatted with the school principal, Kathleen Quigley, against the backdrop of two easels displaying black-and-white photos of children getting their polio shots 67 years ago.\", \"The school and its \\u201cpolio pioneers\\u201d are mindful of their place in history. One of them, Jackie Lonergan, now 75, told The Washington Post that parents did not question whether their children should get Dr. Salk\\u2019s experimental vaccine. (In a rare interview in 1993, Dr. Salk told a reporter that his vaccine had offered \\u201cfreedom from fear.\\u201d)\", \"\\u201cWe were very patriotic then,\\u201d the newspaper quoted Ms. Lonergan as saying. \\u201cThe war was over and the country was booming. It was a very optimistic time.\\u201d\", \"The school\\u2019s current students are mindful as well. Dr. Murthy and Dr. Biden were introduced by Everett Munson, a 6th grader who had studied the history of polio in one of his classes. He said he was \\u201clooking forward to going places\\u201d \\u2014 including visiting his cousins \\u2014 \\u201cwithout worrying that I could get Covid-19.\\u201d\", \"Everett also had a suggestion for those running the clinic. \\u201cMaybe we should take an idea from the polio vaccine at Franklin Sherman,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEveryone should get ice cream after their shots.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8cddec1840f511ec9cbc79bc548c9b36"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8cddec1840f511ec9cbc79bc548c9b36"}},
