For example, a virus may mutate in such a way that it spreads around people more easily, or more slowly. It may mutate in such a way that antibodies find it harder to latch onto it.\", \"\\\"Viruses mutate or change themselves at random, all the time,\\\" Dr. Francesca Beaudoin, interim chair of epidemiology at Brown University in Rhode Island, said earlier this year.\", \"Most are inconsequential and fizzle out, she said, but some make the virus more effective.\", \"This is not unique to COVID-19. Other viruses mutate as well, some more than others. Flu viruses do this so often that a new flu vaccine is recommended every year.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How Many Mutations Does Omicron Have?</div>\", \"As mentioned, scientists flagged Omicron due to the large amount of mutations it has.\", \"Scientists in South Africa, Botswana, and Hong Kong have been widely praised within the scientific community for their work in sequencing the first cases of the variant and diligently sharing its information with the world on the GISAID virus network.\", \"The World Health Organization's (WHO) technical briefing on the variant states there are 45 to 52 mutations in its genetic profile overall compared to a \\\"reference strain.\\\"\", \"But scientists have largely highlighted the 26 to 32 mutations relevant to Omicron's spike protein. The spike protein is what the virus uses to enter human cells and make us sick.\", \"Laboratory studies are ongoing to figure out exactly what sort of differences these mutations make in terms of how Omicron infects people.\", \"It's hard to tell exactly how infectious a virus is based solely on what mutations it has, Aris Katzourakis, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Oxford, told the journal Science. \\\"But if we were looking out for mutations that do affect transmissibility, it's got all of them,\\\" he said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942104/coronavirus-illustration.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A stock image shows an artist's illustration of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
