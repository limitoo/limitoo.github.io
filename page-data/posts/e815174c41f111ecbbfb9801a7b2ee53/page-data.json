Things like replacing the 1m-plus rule on 19 July might well lead to a review of the way the app itself needs to function.\\\"\", \"But he said the app was still \\\"very important as one of the tools in our armoury\\\". He said there were still large numbers of people downloading it and said he had not seen any data showing people were deleting it.\", \"The most recent figures for the last week of June show an extra 300,000 downloads, bringing the total to more than 26 million, but it is not known how many people are active users.\", \"\\\"It's in our interests as a society to carry on doing the things that protect each other,\\\" Mr Shapps said.\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/640/cpsprodpb/1226D/production/_105894347_grey_line-nc.png' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">2px presentational grey line</div>\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1536/cpsprodpb/42A6/production/_112826071__106858962_zoekleinman_tr-nc.png' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Analysis box by Zoe Kleinman, technology reporter</div>\", \"Technically, it wouldn't be very difficult to tweak the app to make it less \\\"sensitive\\\" - the hard bit is working out exactly what those tweaks should be.\", \"Currently, two phones with the app installed, exchange a digital handshake, via bluetooth, every five minutes. It registers how far apart they are, and for how long.\", \"If one of those phones then goes on to report a positive Covid test, other phones who were two metres away or less, for a duration of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period, are likely to receive an isolation alert.\", \"As we have learned more about the virus, other factors have also been incorporated such as how infectious the person was likely to have been at the time the two phones were in close proximity.\", \"Changing those parameters would be straightforward.\", \"But fundamentally it's the volume of cases which are driving the volume of isolation alerts, not the app itself.
