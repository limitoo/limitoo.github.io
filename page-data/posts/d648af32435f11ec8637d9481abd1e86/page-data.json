Its conservation status has been listed as threatened-nationally critical due to predation and habitat loss.\", \"While the Department of Conservation is rejoicing at the first egg of the season, rangers have expressed concern about behaviour at another breeding site in Mangawhai, which occurred at around the same time as the egg was laid at Papak\\u0101nui.\", \"Craig Deal, the operations manager for the Department of Conservation's Whangarei branch, said an Auckland woman and her dog were forced to stay at the reserve overnight after her car became stuck in the soft sand. She was eventually escorted out of the dunes and the police were notified.\", \"It's understood the woman allegedly breached Auckland's alert level 3 boundary, which remains in place to curb the spread of COVID-19.\", \"\\\"Last weekend we came across a vehicle with an occupant and a dog parked in the dunes at the base of the wildlife refuge at Mangawhai. The person had breached the COVID-19 alert level 3 border restriction to enter the area and had got her vehicle stuck in the soft sand and had to stay overnight,\\\" Deal said on Thursday.\", \"\\\"She was escorted out of the reserve and police were notified. This will also be followed up with our DoC compliance officers for entering a wildlife refuge (breaching the Northland reserves bylaws) with a vehicle and a dog. Both are prohibited and may result in a $800 infringement notice.\", \"\\\"It\\u2019s concerning to see such a blatant breach of wildlife refuge and COVID-19 border rules, especially with the tara iti/fairy tern breeding season just starting.\\\"\", \"With less than 40 birds remaining in the country, the tara iti has teetered on the brink of extinction since the 1980s despite intensive management and conservation efforts.\", \"Tara iti nest on shell and sand banks, sometimes just above the spring high tide mark, which makes them vulnerable to stormy weather that coincides with high tides and strong winds.\", \"Tara iti are also vulnerable to predation and disturbance by people and vehicles, with all nest sites fenced off as a precaution.\\u00a0\", \"A dedicated team of seven rangers focused on tara iti conservation have been working alongside community organisations and volunteers since September to prepare for the breeding season, including traping predators near the nesting sites, fencing the sites off, and preventing nesting birds from being disturbed by humans. The rangers and volunteers will continue to monitor the birds and their nests during the breeding season.\", \"Once widespread around the North Island and eastern South Island, tara iti now only breed at the four main nesting sites - Papak\\u0101nui Spit, P\\u0101kiri Beach, and Waip\\u016b and Mangawhai sand spits.\", \"The department works closely with Patuharakeke, Ng\\u0101ti Wh\\u0101tua o Kaipara, Ng\\u0101ti Manuhiri, Ng\\u0101tiwai and Te Uri O Hau, The Shorebirds Trust, The NZ Fairy Tern Charitable Trust, About Tern, Birds NZ, Armourguard and the Waip\\u016b Trapping Group to help protect the native bird.\", \"To protect tara iti at their nesting sites, people are advised to follow these rules:\"]","href_hash":"d648af32435f11ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d648af32435f11ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
