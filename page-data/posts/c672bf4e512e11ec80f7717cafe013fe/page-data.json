Those people, if any, will then be directed to self-quarantine for 10 days even if they're vaccinated, and more testing will be introduced in parts of the country where new cases emerge, according to the BBC.\", \"Sturgeon said that there was no evidence pointing to any far-reaching community spread at this point, but the existing cases emphasize the importance of stopping the transmission in its tracks.\", \"\\\"Right now what I'm asking people to do is to up the level of compliance with all of the protections that are still in place,\\\" she said. \\\"These are protections, not restrictions.\\\"\", \"Countries throughout the world are taking action to prevent a proliferation of the variant, first identified days ago in South Africa, as scientists are still working to determine the danger it poses.

Little is known about it, including whether it is more contagious, more likely to cause serious illness or more able to evade the protection of vaccines.\", \"The WHO warned, however, that \\\"the likelihood of potential further spread of omicron at the global level is high.
