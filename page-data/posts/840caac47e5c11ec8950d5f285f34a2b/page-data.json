We have not yet been informed when any stock will be available, so all sales of RAT test products have been paused indefinitely,\\\" the company's website read.\\u00a0\", \"National's COVID-19 spokesperson Chris Bishop on Tuesday accused the Government of \\\"seizing rapid tests from the private sector to try and hide their incompetence from not ordering enough of them sooner\\\".\\u00a0\", \"But Dr Verrall said on Wednesday it was \\\"not the case\\\" that rapid antigen tests had been requisitioned by the Government.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"No one's tests have been requisitioned. There was no guarantee that anyone's forward orders were going to be filled,\\\" she told reporters.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It is the global supply situation that has led to the situation in which everyone's orders are difficult to confirm and the action that we have taken has made sure that more New Zealanders will get tests and that more businesses will be able to access them.\\\"\", \"Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfiel said no emergency powers were used, such as the Government's ability to requisition laboratory testing material, as well as equipment and staff.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We have discussed with our three main suppliers, which are Abbott, Roche and Siemens, that forward orders of tests that haven't yet arrived in the country be consolidated into the Government's stock so that it is there for the whole country, including private businesses,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We already have processes in place to supply businesses with tests if they are using them at the moment and that will continue, and in particular to support private businesses and the public sector to maintain critical workforce, including through that 'return-to work' approach, but also to make sure that our rapid antigen tests are used where they are needed.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"This is an interim measure while, as you know, there is extremely high demand on supply globally.\\\"\", \"Dr Bloomfield denied the Government was commandeering stock orders of private businesses.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The Ministry of Health is purchasing on behalf of the Government and that is to support the overall plan. Many businesses already have tests onshore and we're not requisitioning those or anything like that.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The issue that we are all facing is, we have orders in for around 40 million tests between now and the end of February but so far we only have confirmation for only around a third of those with exact dates for when they will arrive. This is the same for businesses.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"What we have said to those suppliers is, in the meantime, we will ensure that we are getting confirmation of those orders and getting them onshore, on behalf of all of New Zealand, including businesses.\\\"\", \"Dr Bloomfield said it began with a \\\"conversation\\\" with Abbott on Sunday about the timing of deliveries. With Omicron beginning to spread in New Zealand, the Government is trying to get its hands on as many tests as possible.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"During that conversation I was asked about the orders that other New Zealand-based companies had and I was asked about whether we should prioritise the delivery to that all-of-Government order and I said 'yes, that would be the priority for now',\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The challenge here isn't the size of the orders anyone has in. It's getting confirmation of the exact amount that can be delivered and when it can be delivered and it's changing on a daily basis.\", \"\\\"This was a conversation and this was about ensuring New Zealand as a whole has access to rapid antigen tests as much as possible to support not just businesses but other uses we will have.\\\"\", \"He said the Government isn't taking control away from businesses because the Government is working with them, though some businesses claim to have had no heads up.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We haven't specifically talked to businesses,\\\" Dr Bloomfield admitted.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"But I can reassure you there are plenty of conversations between businesses and colleagues at MBIE [Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment].\\\"\"]","href_hash":"840caac47e5c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"840caac47e5c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
