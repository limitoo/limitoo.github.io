However, the team's rebranding hit a snag last week when a roller derby team accused them of stealing their name.\", \"The removal of the script \\\"Indians\\\" sign that sits above the scoreboard could take several days, according to Cleveland.com. It is the first step in the team's transition into its new brand.\", \"The team decided to change its name in December 2020, since the name they used for 100 years is considered insensitive to indigenous peoples.\", \"In July, the team officially announced it would be called the Guardians, ending months of internal discussions triggered by a national reckoning among institutions and teams to permanently drop logos and names considered racist.\", \"The change will be effective at the end of the 2021 season. The players' uniforms and the team's social media still use\\u00a0the Indians branding, but with the World Series wrapping up this month, the team is expected to begin its transition to the Guardians soon.\", \"However, last week a Cleveland-based roller derby team \\u2013 also named the Cleveland Guardians \\u2013 sued the MLB franchise in federal court, CBS Sports reports. The derby team hopes to stop the team from using the name.\", \"\\\"Major League Baseball would never let someone name their lacrosse team the 'Chicago Cubs' if the team was in Chicago, or their soccer team the 'New York Yankees' if that team was in New York \\u2013 nor should they,\\\" lead attorney Christopher Pardo said in a statement on behalf of the derby team.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The same laws that protect Major League Baseball from the brand confusion that would occur in those examples also operate in reverse to prevent what the Indians are trying to do here,\\\" the statement reads. \\\"By taking the name 'Cleveland Guardians' overnight, the Indians knowingly and willfully eviscerated the rights of the original owner of that name \\u2013 the\\u00a0real\\u00a0Cleveland Guardians.\\\"\", \"The lawsuit alleges the MLB team knew the Guardians roller derby team already had the same name and that its lawyers made secret trademark filings on the small island of Mauritius \\\"in an effort to hide its intent to take the Guardians' name, and then reached out to tell the roller derby team of its plans,\\\" CBS Sports reports.\\u00a0\", \"CBS News has reached out to the MLB team for more information on its impending rebrand.\", \"The Indians are not the only team to face scrutiny over their name and branding. The Atlanta Braves has been criticized for its name\\u00a0 \\u2013 first used by the team in\\u00a01912\\u00a0as a term for Native American warrior \\u2013 and fans' use of the \\\"tomahawk chop.\\\" The hand motion, a chopping gesture that is a Braves' gameday tradition, is considered offensive to many Native Americans.\\u00a0\", \"Last week, while MLB commissioner\\u00a0Bob Manfred defended\\u00a0them, National Congress of American Indians President Fawn Sharp issued a statement in opposition to the continued use of the chop and team name.\\u00a0\", \"The Braves are currently in the World Series against the Houston Astros, and former President Donald Trump and wife Melania recently attended a game, where they were seen doing the tomahawk chop.\", \"An NFL team, the Washington Redskins, also received widespread criticism for its name \\u2013 an offensive slur toward Native Americans \\u2013 and changed it to the Washington Football Team in 2020.\", \"Caitlin O'Kane is a digital content producer covering trending stories for CBS News and its good news brand, The Uplift.\"]","href_hash":"3f24295c3be811ec8da1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3f24295c3be811ec8da1000017025a03"}},
