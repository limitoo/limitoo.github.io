That would allow the bill to go to the Senate as what is known as a \\u201cmessage,\\u201d meaning a move to bring it up for debate in that chamber would not be subject to a filibuster, and Democrats would not need to muster 60 votes to proceed.\", \"\\u201cTaking advantage of this existing exception to the Senate\\u2019s supermajority requirements will allow us to end the Republicans\\u2019 ability to block debate on voting rights legislation,\\u201d Mr. Schumer wrote in the memo. \\u201cThe Senate will finally debate voting rights legislation, and then every senator will be faced with a choice of whether or not to pass the legislation to protect our democracy.\\u201d\", \"Republicans have blocked four previous attempts to bring up voting rights legislation in the Senate, using the filibuster each time and leaving Democrats, who lack the 60 votes needed to get past the tactic, grasping for a way to even debate what they call vital measures to preserve democracy.\", \"Even under the expedited process, the legislation could still face another filibuster when Democrats try to close off debate and bring it to a final vote, and Republicans have given every indication that they would try to block it.\", \"If they do, Democrats have said they are ready to try to change Senate rules, a move endorsed by President Biden, who is scheduled to travel to Capitol Hill on Thursday to confer with Democrats on their strategy.\", \"It was unclear how quickly the House would act, but Mr. Schumer has set Monday\\u2019s holiday for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. as a deadline.\", \"The new approach came as Democrats stepped up their efforts to persuade their colleagues holding out against forcing through a rules change to join them, calling new voting restrictions being imposed at the state level a threat to democracy.
