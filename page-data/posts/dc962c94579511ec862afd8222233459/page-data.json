I was waiting for my first trauma therapy session with my third psychologist.\", \"By the time I was 19, I had reached a very dangerous cliff and I was teetering precariously on its edge.\", \"I had spent years convincing myself that I was fine. A couple of episodes of self-harm every month didn't mean I was spiralling, right? It was a normal response to stress, I'd thought, and the thoughts of suicide were just me internally being an attention-seeker, I reasoned.\", \"I believed, as I'd been told by so many people around me, that I simply wasn't praying enough, that Allah was angry with me, or that I was a weak, ungrateful and un-Islamic person.\", \"It's taken me years to realise my mental health struggles have no connection with my worth as a Muslim.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">The conversation we need to have</div>\", \"I have spent a significant amount of time in waiting rooms and in the offices of mental health professionals.\", \"The guilt that often accompanied those visits was suffocating, tiring and in hindsight, plain unnecessary.\", \"I'm speaking out because while there has been increased discussion of mental health in the Muslim community, we still struggle with the topic of suicide.\", \"But, as Desmond Tutu once said:\\u00a0\\\"There comes a point where we need to stop just pulling people out of the river.

It didn't \\\"cure\\\" me and it definitely did not inspire me to be patient.\", \"This way of thinking hinders our community. It makes mosques and spiritual spaces of learning less-welcoming to Muslim youth.\", \"And that, in turn, has alienated some Muslim youth from the Muslim part of their identity.\", \"I now wish, more than anything, that I had not lost my religion for a good four years of my life.
