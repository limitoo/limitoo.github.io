And then they killed him.\\\"\", \"Arbery's mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, could be heard groaning and sighing as the video was played in court, according to the pool reporter.\", \"Arbery's killing on February 23, 2020, was largely ignored until the video leaked and deepened a national reckoning over racial injustice.\", \"Greg McMichael and his adult son, Travis McMichael, armed themselves and pursued Arbery in a pickup truck as he ran through their neighborhood just outside the port city of Brunswick. A neighbor, William \\\"Roddie\\\" Bryan, joined the chase and recorded graphic video of Travis McMichael shooting Arbery three times.\", \"The chase started on a Sunday afternoon when a neighbor called a nonemergency police number after seeing Arbery wandering inside a home under construction, where security cameras had recorded him before.\", \"Greg McMichael saw Arbery run past his home and ran inside to alert his son. They grabbed guns, jumped in their truck and gave chase, Dunikoski said. Bryan joined them after seeing Arbery run past the McMichaels' truck outside his home.\", \"She said Greg McMichael later told police that at one point during the chase he shouted at Arbery, \\\"Stop or I'll blow your f--ing head off!\\\"\", \"When a police officer who responded to the shooting asked Greg McMichael if Arbery had broken into a house, he told the officer: \\\"That's just it. I don't know... I don't know, he might have gone in somebody's house,\\\" according to Dunikoski.\", \"\\\"All three of these defendants did everything they did based on assumptions - not on facts, not on evidence,\\\" Dunikoski said. \\\"And they made decisions in their driveways based on those assumptions that took a young man's life.\\\"\", \"Arbery's mother told \\\"CBS Mornings\\\" co-host Gayle King last month that she believes her son was targeted because of his race.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I do think that Ahmaud was murdered because he was Black,\\\" said Wanda Cooper-Jones. \\\"He was jogging through a predominantly White neighborhood and he was targeted.\\\"\", \"Defense attorneys planned to give their own opening statements later Friday.\", \"Georgia's response to the killing has become part of a broader effort to address racial injustice in the criminal legal system after a string of fatal encounters between police and Black people such as George Floyd in Minnesota and Breonna Taylor in Kentucky.\", \"Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley swore in the disproportionately White jury Friday before proceedings began. All three defendants are standing trial together, charged with murder and other felonies.\", \"Arbery had been dead for more than two months before the three men were charged and jailed last year. Greg McMichael, a retired investigator for the local district attorney, told police the men were trying to stop Arbery because they suspected he was a burglar. Security cameras had recorded him entering a nearby house under construction.\", \"Greg McMichael said his son killed Arbery in self-defense after Arbery attacked him with his fists and tried to take Travis McMichael's gun.\", \"Prosecutors say Arbery was merely out jogging, was unarmed and had committed no crimes in the neighborhood. When Bryan's video of the killing leaked online in May 2020, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case from local police. GBI agents arrested the McMichaels the next day, and charged Bryan two weeks later.\", \"The judge and attorneys took two and a half weeks to select a jury. Nearly 200 people summoned to jury duty were questioned extensively about what they knew about the case, how many times they had seen the video and if they had any personal connection to Arbery or the defendants.\", \"Controversy erupted on Wednesday, the final day of jury selection, when prosecutors objected to a final jury consisting of 11 White jurors and one Black juror. They argued that defense attorneys had cut eight potential jurors from the final panel because they are Black, which the U.S. Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional.\", \"The judge agreed that there appeared to be \\\"intentional discrimination,\\\" but said Georgia law limited his authority to intervene because defense attorneys stated non-racial reasons for excluding Black panelists from the jury.\", \"One juror, a White woman, was dismissed Thursday for medical reasons. Fifteen total panelists will hear the trial \\u2014 12 jurors plus three alternates. The judge has not given the races of the alternate jurors, and they were not asked to state their race in open court.\", \"Court officials have said the trial could last two weeks or more.\", \"If the defendants are acquitted, their legal troubles won't be over. They have also been indicted on federal hate crime charges. A U.S. District Court judge has scheduled that trial to begin February 7.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"6ff117723e6111ec95e609ac2c298154"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6ff117723e6111ec95e609ac2c298154"}},
