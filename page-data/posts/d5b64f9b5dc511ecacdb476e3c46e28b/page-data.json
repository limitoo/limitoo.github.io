Then things get dark.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-15T08:42:02.000Z","content":"[\"LONDON \\u2014 At first glance, it looks as if there\\u2019s a party happening at the Kit Kat Club, the refurbished London venue where a nerve-shredding revival of \\u201cCabaret,\\u201d starring Eddie Redmayne, opened last weekend.\", \"Entering a side door of what was once the Playhouse Theater, you snake your way along corridors not usually open to the public and into a labyrinthine demimonde of dancers and drinks: a recreation of a seedy, Weimar-era Berlin nightclub. The auditorium has lost 200 seats in its transformation into an immersive, plushly appointed space, complete with lamp-lit tables down front for a preshow meal. In the show\\u2019s hefty playbill, the brilliant designer Tom Scutt says he has tried to bring a \\u201cqueer irreverence\\u201d to the venue, which rewards close inspection of its details, like a splash of gold here and an art-nouveau flourish there.\", \"Yet the director, Rebecca Frecknall, is more interested in disturbing the audience than handing them a drink. Making a remarkable entry into musical theater after lauded productions of Chekhov and Tennessee Williams, Frecknall pulls us into a hedonistic milieu, only to send us out nearly three hours later reminded of life\\u2019s horrors.\", \"That\\u2019s as it should be given this 1966 musical by John Kander (music), Fred Ebb (lyrics) and Joe Masteroff (book) about \\u201cthe end of the world,\\u201d to cite a final observation from Cliff (Omari Douglas), an American writer in 1930s Germany who is alone among the show\\u2019s principals in sensing the danger of the Nazis\\u2019 rise. Frecknall\\u2019s main accomplice in darkening the mood is her Oscar and Tony-winning leading man, Redmayne, returning to the London stage for the first time in a decade. And there\\u2019s further assistance from the Irish actress-singer Jessie Buckley, an unusually ferocious Sally Bowles.\", \"Redmayne\\u2019s Emcee brings his own distinctly shape-shifting, sinuous quality to a role that can be hard to refresh: Many still associate it with a pancake-faced Joel Grey, who originated the part onstage and won an Oscar in the 1972 Bob Fosse film. Limping or crouching his way about the circular stage, a twitchy Redmayne initially calls to mind a demented marionette, his mouth as misshapen as his psyche.\", \"He first emerges in a burst of light, his body contorted during the startling opening number, \\u201cWillkommen,\\u201d a party hat clinging to the side of his tilted head. \\u201cLife is beautiful,\\u201d he says, but something about the gravelly voice and glazed smile suggest otherwise. Appearing bare-chested soon after in the manic number \\u201cTwo Ladies,\\u201d Redmayne\\u2019s Emcee is a devotee of debauchery whose true character is revealed in the antisemitic finish to \\u201cIf You Could See Her,\\u201d when a nasty slur comes as the song\\u2019s brutal kicker.\", \"Redmayne\\u2019s lyric tenor lends itself well to \\u201cTomorrow Belongs to Me,\\u201d the melodic Nazi anthem that sounds sweet enough until you grasp the lyrics. The song prefigures a moral decline that reaches a nadir in the Emcee\\u2019s second-act solo, \\u201cI Don\\u2019t Care Much.\\u201d With that number, cut from the original production but reinstated for various revivals, the Emcee\\u2019s assimilation into the Third Reich is complete.\", \"Frecknall shows that such transformations passed many onlookers by \\u2014 or that they were reluctant to take action while there was still time. The affair between the landlady Fraulein Schneider (the superb Liza Sadovy, in richly expressive voice) and the Jewish grocer, Herr Schultz (a likable Elliot Levey), is especially telling on this front. Fraulein Schneider sings in the wrenching \\u201cWhat Would You Do?\\u201d that she is too old and tired to counter \\u201cthe storm\\u201d she sees approaching; Herr Schultz, meanwhile, is convinced that German citizenship will save him. But when the Emcee raises a champagne flute to the couple, we hear the cacophonous glass-shattering of Kristallnacht.\", \"Sally Bowles exists in a self-deluded class of her own: an English expat in Berlin who is heralded as \\u201cthe toast of Mayfair,\\u201d but in Buckley\\u2019s take sometimes seems a scared and angry child. She sings \\u201cMaybe This Time\\u201d directly to Cliff, her lyrics about winning delivered quietly as if Sally were admitting to herself that her life has been a failure. And though she gives off the air of a thumb-sucking Shirley Temple when she first appears with \\u201cDon\\u2019t Tell Mama,\\u201d she roars the title number at the show\\u2019s climax full of fury and pain. \\u201cThe party\\u2019s over,\\u201d Cliff says: The festivities have become a farewell, and a world is about to crash.\"]","href_hash":"d5b64f9b5dc511ecacdb476e3c46e28b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d5b64f9b5dc511ecacdb476e3c46e28b"}},
