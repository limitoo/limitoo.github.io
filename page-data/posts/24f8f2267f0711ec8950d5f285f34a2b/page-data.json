Once I got told I was going to play midfield, I kind of reached out more to Tana and tried to pick his brains.\", \"\\\"I don't think there's anyone better than Tana there, defensively. [It's nice] having someone like that to fall back to and always ask questions.\\\"\", \"But it isn't just Umaga whose brain has been picked by Tuivasa-Sheck either.\\u00a0\", \"Before even deciding to switch back to union, where he enjoyed a successful time as a schoolboy, Tuivasa-Sheck was also in communication with multiple NRL converts, leading him to the decision to swap codes in 2022.\", \"\\\"A few years ago, when I was pondering the idea, I spoke to players like Ngani Laumape, Matt Duffie and Sonny [Bill Williams] of course.\", \"\\\"The one thing that came back from them was they just love the pre-season, love the breaks that they were getting compared to league. That was the big difference.\", \"\\\"For me, it was trying to make sure it all lined up with what my goals were, what was best for the family, and I'm glad I made the decision and I'm here now.\\\"\", \"For now though, Tuivasa-Sheck is still learning what it takes to be a successful player in the 15-man code.\", \"Expectation and interest is at an all-time high for Tuivasa-Sheck's first outing with the Blues - potentially against Moana Pasifika in their season opener on February 18.\", \"Arguably, Tuivasa-Sheck's first appearance in blue will mark the most anticipated Super Rugby debut in the competition's history.\", \"But for the star himself, dealing with the expectation on his shoulder is something he's continuing to deal with in his side's pre-season.\", \"\\\"That's the challenge I have with myself. I feel pretty lucky to have some good people around me, a good soundboard.\", \"\\\"Of course, I want to come in and put my best foot forward, make sure I start ticking the boxes right from the start, but understand that it's been a while since I've played some rugby.\", \"\\\"There's a lot of challenges, and I would be happy with the process, [and] continue to build as we go.\", \"\\\"Like Leon [MacDonald] was saying there's a lot of good stuff I can do at training, but when it comes to games it's a whole new page.\", \"\\\"I've got to keep enjoying the [lessons] as I go.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"24f8f2267f0711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"24f8f2267f0711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
