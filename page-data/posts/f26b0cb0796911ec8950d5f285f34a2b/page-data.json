calculated?</div>\", \"Dr Heggie said the Territory's potential \\\"peak\\\" date had been estimated by NT health experts using epidemiological data and \\\"complex calculations\\\".\", \"He said one factor experts considered was that the Territory had a transient population, with many residents travelling interstate over the Christmas period and newcomers expected to move to the NT this month.\", \"Dr Heggie said the peak would coincide with when people were returning to the NT, which brought with it the risk of importing cases from other states.\", \"Infectious diseases specialist Paul Griffin said people should take the projection with \\\"a grain of salt\\\" and not plan their lives around it.\", \"Dr Griffin said the number of\\u00a0COVID-19 cases across Australia was likely to be under-reported, which meant data used to make calculations was \\\"compromised\\\" and, therefore, predictions were \\\"fairly loose\\\".\", \"\\\"It's really hard to predict the peak with any accuracy,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Many factors\\u00a0could easily push that [projected peak date] back and it could be sooner.\\\"\", \"Dr Griffin said the Northern Territory\\u00a0would know it had
