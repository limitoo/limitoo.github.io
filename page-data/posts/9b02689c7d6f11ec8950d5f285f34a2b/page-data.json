If it is appropriate for your job, you can work from home. Talk to your employer about what is appropriate for you.\\\"\", \"It is these perceived inaccuracies that have really caught Kiwis' ire prompting one Twitter user to tell the Daily Mail columnist to check his facts:\", \"\\\"You actually learn how the traffic light system in NZ functions. Under the red light status social gatherings are limited to 100 vaccinated people or 25 if vaccine protocols aren\\u2019t followed.
