Children huddle over precariously built bonfires and parents hold babies to their chests while soldiers, behind thickets of razor wire, look on impassively. But the images from the Belarus-Poland border, however harrowing, shouldn\\u2019t be surprising: This is what the European Union\\u2019s migration policy looks like.\", \"Without doubt, the greatest share of blame for this humanitarian catastrophe \\u2014 in which thousands of migrants, many from Iraq and Syria, were penned into a freezing forest for weeks on end \\u2014 lies with Belarus\\u2019s leader, Aleksandr Lukashenko. In apparent retaliation for E.U. sanctions against his regime, his government shepherded people to the heavily fortified Polish border, where they faced only hardship and suffering. Though the government cleared the camps on Thursday, the damage has been done.\", \"Yet Mr. Lukashenko\\u2019s revenge was a calculated one: He exploited a problem the European Union has fashioned for itself. For the past six years, it has tried to shut out migrants from poorer and conflict-ridden countries \\u2014 through border walls, draconian policing and dubious deals with countries outside the bloc \\u2014 in fear of the political effects of large-scale migration.\", \"But the bargain has been self-deceiving. By displaying such panic and disarray at the prospect of migrants on its soil, the European Union has given authoritarian states a road map to blackmail. Unless the bloc finds a united response grounded in its founding values of tolerance and solidarity, Mr. Lukashenko will not be the last autocrat to weaponize people\\u2019s dreams of a better life.\", \"The problems started in earnest in 2015, when the chaotic arrival of more than one million people, the majority fleeing war and persecution in Syria, catapulted the question of migration to the top of the continent\\u2019s political agenda. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany\\u2019s initial welcome soon gave way to harsh statements and newly fortified borders. Thousands of migrants perished trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea, as search and rescue operations were scaled back. Others were warehoused in grim detention centers along the bloc\\u2019s fringes.\", \"Countries took note. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey, sensing the chance to establish some leverage over his neighbors, offered to help \\u2014 at a steep price. In 2016, the European Union struck a deal: Six billion euros, then about $6.6 billion, in return for Turkey stopping the nearly three million Syrian refugees on its soil leaving for Greece.\", \"Even before the crisis, the European Union had a habit of capitulating to the demands of autocrats, offering Libya\\u2019s Col. Muammar el-Gaddafi \\u20ac60 million in 2010 after he threatened an \\u201cinflux of starving and ignorant Africans.\\u201d Today, the bloc funds the Libyan Coast Guard, despite reports that much of the money is funneled to militia and human traffickers.\", \"For irregular migrants, the consequences are hellish. The Libyan Coast Guard returns people to detention centers where systematic rape, torture and murder have been widely documented. Under the deal with Turkey, people who arrive in Greece are meant to be sent back to Turkey, but instead they languish for years in overcrowded camps on Greek islands.\", \"Its moral authority sapped, the European Union has become vulnerable to threats from unscrupulous governments. When the bloc tries to censure Turkey over human rights, the rule of law or political repression, for example, Turkish officials often threaten to scrap the deal. In retaliation for Spain offering medical treatment to a Western Sahara independence leader, Morocco \\u2014 whose security services the European Union also funds \\u2014 temporarily halted policing of the border with the Spanish enclave of Ceuta in May.\", \"By design, the European Union is now dependent on the good will of autocratic regimes for the maintenance of its borders. Human misery has become an acceptable bargaining chip: The men, women and children on the Polish border were just the latest to be caught in the middle. Trapped between heavily armed Polish and Belarusian border guards, in freezing conditions and with meager food supplies, they faced a perilous situation. At least 11 people died.\", \"The European Union focused on Mr. Lukashenko, decrying his \\u201cinhuman\\u201d actions. But those words ring hollow when Poland, a member state, forced people back over the border and fired tear gas and water cannons at them. It also barred journalists, aid workers and international observers from the border zone. And yet, remarkably, Poland came under no pressure from the union to open its border to the most vulnerable. It instead enjoyed the bloc\\u2019s full support.\", \"European officials use the language of moral superiority and humanitarianism without the policies to back it up, weakening their authority to call out countries such as Belarus and Russia. They should start redressing those double standards immediately. In the first instance, the European Commission must pressure Poland \\u2014 wielding the threat, or even reality, of punishment \\u2014 to allow humanitarian access to the border zone where necessary and to process asylum claims of people on its territory.\", \"That should be the first step in a new approach to migration, opening more legal pathways for work visas and refugee resettlement, while developing a functioning asylum system in which the burden is shared throughout the bloc. None of this will be easy \\u2014 right-wing, anti-migrant sentiment is widely entrenched across the continent \\u2014 but the benefits would be broad. It would strengthen the bloc\\u2019s moral standing, for one, and open up its societies to the gains well-controlled migration can bring.\", \"But, fundamentally, it makes strategic sense. Chaotic scenes at borders are not a good look. By treating asylum seekers on its soil not as a worst-case scenario, but as a manageable situation to be met with compassion and solidarity, Brussels would send a powerful message to the world. Its antagonists would know that there would be no point trying to blackmail it in future.\", \"But if the bloc allows death and suffering to become the default, the line between authoritarian regimes and the European Union will blur even more. For those keen to undermine democracy and human rights, nothing could be better.\"]","href_hash":"2cbb6274490011ec8253bd69e116b2d2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2cbb6274490011ec8253bd69e116b2d2"}},
