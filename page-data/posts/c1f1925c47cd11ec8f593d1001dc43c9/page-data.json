The Italian dystopian coming-of-age drama \\u201cAnna,\\u201d premiering Thursday on AMC+, fulfills that requirement, for better and for worse.\", \"\\u201cComing of age\\u201d has a sinister meaning in \\u201cAnna,\\u201d whose adolescent characters die when they hit puberty, succumbing to the same virus that apparently killed off the world\\u2019s adult population four years before the show takes place. In its outlines, \\u201cAnna\\u201d mixes the children-in-extremis brutality of \\u201cLord of the Flies\\u201d and \\u201cHunger Games\\u201d with the itinerant post-apocalyptic dread of \\u201cThe Road.\\u201d Nothing new there.\", \"Also familiar, of course, is the idea of a deadly worldwide pandemic. Prominent in the opening credits are notes that Niccol\\u00f2 Ammaniti\\u2019s novel \\u201cAnna\\u201d was published in 2015 and that the six-episode series, which he wrote with Francesca Manieri and directed, was six months into filming when Covid-19 struck.\", \"What\\u2019s different about the show is less concrete but immediately apparent. It has a dreaminess, and a willingness to proceed by a haphazard kind of dream logic, that\\u2019s uncommon in episodic TV. And Ammaniti, whose directing experience consists of a mini-series adaptation of another of his novels, \\u201cThe Miracle,\\u201d has an eye for striking locations and images.\", \"Working with the cinematographer Gog\\u00f2 Bianchi and the production designer Mauro Vanzati, Ammaniti turns Sicily into an abandoned wonderland seen from a child\\u2019s point of view: a mix of carnival, reverie and limitless rubbish pile. \\u201cAnna\\u201d evokes a tradition of the fantastical in Italian cinema, from Fellini to Paolo Sorrentino, while remaining tied to its realistic, and sometimes harrowing and quite violent, action. Other references also pop into your mind as you watch: Spike Jonze\\u2019s \\u201cWhere the Wild Things Are\\u201d in the forest scenes; \\u201cAlice in Wonderland\\u201d and Dickens\\u2019s feral children in scenes set in a decaying Palermo mansion.\", \"The show\\u2019s real theme is storytelling in its mythical and fairy-tale modes, and the story focuses on a fairy-tale pair: a resourceful 13-year-old, the Anna of the title (Giulia Dragotto), and her younger half brother, Astor (Alessandro Pecorella, in a remarkably composed performance). They live a lonely and, under the circumstances, bucolic existence in the country house where their mother (Elena Lietti) brought them before her death. The mother\\u2019s bones now lie in state in an upstairs bedroom while Anna makes dangerous foraging trips into the city, telling Astor that he will he die if he ventures beyond the wooded property\\u2019s fence while she\\u2019s gone.\", \"Astor eventually learns that she\\u2019s lying, in a turn of events that separates the siblings and sets the story in motion. This sends Anna on a quest to find her brother, occasionally helped by Pietro (Giovanni Mavilla), a nice guy with a motorcycle, and nearly fatally hindered by two indolent twins holed up in what was their family\\u2019s grocery store.\", \"The long central portion of the series takes place in a villa commandeered by Angelica (Clara Tramontano), whom we see in flashbacks as a budding psychopath before the virus arrived. Now she has transformed herself into a theatrically costumed shaman, acting out what she remembers from reality-TV competitions and fashion magazines, and gathered a flock of younger children as her congregation. It\\u2019s a prepubescent, post-apocalyptic Burning Man, with the occasional blood sacrifice and wandering goat. Ammaniti does well with the spectacle of children enacting adulthood amid decorative squalor, and this is the strongest section, along with the early scenes in the forest.\", \"Not all of the peripatetic story\\u2019s byways are as interesting, and \\u201cAnna\\u201d has the opposite problem of many current mini-series adaptations: Instead of feeling stretched out, it feels as if Ammaniti was trying to pack too much in. (Because of the real-world pandemic, the series order was reduced from eight episodes.)\", \"The grocery-store subplot, with its torture-porn elements, is a distraction, and a late sequence on Mount Etna is visually stunning but dramatically sluggish. Anna\\u2019s rescue of Astor feels hurried along in order to get to another eye-catching set piece, this time on the shore and water at the Straits of Messina. Sometimes \\u201cAnna\\u201d feels less like a dystopian drama than a Sicilian travelogue.\", \"If you go along for the ride, though, Ammaniti keeps giving you things to look at: a dapper child sitting among the trunks of a banyan tree, a boy\\u2019s head encased in an Oz-like metal pail, an elephant plodding in lone majesty along an Italian beach. The end of the world rarely looked so good.\"]","href_hash":"c1f1925c47cd11ec8f593d1001dc43c9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c1f1925c47cd11ec8f593d1001dc43c9"}},
