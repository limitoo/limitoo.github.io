US Supreme Court is facing hearings on abortion laws that promise to set the parameters for the most dramatic month for reproductive rights in three decades.","country":"au","create_time":"2021-11-01T12:00:44.000Z","content":"[\"It's been two months since abortion became effectively illegal in Texas.\\u00a0\", \"On September 1, the Lone Star state enforced Senate Bill 8, known as \\\"SB8\\\", which deputises private citizens as bounty hunters to police anyone who helps someone get an abortion\\u00a0after six weeks of pregnancy.\", \"The bill makes no exceptions for pregnancies that are the result of rape or incest.\", \"Many women have been forced to travel out of state to seek abortions, while those without the means try to self-abort or carry their unwanted pregnancies to full-term.\", \"It's the most restrictive abortion ban in the country, but the law's unique legal structure is what makes it the most difficult to unpick.\", \"Described by some lawyers as \\\"evil, sinister genius\\\", SB8 places the onus on private citizens to enforce the law.\", \"Experts say Texas has designed the law to avoid federal court review and make it near impossible to challenge.\", \"Last month, the Federal Court suspended it, but it was overturned by appeal just days later.\", \"The Supreme Court, the highest court in the United States, which now has a conservative super-majority of 6-3 installed under Donald Trump, has twice declined to block the bill while lower court challenges play out.\", \"It's an indication of how the court's thinking has shifted to the right and sets the stage for the weeks ahead.\", \"On Monday, the Supreme Court heard opening arguments on whether the United States can even challenge the law.\", \"Whether the bill undermines the constitutional right to abortion enshrined in law under Roe v Wade in 1973 is not even at issue.\", \"But the hastily scheduled hearings will set the parameters for the most dramatic month for reproductive rights at the Supreme Court in three decades.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">The Texas ruling could be a sign of what's to come in Mississippi</div>\", \"Before delving too deep\\u00a0into the Texas bill, it's important to note the Supreme Court has also agreed to examine another case,\\u00a0this time challenging a 2018 law out of Mississippi.\\u00a0\", \"The Mississippi case directly asks the justices to overrule Roe v Wade precedent and ban all abortions after 15 weeks, before foetal viability.\", \"<img

procedures of the 1960s and 70s.(AP:\\u00a0Stephen Spillman)</div>\", \"If the Supreme Court upholds that ruling, it would open the floodgates to a slew of other\\u00a0abortion bans across the country.\\u00a0\", \"Ten conservative states have passed so-called trigger laws to automatically ban abortions if Roe v Wade is undermined.\\u00a0\", \"Another 12 states are expected to pass new abortion laws in the current conservative legal environment.\\u00a0\", \"With just a month until the highest court in the land hears the Mississippi case\\u00a0\\u2014 previously its only blockbuster abortion case this term \\u2014\\u00a0the language used at the Texas hearing could provide clues as to which way the court may fall.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How is Senate Bill 8 different to other abortion laws?</div>\", \"What makes SB8 unusual is that it empowers citizens to sue anyone who \\\"aids or abets\\\" an abortion after cardiac activity is detected at around six weeks.\", \"This includes\\u00a0not just doctors, nurses and health workers, but even drivers\\u00a0transporting people to clinics.\", \"Typically, a statute that aims to prohibit some sort of activity will address it to the state actors who enforce the law and make it a crime.\", \"Individuals can then sue the state to prevent enforcement of the law and get judicial review.\", \"Former US attorney Barbara McQuade said the drafters of SB8 made it virtually impossible to challenge until there's a violation, which is what the Supreme Court will now rule on.\", \"\\\"That's really having a chilling effect on people who say 'I don't want to violate [the law] because then I might be exposed to $US10,000 in civil damages,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"It's causing abortion providers to stop providing abortions.\", \"\\\"The United States has said that is unconstitutional, a state can't effectively halt a constitutional right just by craftily drafting a statute that evades judicial review.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Two challengers are taking on the Texas ban</div>\", \"The Supreme Court will hear arguments in two different challenges against the Texas ban, one brought by abortion providers in the state and the other by the Justice Department.\\u00a0\", \"Both challengers say the law is at odds with Roe v Wade and the 1992 follow-up case of Planned Parenthood v Casey, which prevents states from banning abortions before foetal viability at around 24 weeks.\", \"But shifting enforcement of the law from state officials to private citizens means cases must be heard in state court, and only after the civil suit is filed.\", \"Marc Hearron, the attorney acting on behalf of the Texas abortion providers, said the unique law had effectively \\\"weaponised the court system\\\".\", \"Elizabeth Prelogar, the new US solicitor general, representing the department, said the law violated the court's precedent and was clearly designed \\\"to thwart judicial review by offering bounties to the general public to carry out the state's enforcement function\\\".\", \"Texas attorney-general Ken Paxton previously filed a single brief in both cases, arguing neither the federal government nor the providers were entitled to sue.\\u00a0\", \"The right way to challenge the law, Mr Paxton said, was for abortion providers to violate it, be sued in state court, and present constitutional or other arguments as defences.\", \"Ms McQuade believes out of the two lawsuits, the challenge by the United States is more likely to succeed because it is able to argue the law causes harm.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The Department of Defence, the Bureau of Prisons and Refugee Resettlement Facilities are in the business of performing abortions, we pay under the Medicare program to cover abortions, so we are being injured at this moment.\\u00a0So I think \\u2026 their direct injury argument is stronger,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Supreme Court could combine the Texas and Mississippi laws for review</div>\", \"The court could take a few weeks to make a ruling on whether the Justice Department and private abortion providers can challenge the law.\", \"Another wildcard is whether the bench chooses to combine the Texas and Mississippi bills for review.\", \"\\\"The court could well say, 'We hereby overrule Roe v Wade and the states do have a right to limit abortion rights.' That could happen,\\\" Ms McQuade said.\", \"\\\"Then there are these trigger laws, which are [dependent] upon that ruling. In a number of states, abortion would become illegal immediately.\", \"\\\"What we would see is either a return to the kind of back-alley abortions that we saw before Roe v Wade in the 60s and 70s, [or] we'd see people with means travelling to states where abortion rights are still recognised and you can obtain an abortion.\", \"\\\"I think poor women, who don't have access to travel and the ability, will have unwanted births.\", \"\\\"So we'll return to life as we knew it before Roe and the kinds of infections and deaths that occurred without proper medical care for abortions.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/6f6a1eeb2f54f8b7e9300b9bb30b5815\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Many conservatives see the current 6-3 make-up of the Supreme Court as the best chance to ban abortions outright.(Reuters:\\u00a0Evelyn Hockstein\\u00a0)</div>\", \"The rush to challenge abortion rights is being driven by conservatives across the country who see the make-up of the Supreme Court as their best chance in decades to ban the procedure outright.\", \"The court must look at precedent when making such a decision \\u2014 for instance, whether the law is now an outlier and not representative of societal views, or\\u00a0whether the facts and society's understanding of the issue are vastly different to what they were almost 50 years ago.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I know there has been some argument that our understanding of when life begins has changed and has evolved since 1973 when Roe was decided \\u2014 that science has changed,\\\" Ms McQuade said.\", \"\\\"I suppose if that's what they rely on that would be a more legitimate basis for making a decision.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"But I think this question of when life begins is very much a question of religious belief.\", \"\\\"Religious belief, genuinely and sincerely held by people who are Christian or whatever religion they are, cannot dictate the outcome in a secular society about when life begins.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">The man whose vote could decide future abortion rights</div>\", \"All eyes will be on Chief Justice John Roberts.\", \"He drew significant attention in September by splitting with his fellow Republican appointees to join the court's three liberal justices in dissent when the court refused to block SB8.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/94d6aad9ab2dffa1fc8e7a48e405fc7d\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Chief Justice John Roberts has sided with liberal justices in ruling anti-abortion laws unconstitutional\\u00a0in the past.(AP: Rogelio V.
