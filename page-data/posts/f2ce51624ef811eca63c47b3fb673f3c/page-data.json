like an eternity online, choirs in states like NSW and Victoria are now slowly going back to face-to-face singing.\", \"The pandemic might have spawned a myriad of smiling happy Zoom choirs, but virtual group singing can be a poor substitute for the real thing, says Nicki Johnson from Community Music Victoria.\", \"\\\"We don't sing as fully and as freely when we're in front of a screen,\\\" Ms Johnson says.\", \"People also report being sick of the sound of their own voice, she adds, as\\u00a0currently there's no easily accessible technology that allows online choir members to hear each other in real time.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/cff88683ec6a8923365e075364ae82d2\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Virtual choirs\\u00a0have their limitations.</div>\", \"Sydney-based chorister John Rothwell found online rehearsing \\\"socially unrewarding\\\".\", \"\\\"Rehearsing by Zoom destroys half the reasons for being in a choir, because you're not with people.\\\"\", \"Ms Johnson describes\\u00a0participatory music-making as a social lubricant that helps combat social isolation.\", \"\\\"It accelerates people's ability to feel comfortable and belong to a group,\\\" she\\u00a0says.\", \"Singing also benefits physical\\u00a0health\\u00a0and is even used as a therapy for respiratory conditions,\\u00a0even long COVID.\", \"But singing developed the reputation of being a particularly risky activity at the start of pandemic, and this has meant choirs were among the first activities to be restricted, and\\u00a0among the last to be given freedoms.\", \"This has made lockdowns particularly hard for those who depend on them to connect with people.\", \"\\\"I think it's mostly the loneliness and frustration of not being able to connect and experience embodied music-making,\\\" Ms Johnson says.\", \"Mr Rothwell understood the need to close down choirs but says, \\\"it really hurt\\\".\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/50c2823b84fc44512cc9a58d2ecb5a58\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Many believe there's nothing quite like group singing to unite and uplift humanity, and yet choirs have had a bad time of it lately.(Supplied: Lorraine Manifold)</div>\", \"And freedoms given to other activities \\u2014 from community sports to weddings \\u2014\\u00a0ahead of any specific advice relating to choirs returning\\u00a0has felt unfair to many in the community music world.\", \"\\\"It's been difficult feeling like there's double standards,\\\" says Hunter Valley-based conductor and chorister Mina van Bree.\", \"Uncertainty around whether choirs can rehearse, and under what conditions, has also been an issue for those who earn their income from conducting, especially as venues are reluctant to take a risk if governments do not specifically mention choirs as restrictions lift.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">The risk of vocalisation</div>\", \"But perceptions of unfairness aside, what are the COVID-related risks of choir singing?\", \"Singing produces a particularly high level of respiratory particles (aerosols), which could potentially contain coronavirus.\", \"If a singer is infected, they risk infecting others in the room via the air they breathe, especially since singing involves people inhaling deeply as well.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/cf8790c480343c420782ca935202c9b7\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Research has shown choirs are good for physical and mental wellbeing.(Supplied: Nicky Johnson)</div>\", \"This is exactly what happened back in March 2020 when the Skagit Valley Chorale in Washington held what was to become a fatal rehearsal for two of their members.\", \"Air quality expert Lidia Morawska, from the Queensland University of Technology, has published on the Skagit Valley Chorale outbreak and says poor ventilation was a key factor in preventing aerosols from dissipating.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It was cold, so the doors and windows were closed and there was no mechanical ventilation,\\\" Professor Morawska says.\", \"And studies have shown the infection risk could have been halved with a shorter choir practice, reducing the length of time people were exposed.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What does it take to have a COVID-safe choir?</div>\", \"While many choristers may think that restricting their group to people who are vaccinated will protect them, evidence suggests\\u00a0that\\u00a0vaccination alone is not enough.\", \"Professor Morawska says in addition to vaccination, singers need to\\u00a0improve ventilation\\u00a0and keep their distance from each other.\", \"\\\"Singers need to be\\u00a0at least 1-2 metres apart, the further the better, but accepting that they still need to hear each other.\", \"\\\"The risk remains, but if we have all these layers, we are reducing the risk \\u2014\\u00a0and particularly the risk of severe cases.\\\"\", \"Some experts also\\u00a0suggest\\u00a0rapid antigen testing immediately before practice or performance could also help reduce the chance of asymptomatic infectious people being present at choir.\", \"<img

with\\u00a0windows they can't open, and rely on the building manager to set mechanical controls.\", \"\\\"We only have air conditioning in the venue where we rehearse,\\\" Ms van Bree says.\", \"In the absence of regulations governing indoor air quality, Professor Morawska recommends groups check the quality of ventilation in their venue with a handheld carbon dioxide meter (which measures the amount of people's outbreath circulating in the room).\", \"If the meter gives you a high reading and you can't open windows, consider taking a break until levels go down.\", \"While portable air cleaners with HEPA filters can help reduce risk, some experts have warned against the use of devices with unproven technology.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">A mixed appetite for risk</div>\", \"COVID

\"\\\"We're going to err on the side of caution,\\\" she says.\", \"But others can't wait that long.\", \"\\\"Some are so desperate to sing and feel other voices around them, and hear harmony, that
