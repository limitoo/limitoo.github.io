It began after a neighbor in the South Slope neighborhood where Mr. Le Vine lives posted on the community bulletin board Nextdoor.com.\", \"\\u201cA WW2 Vet lives on 18th St. He\\u2019s 97, lives alone, and may not see another Veterans Day,\\u201d she wrote on Tuesday. \\u201cPlease consider leaving a little token of gratitude.\\u201d\", \"The soldiers and sailors of Mr. Le Vine\\u2019s generation are vanishing quickly now. Nearly 99 percent of the 16 million Americans who served in the war have died, according to the National World War II Museum. There are fewer than 5,000 World War II vets left in New York City.\", \"Mr. Le Vine said that as far as he knew, none of the men he served with are still around. And so, he said, he usually spends Veterans Day doing exactly \\u201cnothing.\\u201d\", \"But by Wednesday evening, the tributes had begun. As Mr. Le Vine was taking out the trash, a woman he\\u2019d never met handed him an envelope with \\u201cJack the Hero\\u201d written on it. \\u201cI just want to thank you for your service,\\u201d she said.\", \"Then a man who lives down the block walked up with his two children and handed Mr. Le Vine a thick stack of cards that the children and their classmates had made. \\u201cYou\\u2019ll be reading these for days,\\u201d said the man, Chris Polony.\", \"When Mr. Le Vine poked his head out Thursday morning, on the bench inside the gate where he and his wife used to sit, someone had left a potted amaryllis and a card tied to it with a drawing of a soldier in camouflage. \\u201cThank you for fighting for our country. From Abigail, age 7.\\u201d\", \"On the porch by the screen door were two more letters. Mr. Le Vine, a slight but entirely unbowed man who for the record will not be 97 till January, bent and picked them up. \\u201cThese people must love me on this block!\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Le Vine, one of seven children, joined the Navy a few weeks before his 18th birthday because his oldest brother had been drafted into the Army and warned him against it: \\u201cHe came home from basic training and he said, \\u2018All they teach you is to crawl around on your hands and knees in the mud. You get all slopped up.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The Navy, he said, promised \\u201ccleaner living.\\u201d He served two years in the Pacific on the U.S.S. Lesuth, then was a machinist\\u2019s mate first class on the U.S.S.

I took care of her six or seven years.\\u201d\", \"Hanging from the knob is a vest with medals, still displayed from when he taught World War II history to a group of local children in the living room a few years ago. Mr. Le Vine pointed to the chairs still lined up along the wall.\", \"Then he spotted movement out the window, behind the blinds. \\u201cIs somebody coming?\\u201d A woman left another card. Beside it were a miniature cypress tree, and another card, and a bakery box tied up with string that Mr. Le Vine recognized as the handiwork of a neighbor. \\u201cThat\\u2019s her famous banana bread.\\u201d\", \"The woman who posted on Nextdoor, Elizabeth Dowling, 44, said Mr. Le Vine had been a friend since she moved to the block about nine years ago. She said she had reached out to her neighbors because \\u201cwhen our vets return home, they\\u2019re often forgotten and ignored.\\u201d\", \"A few minutes later there was another rustling. Mr. Le Vine went to the door and stopped \\u2014 \\u201cNo, wait a minute\\u201d \\u2014 to grab a ball cap from a hook. \\u201cWorld War II Veteran,\\u201d it said. \\u201cProudly Served.\\u201d\", \"Outside were a mother on in-line skates and twin 8-year-olds on scooters.
