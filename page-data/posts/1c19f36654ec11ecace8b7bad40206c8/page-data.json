David Thompson, vice chief of space operations, sounded the alarm last month that the U.S. was \\\"not as advanced\\\" as the Russians, or the Chinese \\\"in terms of hypersonic programs,\\\" Politico reported.\", \"At Mach 9, the Tsirkon missile is at the low end of the hypersonic spectrum and has been launched several times since January 2020 from the Northern Fleet's Admiral Gorshkov. Moscow says it can hit targets at a range of up to 1,000 kilometers (660 miles).\", \"\\\"Assuming that the weapon is dual-use, that is both conventional and nuclear-capable, I think it changes the nuclear balance versus the United States,\\\" said Brent M. Eastwood, Defense and National Security Editor for Washington, DC foreign policy magazine 1945.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945059/russian-president-vladimirputin.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin in Moscow, on December 2, 2021. He has warned NATO not to give military backing to Ukraine whose border is being stared down by Russian troops.</div>\", \"\\\"Aegis needs eight to ten seconds of reaction time to intercept incoming missiles. However, in that time, the Tsirkon will have already traveled at least 12 miles,\\\" he said, \\\"and we must worry that Tsirkon could have an accidental launch that could spark a nuclear exchange.\", \"\\\"It's an intriguing weapon for the Russians that shows their missile development prowess and ability for it to be used as a propaganda talking point for Putin.\\\"\", \"Developed by the rocket design bureau Mashinostroyeniya NPO, the Tsirkon was not even among the five nuclear capability weapons programs, dubbed \\\"super weapons\\\" which Putin revealed to lawmakers at Russia's Federal Assembly in March 2018.\", \"Four of those, the Sarmat, Avangard, Poseidon and Burevestnik, are strategic systems in that they are all long-range weapons, with a range greater than 5,000 km (3,100 miles). The Kinzhal, is a sub-strategic system with a range less than that.\", \"However, over the last few months, state-run media has made much of successful launches of the Tsirkon, although there is doubt among experts over whether it has reached the 1,000 kilometer (660 mile) range Moscow has claimed.\", \"The Tsirkon, unlike the pure hypersonic missiles which rely on scramjets, has aslo required a degree of ingenuity as it combines existing technologies.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1852069/russia-admiral-gorshkov-fires-tsirkon-missile.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Russia's lead Admiral Gorshkov-class frigate test-fires the Tsirkon hypersonic cruise missile from the White Sea.

A detachable warhead is used to destroy the target when it is in range.\", \"\\\"It would appear they are a hybrid cruise missile and ballistic missile,\\\" said Richard Connolly, director of the Eastern Advisory Group consultancy, \\\"it is a lower tech approach but it is innovative and you still get to the same destination.\\\"\", \"\\\"What the Russians have done is cut the corner and said 'let's abandon the idea of trying to out compete with China and the U.S. with a pure system with a scramjet and instead use a hybrid technology.\\\"\", \"\\\"I can't see anything that suggests that Tsirkon is doing things that the U.S. can't do, they have just chosen to take another route.\\\" However, he believes that Russia has \\\"moved ahead a little\\\" in its missile development, \\\"but not as much as they would like you to think.\\\"\", \"In October, Russia said that it had successfully test-fired the missile from its Severodvinsk submarine in the Barents Sea for the first time. If confirmed, this could change military capability calculus because submarines can launch long-range rapid strikes from hidden locations underwater.\", \"But Connolly, who co-wrote an assessment of Russia's military capabilities in analysis by the Chatham House think tank, said it appears that the launches were unsuccessful.\", \"Meanwhile, last month Russia's defence ministry suggested there was more to be done. It said further Tsirkon tests would resume from the Project 885M (Yasen-M) modified nuclear-powered submarine Perm 2024, and \\\"will differ from its predecessors by a slightly altered design,\\\" news agency Tass reported.\", \"There has been progress in testing of the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) Sarmat, the Avangard missile system and the Kinzhal, in which Iskander ground-launched ballistic missile are launched by the MiG-31K missile carrier.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945066/ukrainian-servicemen.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Ukrainian servicemen in joint military exercises with the U.S. and other NATO countries near Lviv, Ukraine on September 24, 2021.
