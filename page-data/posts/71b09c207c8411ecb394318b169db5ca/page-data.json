The next year, Prince Philip was infamously awarded\\u00a0one of the revived titles.\", \"The past decade has seen increasing scrutiny of the gender balance\\u00a0in the awards, while individual honours, such as those given to writer Bettina Arndt\\u00a0and tennis champion Margaret Court, have also drawn criticism.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f3649bb61ab6cb309e125956ea2e9b27\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The decision to recognise former tennis great Margaret Court with an Australia Day Honour was met with backlash.\\u00a0(ABC News: Herlyn Kaur)</div>\", \"This is not necessarily out of keeping with the longer history of the honours system. Australians have long been arguing about both the shape of the honours system, and how it ought to be used.\", \"In my new book, Honouring a Nation, I provide the first detailed history of honours in Australia, from the First Fleet to 2021.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Should Australia have titles?</div>\", \"Australians have always been ambivalent about having an honours system that sets some people above others.\", \"In particular, the question of whether titles of honour \\u2014 like knighthood and damehood \\u2014 are appropriate in an egalitarian democracy has been a mainstay of debates. A common argument in the Australian colonies before Federation was that such titles did not belong here. As the South Australian Kapunda Herald put it\\u00a0in 1890:\", \"Opposition to titles was not merely rhetorical. David Buchanan, a member of the New South Wales House of Assembly, tried on several occasions to get the House to pass resolutions against them. In April 1884, for instance, he made an unsuccessful motion\\u00a0that granting titles was:\", \"Of course, not everyone agreed \\u2014 particularly if titles were merited rewards for real service or achievement, which might inspire others. Rockhampton's Morning Bulletin in 1887, for example, considered\\u00a0it entirely appropriate:\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Women under-recognised</div>\", \"The paper's reference to \\\"a man\\\" was not coincidental. In the 19th century, women were largely ineligible to receive honours or titles in their own right. By the final years of the century, some were advocating for this to change.\", \"With the establishment of the Order of the British Empire\\u00a0\\u2014 created in Britain as a means to reward the war services of the population in 1917 \\u2014 women began to enter the honours system in significant numbers. Australians, too, received this new honour, as Australians received awards solely through the British system until 1975, when the Order of Australia\\u00a0was established.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0699975b9cedfb877439d0dcc05eb8c7\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Carol Kiernan, Elizabeth Hartnell-Young and Ruth McGowan OAM founded Honour a Woman to advocate for gender equality in the honours.\\u00a0(Honour a Woman)</div>\", \"Eerily familiar complaints about women's poor treatment in honours lists were soon appearing, however. In 1930, Australian newspapers reported\\u00a0protests from women's activists in Britain, who argued aviator Amy Johnson wasn't given an award commensurate with her achievement of flying solo from England to Australia. The Women's Freedom League described this as \\\"inadequate and inappropriate\\\", while also expressing \\\"disappointment\\\" that \\\"so few honours have been conferred on women\\\".\", \"Such criticisms have been increasingly evident in Australia in recent years. In 2017, lobby group Honour a Woman\\u00a0was established to seek gender parity in the system.\", \"While there is still some way to go, there have been signs of change. The proportion of recipients who are women has increased\\u00a0from 21 per cent of the total in 1975 to 42 per cent in 2020. And in June 2018 women outnumbered men\\u00a0in appointments to the highest grade, the Companion (AC), for the first time.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What type of service gets honoured?</div>\", \"One factor explaining women's unequal experience of the honours system has been the tendency for local community service to be rewarded at the lower levels of the system. Meanwhile, contributions in professional fields like politics and business, which have historically been dominated by men, tended to attract higher level awards.\", \"Calls for better recognition of community work, and especially volunteers, are a common thread in conversations about honours. Research conducted for a federal government review of the system in 1995, for instance, showed Australians wanted the system to reward those who served the community, acted with heroism, or achieved medical or scientific advances \\u2014 rather than those who simply did a prominent job.\", \"Others across the decades have expressed their desire to see particular occupational fields attract more awards. Teachers, doctors and nurses, clergy, and those in the arts \\u2014 as well as, more recently, those working on the COVID-19 frontline \\u2014 are among those who have been suggested, at various times, to deserve greater numbers of honours.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">When the Queen visited in 1954</div>\", \"One of the most distinctive aspects of Australia's experience of honours was the divide over their use between Labor and non-Labor parties for many years. While non-Labor governments regularly recommended Australians for British honours prior to the creation of the Order of Australia in 1975, Labor governments tended not to do so.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f69848cc8be905c1fb734abc7138240b\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip made a high-profile visit to Australia in 1954.(Wikimedia)</div>\", \"This divide led to a short but intense controversy in 1954, during the highly anticipated tour of Australia by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip. As was common during such tours, the Queen issued a number of awards in connection with her visit, including to some of those involved in organising it.\", \"In Victoria, however, then Labor premier John Cain blocked decorations for royal tour staff in his state. While Cain cited Labor's \\\"long-standing\\\" policy\\u00a0against imperial honours in explanation, the leader of the Victorian Liberal Party, Henry Bolte, lambasted\\u00a0the decision as \\\"stupid and ridiculous\\\".\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Proxies for larger debates</div>\", \"The history of honours in Australia shows that, both before and after the creation of the Order of Australia as the nation's own unique honour, Australians have been debating the system's form, function and fairness.\", \"These debates have often been proxies for other, larger conversations about identity and values, the country's relationship to its British heritage, and concepts of merit and recognition.\", \"The history of honours is, in many ways, a history of Australia itself.\", \"Karen Fox is a Senior Research Fellow at the National Centre of Biography, Australian National University.
