vaccine boosters four months forward in response to the Omicron variant.\", \"Health authorities yesterday confirmed another two cases of the \\\"variant of concern\\\" after conducting urgent genomic testing on two overseas travellers who flew in from southern Africa.\", \"The number of Omicron cases in NSW now stands at four, with another in the Northern Territory inside the Howard Springs quarantine facility.\", \"Four members of OzSAGE, an 80-member\\u00a0multi-disciplinary network of Australia's leading experts, held a panel yesterday to discuss how the country could reduce the risks of further lockdowns.\", \"The panel\\u00a0offered independent expert advice and reiterated federal government calls to raise vaccination uptakes.\", \"It also called for booster shots,\\u00a0currently administered at six months after the second dose, to instead be given at two months.\", \"Karina Powers, an occupational physician and councillor\\u00a0of the\\u00a0Australian Medical Association in WA, said \\\"we need a three-dose vaccination strategy as soon as possible\\\".\", \"\\\"A third dose from as early as two months \\u2026 is needed because waning immunity begins approximately two-to-three months after the second dose of the vaccine,\\\" Dr Powers said.\", \"\\\"OzSAGE believes the Omicron epidemic may be curtailed by\\u00a0this third dose and a communication campaign to encourage the third dose is important.\\\"\", \"She said the federal government also needed\\u00a0to urgently negotiate for Omicron-matched boosters currently\\u00a0being developed by\\u00a0pharmacies as well as\\u00a0new anti-viral treatments.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/09b0e0a5b14b3b6f0157580843a99af6\\\"

still working to understand Omicron, Dr Powers said masks in indoor settings and contact tracing measures like QR codes \\\"should not be lost\\\".\", \"Both of these will be largely scrapped under the NSW government's updated roadmap for easing restrictions when the state reaches its 95 per cent double-dose vaccination target or on December 15, whichever comes first.\", \"QR code check-ins in NSW on this day\\u00a0will be scaled back to only high-risk settings such as hospitals, aged and disability care facilities, gyms, places of worship, funerals and beauty venues.\", \"NSW has introduced new rules that mean those still permitted to arrive from eight south African nations \\u2014 Seychelles was removed from countries of concern last night \\u2014 must isolate in a health facility for 14 days.\", \"The tightened travel rules mean passengers arriving in NSW from anywhere in the world must now isolate at their place of residence or accommodation for 72 hours.\", \"Architect and managing director of ARINA and adjunct professor at the University of Adelaide, Geoff Hanmer, said isolating for 72-hours was \\\"better than nothing\\\", but reverting to a 14-day quarantine was more prudent.\", \"\\\"Despite the obvious and heartbreaking consequences of that, if we don't have effective quarantine, we could have widespread disruption across the holiday season,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We all want to have Christmas with our families, but we have to very careful what we do over the next week or so.\\\"\", \"The panel said rapid action was needed to protect vulnerable communities.\", \"\\\"Aboriginal communities, particularly in some remote areas, they can be in very crowded housing,\\\" Dr Powers said.\", \"\\\"We know this variant appears at this stage to be transmissible between individuals with much greater effect that even Delta.\", \"\\\"So we really do need to put in all the controls we possibly can to prevent people becoming sick.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5d844ed63048c2469b68cb3ecde5796b\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> What COVID-19 travel insurance
