The figures on which had pre-existing conditions released on Friday go up to Wednesday, when the death toll was 32.\\u00a0\", \"Of those, nine had cardiovascular disease. This is not unexpected, since the elderly are not only most at risk of dying from COVID-19, but more likely to have cardiovascular disease.\\u00a0\", \"The second-most common pre-existing condition was diabetes, which affected seven of the victims. Type 2 diabetes is also more prevalent in older age groups, while obesity is a known risk factor for COVID-19. Around a third of all Kiwi adults are considered obese.\\u00a0\", \"Five of the 32 had chronic lung disease, four neurological or neuromuscular disease and two renal failure.\\u00a0\", \"One was listed as having 'malignancy', while eight were listed with 'other underlying condition'. It's not clear how many had no pre-existing conditions known to be risk factors, as the ministry notes some might have had more than comorbidity.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Deaths being investigated by the coroner will remain under investigation until the coroner\\u2019s finding has been determined,\\\" a Ministry of Health spokesperson said in a statement. \\\"The ministry will report this information daily on its website.\\u00a0 This reflects that it can take some time for the coroner to determine their findings.\", \"\\\"Work is also underway at the ministry to look at how further information on those who have died with COVID-19 can be reported such as comorbidities in a way that protects the private medical information of those involved.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"bc0e94b4433d11ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bc0e94b4433d11ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
