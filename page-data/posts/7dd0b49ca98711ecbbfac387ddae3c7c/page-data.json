The baby's sex is yet to be confirmed.\", \"Meanwhile, the Zoo says Melur has stepped up to the plate of motherhood with great success.\", \"\\\"So far, Melur is proving to be an exceptionally attentive mum, and her baby has a strong suckling reflex and a healthy grip - both signs he/she is thriving.\\\"\", \"\\\"She's particularly enjoying making huge nests and cuddling up to her baby in the orang-utans inside area - ensuring she holds the baby in the correct position for nursing and is being very gentle and nurturing.\\\"\", \"Today was the family's first chance to venture into their high canopy habitat with the new baby, however, the Zoo said that was all up to Melur and whether she was comfortable doing so.\", \"They said that meant visitors might not see Melur and her baby immediately.\", \"Auckland Zoo deputy curator of mammals Amy Robbins said the birth was incredible to witness,\", \"\\\"Melur knew exactly what to do and immediately cleaned the baby and positioned it for nursing.
