pursuing an appeal of a District Court ruling over \\\"unfair and unjustified\\\" levy rates through the Accident Compensation Corporation (ACC).\", \"Bosses for all six teams, including the recently introduced Moana Pasifika, have accused the government provider of \\\"double dipping\\\" after introducing changes to its levy classification unit.\", \"The changes came into effect two years ago, forcing franchises to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars more in ACC levy rates, despite no professional players being on their books.\", \"All players, coaches, referees and doctors are contracted to, or employed by New Zealand Rugby (NZR).\", \"Super Rugby franchises merely employ \\\"coaching, operational staff and support staff, as well as administrative staff\\\".\", \"Clubs that were previously paying either 14 cents or 59 cents per $100 of liable earnings are now paying $6.43 per $100 of liable earnings.\", \"NZR confirmed it was being levied at the same rate under ACC's Professional Rugby classification unit.\", \"Crusaders chief executive Colin Mansbridge described it as an \\\"unjustified cash grab\\\".\", \"\\\"When they've turned around and changed the classification unit, they've essentially grabbed an extra million dollars of revenue, without any change to our profile.\", \"\\\"We just think it's completely unjustified.\\\"\", \"<img

government ministers to revisit the levy rate changes, to no avail.\", \"The matter ended up in the District Court last November.\", \"Judge Peter Spiller dismissed appeals by the Chiefs, Crusaders and Hurricanes, but said the decision was made \\\"with reluctance\\\".\", \"\\\"It appears to this Court to be anomalous and potentially unfair to rugby administrators that their classification should be grouped along with rugby players.\", \"\\\"The Court expresses the hope that serious attention will be given to reassessing the appropriate classification and levy rates applicable to rugby administrators, to reflect better injury risk.\\\"\", \"The franchises are seeking leave to appeal to the High Court, with the decision pending.\", \"Mansbridge also accused the provider of breaching the confidentiality of the Super clubs during discussions.\", \"\\\"The moment they heard we were going to appeal this reclassification, the first group that they went and spoke to was New Zealand Rugby, who are not the Super Rugby clubs.\", \"\\\"We are separate legal entities and for them to go there in the first place, we thought was a gross breach of our confidentiality.\", \"\\\"Every step of the way their process has been atrocious.\\\"\", \"<img

really difficult to stomach.\\\"\", \"Moana Pasifika, which only joined the competition only last year, is set up as a not-for-profit charitable organisation.\", \"Chief executive Pelenato Sakalia
