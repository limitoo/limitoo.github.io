This made Ukraine dependent on Russia's grid operator despite there having been no electricity trade between the two countries for years.\", \"\\\"This step will give Ukraine the opportunity to receive electricity if (Russia) continues to destroy our power infrastructure, and thus to save our power system,\\\" said Volodymyr Kudrytskyi, who chairs the management board of Ukraine's grid operator Ukrenergo. \\\"We are sincerely grateful to our European partners for their great support and assistance during these difficult times.\\\"\", \"Georg Zachmann, an expert with the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, said the switch will allow energy suppliers in the continental grid that stretches from Portugal to Poland to supply electricity to Ukraine if necessary.\", \"This could allow Ukraine to turn off some of the coal-fired power plants it currently keeps running to ensure grid stability, saving precious fuel in wartime, he said.\", \"In the long, term, Ukraine could export surplus electricity generated by its nuclear power plants to the rest of Europe.\", \"\\\"It's a nice win-win situation,\\\" said Zachmann. \\\"It might even be good for the climate.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"efbd818aa57b11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"efbd818aa57b11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
