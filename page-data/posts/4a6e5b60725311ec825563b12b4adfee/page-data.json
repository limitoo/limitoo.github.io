For what possible purpose? I was paid by The New York Times. What was your excuse? Self-loathing? Force of habit? Ironic detachment?\", \"Please don\\u2019t attempt to shift the conversation to the fans who showed up in person at MetLife Stadium \\u2014 I admire them. One can only assume they bought their tickets months in advance with the adorable notion that the N.F.C. East was available for the taking or might come down to this face-off, in which a youthful dual threat, Daniel Jones, would go up against the Washington Football Team\\u2019s aging gunslinger, Ryan Fitzpatrick.\", \"Instead, they got stuck with an in-person view of Jake Fromm versus Taylor Heinicke.\", \"Those fans are legends, especially the ones who stuck around to watch Fromm throw his second interception of the game on the season\\u2019s final play. But for TV viewers, who had the option of changing the channel, I ask again:\", \"Why?\", \"This Giants game had zero playoff implications. It offered no glimpse of the future, since most of these Giants will not be back. The next time Washington plays a regular-season game, the team will be called something else. This was a game between ghosts. Dull, low-scoring ghosts.\", \"The Washington Soon-to-Be-Something-Else won, 22-7, and the Giants\\u2019 first 17th regular-season game was just a bonus week of bad football, the N.F.L. equivalent of a free but stale doughnut. And if you watched it, you ate it.\", \"Verdict: In honor of this dreadful season, how about a dreadful pun? This one was over Fromm the beginning.\", \"Third-and-9, backed up to the 4-yard line, there are few good options. The probability for converting a first down is low, but bad things happen when a punter\\u2019s heels are on the edge of the end line. Most teams in such a position run a screen, a quick throw at or behind the line of scrimmage, or hand the ball off and take whatever the defense concedes. There\\u2019s a tasteful way to give up on a drive.\", \"The Giants, though?\", \"The Giants decided to put three players in the backfield with quarterback Jake Fromm, creating a phalanx of bodies, and plowed ahead with a quarterback sneak \\u2014 for a 1-yard gain \\u2014 before trudging out the punt unit. Fans in the stadium belted out their groans and jeers, sick of a home team that has been going through the motions for weeks on end.\", \"What was there to feel good about?\", \"The defensive coordinator Patrick Graham adjusted and evolved over the course of the season, blitzing more often and keeping defensive end Leonard Williams in a position to affect games. The defense battled week over week. Daniel Jones, when he was healthy, wasn\\u2019t the same turnover machine as in past seasons. Saquon Barkley finished the season, for crying out loud!\", \"With some squinting, it wouldn\\u2019t have been hard to envision a much better outcome to the 2021 season than the sad 4-13 record that resulted.\", \"It doesn\\u2019t matter what Coach Joe Judge\\u2019s talking point was in the aftermath of this final week, but I will give Judge this much: He\\u2019s not a liar. The Giants are closer to their goals now, much like that quarterback sneak.\", \"From 96 yards to go to 95. All progress is positive, I guess.\", \"Verdict: I\\u2019m going to act as if I never watched a snap of the Giants in the 2021 season.\", \"Buffalo (11-6) blew the game open in the fourth quarter, when Devin Singletary scored two touchdowns in less than nine minutes to provide the final score, 27-10. Zach Wilson was sacked eight times and threw for 87 yards on 7 of 20 passing for the Jets (4-13).\", \"Somehow, after everything the Jets have endured these last few months \\u2014 the losing, the injuries, the scoring woes, the N.F.L.-worst defense, the Joe Flacco signing, the Tom Brady choke-job \\u2014 an optimistic end to this Jetsiest of seasons was still right there for the taking in Buffalo.\", \"Look, the playoffs were never in the cards for the Jets. The quarterback was a rookie. The head coach was a rookie. Their best players were all kids. The goal for this season was growth.\", \"So how did the Jets do? Well, they grew from two wins last season to four wins this season. They\\u2019ve grown from having one top-10 pick in last year\\u2019s draft to having two top-10 picks in this year\\u2019s. (Thanks, Seattle!) Their salary cap space has grown from $15 million last summer to an estimated $49 million heading into the summer of 2022.\", \"All the Jets had to do to crank up their fan base was put a mild scare into the Buffalo Bills, who could clinch their second straight A.F.C. East title with a win at home. They didn\\u2019t even have to beat the Bills \\u2014 just look at how Jets fans reacted to almost beating Brady\\u2019s Buccaneers. A close game would be more than enough to get those hope juices flowing as we head into spring.\", \"So how did the Jets do? Well, no matter how many times Bills punter Matt Haack tried to shank the game away, Zach Wilson kept giving it right back. His one chunk play of the afternoon, a 40-yard touchdown pass to Keelan Cole, probably should have been intercepted. The Jets have young talent, high draft picks, and money to burn, but optimism will have to wait.\", \"Verdict: The Jets also had a chance to overtake the Giants as the more watchable team, but they blew that, too.\", \"I never would have said this at any other point in my life: I kind of like the Jets.\", \"When things looked their lowest, Coach Robert Saleh found a way to keep chins up in the locker room \\u2014 and he never had to fake a folksy accent to convince people he was still in control. The Jets ran trick plays galore, shrank the playbook and the reads for quarterback Zach Wilson, gave young starters room to grow, and played (almost) every late-season opponent close.\", \"It\\u2019s taking a bit of imaginative work, but I think I see a future for this franchise. Sunday\\u2019s 27-10 loss to the Bills meant nothing, outside of extra reps for the Jets\\u2019 offense to find its identity.\", \"This off-season, though, acquiring veteran talent at skill positions should be at the top of the franchise\\u2019s to-do list: No one should be subjected to these receiver or cornerback corps again. The young talent on offense will improve, with their growth happening alongside age (and contract) trajectories. And with Shaq Lawson\\u2019s release, and the Jets holding picks No. 4 and 10 in April\\u2019s draft, they should be able to find an edge rusher to pair with Quinnen Williams.\", \"It wouldn\\u2019t be a recap from your favorite outsider without the reminder that Wilson is likely closer to becoming Baker Mayfield than Justin Herbert, but we can put that quibble to the side for now.\", \"I\\u2019m pulling up a chair next to you, Jets fans, and looking forward to watching this rebuild together.\", \"Verdict: For no real reason, the Jets are watchable!\"]","href_hash":"4a6e5b60725311ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4a6e5b60725311ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
