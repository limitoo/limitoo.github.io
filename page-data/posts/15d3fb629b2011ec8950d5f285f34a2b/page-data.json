You're going to wind up in the dark,\\\" said Graham. \", \"The senator said that while the images coming from Ukraine have moved him to tears, he does not support sending the United States armed forces to fight the Russians\\u2014instead he wants the world to send a united message to Putin that they will not tolerate his actions.\", \"\\\"What I hope will happen here is that the world, not just the American people, will make a case against Putin that's been made for 20 years. He's literally jailed opponents in Russia, poisoned people, carpet-bombed Aleppo, Syria and Idlib, and Chechnya and nothing happened. Enough is enough,\\\" said Graham.\", \"He believes that China is watching what is unfolding in Ukraine and wants them to know that the route Russia took is not one they should attempt on Taiwan. \", \"\\\"China is watching.  I want the Chinese to know that if you go down this road with Taiwan, you may wind up not only being sanctioned but going to jail one day,\\\" he said.  \"]","href_hash":"15d3fb629b2011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"15d3fb629b2011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
