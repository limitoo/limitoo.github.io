Yet on the opening night of \\u201cYes, Virginia, Another Piano Ballet,\\u201d his response to Robbins\\u2019s \\u201cDances,\\u201d he found himself racked with insecurity. \\u201cI was absolutely convinced that it was the worst ballet I had ever done,\\u201d he said. \\u201cA total dog.\\u201d\", \"But like the ballet it was modeled on, \\u201cYes, Virginia\\u201d was a hit \\u2014 and an enduring one at that. \\u201cAll this time went by,\\u201d Anastos said, \\u201cand I thought, I\\u2019m really not done with Jerry Robbins.\\u201d\", \"He revisited Robbins \\u2014 his 1970 ballet \\u201cIn the Night\\u201d \\u2014 for \\u201cNightcrawlers,\\u201d which has its New York premiere on Tuesday as part of the Trockadero season at the Joyce Theater. Witty and set to Chopin, the dance spotlights three couples grappling with relationship issues.\", \"Even though, as he said, terrible things happen to the dancers in \\u201cYes, Virginia,\\u201d Anastos sees it as a sunny work. As for his new dance, \\u201cI decided I\\u2019d make an evening ballet in which everything also always goes wrong,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI thought, If they\\u2019re going to suffer in the daytime, why shouldn\\u2019t they suffer at night, too?\\u201d\", \"Robbins was exacting in how he cast his ballets, tailoring them for specific dancers; that\\u2019s how it works in Trockadero, too. \\u201cYou have to build in a tremendous amount of freedom and the ability for them to go off-script sometimes,\\u201d Anastos said. \\u201cI used to hate that until I figured out that\\u2019s what makes it work for the dancer. You let the dancer just go with it. I think that\\u2019s the Trockadero magic.\\u201d\", \"Anastos formed the company with Natch Taylor and Anthony Bassae in 1974 but left in 1978, in part, he said, \\u201cto see if I was a choreographer.\\u201d\", \"But those running Trockadero weren\\u2019t happy with his departure. Years went by, and he remained occupied with other projects until Tory Dobrin, the company\\u2019s current artistic director, asked Anastos to choreograph a ballet in 2001: \\u201cLa Trovatiara Pas de Cinq,\\u201d set to Verdi and featuring pirate girls.\", \"Dobrin hopes to bring in more ballets by Anastos. \\u201cJust having him in the room gives weight to the work,\\u201d Dobrin said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like if you eat a nice meal and then the chef comes to the table, you feel better about it even though it\\u2019s delicious anyway.\\u201d\", \"Anastos lives in Boise, Idaho, where he remained after retiring as the artistic director of Ballet Idaho in 2018. He was there when he spoke in a video call about comedy and ballet, Trockadero\\u2019s early days and his education with broken-down Russian teachers. His ballets are a riot. It\\u2019s comforting to know that he is, too. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"What is the temperament of your couples in \\u201cNightcrawlers\\u201d?\", \"Some of them are sappy and romantic; some of them are fraught with anxiety. In a lot of Robbins, there\\u2019s always some unseen, unknown anxiety that\\u2019s pervasive on the stage. There is one very hysterical ballerina who seems like she can\\u2019t live in this world. I always like to have one girl that doesn\\u2019t have much going on for her. I always like to have one wallflower in the ballet.\", \"What about their partners?\", \"The men are basically uncaring, unfeeling, typical men. It\\u2019s kind of a parody of partnering, but everybody has a lot to do. At this point, in 2021, I don\\u2019t know how many people really know \\u201cIn the Night\\u201d or \\u201cDances at a Gathering,\\u201d but there\\u2019s just some goofy, inner logic to the ballet that makes sense as a comedy. If the audience laughs, then I guess the ballet works.\", \"What were audiences like in the early days?\", \"Eventually we started touring, but we always premiered everything in New York because that was the smartest audience. We used to have a midnight curtain. They would pile into their limos to Greenwich Village after they\\u2019d seen Fonteyn and Nureyev at the Met Opera House.\", \"Would Fonteyn and Nureyev ever come downtown, too?\", \"I never saw Margot or Rudolf after our shows, but they don\\u2019t strike me as people who went backstage either, unless it was some equal. I know that Natalia Makarova saw us once and really didn\\u2019t like us. Although she had worked with us; she coached us on \\u201cLes Sylphides.\\u201d She was a very, very good coach, and she got the comedy.\", \"Then why didn\\u2019t she like the company?\", \"We were doing \\u201cGiselle,\\u201d and she thought we were making fun of her. It was me dancing Giselle. I was never, ever making fun of her. It was always some vision of some 19th century crackpot ballerina. That\\u2019s who I was, anyway.\", \"How would you describe the type of ballerinas in \\u201cNightcrawlers\\u201d?\", \"That\\u2019s a more modern ballerina, so they have to have a modern sensibility. It\\u2019s not on the surface, but there is that kind of painful experience of being a woman right now. You know, just dating and having somebody to dance with \\u2014 all that stuff is built into what they\\u2019re doing onstage. They\\u2019re modern women with issues.\", \"How did you get to know ballet so well?\", \"I went to every performance every night of everything.\", \"In New York City?\", \"I\\u2019d seen a ballet in Albany. My first ballet was \\u201cBilly the Kid,\\u201d which is not a great way to start. It certainly leaves you someplace to go. And then I moved to New York. Well, actually, my first ballet was \\u201cSwan Lake.\\u201d\", \"Where?\", \"Our high school took a field trip to New York to see the Broadway show \\u201cOliver!\\u201d In those days, they let us all escape for lunch and go any place we wanted. We\\u2019re high school kids in New York. It was insane.\", \"So I walked a few blocks down from 42nd Street, and the old Met was there, and I saw this poster: the Royal Ballet, \\u201cSwan Lake.\\u201d I bought a $3 ticket. Three and a half hours later, I stumbled out of the Met and ran back up to wherever \\u201cOliver!\\u201d was, and all the kids were in the bus. The show was over; they had called the police. They thought I\\u2019d been kidnapped. I said, \\u201cI went to the ballet,\\u201d and they just wanted to kill me. They took my program away. I wasn\\u2019t allowed to talk to anybody, but I saw my first real ballet. After that, I just couldn\\u2019t get enough.\", \"Whom did you train with in New York?\", \"I had really not good teachers. I studied with all these broken-down old Russian teachers that nobody really wanted to go to. One was Elisabeth Anderson\\u2010Ivantzova. She was a Swede who lived in Russia and danced in the Bolshoi Ballet before the revolution. Basically, she was teaching a 19th-century class, and I was fascinated. I mean, the studio was broken down. She had no rosin. She put a watering can on the floor like you see in old photographs. I was like, Oh my God, this is like heaven.\", \"Completely understandable.\", \"Everybody was terrible in the class, and it was awful. But for a choreographer making fun of old ballets and wanting to know about old ballets, it was absolutely priceless. It didn\\u2019t make sense at the time, but then it did make sense. So much of the Trockadero came out of that woman\\u2019s class. Thank God, she\\u2019ll never know.\"]","href_hash":"bb1fd5705cee11ec8a4e9f18334d4e00"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bb1fd5705cee11ec8a4e9f18334d4e00"}},
