Raised to believe he is the \\u201c10th incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu,\\u201d he heals the sick at his family\\u2019s ashram in Tamil Nadu, India, with a god-energy that he imagines as \\u201cfluffy cotton\\u201d inside his body. In his free time, he roams the land around the ashram with his younger cousin, Lakshman. Ten and 9 years old, they are each other\\u2019s \\u201cshadows\\u201d; Lakshman will often sneak at night into Kalki\\u2019s room, where they fall asleep \\u201cfit like two crescents.\\u201d It is impossible not to be hypnotized by the tenderness of these opening scenes.\", \"But relatively early in the novel Kalki, narrating in adulthood as a university lecturer in Toronto, breaks the illusion of his own divinity \\u2014 and any illusion that his childhood had been blessed. It becomes clear Kalki\\u2019s father led the deception, but Sindu strategically withholds how exactly things fell apart, as she weaves Kalki\\u2019s adult hindsight into only a few chapters and in brief asides, allowing the reader to remain primarily inside the immersive world of his childhood. For instance, when Lakshman\\u2019s family must suddenly leave the ashram, Kalki\\u2019s young mind reorients around the loss. His cousin\\u2019s name becomes a time stamp; everything is \\u201cafter Lakshman\\u201d or \\u201cwithout Lakshman.\\u201d\", \"In attending to the fine aftershocks of this loss and many others to come, Sindu masterfully renders how our environments bake into our skin. Even after he becomes fully aware that his healing power was a scam, Kalki still thinks like a god. He cannot bring himself to hate his domineering father: \\u201cAyya had done so many terrible things, but I\\u2019d always been taught that hate wasn\\u2019t an emotion gods should have.\\u201d\", \"Long before Kalki escapes the ashram, he secretly borrows a literary novel from one of its guests, and is surprised to discover that \\u201cthis book held no miracles. No gods, no heroes. It told of nothing but quiet human problems.\\u201d Likewise, it turns out there are no miracles in \\u201cBlue-Skinned Gods.\\u201d Even after the ashram, Kalki finds new illusions in the outside world \\u2014 some nearly as potent as those he left behind.\", \"THE ISLAND OF MISSING TREES By Elif Shafak 353 pp. Bloomsbury. $27.\", \"Ada\\u2019s parents rarely spoke to her about their suffering as a taboo Greek-Turkish couple in 1970s Cyprus, but the 16-year-old has nonetheless inherited their melancholia. As a high school student in London, she is asked about family heirlooms, and struggles to answer in front of her gawking classmates. \\u201cWas it also possible to inherit something as intangible and immeasurable as sorrow?\\u201d she wonders, unable to sit down. Then she screams for 52 seconds. An arresting set piece that spans two chapters, the scene raises an urgent question: How does one contend with a sadness that is \\u201cnot quite her own\\u201d?\", \"A quintessential teenager, Ada vacillates between wanting to know more about her past, including her mother\\u2019s recent death due to alcoholism, and refusing to engage at all. Yet with its complex structure \\u2014 the setting jumps from contemporary London to Cyprus in 1974 and the early 2000s, and many chapters are told from the perspective of a fig tree \\u2014 Shafak\\u2019s novel conveys how our ancestors\\u2019 stories can reach us obliquely, unconsciously. For instance, when Ada\\u2019s aunt gives her a delicate wooden music box, the reader will recognize it from 1974: a token Ada\\u2019s father, Kostas, gave her mother. Ada only knows the item once belonged to her mom, but the reader knows it carries the promise of a longer narrative.\", \"The fig tree, who lives in Ada\\u2019s yard, proves an unusual ally. Born in Cyprus but transplanted by Kostas in the early 2000s, she shares detailed memories of the Cypriot ecology, while mourning the decimation of the natural world at the hands of humans. But far more than a vessel of facts, the tree, an immigrant herself, lovingly watches out for Ada. Hearing Ada crying, she reflects: \\u201cI was filled with immense sadness then. For I felt connected to her, even if she might not think much of me. We had grown together in this house, a baby and a sapling.\\u201d\", \"If Shafak\\u2019s prose is occasionally cloying, leaning heavily into nature metaphors, \\u201cThe Island of Missing Trees\\u201d is not overly sentimental. Shafak is cleareyed about how difficult it is to reach across the gulfs within our families: At the end of the novel, Ada is only beginning to learn about her history, and her grief.\", \"THE TELLER OF SECRETS By Bisi Adjapon 341 pp. HarperVia. $26.99.\", \"After she is berated by her father, stepmother and half sisters for experimenting with a boy, 11-year-old Esi decides to lie down in the mud, having heard that \\u201cif a frog jumps on you, you\\u2019ll turn into a man.\\u201d But nothing happens; she is still a girl, only now \\u201cstinging from the welts and bumps insects left on my skin after feasting on me.\\u201d\", \"A bildungsroman set in Ghana and Nigeria in the 1970s and \\u201980s, Adjapon\\u2019s debut begins with a handful of such heart-rending but comic episodes so characteristic of early childhood. But the novel quickly falters as it progresses further into Esi\\u2019s adolescence and heavier material.\", \"At a very young age, before the novel begins, Esi was separated from her birth mother in Nigeria, living with her father in Ghana. Between this absence and the deaths and abortions she experiences over the course of the novel, Esi suffers a great deal, recognizing relatively early that: \\u201cI\\u2019m getting good at this, creating cupboards in my mind where I lock up scenes that threaten to shred me to pieces.\\u201d So the reader anticipates that Esi will not always dwell in her emotions. Still, Adjapon\\u2019s treatment of her protagonist\\u2019s traumas can feel so hurried that the scenes fail to leave an impression. Notably, when Esi learns her birth mother has been dead for many years \\u2014 her father and extended family hid the truth, even sending fake letters in her mother\\u2019s name \\u2014 Adjapon only dwells in Esi\\u2019s immediate shock and rage. The chapter ends the day after her father\\u2019s confession, and then the novel catapults a year forward, when the pain has \\u201csubsided into a dull ache I can live with.\\u201d Later mentions of her mother don\\u2019t stir much emotion, given the reader\\u2019s scant impression of what Esi\\u2019s grief looked like.\", \"Adjapon also oversimplifies the language of adolescence. Esi\\u2019s narration sometimes reads like an imitation of a child\\u2019s voice \\u2014 \\u201cThink, Esi, think!\\u201d \\u2014 and remains stilted even into her 20s. In the penultimate chapter, she realizes once and for all that she, not her father, has the right to decide her future. She shares a series of revelations with a new friend, including, \\u201cI am the queen of my body.\\u201d The friend, a too-convenient interlocutor only recently introduced, replies with variations of, \\u201cThat\\u2019s it, Esi!\\u201d The chapter is one more episode that feels overly tidy for a subject as unwieldy as youth: The pair race into the ocean, supposedly but impossibly washed clean.\"]","href_hash":"41c5c7af46c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"41c5c7af46c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
