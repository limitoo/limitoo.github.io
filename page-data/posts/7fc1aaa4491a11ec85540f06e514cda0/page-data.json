One spoke about the “travesty of justice” he lived through.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-19T09:25:22.000Z","content":"[\"It\\u2019s Friday. We\\u2019ll follow up on the move to exonerate two men convicted in the assassination of Malcolm X. We\\u2019ll also look at how Mayor Bill de Blasio once again hopes to ban horse-drawn carriages.\", \"\\u201cI do not need this court, these prosecutors or a piece of paper to tell me I am innocent,\\u201d Muhammad Aziz declared on Thursday.\", \"The guilty verdict against him in the 1965 murder of the civil rights leader Malcolm X was about to be thrown out. But first, he addressed the court in a solemn voice that did not waver: \\u201cI am an 83-year-old who was victimized by the criminal justice system.\\u201d\", \"Aziz and his co-defendant Khalil Islam, who died in 2009, were cleared on Thursday, their convictions overturned by Justice Ellen Biben of State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance Jr., had submitted a 43-page motion written with the lawyers for the two men asking that she vacate the convictions. When she did so, the courtroom burst into applause.\", \"The extraordinary moment came after a 22-month review of the case initiated by Vance\\u2019s office and conducted jointly with the men\\u2019s lawyers. It found that they had not been given a fair trial. It reached the same conclusions that historians and scholars had arrived at years earlier: The case against the two men was dubious. No physical evidence tied Aziz and Islam to the murder. Both had alibis.\", \"[Read the motion to vacate convictions in the murder of Malcolm X.]\", \"Vance apologized on behalf of all law enforcement. Aziz and two of Islam\\u2019s sons made it clear that they did not consider it a day of celebration.\", \"\\u201cI hope the same system that was responsible for this travesty of justice also takes responsibility for the immeasurable harm it caused to me,\\u201d Aziz said, adding that his conviction was part of a corrupt process \\u201cthat is all too familiar to Black people, even in 2021.\\u201d\", \"A third man, Mujahid Abdul Halim, was also found guilty in the 1966 trial. He confessed to the murder but insisted that Aziz and Islam were innocent. His conviction stands; he was granted work-release in 1988 and paroled in 2010.\", \"The investigation that led to the exoneration did not provide an alternate explanation of the shooting, which took place in front of an audience of hundreds as Malcolm X was beginning a speech. Nor did it identify others who were involved in the assassination.\", \"If you missed that partial lunar eclipse during the night, here\\u2019s what to expect today: Sun and temps in the mid-40s instead. The eclipse-less evening will be mostly clear with temps in the mid-30s.\", \"In effect until Nov. 25 (Thanksgiving Day).\", \"With six weeks left in office, Mayor Bill de Blasio is resurrecting an old campaign pledge to ban horse-drawn carriages in New York City.\", \"The de Blasio administration is preparing legislation that would phase out carriages in Central Park and elsewhere, replacing them with \\u201cshow cars,\\u201d according to internal City Hall emails marked \\u201cconfidential.\\u201d The emails did not explain what \\u201cshow cars\\u201d are, but in the past, proponents of a ban have pushed to replace horse-drawn vehicles with electric-powered ones that look like old-fashioned carriages.\", \"My colleague Dana Rubinstein writes that the City Council would have to approve a carriage ban, and in the emails, city officials indicated that they wanted to have a bill ready by Dec. 16, the last scheduled City Council meeting before de Blasio leaves office.\", \"Danielle Filson, a spokeswoman for the mayor, said that de Blasio had always wanted a ban on ban horse-drawn carriages and that he hoped the City Council would again consider one.\", \"For the last few months, New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets \\u2014 the leading advocate for the ban \\u2014 has paid a lobbying firm $7,000 a month to press for a plan like the one for electric-powered equipment, city records indicate. In October, after a collision between a horse and a car, the group spent roughly $200,000 on television and digital ads that called for the elimination of the industry.\", \"Proponents of a ban have long argued that the horses are mistreated, a claim that carriage drivers like Christina Hansen deny.\", \"\\u201cHere we are, in the middle of New York\\u2019s great recovery from the pandemic, the international tourists are coming back, Broadway is reopening, and they\\u2019re coming back and taking carriage rides,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThe Christmas carriage ride is a New York City tradition. And here you\\u2019ve got Bill de Blasio playing the Grinch.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSometimes it\\u2019s the little things that make all the difference,\\u201d Assemblywoman Linda Rosenthal said, \\u201cbut for a lot of people on the West Side, this wasn\\u2019t a little thing.\\u201d\", \"Rosenthal, a Democrat who represents the Upper West Side of Manhattan, was talking about an adopt-a-highway sign on the southbound side of the West Side Highway near the West 79th Street exit. In the middle, in larger letters, was the name Donald J. Trump.\", \"It was taken down about 10 days ago. Alana Morales, a spokeswoman for the city\\u2019s Department of Transportation, said the agreement between the Trump Organization and the maintenance contractor for that stretch of the West Side Highway had expired on Nov. 7. \\u201cTherefore,\\u201d she said by email, \\u201cthe sign was removed.\\u201d\", \"Morales said the new adopt-a-highway sponsor for that stretch of road was Glenwood Management, a politically influential real estate developer of high-rise apartment buildings.\", \"It was not immediately clear how much it cost to sponsor the roughly four miles in question. Sponsors pay one of three private maintenance providers directly. An email to Adopt a Highway Maintenance Corporation, the company responsible for that section of the West Side Highway, was not immediately answered. Nor did the Trump Organization respond to an email seeking comment.\", \"The highway sign had carried Trump\\u2019s name for years. In the distance \\u2014 about half a mile south of the sign \\u2014 was an apartment development which at one point was called Trump Place. But large gold letters spelling the Trump name on three buildings there were removed after Trump won the presidency in 2016. He had once been involved with the project, but by the time he announced his candidacy, the Chicago-based company Equity Residential had owned the three buildings for 10 years.\", \"Richard Robbins, who runs a company that places college and graduate students in internships in the life sciences, circulated a petition demanding the sign\\u2019s removal after he read the Department of Transportation\\u2019s rules on the adopt-a-highway program, which he said barred candidates for office from taking part. More than 1,600 people signed the petition\", \"\\u201cI think that the petition struck a nerve because people were offended that Trump would be associated with \\u2018beautification,\\u2019\\u201d a term Robbins said was at odds with what \\u201cto many of us his name alone signifies.\\u201d\", \"Rosenthal said she had contacted Henry Gutman, the transportation commissioner, and other officials in his department. \\u201cI was gently prodding them, sometimes more urgently, to get rid of that sign,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt caused so many people agita.\\u201d\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"My husband and I were leaving our community garden on West 48th Street. Wanting coffee, we walked west toward the Hudson.\", \"On our way, we stopped to chat with a parks worker who was holding an aerosol spray can while trying to remove some graffiti from the sign with the maple leaf logo hanging outside the park at 48th Street and Tenth Avenue.\", \"We admired his work and discussed the quality of the graffiti.\", \"\\u201cWhat are you using to remove that?\\u201d my husband asked.\", \"The man glanced down at the label of the can and then looked back up.\", \"\\u201cGraffiti remover,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u2014 Laralu Smith\", \"Illustrated by Agnes Lee.
