She wrote that Apple was enforcing that rule \\u201cto harm competition\\u201d while it collected fees on developers\\u2019 sales.\", \"Apple has been trying to blunt Judge Gonzalez Rogers\\u2019s September verdict in a yearlong lawsuit brought by Epic Games, the creator of the video game Fortnite. Now Apple may have to rewrite its policies to allow app developers to point users to alternative payment methods as soon as December.\", \"In its original lawsuit, Epic wanted Apple to be labeled a monopolist. Epic argued that the strict App Store rules and the fees that Apple charges developers that distribute apps in the store were harming customers and developers and tamping down competition.\", \"After a trial that concluded in May, Judge Gonzalez Rogers ruled in favor of Apple on most counts in September. But she said the company was violating California\\u2019s anticompetition law by stifling app developers from communicating directly with customers about ways to pay for services outside the App Store. That would allow the developers to avoid paying Apple\\u2019s standard fee of up to 30 percent of their sales.\", \"The judge banned these so-called anti-steering rules starting in December. In October, Apple appealed the verdict and requested a stay of her injunction until the appeals process was completed.\", \"Judge Gonzalez Rogers denied Apple\\u2019s request after a hearing Tuesday. From the start of the hearing, which was held by videoconference, she appeared skeptical of Apple\\u2019s request.\", \"When Mark Perry, a lawyer for Apple, argued that allowing developers to include links to outside websites within their apps would take months to figure out, the judge interrupted him to point out that the company had not asked for simply a short delay to work out the logistics.\", \"\\u201cYou did not ask for a few months,\\u201d she said. \\u201cYou did not ask for six months.

Apple said it would seek a reversal of the judge\\u2019s decision with a federal appeals court.\", \"\\u201cApple believes no additional business changes should be required to take effect until all appeals in this case are resolved,\\u201d a company spokeswoman said in a statement.\", \"The specifics of what Apple would have to alter if an injunction was upheld are unclear. Some have speculated that developers could offer their own competing payment methods within the App Store, but Apple has disagreed with those interpretations of the judge\\u2019s ruling.\"]","href_hash":"139f8cc841cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"139f8cc841cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
