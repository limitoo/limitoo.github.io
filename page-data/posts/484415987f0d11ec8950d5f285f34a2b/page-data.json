Contacts are expected to isolate for 10 days and close contacts, such as household members of cases, must isolate for up to 24 days.\\u00a0\", \"The Ministry of Health's rules state: \\\"The isolation period for COVID-19 cases in the community is at least 14 days, including 72 hours symptom-free. Your household members will need to remain in isolation for at least 10 days after you have been released as a case.\", \"It has caused concern among Kiwis who are worried they could be without pay for several weeks. But there's good news - the Government's COVID-19 Leave Support Scheme helps employers pay staff if they are required to isolate.\\u00a0\", \"There are a few rules. For example, the scheme is available to employers, including self-employed people, to help pay staff who have been advised to self-isolate because of COVID-19 and can\\u2019t work at home.\\u00a0\", \"Employers can access $600 for a full-time worker who is working 20 hours or more per week and $359 for a part-time worker.\\u00a0\", \"For employers to be eligible for the scheme their employee has to be told to self-isolate for at least four consecutive calendar days.\", \"If the staff members need to keep self-isolating for at least 11 calendar days or more and can\\u2019t work from home, the employer can apply for a second payment.\\u00a0\", \"A third payment is available for every further seven days of self-isolation.\", \"But despite the support, experts are concerned the lengthy isolation periods could dissuade some from getting tested.\\u00a0\", \"ACT leader David Seymour described the rules as \\\"unworkable\\\", because \\\"people who cannot afford that will have a strong incentive not to get tested, defeating the purpose of the policy\\\".\\u00a0\", \"Auckland GP Dr Peter Boot, medical director of Northcare Accident and Medical on the North Shore, shared a similar sentiment.\", \"\\\"I expect the Government's system, where [cases] are meant to stay at home, and their families are meant to stay at home for longer, will be just disregarded by large sectors of society who have to work or just don't want to stay at home. I am sure the whole thing will fall to pieces quite quickly,\\\" he told RNZ.\\u00a0\", \"Along with the leave support scheme, there is also the short-term absence payment available to help bosses pay their employees who cannot work from home while they wait for the result of a COVID-19 test. That is paid at $359 per eligible worker.\\u00a0\", \"When announcing the isolation changes on Tuesday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern acknowledged not everyone will support the plan. But she urged the country to come together to help slow down the new variant's spread.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I know not everyone sees this pandemic in the same way, but for the most part we're motivated by the same thing - and that's looking out for each other. So get boosted, start wearing a mask in all indoor settings and get prepared at home.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"484415987f0d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"484415987f0d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
