I'm not going to let this organisation speak for me anymore.\\\"\", \"Sutorius, who runs Vollynet, one of the country's largest online groups of volunteer firefighters, said not many men had left the union over alleged behaviours within the association but there had been \\\"plenty of women ... and in particular the women who have been victims\\\".\", \"\\\"I'm just following them. And you know, now that I've done it, I feel a bit guilty that I didn't do it sooner,\\\" Sutorius said. \\\"There's plenty of people who feel the same way.\\\"\", \"He wanted to see government or Fire and Emergency officials step in and trigger change within the association because he did not think it could claim to celebrate women when there were assault allegations.\", \"\\\"There's a really long list of, kind of, apparently fairly soft accountabilities and it's time for everyone in that chain to actually look to their own conscience and just start acting with seriousness and asking the basic questions to get this sorted out.\\\"\", \"United Fire Brigades' Association chair Hon. Peter Dunne said the association had not received any notice of Suturious' decision to step away.\", \"Dunne said he stood behind Butzbach's decision to acknowledge International Women's Day in the social media post in question.\", \"\\\"Our campaign to acknowledge International Women's Day was entirely appropriate, given 77% of the Association's employees are women, of which 60% make up the Association's senior leadership team. Additionally, approximately 20% of our members are female.\", \"\\\"It is important to show our appreciation for these inspiring women and the work they do for their community. It was in this vein that comments were managed to maintain the focus on acknowledging and celebrating International Women's Day,\\\" Dunne said.\", \"Dunne said all members of the association could access support through FENZ and the association's advocacy services.\"]","href_hash":"a44ba6309f8d11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a44ba6309f8d11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
