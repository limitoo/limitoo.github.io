Every teacher\\u2019s responsibility should be to structure content using critical thinking, which requires valid criteria \\u2014 standards \\u2014 to support one\\u2019s positions (or judgments). Criteria vary by discipline. For example, the criteria used in mathematics are different from those used in history or art.\", \"Think about the discussions we could have in classes if they were based on critical thinking. When responding to a question, students should be required to cite valid evidence relevant to that discipline as reasons for their answers, and not just say, \\u201cBecause!\\u201d Imagine courses on civic education based on critical thinking, helping us make good judgments about whom to vote for. This is hard work that would mean preparing teachers differently, but unless we think of critical thinking and reasoning as central to understanding, we will make no progress toward their inclusion.\", \"Nicholas M. Michelli Water Mill, N.Y.\", \"\", \"To the Editor:\", \" I\\u2019m wondering if anyone else found it ironic, in the 125th anniversary issue (Oct. 24), that all of the great fiction included by women authors \\u2014 including some iconic feminist works \\u2014 was reviewed by men.\", \"Some, like those who reviewed Doris Lessing\\u2019s \\u201cThe Golden Notebook\\u201d and Sylvia Plath\\u2019s \\u201cThe Bell Jar,\\u201d just didn\\u2019t get it! Were there no women reviewers on the roster?\", \"Elaine ElinsonSan Francisco\", \"\\u2666\", \"To the Editor:\", \" The 125th anniversary issue could not have come at a better time. Given the distraction \\u2014 and limited light \\u2014 resulting from Cape Cod\\u2019s October power outage, I couldn\\u2019t stay with the otherwise brilliant William Maxwell novel I\\u2019d been reading. Sadly, the gossipy Katie Couric memoir hadn\\u2019t arrived at my library the day before the nor\\u2019easter hit. But there on the coffee table sat what I would discover was your smart and entertaining collection of reviews and essays. For hours, they nearly silenced the winds outside my window.\", \"What a pleasure it was to read the Colson Whitehead interview, knowing his fame and accomplishment were only in their infancy; revisit Reynolds Price\\u2019s review of Toni Morrison\\u2019s \\u201cSong of Solomon\\u201d; nod in agreement throughout Meg Wolitzer\\u2019s sage essay on so-called women\\u2019s fiction; and chuckle over Diane Johnson\\u2019s brave dive for Gore Vidal pearls (you could almost hear him chiding those academics who mistake \\u201cthe university for the universe\\u201d). And thanks to Dr. Joseph Collins\\u2019s analysis of James Joyce, I might start \\u201cUlysses\\u201d yet again \\u2014 just not during a power outage.\", \"Jim Brosseau Provincetown, Mass.\", \"\\u2666\", \"To the Editor:\", \" Thank you so much for the 125-year celebration issue and the historical reviews and interviews you republished.\", \"I especially was affected by James Baldwin\\u2019s review of Alex Haley\\u2019s \\u201cRoots.\\u201d The metaphor he used in the last paragraph, that we \\u201ccan\\u2019t but be the vehicle of the history which has produced us,\\u201d and that we \\u201ccan perish in this vehicle \\u2026 or move on up the road,\\u201d is chilling and such prescient advice for us today.\", \"Lin Roberts Flossmoor, Ill.\", \"\\u2666\", \"To the Editor:\", \" The 125th anniversary issue was a joy to read. The review of Agatha Christie\\u2019s \\u201cThe Mysterious Affair at Styles\\u201d brought back many memories, as I read most of her books over the years while riding the subway to my job in Manhattan.\", \"Also of special interest was \\u201cBooks About the Babe.\\u201d I am in possession of \\u201cThe Babe Ruth Story,\\u201d as told to Bob Considine. As a kid I saved my allowance to special order the book. Of course, it was Ruth\\u2019s story through the lens of the Bambino himself. And I loved it.

Never has so much internet sleuthing been inspired, and it has made more precious my \\u201cnext up to read\\u201d list.
