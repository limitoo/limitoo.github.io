Netflix's last price rise for New Zealand customers came in October, rising by a dollar or two depending on what plan users were signed up for.\", \"The plans now range from $12.99 for the basic plan with one screen usable at a time for streaming to $24.99 per month for the premium plan with four screens and higher quality.\", \"Price rises will \\\"keep coming,\\\" Spain said.\", \"Netflix may be a global giant but that doesn't mean they are flush with cash considering how much they spend, he said.\", \"\\\"They're not a hugely profitable firm.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/139372/eight_col_043_442954677.jpg?1646285963\\\" alt=\\\"2022-01-19 12:42:43 ILLUSTRATIVE - Applications from streaming services Disney Plus, Amazon Prime Video, Apple TV, Videoland and Netflix on a phone. \\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPhoto: Koen van Weel / ANP MAG / ANP via AFP\\n</div>\", \"The pandemic had been helpful for viewers, but Netflix saw a big drop in the number of new subscribers last year compared to 2020.\", \"\\\"Their current profits don't really reflect their current share price. That's part of the challenge they have to weigh up, their desire to have a huge, huge audience and to dominate the market.\\\"\", \"How will Netflix enforce a crackdown on sharing passwords?\", \"Multi-factor authentication that requires a text or other confirmation is one tool, Spain said.\", \"\\\"Over time they'll just put more and more sort of lockdowns into place,\\\" including limiting the number of devices that are logged into the account.\", \"Spain said he doesn't think Netflix will block users from using their accounts when they travel, however, as you can currently use your New Zealand account when you go to America, for instance.\", \"\\\"I don't think they'll do an across the board geo-blocking any time soon. I do think there is going to be a level of flexibility.\\\"\", \"\\\"The sharing that happens today is probably more people within your same country anyway in most cases.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"5f107ebca8b411ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5f107ebca8b411ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
