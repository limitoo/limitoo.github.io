Her post on the \\\"Anti Work\\\" thread has gained more than 26,000 votes in less than a day.\", \"According to the woman, she is expected to stay at the store until another manager arrives to cover for her, or obtain permission from two superiors to close the store early.\", \"\\\"The key thing is that managers of any level are not to leave the store unattended if there are no other managers on duty,\\\" she wrote. \\\"If it was just me and a cashier, I would not be able to leave the store without losing my job. Our store is small, so during the mornings, evenings and nights we only have one manager on duty.\\\"\", \"The Redditor added that she had expected the company to schedule another manager to work at the same time as her in the lead-up to her due date, but was surprised to be told she would have to call her store manager and then her district manager if she went into labor.\", \"Her options are to \\\"wait for another manager to come relieve me (which could take up to an 1hr and a half)\\\" or \\\"get permission to close early, get all of the customers out of the store, close the store, and then complete the 30 minutes closing procedures before leaving.\\\"\", \"The mom-to-be wrote that she was contemplating asking her doctor to write a note ordering her to leave immediately upon going into labor, in order to \\\"give an extra push for them to figure something else out.\\\"\", \"Many companies in the U.S. do not provide paid leave and instead follow the 1993 Family and Medical Leave Act, which provides certain employees with up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave per year.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952404/woman-labor.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Stock image of a woman in labor.

I was even robbed at gunpoint in the store, both times while pregnant. I begged to be put on a different shift or have a coworker with me in case I went into labor and was all alone. Their answer was no. This is how a lot of companies in the U.S. are.\", \"\\\"Even after having my kids, I had to pump while at work, but since I was always alone on the shift, I never got breaks.

She ended up in a ditch, the car totaled.\\\"\", \"One Redditor advised: \\\"Do what you need to do; worry about yourself and your family. The world will not end if there is no manager on duty for the hour and a half it takes your lazy ass, useless, heartless, brainless store/district manager to get there.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"6b4664ba5dcf11ec98a56797c24893bd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6b4664ba5dcf11ec98a56797c24893bd"}},
