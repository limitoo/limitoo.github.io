They had been forced to live apart for four months, even though she was pregnant.\", \"It has been a long journey to Denmark's Supreme Court. \", \"Inquiries by both the country's ombudsman and a special commission concluded that the separations were illegal. Requirements to individually assess or consult those affected had been ignored and breached human rights. \", \"The \\\"Instrukskommission\\\" or Directive Commission also said that the former minister had been warned by staff that the practice was unlawful.\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/4A29/production/_120358981_danes.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Asylum-seekers arrive in Copenhagen in 2015</div>\", \"Two independent attorneys then determined there were grounds for impeachment, and earlier this year, a large majority of MPs voted in favour, including Inger Stoejberg's own party, the Liberals. \", \"She resigned as deputy leader and quit the party.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'No basis for impeachment'</div>\", \"Ms Stoejberg maintains she was trying to protect girls and combat child marriage.\", \"\\\"Mistakes have happened in the case and those I have apologised for, but to me there is of course no basis for an impeachment,\\\" she wrote earlier on Facebook.\", \"\\\"My political wish was, is and will be that no child brides should live with their older husband at a Danish asylum centre.

Thirteen Supreme Court judges and 13 appointees will decide if the former minister has violated the Ministerial Accountability Act.\", \"\\\"It's about her responsibility. Whether she actually instructed the administration to perform an illegal action, and whether she knew that's what she was doing,\\\" explains Jens Elo Rytter, a constitutional law professor at Copenhagen University. \", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Career in the balance</div>\", \"\\\"Very rarely do we have impeachment trials in this country,\\\" says Prof Rytter. \\\"It's the only trial you can have for a minister who has allegedly performed an illegal action in office.\\\"\", \"This is only the sixth impeachment in Danish history. \", \"Most have ended in acquittal. However, in 1995 ex-Justice Minister Erik Ninn-Hansen was handed a four-month suspended sentence for blocking refugees from Sri Lanka bringing their families to Denmark.\", \"There's no chance to appeal. If convicted, she could face a fine or possible imprisonment.\", \"Her political career also hangs in the balance and Prof Rytter believes Ms Stoejberg has a fight on her hands.\", \"\\\"If you read the conclusions of the investigative committee that have looked very, very carefully to this case, their conclusions are rather clear.\\\" he says. \\\"On that basis, I would say I would be more surprised to see an acquittal than a guilty verdict.\\\"\", \"Inge Stoejberg is currently an independent MP.
