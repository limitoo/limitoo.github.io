It had some beautiful art museums, sure, and a gleaming forest of downtown skyscrapers, but its fundamental identity seemed to be suburban sprawl, McMansions and strip malls. The idea of public space felt foreign, something I could access only through movies where people loafed around Central Park and sipped espressos in packed Italian piazzas. My experience of public life was weekend soccer games and deserted granite plazas glimpsed from the back seat of my parents\\u2019 car. Sometimes I\\u2019d take school field trips downtown, and the bus driver would make a pit stop at Pioneer Plaza, one of the city\\u2019s biggest parks, which contained 39 bronze cattle sculptures but not a single bench.\", \"After college I moved to Berlin, which I came to understand as Dallas\\u2019s polar opposite. Here was a city boasting green space, public transit and pedestrian-jammed cobblestone streets. Its architectural history, too, was dense. An afternoon\\u2019s stroll could bring you from a quaint neighborhood of neoclassical apartments to an austere postwar housing complex; from the fascist megalomania of Tempelhof Airport to the monumental Soviet grandeur of Karl-Marx-Allee. I began roaming Berlin with a paperback architecture guide, trying to become the sort of urban connoisseur who could distinguish a late Peter Behrens project from an early Mies van der Rohe building. On annual trips home to Dallas, I\\u2019d pontificate to my family on the city\\u2019s lack of \\u201cspatial identity.\\u201d\", \"I eventually landed a job at a fancy German architecture magazine. Only then did I discover a few of my colleagues \\u2014 trained architects with tastes for the abstruse and avant-garde \\u2014 had developed a campy yet genuine enthusiasm for an architectural style found in, of all places, Dallas.\", \"Many of the city\\u2019s skyscrapers, I learned, were seen as contributions to the postmodern architecture movement. \\u201cPoMo,\\u201d in the shorthand favored in the architecture world, began to emerge in the 1960s as a reaction to the white-walled minimalism of modernist architecture, epitomized by Mies van der Rohe\\u2019s oft-quoted dictum \\u201cLess is more.\\u201d Early PoMo architects like Charles Moore and Robert Venturi rejected this formula \\u2014 \\u201cLess is a bore,\\u201d Venturi famously quipped \\u2014 and sought to inject color, iconography and kitschy nods to historical ornamentation into their designs. In the Southwest, this tendency bloomed in the 1980s during the savings-and-loan boom.\", \"Unlike modernists, PoMo architects conceived their buildings as dynamic components of urban life, not as exalted geometric abstractions. They wanted to create theatrical set pieces that visitors could navigate experientially, almost like at an amusement park. Moore argued cheekily that the most authentic urban experience available in the American West, where so many cities emerged after the invention of the automobile, was Disneyland, whose eclectic historical references and architectural playfulness encouraged a participatory experience of public space. Were some of the resulting buildings provocative? Certainly. Gaudy? No doubt. When the real estate bubble burst at the end of the 1980s, PoMo buildings were roundly dismissed as tacky and targeted for demolition. Now a new generation of architects is arguing that PoMo spaces are architectural landmarks that deserve re-evaluation.\", \"On my first trip home after joining the magazine, I decided to explore some PoMo sites for myself. I discovered a trove of delightfully eccentric urban environments I had never encountered growing up, a secret map of magnificent lobbies and semipublic piazzas hidden behind the city\\u2019s corporate facades. I was thrilled by the battlement-shaped Cityplace Tower that looms beside Central Expressway like a colossal sentinel, its grounds containing a Grecian amphitheater and the city\\u2019s only underground subway station. My favorite find was the Plaza of the Americas, a complex known for its 13-story indoor atrium, which was immortalized in the 1987 film \\u201cRoboCop.\\u201d With capsule elevators zooming up and down, inward-facing concrete balconies from the adjoining hotel, gargantuan glass skylights and access to the \\u201cDallas Pedestrian Network\\u201d \\u2014 a warren of tunnels and sky bridges connecting many of downtown Dallas\\u2019s buildings \\u2014 it makes for a grandiose and strange urban experience, part Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, part abandoned shopping mall.\", \"It was during a recent canal-side stroll in Las Colinas, an extravagant experiment to create an \\u201calternative downtown\\u201d on Dallas\\u2019s outskirts, that I realized I had come to see my hometown in a new light. Walking beside a defunct monorail from the 1980s, while a collection of skyscrapers towered overhead and a stripes-clad gondolier punted by, I found a spatial identity as evocative of its era as anything from the Art Deco or neoclassical days. I\\u2019d developed a rueful affection for PoMo\\u2019s theatrical vision of urban life, scattered in far-flung semipublic environments or among glass corporate facades \\u2014 a vision I hadn\\u2019t experienced as a child. Dallas\\u2019s postmodern cityscapes offer a conception \\u2014 though largely unrealized \\u2014 of how car-centric cities can carve out communal urban spaces tailored to their logic.\", \"When I moved to Berlin, I fell for the drama of its rich architectural past, the feeling that the closer you inspected, the more there was to discover. I had thought this was an experience unavailable to a city like Dallas, but it turned out I just hadn\\u2019t known where to look.\"]","href_hash":"b5cb186551c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b5cb186551c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}},
