So I don't understand why we're not doing it.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"The Ohio Republican also said that while not \\\"top of the line,\\\" anti-aircraft systems like the S-300 are still \\\"very effective.\\\"\", \"\\\"At a minimum, let's get those into Ukraine. And let's stop talking about it. Let's do it,\\\" he told CNN from Poland. \\\"But the airplanes are also essential.\\\"\", \"Klobuchar, also on CNN, said she spoke with President Biden roughly 10 days ago and made clear that she supports sending fighter jets to Ukraine.\", \"\\\"I still don't rule out having planes at some point. But, again, you take one day at a time and make the best defense system decisions,\\\" she said. \\\"And that can't always be discussed on the air, or you would be giving Vladimir Putin the road map to what NATO wants to do here to help protect Ukraine.\\\"\", \"Still, the Minnesota Democrat said planes, drones or Stingers and Javelin missiles would help Ukraine protect itself against Russia's continued attacks.\", \"\\\"One of the things we have to remember is, this is all about air defense,\\\" she said.\", \"The U.S. had been working on a deal with Poland to send their Russian-made aircraft to Ukraine, and Secretary of State Antony Blinken told \\\"Face the Nation\\\" last week that the Polish government had \\\"a green-light\\\" for sending planes to Ukraine.\", \"But after Poland offered last week to deploy its MiG-29 jets to Ramstein Air Base, a U.S. military installation in Germany, and \\\"place them at the disposal\\\" of the U.S., the Pentagon rejected the proposal, saying it is not a \\\"tenable one.\\\"\", \"Still, top officials in Ukraine have continued to urge the U.S. and allies to give the country fighter jets. On Sunday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said warplanes are the \\\"highest demand\\\" and the \\\"most pressing issue.\\\"\", \"\\\"If we lose control over the sky, we cannot prevent two things from happening: We cannot stop Russian bombers destroy[ing] our cities and killing civilians. And we cannot destroy Russian columns heading towards our big cities on the roads,\\\" Kuleba said in an interview with \\\"Face the Nation,\\\"\\u00a0when asked what types of military equipment Ukraine needs from allies and partners. \\\"To achieve these two purposes, we need more planes.\\\"\", \"Kuleba called the back-and-forth last week over plans to give Ukraine jets a \\\"diplomatic mystery\\\" that was reminiscent of a game of ping-pong.\"]","href_hash":"5eed14f4a3a511ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5eed14f4a3a511ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
