Many of us felt seen when, last April, the organizational psychologist Adam Grant wrote of languishing, \\u201ca sense of stagnation and emptiness \\u2026 as if you\\u2019re muddling through your days, looking at your life through a foggy windshield.\\u201d There was a relief in having a name for our experience, and a kind of solace in realizing that we weren\\u2019t alone in experiencing it. But now, nearly a year later, as with just about everything related to Covid, we\\u2019re sick of languishing too.\", \"We want to feel motivated, and to get unstuck. The question, of course, is: How? Sometimes when we are languishing and feeling exhausted \\u2014 emotionally, physically, socially or spiritually \\u2014 the best thing we can do is rest. But at a certain point, rest creates inertia. Our minds and our bodies are as recovered as they\\u2019re going to be. Yet we still feel off. At this point, many can benefit from deploying a psychological concept called behavioral activation.\", \"First developed in the 1970s by the clinical psychologist Peter Lewinsohn as a way to help people work through depression, apathy and negative moods, behavioral activation is based on the idea that action can create motivation, especially when you\\u2019re in a rut.\", \"To be clear, this is not about trying to think positive thoughts, a mantra that became a pillar of the self-esteem movement last century, with mega-best-selling books such as 1952\\u2019s \\u201cThe Power of Positive Thinking\\u201d arguing \\u2014 we now know, falsely \\u2014 that if you just think positive thoughts and suppress negative ones you\\u2019ll gain health, wealth and happiness. If anything, research has shown that those strategies often backfire: The more you try to change how you feel, the more stuck in your current mood you\\u2019re likely to end up. As much as you might want to, you cannot control your thoughts or feelings.\", \"The challenge with behavioral activation is mustering enough energy to start acting on the things that matter to you: Make that phone call, schedule that walk with friends, write that email, get off social media and start on the creative project you\\u2019ve been procrastinating on. This may sound simple, but when you are languishing, simple does not mean easy.\", \"But a mind-set shift can be a powerful tool. When you feel down, unmotivated or apathetic, you can give yourself permission to feel those feelings, but not dwell on them or take them as destiny. Instead, you shift the focus to getting started with what you have planned in front of you, taking your feelings, whatever they may be, along for the ride. Doing so gives you the best chance at improving your mood.\", \"It can be helpful to think of this initial umph as activation energy. Sometimes we need more and sometimes we need less. For many of us, even the little things require more these days, and that\\u2019s OK. It won\\u2019t be like this forever. If anything, the more we get going, the easier it becomes. Just like rest and languishing can create inertia that builds on itself, action and energy can be self-reinforcing. It just takes some extra work to overcome the initial stasis and friction \\u2014 it can feel like the laws of physics apply to our psyches, too.\", \"To be sure, behavioral activation is not a be-all, end-all for people experiencing depression, anxiety or other mental health challenges \\u2014 but it can be an extremely effective tool, along with medication and therapy as needed.\", \"If you don\\u2019t know where to begin, a good place to start is by reflecting on what matters to you most, what provides you with a sense of well being and groundedness. Then ask yourself how to apply that activation energy strategically. What actions will give you the umph you need? For example, if improving your fitness would make you feel better, you might start with 30 minutes of daily movement. If creativity is what you\\u2019re missing, writing for an hour three days per week could restart that engine. If you lack loving connection, try planning an adventure (that feels safe) with your family or friends, or even schedule time for physical intimacy with a partner. You may not feel like getting started, but get started anyway, then see what happens. Your doing influences your being.\", \"This isn\\u2019t to suggest that you beat yourself up or give yourself a drill-sergeant lecture every morning. Indeed, a key step in the strategy is accepting its imperfections. Many of us are operating in less-than-ideal circumstances \\u2014 dealing with illness, financial stress, work anxiety, a lack of child care. Overcoming the inertia of languishing requires fierce self-discipline \\u2014 and a fierce compassion for oneself. You may think of these two qualities as opposites, but they are not. Research shows that being kind to yourself during hardships and challenges can increase resilience and strength.\", \"A mantra I use in my own life is, \\u201cThis is what\\u2019s happening right now. I\\u2019m doing the best that I can. Just get going, and see what happens.\\u201d I remind myself that sometimes the kindest thing I can do for myself is also the hardest thing to do \\u2014 and that what seems hard today might just make tomorrow feel a bit easier.\", \"Brad Stulberg is an executive coach who writes about performance and mental health. He is the author, most recently, of the personal development book \\u201cThe Practice of Groundedness.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"79af1cef8cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"79af1cef8cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}},
