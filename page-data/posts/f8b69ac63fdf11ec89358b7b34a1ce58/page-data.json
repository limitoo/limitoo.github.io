Israel, as the occupying power, does not have the right to veto the U.S. administration's decision,\\\" the statement said, per AP.\", \"Jerusalem has long been a contested city in the region, with Israel viewing the entire city as its capital, while Palestinians want East Jerusalem to be the capital of their future state. East Jerusalem, along with the Gaza Strip and West Bank, was captured by Israel during the 1967 war.\", \"Trump exacerbated the situation in 2017 when he officially recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and announced his plans to move the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to the holy city.\", \"During that move, the then-president downgraded the U.S.- Palestinian consulate's operations and placed them under his ambassador to Israel, according to the AP.
