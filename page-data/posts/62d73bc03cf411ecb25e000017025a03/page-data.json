Republican candidates also won the other top races in the state, for lieutenant governor and attorney general.\", \"All three races were high-profile, closely fought affairs. Yet there were no claims of fraud by the losers, no conspiracy theories about Venezuelan despots rigging voting machines, no spurious lawsuits demanding recounts. As of Wednesday afternoon, at least, the State Capitol in Richmond stands untouched.\", \"How refreshing to see adults accepting defeat with grace.\", \"And the stakes were plenty high. Democrats across the country had grown increasingly anxious over the polls coming out of Virginia, and for good reason. It\\u2019s considered a bellwether for the midterm elections, and Tuesday\\u2019s vote served as the first major referendum on the Biden era.\", \"The McAuliffe campaign\\u2019s reaction to his crushing loss? Gird yourselves. \\u201cCongratulations to Governor-elect Glenn Youngkin on his victory,\\u201d Mr. McAuliffe said in a statement Wednesday morning. \\u201cI hope Virginians will join me in wishing the best to him and his family.\\u201d\", \"Come again? Republican turnout was way up in key precincts; surely Mr. McAuliffe was teeing up to make some wild accusation about partisan operatives stuffing ballot boxes. \\u201cWhile last night we came up short, I am proud that we spent this campaign fighting for the values we so deeply believe in,\\u201d the statement said.\", \"It\\u2019s almost like listening to a foreign language, isn\\u2019t it? Over the past year, Americans have been subjected to an endless temper tantrum by one of the country\\u2019s two major political parties \\u2014 a party now led by people who have apparently lost the capacity to admit defeat. One year to the day since the polls closed in 2020, Donald Trump still hasn\\u2019t conceded that election. He couldn\\u2019t even muster the dignity and decorum to hand over the presidency to Joe Biden in person, skipping town on Inauguration Day like a crook on the lam.\", \"This can\\u2019t-accept-defeat mentality began in earnest before the 2016 election, which Mr. Trump said was rigged even after he won, and it has set the tone for all that has come since. It emboldened the absurd and dangerous campaign of lies about election fraud in 2020, which notably focused on the big cities where larger numbers of Black voters live. It led directly to the deadly Jan. 6 riot that Mr. Trump incited at the U.S. Capitol. And it continues to infect the party 10 months later, as top Republicans still refuse to acknowledge Mr. Biden as the legitimately elected president and Republican-led states pass laws to make it easier for their legislatures to overturn the will of the voters if they don\\u2019t like the result.\", \"Speaking of election fraud, Republicans have been strangely quiet on the topic this time around. Interesting how that works: When a Democrat wins, it\\u2019s ipso facto proof of fraud. When a Republican wins \\u2014 presto! \\u2014 the election is on the level. This is how so many top Republicans managed to keep a straight face in 2020 as they argued that votes for Mr. Biden were fraudulent even while votes for winning Republican candidates farther down the same ballot were magically untainted.\", \"Hey, Republicans! This does not have to be so hard. I guarantee that Democrats want to win just as badly as you do, and yet they take their lumps like grown-ups. All you have to do is value American democracy more than you value your own party\\u2019s hold on power.\", \"Here are some examples to learn from: In 2016, Hillary Clinton conceded less than a day after polls closed, even though she was running neck and neck with Mr. Trump in key swing states and was sitting on a popular-vote lead that would eventually swell to nearly three million votes. Then-President Barack Obama called Mr. Trump in the middle of the night to congratulate him; this is the most basic stuff of peaceful democratic transitions, and yet Mr. Trump could never bring himself to do it.\", \"Or recall what then-Vice President Al Gore did on Dec. 13, 2000, conceding one of the closest elections in more than a century after the Supreme Court ruled 5 to 4 to stop the vote counting in Florida. \\u201cI accept the finality of this outcome, which will be ratified next Monday in the Electoral College. And tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession,\\u201d Mr. Gore said in a nationally televised address that should stand as one of the most important moments in American history.\", \"Alas, Republicans these days seem more intent on deflecting criticism than on hearing it. Cue the references to Stacey Abrams, who refused to concede the 2018 Georgia governor\\u2019s race after losing to her Republican opponent, Brian Kemp. Agreed, that wasn\\u2019t good. It also wasn\\u2019t good that Mr. Kemp, as the secretary of state at the time, was in charge of running the election in which he was a candidate. After her defeat, she and others accused him of suppressing turnout by purging Georgia\\u2019s rolls of more than 1.4 million inactive voters. It\\u2019s worth noting that Ms. Abrams was not the incumbent and that no major Democratic figures publicly supported her refusal to concede.\", \"Losing is hard. It happens to everybody. But a concession is not just a symbolic gesture. It is the sine qua non of representative democracy \\u2014 a literal enactment of the loser\\u2019s acceptance of the legitimacy of his or her opponent. When a single candidate refuses to concede, it\\u2019s corrosive. When a sitting president and much of his party refuse to, it can turn deadly, as the world saw on Jan. 6.\", \"I\\u2019m no fan of Mr. Youngkin, but he won fair and square, just as Mr. Biden did a year ago. Maybe Mr. Youngkin\\u2019s victory will remind his party that it can still prevail in closely fought elections and accept the ones they lose. Meanwhile, Republicans should read Mr. McAuliffe\\u2019s statement and remember why it\\u2019s so important to lose gracefully.\"]","href_hash":"62d73bc03cf411ecb25e000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"62d73bc03cf411ecb25e000017025a03"}},
