In 1953, 15 years following the Man of Steel\\u2019s first tall-building leap, Harvey Kurtzman and Wally Wood satirized the hero \\u2014 giving him the alter ego Clark Bent, who worked at the Daily Dirt newspaper \\u2014 for the fourth issue of a new humor comic called Mad. Superduperman was a \\u201cproduct of \\u201950s neuroses,\\u201d Jeremy Dauber writes in \\u201cAmerican Comics,\\u201d an entertaining and richly detailed new history of comics. \\u201cSex and capital are behind comics, \\u2018Superduperman\\u2019 suggests, not virtue or grand ideals. \\u2026 But Mad elevated such parody to a way of life.\\u201d\", \"As in his previous \\u201cJewish Comedy: A Serious History,\\u201d Dauber, who teaches a course on graphic novels at Columbia University, has written a scholarly survey that is both opinionated and frequently funny. He starts things off with the 19th-century cartoonist Thomas Nast, who popularized Santa Claus and Uncle Sam on his way to deploying his \\u201cTammany Tiger\\u201d to take down Boss Tweed\\u2019s political machine. From there Dauber traces the turn-of-the-century explosion of newspaper comics, the advent of comic books, underground comics, fan culture, and finally graphic novels and web comics.\", \"The book is most fun when Dauber turns up what Greil Marcus called history\\u2019s \\u201clipstick traces,\\u201d illuminating the hidden sources of modern culture. He traces the influences of both Jewish and hot rod magazines on underground comics, and finds unexpected early examples of autobiographical works in the form, including the 1931 \\u201cFour Students Comic,\\u201d about Japanese immigrant students. Despite his book\\u2019s title, Dauber also pays close attention to non-American traditions such as the French and Belgian bande dessin\\u00e9e and especially Japanese manga, the extraordinarily popular genre that would go on to influence American artists from Frank Miller to Art Spiegelman. (In the 1970s Spiegelman read Keiji Nakazawa\\u2019s stunning manga series \\u201cBarefoot Gen,\\u201d about the atomic bombing of Nakazawa\\u2019s hometown, Hiroshima; in 1980, Spiegelman changed comics history with the debut of his landmark \\u201cMaus,\\u201d which likewise explored historical trauma through intimate autobiography.)\", \"Dauber is particularly nuanced in dealing with the many controversies buffeting comics past and present, from debates over comics codes and depictions of sex and violence to questions of diversity, representation and authority \\u201cplayed out through the stretch of spandex.\\u201d He identifies comics\\u2019 \\u201coriginal sin\\u201d as the publishers\\u2019 failure to give creators proper credit, compensation and rights to their work. From there, he digs deep into comics economics, beginning with the $130 once paid to Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster for Superman and landing at the current multi-platform, multi-billion-dollar industry. There is no shortage of bitter ironies in this part of the tale: \\u201cIn something that felt like an overdetermined symbol, the original check for $130 made out to Siegel and Shuster for Superman, the site of the grandest battle between creator and corporation, netted $160,000 at auction in 2012.\\u201d\", \"Although the book doesn\\u2019t include images, Dauber packs in names and titles as fiercely as Kurtzman and Wood once packed gags in Mad panels; readers will want to tally up a list for future reading. But it\\u2019s not all here. Nast aside, Dauber generally doesn\\u2019t include political cartoons in his survey. All histories are subjective (he clearly calls this \\u201ca history\\u201d for a reason), but it\\u2019s jarring not to see a name like Herblock in a book that begins with Thomas Nast.\", \"The biggest miss, however, is in newspaper comic strips. Dauber trips up on early newspaper history at times, mangling the story of how William Randolph Hearst came to call his New York newspaper The American (it was during a 1901 controversy over an Ambrose Bierce poem and the McKinley assassination, not World War I) and stating incorrectly that George Herriman\\u2019s Krazy Kat and Ignatz Mouse are both of indeterminate gender (it\\u2019s only Krazy; the brick-happy mouse is, by all appearances, cisgender male). He skips over decades of vital mid-20th-century newspaper work, often bringing up the strip cartoonists only when making a point about their decline or commercialization, or comparing them to comics in other forms; this is true even about a work as significant as Charles M. Schulz\\u2019s \\u201cPeanuts.\\u201d He writes well about women\\u2019s comics and the Black press, but with rare exceptions such as Jules Feiffer\\u2019s legendary run in The Village Voice, alternative weekly newspapers are not given their due as springboards for cartoonists ranging from Matt Groening to Lynda Barry to Chris Ware to Derf Backderf, each of whom is discussed in relation to books and other later works, but not strips. (How can a comics history not name-check Barry\\u2019s deeply felt \\u201cErnie Pook\\u2019s Comeek\\u201d?)\", \"Still, the story Dauber tells is a mighty one, and in the end, Superduperman may be its real hero. Throughout comics history, the work is pushed forward by what Dauber, in a discussion about the cartoonist Dave Sim, calls the \\u201cparodic sensibility.\\u201d It is these parodies that most enliven the works discussed in \\u201cAmerican Comics.\\u201d There\\u2019s parody as homage. Parody as cutting, vicious criticism. Parody as cheap laughs; parody as genius. Dauber ably demonstrates that comics, as much as or more than any other art or literature, can handle the most serious of topics, including one of the most serious of all: our ability to laugh at ourselves.\"]","href_hash":"5760cf6c46fa11eca571ef34f3e64c55"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5760cf6c46fa11eca571ef34f3e64c55"}},
