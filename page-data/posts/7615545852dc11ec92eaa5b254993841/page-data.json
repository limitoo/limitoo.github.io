Their harmful effects were demonstrated after it was revealed Harvey Weinstein\\u00a0systematically used NDAs\\u00a0to prevent his victims from talking about his conduct.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7f1a259cf31456c5eccfa96d9bee254e\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Former film producer\\u00a0Harvey Weinstein systematically used NDAs to prevent his victims from talking about his conduct.(AP: Seth Wenig)</div>\", \"But the silencing effect of these agreements has not yet received the same attention in Australia.\", \"That has now changed with the release of Jenkins'\\u00a0Respect@Work Report\\u00a0last year and the new Set the Standard report released this week.\", \"Both have recommend changes to the use of NDAs in relation to sexual harassment and bullying cases. The time has come for a serious re-evaluation of these agreements.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What is an NDA?</div>\", \"NDAs are restrictive confidentiality arrangements. They can have a legitimate role in, for instance, protecting company secrets, such as patents or intellectual property. Such agreements are designed to ensure a person or organisation who gets access to sensitive and often valuable information does not disclose it to a third party.\", \"However, these agreements have been exploited and their use extended far beyond their original limited function.\", \"NDAs are now increasingly used against employees who make complaints about discrimination and harassment. Organisations often settle these matters by compensating and then terminating the employment of the person who made the complaint, but on the condition that person signs an NDA forbidding them from disclosing the bullying or harassment.\", \"Indeed,\\u00a0lawyers say\\u00a0NDAs have become standard practice for employers dealing with sexual harassment complaints in Australia.\", \"The widespread use of NDAs is also reflected in a statement made by the union representing public sector employees to the Jenkins' inquiry. It said it is common\", \"The problem with this practice is the offending conduct is never formally \\\"known about\\\" by senior leaders in the organisation \\u2014 or the public.\", \"Oftentimes, the perpetrator stays at the organisation and is promoted. Or they move on to another organisation where the offending conduct continues. Meanwhile, senior managers and human resources simply deny knowledge of the problem.\", \"In contrast, the victim-survivor is stigmatised and condemned to silence in perpetuity, unable to defend themselves or even to talk about what happened.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What did the Jenkins' report say about NDAs?</div>\", \"In the report, the Human Rights Commission has reiterated its serious concerns with the use of NDAs in Australia.\", \"It says these agreements \\\"should not be made a condition of settlement of complaints\\\" because\", \"Instead, the report says, NDAs should be optional for the complainant as a way of protecting their privacy, rather than a \\\"blanket condition of settlement\\\".\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/69d55b7ed791498bf7d0da433353bbae\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Review finds 1 in 3 Parliament workers experienced sexual harassment</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What, then, can be done about this?</div>\", \"California has set the best practice in this regard, passing\\u00a0a law in 2018 that bans the use of NDAs in sexual harassment cases.\", \"More recently, the state has built on this by passing the \\\"Silenced No More Act\\\" in October this year. This legislation will protect workers who want to speak out about harassment and discrimination, even if they have signed a non-disclosure agreement. It also extends to workplace harassment or discrimination on any basis, not just sex.\", \"In supporting the legislation, California Senator Connie Leyva\\u00a0said,\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How can the law be reformed in Australia?</div>\", \"It is clear NDAs have a chilling effect on people's willingness to speak out against harassment and bullying. Significantly, these agreements not only silence those coerced into signing them, but also discourage openness and suppress transparency and accountability in workplaces.\", \"They also have a detrimental, systemic effect by signalling to other employees they must self-censor if they experience similar workplace harms, rendering them fearful of speaking out.\", \"The Set the Standard report \\u2014 and the broader #MeToo movement \\u2014 send a clear message: every workplace and organisation in Australia can, and must, do better to prevent an epidemic of bad behaviour.\", \"It is, therefore, time for Australia to ban the use of NDAs in situations involving harassment or bullying.\", \"We note others in Australia have also made such a recommendation. The Australian Law Alliance, for instance,\\u00a0has called for\\u00a0banning the use of NDAs in all harassment and discrimination cases, except when requested by survivors.\", \"Now that Jenkins has released not one, but two significant reports on workplace protections \\u2014 both of which show the true extent of workplace harassment and silencing \\u2014 we must take a step toward protecting victims by introducing laws to reform the use of NDAs in Australia.\", \"Maria O'Sullivan is an associate professor in the Faculty of Law, and deputy director of the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law at Monash University.
