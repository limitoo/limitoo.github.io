The meeting was shut down as an \\\"unlawful assembly\\\" by local police after parents and others protested against \\\"critical race theory\\\" (CRT) and policies protecting transgender students.\", \"In contrast, Youngkin's campaign has centered on supporting parents who have opposed mask mandates, CRT, \\\"objectionable\\\" content and protections for transgender students. Youngkin has called his rallies \\\"parents matter\\\" events. One of Youngkin's political ads, released in early October, claimed that \\\"the FBI is trying to silence parents\\\" after Garland's memo.\", \"McDaniel's claims about McAuliffe refer to a September 29 letter from the National School Boards Association (NSBA) referencing the threats against educators. The letter said the threats could be equivalent to \\\"domestic terrorism.\\\" But Garland's memo didn't use the phrase and McAuliffe hasn't repeated it either. The NSBA later apologized for using it.\", \"Rather, McAuliffe and Democrats have sought to tie Youngkin to Trump. The campaign has highlighted Youngkin's early campaign comment that \\\"Trump represents so much of why I'm running.\\\" The campaign has also posed Youngkin as a return to \\\"divisive culture wars\\\" and a threat to voting access, reproductive freedoms and other social progress made under state Democratic leadership.\", \"Polls leading into the weekend showed McAuliffe and Youngkin as having razor-thin leads over one another. A Republican hasn't won a statewide race in Virginia in over a decade. In 2020, Biden carried the state by a margin of over 10 points.\", \"Saturday was the final day of Virginia's early voting period. Over 1.1 million out of the state's 5.9 million registered voters have already cast their ballots.\"]","href_hash":"57fdd88e3b6a11ec8b22000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"57fdd88e3b6a11ec8b22000017025a03"}},
