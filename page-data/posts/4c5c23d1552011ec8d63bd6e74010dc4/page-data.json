For months, their once-daily meals had grown more sparse as harvests failed, wells ran dry and credit for flour from shopkeepers ran out.\", \"Now as the crisp air grew colder, reality was setting in: Their children might not survive the winter.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m very afraid, this winter will be even worse than we can imagine,\\u201d said Laltak, 40, who like many women in rural Afghanistan goes by only one name.\", \"Nearly four months since the Taliban seized power, Afghanistan is on the brink of a mass starvation that aid groups say threatens to kill a million children this winter \\u2014 a toll that would dwarf the total number of Afghan civilians estimated to have been killed as a direct result of the war over the past 20 years.\", \"While Afghanistan has suffered from malnutrition for decades, the country\\u2019s hunger crisis has drastically worsened in recent months. This winter, an estimated 22.8 million people \\u2014 more than half the population \\u2014 are expected to face potentially life-threatening levels of food insecurity, according to an analysis by the United Nations World Food Program and Food and Agriculture Organization. Of those, 8.7 million people are nearing famine \\u2014 the worst stage of a food crisis.\", \"Such widespread hunger is the most devastating sign of the economic crash that has crippled Afghanistan since the Taliban seized power. Practically overnight, billions of dollars in foreign aid that propped up the previous Western-backed government vanished and U.S. sanctions on the Taliban isolated the country from the global financial system, paralyzing Afghan banks and impeding relief work by humanitarian organizations.\", \"Across the country, millions of Afghans \\u2014 from day laborers to doctors and teachers \\u2014 have gone months without steady or any incomes. The prices of food and other basic goods have soared beyond the reach of many families. Emaciated children and anemic mothers have flooded into the malnutrition wards of hospitals, many of those facilities bereft of medical supplies that donor aid once provided.\", \"Compounding its economic woes, the country is confronting one of the worst droughts in decades, which has withered fields, starved farm animals and dried irrigation channels. Afghanistan\\u2019s wheat harvest is expected to be as much as 25 percent below average this year, according to the United Nations. In rural areas \\u2014 where roughly 70 percent of the population lives \\u2014 many farmers have given up cultivating their land.\", \"Now, as freezing winter weather sets in, with humanitarian organizations warning that a million children could die, the crisis is potentially damning to both the new Taliban government and to the United States, which is facing mounting pressure to ease the economic restrictions that are worsening the crisis.\", \"\\u201cWe need to separate the politics from the humanitarian imperative,\\u201d said Mary-Ellen McGroarty, the World Food Program\\u2019s country director for Afghanistan. \\u201cThe millions of women, of children, of men in the current crisis in Afghanistan are innocent people who are being condemned to a winter of absolute desperation and potentially death.\\u201d\", \"In Shah Wali Kot, a barren district in Kandahar Province, the drought and economic crash have converged in a perfect storm.\", \"For decades, small farmers survived the winters on stored wheat from their summer harvest and the income from selling onions in the market. But this year yielded barely enough to sustain families during the fall months. Without food to last the winter, some people migrated to cities hoping to find work or to other districts to lean on the help of relatives.\", \"Inside one of the two mud huts of the clinic, which is run by the Afghan Red Crescent and supported by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Laltak clutched her granddaughter\\u2019s gaunt frame as if steeling herself for the hardships she knew this winter would bring.\", \"Her family has no wheat left, no wood to make fires for heat, no money to buy food. They have exhausted the support of nearby relatives who cannot even feed their own families. \", \"\\u201cNothing, we have nothing,\\u201d Laltak said in an interview at the end of October.\", \"She and most of the mothers interviewed did not own cellphones or have phone service in their villages, so The Times could not follow up with them on the health of their children.\", \"The humanitarian catastrophe unfolding in Afghanistan comes as hunger has steadily risen around the world in recent years, driven by the coronavirus pandemic, conflict and climate-related shocks.\", \"Thirty percent more Afghans faced crisis-level food shortages in September and October compared with the same period last year, according to the United Nations. In the coming months, the number of Afghans in crisis is expected to hit a record high.\", \"\\u201cIt was never this bad,\\u201d said Sifatullah Sifat, the head doctor at the Shamsul Haq clinic on the outskirts of Kandahar city, where malnutrition cases have doubled in recent months. \\u201cDonors are shipping in medicine, but it\\u2019s still not enough.\\u201d\", \"By 10 a.m. each morning, a throng of mothers carrying skeletal children masses in the hallway of the malnutrition unit.\", \"Inside an examination room in October, Zarmina, 20, cradled her 18-month-old son while her 3-year-old daughter stood behind her, clutching her blue burqa. Since the Taliban seized power and her husband\\u2019s work as a day laborer dried up, her family has survived on mostly bread and tea \\u2014 meals that left her children\\u2019s stomachs gnawing with hunger.\", \"\\u201cThey are crying to have food. I wish I could bring them something, but we have nothing,\\u201d said Zarmina, who is six months pregnant and severely anemic.\", \"Zarmina\\u2019s son had grown frail after weeks of diarrhea. He stared blankly at the wall as a nurse wrapped a color-coded measuring band used to diagnose malnutrition around his rail-thin arm, stopping at the color red: Severe malnourishment.\", \"As the nurse told Zarmina that he needed to go to the hospital for treatment, another mother barged into the room and collapsed on the floor, demanding help for her infant daughter.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s been almost one week, I can\\u2019t get medicine for her,\\u201d she pleaded.\", \"The nurse begged her to wait: Her daughter\\u2019s malnutrition was considered only moderate.\", \"Since the Taliban seized power, the United States and other Western donors have grappled with delicate questions over how to avert a humanitarian catastrophe in Afghanistan without granting the new regime legitimacy by removing sanctions or putting money directly into the Taliban\\u2019s hands.\", \"\\u201cWe believe that it\\u2019s essential that we maintain our sanctions against the Taliban but at the same time find ways for legitimate humanitarian assistance to get to the Afghan people. That\\u2019s exactly what we\\u2019re doing,\\u201d the deputy U.S. Treasury secretary, Wally Adeyemo, told the Senate Banking Committee in October.\", \"But as the humanitarian situation has worsened, aid organizations have called on the United States to move more quickly. \", \"American officials showed some flexibility around loosening the economic chokehold on Afghanistan last week, when the World Bank\\u2019s board \\u2014 which includes the United States \\u2014 moved to free up $280 million in frozen donor funding for the World Food Program and UNICEF. Still, the sum is just a portion of the $1.5 billion frozen by the World Bank amid pressure from the United States Treasury after the Taliban took control.\", \"How those released funds will be transferred into Afghanistan remains unclear. Despite letters that the U.S. Treasury Department recently issued to foreign banks assuring them they can process humanitarian transactions to Afghanistan, many financial institutions remain fearful of exposure to U.S. sanctions.\", \"The Taliban government has repeatedly called on the Biden administration to ease economic restrictions and has worked with international organizations to deliver some assistance. But already, millions of Afghans have been pushed over the edge.\", \"At Mirwais Regional Hospital in Kandahar this fall, children suffering from malnutrition and disease crowded onto the pediatric ward\\u2019s worn metal beds. In the intensive care unit, an eerie silence filled the large room as children too weak to cry visibly wasted away, their breath labored and skin sagging off protruding bones.\", \"\\u201cI wanted to bring her to the hospital earlier,\\u201d said Rooqia, 40, looking down at her one-a-half-year-old daughter, Amina. \\u201cBut I had no money, I couldn\\u2019t come.\\u201d\", \"Like many other mothers and grandmothers in the ward, they had come from western Kandahar where over the past two years irrigation channels have run dry and more recently, pantries emptied. Amina started to shrivel \\u2014 her skin so drained of life-sustaining vitamins that patches peeled away.\", \"On a bed nearby, Madina, 2, let out a soft wail as her grandmother, Harzato, 50, readjusted her sweater. Harzato had taken the girl to the local pharmacist three times begging for medicine until he told her there was nothing more he could do: Only a doctor could save the child.\", \"\\u201cWe were so far from the hospital, I was worried and depressed,\\u201d Harzato said. \\u201cI thought she might not make it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4c5c23d1552011ec8d63bd6e74010dc4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4c5c23d1552011ec8d63bd6e74010dc4"}},
