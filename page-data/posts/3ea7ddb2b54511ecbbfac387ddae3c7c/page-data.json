On average, women in their 40s have about $10,000 (or 30 percent) less money in their KiwiSaver than men.

This is true for each age band from 31 years and over. For ages up to 30 years, there are more men than women.\", \"Te Ara Ahunga Ora director of policy Dr Suzy Morrissey said the disparity was expected and likely reflected the combined impact of the gender and ethnic pay gaps, time out of paid work, and more women than men working part-time.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/290795/four_col_Suzy-Morrissey-1.jpg?1649117773\\\" alt=\\\"Te Ara Ahunga Ora director of policy Dr Suzy Morrissey\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nTe Ara Ahunga Ora director of policy Dr Suzy Morrissey \\nPhoto: Supplied\\n</div>\", \"\\\"Given KiwiSaver is a retirement savings scheme closely associated with the labour market, this report provides robust data to further highlight the gender savings gap, which is apparent across all age groups,\\\" she said.\", \"This study did not examine ethnicity, because providers did not collect that data. And KiwiSaver providers only coded data as belonging to men and women, so there was no data on non-binary and other genders.\", \"But the picture is likely to be worse for people of M\\u0101ori, Pasifika and Asian descent, especially women.\", \"Stats NZ figures show a gender wage gap meaning that for every $1 a P\\u0101keh\\u0101 man earns, a P\\u0101keh\\u0101 woman earns $0.89, M\\u0101ori and Asian men earn $0.86, an Asian woman earns $0.83, a Pasifika man earns $0.81, a M\\u0101ori woman earns $0.81, and a Pasifika woman earns $0.75.\", \"This effectively means Pasifika women are working for free for a quarter of the year and directly influences income-based retirement savings such as KiwiSaver.\", \"University of Auckland Business School research fellow Dr Claire Dale wanted to see ethnicity data as well as the gender breakdown of KiwiSaver hardship withdrawals, because Australian figures show women's retirement balances were disproportionately withdrawn during the pandemic and she suspected the same was true here.\", \"Dale said there were several changes that the government and employers could make to start to fix the gap, including employers voluntarily continuing paying into parents' KiwiSavers while they were on parental leave, and the government contributing the $521 tax credit for beneficiaries regardless of individual payments.\", \"\\\"One of the things we can do is encourage men to take paid parental leave, making it compulsory for firms to offer equivalent paid parental leave to men. It's where a policy change can make a huge difference.\\\"\", \"Mind the Gap co-leader Dellwyn Stuart said women living longer combined with having less saved for retirement made them vulnerable in older age, and a gender lens needed to be brought to policymaking. Women also needed to be paid more.\", \"\\\"At Mind the Gap, we're campaigning for pay gap reporting so you can create some transparency and people can actually see which organisations have significant gaps,\\\" she said. \\\"And what overseas experience shows is that businesses then work on closing those gaps. So there's little levers like that, that there's not a big change in law, but can make a significant change to what women earn.\", \"\\\"My daughters are now in their 20s and they're merging into workplaces where this exists ... it's just not okay. It's 2022... So we've got to believe we can change it, right?

Te Ara Ahunga Ora also asked the report's authors, actuaries Melville Jessup Weaver, to come up with hypothetical scenarios of a median wage invested over KiwiSaver's lifetime, compared to actual balances.\", \"That exercise showed balances are lower than they could be across all age groups, part of which can be attributed to savings suspensions, delayed sign-ups, and first-home deposit withdrawals.\", \"Morrissey said this reinforced that KiwiSaver should be a lifetime effort, as well as the importance of New Zealand Super, which was available to everyone regardless of gender and ethnicity.\", \"\\\"We know that people are using it more and more for first-home withdrawals, which is great, because we know that homeownership in retirement really provides a greater level of wellbeing than renting in retirement,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"But [it's] really important to keep the KiwiSaver contribution going after the first-home withdrawal so that there is also retirement savings available for people.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"3ea7ddb2b54511ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3ea7ddb2b54511ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
