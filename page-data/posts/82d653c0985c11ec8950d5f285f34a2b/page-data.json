While most respondents experienced an overall good quality of life last year, the demographics show it was the same people feeling that they had a lower quality of life as seen in previous years with consistent factors influencing this,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Particularly concerning are results relating to mental health: the general sense of resilience is down this year and one-fifth of respondents rated their mental wellbeing as being poor or very poor. We've no doubt all experienced this ourselves or seen it in others, and it's an important reminder to be kind and patient with one another.\", \"\\\"Findings like this highlight the importance of different organisations working together and I'm particularly encouraged by some of the latest work in this space. For example, the broad coalition of agencies including council and [Southern] DHB involved in Te Hau Toka.
