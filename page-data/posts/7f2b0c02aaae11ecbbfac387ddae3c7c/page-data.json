Our second crew member (Maurer) will be in free float, traversing many locations to accomplish many of the tasks that we have scheduled.\\\"\", \"Floating in the Quest airlock, the astronauts switched their spacesuits to battery power at 8:32 a.m. EDT to officially kick off the 248th spacewalk in ISS history, the third so far this year, the second for Chari and the first for Maurer.\", \"Chari, anchored to the end of the space station's robot arm, plans to install the ammonia jumpers, work with Maurer to attach and connect the TV camera and attach two handling fixtures to an external radiator assembly.\", \"Maurer will float from work site to work site, making power and data connections on the European Bartolomeo instrument platform, tying down a pulled-up insulation blanket on the Japanese Kibo module and helping Chari connect the new TV camera.\", \"He also plans to carry out a variety of other tasks, including work to loosen bolts in a solar array electronics assembly to facilitate future component changeouts and to run a power cable to a coolant pump module.\", \"The space station circulates ammonia through heat exchangers out to six radiators, three on each side of the lab's power truss, to dissipate the heat generated by the station's electronics. The ammonia is routed to the radiators through hoses from \\\"radiator beam valve modules,\\\" or RBVMs, that can be rotated with respect to the sun to maximize cooling\", \"In 2017, a slight leak was detected in jumpers running between one radiator panel and an RBVM. The hoses were bypassed, removed, taken back to Earth, refurbished and relaunched for installation by, as it turns out, Chari.\", \"The spacewalk is expected to last about six-and-a-half hours.\", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News. He covered 129 space shuttle missions, every interplanetary flight since Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune and scores of commercial and military launches. Based at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Harwood is a devoted amateur astronomer and co-author of \\\"Comm Check: The Final Flight of Shuttle Columbia.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"7f2b0c02aaae11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7f2b0c02aaae11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
