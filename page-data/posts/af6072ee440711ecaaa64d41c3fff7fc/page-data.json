With the result that the category has moved toward stretch and comfort and away from those old Hollywood representations of glamour.\", \"But that doesn\\u2019t mean there isn\\u2019t something still alluring about the idea of lounging around at home in silk and satin. Or that it can\\u2019t be empowering. Those women of the silver screen did, after all, often talk circles around their male co-stars, and Nora Charles was a crack detective.\", \"As Cora Harrington, also known as the blogger \\u201cThe Lingerie Addict\\u201d and author of \\u201cIn Intimate Detail: How to Choose, Wear and Love Lingerie,\\u201d said when I emailed her, \\u201cThere\\u2019s a lavishness and a sensuality in this type of lingerie. Long trains, flowing sleeves, delicate lace, romantic satins, gauzy mesh \\u2014 these are the sorts of things that only work in the bedroom or private area of the modern-day individual. There\\u2019s an allowance for drama and indulgence, and I think many of us want that, even if we\\u2019re told we shouldn\\u2019t.\\u201d\", \"But where to find it?\", \"To discover an answer, I went to Liz Goldwyn, a writer, filmmaker, burlesque expert and founder of TheSexEd.com. \\u201cI regularly trawl Etsy looking for vintage 1940s loungewear,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt is the most ecoconscious way to achieve this vintage glam look, and modern cleaning is a miracle.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Harrington agreed, noting, \\u201cThere are always deals and treasures to be found there, many of which contain fabrics and details that are no longer financially feasible to reproduce.\\u201d\", \"If you don\\u2019t want to take a chance with vintage, however, and you are working on a budget, Ms. Goldwyn recommended Bettie Page Lingerie, especially the \\u201cshowgirl wrap tie PJ top and bottom,\\u201d and feather robes.\", \"Ms. Harrington suggested looking at KaFemme, from Ukraine, which, she said, \\u201clike a lot of Eastern European lingerie, is wonderfully lavish and over-the-top.\\u201d Check out this lace and gold gown and peignoir set.\", \"At the higher end of the scale (after all, a select few of these pieces might go a long way, and it\\u2019s not as if they go out of style; they\\u2019ve already been around for almost a century), or just for inspiration, Ms. Harrington said her \\u201cultimate peignoir/dressing gown experience\\u201d was Boudoir by D\\u2019Lish, which was \\u201cfounded by the noted burlesque performer Catherine D\\u2019Lish.\\u201d And Ms. Goldwyn directed me to this Lunya washable silk high rise pant set, \\u201ca modern, minimalist take on old Hollywood loungewear,\\u201d as well as Morgan Lane pajamas, for a Barbara Stanwyck or Jean Harlow vibe.\", \"Then go ahead and quote Myrna Loy: \\u201cThey say the movies should be more like life; I think life should be more like the movies.\\u201d\", \"Every week on Open Thread, Vanessa will answer a reader\\u2019s fashion-related question, which you can send to her anytime via email or Twitter.
