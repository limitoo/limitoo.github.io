to buy into the market.\", \"\\\"It is often actually cheaper to buy than to rent, and you are not then in that very competitive rental landscape we have seen since the pandemic began,\\\" she

Queensland.\", \"\\\"Borrowing up to a million dollars to buy the dream home first up is tantamount to a young person leaving home and they want to buy a Rolls-Royce.\", \"\\\"Most young people get a

buyers in the\\u00a0last 12 months is also testament to the affordability and the lifestyle on offer in Brisbane and across regional Queensland.\", \"\\\"In Brisbane and regional Queensland, pricing is much lower, Brisbane pricing is approximately half that of Sydney.\", \"\\\"But also around regional Queensland,\\u00a0there are lots of regional cities with very affordable options.\\\"\", \"Mr Ryder's top picks in the south-east were Logan, Ipswich, Moreton Bay and apartment living in Brisbane.\", \"He said regionally, sales data showed Toowoomba, Hervey Bay, Townsville Rockhampton, Mackay and Bundaberg still had houses on a block of land for $300,000 to $400,000, with apartments even cheaper.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Tightened bank lending restrictions</div>\", \"There were no doubt mortgage jitters, though, as banks started applying a higher mandatory interest rate buffer in case they go up again\\u00a0on loan applications from November 1.\", \"So what effect will that have on lending to first-home buyers?\", \"Mr Ryder believed there would be some impact but it would not be\\u00a0broad.\", \"\\\"There were some figures from one of the major banks recently that showed only 7 per cent\\u00a0of the customers who are borrowing are actually maximising to the absolute limit of their borrowing capacity, which means 93 per cent\\u00a0are not,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"So there is some leg room for that restriction and most people will still get the loans they can.\", \"\\\"And I don't think it is going to be any different this time.\\u00a0This up cycle will continue because there are so many powerful forces driving it at the moment.\\\"\", \"Ms Mercorella said she had heard horror stories of young buyers losing their entire deposits after defaulting on a contract because finance fell over and they had no \\\"get out free cards\\\" legally.\", \"\\\"So whilst I understand that there is a sense of urgency and there is FOMO floating around, fear of missing out, I would still say to first-home buyers that it is incredibly important that before you commit to a contract that you are absolutely confident you have your ducks in a row,\\\" she said.\", \"Ms Delaney did and has already had a champagne celebration ahead of moving in day.\", \"\\\"But every step of the way I had to consult with mum and dad. It is great to have other people in your life who have done it before to answer questions,\\\" she said.\", \"Plans for a Christmas \\\"first house\\\" party were in progress, while a meet and greet was underway of other owners as a new generation of buyers move in.\"]","href_hash":"d1f0d31240d311ec930823dba78e85fc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d1f0d31240d311ec930823dba78e85fc"}},
