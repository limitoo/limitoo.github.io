long-awaited Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide.\", \"Karen Bird's 32-year-old son Jesse Bird took his own life in 2017 weeks after losing a claim for permanent impairment he had been pursuing for almost two years.\", \"Speaking outside of the commission on its opening day, Ms Bird said although her son died four-and-a-half years ago, \\\"it's just like yesterday\\\".\", \"\\\"My son died in 2017, he was the 39th veteran to die in that year, 86\\u00a0veterans died in that year,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"The next year was worse and the year after wasn't much better.\\\"\", \"Ms Bird said she and her legal team would speak at the commission in the new year.\", \"Fighting back tears, she urged others to take the chance to have their say at the commission.\", \"\\\"There are so many issues at hand here, it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, veterans need to step forward and speak,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Their families need to step forward and speak their mind.\", \"\\\"The mothers and fathers out there who know their sons and daughters have been mistreated, they need to step forward and speak.\", \"\\\"Encourage their children to speak and if they don't have their children anymore, they need to step forward and speak on behalf of their deceased children.\", \"The royal commission started with a ceremonial hearing, with participants to begin giving evidence on Monday.\", \"It was established on July 8 this year to address high rates of suicide among those who have served in the Australian Defence Forces.\", \"The royal commission will consider systemic issues relevant to the death by suicide of defence members and veterans, as well as risk factors and protective measures and the availability of support services.\", \"An interim report is due by August 11 next year and a final report by June 15, 2023.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'This is not an easy process'</div>\", \"Nikki Jamieson lost her serviceman son Daniel to suicide in 2014.\", \"She said authorities should take heed of recommendations delivered in the interim report.\", \"\\\"It is my hope that some of the findings in the interim report are started to be translated into policy and practice as soon as possible,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Obviously, that involves much more commitment from both of the departments \\u2013 Defence and DVA \\u2013 into financing some mental health and wellbeing support, fully underpinned by lived experience, so we know we're getting it right 100 per cent of the time.\\\"\", \"Ms Jamieson said the royal commission would be difficult for many.\", \"\\\"I encourage everybody to reach out and seek support, this is not an easy process and it will be triggering for many, many people,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Please do reach out and seek the supports that you need.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">More than 1,200 deaths by suicide in the past two decades</div>\", \"The fourth annual report on suicide among ADF members was released in September by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW).\", \"It revealed there have been 1,273 certified deaths by suicide by men and women with ADF service since January 1, 1985.\", \"It found that suicide rates were higher among ex-ADF members who had served for less than a year, were aged under 50 or had left involuntarily due to medical reasons.\", \"<img

hundreds of confirmed suicides by current and former Defence Force personnel.(Supplied: Karen Bird)</div>\", \"Prime Minister Scott Morrison recommended the establishment of a royal commission in April after community calls for a national inquiry.\", \"\\\"We have always recognised that the rate of suicide of Australian Defence Force members and veterans is unacceptably high,\\\" Mr Morrison said at the time.\", \"\\\"In recognising the sacrifices made by our serving and former members and their families on behalf of the nation, we owe it to our members, veterans and their families to continue to take action.\\\"\", \"On the opening day of the commission, the Shadow Minister for Veteran's Affairs and Defence Personnel, Shayne Newmann, was asked by reporters if Labor would implement all of the royal commission's recommendations if it wins the next election.\", \"\\\"I'm not going to pre-empt the recommendations, but we'll take seriously every recommendation,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"If this royal commission hands down the kinds of recommendations that we believe it will, we'll take them on.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Once-in-a-generation opportunity for lasting, fundamental change'</div>\", \"As well as public hearings, which will take place around Australia, people can also make a submission online or apply for a private session.\", \"During private sessions, ADF members, veterans and their families will be able to share their experiences with a commissioner in a confidential location.\", \"The royal commission is chaired by Nick Kaldas, former deputy commissioner of the New South Wales Police Force.\", \"Other commissioners are James Douglas QC, a former Queensland Supreme Court judge,\\u00a0and Peggy Brown, a former CEO of the National Mental Health Commission.\", \"In his opening address to the commission, Mr Kaldas acknowledged the lives lost and the \\\"tireless\\\" efforts of those who have \\\"championed change\\\".\", \"\\\"On behalf of the nation, the establishment of this royal commission requires that we examine, understand and expose all systemic issues and risk factors concerning defence and veteran deaths by suicide \\u2013 and that we identify any and all actions necessary to address these issues and risks, so that we may reduce and prevent future deaths.\\\"\", \"He said the commission is empowered to investigate a wide range of issues, summon\\u00a0witnesses to appear and request that individuals or organisations produce evidence.\", \"\\\"If we succeed in our aims, we hope and pray that there will be no need for further inquiries of this kind into defence and veteran suicide.\\\"\", \"He said the commission has so far received more than 600 written submissions from organisations and individuals and more than 900 emails and hundreds of phone calls from people seeking to contribute.\", \"Mr Kaldas made a pledge to those affected by suicide.\", \"\\\"I make this promise: we will listen with empathy, we will act with compassion \\u2013 and without fear or favour \\u2013 and we will learn from your stories in order to make a real difference to the lives of serving and former personnel, and their families,\\\" Mr Kaldas said.\"]","href_hash":"72a2a01e4e6811ec89d8351078a4f5a9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"72a2a01e4e6811ec89d8351078a4f5a9"}},
