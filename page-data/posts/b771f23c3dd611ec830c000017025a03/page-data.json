But its story of a white professor helping immigrants feels out of step with the moment.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-04T17:22:01.000Z","content":"[\"What comes to mind when you think about immigration, ICE and deportation? I\\u2019m willing to bet more than a few George Washingtons that it\\u2019s not \\u201cmusical.\\u201d Perhaps it is doable to respect the politics around these issues and the immigrants trying to build a life in the United States in this format, but it\\u2019s tough. Which is why the new musical \\u201cThe Visitor\\u201d feels so obtuse and helplessly dated.\", \"Dated because it is based on Tom McCarthy\\u2019s 2008 film, a well-meaning artifact of the post-9/11 years about a couple of undocumented immigrants helping a white middle-aged professor get a new lease on life. The film resonated in a time before we had a president who fiercely fought to keep immigrants out, and before calls for diversity echoed throughout our institutions.\", \"In the film, an economics professor named Walter Vale travels to New York City from Connecticut to attend a conference, but while there, he finds a young couple living in his long-neglected apartment: Tarek, a drummer originally from Syria, and Zainab, a Senegalese jewelry designer. He lets them stay, and Tarek teaches him the drums. They live there until Tarek is unfairly picked up by the police for an infraction he didn\\u2019t commit and put in a detention center for being undocumented.\", \"The musical, which opened on Thursday at the Public Theater, is directed by Daniel Sullivan and has a book by Kwame Kwei-Armah and Brian Yorkey, who also wrote the lyrics. Tom Kitt (who also teamed up with Yorkey for the Pulitzer Prize-winning \\u201cNext to Normal\\u201d) adds music to this story, which arrives onstage with only minor changes.\", \"Long in the works, \\u201cThe Visitor\\u201d was scheduled to begin its performances in March 2020 \\u2014 practically a century ago in Pandemic Time. To stage the project now without a more significant overhaul of the story was a bold choice, especially with masking and quarantining coinciding with a reckoning about how people of color and their stories are \\u2014 or, more often, are not \\u2014 represented in theater and the arts.\", \"That\\u2019s not to say there haven\\u2019t been any modifications. First, previews were pushed back a week last month after cast members raised issues around depictions of race and representation. Then the departure of one of the leads, Ari\\u2019el Stachel, was announced in what the theater called \\u201ca mutual decision,\\u201d and last-minute edits were made in an attempt to refigure the way whiteness was centered in the production.\", \"David Hyde Pierce stars as Walter, a widower whose career and emotional life are as stagnant as a glass of lukewarm milk. Ahmad Maksoud, who was Stachel\\u2019s understudy, takes on the charming Tarek, and Alysha Deslorieux is the firm and guarded Zainab. Jacqueline Antaramian rounds out the central cast as Mouna, Tarek\\u2019s concerned mother.\", \"Hyde Pierce delivers the most subdued version of his usual awkward nebbish with the occasional cantankerous quip. (\\u201cWake up, you little snot rags,\\u201d he thinks while teaching his students in an early scene.) But there isn\\u2019t much setup for Walter; perhaps intentionally, given how much the show goes on to focus on its white protagonist.\", \"Part of it is Sullivan\\u2019s brusque direction, which speeds through some character-building dialogue then lingers on scenes that have the clunkiest exposition. And it\\u2019s also partly because of the congested score. While the film is quiet and pensive, the show is overstuffed \\u2014 with seemingly every second of its 90 minutes filled with music.\", \"Kitt\\u2019s music has a generic pop sound that sometimes works, as in \\u201cDrum Circle,\\u201d a Disney-esque tune chock-full of lively, layered percussion; and \\u201cHeart in Your Hands,\\u201d a rather maudlin song with angelic harmonies. (Kitt\\u2019s score, particularly \\u201cHeart,\\u201d is further enlivened by Jessica Paz and Sun Hee Kil\\u2019s ethereal sound design.) But most of the time it doesn\\u2019t work; upbeat songs or soft, slowed-down percussion feel at odds with the heavy subject matter.\", \"This is especially baffling in the energetic \\u201cWorld Between Two Worlds\\u201d number, in which detained immigrants perform a \\u201cStomp\\u201d-style stepping and clapping routine that abruptly ends when a guard takes one of them away. That said, at least the show moves; Lorin Latarro\\u2019s choreography animates even the most mundane scenes, say, in a classroom or on a New York City street. (The ensemble members enter and exit via doorways and a balcony platform in David Zinn\\u2019s confined set design of oppressively gray walls that transform into various spaces and institutions that may exclude individuals \\u2014 an apt metaphor.)\", \"Yorkey\\u2019s clunky lyrics are what ultimately do the songs in; some are attempts to add introspection to a deeply withdrawn protagonist with a wooden disposition. So we\\u2019re treated to obvious lines like, \\u201cHere I am in a suit at this conference,\\u201d or clich\\u00e9s like, \\u201cFind the rhythm within,\\u201d and, \\u201cYou join the [drum] circle and it joins you.\\u201d\", \"Hyde Pierce speak-sings his way through the score, or spastically works himself up into the bravado needed for the nauseatingly cheesy \\u201cBetter Angels,\\u201d which is meant to be a triumphant showstopper. As Tarek, Maksoud gives an earnest performance but never seems to plumb any emotional depths \\u2014 or vocal ones either. Deslorieux has the strongest voice of the main cast, crooning with delicate rolling r\\u2019s for her character\\u2019s accent. As Mouna, Antaramian\\u2019s voice is inconsistent, and she has a loose grasp on her character\\u2019s accent.\", \"The ensemble, however, often upstages the main cast members, etching small but remarkable performance moments, even in the background and during the fleeting transitional numbers.\", \"In one, Katie Terza nearly blows off the walls of the Public with a brief yet transcendent Arabic song, and the professional drummer Takafumi Nikaido (also the production\\u2019s djembe coach) could easily steal the entire production.\", \"The few attempts at nuance \\u2014 a comment from Walter showing how he\\u2019s also guilty of racial stereotypes, a mention of him as a white savior, and an added back story about Zainab\\u2019s abuse-ridden immigration journey \\u2014 cannot change the story that\\u2019s being told or how uncomfortably it sits in our current moment. Even with the additions, the immigrant characters still ultimately function as markers of Walter\\u2019s emotional growth and development; they have bits of personality and back stories but can\\u2019t stand on their own in a plot without him.\", \"So what does one do with a work of art that, by the time of its premiere, has already been outpaced by the moment? How can you contemporize a work whose very conceit \\u2014 its whole plot, its central perspective \\u2014 will land like a well-meaning but ignorant cousin\\u2019s comment in a conscientious cultural conversation?\", \"These questions, of course, are larger than what the Public has on its stage right now. \\u201cThe Visitor\\u201d proves that we can\\u2019t always pick up exactly where we left off. Sometimes that\\u2019s a good thing.\"]","href_hash":"b771f23c3dd611ec830c000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b771f23c3dd611ec830c000017025a03"}},
