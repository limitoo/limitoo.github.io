In exchange, the unions have agreed to drop their legal efforts to overturn the new policy, the city announced Thursday.\", \"The nine unions collectively represent about 88,000 of the 160,000 employees covered by the latest mandate, which requires all city employees to get vaccinated for the coronavirus with no option to take a weekly test. The unions include District Council 37, Teamsters Local 237, the Uniformed Sanitationmen\\u2019s Association Local 831, and SEIU Local 300.\", \"\\u201cWe have reached an agreement that gives our members options,\\u201d said Henry Garrido, the executive director of District Council 37, the largest public employees union.\", \"\\u201cThank you to these unions for working with us to keep New Yorkers safe,\\u201d Mr. de Blasio said.\", \"Since going into effect on Nov. 1, the city\\u2019s mandate has driven the vaccination rate among the city\\u2019s 370,000 workers up to 92 percent. About 9,000 employees have been placed on unpaid leave for refusing vaccination. An additional 12,000 unvaccinated employees are being permitted to work with weekly testing while they await a decision on a religious or medical exemption.\", \"The city has been trying to reach agreements with 42 unions, but most of them have not hammered out a deal with City Hall. Those include the police and fire unions, which have pushed back hardest against the mandate.\", \"Under the agreements announced Thursday, union members have agreed to follow many of the same rules set up by an arbitrator to govern how the vaccine mandate is affecting the city\\u2019s teachers. The city\\u2019s vaccine mandate went into effect for about 150,000 education employees in early October.\", \"Among the terms are strict rules that will limit religious exemptions to vaccination for city workers. Requests will only be considered for employees who are members of organized and recognized religions, accompanied by a letter from clergy.\", \"At the city schools, that policy in practice has meant that only members of religions with known opposition to vaccination, such as Christian Science, have qualified for religious exemptions. Only 150 adults who work in the city\\u2019s schools received such exemptions, the Department of Education said Monday.\", \"But the nine unions who reached an agreement on Thursday also won concessions, including an extension of the time employees can apply for religious exemptions until Friday, and the right to work with pay while their cases are being decided. Previously, the deadline had been Oct. 27.\", \"Unvaccinated union members also won the right to keep their health benefits while on unpaid leave until the end of June 2022. After that, they will be terminated. This is a slightly shorter timeline than teachers received.\", \"Pregnant women in their third trimester can also take compensatory time or sick leave rather than have to go completely unpaid. And all unvaccinated workers can come back to work at any time before July 1, 2022, if they decide to get a Covid shot.\", \"The other five unions involved in the deal are: the Organization of Staff Analysts, Sanitation Officers Local 444, CWA Local 1180 and the Civil Service Bar Association of the Teamsters.\"]","href_hash":"8c00e0f43dbd11ec8edc000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8c00e0f43dbd11ec8edc000017025a03"}},
