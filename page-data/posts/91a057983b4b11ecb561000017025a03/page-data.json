up.","country":"au","create_time":"2021-11-01T19:40:46.000Z","content":"[\"Australia's infant aquaculture industry has long struggled to draw the kind of love and attention that businesses need to prosper and reach a critical mass.\", \"But after years \\u2014\\u00a0decades even \\u2014\\u00a0of trying, it seems the fledgling sector is finally growing up.\", \"That's the conclusion being drawn following the successful bid by Brazilian meat processing giant JBS to take over a major player in Australia's salmon farming industry, which is the country's most valuable aquaculture export.\", \"On Friday, a whopping 99.8 per cent of shareholders in the ASX-listed Huon Aquaculture voted to approve JBS's $425 million offer for the Tasmanian company.\", \"Among those shareholders was Australia's richest man,\\u00a0Andrew Forrest, who up until the vote had been running his own attempt to take control of the Huon business.\", \"That two corporate heavyweights would battle it out for an Australian salmon farmer says much about the scale Huon has achieved and the commercial opportunities seemingly available in aquaculture.\", \"<img

Tasmania.(ABC News: Paul Strk)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Reeling in a corporate battle</div>\", \"JBS is among the world's biggest meat processors with operations that span the globe.\", \"But while it is the biggest or among the biggest international producers in industries such as beef, chicken and pork, it is a relative novice in the seafood space.\", \"While that might lead some to draw analogies with square pegs and round holes, industry observers note that JBS is less a meat processor than a protein manager.\", \"The company's statement following the shareholder vote confirmed as much.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e73c250d5e302912b141bde1d974a269\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> JBS is better known as one of the world's biggest beef processors.(ABC News: Chris Gillette)</div>\", \"\\\"Consistent with our acquisition track record in Australia, JBS will invest in the Huon business, its people and farming practices to support long-term sustainable growth,\\\" the company's Australian chief, Brent Eastwood, said.\", \"\\\"Acquiring Huon represents our first step into the aquaculture industry for JBS globally.\", \"\\\"We believe that our contacts and our ability to open up and access new markets, combined with the expert team at Huon, create a fantastic opportunity to take this business forward.\", \"\\\"We will uphold the highest standards for superior quality, fish health and sustainable farming practices \\u2014\\u00a0from water management to animal welfare\\u00a0and stock

Australia's biggest aquaculture export.(Supplied: Huon Aquaculture)</div>\", \"Also implicit in Mr Eastwood's remarks was the outsized growth prospects of aquaculture compared with traditional livestock farming and wild-catch fishing.\", \"According to the United Nations, the share of aquaculture in global fish production went from 25.7 per cent in 2000 to 46 per cent in 2018.\", \"What's more, big-four consultancy Deloitte noted in a report that limited agriculture land and a slowdown in the productivity gains of recent years meant conventional farming would struggle to keep pace with demand for protein.\", \"It said improvements in aquaculture would be crucial to ensuring a growing global population could continue to be fed.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Aquaculture is\\u00a0big business</div>\", \"And therein lies the rub.\", \"A company as big and burly as JBS is typically not interested in throwing its money behind marginal or uncertain businesses.\", \"For JBS\\u00a0size and scale is the key, and in Huon\\u00a0the company has obviously identified an enterprise with the maturity it feels is necessary to invest.\", \"Those in the industry believe it also foreshadows a more aggressive push by Huon into the global marketplace as JBS seeks to exploit notions that Tasmanian salmon is clean and green.\", \"They also suggest this foray by JBS is unlikely to be its last in Australian aquaculture.\", \"That means other local aquaculture producers of note, such as South Australia's tuna farmers and WA's barramundi operator, could well be on the menu of JBS or other major protein players.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/6b63c1e49195e04b5962add50f5bd195\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Andrew and Nicola Forrest are aiming to become big fish in the aquaculture industry.(ABC Great Southern: Tom Edwards)</div>\", \"Despite its successful takeover pitch, there are risks in the Huon acquisition for JBS.\", \"For starters, some pundits believe that at $3.85 a share, JBS will end up paying way over the odds for the company.\", \"But perhaps a bigger risk lies in the growing maturity that made Huon such an attractive target in the first place.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Risks lurk beneath the deal</div>\", \"There is a view that as a homegrown commercial success story, Tasmanian salmon producers Huon and Tassal have been able to avoid the kind of scrutiny that generally accompanies intensive industry.\", \"Even after allegations of environmental harm surfaced and the industry was caught in the crosshairs of celebrated author Richard Flanagan, the island state's salmon farmers enjoyed broad support from the Tasmanian government.\", \"Such forbearance could become a thing of the past as Huon changes hands from its local founders \\u2014\\u00a0Frances and Peter Bender \\u2014\\u00a0to its new Brazilian owners.\", \"<img

from the JBS deal.(ABC News: Jane Ryan )</div>\", \"With greater government and regulatory oversight of the industry, there is the real chance JBS could face increased costs in running a business that is compliant with its licence.\", \"Think more severe treatment of any future environmental breaches or stricter enforcement of stocking limits.\", \"In any case, there's growing doubt any more areas will be opened up within Tasmania's waters for further salmon-farming developments.\", \"Which leads to the final and perhaps most significant risk inherent in the JBS deal.\", \"In its quest for size and clout, the industry has come in for greater attention from a public that is increasingly intolerant of environmental or social transgressions by companies.\", \"Now that Huon is all grown up, the scope for missteps could well become particularly narrow.\", \"JBS, a giant in the world of food production, will have to tread carefully.\"]","href_hash":"91a057983b4b11ecb561000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"91a057983b4b11ecb561000017025a03"}},
