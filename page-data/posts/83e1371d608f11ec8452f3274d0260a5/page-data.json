It would have been somewhere 5 a.m.-ish or so.\", \"\\\"He\\\" was 25-year-old David Bogdanov, who worked at his family-owned construction business.

They started talking.\", \"DAVID BOGDANOV: I offered her my jacket 'cause it was really cold outside.\", \"Bogdanov also offered Nikki a drink.\", \"DAVID BOGDANOV: I said do you want some vodka cause I got some if you want to have a drink, just to relax a little bit.
