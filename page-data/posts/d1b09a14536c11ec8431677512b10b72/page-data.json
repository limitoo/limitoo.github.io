Some interviewees, including Kenny G himself, imply that judgments against his work are de facto judgments of the people who love it. That\\u2019s a specious conclusion, one which the movie could have unpacked better.\", \"But \\u201cListening\\u201d is very good at doing other things. As a music industry story, Kenny G\\u2019s rise, engineered by the mogul Clive Davis but at times bucked by the artist himself, is fascinating. The analysis of the link between what makes Kenny G a star and what makes him annoying is spot-on \\u2014 particularly in its treatment of his relationship to jazz. Celebrated artists in that genre like John Coltrane, Miles Davis and Thelonious Monk weren\\u2019t merely inspired players; they were bandleaders whose musical conceptions stressed instrumental interplay. With Kenny G, his sax is the thing.\", \"The sax man\\u2019s song \\u201cGoing Home\\u201d is supernaturally popular in China, where it has been adopted as a closing-time anthem. In the documentary, the critic Ben Ratliff, noting this, wryly wonders whether Kenny G\\u2019s music is \\u201ca weapon of consent.\\u201d The movie also gives a funny account of the composer-guitarist Pat Metheny\\u2019s enraged accusations of \\u201cmusical necrophilia\\u201d after Kenny G essayed a virtual duet with Louis Armstrong.\", \"The saxophonist, often displaying that mix of self-satisfaction and defensiveness which marks artists who\\u2019ve received fame and derision in equal measure, remains undaunted. His next album, he announces, will feature another virtual duet, this time with a jazz giant who was distinctively divisive in his own time, Stan Getz.\"]","href_hash":"d1b09a14536c11ec8431677512b10b72"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d1b09a14536c11ec8431677512b10b72"}},
