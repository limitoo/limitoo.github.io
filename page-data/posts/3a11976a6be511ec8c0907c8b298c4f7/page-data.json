I\\u2019m not a data scientist but I know a little bit. This is the season of pledges and hope, of new lifestyle choices, crossed hearts and pinky swears: less animal protein on the plate this year; more vegetables and whole grains; regular exercise; Dryuary; the whole healthy shebang. I\\u2019d no more recommend fried chicken for dinner tonight as suggest you pair it with Mountain Dew and a Marlboro for dessert. It\\u2019s been nearly two years of video meetings, but I can still read a room.\", \"Nope, it\\u2019s winter vegetable curry on the docket tonight, to pair with steamed basmati rice and maybe a spoonful of yogurt. You might bring in Meera Sodha\\u2019s recipe for naan as well. That\\u2019s a fantastic dinner.\", \"On Monday, how about this beet and lentil salad with Cheddar? It\\u2019s a surprising and remarkably flavorful combination, and a hearty meal besides.\", \"Then, for Tuesday, see what you make of this hippie-cat tofu with mixed grains. \\u201cWith only a few steps and five main ingredients,\\u201d Samin Nosrat wrote when she brought us the recipe, \\u201cthe dish barely requires a recipe, but the relish with which I eat it, the way I look forward to and relax into that steamy bowl, make me feel a way only a handful of dishes have over the course of my life.\\u201d\", \"Wednesday might be good for fish \\u2014 either steamed or baked \\u2014 with aioli or some kind of vinaigrette. (Lately, for me, that\\u2019s been browned butter and sherry vinegar, but olive oil, tarragon and white wine vinegar would work as well.)\", \"On Thursday, I\\u2019m thinking, you could make pasta with lemon, herbs and ricotta salata (above).\", \"And then on Friday, to round out the week, consider these salmon burgers. Kick if you like, but it\\u2019s good to spread some mayonnaise on the exterior of the patties before cooking, to encourage browning and an excellent crust. Serve with sweet potato fries, naturally!\", \"There are thousands and thousands more recipes to cook this week on New York Times Cooking. Yes, you need a subscription to access them, just as you need a subscription to Acorn to watch \\u201cDeadwater Fell.\\u201d Subscriptions support our work and allow it to continue. Thank you for yours. (If you haven\\u2019t yet done so, I hope you will you consider subscribing today.)\", \"And please reach out for assistance if something goes sideways in your kitchen or with our technology. We\\u2019re at cookingcare@nytimes.com. Someone will get back to you. (If not, tell me about it. Or tell me about something else: foodeditor@nytimes.com. I read every letter sent.)\", \"Now, it\\u2019s nothing to do with tabbouleh or jugged hare, but Mary Wellesley, in the London Review of Books, got me exploring \\u201cDurer\\u2019s Journeys: Travels of a Renaissance Artist,\\u201d at the National Gallery in London.\", \"Peter Kaminsky sent me this Facebook video about the preparation of paella at a restaurant in Granada, Spain, and now like Liz Lemon I want to go to there.\", \"There\\u2019s new fiction from Jennifer Egan in The New Yorker, \\u201cWhat the Forest Remembers.\\u201d Click!\", \"Finally, let\\u2019s enter the wayback machine and listen to some \\u201970s Zambian rock and roll: WITCH, \\u201cIntroduction.\\u201d That\\u2019ll get you through this week and happily.
