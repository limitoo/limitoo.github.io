National will repeal each of these tax increases implemented by Labour.\\\"\", \"He also said National would repeal the regional fuel tax, the extension to the bright-line test and the removal of interest deductibility for landlords.\", \"Adjusting the tax brackets makes sense. They're subject to what's called \\\"bracket creep\\\" as wages and inflation increase, putting more and more people into higher brackets and therefore paying more tax.\", \"The promise to repeal all the taxes introduced by Labour since 2017 is the really big one, and revealing it so far ahead of an election means there's lots of time for it to be picked apart.\", \"As it happened, that didn't take long. \\\"Luxon wriggles around answering whether National will remove highest tax rate\\\" was Newshub's headline on Wednesday after an interview with him.\", \"Labour introduced the 39 percent bracket on income over $180,000 in 2020.\", \"\\\"Asked directly whether he would remove it, Luxon wouldn't give a straight answer,\\\" the report said.\", \"\\\"The tax cuts would be in the context of a fully fiscally costed plan that we will go to the election with,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"What we are saying is in principle we are going to remove the tax increases Labour has put in place.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/217157/eight_col_191205_PETROL-PUMPS-2.jpg?1575507744\\\" alt=\\\"No caption\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nLuxon said National would repeal the regional fuel tax. \\nPhoto: RNZ / Dan Cook\\n</div>\", \"Luxon may be wary about removing the top tax bracket because if he did Labour would almost certainly resurrect the ancient \\\"National is looking after its rich mates\\\" mantra.
