They were married May 6, 2020, in Anaheim, Calf., at a Honda car center, where a makeshift marriage station had been set up. \\u201cIt was Covid, everything was shut down,\\u201d Ms. Eagan said. \\u201cWe walked to a kiosk and this clerk of the court married us. My sister was our witness. It was very bare bones. The Cheesecake Factory was our wedding meal, which we got to go because only their drive-through was open.\\u201d\", \"A Zoom celebration followed on May 24 with 30 friends and family who watched remotely. \\u201cWe exchanged vows we had written,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThat was very special.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Eagan met Mr. Bloom in 2008, while both were studying writing at Antioch University in Los Angeles. She was 29 and he was 40. \\u201cI did a reading of his play for his final,\\u201d Ms. Eagan said. \\u201cWe were outside smoking and he complimented my acting. Then he walked away. He was giving me validation, which I needed, and he was funny.\\u201d Mr. Bloom was unaware Ms. Eagan had won a Tony in 1991 for best performance by a featured actress in a musical for \\u201cThe Secret Garden.\\u201d\", \"Soon after, they found themselves in several of the same classes. This led to study dates, which led to a relationship. In 2010, they moved in together; two years later they broke up. \\u201cWe were very unhappy,\\u201d Ms. Eagan said. \\u201cAll we did was smoke cigarettes, drink and watch TV.\\u201d\", \"A few weeks later she found out she was 10 and a half weeks pregnant. \\u201cI was staying in a hotel and we met to talk about what to do,\\u201d she said. \\u201cKurt said, \\u2018I want to have this baby with you.\\u2019 That was the moment I realized I wanted to as well.\\u201d\", \"They got back together. Monty was born in May 2013. Things did not improve. \\u201cWe thought a baby would fix us. It didn\\u2019t,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe were scared and not ready to work on us. In 2015 they called it quits again. In 2017, Ms. Eagan went on tour for over a year with both \\u201cThe Secret Garden\\u201d and \\u201cThe Humans.\\u201d Mr. Bloom took Monty to Seattle so he could care for his terminally ill father.\", \"When Ms. Eagan returned from touring and relocated to Brooklyn, Monty came with her. So did Mr. Bloom. \\u201cBecause we couldn\\u2019t afford separate places, Kurt moved in with us.\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe lived in Monty\\u2019s room. They had bunk beds, I had my own room. We were co-parenting and roommates. It was awkward, but it also felt normal.\\u201d\", \"They got back together in December 2018 when Ms. Eagan returned from touring. \\u201cOnce we were physical, feelings and emotions came back \\u2014 I realized I loved this person,\\u201d she said. By July 2019, the threesome returned to Los Angeles; Monty had his own room, the couple had theirs. After Covid hit, Mr. Bloom was furloughed and lost his health insurance. Ms. Eagan had hers thanks to SAG-AFTRA. She proposed in April 2020 while the couple were having dinner in their apartment.\", \"[Sign up for Love Letter and always get the latest in Modern Love, weddings, and relationships in the news by email.]\", \"Ms. Eagan We have a traditional untraditional marriage. I\\u2019m in a straight relationship to the outside world, but because I came out in my late 30s as queer, I didn\\u2019t get a chance to explore that as much as I would have liked. I identify as she/they and we have an open relationship. I don\\u2019t know if I would act on it, but knowing the door is unlocked is a comfort. It helps me in my queer identity. I might like Kurt to have a companion. That doesn\\u2019t worry me. There\\u2019s a level of respect and acceptance that comes with understanding your partner\\u2019s sexuality.\", \"Being married does feel more permanent. Love is a commitment and a decision you make everyday. It\\u2019s an agreement to work as hard as you can together. Marriage means I\\u2019m there for Kurt in a supportive, financial, emotional, parenting, friendship and companionship way. And he\\u2019s there for me. We are equal partners, which seems rare. I hope to have that for the rest of our lives.\", \"I love him very much. He\\u2019s the person I want to be with. He\\u2019s supportive, funny and smart. He\\u2019s a wonderful parent and partner. He makes me laugh in a way no one else does. He\\u2019s the constant, the calm in the storm. I respect him. I love watching him parent. He kisses me goodbye every morning and I think about him all day. He comes home from work and I\\u2019m excited to see him. He\\u2019s my favorite person.\", \"I\\u2019ve learned I spent a lot of my life settling. I didn\\u2019t know who I was for a long time. Part of the evolution of this relationship is that I\\u2019ve come to understand who I am. Kurt loves me completely, not a future version or a theoretical one, but me. I never feel I have to compromise any of myself to make him happy or comfortable. That\\u2019s a gift. He\\u2019s taught me to love and respect myself in a way I haven\\u2019t before.\", \"Kurt got sober seven years ago for Monty. But that\\u2019s a product of me having boundaries. He\\u2019s learned to tap into an emotional place that he was covering up. Now he\\u2019s a connected, reactive, responsible partner. It\\u2019s allowed me to feel I have a present partner.\", \"There was a time when I couldn\\u2019t see the positive in him. All I saw were things I decided were flaws. From the beginning of our relationship we were two separate people living together. I didn\\u2019t know him or myself. I\\u2019ve learned to appreciate him, and what we have created. Life is hard but it\\u2019s easier to live in because we have created our own little universe.\", \"Mr. Bloom I identify as he/him. I\\u2019m comfortable with Daisy identifying however she\\u2019s comfortable. Her identity has evolved as she\\u2019s evolved. As someone who loves someone you learn to listen, accept, understand and evolve with them.\", \"We don\\u2019t have a traditional view of marriage; we just have marriage. Having a successful, open relationship means our communication has to be open and honest all the time. Having that, I don\\u2019t mind Daisy being with someone else. I don\\u2019t feel abandoned or left alone because she still wants to be with me, and how lucky is that? I\\u2019ve been lucky since the day I met her. I have a son with her and co-parent with her, and no one else has that, with her.\", \"In this marriage, I\\u2019ve learned we are family. I\\u2019m an integral part of a team of three. We rely on each other for laughter, food and entertainment. We spent a year and a half of plague together, which we survived intact, stronger and more in love with each other than we were before.\", \"It took me a long time to get here. I was always told where my place was; here I found my role in this family, in my partnership and as a parent. There\\u2019s a sense of relief, of not being judged or ridiculed. I\\u2019m appreciated, loved and heard. I feel seen. I give that to Daisy. She lets herself be seen and I see her. That\\u2019s why this works.\", \"I bring practicality and pragmatism. I bring safety and the ability for people to express themselves. I\\u2019ve taught Daisy that she doesn\\u2019t have to do everything, to let me help, and to be open to that help while assuring her she doesn\\u2019t have to carry everything.\", \"When I got sober, I got on a path to recovering who I was. Growing up, I wasn\\u2019t given the tools to get what I wanted and needed. I\\u2019m accumulating more tools now. I\\u2019ve learned how to communicate, to be patient and more sensitive. To be present minded. I\\u2019ve learned to be less hard on myself. There is room for mistakes; I\\u2019ve learned to learn from them.\", \"The way we designed our marriage would not work for many people, but I can\\u2019t imagine anything more wonderful than what we have. It seems simple in words but this takes practice. I wouldn\\u2019t change a thing.\"]","href_hash":"45628dd546c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"45628dd546c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
