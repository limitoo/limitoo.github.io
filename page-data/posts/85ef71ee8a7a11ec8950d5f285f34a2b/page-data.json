The war games \\u2014 which Moscow has said will last for 10 days, after which the Russian forces will leave Belarus and return to Russia \\u2014 have prompted the U.S. and NATO to bolster their forces in the region and carry out their own military drills. \", \"The tens of thousands of troops and weapons that Russia has sent into Belarus for the exercises are just one element of Russia's months-long military buildup around Ukraine's borders. The U.S. government says President Vladimir Putin now has more than 100,000 troops positioned around Ukraine's southern, eastern and northern borders, and that he could decide to order a new invasion of the neighboring country any time.\", \"Russia insists it has no plans to attack Ukraine, but an intensive diplomacy effort by the U.S. and its NATO partners with Moscow this week has failed to yield any signs of deescalation. \", \"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg warned on Thursday that it was \\\"a dangerous moment for European security,\\\" saying that as the \\\"number of Russian forces is going up, the warning time for a possible attack is going down.\\\"\", \"Stoltenberg spoke on Thursday with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, and the State Department said they had \\\"discussed diplomatic efforts to urge Russia to de-escalate and engage in meaningful and reciprocal dialogue, as well as United States and Allies' force posture adjustments to fortify the Alliance's Eastern Flank.\\\"\", \"CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tyab was on the Ukrainian side of a border crossing with Belarus on Thursday, just a few dozen miles from where the Russian forces and their allies are holding the military drills \\u2014 the largest in the country since the Cold War.\", \"Welcomed @BorisJohnson & thanked him for #UK key contributions to #NATO, including reinforcement of our Eastern flank.

I don't know what our Anglo-Saxon colleagues are plotting.\\\"\", \"\\\"We do not want to threaten anyone,\\\" Lavrov said. \\\"Take a look at the public statements: no threats have ever been made. It's we who are being threatened.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"U.S. and European officials continue to say they're unsure whether Putin has decided to launch an invasion, or any other level of attack, against Ukraine. But Russia did invade its neighbor eight years ago, annexing Crimea and sparking a simmering conflict in the east of Ukraine between the country's forces and Russian-backed separatists that continues today, and that Kyiv says has left more than 14,000 people dead.\", \"After her meeting with Lavrov, Britain's top diplomat Truss said the Russian had repeated his insistence that Moscow has no plans to invade Ukraine, but she said, \\\"We need to see those words followed up by actions, and we need to see the troops and the equipment that is stationed on the Ukraine border moved elsewhere, because at present it is in a very threatening posture.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Lavrov dismissed his meeting with the British diplomat as pointless, likening it to \\\"a conversation between the mute and the deaf \\u2014 when [a person] seems to be listening, but they do not hear.\\\" \", \"Despite the apparent failure of politicians to find ant common ground to ease the tension, not all Americans in the country are ready to leave yet, however.\", \"Brian Best has lived in Ukraine's capital of Kyiv for more than two decades.
