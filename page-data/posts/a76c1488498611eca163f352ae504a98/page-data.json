When mounds of maduros (fried sweet plantains) arrive with our entrees, each is topped with a tiny Puerto Rican flag. De Jes\\u00fas, 37, approves.\", \"The actor\\u2019s family is from rural Puerto Rico, and he grew up in a working-class community in Norwalk, Conn. Known for larger-than-life roles like a gay teenager who dabbles in drag in the movie \\u201cCamp,\\u201d a spirited maid in the Broadway revival of \\u201cLa Cage aux Folles\\u201d and a boisterous interior decorator in both the play and film versions of \\u201cThe Boys in the Band,\\u201d he wanted to diversify his work.\", \"Then along came \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!.\\u201d De Jes\\u00fas was deeply intentional in auditioning for the role of Michael, an actor turned advertiser, in the film, directed by Lin-Manuel Miranda.\", \"\\u201cWhat kept coming up for me was, \\u2018I want a quiet performance.\\u2019 I want a quiet, subtle, nuance,\\u201d de Jes\\u00fas said at lunch. \\u201cAnd I know that, if I do that, I can showcase maturity.\\u201d\", \"The movie (in theaters and on Netflix) is an adaptation of a musical about the writing of a musical. The original \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!\\u201d was written by Jonathan Larson \\u2014 who would later go on to write the rock musical \\u201cRent\\u201d \\u2014 and first performed in 1990. The film tells the tale of an aspiring composer (also named Jonathan and played by Andrew Garfield) pouring himself into yet another musical, this one called \\u201cSuperbia.\\u201d It takes place in the early \\u201990s, against the stark backdrop of the AIDS epidemic.\", \"As his 30th birthday looms, Jonathan\\u2019s anxiety manifests as a persistent ticking. He worries about the upcoming workshop of \\u201cSuperbia,\\u201d upon which everything seemingly hinges \\u2014 and about whether he can succeed in the performing arts at all.\", \"Michael, his former roommate and best friend since childhood, has tapped out of the threadbare artist lifestyle, opting instead for a plush career in advertising and a glittering high-rise apartment. He was tired of waiting for hours in line for an audition, just to be cut off after six measures of a song and called the wrong name: \\u201cJuan, Pedro, Carlos, lo que sea.\\u201d\", \"That\\u2019s not to say that Michael has hardened into a formal shell; he stays playful and supportive of Jonathan\\u2019s dreams. We first meet him visiting Jonathan at work in the Moondance Diner, where he drops off copies he made of the \\u201cSuperbia\\u201d script.\", \"\\u201cBoo-boo, you need to ask yourself,\\u201d Michael tells Jonathan, \\u201cIn this moment, are you letting yourself be led by fear? Or love?\\u201d\", \"De Jes\\u00fas said, \\u201cI knew that Michael did not have to be pulled and buttoned up, that he was someone who navigated being an artist, a creative, someone who was down and hip, and cool with also doing advertising.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt didn\\u2019t have to just be one thing,\\u201d he continued.\", \"Although de Jes\\u00fas has appeared in many major movies, he assumed some other, bigger film star might snag the role of Michael. So he took a risk in his audition. Miranda was impressed.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve seen a lot of productions of \\u2018Tick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!\\u2019 and a lot of the time the guy that gets cast as Michael is someone who looks very at home being a business guy, very dapper, very smooth,\\u201d Miranda said in a phone call. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s fun about Robin as a choice is that you 100 percent believe this is an artist who thrives in this world. It\\u2019s an artist with a business suit on.\\u201d\", \"Miranda and de Jes\\u00fas go way back. (So far, in fact, that de Jes\\u00fas sang at Miranda\\u2019s wedding.) In 2005, de Jes\\u00fas made his Broadway debut in \\u201cRent\\u201d as a member of the ensemble and an understudy for Angel, a young drag queen. That same year, he joined the original cast of \\u201cIn the Heights,\\u201d Miranda\\u2019s first musical, with a book by Quiara Alegr\\u00eda Hudes.\", \"\\u201cQuiara and I realized every time he had the ball, he just put a crazy spin on it and knocked it out of the park,\\u201d Miranda said of de Jes\\u00fas. \\u201cI am mixing my tennis and baseball metaphors, but so would Robin.\\u201d\", \"De Jes\\u00fas earned a Tony nomination for his role as Sonny in \\u201cIn the Heights.\\u201d He received subsequent nominations for \\u201cLa Cage aux Folles\\u201d in 2010 and \\u201cThe Boys in the Band\\u201d in 2019. This year, he presented at the Tony Awards with Andrew Garfield.\", \"But so many of his roles came across as youthful or outsize. De Jes\\u00fas was ready for something fresh.\", \"\\u201cMy other characters are like two-liter soda bottles that you shake up and you open,\\u201d he said. \\u201cMichael, you shake, but you leave closed. And I don\\u2019t get to play that often. I\\u2019ve always known I\\u2019m capable of it.\\u201d\", \"He was just waiting for someone to give him the opportunity \\u2014 like many Black and brown artists, he points out.\", \"\\u201cThe fact that I\\u2019ve been in New York since 2002, and my first month in New York, I repeatedly heard, \\u2018It\\u2019s a good time to be a person of color in theater,\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd here we are 20 years later.\\u201d\", \"And yet, to be Black and brown in New York\\u2019s arts and entertainment industry is a thing of beauty, he said, in \\u201cthe way we\\u2019ve created our own cultures, and the way we uplift and promote joy for one another.\\u201d\", \"De Jes\\u00fas\\u2019s best friend, his \\u201cnonsexual lifetime partner,\\u201d Dominic Col\\u00f3n, is part of that group of artists, too. Both men are gay and queer Latinos who live in the Bronx, so close they can see each others apartments (intentionally). After \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!,\\u201d de Jes\\u00fas hopes to act in Col\\u00f3n\\u2019s play, \\u201cThe War I Know,\\u201d a working-class, Puerto Rican story that mirrors their own.\", \"\\u201cI think he is a teacher,\\u201d Col\\u00f3n said. \\u201cI think he is a valuable lesson for artists of any age to trust in the journey. And it may not look exactly how you thought it was going to look when you were 18, but it works out in the way that it needs to, and it will continue to.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a76c1488498611eca163f352ae504a98"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a76c1488498611eca163f352ae504a98"}},
