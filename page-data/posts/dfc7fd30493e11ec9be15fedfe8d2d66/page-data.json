Fearful that waning protection and the onset of winter will set off a wave of breakthrough infections, a growing number of governors had already offered boosters to everyone 18 and older ahead of the holidays.\", \"Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the federal government\\u2019s top infectious disease expert, has argued relentlessly over the past month for booster shots for all adults, a position shared by most of Mr. Biden\\u2019s other health advisers. Dr. Fauci has said that a dip in antibody levels in fully vaccinated people was a clear sign that booster shots were needed. Public health experts who argue that healthy younger adults do not need them, he has said, are ignoring the risks of symptomatic Covid-19.\", \"\\u201cEnough is enough. Let\\u2019s get moving on here,\\u201d he said at an event Wednesday night. \\u201cWe know what the data are.\\u201d\", \"If the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention agrees, all adults who received a second shot of either Pfizer or Moderna at least six months ago will likely be eligible for a booster shot by the weekend. A meeting of the agency\\u2019s outside advisers is scheduled for Friday.\", \"At a White House briefing on Wednesday, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the C.D.C. director, promised that the agency would \\u201cquickly review the safety and effectiveness data and make recommendations as soon as we hear from F.D.A.\\u201d\", \"The F.D.A.\\u2019s action came after months of fierce debate within the administration and the scientific community about who needed booster shots, and when. Some outside advisers to the F.D.A. and C.D.C. repeatedly expressed discomfort with how quickly the administration was moving to offer the shots. Critics said the administration\\u2019s booster campaign was motivated by practical or political reasons more than scientific ones, and that federal regulators were analyzing safety and efficacy data on the fly.\", \"\\u201cThe evidence isn\\u2019t there that a large rollout of boosters is really going to have that much impact on the epidemic,\\u201d said Ira M. Longini Jr., a vaccine expert and professor of biostatistics at the University of Florida. He said that booster doses could increase someone\\u2019s protection at least temporarily, but would do little to halt transmission of the virus, which is being driven by the unvaccinated. For a jittery public, he said, booster shots might feel like a quick and easy way to hold the virus at bay. But he repeated the administration\\u2019s own oft-stated position that convincing the unvaccinated to get the shots must remain the top priority.\", \"Other public health experts have argued that the government needed to offer boosters to all adults to eliminate confusion. Complex eligibility rules coupled with the government\\u2019s recent decision to let people choose among all three vaccines for their booster has left the public somewhat befuddled, they say. \", \"\\u201cThis decision by F.D.A. is overdue,\\u201d said Dr. Elizabeth McNally, director of the Center for Genetic Medicine at Northwestern University\\u2019s Feinberg School of Medicine.\", \"\\u201cMany people had trouble understanding whether they should or shouldn\\u2019t get boosters,\\u201d she said in a statement. \\u201cThis message is much clearer \\u2014 get a booster!\\u201d\", \"Until now, those eligible for boosters included people 65 and older, residents of long-term care facilities, people with underlying medical conditions, and those whose jobs or institutional living conditions heightened their risk.\", \"All recipients of Johnson & Johnson\\u2019s one-shot vaccine have already been cleared to get a booster shot at least two months after their injection.\", \"Jason L. Schwartz, an associate professor of health policy at the Yale School of Public Health, said the latest authorizations were \\u201ca recognition that the current approach to booster recommendations just isn\\u2019t working.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s so confusing that I think the public has sort of shrugged at the importance of boosters,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd the groups for whom it\\u2019s really important to get boosters \\u2014 the older individuals, the long-term care residents, folks with medical conditions \\u2014 aren\\u2019t getting boosters at the rates they should. It\\u2019s time for a reset.\\u201d\", \"The booster rollout is expanding even as public health experts continue to argue over whether young, healthy adults need added protection. The argument is stronger for recipients of Pfizer\\u2019s vaccine than for recipients of Moderna\\u2019s, which has proved significantly more potent.\", \"While some studies have found that the Pfizer vaccine\\u2019s effectiveness against infection and hospitalization drops about four months after the second dose, Moderna\\u2019s effectiveness has remained steadier. \", \"At the same time, regulators have been concerned by data from Nordic countries and elsewhere suggesting that young male Moderna recipients may face heightened risks of myocarditis, or inflammation of the heart muscle \\u2014 a side effect has also been tied to the Pfizer vaccine. Scientists have said the absolute risk still remains very small, most cases are mild and resolve quickly and that Covid-19 can also trigger myocarditis.\", \"Concerns about myocarditis are behind the F.D.A.\\u2019s decision to wait to authorize the vaccine for adolescents.\", \"At the heart of the booster debate is the question of what vaccines are supposed to do. Critics of the administration\\u2019s policy argue that despite some degree of waning protection, the vaccines are still fulfilling their mission of protecting against severe disease and hospitalization.\", \"Booster advocates like Dr. Fauci counter that the vaccines should also protect against symptomatic disease, especially since some patients avoid hospitalization but suffer long-term consequences.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know of any other vaccine that we only worry about keeping people out of the hospitals,\\u201d Dr. Fauci said at a White House briefing Wednesday. \\u201cI think an important thing is to prevent people from getting symptomatic disease,\\u201d including younger people.\", \"In recent weeks, state after state has moved to allow booster shots for all adults, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Vermont, Arkansas, California, Colorado and New Mexico.\", \"A host of other countries have taken the same approach, including Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Norway and Saudi Arabia. Regulators for the European Union have authorized booster doses of both Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech for all adults.\"]","href_hash":"dfc7fd30493e11ec9be15fedfe8d2d66"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dfc7fd30493e11ec9be15fedfe8d2d66"}},
