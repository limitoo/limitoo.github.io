But the details of the case and publicly available information suggest it is Brian A. Benjamin, a Democrat who ran unsuccessfully for comptroller and is now New York\\u2019s lieutenant governor. \", \"The indictment does not indicate that the candidate knew of the scheme.\", \"Mr. Migdol, 71, was arrested early Friday on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, officials said. He was expected to be arraigned later in the day in Federal District Court in Manhattan. \", \"\\u201cFree and fair elections are the foundation of our democracy, and campaign finance regulations are one way communities seek to ensure everyone plays by the same rules,\\u201d Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement. \", \"A man who answered the phone at Mr. Migdol\\u2019s family-run real estate company, the Migdol Organization, declined to comment. The company, which is based in Harlem, owns and operates residential properties across New York City.\", \"In a statement, a spokesman for Mr. Benjamin\\u2019s comptroller campaign said that \\u201cneither Lieutenant Governor Benjamin nor his campaign are being accused of any wrongdoing and they are prepared to fully cooperate with authorities.\\u201d\", \"The spokesman added that \\u201cas soon as the campaign discovered that these contributions were improperly sourced, they donated them to the campaign finance board.\\u201d\", \"The office of Gov. Kathy Hochul, who chose Mr. Benjamin as lieutenant governor in August after she succeeded Andrew M. Cuomo, referred all questions to his campaign. \", \"Mr. Migdol\\u2019s family has long supported Democratic candidates, according to the Migdol Organization website, which includes photos of family members with Mr. Benjamin and other politicians. \", \"Several Migdol family members, including Gerald Migdol, contributed to Mr. Benjamin\\u2019s campaign under their own names, campaign finance records show.\", \"The contributions at issue in the case against Mr. Migdol, the indictment says, were meant to allow the candidate\\u2019s campaign to qualify for public-matching funds through the city\\u2019s campaign finance system, potentially unlocking tens of thousands of dollars in additional money. The scheme ran from November 2019 to January 2021, the indictment says.\", \"Mr. Benjamin, a former state senator from Harlem, placed fourth in the Democratic primary for comptroller, well behind the winner, Brad Lander, a City Council member from Brooklyn.\", \"Many of the details in the indictment were first reported in January by the news website The City, including that several people whose names were listed on donations to Mr. Benjamin\\u2019s campaign said they had not made the payments. Mr. Benjamin\\u2019s campaign said at the time that it would return the contributions.\", \"\"]","href_hash":"20b49912496b11ecac51b91e9da3775c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"20b49912496b11ecac51b91e9da3775c"}},
