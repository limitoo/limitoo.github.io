For every floral classic like Laura Kinsale\\u2019s \\u201cFor My Lady\\u2019s Heart,\\u201d you can find a clear-as-a-mountain-stream western like Beverly Jenkins\\u2019s \\u201cTopaz\\u201d or a sharp, sardonic contemporary like \\u201cBoyfriend Material,\\u201d by Alexis Hall. Despite its reputation for euphemism and overwrought metaphor, the genre is filled with writing that gets right to the point and stays out of the reader\\u2019s way.\", \"Few writers do this as effectively as Jackie Lau, whose trope-forward contemporaries are as sugary and irresistible as the desserts her characters create. She hooked me with the joyous \\u201cGrumpy Fake Boyfriend,\\u201d and I\\u2019ve been a fan ever since. Her sentences seem transparent, but the more you read, the more they filter the light until you glimpse something delicately shaded and beautiful.\", \"DONUT FALL IN LOVE (Berkley, 368 pp., paper, $16) is classic Lau, a gently funny Toronto-set romance about a movie star with famous abs and the doughnut shop owner giving him lessons before his appearance on the show \\u201cBaking Fail.\\u201d This is the trope-y glaze over a base of grief and vulnerability: Ryan and Lindsay, who have both lost parents relatively young, are struggling with the ways loss has etched their emotional landscapes.\", \"The book is a perfect example of how realistic personal stakes \\u2014 say, your disappointed dad starting a dry but hilarious Twitter account to roast you in public \\u2014 can feel world-shiftingly large in the right hands.\", \"There are roughly two kinds of anthologies \\u2014 one, a collection of stories as different as possible, and two, a matched set that aims for cohesion and unity. Contrasting or complementary flavors, you might say. AMOR ACTUALLY (Adriana Herrera, Kindle, $4.99) is definitely the latter, a multiauthor Latinx holiday story cycle riffing on the various plotlines of \\u201cLove Actually.\\u201d Holiday romances are one of the whitest subgenres around, so an anthology that organically celebrates the rich traditions of people of color stands out as a welcome expansion.\", \"The seven authors might be aiming for matching registers of theme and mood \\u2014 new beginnings, holiday joy and following your desires loom large throughout \\u2014 but the breadth of ages and sexualities and pairings shows this volume has its arms thrown wide open in welcome. It\\u2019s almost too cozy and delectable for words, which is to say it\\u2019s perfect mood reading for a stressful holiday season. I recommend parceling chapters out between baking, cleaning, decorating and awkward time with relatives.\", \"Particular standouts for me are Mia Sosa\\u2019s grumpy head chef turned sexy Santa, Diana Mu\\u00f1oz Stewart\\u2019s witty, wary, divorced librarian heroine and Zoey Castile\\u2019s glorious bilingual gem, \\u201cRomance in Spanglish.\\u201d\", \"The stories felt a little light to me at first, but the more I read, the more I liked them. As with Jackie Lau\\u2019s book \\u2014 as with any ritual or tradition, from holiday dinners to the words I love you \\u2014 accumulation is a sort of alchemy, as individual moments pile up to create something more meaningful than any individual part. Seeing all the couples come together for Nochebuena at the end was cathartic in a way few epilogues can achieve.\", \"For more literal alchemy, this year has also seen a big surge in supernatural and magical books, expanding the offerings in paranormal romance. Instead of alpha vampires or brooding werewolf packs, though, we\\u2019re seeing a rise in covens and spellbooks and sorcerers. This includes Austenesque fantasies like Stephanie Burgis\\u2019s \\u201cScales and Sensibility,\\u201d where tiny dragons are a debutante\\u2019s newest accessory, and a slew of small towns full of secret spellcasting families.\", \"Lana Harper\\u2019s PAYBACK\\u2019S A WITCH (Berkley, 352 pp., paper, $16) is the sexy Sapphic modern Gothic I didn\\u2019t know I needed. It\\u2019s a return-to-your-hometown story with a witchy twist, starring a bisexual heroine, Emmy, who\\u2019s done her level best to leave her ex and her Midwestern magical heritage behind. But family obligations have called her back to be the arbiter for this year\\u2019s all-important magic competition, where her best friend, Linden, and a dangerously sexy ghost-befriending witch named Talia have also been hurt by Emmy\\u2019s ex \\u2014 and want to make him suffer for it.\", \"What makes this a Gothic as well as a paranormal is its sense of gorgeous unreality. Gothics have something luxurious or decadent about them. And \\u201cPayback\\u2019s a Witch\\u201d is filled with sublime turns of phrase: the way the moon shines down \\u201clike a magician\\u2019s trick,\\u201d or a new crush offering \\u201cforbidden pleasure, the kind that kept crossroads demons in the business of buying souls.\\u201d Yet the book is also fresh, sharp and often frankly hilarious. I stayed up with this one past midnight on a storm-tossed night, drunk on the words and the unalloyed joy at the ending.\", \"In short, a perfect winter read, highly recommended for one of the longest nights of the year.\"]","href_hash":"d02374d85d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d02374d85d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}},
