In the court ruling, judges said that a \\\"refusal [to obtain a birth certificate] could make it more difficult for a Bulgarian identity document to be issued and, therefore, hinder the child's exercise of the right of free movement and thus full enjoyment of her rights as a Union citizen.\\\"\", \"Kalina Ivanova and British citizen Jane Jones, who was born in Gibraltar, were unable to obtain a birth certificate for their daughter, Sara, since neither woman is Spanish and Jones is unable to transfer citizenship under the British Nationality Act of 1981. When attempting to obtain Bulgarian citizenship under Ivanova, their child became stateless due to that country not recognizing same-sex couples.\", \"However, this ruling changes that. The court said that Sara and her mothers could be \\\"recognized by all member states as having the right, as parents of a Union citizen who is a minor and of whom they are the primary carers, to accompany that child when she is exercising her rights.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1951829/sofia-gay-pride.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The European Union's top court recently ruled in favor of same-sex parents and their children in the 27-nation bloc.
