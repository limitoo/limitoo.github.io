Her husband, Joseph Traub, was head of the computer science department there, which included artificial intelligence luminaries like Herbert Simon, Allen Newell and Raj Reddy.\", \"\\u201cShe was dumped into this saturated milieu of the great and greatest in A.I. at Carnegie Mellon \\u2014 some of the same people whose papers she\\u2019d helped us assemble \\u2014 and decided to write a history of the field,\\u201d Professor Feigenbaum said in a phone interview.\", \"The result was \\u201cMachines Who Think: A Personal Inquiry Into the History and Prospects of Artificial Intelligence\\u201d (1979), a chronicle of past attempts to mechanize thought. She also wrote about the founders of a new science who had conceived of expert systems, speech understanding, robotics, general problem-solving and game-playing machines, beginning in the mid-1950s. Their work was considered to be the first of its kind in this area.\", \"Artificial intelligence, she wrote, \\u201chas pervaded Western intellectual history, a dream in urgent need of being realized. Work toward that end has been a splendid effort, the variety of its forms as wondrous as anything humans have conceived, its practitioners as lively a group of poets, dreamers, holy men, rascals and eccentrics as one could hope to find \\u2014 not a dullard among them.\\u201d\", \"Ms. McCorduck\\u2019s \\u201cpowers of observation\\u201d and \\u201cconversational style\\u201d raised her book above others that in the years since have attempted to explain artificial intelligence to a broad audience, Philip Mirowski wrote in AI Magazine in a review of the 25th-anniversary edition of \\u201cMachines Who Think,\\u201d which included a long addendum updating A.I.\\u2019s history through 2004.\", \"Pamela Ann McCorduck was born on Oct. 27, 1940, in Liverpool, England, as the city was being subjected to months of intense bombing by the German Luftwaffe. She left when she was 6 for the United States with her parents, Jack and Hilda (Bond) McCorduck, and her two younger siblings, who are twins.\", \"Her father owned beauty colleges, where her mother was a beautician and teacher. The family settled first in Stamford, Conn., before moving several times. She graduated from high school in Rutherford, N.J., and received a bachelor\\u2019s degree in English composition and literature from Berkeley in 1960. Ten years later she earned a master\\u2019s in English literature at Columbia University.\", \"\\u201cComputers & Thought,\\u201d the result of her work with Professors Feigenbaum and Feldman, was published in 1963. She called herself a \\u201cgofer\\u201d to them, but Professor Feigenbaum said she had been essential to their project. She continued her association with Professor Feigenbaum as his executive assistant for several years after he left Berkeley for Stanford University in 1965 to help start its computer science department and to direct the Stanford Computation Center.\", \"She met Professor Traub at Stanford, and they married in 1969. (Her first marriage, to Thomas Tellefsen, had ended in divorce.) The next year they moved to Seattle, where he taught at the University of Washington; a year after that they moved to Pittsburgh. Around that time she published two novels: \\u201cFamiliar Relations\\u201d (1971), the story of a family set in Liverpool in 1944, and \\u201cWorking to the End\\u201d (1972), about a brilliant woman scientist in a love triangle with her brother-in-law.\", \"At Carnegie Mellon, where she taught in the English department, Ms. McCorduck got to know the computer scientists working on artificial intelligence and became particularly close with Professor Simon, who helped pioneer the idea that computers can exhibit artificial intelligence that mirrors human thinking.\", \"She often offered Professor Simon a glass of sherry when he walked past her house in Pittsburgh on his way home, and they discussed artificial intelligence, linguistics, music and art, she said in an oral history interview with Carnegie Mellon in 2019.\", \"Ms. McCorduck received financial support from Carnegie Mellon to write \\u201cComputers Who Think.\\u201d She also received help from the professors and researchers she had interviewed.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019d say, \\u2018I wrote this chapter, can you can read it?\\u2019\\u201d said Dr. Reddy, who is now university professor of computer science and robotics at Carnegie Mellon (and who, like Professors Feigenbaum and Simon, is a winner of the A.M. Turing Award, often called the Nobel Prize of computing). \\u201cShe was interacting with all the movers and shakers of A.I. She was in the middle of it, an eyewitness to history.\\u2019\", \"Ms. McCorduck moved to Columbia, where she taught creative writing, when Professor Traub was appointed the founding chairman of the university\\u2019s computer science department in 1979.\", \"She continued to write; among her later books were \\u201cThe Universal Machine\\u201d (1985), about the impact of computers on art, science, education and medicine; \\u201cThe Rise of the Expert Company\\u201d (1988), an exploration of how companies used artificial intelligence, written with Professor Feigenbaum and Penny Nii; and \\u201cAaron\\u2019s Code\\u201d (1990), about Harold Cohen, an abstract painter who developed a complex software program to generate works of art.\", \"She also published two more novels, \\u201cThe Edge of Chaos\\u201d in 2007 and \\u201cBounded Rationality\\u201d in 2012.\", \"In addition to her sister, she is survived by her brother, John, and her stepdaughters, Claudia Traub and Hillary Spector. Professor Traub died in 2015.\", \"Ms. McCorduck had regrets about not recognizing the possibility that artificial intelligence could be misused. She voiced those regrets in \\u201cThis Could Be Important,\\u201d her final book.\", \"\\u201cA thread in my book is how na\\u00efve I was \\u2014 we all were \\u2014 in the early days when it seemed as if more intelligence could only be like more virtue,\\u201d she told insideBigData, a website devoted to news about A.I., machine learning and data science, in 2020. \\u201cI\\u2019m especially disappointed with myself. I was a student of the humanities. How could I not have imagined that more intelligence would bring along all the usual misbehavior humans are capable of?\\u201d\", \"She was especially concerned with facial recognition systems, which she called \\u201ca blundering tool in the hands of governments,\\u201d adding: \\u201cIt will still be blundering when it improves technically.
