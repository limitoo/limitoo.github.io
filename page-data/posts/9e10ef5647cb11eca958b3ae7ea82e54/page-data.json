And you probably don’t have to.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-17T17:28:11.000Z","content":"[\"For about six months of this year, we had a glorious period when no child darkened our door at 3 a.m. But last month, for reasons obscure to me and my husband, either one or both of our kids started waking us up again in the middle of the night, multiple times a week. As far as I can tell, the younger one wakes up between sleep cycles, gets lonely and wants a cuddle. One of us takes her back to her bed, and she falls asleep immediately, then the lucky parent gets back into our bed \\u2014 wide awake.\", \"The older one has some trouble falling asleep at bedtime, which is 8:30 like her sister\\u2019s, but usually is slumbering by 9:30. We let her read a dead-tree book in bed as long as she likes, which helps. Her middle-of-the-night wakings are rarer but somehow more chaotic. She usually wakes both of us up, because she decides she absolutely must use our bathroom and turns on the brightest possible light.\", \"I know (I think?) they\\u2019re not actually plotting together, but it\\u2019s as if they\\u2019ve decided to take turns ruining our lives: More often than not, they wake up the next day fully rested and cheerful, while my husband and I are a collective wreck. There\\u2019s not enough coffee in the world to fix my face, and then my fourth grader finds the audacity to point out my eye bags.\", \"Thanks, sweetie.\", \"When your children are babies, the proverbial \\u201cthey\\u201d put the fear of God into you about good sleep. \\u201cSleep begets sleep,\\u201d they say, and if you don\\u2019t establish good sleep habits early on, your children could have behavioral and developmental problems and, later in life, maybe even increase their risk of dying of a heart attack. So we dutifully did all the things you\\u2019re supposed to do: created bedtime routines we continue to follow to the letter, have a dark, quiet and cool sleeping environment, put our children back to sleep in their own beds with minimal fuss or fanfare and maintain consistent and regular to-bed and wake-up times.\", \"This is usually where I would pivot to defining the \\u201cproblem\\u201d with my children (they won\\u2019t stay asleep) and how to fix it. But as I read the research and after I talked to Dr. Craig Canapari, the director of the Pediatric Sleep Center at Yale-New Haven Children\\u2019s Hospital, I became convinced that the kids don\\u2019t actually have a problem; the adults do. And I wonder if, in general, we\\u2019re too quick to feel as if the \\u201cnormal\\u201d range of kid behaviors is something that, with enough effort, we\\u2019re supposed to control. The subtext of that feeling being that if you\\u2019re not able to control your children\\u2019s sleep, you\\u2019re a bad parent.\", \"According to the 2016 consensus opinion of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, my 5-year-old should be getting 10 to 13 hours of sleep per 24 hours, and my almost-9-year-old should be getting nine to 12 hours for optimal health. And guess what? Even with their night wakings, my kids typically get that much sleep.\", \"In addition to sleep duration, there are a few other dimensions of sleep that the literature tends to mention: sleep quality, which can be objectively or subjectively measured and can be defined as \\u201cadequate when the person feels fresh when waking up from sleep\\u201d; sleep efficiency, which is the percentage of actual sleeping between bed and wake times; and sleep timing, which is bedtime and wake-up time.\", \"By as many of these measures as we can gauge on our own, my kids\\u2019 sleep patterns are fine. They don\\u2019t tend to report sleepiness during the day, and even if they have a night waking, they tell us in the morning that they slept well.\", \"When I talked to Canapari about what was going on in our household, he referred to the pediatrician Donald Winnicott and his concept of the \\u201cgood enough\\u201d parent. He argued that good-enough parents may be better than perfect parents because they allow children to \\u201ctolerate the frustrations of reality\\u201d through their mistakes, according to the American Psychological Association\\u2019s Dictionary of Psychology. \\u201cWhat is good-enough sleep?\\u201d Canapari mused. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re chasing that last 5 percent of quality or improvement in any parenting domain, you\\u2019re going to make yourself crazy.\\u201d It\\u2019s sort of the pediatric version of the politician\\u2019s \\u201cDon\\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\\u201d\", \"So how do you know your child is getting good-enough sleep? First, Canapari emphasized that the normal range is pretty wide and that some kids just need less sleep than others (though he noted that the parents of kids who need more sleep aren\\u2019t the ones going to see him in clinic). If your child is experiencing distress or anxiety over falling asleep (something my older daughter encounters from time to time), that\\u2019s something to work on.\", \"He also said to keep an eye on how late your children are sleeping on weekends. If your elementary schoolers are sleeping an extra three hours on Saturday, that may be a sign they are sleep deprived during the week and that they actually want to be asleep during their normal activities, Canapari said. (If you have a teenager, an extra two to three hours of sleep on weekends isn\\u2019t something he\\u2019d be concerned about.)\", \"If your children are functioning well during the day, even if they\\u2019re getting less sleep than you\\u2019d prefer, there\\u2019s not much to worry about \\u2014 but it\\u2019s always worth mentioning to your pediatrician if you have any concerns.\", \"That my husband and I are frazzled matters, though, Canapari emphasized. Even if our kids are fine, \\u201cyou shouldn\\u2019t feel guilty about wanting it to change,\\u201d he said. And he had a suggestion for us \\u2014 which many of my wise readers who\\u2019ve written in have already instituted in their families. It\\u2019s an intervention called a bedtime pass.\", \"Your kids get the bedtime pass every night, and if they want to wake you up in the middle of the night, they present the pass to you. If they don\\u2019t use the pass, they get a gift the next day. If your kids get really scared when they wake up, there\\u2019s an extra wrinkle to the bedtime pass: You can set up a sleeping bag on your floor for them, and as long as they don\\u2019t wake you up, they can still win the game and claim a reward.\", \"We are definitely going to try the bedtime pass with our kids soon. For now, though, we\\u2019re too tired even to make that happen.\", \"If you want a chance to get your Tiny Victory published, find us on Instagram @NYTparenting and use the hashtag #tinyvictories, email us or enter your Tiny Victory at the bottom of this page.
