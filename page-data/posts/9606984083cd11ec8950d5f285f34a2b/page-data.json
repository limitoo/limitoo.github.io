He said there were important lessons to be learned from the impacts of Covid-19, and the value of the Wage Subsidy and Resurgence Support Payment schemes.\", \"\\\"Our proposed scheme provides economic security to individuals directly, and supports them to transition into a good, new job, as opposed to economic support packages which keep people in their existing job even if that role is no longer viable,\\\" Robertson said.\", \"Permanent employers would be required to give four weeks' notice, and provide four weeks pay at 80 percent after the job ends, after which the scheme would kick in for up to six months.\", \"Applicants would be required to look for work or take part in training and rehabilitation.\", \"Eligibility: \", \"NZCTU president Richard Wagstaff said such a scheme would act as a financial cushion for the nearly 100,000 New Zealand workers who lost a job each year, often through no fault of their own.\", \"\\\"The Covid-19 outbreak is a stark example, but widespread job losses have occurred all-too-frequently over the last 40 years,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Finding a good job takes time.

The Covid-19 pandemic brought our then-largest export earner, tourism, to an abrupt halt.
