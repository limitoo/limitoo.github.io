When asked by the survey what would encourage them to drive more, 78 percent said lower gas prices.\", \"The predicted national average for a gallon of gas by Thanksgiving will be $3.35, GasBuddy reported. The price is $1.24 higher than the $2.11 national average during Thanksgiving last year.\", \"If oil costs increase before the holiday, it's entirely possible that gas prices could increase even more, raising the national average price to its highest point during the Thanksgiving holiday since the price of $3.44 a gallon during Thanksgiving 2012.\", \"Rising gas prices have resulted from two primary reasons, according to economists. Gas supplies have been constrained because of lower production in the United States. Also, other major oil-exporting countries have only modestly increased their own gas production.\", \"Democratic President Joe Biden is facing growing pressure to help reduce gas prices, but his options are limited. Oil-exporting countries have refused to increase production to meet U.S. needs.\", \"Biden could approve a sale of petroleum from the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but gas prices would still stay above $3 a gallon for the remainder of the year, according to Platts Analytics, a petrol data firm.\", \"On Wednesday, Biden called for an investigation into whether \\\"anti-consumer behavior by oil and gas companies\\\" has contributed to rising prices.\"]","href_hash":"615af87248e811ec87bdddb222900583"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"615af87248e811ec87bdddb222900583"}},
