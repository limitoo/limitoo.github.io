One is a huge climatic change and tectonic geologoical evolution that dried up the lake and it became cooler. The duck may not have been able to adapt fast enough to such changes.\", \"\\\"There's also the possibility that it evolved into something we know today but we haven't actually managed to join the dots and establish that relationship yet.\\\"\", \"Alan Tennyson, Te Papa's curator of vertebrates, says: \\\"The discovery further underscores the global importance of St Bathans fossils for understanding the evolution of ducks and their relatives.\\\"\", \"An Auckland University student, Simona Giovanardi, has drawn a reconstruction of what the duck and its environment may have looked like millions of years ago.\"]","href_hash":"2a7c9a64a01c11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2a7c9a64a01c11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
