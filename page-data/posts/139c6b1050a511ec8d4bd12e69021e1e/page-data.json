The pro-Trump MyPillow CEO had claimed he would have the support of multiple states' attorneys general. Their support did not materialize, however, and the much-touted Supreme Court lawsuit was not filed by his self-imposed Thanksgiving deadline.\", \"\\\"We've worked hard on this and they're making a mockery out of it [the lawsuit] right now on Facebook and stuff, the media over here, the attack media,\\\" Lindell said during his Thanks-A-Thon livestream on Sunday.\", \"\\\"You know how many people have worked hard giving up everything they had because they know this country is gone?\\\" Lindell asked, adding, \\\"I'm frustrated. I've had it.\\\"\", \"Former President Donald Trump also targeted the media on Sunday for its reporting on his election fraud claims.\", \"\\\"The Fake News Media cannot stand the fact that so many people in our Country know the truth, that the 2020 Election was rigged and stolen,'' Trump said in a statement. \\\"Yet almost every article written contains the words the 'Big Lie' or 'unsubstantiated facts,' etc., always trying to demean the real results.\\\"\", \"On Sunday, Lindell also spoke about the reasons why no state attorney general backed the lawsuit. He claimed that he spoke to about 20 attorneys general who told him that they needed more time because they \\\"were helping our country\\\" and assisting with vaccinating children against COVID.\", \"\\\"It's like we've worked so hard here. Working so hard to get to something that should have been so simple. Open up the [voting] machines. Of course, every state was illegal,\\\" he continued.\", \"Lindell initially planned to file the lawsuit by Thanksgiving on Thursday after weeks of promising that he would file a case challenging the 2020 election results with the support of multiple state attorney generals.\", \"\\\"We will have this before the Supreme Court before Thanksgiving,\\\" Lindell said in September. \\\"That's my promise to the people of this country.\\\"\", \"On Tuesday, Lindell publicly released a copy of his proposed lawsuit, which alleged that the 2020 presidential election was \\\"stolen\\\" despite the lack of evidence to support this claim.\", \"\\\"We are in unchartered [sic] territory as a Nation. The November 2020 election was stolen,\\\" the complaint copy read.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941203/mike-lindell-accuses-attack-media.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell accused the media on Sunday of \\\"making a mockery\\\" out of his proposed Supreme Court lawsuit alleging 2020 election fraud.
