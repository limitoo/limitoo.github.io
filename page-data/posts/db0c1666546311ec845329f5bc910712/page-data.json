Ablon, an improbable corporate matchmaker who expanded a family scrap metal company into a pioneering conglomerate that eventually thrived by investing in the growing service economy, died on Nov. 2 in Manhattan. He was 105.\", \"His death, in a hospital, was confirmed by his granddaughter, Kim Ablon Whitney.\", \"An erudite, pipe-puffing chemistry major, Mr. Ablon entered the ferrous recycling business in 1939 after he married a daughter of one of the owners of the Luria Brothers company in Redding, Pa.\", \"When Luria was bought by the Ogden Corporation of Manhattan in 1955 \\u2014 a formerly bankrupt utility holding company controlled by Allen & Company \\u2014 Mr. Ablon went on to become chairman and chief executive of Ogden in 1962 and president in 1972.\", \"He acquired some 55 subsidiaries, transforming the scrap metal processor into what Forbes magazine wrote \\u201cresembled nothing so much as a corporate kitchen sink\\u201d filled with everything from shipbuilding to the processing of Italian food.\", \"Buffering Ogden with the flexibility to weather economic upheavals in one sector or another, Mr. Ablon invested in Avondale Shipyards of New Orleans and the nation\\u2019s largest stevedoring company; food services like Progresso soups and sauces and the Nedicks fast food chain; and even racetracks and water parks.\", \"In 1991, Crains magazine cited him as \\u201cbucking the pervasive anti-woman bias\\u201d when he became \\u201cthe rare C.E.O. who appoints a woman as a top executive.\\u201d He had named Maria Monet as Ogden\\u2019s chief financial officer the year before. In 1966, he was instrumental in the election of Tillie Lewis as the company\\u2019s first female director.\", \"His buying spree ranged from big companies to smaller ones, as did his early successes and failures. In 1970, Mr. Ablon sought to buy the \\u201c21\\u201d Club in Manhattan, where he dined frequently, but the deal fell through when the price of Ogden\\u2019s stock declined. Another deal gone awry was Ogden\\u2019s purchase of the Charles Luckman architectural design firm.\", \"He learned, he said, to choose future investments according to an \\u201cadmissible risk threshold\\u201d \\u2014 how big the loss would be if the entire venture failed.\", \"While his early frenzy of diversification fizzled, Mr. Ablon subsequently \\u201corchestrated one of the most complete and successful business restructurings of recent times,\\u201d Forbes wrote in its profile of him. By the mid-1980s, his purchase of Allied Maintenance helped completely convert Ogden into an offices and industrial service company.\", \"One reason success had eluded him early on, Forbes suggested, was that Mr. Ablon was \\u201cnot your typical blunt-talking industrial manager.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe has a penchant for quoting Shakespeare while puffing professorially on his pipe,\\u201d the magazine added. \\u201cHis conceptualizing sometimes makes him describe Ogden as if it were an artistic or intellectual creation rather than a conglomerate that sells spaghetti sauce, services vending machines and deals in scrap metals.\\u201d\", \"For someone who was instrumental in creating conglomerates, he disliked the term. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know of any company that is not multimanagement,\\u201d he told The New York Times in 1968, \\u201cand conglomerate has become to mean acquisition for its own sake.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cCentral management concentrates on doing the right things,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand our subsidiary heads, who also participate in central management, are left alone to do things right.\\u201d\", \"He relinquished the titles of president and chief executive to his son R. Richard Ablon in 1990. In 2001, Ogden\\u2019s name was changed to Covanta.\", \"Ralph Emil Ablon was born on Oct. 26, 1916, in Tupelo, Miss., one of eight children of Zemore Ablon, a used-car salesman, and Louise (Strauss) Ablon, a homemaker.\", \"The family moved to Dayton, Ohio, in 1929, and Ralph attended high school there. Enrolling in Ohio State University, he majored in chemistry and was the business manager of the football team before graduating in 1938. He was a graduate teaching assistant in English briefly before marrying Sylvia Luria in 1939.\", \"In addition to his granddaughter Kim, his wife survives him along with their children, Steven, Patricia, Richard and Jennifer; five other grandchildren; and 16 great-grandchildren.\", \"Mr. Ablon served in the Navy and, since 1944, lived on Manhattan\\u2019s Upper East Side. He regularly swam at the New York Athletic Club, which, he said, he had originally joined under a pseudonym (Mr. Conolly) because the club didn\\u2019t allow Jewish members at the time.\", \"He acknowledged that some of his success resulted from being in the right place at the right time. His entree to Ogden came from meeting Charles R. Allen Jr., the founder of the family investment bank, by chance on the beach in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.\", \"While his goal was growth \\u2014 \\u201cevolutionary adaptation is just as important for a company as it is for organisms,\\u201d he once said \\u2014 Mr. Ablon had learned from his early high-flying years to modify his expectations. He liked to quote a sonnet from Shakespeare that ends, \\u201cLilies that fester smell far worse than weeds\\u201d \\u2014 which was his way of saying that there\\u2019s a reason that some companies look better than they turn out to be.\"]","href_hash":"db0c1666546311ec845329f5bc910712"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"db0c1666546311ec845329f5bc910712"}},
