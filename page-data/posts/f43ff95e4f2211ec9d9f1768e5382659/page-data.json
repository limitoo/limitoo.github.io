But the extent of the devastation on people\\u2019s lives and the landscape and public infrastructure from the rain that came down on parts of British Columbia nearly two weeks ago is exceptional. The deaths of five people have now been attributed to it as well.\", \"As Ian Willms, a photographer, and I visited various communities caught up in the disaster this week, some other extraordinary patterns emerged.\", \"The flood victims we approached were, without fail, gracious about sharing their stories of harrowing escapes and, in many cases, having lost everything they owned. Usually, at the end of our conversations, they assured us that they were the lucky ones. A neighbor down the road, a friend or a relative, they told us, had it much worse.\", \"[Read: Hundreds Rescued After Mudslides and Floods Pummel British Columbia]\", \"That consideration of others wasn\\u2019t limited to those whose homes were invaded by the water.\", \"In the town of Princeton, which was uncomfortably close to this summer\\u2019s wildfires and was hit by record heat, bands of volunteers of all ages were roving the streets and helping out. There are a lot of tears in Princeton and other communities right now, but they\\u2019re not all from grief over what\\u2019s lost. When flood victims described the kindness of those volunteers to me, some broke out in tears of gratitude.\", \"After two weeks, the cleanup still has a long way to go, with more heavy rain in the forecast. So far, no one is offering a prediction for the cost of rebuilding the lost and damaged houses, businesses and roads. The focus of officials remains on the immediate issues.\", \"In the midst of mud and chaos of the streets of Princeton, there was a rare bit of spotlessness. Raelene Campana, a local fourth grade teacher whose house sits high above the flood zone, and several of her colleagues, made about 80 sandwiches, dozens of cookies and soup each day and handed them out to anyone who needed them, displaced homeowner or volunteer.\", \"As a group of volunteers gathered around her foldout table for a lunch break, Ms. Campana shared a thought we heard from many this week in British Columbia.\", \"\\u201cHopefully, people who say there\\u2019s no such thing as climate change will wake up a little,\\u201d she said, gesturing to a group of schoolchildren helping out with the sandwiches and snacks. \\u201cThis generation is really going to feel the effects of it.
