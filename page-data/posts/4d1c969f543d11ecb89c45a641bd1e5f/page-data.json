That means no spending with white companies from 11/26/2021\\u201401/01/2022,\\\" the blackxmas.org site says.\", \"The campaign also calls for people to \\\"move your money out of white corporate banks that finance our oppression\\\" into Black-owned banks and support other Black organizations by making donations in the names of family members as holiday gifts.\", \"\\\"As BLM LA organizer, Jan Williams, reminds us, 'Capitalism doesn't love Black people,'\\\" the organization writes on its website.\", \"\\\"In fact, white-supremacist-capitalism invented policing, initially as chattel-slavery-era 'paddy rollers,' in order to protect its interests and put targets on the backs of Black people.\", \"\\\"Black Xmas challenges us to shake off the chains of consumerism and step fully into our own collective power, to build new traditions, and run an offense as well as a defense. Let's harness our economic power to disrupt white supremacist capitalism and build Black community.\\\"\", \"Black Xmas started as a response to the death of John Crawford, a Black man who was shot and killed by police in a Walmart store in Beavercreek, Ohio, in 2014.\", \"In recent years, Black Xmas also called consumers to shop at Black-owned businesses as a way to protest Donald Trump.\", \"Speaking to YES! magazine, Black Lives Matter activist Melina Abdullah explained the three core tenets of the Black Xmas campaign: Building Black, buying Black, and banking Black.\", \"\\\"Take Building Black...Maybe your aunt is a survivor of domestic violence, and maybe she would appreciate a donation in her name to the Jenesse Center, which provides housing and resources for survivors\\u2014especially Black women survivors\\u2014of domestic violence,\\\" Abdullah said.\", \"\\\"That's really what Black Xmas is about. It's about shaking off the chains of consumerism and confronting White capitalism but also building new traditions.\", \"\\\"The second tenet of Black Xmas is Buying Black,\\\" Abdullah added. \\\"Sometimes, your mother really does need a sweater. Rather than giving your money to Macy's, you can go to Nobody Jones or other Black boutiques.\", \"\\\"Rather than buying from Amazon, a company that we know exploits its workers, you can go to small Black-owned bookstores, like Eso Won Books or Malik Books.\\\"\", \"Abdullah added that by investing in Black-owned banks instead of major financial institutions such as CitiBank or Wells Fargo, they are not inadvertently funding \\\"oppression,\\\" investment in private prisons or financing \\\"environmental degradation\\\" like the Dakota Access Pipeline.\", \"Abdullah said the concept of Black Xmas is especially important this year as throughout the pandemic about 40 percent of Black-owned businesses have permanently closed.\", \"The Black Xmas campaign has its own website where people can find where to shop at Black-owned businesses in such places as Los Angeles or South Bend, Indiana.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944924/black-xmas.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Demonstrators gather in Philadelphia to protest the Eric Garner grand jury decision during a Christmas Tree lighting ceremony at City Hall December 3, 2014 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
