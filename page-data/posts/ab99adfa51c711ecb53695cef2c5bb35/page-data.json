The jacket copy gives us the lowdown: In December 2016, on a flight from Cape Verde to Lisbon, Hannaham found himself reading Pessoa\\u2019s collected poems. The Trump presidency loomed like bad weather. He had also recently become captivated by a TV show, \\u201cAir Disasters,\\u201d which documented famous plane crashes, hijackings and bombings. Hannaham blended these interests and anxieties with his impressions of Lisbon to form \\u201cPilot Impostor,\\u201d a hybrid work of stories, essays, poetry, jokes and visual art. It doesn\\u2019t all hang together, though its best pieces possess the improbable coherence of dreams.\", \"Pessoa, that great, self-proliferating poet, is a useful antecedent. His alter egos, or \\u201cheteronyms,\\u201d are on nearly every page. Their fragmented aphorisms serve as bread crumbs in a forest of forms. Though written in tiny font and hung in unobtrusive corners, they obliquely orient the reader. Pessoa\\u2019s line \\u201cThis species of madness\\u201d appears alongside \\u201cGhost Plane,\\u201d a story about a flight without a pilot. \\u201cCountless lives inhabit us,\\u201d his heteronym Ricardo Reis proclaims atop the poem \\u201cI\\u2019m Missing,\\u201d a paean to multivalence: \\u201cI\\u2019m more than one. / It\\u2019s too fun for me.\\u201d Like Pessoa\\u2019s phantom poets, Hannaham\\u2019s narrator \\u2014 or is it narrators? \\u2014 is elusive, mysterious, funny, various and a little ethereal.\", \"He is also indignant. The book quietly seethes. America\\u2019s racial divides, past and present, animate much of the work. \\u201cBlack Rage\\u201d comprises three true-crime miniatures in which Black men, motivated by revenge, hatred or insurance money, have taken over flights and trains. In \\u201cDear White Woman I Nearly Hit With My Car This Morning,\\u201d Hannaham, who is Black, uses a crosswalk showdown to suggest the difficulty of charitable understanding. \\u201cFerdinand Magellan\\u201d refashions the Portuguese explorer\\u2019s legacy in mocking, profane battle lyrics: \\u201cColonizin\\u2019 folks as you was travelin\\u2019 / Spreading Christianity\\u2019s infection.\\u201d\", \"There are also pages of seeming nonsense. \\u201cOn Seeing Pessoa\\u201d repeats the poet\\u2019s name amid a series of forward and back slashes. \\u201cFelt\\u201d dissolves in its own syntactic echo chamber: \\u201cWe feel we have felt felt. We have felt what felt we have. Have felt. Feel.\\u201d The recursive, algorithmic \\u201cGreat Weekend\\u201d is like a machine attempting conversation. An untitled two-page spread features alien hieroglyphics scratched into what could be a WordArt template from the 1990s. These juxtapositions of trenchant commentary, menace and absurdism are provocative. Something like the irreverent, ravaging spirit of Dadaism occasionally draws near.\", \"Hannaham, who is also a visual artist, uses images to anchor or countervail the texts. There are photographs of plane crashes, paintings, flight path readouts, patterned textures and squares he found in Lisbon, memes, movie stills, abstract geometric pieces and Google Maps selections. Taken together, they create a sense of mediation and instability. Who and where we are \\u2014 historically, culturally, existentially \\u2014 is always a negotiable prospect for the author.\", \"This elasticity sometimes leads the book into thin or unconvincing territory. What exhilarates on one page disorients on the next. The different registers can feel haphazard. Trump impersonations rub elbows with hallucinated geographies, gnomic stanzas, error messages and utopian gestures. Who are we in the midst of such debris? Hannaham seems to ask. What is real? In lieu of answers, the book offers a kind of anti-catharsis: \\u201cWe must live life forward and attempt to make sense of it backward. So we fail in both directions.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ab99adfa51c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ab99adfa51c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}},
