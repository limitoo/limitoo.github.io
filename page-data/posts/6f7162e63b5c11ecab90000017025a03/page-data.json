Two workers at the scene told Reuters that 100 people were likely working at the site when the building gave way.\", \"The scene was a replay of the structural collapses that have happened multiple times in recent years in Lagos, Nigeria\\u2019s financial hub. Experts have pointed to poor design, shoddy materials and the lack of or insufficient monitoring by inspectors as the leading causes of the accidents.\", \"In the Ikoyi neighborhood on Monday, video posted on social media and aired by local news media showed that the building\\u2019s floors had collapsed onto one another like a many-layered sandwich.\", \"Crowds immediately gathered to try and dig through the rubble by hand. Many angry residents congregated at the debris site, some crying, others clenching their fists in frustration over the sluggish response by authorities.\", \"\\u201cLiterally saw my life before me,\\u201d Muhammad Tukur, an eyewitness in a nearby building, said in a post on Twitter. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think I\\u2019d be alive to tweet this if it were the one closer to our window. Our office was vibrating as the building was collapsing.\\u201d\", \"As rescue efforts continued into the evening, officials said they had dispatched emergency responders to the scene. Mr. Farinloye said authorities were trying to speed up the rescue operations.\", \"\\u201cWe are moving in the military to take over operations because it is beyond the capacity of the civil operators,\\u201d he said.\", \"Olufemi Damilola Oke-Osanyintolu, the director general of the Lagos State Emergency Management Agency, said in a Facebook statement: \\u201cAll first responders are at the scene while the heavy duty equipment and life detection equipment have been dispatched.\\u201d\", \"In 2019, a building in Lagos housing a school for children collapsed, killing at least 20 people, according to officials. In 2016, at least 34 people were killed in the Lekki district in Lagos State when a building under construction collapsed. In 2013, at least seven were killed after a three-story building in the low-income Ebute Meta neighborhood in Lagos collapsed.\"]","href_hash":"6f7162e63b5c11ecab90000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6f7162e63b5c11ecab90000017025a03"}},
