If you grew up Roman Catholic, the phrase \\u201cchild of Mary\\u201d might already be familiar. Likewise the notion of moral purity it connotes, ingrained early in the narrator of Eimear McBride\\u2019s formidable rush of a novel \\u201cA Girl Is a Half-Formed Thing,\\u201d whose solo-show stage adaptation by Annie Ryan is getting a gorgeously lucid, intimate production at the Irish Repertory Theater.\", \"Both the novel, published in the United States in 2014, and the stage version, first seen in New York in 2016, predate the rise of the #MeToo movement. But they reflect an anger that was building and that McBride was able to articulate in the speed-of-thought story of a girl, whose name we never learn: a child who draws strength from what she has been taught to believe is her badness, but is left unguarded against others\\u2019 actual evil.\", \"Directed by Nicola Murphy on Irish Rep\\u2019s tiny second stage, Jenn Murray rides the current of the monologue like a river, navigating its rapids and eddies, and stretches of calm, with a deftness that easily brings the audience along. On a spare set by Chen-Wei Liao, abetted by Michael O\\u2019Connor\\u2019s lighting and underscored by Nathanael Brown\\u2019s subtle music and sound design, Murray slips in and out of a crowd of characters with near-total legibility.\", \"The girl is in utero when the play begins, but sentient all the same, and already fond of her toddler big brother. The whole play is spoken to him, her most precious person, who, by the time she is born, is surgery- scarred, with branches of a tumor left in his brain.\", \"Their mother, abandoned by her husband and frightened for her son, clings to religion. She might love her daughter. Mainly, she seems repelled by her.\", \"As a small child reveling in naughtiness, the girl races into the rain to swear lavishly \\u2014 \\u201cMy bad words best collection,\\u201d she calls it \\u2014 where no one else can hear. Part of the pain of the play is watching that exuberant defiance ground down by shaming rules that dictate permissible female behavior and blame those who, by their own choice or someone else\\u2019s, don\\u2019t comply.\", \"She is 13 when her aunt and uncle come to visit. The others leave the house, and the uncle, stomach-lurchingly, seizes his chance. He goes to the girl\\u2019s room, charms her, kisses her. She thinks he wants more, but he protests: \\u201cI\\u2019m not that man.\\u201d He is, though, and he does. She is a child and he ought to be her protector. When sex hurts her, he says, \\u201cYou\\u2019ll be fine.\\u201d\", \"This isn\\u2019t true then or in the years that follow, as his predation works its warping damage and what feels to the girl like her own sexual empowerment morphs into egregious, long-term self-harm.\", \"In college, she won\\u2019t speak the secret of her uncle\\u2019s abuse even to her best friend.\", \"\\u201cWhat is there to say?\\u201d she asks.
