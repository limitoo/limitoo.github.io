Blige battles and overcomes self-doubt. \\u201cI\\u2019m so tired of feeling empty,\\u201d she sings in a gritty croon over a slow-rolling, vintage-style soul track, abetted by a moody string arrangement. But she\\u2019s got the solution: looking in the mirror every morning with the self-affirmation, \\u201cGood morning, gorgeous.\\u201d She adds, \\u201cI ain\\u2019t talking about getting no hair and makeup/I\\u2019m talking about soon as I wake up.\\u201d The video makes clear she\\u2019s waking up in a mansion, toned and bejeweled, a long way from \\u201call the times that I hated myself.\\u201d JON PARELES\", \"\\u201cJupiter\\u2019s Dance\\u201d is an exercise in tenderness. It is a welcome departure for Alynda Segarra, who typically makes warm folk-punk as Hurray for the Riff Raff, here trading grit for cosmic reverie. In a breathy whisper, Segarra coos: \\u201cSeven revolutions around the sun/Blessings on our way, it has only begun.\\u201d The video juxtaposes celestial NASA images with found footage of people dancing to the Afro-Puerto Rican genres bomba and plena. It is a galactic prayer, a belief in the promise of the future, rooted in the vitality of the past. ISABELIA HERRERA\", \"Pointedly released on Thanksgiving Day, \\u201cAnother Day in America\\u201d borrows the tune of \\u201cAmerica\\u201d from \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d anticipating the release next week of the Steven Spielberg remake. Over syncopated guitar and a boom-bap beat, Kali Uchis sings and raps in English, keeping her tone cheerful but not mincing words: \\u201cSay \\u2018land of the free\\u2019/But the land was always stolen.\\u201d Ozuna, from Puerto Rico, sing-raps in Spanish, declaring, \\u201cQuisiera tumbar las fronteras de M\\u00e9xico a Nigeria\\u201d: \\u201cI would like to bring down the borders from Mexico to Nigeria.\\u201d It\\u2019s a conversation starter. PARELES\", \"The Norwegian songwriter Aurora has announced her next album, due Jan. 21, is titled \\u201cThe Gods We Can Touch,\\u201d and on \\u201cHeathens\\u201d she sings about Eve, Eden and falling from grace to a life on Mother Earth. It\\u2019s a shimmering, wide-screen production, with pealing harp, Aurora\\u2019s choir-like harmonies and a seismic beat that comes and goes. It\\u2019s also a warning that paradise was lost. \\u201cEverything we touch is evil,\\u201d Aurora sings. \\u201cThat is why we live like heathens.\\u201d PARELES\", \"Recently \\u201csemi-separated\\u201d from the Tesla billionaire Elon Musk, with whom she has a child, Grimes (Claire Boucher) coos club-ready recriminations in \\u201cPlayer of Games,\\u201d which she sometimes sings like \\u201cplay your love games.\\u201d Over a brisk house track written and produced with Illangelo, she asks questions like \\u201cBaby, will you still love me?\\u201d and \\u201cHow can I compare to the adventure out there?\\u201d as the arpeggios repeat and the four-on-the-floor thumps. \\u201cIf I loved him any less, I\\u2019d make him stay,\\u201d she asserts, teasing the gossip-industrial complex. PARELES\", \"A deliriously comic, sexually playful disco anthem from Kim Petras, advocating for, one could say, one kind of fruit over all the rest: \\u201cStrawberry, mango, lime/don\\u2019t compare to these.\\u201d JON CARAMANICA\", \"Kerozen, from Ivory Coast, praises patient, diligent hard work in \\u201cMotivation,\\u201d but the song provides instant gratification anyway. A galloping six-beat groove carries exultant close-harmony vocals, punched up by pattering snare drums and bursts of synthesizers and simulated horns \\u2014 pure positive energy. PARELES\", \"The latest find from the indefatigable crate-diggers at Analog Africa is \\u201cEssiebon Special 1973-1984: Ghana Power House,\\u201d from the archives of the Essiebons and Dix labels. It\\u2019s Ghanaian highlife souped up with funk, Afrobeat, synthesizers and psychedelia, like \\u201cAhwene Pa Nkasa,\\u201d a groove that materializes out of a funk backbeat, turns into a chattery, competitive stereo dialogue between two synthesizer keyboards and eventually gets around to its call-and-response vocals, fading out before the chorus gets done. PARELES\", \"A casually excellent rhyme workout from Cordae, who reveres the complexity of the 1990s \\u2014 \\u201cEight months with no phone, dog/we aiming for brilliance\\u201d \\u2014 and Lil Wayne, who at his late 2000s mixtape peak, which he recalls here, turned complexity into extraterrestriality. CARAMANICA\", \"A strategically placed beat change is more than a secret weapon: It can turn a standard rap track into delicious deviance. Elado Carri\\u00f3n\\u2019s \\u201cSocio\\u201d opens with a soulful piano intro and snare-driven beat reminiscent of something Drake\\u2019s go-to producer Noah \\u201c40\\u201d Shebib might pull out of his hard drive. But before long, the barbs arrive. A muted echo of Russell Crowe\\u2019s infamous \\u201cGladiator\\u201d line \\u201cAre you not entertained?!\\u201d crashes into the production, and a muscular, speaker-knocking beat unravels. The guest rapper Luar la L shoots off punch lines like rounds of silver bullets, his full-throated baritone landing each with serrated precision. HERRERA\", \"A good old-fashioned power country duet, with references to the grim day job, a speeding car and the high-horsepower intensity of a rough-hewed love. CARAMANICA\", \"The Village Vanguard is where the bassist Christian McBride first performed, over a decade ago, with Inside Straight, which has become maybe the most distinguished acoustic quintet in jazz. McBride\\u2019s latest release with Inside Straight, \\u201cLive at the Village Vanguard,\\u201d was recorded there years later, in 2014, during another weeklong run. \\u201cGang Gang,\\u201d written by the vibraphonist Warren Wolf, is the album\\u2019s longest track and its most intense. The group centers itself around the drummer Carl Allen\\u2019s heavy, spiraling swing feel, and Wolf takes a solo full of pelted, bluesy notes, painting a cloud of energy in pointillist strokes. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO\", \"The Portuguese vocalist Sara Serpa traces an etched, wordless line while Sof\\u00eea Rei and Aubrey Johnson circle her with sung melodies of their own, and ambient street sounds gargle below. Soon Serpa begins singing words from the Nigerian writer Emmanuel Iduma\\u2019s book, \\u201cA Stranger\\u2019s Pose,\\u201d about his travels across the African continent: \\u201cI can recite distances by heart feet memory/I can tell wanderlust rounded as the eyes,\\u201d she sings. Then Iduma\\u2019s voice enters, accompanied by the pianist Matt Mitchell, reading a passage on the power of language to create a space \\u201cbetween reality and dream.\\u201d \\u201cFirst Song\\u201d opens Serpa and Iduma\\u2019s impressive new collaborative album, \\u201cIntimate Strangers,\\u201d a collage of her swimming melodies and his words \\u2014 many of which describe the experiences of laborers seeking their fate on the road, sometimes heading north to Europe, but in many cases stuck waiting for something to change around them.
