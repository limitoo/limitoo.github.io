Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, stave off a mounting sexual harassment scandal.\", \"In his first public remarks on CNN\\u2019s decision, Mr. Cuomo, speaking on his SiriusXM radio program, acknowledged his suspension \\u2014 \\u201cit hurts to even say it\\u201d \\u2014 but said he understood it, adding: \\u201cI know they have a process that they think is important. I respect that process.\\u201d\", \"For CNN and its president, Jeff Zucker, however, the questions over Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s breach of basic journalistic rules and the timing of the network\\u2019s decision to suspend him are unlikely to disappear.\", \"CNN said on Tuesday that it would pursue a \\u201cfurther evaluation\\u201d of thousands of pages of new evidence released on Monday by the New York attorney general, Letitia James. Those documents included testimony and text messages showing that Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s role in advising the governor\\u2019s aides \\u2014 already a violation of the traditional barriers between journalists and lawmakers \\u2014 had been more involved and intimate than previously known.\", \"Ms. James\\u2019s report took CNN management by surprise, according to three people familiar with internal conversations. Mr. Zucker\\u2019s decision to suspend Mr. Cuomo came so late on Tuesday that the \\u201cCuomo Prime Time\\u201d production team was already in the office preparing for that evening\\u2019s broadcast. Mr. Cuomo met in person with Mr. Zucker in the late afternoon and then addressed his staff in an emotional meeting, two of the people said.\", \"The network declined to comment on Wednesday about the exact contours of its inquiry into Mr. Cuomo, calling it an internal matter.\", \"But CNN has no immediate plans to retain an outside law firm or forensic investigators for the review, according to a person briefed on the company\\u2019s plans, who was granted anonymity to share details of private discussions.\", \"The review is expected to focus on any ethical journalistic lines that Mr. Cuomo may have crossed, the person said. The network is also focused on comparing Ms. James\\u2019s evidence with what the anchor had told executives about his conduct. CNN has not publicly referred to the inquiry as an investigation, instead calling it \\u201ca thorough review\\u201d that would seek \\u201cadditional clarity\\u201d into the situation.\", \"Mr. Zucker \\u2014 who told staff members on a Wednesday conference call that the decision to suspend Mr. Cuomo was his own \\u2014 has been juggling the controversy with a series of high-level meetings this week at CNN\\u2019s Manhattan headquarters, including a visit from the network\\u2019s potential future overseer, David Zaslav of Discovery.\", \"For Mr. Zucker, the decision to suspend Mr. Cuomo was a clear shift after months of supporting his highest-rated anchor, even as details surfaced about Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s involvement with his brother\\u2019s response to the scandal and as some journalists inside the network raised objections.\", \"In May, the network called Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s actions \\u201cinappropriate,\\u201d and the anchor apologized on-air. But Mr. Zucker also told CNN employees that Mr. Cuomo \\u201cis human, and these are very unique circumstances.\\u201d When records surfaced in August showing some of his exchanges with the governor\\u2019s aides, Mr. Cuomo remained on the air, acknowledging the situation only after his brother resigned.\", \"\\u201cI tried to do the right thing, and I just want you all to know that,\\u201d he told viewers on Aug. 16.\", \"Mr. Zucker\\u2019s calculus changed this week amid a drumbeat of criticism over the new documents, which showed that Mr. Cuomo sent feedback on public statements and attempted to check the status of in-the-works news articles that could have been damaging to his brother. \\u201cChris sends me a lot of things a lot of the time,\\u201d one former top aide to the governor, Melissa DeRosa, told investigators.\", \"In August, Mr. Cuomo told viewers he \\u201cnever made calls to the press\\u201d about his brother\\u2019s scandal. But in sworn testimony released on Monday, Mr. Cuomo said that when requested by his brother\\u2019s aides, he \\u201cwould reach out to sources, other journalists, to see if they had heard of anybody else coming out.\\u201d\", \"A representative for Mr. Cuomo did not respond to an inquiry on Wednesday.\", \"By suspending Mr. Cuomo, not terminating him, CNN left a possible path for him to make a return. On Wednesday, Brian Stelter, CNN\\u2019s chief media correspondent, speculated on air that \\u201cit\\u2019s possible he\\u2019ll be back in January.\\u201d\", \"There is precedent for a major TV host surviving a suspension. In 2015, NBC News executives removed the anchor Brian Williams from \\u201cNightly News\\u201d for six months without pay for exaggerating a story about a helicopter trip in Iraq. Few in the TV industry thought Mr. Williams could find a viable route to a comeback, and some of his own colleagues objected to his return.\", \"But Mr. Williams slowly rebuilt his career at MSNBC, NBC\\u2019s cable news network, first as a breaking news anchor and then as an 11 p.m. host. He is now entertaining suitors for his next move after announcing last month that he would leave NBC at the end of the year.\", \"One of those suitors could well end up being Mr. Zucker, who is on the hunt for high-wattage talent for a new streaming service, CNN+, which is set to debut in 2022. Mr. Zucker approached Rachel Maddow about a position, although she ultimately decided to remain at MSNBC.\", \"On his Wednesday conference call, Mr. Zucker told CNN employees that no decisions had yet been made about a temporary replacement for Mr. Cuomo in the 9 p.m. time slot. Anderson Cooper is currently stretching his 8 p.m. program by an extra hour.\"]","href_hash":"5f67bdb4530d11ecb74ec955a41e95b6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5f67bdb4530d11ecb74ec955a41e95b6"}},
