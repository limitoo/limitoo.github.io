Trump and his family business that has resulted in the indictment of the company and one of its top executives.\", \"If Alvin Bragg, the heavily favored Democratic nominee, prevails, he will become the first Black man to lead the Manhattan district attorney\\u2019s office. Mr. Bragg, a former federal prosecutor and a chief deputy at the New York State attorney general\\u2019s office, has throughout his campaign drawn on his biography to explain his policies, which he has said balance public safety with fairness for all defendants.\", \"The office prosecutes a disproportionate number of Black men, and many of Mr. Bragg\\u2019s supporters have said that his personal experiences would help transform its work, moving its focus away from low-level crimes and toward gun trafficking, economic crime and public corruption.\", \"His Republican opponent, Thomas Kenniff, a veteran of the Iraq war and a defense lawyer, provides a sharp contrast: Mr. Kenniff is looking to crack down on low-level misdemeanors including fare-beating and graffiti. He believes that doing so will lower the overall crime rate.\", \"Mr. Kenniff, who was a longtime resident of Manhattan before moving to Long Island several years ago, has said he would move back to the city if he were to win on Tuesday.\", \"Mr. Bragg has said that in his time at the attorney general\\u2019s office, he sued the Trump administration \\u201cmore than 100 times,\\u201d but he has also said that those cases were separate from the district attorney\\u2019s investigation that he would inherit.\", \"Mr. Kenniff said that if he were to find that the former president had committed any crime, he would \\u201cabsolutely\\u201d prosecute the case, and that he did not agree with Mr. Trump\\u2019s contention that the investigation was a form of political persecution.\"]","href_hash":"b5537ff23bfb11ecbd75000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b5537ff23bfb11ecbd75000017025a03"}},
