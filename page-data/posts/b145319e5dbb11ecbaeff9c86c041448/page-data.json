Andrew M. Cuomo on Tuesday to turn over millions of dollars in profits from his coronavirus pandemic memoir, giving him 30 days to comply.\", \"The extraordinary directive is the latest development in a fall from grace for the former governor, who in the span of just four months lost his job and reputation, and who is now facing a criminal trial after being accused of groping an aide in the Executive Mansion. \", \"It was not long ago that Mr. Cuomo was at his peak, winning nationwide acclaim and landing a lucrative book contract in the first months of New York\\u2019s pandemic crisis. The resulting memoir, \\u201cAmerican Crisis: Leadership Lessons from the Covid-19 Pandemic,\\u201d was intended to capitalize on the moment and give him a financial cushion that would safeguard his future. \", \"But by a 12-1 vote on Tuesday, the state\\u2019s Joint Commission on Public Ethics stripped him of all of the book\\u2019s proceeds. The board had previously ruled that Mr. Cuomo had received authorization for the deal under false pretenses, and it decided on Tuesday that he was not entitled to keep any of the profits from it.\", \"The board\\u2019s decision rests on Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s application for approval of the book deal, in which his lawyer vowed that \\u201cno state property, personnel or other resources may be utilized for activities associated with the book.\\u201d \", \"The commission contended that Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, broke that promise when he availed himself of administration officials and lower-paid aides to help him with writing, editing and publication.\", \"The order, which is sure to set up a protracted legal fight, could be further complicated by Mr. Cuomo having already donated $500,000 of the book\\u2019s proceeds to a charity, the United Way of New York State, to support its Covid-19 efforts. He also placed $1 million in a trust for his three daughters.\", \"Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s team has said that it was in close contact with commission staff and that it had followed all advice and precedent in requesting approval for the book deal. Richard Azzopardi, Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s spokesman, characterized the ethics board\\u2019s order as \\u201cpolitical hypocrisy and duplicity at its worst.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cAny staffer who assisted in this project did so on their own time.\\u201d \", \"Jim McGuire, a lawyer for Mr. Cuomo, said the ethics board\\u2019s actions \\u201care unconstitutional, exceed its own authority and appear to be driven by political interests rather than the facts and the law.\\u201d He added: \\u201cShould they seek to enforce this action, we\\u2019ll see them in court.\\u201d\", \"David Grandeau, the state\\u2019s former top lobbying regulator who was known for his aggressive tactics, agreed, suggesting that the board was overstepping its authority. \\u201cThey have no more authority to do this then they do to issue an order removing Carl Heastie from office,\\u201d he said, referring to the speaker of the State Assembly. \", \"A spokesman for the state attorney general\\u2019s office, which the commission charged with enforcing the order, said the office was reviewing the commission\\u2019s vote and \\u201cdetermining how best to move forward.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s use of government resources was a key component in the investigation undertaken by investigators for the State Assembly. That inquiry, which began as an effort to determine whether Mr. Cuomo should be impeached, concluded last month. \", \"The report produced by investigators documented deep involvement of executive staff in the book\\u2019s creation; one top aide sent or received more than 300 emails about the memoir last year, while another sent or received more than 1,000 messages.\", \"An earlier report issued on Aug. 3 by Letitia James, the state attorney general, examined allegations of sexual harassment lodged against Mr. Cuomo by multiple women, including current and former employees. Mr. Cuomo resigned one week after the report\\u2019s release.\", \"Ms. James\\u2019s investigation also led to the dismissal of Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s brother, Chris, from CNN. Transcripts from the inquiry that were released last month revealed that the younger Mr. Cuomo had played a much larger role in advising his brother\\u2019s team than he had initially let on, leading CNN to fire him as a prime-time host.\", \"Andrew Cuomo has vigorously denied that he used government resources inappropriately, and members of his team have repeatedly suggested that there was little difference between the staff members who volunteered to assist with the book and the practice of legislative staffers volunteering on campaigns. \", \"At a meeting last month, the state ethics panel voted to revoke the book deal approval Mr. Cuomo had received, offering him the opportunity to reapply for it. He did not do so. \", \"The board directed Mr. Cuomo on Tuesday to relinquish the earnings from the book to the state attorney general\\u2019s office, and authorized the office to enforce the collection. \", \"Only one commissioner \\u2014 William Fisher, an appointee of Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s \\u2014 opposed the decision, citing a lack of precedent and concerns that the board lacked the legal authority to make such a demand. \", \"The makeup of the board has been in flux in recent months after many of Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s appointees resigned and were replaced by Gov. Kathy Hochul, a Democrat who succeeded Mr. Cuomo.\", \"Richard Braun, a commissioner who voted in favor, said that the action was a logical next step. \", \"\\u201cIt would be inequitable for us to revoke the approval for the governor\\u2019s book deal and for him to still keep the funds,\\u201d said Mr. Braun, a former state Supreme Court judge who was appointed to the commission by Mr. Heastie, a Democrat.\", \"He added, \\u201cWe\\u2019ve revoked. There should be a remedy.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Grandeau, who has criticized Mr. Cuomo and the ethics commission in the past, argued that the commission should have held a hearing to prove Mr. Cuomo abused state resources, and given him an opportunity to make his case. \", \"But, he noted, a hearing could have opened the panel up to more criticism if it surfaced additional details about how the board gave Mr. Cuomo its authorization in the first place.\", \"\\u201cIf they did it the right way, they would still have the home court advantage,\\u201d he said, adding: \\u201cFair is fair, do it the right way.\\u201d\", \"The book\\u2019s publisher, Crown, had paid Mr. Cuomo the bulk of the money, $3.12 million, last year, of which he netted $1.5 million after taxes and expenses. According to the contract, Crown was expected to pay the remaining $2 million in installments over the next two years. \", \"It remains unclear if Crown will do so; it suspended its promotion of the book earlier this year, following Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s legal troubles related to nursing home data. It is also unclear who would receive the book\\u2019s proceeds if they were to be clawed back.\", \"Under the resolution, Ms. James\\u2019s office will determine whether the money should be redirected to the state\\u2019s coffers or back to Crown, a subsidiary of Penguin Random House. That Ms. James is tasked with making that decision is sure to rankle Mr. Cuomo, who has described the sexual harassment investigation she oversaw as politically motivated and has blamed her for his resignation.\", \"Mr. Cuomo is confronting several investigations by the federal government, which is scrutinizing his administration\\u2019s efforts to downplay the death toll of nursing home residents during the pandemic, among other matters. \", \"In October, he was criminally charged with groping the breast of a former executive assistant in the Executive Mansion last year. He is scheduled to be arraigned in January. \"]","href_hash":"b145319e5dbb11ecbaeff9c86c041448"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b145319e5dbb11ecbaeff9c86c041448"}},
