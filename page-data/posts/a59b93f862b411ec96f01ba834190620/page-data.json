Manchin also claimed that shifting to clean energy too quickly would lead to \\\"catastrophic consequences,\\\" citing Texas and California as examples of states experiencing energy issues.\\u00a0\", \"Scientists say that the world has less than a decade to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels, industrial processes and agriculture in order to avoid the worst effects of climate change.\", \"Last year, the miners' union endorsed a plan to transition to clean energy while retraining coal miners for clean-energy jobs, saying, \\\"Change is coming, whether we seek it or not.\\\" The union's program includes retraining displaced coal workers, building out clean-energy facilities in coalfields, and investing in carbon capture and storage technology.\", \"About 14,000 West Virginians worked in coal extraction last year, according to the U.S. Energy and Employment Report. Nationwide, about 130,000 people work in coal mines or coal-fired power plants. By comparison, more than 350,000 work in solar or wind power generation, although very few of those workers are in West Virginia.\\u00a0\", \"Much of Manchin's personal wealth is linked to coal. According to OpenSecrets, which tracks money in politics, he made about $5 million from coal companies over the past decade. In 2020, he made between $591,950 and $1.5 million from Energystems, a coal brokerage company Manchin founded and ran, and had holdings of between $1.4 million and $5.8 million in coal companies, OpenSecrets found.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"a59b93f862b411ec96f01ba834190620"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a59b93f862b411ec96f01ba834190620"}},
