The pole-sitter has won in Abu Dhabi the last six years, including Verstappen's victory last season when he led all 55 laps around the yacht-filled marina.\", \"He refused to presume his pole-winning run guaranteed he would dethrone Hamilton's run of four consecutive titles and become F1's first Dutch world champion.\", \"\\\"I just need to focus on what we can control as a team.\\\"\", \"Hamilton on Sunday will attempt to win a record eighth championship to break a tie with Michael Schumacher. Hamilton and Verstappen are tied in the standings \\u2014 the first time since 1974 that contenders were even going into the deciding race.\", \"He liked his chances.\", \"Hamilton could ultimately still have the advantage because of Verstappen's mistake.\", \"After Verstappen flat-spotted his medium tires in Q2, Red Bull changed to soft tires and will start Sunday's race on rubber that won't be as durable as the mediums for Hamilton and Mercedes.\", \"\\\"The lockup wasn't ideal, that kind of forced our hand,\\\" Red Bull boss Christian Horner said during qualifying.\", \"But neither he or his driver were worried.\", \"\\\"I wanted to try to start on the mediums but I flat-spotted,\\\" Verstappen said.\", \"\\\"But I felt good on the soft so it's not really a difficult decision to make and then just say 'OK'.\\\"\", \"Lando Norris for McLaren was a surprise third \\u2014 beating out both Verstappen and Hamilton's teammates. Perez was fourth for Red Bull, followed by Carlos Sainz of Ferrari and at last Hamilton's outgoing Mercedes teammate Valtteri Bottas in a disappointing sixth.\", \"Australia's Daniel Ricciardo will start from 10th on the grid after setting a time of 1:23.409, 1.3 seconds behind Verstappen.\", \"Norris said he would have the best seat in the marina come Sunday.\", \"\\\"I'm very excited to see everything unfold, to see what goes on,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"It's just a genuine pleasure to be in this position to see everything that's been going on this season between Max and Lewis and to watch the battles and to watch the racing.\\\"\", \"Hamilton was loudly booed by a sold-out crowd packed with Verstappen fans.\", \"The British driver shrugged off the reception, noting \\\"there's a lot of (Dutch) orange here\\\", but acknowledged \\\"you're always surprised by the boos no matter how many times you experience it.\", \"\\\"But I don't care, it doesn't make a difference to me,\\\" he said.\", \"Hamilton won three consecutive races to slice all 19 points off Verstappen's hold on the championship going into the finale and this title fight has been likened to both James Hunt vs. Niki Lauda in 1976 and Ayrton Senna vs. Alain Prost in 1990.\", \"But Hamilton has been involved in his own tense battles before, including a one-point victory over Felipe Massa for his first championship in 2008 and a five-point loss to teammate Nico Rosberg in 2016.
