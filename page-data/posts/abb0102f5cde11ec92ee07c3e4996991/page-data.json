It could be distributed and administered without the logistical hurdles facing other treatments like monoclonal antibodies, which must be injected by a provider.\\u00a0\", \"The company says it has submitted its new data to the Food and Drug Administration, which Pfizer's CEO has said was waiting for Paxlovid's final results to decide whether to grant emergency use authorization for the pills.\\u00a0\", \"Another oral antiviral pill called molnupiravir, developed by Merck and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics, had initially shown promising results in early data from its trials suggesting it halved the risk of hospitalization or death. But later results announced by the company from its final data found a modest risk reduction of only 30%.\\u00a0\", \"Molnupiravir's smaller-than-expected efficacy and worries over its risks dampened enthusiasm over that pill, which received a narrow backing by the FDA's outside advisers last month and has yet to be greenlighted by regulators. Some advisers urged the FDA to grant authorization for molnupiravir only until \\\"an alternative agent comes along with better efficacy and fewer safety concerns.\\\"\", \"Unlike molnupiravir, Pfizer's executives have said they do not expect Paxlovid to go before the FDA's advisers, arguing their large efficacy and low safety risks were more comparable to the monoclonal antibody treatments the FDA has authorized without the advisory panel's input.\\u00a0\", \"In both their trials, Pfizer said adverse events occurred at comparable rates between Paxlovid and the placebo.\", \"\\\"We don't think that there is at all the same type of risk for these drugs and, as anticipated, the tolerability profile was very good,\\\" Pfizer's Dr. Mikael Dolsten said at a recent conference with investors hosted by Wolfe Research.\", \"Pfizer says Paxlovid will come as a set of three pills \\u2013 two tablets of nirmatrelvir and and one tablet of ritonavir \\u2013\\u00a0 taken together twice a day over the course of five days, soon after the first sign of infection.\\u00a0\", \"The Biden administration ordered a total 10 million courses of Paxlovid for Americans, the company said last month. Pfizer's CEO told The Wall Street Journal earlier this month that he expected they would only have a portion of Paxlovid's supply available to ship by the end of this year.\", \"\\\"If it is approved and we have it, it could be the next day. We will not have millions this month. We will have thousands. We will have hundreds of thousands in January. We will have millions in the first quarter,\\\" said Bourla.\\u00a0\", \"CBS News reporter covering public health and the pandemic.\"]","href_hash":"abb0102f5cde11ec92ee07c3e4996991"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"abb0102f5cde11ec92ee07c3e4996991"}},
