Byatt\\u2019s fiction, in the years since her best-selling and Booker Prize-winning novel \\u201cPossession\\u201d (1990), has been increasingly ornate, humorless, freighted with fantasy and myth, and encrusted with heavy literary reference. All my least favorite things in fiction, helpfully confined to one area.\", \"Byatt has a book out this month, \\u201cMedusa\\u2019s Ankles: Selected Stories.\\u201d I hadn\\u2019t read her in a long time, so I picked it up. Surely, it\\u2019s time to consider her anew. Clear eyes, full heart, let\\u2019s go.\", \"These neo-Jamesian stories were written across three decades. The first appeared in 1982; the last in 2013. Nearly all found good homes. Three were published in The New Yorker. The longest, \\u201cThe Djinn in the Nightingale\\u2019s Eye\\u201d \\u2014 at nearly 100 pages, it\\u2019s practically a novella \\u2014 ran in The Paris Review.\", \"Byatt has been an articulate advocate, alongside writers as varied as Italo Calvino, Angela Carter, Donald Barthelme, Salman Rushdie and, most recently, Karen Russell, for tapping the depths of fairy tales, for sounding the most primitive of stories for resonance.\", \"In a Paris Review interview, conducted in 2001, Byatt commented: \\u201cThere was a wonderful moment of liberation when I realized I could write tales that came out of my childhood love of myth and fairy stories, rather than out of a dutiful sense of \\u2018I ought to describe the provincial young man coming up from Sheffield and how he can\\u2019t cope with the aristocracy in London.\\u2019 Anybody would rather write about a princess who had to live in the snow.\\u201d\", \"That\\u2019s a striking paragraph, even though a straw man (Sheffield?) walks beside the cold princess. The awkward thing is that Byatt\\u2019s fiction has become less convincing than her arguments.\", \"She\\u2019s less fierce than Carter, who once began a story, \\u201cMy father lost me to the Beast at cards.\\u201d She\\u2019s less playful than the minimalist Barthelme, and less liquidly philosophical than Iris Murdoch. She seems, most of the time, to be writing with a quill under a prism-fringed chandelier.\", \"\\u201cAll English stories get bogged down in whether or not the furniture is socially and aesthetically acceptable,\\u201d Byatt writes. Not hers.\", \"The princess story \\u2014 its title is \\u201cCold\\u201d \\u2014 is here. This delicate young woman marries a desert prince who, fearing she\\u2019ll melt in the staring sun, builds for her an underground palace made of spun glass. A story titled \\u201cDragons\\u2019 Breath\\u201d is about enormous wormlike creatures, shades of \\u201cDune,\\u201d that slide down a mountain, sucking down unlucky goats and duck ponds and flattening the houses in their path.\", \"\\u201cHeavenly Bodies\\u201d is about a singer named Lucy Furnix and a tycoon named Brad Macmamman. Lucy, or her avatar, is turned into a glowing \\u201cskywoman\\u201d with \\u201csoftly heaving breasts\\u201d and \\u201charem pants\\u201d who fills the night sky. The world gawks. This kind of thing is bound to give Grimes and Elon Musk, and their marriage counselor, ideas; at least until Lucy is ripped apart by more venerable heavenly bodies.\", \"\\u201cThe Djinn in the Nightingale\\u2019s Eye\\u201d is about a middle-age woman, a \\u201cnarratologist\\u201d named Gillian, who uncorks an antique-shop bottle and, shazam, finds a handsome genie in her hotel room. The genie does Helmut Kohl and Donald Duck imitations, makes fresh figs appear and grants her three wishes.\", \"Their lovemaking \\u2014 \\u201cGillian seemed to swim across his body forever like a dolphin in an endless green sea, so that she became arching tunnels under mountains through which he pierced and rushed, or caverns in which he lay curled like dragons\\u201d \\u2014 is for the ages, and sounds very good when read aloud to pan flute music.\", \"Other stories fly a bit closer to earth, though rarely do you sense you\\u2019re reading about beings you might care about, or that anything at all is at stake. They\\u2019re top-heavy, forced in a hothouse.\", \"There are many stories within stories. If such stories were good, they wouldn\\u2019t be inside a different one. While reading, I frequently glanced at my wife across the room and made that brilliant new international hand signal that means \\u201chelp me.\\u201d\", \"A human theme does emerge from this book. Byatt is a perceptive writer about aging, about what it\\u2019s like to feel like you\\u2019re disappearing, like Homer Simpson into that hedge, from the brighter world.\", \"Men as well as women have this pang. Jim Harrison put it best: \\u201cOnce you\\u2019re over 50 they\\u201d \\u2014 women \\u2014 \\u201cjust look over your head as if you were a janitor.\\u201d\", \"The reason to buy this book \\u2014 well, to borrow it \\u2014 is for the title story. It\\u2019s about Susannah, a translator in late middle age, who has won an award and needs to appear on television. She goes to her salon for a cut and a blow-dry.\", \"Byatt is superb on the whole experience. The strangeness of the salon owner\\u2019s belt and haunches grazing Susannah\\u2019s face while he moves and she sits. Her memories of her hair, once \\u201clong and straight and heavy, a chestnut-glossy curtain.\\u201d It has become \\u201ca kind of frizzed fur.\\u201d\", \"Best line: \\u201cShe came to trust him with her disintegration.\\u201d\", \"The story keeps getting better. The owner unwittingly begins to insult her. He doesn\\u2019t want, he complains, \\u201cto put the best years of my life into making suburban old dears presentable.\\u201d Byatt keeps ratcheting up the tension.\", \"When the explosion comes, it is worth the wait. You no longer sense you\\u2019re reading treacle written in high diction, and that the only smoke is like that from the nostrils of a cartoon bull.\"]","href_hash":"5eff2e42464811ec994a95d561874347"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5eff2e42464811ec994a95d561874347"}},
