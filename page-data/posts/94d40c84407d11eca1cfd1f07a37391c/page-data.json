Unvaccinated Americans and children under the age of 18 are exempt from the requirement, but must take a test within one day of travel.\", \"The shift has come in time for the holiday season, when the beleaguered tourism industry is eagerly awaiting an influx in international visitors, especially in popular big-city destinations like New York, Los Angeles and Miami. The extended ban on travel from 33 countries \\u2014 including European Union members, China, India and Iran \\u2014 devastated the sector and resulted in losses of nearly $300 billion in visitor spending and more than one million American jobs, according to the U.S. Travel Association.\", \"\\u201cMonday begins in earnest the return of international travel, when long-separated families and friends can safely reunite, travelers can explore this amazing country, and the U.S. is able to reconnect with the global community,\\u201d said Roger Dow, the Association\\u2019s president and chief executive officer. \\u201cIt is a monumental day for travelers, for the communities and businesses that rely on international visitation, and for the U.S. economy overall.\\u201d\", \"Airlines saw a big spike in online searches and ticket bookings for international travel \\u2014 particularly from Europe and Latin America \\u2014 after the administration announced its plans to ease the travel restrictions in September.\", \"American Airlines said bookings over the three days after the announcement were up 66 percent for flights between Britain and the United States, 40 percent for those from Europe and 74 percent for Brazil, compared to a similar period a week earlier. United Airlines said that it sold more tickets for trans-Atlantic flights in the days after the announcement than during a similar period in 2019, a first since the pandemic began.\", \"Delta Air Lines said that many of its international flights on Monday were fully booked. The carrier\\u2019s first flight into the United States under the looser restrictions, DL106, is expected to arrive from S\\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, at 9:35 a.m. on Monday, in Atlanta. By the end of Monday, Delta expects to fly 139 mostly full planes from 38 countries into the U.S.\", \"Hotels across the country, particularly those in cities, also felt the impact of the reopening announcement, with increased bookings and interest over the holiday season. Hyatt, the hotel group, said that approximately 50 percent of its bookings by international travelers to the U.S. for the week of Nov. 8 came after the date was announced in mid-October, with travelers flocking to top cities.\", \"The chef Daniel Boulud, who owns several restaurants in New York City, said that customers from overseas had already started to call for reservations or to go on a waiting list.\", \"He added that while his restaurants were already \\u201cquite busy,\\u201d buoyed by domestic tourism and a trickle of international visitors, \\u201cthe faucet was not open for tourism yet.\\u201d International tourists, he said, will bring necessary foot traffic, in particular to his restaurants near the Theater District.\", \"Many of the airplanes departing for the United States over the coming weeks will be full of travelers reuniting with family and friends after more than a year apart. Felicity Fowler, a retired homeopath from London, missed the birth of her grandson. He was born in New York in April; she hasn\\u2019t seen her daughter, his mother, since February 2020 .\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s been emotional torture to be so far away from my girl at a time when she has needed me the most,\\u201d she said in an interview. \\u201cWe need to make up for lost time.\\u201d\", \"While demand is up, the changes have not had a major immediate effect on the number of scheduled international flights. In the first week under the relaxed rules, airlines will operate an average 1,390 daily flights into the United States, up just 35 daily flights from the week before, according to figures from Cirium, an aviation data provider. The data does not, however, indicate how many seats have been sold per flight and the number of daily flights is expected to rise again, by 40, in the second week after reopening.\", \"With the continued risks of coronavirus variants and uncertainty of the course of the pandemic, the U.S. Travel Association does not expect international inbound travel to recover to 2019 levels until at least 2024.\"]","href_hash":"94d40c84407d11eca1cfd1f07a37391c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"94d40c84407d11eca1cfd1f07a37391c"}},
