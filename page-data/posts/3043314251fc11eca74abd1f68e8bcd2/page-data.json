Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, signaled that the central bank is growing more wary of high \\u2014 and stubborn \\u2014 inflation, and that it could speed up its plan to withdraw economic support as soon as its meeting in December as it tries to make sure that rapid price gains do not last.\", \"The Fed had been buying $120 billion in government-backed securities each month for much of the pandemic to bolster the economy by keeping money flowing in financial markets. In November, officials announced plans to slow those purchases by $15 billion per month. That would have ended the program midway through 2022. But Mr. Powell signaled on Tuesday that the process could speed up, cutting down on how much juice the Fed will add to demand in upcoming months.\", \"\\u201cAt this point, the economy is very strong, and inflationary pressures are high,\\u201d Mr. Powell said during a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee. \\u201cIt is therefore appropriate in my view to consider wrapping up the taper of our asset purchases, which we actually announced at our November meeting, perhaps a few months sooner.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Powell said that the Fed will discuss slowing bond purchase faster \\u201cat our upcoming meeting in a couple of weeks\\u201d \\u2014 stressing that between now and then, the Fed will get a better sense of the new Omicron variant of the coronavirus, a fresh labor market report and a new reading on consumer price inflation.\", \"The Fed\\u2019s next two-day policy meeting will take place Dec. 14-15.\", \"Mr. Powell made it clear that it was too soon for Fed policymakers \\u2014 or anyone \\u2014 to tell how big the new variant\\u2019s impact will be, since that will hinge on how easily it transmits and whether it causes more severe disease.\", \"\\u201cWhat I\\u2019m told by experts is that we\\u2019ll know quite a bit about those answers in about a month,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll know something, though, within a week or ten days.\\u201d\", \"For now, he said, \\u201cit\\u2019s a risk, it\\u2019s a risk to the baseline \\u2014 it\\u2019s not really baked into our forecasts.\\u201d\", \"The challenge that Omicron might pose hits at a complicated moment for policymakers. The economy has boomed back this year, and hot demand has collided with choked supply chains to push inflation sharply higher. The central bank has been working toward removing its economic help as price gains remain stubbornly high, reorienting its policy so that it can raise rates next year if that is necessary to keep rising costs in check as inflation proves more stubborn than officials had hoped.\", \"\\u201cGenerally, the higher prices we\\u2019re seeing are related to the supply and demand imbalances that can be traced directly back to the pandemic and the reopening of the economy, but it\\u2019s also the case that price increases have spread much more broadly in the recent few months,\\u201d Mr. Powell said Tuesday. \\u201cI think the risk of higher inflation has increased.\\u201d\", \"If the new variant continues to roil supply chains even as it keeps workers at home and prevents a full labor market recovery, it could put the Fed in a tough spot. Central bank policymakers are supposed to foster both full employment and keep prices stable.\"]","href_hash":"3043314251fc11eca74abd1f68e8bcd2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3043314251fc11eca74abd1f68e8bcd2"}},
