He said history provided sobering lessons of what happens when old certainties are upended.\", \"Back then, China was still a long way from rivalling the US, and Kupchan was less focused on the Beijing threat than America's willingness and capacity to helm a global order.

He has shown that he will intimidate nations and use trade as both a lure and a weapon.\", \"What does a Pax Sinica look like? Well, certainly no commitment to universal standards of human rights. China does not seek alliances so much as transactions. Hence projects like the massive Belt and Road Initiative and infrastructure and investment push spanning 70 countries that by 2040 is projected to boost global GDP by seven trillion dollars a year.\", \"China promises the world what it promises its own people: we can make you rich, we don't care to make you free.\", \"The Beijing consensus would be less about interfering with other countries' internal issues than influencing outcomes that suit China.

He said we have to ask what the cost of war would be. If the world wants to maintain a global order, White argued, then war is not the answer.\", \"As he warned: \\\"Once war starts that order would probably be utterly destroyed.\\\" But his answer is not to confront China.
