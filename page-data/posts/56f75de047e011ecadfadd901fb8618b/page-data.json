Some questioned whether the \\\"cure\\\" would be worse than the virus, pointing to increases in drug and alcohol use, and in the first year of the pandemic, drug overdose deaths nationwide increased by almost 30 percent, topping 100,000 for the first time.\", \"South Dakota saw the largest percentage decline in reported deaths, at about 19 percent, going from 95 in April 2020 to 77 in April 2021, according to preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Noem was one of seven governors to not order schools or businesses to close during the pandemic, although several executive orders made recommendations to residents and businesses to modify their behaviors.\", \"\\\"We gave people the flexibility to go about their lives. We respected them,\\\" Noem posted on Twitter in July when data about December 2019 to December 2020 overdose deaths was released.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1934841/kristi-noem-drug-overdose-deaths-covid.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem attributed the decline in overdose deaths in her state to her decision to keep the state open during the pandemic.

The pandemic left many people feeling socially isolated, out of work, and in some cases, unable to obtain care because of the potential for the virus to spread.\", \"Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse, told The New York Times that people who struggle with addiction and those in recovery are prone to relapse. The pandemic heightening people's mental health disorders fueled an already growing health crisis.\", \"While South Dakota's decline in drug overdose deaths lends itself to the belief that staying open prevented harmful effects to people's mental health, the data shows a bit of a mixed bag.\", \"Along with South Dakota, New Jersey, New Hampshire and Delaware also saw decreases in opioid deaths, although not nearly on as big a scale. All three states, which saw declines ranging from about 1 percent to 7 percent, implemented stay-at-home orders, shut down businesses and reduced people's movements to \\\"essential\\\" needs.\", \"Implementing mitigation measures in some places also meant delaying treatment for people struggling with addiction. While rehabilitation facilities aren't at the same heightened risk as nursing homes, communal living facilities, where people share rooms and common spaces, present particular challenges at preventing outbreaks.\", \"\\\"It's hard to underestimate the effects of the pandemic on the community with opioid use disorder,\\\" Dr. Caleb Alexander, a professor of epidemiology and medicine at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health told Kaiser Health News in July 2020. \\\"The pandemic has profoundly disrupted the drug markets. Normally that would drive more people to treatment. Yet treatment is harder to come by.\\\"\", \"Just as states with strict COVID-19 measures weren't guaranteed to see an uptick in overdose deaths, the same was true for those who were relatively lenient in their policies.\", \"Iowa, Florida, Wyoming, Texas and Alaska were among the states with the fewest COVID-19 restrictions as of April 6, according to WalletHub. However, Texas and Alaska had significantly high increases in deaths, at more than 30 percent, followed by Florida at 26 percent and then Iowa and Wyoming at less than 20 percent.\", \"Experts suggest that it's possible some people also turned to drugs to cope with the anxiety of the pandemic and the loss of loved ones, indicating that people's personal connection to COVID-19 may have helped fuel overdose deaths, along with lockdowns.\", \"The most recent numbers prompted experts and lawmakers to call for people to address the drug epidemic in the country and work to curb deaths. For many, that includes increasing access to lifesaving medications and cracking down on drug cartels who transport fentanyl.\"]","href_hash":"56f75de047e011ecadfadd901fb8618b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"56f75de047e011ecadfadd901fb8618b"}},
