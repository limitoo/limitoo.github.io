Shortly before nightfall on Nov. 30, his sonar device showed that his boat was floating above a car-shaped object. He spent the night in his van, then dived to identify the car\\u2019s make and license plate number first thing the next morning. It was a match for Erin\\u2019s missing Pontiac.\", \"Mr. Sides documented the discovery in a 20-minute YouTube video that includes his phone call to Steve Page, the sheriff of White County, to report the findings. In the video, the sheriff meets Mr. Sides at the site and expresses his thanks: \\u201cYou just became White County\\u2019s hero.\\u201d\", \"In a brief telephone interview, the sheriff said that divers recovered human remains on Thursday but they had not been positively identified. \\u201cWe do believe it\\u2019s them,\\u201d Sheriff Page said on Friday. \\u201cWe found articles that came out of the car and was in the water that leads us to believe it\\u2019s them.\\u201d\", \"Jeremy Bechtel\\u2019s father, Ron Bechtel, said that although the investigation was continuing, the authorities told him they now think Jeremy and Erin, who were 17 and 18 when they were last seen, were in a car accident.\", \"\\u201cIt was like losing him all over again,\\u201d Mr. Bechtel said in an interview on Thursday. \\u201cWe kind of had just had a thin bit of hope that he was still alive.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Bechtel, 57, said his son was a well-mannered teenager who loved rap music and \\u201chad a kind soul and a big heart.\\u201d Jeremy\\u2019s mother, Rhonda Ledbetter, died three years ago from cancer. \\u201cHis mother worried herself to death,\\u201d Mr. Bechtel said.\", \"After the car was discovered, friends of Jeremy\\u2019s and Erin\\u2019s families created online fund-raisers to help cover funeral costs.\", \"A Facebook page dedicated to the search for the teenagers included photos of the riverbank near where the car was discovered with a fresh bouquet of flowers and a plaque reading \\u201cE & J Gone Home.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Sides said that the number of divers investigating cold cases was growing, and that over the past two months there had been a particularly high rate of discoveries.\", \"Earlier in November, Mr. Sides found a car associated with a woman who had been missing since 2005, an hour away from Sparta, in Oakridge, Tenn. Also in November, a YouTube group called Chaos Divers reportedly found a car belonging to a couple from Ohio who had been missing for three and a half years.\", \"In late October, another YouTube group, Adventures With Purpose, found a body in a submerged vehicle in Texas. Mr. Sides assisted on that search.\", \"Mr. Sides, who dives full time, says he is able to pay for his expeditions, which require a boat, portable sonar equipment and diving gear, with money from YouTube, merchandise sales and donations. Diving in rivers and lakes is substantially different from ocean diving, he said.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s fun, but it\\u2019s definitely a claustrophobic feeling, because you can\\u2019t really see much more than two to three feet in front of your face,\\u201d Mr. Sides said. \\u201cIt freaks some people out pretty good.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Sides\\u2019s investigations begin on the Charley Project, an online database of missing persons cases. He reads through postings on the site and looks for cases in which a missing person was last seen in a car in an area with large bodies of water. He also looks up online memorials for more clues and potential contacts.\", \"Mr. Sides said \\u201che was a mixture of all the emotions you can think of\\u201d when he found Erin\\u2019s car.\", \"\\u201cI was sad then overwhelmed,\\u201d Mr. Sides said. \\u201cAt the end of the day I was joyful that I could bring closure to so many.\\u201d\", \"Michelle Jeanis, an assistant professor of criminal justice at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette whose research focuses on missing persons, said that grass-roots search efforts have always played an \\u201cintegral role\\u201d in resolving such cases. This is in part because police agencies often lack the resources or are unwilling to dedicate resources to older cold cases, she added.\", \"\\u201cGenerally, people are frustrated with the lack of progress police make, and so we get these organizations as a result of that,\\u201d Dr. Jeanis said.\", \"She said the risk is that \\u201carmchair detectives\\u201d get caught up in the case and sensationalize it, which could harm the investigation by, for instance, overwhelming the police with tips that they start to ignore. She also said that inexperienced divers exploring rivers and lakes to investigate a case could be putting themselves in danger.\", \"Michael Alcazar, a retired detective with the New York Police Department, said he was concerned that amateur sleuths could tamper with important evidence, but in a cold case such as the Tennessee disappearances, it could be helpful to have outsiders assist.\", \"\\u201cSometimes these agencies, especially the smaller agencies, they just don\\u2019t have the manpower and maybe the cases have gone cold and they can\\u2019t continue the investigation,\\u201d Mr. Alcazar said. \\u201cEspecially something as old as this case, it\\u2019s probably just sitting in a file cabinet.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6e27ce8159e711ec9cd9d9c1f84dbad9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6e27ce8159e711ec9cd9d9c1f84dbad9"}},
