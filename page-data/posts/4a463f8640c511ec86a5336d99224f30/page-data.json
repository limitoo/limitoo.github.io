The new rules require travelers to show proof of vaccination and a negative COVID-19 test in order to enter the U.S. Anyone crossing land borders into the U.S. from Mexico or Canada must show proof of vaccination, but no negative test is required, AP reported.\", \"The changes have spurred airlines to make preparations for an anticipated rise in the number of people making travel plans.

Grandmas will coo over grandsons who have doubled in age since they last saw them. Aunts and uncles and cousins will snuggle babies they haven't met yet.\", \"\\\"I'm going to jump into his arms, kiss him, touch him,\\\" Gaye Camara said of the husband in New York she has not seen since before COVID-19 brought the fly-here-there-and-everywhere world to a halt.\", \"\\\"Just talking about it makes me emotional,\\\" Camara, 40, said as she wheeled her luggage through Paris' Charles de Gaulle airport, which could almost be mistaken for its pre-pandemic self, busy with humming crowds, albeit in face masks.\", \"When Camara last saw Mamadou, her husband, in January 2020, they had no way of knowing that they'd have to wait 21 months before holding each other again. She lives in France's Alsace region, where she works as a secretary. He is based in New York.\", \"\\\"It was very hard at the beginning. I cried nearly every night,\\\" she said.\", \"Video calls, text messages, phone conversations kept them connected\\u2014but couldn't fill the void of separation.\", \"\\\"I cannot wait,\\\" she said. \\\"Being with him, his presence, his face, his smile.\\\"\", \"In a sign of the huge importance of trans-Atlantic travel for airlines, British Airways and Virgin Atlantic celebrated the reopening by synchronizing the departures of their early-morning flights to New York on parallel runways at London's Heathrow Airport.

Some things are more important than one-upmanship, and this is one of those things,\\\" Doyle wrote in a message to customers, noting that the flight carried the number that used to belong to the supersonic Concorde.\", \"For Martine Kerherve, being separated from loved ones in the United States was filled with worries that they might not survive the pandemic that has killed more than 5 million people worldwide.\", \"\\\"We told ourselves that we could die without seeing each other,\\\" said Kerherve, who was heading for Fort Lauderdale, Florida, from Paris. \\\"We all went through periods of depression, anxiety.\\\"\", \"Before the pandemic, it was a trip Kerherve and her partner, Francis Pasquier, would make once or twice a year.
