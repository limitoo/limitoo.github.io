Crew members allegedly called the gun \\\"cold\\\" without checking to see if it was loaded. Several crew members had previously walked off the set, leaving a non-unionized replacement crew that was reportedly unaware of the protocols surrounding the use of prop guns.\", \"Rust's armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, said in a statement through her attorney that she did \\\"everything in her power\\\" to ensure the set would remain safe.

Around 200 Hollywood cinematographers have signed a letter asking for the film industry to completely ban \\\"functional firearms\\\" on movie sets.\", \"In the letter, they wrote that they would not knowingly work on projects using functional firearms. \\\"We won't sit back and wait for the industry to change. We have a duty to affect change within the industry ourselves,\\\" the letter read.\", \"Los Angeles City Councilman Paul Koretz introduced legislation in October that would ban the use of live firearms in Hollywood productions.\", \"\\\"The clear solution is banishing live guns and ammunition from the sets of television and motion picture productions to eliminate all possibility of human error in the handling of weapons so that flawless oversight and restrictions guarantee that these kinds of accidents never happen again,\\\" Koretz said during a city council meeting.\", \"A change.org petition calling on the ban of real firearms on set has been signed more than 111,000 times as of Monday afternoon.\", \"An investigation into the shooting continues. Charges have not been filed, though legal commentator Nancy Grace has said Baldwin could be charged with \\\"negligent homicide.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"45a15a6740c511ec86a5336d99224f30"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"45a15a6740c511ec86a5336d99224f30"}},
