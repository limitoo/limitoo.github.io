Your turkey\\u2019s thawing in the refrigerator, yes? It oughta be, if you bought a frozen one. Thursday\\u2019s coming fast, and you do not want to be the person emailing me on Thanksgiving morning to ask what to do with the brick-hard 20-pounder you just pulled out of the freezer. Dry brines start tomorrow!\", \"Is your Thanksgiving menu still in flux? Here are our best turkey recipes. And our favorite recipes for a vegetarian Sidesgiving.

We\\u2019ve got some ideas there, too: 40 easy recipes for the nights before Thanksgiving. I like sheet-pan chicken chilaquiles for that, and silken tofu with spicy soy dressing. Or maybe a mushroom and potato paprikash? (Here\\u2019s how to make that one in a pressure cooker.)\", \"And for breakfast on Thursday? I\\u2019ll probably make do with a cup of tea and a spoonful of cranberry sauce stirred into some yogurt. But blueberry muffins would be great. As would a big platter of scrambled eggs. You\\u2019ll probably miss lunch that day, in advance of the feast. So make your breakfast a substantial one. Most important meal of the day.\", \"Thousands and thousands more recipes for Thanksgiving and for every day are waiting for you on New York Times Cooking.
