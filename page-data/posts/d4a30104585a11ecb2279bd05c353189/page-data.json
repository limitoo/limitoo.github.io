The waitress\\u2013who has received an enormous amount of online praise in the last 48 hours\\u2013 was identified as Sondra Albert.\", \"In a conversation with The Post, Cozzolino, who is a frequent patron of the diner, claimed that the customer was \\\"staring at and trying to solicit his phone number\\\" to a group of underaged girls.\", \"He also accused the customer of \\\"going on a homophobic and sexist tirade,\\\" said the paper.\", \"Despite the several accusations thrown at him in the video, the man only tried to dispute one.\", \"\\\"I don't want to look at underage girls,\\\" he said. But Albert didn't back down.\", \"\\\"You're a pedophile and a freak and you deserve to be locked up at Bellevue,\\\" she responded.\", \"For context, Bellevue was the country's \\\"first public hospital,\\\" said the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) on its website.\", \"In addition to treating a variety of patients\\u2013from the \\\"disadvantaged and homeless\\\" to \\\"dignitaries and U.S. presidents\\\"\\u2013the hospital has also \\\"been at the forefront of advancements in American medicine,\\\" said the AAMC. However, many have long believed Bellevue to be a \\\"frightening\\\" psychiatric hospital.\", \"Speaking to AAMC about his book, Bellevue: Three Centuries of Medicine and Mayhem at America's Most Storied Hospital, David Oshinsky, PhD explained that his own mother used to threaten him with a trip to Bellevue whenever he would misbehave.\", \"\\\"When I was acting up, my mother would say, 'Keep it up, David, and you're on your way to Bellevue.' One of the largest misconceptions about Bellevue was certainly that it was a psychiatric hospital,\\\" Oshinsky said.\", \"In a second video posted by Cozzolino, Albert threatened to \\\"kick\\\" the customer's \\\"a**.\\\"\", \"\\\"The way you speak about people who are lesbians and young children ... oh you're so frigging full of s***,\\\" she told him.\", \"\\\"You're not wanted here, and all these kids will back me up, right guys?\\\" she asked as she turned to look towards Cozzolino and his friends. From behind the camera, someone said \\\"yeah,\\\" and Albert continued to tell the man that he was \\\"not wanted\\\" at the diner.\", \"Viewers flooded the first video's comments section to express their appreciation for Albert.\", \"\\\"May her time off request always be fulfilled and her car always run safely,\\\" wrote Atlas.\", \"\\\"May all her future tables tip nothing less than 10 dollar bills,\\\" added Of Lilies and Remains.\", \"Brice Hounshel commented: \\\"As someone who was routinely harassed by men at 16 when I worked at a diner while my manager did nothing about it, thank you!!!!\\\"\", \"\\\"Not all heroes wear capes but a lot of them wear aprons,\\\" said liv.\", \"Rachel Mohre replied: \\\"[On] behalf of all servers [and] service industry staff like myself ... she's our hero now.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947934/tiktok.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A video that shows a waitress confronting a \\u201crude\\u201d customer has gone viral.
