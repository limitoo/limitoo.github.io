I was a very strange child.\\u201d\", \"Though she\\u2019s best known for teen dramas like \\u201cPretty Little Liars\\u201d and the short-lived \\u201cRiverdale\\u201d spinoff, \\u201cKaty Keene,\\u201d her new venture into the macabre sees her starring as a recently recruited American detective \\u2014 Lake Edmunds \\u2014 tasked with tracking down a serial killer in London who sews parts of his victims\\u2019 dismembered bodies together into a grotesque creation referred to as \\u201cthe Ragdoll.\\u201d The six-part series is based on Daniel Cole\\u2019s 2017 novel.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve never played a detective,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut I had written in journals that I had wanted to play a character like this, so it definitely felt natural.\\u201d\", \"In a Zoom audio call from her home in Los Angeles earlier this month, Hale shared her admiration for Lucille Ball and \\u201cForensic Files,\\u201d and explained why Graceland is her happy place. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"1. \\u201cGrease\\u201d\", \"Everyone always asks me, \\u201cWhere did you get the bug for performing?\\u201d And it goes back to sitting on my grandmother\\u2019s living room table. She put on \\u201cGrease\\u201d for the first time when I was 6 or 7, and I was hypnotized. I\\u2019ve probably seen the movie 100 times, and even as an adult, I still enjoy it the way I did when I was a little kid \\u2014 the music, the chemistry between John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John, the hair and the makeup. I heard a rumor that they\\u2019re remaking it \\u2014 I\\u2019ll keep an open mind, but it\\u2019s so classic.\", \"2. The Pattern App\", \"I first heard about it a couple of years ago when Channing Tatum posted about it on Instagram, and it\\u2019s now the most-used app on my phone. You type in the city where you were born, your name, your birth date, your birth year and the time of day. Then it calculates a birth chart for you, which is almost like a personality reading. It\\u2019s the most accurate one I\\u2019ve ever read. If you\\u2019re dating someone new, you can plug in their information and then compare how you guys are similar or different. It also gives you reminders; I checked mine first thing this morning, and it says I identify with being the giver in my relationships, and I derive my self-worth and identity from being the provider. And so today, my reminder is that I need to be sure to check in with myself.\", \"3. The Rose Bowl Flea Market\", \"Imagine the Rose Bowl, but with thousands and thousands and thousands of people with suitcases ready to buy vintage items. It\\u2019s incredible. It happens the second Sunday of every month at the Rose Bowl Stadium in Pasadena, and you have to get there at like 6 or 7 a.m. to find parking. There are hundreds of vendors; they have a clothing section categorized by era, and there\\u2019s an amazing vendor who has the most beautiful turquoise jewelry I\\u2019ve ever seen. You definitely have to devote a day to it, and you have to be willing to dig and be patient.\", \"4. \\u201cJagged Little Pill\\u201d by Alanis Morissette\", \"This was the first album that I bought with my own money. I remember seeing the cover for the first time when I was really young, in vivid red and green and blue with her hair blowing everywhere. I would have been around 7, so I was too young to understand the angst. But I would put her CD in my boombox, and I just loved the tone of her voice \\u2014 the honesty and the passion.\", \"5. \\u201cI Love Lucy\\u201d Reruns\", \"There will never be anyone like Lucille Ball. She was big and bold and not afraid to make crazy faces and be physical, be wild and wacky. During that time, that just wasn\\u2019t what a lot of women entertainers were doing \\u2014 she\\u2019s truly a comedic genius. And her and Ethel are one of my favorite duos of all time, so much so that I named my puppy for her. So we\\u2019re Lucy and Ethel. (I\\u2019m actually named after a grandmother of mine.)\", \"6. Ikoyi\", \"This is an African-inspired restaurant in London that was rated one of the top 50 restaurants in the world last year. I know about it because a friend\\u2019s brother, Jeremy [Chan], is the chef. I went there for the first time about a month ago, and it is, without a doubt, the most extraordinary culinary experience of my life. I\\u2019m just blown away by how people can think, like, \\u201cOh, this would taste great with this.\\u201d For instance, there was a really nice white fish with vanilla bean foam. And another dish with a paste on the side that he said was inspired by Warheads candy. All these out-there flavors, but it all seamlessly works together, and the presentation is truly art.\", \"7. Frances Berry\", \"Frances Berry is this extraordinary painter out of Memphis, where I\\u2019m from. A lot of her paintings are these gorgeous female bodies with wacky colors and stripes and different textures. But she also does these cool Pop Art paintings \\u2014 I have a custom Elvis Presley one here. A lot of her work is very feminist and supportive of women. She does sayings, like \\u201cSmokin\\u2019 Naked,\\u201d and then she has a female form with a cigarette. She\\u2019s just very cool \\u2014 she wears roller skates to do her art in.\", \"8. Graceland\", \"My grandmother was a huge Elvis Presley fan, as am I, and you definitely get a feel for the type of person he was walking through this home. There\\u2019s a room with like 10 TVs in it because he liked to watch different things at the same time, and there\\u2019s the animal room, which is all animal prints \\u2014 floor, ceiling, furniture. It\\u2019s just very \\u201970s, very tacky in the best way.\", \"9. \\u201cForensic Files\\u201d\", \"It was nighttime over 10 years ago, and I\\u2019m flicking through the channels, and I hear that creepy intro music \\u2014 the \\u201cForensic Files\\u201d theme song. I love the show because it\\u2019s not scripted \\u2014 it\\u2019s purely about how detectives find the people who do horrible things to people. There\\u2019s hundreds of episodes, and you can always find \\u201cForensic Files\\u201d on any given channel at nighttime. In a weird way, it\\u2019s like a comfort show for me.\", \"10. Yosemite National Park\", \"This is the place I go to when I feel like I need a break from everything. It\\u2019s five or six hours north of L.A., and for the last couple of years, I\\u2019ve taken these solo hiking trips there. You look at these waterfalls, and these mountains, and these cliffs, and it truly looks like a painting.\"]","href_hash":"eae39bd2475111ec9a916131872792cb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eae39bd2475111ec9a916131872792cb"}},
