Their latest, craziest conquest vanquished the reigning A.F.C. champion Kansas City in a second-half comeback that the good folks of southwestern Ohio and neighboring areas will hail for years.\", \"And the final score \\u2014 27-24, in overtime, secured on Evan McPherson\\u2019s 31-yard field goal \\u2014 will linger, too, on their tongues, numerical confirmation that the Bengals have played, yes, winning football. They tamed the cauldron of cacophony in Arrowhead Stadium to advance to the Super Bowl. Not since Ickey Woods shuffled and Boomer Esiason flung lefty passes and David Fulcher prowled the secondary, in the 1988 season, had Cincinnati reached the final game of the season.\", \"The group that returned the Bengals to that euphoric state is led by a cigar-smoking, Cartier-sunglasses-wearing quarterback who feels neither pressure nor pain. Joe Burrow led Cincinnati to 21 consecutive points, erasing a 21-3 deficit. Then he calmly took the Bengals downfield in overtime following Patrick Mahomes\\u2019s interception on the opening possession, after Kansas City had evened the score at 24-24 with a field goal as regulation expired.\", \"\\u201cIf you want to do the things that we want to do,\\u201d Burrow, who finished 23 of 38 for 250 yards, two touchdown passes and an interception, said last week of Kansas City, \\u201cthat\\u2019s the team you\\u2019re going to have to beat every single year.\\u201d\", \"Kansas City had dropped only one game since Halloween \\u2014 a 34-31 defeat to the Bengals in Cincinnati on Jan. 2 \\u2014 and precedent suggested that Sunday would proffer the opposite result. Over the last three years, it had won all five rematches against teams it lost to earlier in the season while scoring more than 39 points per game.\", \"The most recent payback occurred at this same venue last week, when Kansas City kindled an absurd comeback \\u2014 a three-play, 44-yard, 13-second field goal drive \\u2014 to tie Buffalo at the end of regulation before winning the divisional round game in overtime.\", \"As then, Kansas City won the overtime coin toss. But instead of driving for the clinching touchdown on Sunday, Mahomes, looking downfield for Tyreek Hill, threw an interception \\u2014 his second of the game \\u2014 that bounced off the hands of Hill and Cincinnati\\u2019s Jessie Bates III and into those of Bengals defensive back Vonn Bell.\", \"Taking over at the Bengals\\u2019 45-yard line, Burrow drove the Bengals deep into Kansas City territory, with McPherson \\u2014 who made all four of his field goal attempts against both Las Vegas and Tennessee in the previous rounds \\u2014 drilling his fourth long and true, sending his teammates spilling onto the field.\", \"Sunday\\u2019s game unfolded as if adhering to the basic template from the teams\\u2019 Week 17 meeting, with Mahomes flaunting his magnificent, improvisational and unstoppable version of football in the first half before the Bengals rediscovered their compass.\", \"And just as in that earlier game, Kansas City amassed a first-half lead that it eventually ceded. In the early-January meeting, Kansas City led by 14 points before succumbing, 34-31. On Sunday, Kansas City headed into halftime leading, 21-10, on three Mahomes touchdown passes. The margin could have been \\u2014 should have been? \\u2014 wider if not for both a curious play call and excellent tackling by Bengals cornerback Eli Apple.\", \"With five seconds left in the first half, no time outs and the ball at the Cincinnati 1-yard line, Coach Andy Reid, eschewing the close field-goal attempt, tried to blowtorch the Bengals out of commission. Mahomes flipped a pass to Tyreek Hill at the 5-yard line, and Apple \\u2014 after committing the pass-interference penalty that gave Kansas City the ball by the goal line \\u2014 preserved the 11-point deficit by standing him up.\", \"It was the first of six consecutive defensive stops by the Bengals, who converted the third into McPherson\\u2019s second field goal, and the fourth into the touchdown that evened the score at 21-21. \", \"In desperate times, Burrow knows he can turn to the Bengals\\u2019 best receiver \\u2014 his old pal from Louisiana State \\u2014 and with 14 seconds left in the third quarter he zipped a nifty back-shoulder toss to Ja\\u2019Marr Chase. Trent Taylor wiggled free off the line to catch the 2-point conversion.\", \"Last week, Burrow proclaimed his disgust with what he called the \\u201cunderdog narrative\\u201d surrounding the Bengals, demanding the team be taken seriously. Already he had changed the team\\u2019s slogan, to \\u201cIt Is Us\\u201d from \\u201cWhy Not Us?\\u201d, and his teammates agreed.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s not really the idea you want in your head when you step in the ring,\\u201d left tackle Jonah Williams said last week. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not, \\u2018Why can\\u2019t I knock this guy out?\\u2019 It\\u2019s, \\u2018I\\u2019m going to knock this guy out.\\u2019 It\\u2019s a much more powerful attitude to have.\\u201d\", \"The most unassailable truth in the N.F.L. these last three seasons had tended to manifest itself right around this time of year: No matter how Kansas City plays early in the season, and no matter how Kansas City plays in the middle of the season, and no matter how Kansas City plays late in the season, it ends the A.F.C. championship game at home, in rapture.\", \"It happened two years ago, and it happened last year, but not this year \\u2014 not on Sunday. The Bengals \\u2014 the Cincinnati Bengals \\u2014 knocked out mighty Kansas City and will play in the Super Bowl.\"]","href_hash":"b61feb14822811ecbbf03925e6080caf"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b61feb14822811ecbbf03925e6080caf"}},
