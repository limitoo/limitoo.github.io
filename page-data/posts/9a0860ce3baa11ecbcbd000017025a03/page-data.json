Refusing to acknowledge he could have lost Georgia because of the size of his rallies, Trump tried to convince Raffensperger that the number of fraudulent votes far outnumbered the nearly 12,000 ballots that gave President Joe Biden his victory in the state.\", \"\\\"There's turmoil in Georgia and other places,\\\" Trump said on phone, according to Raffensperger's book, Integrity Counts. \\\"You're not the only one, I mean. We have other states that I believe will be flipping to us very shortly.\\\"\", \"On the phone call, Trump claimed his team would provide accurate numbers in the future but estimated there were about 50,000 fraudulent ballots, although Trump acknowledged he only needed 11,779 to win the state.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1923819/donald-trump-brad-raffensperger-election-georgai.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Former President Donald Trump told Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger that he believed multiple states would be \\\"flipping\\\" to him after the presidential election.

The former president often uses the size of his rallies compared to Biden's as proof his support outnumbered his challenger, reiterating that it's \\\"just not possible to have lost Georgia.\\\"\", \"But Raffensperger sees Trump's comparison of rally attendees to voter turnout as a false equivalency.\", \"\\\"Many of those people who attended the rallies came from other states,\\\" Raffensperger wrote in the book. \\\"In the case of the rallies held during Georgia's Senate runoff, many people attended but didn't live in Georgia and couldn't vote in our runoff. So the attendance in those cases gives a misleading impression of actual Georgia voters.\\\"\", \"While Trump attempted to get Raffensperger to agree with him on the numbers, the secretary of state maintained that Trump lost the election, telling him that the \\\"data you have is wrong.\\\"\", \"Raffensperger's refusal to cite Trump as the rightful winner of the election sparked threats against himself and his family. One such threat included the message to \\\"please pray\\\" because the person plans \\\"for the death of you and your family every day,\\\" according to his book. Raffensperger called it \\\"unbelievable\\\" that people were threatening his family \\\"in the name of Jesus if we did not do their bidding.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"9a0860ce3baa11ecbcbd000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9a0860ce3baa11ecbcbd000017025a03"}},
