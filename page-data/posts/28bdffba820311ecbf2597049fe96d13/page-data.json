The woman made the claim in a post on her personal social media account that included images, video and an audio recording.\", \"United issued the first of two statements about Greenwood shortly after the woman\\u2019s post became a trending topic on social media. In its statement, the club said it was aware of the allegations against Greenwood but would not comment further until the facts had been established.\", \"A few hours later, and after the woman\\u2019s claims were removed from her account, the club issued a second statement in which it announced that it was temporarily sidelining Greenwood, a 20-year-old graduate of United\\u2019s academy and one of the brightest young English talents in the Premier League, the world\\u2019s richest domestic soccer league.\", \"\\u201cMason Greenwood will not return to training or play matches until further notice,\\u201d the team said.\", \"On Sunday evening, the Greater Manchester Police announced that they had been made aware of \\u201conline social media images and videos posted by a woman reporting incidents of physical violence,\\u201d a description that closely mirrored the public accusations against Greenwood and the swirl of publicity they had caused earlier in the day.\", \"The police confirmed that \\u201ca man in his 20s has since been arrested on suspicion of rape and assault\\u201d and that he remained in custody for questioning. In keeping with British police protocol, it did not name the man who was arrested.\", \"The images accusing Greenwood of assault were posted on Instagram on Sunday morning but disappeared, along with the rest of the images on the woman\\u2019s account, soon afterward. \", \"British and online news media outlets reported on Sunday that the police had visited Greenwood\\u2019s home on Sunday.\", \"Greenwood, a forward who started his first match for United as a 17-year-old and made his debut for England\\u2019s national team a month before his 20th birthday last fall, has been a mainstay on United\\u2019s team despite its faltering season, becoming a regular starter ahead of a group of more experienced forwards on the club\\u2019s roster. Last week, United announced that Anthony Martial, a French forward, and one of the players displaced by the emergence of Greenwood, had been loaned to Sevilla in Spain for the rest of the season.\", \"Greenwood made no public comments on the allegations on Sunday. Nike, one of his personal sponsors, said in a statement that it was \\u201cdeeply concerned by the disturbing allegations and will continue to closely monitor the situation.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"28bdffba820311ecbf2597049fe96d13"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"28bdffba820311ecbf2597049fe96d13"}},
