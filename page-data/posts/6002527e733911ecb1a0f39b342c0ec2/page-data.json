Lying awake in their tent at 4 a.m., he heard an odd chattering outside.\", \"\\u201cAnd I figured, Well, they\\u2019ve landed,\\u201d he told the story to an audience in 2009. But when he peered out the tent flap, it wasn\\u2019t extraterrestrials; it was a porcupine talking to itself.\", \"Mr. Staines died on Dec. 5 at his home in Rollinsford, N.H. He was 74.\", \"His wife said the cause was prostate cancer.\", \"Ms. Staines, who works in special education, said the song, which first appeared on Mr. Staines\\u2019s 1979 album, \\u201cThe Whistle of the Jay,\\u201d didn\\u2019t leap out at either of them as a career highlight.\", \"\\u201cWhen Bill wrote \\u2018P.I.C.\\u2019 and played it for me when I got home from school, we both shook our heads and said, \\u2018I don\\u2019t know if this is a keeper or not,\\u2019\\u201d she said by email. \\u201cObviously and luckily, we were wrong.\\u201d\", \"The song has been covered by Peter, Paul and Mary; Red Grammer; Tommy Makem and Liam Clancy; and many others. A rousing live performance by the Irish group Celtic Thunder on YouTube has been viewed over seven million times.\", \"\\u201cSongs are like children you care about,\\u201d Mr. Staines, who recorded almost 30 albums, told The Register of Yarmouth, Mass., in 2013. \\u201cYou write a song and it\\u2019s born and you have to nurture it awhile and it grows up healthy and strong and then it develops relationships with people who don\\u2019t have anything to do with you. \\u2018A Place in the Choir\\u2019 has a life of its own. It\\u2019s like a child that\\u2019s grown up and gone away.\\u201d\", \"William Russell Staines was born on Feb. 6, 1947, in Medford, Mass., to William Henry and Dorothy (Trask) Staines. He grew up in Lexington, Mass., and two boyhood friends, Dick and John Curtis, were the catalysts for his performing career.\", \"\\u201cWhen I was around 11, Dick got a guitar, so of course I had to get one,\\u201d Mr. Staines told The Patriot Ledger of Quincy, Mass., in 2018. \\u201cIt was a Sears Silvertone three-quarter-size guitar with a cowboy painted on it. I sanded the cowboy off the front, and Dick and John and I started a little rock \\u2019n\\u2019 roll band, with contact pickups on our acoustic guitars.\\u201d\", \"Before long, he had gone solo and begun writing his own songs, upgrading to a full-size guitar, which he played in an unusual way: upside-down.\", \"\\u201cWhen I got my first guitar, I picked it up and held it the correct way, the right-handed way,\\u201d he told the Quincy newspaper. \\u201cBut I\\u2019m left-handed and it just didn\\u2019t feel right. So I flipped it over and figured this must be the left-handed way of playing. You know, a D chord is still a D chord, so I just had to get to it differently.\\u201d\", \"That approach gave his picking a somewhat different sound, since he was hitting the high strings with his thumb. At least one fellow guitarist was impressed.\", \"\\u201cAbout four years ago I met this fellow in California who was a wonderful guitar player, who said, \\u2018I really like the way your style sounds,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Staines told The Wenatchee World of Washington State in 2009. \\u201cAnd I saw him a year ago, and he\\u2019d went out and bought a left-handed guitar and was playing it right-handed. So that\\u2019s even one step to the weirder.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Staines wrote countless songs. Many evoked the natural world, like \\u201cRiver,\\u201d one of his best known, with its wistful refrain:\", \"You rolling old river, you changing old river,Let\\u2019s you and me, river, run down to the sea.\", \"Others were character sketches \\u2014 \\u201cpensive, probing narratives made especially memorable by their ability to translate the common details of common lives into songs of uncommon eloquence and beauty,\\u201d as L.E. McCullough put it in The Austin American-Statesman in 1986. There was, for instance, \\u201cThe Roseville Fair,\\u201d about a couple\\u2019s first meeting and their enduring love. Among those who covered the tune was Nanci Griffith, who called Mr. Staines \\u201cthe Woody Guthrie of my generation of songwriters.\\u201d Ms. Griffith, who died in August, credited Mr. Staines with encouraging her in her own career.\", \"Mr. Staines, an old-school troubadour who traveled tens of thousands of miles every year to perform, started out in coffee shops and other small venues. Early in his career, he was M.C. of the Sunday hootenanny at the famed Club 47 in Cambridge, Mass.\", \"He was still a road warrior half a century later. His most recent album, in 2018, was called \\u201cThe Third Million Miles.\\u201d\", \"In addition to Ms. Staines, whom he married in 1976, Mr. Staines is survived by a son, Bowen Keith Staines, and a brother, Stephen.\", \"Mr. Staines had another talent: yodeling. He sometimes gave workshops on the skill. In 1975, he won a yodeling contest at the Kerrville Folk Festival in Texas \\u2014 \\u201cdefeating some crestfallen Swiss yodelers,\\u201d The Christian Science Monitor reported.\"]","href_hash":"6002527e733911ecb1a0f39b342c0ec2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6002527e733911ecb1a0f39b342c0ec2"}},
