Importantly, the verifier app does not store a person's data or see any information other than a person's name and date of birth.\\\"\", \"He said some companies would also integrate the technology into things like ticketing processes.\", \"Essential services like supermarkets, pharmacies and health and disability services cannot use the passes.
