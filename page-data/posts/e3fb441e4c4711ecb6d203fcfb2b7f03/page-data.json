I\\u2019m a programmer,\\u201d Mr. Lessig recalls her protesting, horrified by the idea.\", \"Now, the notion that \\u201ccode is law\\u201d\\u2014 from Mr. Lessig\\u2019s 1999 book \\u201cCode and Other Laws of Cyberspace\\u201d \\u2014 does not shock young engineers or lawyers, the professor says. To digital natives it is \\u201cobvious\\u201d that technology dictates behavior with rules that are not value neutral.\", \"Big tech companies have reluctantly admitted the same, with Meta, the social media company formerly known as Facebook, going as far as establishing a courtlike board of experts to evaluate decisions dictated in part by programming. And one relatively young sector of tech \\u2014 the cryptocurrency industry \\u2014 has embraced the concept of \\u201ccode as law\\u201d wholeheartedly, with some companies explicitly arguing that code can be a better arbitrator than traditional regulators.\", \"Many crypto fans are betting on a future where we bank, create, play, work and trade on platforms with code running the show, and in the booming decentralized finance (DeFi) sector, automated \\u201csmart contracts\\u201d that are programmed in advance to respond to specific sets of conditions already handle billions of dollars in transactions daily, with no need for human intervention, at least theoretically.\", \"Users put their full faith in programming. No one shares personal information. Code does it all and is supposed to be the whole of the law. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no human judgment. There\\u2019s no human error. There\\u2019s no processes. Everything works instantly and autonomously,\\u201d said Robert Leshner, who founded the DeFi money market protocol Compound, in an interview in August.\", \"But while the idea of a perfectly neutral, self-patrolling system is appealing, high-profile mishaps have cast doubt on the idea that code is a sufficient form of regulation on its own \\u2014 or that it is immune to human mistakes and manipulation.\", \"A smart contract executes automatically when certain conditions are met. So if there is a bug in the system, a user might be able to trigger an unearned transfer all while technically following the \\u201claw\\u201d of code. This is what allowed a $600 million theft this summer from the Poly Network, which lets users transfer cryptocurrencies across blockchain networks. The thieves are believed to have taken advantage of a flaw in the code to override smart contract instructions and trigger massive transfers, essentially tricking the automation into operating as if the proper conditions for a transfer were met.\", \"\\u201cIf you can tell a smart contract to \\u2018give me all your money\\u2019 and it does, is it even theft?\\u201d the computer scientist Nicholas Weaver of the University of California, Berkeley wrote about the theft. Unlike old-school agreements, Weaver wrote, ambiguities with smart contracts cannot be resolved in the courts and automated deals are irreversible \\u2014 so developers must resort to begging when things go awry.\", \"After the $600 million theft, the Poly Network tweeted a request that began, \\u201cDear Hacker,\\u201d asking them to return the funds and calling the act \\u201ca major economic crime.\\u201d Ultimately, most of the money was returned, talk about law enforcement stopped and the hackers said they wanted to show the code was flawed to protect the network.\", \"Similarly, a software upgrade in Compound in September resulted in $90 million being erroneously issued to users. Mr. Leshner said recipients who didn\\u2019t return the crypto would be reported to tax authorities, prompting outcry from his community for undermining claims that these programs cannot technically comply with traditional regulatory requirements to identify users. The request also undermined claims that DeFi has no need for oversight from traditional regulators \\u2014 when a problem arose, Mr. Leshner cited government authority.\", \"For now, DeFi platforms operate in a regulatory gray space, subject to the law of private coders who claim no control over the organization\\u2019s governing programs. Platforms and apps built for blockchain networks are often formed under a new kind of business structure known as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization, or DAO, ostensibly democratically governed by a community of users who vote with crypto tokens.\", \"But there are always people behind the code, as disasters have shown.\", \"\\u201cThat it\\u2019s all code and no humans is simply not true. In cases of urgency, this is when you see where power lies,\\u201d said Thibault Schrepel, who teaches law at Amsterdam University and created the \\u201ccomputational antitrust\\u201d project at the Stanford University CodeX Center for Legal Informatics.\", \"The reason no one wants to claim control of decentralized programs is because it limits liability \\u2014 with no one in control, there is no one to punish for problems and nowhere to implement the law, Mr. Schrepel explained. \\u201cBut the idea that code \\u2014 alone \\u2014 is sufficient, is wrong,\\u201d he said. And if the blockchain community uses code to evade regulation, Mr. Schrepel argues, this will only hamper innovation.\", \"He is part of a generation of techno-lawyers who want to bridge the gaps between code and law. Ideally, he said, code and law could work together. Smart contracts on the blockchain could be used by businesses to collude or to enhance competition, so regulators could analyze code and software programming, cooperating with core developers of decentralized systems. Similarly, policymakers could start translating traditional notions of risk mitigation into code for decentralized finance programs, thinking about the equivalent of reserve requirements that banks have into parameters for programs.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not going to say it\\u2019s easy to advance our thinking,\\u201d said Chris Giancarlo of the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, a former chair of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and author of \\u201cCryptoDad: The Fight for the Future of Money.\\u201d Still, he asks, \\u201cShouldn\\u2019t we try to rethink our approach to regulation to achieve the same policy goals, but in a different way?\\u201d\", \"Mr. Lessig agrees. \\u201cWe need a more sophisticated approach, with technologists and lawyers sitting next to behavioral psychologists and economists,\\u201d all defining parameters to code social values into programs so that private interests don\\u2019t replace them with their own. \\u201cWe\\u2019re facing an existential threat to our democracy and we don\\u2019t have 20 years to wait.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e3fb441e4c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e3fb441e4c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}},
