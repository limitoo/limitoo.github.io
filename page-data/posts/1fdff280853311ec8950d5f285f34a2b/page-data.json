The Ukrainians, while welcoming diplomatic support, have said that what they primarily need are more weapons to deter any attack.\", \"The Turkish leader\\u2019s visit to Ukraine\\u2019s capital, Kyiv, to announce the arms deal came as diplomatic dividing lines are being drawn in the crisis, with the United States, Britain and Eastern European nations sending weaponry to bolster Ukraine in the event of war with Russia. An American airlift of anti-tank missiles and small-arms ammunition continued Thursday with the arrival of a seventh cargo jet of weaponry to Kyiv.\", \"At the same time, Russia denounced the Biden administration\\u2019s announcement that it would send additional troops to NATO countries, with the Kremlin spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, accusing the United States of \\u201cigniting tensions on the European continent.\\u201d Russia\\u2019s defense minister, Sergei K. Shoigu, said Thursday that the Russian military would send additional troops and equipment for military exercises in Belarus, which borders Ukraine to the north, adding to tens of thousands of soldiers already deployed there. \", \"President Emmanuel Macron of France pressed a diplomatic effort in separate phone calls with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. The calls are intended to lead to a summit of Russian, Ukrainian and European leaders to help defuse the threat of a Russian military incursion.\", \"Mr. Erdogan\\u2019s visit to Kyiv was mostly a show of support for Mr. Zelensky\\u2019s government, but the Turkish leader also offered to play a mediating role between Russia and Ukraine, showing he is walking a fine line between backing Ukraine and disrupting a complicated relationship with Russia.\", \"\\u201cWe are ready to fulfill our part to end the crisis between two friendly countries that Turkey neighbors across the Black Sea.\\u201d So far, neither government has taken him up on the idea.\", \"Turkey is a member of NATO but also maintains economic and military industry ties with Russia. And the two countries are also on opposing sides in two Middle Eastern wars, in Syria and Libya, and in the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia in the South Caucasus region.\", \"Mr. Erdogan said Thursday that he wanted to \\u201clower the tensions instead of adding fuel to the flames\\u201d of the conflict, but did not back away from the deal to provide arms to Ukraine, which was first negotiated in 2019 and expanded with a new accord on Thursday.\", \"Turkey has sold Ukraine armed, Bayraktar TB2 drones that the Ukrainian military used for the first time in combat in the war with Russian-backed separatists last October. The drone destroyed a separatist howitzer from miles away, surprising the separatists. \", \"The missile strike suggested a tipping of the military balance in the eastern Ukraine war using a NATO-provided weapon, angering Russia. Mr. Putin mentioned the drone attack last fall in speeches when pressing his case that Russia\\u2019s security was threatened. \", \"And in December, Mr. Putin protested the drone sales directly in a telephone call with Mr. Erdogan, saying the Ukrainians\\u2019 use of Turkish armed drones was \\u201cdestructive\\u201d and \\u201cprovocative activity,\\u201d according to a Kremlin readout of the call.\", \"Ukraine\\u2019s minister of defense, Aleksei Reznikov, said Thursday that Turkey had agreed to localize production of the drone at a factory outside of Kyiv. The Ukrainian version of the Bayraktar will fly with a domestically made engine. Turkey would also buy some drones of this model for its own armed forces, Mr. Reznikov said.\", \"The site would also become a training center for Ukrainian drone pilots, Mr. Reznikov said. \", \"Mr. Zelensky praised the drone deal, which was a clear snub to Russia\\u2019s yearslong objections to Ukraine obtaining the Turkish drone technology and its urgent demands last fall that NATO countries cease arming Ukraine.\", \"\\u201cThis is new technology, new jobs and a strengthening of the defensive capabilities of Ukraine,\\u201d Mr. Zelensky said.\", \"Earlier Thursday, in a bid to reassure Moscow, the Turkish defense minister, Hulusi Akar, stressed Ankara\\u2019s commitment to a treaty that restricts NATO forces\\u2019 access to the Black Sea through the Bosporus and Dardanelles Straits, which Turkey controls. The accord, the Montreux Convention, prohibits aircraft carriers from crossing the straits and limits other warships to short voyages in the Black Sea. \", \"In 2014, during a conflict in Georgia when Washington was seeking to deter Russian military action, Turkey refused to let American warships into the Black Sea.\", \"Mr. Erdogan has military deals with Ukraine and Russia, including the purchase of a Russian air defense system that drew criticism from fellow NATO members. That system, called the S-400, put Russian technology inside the territory of a key Western ally; American officials were deeply angered by the move.\", \"But on Thursday, the commitment to arm Ukraine at a moment of threatened war with Russia sent an unambiguous signal, as did the martial-themed reception Mr. Erdogan received in Kyiv.\", \"During the visit, Mr. Erdogan stood at attention to observe an elaborate parade by a Ukrainian military honor guard and brass band on the grounds of the Tsarist-era Mariinsky Palace in Kyiv, used for formal visits.\", \"When it was over, Mr. Erdogan greeted the soldiers with a phrase in Ukrainian that is associated with the country\\u2019s post-2014 struggles with Russia, another, though symbolic, sign of taking sides in the conflict.\", \"\\u201cGlory to Ukraine!\\u201d Mr. Erdogan said. The soldiers shouted back, \\u201cGlory to its heroes!\\u201d\", \"Turkey and Ukraine also signed a deal intended to increase trade between the two countries to $10 billion from about $7 billion now. The countries also signed agreements to deepen cooperation between their respective police forces and an agreement on closer coordination between their ministries of defense.\", \"The seven American cargo jets have carried a total of about 600 tons of military assistance so far including anti-tank weapons and small-arms ammunition.\", \"The shipments included additional Javelin anti-tank missiles, which the United States has provided since 2018. Britain has airlifted about 2,000 light anti-tank missiles, known as NLAWs, to Ukraine in the past two weeks.\", \" With approval from the United States, the Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, said they would transfer more Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger antiaircraft missiles, plugging some holes in Ukraine\\u2019s shoddy air defenses. Poland has also said it will send antiaircraft missiles.\", \"The shipments may have reached an important tipping point, Andriy Zahorodniuk, a former Ukrainian minister of defense, said in an interview Thursday. With the additional British and American supplies, Ukraine now has more anti-tank missiles than Russia has operational main battle tanks in its military, he said, though Russia\\u2019s total including tanks in reserve is still larger.\", \"Ukraine, he said, does not have to reach a so-called \\u201ccapability parity\\u201d with the Russian Army \\u2014 an impossibility in any case \\u2014 to deter a military intervention, he said.\", \"\\u201cInvading somebody\\u2019s territory is much more difficult than defending,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe task in defending is to cause such a high level of casualties that it becomes unbearable.\\u201d \", \"\"]","href_hash":"1fdff280853311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1fdff280853311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
