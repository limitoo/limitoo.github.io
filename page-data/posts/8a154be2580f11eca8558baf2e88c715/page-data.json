There would be virtual school only.\", \"On Friday, a follow-up announcement: School was also canceled starting that Monday, for the entire week of Thanksgiving. This time, there would be no online option.\", \"\\u201cYou need to take the kids back out again?\\u201d Ms. Reynolds said. \\u201cHow is that not going to be harmful to these students?\\u201d\", \"After a few months of relative calm, some public schools are going remote \\u2014 or canceling classes entirely \\u2014 for a day a week, or even for a couple of weeks, because of teacher burnout or staff shortages.\", \"At least six other school districts in Michigan extended Thanksgiving break, and three districts in Washington State, including Seattle Public Schools, unexpectedly closed on Nov. 12, the day after Veterans Day. In one instance, Brevard Public Schools in Florida used leftover \\u201churricane days\\u201d to close schools for the entire week of Thanksgiving.\", \"In Utah, the Canyons School District announced that all of its schools would go remote one Friday a month from November until March, equivalent to more than week of school. \", \"A few of these districts have closed with very little notice, sending parents scrambling to find child care, as well as summon the wherewithal to supervise remote learning. Beyond the logistics, many parents are worried that with additional lost days of in-person school, their children will fall further behind.\", \"School districts cited various reasons for the temporary closings, from a rise in Covid-19 cases to a need to thoroughly sanitize classrooms. But for many schools, the remote learning days \\u2014 an option that did not exist before the pandemic \\u2014 are a last-ditch effort to keep teachers from resigning. They are burned out, educators said, after a year of trying to help students through learning loss, and working overtime to make up for labor shortages.\", \"Battles in the classroom \\u2014 from mask mandates to debates over critical race theory \\u2014 have also taken a toll, said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers, the country\\u2019s second-biggest teachers\\u2019 union.\", \"\\u201cWhat you hear from teachers is that it\\u2019s been too much,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd they\\u2019re trying the best that they can.\\u201d\", \"These temporary closures, though, may only hamper relationships with parents at a moment when tensions in many districts are already high.\", \"Because of school cancellations last academic year, Ms. Reynolds, who works at a University of Michigan research lab, had already run out of paid time off. Her mother was able to watch her fourth-grade son last Friday. But now she is scrambling to make sure someone else can be home with him every Friday this month \\u2014 or lose hundreds of dollars from her paycheck.\", \"School fights and other outbursts from students led district leaders at Reynolds Middle School, in Fairview, Ore., just east of Portland, to cancel classes from Nov. 18 until Dec. 7. They gave parents two days\\u2019 notice.\", \"\\u201cAre you kidding me?\\u201d said Missy Kisselman, the mother of Sophia, an eighth grader there. \\u201cI mean, are you kidding me?\\u201d\", \"Ms. Kisselman, who is working out of her living room as a county case manager, said it was \\u201cnearly impossible\\u201d for her to help Sophia, who has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, with her schoolwork.\", \"\\u201cI feel like, if this school knew that they were already understaffed starting this school year, it should have just stayed online,\\u201d Ms. Kisselman said.\", \"Steven Padilla, a district spokesman, said the school was using this time to reflect on its safety protocols to \\u201censure that we will not have to return to short-term distance learning\\u201d in the future.\", \"In Portland, Ore., the teachers\\u2019 union is proposing early-release days for high schoolers after they return from winter break.\", \"Elizabeth Thiel, president of the Portland Association of Teachers, says her union is receiving an \\u201calarming\\u201d number of inquires from teachers asking for help resigning. If the union can figure out a plan now, she says, that may help avoid mass resignations, which would force schools to go entirely remote.\", \"\\u201cIt is far better for our students and families to be able to plan on an inconvenience like that, than it would be for the whole system to stop functioning,\\u201d Ms. Thiel said.\", \"In Southfield, outside of Detroit, the school district alerted parents on Oct. 31, a Sunday, that it would go remote that Friday \\u2014 and then every Friday until February. Kristina Morgan, whose daughter is an eighth grader at University Middle School Academy, said she found out through social media.\", \"A single mother who works for the Wayne County court system, Ms. Morgan now spends the beginning of every week asking family members to watch her daughter, Kennedy. If she cannot find anyone, she will take the day off from work \\u2014 which she says reflects poorly at the office, and makes her feel like a burden to her family.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s very difficult already being a single parent, period,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut when you have your life figured out based on your child being in school during certain hours \\u2014 and when I have to scramble to find child care outside of those hours, or to ask around \\u2014 it\\u2019s frustrating.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Morgan could leave her teenage daughter at home alone but was worried that she would get distracted by her phone or the internet instead of paying attention to school.\", \"Research shows that disruptions during the pandemic led to students falling behind in math and reading, and students who were most affected by the crisis were already behind. Ms. Reynolds, the single mother from Detroit, said her son, once a straight-A math student, tested two grade levels behind when he returned to the classroom this year.\", \"Last Friday, Theo Eggebrecht, 17, a senior in the arts track at Cass Technical High School in Detroit, did not have any at-home supplies for two of his arts classes that day. He said his science teacher did not show up for online class.\", \"Instead, Mr. Eggebrecht spent several hours doing chores, petting his cat and scrolling through TikTok.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m a senior, this is one of my last years of education,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s nerve-racking to miss out on that.\\u201d\", \"Schools have not yet reached winter break, but many teachers are already burned out. It seems that many parents and students are as well.\", \"Ms. Kisselman recalls the moment her daughter asked for help with an assignment.\", \"\\u201cShe was just in and out of the living room because her anxiety level was so high,\\u201d Ms. Kisselman said. \\u201cShe\\u2019s like \\u2018What am I supposed to do? How am I supposed to learn on my own?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Ms. Kisselman did not have an answer.\", \"\\u201cI finally just looked at her and said, \\u2018Just don\\u2019t do anything today,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Kisselman said. \\u201cJust go into the bedroom, and just do whatever, but don\\u2019t mess with school today.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8a154be2580f11eca8558baf2e88c715"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8a154be2580f11eca8558baf2e88c715"}},
