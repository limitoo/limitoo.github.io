Samuel Paparo, commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, said on Friday at a public hearing with Navy officials and state legislators. \\u201cWe are taking ownership of the solutions, and we are going to fix it. We are in the process of fixing this.\\u201d\", \"The wells are part of three groundwater sources that provide drinking water to the Joint Base Pearl Harbor-Hickam water system, which serves residents of military housing, the Aliamanu Military Reservation, and several elementary schools and day care centers.\", \"On Thursday, the Navy said it had found \\u201celevated\\u201d amounts of \\u201ctotal petroleum hydrocarbon\\u201d in samples taken near another groundwater source, the Aiea Halawa well, which was shut down on Dec. 3. That discovery was announced about a week after the Navy said samples taken from the Red Hill shaft showed the water had been contaminated.\", \"The state said that about 93,000 people have been affected.\", \"Residents have complained of sickened pets and reported symptoms including sore throats, stomach pain, headaches, diarrhea and vomiting. Health officials said that people who were exposed to the contaminated water could also experience difficulty breathing, coughing and red or peeling skin.\", \"\\u201cThe level of this contaminant poses a public health threat, and is considered unsafe to drink,\\u201d Kathleen Ho, deputy director for environmental health at the Hawaii State Department of Health, said in a statement. \\u201cWe will continue to take all possible action to protect public health and the environment.\\u201d\", \"People were also instructed to avoid cooking with the water, bathing in it, or washing dishes and clothes.\", \"\\u201cThis includes consumption by pets,\\u201d the department said.\", \"Health officials said that for the moment, they did not expect long-term health effects to result from the exposure.\", \"Carlos Del Toro, the secretary of the Navy, said he had suspended operations at the underground storage tanks at the Red Hill military fuel storage site in Oahu.\", \"Navy officials said they believed that the water in the Red Hill well was contaminated after jet fuel spilled into an access tunnel at the site on Nov. 20. The spill was cleaned up in 24 to 30 hours, according to the Navy, but not before it leached into the water system.\", \"\\u201cI deeply apologize to each and every one of you and to the people of Hawaii that this incident may have been destructive to your lives in any way,\\u201d Secretary Del Toro told residents of the base on Sunday during a four-hour community meeting.\", \"Health officials in Hawaii have ordered the Navy to clean up its water system and suspend operations at Red Hill.\", \"Gov. David Ige and members of Hawaii\\u2019s congressional delegation have described the contamination issue as a \\u201ccrisis.\\u201d\", \"Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii said the Environmental Protection Agency should take full control of testing and analyzing the water in the system.\", \"\\u201cWe need a trusted independent agency with deep expertise and a mission of environmental protection to take over,\\u201d he said in a statement.\", \"Secretary Del Toro said last weekend that he was determined to get to the \\u201croot cause of this problem\\u201d and fix it so that \\u201cyou can feel confident that the water you are drinking is safe.\\u201d\", \"Navy officials said at the hearing on Friday that they planned to clean up the Red Hill well by flushing it with 25 million gallons of clean water.\", \"The Navy said it would then flush out the water systems in every house and building that had experienced contamination.\", \"The plan is to get people back in their homes by Christmas, said Rear Adm. Dean VanderLey, a goal he acknowledged was \\u201cvery aggressive.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThat remains my personal goal for the sake of our families,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"7e02076e5abc11ec8f9ab5abfbed742f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7e02076e5abc11ec8f9ab5abfbed742f"}},
