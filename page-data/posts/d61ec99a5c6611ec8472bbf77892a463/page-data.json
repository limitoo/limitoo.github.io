The ones that I, as an iwi member, am discouraging from coming here is very much the holiday makers.

Our systems aren't strong enough to cope ... because we are so remote and isolated,\\\" Rapihana said.\", \"It was quite a different reaction from a tourism operator in Rotorua.\", \"Tim Cossar of Te Puia, the multifaceted tourist attraction, wanted as many people as possible there from Wednesday.\", \"\\\"Certainly we want people travelling to and from Rotorua. There's no question in our minds that we need a really strong Christmas/New Year trading period, and then a strong January and February.\\\"\", \"It was a crucial period for the region, for businesses and for jobs, with international arrivals unlikely to get back to the pre Covid-19 levels for some time, he said.\", \"\\\"It's a long, long pathway, and we still have to get through a good eight to nine months before international returns in earnest.\\\"\", \"Further south and around the East Coast, Tair\\u0101whiti is another area moving from red to orange traffic light setting.\", \"Pene Brown of Te Aitanga a M\\u0101haki Trust was relieved that the big event of the summer Rhythm and Vines had been postponed to Easter.\", \"He was not expecting there to be any big events over summer.\", \"\\\"No, we're not. We know that some areas will have that, maybe Tauranga and some places where they're happy with their vaccination rates and they've had the organisation.
