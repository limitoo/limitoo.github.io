That was the hardest thing for me to reconcile. Suddenly, no one was around, and I felt like nobody understood me, and I struggled with having to take on a lot more responsibility, when I was also in the middle of the normal teenage struggles we all go through.\", \"\\\"That's why it's so important that young people have somewhere to turn when their mum or dad has a stroke - to answer their questions and to remind them they're not alone.\\\"\", \"As well as accessing videos and information about strokes, young people can also access support from Barnardos' 0800 What's Up service website.\", \"The free service is for tamariki aged between five and 19, where councillors help young people build resilience.\", \"Barnardos child and family services general manager Jo Harrison said childen often need someone outside their family or peer group to talk to.\", \"''No issue is too small or too big for our trained counsellors - young people should reach out if they need to be heard.\", \"\\\"Our early intervention approach means that we focus on helping build resilience, empowering tamariki and rangatahi by supporting them to solve their own problems, providing tools and strategies before things get too hard.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"6b75fc12237511ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6b75fc12237511ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
