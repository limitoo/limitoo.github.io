Dining rooms in New York had been closed, again, by order of the governor. Is it any wonder that some of my strongest memories of the year in eating are takeout and delivery dishes? Or that, once restaurants were allowed to serve indoors again in February, the things that tasted best tended to be enduring classics like chicken soup from Eastern Europe and egg rolls from the streets of Saigon? Here are the 10 dishes \\u2014 in no particular order \\u2014 that dance in my vision when I close my eyes, all of them taken from establishments in the city that for one reason or another did not make my list of the year\\u2019s best new restaurants.\", \"Estelle was the grandmother of the chef, Mark Strausman, and this was her soup. It got my attention not because I\\u2019d never had anything like it before \\u2014 it\\u2019s the classic once found at every diner and deli, and still pretty common in New York \\u2014 but because it is rarely made so well these days. Broth this full-bodied takes more chicken and more time than most people are ready to spend ($13).\", \"As found nearly every day at the steam table in this bright and welcoming shop in Astoria, Queens, roughly crushed egusi seeds provide the nutty and crunchy substance of this West African stew, cradling spinach and red peppers cooked just long enough to be tender. The palm oil that gives the stew a brilliant flame-orange color also makes it smooth, rich and luxurious ($8).\", \"It\\u2019s almost laughably basic, this circle of dough, about as thick as a linen napkin, spread with spiced lamb and baked. So is the salad that comes with it \\u2014 lettuce, tomatoes and white onions under a purplish shower of sumac. Somehow, though, when you scatter the salad over the lamb, squeeze lemon on everything and roll it up, the long cigar of meat and vegetables evokes all of Turkish cuisine at once ($5).\", \"To lockdown-era New Yorkers who were struggling to keep their heads above water, having a bag of Eric Huang\\u2019s Southern-fried, Sichuan-seasoned chicken brought to the doorstep was like having somebody throw you a life preserver that you could eat. The chicken is still available for delivery, but it\\u2019s also sold on the weekends at the Huang family\\u2019s restaurant in Queens ($35 for three pieces with three sides).\", \"Ground pork and wood-ear mushrooms fill these Vietnamese egg rolls. And you\\u2019ll be convinced those ingredients make one of the world\\u2019s greatest marriages for as long as it takes you to finish one \\u2014 less than two minutes, if you\\u2019re anything like me. Dad is the chef\\u2019s father, and he used to make them on the streets of Saigon ($12).\", \"Shuna Lydon, a pastry chef in pandemic exile from restaurants, bakes a variety of sweet and savory treats for home delivery. Her lineup changes weekly with one exception: the EMK, or English muffin kit, is a constant. It deserves to be. The muffins are small but substantial, more chewy than crumbly; if you\\u2019ve had only mass-produced muffins, the deep flavor Ms. Lydon builds in her sourdough is almost shocking. Each kit comes with four muffins, salted butter and, the real treasure, a small jar of fresh jam, just barely cooked to keep the fruit tasting bright and juicy ($15).\", \"In a perfect New York, Under the Volcano would cook its lamb mixiotes underground, in a fire pit. In actuality, the lamb is cooked in an oven, but some of the missing smoke is supplied by a shot of mezcal added to the spices and garlic \\u2014 not enough to get you drunk, but enough to set your senses reeling ($14).\", \"There are technical explanations for the weightless, shattering shell on the fish and the more heavy-duty crunch on the chips at Dame, having to do with air pockets and boiling points. And if you want to talk about that science with a plate in front of you, go right ahead. The fish, for once, won\\u2019t get soggy, though if you don\\u2019t shut up and eat, it will eventually get cold ($29).\", \"The virtue of the manhattan is its simplicity; even a distracted bartender can knock together a decent one. The downside is that it is generally lacks polish, like a rough draft. An old variation called Remember the Maine, resurrected by Sunken Harbor Club, is both more velvety (thanks to cherry liqueur) and more spiky (absinthe). It has the combination of elegance and raw power that enables our most heroic cocktails to set a drifting world spinning on its axis again ($16).\", \"Aguachile is a raw-seafood cocktail straight out of Sinaloa. Most often it bathes raw shrimp in a red or green liquid that tastes fresh and vegetal, like something you might get from your local juice bar if it was trying to use up some extra serrano and Fresno chiles. The addition of soy sauce makes Mariscos El Submarino\\u2019s aguachile negro taste brawnier, almost meaty, while the chiles make it one of the most head-clearingly spicy bowls of raw shrimp in the city ($19).\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
