She was 85.\", \"Anne Marie McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, R.I., which inducted Hard in 1973, confirmed the death but did not give a cause.\", \"Hard flourished in the late 1950s and early \\u201960s, when tournament tennis was the domain of amateurs. Along with her, the women\\u2019s game featured stars such as Althea Gibson and a young Billie Jean King, Maria Bueno of Brazil and Margaret Court of Australia, all future Hall of Famers.\", \"Of the Grand Slam tournaments, Hard won the United States amateur titles in 1960 and \\u201961 and the French title in 1960. She reached the United States finals in 1958 and 1962 and the Wimbledon finals in 1957 and 1959. She also won 13 Grand Slam championships in women\\u2019s doubles with eight different partners, and five in mixed doubles, often paired with Rod Laver.\", \"She was ranked No. 1 in the United States from 1960 through 1963, and No. 2 in the world in 1960 and \\u201961.\", \"Gibson played with more power than many women before or since, and Bueno was noted for her grace, but Hard\\u2019s aggressive game \\u2014 big serve, strong overhead and punishing volley \\u2014 made her a winner. At 5 feet 5\\u00bd inches tall and 140 pounds, her main success came on grass courts, where three of the four Grand Slam tournaments were played. (The French Open was, and still is, played on a clay surface).\", \"Hard was unusually outspoken at a time when most top players lacked the assertiveness that some display today. She once said of dominating Australian tennis officials: \\u201cThey treat you not as a player but a puppet. Between tournaments, I was not asked to play in exhibitions \\u2014 I was ordered to play in them. It was not \\u2018Miss Hard, would you mind playing?\\u2019 It was \\u2018Miss Hard, you will play.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Hard belonged to four victorious teams in the Wightman Cup, the annual competition between British and American tennis players. She showed her independent mindedness then, too, earning the irritation of the American team\\u2019s captain, Margaret Osborne duPont.\", \"DuPont called Hard a \\u201cdisrupting element\\u201d in an official 1962 report. \\u201cShe insisted on practicing her way instead of complying with the captain\\u2019s wishes and those of the other team members,\\u201d duPont said.\", \"Hard took part in a match that made tennis history on July 6, 1957, losing in the final that made Gibson the first African American woman to win Wimbledon (by a 6-3, 6-2 score). Before the match, as customary, both players curtsied to a young Queen Elizabeth II. Afterward, the queen spoke to them for a few minutes. Then Gibson, following protocol, backed away. An overly enthused Hard, however, in an eyebrow-raising breach of etiquette, turned her back to the queen and skipped toward the locker room.\", \"Darlene Ruth Hard was born on Jan. 6, 1936, in Los Angeles and grew up in nearby Montebello, Calif. Her father introduced her to football, basketball, baseball and softball. Her mother, a good amateur player, taught her tennis on public courts.\", \"After high school, Hard spent four years on the tennis circuit. Then, she later said, \\u201cI decided I didn\\u2019t want tennis for a life, so I went to college. I wanted to be in pediatrics. I guess I always wanted to be a doctor.\\u201d\", \"She went to Pomona College in California and in 1958 won the first intercollegiate tennis championship for women. She graduated in 1961.\", \"While at Pomona, Hard had a hitting session with a 13-year-old player who had demonstrated some promise: Billie Jean King.\", \"\\u201cDarlene Hard had a major influence on my career, as an athlete, teammate and friend,\\u201d King was quoted as saying on the Hall of Fame website. The two went on to play doubles together in the first Federation Cup, in 1963, the premier international women\\u2019s team tennis competition. King \\u2014 for whom the cup is now named \\u2014 recalled how they had overcome two match points to win the final, a highlight of both of their careers, she said.\", \"Hard returned to tennis after graduating and worked as a waitress between tournaments. In 1964, with only $400 in the bank, she turned professional and played on a South African tour with Bueno. She soon started giving tennis lessons in the Los Angeles area, leaving behind tournament play.\", \"But in 1969, the year after pros were accepted into major tournaments, she returned briefly to international competition, teaming up with Fran\\u00e7oise D\\u00fcrr to play doubles at the U.S. Open. Down 0-6, 0-2 in the final, they rallied to capture the title, 0\\u20136, 6\\u20133, 6\\u20134.\", \"Hard went back to teaching tennis and owned two tennis shops. One of her tennis students, the director of student publications at the University of Southern California, offered her a job in the office in 1981. Hard remained there for nearly 40 years.\", \"Information on her survivors was not immediately available.\", \"In \\u201cWe Have Come a Long Way: The Story of Women\\u2019s Tennis\\u201d (1988), which King wrote with Cynthia Starr, Hard described her dedication to the sport.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t do it for money,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI was the last of the amateurs. I won Forest Hills and I got my airfare from New York to Los Angeles. Whoopee.\\u201d She continued: \\u201cBut we still went for our titles. We went for the glory. I was happy. I loved it. I loved tennis.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"d6e3188d587d11ec8d41c77514084e80"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d6e3188d587d11ec8d41c77514084e80"}},
