Both Minnesota and New Hampshire have fully vaccinated more than 70 percent of their adult residents, and Maine, where more than 80 percent of adults are fully vaccinated, is starting to see a concerning rise in cases.\", \"Maine Governor Janet Mills attributed the surge in cases largely to unvaccinated individuals and said the state is seeing higher case rates in counties with lower vaccination rates. While the same is somewhat true for New Hampshire\\u2013that counties with lower vaccination rates are seeing upticks in cases\\u2013that's not always the case.\", \"New Hampshire has the second-highest number of COVID-19 cases in the country and that surge is highest in the city of Nashua as well as Coos and Sullivan counties, according to data from the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services.\", \"Both the city of Nashua and Coos County have an average percent positive rate of 14.5, significantly higher than the state's overall percent positive rate of 9.4. The data provided by the state separated Nashua from the rest of Hillsborough County, where it is located. According to state data, the rest of Hillsborough County without Nashua has an 11.5 percent positive rate.\", \"Nashua has the seventh-highest vaccination rate in the state and Coos County has the sixth.\", \"Sullivan County, with a 13.9 percent positive rate, isn't far behind in cases and has the second-worst vaccination rate, just above the city of Manchester.\", \"Grafton County, which has the highest county vaccination rate in New Hampshire, is seeing the lowest number of COVID-19 cases, something that isn't entirely surprising. However, the city of Manchester has fewer cases than more than 50 percent of the state's counties despite having the lowest vaccination rate.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939715/covid-19-winter-surge-vaccination-rates.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The winter surge in COVID-19 is starting to hit states with higher vaccination rates, includin Maine and New Hampshire, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

But we have to stay vigilant on it, we really do. It's when we become lax that we start to see those numbers skyrocket.\\\"\", \"Cases are expected to trend upwards for the next two to four weeks, something that Sununu believes will put a \\\"lot of pressure\\\" on the state's hospital system. He signed an executive order to help increase hospital capacity by adding beds in non-traditional spaces and rehabilitation centers.\", \"Of the 10 states with the highest COVID-19 cases, only two states\\u2013North Dakota and Alaska\\u2013aren't seeing an uptick in cases, which indicates they could be on the tail end of their surge.\", \"Only two of the top 10 states for COVID-19 cases that are seeing an uptick in cases have vaccinated fewer than 70 percent of its adults, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

Officials have also warned that the winter surge in COVID-19 cases could coincide with an increase in flu cases, making it all the more important people get inoculated against the flu.\"]","href_hash":"bbe183df4d4c11ec936ffd162d439b5d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bbe183df4d4c11ec936ffd162d439b5d"}},
