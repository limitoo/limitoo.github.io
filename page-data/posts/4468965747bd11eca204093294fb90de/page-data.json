The percentage of Americans supporting stricter gun laws is the lowest the poll has recorded since 2014, when less than 50 percent of respondents said they were in favor of stricter gun laws.\", \"According to the poll, 35 percent of Americans said they believe that gun laws should remain the same while 11 percent said they think gun laws should be less strict.\", \"The Gallup poll has been tracking Americans' views on gun laws since 1990 when 78 percent of people who responded said they supported stricter gun laws, the highest the poll has ever recorded.\", \"The poll showed that after 2014, the support for stricter gun laws increased, with 67 percent of Americans saying they support stricter gun laws in 2018. However, after 2018, the support has since decreased over the past several years, dropping a total of 15 points from then until this year.\", \"The poll found Democrats increasingly supporting stricter gun laws, while an opposite trend was recorded among Republicans.
