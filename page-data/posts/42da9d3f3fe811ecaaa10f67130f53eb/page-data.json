However, he offered a warning to Republicans.\", \"\\\"We can no longer talk about the past and the past elections,\\\" he said. \\\"No matter where you stand on that issue, no matter where you stand, it is over. And every minute that we spend talking about 2020 while we're wasting time doing that, Joe Biden, Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are laying ruin to this country,\\\" he said during the speech.\", \"He called on Republicans to look to suburban voters, who have moved away from the GOP in recent years. He said they want a government that is \\\"honest and truthful and efficient and not wasting their money and not wasting their time.\\\"\", \"He said Glenn Youngkin's recent gubernatorial election victory in Virginia was the \\\"start of a new era for the Republican Party\\\" and remarked that winning campaigns like Youngkin's \\\"look forward and not backwards.\\\"\", \"Christie served as governor of New Jersey from 2010 to 2018. Like Youngkin, he was elected a year after the state backed a Democrat for president by double digits.\", \"Some political experts have said Youngkin's win, while largely a referendum on Biden's poor approval rating, could also be a sign that swing-state Republicans may move away from Trump and his style of politics. Youngkin was endorsed by the former president but kept his distance from him and his unfounded claims about the 2020 presidential election.\", \"\\\"Youngkin's campaign could be the start of something big for the Republican Party\\u2014a gradual process of separating itself from Donald Trump,\\\" Quirk said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927766/former-governor-chris-christie.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, pictured above speaking in Trenton in 2015, told CNN that former President Trump needs to \\u201ctell the truth\\u201d about the 2020 election. </div>\"]","href_hash":"42da9d3f3fe811ecaaa10f67130f53eb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"42da9d3f3fe811ecaaa10f67130f53eb"}},
