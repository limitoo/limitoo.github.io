There was the time that a visiting team\\u2019s volleyball coach mocked the deaf players. And another time a hearing coach for the girls basketball team listened as opponents discussed how embarrassing it would be to lose to a deaf team.\", \"It did not help morale that the varsity football team, the Cubs, recently suffered seven straight losing seasons, leaving the school with the sinking feeling that opposing football teams came to the Riverside campus expecting an easy win.\", \"No one is disparaging the Cubs anymore. This season, they are undefeated \\u2014 the highest ranked team in their Southern California division. Through 11 games, they have not so much beaten their opponents as flattened them.\", \"On Friday night, the second round of the playoffs, the Cubs trounced the Desert Christian Knights, 84-12, a score that would have been even more lopsided had the Cubs not shown mercy by putting their second-string players in for the entire second half.\", \"Led by the school\\u2019s physical education teacher, Keith Adams, a burly and effervescent deaf man whose two deaf sons are also on the team, the Cubs are a fast and hard-hitting squad. Wing-footed wide receivers fly past defenses, averaging 17 yards per catch. The quarterback doubles as the team\\u2019s leading rusher, with 22 touchdowns on the season. A system of coded hand signals among tight-knit teammates and coaches confounds opponents with its speed and efficiency.\", \"With Friday\\u2019s win, the Cubs are two games away from capturing the division championship for the first time in the school\\u2019s 68-year history. But coaches and players say they already feel like winners.\", \"\\u201cI sometimes still can\\u2019t believe how well we played this year,\\u201d Mr. Adams said after the win on Friday. \\u201cI knew we were good, but never in my dreams did I think we would dominate every game.\\u201d\", \"In a part of California that suffered greatly during the pandemic with high unemployment and more than 5,000 dead, the Cubs\\u2019 excellence has lifted the school and the surrounding community.\", \"Football is a richly audible experience: the crashing of helmets, the crunch of a tackle, teammates shouting from the sidelines and the roaring approval of the crowd. Friday night games at the Riverside campus are not totally silent, but they are not boisterous either. The generators that power the lights hum and the crowd reacts with scattered claps. But there is no public address system, no play-by-play commentator to call out player\\u2019s names after a touchdown pass or run-stuffing tackle.\", \"The American flag flies near the field, but there is no national anthem before the game. A sign-language interpreter hired by the school serves as an intermediary between the Cubs\\u2019 coaching staff and the game officials. Before the game on Friday, the interpreter reminded the officials to wave their hands when they blew whistles to stop a play.\", \"For the coaching staff, the success of the team has undermined the longstanding stereotype that deafness is something to overcome in football.\", \"Mr. Adams, who coached the team for two seasons starting in 2005 and began his second stint four years ago, attributes the turnaround to rigorous conditioning and an especially talented cohort of players, some of whom have played together for years at lower levels.\", \"He also has a philosophy that what might be thought of as a deficit can be an edge.\", \"Many teams try to use hand signals to call in plays, but they are no match for the Cubs, who communicate with a flurry of hand movements between each play. No time is wasted by players running to the sidelines to get an earful from the coaching staff. No huddle is needed.\", \"The coaches also say deaf players have heightened visual senses that make them more alert to movement. And because they are so visual, deaf players have a more acute sense of where their opponents are positioned on the field.\", \"After being defeated on Friday, Aaron Williams, coach of Desert Christian, said he had a warning for future opponents of the California School for the Deaf, Riverside.\", \"\\u201cI would say be careful in thinking that you have an advantage,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey communicate better than any team I have ever coached against.\\u201d\", \"For players, parents and staff, the success of the football team has been more than just an athletic triumph. Many describe it as a sign that deaf children can be at their best when they are together in an all-deaf environment.\", \"Delia Gonzales, mother of Felix, a junior and one of the team\\u2019s wide receivers, beamed on the sideline on Friday as her son scored two touchdowns.\", \"She recounted how Felix had pleaded with her to play football at age 10 but then fell into despair when surrounded by hearing players whom he could not understand.\", \"\\u201cThe coach would just talk at him,\\u201d Ms. Gonzales said. \\u201cHe would come home crying.\\u201d\", \"Many players and staff use the word loneliness to describe how they felt in mainstream settings, surrounded by people yet isolated. And teachers and parents recount how students blossomed in an all-deaf environment.\", \"\\u201cAbsolutely, this has changed his life,\\u201d Ms. Gonzales said of her son. \\u201cNow he is one of the stars.\\u201d\", \"With just 168 students at the high school \\u2014 the institution runs from preschool through the 12th grade \\u2014 the Cubs play in an eight-player league designed for smaller schools, often those in rural areas or private institutions. Other eight-player schools include the prestigious Cate and Thacher schools of Southern California. There is only one other deaf high school in the state, and it doesn\\u2019t play in the same division.\", \"With their string of wins, the Cubs are starting to get noticed. Players and coaches were featured in pregame ceremonies at the Los Angeles Chargers-Minnesota Vikings game on Sunday and were introduced on the Jumbotron to a packed, cheering stadium.\", \"The school\\u2019s 63-acre campus, once surrounded by orange groves, today is framed by strip malls, freeways and fast-food restaurants, and is the only all-deaf public school serving the southern half of the state.\", \"The football team\\u2019s success has energized the campus and spawned impromptu alumni reunions at games.\", \"\\u201cThis has been a long time coming,\\u201d said Patricia Davis, one of the school\\u2019s first 56 students when it opened in 1953.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been a losing team for so long,\\u201d she said at Friday\\u2019s game, surrounded by exuberant fellow graduates. \\u201cI\\u2019m just thrilled.\\u201d\", \"With a dirt track around the field, fragments of bleachers that look as if they were salvaged from a demolished stadium, a blurry scoreboard and a bumpy grass playing surface, the school has all the requisites of an underdog team. The field is dimly lit with portable floodlights, each with its own exhaust-spewing generator, the kind of equipment that might be deployed by a night construction crew repaving an interstate.\", \"Winning has made those conditions more bearable this season. On Friday, players sat in their locker room on benches facing their coaches for the pregame pep talk.\", \"\\u201cYou guys have one job and that\\u2019s to win,\\u201d Esau Zornoza, an assistant coach, exhorted the players in sign language. Clad in their cardinal-red jerseys, 21 players lined up at the door and slapped the corridor walls as they filed into the warm Southern California evening.\", \"Trevin Adams, the Cubs\\u2019 quarterback with long blond hair, said playing with fellow deaf teammates is liberating and has fueled the team\\u2019s winning chemistry.\", \"\\u201cWe can express ourselves completely,\\u201d said Trevin, a junior who is Coach Adams\\u2019s son. \\u201cWe can be leaders. We can be assertive.\\u201d\", \"When he was younger, Trevin played in a league with hearing people.\", \"\\u201cThat just felt like a team,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cThis feels more like a brotherhood.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a8372fc945fe11ec983e3b77017112d3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a8372fc945fe11ec983e3b77017112d3"}},
