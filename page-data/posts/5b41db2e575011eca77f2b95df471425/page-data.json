But conditions improved enough as the morning wore on   to permit a liftoff and the Atlas 5 put on a spectacular pre-dawn  show,  lighting up the Space Coast as it roared away to the east over  the  Atlantic Ocean.\", \"The Atlas 5's Centaur second stage reached  its  preliminary orbit about 10-and-a-half minutes after take off. Two  more  firings of its Aerojet Rocketdyne RL10C engine were planned over  seven  hours to put the Space Test Program satellites in a circular  orbit  22,300 miles above the equator.\", \"At such \\\"geosynchronous\\\"  altitudes, satellites take 24 hours to complete one orbit and thus  appear stationary in the sky, allowing around-the-clock communications  with fixed antennas on the ground.\", \"The Space Test Program 3  mission -- STP-3 -- cost $1.14 billion, officials said, and consists of  two Northrop Grumman-built satellites carrying multiple instruments and  experiment packages.\", \"The STPSat-6 satellite carries nine  experiments, including NASA's Laser Communication Relay Demonstration,  or LCRD, and nuclear detonation sensors provided by the National Nuclear  Security Administration.\", \"The second satellite is an innovative  hitchhiker known as LDPE-1, a low-cost carrier for small instruments and  sensors that can be quickly added to flights with excess payload  capability. The satellite carries several experimental payloads and will  operate on its own for one to three years.\", \"NASA has particularly  high hopes for the Laser Communication Relay Demonstration, using two  telescopes on the STPSat-6 satellite to send and receive high-speed data  via infrared laser links to ground stations in California and Hawaii.\", \"Encoded laser light can transmit 10 to 100 times more data than the radio systems currently used by spacecraft in low-Earth orbit, aboard the International Space Station and in deep space probes across the solar system.\", \"To put that in perspective, NASA says it would take roughly nine weeks for a spacecraft orbiting Mars to beam back a complete map of the red planet using current radio technology. An optical communications system could do it in about nine days.\", \"That's the good news. The bad news is that unlike radio waves, infrared laser light cannot penetrate cloud cover and generally clear skies are needed. NASA's LCRD experiment will use two clear-sky sites in Hawaii and California to test the system's ability to beam back data under different atmospheric conditions.\", \"NASA plans to launch a terminal to the International Space Station later that will send data to the ground via the LRCD payload and vice versa. Eventually, laser systems could be used on deep space missions to speed up data transmission.\", \"\\\"In the future, you are going to see us launching a payload on board the Psyche mission that will be going into deep space to (study) an asteroid orbiting between Jupiter and Mars,\\\" said Badri Younes, deputy chief of NASA's Space Communications and Navigation.\", \"\\\"Why are we doing that? Because optical communication is so critical to the evolution of our space communication and navigation capabilities... If we have to keep on evolving and keep on meeting the users' appetite for more bandwidth and more data, we need to move it to the optical domain. It provides a huge bandwidth.\\\"\", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News. He covered 129 space shuttle missions, every interplanetary flight since Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune and scores of commercial and military launches. Based at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Harwood is a devoted amateur astronomer and co-author of \\\"Comm Check: The Final Flight of Shuttle Columbia.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"5b41db2e575011eca77f2b95df471425"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5b41db2e575011eca77f2b95df471425"}},
