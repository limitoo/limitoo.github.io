The ball is in their court, they should answer us with something,\\\" Putin said.\", \"Putin accused Ukraine of breaking its commitments under a 2015 deal meant to halt fighting in its eastern Donbass area between Ukrainian and pro-Russian forces, and refusing to talk to representatives of two breakaway regions there.\", \"Ukraine's foreign ministry said Kyiv, on the contrary, had done \\\"titanic work\\\" to bring about a new ceasefire agreement in the east on Wednesday. The Ukrainian military reported, however, that the \\\"armed formations of the Russian Federation\\\" had violated the latest truce three times in the course of Thursday, including with mortars and heavy grenade launchers.\", \"There were no casualties from those incidents, it said.\", \"Four sources have told Reuters that Russian mercenaries have deployed to separatist-controlled eastern Ukraine in recent weeks to bolster defences against Ukrainian forces.\", \"Swedish Foreign Minister Ann Linde, chair of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which has a monitoring mission in the conflict zone, called the ceasefire a \\\"small but important first step towards de-escalation along the contact line\\\".\", \"The Biden administration official also welcomed the move, but called it a \\\"small step\\\" and added that Washington would be looking for follow-through.\", \"Ukraine rejects Putin's stance that Moscow is just a mediator in the conflict, accusing it of providing direct backing to the separatist side.

It's practically impossible,\\\" he said.\", \"Many of Russia's security proposals, which would require the withdrawal of U.S. and allied forces from central and eastern European countries that joined NATO after 1997, are seen as non-starters in the West.\", \"But the United States and NATO have said they will discuss the package with Russia early next year, aware that outright rejection could further inflame the crisis over Ukraine.\", \"Reuters\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"fbe3d650641f11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fbe3d650641f11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
