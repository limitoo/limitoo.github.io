On Monday, the state attorney's office argued that Kessler should not be released from prison before standing trial.\", \"Police confirmed that the remains belonged to Crone-Overholts after a photo of a tattoo on one of her legs circulated social media and her family identified her, police said. The tattoo included three hearts and the name of her son.\", \"Kessler told WFLA-TV that he met Crone-Overholts a few weeks prior at a nearby McDonald's.

According to police, a search warrant was issued on Kessler's residence and more of her blood was discovered inside and on a pair of shoes.\", \"Police also said there were several witnesses who reported seeing an older man with white hair tossing trash bags into McKay Bay on November 9.\", \"\\\"We believe it's extremely important that we let the Tampa community know that the person responsible for this heinous crime is off the streets tonight,\\\" Delgado said.\", \"According to authorities, Kessler has a prior criminal history and has been in prison \\\"several times,\\\" mostly for drug activity.
