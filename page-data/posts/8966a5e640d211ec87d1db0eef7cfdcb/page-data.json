Since we know the classic tropes from our childhood bedtime stories \\u2014 don\\u2019t deviate from the path, be wary of witches, fear trolls \\u2014 to contemporize a fairy tale is to shade these narrative standbys, coloring in the context of the time, updating the tone and plot to challenge our expectations.\", \"In 1867 Henrik Ibsen did just that, putting his own experimental, modernist spin on the Norwegian story of Peer Gynt to create a timeless narrative of self-discovery \\u2014 in the form of a five-act play in verse, no less. In Ibsen\\u2019s \\u201cPeer Gynt,\\u201d the title character is a lazy, selfish liar who is a headache to his poor, sick mother. When he goes to a wedding to steal away the bride \\u2014 an old flame \\u2014 only to fall instantly in love with another woman at the wedding, the town turns against him for his troublemaking. So he flees, and his meanderings lead him to odd characters and even odder situations \\u2014 encounters with magical beings, thieves and asylum patients.\", \"The playwright Will Eno puts his own stamp on Ibsen\\u2019s version in \\u201cGnit,\\u201d which opened at the Polonsky Shakespeare Center in Brooklyn on Sunday night. Portraying the protagonist as a listless young man on a search for self, Eno ends up with a funny story that is myopic in scope \\u2014 a self-aware and sometimes cloyingly precocious thought experiment in individualism and identity.\", \"In \\u201cGnit,\\u201d which originally premiered in the Actors Theater of Louisville in 2013, Eno translates Peer Gynt to Peter Gnit (that\\u2019s pronounced \\u201cGuh-nit\\u201d; you\\u2019re welcome) and consolidates many of the other characters so that a cast of six can represent a whole town. That\\u2019s one of the tricky parts of Ibsen\\u2019s text \\u2014 the long list of characters, the insistent verse, the constant setting shifts, the frequent and abrupt dips into the absurd and surreal.\", \"Eno\\u2019s text takes a route of calculated whimsy: Ibsen\\u2019s trolls are changed to real estate agents, characters make knowing references to the original story and the dialogue is tuned to a cheeky deadpan. Playing off Eno\\u2019s heightened sense of language and pacing, Oliver Butler opts for comically stylized direction in this production by the Theater for a New Audience. The actors\\u2019 movement and intonation are stiff and curiously robotic, and the lines move with the rapid Ping-Pong tempo of the dialogue in an episode of \\u201cGilmore Girls.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m on a journey to discover, to uncover, the authentic self,\\u201d Peter tells his mother.\", \"Her stone-dry response: \\u201cYeah? Get some milk while you\\u2019re out.\\u201d Which isn\\u2019t to say it\\u2019s not funny \\u2014 in fact, the work is genuinely hilarious, the turns are unpredictable and the performers, especially the priceless Deborah Hedwall as Mother Gynt, Jordan Bellow as several different characters, and of course Joe Curnutte in the lead role, seem to effortlessly hit their cues. (David Shih, who plays various townspeople at once, and spends most of the show in conversation with himself like a mini one-man show within the show, struggles to convey the multitude of tones and personalities and accents, and the novelty of the joke quickly wears off.)\", \"But Eno\\u2019s self-consciously idiosyncratic, academic style eventually gets old somewhere between the nuptial kidnapping and a trip to Egypt. Offbeat, Beckett-esque ruminations and existential querying are common in Eno\\u2019s works \\u2014 including the poignant \\u201cWakey, Wakey\\u201d and his popular Pulitzer Prize finalist, \\u201cThom Pain (based on nothing).\\u201d So his adaptation brings out the big-picture questions Ibsen had in his original, about the ways we form, and own up to, our \\u201cauthentic self.\\u201d Eno\\u2019s narrow and incessant philosophizing, however, quickly limits the play from exploring other themes that may have otherwise proved more fruitful.\", \"Ibsen\\u2019s incarnation of the fairy tale, for example, also works as a social satire of a community set at odds with its individuals and that emphasizes status over human empathy. Though the skeleton of that satire is visible in Eno\\u2019s version, \\u201cGnit\\u201d does little to examine or expand it from Ibsen\\u2019s time to the present. Likewise, there could be a dissection of gender, a critique of class hierarchies, a sendup of this genre of storytelling itself.\", \"There\\u2019s magic in Kimie Nishikawa\\u2019s set of verdant rolling hills with a valley in the center, and periodically the facades of little cottages descend from the ceiling. Nishikawa\\u2019s hills, which the cast members travel among, through and around as they enter and exit scenes, draw the eyes to the pastoral scene and also provide a sense of Peter\\u2019s extensive journeying.\", \"This isn\\u2019t Norway, though. And it doesn\\u2019t seem to be the 19th century either. In fact, everything about the setting and characters is vague, which leads us yet again to the question of what Eno is trying to achieve with his adaptation?\", \"\\u201cThere is a limit to the magic powers of language,\\u201d Peter says as he tells a story to his dying mother. The lesson, that cleverness can fail when wordplay and chin-stroking ruminations distract, is one that Eno himself could have taken to heart. \\u201cGnit\\u201d is brainy and full of rhetorical magic, but with more dimension and greater relevance it could be spellbinding.\"]","href_hash":"8966a5e640d211ec87d1db0eef7cfdcb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8966a5e640d211ec87d1db0eef7cfdcb"}},
