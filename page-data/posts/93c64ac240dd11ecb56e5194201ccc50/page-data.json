In San Diego, a traveler from Mexico arrived for medical treatment.\", \"Fully vaccinated travelers will be allowed to enter the U.S. if they can show proof of vaccination and a negative virus test taken within three days of travel. Unvaccinated Americans and children are exempt, but must take a test within one day of travel.\", \"Data: The loss in visitor spending amounted to nearly $300 billion, and more than one million American jobs were lost. The U.S. Travel Association does not expect international inbound travel to recover to 2019 levels until at least 2024.\", \"The basics: Here\\u2019s what you need to know.\", \"U.K.: Thousands flocked to Heathrow Airport in London on Monday for the first flights to America. Airline employees were dressed in Elvis costumes and waved flags. The mood was jubilant.\", \"Changes: Some countries are restricted by the new rules. Russia was not one of the 33 countries under the old ban, but the country\\u2019s Sputnik V vaccine is not on the list of accepted vaccines for entry. So the door to the U.S. shut for many Russians on Monday.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"Barack Obama, who helped to seal the Paris climate agreement six years ago, returned to an international climate summit to rally nations to heal the planet.\", \"\\u201cTo be honest with ourselves, yes, this is going to be really hard,\\u201d Obama said. He added: \\u201cSometimes we will be forced to settle for imperfect compromises. But at least they advance the ball down the field.\\u201d\", \"Negotiators from about 200 countries were entering Week 2 of climate talks trying to resolve big issues around money, transparency and timelines. Attendees are sharply divided over how much progress is being made.\", \"Some are optimistic, pointing to flashy new promises and heads of state coming together. Others note that the gauzy commitments with decades-long deadlines often lack the concrete details to follow through. As the Swedish activist Greta Thunberg put it, \\u201cBlah, blah, blah.\\u201d\", \"Quotable: \\u201cThe actual negotiations here are in danger of being drowned out by a blitz of news releases that get great headlines, but are often less than meets the eye,\\u201d said Mohamed Adow, director of Power Shift Africa, a research institute based in Kenya.\", \"Recap: More than 100 countries agreed to cut methane emissions. Another 130 countries vowed to halt deforestation by 2030 and committed billions. India committed to net zero emissions by 2070.\", \"International hacking experts said on Monday that Palestinians belonging to rights organizations that Israel outlawed had been targeted by spyware made by the Israeli tech firm NSO Group.\", \"It raised questions about whether the Israeli government was behind the hacking, a claim that officials there denied.\", \"NSO, which was recently blacklisted by the U.S., has been criticized for years for selling its spyware program, Pegasus, to clients that include authoritarian governments.

In: a complete disavowal of neatness, which has defined American cake making since the first recipes migrated from France in the late 1700s.\", \"These cakes allude to the millennial childhood aesthetic of Nickelodeon slime and neon signs, of brightly beaded anklets and painted macaroni necklaces. They reflect a kind of colorful, seemingly synthetic 1990s postmodernism that has likewise influenced many of today\\u2019s rising furniture and jewelry designers.\", \"That veneer of silliness doesn\\u2019t mean that these bakers shouldn\\u2019t be taken seriously.
