vaccination rate a much needed boost this past week, says an infectious diseases expert.\", \"Federal government data showed a total of 285,000 vaccines were administered across Queensland in the past seven days to Sunday.\", \"That is an increase of 15.85 per cent on the previous week, where 246,000 doses were administered for the week to November 7.\", \"However, in the five preceding weeks the total number of vaccines rolled out under the state and federal vaccination program were between 291,000 and\\u00a0322,000 \\u2014 spurred on by a regional vaccination drive in October.\", \"Mater Health Services Director of Infectious Diseases, Paul Griffin, said the increase in the past week was likely caused by the impending restrictions for the unvaccinated, which will take effect from December 17 or once 80 per cent of the population 16 years and over is fully inoculated.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I think we saw approximately 18,000 vaccinations for three consecutive days towards the end of the week, which is certainly higher than what we were seeing prior to that announcement,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"It makes sense to bring in these sorts of recommendations and it also had the desired consequence of getting those vaccine rates up for at least a few days.\\\"\", \"From mid-December,\\u00a0people who are unvaccinated will be banned from certain types of venues like pubs, clubs, cafes, restaurants, cinemas, theatres, music festivals and stadiums.\\u00a0\", \"All staff also need to be fully vaccinated.\", \"Government-owned galleries, museums and libraries will also be restricted, and only fully immunised people will be able to visit hospitals, aged care facilities, prisons and disability services.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Threat of restrictions may have encouraged young people to get jabbed</div>\", \"Dr Griffin said it was difficult to get those aged18 to 40 to come forward and get vaccinated and the incoming restrictions could have provided an incentive.\", \"\\\"Different people need different\\u00a0messages and different motivations to go and get vaccinated,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We know at the moment one of our biggest challenges is the younger age group and so making it really clear that it's going to be more challenging to go out and about in our community if you're unvaccinated certainty helped that group.\\\"\", \"AMA Queensland Director Maria Boulton said the impending restrictions for unvaccinated Queenslanders resulted in some younger people coming forward to discuss getting a vaccine.\", \"\\\"We have seen a handful of people who were sitting on the fence just come in and have a conversation about the vaccine \\u2013 and eventually get the vaccine, but we haven't seen a major rush,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"So it was people within the 30- to 45-year age bracket.\\\"\", \"Dr Boulton said she felt it was a combination of a set date for the border to fully open in December and vaccination mandates for certain industries that\\u00a0could have contributed to the vaccination dose increase this past week.\", \"\\\"Knowing there's a deadline that the borders will open and I know that a lot of occupations like\\u00a0health care, you have until December 15 to be doubled vaccinated,\\\" she said,\", \"\\\"I think that is definitely contributing and giving people a push to be vaccinated now.\", \"\\\"But I'm mostly concerned about boosters;\\u00a0we haven't seen as much of a rush for the booster as I'd like to.\", \"Nationally, Queensland has the lowest vaccination rate in the country for first doses at 82.29 per cent of those over 16 years, and second last above Western Australia for second doses with 70.54 of over-16s fully vaccinated.\", \"Dr Griffin said he was hopeful momentum for the vaccine would continue to build and could see Queensland hit the target of 80 per cent of the Queensland population over 16 fully vaccinated earlier than December 17.\", \"\\\"If we get complacent and just assume that its going to take care of itself because we have achieved the 70 per cent target early then I fear we could stagnate again and maybe not achieve the next target,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"But I really like to think we build on this, that people see this as a step in the right direction so hopefully seeing a glimpse of what the future holds will entice more people to get vaccinated.\", \"\\\"We're ahead of where anticipated by one week so I think we should definitely aim to achieve the next goal a week early, but if we keep achieving rates that exceed what was predicted then maybe it could be even an additional week earlier.\", \"\\\"So that's where that 6th of December becomes a realistic possibility, so I think we aim high here.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"fb179100464f11ec92cfe799449da590"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fb179100464f11ec92cfe799449da590"}},
