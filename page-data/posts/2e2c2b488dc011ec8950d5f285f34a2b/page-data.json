No. Should they go home? Yes.

And you can understand why that is a convention we will hold strongly to.\", \"\\\"I would hate to see in the future a situation where you have politicians seen to be instructing the police on how to manage any type of protest - and that extends to not passing judgement on operational decisions that are for them.\\\"\", \"Asked about tactics used by Parliament's Speaker Trevor Mallard over the weekend - out-of-tune music and Covid-19 vaccination ads being played to protesters - Ardern said \\\"I would also enforce the difference in our different roles here, the Speaker exists on behalf of all parliamentarians.\", \"\\\"His job is to, of course, maintain a safe place to work. Right now it is a very difficult place for people to enter and the one piece of context I'll just give is that it has not been a silent protest.\", \"\\\"What I've heard are clear anti-vaccination messages that do not align with the vast majority of New Zealanders.\", \"\\\"Media, when they've stepped onto the forecourt, have been abused and chased and called liars.\", \"\\\"So some of the rhetoric and noise coming from the protest has been pretty poor.\\\"\", \"A discussion on Mallard's tactics was \\\"not a fray\\\" Ardern wanted get into, she said.\", \"As for Covid-19 restrictions, Ardern said \\\"we've only used what's been necessary. That's why we're not using lockdowns anymore - because we now have other tools that means we don't need to use those harsher form of measures, and we will continue to move away from them.\", \"\\\"But when we're in the middle of a growing pandemic, that is not the time to move away from those things that keep us safe...\", \"\\\"When it comes to everything from the use of vaccine passes to the use of mandates, you've seen with other countries that they have been in the position to start lessening the use of those as they progress through the pandemic and got to a place where you see more stabilisation and a steady management within the health system.\", \"\\\"That is what we would move to as well. It is fairly difficult to put timelines or criteria on that when of course we are dealing with different variants that can come anytime. [I am] always loath to set up a situation you then can't follow through on because of a changing situation, so instead I give the principle: As soon as we can move away, we will move away.\", \"\\\"We've done that with lockdowns. We're opening the borders, we are easing restrictions that have been quite impactful for everyday lives.\", \"\\\"But right now, the ones we still have are going to help us get through Omicron.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"2e2c2b488dc011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2e2c2b488dc011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
