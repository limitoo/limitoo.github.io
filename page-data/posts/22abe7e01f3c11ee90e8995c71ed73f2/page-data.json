I want the best.\\\"\", \"In the \\\"Mission\\\" films, her character and Cruise's character maintain a \\\"will they or won't they\\\" tension that captivates audiences and leaves room for interpretation. Ferguson said she finds what keeps the characters apart \\\"attractive and interesting.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Tom and I ... never talk about them as an item. But I guess when we watch the film, they're so similar. They fight the same cause and yet, you have yourself constantly saying, 'But why? Why are we doing this? We could run away,'\\\" she said, \\\"There's so much connection between them. But is it sibling? Family? love? What is it? It's humanity.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"For Ferguson, the film's release this week is daunting, but also exciting, she said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Also, it's that treat of giving the audience something that I know that I loved before I was in it,\\\" she said. \\\"I waited for 'Mission: Impossible.'
