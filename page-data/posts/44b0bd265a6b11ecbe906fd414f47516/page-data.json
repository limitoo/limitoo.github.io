Fourth time\\u2019s the charm.\", \"\\u201cEvery time we delay this we\\u2019re pushing off the inevitable,\\u201d said Joan Burke, the chief people officer, in a late November interview. \\u201cAt some point in time DocuSign is going to be open.\\u201d\", \"That some point in time is no longer in January. The Omicron variant interjected. Just as companies from Ford Motor to Lyft have done in the past week, DocuSign postponed again. In place of a new date came the company\\u2019s promise to \\u201creassess our plans as 2022 unfolds.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cEmployees understand the evolving nature of what we\\u2019re dealing with makes it impossible to predict,\\u201d Ms. Burke said this month. \\u201cI can\\u2019t even remember all the dates we\\u2019ve put out there, and I\\u2019m the one who put them out there.\\u201d\", \"Return-to-office dates used to be like talismans; the chief executives who set them seemed to wield some power over the shape of the months to come. Then the dates were postponed, and postponed again. At some point the spell was broken. For many companies, office reopening plans have lost their fear factor, coming to seem like wishful thinking rather than a sign of futures filled with alarm clocks, commutes and pants that actually button. The R.T.O. date is gone. It\\u2019s been replaced with \\u201cwe\\u2019ll get back to you.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe only companies being dishonest are the ones giving employees certainty,\\u201d said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford professor who advises dozens of chief executives. \\u201cAs a parent you can hide stuff from your kids, but as a C.E.O. you can\\u2019t do that to adult employees who read the news.\\u201d\", \"Some workers have returned to their cubicles in recent months, with office occupancy across the United States rising from 33 percent in August to 40 percent this month, according to data from Kastle Systems, a building security firm. But the visions of full-scale reopenings and mandatory returns, which formed as vaccines rolled out last spring, have remained nebulous.\", \"A late August survey of 238 executives, conducted by Gartner, found that two-thirds of organizations had delayed their return to office plans because of news about coronavirus variants. Apple, Ford, CNN and Google are just a handful of the employers that announced postponements, along with Lyft, which said the earliest that workers would be required to return to the office is 2023.\", \"Earlier this fall there had been high hopes that the first quarter 2022 office reopening dates might hold up. Cushman & Wakefield, one of the world\\u2019s biggest commercial real estate companies, released a September report projecting February 2022 as an \\u201cinflection point,\\u201d when at least 70 percent of the global population would be vaccinated or previously infected with coronavirus, making R.T.O. dates easier to stick by. But some of the firm\\u2019s projections are already being tested. Its report began by laying out the assumption that \\u201cthe Delta strain represents the final wave of the pandemic.\\u201d\", \"The pandemic hasn\\u2019t been an optimal time for assumptions of any kind. Some employers went ahead and made them anyway, trying to position themselves as bold decision makers by setting concrete R.T.O. dates. Many have since given up on that level of specificity.\", \"\\u201cFolks have hedged appropriately this time around and they understand that it\\u2019s a dialogue with their employees, not a mandate,\\u201d said Zach Dunn, co-founder of the office space management platform Robin. \\u201cIf that sounds a little kumbaya, maybe. But the reality is, folks are learning that sharing the intention of their return plan is more important than sharing the plan itself.\\u201d\", \"In other words, it\\u2019s better to communicate ambiguity than to be wrong, according to Mr. Dunn. Executives are accustomed to projecting a sense of certainty about company policies, by necessity; it\\u2019s tough to get people to follow rules when even the leaders don\\u2019t believe they\\u2019re enforceable. The bumpy road to office reopenings, though, has tested that ethos of confident, rigid management.\", \"\\u201cThe average C.E.O. has very little command over the state and progress of a global pandemic,\\u201d Mr. Dunn continued. \\u201cIt feels like in a moment of crisis they should be showing leadership by sharing a clear vision for what they expect, but that\\u2019s backfired for most folks.\\u201d\", \"Julia Anas, chief people officer at Qualtrics, a Utah-based software company, is one of the executives who has soured on hard-and-fast R.T.O. timelines. In August, as her team\\u2019s optimism about the state of the virus tempered, Qualtrics delayed its plans for a September return to office indefinitely, promising to give its nearly 5,000 employees at least 30 days\\u2019 notice before they\\u2019d have to report to their desks.\", \"\\u201cWe decided as a leadership team, \\u2018what was magical about these dates?\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Anas said. \\u201cIt was extremely liberating saying, \\u2018We\\u2019re going to see how this nets out and we\\u2019re not solving for a date.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"She is unsettled by the possibility that they will still be working from home in March, two years since they first packed up their desks. But with coronavirus infections spiking, Ms. Anas is relieved that the company doesn\\u2019t have to weigh the merits of an early 2022 return, leaving workers to wait worriedly for updates.\", \"\\u201cIf we had kicked the can to January, they\\u2019d be fixated on that,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe keep focused on the work. This is just a distraction.\\u201d\", \"For many organizational leaders, addressing the anxieties of their work force has been the only constant in the R.T.O. process.\", \"With the spread of Delta, Jessica Saranich, who runs U.S. operations at the productivity software company Monday.com, got a flurry of notes from colleagues: Will we really go back to the office in August? Last month brought the news of Omicron, with a fresh set of questions: What does this mean for the January off-site gathering, with its promise of free food, partying and a Miami D. J.? Ms. Saranich\\u2019s team has delayed its return to office date three times, which has left some employees pleading for more permanence in the company\\u2019s policies.\", \"\\u201cSometimes our team will say please just make a decision, pick something, make us come back to the office or make us be remote,\\u201d Ms. Saranich said. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s not something that we want to rush. To be able to lean into the discomfort and say we don\\u2019t know is a great gift that we can give to our team.\\u201d\", \"Still, plenty of organizations aiming for an early 2022 return haven\\u2019t budged.\", \"Express Employment Professionals, a staffing provider in Oklahoma City, aims to bring half of its 300 workers back to their newly remodeled headquarters on Jan. 15. The company had originally reopened its office in July in a phased re-entry plan, which was temporarily scaled back in September. Keith McFall, chief operating officer, feels that clear R.T.O. dates serve as a force of stability for workers navigating months of tumult.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve learned that it\\u2019s best for our employees to have some certainty in their lives and an expectation of when they may have to transition from home to work,\\u201d he said, \\u201calways with the qualifier that we\\u2019d let them know 30 days before that date whether we\\u2019ll remain with that date or defer it again.\\u201d\", \"Mr. McFall has been optimistic about Express\\u2019s plan for an early 2022 return. But like other executives eager to see their employees in person, he acknowledged that the news about Omicron, which is a possibly more transmissible variant, brought with it a jolt of fresh doubt.\", \"\\u201cI probably can\\u2019t say the words I said to myself when I first heard about it,\\u201d said Marina Gonz\\u00e1lez, head of talent management at the Atlanta company Payrix, which is hoping for an early 2022 return to the office, though they have not set a date for it. \\u201cJust when you think you\\u2019ve got it all figured out, something else comes along.\\u201d\", \"The uncertainty of this period has prompted some companies to abandon more than just their R.T.O. dates.\", \"Charity: water, a nonprofit, had previously occupied 25,000 square feet in Tribeca and reopened a downsized office last spring. Scott Harrison, the organization\\u2019s chief executive, who had moved from New York City to Nashville during the pandemic, sensed that his employees wanted him to set clear expectations about when they would have to report back.\", \"\\u201cWe saw a lot of companies playing it month by month and we wanted to give our team members a much greater line of sight,\\u201d he said.\", \"But that line of sight doesn\\u2019t include an R.T.O. date. Workers weren\\u2019t making use of the office space, Mr. Harrison found. So instead of locking down a timeline for the company\\u2019s return, he picked a date of a different kind: By March 2022, Charity: water will end its lease.\"]","href_hash":"44b0bd265a6b11ecbe906fd414f47516"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"44b0bd265a6b11ecbe906fd414f47516"}},
