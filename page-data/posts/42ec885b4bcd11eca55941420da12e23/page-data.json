from areas with poor vaccination rates, according to experts.\", \"With less than four weeks to go until the borders open, Cairns, Townsville and the Gold Coast have reached the 70 per cent fully vaccinated milestone, while Mackay and Whitsunday trail behind at 65 per cent.\", \"Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council,\\u00a0said data shows holiday-makers will take health into consideration when choosing a destination.\", \"\\\"Before COVID, welfare and safety featured highly on people's considerations, but I think now it is not just high it's top of the list and we need to be very cognisant of that as an industry,\\\" Mr Gschwind said.\", \"That's not the only problem tourist destinations face, staffing shortages have been an issue since the closure of international borders and the loss of international students and travellers on working holiday visas.\", \"<img

greatly about their health and safety while travelling.\\u00a0(ABC News: Chris Gillette)</div>\", \"Mr Gschwind said while the council was \\\"absolutely supportive of the vaccine mandate\\\" some businesses were reporting further staff losses due to vaccine hesitancy.\", \"\\\"We know that staffing has been a problem for some time, it's not new, it's tough competition, not just within the industry but within the economy generally, there are just not enough people to go around,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We still have many staff that are not vaccinated and seem to be hesitant to get vaccinated, so some businesses are reporting to us that they'll struggle to have sufficient staff numbers.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Impacts on tourism towns with low vaccination

communities with low vaccination rates would feel the biggest impact from COVID when the state opens up.(ABC News: Chris Gillette)</div>\", \"Infectious diseases expert Paul Griffin said that communities with lower vaccination rates would\\u00a0see far greater impacts of the virus, including burdens on healthcare systems and\\u00a0higher mortality rates.\", \"\\\"What that really means is those people are likely to have more deaths, more intensive care admissions than we should be having in a community with a vaccine rate that's sufficiently above 80 [per cent], or even higher,\\\" he said.\", \"Gerard Fitzgerald from the School of Public Health at QUT said the virus would\\u00a0spread when the borders open because a significant proportion of the Queensland population is\\u00a0vulnerable.\", \"\\\"We've still got the children and they constitute roughly 15 per cent of the population, so they're unvaccinated and then we've got a proportion of the adult population who have chosen not to be vaccinated either yet or have chosen permanently not to be vaccinated, and that could be as high as 10 to 15 per cent,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"So for all of those reasons, roughly a third of Queensland's population is still vulnerable to catching this disease, but only a proportion of those, that is the unvaccinated adults will be at risk of severe illness.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What are tourism businesses doing to prepare?</div>\", \"Lots of work has gone into preparing the state's tourism industry for the unchartered waters ahead.\", \"COVID-safe plans are in place with a range of voluntary measures also being integrated.\", \"Mr Gschwind said operators were focused on providing safe environments because they \\\"understand it's on the mind\\\" of holiday-makers.\", \"\\\"Customer service is our business and COVID-safe customer service is just an extension of a general philosophy in our industry, so we're very well set up to focus on our customers and on our staff and we have certainly integrated all these COVID mandates and voluntary COVID measures with full enthusiasm,\\\" he said.\", \"He said that, ultimately, the best thing tourism towns can do for their economies was\\u00a0to get vaccinated.\", \"\\\"If any industry has an interest in vaccination, it surely must be ours, we were the first industry into the crisis and we may be the last out of this crisis,\\\" he said.\"]","href_hash":"42ec885b4bcd11eca55941420da12e23"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"42ec885b4bcd11eca55941420da12e23"}},
