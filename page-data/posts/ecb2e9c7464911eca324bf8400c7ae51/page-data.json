The Associated Press reported that if convicted, he faces life in prison without parole. He is pleading not guilty to the charge.\", \"Chemirmir was arrested in 2018 when 91-year-old Mary Annis Bartel survived an attack at her apartment in a senior living community in Plano, Texas. She reported a man storming into her apartment, saying \\\"don't fight me\\\" as he attempted to smother her with a pillow, then ran away with her jewelry.\", \"The next day, police tracked Chemirmir to his nearby home, where they found jewelry and cash. The discovery of a discarded jewelry box led police to Harris' home, where they found her dead, having been smothered by a pillow.\", \"Though Bartel died last year, her deposition was taped earlier, allowing jurors to hear her statements.\", \"\\\"This is a case about stalking, smothering and stealing,\\\" prosecutor Glen Fitzmartin told the jury in his opening statement.\", \"The AP reported that the defense did not make an opening statement.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932521/billy-chemirmir-murder-trial.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Billy Chemirmir's trial began November 15, for the deaths of one of 18 women he's accused of killing in Texas over a two-year span.

Over the following years, the number of people Chemirmir was accused of killing grew.\", \"Fitzmartin said jurors would also be hearing about the killing of 87-year-old Mary Brooks, who was found dead in her Richardson home in January 2018. Chemirmir has been charged in her death.\", \"Brooks' death, said Fitzmartin, had originally been called a natural death, but after an investigation following the arrest of Chemirmir, the medical examiner changed the cause of death to homicide.\", \"Fitzmartin said that the day before Brooks was found dead, she was at a Walmart, the same Walmart that Harris was at before her death later in the year. Fitzmartin said that a vehicle model known to be driven by Chemirmir was parked next to Brooks' vehicle.\", \"\\\"He follows her out of there, follows her to her house, kills her, steals from her,\\\" Fitzmartin said.\", \"Most of the victims were killed at independent living communities for older people, where Chemirmir allegedly forced his way into apartments or posed as a handyman. He's also accused of killing women in private homes, including the widow of a man he had cared for in his job as an at-home caregiver.\", \"Chemirmir's attorney has called the evidence against Chemirmir circumstantial.\"]","href_hash":"ecb2e9c7464911eca324bf8400c7ae51"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ecb2e9c7464911eca324bf8400c7ae51"}},
