Here are five ways she adds brightness, crunch, freshness and flavor.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-15T11:40:33.000Z","content":"[\"Since my Iranian-immigrant mother spent my childhood resisting assimilation, I didn\\u2019t sit down to a proper Thanksgiving dinner until my early 20s. I like to think that I\\u2019m unburdened by all the nostalgic associations that cloud everyone else\\u2019s judgment of the meal. And so I\\u2019ll say what no one else will: It\\u2019s pretty boring on the palate.\", \"Sure, I love a leftovers sandwich as much as the next person, and once I\\u2019d tasted some decent stuffing, I could get on board with that. But 20 years into Thanksgiving meals with different friends and families, I couldn\\u2019t help but notice what a bleak landscape of sameness the food always is: brown, sweet, soft, too rich or too dry, too salty or too bland. Besides cranberry sauce, which everyone ends up relying on for brightness, there\\u2019s nothing acidic \\u2014 much less anything crunchy, fresh, vibrant or even (gasp) spicy!\", \"As a champion of cooking in any shape or form, I love watching so many people excitedly get into the kitchen on Thanksgiving. I only wonder, for all the time and energy spent, wouldn\\u2019t you want to delight your taste buds a little more? With that in mind, here are five ways to make every bite of your Thanksgiving meal exciting and irresistible.\", \"I often dress roasted vegetables with a simple agrodolce, or sweet and sour, marinade. This version is inspired by sarde in saor, a classic Venetian dish whose ingredient list hints at the city\\u2019s role as a central port in the medieval spice trade. Fried sardines are topped with a mixture of saut\\u00e9ed onions, pine nuts, saffron and wine-soaked raisins, and made appealingly sweet-tart with a little sugar and vinegar. I figured that saor mixture would make an ideal accompaniment to roasted brussels sprouts, served hot or at room temperature, though you could use it on any vegetable side dish. Just finish with a little lemon and a shower of freshly chopped parsley, and prepare for some mouth-puckering delight.\", \"With so little that\\u2019s fresh and crunchy on the Thanksgiving table, salad, to me, feels essential. I love the gentle bitterness that autumn chicories like Castelfranco and Treviso radicchio offer, but fris\\u00e9e and Chioggia radicchio, which are even more readily available, are also welcome additions to the dish. They\\u2019ll all hold up well to the occasional intrusion of gravy or any other warm dishes on the plate.\", \"I usually dress chicories with rich balsamic or sherry vinaigrette, but after a neighbor served me a memorable salad she made with rice vinegar and lemon after she\\u2019d run out of everything else, I\\u2019ve taken to lightening my dressing with them. I still like to sneak in a bit of anchovy for a rumor of umami \\u2014 just enough to alert the palate and complement the Roquefort, the crunch of the pecan and the silky sweetness of the pear \\u2014 but the bright, acidic vinaigrette is such refreshing surprise, you won\\u2019t want to stop eating this salad.\", \"Sage was one of the first things I was taught to deep-fry, and I\\u2019ve never forgotten how a pass through hot oil transforms the herbs into crisp leaves. No longer leathery, they\\u2019re still perfectly aromatic, ready to crumble into a simple combination of parsley, oil, shallots and vinegar. Drizzle fried sage salsa verde over turkey, roasted vegetables, stuffing, casseroles or anything else that needs a little perking up.\", \"I can hardly get through a meal without spooning chile oil over every bite, so, of course, I want something on the Thanksgiving table to be spicy hot. Inspired by two favorite chutney recipes from the chef and anthropologist Niloufer Ichaporia King\\u2019s landmark cookbook, \\u201cMy Bombay Kitchen,\\u201d I developed a cilantro-date chutney run through with fresh ginger, jalape\\u00f1o and lime. Ginger and dates both fit in seamlessly with the sweet spices and other dried fruit that already appear on Thanksgiving menus, giving the sauce an anchor. Cilantro and lime lend freshness, while the peppers offer a much-appreciated kick. This sauce is also fantastic on leftover turkey sandwiches.\", \"Last year, the chef Nite Yun of Nyum Bai in Oakland, Calif., taught me the Cambodian method for frying shallot rings. It\\u2019s so unbelievably simple that I\\u2019ll never make them any other way. You don\\u2019t need a thermometer or any other special equipment \\u2014 just patience and a careful eye. In exchange, you\\u2019re rewarded with caramel-sweet shallots that crunch, then melt between your teeth. The frying oil the shallots leave behind is so flavorful that it\\u2019s a shame not to repurpose it, so I put it to use to make this herbed bread crumb topping \\u2014 the Thanksgiving addition I\\u2019m most excited about. Stale bread crumbs, rosemary and sage take their turns in the oil, each crisping as it cools. Then, they\\u2019re tossed with some chopped parsley, thyme and a little flaky salt. From the moment it\\u2019s done, you won\\u2019t be able to stop eating it. But if you wait, it\\u2019ll make the perfect topping for green bean casserole, potato gratin, or macaroni and cheese. Or sprinkle it atop mashed potatoes doused with gravy. Or, just put a bowl of it on the table and let people do with it what they will \\u2014 they\\u2019ll probably end up putting some on every bite.\", \"Let these principles guide you, and you\\u2019ll see: Whether you make one recipe, or all five, your meal will be more texturally varied, more flavorful and more inspiring than ever before. Don\\u2019t you think it\\u2019s the least you deserve for all the time you\\u2019ll be spending in the kitchen?\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
