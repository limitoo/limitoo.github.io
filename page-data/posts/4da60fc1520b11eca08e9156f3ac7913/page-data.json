Palestinian aid agency can't pay its 28,000 staff members this month because there isn't enough funding, the Associated Press reported.\", \"Employees for the United Nations Relief and Work Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) went on strike Monday after hearing the news their salaries won't be paid on time. They ultimately stopped their strike after mediation, Philippe Lazzarini, head of UNRWA, told reporters.\", \"The agency has $60 million toward the $100 million needed to keep the operations running until the end of the year. However, Lazzarini said he is uncertain about the timeline for the missed payment.\", \"\\\"I'm still not yet in a position to say when the November salaries will be paid,\\\" Lazzarini said.\", \"The UNRWA is responsible for helping nearly 5.7 million Palestinian refugees by running schools, food distribution programs, and most importantly health clinics during the pandemic.\", \"\\\"If UNRWA health services are compromised in the middle of a global pandemic, COVID-19 vaccination rollout will come to an end. Maternal and childcare will stop, half a million girls and boys not knowing if they can continue learning, and over two million of the poorest Palestinian refugees will not get cash and food assistance,\\\" Lazzarini said.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942528/palestine-gaza-united-nations-unrwa.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The head of the UNWRA said Tuesday that it was unable to pay its 28,000 staff members on time this month because of a major funding crisis, warning of potential cuts in vital services to millions of people amid a global pandemic.
