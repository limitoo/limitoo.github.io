It could take weeks for the committee of seven Republicans and two Democrats to delve into the crash investigation. The committee is a mix of Ravnsborg's political allies and those who have called for his ouster.\", \"Ravnsborg, a Republican who was elected to his first term as attorney general in 2018, pleaded no contest in August to a pair of misdemeanors in the crash that killed 55-year-old Joseph Boever, who was walking along a rural stretch of highway when Ravnsborg struck him with his car. Ravnsborg has insisted that he did not realize he killed a man until he returned to the scene the next day and discovered his body.\", \"Last year, officials said Ravnsborg was \\\"distracted\\\" before he drove onto a highway shoulder before the fatal crash.

Will Mortenson, who first called for Ravnsborg's impeachment in February, pushed to allow public access to the material the committee reviews. The House agreed to make public that material, with the exception of redacted confidential and \\\"nonrelevant information.\\\"\", \"\\\"This is unprecedented in state history, which means we need to be thoughtful,\\\" Mortenson said. \\\"And keep in mind the public, the family of any victims here and the subject of impeachment as well.\\\"\", \"The investigative committee had not scheduled its first meeting, but Gosch said it would meet later on Tuesday or Wednesday.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"58f86a00423211ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"58f86a00423211ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
