And do they deliver what they understand they're going to? And if something goes wrong, does the bank or insurer have a good complaints management process?\\\"\", \"She said she wanted to work with and through firms in an educative way to get \\\"an empathetic focus\\\" on consumers and investors, but she accepted that firms that could not or would not deliver good results would face enforcement of rules, to underpin investor confidence.\", \"Work on increased regulation of the insurance sector would be a leading priority this year, but she also expected increased attention of fringe financial market operators and cryptocurrency-related businesses.\", \"However, Barrass said she also needed to get up to speed with New Zealand's wholesale and retail financial markets and what consumers were experiencing in areas such as insurance.\", \"Barrass said questions about her previous employment in Gibraltar, where her tenure at the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission (GFSC) was cut short by a year, leading to an employment claim, and her acceptance of a non-executive role on the board of advisory firm PWC's UK Public Interest Body were all dealt with in the appointment process.\", \"\\\"If the question is does New Zealand have 150 percent of my time and attention, the answer's yes.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"705617348f7011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"705617348f7011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
