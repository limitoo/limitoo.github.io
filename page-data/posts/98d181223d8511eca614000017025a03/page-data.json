The only lingering problem with this hypothesis is that the measured stellar wind velocities within the superbubble seem to be inconsistent with such a mechanism.\", \"Another possible explanation for the gap in the N44 nebula is that when the massive stars that fill the region reach the end of their natural lifespans, exhausting their nuclear fuel, they explode in tremendous supernovas.\", \"As these cosmic explosions shed outer layers of material from the dying stars, researchers posit that these shells of material could be spreading outwards pushing gas like a snowplow.\", \"And just as a snowplow piles up mounds of snow at the side of the road, these supernova shells could push gas and dust to the edge of the superbubble. As this material is the fuel for star production, this means that the edge of the superbubble should be a star-forming region and thus marked by younger stars.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926116/superbubble-n44.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A superbubble forces apart the glowing hydrogen clouds, dark dust lanes, and star population of the nebula N44. Researchers aren't yet clear what caused the bubble to form.</div>\", \"NASA says that astronomers found in the direction of five o'clock around the N44 superbubble is its hottest region. This deep blue area is the location of intense star formation. Researchers have also observed a 5 million-year age gap between stars within the bubble and those at its edge.\", \"The N44 nebula and its superbubble structure are located with the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy around the Milky Way that is around 163,000 light-years away from Earth.\", \"N44 itself is located around 170,000 light-years from Earth and spans around 1,000 light-years. The nebula's glow is the result of the energization of its gas by nearby stars. This causes electrons to be stripped from atoms that make up the gas, a process called ionization. When this ionized gas cools it emits energy in the form of light.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Another Huge Void in Space</div>\", \"As titanic as the N44 superbubble is, it is still diminutive compared to another void in space that was discovered in Milky Way earlier this year.\", \"As with the superbubble in N44, the researchers who discovered this void suggested that it was formed when massive stars within it went supernova.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926173/n44-superbubble-complex.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The N44 as seen by the Prompt Telescope in Chile.
