But both vaccine measures have been subject to a slew of court challenges.\", \"At the crux of one pair of cases the Supreme Court will hear next month are the rules\\u00a0issued by OSHA\\u00a0in early November, which requires businesses with at least 100 employees to either require their workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19 or be subject to weekly testing and wear face masks. The vaccine-or-test rules was set to take effect January 4, but OSHA said it will not begin issuing citations linked to the standard before January 10 as long as an employer \\\"is exercising reasonable, good faith efforts to come into compliance\\\" with the requirements.\\u00a0\", \"The Biden administration said more than 80 million employees could be impacted by the policies. OSHA\\u00a0estimated\\u00a0the vaccine rules would save more than 6,500 workers' lives and prevent over 250,000 hospitalizations over the next six months\", \"But the new requirements were swiftly challenged in federal courts from coast to coast and ultimately consolidated in the 6th Circuit, which has 10 judges appointed by Republican presidents and five tapped by Democratic presidents.\\u00a0\", \"A split three-judge panel on the 6th Circuit then allowed the Biden administration's rules to take effect, finding the requirements are \\\"not a novel expansion of OSHA's power; it is an existing application of authority to a novel and dangerous worldwide pandemic.\\\" Judge Joan Larsen, appointed by former President Donald Trump, dissented.\", \"The second set of cases center on a rule published by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in November that laid out vaccine requirements for staff at a wide range of facilities that participate in Medicare and Medicaid. Workers covered by the rule were required to receive the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by December 6 and be fully vaccinated by January 4. The requirement does not have a daily or weekly testing option for unvaccinated workers, but does include medical and religious exemptions.\", \"The Biden administration estimated the vaccine mandate will affect more than 17 million employees in roughly 76,000 facilities.\\u00a0\", \"Numerous states challenged the vaccine mandate for health care workers in federal court, arguing Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra exceeded his authority to implement the requirement.\\u00a0\", \"In one case brought by 10 states, a federal district court in Missouri blocked enforcement of the mandate in those places, and the 8th Circuit declined to disturb the lower court's order. Then, in a separate case brought by 14 states, a federal district court in Louisiana blocked the rule from taking effect nationwide, but the 5th Circuit narrowed the scope of the order to the 14 states that together sued the Biden administration.\\u00a0\", \"The Justice Department asked the Supreme Court\\u00a0to let the administration's vaccine mandate take effect in the 24 states where its implementation is currently halted.\\u00a0\", \"The Biden administration has defended its vaccine requirements as crucial for protecting workers and patients from COVID-19, especially with the emergence of the Omicron variant. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Omicron has now overtaken Delta as the dominant strain in the U.S., making up more than 73% of cases.\\u00a0\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"06a5fa6c639611ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"06a5fa6c639611ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
