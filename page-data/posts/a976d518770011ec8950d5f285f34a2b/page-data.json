Kathy Hochul announced on Saturday.\", \"The total number of positive cases \\u2014 47,870 \\u2014 represented only 14.6 percent of the 327,427 tests reported by the state, a significant decline from the 23 percent positivity rate recorded on Jan. 2.\", \"Hospitalizations also seemed to decrease slightly, with 38 fewer hospitalizations recorded on Friday compared with the day before.\", \"This and other recent data show that the latest surge in New York driven by the Omicron variant may be starting to trend downward from a Jan. 9 peak, and that several Northeast states \\u2014 including New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island \\u2014 may be heading in the same direction.\", \"\\u201cWe are turning the corner on the winter surge, but we\\u2019re not through this yet,\\u201d Governor Hochul said in a statement on Saturday announcing the latest numbers.\", \"She added: \\u201cPlease keep getting vaccinated, getting the booster dose, getting our children vaccinated, and wearing non-cloth masks.

But it could take up to 12 days for the tests to be delivered to Americans\\u2019 homes, the officials said.\", \"The demand for at-home tests remains especially strong at a time when an average of roughly 805,000 people are still testing positive every day in the United States, according to a New York Times database.\"]","href_hash":"a976d518770011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a976d518770011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
