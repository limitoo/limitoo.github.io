A government-commissioned report released Friday said that the disparity may be attributable to lower inoculation rates among the minority groups as vaccine hesitancy still remains present in the U.K.\", \"Dr. Raghib Ali, an independent adviser on COVID-19 and ethnicity for the British government, said that the minority groups saw more deaths in the first two waves of the pandemic because of their higher risk of infection compared to white people.\", \"Recently, though, he says, \\\"we are seeing lower infection rates in ethnic minorities than in white people, but rates of hospital admissions and deaths are still higher, with the pattern now matching levels of vaccine uptake in higher risk groups.\\\"\", \"Vaccination against the virus has steeply lowered death rates among all ethnicities, according to government-commissioned research. Still, even though white people are more likely to contract the virus, Black and South Asian residents of the U.K. die from COVID-19 at higher rates, the AP reported.\", \"This may be due, at least in part, to a difference in vaccination rates between the groups, according to the AP. Roughly 90 percent of Britain's adult population has received at least one shot of a vaccine.\", \"Comparatively, less than 80 percent from Asian communities and less than two-thirds of Black adults from African or Caribbean backgrounds are at least partially vaccinated, according to the AP.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945356/uk-covid-deaths.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Black people and other racial and ethnic minority groups in the U.K. are dying from COVID-19 more frequently than their white counterparts. Above, a Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is prepared at St Charles' Centre for Health and Wellbeing in London, December 3, 2021.</div>\", \"British health officials have launched information campaigns and worked with community groups and religious leaders to combat vaccine hesitancy among ethnic minorities. Ali said they have had some success, with vaccination rates in older Black African and Pakistani people seeing the biggest increase of any group in the six months before October.\", \"The government appointed Ali after it became clear that some ethnic groups were being hit harder than others by COVID-19.\", \"Research has highlighted multiple factors. Some ethnic groups have higher prevalence of underlying health conditions and are more likely to live in large, multi-generational households. People from ethnic minorities also hold a big share of frontline jobs, such as taxi and mass transit drivers, that saw high infection rates early in the pandemic.\", \"Equalities Minister Kemi Badenoch said the \\\"understanding of how COVID-19 affects different ethnic groups has transformed since the pandemic began.\\\"\", \"\\\"We know now that factors like the job someone does, where they live, and how many people they live with, impacts how susceptible they are to the virus, and it's imperative that those more at risk get their booster vaccine,\\\" she said.\", \"The U.K. government is aiming to offer everyone 18 and up a third, booster dose of vaccine by the end of January. Health officials hope the increased protection will help keep the new Omicron variant at bay, even if it proves more resistant to vaccines than other strains.\", \"Much remains unknown about the variant, including whether it is more contagious, as some health authorities suspect, whether it makes people more seriously ill, and whether it can thwart vaccines.\", \"Britain has confirmed several dozen cases of Omicron\\u2014including a cluster linked to a concert by pop group Steps in Glasgow\\u2014and authorities say the variant is spreading in the community. However, the delta variant remains by far the dominant strain.\", \"Britain has recorded more than 145,000 coronavirus deaths, the highest toll in Europe after Russia.\", \"While several other European countries have imposed new restrictions on daily life or introduced vaccine mandates, Britain has held back, though masks are once again mandatory in shops and on public transit.\", \"Amid jitters from businesses that holiday-season trade is at risk from the new variant, the Conservative government urged people to continue to shop and socialize.\", \"\\\"The message to people, I think, is fairly straightforward which is: keep calm, carry on with your Christmas plan,\\\" Conservative Party chief Oliver Dowden said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945362/uk-vaccine-disparity.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Even though white people are more likely to contract the virus, Black and South Asian residents of the U.K. die from COVID-19 at higher rates.
