hurried bid to contain the new coronavirus\\u00a0variant.\", \"A host of countries, including Australia, Brazil, Canada Iran, Japan, Thailand and the United States, have joined others, including the European Union and the UK, in imposing\\u00a0restrictions on southern African countries in response to warnings over the transmissibility of the new variant \\u2014 against the advice of the World Health Organization (WHO).\", \"Despite the shutdown of flights, there has been increasing evidence that the variant is already spreading.\", \"Cases have been reported in travellers in Belgium, Israel and Hong Kong.\", \"Germany and the Czech Republic have also reported probable cases.\", \"\\\"Last night several Omicron-typical mutations were found in a traveller returning from South

are checking for the new variant after 61 passengers on two flights from South Africa tested positive for COVID-19.\", \"The planes arrived in the Netherlands from Johannesburg and Cape Town shortly after the Dutch government imposed a ban on flights from southern African nations.\", \"South Africa spoke out against\\u00a0the widespread travel bans and restrictions, saying\\u00a0it was being \\\"punished\\\" for detecting the variant.\", \"\\\"This latest round of travel bans is akin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants

infection than other variants.\", \"That means people who contracted COVID-19 and recovered could be subject to catching it again.\", \"It could take weeks to know if current vaccines are less

emergence of Omicron.\", \"Professor Andrew Pollard, the director of the Oxford Vaccine Group which developed the AstraZeneca vaccine, expressed cautious optimism that existing vaccines could be effective at preventing serious disease from the omicron variant.\", \"He said most of the mutations appear to be in similar regions as those in other variants.\", \"\\\"That tells you that despite
