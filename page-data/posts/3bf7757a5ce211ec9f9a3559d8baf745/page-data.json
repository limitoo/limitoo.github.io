In the Lassen and Sierra areas, forecasters predicted two to five feet of snow.\", \"The storm was also forecast to create moderate to heavy rain, gusty winds and snow across southwestern California through Tuesday. \", \"A flood watch was in effect through Tuesday evening for southern portions of the state, including coastal areas in Orange and San Diego Counties, as well as the San Bernardino Mountains. The coasts and valleys could see up to three inches of rain, while the mountains could see up to six.\", \"The rain and snow were expected to end over Southern California by Wednesday morning.\", \"Conditions across Northern California were equally terrible on Monday. Kirkwood Mountain Resort said on Twitter that it would not open because of 17 inches of snow and high winds. Wet weather also made for messy commutes, causing several crashes on Highway 99 and Interstate 5, according to ABC 10, a TV station in Sacramento. Parts of I-80 were closed because of downed power lines.\", \"The storm, despite its threat of flooding, may bring much needed rain to the drought-stricken state, where conditions are generally either extreme or exceptional, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. To make matters more dire, last month was the second-warmest November on record for California, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\", \"The bulk of California\\u2019s annual precipitation typically falls between December and March. A recent outlook from NOAA suggested that the northern and southern halves of the state may experience diverging water fortunes this winter because of La Ni\\u00f1a, a weather phenomenon that generally means drier, warmer conditions in the southern half of the United States and wetter weather in the northern half.\", \"Scientists expect that La Ni\\u00f1a this winter will lead to below-average precipitation in a large swath of California, stretching from the Bay Area to the state\\u2019s southern border. They expect warmer than average temperatures for Southern California and eastern parts of Central California.\"]","href_hash":"3bf7757a5ce211ec9f9a3559d8baf745"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3bf7757a5ce211ec9f9a3559d8baf745"}},
