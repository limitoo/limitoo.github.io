viticulturist\\u00a0Joe Vaughan planted his vines in 1996 he approached farming as he would a battlefield.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It used to be like a war zone,\\\" he said.\", \"Each week he would deploy an arsenal of pesticides and herbicides on his Tuerong property to kill unwanted weeds and bugs.\", \"Twenty-five years on his approach has completely changed.\", \"By composting locally sourced green waste, manure and the grape solids leftover from winemaking, Mr Vaughan is putting nutrients back into the soil.\", \"<img

\\\"closed-loop\\\" system, where local resources are reused instead of discarded.(ABC Melbourne: Matilda Marozzi)</div>\", \"Instead of just lawn around the vines, he is planting a variety of flowers and legumes between rows to attract insects and encourage biodiversity.\", \"When slashed the mid-row plants then provide mulch under the vines, helping to keep moisture in, reduce weeds and protect his plants from heat.\", \"These are just some of the changes Mr Vaughan has implemented in the past decade since he began learning about regenerative agriculture.\", \"As well as being environmentally friendly, regenerative farming techniques\\u00a0have\\u00a0improved the quality of his fruit and his potential for profit.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Farmers part of climate

on.\", \"Regenerative farming is part of the Mornington Peninsula Shire's\\u00a0plan to achieve its target of net zero emissions by 2040.\", \"By 2030 they are aiming to sequester 1 million tonnes of carbon locally and have 20 per cent of farms adopt regenerative practices.\", \"The shire's climate change and sustainability manager Melissa Burrage says there is a lot of support for farmers wanting to become more sustainable.\", \"Last week council sponsored a\\u00a0Zero Emissions Farming conference\\u00a0to help promote regenerative farming and demystify carbon farming and trading.\", \"With\\u00a0Western Port Catchment Landcare Network (WPCLN), they also\\u00a0ran an eight-week\\u00a0Regenerative Agriculture Training Course in 2020 and 2021.\", \"\\\"With advice from research and industry experts, and on-the-ground evidence from local farmers who have recently adopted more sustainable farming practices, we are hoping to demystify the carbon cloud and provide a clear path forward for our farmers,\\\" Ms Burrage said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/944047a0d5e547fc43f10e6a37cec492\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

sustainable agriculture manager Peter Ronalds,\\u00a0farmers across Victoria are experimenting with regenerative agriculture practices and sharing their findings with others.\", \"\\\"We are keen to support all farmers with increased knowledge,\\\" Mr Ronalds said.\", \"\\\"A lot of the principals of regenerative agriculture are as relevant to horticulture as they are to grazing \\u2014\\u00a0it is all about looking after your soils and your water and the atmosphere.\", \"Mr Ronalds has been working with Mr Vaughan to trial different regenerative farming techniques and has been measuring the amount of carbon in the soil every year since 2018.\", \"As well as seeing more immediate improvements to the quality of grapes and local biodiversity, Mr Ronalds says they are also recording \\\"small gains\\\" in the amount of carbon being stored in the soil.\", \"\\\"That's important because every tonne of carbon you put into the soil is 3.7 tonnes of carbon you've sequestered out of the atmosphere.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b80e52aa8392a64e6226d87b89af4c6c\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Joe Vaughan says he
