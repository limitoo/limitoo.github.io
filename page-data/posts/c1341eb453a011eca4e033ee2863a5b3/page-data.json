I am afraid that a reversal of Roe v. Wade will send us back to those times, leaving many women with no choice but to put themselves at great risk.\", \"I hope the Supreme Court will not turn into a political entity and, in doing so, destroy not only the lives of many women but itself as well.\", \"Marian BresselHull, Mass.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Justice Sonia Sotomayor was correct in questioning the ability of the Supreme Court to \\u201csurvive the stench\\u2019\\u2019 that overturning Roe would result in. The Republican appointees seem determined to ignore the established law on the matter of abortion and impose their personal religious beliefs on Americans.\", \"They will drag the Supreme Court into the morass of partisan politics. This disgraceful abrogation of the justices\\u2019 sworn duty to uphold the Constitution should be a warning that the Republican Party cannot be trusted to govern in a responsible manner.\", \"Bill GottdenkerMountainside, N.J.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"In answer to Chief Justice John Roberts\\u2019s question about why 15 weeks wasn\\u2019t enough time to make the choice to have an abortion, I\\u2019d like to give a partial answer based on my experiences as a counselor.\", \"An 11-year-old came in with her grandmother to learn that she was 18 weeks pregnant, not just gaining weight.\", \"A 38-year-old unattached professional woman came in to have a pregnancy test (at 22 weeks) and faced the distressing fact for her that she was actually pregnant, that not having periods was not early menopause.\", \"A wife and mother of three children learned that her husband not only was having an extramarital affair but also had two children by this other relationship. She realized that she could not cope with another child while she was making the decision to leave her husband and look for a job (some time after 15 weeks).\", \"I learned to listen, to not judge, to allow a woman the autonomy to know what was best for her.

Integrity of brain stem function has been the medical gold standard for when all human beings are considered alive. The detection of a heart rate when a patient is unresponsive, intubated and ventilated is not very helpful in determining when a human being is alive or not. Many of these patients have heart rates but are still considered to have brain death if they have no brain stem reflexes.\", \"If the Supreme Court justices want to be more accurate as to when a fetus becomes viable, they should look no further than this gold standard. In the past 10 years M.R.I. imaging of the fetal brain has provided very accurate information on the brain stem in a developing fetus. An intact brain stem, not heart rate, is the way we determine viability in humans outside the womb. Why should it be any different inside the womb?\", \"Timothy J.
