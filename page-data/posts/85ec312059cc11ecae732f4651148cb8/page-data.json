The dog had enlarged teats, suggesting it recently had puppies.\", \"RSPCA inspector Debs Beats took the dog's remains to one of the charity's animal hospitals where a vet examined it and found knife wounds on the right side of its body and back. The RSPCA said the cause of death had not been established.\", \"Beats said in a statement: \\\"It appears the poor dog has been stabbed multiple times and\\u2014due to the blood loss on the towels she was wrapped in\\u2014it is strongly suspected she bled to death.\", \"\\\"The injuries were all down one side so it would also appear the dog did not fight off the attack.\", \"The charity states on its website that those who are no longer able to care for their pets should try seeing if the seller where they got the animal would be willing to take it back, or contact an organization that has experience in rehoming and matching pets with the right owner.\", \"WARNING: Readers may find the images in the gallery below distressing\", \"If a person finds a dead animal, it should be reported to the local council, the U.K. government advises on its website.
