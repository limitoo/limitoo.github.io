He was spotted backing away from a lunging sea lion, holding his board in the air and swiping at the marine mammal.\", \"Experts say sea lions approaching people is not aggression, but rather a case of \\\"unfortunate communication\\\".\", \"\\\"It was quite avoidable with a bit of education and time to assess the situation,\\\" says Jordana Whyte, chair of the Sea Lion Trust.\", \"Whyte says the best advice for beachgoers is to pretend to ignore them.\", \"\\\"Think about young sea lions similar to young dogs - they get quite excited, so if you act loud and excited they read that as playful.\\\"\", \"Local surfer and photographer Derek Morrison reckons they're just curious. He says it takes time to know how to behave around them.\", \"\\\"A lot of people misinterpret it as aggression, and what they're doing is trying to incite you to get to play. It's about education, learning about what that sea lion is trying to do.\\\"\", \"His advice to beachgoers is to keep their distance.\", \"\\\"If they're sleeping, give them 10m space; if they're active, give them 20m. If you do encounter one, the best advice is to be boring [and] back away slowly.\\\"\", \"Harassing sea lions is no trivial matter. Under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, there's potential for a $250,000 fine or six months' imprisonment.\", \"And there will be plenty of the mammals around with the Otago Peninsula set to have a record number of pups.\", \"\\\"We're expecting a good breeding season - over 20 pups being born around Dunedin, the most we've ever had,\\\" says coastal Otago Department of Conservation ranger Jim Fyfe.\", \"Temporary restrictions for dogs could be imposed on some beaches, but for now they can share some seaside spots.\", \"\\\"We just ask people to scan the beach before letting dogs off lead. Put them back on lead within 20m of sea lion,\\\" says Whyte.\", \"It's a timely reminder the beaches don't belong to humans.\"]","href_hash":"643365ce6e2c11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"643365ce6e2c11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
