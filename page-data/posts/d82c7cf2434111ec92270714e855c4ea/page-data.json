The judge did not comment on the actual ingredients.\\u00a0\", \"The complaint filed on Monday includes findings based on DNA tests by the Barber Lab at UCLA's Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Beyond finding \\\"no detectable tuna DNA sequences whatsoever\\\" in 19 of the samples, all 20 held \\\"detectable sequences of chicken DNA,\\\" according to the complaint. Eleven samples held pork DNA and seven cattle DNA, results that run counter to Subway's marketing claims, it stated.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Defendants do not take sufficient measures to control or prevent the known risks of adulteration to its tuna products,\\\" according to the filing. \\\"They actively perpetuate actions and steps that encourage mixing or allowing non-tuna ingredients to make their way into the tuna products.\\\"\", \"Subway tuna has been taken to the lab before. A New York Times analysis in June found \\\"no amplifiable tuna DNA\\\" in its sample, but reasoned that it was processed to the point that equipment might not read the species involved. Inside Edition did find tuna in tuna samples from three Subway locations.\\u00a0\", \"Subway has been defending its tuna in the court of public opinion since early this year, even launching a webpage devoting to refuting any concerns about its tuna.\\u00a0\", \"The suit isn't the first legal dispute that raised questions about Subway's products. Ireland's Supreme Court\\u00a0last year ruled\\u00a0that the bread Subway uses in its sandwiches could not legally be called bread in that country because of its high sugar content. And in the U.S. in 2017, an appeals court\\u00a0threw out\\u00a0a class-action settlement over claims the chain's \\\"footlong subs\\\" were\\u00a0an inch shy\\u00a0of the length advertised.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"d82c7cf2434111ec92270714e855c4ea"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d82c7cf2434111ec92270714e855c4ea"}},
