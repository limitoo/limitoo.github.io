The pandemic only compounded those problems.\", \"Substitute teachers are especially in demand. At least two states, Missouri and Oregon, removed their degree requirements for would-be hires, to try to attract more substitutes. Other districts raised pay and increased benefits. When that failed, many temporarily canceled classes or turned to remote schooling.\", \"The abrupt changes sent families scrambling to find child care and extended learning losses from the pandemic. Here are a few unconventional strategies used by districts that show the extent of the problem:\", \"State employees \\u2014 including a governor and the National Guard \\u2014 are being asked to teach.\", \"In New Mexico, the governor is now a licensed substitute teacher.\", \"Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is encouraging other state employees, and the New Mexico National Guard, to follow suit. The staffing shortages in the state are so dire that state workers are also being asked to go on administrative leave to work as substitute teachers.\", \"Other state leaders are doing the same. In Oklahoma, Gov. Kevin Stitt\\u2019s executive order will let state employees work as substitutes for the remainder for the school year. One Oklahoma City bank even urged dozens of its own employees to help out.\", \"In North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper is letting state employees go on paid leave to work as substitute teachers.\", \"The new measures seem to be working \\u2014 more than 120 state employees in Oklahoma have volunteered as substitutes, and 100 state workers in New Mexico, including the National Guard, signed up to do the same.\", \"Some education departments are getting rid of application requirements altogether.\", \"Schools are campaigning to get parents into the classroom.\", \"One Central Indiana school district is on the brink of going back to virtual learning. Most of its full-time teachers are covering for one another, and other school workers are already supplementing a small pool of substitutes.\", \"The superintendent of Hamilton Southeastern Schools made an urgent request this month: asking parents to help pick up the slack. \\u201cI ask that \\u2014 if you have any time in your daily schedule \\u2014 that you will consider subbing,\\u201d Yvonne Stokes said.\", \"Families across the country are receiving calls to become substitutes. Early this month, school officials in Austin, Texas, asked parents to consider becoming substitutes. And another school district in Louisiana is also doing the same. In Palo Alto, Calif., the superintendent sent a \\u201ccall to action\\u201d to parents.\", \"\\u201cNo amount of money can solve this issue,\\u201d the superintendent, Don Austin, said. \\u201cWe need your help.\\u201d\", \"If you have more questions for Giulia or other reporters who cover education, please write to us using this form. We\\u2019re planning to try to regularly answer questions in upcoming editions of the newsletter.\", \"Funding\", \"Masks\", \"And the rest \\u2026\", \"College\", \"And the rest \\u2026\", \"A group of about 20 mothers in Boston were exhausted. So they met at the 50-yard line of a high school football field one night and screamed and screamed and screamed \\u2014 letting out some of the stress of parenting during the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cIt was so nice to feel out of control for the first time,\\u201d one of the mothers told Sarah Harmon, who organized the gathering.\", \"At the football field, Harmon signaled the start of a new round of screaming by raising two light-up unicorn wands that belong to her daughters. For 20 minutes, they screamed in different ways, laughing, competing, letting the catharsis wash over them.\", \"Mothers often have no place to escape and no time to take a break, said Dr. Ellen Vora, a psychiatrist in Manhattan. Unlike their children, they can\\u2019t have a meltdown. \\u201cIf you have two to three years of pent-up pressure,\\u201d Dr. Vora said, \\u201cgoing and being in a community of other moms and having a big release in the form of a scream is really healthy.\\u201d\", \"If you\\u2019re in Massachusetts, Harmon is now leading other screams across the state. Or, you could call The Times\\u2019s primal scream hotline, which is available to mothers who want to yell, laugh, cry or vent for a solid minute.\", \"Sign up here to get the briefing by email.\"]","href_hash":"48a4c16a7ee311ecbed35db1a1b633f4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"48a4c16a7ee311ecbed35db1a1b633f4"}},
