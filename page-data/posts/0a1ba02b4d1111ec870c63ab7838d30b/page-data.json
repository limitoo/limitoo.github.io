Their bosses can’t figure out how to bring them back.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-24T10:28:06.000Z","content":"[\"In her two decades on Wall Street, Nadia Batchelor never once thought she could do her job from home. Face-to-face meetings were a must for Ms. Batchelor, a senior executive at Jefferies, a New York investment bank. Without being in the same room as her clients and colleagues, she assumed, there was no way she could win their trust and do her job of introducing companies to potential investors.\", \"She often woke up at 4:30 a.m. to drive from her home in New Jersey, catch a bus into Manhattan, hop on the subway, squeeze in a workout and get to Jefferies\\u2019 trading floor by 7:30 a.m. Work dinners ran late into the night, and redeye flights to London were common.\", \"But after the pandemic forced Ms. Batchelor, a 42-year-old mother of three, to work from home and realize that she could manage just fine, a full return to her grueling schedule is out.\", \"\\u201cI was crazy,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that I could go back to it.\\u201d\", \"Wall Street is in revolt. Across the financial industry, at firms big and small, workers are slow-walking their return to the office. Bankers for whom working from home was once unfathomable now can\\u2019t imagine going back to the office full-time. Parents remain worried about transmitting the coronavirus to their children. Suburban dwellers are chafing at the thought of resuming long commutes. And many younger employees prefer to work remotely.\", \"The reluctance to return to office cubicles is hardly unique to the financial industry. All across America, companies are wrestling with their employees\\u2019 demands for flexibility as the pandemic reshapes the future of work. But on Wall Street \\u2014 known for its hard-charging culture that values face time and long hours, and where toughness is celebrated \\u2014 it is remarkable.\", \"One reason: Wall Street banks posted record profit and revenue during the pandemic, as government stimulus supported consumers stuck at home and companies sought to do deals, proving to bankers and traders that they have little need to work out of the office the way they used to.\", \"The attendance numbers are low. The financial industry employs 332,100 people in New York City. In October, only 27 percent of those people came in daily, according to data from a survey conducted by the Partnership for New York City, a business advocacy group.\", \"Office attendance at financial-services firms is projected to climb to 47 percent by the end of January as companies lean more heavily on staff, according to the group. Still, that\\u2019s a long way off from the 80 percent that was typical before the pandemic, accounting for employees who were traveling, on vacation or sick.\", \"\\u201cThe bigger institutions are having more difficulty getting people back,\\u201d said Kathryn S. Wylde, chief executive of the Partnership for New York City. \\u201cFrom the employer perspective, the longer this goes on, the more difficult it is to get people back, the greater their frustration.\\u201d\", \"Some large banks ordered their employees to begin returning to the office over the summer. Top bosses have been saying for months that their clients should be catered to in person, that banking is an apprenticeship business where juniors learn the ropes by observing their seniors, and that teamwork benefits all. Their orders have had mixed impact, leaving bosses flummoxed \\u2014 and in some cases, vexed.\", \"At an investing conference in June, James Gorman, the chief executive of Morgan Stanley, said: \\u201cIf you can go to a restaurant in New York City, you can come into the office.\\u201d The bank called employees in the New York metropolitan area back after Labor Day. About 65 percent of employees based in Morgan Stanley\\u2019s Times Square headquarters are now coming in at least three days a week.\", \"Mr. Gorman has recently taken a more accommodating tone, saying at an Oct. 27 town hall with employees that although spending time in the workplace was essential to maintaining the bank\\u2019s culture, \\u201cwe have learned to function very differently during the pandemic.\\u201d He said the bank would allow greater flexibility for workers.\", \"In February, the Goldman Sachs chief executive David M. Solomon called remote work an \\u201caberration\\u201d for the company\\u2019s traders. The bank asked employees to come back in June. In an emailed statement, Mr. Solomon said Goldman was among the first banks to ask workers to come back, viewing it as essential for its apprenticeship culture. \\u201cWhat is clear through the process is that we are better together than apart,\\u201d he said. Still, Goldman\\u2019s office in downtown Manhattan is staffed at about 60 percent.\", \"JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. lender, required staff to return in rotations starting in July. \\u201cPeople don\\u2019t like commuting, but so what?\\u201d Jamie Dimon, the bank\\u2019s chief executive, told The Wall Street Journal in May. Mr. Dimon has also cited instances in which the bank had lost business to competitors who visited clients in person.\", \"Most JPMorgan employees have returned to the office in recent months, with many of them on hybrid schedules, \\u201cjust as our senior management team has requested,\\u201d a bank spokesman, Brian Marchiony, wrote in an email. \\u201cIn fact, roughly half of our Midtown employees are working from our offices on any given day.\\u201d\", \"In private, many senior bank executives tasked with raising attendance among their direct reports expressed irritation. They said it was unfair for highly paid employees to keep working from home while others \\u2014 like bank tellers or building workers \\u2014 dutifully come in every day. Salaries at investment banks in the New York area averaged $438,450 in 2020, up 7.8 percent from the previous year, according to data from the office of the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli.\", \"Two senior executives, who declined to be identified discussing personnel matters, said they might push out subordinates who are not willing to come back to the office regularly. Another manager expressed frustration about a worker who refused to show up at the office, citing concern about the virus \\u2014 even though the person had recently traveled on vacation.\", \"Executives \\u201chave not felt that they could put on pressure to get people back in the office \\u2014 and those who have put on pressure have gotten real pushback,\\u201d said Ms. Wylde, of the Partnership for New York City. \\u201cFinancial services is one of those industries that are hugely competitive for talent, so nobody wants to be the bad guy.\\u201d She expects that big financial firms will eventually drive workers back into the office by dangling pay and promotions.\", \"For now, banks are resorting to coaxing and coddling.\", \"Food trucks, free meals and snacks are occasionally on offer, as are complimentary Uber and Lyft rides. Dress codes have been relaxed. Major firms have adopted safety protocols such as on-site testing and mask mandates in common areas. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Citigroup are requiring vaccinations for workers entering their offices, while Bank of America asked only inoculated staff to return after Labor Day. JPMorgan has not mandated vaccines for workers to return to the office.\", \"At Citi, which asked employees to come back for at least two days a week starting in September, offices are about 70 percent full on the days with the highest traffic. Citi, whose chief executive, Jane Fraser, started her job in the middle of the pandemic, has hired shuttle buses so that employees coming into Midtown Manhattan from suburban homes can avoid taking the subway to the bank\\u2019s downtown offices. To allay concerns about rising crime in New York, at least one other firm has hired shuttle buses to ferry people a few blocks from Pennsylvania Station to offices in Midtown, Ms. Wylde said.\", \"Remote working arrangements are also emerging as a key consideration for workers interviewing for new jobs, according to Alan Johnson, the managing director of Johnson Associates, a Wall Street compensation consultancy.\", \"Traditional banks haven\\u2019t changed their pitch much, he said: \\u201cYou have to dress up, it\\u2019s in the office five days a week, it\\u2019s just the 1990s all over again.\\u201d In contrast, younger firms offer much more flexibility in working from home, and a relaxed office dress code.\", \"Catalin Vieru joined Silicon Valley Bank, a technology-focused firm in Santa Clara, Calif., in March as a director responsible for moving the bank\\u2019s technology to the cloud. His job is fully remote, and he wouldn\\u2019t have considered anything else.\", \"Employees have proved that they can work effectively from home, Mr. Vieru said, and for them, \\u201cit\\u2019s more about a change in attitude that says: \\u2018You know what? We\\u2019re all in this together, we\\u2019re all suffering equally from this pandemic.\\u2019 Why should I go back to an office and be put back into a corner?\\u201d\", \"Jefferies, where Ms. Batchelor works, has embraced hybrid working on a longer-term basis, in sharp contrast with some of its Wall Street peers. It is allowing employees to work at home on solo tasks while also encouraging teamwork and collaboration in the office \\u2014 and even picking up the tab for group meals.\", \"On peak days, the office is at 70 percent capacity as a result, said Brian P. Friedman, Jefferies\\u2019s president. \\u201cOur approach has not been one to set a regimen or prescription, but rather to provide support and guidance and allow people to both be trusted by us, and by each other,\\u201d Mr. Friedman said.\", \"For Ms. Batchelor, Jefferies\\u2019s new policy means coming in to the office three days a week. Although she plans to travel to meetings when necessary, Ms. Batchelor said she was grateful to spend more time with her children and cut back on her long commute.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t know what I was missing,\\u201d she said.\"]","href_hash":"0a1ba02b4d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0a1ba02b4d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}},
