He was 80.\", \"The cause was Covid-19, his son, the cinematographer Benedict Neuenfels, said.\", \"Mr. Neuenfels was among the founding fathers, and arguably the leading exponent, of what came to be known as Regietheater, or \\u201cdirector\\u2019s theater,\\u201d in which the director\\u2019s vision tends to dominate the work.\", \"He abandoned performance traditions to interpret operas in light of the present, and aimed to force audiences to engage with what they saw \\u2014 which they often did with riotous booing. His style earned him the title of enfant terrible of the German opera world.\", \"He came to prominence with a production of Verdi\\u2019s \\u201cAida\\u201d for the Frankfurt Opera in 1981 that portrayed the enslaved heroine as a modern domestic servant \\u2014 mop, bucket and all.\", \"\\u201cMr. Neuenfels\\u2019s notions can be inferred from the final duet,\\u201d John Rockwell of The New York Times wrote. The temple vault in which Aida usually died turned, in this \\u201cperverse but striking\\u201d production, into \\u201cthe Egyptian wing of a museum that becomes a gas chamber.\\u201d\", \"From then on, critics habitually accused Mr. Neuenfels of violating the works he directed, rather than shedding light on them.\", \"The writer and composer James Helme Sutcliffe sputtered in Opera magazine that a \\u201cLa Forza del Destino\\u201d by Verdi at the Deutsche Oper in 1982 was a \\u201ccoldblooded murder,\\u201d an \\u201catrocity\\u201d that represented little more than \\u201ca puppy rubbing its master\\u2019s nose in his own excrement.\\u201d\", \"Little escaped Mr. Neuenfels\\u2019s critical eye. A former altar boy, he made religion a frequent target. In his staging of \\u201cIl Trovatore\\u201d in Berlin in 1996 Christ descends from the cross, his crown of thorns entwined with twinkling lights, to dance with colorfully dressed nuns.\", \"Sexual imagery became graphic and inescapable, gratuitously so to some viewers. Mozart\\u2019s \\u201cCos\\u00ec Fan Tutte\\u201d in Salzburg in 2000 found sadomasochism latent in the drama; the soprano Karita Mattila delivered her defiant aria, \\u201cCome scoglio,\\u201d holding leashes attached to men dressed in leather, chains and dog heads. His magic flute in Mozart\\u2019s opera of that name was a 3-foot phallus.\", \"But Mr. Neuenfels\\u2019s interest in opera was genuine, and he developed a deep knowledge of it. He all but abandoned the straight theater of his training and early work for the opera house and the music that transfixed him, writing librettos for operas by Adriana H\\u00f6lszky and Moritz Eggert and arranging his own \\u201cSchumann, Schubert and the Snow,\\u201d a chamber opera for the Ruhr Triennale in 2005 that set a fictional meeting of the composers to their songs.\", \"\\u201cEach libretto mainly interested me in terms of information,\\u201d Mr. Neuenfels wrote in his 2009 book \\u201cHow Much Musik do People Need?\\u201d \\u201cThe main thing, I said to myself, is that it seduced the composer into music.\\u201d\", \"Hans Neuenfels was born on May 31, 1941, in Krefeld in northwest Germany, the only child of Arthur and Marie (Frenken) Neuenfels. He started writing as a child, and immediately had a capacity to shock.\", \"\\u201cAt the age of 9 I wrote my first poems and stories, which I read to my parents,\\u201d he told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung in 2013. \\u201cI remember my father running out of the room because he didn\\u2019t like my story.\\u201d He later published a novel and made several films.\", \"Mr. Neuenfels studied at the Folkwang Hochschule in Essen from 1960 to 1964, and at the Max Reinhardt Seminar in Vienna, where he met the actress Elizabeth Trissenaar. Frequent stage collaborators, they married in 1964, the year Mr. Neuenfels made his debut as a theater director in Vienna. He had built a significant reputation by the time they jointly began an association with the Schauspiel Frankfurt in 1972, and he continued to prefer working freelance; a spell in charge of the Volksb\\u00fchne, a prominent theater in Berlin, from 1986 to 1990 was troubled by financial problems.\", \"Mr. Neuenfels knew little about opera before his debut directing one (\\u201cIl Trovatore\\u201d in Nuremberg in 1974), he wrote in a 2011 autobiography, \\u201cDas Bastardbuch.\\u201d But during his cigarette-and beer-fueled preparations, he wrote, Verdi\\u2019s music \\u201cenveloped me, penetrated me, wove itself into me so that I was convinced it would run through my veins.\\u201d He saw no similar passion in the stagings he began to watch; they made opera a \\u201csenseless and purposeless undertaking,\\u201d he surmised, aiming for no broader relevance.\", \"Mr. Neuenfels resolved to change that. Four productions followed for the Frankfurt Opera, a hotbed of radicalism in the 1970s and \\u201980s, including the infamous 1981 \\u201cAida.\\u201d He also directed Schreker\\u2019s \\u201cDie Gezeichneten\\u201d and Busoni\\u2019s \\u201cDoktor Faust,\\u201d showing an early taste for otherwise ignored dramas.\", \"As sympathetic critics saw, there was a certain integrity to much of Mr. Neuenfels\\u2019s work, which became more apparent as younger generations of directors became more extreme still. Mr. Rockwell wrote in 2001 that a \\u201cDie Fledermaus\\u201d at the Salzburg Festival was \\u201cin poor taste\\u201d and a \\u201cseething nest of hypocrisy, cruelty, sexual perversion and incipient Nazism,\\u201d but granted that it was \\u201cat least seriously intended.\\u201d\", \"Perhaps no production made Mr. Neuenfels\\u2019s underlying sincerity plainer than his rat-infested \\u201cLohengrin\\u201d for the Bayreuth Festival in 2010, which, like the Patrice Ch\\u00e9reau \\u201cRing\\u201d decades before it, was booed vigorously at its premiere but eventually became a beloved classic. At its last appearance in 2015, the Times critic Zachary Woolfe called it a \\u201cmodel of operatic direction.\\u201d\", \"Even when Mr. Neuenfels did not deliberately court controversy, though, it tended to find him.\", \"His production of Mozart\\u2019s \\u201cIdomeneo\\u201d at the Deutsche Oper caused little stir at its premiere in 2003, despite his addition of an epilogue in which the title character pulled out the decapitated heads of Poseidon, Jesus, Buddha and Muhammad.\", \"In 2006, however, the Oper canceled a planned revival. The Berlin police said the performances might pose a security risk because months earlier, a Danish newspaper had run caricatures of Muhammad, leading to worldwide protests.\", \"The cancellation provoked weeks of debate and was condemned by both Muslim leaders and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor and an opera fan, who said that \\u201cself-censorship does not help us against people who want to practice violence in the name of Islam.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Neuenfels refused to cut the scene. The performance was reinstated and passed without incident.\", \"Mr. Neuenfels noted that the fiasco showed that opera had something to say. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very good,\\u201d he told The Wall Street Journal, \\u201cthat a government would be moved to comment on the situation, which says something about the role of opera and art in general.\\u201d\", \"Along with his son, Mr. Neuenfels is survived by his wife and two grandchildren.\", \"In his 2011 interview with Deutsche Welle, Mr. Neuenfels was asked whether he had to wrestle deeply with \\u201cLohengrin,\\u201d a drama that often poses problems for directors.\", \"Responding that his Wagnerian work had at one point been \\u201calmost ecstatic,\\u201d he reflected that \\u201cdirecting really takes you to the absolute limit \\u2014 it\\u2019s almost impossible in a sense. But once you\\u2019ve gotten there, it\\u2019s a really magnificent and unique experience. Every staging should take the director to the brink of insanity.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAnd then,\\u201d he added, \\u201ccomes the next one.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"164265e089f311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"164265e089f311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
