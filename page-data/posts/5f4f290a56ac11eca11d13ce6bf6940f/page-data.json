But although Angela Merkel is handing over the chancellery to a male successor, the incoming cabinet will have more women than ever before. Half, to be exact.\", \"Olaf Scholz, the incoming chancellor, kept his election promise to appoint as many women as men to his government \\u2014 and not only that, women will run all the briefs related to security and diplomacy.\", \"Germany will have its first female foreign minister and its first female interior minister. It will also get its third female defense minister in a row.\", \"\\u201cSecurity will lie in the hands of strong women in this government,\\u201d Mr. Scholz said on Monday. Mr. Scholz, a Social Democrat, will lead a three-way coalition with the progressive Greens and libertarian Free Democrats.\", \"\\u201cWomen and men account for half the population each, so women should also get half the power,\\u201d he added. \\u201cI\\u2019m very proud that we have succeeded in realizing this.\\u201d\", \"The fact that it is Ms. Merkel\\u2019s male successor who is doing something that she never achieved herself \\u2014 gender parity in the cabinet \\u2014 speaks to the very mixed legacy on gender for Ms. Merkel, who for over a decade was the most powerful woman in the world.\", \"Ms. Merkel, a conservative, long shunned the word \\u201cfeminist.\\u201d Until her final years in power, she rarely publicly promoted the issue of advancement for women \\u2014 and women have not advanced all that much. There are notoriously few female business leaders in Germany. And even in politics, where Ms. Merkel has proved a role model for many, the number of female ministers and lawmakers on her watch was stuck at around a third.\", \"Still, many credit Ms. Merkel\\u2019s long and popular rein with the fact that Mr. Scholz and his team felt compelled to endorse gender parity.\", \"\\u201cGermany has evolved in the last few years and Ms. Merkel played a big part in that,\\u201d said Jutta Allmendinger, president of the research institute WZB Berlin Social Science Center and an expert on gender and inequality. \\u201cSo in a way, Scholz followed the call of the country.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMerkel always did her gender politics in secret,\\u201d Ms. Allmendinger said. \\u201cShe is an absolute feminist. The fact that she didn\\u2019t proclaim it publicly has to do with the fact that she probably would have lost her power.\\u201d\", \"The women who will take office this week have already made clear that they intend to put their mark on their ministries.\", \"Annalena Baerbock, the new foreign minister who ran as chancellor candidate for the Greens, has been vocal about her plan to take a tougher line toward strategic rivals like China and Russia.\", \"The incoming interior minister, Nancy Faeser, a Social Democrat from the state of Hesse, vowed Monday to \\u201cfight the biggest threat currently facing our liberal democracy: far-right extremism.\\u201d\", \"And Christine Lambrecht, who will become defense minister, promised to get Germany\\u2019s notoriously underequipped military the resources it needs and to ensure that, post-Afghanistan, missions on foreign soil would come with an \\u201cexit strategy.\\u201d\", \"Unlike Ms. Merkel, these ministers seem to have no qualms in proclaiming their feminism.\", \"\\u201cI am grateful to be part of this cabinet, a cabinet with gender parity, a cause for which I have fought for many years,\\u201d said Klara Geywitz, the new minister for housing and urban development. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an important signal for all women in our country.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"5f4f290a56ac11eca11d13ce6bf6940f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5f4f290a56ac11eca11d13ce6bf6940f"}},
