I had not gotten to do that. I thought, \\u2018Wow, what is it going to be like if we don\\u2019t ever go back to work?\\u2019 But I loved the time off. I could have gone either way: Go back to work or stay at home.\\u201d\", \"She started dating someone new, the actor Rex Linn, and she has affectionately nicknamed him \\u201cSugar Tot\\u201d to her \\u201cTater Tot.\\u201d Together, they watched \\u201cSquid Game\\u201d and \\u201cHacks\\u201d and \\u201cMare of Easttown.\\u201d They also got into documentaries \\u2014 one about hummingbirds and one about Jerry Lee Lewis.\", \"But if you try to count the projects Ms. McEntire has been a part of in 2021 alone, you\\u2019ll start to run out of fingers. She\\u2019s had a cameo in the high camp film \\u201cBarb & Star Go to Vista Del Mar\\u201d; a star-studded Spotify podcast that\\u2019s just entered its second season; a leading role in \\u201cChristmas in Tune,\\u201d on the Hallmark Channel; a continuing guest role on \\u201cYoung Sheldon\\u201d; and somewhere along the way had time to record \\u201cthree or four albums because you didn\\u2019t have anything else to do,\\u201d she said.\", \"Zooming from her home in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles in a pair of thick-rimmed Harry Potter glasses (\\u201cI got them on Amazon \\u2014 six to a pack,\\u201d she said in her thick Oklahoma accent), the 66-year-old\\u2019s iconic red hair split the difference between her emotive face and her garden, blurred by a software effect that obstructed any view but that of the country legend herself.\", \"In a way, that image is a nice metaphor for the spotlight newly trained on her. It has bathed Ms. McEntire in the sort of cultural re-appreciation glow you\\u2019d expect if she\\u2019d just won a big award or, more distressingly, died (also no, but a close brush with a crashing ceiling fan in a decaying Nashville office building she was touring in September was too close for comfort). \\u201cGot a lot of publicity,\\u201d she said, cocking her head and winking.\", \"Ms. McEntire still radiates a sincere \\u201caw, shucks\\u201d attitude that\\u2019s rippled just under the surface of her decades-long career, during which she has topped the music charts, anchored a hit TV show, appeared briefly on Broadway, and built an iconography so deep that she\\u2019s among a select few celebrities known by one name.\", \"It\\u2019s no wonder many fans sought comfort in her catalog during the pandemic, listening to songs like \\u201cThe Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia\\u201d and \\u201cI\\u2019m a Survivor,\\u201d the \\u201cReba\\u201d theme song, which became an inescapable TikTok staple last summer.\", \"Many artists would have been happy to coast from home during a global shutdown, making an easy dollar by tossing out a greatest hits compilation that would require minimal promotion and even less effort. Not Ms. McEntire. In October, she released \\u201cRevived Remixed Revisited,\\u201d a three-disc compilation of hits seen through new lenses, including her first collaboration with Dolly Parton.\", \"\\u201cThey had the idea of doing 10 songs with the band, the way we perform them in concert, 10 songs in a dance mix version, and 10 songs stripped down,\\u201d she said of her label\\u2019s pitch. \\u201cI said, \\u2018OK, there you go. We\\u2019re doing the same songs, but we\\u2019re doing them differently.\\u2019 It\\u2019s not like reselling the same thing. I don\\u2019t have a good feeling about that \\u2014 they\\u2019ve already got them! I feel that\\u2019s kind of cheating.\\u201d\", \"Ms. McEntire\\u2019s brand \\u2014 though she\\u2019d hate calling it that \\u2014 hinges on fans feeling like she\\u2019s just one of them. \\u201cIf you try to meet somebody that doesn\\u2019t like Reba, you can\\u2019t, and the reason is because she\\u2019s real,\\u201d said Ms. McEntire\\u2019s friend Kristin Chenoweth in a phone call. \\u201cI hate to talk about branding, but Reba knows her brand. She will make an audience out of you if you\\u2019re not one.\\u201d\", \"Ms. McEntire credits a small inner circle \\u2014 including Justin McIntosh, her vice president of creative and marketing; and Brett Friedman, her hair and makeup artist \\u2014 for teaching her to tap into social media once it became the only way to reach her fans.\", \"On one standout TikTok set to \\u201cI\\u2019m a Survivor,\\u201d Ms. McEntire tends to her donkeys on her Nashville farm. It\\u2019s been watched 22.8 million times since its late July upload, and she now has 2.3 million followers.\", \"Ms. McEntire\\u2019s TikTok fame isn\\u2019t her first brush with meme-ification. Twelve years ago, \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d and the Lonely Island comedy group lovingly parodied her ginger locks and twangy voice in a popular digital short. Drag queens across the country have been tossing on shake-and-go red wigs for performances of \\u201cFancy\\u201d and \\u201cConsider Me Gone\\u201d since Ms. McEntire first rose to fame in the 1980s.\", \"\\u201cIf they didn\\u2019t love the song, if they didn\\u2019t love impersonating me, that would hurt my feelings,\\u201d she said.\", \"Ms. McEntire picked up another pandemic hobby: a podcast, \\u201cLiving & Learning With Reba McEntire,\\u201d on which she is a warm and intimate host.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t hit a fourth of the things I want to talk about because one thing leads to the other,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWhen something tricks my trigger on something they said, I\\u2019ll go a different route, because I\\u2019m curious.\\u201d\", \"Guests including Ms. Parton, Ms. Chenoweth, Trisha Yearwood and Jean Smart have joined Ms. McEntire to talk about topics like legacy, love after heartbreak and staying grounded.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m an Oklahoma girl, and where I come from, there\\u2019s Jesus Christ and then there\\u2019s Reba,\\u201d Ms. Chenoweth said.\", \"In November, Ms. McEntire returned to the road with a tour she was meant to begin in March 2020. She has added some new songs and tightened some of the production and staging. \\u201cLike TikTok, our mind-set nowadays is quick, short, move on, keep my attention,\\u201d she said. The timeless hits will be there. \\u201cI\\u2019m a Survivor\\u201d will get its flowers the way it has for 20 years now. \\u201cIt is a good time to be Reba McEntire,\\u201d she said at the end of our Zoom.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve always been able to have my cake and eat it too,\\u201d she added with a cheek-to-cheek grin. \\u201cWhat I have learned is to take this moment, this minute, this hour. That took me 65 years to do. I do stray, but I\\u2019m really focusing on loving this, because if I stay out of this moment and just look forward, then I\\u2019m missing what\\u2019s happening now.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b64659bd574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b64659bd574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}},
