Tap a button, and you have your subway, bus or train ticket in hand. Another tap activates nearby bikes, scooters and mopeds. (Even the electric ones.) And another unlocks a rental car for the weekend or hails an Uber downtown.\", \"This is the pitch of \\u201cmobility as a service,\\u201d or MaaS, a late-2010s craze that took the transit world by storm. It would be \\u201cthe Netflix of transportation,\\u201d as proponents sometimes call it, one that would give you an all-access subscription to the increasingly busy world of mobility. And maybe, in turn, it would solve one of urban planning\\u2019s greatest foes: private car ownership.\", \"Like many other so-called tech disrupters, the hype of MaaS has been cooled by real-world realities. Yet efforts still exist: In late October, Austria, for example, debuted its KlimaTicket, or Climate Ticket, where one annual price gets you aboard all public transit in the country. But such innovations have been the exception to the status quo.\", \"Now, amid a pandemic that kneecapped transit ridership and renewed urgency over carbon emissions, MaaS \\u2014 or some version of it \\u2014 may be mounting a second act, though attempts at expansion face significant obstacles.\", \"The story starts in Finland. Backed by the Finnish government, Sampo Hietanen, an engineer, started Whim, the world\\u2019s first MaaS \\u201coperator,\\u201d in 2017; Helsinki was the test site. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a nice sandbox to try out things,\\u201d said Mr. Hietanen, smiling over Zoom.\", \"Whim offers \\u201cmobility packages\\u201d in Finland\\u2019s capital: The Urban 30 (originally 99 euros, about $115, a month) got you unlimited public transit rides, price-capped taxis and fixed day rates for car rentals; the Unlimited (\\u20ac500 a month), as its name implies, covered pretty much everything. Shared bikes and e-scooters have since been added, with cheaper plans for each mode.\", \"But packages take assembly. An operator, like Whim, has to corral \\u201cproviders\\u201d (say, Uber or the local subway system) under one roof \\u2014 a tricky task, to put it mildly.\", \"\\u201cThese modes are not designed to fit each other, but you need to get them onto the same service, and somehow agree to that,\\u201d Mr. Hietanen said. On a technical level, the app has to sync the systems. \\u201cThat was a tough one.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Hietanen has since founded MaaS Global, which operates Whim in Tokyo; Vienna; Antwerp, Belgium; Turku, Finland; the West Midlands region in Britain; and all of Switzerland and the Flanders region of Belgium.\", \"In Antwerp, in fact, Whim is just one of many operators offering seamless transit in app form. The city takes a market-based approach: Rather than elevating one app to users, a team there works with companies to create apps that meet users\\u2019 needs more precisely. (You will hear the term \\u201cecosystem\\u201d a lot.)\", \"\\u201cWe want to support as many players as possible,\\u201d said Stijn Vernaillen, a MaaS expert who works for Antwerp. \\u201cBut as a city, we are not going to build a MaaS application or solution and put that in the market.\\u201d\", \"This is a stark departure from the early days of MaaS, when it was envisioned that cities, with power over transit systems, would fill the role of de facto app provider. But Mr. Vernaillen said this was not a good fit.\", \"Antwerp, Europe\\u2019s second largest seaport, frequently welcomes tourists, who would then have to download an app upon visitation. Travel, too, is often regionally or nationally focused, so a city-provided app could be limited. (New York State, for example, controls the city\\u2019s subway, bus and commuter rail systems.)\", \"Then there is the question of the trips we take. An all-inclusive subscription may appeal to a regular commuter, but in the ever-expanding world of remote work, mostly local journeys that could be done by bus, bike or e-scooter would demand a different subscription.\", \"In other words: Do all people need all transit, all the time? \\u201cFor most people, that won\\u2019t be the most interesting solution,\\u201d Mr. Vernaillen said, adding, \\u201cIt\\u2019ll be more expensive to them.\\u201d\", \"Another option, one that Antwerp has adopted, is customization. KBC Mobile, the app for the major Belgian bank, allows users to book transit trips. Skipr, another operator, helps employers devise a \\u201cmobility budget\\u201d for employees, in which they can choose which aspects of their commute to cover. For example, in lieu of a company car, they can apply their monthly travel stipend on a public transit pass, if they commute regularly, or a rental for occasional trips.\", \"MaaS has had the most success in Europe, where mass transit is more central to everyday life than in the United States. But this summer, it made landfall in Pittsburgh.\", \"About a fifth of Pittsburgh residents do not have access to a car, according to census figures. In that case, said Karina Ricks, the former director of the city\\u2019s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure, \\u201cnecessity is the mother of invention.\\u201d The result is Move PGH, a platform still in its early stages.\", \"\\u201cWe looked around the country at cities where they had a plethora of different mobility offerings, and it was a little bit of chaos,\\u201d Ms. Ricks said. \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t necessarily user-friendly, either \\u2014 you needed to have a transportation graduate level understanding of these apps and systems.\\u201d\", \"So, Pittsburgh asked companies to pitch a platform that wove together its transit landscape. Spin, a shared e-bike and e-scooter company owned by Ford Motor Company, won the bid, although no public money is attached.\", \"The platform, available through the Transit app, is still in its infancy. Users can plan routes that include multiple modes like Healthy Ride (bike-sharing), Scoobi (e-mopeds) and Spin itself. Public transit and e-scooters can be paid for through the app, but for the other modes, users are redirected to individual apps. (Ms. Ricks said payment for mopeds and bike sharing would soon be done through the platform. But car rentals and car-pooling? Hopefully one day.)\", \"\\u201cThe goal that we\\u2019re working towards is actual fare integration,\\u201d Ms. Ricks said. \\u201cThat it would be working as a single system from a price standpoint. That\\u2019s the holy grail, but we\\u2019re taking baby steps to that.\\u201d\", \"Pittsburgh has created 50 \\u201cmobility hubs,\\u201d in-person locations where all the modes can be found; residents can jet off on a Spin or Scoobi from there. The city is also piloting \\u201cuniversal basic mobility,\\u201d where 50 low-income residents are being given \\u201call you can eat\\u201d access, as Ms. Ricks described it, to public transit, bike-sharing and e-scooters. Discounts for e-mopeds, car shares and car-pooling are also included.\", \"\\u201cIf people don\\u2019t need to worry about the cost of those individual services, or frankly of transportation itself \\u2014 if they can remain focused on trying to reliably get to work, doctor appointments or get their kids to school on time, and they don\\u2019t have to be price sensitive \\u2014 do we get better social outcomes from that?\\u201d asked Ms. Ricks.\", \"The question also harkens back to the original dilemma: Can MaaS lure people out of their cars?\", \"So far, the evidence of a modal shift appears shaky. In Finland, Whim and other operators never amassed a huge following, and the pandemic reportedly battered finances. The last year and a half has not been a banner time for travel routines. And 2022 may not be either.\", \"But compared to the car, a century-old invention, the concept of one-stop-shop transit is brand-new, Mr. Hietanen said; growing pains are only natural. \\u201cThe one that creates dreams is going to win this,\\u201d he added. \\u201cAnd we can create dreams. We\\u2019ll just do it in a bit of different format.\\u201d\", \"Time, then, to get creative. Can car-free transportation be bundled in other ways? There is at least one place in the United States that is making a strong attempt.\", \"In September, Culdesac Tempe, a 17-acre development outside Phoenix that calls itself \\u201cthe first car-free neighborhood built from scratch in the U.S.,\\u201d announced that residents moving in next year would have access to a mobility package that includes a Platinum Pass with Valley Metro, the local transit agency, with unlimited free rides on streetcars, buses and the light rail; free use of over 100 Bird e-scooters; and discounts on Lyft rides and Envoy electric car rentals. (There are also over 1,000 bike parking spots.) It is all included in the rent.\", \"Developers, said Lava Sunder, Culdesac Tempe\\u2019s general manager, have a long history of intermingling with transit, from building out streetcar lines to offering free parking. Theirs is just a new take on tradition.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been hearing from residents that they have different mobility preferences,\\u201d Ms. Sunder said. \\u201cThere isn\\u2019t a one-size-fits-all for mobility.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"da5450f055b511ec87fd739f19f5e80f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"da5450f055b511ec87fd739f19f5e80f"}},
