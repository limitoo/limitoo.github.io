That gave them a nearly two-point advantage over their Russian rivals Victoria Sinitsina and Nikita Katsalapov, which might be considered a hefty edge in an event where, historically, standings often do not change.\", \"Papadakis and Cizeron are the 2018 Olympic silver medalists and four-time world champions. They are seeking a gold medal that eluded them by less than a point in losing to Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir of Canada at the 2018 Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. At those Games, Papadakis experienced a wardrobe malfunction during the short, or rhythm, dance and her left breast was briefly exposed. Papadakis called it her \\u201cworst nightmare,\\u201d and it seemed to leave the couple somewhat unnerved. The French won the free dance in their Olympic debut but could not make up the deficit from the short skate and lost the gold by the slimmest of margins, 206.07 points to 205.28.\", \"Since 2018, Papadakis and Cizeron have lost only one competition \\u2014 to Sinitsa and Katsalapov \\u2014 at the 2020 European championships. The French skipped the 2021 world championships and the 2022 European championships, citing the coronavirus pandemic and a focus on the Olympics.\"]","href_hash":"90a8fb668d4311ecbaaa2f9b58284cc2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"90a8fb668d4311ecbaaa2f9b58284cc2"}},
