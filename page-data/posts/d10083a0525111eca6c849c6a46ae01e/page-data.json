electricity company is slashing its coal and gas power-plant workforce, amid a surge of cheap renewable energy.\", \"AGL has confirmed it is offering voluntary redundancies at its Victorian, South Australian and New South Wales' plants.\", \"Workers are being offered packages to leave Victorian brown coal Loy Yang A power station, which is scheduled to close in 2047.\", \"Staff at its two New South Wales' Hunter Valley coal power stations: Bayswater, scheduled to close in 2035;\\u00a0and its Liddell plant, set to close in April 2023, are also being targeted.\", \"Workers at AGL's South Australian Torrens gas plant\\u00a0have also been offered redundancies.\", \"It comes after AGL closed its B1 Torrens gas generation unit in October, with its final unit to be mothballed in September next year.\", \"An AGL spokeswoman said the company was\\u00a0trying to make a 10-per-cent cut to operational costs, and denied union reports that it was\\u00a0trying to slash 10 per cent of its staff.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e49f78ebfcd7cf6036ecd632f453d597\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The Liddell power station in NSW

director of the Victoria Energy Policy Centre, said the move could be linked AGL's planned demerger announced in July where all four power plants would be owned and operated by a newly formed company.\", \"Mr Mountain said\\u00a0AGL is\\u00a0Australia's biggest coal-fired generator\\u00a0and \\\"doesn't have a shiny future\\\".\", \"A flood of renewable energy into the market\\u00a0has lowered wholesale and retail prices and has made it\\u00a0more cost competitive for traditional power providers.\", \"<img

generators,\\u00a0that's their underlying strategic driver at the moment,\\\" Mr Mountain said.\", \"\\\"I think a major demerger like this gives them an opportunity to make decisions on staffing levels.\", \"AGL denied\\u00a0the demerger was behind the redundancies, and said\\u00a0the move\\u00a0was in response to operating conditions.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Unions call for certainty

plant.\", \"\\\"I struggle to understand how you can run a power station with less of your workforce and operate under the same conditions and same output as you can today,\\\" Gippsland Trades and Labour Council secretary Steve Dodd said.\", \"The unions\\u00a0want AGL to be more up-front with workers about when to\\u00a0expect power plants to close.\", \"In March, Energy Australia revealed it

2047,\\u00a0 its chief executive Jeff Dimery recently conceded it could close in as few as 15 years.\", \"\\\"I would call on the generators to actually consult not only with the unions and the
