The men\\u2019s qualifications that follow will spit out the names of the 12 finalists for Friday.\", \"All of that promises to be among the showcase events for the Winter Olympics, at least for American audiences curious to see what Chloe Kim will do next, and what Shaun White might do last.\", \"Kim, 21, won the gold medal four years ago in Pyeongchang, South Korea. A year later, burned out and pondering retirement, she left the public eye and went to Princeton for a year of college. She went 22 months without stepping on a snowboard, the longest break since she began riding as a toddler.\", \"A year ago, refreshed, she returned to competition and proved as dominant as ever. She arrives in China as the favorite to win, though the competition appears to have crept closer to her level.\", \"Those who think they can beat her include Maddie Mastro, a fellow Californian, and a pair of veteran Chinese riders: Liu Jiayu, 29, and Cai Xuetong, 28. Liu was the silver medalist four years ago. Cai was fifth.\", \"On the men\\u2019s side, White has a habit of stealing the spotlight, thanks to three Olympic gold medals and a disappointing fourth-place finish in 2014. This time, he comes in as a 35-year-old underdog, facing his last Olympics, and maybe his last competition.\", \"Making the podium is a possibility, but so is failing to reach the final at all.\", \"No one has raised the profile of halfpipe snowboarding more than White, with his Olympic success, mainstream popularity and steady progression of tricks. Now, though, he will struggle to keep up, as several riders, most of them from Japan, could pop triple corks \\u2014 tricks with three off-axis rotations in the mode of a corkscrew.\", \"Plopping a big trick like that in a steady run would send a rider to the final. Doing it there could land a medal.\"]","href_hash":"69b0c25a893811ec99b9f9c4a306ebc0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"69b0c25a893811ec99b9f9c4a306ebc0"}},
