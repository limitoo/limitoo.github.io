\"\\\"On the ground, we are saying we should be separated by 1.5 metres, this is of course impossible on the plane where we are basically sitting and touching another passenger.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"So before the ventilation takes effect and removes the virus potentially emitted by someone, there is enough possibility the passenger sitting next to that person will inhale it and this is happening over hours and hours of a long-haul flight, so the risk increases, there is no doubt about this.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Dr Morowska said it was important to remember the increased transmission risk of the

yourself, you need to ensure that there's a good fit,\\\" Dr Morowska said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"You can have a very good mask in terms of efficiency where the virus doesn't go through the mask, but if the mask is not fitted properly, if it's loose on the face, then \\u2026\\u00a0[the virus] is going around the mask to the face and it's not doing anything,\\\" she said.\", \"On a long flight, you have

measure,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's important in any situation, but particularly on the plane, where usually the humidity is lower than other environments, so the potential for dehydration is higher.\\\"\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Travel during the pandemic really involves a constant assessment of your risk and taking steps to reduce it.\\u00a0\", \"Dr Sisson reminds us that \\\"vaccination doesn't work the same in everyone\\\" and urges each individual to think about a scenario where they contract COVID overseas, how severe the disease could be and what they would do to look after themselves.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"\\\"There are people who are at much higher risk than others,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"So it's really important for anyone who has any concerns to make sure that they see their GP or go to a travel clinic to have an assessment if they have any health issues that they worry about in terms of their risk of COVID.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Travel insurance does

travel insurance is not available.\\u00a0For example, they're not covering COVID on multi-night cruises.\\\"\", \"Dr Morowska said once we start travelling, \\\"we will immerse ourselves in environments where there are infections\\\" and in places where there are minimal precautions taken, such as the United Kingdom.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"All the\\u00a0[infection control] measures will reduce
