This game was imposed on us by our American partners. We tried long and hard to reason with them.\\\"\", \"After a series of expulsions, both diplomatic missions had to make significant cuts to their activities. In retaliation for sanctions, Moscow banned the U.S. mission from hiring locals to support the operation, which resulted in a suspension of consular services and the issuance of visas.\", \"The U.S. State Department warned that the embassy in Moscow could stop performing most of its functions in 2022. Last month, it added Russia to a short list of countries where \\\"the political or security situation is tenuous or uncertain enough\\\" to prevent the staff from processing immigrant visa applications. Russians were designated \\\"homeless nationals\\\" who have to apply for visas in third countries.\", \"The U.S. mission has about 120 people working in Russia, a fraction of the 1,200 staffers it had in 2017, while Russia has around 230 people in the United States, excluding those working in the U.N. mission in New York.\", \"The United States still has time to prevent a retaliatory expulsion of its diplomats from Russia, Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said Wednesday when commenting on the announcement.\", \"\\\"Of course, there is still time,\\\" he said, according to TASS. \\\"Our response will be symmetrical, and the same number of American personnel will leave our country based on the same principle: Those who 'overstay' their three-year term of service.\\\"\", \"Ryabkov said Russia proposed the U.S cancel these requirements as \\\"it goes against the current practice and is interference in our own independent decisions.\\\"\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"9449cc9a52cf11ecaf9ee70967cbbb6d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9449cc9a52cf11ecaf9ee70967cbbb6d"}},
