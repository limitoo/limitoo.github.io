Tales abound of Silicon Valley types moving home to Miami and Seattle, or renting acres of land in Idaho.\", \"The story goes like this: The coronavirus and the ability to work remotely have fundamentally reshaped where we want to live \\u2014 and large California cities, particularly Los Angeles and San Francisco, are not on the list.\", \"But is any of that actually true?\", \"I\\u2019ll start with the short answer. There hasn\\u2019t been an exodus from California, but pandemic forces have shifted where people reside within the state. Those patterns of relocation mirror what we were already seeing before Covid-19, but on overdrive.\", \"Here\\u2019s how this shakes out.\", \"California\\u2019s population declined slightly in 2020, but it wasn\\u2019t because of a mass migration to other states. To blame are coronavirus deaths, a lower birthrate and fewer international arrivals.\", \"In fact, 82 percent of Californians who moved last year stayed in the state, according to a report from the California Policy Lab. That figure has been basically stable over the past five years.\", \"\\u201cA lot more people are moving around within the state than they are out of the state,\\u201d Eric McGhee, a senior fellow with the Public Policy Institute of California, told me. \\u201cThat movement tends to be within a certain metropolitan area, and a lot of that is people moving to suburbs and exurbs.\\u201d\", \"Californians are likely to move from Los Angeles to the Inland Empire or from San Francisco to the fringes of the Bay Area or the Sacramento region, McGhee said. That\\u2019s because they want cheaper housing but don\\u2019t want to end up so far away that they need to change jobs.\", \"It\\u2019s been that way for a long time. These were the largest county-to-county net migrations in California between 2015 and 2019, according to census data:\", \"With the emergence of the pandemic in 2020, some of these trends kicked into high gear.\", \"The Inland Empire tied Phoenix in 2020 for the biggest gain in households from migration nationwide, The Wall Street Journal recently reported. The flow of humanity into Riverside and San Bernardino Counties increased by 50 percent compared with the previous year.\", \"This reflects Californians\\u2019 desire to escape the exorbitant home prices of more coastal regions. In Riverside County, the median single-family home price in August was $570,000, compared with $830,070 in Los Angeles County and $1.85 million in San Francisco.\", \"As my colleagues noted in a recent analysis, pricey San Francisco experienced one of the most significant exoduses of the pandemic. While \\u201cmigration patterns during the pandemic have looked a lot like migration patterns before it,\\u201d that wasn\\u2019t the case for San Francisco, they wrote.\", \"In the city, net exits \\u2014 the number of people leaving minus the number of people arriving \\u2014 increased to 38,800 in the last three quarters of 2020, compared with 5,200 during the same time the previous year, according to the California Policy Lab report. The city lost one-eighth of its total households last year by some estimates.\", \"But perhaps this is good news for those us of fighting the myth of a California exodus: Two-thirds of San Franciscans who fled landed in other parts of the Bay Area and 80 percent stayed in the state.\", \"For more:\", \"A gently seasoned pot of rice and lentils is the perfect antidote to holiday feasting.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from Curtis Ridling:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
