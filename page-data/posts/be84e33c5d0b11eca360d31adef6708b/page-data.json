In fact, many self-described progressives are all but foaming at the mouth with rage at President Biden, who took pains to distance himself from them during his campaign.\", \"It\\u2019s a wonder that the left, or even moderates like President Biden, can ever get anything done when Republicans stand shoulder to shoulder against them and are joined by at least a few \\u201cbipartisan-minded\\u201d Democrats.\", \"Right now Mr. Biden is playing the hand he\\u2019s been dealt, and it\\u2019s a lousy one. It may get worse, too, if Republicans retake the House and the Senate next year as appears all too likely. But that\\u2019s what leadership is about \\u2014 not winning when winning is easy, but inspiring people to fight when it\\u2019s hard. At least Mr. Biden isn\\u2019t whining that everyone\\u2019s plotting against him, even though he surely knows a lot of people really are.\", \"Eric B. LippsStaten Island\", \"To the Editor:\", \"I do not see President Biden as \\u201cstuck,\\u201d and am increasingly impressed by his competence. I am deeply concerned about the number of articles and opinion pieces in The New York Times, The Washington Post and other media that express disappointment with his leadership.\", \"This has been an astonishingly successful 2021 so far. The press rarely seems to focus on Mr. Biden\\u2019s many accomplishments. Are you trying to create disappointment in an accomplished, professional, capable president as he deals with multiple catastrophes competently? Puzzled. Very puzzled.\", \"Debra SeegersAnderson, S.C.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Corey Robin makes many excellent points, but to my mind the real disappointment is that the Democrats failed to come together quickly after the election. The Republican Party is clearly bent on destroying our democracy and causing massive suffering just to benefit their rich friends.\", \"I thought President Biden\\u2019s core legislation, including Build Back Better, were good compromises between the center and left of the party and should have been quickly embraced \\u2014 or, if Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema really felt the need to flex their power, then they should have demanded some very precise cuts early and then helped get the legislation passed.\", \"Instead, while as the author notes some important portions of Mr. Biden\\u2019s agenda have gotten through, several major initiatives have not, and that will make it easier for the Republicans to win seats in Congress in November and do terrible damage to our nation.\", \"Richard DineSilver Spring, Md.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Corey Robin\\u2019s statement about \\u201cthe growing fear that the Republicans will ride back into the halls of power and slam the doors of democracy behind them, maybe forever\\u201d is another example of overstatement meant to strike further fear into the hearts of progressives.\", \"However, when those in the middle hear another shrill scream like this, it only elicits a yawn and further confirms for them that many on the left have lost perspective.\", \"It is President Biden\\u2019s listening to those wailing sirens\\u2019 calls that have him \\u201cstuck.\\u201d\", \"J. Matthew McGloneTowson, Md.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cMeadows Faces Contempt of Congress Charge\\u201d (front page, Dec. 14):\", \"Mark Meadows says he will not testify before Congress\\u2019s Jan. 6 committee. If he and for that matter others such as Jeffrey Clark and Steve Bannon are proud of the role they played in the waning days of the Trump administration, why not testify and tout their good citizenship? These are not humble individuals.\", \"To not seize the bully pulpit presented by the House committee to extol the virtues of their actions speaks volumes \\u2014 that rather than pride in their actions, they are at a minimum afraid of eventual prosecution, and likely ashamed of the role they played. And rightly so.\", \"It seems to be more and more clear that their actions went a long way toward facilitating an attempted coup. By not testifying, they are tacitly agreeing with that conclusion, and adding cowardice to their growing list of personal embarrassments.\", \"Barry LurieBala Cynwyd, Pa.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cCalifornia Lawmakers Position the State to Become a \\u2018Refuge\\u2019 of Abortion Rights\\u201d (news article, Dec. 9):\", \"State Senator Toni Atkins is to be applauded for her efforts to ensure abortion rights. When we were in college in the 1960s, a friend needed an abortion. She needed a few hundred dollars to go to another state, because in pre-Roe Massachusetts she could not get one. Although cash-poor students, we were able to scrape together the money for her, and have always been proud that we did.\", \"Now the Supreme Court is poised to send us all back 50 years to a Balkanized set of state laws limiting access to abortion. We are ashamed for our country and determined, once again, that state law not be allowed to limit the right to an abortion.\", \"We plan to make it our job to help fund those programs in those states that will help women get the care they need, wherever they live. The folks in Mississippi and elsewhere should not be allowed to hold pregnant women captive. All that is needed is a plane ticket to free them.
