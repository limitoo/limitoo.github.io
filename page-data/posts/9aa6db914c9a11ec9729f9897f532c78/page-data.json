(He filmed it in his New Orleans hometown.) Three were for his work on the Pixar movie \\u201cSoul,\\u201d which won an Academy Award earlier this year for best score.\", \"Batiste, 35, appears nightly as the bandleader on \\u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert,\\u201d and over the last year and a half, he has become familiar face during times of crisis. When the pandemic shut down indoor performing arts venues, Batiste played in the open air. And when protesters hit the streets after the murder of George Floyd last year to rally against racism and police violence, Batiste staged a series of protest concerts, leading crowds of people in song.\", \"Batiste chatted in a phone interview shortly after the nominations were announced on Tuesday. The following are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"With \\u201cWe Are,\\u201d you set out to make an album that didn\\u2019t fit into any one genre, and as a result, you were nominated in three genres, as well as the general categories. Did your mission for the album succeed?\", \"It was so rewarding to be nominated in multiple categories and multiple genres. And of course, for the two big categories in the general field. I\\u2019ve always made an effort to show that the genres are all connected, just like people in all of our lineages are connected. I\\u2019ve said that many times, and it just feels so great for it to be recognized on music\\u2019s biggest stage.\", \"How does it feel to be the most nominated artist in any genre?\", \"My goodness, I\\u2019m so over the moon. We made this album throughout the pandemic and we had so many things going on. We recorded the soundtrack and the score for \\u201cSoul\\u201d during the pandemic. It was so much. You always put your blood, sweat and tears into the craft of making an album, but it was doubly so during that time.\", \"You released an early iteration of the title track, \\u201cWe Are,\\u201d in June 2020 as you were in the middle of crafting the album. Why did you make that decision?\", \"\\u201cWe Are\\u201d is a song that features my grandfather, who is an incredible activist. He\\u2019s somebody who grew up during the Memphis sanitation strike. He was a protester, he was somebody who basically fought for the rights for me to be able to be where I am today. And he\\u2019s on the record.\", \"The lyrics in that record reference all of the things that we were fighting to maintain during the protest for Black lives. So it was really just one of those things where I made the song, not knowing that the moment would come for the song before the album was finished.\", \"Did the experience of performing the song in the context of protests shape the final version that was nominated for the Grammy? Did it evolve any more after that?\", \"No, it actually didn\\u2019t because it was already so much of the spirit of the moment. I didn\\u2019t have to do anything to it.\", \"Over the past year and a half, you\\u2019ve spent a lot of time playing outdoors for the public, whether at protests in the summer of 2020 or roaming performances during some of the worst months of the pandemic. How did these events change how you see yourself as an artist?\", \"It made me realize that music is bigger than the entertainment structure, it\\u2019s bigger than commerce, it\\u2019s bigger than a marketing or business plan. Music is something that\\u2019s used from the beginning of time, going all the way back to the first communities, as glue within communities, as part of the fabric of everyday life. It brings people together and it\\u2019s used as something to transmit wisdom from generations, to pass on traditions and give people hope. It connects us to the sacred, the divine. I\\u2019m not against music as entertainment, but I think if we remember the origin of what music is all about and what it can be used for, it would be very useful in this time.\", \"You\\u2019ve also said that the album reflects the passage of your life thus far. What does the album say about where you were in your life when you recorded it?\", \"It\\u2019s me coming into myself. You go through this process of resurrection as an artist, you go through a birth and a rebirth and a rebirth and you\\u2019re constantly becoming. And I was at this transitional point and the album was a time stamp of that moment of being reborn. So I really believe that when I look back on this album in 15, 20, 30 years \\u2014 God willing \\u2014 I\\u2019ll be able to, to appreciate it in a different way, because I\\u2019ll have gone through similar rebirths, but none will be the same.\"]","href_hash":"9aa6db914c9a11ec9729f9897f532c78"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9aa6db914c9a11ec9729f9897f532c78"}},
