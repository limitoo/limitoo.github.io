Testing for these people has been dropped altogether.\", \"The Chief Minister says the government is now confident the testing and tracing regime is solid enough to \\\"isolate any household contacts extremely quickly in the event of a positive case\\\".\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What is a red zone?</div>\", \"In September the NT government announced its roadmap to reopening that included a traffic light system for travel.\", \"The Northern Territory's Deputy Chief Health Officer, Charles Pain, on Saturday said a region would be declared a red zone if there was evidence of community transmission of the virus on a \\\"widespread scale\\\".\", \"So, if it's a hotspot, it will be classified as a red zone.\", \"\\\"Green zones are where we have comfort that there is a low risk of transmission,\\\" Dr Pain said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Is this a good idea amid an outbreak?</div>\", \"The Chief Minister thinks so.\", \"It mainly comes down to something called rapid antigen testing and the safeguard ushered in by locking the unvaccinated out.\", \"Mr Gunner says the ability to now rapidly test people when they arrive\\u00a0at airports is a \\\"game changer\\\" that \\\"makes a big difference to the risk matrix\\\".\", \"\\\"It gives us an extra layer of protection\\u00a0and gives us the confidence to start moving away from home quarantine.\\\"\", \"According to Mr Gunner, until now, mass testing of arrivals was not a viable option because rapid antigen tests \\u2014\\u00a0much faster with a 15-minute turnaround, but less accurate than the \\\"gold standard\\\" PCR tests \\u2014\\u00a0were not available at scale.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7281dc7be4404c79f1ac4c05e7ad8116\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> A COVID-19 rapid response team has been deployed to the locked-down community of Rockhole.(ABC News: Michael Franchi)</div>\", \"But from tomorrow, all NT airports will have the capacity for rapid testing, and all arrivals will be required to take a test.\", \"Rapid antigen tests were contentiously phased out for staff working at Howard Springs earlier in the year, and they were replaced with PCR saliva-only tests.\\u00a0\", \"Questioned on this at the press conference, Mr Gunner provided assurances PCR tests would remain in play as the Territory's number one measure and would\\u00a0be used if you returned a positive result to a rapid antigen test.\", \"The Territory won't be the only jurisdiction to take this leap.\", \"From December 17, when the state is due to reach its 80 per cent vaccination target, Queensland will open its border to interstate travellers \\u2014 but only if they are fully vaccinated.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What will happen

rules usher in a suite of restrictions for Territorians who are yet to be vaccinated, and even put fines on the table.\", \"Unvaccinated NT residents won't be locked out of the Territory, but they'll have to undergo 14 days of supervised quarantine at their own expense to get back in, ruling out home quarantine.\", \"Unvaccinated arrivals to an airport or a road border will be fined and turned around.\", \"Mr Gunner said the latest COVID-19 outbreak was a reminder that the risk was too great.\", \"\\\"This has all happened because someone who wasn't fully vaccinated came here with COVID,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"If you are not a returning Territory resident and you are eligible to be vaccinated and you are not fully vaccinated, then you don't get to come to the Territory.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Is quarantine-free Christmas travel on the cards?</div>\", \"Hopefully, yes.\", \"If the next four weeks go well, Territorians will be able to fly home for festive family reunions with the knowledge they can easily return after the holidays,\\u00a0abolishing quarantine a month ahead of the plan.\", \"Mr Gunner says that over the next month the government will make sure the system works, while also increasing testing capabilities at airports.\", \"From December 20, every single person who enters the Territory will take\\u00a0a rapid antigen test on arrival.\",
