that into sharp relief.\\u00a0\", \"Hospital emergency departments have been places of acute pressure, where the impacts of bed shortages are most keenly felt.\", \"But with Tasmania's borders reopening on December 15, there is trepidation among hospital staff about how an already stretched health system will cope.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"There is a level of anxiety among my colleagues because we know that COVID is at the front door,\\\" said Tom Millen, an Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (ANMF) representative in the Launceston General Hospital's emergency department.\\u00a0\", \"Tasmanian secretary of health Kathrine Morgan-Wicks said there would be changes to how hospitals operated to reduce the risk of transmission, with every person presenting at an emergency department treated as potentially infectious.\", \"\\\"You will see some changes in our hospital environment, which may include triage external to the emergency department in open conditions while we do a rapid antigen test, for example,\\u00a0if you are presenting with respiratory symptoms,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"<img

department admissions processes to prevent COVID transmission.(ABC News: Luke Bowden)</div>\", \"Dr Juan Ascensio-Lane, the Tasmanian chair of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, warned Tasmanians to be prepared for changes, regardless of how well-prepared the health system is.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"On a day-to-day basis things will change, it's hard to predict, we can look to Victoria and New South Wales for the lessons learnt there,\\\" he said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Retention concerns remain despite increased recruitment</div>\", \"There have been additional resources poured into the system for the expected surge in demand once COVID-19 is circulating in the community, including an additional 152 beds and 840 full-time-equivalent staff.\\u00a0\", \"Ms Morgan-Wicks said these measures were\\u00a0already easing pressure on the state's emergency departments.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Over the last four weeks we've actually had quite lower escalation, particularly at our Royal Hobart emergency department,\\\" Ms Morgan-Wicks said.\\u00a0\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/8e9c6b7e390ff3199fe5c2d693c585fc\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

Millen said it was\\u00a0not enough to offset the numbers of skilled, experienced staff leaving nursing or reducing their hours in the past 12 months.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"You can't train up new staff quickly, the government's been doing pretty well on recruitment but it's failed miserably on retention and we are losing skilled staff so rapidly, it's like a revolving door,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\",

has not been enough consideration given to workforce planning \\u2014 including how the workforce will be filled when health staff have to isolate if they contract the virus.\", \"Staffing was a major challenge in the 2020 north-west COVID outbreak, which saw the closure of the North West Regional and North West Private hospitals.\", \"During the shutdown, 1,300 staff were put into quarantine for two weeks to stamp out the virus.\\u00a0\", \"This time around, vaccinations are available and have been made mandatory for all health workers to reduce potential transmission of the virus\\u00a0and severe symptoms.\\u00a0\", \"The isolation period for the fully vaccinated health workforce is 10 days, instead of the\\u00a0previous 14 days \\u2014 the same time period for the general population who are unvaccinated against COVID.\", \"If health workers become close contacts as a result of exposure in a healthcare setting, or there is a breach of personal protective equipment, that will be examined at the time.\\u00a0\", \"Ms Morgan-Wicks said public health authorities were\\u00a0relying on having a fully vaccinated health workforce and taking a precautionary approach to using PPE to ensure large numbers of staff were not\\u00a0taken out of the system.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"For high-risk areas, it will be the use of N95 masks and goggles, which then means under the furloughing policy that it is a low-risk treatment and they are able to continue to work in most cases,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"<img

year, that shows for breast [cancer], for cervical cancer, for colorectal cancer, screening has decreased by some 40 per cent compared to pre-COVID,\\\" oncologist Dr Stan Gauden said.\\u00a0\",
