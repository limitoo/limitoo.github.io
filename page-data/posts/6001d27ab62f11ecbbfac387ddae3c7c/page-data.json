Putting out an open letter like this is just a stunt.\\\"\", \"Dr Laking said the Authority is simply a way of solving a problem that we all know exists.\", \"\\\"It is quite a straight forward way of doing it - which is bringing the experts to remedy the problem that we have, it is logical to put the commissioning power into the hands that understand it the best.\\\" Laking said.\", \"\\\"If they [Act] want to use plane analogies, well it is desirable to entrust the flying of the plane to the pilots who understand what is at stake with the business.
