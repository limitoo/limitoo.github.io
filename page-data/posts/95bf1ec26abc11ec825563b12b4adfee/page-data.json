He has continually denied the allegations.\", \"In an interview with BBC Newsnight in 2019, Prince Andrew said he was at a Pizza Express restaurant in Woking, United Kingdom, on the night in 2001 when it's alleged he had sex with Giuffre. He also claimed he never got sweaty on a dancefloor with her - which Giuffre alleges he did. The prince says there was a \\\"problem\\\" with her account because he had an \\\"overdose of adrenaline in the Falklands war when I was shot at\\\", rendering it \\\"impossible\\\" for him to sweat.\", \"Giuffre's lawyers want him to provide any documents relating to anyone he met at the Pizza Express or club Tramp in London, including his travel to and from those places.\", \"\\\"If Prince Andrew truly has no documents concerning his communications with Maxwell or Epstein, his travel to Florida, New York, or various locations in London, his alleged medical inability to sweat, or anything that would support the alibis he gave during his BBC interview, then continuing with discovery will not be burdensome to him at all,\\\" the filed court documents from Giuffre's lawyers say, according to the Guardian.\\u00a0\", \"Prince Andrew's lawyers say he objected to the request \\\"on the grounds that it is harassing and seeks confidential and private information and documents that are irrelevant, immaterial and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence\\\".\", \"His lawyers add that he has no such documents in his possession to hand over.\", \"In a separate development, a request by Prince Andrew's lawyer's to pause the legal proceedings against him has been turned down by a US judge. His lawyer's wanted Giuffre to take part in a two-hour deposition to discuss her country of residence since she's been living in Western Australia, arguing this may disqualify her from filing a lawsuit in a US court.\", \"Giuffre's lawyers called the prince's request a \\\"tired\\\" and \\\"transparent\\\" attempt to dodge document disclosures.\", \"US judges have also ruled that a confidential 2009 settlement agreement between Epstein and Giuffre, which may have also referenced Prince Andrew, should be released publicly next week.\", \"Maxwell, a British socialite, was found guilty on five out of six charges relating to her role in recruiting and trafficking young girls to be sexually abused by Epstein.\"]","href_hash":"95bf1ec26abc11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"95bf1ec26abc11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
