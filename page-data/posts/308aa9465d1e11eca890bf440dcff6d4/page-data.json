Of those cases, 94 percent were confirmed this week. Monday's 227 new positive cases and Tuesday's 214 new positive cases have raised Cornell's weekly positivity rate to just over 3 percent.\", \"Under the new alert level, all final exams will move online as of noon, December 14, and all in-person university activities have been canceled, including the December 18 ceremony for winter graduates.\", \"Cornell will also close libraries, fitness centers and gyms but will keep offices and labs open. Undergraduate students are not supposed to participate in any work-study or lab work at this time.\", \"\\\"While I want to provide reassurance that, to date, we have not seen severe illness in any of our infected students, we do have a role to play in reducing the spread of the disease in the broader community,\\\" Pollack said. \\\"The fact that we have not experienced severe illness among our student population may lead some to ask why we are imposing such serious steps.\\\"\", \"As of Tuesday, 97 percent of Cornell's on-campus population is fully vaccinated.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1951886/cornell-covid-outbreak-campus-college.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Cornell University announced it would move to a new alert level on Tuesday after a massive coronavirus outbreak over the weekend.
