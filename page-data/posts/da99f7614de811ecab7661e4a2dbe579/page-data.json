That\\u2019s the gist of \\u201cBurning,\\u201d which focuses on that country\\u2019s sadly familiar experiences with warming temperatures: terrifying wildfires, drill-baby-drill politicians, and activists desperately trying to save us all by pointing out the facts about the future.\", \"The big difference is that Australia\\u2019s fires are the biggest: Over 50 million acres burned during its so-called \\u201cBlack Summer\\u201d (2019-20), dwarfing losses in California or the Amazon. The director, Eva Orner (\\u201cChasing Asylum\\u201d), makes her contribution to documentaries on climate change by sticking to Australia and underlining the visceral impact on Australians. It\\u2019s hellish: red skies and dark days, fear and helplessness, pregnancy complications and death.\", \"Orner\\u2019s flood of talking heads and footage from the field (including beleaguered locals and sickly koalas) settles into a drumbeat of worry \\u2014 justified, obviously, but numbing. The film also suffers by comparison with a more complex and stimulating look at climate change, Lucy Walker\\u2019s alarming \\u201cBring Your Own Brigade.\\u201d But the young activist Daisy Jeffrey does provide this film with a smart rebel leader, versus Australia\\u2019s prime minister, Scott Morrison, and his coal-friendly politicking.\", \"Like many environmental docs, Orner holds up a possible savior (a tech billionaire pitching a pivot to renewables) and a prelapsarian vision (the Aboriginal stewardship of the land before European arrival). Her film is ultimately another in a series of distress signals for the world, with the hope that Australia doesn\\u2019t become a continent-sized Cassandra.\"]","href_hash":"da99f7614de811ecab7661e4a2dbe579"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"da99f7614de811ecab7661e4a2dbe579"}},
