Two of the defendants were acquitted on all charges, while the jury deadlocked on two other defendants, resulting in a mistrial for those counts.\", \"Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta were both found not guilty. The charges against Adam Fox and Barry Croft, Jr. were declared \\\"no verdict\\\" and Judge James Jonker has declared a mistrial on those counts.\", \"Friday morning, jurors sent a note to the judge saying they had reached agreement on several counts but were deadlocked on others. The judge sent them back to continue their deliberations, encouraging them to \\\"take another look, a fresh look.\\\" But the jury returned several hours later to say they were still unable to reach a verdict on some counts.\", \"The jury, made up of six men and six women, elected a foreperson last week and began deliberating Monday after two weeks of primarily prosecution testimony. Adam Fox, Barry Croft Jr., Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta are charged with conspiracy, accused by prosecutors of being angry over\\u00a0COVID-19\\u00a0restrictions imposed by the Democratic governor and seeking to ignite a civil war.\", \"Three of the men also faced weapons charges. Two other defendants\\u00a0previously pleaded guilty and cooperated with investigators.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"They were filled with rage,\\\" Kessler told jurors in closing arguments last Friday, the 15th day of trial in federal court in Grand Rapids, Michigan. \\\"They were paranoid because they knew what they were doing was wrong and they feared they could be caught.\\\"\", \"The men were arrested in October 2020 amid talk of raising $4,000 for an explosive that could blow up a bridge and stymie police after a kidnapping, according to trial evidence. Fox twice traveled to northern Michigan to scout the area.\", \"Only one defendant,\\u00a0Harris, chose to testify in his own defense, and the four men deny any scheme to get Whitmer at her vacation home. Defense attorneys insist they were under the spell of informants and agents who got them to say and do violent, provocative things.\", \"Fox's attorney, Christopher Gibbons, said Fox was a hapless man living in the basement of a Grand Rapids-area vacuum shop, smoking marijuana whenever possible and totally incapable of leading the wild plot.\", \"\\\"The plan was utter nonsense. It wasn't real to Adam Fox. He was LARPing,\\\" Gibbons said, using an acronym for live action role playing. \\\"Adam Fox is usually impaired. He's just playing his game. ... A person cannot accidentally enter into a conspiracy.\\\"\", \"Lawyers for Harris and Caserta emphasized that neither man went to Elk Rapids with Croft and Fox to surveil Whitmer's home.\", \"Defense attorney Julia Kelly said Ty Garbin and Kaleb Franks, who both testified against the group, are \\\"liars,\\\" though they pleaded guilty and are facing prison.\", \"All charges against Adam Fox and Barry Croft, Jr. were declared \\\"no verdict\\\" and Judge Jonker has declared a mistrial on those counts.\", \"On Count 1: Conspiracy to Commit Kidnapping: Daniel Harris and Brandon Caserta were both found NOT GUILTY.\", \"On Count 2: Weapon of Mass Destruction: Daniel Harris was found NOT GUILTY\", \"On Count 3: Possession of an Unregistered Destructive Device: Daniel Harris was found NOT GUILTY\", \"On Count 4: Possession of a Short Barrel Rifle: Daniel Harris was found NOT GUILTY\", \"Cassandra Gauthier contributed to this report.\"]","href_hash":"c2418056b76b11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c2418056b76b11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
