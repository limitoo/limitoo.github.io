The dart also has a magnet to make sure it stays attached.\", \"Kill says the device allows police to be stealthy when tracking stolen cars.\", \"\\\"As soon as you hit your lights and sirens, they're fleeing from you,\\\" Kill said. \\\"Or we can back off, not chase it, follow it on a computer [with StarChase] until it lands, and then come in and make an arrest or recover the vehicle.\\\"\", \"Police chases are dangerous for police, suspects and bystanders.\", \"Last fall,\\u00a0Laneal Frazier\\u00a0died in Minneapolis when an officer crashed into his car while pursuing a stolen vehicle.\", \"\\\"We're trying to use different techniques right now to help us safely take down a suspect instead of chasing people through the cities at a high rate of speed, where somebody could get injured or killed,\\\" Kill said.\", \"Ramsey County has been using the technology for about three weeks. Kill has deployed his device at least once.\", \"In order for the device to be used, vehicle owners need to give permission to police to track their stolen vehicle.\", \"Grant money is funding the three squads in Ramsey County that currently have StarChase, but Kill hopes it doesn't stop there.\", \"\\\"I think having every car equipped with it would greatly help,\\\" he said.\", \"Graham Kates is an investigative reporter covering criminal justice, privacy issues and information security for CBS News Digital.
