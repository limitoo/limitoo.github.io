Glavin said it's not yet clear if Cuomo will only file the complaint against James, or if he will also name investigators who worked on the report. She did not commit to making the complaint public.\", \"James' office did not immediately return a request for comment.\", \"Cuomo resigned in August after the report by New York Attorney General Letitia James detailed accusations of sexual harassment and inappropriate behavior by 11 women, including former staffers and a state trooper. Cuomo has repeatedly denied all allegations of harassment.\\u00a0\", \"The report prompted investigations by several local district attorneys. They have all since declined to pursue charges, but have called the allegations they investigated \\\"credible.\\\"\", \"In the months since Cuomo's resignation, he and his attorney have repeatedly criticized James and the report. In an interview with Bloomberg on Monday, Cuomo declared himself \\\"vindicated.\\\" He said in the interview that he has not ruled out running for office again in the future.\", \"Glavin also said Thursday that she is considering asking \\\"relevant district attorneys\\\" to look into allegations she has made of witness tampering involving at least one of the women included in James' report.\\u00a0\", \"Graham Kates is an investigative reporter covering criminal justice, privacy issues and information security for CBS News Digital.
