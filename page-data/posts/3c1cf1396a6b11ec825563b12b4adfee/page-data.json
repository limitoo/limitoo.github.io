(By contrast, about 44,000 people in New York City tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday.)\", \"The streets surrounding Times Square were closed to traffic before dawn on Friday. So were several subway station entrances, even as city officials urged attendees to use mass transit.\", \"Beginning Friday afternoon, the police said they would direct people to viewing pens below and above 42nd Street, with access limited to a few entry points along an 18-block stretch. Alcohol, as in years past, is forbidden, as are large bags, umbrellas and lawn chairs.\", \"The police said there had been no credible terrorist threats leading into the day but urged vigilance nonetheless.\", \"\\u201cWe must keep in mind that New York City remains a target to foreign terrorist organizations and home grown violent extremists,\\u201d said Chief Thomas Galati, who oversees the Police Department\\u2019s intelligence units, at a news briefing in Times Square on Thursday.\", \"The department has experienced a record spike in officers out sick this week, at 21 percent, slightly higher than the roughly 20 percent who were out in the pandemic\\u2019s early stages in March and April 2020, Dermot F. Shea, the outgoing police commissioner, said. There have been far fewer hospitalizations recently than there were during the earlier spike, he added.\", \"The department has canceled vacations planned by officers who are still healthy to help ensure that there is an appropriate level of security throughout the city on Friday.\", \"Officers in bomb squads and in plain clothes will be in the area, and sander trucks will be positioned on the perimeter of the celebration to block potential threats.\", \"\\u201cSome you will see and some you will not see,\\u201d said Chief Martine Materasso of the counterterrorism bureau. \\u201cSpectators should expect to go through a multilayered screening process, including, but not limited to, magnetometers, explosive-trace detection machines, heavy-weapons and explosive -detection canines.\\u201d\", \"Said Mr. Shea: \\u201cWe\\u2019re in good shape.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3c1cf1396a6b11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3c1cf1396a6b11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
