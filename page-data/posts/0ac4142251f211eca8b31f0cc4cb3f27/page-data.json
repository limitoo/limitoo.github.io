Then from some bushes to the left, an elephant bull charges it. At first, the elephant appears to stop, but then he proceeds to charge and ram the car, pushing it sideways as the person taking the film attempts to flee.\", \"A second video, taken from a vehicle further down the road, shows the extent of the damage caused. In this film, you can see the elephant lifting and turning the car as its passengers flee and a tour guide shouts \\\"get out, get out, get out of the car.\\\"\", \"The second video has now been viewed over 27,000 times on Facebook.\", \"The safari, on the Selati Game Reserve in Kruger National Park, South Africa, was run by EcoTraining, a company that provides guides and wildlife training in Africa. As well as tours, it offers career courses, and gap year and sabbatical programs.\", \"A statement from EcoTraining said a group of instructors and trainees had come across a breeding herd of elephants.

Once the vehicle had come to a standstill, the trainees were moved to the second vehicle that was parked in close proximity.\\\"\", \"Bryan Havemann, the general manager of Selati Game Reserve, was made aware of the incident. \\\"Although the vehicle was damaged, thankfully none of the people on the vehicle were injured,\\\" he said.\", \"After the incident, everyone involved was provided professional counseling, EcoTraining said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942304/elephant.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Stock image of a charging elephant. </div>\"]","href_hash":"0ac4142251f211eca8b31f0cc4cb3f27"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0ac4142251f211eca8b31f0cc4cb3f27"}},
