According to her family, their mother, 58, whose name has not been released to the public, was walking the dog around 7 p.m. when the attackers got out of a Sedan and confronted her.\", \"The woman reportedly let go of her dog's leash, at which point it tried to run off across the street. Despite the animal's effort, the attackers were still able to grab it and make their escape.\", \"The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is investigating the matter and believes the suspects to be in their 20's with thin builds. They also believe that the Sedan used in the attack was either black or dark gray.

This makes them an even more tantalizing target for would-be dognappers. Their small size is also said to be a factor, as smaller breeds tend to be easier to make off with. Additionally, if the animal has not been spayed or neutered, some thieves might sell them for breeding purposes instead of as pets.\", \"\\\"Smaller breeds are more appealing for theft, and French bulldogs are wildly popular right now,\\\" Brandi Hunter, vice president of public relations and communications at the American Kennel Club, explained to CNN. \\\"The demand for the breed is higher than the supply so they are often a more targeted breed...Thieves generally know how popular these dogs are, what they cost, and how much people are willing to pay for them.\\\"\", \"In July, two women were arrested after stealing a French bulldog valued at around $11,500 dollars from a pet store in Texas.
