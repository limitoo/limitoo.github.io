This week, British Columbia announced a grim record. Lisa Lapointe, the province\\u2019s chief coroner, said that 201 people had died from overdoses in October, the most ever in a single month. And the cumulative total of 1,782 overdose deaths for 2021 is already the highest number in one year, with two more months of data to come.\", \"Ms. Lapointe called it a \\u201cheart-rending milestone.\\u201d\", \"British Columbia is not alone in overdose-related grief. Because of fentanyl, in large part, opioid deaths and overdoses have worsened across much of the country, urban and rural, with Alberta and Ontario also particularly afflicted.\", \"When Ms. Lapointe announced British Columbia\\u2019s latest terrible numbers, she also called on provincial governments to give the drug crisis the same sort of urgent attention and resources that have been brought to bear against the pandemic, particularly with vaccination.\", \"\\u201cThis is not an issue that\\u2019s going to go away without intensive change and involvement of a variety of levels of government,\\u201d she told a news conference.\", \"Among politicians and public health officials, there\\u2019s general agreement about what perhaps is obvious: The current system of laws surrounding drugs isn\\u2019t working when it comes to preventing drug-related deaths and overdoses. But exactly what will work and what\\u2019s possible politically are less clear.\", \"The city of Vancouver and the province of British Columbia have asked the federal government for permission to decriminalize possession of up to 4.5 grams of illegal substances within the province. This week, Toronto\\u2019s board of health authorized Dr. Eileen de Villa, the city\\u2019s chief medical officer, to also seek the same exemption from Health Canada.\", \"It\\u2019s a proposal that many police forces support.\", \"\\u201cOver the years, we realized that we cannot arrest and charge our way out of this crisis \\u2014 the opioid crisis,\\u201d Chief Gary Conn, of the Chatham-Kent police service and president of the Ontario Association of Chiefs of Police, told the CBC, adding: \\u201cWhat we\\u2019ve got to do is examine the underlying issues surrounding drug addictions.\\u201d\", \"So far, the federal government said that it would carefully consider all decriminalization requests. This week, it also introduced a bill ending minimum mandatory sentences for some drug offenses.\", \"But this week 21 organizations \\u2014 a mix of public health, drug policy and drug users\\u2019 groups \\u2014 published a joint plan that urged the government to go much further. It calls for full decriminalization of drugs for personal use, as well as the sharing and selling of drugs for \\u201csubsistence, to support personal drug use costs, or to provide a safe supply.\\u201d The groups are also asking that funds allocated to the police for enforcing drug laws be redirected to \\u201cnon-coercive, voluntary policies, programs, and services\\u201d for drug users, including housing, social services, education and health services.\", \"\\u201cThe war on drugs has been a colossal failure,\\u201d Sandra Ka Hon Chu, the co-executive director of the HIV Legal Network, one of the groups behind the document, said in a statement. \\u201cUnder a regime of criminalization, people who use drugs are vilified, subject to routine human rights abuses, and denied access to lifesaving health care.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s an open question whether there\\u2019s the political will in Canada to go as far as the plan recommends. But Ms. Lapointe urged a swift expansion of a program in British Columbia for doctors to prescribe safe drugs to users to prevent overdoses and deaths \\u2014 an idea few physicians have embraced.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t have time to wait months and years to continue to look for evidence that safe supply will work,\\u201d Ms. Lapointe said. \\u201cWe know from studies it does work.\\u201d\", \"Our colleagues at The Upshot are looking for testers from Canada for their next dialect quiz.
