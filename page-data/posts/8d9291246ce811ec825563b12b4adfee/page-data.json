The changes, with Mr. Hamdok as prime minister, gave hope to many Sudanese that their nation was taking a turn for the better.\", \"\\u201cHe was an affable, grandfatherly figure who really in his person symbolized a better future,\\u201d said Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, a think tank based in Washington. \\u201cHe came to symbolize the hope and change of Sudan.\\u201d\", \"But in the end, Mr. Hamdok, 66, faced the herculean task of attempting to unite the disparate actors who strove to shape Sudan\\u2019s future.\", \"There was the military, the country\\u2019s long-dominant force, which removed him from office on Oct. 25, kept him sidelined under house arrest \\u2014 and then reinstalled him a month later after he signed a deal with them.\", \"There was the constellation of political parties and trade unions, many of which all along had rejected any power-sharing agreement with the military.\", \"And then there were the protesters, who have flooded the streets since late October, despite a violent crackdown. In chants and on signs, they labeled Mr. Hamdok a \\u201ctraitor\\u201d who had undermined their quest for \\u201cfreedom, peace and justice.\\u201d\", \"On Monday, the United Nations and countries including the United States called on Sudanese political leaders to patch up their differences through consensus and dialogue. U.S. Senator James E. Risch, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said Mr. Hamdok\\u2019s resignation \\u201ccompletes\\u201d the military coup of Oct. 25, and urged the military to \\u201chand over power to elected civilian leaders.\\u201d\", \"Sudan\\u2019s military leader, Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, on Monday promised to form what he called \\u201can independent government.\\u201d He also said the military was committed to peace and holding elections, according to the Sudan News Agency. General al-Burhan\\u2019s office did not immediately respond to questions.\", \"Experts say that installing a legitimate civilian government now will not be easy.\", \"As part of a constitutional declaration signed in 2019, a legislative council would have selected a prime minister. That appointee would then be approved by the Sovereignty Council, a transitional body composed of civilian and military leaders.\", \"But the transitional legislative council was never formed. And Gen. al-Burhan dissolved the Sovereignty Council after the coup, and established a new one stacked with military appointees and their allies, said Lauren Blanchard, a specialist in African affairs with the Congressional Research Service, a research institute of the United States Congress.\", \"Another option, according to the 2019 agreement, Ms. Blanchard said, would call for the Forces of Freedom and Change \\u2014 which led the civilian side of the transitional government \\u2014 to select a prime minister. But with the general\\u2019s crackdown on protesters, the participation of the Forces of Freedom and Change seems unlikely, she said.\", \"With no prime minister or civilian government, the military, former rebel groups and the powerful paramilitary group known as the Rapid Support Forces are now in control of Sudan.\", \"Magdi el-Gizouli, a Sudanese fellow at the Rift Valley Institute, a research group, said that some of the names floated for appointment as prime minister \\u2014 as the military tries to temper both international criticism and domestic protests \\u2014 include a former finance minister, Ibrahim Elbadawi, and Mudawi Ibrahim Adam, a human-rights activist. But both men and others are likely to decline the offers, he said, given the pressure coming from the general public.\", \"\\u201cSo for now, it is the generals who will make the decisions,\\u201d Mr. el-Gizouli said. \\u201cIf you command an army and have guns in Sudan, you now make the decision.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Hamdok\\u2019s resignation does put increased pressure on the military, Mr. Hudson said. The generals have used Mr. Hamdok as cover, he said, shielding them from international pressure and financial sanctions targeting their extensive business networks.\", \"But even as they paid lip service to democracy and elections, the generals undermined Mr. Hamdok\\u2019s leadership, and over the past two months, responded with brutality to the protests of those calling for a fully democratic Sudan.\", \"Despite the crackdown, anti-coup demonstrators have continued to turn out every week, with neighborhood resistance committees becoming ever more organized in standing up to the military. But with Mr. Hamdok gone, many civilians and analysts are now worried about a more extensive and severe crackdown.\", \"Sudan is going \\u201cdeeper in the wrong direction,\\u201d said Mr. el-Gizouli, of the Rift Valley Institute. \\u201cIt is heading toward a hollowed-out political system where words and structures don\\u2019t mean anything, and where killing people doesn\\u2019t cost you anything.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8d9291246ce811ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8d9291246ce811ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
