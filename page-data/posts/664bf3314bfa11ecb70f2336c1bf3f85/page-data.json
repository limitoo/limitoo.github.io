The online fundraising campaign went viral on social media and raised over $400,000.\", \"However, authorities began to investigate the couple after Bobbitt filed a lawsuit, alleging that he never received any of the money.\", \"According to NBC News, prosecutors said in 2018 when charges were filed that they had uncovered over 60,000 text messages between McClure and D'Amico relating to their financial struggles before they came up with the idea for the scam. After receiving the wave of donations, the couple allegedly took vacations to Las Vegas and New Jersey to gamble at casinos and purchased luxury items like a BMW, high-end clothes and accessories.\", \"The fundraiser, which brought the couple over $400,000 from over 14,000 donors over the course of a month, eventually saw all donations returned by GoFundMe once the trio was charged with faking the campaign.\", \"According to prosecutors, Bobbitt and McClure both said after the group was charged that D'Amico was the one who came up with the scheme sometime after they met outside a casino in Philadelphia in Oct. 2017.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938233/gofundme-fraud-mark-damico.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Mark D'Amico pleaded guilty in federal court in a 2017 scheme involving a homeless man and fraudulent GoFundMe page.
