The new guys — with chips on their shoulders — have come through.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-27T08:41:46.000Z","content":"[\"WASHINGTON \\u2014 Washington, depending on who is in power, has been known for infighting, people bemoaning failure despite lofty expectations, and bursts of optimism punctuating bouts of apathy.\", \"But enough about the old Washington Wizards. Let\\u2019s talk about the new ones.\", \"The Wizards, at 11-6, are among the best teams in the N.B.A.\\u2019s Eastern Conference. But recent trends say they shouldn\\u2019t be. They have only one perennial All-Star \\u2014 Bradley Beal, who is having an underwhelming season. Their most productive player, Montrezl Harrell, has been coming off the bench. Multiple starters (Thomas Bryant and Rui Hachimura) haven\\u2019t played yet. They have a first-time head coach in Wes Unseld Jr. More than half of the players are in their first season with the team.\", \"Oh, and there\\u2019s one other thing, as Harrell said after a practice this week: \\u201cWe\\u2019re the Washington Wizards, brother. We don\\u2019t get any respect.\\u201d\", \"The Wizards are coming off three straight losing seasons, and they haven\\u2019t reached a conference finals since Jimmy Carter was in the White House and Unseld\\u2019s father was on the team. Perhaps the current success is worthy of celebration, but the universe has a way of restoring proper basketball balance. On cue, the Wizards are hitting some bumps, having lost three of their last four.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s November, you know what I\\u2019m saying?\\u201d said Kyle Kuzma, a starting forward and one of nine new players. \\u201cThere\\u2019s been plenty of teams that start off hot and fizzle out.\\u201d\", \"But there\\u2019s some reason for tempered optimism. The last time the Wizards started this well was in 2014-15, when they finished 46-36 and lost in the second round of the playoffs to an Atlanta Hawks team starting four All-Stars. That Wizards team was led by the dynamic backcourt of Beal and John Wall.\", \"Now, the Wizards are opting for a less top-down approach. Tommy Sheppard, the general manager who was recently promoted to team president, overhauled the roster in the summer, adding depth and defense on the wings by swapping Russell Westbrook for a package of picks and players in a five-team trade. Westbrook, the N.B.A.\\u2019s 2017 most valuable player, had been Washington\\u2019s second-leading scorer, behind Beal.\", \"\\u201cWhen you have a vision in the summer, and you see it start to come together, it\\u2019s very gratifying,\\u201d Sheppard said. \\u201cBut at the same time, you\\u2019re always very cautious. Don\\u2019t get too high or too low at any point of the season.\\u201d\", \"The Wizards are winning by riding a staunch defense \\u2014 on pace to be one of the best in the N.B.A. \\u2014 and their new players, like Harrell, Kuzma and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, all of whom were acquired from the Los Angeles Lakers in the Westbrook trade. It was a gamble on both ends: The Wizards, who are trying to persuade Beal to sign a new long-term deal, moved out a bona fide star in Westbrook, while the Lakers gave up multiple role players, two of whom had helped them win a championship.\", \"\\u201cI knew it was time to go,\\u201d Kuzma said, adding: \\u201cWhen you think about it, you got traded for a Hall of Famer. Anytime an organization can trade for a Hall of Fame-type of player, you kind of have to do it, especially when you\\u2019re the Laker brand and you\\u2019re all about stars.\\u201d\", \"The early returns: The Lakers have slumped, coming out of the gate at 9-10 and often seeming as if they could use the exact type of players they gave up in the trade. Not that Kuzma or Harrell, at least outwardly, take any pride in that. They\\u2019ve opted for magnanimity instead of early gloating.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not about that,\\u201d Harrell said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a long, long season. Like I tell people all the time, we\\u2019re just trying to stack good days upon each other, man.\\u201d\", \"He continued with what seemed to be the Wizards\\u2019 tagline: \\u201cNever get too high. Never get too low.\\u201d\", \"Harrell, in his seventh season, is known for ferocious dunks, and he succeeds as a big man despite being shorter than most other centers and forwards. He makes his living around the rim and doesn\\u2019t shoot 3-pointers. In the summer of 2020, he surprised many by taking less money to sign with the Lakers, who had just won a championship, than what he most likely could have gotten from other teams. Harrell couldn\\u2019t find his footing. His playing time was reduced over the season and he was out of the rotation in the playoffs, where the Lakers were eliminated in the first round. (Lakers Coach Frank Vogel attributed the minutes reduction to the signing of center Andre Drummond and not wanting to simultaneously play two big men who don\\u2019t shoot well.)\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not a coach, but I went in and did my job,\\u201d Harrell said. \\u201cI went in and practiced like a pro and prepared like one. And when it came down to game time, it wasn\\u2019t in my calling, brother. It\\u2019s not up to me.\\u201d\", \"Harrell\\u2019s production this season may end up indicting the Lakers. He\\u2019s averaging 17.5 points and 9 rebounds on 65.3 percent shooting, all on pace to be career highs. And he\\u2019s doing this mostly from off the bench while playing the most minutes of his career. By some metrics, Harrell hasn\\u2019t been just the best player on the Wizards, he has been among the most productive players in the N.B.A.\", \"The season has felt, Harrell said, like a \\u201cweight being off my shoulders.\\u201d\", \"If there\\u2019s anyone familiar with the trials and tribulations of basketball, it is Unseld, the Wizards\\u2019 rookie head coach. His father, Wes Unseld, played for the franchise from 1968, when it was known as the Baltimore Bullets, to his retirement in 1981. The elder Unseld won a Most Valuable Player Award, and is the among the most celebrated players in the team\\u2019s history. He also was the team\\u2019s head coach over seven seasons, and one of its front office executives for years. He died last year.\", \"Asked what advice his father gave him about coaching, Unseld Jr. deadpanned, \\u201c\\u2018Don\\u2019t do it.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI saw the impact it had on him,\\u201d said Unseld, who was an N.B.A. assistant coach for 16 years. He added: \\u201cI think his competitive spirit and his approach was different than the players that he coached.\\u201d\", \"Unseld said he\\u2019s trying to be more even-keeled.\", \"\\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s my personality,\\u201d he said. \\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s my nature. I never get too high. I don\\u2019t ever want to get low. It doesn\\u2019t mean you\\u2019re devoid of emotion and you just don\\u2019t care, but try to put things in perspective.\\u201d\", \"What is clear is that the franchise still orbits around Beal. This is the 28-year-old Beal\\u2019s 10th season with Washington, which drafted him third overall in 2012. A three-time All-Star, he can become a free agent this summer, in an era of player-engineered superteams. Sheppard said that the Wizards are committed to persuading Beal to stay and that the recent roster overhaul was part of that effort.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s been a huge catalyst for everything that we\\u2019ve done and a big supporter,\\u201d Sheppard said, adding, \\u201cOur full intention is to have Bradley Beal and build around Bradley Beal.\\u201d\", \"This season, Beal has received more attention for matters off the court. At the start of training camp, Beal told reporters that he had not been vaccinated against Covid-19 and cast himself as a vaccine skeptic. The disclosure was jarring, given that Beal missed the Summer Olympics in Tokyo after testing positive for the coronavirus, and because so many Wizards tested positive last season that they did not have enough players to compete for nearly two weeks.\", \"Suddenly, Beal became a cause c\\u00e9l\\u00e8bre for conservatives in the United States who have spread vaccine misinformation and resisted mandates, like Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas. Beal later said that he would still consider receiving the vaccine and that he didn\\u2019t want Cruz\\u2019s support. Sheppard said that he respected Beal\\u2019s decision and that vaccination was \\u201cpersonal space, and I don\\u2019t invade that.\\u201d Unseld said he is not worried about Beal\\u2019s choice because he can\\u2019t control it.\", \"Yet with cases once again rising in the United States, the Wizards could be without Beal, their leading scorer despite his struggles, if he contracts the virus or is put in the league\\u2019s health and safety protocols.\", \"In the meantime, Beal has deflected questions about whether he\\u2019ll stay with the Wizards long-term, but he did offer one encouraging sign for Sheppard going forward. Before the season, Beal told The Washington Post: \\u201cMy biggest thing is getting us off going to a good start.\\u201d\", \"That box is checked. Now comes the harder part: staying successful.\", \"\\u201cWe have a good coach, a new system, almost a whole new team,\\u201d Beal told reporters on Sunday. \\u201cEverything is different. Everything is going to feel a little bit different or new, but that in a positive way.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c6fa012a4f5d11ec88eb3f59e819a78c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c6fa012a4f5d11ec88eb3f59e819a78c"}},
