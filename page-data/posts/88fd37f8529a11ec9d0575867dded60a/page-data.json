The announcement from Nigeria, in western Africa, again highlighted that scientists still cannot say with certainty where or when the variant originated.\", \"In addition, Nigeria identified the variant in at least two travelers who arrived from South Africa in the last week, Dr. Ifedayo Adetifa, the director general for the Nigeria Center for Disease Control, said in a statement. Retrospective sequencing of previously confirmed cases, he said, had also spotted the new variant in a sample collected last month.\", \"\\u201cThe two recent cases, though asymptomatic, have been linked to clinical care, and other response activities, which include contact tracing, have commenced,\\u201d Dr. Adetifa said in a statement.\", \"Nigeria is the third country in mainland Africa \\u2014 besides South Africa and Botswana \\u2014 to report the variant, which is now known to have reached every continent except Antarctica. But scientists say it could be weeks before more is known about how transmissible the variant is, the severity of illness it causes and how much protection the current vaccines offer against it.\", \"Still, governments have reacted with alarm and markets have tumbled in recent days, as the W.H.O. rated the global risk from the variant \\u201cvery high.\\u201d\", \"On Wednesday, Nigerian health officials urged state governments to make testing easily accessible, vaccinate many more people and ensure the public was adhering to public health measures including masking and social distancing. Nigeria has so far reported 214,113 positive cases and 2,976 deaths from the coronavirus.\", \"Established in 2011, the Nigeria C.D.C. has over 500 staff working in its headquarters in Abuja and nationwide on diseases ranging from cholera to malaria and yellow fever. The center is managing at least five laboratories that are working in genomic sequencing of the coronavirus. In 2014, its scientists were lauded for how they helped contain the deadly Ebola outbreak from taking hold in Africa\\u2019s most populous nation.\"]","href_hash":"88fd37f8529a11ec9d0575867dded60a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"88fd37f8529a11ec9d0575867dded60a"}},
