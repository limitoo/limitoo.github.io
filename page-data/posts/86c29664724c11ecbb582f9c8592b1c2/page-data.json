As the lunar rover made a closer approach, a log of its activities\\u00a0revealed\\u00a0the object was actually just a rock on a crater rim.\", \"The revelation came as the lunar rover drove closer to the formation that was once believed to be as tall as Paris' Arc de Triomphe, according to a post published Friday on \\\"Our Space,\\\" a Chinese media channel affiliated with the China National Space Administration. Instead, it was much smaller and had a peculiar shape. Upon a closer view, the rock looked\\u00a0like a \\\"jade rabbit\\\" holding carrots, the post said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The Moon's surface is 38 million square kilometres of rocks, so it would have been astronomically exceptional for it to be anything else,\\\" Space News journalist Andrew Jones\\u00a0wrote on Twitter. \\\"But while small, the jade rabbit/\\u7389\\u5154 rock will also be a monumental disappointment to some.\\\"\", \"Oh, this is amazing. Close to tears. Ourspace has published an update on the \\\"mystery hut\\\" and it's so underwhelming it's brilliant. It's just a small rock on a crater rim that they're now calling \\\"jade rabbit\\\" for its appearance.

China landed Yutu 2 as part of its unmanned Chang'e 4 mission.\\u00a0\", \"Yutu 2 first encountered the object while driving across the Von K\\u00e1rm\\u00e1n crater in November during the mission's 36th lunar day, according to Our Space. The rover, which was 80 meters away (about 262 feet), sent back images of the object on the horizon, sparking theories about what it could be on social media, with some joking it could be an alien base.\\u00a0\", \"While the results of the rock may have been underwhelming for some, it's all part of\\u00a0China's rapidly accelerating\\u00a0space program. In October, China\\u00a0launched a three-person crew\\u00a0for a six-month mission aboard its own space station, aiming to set a new record for the length of time spent in space by Chinese astronauts. Earlier this year, China successfully landed a\\u00a0solar-powered rover\\u00a0in Mars.\\u00a0\", \"Christopher Brito is a social media producer and trending writer for CBS News, focusing on sports and stories that involve issues of race and culture.\"]","href_hash":"86c29664724c11ecbb582f9c8592b1c2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"86c29664724c11ecbb582f9c8592b1c2"}},
