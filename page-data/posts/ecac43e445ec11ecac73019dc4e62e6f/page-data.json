Cleaning up contaminated ground water. Replacing polluting school and commuter buses with cleaner vehicles.\", \"The $1 trillion infrastructure bill that Congress approved in a rare moment of bipartisan accord has the potential to transform New York City and its surrounding region. Officials here, as in much of the country, are confronting a staggeringly long to-do list of public works projects.\", \"The bill, which President Biden is expected to sign into law Monday, should clear the way for several high-profile projects, chief among them the extension of Second Avenue subway in Manhattan and a plan to build a new rail tunnel linkingNew York and New Jersey.\", \"But its effects will also be felt in numerous less flashy ways in a region with outdated infrastructure whose vulnerability has been especially tested by climate change.\", \"\\u201cReally, we have such a backlog in this country,\\u201d said Felicia Park-Rogers, the director of regional infrastructure projects for the Tri-State Transportation Campaign. \\u201cThis will help us catch up, and it will help us move forward.\\u201d\", \"The sprawling bill has funds for high-speed internet, climate resiliency projects, energy grid improvements, transportation projects and environmental programs.\", \"Of the transportation-related funding, about 80 percent is directed to highways and road projects and much of the rest to public transit. Some transportation advocates were disappointed with the split.\", \"\\u201cGiven that we\\u2019re staring down a climate catastrophe, this is not what we would like to see,\\u201d Ms. Park-Rogers said.\", \"State agencies have some flexibility in spending and could still use highway funds to, for example, expand bike lanes, said Kate Slevin, the executive vice president of the Regional Plan Association, an urban policy group.\", \"But officials want to address the concerns of drivers who have long griped about aging roads and decrepit bridges.\", \"State Senator Tim Kennedy, a Democrat who chairs the New York State Senate\\u2019s transportation committee, said the state has more than 1,700 bridges and 7,300 miles of local roads and highways considered to be in poor condition.\", \"Hank Gutman, the city\\u2019s transportation commissioner, expects that federal funds could help repair the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, which is crumbling under the weight of more than 150,000 vehicles a day.\", \"In New Jersey, which has some of the nation\\u2019s busiest highways, officials said federal money could finance 60 bridge projects.\", \"The bill also funnels money to bridges that carry the nation\\u2019s long-neglected railways and could pay to replace the Walk Bridge in Norwalk, Conn., which ferries Amtrak and Metro-North passengers over a crucial crossing. Built more than 120 years ago, it has \\u201cexperienced repeated operational failures\\u201d in recent years, according to transit officials.\", \"The bill also focuses on social equity concerns by seeking to reverse the harm past infrastructure projects have inflicted on low-income and Black communities.\", \"\\u201cCities like Newark, East Orange, New Haven \\u2014 they were really ripped apart from interstate highway construction and urban renewal projects,\\u201d Ms. Slevin said.\", \"In New York, the bill could advance plans to \\u201ccap\\u201d the Cross Bronx Expressway \\u2014 cover those parts of the highway that are sunken below street level \\u2014 and perhaps cover it with a park. Built in the 1950 and 1960s, the Robert Moses-era highway displaced Black families and ripped a hole through several neighborhoods.\", \"Proponents of the plan say it would address air pollution in the Bronx and help protect against severe flooding.\", \"Infrastructure dollars could also help accelerate other long-planned projects to redesign streets and reduce New York City\\u2019s vulnerability to climate-related flooding. In East Harlem, federal money could pay to plant tree, and rain gardens and improve street drainage along East 106th Street and First, Second and Third Avenues.\", \"Transit agencies are expected to use much of the money for big-ticket items in their capital plans.\", \"The Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates New York\\u2019s subways, buses and two commuter-rail networks, expects to receive $10 billion, and it plans to use some of the money to make the system more accessible.\", \"Currently, only about a quarter of New York City\\u2019s 472 subway stations are wheelchair-accessible.\", \"The bill could also improve Long Island Rail Road station capacity at Jamaica in Queens and eliminate the \\u201cJamaica Crawl.\\u201d Hundreds of thousands of riders a day pass through the station, which was built more than 100 years ago and where a tangle of different train lines come together.\", \"Kevin Corbett, the president and chief executive of New Jersey Transit, which operates one of the nation\\u2019s largest fleet of commuter buses, said the federal funds will help accelerate the purchase of electric buses and the electrification of bus depots. It also set aside about $5 billion to replace older school buses, which generate harmful emissions, with electric or low-emission versions.\", \"About $55 billion in the infrastructure bill will help improve access to clean drinking water.\", \"In Newburgh, N.Y., a city of about 28,000 people 70 miles north of New York City, thousands of decades-old lead pipelines that deliver water to homes could be replaced. Wayne Vradenburgh, the city\\u2019s water superintendent, said he estimated that there were some 2,500 service connections to homes that need replacing.\", \"\\u201cWe want all the lead out,\\u201d he said.\", \"George Latimer, the Westchester County executive, said he also hopes to use federal money to replace decades-old pipes and rectify groundwater contamination near the Westchester County Airport, where chemicals used decades ago in firefighting tests have polluted the area.\", \"Officials also hope federal dollars could help pay the high cost of improving sewers in New York City and its suburbs, many of which are a century or more old. Federal dollars could help accelerate projects like a new pumping station in St. Albans, Queens, and sewer improvement along Willow Avenue in Staten Island that residents have been awaiting for nearly a quarter-century.\", \"Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader of the Senate, said the region\\u2019s airports can expect millions to help with upgrades, though a spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said it was still reviewing the bill\\u2019s potential benefits.\", \"Smaller regional airports across New York hope the bill can help them with long-delayed runway construction, expansion and refurbishment.\", \"In Connecticut, some officials hope the bill can help fund the construction of a new passenger terminal at Sikorsky Memorial Airport, near Bridgeport. \", \"While government officials have their wish lists ready, it remains too early to know how exactly the money will be distributed and which projects will be the winners.\", \"\\u201cWhat we\\u2019re entering now is a crucial implementation phase, where federal, state and local leaders are going to have to coordinate on not just getting the funding out there, but even designing the programs that are going to get the funding out there,\\u201d said Joseph Kane, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan Washington think tank.\", \"Some money will be channeled through various federal agencies, like the Department of Transportation. Another portion will flow to state entities, like the New York Department of Transportation or New Jersey Transit, based on existing, complex formulas. The states will then decide which projects to prioritize.\", \"The process is likely to take years.\", \"But officials are optimistic. Mr. Gutman said that the bill\\u2019s priorities matched \\u201cthe priorities that we set and that we\\u2019ve been pursuing.\\u201d But now, he said, the city was \\u201cgoing to have the windfall\\u201d to achieve them.\", \"With only 13 House Republicans and 19 Republican senators voting in support of the bill, several who voted yes drew the ire of some rank-and-file conservative voters, highlighting how the country\\u2019s sharp polarization could spill over even into roads, pipes and bridges.\", \"Of the House Republicans who supported the bill, four were from New York and two from New Jersey. In Long Island, a man was arrested Wednesday after making death threats against Representative Andrew Garbarino over his vote to pass the bill. In a previous interview with The New York Times, a spokeswoman said the Washington office of Representative Nicole Malliotakis, who represents Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn, has received several angry phone calls, though a majority of callers to her Staten Island office were supportive.\", \"Representative Tom Reed, a Republican who represents rural areas upstate, said his office had received several \\u201caggressive\\u201d calls over his vote in favor of the bill. But he believes the vast majority of his constituents support the measure.\", \"\\u201cA lot of what\\u2019s driven this opposition was purely politically motivated,\\u201d Mr. Reed said. \", \"In southern New Jersey, some constituents were upset that Representative Jeff Van Drew had voted for the bill. Mr. Van Drew said the bill would improve internet access in rural areas, update drinking water systems and strengthen the electrical grid.\", \"\\u201cI think there\\u2019s just some people who think there shouldn\\u2019t be any cooperation at all with the other side,\\u201d said Michael Donohue, the chairman of the Cape May County Republicans. \\u201cAnd I get that, but it\\u2019s not a practical approach.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ecac43e445ec11ecac73019dc4e62e6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ecac43e445ec11ecac73019dc4e62e6f"}},
