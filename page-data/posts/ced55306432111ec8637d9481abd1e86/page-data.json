Allies complained about his lack of consultation. Republicans criticized him for making a premature decision. And he received broad condemnation for a haphazard and chaotic evacuation of Americans and Afghan allies. Even some veterans groups expressed dismay at the way the conflict ended.\", \"But the president has repeatedly said he has no regrets about the decision to pull out of a war that he long believed should have ended years ago. In previous speeches, Mr. Biden has said he could no longer send members of the military to fight a battle that he no longer believed was in the country\\u2019s best interests.\", \"On Thursday, Mr. Biden made only a brief reference to his decision, noting that \\u201cfor two decades, the lives of our service members and their families and veterans have been shaped by the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\u201d\", \"He said the two conflicts had claimed 52,323 American lives, and he noted that members of the military continue to serve in the face of threats around the globe.\", \"But the president suggested that the absence of war was an opportunity to focus attention on those who served, survived and returned. He urged service members not to ignore the mental challenges that often follow wartime service, any more than they would ignore a wounded arm or leg when they returned home.\", \"\\u201cI want to say clearly to all our veterans, if you\\u2019re struggling \\u2014 you\\u2019re so used to never asking for anything \\u2014 if you\\u2019re struggling, reach out,\\u201d Mr. Biden said. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re having trouble thinking about things. It\\u2019s no different than if you had a wound in your arm.\\u201d\", \"Like he has often in previous speeches, Mr. Biden recalled his own son\\u2019s service in the military. As a major in the Delaware Army National Guard, Beau Biden spent a year in Iraq before returning to the United States and later succumbing to brain cancer.\", \"\\u201cOur grandkids learned what it meant to have their dad overseas in a war zone instead of back at home for a year, tucking them into bed and reading that story every night,\\u201d the president said. \\u201cThousands of Americans, tens of thousands, have had that experience.\\u201d\", \"But he spent more time paying tribute to the story of the first American fighter from World War I to be put to rest at the Tomb of the Unknowns exactly 100 years ago.\", \"During Mr. Biden\\u2019s remarks, he recalled the journey the soldier made from the battlefield in France to lying in state at the Capitol in the same place that Abraham Lincoln had earlier.\", \"\\u201cHe was escorted from the Capitol by the president of the United States, the chief justice of the Supreme Court, members of Congress, General Pershing, the chiefs of staff, Medal of Honor recipients,\\u201d Mr. Biden recalled, adding, \\u201cThe first unknown lies now with his brethren, unnamed warriors from later wars, fellow patriots who picked up the mantle of honor.\\u201d\", \"Before speaking, Mr. Biden participated in the annual ceremony at the tomb, placing a wreath and saluting while a bugler played taps.\", \"Afterward, he urged Americans to \\u201cstand in solemn awe of such fidelity because for us to keep faith with American veterans, we must never forget exactly what was given us.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ced55306432111ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ced55306432111ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
