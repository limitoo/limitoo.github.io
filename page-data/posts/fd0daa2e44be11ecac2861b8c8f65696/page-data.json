who instilled in him a love of learning and reading, as well as resilience and a strong work ethic.\", \"\\\"At 16, she hopped on the train at Griffith to Shepparton in Victoria, to go and work in a fruit cannery,\\\" he said, \\\"that kind of drive has always been in my family\\\".\", \"That drive is also clear in Benjamin \\u2014 and why he has been named a recipient of the Dr Charles Perkins
