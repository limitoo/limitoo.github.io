The group said that in response to the attack, it had enhanced its security measures, increased the monitoring of its network and added cybersecurity personnel.\", \"Ransomware attacks have become increasingly common and have hit big businesses, schools and universities, local governments, hospitals and the police. In many cases, hackers break into computer networks and lock up digital information until the victim pays for its release.\", \"Planned Parenthood\\u2019s disclosure that it had been the victim of such an attack came at a potentially critical moment for the future of abortion rights.\", \"On Wednesday, the Supreme Court seemed poised to uphold a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Such a decision would squarely conflict with Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion and prohibited states from banning the procedure before fetal viability, currently around 23 weeks.\", \"If the Supreme Court upholds the law, Planned Parenthood has said that more than 36 million women of reproductive age, and more people who can become pregnant, in 26 mostly Southern and Midwestern states could lose access to abortion.\"]","href_hash":"eee82b58532c11ec9a5913d2f07f8ef6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eee82b58532c11ec9a5913d2f07f8ef6"}},
