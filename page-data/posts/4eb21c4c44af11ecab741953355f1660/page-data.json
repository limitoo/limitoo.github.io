Joe Biden won. Donald Trump did not,\\u201d Mr. Christie writes in his new book, \\u201cRepublican Rescue: Saving the Party From Truth Deniers, Conspiracy Theorists, and the Dangerous Policies of Joe Biden.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThat is the truth. Any claim to the contrary is untrue,\\u201d Mr. Christie says.\", \"It is not a popular view in the Republican Party right now, as Mr. Trump has promoted his baseless claims of widespread election fraud for more than a year, and as many Republicans have either echoed those claims or averted their gaze.\", \"But it\\u2019s a view that Mr. Christie has been repeating since Election Day, as he urges the G.O.P. \\u2014 and Mr. Trump \\u2014 to move on from looking backward.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not a book about him,\\u201d Mr. Christie said in a recent interview about the book, which will be released on Wednesday. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a book about where we go from here and why it is important for us to let go of the past.\\u201d\", \"Of Mr. Trump, Mr. Christie was blunt: \\u201cIf he wants to be a positive force in the future, he\\u2019s got to let this other stuff go. If he doesn\\u2019t, I don\\u2019t think he can be.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Christie pointed to the Virginia governor\\u2019s race and Glenn Youngkin, the Republican who won the state party convention without Mr. Trump\\u2019s endorsement and then kept him at bay during the general election. Mr. Youngkin ultimately defeated his Democratic opponent, Terry McAuliffe.\", \"Mr. Christie said the Youngkin victory knocks down \\u201cthis idea that if you don\\u2019t agree with Donald Trump on everything, and pledge unfettered fealty to him, then you can\\u2019t win because his voters quote unquote won\\u2019t come out to vote,\\u201d Mr. Christie said. \\u201cNo candidate owns voters. They don\\u2019t.\\u201d\", \"He described Mr. Trump\\u2019s conduct in the year since he left office \\u2014 and the anxiety felt by lawmakers who worry about crossing him \\u2014 in stark terms. \\u201cDonald Trump\\u2019s own conduct is meant to instill fear,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Christie is a former governor of New Jersey, a former presidential candidate and a possible future one. He was one of Mr. Trump\\u2019s earliest supporters in 2016 after he ended his own national candidacy, was a potential vice-presidential candidate, led Mr. Trump\\u2019s transition effort until he was fired from that role and helped lead Mr. Trump\\u2019s opioids commission.\", \"He was with Mr. Trump throughout a tumultuous presidency, a fact that Mr. Christie\\u2019s critics say makes his critiques too late to be meaningful. Mr. Christie argues that his support for Mr. Trump, and their 15-year friendship before that, makes him a credible critic.\", \"\\u201cI think it was really important for people to understand why I did support the president for so long,\\u201d Mr. Christie said. \\u201cAnd the reason was, because I generally agreed with the policies that he was pursuing.\\u201d When they would argue over the years, he added, \\u201cit was rarely over policy.\\u201d\", \"The arguments were generally over how things were handled, Mr. Christie added, citing Mr. Trump\\u2019s throwing of \\u201cbouquets\\u201d at President Xi Jinping of China as an example. Being generous with Mr. Xi when the Chinese government was withholding information about the coronavirus was \\u201cunacceptable,\\u201d Mr. Christie said.\", \"Mr. Christie does not blame Mr. Trump\\u2019s speech on Jan. 6 for the violence that followed at the Capitol by his supporters. He said instead that it was the months of Mr. Trump\\u2019s false claims that the election was stolen from him that instilled anger in those who believed him.\", \"The responsibility for what happened \\u201cwas months long in coming,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAs a leader, you need to know that there are consequences to the words you use. And that those consequences at times can be stuff that you may not even be able to anticipate. I don\\u2019t believe he anticipated that people would cause violence up on Capitol Hill. But I don\\u2019t think he thought about it, either.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Christie began road-testing his themes in a speech at the Reagan presidential library in September, during which he didn\\u2019t name Mr. Trump. When he spoke again at the Republican Jewish Coalition conference in Nevada last weekend, Mr. Trump took notice, and delivered a broadside that his aides intended as a warning shot.\", \"Mr. Christie \\u201cwas just absolutely massacred by his statements that Republicans have to move on from the past, meaning the 2020 Election Fraud,\\u201d Mr. Trump said in a statement that also attacked Mr. Christie for a low approval rating, which Mr. Trump mischaracterized by half.\", \"Mr. Christie said that Mr. Trump should focus less on \\u201cpersonal vendetta,\\u201d and added, \\u201cI just think if he wants to have that kind of conversation about me then I\\u2019m going to point out that I got 60 percent of the vote in a blue state with 51 percent of the Hispanic vote.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Christie said he would not make a decision about running for president in 2024 until after the midterm elections in 2022. He said that Mr. Trump would not factor into his thinking and that he would not rule out supporting the former president if he saw no path for himself.\", \"Throughout the book, Mr. Christie places Mr. Trump in the historical context of a political strain in the country that is centuries old. The QAnon conspiracy theorists of the last several years are in many ways the descendants of John Birch Society members, Mr. Christie writes, and he contrasts how Ronald Reagan handled extremist voices in his party with how Mr. Trump has.\", \"He faults Mr. Trump for spreading \\u201cthe birther campaign\\u201d about former President Barack Obama\\u2019s birthplace in 2011.\", \"\\u201cHe truly showed everyone how a lie like that can be exploited,\\u201d Mr. Christie said, taking note of other Republicans who encouraged questions about where the first Black president was born.\", \"And Mr. Christie writes that he knows Mr. Trump was furious after he was laughed at during the White House Correspondents Dinner in 2011, when Mr. Obama roasted him over his birther crusade. Mr. Trump later boasted that he was unbothered, but Mr. Christie said he spoke with Mr. Trump about it. \\u201cJust beside himself with fury,\\u201d Mr. Christie writes.\", \"Mr. Christie also describes some of the debate prep sessions that he led for Mr. Trump before he took the stage with President Joseph R. Biden Jr. last year. In one session, Mr. Trump turned to Mr. Christie and began to excoriate him for recommending Christopher Wray for F.B.I. director.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s doing an awful job, and he\\u2019s your pick. He was your pick,\\u201d Mr. Trump told Mr. Christie in front of a half-dozen other Trump aides.\", \"\\u201cHold on a second,\\u201d Mr. Christie replied, praising Mr. Wray. \\u201cHe wasn\\u2019t my pick. He was your pick. He was my recommendation. I\\u2019m not the president. I don\\u2019t get to pick.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Christie reveals how worried he and others were for his survival when he became infected with the coronavirus after being at the White House around the same time that Mr. Trump and several other aides contracted Covid-19. Mr. Christie writes that his priest arrived in the hospital and rubbed oils on his forehead in the sign of the cross, praying over him.\", \"He got a call from a hospitalized Mr. Trump, who had one main concern: \\u201cAre you gonna say you got it from me?\\u201d Mr. Trump asked him.\", \"Mr. Christie is unsparing in the book about Mr. Biden, whose policies he says he cannot align himself with. In the interview, he faulted the president for running as one kind of politician but governing as another, citing the aftermath of the withdrawal from Afghanistan as an example.\", \"\\u201cIf they had known how he was going to govern,\\u201d Mr. Christie said of voters, Mr. Biden may not have won.\"]","href_hash":"4eb21c4c44af11ecab741953355f1660"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4eb21c4c44af11ecab741953355f1660"}},
