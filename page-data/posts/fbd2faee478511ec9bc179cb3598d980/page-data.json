Vaccination required.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-17T01:09:40.000Z","content":"[\"It\\u2019s Wednesday. We\\u2019ll look at plans for a New Year\\u2019s Eve celebration in Times Square that is shaping up to be like those of the past \\u2014 if you are vaccinated. We\\u2019ll also look at an art collection auction that brought in far more than the presale estimates.\", \"The flourishes and frippery of past New Year\\u2019s Eve celebrations will return to Times Square on Dec. 31 \\u2014 the crowd in the cold, the shouted countdown to midnight, the off-key renditions of \\u201cAuld Lang Syne\\u201d \\u2014 and Mayor Bill de Blasio wants the evening to signal the city\\u2019s post-pandemic renaissance.\", \"But there will be a reminder that the coronavirus remains a concern: Only fully vaccinated people will be allowed to attend.\", \"De Blasio said the celebration in Times Square \\u2014 scaled back last year, when officials told people to stay home \\u2014 would unfold \\u201cat full strength\\u201d this time around.\", \"\\u201cWe want it to be big \\u2014 we want it to be full of life,\\u201d de Blasio said. \\u201cNew Year\\u2019s Eve is going to be something beautiful and amazing as part of the comeback of this city.\\u201d\", \"The Times Square celebration will mark his final act as mayor after eight years in office. That will leave any fallout from the event to Eric Adams, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 1.\", \"The celebration will present the usual logistical complexities. But my colleagues Ashley Wong and Dana Rubinstein write that it could also pose philosophical questions for police officers who fought de Blasio\\u2019s vaccination mandate for city employees. The police will not only have to deal with controlling the crowd; they will also have to confirm that the crowd is vaccinated.\", \"Tom Harris, the president of the Times Square Alliance, said that all spectators over age 5 would be asked to show proof of full vaccination; children younger than 5 \\u2014 who are not yet eligible for vaccines \\u2014 will have to be accompanied by a vaccinated adult. Attendees who are unable to get vaccinated because of a disability will have to show that they tested negative for the coronavirus no more than 72 hours before the event. Harris said that masks will be required for any unvaccinated attendees.\", \"Asked at a news conference why vaccination would be mandatory to attend the ball drop when it is not required for many other outdoor activities in New York, de Blasio said a crowded, hourslong event drawing people from around the country and the world required greater precaution.\", \"\\u201cWhen you\\u2019re outdoors with a few hundred thousand people packed close together for hours on end, it\\u2019s a different reality,\\u201d de Blasio said. \\u201cYou\\u2019re talking about a lot of people really close for long periods of time. It makes sense to protect everyone.\\u201d\", \"Several public health experts have cautioned that with the constantly changing nature of the coronavirus, it is difficult to predict what infection rates and caseloads might be at the end of the year. In New York City, the number of Covid-19 cases has edged up in the past couple of weeks, but hospitalizations have stayed low.\", \"Still, Ashish Jha, the dean of the School of Public Health at Brown University, said de Blasio\\u2019s plans for New Year\\u2019s Eve seemed \\u201cvery reasonable.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cVaccines make outdoor events, which are already pretty low risk, exceedingly low risk,\\u201d Dr. Jha said.\", \"Some experts noted the risk would not be limited to Times Square. Attendees will also have to consider what happens on the way to the celebration and after the ball drop, with people going in and out of nearby bars and restaurants to eat, to warm up and to use restrooms. While New York City requires people eating and drinking indoors to provide proof of vaccination, Denis Nash, a professor of epidemiology for the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health and Health Policy, said that those traveling from outside the city should consider the possibility of taking the virus back home.\", \"\\u201cThere will be people coming from places that don\\u2019t have much Covid going on right now,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe need to be thinking about seeding, outbreaks and spread, not just in our own backyards but everywhere.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s a day with increasing clouds, New York. Temps are steady in the mid-50s during the day and throughout the partly cloudy evening.\", \"In effect until Nov. 25 (Thanksgiving Day).\", \"A post-mortem on the sale of part of the art collection amassed by the real estate developer Harry Macklowe and his former wife, Linda, an honorary trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art:\", \"No, the giant his-and-her portraits of Macklowe and his second wife, Patricia Landeau, were not included \\u2014 the giant portraits that hung on the side of Macklowe\\u2019s building on Billionaire\\u2019s Row as \\u201ca proclamation of love\\u201d in 2019. The art collection was assembled in the decades before he told Linda Macklowe their marriage was over and their lawyers began fighting about what it was worth.\", \"When Sotheby\\u2019s sold 35 of the works on Monday, their worth was $676.1 million, $276 million more than Sotheby\\u2019s had estimated \\u2014 a testament to the strength at the top of the art market. Trends in the market played out in the salesroom, notably in strong buying from Asia, which accounted for 30 percent of Sotheby\\u2019s total sales last year.\", \"The 35 works represent only part of the collection. Sotheby\\u2019s will sell more in May.\", \"[Blue-Chip Art From Bitter Macklowe Divorce Brings $676 Million at Sotheby\\u2019s]\", \"Brooke Lampley, a Sotheby\\u2019s executive, called the sale on Monday \\u201cthe most valuable single-owner auction ever staged.\\u201d It was followed on Tuesday by the sale of Frida Kahlo\\u2019s \\u201cDiego and I\\u201d for $34.9 million, which made it the most valuable work of Latin American art ever sold at auction. Sotheby\\u2019s identified the buyer as Eduardo Costantini, who founded a museum in Buenos Aires.\", \"My colleague Robin Pogrebin writes that in the Macklowe sale, the top lots included Alberto Giacometti\\u2019s craggy 1964 sculpture \\u201cLe Nez\\u201d (\\u201cThe Nose\\u201d), which sold for $78.4 million. On Tuesday, the cryptocurrency entrepreneur Justin Sun revealed on Twitter that he was the buyer. \\u201cWe got it!\\u201d he wrote.\", \"Auction-high prices were set for Jackson Pollock, whose \\u201cNumber 17, 1951,\\u201d from his Black Paintings series, sold for $61 million with fees, and for Agnes Martin, whose \\u201cUntitled #44,\\u201d featuring slender bands of subtle color, sold for $17.7 million.\", \"Given the absence of artists of color in Monday\\u2019s sale and the scarcity of women \\u2014 only Agnes Martin and Tauba Auerbach were included \\u2014 the auction to some symbolized a chapter from the past. \\u201cThis is the collection of a generation that\\u2019s passing \\u2014 an old white man\\u2019s collection,\\u201d said Adam Lindemann, the gallerist and collector. \\u201cYes, these things are always going to be great, but is this what a young tech billionaire wants?

Threading his hands through my hair, he lifted the strands to snip, comb and repeat. It felt comfortable and routine again.\", \"Then, as he pushed my head downward to trim along the nape of my neck, I suddenly felt the scissors stop. Slamming them down beneath the mirror, the barber rushed out the door and began to run down the block.\", \"I watched it all through the window, a long flop of hair he had just abandoned drooping over my forehead. Everyone else there seemed unfazed. What had happened? I had no idea.\", \"Minutes later, the barber returned. He was sweating. He continued the haircut as if nothing had happened. He didn\\u2019t say anything, and neither did I.\", \"When he finished, I tipped him with a few folded bills.\", \"\\u201cThank you,\\u201d he replied, the most he had said to that point. \\u201cGenerous.\\u201d\", \"\\u2014 Dillon Fernando\", \"Illustrated by Agnes Lee.
