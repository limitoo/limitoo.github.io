When added with the angle at which the feature sits on the rock face - these all undermine its structural integrity.\\\"\", \"That led to the need for ongoing monitoring of the bluff for the safety of road users and the public.\", \"Building platforms using scaffolding will be required, with close to 100 rock bolts used to stabilise the rock face.\", \"Choveaux said it would be \\\"significantly disruptive\\\" to road users to remove through blasting, using explosives.\", \"\\\"The majority of the work can be completed with the road remaining open to two lanes with minimal disruption to road users, but there will need to be closures as abseilers and drilling gear is set up and moved around the rock face.\\\"\", \"Choveaux said if conditions changed, the road could be closed for stabilisation work to be completed.\", \"Given the current levels of movement, Waka Kotahi was comfortable with the timeframes in place to get the safety work started.\", \"People who travel between Cromwell and Queenstown on State Highway 6, will need to factor in short delays, up to 10 minutes at a time on weekdays between 8am and 5pm.\"]","href_hash":"4765af9a7c2111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4765af9a7c2111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
