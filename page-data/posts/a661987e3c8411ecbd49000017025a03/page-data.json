For all of the salutary services a writer\\u2019s biography can offer \\u2014 the tracing of the life, the contextualizing of the work, the resuscitation of a reputation and the deliverance from neglect \\u2014 the biographer has been derided as a \\u201cpost-mortem exploiter\\u201d (Henry James) and a \\u201cprofessional burglar\\u201d (Janet Malcolm).\", \"The critic Elizabeth Hardwick called biography \\u201ca scrofulous cottage industry,\\u201d adding that it was rarely redeemed by \\u201csome equity between the subject and the author.\\u201d One biographer of Ernest Hemingway, Hardwick wrote, seemed so enamored of \\u201chis access to the raw materials\\u201d that he produced \\u201conly an accumulation, a heap.\\u201d Similarly, a book about Katherine Anne Porter was larded with \\u201can accumulation of the facts,\\u201d which had \\u201cthe effect of a crushing army.\\u201d\", \"A warning, then, was probably in order for Cathy Curtis, the author of \\u201cA Splendid Intelligence: The Life of Elizabeth Hardwick.\\u201d\", \"Curtis, whose previous subjects include the midcentury painters Grace Hartigan and Elaine de Kooning, has written the kind of straightforward, informative book that Hardwick frequently deplored \\u2014 a \\u201cscrupulous accounting of time\\u201d (as Hardwick derisively put it), a recitation of the facts that stretch across Hardwick\\u2019s long life, with scarcely little that truly captures the compressed intensity of the work itself.\", \"Still, the book is a start. \\u201cA Splendid Intelligence\\u201d is the first biography of a writer who is mainly known among the other writers who revere her, serving as a solid (if stolid) resource and accessible introduction. Ample quotations from Hardwick allow her restless quiddity to come through.\", \"As a biographer, Curtis is sober, respectful, diligent; having sifted her way through a paper trail that covered Hardwick\\u2019s 91 years, it\\u2019s as if she realized she had a responsibility to include some of Hardwick\\u2019s own vociferous complaints about the genre. \\u201cA Splendid Intelligence\\u201d begins with lines from the last page of Hardwick\\u2019s autobiographical novel, \\u201cSleepless Nights,\\u201d that gently rebuke the fixation on biographical detail: \\u201cSometimes I resent the glossary, the concordance of truth many have about my personal life, have like an extra pair of spectacles. Such fact is to me a hindrance to memory.\\u201d Curtis has decided to elide the short phrase \\u201chave like an extra pair of spectacles,\\u201d replacing it with an efficient set of ellipses \\u2014 forsaking an elegant metaphor in what looks like an overzealous pursuit of readability.\", \"Hardwick wasn\\u2019t especially enamored of \\u201creadability,\\u201d which she called a \\u201ccozy little word.\\u201d She was drawn to the thickets of ambiguity and contradiction. She wrote about Hedda Gabler\\u2019s \\u201cbeguiling coldness\\u201d and Sylvia Plath\\u2019s mixture of \\u201cdomesticity and annihilation.\\u201d Gabler, a fictional character, seemed to be just as real for Hardwick as the decidedly nonfictional Plath. In \\u201cSleepless Nights\\u201d Hardwick blurred the line between experience and imagination, with a narrator named Elizabeth whom we get to know mostly through her observations of others. At one moment she slows down and lingers on the view outside her window; at another she speeds through \\u201cdivorce, abandonment, the unacceptable and the unattainable, ennui filled with action, sad, tumultuous middle-age years shaken by crashings, uprootings, coups, desperate renewals.\\u201d\", \"Curtis, by contrast, treats time methodically \\u2014 a steady accrual of and then, and then, and then. Hardwick was born in 1916 in Lexington, Ky., the eighth child of 11. Her father, a charming, lackadaisical plumber, secretly siphoned off what little money the family had to procure for himself a boat, which was discovered only after his death. Hardwick attended the University of Kentucky before moving to New York to pursue a Ph.D. at Columbia, summarily dropping out by skipping her oral exams. She followed that by writing a novel, some short stories, some criticism; The Partisan Review became a home for her work, as did The New Yorker. In 1963, Hardwick helped found The New York Review of Books.\", \"In an author\\u2019s note, Curtis announces that this biography of Hardwick will include \\u201conly as much information about her famous husband, the poet Robert Lowell, as is necessary to tell the story of her life.\\u201d It turns out that \\u201conly as much\\u201d amounts to quite a lot, as Lowell begins to consume more and more space, in both the book and the couple\\u2019s marriage. His manic episodes, his genius, his cruelty, his \\u201cinfatuations\\u201d \\u2014 Curtis clearly dislikes him, and her matter-of-fact account cannot access whatever it was that connected the pair, besides the daughter they shared. Hardwick and Lowell stayed married for more than 20 years, until he left her in 1970 for Caroline Blackwood and pilfered Hardwick\\u2019s letters for his poetry. Hardwick was crushed and humiliated, while Lowell insisted he knew exactly what she was going through. \\u201cI think I am living through many of your feelings,\\u201d he wrote to her. \\u201cI suffer.\\u201d\", \"The \\u201970s turned out to be an extraordinarily productive time for Hardwick \\u2014 a decade when she wrote the essays on women and literature that were collected in \\u201cSeduction and Betrayal,\\u201d and when she polished the scenes that she collaged into \\u201cSleepless Nights.\\u201d Curtis assiduously chronicles the literary panels, the gossip and the ailments of Hardwick\\u2019s later years, before she died in 2007, observing the rhythms of Hardwick\\u2019s work while never quite falling into sync with them. But then a march is different from a dance, even if each has its own choreography. When Hardwick was in her late 80s and still writing, she was asked why writers stop. \\u201cWriting is so hard,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the only time in your life when you have to think.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a661987e3c8411ecbd49000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a661987e3c8411ecbd49000017025a03"}},
