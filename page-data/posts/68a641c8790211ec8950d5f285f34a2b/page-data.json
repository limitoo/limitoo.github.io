That's likely to greatly lessen that impact, Reuters said.\", \" Dubai-based Emirates, a key carrier for East-West travel, announced it would halt flights to Boston, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Miami, Newark, New Jersey, Orlando, Florida, San Francisco and Seattle over the issue beginning Wednesday. It said it would continue flights to Los Angeles, New York and Washington.\", \" In its announcement, Emirates cited the cancellation as necessary due to \\\"operational concerns associated with the planned deployment of 5G mobile network services in the U.S. at certain airports.\\\"\", \" \\\"We are working closely with aircraft manufacturers and the relevant authorities to alleviate operational concerns, and we hope to resume our U.S. services as soon as possible,\\\" the state-owned airline said. \", \" The United Arab Emirates successfully rolled out 5G coverage all around its airports without incident.
