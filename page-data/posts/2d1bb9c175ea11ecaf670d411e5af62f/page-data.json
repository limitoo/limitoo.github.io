The conditions were so oppressive \\u2014 on-court temperatures reached 115 Fahrenheit (46 Celsius) \\u2014 that both players slumped against stadium backdrops between points, even after bathing in ice during a 10-minute break between the second and third sets. They even took turns plopping their worn-out bodies down in a lineswoman\\u2019s chair.\", \"It\\u2019s been 20 years since Capriati came back from a set and 4-0 down to defeat Hingis 4-6, 7-6 (9-7), 6-2 and claim the third and final major of her career. In doing so, she became the first woman in Grand Slam history to save four match points and win the title.\", \"\\u201cThe way they both were hitting in that match was just amazing,\\u201d said Harold Solomon, Capriati\\u2019s coach from 1999 to 2000. \\u201cJennifer was an amazing ball striker because she took the ball so early and she wasn\\u2019t afraid, even when she was down. She was as good an athlete as anyone who has ever been in the game, and that includes the Williams sisters.\\u201d\", \"The match would go down as one of the greatest comebacks in women\\u2019s Grand Slam tennis history. No woman since has saved four match points to win a major final.\", \"Capriati had her professional debut in March 1990, just before her 14th birthday and reached the semifinals of the French Open that year and the round of 16 at Wimbledon and the United States Open. By the end of the season she had won her first WTA tournament and was ranked within the world\\u2019s top 10.\", \"Hingis was also a child prodigy. She reached her first U.S. Open semifinal in 1996 when she was 15 years old. The following year she advanced to the finals of all four majors, winning Wimbledon and the Australian and U.S. Opens.\", \"In 1992, Capriati beat Steffi Graf to win gold at the Barcelona Olympics. But a series of events in 1993 and \\u201994, including a shoplifting charge, an arrest for marijuana possession and a stint in drug rehab, nearly derailed her career.\", \"But Capriati fought her way back, and in 2001 she won the Australian Open by beating Hingis, the world No. 1. Capriati followed that up with a win over Kim Clijsters in the final of the French Open and semifinal finishes at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open. In October 2001, Capriati became No. 1 in the world.\", \"\\u201cDetermination and will were always strong suits for Jennifer,\\u201d said Denise Capriati, Jennifer\\u2019s mother, by phone from her Florida home. \\u201cShe always knew how to fight.\\u201d\", \"But no match was as striking as the 2002 Australian final. Hingis raced to a 6-4, 4-0 lead and held a point for 5-0. She did so by using Capriati\\u2019s blistering pace to hit short angles followed by forays to the net and soft touch volley winners.\", \"But Hingis double-faulted on a key point and Capriati took advantage. She saved one match point with a backhand down-the-line winner and another after a 14-stroke rally. Two more match points went by the wayside in the tiebreaker prompting Hingis to toss her racket in disgust before both players left the court for the cool of the locker room.\", \"\\u201cAt that point, we knew Jennifer had the match,\\u201d said her mother, who was seated in the players\\u2019 box. \\u201cShe was better in the heat.\\u201d\", \"Hingis had leg cramps and was treated after the fifth game of the third set. In the next game she served three inexplicable foot faults and handed the crucial break to Capriati.\", \"\\u201cI really don\\u2019t know how I managed to win,\\u201d Capriati said at the time. \\u201cI got my second wind, third wind, fourth wind, I don\\u2019t know how many winds out there.\\u201d\", \"For Hingis, who reached the Australian final six straight years, winning the title from 1997 to \\u201999, the loss was devastating. \\u201cIt was a tough final for her to lose, and it\\u2019s difficult for her to talk about/want to reflect,\\u201d Natasha Marks, her representative, said in a text message. Hingis declined to be interviewed for this article.\", \"Capriati did not respond to repeated phone and text messages.\", \"After the hype early in her career, Capriati engineered her own free fall and then her own resurgence. The 2002 Australian Open was the culmination.\", \"\\u201cShe wanted it so bad,\\u201d Denise said. \\u201cShe had fought so hard and done so many things. She was so disciplined to come back. She was doing it just for herself.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"2d1bb9c175ea11ecaf670d411e5af62f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2d1bb9c175ea11ecaf670d411e5af62f"}},
