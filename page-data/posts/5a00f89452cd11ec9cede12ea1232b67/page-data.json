The self-tests I had done were all negative.\\\"\", \"But the 65-year-old's condition worsened significantly and he was admitted to hospital in early November after experiencing low oxygen levels and difficulty breathing. Medical staff at the hospital administered a PCR test, which came up positive, German weekly Die Zeit reported.\", \"Biacsics refused the treatment plan that doctors offered him, convinced that he had beaten the acute infection. Eventually, he decided to leave the hospital, calling his son who picked him up and took him home.\", \"Biacsics ordered everything he needed to administer chlorine dioxide infusions to himself. But just two days later, he passed away. It is not clear whether Biacsics' consumption of CDL contributed to his death.\", \"Biacsics had previously made false claims that chlorine dioxide could be used to treat COVID-19 infections.\", \"According to the FDA, consuming products that contain chlorine dioxide can potentially be \\\"life-threatening.\\\"\", \"Consumption of these products can lead to serious adverse events including respiratory failure, changes in the electrical activity of the heart, life-threatening low blood pressure caused by dehydration, acute liver failure, low blood cell counts, severe vomiting and severe diarrhea.\", \"Chlorine is commonly used to disinfect drinking water and it is safe for this purpose when used in very small amounts. When used in large quantities, however, it can be dangerous.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943317/chlorine-dioxide-product.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Stock image showing a chlorine dioxide product.
