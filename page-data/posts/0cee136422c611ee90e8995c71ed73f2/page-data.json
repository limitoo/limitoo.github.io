While Robinson added 24cm on to her four-year-old Oceania record with a 11.59m effort, Malkamaki effectively sealed the competition by enhancing the world record of Yukiko Saito of Japan by 55cm with that gargantuan 13.02m hurl.\", \"Robinson, who is coached by Raylene Bates, said: \\\"It feels cool (to podium in the shot). I wasn't expecting silver I thought bronze would have been the tussle, but I'm super stoked and over the moon with silver.\", \"\\\"I had some clear goals with shot, and I knew what I needed to do to get the distances that I wanted, I'm just glad it all worked out on the day.\", \"\\\"I was pretty happy with how I threw. We had a solid field, and anyone could have taken those second and third spots, so I'm really happy I got the distance.\", \"'It seems weird that I will going into the Paralympics as the world shot silver medallist and fourth in javelin, so it is kind of backwards for me. But I'm really excited to see what the next year holds. It would be cool to compete in two events and medal in two events at the Paris Paralympics.\\\"\", \"- RNZ\"]","href_hash":"0cee136422c611ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0cee136422c611ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
