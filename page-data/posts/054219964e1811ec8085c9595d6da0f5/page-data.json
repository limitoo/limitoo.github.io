Locals trickled in. Across the street, Columbus Avenue was packed.\", \"Last year, Andy\\u2019s was closed, the first time Mr. Spathis, who\\u2019s owned the business for 33 years, was not open on Thanksgiving. And while this year Mr. Spathis opened at 5 a.m., the morning was quiet.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not surprising to me,\\u201d he said, after handing some coffees to wranglers for the Pillsbury Doughboy balloon. \\u201cWith the pandemic, everything is slow.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s getting along little by little,\\u201d he added later. \\u201cIt might take another year.\\u201d\", \"Businesses and entrepreneurs along Columbus Avenue, parallel to the parade route along Central Park West, had mixed reactions to whether the parade\\u2019s comeback and the foot traffic brought with it an economic boost. For some, the morning yawned on no differently from other mornings. For others, its return brought a high volume of customers.\", \"A few blocks away, Mast Market, which opened one week ago, had its first lull in the morning at about 9:30. The shop normally opened a half-hour earlier than normal.\", \"\\u201cThere were enough people lined up outside peering in,\\u201d Robin Mates, the market\\u2019s manager, said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s been nonstop.\\u201d\", \"Banca Grucan stood on Columbus, yelling as she hawked balloons, including a Buzz Lightyear one.\", \"Originally from Ecuador, Ms. Grucan has been selling her wares on Thanksgiving morning for 12 years. She had barely sold 20 balloons by about 10 a.m, she said in Spanish, less than half of what she sold in years past. \", \"For the past 40 years, Thomas Johnson has trekked from Connecticut to sell turkey hats on Thanksgiving. Last year, was the first he did not make the yearly pilgrimage. \\u201cIt was depressing,\\u201d Mr. Johnson, 62, said.\", \"On Thursday, Mr. Johnson was all smiles as he stood on the corner of 73rd Street and Columbus Avenue. \", \"\\u201cTurkey hats,\\u201d he shouted, gobbling like a turkey with his signature headgear. \", \"One happy customer called out to him from the street: \\u201cMy gobbling friend you got me looking good on Facebook \\u2014 thank you so much!\\u201d \", \"Business was so brisk he could barely keep up with demand. By early morning, he had sold about 100 hats and was ordering more from a supplier. \", \"\\u201cI love it \\u2014 I love it!\\u201d Mr. Johnson said, holding some turkey hats and throwing his hands up in the air. The people and the costumes bring him joy, he said. He posed for at least one photo with costumers.\", \"\\u201cIf my friends could see me now, they\\u2019d be laughing,\\u201d he added later, saying he\\u2019s a teacher. \\u201cI wear a suit and tie normally.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"054219964e1811ec8085c9595d6da0f5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"054219964e1811ec8085c9595d6da0f5"}},
