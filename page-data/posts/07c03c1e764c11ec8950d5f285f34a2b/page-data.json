About one-third have been donated by rich nations, despite COVAX's initial plans to supply only jabs procured directly by the programme with a budget of more than $US10 billion in donors' funds.\", \"The change of strategy has led to delays, as donors have often requested to send doses to countries selected by them.\", \"Despite the recent surge in deliveries, vaccine inequity remains high. The latest WHO data shows 67 percent of the population in richer nations have been fully vaccinated, compared with only 5 percent in poorer nations. More than 40 percent of the world's population has not yet received a first dose.\", \"Gavi, a vaccine alliance which co-manages COVAX, is seeking more funds to reach the WHO's goal of vaccinating 70 percent of the population in poorer nations by July.\", \"-Reuters\"]","href_hash":"07c03c1e764c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"07c03c1e764c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
