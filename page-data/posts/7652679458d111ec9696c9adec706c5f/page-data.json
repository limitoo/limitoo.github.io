In the IPL season preceding, he'd been dropped for the first time by SunRisers Hyderabad, and only those who inhabit that claustrophobic world could know the pressures that come with the pay cheques.\", \"Maybe there is just a non-specific siege mentality in the Warner household. For years now, they've weathered scandals and slights that peaked with the overzealous punishments and prolonged public shaming of 2018's Sandpapergate \\u2014\\u00a0perhaps fresher and more intense in the Warners' minds than ours.\", \"After Cape Town, being denied the chance to represent his country seemed to wound Warner in some fundamental way. A better sense of proportion was found before this first Ashes Test at the Gabba. Presenting a Baggy Green cap to Alex Carey, Adam Gilchrist labelled his Test spot a privilege, not a right, telling Carey it made him no better than the man in the stands.\", \"In his first Test innings of the summer, Warner made 94 from 176 deliveries. Shane Warne rolled out the classic line for\\u00a0such situations: \\\"He deserved a hundred.\\\"\", \"In truth, it was an uncharacteristic Warner innings in style and content, and he was lucky it lasted so long. But for its eventual effect, Warner deserves immense credit.\", \"The lagged impact was felt late in the day. England's bowling attack, compromised not just by the fatigue that Warner engenders but niggles to Ollie Robinson and Ben Stokes, wilted in the afternoon heat. In stepped Travis Head, striking the ball in the more traditionally Warneresque style.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d354e730866e414e4c0e95d80debf80a\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Century maker Travis Head (right)\\u00a0was aggressive against the English bowlers.(AP: Tertius Pickard)</div>\", \"Head's 85-ball century, his first in Ashes cricket, prompted a wild-eyed celebration that spoke of his own battle with expectation. It came under pressure too \\u2014 on the heels of Warner's departure and a golden duck for Cameron Green, by which point Australia had collapsed from the safety of 2-189 to a shaky 5-196.\", \"It finished 7-343, its lead of 196 bolstered also by Warner's 162-run stand with\\u00a0Marnus Labuschagne for the second wicket.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Fortune favours Warner</div>\", \"To lay the foundation, Warner received an abundance of good fortune.\", \"On 17, he was bowled by Stokes's fourth delivery of the day, but it was a no ball \\u2014\\u00a0hardly misfortune on the bowler's behalf, for umpire Rod Tucker had missed Stokes overstepping with each of his previous three efforts.\", \"After lunch \\u2014\\u00a0from a thick Warner edge \\u2014\\u00a0Rory Burns had his second horror moment of the game and dropped a soda off Robinson.\", \"On 60, Warner offered a straightforward run-out chance to Haseeb Hameed and survived again.\", \"In the lead-up to this series, much discussion was devoted to the resumption of Warner's one-sided battle with Stuart Broad.\", \"The implication of Broad's non-selection was that Warner would flourish, and to an extent he did. Yet in the morning session, he could only master spinner Jack Leach, who bore the brunt of the frustrations provided by England's alternatives.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/45e49a0377e4695b182e70c9880d5ae6\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Ollie Robinson (right)\\u00a0removed Warner for 94.(AP: Tertius Pickard)</div>\", \"With extreme pace and bounce, Wood troubled Warner endlessly, and deserved better than 1-57 from 20 overs. Chris Woakes drew airy swipes. Before injury struck, Stokes hammered Warner in the ribs. Robinson's eventual success followed the maintenance of impeccable lines and wicked lateral movement that flummoxed Warner.\", \"But in a contest like this, Warner's contribution should prove telling.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Warner crucial to Australian success</div>\", \"Warner is 35 now, an age at which opening batters \\u2014\\u00a0reliant on sharp reflexes, nimble feet and good eyes \\u2014\\u00a0have traditionally commenced an unwinnable battle against time.\", \"But the more you study Australia's alternative openers, the more you hope Warner sets himself to become an outlier.\", \"Perhaps his figure of inspiration will be Graham Gooch, whose prolonged twilight of big runs restored respect to English cricket.\", \"Like Warner, Gooch's response to cricketing middle age was to get himself fitter than rivals 15 years younger. He was north of 35 when he compiled his landmark 333 in 1990 and 41 when he played his last Test.\", \"It is harder to imagine Gooch as brand ambassador for India's Delux Sports Company, as Warner now is. They market Warner's product line as \\\"the most aggressive thing in cricket\\\", a long way from The Don's bashful adverts for neatly pressed, double-pleated flannels, or even Warnie's Advanced Hair.\", \"In Warner's case, the marketing clich\\u00e9\\u00a0is also true. His mouth and his armoury of crunching boundary shots are well known, but he does basically everything else aggressively too \\u2014 his blocks go for four, his running between the wickets causes panic, his clapping to encourage the bowlers is manic. He even leaves the ball aggressively.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/19d973a42fa79a3af46e99b8e405b8d6\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Warner's position at the top of the order will be crucial to Australia's hopes of retaining the Ashes.(AAP: Dave Hunt)</div>\", \"At the top of the order, such certainty and consistency of approach \\u2014 whatever form it takes \\u2014\\u00a0remains crucial to Australia's success.\", \"Contrast Warner's hard-handed start to the summer with dithering Marcus Harris, who half-heartedly poked at a series of nothing shots before Robinson inevitably nicked him off for 3.\", \"Warner is one of those players who goes up a gear at Test level. Harris, who has piled on first-class runs in the last six months, seems to shrink.\", \"Even critics of in-form, confident Usman Khawaja could not imagine him playing so meekly. The dilemma only magnifies Warner's ongoing importance.\", \"And what of England? Before play, Allan Border of all people struck a conciliatory note when discussing the tourists' exclusion of Broad and Jimmy Anderson.\", \"\\\"Don't bag the decision too much today,\\\" Border warned.\", \"\\\"We'll wait and see tonight.\\\"\", \"Actually, even in the morning it was a little beside the point. Wood and Robinson could not have given more.\", \"Robinson ended the day with 3-48 from 18 probing overs, eight of them maidens. Elsewhere, only Leach looked hopeless. The paltry score England is defending remains the bigger problem.\", \"Australia has won 21 of the Tests in which Warner made his 24 centuries. Here, close enough should be good enough.\"]","href_hash":"7652679458d111ec9696c9adec706c5f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7652679458d111ec9696c9adec706c5f"}},
