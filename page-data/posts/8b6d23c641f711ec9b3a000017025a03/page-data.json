The two-year renovation, led by Studio Robert McKinley, preserved the property\\u2019s most striking features, such as the entryway\\u2019s grand staircase and the Victorian-tile-framed brick fireplace in the cozy lounge, juxtaposing them with vintage and modern furniture. Each of the 13 guest suites features plush beds framed with white oak headboards, cantilevered side tables \\u00e0 la Gio Ponti and desk chairs draped in Italian velvet, as well as contemporary artworks curated by Lolita Cros. Guests have complimentary co-working privileges at nearby Barnfox and can enjoy breakfast frittatas and buttermilk pancakes at Restaurant Kinsley or evening room service from Lola Pizza. From $259, hotelkinsley.com.\", \"The fashion photographer Mert Alas, one half of the duo Mert and Marcus, has had a love-hate relationship with gin. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been a gin drinker for many years,\\u201d he says, \\u201cand I love a martini. But I would always complain about the ingredients.\\u201d So he decided to make his own, employing exotic botanicals like wild ivy from Albania, damask rose from Turkey and the Queen of the Night orchid cactus, which blooms for only a few hours once a year. Whereas most gin producers mash the botanicals together and only then mix them with a neutral spirit, Alas, inspired by the techniques of perfume makers, distilled each element individually before blending them. The result of such exacting craft is the \\u201ceau de nuit\\u201d Seventy One \\u2014 a reference to the number of days the gin needs to mature in oak casks before being bottled \\u2014 a delicate amber-colored mix of floral, peat and citrus flavors. $190, seventyonegin.com.\", \"Ever since Salvatore Ferragamo designed his iconic Rainbow platform sandals for Judy Garland in 1938, chunky raised heels have gone in and out of fashion, arguably cresting in popularity during the glam rock \\u201970s and resurging in the \\u201990s thanks largely to the Spice Girls. And if this fall\\u2019s collections hinted at the style\\u2019s imminent comeback, the recent spring 2022 shows only confirmed the trend: Jonathan Anderson at Loewe added an exaggerated wedge sole on a classic loafer; Miuccia Prada released an array of elevated footwear ranging from lime green sequined booties to simple dress shoes; and British designer Molly Goddard paired her playful frocks with three-inch-heeled Mary Janes. For those who can\\u2019t wait until next year, Goddard\\u2019s collaboration with Ugg, a slip-on in lamb suede with a lambskin insole, is available now.\", \"In \\u201cSandor Katz\\u2019s Fermentation Journeys,\\u201d which will be published on Nov. 2, the author of the James Beard Award-winning \\u201cArt of Fermentation\\u201d transposes his obsession with one of mankind\\u2019s foundational culinary processes into a cookbook-cum-travelogue. Where Katz\\u2019s classic 2012 treatment was encyclopedic in scope and structure, his new book is built on years of close interactions with masters of pickles and cheeses, dried fish and sourdough breads from virtually every corner of the globe. Interspersed among conversational but informative essays are 60 recipes for dishes ranging from akhuni, a soy bean condiment native to northeast India, to a lightly alcoholic chicha made from quinoa, corn and dried fava beans in the Peruvian Andes. $35, chelseagreen.com.\", \"Loro Piana, the nearly century-old house known for its refined knitwear, has partnered with the Japanese designer, musician and arbiter of cool Hiroshi Fujiwara for its first-ever collaboration. Fujiwara, \\u201ca one-man hype machine,\\u201d as GQ once labeled him, gives the Italian brand\\u2019s trademark fabrics a streetwear spin: Cashmere is stylishly frayed or woven into graphic patterns like the interlocking \\u201cTsunaghi\\u201d chain, a symbol of happiness in Japan; Tasmanian wool lines a reversible bomber jacket. And, in a cheeky nod to the source of it all, Fujiwara has designed T-shirts pairing fabric words with images of the corresponding animals (e.g., \\u201ccashmere\\u201d with a horned goat). us.loropiana.com.\"]","href_hash":"8b6d23c641f711ec9b3a000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8b6d23c641f711ec9b3a000017025a03"}},
