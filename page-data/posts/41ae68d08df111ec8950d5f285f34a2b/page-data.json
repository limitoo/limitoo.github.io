It has been carefully planned. It shows that Omicron is now getting the upper hand.\\\"\", \"He praised public health officials for their \\\"Rolls-Royce\\\" contact tracing but said there was now no choice except to move to phase two.\", \"However, his greatest concern is the numbers who are still to get their booster shot, he told Morning Report.\", \"\\\"I'm amazed that there's more than a million New Zealanders who are eligible for the booster dose who have not yet taken up that opportunity.
