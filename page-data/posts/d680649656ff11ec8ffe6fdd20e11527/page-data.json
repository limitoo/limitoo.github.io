To the contrary, they are evolving rapidly.\", \"Imagine a hostile country shutting down New York City\\u2019s electrical grid for months at a time using code-breaking quantum computers. Imagine pirates in cyberspace disabling American missile defense systems without warning. Imagine China obtaining the private health data or private phone communications of millions of Americans, including members of Congress.\", \"These aren\\u2019t nutty hypotheticals in some distant dystopian future. They are scenarios that keep American national security officials up at night right now.\", \"\\u201cWe have already reached the point where the behaviors of a limited group of talented actors in cyberspace could completely obliterate systems that we rely on for our day-to-day survival,\\u201d Candace Rondeaux, a specialist on the future of warfare at New America, a Washington-based think tank, told me.\", \"The Biden administration\\u2019s response has been to counter those threats by gathering a coalition of democracies that will work together to safeguard our economies, our militaries and our technological networks from bad actors in China, Russia and elsewhere. That\\u2019s the reason President Biden and European counterparts formed the U.S.-E.U. Trade and Technology Council, which established working groups to develop new technology and prevent it from falling into the wrong hands. \", \"It\\u2019s the reason Mr. Biden met with the heads of state of Australia, India and Japan \\u2014 world powers on China\\u2019s doorstep \\u2014 to ensure that \\u201cthe way in which technology is designed, developed, governed and used is shaped by our shared values and respect for universal human rights.\\u201d And it\\u2019s the reason Mr. Biden has called together more than 100 leaders from democratic countries around the world for a virtual Summit for Democracy this Thursday and Friday.\", \"At this week\\u2019s summit, there will be plenty of familiar-sounding pledges to root out corruption and defend human rights. There is likely to be hand-wringing about coups that reversed fragile progress in Sudan and Myanmar, and condemnations of leaders who used the pandemic as an excuse to crack down on opposition and dissent, including those in El Salvador, Hungary and Uganda.\", \"But at its core, this conference is not just about protecting democracy at home and abroad. It\\u2019s also about how open societies will defend themselves in the future against existential technological threats. As countries like China and Russia invest heavily in artificial intelligence and quantum computing, and exercise intensive state control over data, the United States and its allies need a game plan. What rules should be adopted to govern the use of artificial intelligence, quantum computing and space travel? How do we make sure those technologies aren\\u2019t weaponized against us?\", \"The Biden administration is attempting to forge a common front with allies in Europe and Asia across technological, economic and military spheres to prepare for an age of technological competition that will look far different from any geopolitical rivalry that the world has ever seen. Democracy is the common thread stringing the Biden administration\\u2019s efforts together. It\\u2019s the code word for who\\u2019s on our team.\", \"\\u201cThis is the operating system for the administration\\u2019s vision for how it thinks about the world now,\\u201d Joshua Meltzer, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who focuses on trade, told me.\", \"Mr. Biden, who has been promising to hold this conference since he was a candidate, couches the new threats in old Cold War terminology \\u2014 as the \\u201cfree world\\u201d coming together to push back against fascism and authoritarianism.\", \"Of course, there\\u2019s plenty of risk in framing the challenge in those terms. First, there\\u2019s the awkwardness of acknowledging that many of the countries on Team Democracy have been democratically challenged in recent years, starting with the United States itself. Almost no corner of the world has been left unscathed by the erosion of democratic norms. Poland\\u2019s ruling party has targeted its independent judiciary and is battling the European Union over what it means to uphold the rule of law. \", \"India, the world\\u2019s largest democracy, was downgraded to \\u201cpartly free\\u201d by Freedom House with the continued silencing of dissent and rise of Hindu nationalism and attacks on Muslim citizens. In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has targeted journalists who have called out corruption and disinformation. India, Poland and the Philippines are all expected at Mr. Biden\\u2019s democracy summit. Of course they are. We need them on our team.\", \"Once we acknowledge that no democracy is perfect and that all countries sit somewhere on a spectrum between \\u201cfree\\u201d and \\u201cunfree,\\u201d the dividing line between \\u201cus\\u201d and \\u201cthem\\u201d gets muddier. In a rare op-ed essay, the Russian and Chinese ambassadors in Washington argued that the United States has no right to sit in judgment over which nations are democracies and which nations are not. They argued that their countries should be considered democracies too. After all, Chinese citizens can join the Communist Party and participate in some deliberations.\", \"\\u201cWhat China has is an extensive, whole-process socialist democracy,\\u201d China\\u2019s ambassador, Qin Gang, and Russia\\u2019s ambassador, Anatoly Antonov, wrote in The National Interest. \\u201cIt reflects the people\\u2019s will, suits the country\\u2019s realities, and enjoys strong support from the people.\\u201d\", \"While those arguments are not particularly convincing, they did make a point that rang true. Carving up the world into \\u201cus\\u201d and \\u201cthem\\u201d could complicate efforts to solve other existential problems facing both the free and unfree: climate change, pandemics and mass migration.\", \"If the world is split between countries with authoritarian governments that exercise absolute control over technology, expression and data, and more open societies that adopt different standards, technology itself could bifurcate. Just as appliances in some parts of the world run on 110 volts while other parts run on 220 volts, emerging technologies could diverge, reshaping the boundary lines of the future in ways that are difficult to predict. That\\u2019s already happening. For example, on 5G internet service, much of the world will use Chinese telecom equipment, while countries that want to protect privacy and data will use American equipment.\", \"Some say the world will eventually be divided into countries that fall into China\\u2019s orbit \\u2014 those that have signed up to have their infrastructure built by China\\u2019s \\u201cBelt and Road\\u201d program \\u2014 and those that fall into the orbit of the United States and Europe, which are scrambling to offer their own plan to fund infrastructure in the developing world under the banner of \\u201cBuild Back Better World.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt won\\u2019t be quite as sharp a line as the Iron Curtain was, and we shouldn\\u2019t demand that it be,\\u201d Matt Pottinger, a former deputy national security adviser, told me. He said he believes that countries will form new and overlapping coalitions based on the specific technology in question and that many countries will end up working with both China and the United States.\", \"But the idea of a global split runs against the grain of the current reality of deep interdependence between the Chinese economy and our own. How do you \\u201ccontain\\u201d a country that owns about 14 percent of our national debt? A country we rely on to supply us with everything from penicillin to iPhones?\", \"The last problem with framing the challenge around the language of democracy versus authoritarianism is that it doesn\\u2019t take into account, for instance, the role that American tech companies continue to play in selling capabilities to the Chinese military.\", \"\\u201cThis is where the democracy summit has challenges conceptually,\\u201d Ms. Rondeaux told me. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very oriented around the idea that nation-states are the big players. But I don\\u2019t think in today\\u2019s 21st-century world order that nation-states are the most important or even the most powerful actors.\\u201d\", \"Some tech companies are becoming as powerful as governments. It\\u2019s worth noting that many states \\u2014 authoritarian and democratic \\u2014 have taken steps to rein in the power of Big Tech, even as they increasingly lean on Big Tech to bolster their national security.\", \"In other words, it\\u2019s complicated. Most Americans \\u2014 including me \\u2014 don\\u2019t have the tech background or the vocabulary to do the subject justice. \\u201cDemocracy\\u201d is a word that people can relate to and rally around.\", \"\\u201cPresident Biden is like every other president before him,\\u201d Ms. Rondeaux told me. \\u201cHe needs an organizing principle for his foreign policy and he\\u2019s picked one.\\u201d\", \"Democracy isn\\u2019t a perfect fit. But for now, it will do.\"]","href_hash":"d680649656ff11ec8ffe6fdd20e11527"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d680649656ff11ec8ffe6fdd20e11527"}},
