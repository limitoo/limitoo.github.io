The virus led to her being hospitalized, but Lue eventually recovered enough to be discharged.\", \"Since then she has experienced a range of symptoms including what is sometimes referred to as \\\"brain fog,\\\" which she finds the hardest to deal with.\", \"She has also experienced changes to her smell and taste. Lue described a bowl of soup as tasting like hot bananas, and a recurring odor that smelled like cat urine.\", \"\\\"I have a cat, so naturally I thought my cat had finally taken her revenge for getting a dog,\\\" she wrote in an article for Fox 2 Detroit. \\\"I scurried out of grocery and department stores, dry heaving at the cat smell odor so strong I could taste it.\\\"\", \"After around a month, Lue realized that she was the only one who could smell it.\", \"Meanwhile, her memory loss impacted her daily life. She said she has had to use navigation to help her drive to work despite commuting there for nearly a decade, and has struggled to remember important names and dates.\", \"She said she is learning to cope with her \\\"new normal\\\" and that \\\"there is still so much to learn\\\" about long COVID and highlighting the need for support in those who have the condition.\", \"Lue is not alone in reporting changes to her senses of smell and taste as a result of long COVID.\", \"Earlier this month, TikTok user Natalia Cano posted a video describing her difficult battle with COVID symptoms that have left her with a condition known as parosmia\\u2014in which one's senses of smell and taste are unpleasantly distorted.\", \"Cano said normal foods now smell and taste like rotting flesh and garbage.
