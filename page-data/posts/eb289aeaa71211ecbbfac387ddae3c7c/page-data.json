The costs have led some residents to master the art of fuel efficiency.\\u00a0\", \"Wayne Gerdis, who is serious about making his gas tank go further, said he's getting \\\"well over 80 miles per gallon\\\" \\u2014 about 60% further than what the Environmental Protection Agency says his plug-in Prius hybrid should be getting.\\u00a0\", \"Gerdis is one of the nation's leading \\\"hypermilers\\\" \\u2014 drivers who take fuel economy to the extreme. Some try to reduce drag, drop weight and even draft behind semi trucks.\\u00a0\", \"Gerdis often coasts downhill and takes a slow and steady approach to driving, like going 55 miles per hour on Interstate 5 outside of San Diego, even if it means he's going a lot slower than virtually everyone else on the road.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"That's OK,\\\" Gerdis told CBS News. \\\"They aren't buying my gas.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Gerdis says he always follows the speed limit.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Speed kills fuel economy, it does,\\\" he said. \\\"There's no way around it.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"His goal is to always stay moving by gently accelerating.
