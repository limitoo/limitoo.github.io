His long-term ambitions for his sport may be just as difficult to achieve.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-02-13T08:48:09.000Z","content":"[\"The Olympic snowboarder Chris Corning is a dutiful conformist in a sport renowned for its proud legacy of nonconformity.\", \"While many snowboarders pump themselves up before a competitive run with loud music, whoops or self-motivating shrieks, Corning prefers quiet.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m a big fan of competing with no emotion,\\u201d said Corning, an American who will compete in the big air event at the Beijing Games starting Monday after placing sixth in slopestyle. \\u201cPeople like to get over excited. I\\u2019m not very good at that.\\u201d\", \"Corning, who narrowly missed winning a medal at the Winter Olympics in 2018, when he finished fourth in the big air competition, spends hours studying film of his tricks with the discipline of a N.F.L. quarterback preparing for the Super Bowl. He eschews the unbridled spirit of creativity in favor of practiced calculation.\", \"\\u201cI definitely never go out there and wing it,\\u201d said Corning, 22. \\u201cThat\\u2019s dangerous.\\u201d\", \"He keeps a busy training schedule for one reason: \\u201cStronger means you fall less often. And I don\\u2019t like falling.\\u201d\", \"Corning is also convinced snowboarding has an image problem and that he knows how to fix it.\", \"\\u201cPeople think the sport is basically pothead snowboarders, and if snowboarding wants to grow and become more of a professional sport it needs to change,\\u201d Corning said late last year as he sat in a coffee shop near his home in Avon, Colo. He added: \\u201cI\\u2019ve known how the sport is perceived since I was 7 years old and watched snowboarding videos where you\\u2019d see guys smoking weed and drinking and fighting. I never cared for that.\\u201d\", \"Corning insists the growth and prosperity of his sport will be tied to revamping its ethos, whether that is real or imagined. Since he was 19, Corning has been the appointed liaison for pro snowboarders to the upper management of U.S. Ski and Snowboard, the sport\\u2019s national governing body.\", \"\\u201cParents don\\u2019t want their kids to go in the terrain park and be around people who are smoking and drinking all the time,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut that\\u2019s what they expect. And go to a normal park, no doubt you\\u2019re going to smell weed. Snowboarding is awesome and I do have fun. But I don\\u2019t get caught up in the lifestyle of snowboarding. We\\u2019d attract more people overall, get more sponsor donations and evolve into something bigger if we focus on the sport and not the lifestyle.\\u201d\", \"While Corning was growing up in the Denver area, his athletic future seemed better suited to football than snowboarding. He was a dominant all-purpose player in youth football.\", \"\\u201cWe used to joke that Chris kicks the ball, Chris throws the ball, Chris catches the ball, he runs the ball,\\u201d said Laura Corning, Chris\\u2019s mother. Chris, whose paternal grandfather played college football, recalled that in some games he\\u2019d score every point for his team. But Chris\\u2019s parents were also recreational snowboarders, and after football season the family would regularly make four trips a week to the mountain resorts west of Denver. Chris began entering local snowboarding competitions.\", \"By the time he was a young teen, his snowboarding events were overlapping with late-season football games, and eventually, Chris chose snowboarding over football. But in the sport\\u2019s developmental pipeline \\u2014 where most of the top athletes belonged to elite teams staffed with professional coaches aligned with major mountain resorts \\u2014 Chris was an unknown.\", \"\\u201cWe had just been flying by the seat of our pants,\\u201d said Brook Corning, Chris\\u2019s father. \\u201cBut Chris takes things seriously. One day, he told us he wanted to make the U.S. snowboarding team.\\u201d\", \"The Cornings \\u2014 Laura is a court reporter and Brook worked in HVAC construction \\u2014 sold their home in the Denver suburbs and moved to Summit County, Colo., which put Chris closer to prominent ski areas like Breckenridge, Copper Mountain and Keystone. When he was 15, Chris moved to Aspen, where he could get more personalized, private coaching, although it meant living with a host family 130 miles from home.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t have a car so I had to take the bus everywhere,\\u201d Corning said. \\u201cI was doing school online, going to the grocery store, I learned to cook and trained an awful lot.\\u201d\", \"Throughout snow sports, it is common for promising teens to be whisked to mountain environments or resort-based academies in pursuit of Olympic glory. But being separated for most of the year from the typical familial setting and supervision at such a young age frequently leads to off-the-snow behavioral issues that can derail careers, and sometimes lives.\", \"Corning, who graduated from high school two years early, shook his head when asked if he experienced anything along those lines.\", \"\\u201cI mean, it wasn\\u2019t easy and I missed being home but I didn\\u2019t hang out much \\u2014 I don\\u2019t party all the time,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo I never really had any opportunity to do anything to get in trouble. Plus, I remember my dad telling me that before I chose to do anything when I was on my own, I should ask myself, \\u2018Is this going to be good for my snowboarding?\\u2019 So I went home a lot and got ready for the next day.\\u201d\", \"Nonetheless, Corning remained lightly regarded as a prospect. \\u201cTotally flying under the radar for a long time,\\u201d he said.\", \"But, slowly moving up the rankings, he qualified to travel to a World Cup competition in New Zealand. He was 15 and was surprised when he won the event. \\u201cThat was the first time I thought, \\u2018I might just make it; it\\u2019s not just a kid\\u2019s dream,\\u2019\\u201d he said.\", \"Two years later, Corning won two medals at the 2017 freestyle ski and snowboard world championships and was elevated to the U.S. snowboarding team just before the 2018 Winter Games.\", \"Competing as an 18-year-old in Pyeongchang, South Korea, he was both pleased and disappointed by his fourth-place finish.\", \"\\u201cThe Olympics were a cool experience but I definitely wanted to do better,\\u201d Corning said. \\u201cIt stays with you and you wonder what to do differently next time.\\u201d\", \"Slopestyle and big air are both scored by judges, a situation that can vex competitors trying to guess which tricks will be valued most favorably. There is also the heavy cost of a single mistake.\", \"\\u201cIt isn\\u2019t basketball,\\u201d Corning said with a smile, \\u201cwhere if you miss an early free throw you have two hours to make up for it. We have to be pretty much perfect to win any medal.\\u201d\", \"And then there is the ever-present fear felt by big air competitors as they stand atop a 50-meter ramp preparing to be flung skyward for multiple flips and twists. Corning, who is 5-foot-8 and 165 pounds, was the first snowboarder to land a quad cork (four inversions and five rotations) at a World Cup event and the first to do it on a scaffold big air jump in 2019. Those successes, however, do not necessarily guarantee a sense of comfort in the seconds before he launches down a steep ramp for a jump.\", \"\\u201cThe fear is insanely hot and anybody who says they don\\u2019t feel it is lying,\\u201d Corning said. \\u201cA quadruple is terrifying. When it comes time to do one, you\\u2019ve got to be in the right head space to try it. You have to stay strong mentally; you\\u2019re doing something that could kill you.\\u201d\", \"Perhaps not surprisingly, Corning expects to resume his pursuit of a sports psychology degree after the Beijing Olympics. He also plans to enroll in a Colorado firefighters\\u2019 academy.\", \"But Corning does not expect his commitment to snowboarding to wane. Nor does he shy away from his role as an advocate for the sport\\u2019s brighter future.\", \"\\u201cI want to give back and see snowboarding in the limelight it deserves,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been riding a long time and I think the sport is ready for that next step. It doesn\\u2019t have to stay where it is. We can change that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8333b0a78cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8333b0a78cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}},
