For many days the prosecution was on the ropes \\u2014 some of the state\\u2019s witnesses seemed to bolster the defense\\u2019s case that Rittenhouse acted in self-defense, while the crotchety judge frequently sided with the defense and blew up at prosecutors. After Rittenhouse began sobbing on the stand last week, it looked as if he\\u2019d be certain to walk.\", \"But on Monday, the lead prosecutor, Thomas Binger, offered a meticulously documented closing argument that deftly summarized all the ways Rittenhouse acted unlawfully. We\\u2019ll see if the jury buys it, but to me Binger\\u2019s argument had a power beyond this case.\", \"That\\u2019s because it cleverly unraveled some of the foundational tenets of gun advocacy: That guns are effective and necessary weapons of self-defense. That without them, lawlessness and tyranny would prevail. And that in the right hands \\u2014 in the hands of the \\u201cgood guys\\u201d \\u2014 guns promote public safety rather than destroy it.\", \"In the Rittenhouse case, none of that was true. At every turn that night, Rittenhouse\\u2019s AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle made things worse, ratcheting up danger rather than quelling it. The gun transformed situations that might have ended in black eyes and broken bones into ones that ended with corpses in the street. And Rittenhouse\\u2019s gun was not just a danger to rival protesters. According to his own defense, the gun posed a grave threat to Rittenhouse himself \\u2014 he said he feared being overpowered and then shot with his own weapon.\", \"This is self-defense as circular reasoning: Rittenhouse says he carried a rifle in order to guarantee his safety during a violent protest. He was forced to shoot at four people when his life and the lives of other people were threatened, he says. What was he protecting everyone from? The gun strapped to his own body, the one he\\u2019d brought to keep everyone safe.\", \"The shootings took place more than a year ago, in the pre-election, post-George Floyd, Covid-soaked summer of 2020. Near the end of August, a Kenosha police officer shot a Black man named Jacob Blake, leaving him partly paralyzed. The small city erupted in large protests that quickly turned violent and riotous.\", \"The scene on the night of Aug. 25, 2020, had the makings of a classic gun-rights fantasy. An unruly mob had descended on private businesses. One such business was Car Source, an auto dealership with three locations in Kenosha. Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time and a resident of Illinois (his father lived in Kenosha), said he had come with a friend to protect Car Source on the invitation of the owner. He said he\\u2019d chosen a military-style rifle over a pistol because he believed he could not legally possess a pistol and, he conceded, in part because the rifle \\u201clooked cool.\\u201d\", \"By the time Rittenhouse arrived, more than a hundred vehicles on a sales lot owned by Car Source had been set on fire. There were burning trash cans on the streets. Gunfire rang out often. Officers in riot gear and armed with tear gas were in control of much of the city, but there were sections where the police pulled back. It was here that the people with rifles took a stand against what they saw as a mob.\", \"But as many witnesses testified, the rifles weren\\u2019t very helpful at all. Rittenhouse and others in his group said they didn\\u2019t intend to kill people that night; the main reason they brought the big guns, they said, was to deter attacks. That backfired. The guns seemed to invite conflict. Drew Hernandez, a right-wing internet personality who was covering the demonstrations, testified that when \\u201crioters\\u201d spotted the men with guns, \\u201cthey immediately attempted to agitate them, to try and start some conflict with them.\\u201d\", \"Later that night, Rittenhouse left the car dealership and his armed peers and found himself in a crowd of strangers he suspected might be hostile to him. The prosecution says the killing began when Rittenhouse pointed his gun at Joseph Rosenbaum, an unarmed, 36-year-old protester, prompting Rosenbaum to run after him in an effort to stop a potential shooting. Rittenhouse denies provoking the attack; he says that Rosenbaum and another man, Joshua Ziminski, who was armed with a handgun, \\u201cambushed\\u201d him, and chased him when he tried to run away.\", \"Rittenhouse pointed his gun at Rosenbaum, but the man kept coming. In order to claim self-defense as a justification for shooting Rosenbaum, Rittenhouse had to have believed that Rosenbaum posed an imminent threat of death or great bodily harm to him. Binger asked Rittenhouse how he could have believed that \\u2014 Rosenbaum \\u201cdidn\\u2019t have any weapon of any kind, correct?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOther than him grabbing my gun, no,\\u201d he answered.\", \"It\\u2019s a telling response \\u2014 Rittenhouse\\u2019s main worry was his own firearm. As Rosenbaum closed in, Rittenhouse said it became clear to him that Rosenbaum wanted to take the rifle \\u2014 and if he got it, Rittenhouse said, he would have \\u201ckilled me with it and probably killed more people.\\u201d Rittenhouse fired four shots in quick succession, killing Rosenbaum, just as he said it seemed that Rosenbaum lunged for the weapon.\", \"Chaos ensued. Rittenhouse ran, and people who had just seen him shoot Rosenbaum begin to go after him. At some point Rittenhouse stumbled, and while he lay on the road, an unidentified man jumped and kicked him in the head. Rittenhouse shot at \\u201cjump kick man\\u201d \\u2014 as he was often called during the trial \\u2014 but missed. A 26-year-old named Anthony Huber attempted to smash his skateboard on Rittenhouse\\u2019s head. Rittenhouse shot Huber in the chest. He died.\", \"Finally, Rittenhouse was met by Gaige Grosskreutz, an E.M.T. who testified he firmly believed in the right to bear arms and prepared for that night like any other: \\u201cIt\\u2019s keys, phone, wallet, gun.\\u201d\", \"Grosskreutz said he had rushed to the scene to provide medical help; as he ran, he\\u2019d drawn his own gun, thinking that Rittenhouse was an \\u201cactive shooter.\\u201d Rittenhouse and Grosskreutz squared up, face to face, each lethally armed. But Grosskreutz hesitated. After pointing his gun at Rittenhouse, he testified, he decided that he could not take another human\\u2019s life. Rittenhouse had no such qualms. He fired, hitting Grosskreutz in his right biceps.\", \"After all this mayhem, all this death, what use were the guns that night?\", \"The guns failed to deter attacks against their owners. According to the defense, Rittenhouse\\u2019s gun was a reason Rosenbaum pursued him. And Grosskreutz\\u2019s gun was the reason Rittenhouse shot him.\", \"The guns failed any notion of proportionality or moderation. Prosecutors pointed out that Rittenhouse quickly fired four shots at Rosenbaum. Even if Rittenhouse felt genuinely threatened by Rosenbaum, why hadn\\u2019t Rittenhouse stopped shooting after the first shot, which could have immobilized Rosenbaum without killing him? (A defense \\u201cuse of force\\u201d expert implied that the gun shot too quickly for him to pause and reassess the threat between shots.)\", \"If you believe Rittenhouse\\u2019s defense, the gun also failed at a more basic level, that of ordinary product safety. Rittenhouse had his rifle strapped to his body but was still worried that it could be taken from him. How useful is a gun that can be pulled away from you by a guy who is also hitting you with a skateboard?\", \"And finally the guns failed at their most vaunted purpose, helping the good guys fight the bad guys. If Rittenhouse was your good guy, what good did his gun do him? How did it help anyone in the community he was trying to protect? It got two people killed, one person injured, and Rittenhouse himself facing charges of homicide.\", \"On the other hand, it looked cool.\", \"Farhad wants to chat with readers on the phone.
