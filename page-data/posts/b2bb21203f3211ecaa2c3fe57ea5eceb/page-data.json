Infrastructure week!” the president declared with a broad smile.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-06T10:53:40.000Z","content":"[\"President Biden celebrated the passage of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill on Saturday, declaring \\u2014 just days after an electoral drubbing for his party \\u2014 that he had made good on two key promises of his campaign: reviving the economy and getting the nation vaccinated.\", \"\\u201cFinally! Infrastructure week!\\u201d Mr. Biden declared with a broad smile from the State Dining Room, making a subtle dig at his predecessor, Donald J. Trump, whose White House perpetually promised big investments in the nation\\u2019s public works, but never amassed the focus or votes.\", \"Shortly before midnight on Friday, the House gave final approval to the package, the largest single investment of federal resources into infrastructure projects in more than a decade, on a 228-to-206 vote.\", \"But for Mr. Biden on Saturday, there was a clear sense of regret that his victory did not come a few days earlier, when it might have made a difference in the off-year elections on Tuesday in which his party fared poorly, an outcome that he acknowledged reflected public frustration with a democratic process that seemed in perpetual gridlock.\", \"\\u201cThe American people have made clear one overwhelming thing, I think,\\u201d he said, with Vice President Kamala Harris at his side. \\u201cAll the talk about the elections and what do they mean. They want us to deliver.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden cast the victory \\u2014 which he achieved with the support of 13 House Republicans, who proved crucial because of key defections from his own party \\u2014 as critical to putting Americans to work on long-neglected projects. But he also described it as central to his strategy for competing with China, from the money for charging stations for electric vehicles \\u2014 an investment Beijing made years ago \\u2014 to bringing broadband internet service to remote and underserved communities.\", \"\\u201cWe did something that is long overdue, that long has been talked about in Washington but never actually been done,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cWhen we came to office, we were told virtually by everybody, \\u2018You can\\u2019t get this economy moving,\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cRemember when they told me there is no way that I could get, you know, 2 million shots a day into people\\u2019s arms in the beginning? There\\u2019s no way to get to 200 million. No way to get the vaccine. No way, no way, no way.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not criticizing people who said that,\\u201d he added. \", \"Over the summer, the president had hoped this pivotal moment would be accompanied by the simultaneous passing of the even larger social safety net and climate change bill that is the top priority of his party\\u2019s progressive wing.\", \"In his final efforts to assemble votes for the infrastructure bill, he had asked skeptical members of his party on Friday to trust that he had cut quiet deals that would assure passage of some form of the social policy bill the week of Nov. 15. That is when Congress is scheduled to be back from a weeklong recess.\", \"Asked on Saturday whether he had gotten assurances from moderates in the party that they would also vote for the sprawling social policy bill \\u2014 with its funding for universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, paid family leave, child-care tax credits and extensive climate change programs \\u2014 Mr. Biden refused to give details.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not going to get into who made what commitments to me \\u2014 I don\\u2019t negotiate in public. But I feel confident.\\u201d\", \"To win over votes later this month, Mr. Biden added some elements intended to appeal to Democrats in parts of the East Coast and California \\u2014 including wealthier taxpayers. Changes enacted during the Trump administration made it impossible for taxpayers in those states to deduct from their federal taxable income more than $10,000 paid in state and local taxes. The new deduction, at least as the legislation stands now, would raise that limit to $80,000.\", \"Before the House will take that up, however, moderates are demanding an independent assessment of the bill\\u2019s true cost. That will take until at least the middle of the month \\u2014 and may well decide its fate, or whether it would be even further scaled back.\", \"Once the Build Back Better act is passed \\u2014 or not \\u2014 there is a third element of Mr. Biden\\u2019s economic revival effort that he has spoken about rarely in recent months \\u2014 but is perhaps the most radical in its vision of how the government invests in future technology. It is the so-called China bill, essentially a package of industrial-policy investments, including more than $50 billion in the semiconductor industry, research in quantum computing and artificial intelligence, and a series of other technologies that essentially mirror Beijing\\u2019s \\u201cMade in China 2025\\u201d initiative.\", \"But when asked about the bill on Saturday during a speech that had turned into a lengthy news conference, Mr. Biden declined to say when it would come up in the House. It has already passed the Senate by a strong bipartisan majority, a testament to how competing with China\\u2019s military and technological investments is one of the few issues that brings Republicans and Democrats together. But the bill\\u2019s focus on technology does not give it the same political appeal, for Mr. Biden or members of the House, that rebuilding bridges and roads holds.\", \"Mr. Biden also passionately defended his administration\\u2019s consideration of payments to migrants who were separated from their children at the border \\u2014 and in some cases were never reunited \\u2014 under President Trump\\u2019s \\u201czero tolerance\\u201d policy.\", \"On Wednesday he had said that he would not approve payments of upward of $450,000 to the families of those separated, a figure reported to have been debated inside the Justice Department, which has to handle cases coming out of the Trump-era policy. But on Saturday, he said that his objection had been to the amount of the payments, not to the concept of compensating parents.\", \"\\u201cIf in fact, because of the outrageous behavior of the last administration, you coming across the border, whether it was legal or illegal, and you lost your child,\\u201d Mr. Biden began and then stopped himself.\", \"\\u201cYou lost your child,\\u201d he repeated, raising his voice. \\u201cIt\\u2019s gone. You deserve some kind of compensation no matter what the circumstance. What that will be I have no idea. I have no idea.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b2bb21203f3211ecaa2c3fe57ea5eceb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b2bb21203f3211ecaa2c3fe57ea5eceb"}},
