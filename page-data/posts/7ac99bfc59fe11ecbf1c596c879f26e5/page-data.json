We have a number of vulnerable populations in our community that we really need to be particularly mindful of: those with comorbidities, the aging population, First Nations people. Even with vaccinations, they're more prone to getting more serious illness.\\\"\", \"Dr Herrero said a significant number\\u00a0of young people appeared to be complacent about getting the jab. She\\u00a0said\\u00a0they needed to understand they were gambling with their lives.\", \"\\\"The incidence of more serious complications and death from COVID in young people are less than in the elderly\\u00a0but, of course, rates being less doesn't make it zero,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"There are still young individuals who get severely sick from COVID and who have long COVID impacts months down the track, as well as those who do, unfortunately, die. We've seen cases of this.\", \"\\\"Who wants to take that gamble? I know I wouldn't want to take that gamble and I wouldn't want any young person that I care about to take that gamble.\\\"\", \"Health Minister Yvette D'Ath stopped short of reintroducing a mask mandate\\u00a0for the Gold Coast yesterday, but she strongly recommended people started carrying masks with them at all times and wore them indoors.\", \"\\\"This is important. We can assume that there is likely to be transmission happening across the Gold Coast,\\\" she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/fcf445c3d4cdd423864d2e432ba94159\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Queensland's new Chief Health Officer John Gerrard says the virus must enter the state(ABC News)</div>\", \"Queensland's incoming chief health officer John Gerrard predicts\\u00a0there will be more COVID-19 outbreaks as the state enters the next phase of its pandemic response \\u2014\\u00a0reintegrating with the rest of the world in a \\\"cautious and steady\\\" manner.\", \"\\\"We can't continue to isolate,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We do have to reintegrate with the world. But as that happens, the virus will enter Queensland, we know that. It is inevitable. Eventually, we'll see some surge of infections in Queensland.\\\"\", \"Dr Herrero pleaded with people who had not yet received a COVID-19 vaccination to get the jab, not only to protect themselves and their families, but to help keep the state's hospital system from becoming overloaded.\", \"\\\"The concern is that when we open our borders \\u2026 we'll get such a large influx of COVID patients in the hospitals,\\\" Dr Herrero said.\", \"\\\"If they're unvaccinated, these could be patients that could have prevented getting a more severe form of COVID.\", \"\\\"Time and energy are going to be spent saving the lives of COVID-infected individuals that could push out other people who have other illnesses, traumas, other need for hospitalisation and care, including elective surgeries. We just don't want to see that happen to our system.\", \"\\\"One day you could be the person in a car accident and be in desperate need of your hospital system and you want it to be at full working capacity.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/72f313d9f7f5c33fbe32f5bf4d22d280\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Why we hear about some COVID-19 variants more than others</div>\"]","href_hash":"7ac99bfc59fe11ecbf1c596c879f26e5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7ac99bfc59fe11ecbf1c596c879f26e5"}},
