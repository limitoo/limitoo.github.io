That was up from 4.3 million in August and was the most in the two decades the government has been keeping track. Nearly a million workers quit their jobs in leisure and hospitality businesses alone, reflecting the steep competition for workers there as the industry rebuilds from last year\\u2019s pandemic-induced shutdowns.\", \"There were 10.4 million job openings in the United States at the end of September, down slightly from August but still extraordinarily high by historical standards.\", \"Actual hiring has been slower to rebound, however, and was essentially flat in September, as businesses struggled to attract candidates. There were roughly 75 unemployed workers for every 100 job openings in September, the lowest ratio on record. Separate data released last week by the Labor Department showed that job growth rebounded in October but that the labor force barely grew, suggesting that employers\\u2019 hiring challenges are continuing.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re essentially seeing demand continuing to increase without an offsetting increase in talent,\\u201d Ryan Sutton, a district director for Robert Half International, a staffing firm. \\u201cUntil some new talent comes in, until we get employees who are on the sidelines back into the market, it\\u2019s very likely this is going to continue.\\u201d\", \"Economists say a number of factors explain workers\\u2019 slow return. The pandemic is continuing to disrupt child care, making it hard for some parents to work; other workers are worried about contracting the virus or spreading it to high-risk family members. Many Americans have also built up their savings during the pandemic, allowing them to be choosier about jobs.\", \"The labor crunch is giving workers the upper hand in negotiations. Wages have risen sharply in recent months, particularly in service jobs, although in other industries pay is lagging the pace of inflation.\", \"The recent rise in the number of workers quitting suggests that many are taking advantage of their leverage to take better-paying jobs, or to look for them. At the same time, understaffing in many businesses may be putting stress on remaining workers, leading even more people to leave their jobs.\", \"\\u201cWe are seeing big pickups in quits in the industries that are having the hardest time hiring right now,\\u201d said Nick Bunker, director of economic research for the job site Indeed.\", \"Kaylie Sweeting worked as a bartender in Short Hills, N.J., through most of the pandemic, despite concerns about interacting with unmasked customers and frustration about low wages. But when the restaurant pressured a colleague to come to work sick this summer, Ms. Sweeting quit.\", \"\\u201cThe job was absolutely no longer worth it,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI was hurt that a company that I gave my time to did not seem to prioritize me or my safety.\\u201d\", \"So Ms. Sweeting, 23, and her partner, a cook, decided to take the money they had saved to buy a house and open their own restaurant instead. They recently signed a lease and are beginning renovations, with plans to open a vegan restaurant early next year. They are trying to apply the lessons they have learned as employees, promising good wages, paid time off and other basic benefits that restaurant jobs have often failed to provide.\", \"\\u201cI genuinely love the industry,\\u201d Ms. Sweeting said. \\u201cI just don\\u2019t love the way it\\u2019s managed. I feel like the only way to change it is to implement the change yourself.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ac05690a43d611ecb938b37873fd234c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ac05690a43d611ecb938b37873fd234c"}},
