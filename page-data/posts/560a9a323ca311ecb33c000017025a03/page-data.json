And particularly me.\\u201d\", \"But as the nation reassesses its history, discussions of symbols and names are now a familiar part of political discourse. One of the latest historical figures to come under scrutiny is Serranus Hastings, the law school\\u2019s founder, who masterminded a Gold Rush-era slaughter of Yuki men, women and children in and around his Mendocino County horse and cattle ranch 160 years ago. The massacres were part of a pattern of killings paid for by the California Legislature in the early decades of statehood.\", \"Last week, The New York Times published a front-page article on the Hastings legacy with the headline, \\u201cHe Unleashed a California Massacre. Should This School Be Named for Him?\\u201d On Tuesday, Brown was applauding the unanimous decision by the board of directors of his alma mater, the University of California, Hastings College of the Law, to change its own name.\", \"Joseph Cotchett, a high-powered lawyer and one of the biggest donors to Hastings, said the article helped galvanize alumni around the idea that the name must be changed.\", \"\\u201cRight here in progressive San Francisco, there\\u2019s a school called Hastings,\\u201d Cotchett told me on Tuesday. \\u201cAre you kidding me? It\\u2019s scandalous.\\u201d\", \"The dean and chancellor of the school, David Faigman, had previously argued forcefully for retaining the name, but told me he now saw the name change as a \\u201cnecessary step.\\u201d\", \"Faigman initiated an inquiry in 2017 into the actions of the school\\u2019s founder, and with it a wider debate over how to address the sins of the past. Before Tuesday\\u2019s decision he had argued that the college should keep its name while pushing for restorative justice, including maintaining a program focused on Indigenous law and pro bono legal assistance for tribes in Round Valley, the area where the Hastings massacres took place.\", \"His original position, Faigman told me, was partly shaped by comments from Yuki tribespeople that they had felt erased by history and that removing the Hastings name would further seal that historical erasure.\", \"But even after Tuesday\\u2019s decision a number of questions remain unanswered, including what the new name will be, and whether the state will be forced to repay Hastings descendants the $100,000 donated by Serranus Hastings, a sum that would today reach into the millions of dollars. The school\\u2019s enactment said the school was \\u201cto be forever known and designated as \\u2018Hastings\\u2019 College of the Law.\\u201d\", \"The name change must be done through an act of the Legislature. One suggestion, the University of California, San Francisco College of the Law, would cause \\u201cbrand confusion\\u201d with the University of California, San Francisco, Faigman said.\", \"Col. Claes Lewenhaupt, a great-great-grandson of Hastings who sits on the law school\\u2019s board of directors, said by text message Tuesday night that changing the school\\u2019s name was \\u201cthe right thing to do,\\u201d although he said he was \\u201csaddened\\u201d to see the Hastings name go because of the school\\u2019s more recent association with helping the underserved.\", \"Deb Hutt, a Yuki tribeswoman who lives in Round Valley, was also ambivalent. She said a group of alumni and other concerned San Franciscans reached out to her after the article was published. \\u201cA weight was lifted,\\u201d she said.\", \"But she told me she wasn\\u2019t satisfied with simply a vote to change the name.\", \"\\u201cThey are trying to correct their wrongs,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a shallow victory.\\u201d\", \"In one of the first cases to be brought against drug manufacturers over the opioid crisis, a California judge ruled that there was \\u201csimply no evidence\\u201d the companies were liable.\", \"See $4.5 million homes in California.\", \"The dreamiest roasted potatoes.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from Bruce Higgins, a reader who lives in San Diego:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
