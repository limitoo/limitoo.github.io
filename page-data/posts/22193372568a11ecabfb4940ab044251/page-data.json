The police did not pursue a lead involving an actual confession to the murder. A dishonest detective \\u2014 Mark Handy, later discovered to have fabricated evidence \\u2014 testified against Clark and Hardin. And the prosecutor misled the jury about a fingerprint and a hair sample at the crime scene.\", \"The jury convicted the two men, then both in their early 20s, and they were sentenced to life in prison. They would spend more than 20 years there before lawyers for the Innocence Project helped win their release, based on DNA evidence and the exposure of the detective\\u2019s dishonesty.\", \"At that point, you might have expected the criminal justice system to apologize to the two men and leave them alone. Instead, prosecutors announced plans to try them again for the murder \\u2014 and even added a perjury charge against Clark. Why? Partly because, in an attempt to win parole while in prison, Clark had decided to admit to the murder and express remorse.\", \"Parole hearings create a terrible Catch-22 for wrongfully convicted people. If they admit guilt, they can undermine any attempt to overturn their conviction. If they continue to assert their innocence, they can doom their best chance at freedom \\u2014 parole \\u2014 because parole applications effectively require statements of remorse.\", \"Joseph Gordon, a 78-year-old man in New York State, falls into the second category. He has already served more than his minimum sentence of 25 years for a 1991 murder, and multiple prison officials and guards have supported his parole application. Gordon has \\u201cthe character and moral compass to return to society as a productive member of his community,\\u201d wrote a former superintendent at Fishkill Correctional Facility, where Gordon is incarcerated.\", \"But the parole board has refused to release him. The chief reason, according to the board, is Gordon\\u2019s continuing insistence of his innocence.\", \"You can read Gordon\\u2019s full story in this recent Times article by Tom Robbins. The details of the case are messy and tragic. Gordon clearly committed a crime: He covered up the killing of a 38-year-old doctor who may have been having a sexual relationship with Gordon\\u2019s 16-year-old son. Gordon says that his son killed the doctor and the cover-up was an attempt to protect his son.\", \"\\u201cI was not going to put my son in prison,\\u201d Gordon said.\", \"After reading about the case, I don\\u2019t feel confident about what happened. But there are good reasons to doubt that Gordon committed the murder, and his lawyers argue that guilt is no longer the central question anyway. They told me that they are confident he would have been released by now if he had simply abandoned his innocence claim, based on his age, his prison record and the pattern of other parole decisions.\", \"I want to tell you about Gordon\\u2019s case this morning because of the broader problems that it highlights. The U.S. has the world\\u2019s largest incarcerated population, with more than two million people in prison or jail. Most other countries take a radically different approach to criminal justice:\", \"The starkest injustice is the large number of people imprisoned for crimes they did not commit. This morning, tens of thousands of Americans woke up behind bars because of wrongful convictions.\", \"Consider that one academic analysis of death row inmates found 4.1 percent of them deserved to be exonerated \\u2014 an estimate it called \\u201cconservative.\\u201d Another study, focusing on sexual assault cases, estimated a wrongful conviction rate of 11.6 percent.\", \"Whatever the true number, it\\u2019s large enough for alarm. Our criminal justice system regularly puts a higher priority on winning a conviction than on achieving justice. And Black and Latino Americans are disproportionately imprisoned as a result, studies show.\", \"The biggest policy question is how to minimize wrongful convictions. In recent years, a reform movement \\u2014 including political conservatives, moderates and progressives \\u2014 has been trying to do so. Among their ideas: ban testimony from jailhouse informants; require the recording of interrogations; expand post-conviction DNA testing; and increase penalties for prosecutors and police who lie or manipulate evidence.\", \"Yet changing the rules around parole can also make a difference, especially given how many unjustly incarcerated people will not be helped by changes that apply to future cases. \\u201cPeople who maintain their innocence remain in an impossible situation,\\u201d said Michelle Lewin, executive director of the Parole Preparation Project.\", \"Currently, some prisoners decide that their best option is to admit guilt falsely. Huwe Burton offers an excruciating example: At a parole hearing, he dropped his claims of innocence and admitted to stabbing his mother, Keziah, to death in their Bronx apartment in 1989, when he was 16 years old.\", \"He had been convicted after police officers coerced a confession from him. They decided to focus on him instead of an obvious suspect \\u2014 a neighbor who had a violent criminal record and who was discovered driving Keziah\\u2019s car six days after the killing. In 2019, a Bronx judge vacated Burton\\u2019s conviction.\", \"One way to prevent parole dilemmas like Burton\\u2019s is for parole boards to make decisions based more on a person\\u2019s rehabilitation and risk to the community and less on their stated guilt or innocence. Julia Salazar, a Democrat from Brooklyn in the New York State Senate, has proposed a bill that would do so.\", \"The bill has significant support in the legislature, but it remains unclear whether it will become law. Gov. Kathy Hochul has not announced her position on it.\", \"Related: \", \"Gail Collins and Bret Stephens discuss the Michigan school shooting.\", \"President Biden can do better on Covid, Ross Douthat writes.\", \"Trump\\u2019s reckless Covid behavior needs more attention, Jamelle Bouie writes.\", \"The containment strategy worked against the Soviet Union.

But Georgia lost to one of its rivals \\u2014 Alabama \\u2014 on Saturday; Georgia hasn\\u2019t beaten Alabama since 2007. The result let Alabama jump over Georgia for the No. 1 seed, although Georgia\\u2019s season was still strong enough to get it into the playoff.\", \"In one of the New Year\\u2019s Eve semifinals, Georgia will play Michigan \\u2014 a college football power in the 20th century, but not so much in the 21st. Head coach Jim Harbaugh, who played for the team in the 1980s, finally beat Ohio State over Thanksgiving weekend and then beat Iowa on Saturday.\", \"The final team is not like the others: Cincinnati, the first school from a lower-level conference to make the playoff. Cincinnati did so thanks to a perfect 13-0 record, including a win over Notre Dame, and will play Alabama, which has won six of the past 12 titles. \\u2014 Tom Wright-Piersanti, a Morning editor\", \"Another hit dinner by Melissa Clark: brown-butter orzo with butternut squash.\", \"The boundary-pushing musician Arca\\u2019s latest project, \\u201cKICK,\\u201d is a five-album masterwork accompanied by a 3-D visual world.\", \"Robert Gottlieb\\u2019s scrupulous study of Greta Garbo would make a great gift for film buffs.
