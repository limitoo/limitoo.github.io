He\\u2019s actually 95. A baby! (Another one of his indelible characters, from \\u201cFree to Be...You and Me.\\u201d)\", \"Your favorite Brooks work might be \\u201cThe Producers,\\u201d which \\u2014 in a feat of dizzying creative refraction and exponential profit \\u2014 he made first as a movie about a musical in 1967, then as a musical based on that movie in 2001, and then as another movie based on the musical in 2005. Or you may prefer \\u201cBlazing Saddles,\\u201d a Western spoof; or \\u201cYoung Frankenstein,\\u201d a horror spoof; or the self-explanatory \\u201cSilent Movie,\\u201d in which the only character to speak was Marcel Marceau, the famous mime. Personally I most adore \\u201cHigh Anxiety,\\u201d an Alfred Hitchcock spoof; and reading Brooks\\u2019s new memoir, the product of an extrovert who must have found lockdown torturous, only amplified that affection.\", \"When invited to a lunch of roast beef with Yorkshire pudding by Hitchcock, one of his idols, to discuss the film project, Brooks replied, \\u201cYes, sir, I\\u2019ll be there with bells on.\\u201d Then he showed up with some jangling around his ankles \\u2014 the kind of broad comic gesture that by then, in midcareer, was his calling card in both art and life. Given the Master of Suspense\\u2019s blessing, Brooks went on to re-enact the shower scene from \\u201cPsycho,\\u201d with newsprint pouring rather presciently down the drain in lieu of blood; and broke character as a nervous psychiatrist to sing his movie\\u2019s title song in the manner of Frank Sinatra. But it was his exaggerated enactment of that shrink\\u2019s fear of heights, \\u00e0 la Scottie Ferguson in \\u201cVertigo,\\u201d that feels most resonant and telling.\", \"Brooks himself reads as the opposite of acrophobic: scaling the icy pinnacles of Hollywood without anything more than a pang of self-doubt, using humor as his alpenstock. Fear of heights is closely related to fear of falling; falling (not failing) was a measure of achievement for Brooks and his cohort. Before it was an acronym, they embodied ROFL, forever collapsing to the ground in mirth.\", \"The youngest of Kate Kaminsky\\u2019s four sons, Melvin grew up poor in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn. He was coddled and adored, especially after his father died of tuberculosis. \\u201cI was always in the air, hurled up and kissed and thrown in the air again,\\u201d he writes. \\u201cUntil I was 5, I don\\u2019t remember my feet touching the ground.\\u201d Despite the \\u201cbrush stroke of depression\\u201d that resulted from losing a parent, he appears to glide right over life\\u2019s inevitable vicissitudes. When something goes wrong, he wonders \\u201cwhat to do, what to do?\\u201d \\u2014 and then solves the problem. If it goes really wrong? \\u201cI\\u2019ll spare you the details.\\u201d\", \"Brooks started as a drummer, and percussiveness, driving toward the \\u201crim shot,\\u201d would become another comedic signature. Enlisted in the Army during World War II, he grabbed a cuff of Bob Hope\\u2019s trousers to get an autograph and parodied Cole Porter in a Special Services show at Fort Dix. (\\u201cWhen we begin to clean the latrine\\u2026.\\u201d) After discharge he started writing for Sid Caesar\\u2019s variety shows, where the brotherly atmosphere of his youth was reenacted with staff that included Neil \\u201cDoc\\u201d Simon and Woody Allen. The troubled, intense Caesar once dangled Brooks outside a hotel window in Chicago. \\u201cI was very calm,\\u201d Brooks writes.\", \"In his epic \\u201cHistory of the World, Part I\\u201d (Hulu just ordered Part II), he plays Torquemada, a fearsome leader of the Spanish Inquisition, darting down a spiral stone staircase \\u2014 like \\u201cVertigo\\u201d in reverse \\u2014 and bursting into a song-and-dance number with full chorus. Later in the sketch, nuns strip to bathing suits, synchronize-swim with the devout Jews they\\u2019re trying to convert and then rise up \\u2014 Happy Hanukkah! \\u2014 balancing on the prongs of a giant menorah, sparklers on their heads. If Porter, another idol, wrote \\u201cyou\\u2019re the top / you\\u2019re the Colosseum,\\u201d Brooks went over the top and smashed the pillars.\", \"Hitler is the villain the author most daringly appropriated, from the work-within-a-work of \\u201cThe Producers\\u201d to the disguise in \\u201cTo Be or Not to Be,\\u201d a remake of the Ernst Lubitsch film, in which Brooks starred with his second wife, Anne Bancroft. This still offends some people. \\u201cBlazing Saddles\\u201d does, too. Brooks, who gave the now-controversial comedian Dave Chappelle an early break, casting him in \\u201cRobin Hood: Men in Tights,\\u201d does not concern himself in these pages with changing norms in the industry that has rewarded him so handsomely. Perhaps named for \\u201cAll About Eve\\u201d but less of a bumpy night than a joy ride, \\u201cAll About Me!\\u201d takes humor as an absolute value, something that \\u201cbrings religious persecutors, dictators and tyrants to their knees faster than any other weapon,\\u201d something that can win over a classy lady like Bancroft. Its 460 pages rattle along like an extended one-liner.\", \"Humor can also, of course, be a defensive scrim for difficult emotions. Brooks doesn\\u2019t name his first wife, Florence Baum, though their marriage lasted nine years and produced three children; he and Bancroft, who died in 2005, had a fourth. He would prefer to kvell over the talents of his frequent collaborators Madeline Kahn, Gene Wilder and Carl Reiner, than linger on, or even mention, their departures from this crazy world. As the old song goes, he accentuates the positive. \\u201cLaughter is a protest scream against death, against the long goodbye,\\u201d he writes. And there\\u2019s probably already a prank planned for his own inevitable ascent to heaven.\"]","href_hash":"7a1d569b529111ec81de372dbf136874"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7a1d569b529111ec81de372dbf136874"}},
