He is heard warning the man of the elk.\", \"The video panned over to show people watching some of the elk that were in Estes Park. One elk with a large set of antlers was close and began walking out toward a path as Kreepa's song \\\"Oh No\\\" played in the background.\", \"\\\"Oh watch out sir. Sir, watch out,\\\" Burley said.\", \"It is unclear if the man who walked through the area ignored the warning or if he couldn't hear Burley. As he passed the large animal, the elk bowed his head and began charging the man.\", \"Burley explained that elk are seen throughout Estes Park at this point of the year.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927519/elk-grazing-estes-park.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A photo of an elk grazing in Estes Park in Colorado. An elk was captured on camera charging a man who was walking through the area.</div>\", \"\\\"That is their home and we are just visitors,\\\" he said, noting that another gentleman tried to get closer to the same bull elk that charged the man to get a picture, but he was chased away.\", \"Burley said two male elk were challenging each other and about 30 female elk were nearby.\", \"According to Colorado Encyclopedia, the beginning of the rut season begins in late September. At this point of the year, male elk begin competing with other males for a female elk. They fight with their antlers and make a loud wail-like bugling sound.\", \"\\\"Contrary to popular belief, bugling is neither a challenge nor a threat,\\\" Colorado Encyclopedia writes. \\\"It is partly a release of tension built up during the bull's seasonal changes; the shoulders and neck swell with the rut, and antlers sharpen.\\\"\", \"\\\"If the animal reacts to you or your dog, you are definitely too close,\\\" she said.\", \"O'Rourke said humans and wildlife can typically coexist safely, but it is vital to \\\"respect the wildness of wildlife.\\\"\", \"\\\"'Wildlife' is just that\\u2014wild,\\\" she said. \\\"Most dangerous and potentially harmful encounters occur because people fail to leave the animals alone or get too close.\\\"\", \"O'Rourke pointed out that it is illegal to harass or feed deer, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, pronghorn, moose and elk in Colorado.\", \"This is not the only time that a human was charged by an elk.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927516/elk-grazing-estes-park.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A group of elk pictured in Colorado's Estes Park.
