But how often do you encounter the writer as a character in his or her own story? Rarely \\u2014 probably because it\\u2019s a daring feat, one Louise Erdrich pulls off in \\u201cThe Sentence,\\u201d which just spent a week on the hardcover fiction list. The Pulitzer Prize winner even deputizes her on-page doppelg\\u00e4nger to hire her protagonist at an unnamed Minneapolis bookstore that sounds a lot like the one Erdrich owns in real life.\", \"Here\\u2019s how it goes down. Tookie, an Ojibwe woman with a checkered past, shows up for a job interview with Louise (no last name), who wears vintage oval eyeglasses, a beaded hairclip and \\u201ca general air of tolerance.\\u201d Instead of inquiring about her prospective employee\\u2019s credentials \\u2014 or her stint in prison \\u2014 Louise asks Tookie what she\\u2019s reading. Her answer: \\u201cAlmanac of the Dead,\\u201d by Leslie Marmon Silko. Louise says, \\u201cThis is a dark time for bookstores and we probably won\\u2019t make it.\\u201d Then she offers Tookie a job.\", \"In a phone interview, Erdrich talked about how her store, Birchbark Books & Native Arts, endured its own dark time because of the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd, which happened only a few miles away. She said, \\u201cI was trying to figure out how to keep everyone at the bookstore safe. Everyone was taking a shift alone so they could assist with curbside pickup and advise people of books they might like.\\u201d Erdrich added, \\u201cI just want to say that we\\u2019re fine now, we\\u2019ve been busy, we\\u2019re getting a lot of love. Anyone who wants to buy a book, I hope that person goes to their nearest independent bookstore and has a good browse.\\u201d\", \"The bookstore in \\u201cThe Sentence\\u201d is haunted by the ghost of a loyal but complicated customer who died while reading. Erdrich didn\\u2019t directly answer a question about whether Birchbark has ghosts of its own; she said, \\u201cI think there\\u2019s a sense \\u2014 and this happens in the book \\u2014 that the world becomes haunted.\\u201d She went on, \\u201cI think bookstores are haunted in different ways. I feel this way when I\\u2019m in the presence of a lot of books, a sense of a crowded consciousness.\\u201d\", \"What was it like to write about herself? \\u201cI had to have a Louise in there,\\u201d Erdrich laughed. \\u201cI think my favorite moment is when Louise is told that perhaps a sentence was written that was powerful enough to kill, and she says, as every writer secretly might say, \\u2018I wish I could write a sentence like that.\\u2019\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"031b051c4d8011ecaa3351ee8061e47f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"031b051c4d8011ecaa3351ee8061e47f"}},
