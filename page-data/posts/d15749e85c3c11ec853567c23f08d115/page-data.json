Carlos Cort\\u00e9s, the creative director of a 92-year-old family-owned chocolate company in Puerto Rico, hopes to create a new destination for chocolate enthusiasts in the Bronx.\", \"On Friday, Chocobar Cort\\u00e9s plans to open its first brick-and-mortar location on the United States mainland, Chocobar NYC, on a busy block in the Mott Haven neighborhood. The restaurant and cafe will be not only an expansion, but also a reconnection with the Puerto Rican diaspora.\", \"\\u201cWe want to start where our community is, and then grow from there,\\u201d said Mr. Cort\\u00e9s, 34, the scion of the bean-to-bar company, which also operates in the Dominican Republic.\", \"Mr. Cort\\u00e9s, who attended Columbia and New York University, said he chose Mott Haven because of its recent spurt of development, its large Puerto Rican and Dominican populations and its proximity to similar communities in Inwood, Spanish Harlem and Washington Heights. One in six New Yorkers is either Puerto Rican or Dominican, but in the Bronx that number soars to nearly one in two. \\u201cThe Bronx is changing, and we\\u2019re here to be a part of it,\\u201d he said.\", \"The original Chocobar Cort\\u00e9s restaurant, which opened in 2013 on a central thoroughfare in Old San Juan, routinely tops review and travel sites. (It was USA Today\\u2019s top Caribbean restaurant in 2017.) When Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York visited San Juan in November, Chocobar was one of her first stops.\", \"In the Dominican Republic, Cort\\u00e9s has cocoa plantations and a popular brand, Embajador, that uses the Cort\\u00e9s logo. A visitor center, with a cafe led by Ricardo de Obald\\u00eda, the chef of the Chocobar in San Juan, opened in September at a Cort\\u00e9s factory in Santo Domingo.\", \"The Bronx restaurant, modeled after the San Juan location, continues the company\\u2019s tradition of using chocolate in varied and often surprising ways. Its extensive menu includes an array of 10 hot chocolates; grilled cheese sandwiches with chocolate butter; burgers with chocolate ketchup; Bloody Marys made with chocolate bitters; serrano-Manchego croquettes with chocolate dipping sauce; and chalupitas de mofongo with grated chocolate guacamole.\", \"There are steaks and chicken seasoned with chocolate rub, eggs sprinkled with chocolate salt and even salads dressed in chocolate vinaigrette. A tradition from rural Puerto Rico pairs hot chocolate with Cheddar. The overall effect has a Willy Wonka giddiness.\", \"\\u201cYou have to see chocolate as a condiment and not as a candy,\\u201d said Maria Mart\\u00ednez, the chef of Chocobar NYC, who was born in Brooklyn but raised in Quebradillas, in northwest Puerto Rico. Her mofongo at Caf\\u00e9 Ghia, a Bushwick, Brooklyn, restaurant that closed in 2017, regularly drew long lines every morning.\", \"In a phone interview from his home in San Juan, Ignacio Cort\\u00e9s, Carlos\\u2019s father and the company\\u2019s chief executive, said Cort\\u00e9s chocolate has been available in the United States in scattered groceries and bodegas since 1951, and is now distributed in 20 states. \\u201cWe are a reference for the first and second generations who came to New York,\\u201d he said, \\u201ca reference to what they left and what they long for.\\u201d\", \"Pablo Garc\\u00eda Smith, who offers food tours of San Juan, said that Chocobar serves as \\u201ca generational bridge,\\u201d linking abuelas with young people and Instagram influencers. \\u201cThe restaurants \\u2014 in San Juan and now in New York \\u2014 close the loop of nostalgia.\\u201d (Last summer, Cort\\u00e9s sold chocolate bars wrapped in comic strips of La Borinque\\u00f1a, an Afro-Puerto Rican superhero created in 2016.)\", \"The Mott Haven neighborhood has experienced a rush of development from within the community, or \\u201cgentefication,\\u201d from the Spanish word \\u201cgente\\u201d (people). Chocobar shares a block with the Lit. Bar, a wine bar and a much-needed bookstore; Beatstro, a hip-hop bistro that hosts break-dancing battles; Famous Nobodys, a streetwear boutique; and the Thinkubator, a job training nonprofit that\\u2019s about to open a cafe.\", \"\\u201cWe have seen and we\\u2019re going to see the Puerto Rican community occupy a greater place in the political and economic life of our country,\\u201d said Representative Ritchie Torres, a Bronx native of Puerto Rican and African American descent who was elected last year in the borough\\u2019s 15th Congressional District. \\u201cI\\u2019m excited by the Puerto Rican empowerment of new venues like Chocobar NYC and the entrepreneurial spirit they bring to our borough.\\u201d\", \"Carlos Cort\\u00e9s expressed concern about the role of businesses in expressing everything Puerto Rico has to offer.\", \"\\u201cWe have J. Lo. We have Lin-Manuel Miranda. We have Ricky Martin,\\u201d Mr. Cort\\u00e9s said. \\u201cBut I\\u2019m trying to be an example so other entrepreneurs can say we can do business, too, instead of being left out of the conversation \\u2014 which feels doubly frustrating when you can speak two languages.\\u201d\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
