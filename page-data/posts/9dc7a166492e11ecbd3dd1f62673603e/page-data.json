Hereâ€™s why.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-19T11:49:29.000Z","content":"[\"The federal government\\u2019s guidance on Covid booster shots has often been confusing, but it looks as if it\\u2019s about to become much simpler.\", \"The F.D.A. appears to be on the verge of authorizing Moderna and Pfizer booster shots for all adults in the U.S. If it does, anyone over 18 can get a booster, as long as it\\u2019s been at least six months since their last shot. (The C.D.C. has said that adults who received the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine should get a booster at least two months later.)\", \"Dr. Anthony Fauci has become \\u201ca very, very relentless advocate\\u201d for boosters, The Times\\u2019s Sharon LaFraniere, who covers the federal government\\u2019s response to the pandemic, told us. \\u201cHe keeps pointing out that the data is getting stronger.\\u201d\", \"Today we\\u2019ll walk you through what\\u2019s compelling regulators to widen eligibility, who needs the shots most and how to get one.\", \"First, immunity is waning. While experts debate the pace at which the vaccines become less effective, there\\u2019s strong evidence that they do lose some of their ability to prevent Covid infections. (These charts show the decline.) While the vaccines\\u2019 protection against severe disease mostly holds, some studies suggest they become somewhat less effective at doing so, particularly for older people or others with underlying medical conditions.\", \"Second, expanding booster access is simpler than asking Americans to consult a list of rules to determine whether they\\u2019re eligible. As our colleague Apoorva Mandavilli put it, \\u201cIt\\u2019s easier to just tell people to get them.\\u201d\", \"Third, broadening eligibility to all adults would bring the U.S. in line with the approach of other countries, including Israel and Canada. Several U.S. states have begun expanding booster access on their own, essentially declaring that they couldn\\u2019t wait for the federal government.\", \"\\u201cCritics would say that the C.D.C. is starting to look more like a caboose than a locomotive,\\u201d Sharon says. If the agency recommends boosters for all adults, \\u201cthey\\u2019re just authorizing what\\u2019s already happening.\\u201d\", \"The government has already recommended that older adults, people 50 and up with underlying medical conditions and those who are immunocompromised get an additional shot. And the C.D.C. has allowed boosters for many others.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve urged everyone I know who is higher risk to get a booster,\\u201d Zeynep Tufekci, the sociologist and Times Opinion columnist, writes.\", \"Some experts believe that the urgency for younger, healthier Americans to get a booster is lower. But others have started to make the case for it. \\u201cAll vaccinated adults would benefit from a booster,\\u201d Dr. Ashish Jha of Brown University wrote yesterday in The Atlantic.\", \"Why? Cases are rising again \\u2014 as of Wednesday, the U.S. was averaging over 88,000 new cases a day, up 23 percent from two weeks ago \\u2014 and another winter surge seems possible, particularly in parts of the country with lower vaccination rates. (Look up your county\\u2019s numbers.) That increases the urgency of getting more Americans as much protection as they can.\", \"And although new infections are concentrated among the unvaccinated, Jha notes, breakthrough infections have become more common. For younger and healthier adults, getting a booster can lessen the chances of getting sick and of spreading the virus to someone more vulnerable.\", \"And boosters appear to work. Evidence from Israel, which has offered extra shots to all adults, suggests that a third Pfizer dose increases protection against infection to a level similar to the vaccine\\u2019s initial efficacy.\", \"Once the government broadens eligibility, you\\u2019ll be able to go to your local pharmacy, a doctor\\u2019s office or anywhere else where vaccines are available.\", \"Mixing and matching different types of vaccines seems to provide a stronger immune response, Apoorva says, especially if you get a Moderna one after two Pfizer shots or following the single-dose of J.&J.\", \"Some public health experts have urged the U.S. and other countries not to make boosters widely available. They argue that doing so will limit the supply of shots for the rest of the world, especially for residents of less wealthy countries.\", \"But as Sharon notes, the U.S. government has already stockpiled enough vaccine doses to give boosters to the adult population. And the Biden administration, under pressure to increase the supply to poor nations, is planning to expand manufacturing capacity with the goal of producing at least a billion more doses a year.\", \"Millions of doses have already been distributed to pharmacies and clinics around the U.S. \\u201cThey cannot be recaptured and sent abroad,\\u201d Jha writes. \\u201cEither we use those doses here or we throw them away.\\u201d\", \"More on the virus:\", \"Your family\\u2019s Thanksgiving-table arguments are about something much deeper, Emily Esfahani Smith says.\", \"The Biden administration will ultimately be judged by whether it reduced inequality and spread opportunity. So far, it\\u2019s doing that, David Brooks argues.\", \"The European Union\\u2019s fear of migrants has given autocrats the tools for blackmail, Charlotte McDonald-Gibson writes.\", \"Generations: Where are young people most optimistic? In poorer nations.\", \"First person: To appease the Catholic Church, a married couple lived like brother and sister.\", \"Competition: He helped build Tesla.
