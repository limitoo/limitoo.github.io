Chapman struck a fluent 55 from 42 balls, hitting four boundaries and two sixes, before he was out caught and bowled by Beckham Wheeler-Greenall.\", \"Worker pressed on to his own half-century after Chapman's dismissal, now joined by Glenn Phillips (14 not out) with the target only 19 runs away.\", \"Worker stayed not out, and hit the winning runs with a miscued pull shot off Angus McKenzie that fell in a gap at fine leg, seeing the Auckland pair run back for two to complete victory.\", \"The win sees Auckland sit fourth on the Super Smash ladder with three wins and 12 points, just two shy of leaders Northern Brave, and behind second-placed Canterbury Kings and third-placed Central Stags on net run rate.\", \"Otago meanwhile sit bottom of the table with just one win from their opening seven matches, two points shy of fifth-placed Wellington.\"]","href_hash":"3d97db0a686211ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3d97db0a686211ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
