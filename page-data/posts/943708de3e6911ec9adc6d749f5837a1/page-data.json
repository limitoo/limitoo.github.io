So there's something wrong with him, he's a sick guy.\\\"\", \"Later on during the show, Trump ranted about Baldwin, who he said doesn't know personally, and his behavior toward reporters, suggesting that \\\"there's something wrong\\\" with the actor.\", \"\\\"I've watched him for years. He gets into fistfights with reporters. I mean, everything he does, he's a volatile guy. He's a nutjob,\\\" Trump said.\", \"The former president also spoke about the way he would have handled the situation differently if he was in Baldwin's shoes and was given a prop gun on set.\", \"\\\"If they handed me a gun, I would never point it at somebody and shoot it, you know. I don't care about checking the gun. They hand you a gun you're not going to point it at somebody,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"This was really a cinematographer, so it's not even like an actress that's on set with you, this was a cinematographer, so that means he took the gun and pointed it at a cinematographer, pulled the trigger and she was dead,\\\" Trump added.\", \"He also noted that with the open-air setting where the set was, he would have pointed the gun up in the air.\", \"Baldwin has been vocal about the former president and his statements which Trump said he doesn't like. The actor used to mock Trump on Saturday Night Live in multiple impressions of the former president.\", \"\\\"He did, I thought, a poor job of imitating me,\\\" Trump said on Thursday. \\\"Alec Baldwin was terrible at imitating me and by the way, if I thought he was good and I didn't like his politics or I didn't like him, I would have said he was good but he was terrible. I don't actually know him, but I've watched him over the years because of the fact that he did this so much on Saturday Night Live.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927398/trump-accuses-baldwin-intentional-shooting-set.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Former President Donald Trump ranted about actor Alec Baldwin's behavior and suggested that the actor might have intentionally shot the \\\"Rust\\\" cinematographer on set.
