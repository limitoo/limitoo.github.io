Cuomo's nearly three-term tenure crashed a week after a separate investigation by New York Attorney General Letitia James accused him of sexually harassing 11 women.\", \"Cuomo has largely denied wrongdoing, but was not interviewed by investigators from Davis Polk & Wardwell. Investigators for Davis Polk reviewed approximately 600,000 pages of documents and interviewed or received testimony from more than 200 people.\", \"A representative for Cuomo has not yet responded to a request for comment on the investigators' report.\\u00a0\", \"The report delves deepest into two sets of sexual harassment allegations made against Cuomo, made by a New York State trooper who worked on his security detail, and by Brittany Commisso, a former aide whose groping allegation has led to a criminal charge filed by the Albany County sheriff.\", \"Investigators wrote that colleagues of the trooper who accused Cuomo of harassment corroborated her testimony. The trooper said misbehavior by Cuomo included \\\"running his finger slowly down her spine, running his hand across her stomach, kissing and hugging her, and making numerous inappropriate and offensive comments,\\\" according to the report.\", \"Investigators also cited \\\"new evidence\\\" that corroborates Commisso's account. She said in an August CBS News interview the then-governor groped her breast in December 2019.\", \"The investigators wrote \\\"Commisso did not have access\\\" to the new evidence corroborating her testimony \\u2014 including phone logs, text messages and records of employee ID badge swipes into and out of the Executive Mansion.\", \"Investigators wrote that Commisso's recollection of seemingly minute details from the day \\\"indicates that an out-of-the-ordinary incident occurred on that date, and further corroborates Ms. Commisso's allegations.\\\"\", \"\\\"We have turned this evidence over to law enforcement,\\\" they wrote.\", \"The report concludes that while state reports on nursing home deaths at the height of the pandemic were released \\\"under the auspices of\\\" the state's Department of Health, \\\"it was substantially revised by the Executive Chamber and largely intended to combat criticisms regarding former Governor Cuomo's directive that nursing homes should readmit residents that had been diagnosed with COVID-19.\\\"\", \"They wrote that the Cuomo administration chose to report only deaths that occurred inside nursing facilities, withholding those that occurred outside the homes \\u2014 for instance, people who were transferred to hospitals before their deaths. That decision ultimately minimized the extent to which COVID was ravaging New York nursing homes in 2020, the investigation concluded.\", \"Even as COVID was killing thousands in New York, Cuomo began negotiating a deal worth millions to publish a book about his leadership during the pandemic. Cuomo has long said any staff who worked on the book were \\\"volunteers.\\\" The investigators concluded that state resources and paid staff hours were devoted to the book.\", \"\\\"Certain senior state officials worked extensively on the book,\\\" investigators wrote, \\\"including attending meetings with agents and publishers, transcribing and drafting portions of the book, coordinating the production and promotion of the book, and participating in working sessions to review and finalize the book.\\\"\", \"They cite a \\\"senior state official\\\" who said \\\"book-related assignments were given by superiors and expected to be completed, and the work was not voluntary.\\\"\", \"Investigators noted that Cuomo's book contract guaranteed him $5.2 million in royalty advances, plus additional payments if the book sold well.\", \"On November 16, a New York State ethics panel voted Tuesday to rescind its 2020 approval of the book, potentially setting up a legal showdown over millions of dollars in proceeds.\\u00a0\", \"Graham Kates is an investigative reporter covering criminal justice, privacy issues and information security for CBS News Digital.
