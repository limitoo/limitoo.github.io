Epstein killed himself in a Manhattan jail cell in 2019 at the age of 66 while awaiting trial on sex abuse charges.\", \"The defense has sought to portray the accounts of her four accusers as not credible. Menninger said the women were motivated to implicate Maxwell by the prospect of a payout from a victim's compensation fund run by Epstein's estate.\", \"\\\"The money brought the accusers to the FBI,\\\" Menninger said, saying the women brought personal injury lawyers with them to interviews with law enforcement agents decades after the alleged abuse occurred. \\\"Memories have been manipulated in aid of the money.\\\"\", \"Menninger's closing argument is expected to last up to two-and-a-half hours. Prosecutors will then have an opportunity to present a rebuttal argument before the jury begins deliberating.\", \"Earlier on Monday, a prosecutor said Maxwell was Epstein's \\\"partner in crime\\\" in a scheme to abuse teenage girls.\", \"Assistant U.S. Attorney Alison Moe argued that Maxwell's presence made young girls feel comfortable spending time with Epstein. Otherwise, receiving an invitation to spend time with a middle-aged man would have seemed \\\"creepy\\\" and \\\"set off alarm bells,\\\" Moe said.\", \"\\\"Epstein could not have done this alone,\\\" Moe said. \\\"When that man is accompanied by a posh, smiling, respectable, age-appropriate woman, that's when everything starts to seem legitimate. And when that woman acts like it's totally normal for that man to touch those girls, it lures them into a trap.\\\"\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"08583ea861c311ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"08583ea861c311ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
