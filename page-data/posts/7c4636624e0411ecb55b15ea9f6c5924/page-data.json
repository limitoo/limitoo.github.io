And they're getting the products into stores. So the best thing that people can do is just to keep checking back over and over and go to the store \\u2014 even if you think something is sold out.\\\"\", \"Another plus: Some retailers are also offering discounts if you buy more than one \\\"evergreen\\\" toy popular across ages and tastes, like board games. One reason? They tend to be well stocked because of their broad appeal, and some are assembled in the U.S., which means supplies are plentiful.\", \"\\\"Board games, building sets, [and] arts and crafts toys are very generic and can be enjoyed by lots and lots of kids. You don't have that same like character-driven element pushing toy sales,\\\" Silva said. \\\"They are always very well stocked.\\\"\", \"To be sure, some hot toys are selling out fast, Silva said. They include Magic Mixies and the Hot Wheels Mario Kart Rainbow Road Raceway, both on the publication's top 10 list. Another trend \\u2014 more character-driven toys tied to movies and video games are returning as the pace of new films and shows picks up, she noted.\", \"And electronic toys that require chips?\", \"\\\"A lot of this stuff is typically already pre-manufactured months and months and months ago, and it's just about getting it over here,\\\" Silva said, adding that for now, toymakers \\\"expect that the toy stock is actually going to be pretty good.\\\"\", \"Here's a look at the top 10 most popular toys this season, according to Toy Insider:\", \"The plush stuffed toys, which come in sizes from 3.5 inches to 24 inches, gained\\u00a0popularity on TikTok\\u00a0and other social media.
