He said that countries that can take on more migrants fleeing war and hatred \\\"cannot be silent and look away at this culture of indifference.\\\"\", \"However, he also acknowledged that there are limits. According to the AP, Cyprus is processing more asylum claims per capita than any other EU nation. In the past ten months, the small island nation has already seen a 38 percent increase from last year in migrant and refugee arrivals.\", \"\\\"This is a generous island, but it can't do everything because the number of people who arrive is superior to the possibility to insert, integrate and promote them (in Cypriot society),\\\" he said.\", \"In a statement, the Vatican said it made arrangements to bring about 12 refugees from Cyprus to Italy. Cyprus' interior minister, Nicos Nouris, told the AP arrangements had been made to transfer 50 asylum-seekers.
