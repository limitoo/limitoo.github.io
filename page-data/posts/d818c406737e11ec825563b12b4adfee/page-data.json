While that is far larger than many other rat species, Magawa was still small enough and light enough that he did not trigger mines if he walked over them.\", \"Magawa was capable of searching a field the size of a tennis court in just 20 minutes - something Apopo says would take a person with a metal detector between one and four days.\", \"In 2020, Magawa was awarded the PDSA Gold Medal - sometimes described as the George Cross for animals - for his \\\"life-saving devotion to duty\\\".
