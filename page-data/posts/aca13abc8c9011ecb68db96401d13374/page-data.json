While other infections can cause stillbirth by passing through the placenta and damaging the fetus, Covid-19 takes a different, dangerous tack.\", \"\\u201cIt causes extensive damage to the placenta, and stillbirth occurs from lack of oxygen,\\u201d said Dr. David Schwartz, a perinatal pathologist in Atlanta and the lead author of the study. \\u201cThe placental destruction is so severe that whether or not the fetus becomes infected might be irrelevant.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Schwartz\\u2019s research team analyzed 64 stillbirth cases and four neonatal deaths in 12 countries. All the pregnant mothers were unvaccinated, and all were thought to have been infected with the Delta variant. In the 68 cases, an average of 77 percent of the placenta had been destroyed.\", \"Although stillbirths attributed to Covid-19 are uncommon \\u2014 overall, about 24,000 babies are stillborn in the United States each year \\u2014 a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released in November found that pregnant women who had Covid-19 when they delivered their babies were almost twice as likely to have a stillbirth as healthy women who did not have Covid.\", \"The new study about complications for mothers found that the severity of their Covid symptoms was the key factor in their heightened risk. The most severely ill women were three times more likely to develop pregnancy complications than those who tested negative or had milder symptoms.\", \"The researchers analyzed electronic medical records of about 14,000 pregnant women between March 1 and Dec. 31, 2020, before vaccines were widely available. Of those, about 2,350 tested positive during pregnancy or within six weeks of delivery.\", \"The study also pointed to increased danger for newborns: Covid-19 was significantly associated with premature birth and admission to newborn intensive care units.\", \"\\u201cWe know from other studies that vaccination prevents the most severe symptoms of the disease,\\u201d said Dr. Torri D. Metz, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at University of Utah Health, who led the study. \\u201cSo, this is just another piece of the puzzle that should encourage pregnant people to get vaccinated.\\u201d\", \"The new studies add to research showing the danger of Covid-19 to pregnant women and their babies. The C.D.C. has strongly encouraged vaccination for women who are pregnant, breastfeeding or planning to become pregnant. But vaccination rates are low among pregnant women, even though early research has found no evidence that the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna vaccines pose serious risks during pregnancy.\"]","href_hash":"aca13abc8c9011ecb68db96401d13374"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"aca13abc8c9011ecb68db96401d13374"}},
