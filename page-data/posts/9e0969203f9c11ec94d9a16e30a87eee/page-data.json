Here's a look at how they happen.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How are people dying at these events?</div>\", \"They're often getting squeezed so hard that they can't get any oxygen. It's usually not because they're getting trampled.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f4e168d02049742cc01eea138aeecfd1\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

crowd surges, the force can be strong enough to bend steel.\", \"It can also hit people from two directions: one from the rear of the crowd pushing forward and another from the front of the crowd trying to escape.\", \"If some people have fallen, causing a pile-up, pressure can also come from above.\", \"Caught in the middle are people's lungs.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What is it like to be swept up?</div>\", \"A UK inquiry into the 1989 Hillsborough tragedy found a form of asphyxiation was listed as an underlying cause in a majority of the deaths.\", \"Ninety-six people died as more than 50,000 fans streamed into the stadium for a FA Cup semi-final between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest on a warm, sunny day.\", \"Some of them packed into a tunnel and were getting pressed so hard into perimeter fencing that their faces were\\u00a0distorted by the mesh, the inquiry found.\", \"\\\"Survivors described being gradually compressed, unable to move, their heads 'locked between arms and shoulders \\u2026 faces gasping in panic,'\\\" the report said.\", \"\\\"They were aware that people were dying and they were helpless to save themselves.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What causes these events?</div>\", \"According to\\u00a0Dr GK Still, a visiting professor of crowd science at the University of Suffolk in England, a crowd's density may be the most important factor in a deadly surge.\", \"He also cited poor crowd-management systems, where event organisers don't have strong procedures in place to report red flags or warnings, among the reasons deadly surges occur.\", \"\\\"My research covers over 100 years of disasters, and invariably they all come down to very similar characteristics,\\\" Dr Still\\u00a0said.\", \"But Dr Still said the crowd usually needed\\u00a0a catalyst to get everyone rushing in the same direction.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f8686c0ace81a5680f4dca7e73c7df00\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Police, stewards and supporters tend and care for wounded supporters on the field at Hillsborough Stadium, in Sheffield.(AP: File)</div>\", \"A sudden downpour of rain or hail could send everyone running for cover, as was the case when 93 soccer fans in Nepal were killed while surging toward locked stadium exits in 1988.\", \"Or, in an example that is much more common in the United States than other countries, someone yells, \\\"He has a gun!\\\"\", \"Surges don't always happen because people are running away from something.\", \"Sometimes they're caused by a crowd moving toward something, such as a performer on the stage, before they hit a barrier.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Managing crowd density</div>\", \"Dr Still, who has testified as an expert witness in court cases involving crowds, says events need\\u00a0to be designed to make sure\\u00a0the density of the crowd does not exceed specific guidelines.\", \"<img

crowds at the Big Day Out, following the 2001 tragedy.\\u00a0(Supplied: Sophie Howarth)</div>\", \"That includes having enough space for everyone and large enough gaps for people to move about.\", \"Some venues will take precautions when they know a particularly high-energy crowd is coming to an event.\", \"Dr Still said some venues will set up pens around stages in order to break large crowds into smaller groups.\", \"That can also allow for pathways for security officers or for emergency exits.\", \"In the aftermath of Jessica\\u00a0Michalik's death at the 2001 Big Day Out, the team behind the festival rolled out 12 new crowd-safety measures \\u2014 such as crowd-care volunteers, more water and\\u00a0video monitoring.\", \"They also designed a D-barrier, which created\\u00a0an area of space between the mosh pit and the rest of the crowd that could be used to relieve pressure.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Has the pandemic impacted crowds?</div>\", \"Steve Allen from Crowd Safety, a UK-based consultancy engaged in major events around the world, said it was always important to monitor the crowd, but especially now events were ramping up in size following the pandemic lockdown.\", \"\\\"As soon as you add people into the mix, there will always be a risk,\\\" he said.\", \"Mr Allen recommended\\u00a0events have trained crowd spotters with noise-cancelling headsets who are in direct communication with someone near the performer, who was willing to temporarily stop the event if there was a life-threatening situation.\", \"That could be a crowd surge, structural collapse, fire, or something else.\", \"Mr Allen said he has personally stopped about 25 performances by the likes of Oasis, the Red-Hot Chili Peppers and Eminem.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Why is it not called a stampede?\\u00a0</div>\", \"Professionals don't use the words \\\"stampede\\\" or \\\"panic\\\" to describe such scenarios because that can put the blame for the deaths on the people in the crowd.\", \"Instead, they more often point at the event's organizers for failing to provide a safe environment.\", \"\\\"Safety has no profit, so it tends to be the last thing in the budget,\\\" Dr Still said.\", \"AP/ABC\"]","href_hash":"9e0969203f9c11ec94d9a16e30a87eee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9e0969203f9c11ec94d9a16e30a87eee"}},
