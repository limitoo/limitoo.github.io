Trump endorsed Ortagus in January.\\u00a0\", \"The party voted to remove these three candidates from the ballot because they say they had not satisfied the party's membership requirements for candidacy. Party bylaws require candidates to have voted in at least three of the last four statewide Republican primaries.\", \"In a statement, Ortagus said her team is \\\"evaluating the options before us\\\" and that she is \\\"deeply disappointed\\\" by the decision.\", \"\\\"I'm a bonafide Republican by their standards, and frankly, by any metric. I'm further disappointed that the party insiders at the Tennessee Republican Party do not seem to share my commitment to President Trump's America First policies,\\\" Ortagus wrote.\\u00a0\", \"Starbuck, a filmmaker backed by Republican Representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Madison Cawthorn, blasted the process and said the party \\\"declared war on TN voters yesterday.\\\"\", \"\\\"Sadly in Tennessee candidates are NOT elected, they're SELECTED by a tiny group of establishment RINO hacks. We'll fight this with every ounce of fight we have,\\\" he tweeted.\\u00a0\", \"The move comes after the Tennessee Legislature passed a bill that would require federal candidates to have resided in the state for at least three years. Ortagus moved to Nashville from Washington D.C. in 2021.\\u00a0\", \"Tennessee Governor Bill Lee, a Republican, allowed the bill to become law without his signature. But because it became law after a candidate filing deadline, state officials said it did not apply retroactively.\\u00a0\", \"Tennessee State Senator Frank Niceley led the passage of this legislation, which aimed to kick Ortagus off the ballot. He is backing another candidate in the race, former state House Speaker Beth Harwell.\\u00a0\", \"In an interview with NBC News, Niceley said only Jewish members of Trump's family cared about Ortagus' candidacy. Ortagus converted to Judaism while she was stationed in Baghadad, according to Jewish Insider.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I don't think Trump cares one way or the other. I think Jared Kushner \\u2014 he's Jewish, she's Jewish \\u2014 I think Jared will be upset. Ivanka will be upset. I don't think Trump cares,\\\" he told NBC News.\", \"Earlier this month, Niceley invoked Adolf Hitler in a message about homeless people during a floor speech, holding up Hitler as an example of a homeless person who turned his life around.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Anti-Semitism is the oldest and one of the most vile forms of hatred on this earth, and Senator Niceley should be ashamed of his repeated anti-Semitic rhetoric,\\\" Ortagus said in a statement.\\u00a0 \\\"I am incredibly proud to call myself a part of the Jewish people, and I have always called out anti-Semitism when I see it in all of its forms. I will condemn anyone who traffics in this hate-mongering.\\\"\", \"A contact for Trump had not yet responded for comment about his backed candidate being taken off the ballot. Tennessee's Republican Party had also not yet responded for comment.\", \"Tennessee's 5th District was left open by longtime House Democrat Jim Cooper, after redistricting in the state carved up the Nashville area seat to make it more solidly Republican.\\u00a0\", \"Aaron Navarro is an associate producer for the political unit at CBS News, focusing on House and gubernatorial campaigns as well as the census and redistricting.\"]","href_hash":"0ec16d95c0c511ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0ec16d95c0c511ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
