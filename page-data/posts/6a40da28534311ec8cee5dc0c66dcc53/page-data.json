a Cheeky Monkeys security guard about the care they provide to patrons who have been kicked out of the venue for intoxication.\\u00a0\", \"Former Cheeky Monkeys security guard Shannon Mackie gave evidence on the fourth day of the two-week inquest about his recollection of ejecting Theo Hayez from the nightclub on the night the 18-year-old disappeared.\", \"Theo Hayez was last seen on CCTV walking away from the venue alone around 11pm on May 31, 2019.\", \"He has not been seen or heard from since.\", \"A key question of the inquest is whether Theo Hayez was lost, alone and fell into the ocean while trying to climb a cliff near the Cape Byron lighthouse, or whether he travelled a secluded and dark bush track towards Tallow Beach either with someone,\\u00a0to meet someone, or after encountering someone.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/97f22ac7e0ebf9f344b363cb8865bd0f\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Theo Hayez was last seen leaving Cheeky Monkeys on May 31, 2019.(Supplied: NSW Coroners Court)</div>\", \"Former Cheeky Monkeys security guard Shannon Mackie told the court he observed Theo \\\"approaching intoxication\\\" and escorted him outside where he was told he would not be allowed back inside the venue.\", \"Mr Mackie was shown CCTV footage of Theo and agreed with the counsel assisting the coroner, Kirsten Edwards, that there were no signs in the footage that Theo was intoxicated.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/cb4aa4b586afc3655c8677ea8350754b\\\"

agreed it was possible he could have made a mistake about Theo's level of intoxication, however, it was better to err on the side of caution, given the strict laws in New South Wales around the responsible service of alcohol.\", \"Asked why he had only crossed a box for \\\"intoxication\\\" on an incident report, but not recorded any other features,\\u00a0such as unbalanced or smelling of alcohol,\\u00a0Mr Mackie said he was unsure.\", \"Mr Mackie said the normal process for assessing whether someone was intoxicated was to take them outside to better observe their speech and movements but said he could not recall why this did not occur in Theo's case when shown CCTV footage.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e48a1d8098ec0316cd2017925c0d1688\\\"

nightclub had when evicting intoxicated people, Mr Mackie said security guards would go back inside to find the friends of evicted patrons if asked to do so.\", \"\\\"If they're really intoxicated, we would sit them down, get some water for them\\u00a0\\u2026 and make sure they're OK,\\\" Mr Mackie said.\", \"It was at that point that Theo's father Laurent Hayez shook his head in disagreement, waved his hand, and walked out of the courtroom.\\u00a0\", \"The head of security at Cheeky Monkeys, Bradley Hill, was also called to give evidence.\", \"<img

(left) and Shannon Mackie (right) at the Byron Bay courthouse.(ABC North Coast: Emma Rennie)</div>\", \"Both security guards were asked about whether there was a practice of evicting patrons to allow more people through the door who would pay a cover charge that increased as the night went on.\", \"Both denied it was a practice.\", \"They also denied there was any incentive to evict people who were not drinking in favour of people who would, or to evict men to allow more women into the venue.\", \"They were also asked about whether they knew of any adverse events after people had been asked to leave the nightclub, to which they both replied they were not aware of any incidents.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/aafed6dd7700babc7ff9189dd2c281ce\\\"

side of caution to comply with state laws.\", \"Earlier in the day, two backpackers who were with Theo at Cheeky Monkeys on the night he disappeared gave evidence saying they had no recollection of him being drunk.\", \"The inquest is expected to hear evidence tomorrow from a Hayez family friend and the former manager of the Wake Up! Hostel where Theo stayed.\"]","href_hash":"6a40da28534311ec8cee5dc0c66dcc53"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6a40da28534311ec8cee5dc0c66dcc53"}},
