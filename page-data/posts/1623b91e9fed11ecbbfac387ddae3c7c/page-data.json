The arts are a viable employment opportunity. And right now, people with disabilities are severely unemployed in this country.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"According to the U.S. Department of Labor, 19% of people living with a disability were employed last year, compared to almost 64% of people without a disability.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"So if we really care about equity and inclusion, this is something that we'll work to mind together. So that's why we do what we do,\\\" Therrien said. \\\"We pay all of our artists to be involved in our shows. We continue to, you know, increase that pay as much as we can. And also find opportunities for our artists outside of\\u00a0EPIC, and advocate for them.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Conor Tague is part of this year's EPIC Players cast in the musical comedy \\\"25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I really think the industry should be more open to people who are neurodivergent, or they have disabilities, to play characters with disabilities,\\\" Tague said, adding, \\\"If it's people with autism or Aspergers, ADHD, or anyone who's deaf\\u2026 what really matters is that they can do so many things, despite all of that.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"According to GLAAD's \\\"Where We Are in TV\\\" report from 2019, only 2.1% of regular characters on scripted primetime television portrayed people with disabilities, amounting to 18 characters total. Another report from the Ruderman Family Foundation showed 95% of TV characters with disabilities were played by able-bodied actors.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I think there's a fear that if we say, 'Stop casting neurotypical actors as neurodivergent characters,' that, you know, the producers or directors or whatever is just gonna hear, 'Stop telling neurodivergent stories,'\\\" Kaufman said. \\\"But I think it's just the message that we want to be sending, and that EPIC is sending is that \\u2014 keep telling these stories. Just include us. Let us help you tell them, because we're here and we're doing it. And we've been doing it. And we rock it.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"1623b91e9fed11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1623b91e9fed11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
