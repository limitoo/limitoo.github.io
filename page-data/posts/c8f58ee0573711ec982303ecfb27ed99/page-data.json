A biopsy confirmed the news, and doctors told him that surgery to remove his prostate was the best option.\", \"The surgery went well, and, two years later, there is no indication that the cancer has returned. But for Mr. Curtin, 66, diagnosis and surgery were only the beginning of a \\u201cclinical and psychological and emotional adventure\\u201d \\u2014 one he felt that many urologists were not equipped to handle, because he was gay and the majority of doctors and their patients were not.\", \"Post-treatment symptoms are similar for all prostate cancer patients, including urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction, diminished libido and loss of ejaculate. But researchers are finding that those changes may echo through the lives of gay and bisexual men in unexpected, and sometimes more difficult, ways.\", \"The obstacles can be physical and emotional, and may be reflected in patients\\u2019 relationships with their partners. And they may present a challenge to medical professionals more attuned to the relationship needs of straight men.\", \"Mr. Curtin said he was about three months into treatment when he was struck that \\u201cthere is a lot going on here \\u2014 the emotional and psychological effect \\u2014 that is not being treated.\\u201d\", \"His doctor\\u2019s first response, Mr. Curtin said, was, \\u201cMy office isn\\u2019t prepared for this.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Curtin\\u2019s search for a different approach led him to Dr. Channa Amarasekera, director of the Gay and Bisexual Men\\u2019s Urology Program at Northwestern Medicine in Chicago. The program, which began taking patients only in August, is the first of its kind in the United States, and Dr. Amarasekera, who has focused his career on urologic care for gay and bisexual men and other sexual minorities, is the program\\u2019s first leader.\", \"It is an emerging field of study driven in part by the increasing number of prostate cancer patients who identify as gay or bisexual. \\u201cHistorically, the medical system has sort of operated in a don\\u2019t-ask-don\\u2019t-tell environment, and that\\u2019s been problematic,\\u201d Dr. Amarasekera said. \\u201cFortunately, that\\u2019s changing. Patients are increasingly open about who they are.\\u201d\", \"The gay and bisexual men in their 50s and 60s who are now entering the prime demographic for prostate cancer also lived through the worst of the AIDS epidemic. That experience has left many of them more experienced in dealing with the medical establishment and more distrustful of it.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s important now to reassure patients who came of age through that time that things are different, and they can expect better care,\\u201d Dr. Amarasekera said.\", \"The problem, experts in the field say, is that the research about gay and bisexual men and prostate cancer is still woefully inadequate.\", \"\\u201cHistorically, most of the research on gay health was focused on H.I.V., and in young gay men, because that was the biggest killer,\\u201d said Simon Rosser, a professor of epidemiology and community health at the University of Minnesota, who led a study in 2017 of gay and bisexual men with prostate cancer.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s only now that as the AIDS generation grew older, and aged into health problems like prostate cancer, that specialists are starting to see gay patients. But they have not trained in sexual minorities and health care,\\u201d Dr. Rosser said.\", \"Dr. Edward Schaeffer, chair of the urology department at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University and chief of urology at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, said he sensed the importance of a new approach about three years ago.\", \"\\u201cI felt it was a big unmet need,\\u201d said Dr. Schaeffer, whose work has focused mostly on the disparities among men with prostate cancer, particularly between Black men and others. So he created the program with Dr. Amarasekera.Dr. Amarasekera studied urologists\\u2019 training and found that many reported receiving less than five hours of instruction on the treatment of gay and bisexual patients. He also surveyed gay patients, who overall said their sexual satisfaction was not adequately taken under consideration during treatment for prostate cancer.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s important to collect data on how treatment affects sexual function differently for gay and bisexual men, who have different sexual repertoires than straight men,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf you lack the tools to measure aspects of sexual function that are specific to gay and bisexual men, you lose an opportunity to track their progress.\\u201d\", \"Many of the men Dr. Amarasekera sees at the program\\u2019s two clinics \\u2014 one in downtown Chicago and the other in the historically gay Northalsted neighborhood \\u2014 are unprepared to face yet another health crisis. One of them is a 59-year-old lawyer in Chicago who is H.I.V.-positive, and who said he was not fully warned about how the removal of his prostate would affect his body.\", \"\\u201cThere is a wasting,\\u201d said the lawyer, who asked not to be quoted by name because not all of his family members were aware of his H.I.V. status. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a feminization of the body, shrinking of the genitals.\\u201d\", \"The health care system, he said, \\u201cmarginalizes gay men, particularly when it comes to sexual health, and the prostate is so linked to sexual health in gay men. It\\u2019s a sexual organ, and it\\u2019s been removed.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cA previous urologist simply said, \\u2018Go forward and enjoy your life, and bye,\\u2019\\u201d the lawyer said.\", \"Gary Dowsett, emeritus professor at the Australian Research Centre in Sex, Health and Society at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia, said such treatment, while not meant to be callous, is not uncommon. It\\u2019s just that many urologists don\\u2019t realize that the prostate is \\u201ckind of a male \\u2018G spot,\\u2019\\u201d and gay men more often are aware of it.\", \"\\u201cIf they do not understand the role of the prostate in sexual pleasure, it\\u2019s rarely a priority discussion,\\u201d said Dr. Dowsett, a prostate cancer survivor himself, said of urologists. \\u201cThe focus is usually on continence and erections, as if sex starts and ends there.\\u201d\", \"Jane Ussher, a professor at the Western Sydney University School of Medicine in Australia, has been studying the effects of cancer in gay men for 20 years.\", \"\\u201cPartial erectile dysfunction has a particular impact\\u201d on gay patients, she said, and they \\u201creport significantly greater concern about loss of ejaculate than heterosexual men. Visible ejaculate is eroticized in sex between men, and also signifies partner satisfaction \\u2014 a sign of good sex.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Schaeffer and Dr. Amarasekera said the information gathered through the Northwestern program would benefit urology as a whole. After all, straight men, too, often are distressed by the sexual consequences of treatment and feel that they were not adequately warned.\", \"\\u201cWhen you don\\u2019t ask the right questions or counsel patients about the potential impacts of treatment relevant to them, you are essentially not allowing them to make an informed decision,\\u201d Dr. Amarasekera said.\", \"\\u201cThis can lead to resentment, and understandably so, if they experience side effects from treatment,\\u201d he said.\", \"Dr. Schaeffer said he hoped the program\\u2019s approach to gay men\\u2019s urologic health would \\u201ctake off in big cities and then spread.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOne of my asks of Dr. Amarasekera is to focus on building the blueprint, to have it duplicated across the country,\\u201d he said.\", \"Dr. Amarasekera said he wanted to create a space that was free of judgment. \", \"\\u201cProstate cancer can transform men in nonphysical ways, eroding their spirit,\\u201d he said. Sometimes doctors must veer from the standard script in the treatment of straight men, he added: \\u201cYou have to meet your patients where they need to be.\\u201d\", \"Prostate cancer patients are not the program\\u2019s sole focus. \\u201cI see it expanding and being a place for gay men to seek urologic care in general,\\u201d Dr. Amarasekera said.\", \"Tom Samolinski, 63, does not have prostate cancer, but he sought out the program after suffering for years with urinary problems that had never been resolved. With Dr. Amarasekera, he said, \\u201cI felt heard on issues that I haven\\u2019t been able to verbalize.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Amarasekera \\u201cconsidered my whole person, and my whole personhood encompassed my being gay,\\u201d he added.\", \"That idea also inspired Perry McKay, a Chicago philanthropist whose donation helped get the Northwestern program off the ground. \\u201cMy belief is that if you always do what you\\u2019ve always done, you\\u2019ll get what you\\u2019ve always got,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cThis is an opportunity to communicate, train and educate urologists on how to provide better care tailored to the specific needs of gay and bisexual men,\\u201d he added.\", \"Dr. Rosser agreed. \\u201cIn the gay community, we don\\u2019t talk about prostate cancer,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cWe need specialists to ask about sexual orientation and to talk to gay men about the effects of treatment,\\u201d Dr. Rosser said. \\u201cAnd we need to tell every gay patient that it\\u2019s important to come out to your specialist. Your future sex life depends on it.\\u201d\", \"Gene Otto, who is the co-host of a support group in Palm Springs, Calif., for gay and bisexual men with prostate cancer, sees a growing need as well. One gay patient in his group, he said, was given literature geared toward women whose husbands had prostate cancer.\", \"\\u201cTheir whole concept \\u2014 they\\u2019re dealing with heterosexual men and their wives more than homosexual men,\\u201d Mr. Otto said.\", \"The Chicago lawyer who is being treated by Dr. Amarasekera said his experience with the program \\u201cgoes a long way to address the mistrust that many gay men feel toward medical institutions.\\u201d\", \"He is still together with the man he began dating right before his diagnosis, and they are planning a wedding. Sex remains a \\u201ctremendous pleasure,\\u201d he said.\", \"That\\u2019s the outcome Dr. Amarasekera wants for all his patients.\", \"\\u201cAfter treatment, many men with prostate cancer focus on the warmth in their relationships rather than the heat,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re here to say: \\u2018Yes, it\\u2019s important to pay attention to the warmth. But the heat isn\\u2019t over. We can still get you back.\\u2019\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c8f58ee0573711ec982303ecfb27ed99"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c8f58ee0573711ec982303ecfb27ed99"}},
