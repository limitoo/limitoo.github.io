The \\\"rolling stop\\\" feature allows vehicles to go through intersections with all-way stop signs at up to 5.6 miles per hour.\", \"Tesla agreed to the recall after two meetings with officials from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, according to documents. NHTSA said in documents that failing to stop for a sign can increase the risk of a crash. Tesla said that it knows of no crashes or injuries caused by the feature.\", \"The recall covers Model S sedans and X SUVs from 2016 through 2022, as well as 2017 to 2022 Model 3 sedans and 2020 through 2022 Model Y SUVs.\", \"Selected Tesla drivers are \\\"beta testing\\\" the \\\"Full Self-Driving\\\" software on public roads. The company says the cars cannot drive themselves and drivers must be ready to take action at all times.\", \"A firmware release to disable the rolling stops is expected to be sent out in early February.\", \"A message was left early Tuesday seeking comment from Tesla, which has disbanded its media relations department.\", \"Safety advocates complain that Tesla should not be allowed to test the vehicles in traffic with untrained drivers, and that the Tesla software can malfunction, exposing other motorists and pedestrians to danger. Most of the other auto companies with similar software test with trained human safety drivers.\", \"Tesla introduced the \\\"rolling stop\\\" feature in a software update that was sent out to the testing owners on October 20. NHTSA met with Tesla on Jan. 10 and 19 to discuss how the software operates, the documents said. On Jan. 20, the company agreed to disable the rolling stops with the software update.\", \"Owners will get required notification letters on March 28.\", \"The \\\"rolling stop\\\" feature let the Teslas go through all-way stop signs as long as the owner enabled the function. The vehicles have to be traveling below 5.6 mph while approaching the intersection, and no \\\"relevant\\\" moving cars, pedestrians or bicyclists can be detected nearby. All roads leading to the intersection had to have speed limits of 30 mph or less, the documents said. The Teslas would then be allowed to go through the intersection at 0.1 mph to 5.6 mph without coming to a complete stop.\", \"Alain Kornhauser, faculty chair of autonomous vehicle engineering at Princeton University, said the recall is an example of NHTSA is doing its job as the nation's road safety watchdog. The recall \\\"shows that they can be effective even if Tesla should have been more responsible in the first place,\\\" he said.\", \"In November, NHTSA said it was looking into a complaint from a Tesla driver that the \\\"Full Self-Driving\\\" software caused a crash. The driver complained to the agency that the Model Y went into the wrong lane and was hit by another vehicle. The SUV gave the driver an alert halfway through the turn, and the driver tried to turn the wheel to avoid other traffic, according to the complaint. But the car took control and \\\"forced itself into the incorrect lane,\\\" the driver reported. No one was hurt in the Nov. 3 crash in Brea, California, according to the complaint.\", \"In December, Tesla agreed to update its less sophisticated \\\"Autopilot\\\" driver-assist system after NHTSA opened an investigation. The investigation covered 765,000 vehicles \\u2014 almost everything that Tesla has sold in the U.S. since the start of the 2014 model year. In August, the agency said it had identified 11 crashes since 2018 in which Teslas on Autopilot or Traffic Aware Cruise Control have repeatedly crashed into emergency vehicles parked on roadways. Of the crashes identified by the NHTSA as part of the probe, 17 people were injured and one was killed.\", \"Auto safety regulators have also looked at roughly 580,000 Tesla vehicles equipped with a feature known as \\\"Passenger Play.\\\"\\u00a0Passenger Play, which is accessible through the cars' main driver's console, is supposed to turn on only when a Tesla car is in park, safety officials said at the end of 2021. But the NHTSA said it had received complaints that Passenger Play could turn on while someone was driving, raising the risk of an accident, according to a\\u00a0document\\u00a0filed by the agency in December.\", \"The company agreed to stop allowing video games to be played on center touch screens while its vehicles are moving.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"0627cd9a837611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0627cd9a837611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
