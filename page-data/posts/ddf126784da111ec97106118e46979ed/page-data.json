Moon said the packages had likely been outdoors for at least 24 hours before they were discovered, AL.com reported.\", \"FedEx officials arrived on the scene by Wednesday evening, hours after the packages' discovery, WBMA-LD reported. The company then dispatched trucks to pick up the remaining packages.\", \"However, FedEx wasn't able to retrieve all the packages by sundown. The company said it would continue retrieving them on Thursday morning. A BCSO deputy will guard the remaining packages through Wednesday night. Then, FedEx will scan all the discarded packages to determine their origins and intended destinations.\", \"\\\"We're looking into this internally and obviously can't confirm anything until we do,\\\" FedEx said in a statement issued to the aforementioned news station. \\\"We will follow up if we're able to find more information.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1940019/fedex-investigation-packages-discarded-ravine-alabama-police.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">FedEx has launched an investigation after police found hundreds of packages in an Alabama ravine.

The worker shortage has forced the shipping company to reroute thousands of packages to its other hubs in order to ensure their arrival.\", \"The company rerouted over 600,000 packages a day, leading to worsening service, said FedEx Chief Operating Officer Rajesh Subramaniam President, during a call with investors last month.\", \"The company\\u2014along with UPS and the U.S. Postal Service\\u2014have faced the increases in shipping that typically coincide with the gift-buying winter holiday season.\", \"FedEx said it would need 90,000 holiday workers this year, 20,000 more than last year. The company said it spent $450 million between June and August to lure and retain workers with higher wages, paid overtime and other benefits.\", \"This year, consumers will be shipping packages amid global supply chain issues that have threatened the availability and low prices of common foods and retail goods. This has caused more consumers to shop and ship their holiday gifts earlier than usual, Ryan Kelly, a marketing vice president at FedEx, told the Journal.\", \"When asked whether the federal government could help ensure the timely delivery of holiday packages, White House Press Correspondent Jen Psaki told reporters in mid-October, \\\"We are not the Postal Service or UPS or FedEx. We cannot guarantee.\\\"\", \"\\\"What we can do is use every lever at the federal government's disposal to reduce delays, to ensure that we are addressing bottlenecks in the system,\\\" Psaki added.\"]","href_hash":"ddf126784da111ec97106118e46979ed"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ddf126784da111ec97106118e46979ed"}},
