Bernstein had been a newsman since he was a teenager.\", \"\\\"The formative part of my being a reporter occurred from ages 16 to 21 at a great old-fashioned newspaper, The Washington Star \\u2013 not the Post,\\\" he said. \", \"\\\"You should have been in high school,\\\" said Martin. \", \"\\\"I just finished my junior year of high school,\\\" said Bernstein. \\\"I had sort of one foot in the juvenile court and one foot trying to figure out what I was going to do with my life, because it wasn't exactly going right.\\\"\", \"His new book, \\\"Chasing History: A Kid in the Newsroom\\\" (Henry Holt and Co.) is the prequel to Woodward and Bernstein's classic work, \\\"All the President's Men.\\\" It begins with the moment he first set foot inside a newsroom.\", \"Bernstein said, \\\"It was maybe the most exciting moment of my life \\u2013 this energy and, like, they were on the most urgent errands in the nation, and typing away on deadline.\\\"\", \"He had one marketable skill: \\\"I had taken typing with the girls in tenth grade, and I could type about 90 words a minute.\\\"\", \"He was hired as a copy boy, at $29 a week.\", \"The Washington Star has since gone the way of most afternoon papers and ceased to publish. Martin said, \\\"You have to be a certain age to remember the Washington Star.\\\"\", \"\\\"You sure do!\\\" Bernstein laughed. \", \"And how would he describe the Star? \\\"It was probably the best afternoon newspaper in the country.\\\"\", \"At the Star, Bernstein was surrounded by Pulitzer Prize-winning reporters \\u2013 men and women. When asked about his role models, Bernstein offered Sid Epstein: \\\"I owe him a lot. He somehow saw things in me, maybe that I didn't see in myself.

I flunked out.\\\"\", \"Without a college degree, the Star would not promote him.
