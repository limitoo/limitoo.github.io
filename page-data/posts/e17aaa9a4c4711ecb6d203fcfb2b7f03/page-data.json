That\\u2019s the single biggest one-year increase since we started keeping national records in 1960. And violence has continued to rise well into 2021.\", \"[You can listen to this episode of \\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\\u201d on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]\", \"To deny or downplay the seriousness of this spike is neither morally justified nor politically wise. Violence takes lives, traumatizes children, instills fear, destroys community life and entrenches racial and economic inequality. Public opinion responds in kind: Polling indicates that Americans are increasingly worried about violent crime. And if November\\u2019s state and local campaigns were any indication, public safety will be a defining issue in upcoming election cycles.\", \"Liberals and progressives need an answer to the question of how to handle rising violence. But that answer doesn\\u2019t need to involve a return to the punitive, tough-on-crime approach that has devastated Black and brown communities for decades and led millions of people to take to the streets in protest last summer.\", \"Patrick Sharkey is a sociologist at Princeton University and the author of \\u201cUneasy Peace: The Great Crime Decline, the Renewal of City Life, and the Next War on Violence.\\u201d The central claim of his work is this: Police are effective at reducing violence, but they aren\\u2019t the only actors capable of doing so.\", \"Sharkey\\u2019s research has shown that the rise of local nonprofits was an important contributor to the crime decline of the 1990s and 2000s. He has studied community-based models for addressing violence in places as varied as rural Australia and New York City. In recent years, his findings have been reinforced by study after study showing that interventions ranging from summer jobs programs to cognitive behavioral therapy to installing streetlights in dimly lit areas can produce sizable reductions in violence. As a result, Sharkey has developed a compelling, evidence-backed vision of how cities and communities can tackle violent crime without relying heavily on police.\", \"So this conversation is about what an alternative model of public safety could look like and all the messy, difficult questions it raises. It also explores the causes of the current homicide spike, why Sharkey thinks policing is ultimately an \\u201cunsustainable\\u201d solution to crime, how New York City managed to reduce gun violence by 50 percent while reducing arrests and prison populations, whether a less punitive approach to public safety can survive our current politics, why America has such abnormally high levels of violent crime in the first place and what the $5 billion violence prevention investment tucked into the reconciliation bill could mean for the future of public safety in the United States.\", \"You can listen to the whole conversation by following \\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\\u201d on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.
