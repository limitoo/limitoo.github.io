It had announced six - for Trump associates including top aides from the Republican's failed 2020 re-election campaign - on Monday.\", \"More than 670 people have been charged with taking part in the riot at the Capitol. It was the worst attack on the seat of the US government since the War of 1812 and the only time power in the United States has not been transferred peacefully.\", \"Trump has filed a suit to avoid turning over White House documents and urged former aides to reject panel subpoenas, claiming the right to withhold information because of executive privilege, a legal principle that protects many White House communications.\", \"Legal experts have disputed his claim that the principle applies.\", \"The House voted last month to hold longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon in contempt over his refusal to cooperate. The Department of Justice has not yet said whether it would pursue criminal contempt charges against Bannon.\", \"Among the others subpoenaed were John McEntee, who was White House personnel director, senior adviser Stephen Miller and former press secretary Kayleigh McEnany.\", \"The former Trump aides could not immediately be reached for comment or did not respond to requests for comment.\\u00a0\", \"Reuters / Newshub.\"]","href_hash":"fd5127d441f811ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fd5127d441f811ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
