The jury is currently deliberating on whether they are responsible for violence during the Unite the Right rally held in 2017 and if they are liable for injuries sustained by the plaintiffs of the federal lawsuit.\", \"Before deliberations began, lawyers for the plaintiffs told jurors that the defendants \\\"planned, executed and then celebrated\\\" racially motivated violent attacks. Text messages and social media posts from the defendants, including racist slurs and perceived threats of violence, were also shown.\", \"Lawyers for the defendants claimed that injuries by themselves cannot prove that their clients conspired to commit violence. They also invoked the First Amendment to counter the racist messages shown to the jury.\", \"The Unite the Right rally was held on August 11 and 12 of 2017 in Charlottesville in response to the city's plans to remove a statue of Confederate General Robert E. Lee.\", \"James Alex Fields Jr., a defendant in the lawsuit and an admitted admirer of Adolf Hitler, is currently serving life in prison for running his car through a crowd of counter-protestors. One such counter-protestor, Heather Heyer, was killed, and dozens of others were injured over two days. Nine of those people filed the lawsuit.\", \"Jury deliberations are currently underway, and their expected conclusion is unknown. The statue of Lee that sparked the rally was removed last July.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936549/unite-right.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A jury began deliberations November 19, 2021, in a civil trial of white nationalists accused of conspiring to commit racially motivated violence at the deadly \\u201cUnite the Right\\u201d rally in Charlottesville in 2017.

Moon said the juror is unvaccinated and therefore poses a greater risk to others.\", \"During a march on the University of Virginia campus, white nationalists surrounded counterprotesters, and shouted, \\\"Jews will not replace us!\\\" and threw burning tiki torches at them. The next day, an avowed admirer of Adolf Hitler rammed his car into a crowd, killing one woman and injuring 19.\", \"The lawsuit seeks monetary damages and a judgment that the defendants violated the plaintiffs' constitutional rights.\", \"Lawyers for the plaintiffs invoked a 150-year-old law passed after the Civil War to shield freed slaves from violence and protect their civil rights. Commonly known as the Ku Klux Klan Act, the law contains a rarely used provision that allows private citizens to sue other citizens for civil rights violations.\", \"The defendants used their closing arguments to distance themselves from Fields.\", \"Several defendants have testified that they resorted to violence only after they or their associates were attacked. They've blamed the violence on anti-fascist protesters, known as antifa, and also each other.\", \"The lawsuit is being funded by Integrity First for America, a nonprofit civil rights organization.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936554/statue-removal.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Deliberations have begun in a federal lawsuit trial against \\\"two dozen white supremacists, neo-Nazis, and white nationalist organizations\\\" who are accused of conspiring to commit racially-motivated violence in Charlottesville.
