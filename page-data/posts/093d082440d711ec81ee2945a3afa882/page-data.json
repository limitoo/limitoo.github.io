Now the land border has reopened for all fully vaccinated travelers, but Canadians still face a catch that may deter quick trips, and this time it\\u2019s one introduced by their own government.\", \"Canada, which reopened its border to travelers from the United States in August, requires that anyone entering the country present a negative Covid test taken within 72 hours, and it will not accept relatively low-cost rapid tests. Instead, the result must come from a more reliable polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, test, which can cost well over $100 and take one to two days.\", \"Canadians crossing for just a few hours can take the test in Canada before they leave. But some groups and politicians on both sides of the border have said recently that the cost and inconvenience associated with PCR testing will be a powerful deterrent to travel.\", \"Air travelers have already raised concerns about the cost. Angus Reid, the chairman of a nonprofit polling group that bears his name, said his son, daughter-in-law and two children had paid $1,200 for tests to return from Palm Springs, Calif.\", \"\\u201cPlus finding test centers in US is increasingly difficult,\\u201d he wrote on Twitter over the weekend. \\u201cThis needs to change. Now!\\u201d\", \"In Blaine, Wash., a small border city south of Vancouver, gas stations and shipping stores remained quiet Monday morning. Apart from a handful of Canadian license plates, the city showed little sign that the border had just reopened.\", \"Doug Hornsby, the owner of Border Mailbox and Parcel, said only one Canadian customer had picked up packages that morning. The man, from Alberta, had 17 packages waiting for him, the oldest of which had been there since March 2020.\", \"Because of the testing requirement, Mr. Hornsby said he didn\\u2019t expect many more customers.\", \"Skye Hill, the owner of a Chevron in Blaine, said her store had just finished $1 million in renovations before the border closed. Since then, revenue has plummeted 90 percent.\", \"Ms. Hill described Monday\\u2019s reopening as \\u201canticlimactic.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cEveryone\\u2019s so excited. You know, \\u2018The border\\u2019s finally opened after two years,\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut really, our business depends on those day trips.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe aren\\u2019t going to see those people, I don\\u2019t think, until they lift that Covid test,\\u201d she added.\", \"Closing the land border to most people had a drastic effect. In August 2019, slightly more than three million private vehicles entered the United States from Canada at land crossings. This August, there were only 449,004 such crossings.\", \"The testing policy may soon change. On Friday, Dr. Theresa Tam, Canada\\u2019s chief public health officer, said the PCR test requirement was being \\u201cactively looked at.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"093d082440d711ec81ee2945a3afa882"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"093d082440d711ec81ee2945a3afa882"}},
