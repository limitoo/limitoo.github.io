All three deaths were reported to the board because they had signs of myocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscle.\", \"\\\"Some Covid-19 vaccines, including the Pfizer vaccine, increase the risk of myocarditis... [but] Covid-19 infection increases the risk of myocarditis substantially more than vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine,\\\" the board said.\", \"It also noted myocarditis is treatable, with better outcomes the earlier treatment begins.\", \"In July, Medsafe issued an alert describing myocarditis as a rare side effect of the Pfizer vaccine.\", \"The 26-year-old man had no previous reported symptoms of myocarditis before getting the vaccine, but developed them in the days after his first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, the board's statement said. He did not seek any medical help.\", \"He died two weeks after he was vaccinated.\", \"Preliminary findings from his post-mortem supplied to the board indicated myocarditis as the probable cause of his death. And after considering the details, the board found \\\"myocarditis was probably due to vaccination in this individual\\\".\", \"It concluded the myocarditis symptoms of the man in his 60s were \\\"unlikely related to vaccination\\\". \\\"The time from vaccination to the onset of symptoms and clinical factors point to other causes and is not consistent with a causal link\\\".\", \"The board said it discussed the death of the 13-year-old \\\"at length\\\", and requested more information before making a decision. It expects its eventual findings will be made public once they are finalised.\", \"Each year, an average of 95 people are seen in hospitals with myocarditis. The disease can be caused by many things, including infection by a virus.\", \"The board said the cases did not alter the current knowledge about the vaccination or myocarditis; \\\"The benefits of vaccination with the Pfizer vaccine for Covid-19 continue to greatly outweigh the risk of such rare side effects.\\\"\", \"However myocarditis should continue to be highlighted as a very rare side effect, and people should be reminded of its symptoms, and when to seek medical advice.\", \"\\\"The symptoms of myocarditis may include chest pain, tightness or discomfort, shortness of breath or abnormal heartbeat (and/or accompanied by fever).\\\"\", \"The board acknowledged the family, wh\\u0101nau and friends of those who had died, and offered its sympathies.\"]","href_hash":"5f4889fa615711ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5f4889fa615711ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
