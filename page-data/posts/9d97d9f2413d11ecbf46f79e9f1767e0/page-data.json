Pet Portraits was announced in a company blog post Monday as a follow-up to Art Selfie, which allowed users to find their own art lookalike.\", \"\\\"When you take a photo in Pet Portraits, our trained computer vision algorithm recognizes where your pet is, crops the image and puts them where they belong: front and center,\\\" Google said. \\\"Once that is done, a machine learning algorithm matches your pet's photo with over tens of thousands of artworks from our partners' outstanding collections to find the ones that look most similar.\\\"\", \"Users need to install the Google Arts & Culture app to use Pet Portraits.
