In recent years, powerful tornadoes have been preceded by warnings 97 percent of the time.\", \"Yet despite the advances in forecasting, tornadoes that strike continue to have deadly consequences \\u2014 whether because of poor decisions, weak construction or just bad luck. The storms that hit on Friday and Saturday left at least 88 people dead in five states.\", \"\\u201cPeople got the warning but we are still left with the question of why people died,\\u201d said Stephen M. Strader, a professor at Villanova University who studies disasters. \\u201cSomething else failed them.\\u201d\", \"Unlike hurricanes, tornado warnings come with a much shorter lead time: around 15 to 18 minutes on average. Friday\\u2019s tornadoes had better-than-usual warning times, in some cases three times as long.\", \"But when tornadoes strike at night, as they did last week, residents are more likely to miss the warnings. Tornadoes at night are 2.5 times as likely to result in fatalities, research shows.\", \"The tornado that ravaged western Kentucky was a monster, an EF-3 storm with winds of 136 to 165 miles per hour. With a footprint of up to three-quarters of a mile wide, it shredded warehouses and houses along a path of more than 220 miles.\", \"The drumbeat of warnings began days before, with reports by the national Storm Prediction Center that tornadoes were quite likely.\", \"\\u201cIt was kind of a no-brainer as far as issuing a warning goes,\\u201d said Michael York, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service in Paducah, Ky. \\u201cIt was one of those that is impossible to miss if you have any training at all.\\u201d\", \"But while many Kentucky residents sought shelter where they could find it, others elected to remain in their homes or report to work. Some said they were not sure how seriously to take the dire predictions, or did not think the storm would hit their neighborhood.\", \"At a time when the incidence of extreme weather and natural threats \\u2014 hurricanes, wildfires, floods \\u2014 seems to be rising, the availability of so much data on storms and tornadoes can be overwhelming.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s definitely the potential to be getting too much information,\\u201d said Alex Anderson-Frey, a professor at the University of Washington who studies the efficiency of tornado warnings.\", \"In Mayfield, Katrina Spradling became deeply worried about the likelihood of tornadoes as she watched the weather forecast all day on Friday; her phone buzzed with alerts and messages on the severity of the storms. She urged her father, Bobby Spradling Jr., whose home on the outskirts of Mayfield did not have a secure place to shelter, to come take cover at her home about 10 minutes away. But Mr. Spradling stayed home.\", \"He was found dead on Saturday morning. The authorities told his family that based on where they found his body, they believed he had tried to leave his home and get to shelter when it was too late.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m shaken and have never seen anything like this,\\u201d Ms. Spradling said of the damage to Mayfield. \\u201cWe talked off and on about creating a shelter, but we never did. I wish we had.\\u201d\", \"Even some of those who may have taken the warnings seriously ended up being killed in Friday\\u2019s tornadoes for a variety of reasons: because their homes were not strong enough to resist the tremendous force of the wind, because their employers kept them in an unsafe building, because they made poor decisions such as going outside.\", \"Research by Harold Brooks, a senior research scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\\u2019s National Severe Storms Laboratory, shows that about 2 percent of people whose homes are directly struck by a powerful tornado are killed, roughly the same odds of dying after being infected with the coronavirus.\", \"Mr. Brooks, who lives in Oklahoma, has an 8-foot by 5-foot tornado shelter in his house that doubles as a walk-in closet. It has six-inch-thick reinforced concrete walls and a steel door. \\u201cThat thing is not going anywhere, in any wind on the planet,\\u201d he said.\", \"But not everyone has the foresight, the time or the funds to build such a shelter.\", \"Greg Simons described his mother\\u2019s home in Dawson Springs, Ky., as small and comfortable but not the safest place to ride out a tornado. If he had spoken with her before the storm, he would have forced her to leave the house, he said. His stepsister, Brandy Wiser, said she talked with their mother, Jennifer Ann Bruce, five minutes before the storm hit.\", \"\\u201cI asked if she was OK and she said she was in the hall, safe,\\u201d Ms. Wiser said. \\u201cI said just be safe and call me when it\\u2019s over. Five minutes later, I tried to call her back and it went straight to voice mail. I kept calling.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Bruce\\u2019s body was found by a neighbor on Saturday morning.\", \"Experts say the United States has reached a point where the technology to predict tornadoes is no longer the main obstacle to saving lives.\", \"The huge strides in tornado prediction rates have been made possible by a cascade of scientific advances. The introduction of Doppler radar in the 1990s and subsequent upgrades allowed forecasters to measure the wind inside of a storm, to distinguish between rain, snow or hail and to see and predict the formation of tornadoes. The proliferation of weather satellites allows scientists even more visibility into the formation of storms \\u2014 and, crucially, the conditions that might create a tornado. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration operates 16 satellites.\", \"The deluge of data from these technologies is crunched and modeled in real time by some of the world\\u2019s most powerful supercomputers.\", \"\\u201cIn many ways the tornado warning system \\u2014 and everything that leads up to it \\u2014 is one of the most incredible success stories in applied science,\\u201d Mr. Brooks said. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t miss violent tornadoes essentially ever now.\\u201d\", \"Before Doppler was deployed to predict tornadoes, the best the authorities could do was rely on a more primitive form of radar and a small army of weather spotters communicating by ham radio.\", \"The consequences of the leaps in technology have been clear, researchers say.\", \"\\u201cTornado fatality rates have dropped off the map,\\u201d Mr. Strader, the Villanova professor, said.\", \"Research by Mr. Strader shows that the number of people killed by tornadoes in the United States decreased steadily from 1920, when there were 2.3 fatalities per one million people, to 1990, when there were .25 fatalities per million. Experts say lives were saved not only by the technology that helps predict tornadoes but by better education and building codes.\", \"In the wake of last week\\u2019s tornadoes, a number of scientists have made comparisons to a similar event nearly a century ago to illustrate how awareness of a coming danger saves lives.\", \"In 1925, when the best the authorities could do was send warnings by telegraph, a tornado traveled across parts of Missouri, Illinois and Indiana for about 220 miles \\u2014 similar to the distance traveled by the biggest of the tornadoes that struck on Friday.\", \"The 1925 tornado killed nearly 700 people, about 10 times the death toll of Friday\\u2019s worst disaster.\"]","href_hash":"9f1bf5145d4011ecada08d1a54dd2ca2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9f1bf5145d4011ecada08d1a54dd2ca2"}},
