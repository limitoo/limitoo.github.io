Previously the booster shot was available only for health care workers, those at high risk of severe Covid and people 65 and above. Approximately 19 million people are affected by the new announcement, Mr. V\\u00e9ran said.\", \"Some adults who have not received a booster shot within seven months of their second injection will see their passes expire, barring access to restaurants, museums, long-distance trains and other public places unless they get tested regularly, Mr. V\\u00e9ran said.\", \"He said that over 400,000 vaccination appointments had been booked on Wednesday, ahead of his news conference.\", \"About 70 percent of the population is fully vaccinated. But the number of new daily cases has spiked recently to about 30,000 over the past few days, according to French officials, and have reached the prime minister. The recent surge has led to the closure of 8,500 school classes, up from 4,100 last week.\", \"Jean-Michel Blanquer, France\\u2019s education minister, announced at the news conference that classes would no longer close if one student tests positive, but that they will require that all students continue to be tested.
