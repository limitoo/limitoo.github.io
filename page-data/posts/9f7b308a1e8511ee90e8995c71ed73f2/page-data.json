President Joe Biden defends it as necessary with Ukraine running out of ammunition in its offensive against Russia, a move bound to be a tense talking point among leaders in Vilnius later in the week.\", \"Hipkins said New Zealand remained \\\"opposed to cluster munitions acquisition, our position there has been well set out and we've expressed to the US through diplomatic channels our opposition to the use of cluster munitions\\\".\", \"\\\"They're indiscriminate and they cause huge damage to innocent people potentially and they can have a long lasting effect ... where unexploded cluster munitions can cause long-term damage to innocent people.\\\"\", \"It is an objection Hipkins said he would raise with Zelensky if they had the opportunity to speak at Vilnius later this week.\", \"In the days between his visit to China and leaving for Europe, Hipkins delivered his first major foreign speech, describing the United States (a founding member of NATO) as \\\"our long-standing friend and partner\\\".
