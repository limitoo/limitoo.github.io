Philip D. Murphy, a first-term Democrat, fought to hold on to his seat in the face of a fierce challenge from his Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli.\", \"At about 12:30 a.m., both candidates took the stages at their election-night parties to tell supporters that the results of the contest would not be clear until all provisional and vote-by-mail ballots were counted.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re all sorry that tonight could not yet be the celebration that we wanted it to be,\\u201d said Mr. Murphy, surrounded by his family in Asbury Park\\u2019s Convention Hall. \\u201cBut as I said: When every vote is counted \\u2014 and every vote will be counted \\u2014 we hope to have a celebration again.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Ciattarelli, 59, said much the same thing, but appeared far more relaxed after outperforming every public opinion poll conducted during the campaign in a state where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 1.1 million voters.\", \"\\u201cWe have sent a message to the entire country,\\u201d Mr. Ciattarelli told supporters gathered in Bridgewater. \\u201cBut this is what I love about this state, if you study its history: Every single time it\\u2019s gone too far off track, the people of this state have pushed, pulled and prodded it right back to where it needs to be.\\u201d\", \"At 4 a.m., the candidates remained in a statistical dead heat, with about 12 percent of votes still uncounted.\", \"Regardless of who wins, the razor-thin margin has made clear just how divided voters are about the tough policies Mr. Murphy imposed to control the spread of the coronavirus, and his liberal agenda on taxation, climate change and racial equity.\", \"Mr. Murphy, a wealthy former Goldman Sachs executive and ambassador to Germany, had campaigned on the unabashedly left-leaning agenda he pushed through during this first term.\", \"But the defining issue of the campaign was the pandemic, which has killed about 28,000 residents, hobbled much of the region\\u2019s economy and disrupted the education of 1.3 million public school students.\", \"Mr. Murphy was one of the last governors to repeal an indoor mask mandate and among the first to require teachers to be vaccinated or submit to regular testing\", \"Mr. Ciattarelli, a former assemblyman, made Mr. Murphy\\u2019s strict pandemic edicts a centerpiece of his campaign. The Republican opposed Covid-19 vaccine mandates and mandatory masking in schools, and he blamed Mr. Murphy\\u2019s early lockdown orders for hurting small businesses and keeping students out of school for too long.\"]","href_hash":"fb576aa43c8c11ec84d5000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fb576aa43c8c11ec84d5000017025a03"}},
