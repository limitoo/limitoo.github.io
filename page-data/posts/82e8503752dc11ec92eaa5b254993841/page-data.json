Abual-Ragheb sought to delay her sentence until January 1 so she could move to a new home and \\\"handle her holiday obligations as a mother to her children.\\\"\", \"The government opposed delaying her sentence and Judge Carl Nichols denied her request. Nichols noted that the conditions of Abual-Ragheb's probation doesn't bar her from seeking a new residence during her period of home detention.\", \"Abual-Ragheb pleaded guilty to one count of parading, demonstrating or picketing in a Capitol building. Prosecutors pushed for a sentence of 30 days in jail because of her \\\"violent rhetoric\\\" before, during and after the January 6 riot.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943445/rasha-abual-capitol-riot-sentence-holidays.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Rasha Abual-Ragheb, who pleaded guilty to her role in the Capitol riot, had her request to have her sentence delayed until after the holidays denied.

After her arrest, her children were \\\"ostracized and bullied at school,\\\" according to court filings, so she started to home-school them.\", \"While prosecutors acknowledged that her having sole custody of the kids leaned in favor of a sentence that would keep her out of prison, they argued that jail time was needed to deter future behavior.\", \"During her sentencing hearing, Nichols said he found she was genuinely remorseful and that he had \\\"every expectation\\\" that she will not protest in the Capitol again or commit other crimes. But, he agreed with prosecutors that there needed to be a deterrent so he doubled the amount of probation that was recommended.\"]","href_hash":"82e8503752dc11ec92eaa5b254993841"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"82e8503752dc11ec92eaa5b254993841"}},
