The rescue operation drew volunteers from around the world and was covered in-depth by the broadcast and print media. Vasarhelyi and Chin incorporate some of that coverage into \\u201cThe Rescue,\\u201d alongside new interviews with the rescue team, for a fuller view into what happened. But their primary focus is on what the divers experienced as they tried to puzzle out how to navigate through underground passages and how to extract survivors. The P.O.V. footage the divers shot themselves is often harrowing, capturing the claustrophobic pressure and the sense of panic that sets in when the waters rise.\", \"\\u2018The Book of Boba Fett\\u2019\", \"Starts streaming: Dec. 29\", \"There are no new \\u201cThe Mandalorian\\u201d episodes until 2022, so fans of the \\u201cStar Wars\\u201d universe\\u2019s bounty-hunter subculture will have to rely on this spinoff series to tide them over. Temuera Morrison reprises his role as Boba Fett, a storied mercenary who, alongside his colleague Fennec Shand (Ming-Na Wen), comes out of hiding and attempts to reestablish himself as someone to be feared and respected in the criminal underworld. A lot of the \\u201cMandalorian\\u201d creative team also worked on \\u201cThe Book of Boba Fett,\\u201d as did some of the supporting cast. This promises to be another action-packed throwback adventure series, exploring the difficult lives and the complicated ethical codes of characters whose jobs demand danger and violence.\", \"Also arriving:\", \"Dec. 3\", \"\\u201cDiary of a Wimpy Kid\\u201d\", \"Dec. 8\", \"\\u201cWelcome to Earth\\u201d\", \"Dec. 15\", \"\\u201cFoodtastic,\\u201d Season 1\", \"Dec. 17\", \"\\u201cArendelle Castle Yule Log: Cut Paper Edition\\u201d\", \"\\u2018It\\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia,\\u2019 Season 15\", \"Starts streaming: Dec. 2\", \"The longest-running sitcom in television history returns for a new season. As usual, it will combine the show\\u2019s lowlife high jinks with some episodes that directly engage with what\\u2019s going on in the world today. For example, the season\\u2019s first episode is about how the gang at Paddy\\u2019s Pub \\u2014 Mac, Charlie, Dennis, Dee and Frank \\u2014 try to make money off the pandemic. And episode two comments on the sometimes reckless political incorrectness of some older \\u201cIt\\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\\u201d jokes. The series continues on from there, filtering reality through the skewed perspective of characters who hardly every change, even as society keeps shifting all around them.\", \"Also arriving:\", \"Dec. 1\", \"\\u201cCandified: Home for the Holidays,\\u201d Season 1\", \"Dec. 2\", \"\\u201cGodfather of Harlem,\\u201d Season 1\", \"Dec. 3\", \"\\u201cThe New York Times Presents: To Live and Die in Alabama\\u201d\", \"\\u201cPEN15,\\u201d Season 2, Part 2\", \"\\u201cTrolls: Holiday in Harmony\\u201d\", \"Dec. 9\", \"\\u201cBloods,\\u201d Season 1\", \"\\u201cCreamerie,\\u201d Season 1\", \"\\u201cSwan Song\\u201d\", \"Dec. 10\", \"\\u201cCrossing Swords,\\u201d Season 2\", \"Dec. 16\", \"\\u201cDead Asleep\\u201d\", \"Dec. 17\", \"\\u201cMother/Android\\u201d\", \"Dec. 23\", \"\\u201cDragons: The Nine Realms\\u201d Season 1\", \"Dec. 26\", \"\\u201cLetterkenny\\u201d Season 10\", \"\\u2018Being the Ricardos\\u2019\", \"Starts streaming: Dec. 21\", \"The writer-director Aaron Sorkin follows up his American history lesson \\u201cThe Trial of the Chicago 7\\u201d with another look back into our cultural past, this time exploring the world of television in its infancy as a mass medium.

Gorelick is a disarming interview subject, willing to defend himself but seemingly unconcerned about his critical reputation.

They spun the character off into a strange 2010 movie that has a fiercely devoted cult of fans; now they\\u2019re bringing MacGruber back to TV as a serialized action-adventure spoof, with the hero returning to work after a decade in prison.
