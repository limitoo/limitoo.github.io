That if we got it we would be intimidatory and naughty to people and undermine the vaccine progress and a breach of privacy and the rest, he was struck down, on what we would call the p\\u0101keh\\u0101tanga.\\\" Tamihere said.\", \"In the letter, Bloomfield said that Rangit\\u0101ne T\\u016b Mai R\\u0101 and Ng\\u0101ti Kahungunu ki Wairarapa Tamaki nui-a-Rua expressed opposition to data sharing with WOCA and have requested this data through their Ko Wairarapa T\\u0113nei Collective.\", \"He said that only 98 more M\\u0101ori individuals in Wairarapa need to be vaccinated in order to achieve 90 percent first vaccination rate for M\\u0101ori in the area.\", \"\\\"This achievement has been as a result of Ko Wairarapa T\\u0113nei Collective efforts to increase their vaccination rates,\\\" Bloomfield said.\", \"He said that in agreeing to share the data with WOCA, his expectation is for WOCA to work closely with iwi on the ground to ensure efforts are coordinated and considerate of community mahi.\", \"He also agreed to provide WOCA and Wh\\u0101nau Tahi with data relating to M\\u0101ori living in the Lakes DHB area, who have not yet had a first dose of a Covid vaccine but excluding data for the people of Ng\\u0101ti Tar\\u0101whai Iwi Trust Board.\", \"\\\"This iwi has entered into a data-matching agreement with the ministry to have its data excluded from the dataset shared with WOCA,\\\" Bloomfield said.\", \"\\\"This data matching exercise is underway, and only wh\\u0101nau who live within the Lakes DHB boundary will be excluded as part of the data matching. I understand this approach is acceptable to you, as communicated by your lawyer on 7 December,\\\" Bloomfield stated in the letter.\", \"Bloomfield will provide WOCA and Wh\\u0101nau Tahi with data relating to M\\u0101ori living in the Bay of Plenty DHB area who have not yet had a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.\", \"He notes opposition from five iwi in the area to data sharing with WOCA.\", \"Ng\\u0101i Tai Iwi Authority has requested an arrangement similar to what has been agreed in relation to Ng\\u0101ti Whatua Orakei.\", \"\\\"Where WOCA commissioned providers identify that a person is affiliated with Ng\\u0101i Tai Iwi Authority, it will: inform Ng\\u0101itai Iwi Authority that the provider has been in contact with the person or wh\\u0101nau, the result of that contact and the relevant information so that Ng\\u0101itai Iwi Authority can decide whether to follow-up with the wh\\u0101nau and seek to engage with them based on their connections and relationships.\", \"\\\"I anticipate that other iwi may request similar arrangements, and propose that WOCA and the ministry agree to work in good faith to agree similar arrangements in the event that any other iwi seeks a bespoke data sharing arrangement akin to what is reflected for Ng\\u0101ti Whatua \\u014crakei,\\\" Bloomfield stated.\", \"WOCA also had a second request for the Ministry of Health to disclose data for purposes of reaching M\\u0101ori who have had a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, but who have not yet had a second dose.\", \"The request is for this data for all people who identified as M\\u0101ori in the health datasets, and who live in the North Island. The data would include their name, personal contact details, phone number and NHI.\", \"The ministry had previously offered to provide this dataset for the purposes of reaching M\\u0101ori who have not yet recieved their second dose of Covid-19 vaccine, including individuals who have no future vaccine booking for their second vaccine and it has been eight weeks or more since their first vaccine.\", \"Bloomfield has agreed to provide WOCA and Wh\\u0101nau Tahi with data relating to M\\u0101ori in the North Island who have had a first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, but who have not yet had a second dose, in the following tranches:\", \"At 3-4 weeks following a first dose of vaccine, who are not enrolled with a primary care provider and do not have a booking.\", \"At 6 weeks following a first dose of vaccine, including those who are enrolled with another primary care provider and who do not have a booking for a second dose.\", \"Bloomfield said this is because people who are enrolled with a provider often have an established relationship with that provider.\", \"\\\"Many providers will be using their own systems and processes to follow-up and arrange for a second dose of vaccine,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We consider it important to reduce the potential for M\\u0101ori to receive multiple phone calls from multiple service providers, including Whakarongorau, Wh\\u0101nau Ora, as well as their own primary healthcare provider. Our expectation is that you will use this data to assist M\\u0101ori to access a second dose of vaccine.\\\"\", \"The Director-General also set out some arrangements in the letter.\", \"\\\"As you are aware, a number of iwi across Te Ika a M\\u0101ui remain opposed to the sharing of people's individual-level data with WOCA. A range of reasons have been expressed for this including that individual consent should be sought from those individuals who may be contacted from WOCA and that iwi have a legitimate interest in the protection of the data relating to their people and those living in their takiw\\u0101.\", \"\\\"The data being requested is M\\u0101ori data, further M\\u0101ori data is subject to the rights articulated in the Treaty of Waitangi and the UN Declaration on the rights of Indigenous peoples,\\\" Bloomfield said.\", \"He proposes that the data sharing agreement between the organistions include that data provided may only be used to support Covid-19 vaccination service planning, monitoring, invitation, delivery and quality improvement for M\\u0101ori who are not fully vaccinated.\", \"Bloomfield has an expectation they will work with WOCA providers, relevant iwi and other providers to coordinate out-reach and support access to Covid-19 vaccinations for M\\u0101ori who are not fully vaccinated; to have clear answer when people people who are contacted ask where the provider got their details and how they know the person is unvaccinated; WOCA will delete information relating to anyone who advises they do not want their data to be held by the applicant; and the data supplied is to be retained until no later than 30 June 2022, after that date the information is to be securely destroyed.\"]","href_hash":"647901c65acb11ec80cabb8325e56afc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"647901c65acb11ec80cabb8325e56afc"}},
