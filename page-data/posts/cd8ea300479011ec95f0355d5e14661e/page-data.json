Dr. Kessler, who has been working on the proposal for months, estimated it at \\u201cseveral billion.\\u201d The money has been set aside as part of the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package that Mr. Biden signed into law in March.\", \"The Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Agency intends to issue a \\u201crequest for information\\u201d to solicit ideas from companies that have experience manufacturing vaccines using mRNA technology. Mr. Zients said that officials wanted responses \\u201cin a very short period of time, 30 days, to understand how most efficiently, effectively and reliably we can increase manufacturing.\\u201d\", \"Activists, many of them veterans of the AIDS epidemic, have been demanding for months that Mr. Biden do more to scale up global vaccine manufacturing capacity. Some, furious with what they regard as the administration\\u2019s slow progress, turned up at the home of Ron Klain, Mr. Biden\\u2019s chief of staff, in September and deposited a fake mountain of bones on the sidewalk in protest.\", \"At the same time, the administration is offering booster shots to millions of vaccinated Americans, despite criticism from World Health Organization officials and other experts who say the doses should go to low- and lower-middle-income countries first. The Food and Drug Administration is aiming to authorize booster doses of Pfizer-BioNTech\\u2019s Covid vaccine for all adults as early as Thursday, according to people familiar with the agency\\u2019s plans.\", \"Whether the new Biden plan will satisfy the administration\\u2019s critics is unclear. Many activists have demanded that the administration build up manufacturing capacity overseas, particularly in Africa, but the Biden plan is focused on building capacity among domestic vaccine makers.\", \"\\u201cThis effort is specifically aimed at building U.S. domestic capacity,\\u201d Dr. Kessler said. \\u201cBut that capacity is important not only for the U.S. supply, but for global supply.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"cd8ea300479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cd8ea300479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}},
