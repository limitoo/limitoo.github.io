Thorp\", \"Perhaps you know the story of \\u201cKing Lear.\\u201d\", \"The old king, on the verge of madness, decides to split his kingdom among his three daughters, giving the largest share to the daughter who most obsequiously declares her love for him. His youngest, Cordelia, refuses to participate in the absurd affair. What ensues is a tragedy of almost comic proportions in which nearly everybody dies.\", \"Missing almost entirely is the mother of King Lear\\u2019s children, the queen.\", \"It\\u2019s the queen\\u2019s tale that the librettist J. R. Thorp tells with her debut novel, \\u201cLearwife.\\u201d In luscious prose, Thorp explores the nameless queen\\u2019s untold story, one that \\u2014 in keeping with the spirit of Shakespeare\\u2019s original \\u2014 is rife with cruelty, betrayal and passion. Thorp\\u2019s queen has been sequestered in a remote abbey for 15 years, after Lear banished her following Cordelia\\u2019s birth. Queen (as she is called by all) is never told why she is exiled, and she has stewed over this punishment, letting her rage fester.\", \"When Queen receives the news that her husband and three children are dead, the cold, aloof shell she has hidden within for over a decade cracks. Out spills a power-hungry, resentful, desperate version of her pre-exile self, one who we learn was bent on accruing authority. By day at the abbey, Queen gleefully creates interpersonal drama among the nuns while catastrophe strikes \\u2014 a deadly contagion forces the abbey into quarantine. By night, she\\u2019s haunted by her memories of her marriage to Lear and her troubled relationships with her elder daughters, Regan and Goneril. As she inches closer to the truth of why she was exiled, so too does she approach the same madness that overtook Lear and Lear\\u2019s father, as well as Queen\\u2019s first husband, an uncaring king obsessed with religion.\", \"\\u201cLearwife\\u201d is gorgeously written, its language ornate and heady. Remembering the gossip of the court, Queen says: \\u201cI forget: I am not real, I am bound into a thousand songs, I am four parts legend to one part solid stone. This the fate of queens.\\u201d Thorp carefully embeds clues to Queen\\u2019s banishment within her alarming memories of her children. Regan and Goneril are unrepentant villains in the original \\u201cLear\\u201d \\u2014 heartless, greedy, lustful \\u2014 but Thorp poignantly illustrates how their eventual corruption stems from the treatment they received from their self-absorbed mother, whose ability to love her daughters was complicated by her fetish for power. Thorp doesn\\u2019t abandon the theme of greed in Shakespeare\\u2019s play, but she does flesh it out to reveal how desperate the women in \\u201cKing Lear\\u201d would have been for any scrap of agency in their lives. The novel\\u2019s scenes with Queen and her daughters are its most affecting; I wish Thorp had given us more.\", \"Instead, most of the story takes place in the abbey, where Queen descends into grief, becoming increasingly mired in memory as she skirts feelings of regret for her harsh treatment of her children. Though Thorp ratchets up the tension three-quarters of the way through, readers would have been better served if she had inserted more suspense among the stunning early descriptions of life at the abbey. Thorp applies subtle pressure when what the story needed, at times, was a firm shove.\", \"But the novel\\u2019s crest and denouement are artful and moving. \\u201cOne survives. Women find small spaces, bury themselves, show green when the season betters,\\u201d Queen muses early in the book. Though her survival is not what she had envisioned, it\\u2019s a beautiful triumph nonetheless.\"]","href_hash":"b25719c3574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b25719c3574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}},
