By the end of the day, their child was dead. Harris forgot to drop off his son at day care, and instead drove to work, leaving Cooper in the back seat, where the child died in the Georgia heat.\", \"This year, 23 children have died in hot cars, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.
