A version of the draft, published by the Catholic newsletter, The Pillar, does not mention Biden or any politician by name, but states that \\\"people who exercise some form of public authority have a special responsibility to embody the church.\\\" It says Catholics who live in a state of \\\"mortal sin\\\" without repentance should not receive communion, but does not say who should sit in judgement.\", \"\\\"It was never the intention to target any individual or group of individuals,\\\" Bishop Michael Burbidge of Arlington, Virginia told reporters today. \\\"This is a document that is reaching out to all Catholics.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/133975/eight_col_000_9R7764.jpg?1637116138\\\" alt=\\\"US President Joe Biden departs the St Edmond Catholic Church Rehoboth Beach, Delaware last week.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nUS President Joe Biden departs the St Edmond Catholic Church Rehoboth Beach, Delaware last week. \\nPhoto: AFP\\n</div>\", \"Archbishop Jose Gomez, the conference president, said he felt the document was \\\"absolutely necessary\\\" and intended \\\"to educate Catholics about the real presence of Jesus in the Eucharist.\\\"\", \"Some conservative bishops have argued the conference must rebuke politicians such as Biden who support abortion rights, given the church teaches that abortion is immoral.
