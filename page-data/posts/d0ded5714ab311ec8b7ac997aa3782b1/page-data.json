Biden Jr. won the Democratic presidential nomination, a group of progressive lawmakers rallied around him to project party unity at a critical time.\", \"More than a year later, as the president seeks to pass a robust spending package of social policies that represent the bulk of his domestic agenda, many of the same leaders are looking for a return on their political investment.\", \"In an interview with The New York Times, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, one of the country\\u2019s most prominent progressives, questioned whether Democratic leaders and the White House understood the scope of the demands coming from the party\\u2019s base. \", \"The interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.\", \"Why do you feel this social policy bill has to pass as soon as possible, at the biggest scale possible?\", \"I think the stakes are really, really high.\", \"The entire reason that the Progressive Caucus gave their votes [for the infrastructure bill] was based on direct promises from the president, as well as direct promises from more conservative Democratic holdouts. And from House leadership as well. So if those promises don\\u2019t follow through, it\\u2019s going to be very, very difficult for them to get votes on anything moving forward, because the trust that was already so delicate will have been broken.\", \"Do you think these extended negotiations and the stuff that was cut will have an electoral effect? Obviously the Senate will have its say, but if the spending bill largely looks like what the House passed this week, will Democrats say it fulfills the promise of Election Day?\", \"I think that if we pass the Build Back Better Act as the House passed it, that we have a shot to go back to our communities and say we delivered. But that\\u2019s not to say that this process has not been demoralizing for a lot of folks, because there were enormous promises made. Not just at the beginning, and not just during the election, but that continued to be made.\", \"And this is where I have sounded the alarm, because what really dampens turnout is when Democrats make promises that they don\\u2019t keep.\", \"With the bipartisan infrastructure plan, there\\u2019s all of these headlines going around. And I understand the political importance of making a victory lap. But I think that the worst and most vulnerable position we could be in is to over-promise and under-deliver.\", \"So let\\u2019s not go around and say, \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to replace every lead pipe in this country,\\u201d because according to the bipartisan infrastructure plan, that is not going to happen. That has not been funded. And if the Build Back Better Act gets cut even further, then that\\u2019s definitely not going to happen. \", \"You and other progressives backed Biden during the general election. Do you feel that this White House has continued to be open to the left?\", \" And that created trust, because trust requires vulnerability from all parties.\", \"There was some good faith with the American Rescue Plan [Democrats\\u2019 $1.9 trillion economic stimulus package, signed in March]. But after that, which was quite early, it\\u2019s been a bit of a slog.\", \"I actually don\\u2019t direct this critique directly at the White House. I think, in general, the party doesn\\u2019t quite fully grasp what is happening in deep-blue communities.\", \"What is it that you say they\\u2019re missing?\", \"The talking points are not enough.\", \"Yes, is child care great? Absolutely. Universal pre-K, this is something I\\u2019m deeply, deeply supportive of. But we also have too much of a top-down strategy when it comes to our base. We\\u2019re always giving them the medicine and telling them what they need to accept, as opposed to really monitoring where the energy is, and being responsive to it. And allowing that to shape our strategy.\", \"And even with the infrastructure plan, this kind of investment is deeply needed in underserved communities like the Bronx. However, if we as a party are asking every single person in this party to take a victory lap, and do a news conference in front of a bridge or pothole, and we aren\\u2019t funding and actually fixing that pothole, I\\u2019m very concerned about how people are going to interpret that a year from now.\", \"But doesn\\u2019t the White House agree \\u2014 didn\\u2019t it propose a more robust package? The obvious response here is that the administration faces the reality of a 50-50 Senate.\", \"There is an enormous amount of executive action that they\\u2019re sitting on that I think is underutilized. On student loans. We\\u2019ve got executive action on the table with respect to climate. There are certainly things that we can do with immigration.\", \"So why are we taking this as a legislative compromise, when the opportunity is so much greater, or when Biden could do this stuff with a stroke of a pen, and is just reminding us that he\\u2019s choosing not to?\", \"We always try to tell people why they need to settle for less, instead of being able to harness the energy of our grass roots and take political risks in service of them, the same way that we take political risks in service of swing voters. We can do both. \", \"Is this frustration a growing sentiment in the Democratic congressional caucus? Or is this just you?\", \"Frustration is there, and it\\u2019s part of why the Progressive Caucus was holding out on passing both of these two pieces of legislation together, because we\\u2019re like, listen, we\\u2019re not going to take these empty promises anymore.\", \"We went from the American Rescue Plan to six months of watching us just hand the pen to Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. If you even look at the [infrastructure bill], it was drafted in the Senate, and they didn\\u2019t even allow conferencing with the House version. They said you just need to take this legislation as is \\u2014 no compromises, no edits, nothing.\", \"You\\u2019ve got to give me something to work with, with my communities. And if you\\u2019re not, how can I make the argument that they should turn out again? And this notion that saying \\u201cWe\\u2019re not Trump\\u201d is enough \\u2014 this is such a deeply demoralizing message.\", \"Democrats have a trifecta and have been unable to pass voting-rights protections. And so people can wring their hands and say \\u201cbut Manchin\\u201d all they want, or \\u201cbut the filibuster\\u201d all they want, but at the end of the day, what people see are the results of their actions and the results of investing their time. \", \"We are up against political nihilism. The idea that nothing we do matters, because as long as I live in the Bronx, the political reality of this country is that no one\\u2019s going to fight for me. That is why it\\u2019s so important that we take some of these risks for our base.\", \"Your party is trying to project political victory at this moment \\u2014 and pulling out all the stops to do so. You\\u2019re sounding the alarm.\", \"Before the Virginia elections, it was very clear that our help and our participation was not wanted or asked for, which is fine. I\\u2019m not here to tell people how to run their races. But at the same time, to consider the members here that have some of the tightest relationships to our political base as just a uniform liability \\u2014 and not something that can be selectively deployed, or consulted, or anything \\u2014 I think it\\u2019s just sad. I think it was a mistake.\", \"And we saw a big youth turnout collapse. Not a single person asked me to send an email, not even to my own list. And then they turn around and say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s their fault.\\u201d When I think it was communicated quite expressly that we were unwelcome to pitch in.\", \"The idea that we just accept a collapse in youth turnout \\u2014 and essentially turn it into a self-fulfilling prophecy \\u2014 in times when races are decided by such narrow margin points: I think it\\u2019s ill advised.\"]","href_hash":"d0ded5714ab311ec8b7ac997aa3782b1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d0ded5714ab311ec8b7ac997aa3782b1"}},
