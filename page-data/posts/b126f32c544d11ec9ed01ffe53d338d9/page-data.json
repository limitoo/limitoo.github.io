It is fitting compensation for \\u201cone of the greatest pitchers of this or any generation,\\u201d as Steven A. Cohen, the Mets\\u2019 owner, called him on Wednesday. Cohen will support that belief by paying Scherzer a record annual salary of $43.3 million through 2024.\", \"Scherzer, as you might expect, thinks very highly of his new boss, who blew past Major League Baseball\\u2019s luxury-tax threshold to sign him. The other owners, almost all of whom act as if baseball has a salary cap, are the ones who bother him.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s a specific thing that we\\u2019re negotiating on right now: how teams view that as a cap and they won\\u2019t really spend too much over that, despite the penalties on that actually being pretty negligible, comparatively,\\u201d said Scherzer, who is part of the players\\u2019 union\\u2019s executive subcommittee, over Zoom from Irving, Texas. \\u201cSo to see Steve show the fortitude to be able to go past it, and show that he\\u2019s going to do whatever it takes to win, that\\u2019s music to my ears.\\u201d\", \"If it sounds off-key to hear talk of a labor war in an industry awash in cash \\u2014 well, as they say, that\\u2019s baseball. The first work stoppage since 1995 began just after midnight on Thursday with a lockout triggered by the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement.\", \"To the Mets, it all seems like a nuisance. Cohen, with an estimated net worth of more than $14 billion, is eager to get going in his second year as the owner of his favorite team. He did not care, he said, if his spending sent a message to the rest of the league.\", \"\\u201cI told you last year I wanted to win,\\u201d Cohen said. \\u201cI talked about sustained winning and winning championships \\u2014 and I meant it.\\u201d\", \"He added later: \\u201cI\\u2019m concerned about the New York Mets, and I\\u2019m concerned about the fan base. I feel like I made a commitment to them, and I want to deliver on that.\\u201d\", \"Scherzer, 37, is only the latest pitcher to stop in Queens on his way to Cooperstown. Tom Glavine had 242 victories and two Cy Young Awards when he signed as a free agent with the Mets in December 2002. Pedro Martinez had 182 wins and three Cy Young Awards when he did so two years later.\", \"Both pitchers were well into their 30s and would have some highlights with the Mets. But neither would ever appear on another Cy Young ballot or lift the Mets to the World Series. Scherzer, who has 190 wins and three Cy Youngs, understands he must do more.\", \"\\u201cThe pressure of this is a privilege, it\\u2019s not a problem,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI really enjoy being where you\\u2019re expected to win, and that\\u2019s what we\\u2019re here to do. That\\u2019s my job and I love doing it.\\u201d\", \"The Mets lost starter Marcus Stroman on Wednesday \\u2014 he tweeted that he had signed with the Chicago Cubs \\u2014 but upgraded significantly with Scherzer, who, at least for the moment, is the only pitcher in major league history with more than 3,000 strikeouts and fewer than 700 walks. Scherzer will team up with Jacob deGrom for a top of the rotation that inspires awe, even among teammates.\", \"\\u201cI haven\\u2019t seen Max or Jacob pitch, actually, ever, in person,\\u201d said Mark Canha, the former Oakland outfielder, who signed a two-year, $26.5 million deal with the Mets this week. \\u201cI\\u2019m very excited to witness their greatness and see their routines, see how they go about their business in the clubhouse. I feel ready to get inspired by that.\\u201d\", \"DeGrom, 33, missed the second half of last season with an injured elbow. Scherzer was also unavailable at the end of the season, wearing down in the National League Championship Series for the Los Angeles Dodgers after a heavy workload in the early rounds.\", \"\\u201cI overcooked my arm for a situation,\\u201d Scherzer said, referring to his save to clinch a division series in San Francisco. \\u201cI went past my work capacity, what I was built up for. Unfortunately, that happened. I didn\\u2019t foresee that happening, but it did. But from a long-term standpoint, a structural standpoint, a health standpoint, I\\u2019m ready to go.\\u201d\", \"In the regular season Scherzer worked 179 \\u2153 innings, a total that would have led the Mets. He was good enough in the first half to start the All-Star Game, and got even better after a trade from Washington to the Dodgers in late July, going 7-0 with a 1.98 earned run average. Overall, Scherzer was 15-4 with a career-low 2.46 E.R.A. and 0.864 WHIP (walks plus hits per inning pitched), which led the majors.\", \"For Scherzer, the Mets\\u2019 deal fit for his family and underscored his sense of brotherhood to fellow players. He and his wife have three young children and live in Jupiter, Fla., near the Mets\\u2019 spring training complex in Port St. Lucie. Scherzer also smashed the previous record for average annual salary \\u2014 $36 million for Yankees pitcher Gerrit Cole, also represented by Scott Boras \\u2014 in keeping with his history of fighting for value.\", \"Scherzer was the last first-round pick from his 2006 draft class to sign, joining an independent league team before getting a major league deal from Arizona worth $4.3 million. He was dealt to Detroit, where he won his first Cy Young Award and turned down a $144 million contract extension. The decision paid off when the Nationals gave Scherzer $210 million as a free agent.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve been a big beneficiary of many players before me going out and fighting for those deals and fighting for those extra years,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat gives me the position to continue that fight. I\\u2019m happy to do it and hopefully that helps out future players as well.\\u201d\", \"It is not a sacrifice, of course, to sign a three-year, $130 million contract to play for a highly motivated owner in an ideal location. The system has worked well for Scherzer, but the sport, he believes, is not as healthy as it should be. No other owner may spend like Cohen, but more should make a better effort to win.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re trying to make the game more competitive, through various means,\\u201d Scherzer said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s so many different ways as players, as a whole, that we believe we can make the game better. And we\\u2019re absolutely committed to doing that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b126f32c544d11ec9ed01ffe53d338d9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b126f32c544d11ec9ed01ffe53d338d9"}},
