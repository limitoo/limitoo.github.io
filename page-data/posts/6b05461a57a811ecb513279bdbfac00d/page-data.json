other countries, those other countries that have very different land-use change elements sitting in inventory, so if you're comparing,\\u00a0for example, Singapore and Australia, clearly it's a bit of

science at the University of Melbourne's School of Geography, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, and a lead author of the IPCC's sixth assessment report, told Fact Check the \\\"main time series\\\"

starting year.\", \"The year 2005, as chosen by Mr Morrison, is a year which advantages Australia.\", \"Professor Howden noted that emissions that year were slightly under the peak of Australia's emissions.\", \"Choosing a starting year of 1990, which is where the UNFCCC data begins, yields a different result.\", \"\\\"The best base year to use for international comparisons is 1990, as this is the year in which most countries start their emissions accounts,\\\" Ms Reeve said.\", \"\\\"However, any base year has its problems \\u2014 there's an argument that 1990 provided an advantage for the EU and Russia because the collapse of heavy industry in the USSR and Eastern Bloc in the early \\u201890s delivered an emissions dividend without any government policy.\\\"\", \"Below, Fact Check has
