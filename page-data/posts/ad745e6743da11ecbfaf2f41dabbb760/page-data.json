We watch this cable news show or that one. We live on one side of the tracks or the other. We scowl at the unmasked parent at the playground or the parent wearing the N95-face-shield combo. Sometimes it seems we are so consumed with what separates us, what counts as a political or ideological win or loss, we forget to celebrate all that we have in common. Not even a global pandemic has changed this. Thankfully, four wonderful new picture books have come along that artfully acknowledge the impact of barriers but ultimately shine their light on the power of compassion, generosity and community.\", \"\\u201cBright Star,\\u201d which might be the Caldecott honoree Yuyi Morales\\u2019s best book yet, opens with an omniscient parental narrator proclaiming, \\u201cChild, you are awake. Breathe in, then breathe out, hermosa creatura. You are alive!\\u201d\", \"We see a fawn curled in a ball, eyes just having opened to a new life. When it stands in the next spread, Mom is there with a loving gesture that sets in motion a profound journey, told in a pleasing blend of Spanish and English, through the wonders of a desert landscape. Make no mistake, there are dangers here. But in the midst of darkness the fawn is encouraged to \\u201cShout it loud! Let the world know how you feel!\\u201d In the accompanying art, it butts up against a menacing wall topped with barbed wire.\", \"The critique is obvious, but Morales resists moral lecturing. Instead, she focuses on what positive new story might bloom in such a complicated context. In an especially stirring sequence, the fawn, staring directly at the reader, is replaced by a young girl, who also stares at the reader. On the following page she is joined by several other humans of varying ages. Morales dares us to look away, dares us not to acknowledge their humanity. \\u201cBright Star,\\u201d which was simultaneously published in an all-Spanish version called \\u201cLucero,\\u201d does what very few picture books can do: captivate a child while moving the adult who is reading to her.\", \"We encounter a physical barrier again in \\u201cMy Two Border Towns,\\u201d beautifully written by David Bowles, with vibrant illustrations by Erika Meza. In this case, however, our unnamed child narrator is able to pass through the border with little difficulty, because he and his father have U.S. passports, \\u201ccards that give us the freedom to travel back and forth.\\u201d\", \"While the setting in \\u201cBright Star\\u201d is never specifically stated, in \\u201cMy Two Border Towns\\u201d we know that the main character lives with his family in Texas, and that every other Saturday he and his father travel to \\u201cel Otro Lado\\u201d to run errands. Just before the border checkpoint, our narrator is reminded that \\u201cCoahuiltecans once lived here, before all this was Mexico \\u2014 both riverbanks.\\u201d Now there are two countries and they must pay to cross. This sets up one of the central themes of the book, handled masterfully by both Bowles and Meza. The working-class neighborhoods on either side of the border are mirror images of each other. Spanish is the predominant language. The streets are teeming with life and there is a powerful sense of community. Father and son are just as at home in Mexico \\u2014 grabbing breakfast at a favorite restaurant, weaving through vendor stalls, playing soccer in a vacant lot, picking up various items from local shops.\", \"This alone would make for an evocative and relevant story, but Bowles has one final turn for us. As the father and son are waiting to cross back into America, we discover that one of the purposes of their trip is to provide goods for refugee families from the Caribbean and Central America \\u2014 people who are stuck between countries. Our narrator hops out of the idling car and visits with his friends, sharing comics and foods and medicines. The story closes with his longing for a day when they can pass back and forth between countries the way he can. \\u201cMy Two Border Towns\\u201d is a sophisticated, heartfelt look at what life is like in the shadow of the border.\", \"In \\u201cThe Welcome Chair,\\u201d written by Rosemary Wells and illustrated by Jerry Pinkney, who died in October, the camera is pulled back so that we can take a more comprehensive, generational look at immigration in America. This is a wildly ambitious story, inspired by Wells\\u2019s own family legends, as well as by her immigrant father\\u2019s belief that \\u201cAmerica\\u2019s door is open to suffering people from foreign lands.\\u201d\", \"In the early 1800s, Wells\\u2019s great-great-grandfather, a woodworker, leaves Bavaria to escape mounting pressure to become a rabbi like his father and grandfather. After arriving in New York, he finds work as a bookkeeper and an apprentice carpenter. When he makes a cherrywood rocking chair for his employers\\u2019 new child, carving the German word \\u201cWillkommen\\u201d into it, the story commences.\", \"As we watch the welcome chair pass from family to family, it becomes the backbone of the narrative, accompanied by vignettes exploring different communities and the fabric of America. Along the way, the word \\u201cwelcome\\u201d is carved into the chair in many different languages, including Hebrew, English, Irish, Spanish and Haitian Creole. But it\\u2019s Pinkney\\u2019s intricate watercolor illustrations that truly bring the chair, the characters and an ever-changing America to life.\", \"While \\u201cThe Welcome Chair\\u201d casts a wide geographic and temporal net \\u2014 which can sometimes leave readers feeling spread thin \\u2014 the stunning \\u201cDream Street,\\u201d written by Tricia Elam Walker and illustrated by Ekua Holmes, focuses on a single avenue in a special neighborhood. We get to know this dynamic Black community by getting to know some of the people who live on Dream Street.\", \"There\\u2019s stylish Mr. Sidney, a former mail carrier, who spends his mornings reading the newspaper on his stoop. He \\u201ctips his big brown fedora and greets everyone with, \\u2018Don\\u2019t wait to have a great day. Create one.\\u2019\\u201d There\\u2019s quiet Zion, a boy who spends his days in the library working his way through \\u201cskyscraper-tall piles of books that take him on adventures around the world.\\u201d He dreams of becoming a librarian. The Phillips family has five boys, all named after jazz musicians. On Sundays before church, their father \\u201clines them up on the front porch for inspection, from hats down to shined shoes.\\u201d\", \"Walker\\u2019s poetic text dances across the page and Holmes\\u2019s striking collage portraits are filled with joy. Simply put, \\u201cDream Street\\u201d is a triumph. Like the street itself, this book is a place where a child reader, or any reader, \\u201ccan become whatever and whoever they want, because their dreams are nourished and cared for.\\u201d\", \"As Rudine Sims Bishop noted in her groundbreaking 1990 article, \\u201cMirrors, Windows, and Sliding Glass Doors,\\u201d it is powerful and validating to see one\\u2019s life and community reflected in a book. But it is just as essential that books provide readers with a glimpse into the lives of others. In the past, these four picture books might have been set aside for young readers who could identify with the characters and communities reflected in the stories. My hope is that today they will be celebrated by all readers.\"]","href_hash":"ad745e6743da11ecbfaf2f41dabbb760"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ad745e6743da11ecbfaf2f41dabbb760"}},
