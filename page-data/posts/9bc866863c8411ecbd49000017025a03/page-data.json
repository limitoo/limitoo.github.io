But the investigation soon pivoted to two petty thieves who were later convicted of murder despite a lack of forensic evidence linking either to the crime.\", \"Now, an explosive new claim is at the center of a renewed effort by defense lawyers to clear the two: The real killer was one of New York\\u2019s most infamous criminals, Richard Matt, whose 2015 escape from a state prison set off a nationwide manhunt that ended when he was fatally shot by a federal agent.\", \"The new theory emerged from a monthslong investigation by two prosecutors from the Erie County, N.Y., district attorney\\u2019s office, who presented their findings \\u2014 and their belief in Mr. Matt\\u2019s involvement \\u2014 to their boss, John J. Flynn, the district attorney, in August.\", \"But Mr. Flynn rejected the findings, demoted one of the prosecutors and reassigned the other. He said he could not comment on personnel issues, but said the two men had been removed because they \\u201cdid not accept my decision with the professionalism expected of career prosecutors.\\u201d His office said that despite the lack of forensic evidence there was still ample trial testimony to support the convictions.\", \"Lawyers for the convicted men make another incendiary claim in court filings: Not only did Mr. Matt kill Ms. Meindl; he may have carried out the murder at the behest of the lead detective who investigated the crime, David Bentley.\", \"On Tuesday, Mr. Bentley adamantly denied any role and offered to take a lie-detector test.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s totally, absolutely, unequivocally insane,\\u201d Mr. Bentley said, adding that he had not known Ms. Meindl and had testified against Mr. Matt in a different murder case.\", \"\\u201cI could never say that stuff,\\u201d Mr. Bentley said of his testimony in that case, \\u201cand have hired him to murder somebody.\\u201d\", \"In a motion filed in State Supreme Court in Buffalo last month, the defense lawyers said there is evidence that Mr. Matt confessed to killing Ms. Meindl in 2015. He made the confession to his fellow escapee, David Sweat, according to another document. Mr. Sweat is imprisoned in Ulster County.\", \"Adding more mystery to an already perplexing case, recent DNA sampling of crime scene evidence has excluded both men convicted in the murder \\u2014 and Mr. Matt.\", \"The new twists have brought hope to the men who were found guilty \\u2014 James Pugh, who was recently paroled, and Brian Scott Lorenz, who is still in prison.\", \"\\u201cI knew, in my heart, that I didn\\u2019t commit this crime,\\u201d Mr. Lorenz said in an interview, adding, \\u201cBut I never gave up.\\u201d\", \"In a statement, Mr. Flynn, a Democrat, flatly denied that there was any credible evidence \\u201cto link Richard Matt to the murder of Deborah Meindl.\\u201d He also defended his response to the findings of the prosecutors who revisited the case.\", \"\\u201cI, along with my entire senior leadership team, several of my senior bureau chiefs and most experienced trial attorneys, disagreed with their conclusions due to a lack of any credible evidence,\\u201d he said.\", \"Because the two prosecutors have not detailed their findings publicly, it is not fully clear what they believe implicates Mr. Matt. Neither man would comment, although one is seeking to testify in the case, court filings show. Both still work for Mr. Flynn.\", \"Mr. Bentley helped raise Mr. Matt\\u2019s daughter Jamie, who once wrote that the detective \\u201cknew my father probably as well as anyone on the outside.\\u201d In an interview and text messages, Mr. Bentley, who retired in 2003, acknowledged having had a close relationship with Mr. Matt \\u2014 whom he used as an informant \\u2014 bordering on that of father-son.\", \"\\u201cI related to Rick: I felt bad for him,\\u201d Mr. Bentley said. \\u201cYou could almost say I loved the kid.\\u201d\", \"But he does not believe Mr. Matt \\u2014 a convicted killer \\u2014 could have murdered Ms. Meindl, saying, \\u201che was just a punk\\u201d and \\u201cwasn\\u2019t a candidate for a crime like that.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSomebody planted the idea about him just to defend Pugh and Lorenzo,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Bentley also suggested that Mr. Matt \\u201cwas known to brag about all sorts of stuff that never existed.\\u201d\", \"After Ms. Meindl was killed, suspicion initially fell on her husband, Donald Meindl, who was in his early 30s and a Taco Bell manager at the time. A friend told the police that Mr. Meindl had once sought his advice about hiring someone to kill his wife. \\u201cIt should be made to look like a robbery,\\u201d the friend recalled Mr. Meindl saying, court records show.\", \"Mr. Meindl, who did not respond to interview requests, insisted that he was joking and has always maintained his innocence. Police and court records describe an open marriage and Mr. Meindl\\u2019s involvement with a 17-year-old girl who worked for him. He had an alibi: The day of the murder, he was at work getting fired for sexual harassment.\", \"After a tip from an informant, investigators at the time shifted their focus to Mr. Lorenz, a 23-year-old with a history of minor crimes who was in Iowa after being arrested for car theft.\", \"Desperate to return home, Mr. Lorenz concocted a bizarre plan to confess to Deborah Meindl\\u2019s murder, according to his defense team, and implicated Mr. Pugh, his sometime burglary partner, thinking it would bolster his story. He told a police officer he was innocent, but was willing to plead guilty to a manslaughter charge, according to a prosecution filing.\", \"Mr. Lorenz\\u2019s confession got details wrong \\u2014 for instance, he said a hogtie was used when one was not \\u2014 and it was deemed inadmissible at trial. Still, the jury returned a guilty verdict in less than six hours. (Mr. Lorenz\\u2019s name was listed as \\u201cLorenzo\\u201d in court records although his legal name is Lorenz.)\", \"Mr. Pugh was in his 30s when the slaying occurred. \\u201cI was a criminal,\\u201d he said in an interview. \\u201cBut I certainly wasn\\u2019t somebody that would kill somebody. I\\u2019m not capable of that.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Lorenz recalled being incredulous at the verdict. \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe, I can\\u2019t believe this,\\u201d he said in an interview from a state prison in Auburn, N.Y. He added: \\u201cAnger turns into bewilderment, then the depression sets in.\\u201d\", \"Then in 2018 a state judge forced Erie County officials to conduct DNA testing of blood-splattered items from the crime scene. Neither man\\u2019s DNA was found.\", \"Mr. Lorenz was elated.\", \"\\u201cI thought I was going home immediately,\\u201d he said.\", \"Instead, earlier this year, Mr. Flynn\\u2019s office appointed two prosecutors to review the case, Michael J. Hillery, who ran the office\\u2019s appeals bureau, and David A. Heraty, an assistant district attorney.\", \"After interviewing more than 50 witnesses, Mr. Hillery called Ilann Maazel, a civil rights lawyer representing Mr. Lorenz, and told him that the prosecutors believed his client was innocent. Moreover, they suspected Mr. Matt.\", \"\\u201cI almost fell out of my chair,\\u201d Mr. Maazel said.\", \"Mr. Pugh\\u2019s lawyer, Zachary Margulis-Ohnuma, said he was \\u201cgratified that honest, courageous prosecutors followed the evidence.\\u201d\", \"In a court filing last month, Mr. Lorenz\\u2019s lawyers said Ms. Meindl had been having an affair with Mr. Bentley and had become aware of unspecified acts of corruption by the detective. The detective, the filing said, had \\u201csent Matt to murder her to ensure that she would not tell anyone else what she knew.\\u201d\", \"During his career, Mr. Bentley was the subject of at least 15 police brutality and harassment complaints, The Buffalo News has reported. But in interviews, he defended his record, saying he was tough but never corrupt.\", \"\\u201cI solved more crimes than the whole department did because I was savvy,\\u201d he said on Tuesday. \\u201cBut I was not crooked.\\u201d\", \"He also insisted he had been not in a romantic relationship with Ms. Meindl, a denial that Mr. Flynn echoed.\", \"In a filing this week, Mr. Flynn\\u2019s office assailed Mr. Heraty, suggesting that he had essentially fed details of the crime to Mr. Sweat, the onetime fugitive. Mr. Heraty has declined to sign an affidavit agreeing to those findings, and has said he wants to testify in the matter.\", \"On Wednesday, Mr. Maazel will offer an oral argument in a Buffalo court as he seeks to free his client; the prosecution has agreed to hold a follow-up hearing. But in another recent twist, the district attorney\\u2019s office turned a Sept. 28 letter from Mr. Sweat over to the defense.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m concerned as to why you would be removed from the case,\\u201d he wrote to one of the prosecutors, adding that he was \\u201cpissed about the two guys being in prison too who didn\\u2019t do it!\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9bc866863c8411ecbd49000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9bc866863c8411ecbd49000017025a03"}},
