It told the story of two white children lost in the wilderness who encounter an Aboriginal boy. David Gumpilil (as he was erroneously named in the film credits) even as a raw teenager is a magnetic, charismatic presence.\", \"It is a spare, elegiac film. Minimal dialogue. Harsh yet beautiful. Knowing yet innocent. It is also deeply troubling. It tells the eternal story of humanity's fall.

The Aboriginal boy opens a world foreign and mystical. Where there is dust he finds water. Where there is hunger he provides food. The children grow close yet their worlds never quite touch.\", \"Walkabout belongs to those Australian films and books that deal with what Freud called the uncanny: where home becomes strange. Peter Weir's\\u00a0Picnic at Hanging Rock, Ted Kotcheff's Wake in Fright and novels like Randolph Stow's\\u00a0Tourmaline. The paintings of Russell Drysdale pondered our place in this land, what he called \\\"this other space in the Australian memory\\\".\", \"These are the places where Australians disappear.

Powerful unforgettable roles in films like Tracker and Rabbit Proof Fence, Fingerbone Bill in Storm Boy and his ironic funny turn as Neville Bell in Crocodile Dundee.
