If you can afford it it will pay to stock up a bit. There will be thousands of close contacts a day,\\\" Mallard wrote.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"If I'm not one of them I will be happy to do grocery and medicine runs for Wainuiomata people.\\\"\", \"Waititi, in response to Mallard's tweet, said it was \\\"obviously clear that the [Government] does not have a solid pandemic plan\\\", with people being \\\"encouraged to panic buy by the Speaker\\\".\\u00a0\", \"Mallard defended himself, telling Waititi: \\\"You of all people understand the difference between getting prepared for isolation as a close contact and panicking. Don't pretend not to. Encourage your team to get organised.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"The M\\u0101ori Party co-leader hit back, accusing the Speaker of not being \\\"connected\\\" to everyday New Zealanders and the struggle to make ends meet.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Being prepared and encouraging people to panic buy is not helpful! What you do and you would know this if you were connected to the people, is that you marginalise the already marginalised as they don't have the privilege of bulk buying, they're just trying to survive.\\\"\", \"Mallard begged to differ.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I live in a community with a long history of helping each other. Pretending you don't know the difference between panicking and getting prepared is no credit to you. Helping communities get ready for known forthcoming adverse events is important. Do it.\\\"\", \"Mallard and Waititi have a history of trading barbs. The M\\u0101ori Party co-leader was kicked out of Parliament last year for not wearing a tie, sparking a national debate which eventually led to the Speaker scrapping the rule.\\u00a0\", \"Panic-buying is a phenomenon observed around the world after governments started imposing lockdowns to prevent the spread of COVID-19 - and New Zealand was no exception.\\u00a0\", \"The first news reports of Delta in the Auckland community last August resulted\\u00a0in\\u00a0widespread panic-buying as people flocked to supermarkets\\u00a0in their droves to stock up on essentials, resulting in\\u00a0fights over in-demand products\\u00a0and prompting\\u00a0calls for shoppers to remain calm.\", \"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has ruled out lockdowns in the event of an Omicron outbreak, but all of New Zealand will shift to the more restrictive 'red' traffic light of the COVID-19 Protection Framework, which last year replaced the alert levels.\\u00a0\", \"The entire country is currently at orange, meaning there are no gathering limits for the vaccinated. At red, gatherings are capped at 100 for the vaccinated and hospitality guests must be seated and separated.\\u00a0\", \"Omicron, though less severe than other variants, is more contagious, and once it gets hold in the community, it's expected to spread quickly, meaning lots of people will have to isolate themselves at home.\\u00a0\", \"The isolation period for COVID-19 cases in the community is at least 14 days, including 72 hours symptom-free. The isolation period for close contacts is 10 days. You will need to be tested immediately and on day five and day eight.\\u00a0\", \"Booster vaccination shots are one way to help prevent adverse effects of Omicron. You can get a booster shot if your second dose was administered four months ago.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"7889be887a5d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7889be887a5d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
