government vaccine mandate for staff.\", \"From December 17, all staff and volunteers in schools and early childhood centres will be required to have received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.\", \"Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk announced the mandate in parliament, saying it would bring the state's education sector into line with other states and territories.\", \"But with the Omicron COVID variant now confirmed in New South Wales and plans unclear on vaccinating children under 12, stakeholders are concerned that disruption could continue in the new year, despite staff vaccinations.\", \"Georgie Dent from not-for-profit advocacy group The Parenthood said she is concerned the childcare sector will lose significant numbers of staff due to disruptions from COVID circulating in the community.\", \"Ms Dent said with no plans to vaccinate children under the age of 12, childcare centres would become higher risk settings once the rest of the community has been vaccinated.\", \"She said the virus could still transmit between children and cause ongoing shutdowns and staffing issues.\", \"\\\"Early learning services will be a setting in which there is a significant unvaccinated population,\\\" she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c25cd21261b9ea4916c51f263665d0fa\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Georgie Dent says early educators are leaving the sector in droves.(Supplied: The Parenthood)</div>\", \"\\\"That is going to be something that the parents, that educators, that early education employers are going to have to be braced for, because there are ongoing ramifications from those sorts of disruption and closure.\", \"\\\"We know that early educators are leaving the sector in droves, even before COVID-19 hit staff turnover was a considerable issue, but services are now saying they have not seen vacancy rates like they've got right now.\\\"\", \"Ms Dent said the workforce \\\"bore the brunt\\\" of COVID pressures as early education continued through the pandemic.\", \"\\\"We needed early educators to be there so that we could have nurses get to hospitals, so we could have supermarket shelves stocked, so by virtue of necessity early educators had to stay on the frontline,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Now they are one of the cohorts of workers that have got greater exposure to COVID-19, because they look after children under five who aren't vaccinated.\", \"\\\"The workforce shortage can and will become a crisis of really significant proportions.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Rapid antigen testing could end school closures: UQ expert</div>\", \"Earlier this month, the Doherty Institute's modelling recommended that daily rapid antigen testing in schools could be as effective as 14-day lockdowns to prevent outbreaks and minimise missed learning.\", \"The modelling suggested a \\\"test to stay\\\" approach could be used in which students undertake rapid antigen testing daily in a bid to catch positive children quickly and prevent outbreaks.\", \"<img

good tool for schools.(ABC News: Oliver Gordon)</div>\", \"University of Queensland infectious disease specialist Paul Griffin said while these tests had limitations, they could be used in schools.\", \"\\\"What it means is if there has been a case there, even potentially close contacts or maybe just casual contacts could be tested every day for a couple of days and still have to come to school if they test negative,\\\" Dr Griffin said.\", \"He said while rapid antigen testing was not as sensitive as PCR testing, taking the test on consecutive days gave\\u00a0a more accurate picture.\", \"\\\"Of course if one of those children was symptomatic, they would have to immediately not attend school and get a PCR-based test, but in screening in an asymptomatic context, particularly if done on multiple occasions, it certainly is a satisfactory tool,\\\" he said.\", \"Dr Griffin said Australians need to become more accustomed to using rapid antigen tests.\", \"\\\"I think they'd be really useful for screening before and after many high risk activities, including travelling, for example, or mass gatherings, like sporting or other large events,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We do now have the tools, I think, to be more sophisticated, and more risk-based in terms of how we do things, so we don't need to rely on any of those harsher strategies anymore.\", \"\\\"I'd like to think now with parents being vaccinated, with older children being vaccinated and with our access to rapid testing as well, we shouldn't really need to close things like schools outside of truly extreme extenuating circumstances.\\\"\", \"Dr Griffin said evidence suggested younger children who carry the virus are often less infectious and have less severe symptoms of the virus.\", \"He said while vaccines for those under the age of five were still a way off, as more data from clinical trials becomes available and more overseas experience comes to light, vaccines to be rolled out for infants would arrive eventually.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Positive step to keep staff safe</div>\", \"Queensland Teachers Union president Cresta Richardson said the union supported any measures that \\\"keep students and its members safe\\\".\", \"\\\"It's a virus that doesn't choose one person over another, so having adults on a school ground who are vaccinated is good for the health and safety of all in the school, particularly the children,\\\" Ms Richardson said.\", \"\\\"When it became evident that teachers were going to be a priority working group for vaccinations, I think that was welcomed by many of our members and a wide majority of our members.\", \"\\\"It's a really high percentage of people who are already double-dosed in the teaching profession.\\\"\", \"Ms Richardson said the union was seeking more details about how it would work and the possible impact on staffing levels.\", \"\\\"There are some [teachers] who are still vaccine hesitant or reluctant,\\\" Ms Richardson said.\", \"\\\"We'll definitely be working with the department to support our members and students in schools.\", \"\\\"We need to do some workforce planning \\u2026 about what it looks like so that our members \\u2026 are supported.\\\"\", \"A Queensland government spokesperson said 82,000 vaccinations had already been administered to school and early childhood staff.\", \"It is believed there are about 80,000 school staff in the state, including about 54,000 teachers.\"]","href_hash":"6082a8c2521711ec9bf99f12da131946"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6082a8c2521711ec9bf99f12da131946"}},
