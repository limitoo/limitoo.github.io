Some have not heard from their families since Saturday.\", \"There are 800 Tongan labourers in the Recognised Seasonal Employers Scheme.\", \"RSE scheme liaison Sefita Hao'uli said the workers fear for their families' safety and are \\\"disappointed they won't be seeing their loved ones anytime soon.\\\"\", \"\\\"But they should also be aware that this is something that was unexpected,\\\" Hao'uli said.\", \"\\\"In the interest of everybody's safety and making sure that not only are they safe on this end but if and when they do go back home, they will also be safe and not become a burden to their families.\\\"\", \"They have to make a decision that best suits them, Hao'uli said.\", \"\\\"The repatriation flight is now delayed indefinitely. It is also very likely that the incoming flight on the 25th of January which was supposed to bring workers is also going to be delayed indefinitely.\\\"\", \"Air NZ is yet to confirm the status of that scheduled flight from Tonga next Tuesday.\", \"In a statement, the airline said they are monitoring the situation closely and their hearts go out to the people of Tonga.\", \"\\\"It is the airline's decision that we are following through.
