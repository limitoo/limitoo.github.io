Pere's single bullet wound to the back was serious but it could have been fatal.\", \"The Independent Police Conduct Authority (IPCA) investigated the shooting but, contrary to its usual practice of publishing decisions on its website, didn't release the findings.\", \"Initially, the IPCA said legal action had delayed the investigation. The AOS officer who shot Pere had been charged with careless use of a firearm.

The AOS went to his mother's house and arrested Pere for unlawfully possessing a pistol.\", \"While attempting to change his handcuffs - from plastic to metal ones - an officer \\\"bent down slightly and his rifle fired\\\".\", \"According to the IPCA report, the AOS officer was not holding the rifle when it fired, rather it was attached to a sling around his neck.\", \"The report says the safety lever was accidentally turned to the fire position when it \\\"brushed against the stiff fabric of his vest\\\". Then, when the officer leaned forward to change Pere's handcuffs, a buckle on his vest \\\"connected with the trigger causing the rifle to fire\\\".\", \"The IPCA found that, because the officer did not know where his gun was pointing, he broke one of the four basic rules of firearms training, the so-called 'laser rule': where you point the firearm it will fire.\", \"While the jury in the Napier District Court trial found the AOS officer not guilty on the charge of careless use of a firearm, it was guided by the criminal threshold of \\\"beyond reasonable doubt\\\". The IPCA found that on \\\"the 'balance of probabilities\\\" the officer had \\\"carelessly used his firearm\\\".\", \"Before an AOS officer can be deployed they must complete the National AOS qualification course. But the officer who shot Pere had not done this.

When this is combined with the failure of A84 to appreciate what was within the line of fire indicates to me a need for further training and an acknowledgement by AOS that experience matters.\\\"\", \"Not only were they inexperienced and poor shots, they were returned to duty 11 days after the shooting - before any of this could be properly examined, before psychological testing and before it was decided whether criminal charges would be laid.\", \"One of the officers was returned to duty more than a week before he sat another \\\"qualification shoot\\\".\", \"The IPCA was not impressed: \\\"The failure of the officers to hit their target and the tragic outcome of that failure, should have resulted in a more rigorous assessment of whether they should return to AOS duties and, as a minimum, weapons re-training rather than re-qualification.\\\"\", \"***\", \"New Zealand Police College training is just 16 weeks long - one of the shortest police training courses in the world.\", \"According to a report by the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform, New Zealand's 16 weeks aligns it with the US near the bottom of its league table.\", \"On average an American police officer gets about 650 hours of training before qualifying - similar to the 16 weeks in New Zealand. But police in Portugal receive 10,400 hours, in Finland 5400, in Germany 4050 and Australia 3500.\", \"Police Association president Chris Cahill says out of the 16 weeks at New Zealand Police College just one week is spent on firearms training. After they qualify, police receive seven and a half days a year in weapons training but until recently it was just four days.\", \"\\\"I don't believe the training is sufficient,\\\" Cahill says. \\\"It's something our members have raised for many years. The quality of the training they believe is good. The quantity of the training, they believe, really needs to increase.\\\"\", \"But Tayor says another issue is what they are learning.\", \"Police policy is to aim for the centre body mass which Taylor describes as shoot to kill. \\\"Shoot to kill is literally aiming at the centre body mass which is the heart and lungs.\\\"\", \"He says highly trained officers could shoot to incapacitate rather than kill.\", \"\\\"An AR-15 rifle that the police are using, is quite capable of hitting, after a significant piece of training, a 50 cent piece at 100 metres.\\\"\", \"But Coster says when police are under pressure \\\"your ability to execute a very precise movement is compromised\\\" which is why police aim for the centre body mass, as the largest target.\", \"\\\"Even the best equipped people in terms of shooting skills, would struggle with a pistol to shoot an object other than at very close range,\\\" he said. \\\"So this idea of shoot to wound is really something from the movies, it is not appropriate for the vast majority of situations our people find themselves in.\\\"\", \"Taylor says the ammunition police use is also a factor in the number of deaths.\", \"Police use hollow point bullets which are banned for military use under the Geneva convention.\", \"\\\"They're banned because of the dreadful wounds they create. But the Geneva Convention doesn't apply to the police,\\\" Taylor says.\", \"\\\"If the bullet hits basically any part of the torso, it will fragment and will expand to sometimes ten times the size of the original bullet and blow a large piece out of the back of the person.\\\"\", \"One of the reasons police use hollow point bullets goes back to one of New Zealand's worst mass shootings. In November 1990, 33-year-old David Gray killed 13 people in Aramoana, northeast of Dunedin, including local sergeant Stewart Guthrie, who was one of the first responders.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/289314/eight_col_%C2%A9Stuff_-_Aramoana_copy_1610.jpg?1647480283\\\" alt=\\\"Aramoana in 1990, taken while police hunt for killer David Gray.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nAramoana, where David Gray killed 13 people in November 1990 \\nPhoto: Stuff Limited\\n</div>\", \"Nowadays the police have the Special Tactics Group (STG) to respond to sieges and provide specialist intelligence, negotiation and command support.\", \"Back in 1990 that squad was called the Anti-Terrorist Squad or ATS. It was mainly made up of military personnel and they used full metal jacket bullets, as most armies do.\", \"The IPCA report into the shooting said the use of full metal jacket bullets was one reason Gray wasn't stopped earlier.\", \"\\\"The effect of the use of full metal jacket ammunition is demonstrated by the fact that, notwithstanding Gray received a bullet to the head and another to the chest which touched his heart he was not immediately incapacitated.\\\"\", \"The ATS had used full metal jacket ammunition since it was set up in 1973 but following the report they switched to hollow point bullets.\", \"Coster says full metal jacket bullets can also pass through a person or object and hit something else whereas hollow point bullets won't do that.\", \"\\\"The reason we use that kind of ammunition is because of the risk to others from a round passing through someone who's been shot,\\\" he says.\", \"\\\"When you're fearing for your life, you will be focused on the threat in front of you, you're not going to have the attention capacity to say, 'there's someone over there there's someone over there, there's a house behind them'.\\\"\", \"Taylor accepts hollow point bullets are widely used in other countries for law enforcement, but says this massively raises the stakes on pulling the trigger because a bullet wound is highly likely to be fatal.\", \"\\\"The decision has to be, 'I'm going to kill this person,' when they pull the trigger, because that's realistically the end result.\\\"\", \"But firing the gun all comes down to the \\\"final frame\\\" of the incident, Taylor says. Wind the video back. Would a different strategy have reduced the tension before it reached a point of no return?\", \"Taylor says the attitude of the officer with the gun is a major factor in the number of fatal police shootings in New Zealand.\", \"\\\"It's tied in with a problematic culture and recruitment in the police,\\\" he says. \\\"There is a fundamental problem with that internal culture in the police, there is an expectation of excitement and challenge.\\\"\", \"***\", \"At 2am on Thursday, 27 September, 2007 a police officer knocked on the door of Maria and Ray Bellingham's Napier home.\", \"\\\"She said that she had some bad news,\\\" Maria recalls. \\\"Our son had been shot by the police in Christchurch.\\\"\", \"Maria said a prayer and then came the tears. \\\"Ray and I did an awful lot of crying,\\\" she says. \\\"I can actually feel it welling up inside me now and so can Ray, he's standing beside me,\\\" she says on the phone from Napier. \\\"You just lose the plot.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/289317/eight_col_STEPHEN-BELLINGHAM-POLAROID_1610.jpg?1647481779\\\" alt=\\\"Stephen (center) with his parents Maria and Ray Bellingham\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nStephen Bellingham, centre, with his parents Maria and Ray Bellingham \\nPhoto: Supplied\\n</div>\", \"Maria believes that Stephen would be with her now if a different officer had responded to the incident with her son that night.\", \"Bellingham had no criminal history and was popular with friends and work colleagues, according to the IPCA report into his death\", \"But a few days prior to the shooting he appeared highly agitated, was not sleeping or eating and was taking party pills, which were legal at the time.\", \"One night he began smashing up a van outside his central Christchurch flat and then walked a few streets over, smashed a car window with a hammer, unlocked the door and sat in the driver's seat.\", \"Two police officers responded to emergency calls reporting the incident.

He was the senior field supervisor that night, responsible for supervising the greater Christchurch area. Any serious incident that night would require him to take control and manage the resources.\", \"Officer A drove to within 5 metres of Bellingham, reaching him about 30 seconds before his two, unarmed, colleagues arrived.
