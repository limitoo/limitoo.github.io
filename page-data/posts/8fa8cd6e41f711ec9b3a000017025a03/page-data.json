The Democrats’ plan would cement that.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-10T07:28:32.000Z","content":"[\"Pete Buttigieg faced criticism from certain conservatives for taking paternity leave with his newborn twins. But his decision to do so showed something distinct about American family policy: It may be flimsy compared with that of many other nations, but it has tended to recognize caregiving as something everyone does, not just mothers.\", \"The Democrats\\u2019 safety net spending plan would expand and cement this idea. Its family policy proposals \\u2014 for paid family leave, elder care, child care, public preschool and a child allowance \\u2014 together define caregiving as a universal need, regardless of gender.\", \"Paid family leave would be for a wide range of circumstances, including births, illnesses and caregiving for extended family, in-laws, domestic partners and people who are the \\u201cequivalent\\u201d of family. The plans for child and elder care do away with the assumption that there is a default family caregiver \\u2014 a mother or daughter. Instead, they direct support to the person needing care, by subsidizing child care or home health aides. The expanded child tax credit works the same way. The money goes to a child\\u2019s primary caregiver, including grandparents or fathers, instead of being targeted at mothers, as federal cash assistance for children has been in the past.\", \"\\u201cA lot of the Biden agenda is really constructed around kids, and because it is, you lose some of the distinction around mothers and fathers, and you lose some of the distinction between single-parent and two-parent families,\\u201d said LaDonna Pavetti, vice president for family income support policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.\", \"States have also taken a gender-neutral approach to family policy, and it sets apart the United States from other rich countries. Even though the U.S. is an outlier in its lack of support for working families overall \\u2014 most Americans have no paid leave or significant financial help with child or elder care \\u2014 American policies have been much more likely to include men from the start. (Washington, D.C., where Mr. Buttigieg lives and works as transportation secretary, provides eight weeks of paid parental leave to both fathers and mothers and those who have adopted or are foster parents.)\", \"In much of Europe and the rest of the developed world, these policies are more likely to have been initially designed for women. As a result, they have sometimes reinforced gender inequality, by causing women to earn less and to be excluded from positions of power, and making it harder for men to be involved in their families\\u2019 lives.\", \"Other rich countries have much more generous policies for men: On average, fathers have two months of paid leave. In South Korea and Japan, they have a year, and in France, seven months. Yet to get there, countries have amended policies to encourage men to use them \\u2014 like \\u201cdaddy days\\u201d of paid leave in Sweden, Norway and Canada that the family loses if fathers don\\u2019t take it.\", \"Paradoxically, the reason the United States has been early in taking a gender-neutral approach to family policies is that it has been so late to offering them at all.\", \"\\u201cThis gender-specific approach lasted much longer there than here in the U.S., where the second wave of feminism took root sooner and successfully advocated for gender-neutral polices,\\u201d said Ruth Milkman, a distinguished professor of the sociology of labor movements at CUNY. \\u201cThis is the one area in which the U.S. was ahead of the curve.\\u201d\", \"A core idea of President Biden\\u2019s family policy plans is that caregiving is something everyone does. Democrats have framed the need as an economic one, as opposed to a women\\u2019s issue.\", \"Politically, this approach is likely to be more difficult than focusing on mothers alone, researchers said, in part because it challenges preconceptions about gender roles. But they also said that by including more people, it acknowledges the needs of modern-day families, and perhaps makes it less likely that mothers are penalized for caregiving.\", \"\\u201cIncluding these broader categories has made it a much heavier lift, but it\\u2019s been important to do that,\\u201d said Jane Waldfogel, a professor at the Columbia School of Social Work studying family policy. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a cost of gender neutrality, but there will be a payoff for it in the end.\\u201d\", \"The lawmakers driving the legislation reflect the idea that caregiving isn\\u2019t exclusive to women. Many leaders of this effort are women and mothers. They include Representative Pramila Jayapal, Representative Rosa DeLauro and Senator Patty Murray, who once taught preschool. But the effort has been led by Mr. Biden, who speaks openly and often about his experience as a single father. And men have been central to drafting the legislation for paid leave (Representative Richard E. Neal); child care (Representative Bobby Scott); and elder care (Senator Bob Casey).\", \"There has been a longtime tension in family policymaking between whether policies should treat men and women the same, or recognize the differences between them in terms of pregnancy, childbirth and caregiving responsibilities.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s been a shift back and forth in terms of the emphasis being on equal treatment, or that sometimes you need to recognize difference to get to equality,\\u201d said Dorothy Sue Cobble, a historian of feminism and labor studies at Rutgers.\", \"The first major family policies, in the early 20th century, were aimed at protecting mothers \\u2014 certain ones, at least. States offered mothers\\u2019 pensions, mostly for white women whose husbands had succumbed to one of the four Ds \\u2014 death, disability, drunkenness or divorce. Black and Hispanic women were excluded. The first federal welfare benefits in the United States came in 1935, and included Aid to Dependent Children, \\u201cto enable the mother to stay at home and devote herself to housekeeping and the care of her children,\\u201d according to Social Security documents from the time.\", \"Mostly, though, American policy has followed the approach of treating male and female caregivers the same \\u2014 if only by not offering much support for either.\", \"\\u201cIn Europe, being a feminist meant talking about women\\u2019s caregiving responsibilities, and in the United States, we didn\\u2019t want to talk about those,\\u201d Professor Waldfogel said. \\u201cWe went way farther than other countries in terms of equal rights, but less far with things like paid leave.\\u201d\", \"During the world wars, many European countries had family policies like paid maternity leave and public child care to support the women who were doing men\\u2019s former jobs while they were deployed. These countries made them permanent in part to try to increase fertility after the losses sustained in the wars.\", \"American women were involved in the international Maternity Protection Convention in 1919, which called for 12 weeks of paid leave for birth mothers, but while other countries followed it, the United States did not. And though the U.S. offered public child care during World War II, it ended after the war.\", \"By the time the United States began offering unpaid leave for some workers, in 1993, and California became the first state to enact a law to pay for it, in 2002, gender roles had changed in major ways. Most mothers were already working for pay, and men were more involved with family. So the policies included both men and women, as well as caregiving for family illnesses, from the start.\", \"Making policies gender neutral, though, doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean both men and women will use them. The backlash to Mr. Buttigieg\\u2019s leave shows how deep the resistance can be: \\u201cPaternity leave, they call it, trying to figure out how to breastfeed,\\u201d Tucker Carlson said on his Fox News show.\", \"Today\\u2019s safety net programs are technically open to any parents, and yet it\\u2019s mostly mothers who sign up. Though state paid leave programs increase leave-taking by both men and women, women take longer leaves.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing that excludes fathers, but we know that often programs that have primarily served women don\\u2019t feel welcoming to men,\\u201d Ms. Pavetti said.\", \"Policy design makes a difference. Women are more likely to work for pay if they can find high-quality child care that costs less than they earn. Men are more likely to take family leave if it\\u2019s paid and has job protection (the plan Congress is considering has the former but not the job protection).\", \"\\u201cNow we\\u2019re in this moment of trying to rethink what the social safety net looks like,\\u201d said Elisabeth Jacobs, a senior fellow studying family economic policy at the Urban Institute, \\u201cand how that matches where families are today.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8fa8cd6e41f711ec9b3a000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8fa8cd6e41f711ec9b3a000017025a03"}},
