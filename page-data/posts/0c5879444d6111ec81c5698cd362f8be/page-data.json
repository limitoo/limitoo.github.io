Earlier this month, the Fed took the first step toward withdrawing support for the economy when it announced that it would begin scaling back its Treasury bond and mortgage-backed security purchases by $15 billion a month starting in November.\", \"\\u201cSome participants suggested that reducing the pace of net asset purchases by more than $15 billion each month could be warranted so that the committee would be in a better position to make adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, particularly in light of inflation pressures,\\u201d the minutes showed, referring to the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets interest rates.\", \"Those comments reflected uncertainty at the central bank over how long supply chain kinks and elevated prices might continue. Fed officials maintained their expectation that inflation would diminish \\u201csignificantly during 2022,\\u201d but policymakers \\u201cindicated that their uncertainty regarding this assessment had increased.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMany participants pointed to considerations that might suggest that elevated inflation could prove more persistent,\\u201d officials said.\", \"Inflation has picked up over the past year, posing a challenge for the Fed, which is responsible for maintaining stable prices, along with fostering maximum employment. Prices have continued to surge since the Fed\\u2019s last meeting, a trajectory that could push policymakers to reduce their economic support more quickly than previously expected.\", \"Data released on Wednesday showed that prices were rising at the fastest pace in three decades as consumers face higher prices for gas and food. Prices climbed by 5 percent in the 12 months through October, according to the Personal Consumption Expenditures index, the Fed\\u2019s preferred measure of inflation.\", \"Richard H. Clarida, the Fed\\u2019s vice chair, hinted last week that it could be appropriate for policymakers to consider speeding up their process of slowing bond purchases at their next gathering, saying that he will be looking \\u201cclosely at the data that we get between now and the December meeting.\\u201d\", \"Mary Daly, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, told Yahoo Finance this week that she would be open to supporting a quicker end to the bond-buying program if economic trends did not improve.\", \"\\u201cIf things continue to do what they\\u2019ve been doing, then I would completely support an accelerated pace of tapering,\\u201d Ms. Daly said.\", \"Officials have tried to separate their path for slower bond buying from their plans for interest rates. But investors increasingly expect rate increases to start midway through 2022.\", \"The Fed has said that it wants to achieve full employment before raising borrowing costs to cool the economy.\", \"Data released by the Labor Department on Wednesday found that initial jobless claims dropped to their lowest point since 1969, falling to 199,000 last week.\"]","href_hash":"0c5879444d6111ec81c5698cd362f8be"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0c5879444d6111ec81c5698cd362f8be"}},
