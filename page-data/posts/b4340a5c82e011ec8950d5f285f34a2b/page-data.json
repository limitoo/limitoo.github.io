If he weren\\u2019t an artist, though, he might be a linguist, a semiotics professor or a rapper. Or at least that\\u2019s the sense you get after spending time with his \\u201cSlanguage\\u201d paintings, which are imbued with messages that aren\\u2019t immediately apparent, and that often require knowledge of wordplay to decode. The series began, in 2019, as a shout-out to regional slang from Oakland, Calif., and the rest of the Bay Area. Take \\u201cYay Area\\u201d (2020), a realist composition that brings together recognizable and mundane food items: a Coca-Cola bottle turned on its side, a chocolate layer cake atop a pedestal and a glass bowl filled with scoops of vanilla ice cream. At first glance, the still life, which recalls the work of the American painter Wayne Thiebaud, impresses with its skill and precision and evokes nostalgia for sugary childhood treats. Depending on your familiarity with certain hip-hop lyrics, though, it may later occur to you that the artist has depicted foods whose names, like the \\u201cYay\\u201d of the title, are slang for cocaine (coke, cola, cake), and one that references the Oakland artist Dru Down\\u2019s 1993 song \\u201cIce Cream Man,\\u201d its title an allusion to a drug dealer (though he\\u2019s hardly the only rapper to have used the term). Another work of Chew\\u2019s, \\u201cBall Street Journal\\u201d (2020), includes images of cheese, bread and paper \\u2014 all terms for money.\", \"Partly, Chew, 29, creates his pictorial riddles simply because he can. It\\u2019s as though he\\u2019s a slick lyricist spitting lines onto his canvas, rewarding the close viewer, like the listener of a rich track played on repeat, with new layers of meaning. But Chew is also interested in centering Black language and experience, in highlighting the extent to which Black culture has shaped American culture at large and in exposing and scrambling people\\u2019s assumptions. Working in a fine art context, he is pushing against various forms of exclusion that have long reigned in that space.\", \"Chew\\u2019s latest paintings, an extension of \\u201cSlanguage,\\u201d make up \\u201cThe Roof is on Fire,\\u201d his debut solo exhibition at Altman Siegel gallery in San Francisco (on view through Feb. 19), and take on the mimetic dances hip-hop has spawned. In \\u201cMade in America\\u201d (2021), Bart Simpson wreaks havoc in a harshly lit supermarket with seemingly unending aisles; in his cart is a box of instant mashed potatoes and a bottle of Heinz ketchup. It all seems a lighthearted critique of overabundance. But present in the scene, too, are nods to three dances: the Bart Simpson, for which the dancer moves her arms across her body and then into a goal-post position as she slides from side to side; the Mashed Potato, which has her twist her feet in and out while standing on a slight tiptoe, then kick out her heels, and can be traced back to the song \\u201cMashed Potato Time,\\u201d first performed by Dee Dee Sharp in 1962; and the Ketchup Dance, which was popularized by the Spanish pop group Las Ketchup around 2002 and starts with horizontal chopping motions made with the hands. Last is the Shopping Cart, that self-explanatory classic whereby the dancer mimes pushing a cart to a beat, grabbing supermarket items and throwing them in.\", \"Another work on view, \\u201cAsk ya Mama\\u201d (2021), shows Roger Rabbit lounging in a cabbage patch. Behind him, peeking over a leaf, is a smirking Smurf. Here, the artist is referencing the Roger Rabbit, a move that has the dancer skip backward in place while pumping her arms and chest; the Cabbage Patch, for which she looks to be stirring an invisible, chest-high pot; and the Smurf, for which she bounces at the knees while moving a bent arm diagonally across the body. In \\u201cSoulja boy tol\\u2019 Em\\u201d (2021), Clark Kent reads a copy of Vogue whose cover pictures the rapper Soulja Boy, who, in his song \\u201cCrank That\\u201d (2007), directs the dancer to \\u201cpunch then crank back three times from left to right\\u201d and fly like Superman. It\\u2019s a clever scene that shows a tired cultural figure depending on a rapper for renewed inspiration and relevance. And to all this Chew has added another layer still. If you download the app Halo AR, follow the artist at tchew2 and then hold your phone in front of any of the paintings (or in front of the photos of them published here), holograms of his friends and family members, some of them professional dancers, will pop up and perform each dance.\", \"Chew did a lot of research for the works, consulting friends, other artists and the internet. Still, hip-hop was familiar territory to him long before his \\u201cSlanguage\\u201d days. He grew up in Hawthorne, Calif., which is part of Los Angeles County\\u2019s South Bay. \\u201cIt\\u2019s where the Beach Boys are from, but it\\u2019s also close to the hood, to Inglewood and Compton, so it has a little bit of both worlds,\\u201d says Chew. It\\u2019s where he first came to know West Coast groups like Digital Underground and MC Hammer (both of whom you\\u2019ll find in Chew\\u2019s new paintings if you know where to look). As a child, Chew would often sketch while rap music videos played in the background, and he describes his early art as fan art because he was often drawing the people on the screen. He still has his old sketchbooks \\u2014 the beginnings of a life spent archiving the culture, as he sees it. The other art form that he gravitated toward was dance. At his middle school, dance battles weren\\u2019t uncommon, and he performed for a number of his teen years with the Y Troop, a competitive hip-hop dance group based out of his local community center. In the end, though, Chew chose art, which only occurred to him as an option when he was voted \\u201cbest artist\\u201d by his high school class. \\u201cI was somebody\\u2019s best,\\u201d he says, \\u201cso I kept going.\\u201d\", \"In college, he majored in psychology but kept sketching, watched instructional art videos on YouTube and took a few studio classes, in which he learned basics like the differences between acrylic and oil paint. \\u201cBefore, I was just mixing everything I had so I could get a certain color,\\u201d he says. Eventually, he applied to the MFA programs at six schools and was rejected by all of them. But he continued to hone his skills and began adding conceptual elements to his compositions. \\u201cPockets\\u201d (2015), a still life of all the items (a pencil, lip balm, rolling papers) inside his pockets at the time he started painting it, dates from this period. The following year, he reapplied to the same schools, and this time he got into all six. Chew graduated from San Francisco\\u2019s California College for the Arts in 2019. Along the way, he solidified his aim of honoring the legacy of the African diaspora, and co-founded the 5/5 collective, a multimedia group dedicated to making and curating work that explores Blackness.\", \"The paintings that make up \\u201cThe Roof is on Fire\\u201d continue in this vein. In the first months of lockdown, Chew was completing an artist residency at the Headlands Center for the Arts in Sausalito. \\u201c[The pandemic] didn\\u2019t feel real then, not like it would later. We were bumping music all the time, chilling,\\u201d he says. Once he left that safe communal environment, however, the gravity of the situation sunk in, and Chew greatly missed the feeling of losing himself in movement with another or with an entire crowd. In place of that, there was TikTok, a paltry substitute. And it wasn\\u2019t lost on Chew that most of the moves popular on TikTok were created by young Black dancers and then appropriated by white ones.\", \"Once he\\u2019d decided to explore specific dances on the canvas, he made a point of including, along with some current crazes like the Renegade, created by Jalaiah Harmon, and the Savage, created by Keara \\u201cKeke\\u201d Wilson, older moves that have yet to be co-opted by the cyberspace mainstream: dances like the Tootsie Roll, which dates to the 69 Boys\\u2019 1993 track of the same name, and the Milly Rock, named in a 2011 song by Terrance \\u201c2 Milly\\u201d Ferguson. Also included in Chew\\u2019s mix are, to name just a few more, the Mop, the SpongeBob, the Whip, the Humpty, the Hammer Time, the Chicken Noodle Soup, the Robot, the Butterfly, the Tom & Jerry, the Snake and the Sprinkler.\", \"Chew is unconcerned that the paintings take time and effort to figure out. \\u201cOnce I got to grad school, I stopped spelling stuff out so much,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIf you really want to know, you\\u2019ll go search for it.\\u201d He continues, \\u201cThat\\u2019s what I noticed about fine art, or art that is memorable. It just is what it is and if you want to know more, you go and do that.\\u201d In other words, if you know, you know. And Chew will continue figuring things out for himself, too \\u2014 he plans to explore vernacular from other parts of California and, eventually, other parts of the country. \\u201cI always refer to myself as a kind of rapper in my head, because I\\u2019m playing with words,\\u201d he says. \\u201cRappers are like Picasso with their words. I feel like I\\u2019m the reverse: I\\u2019m Jay-Z with a paintbrush.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b4340a5c82e011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b4340a5c82e011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
