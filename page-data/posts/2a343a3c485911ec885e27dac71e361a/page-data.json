Many of their families have been campaigning for justice since 2010.\", \"It is hard to find anyone on the streets of Greymouth who was not affected in some way by the devastating explosion.\", \"Police revealed this week they had recovered images from the boreholes that confirm two bodies, possibly three in the furthermost reaches of the mine.\", \"Some said the footage and the investigation was long overdue and that it marked an important milestone for the families.\", \"\\\"If they can go and get the boys out, that'd be really good and if there's any skullduggery those people should be held accountable,\\\" one man said.\", \"\\\"My father was a survivor of the Strongman explosion that happened, when 19 got killed in there, and so there's a lot of feeling that we would like to get the sons out if we can.\\\"\", \"Many did not want to comment, some saying the tragedy has divided the town with one calling it a grey cloud that was yet to move on.\", \"Others say the men are in their final resting place and that was where they should stay.\", \"\\\"I feel for the families, I really do my heart goes out to them all, but I myself think they should just leave them at rest,\\\" one said.\", \"A woman in her 80s said \\\"we don't bury people in the workplace\\\", that the police should not have interfered after the explosion and if it was up to her, she would have gone in to retrieve the men herself.\", \"Grey District mayor Tania Gibson said the release of the footage came as a shock for many two days before the 11th anniversary of the explosion.\", \"\\\"It has been quite a shock to our community and the families, it has bought it back up,\\\" Gibson said.\", \"\\\"We are really close to the anniversary, it's tomorrow, so it's very hard for our community at the moment to take it in.\\\"\", \"Many families hoped the new footage brought police a step closer to laying charges.\", \"Sonya Rockhouse's two sons were in the mine in the explosion.
