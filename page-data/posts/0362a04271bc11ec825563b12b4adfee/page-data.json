Trump who have adopted a hostile stance toward the panel\\u2019s questions.\", \"In an effort to dig into the role that members of Congress played in trying to undermine the 2020 election, the committee informed Mr. Jordan in December by letter that its investigators wanted to question him about his communications related to the run-up to the Capitol riot. Those include Mr. Jordan\\u2019s messages with Mr. Trump and his legal team as well as others involved in planning rallies on Jan. 6 and congressional objections to certifying Joseph R. Biden Jr.\\u2019s victory.\", \"Mr. Jordan \\u2014 who in November told the Rules Committee that he had \\u201cnothing to hide\\u201d regarding the Jan. 6 committee\\u2019s investigation \\u2014 on Sunday denounced the bipartisan panel\\u2019s inquiry as among what he called the Democrats\\u2019 \\u201cpartisan witch hunts.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt amounts to an unprecedented and inappropriate demand to examine the basis for a colleague\\u2019s decision on a particular matter pending before the House of Representatives,\\u201d Mr. Jordan wrote in a letter to Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and chairman of the committee. \\u201cThis request is far outside the bounds of any legitimate inquiry, violates core constitutional principles and would serve to further erode legislative norms.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Jordan was deeply involved in Mr. Trump\\u2019s effort to fight the election results, including participating in planning meetings in November 2020 at Trump campaign headquarters in Arlington, Va., and a meeting at the White House in December 2020.\", \"On Jan. 5, Mr. Jordan forwarded to Mark Meadows, Mr. Trump\\u2019s chief of staff, a text message he had received from a lawyer and former Pentagon inspector general outlining a legal strategy to overturn the election.\", \"\\u201cOn Jan. 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as president of the Senate, should call out all the electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all \\u2014 in accordance with guidance from founding father Alexander Hamilton and judicial precedence,\\u201d the text read.\", \"Mr. Jordan has acknowledged speaking with Mr. Trump on Jan. 6, though he has said he cannot remember how many times they spoke that day or when the calls occurred.\", \"Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming and the vice chairwoman of the committee, has said that Mr. Jordan is a \\u201cmaterial witness\\u201d to the events of Jan. 6.\", \"In Mr. Jordan\\u2019s letter on Sunday, he argued he had little relevant information to share with the committee and that its members should be investigating security failures at the Capitol instead of seeking to question Republican lawmakers.\", \"\\u201cEven if I had information to share with the select committee, the actions and statements of Democrats in the House of Representatives show that you are not conducting a fair-minded and objective inquiry,\\u201d he said, accusing the panel of altering documents to mislead the public.\", \"Tim Mulvey, a spokesman for the House committee, said in response to the letter: \\u201cMr. Jordan has admitted that he spoke directly to President Trump on Jan. 6 and is thus a material witness. Mr. Jordan\\u2019s letter to the committee fails to address these facts. Mr. Jordan has previously said that he would cooperate with the committee\\u2019s investigation, but it now appears that the Trump team has persuaded him to try to hide the facts and circumstances of Jan. 6.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Mulvey added that the committee would respond to the letter in more detail in the coming days and consider next steps. The committee has been reluctant to issue subpoenas for sitting members of Congress, preferring to gather evidence from them through a voluntary process. However, Mr. Thompson has said the panel would subpoena lawmakers if it deemed that necessary.\", \"Representative Scott Perry, a Pennsylvania Republican who is close to Mr. Jordan, last month refused a voluntary meeting with the committee, calling the panel \\u201cillegitimate.\\u201d\", \"A growing number of potential witnesses have also sued the committee to try to block its subpoenas for phone and bank records, though more than 300 witnesses have willingly met with the panel\\u2019s investigators.\"]","href_hash":"0362a04271bc11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0362a04271bc11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
