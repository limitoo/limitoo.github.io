The vote came just one day after the nine members of the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack unanimously voted to recommend contempt charges for Meadows.\", \"\\\"The select committee's report referring Mr. Meadows for criminal contempt charges is clear and compelling,\\\" said Committee Chair Representative Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) said prior to the full House vote. \\\"As White House chief of staff, Mr. Meadows played a role in or was witness to key events leading up to and including the January 6th assault on the United States Capitol.\\\"\", \"\\\"When the records raise questions \\u2013 as these most certainly do \\u2013 you have to come in and answer those questions.

Terwilliger III.\", \"The unprivileged information that Terwilliger referred to included a series of text messages that Meadows received on the day of the insurrection.\", \"These included messages from Republican politicians, multiple Fox News anchors, and even the former president's son, Donald Trump Jr., urging Meadows to implore Trump to call off the riot.\", \"Thompson stated that the GOP politicians who had contacted Meadows on January 6 included a number of House members, some of who may have possibly voted on the contempt charge.\", \"Thompson added that the committee would make a decision on releasing the politicians' names within a week.\", \"Meadows became the second former Trump official, after former chief strategist Steve Bannon, to be held in contempt by the House. Bannon was indicted in November after ignoring a similar congressional subpoena and later turned himself in to the authorities.\", \"Beyond Bannon and Meadows, another Trump ally, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, was going to be held in contempt by the committee for similar charges.\", \"However, as Clark has stated that he plans on pleading the Fifth Amendment, the committee has said that it is giving him one more chance to change his mind before voting on a contempt charge.\", \"The deposition in which Clark will have an opportunity to testify, if he chooses, is scheduled for Thursday.\"]","href_hash":"167f43f85d6011ec9944bf9bde89c509"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"167f43f85d6011ec9944bf9bde89c509"}},
