The day started at the crack of dawn. Students and troopers were paired up to compete in activities such as biking, rowing and climbing.\\u00a0\", \"Sixteen-year-old Seth De Matas was paired with trooper Mike Guenther. \\\"He's a little bit smaller than me,\\\" De Matas said of his first impression of Guenther. At 5 feet and 7 inches, Guenther is smaller, but can bench almost twice his partner's weight.\\u00a0\", \"De Matas said he doesn't trust law enforcement \\\"because of the recent stories and basically the influence that I'm growing up in, as dark-skinned male and tall. I'm not programmed to trust the police.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Guenther said the troopers are trying to fix that. \\\"We're here to build this relationship with the community,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"It's a relationship headmaster Father Edwin Leahy wants to nourish to improve the fabric and future of their community.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I hope that they talk,\\\" he said. \\\"Kids talk to kids in their neighborhood, and say, 'You know what?
