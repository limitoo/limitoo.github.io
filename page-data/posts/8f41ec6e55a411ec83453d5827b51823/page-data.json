He had been convicted 15 years earlier in connection with the shooting deaths of three Birmingham police officers \\u2014 and ever since had been rechristened Cop Killer Nathaniel Woods.\", \"But Mr. Woods never killed anyone. He was unarmed when the officers were gunned down while rushing into a cramped drug house to execute a warrant for his arrest on a misdemeanor.\", \"Alabama \\u2014 one of 26 states where an accomplice can be sentenced to death, according to the American Civil Liberties Union \\u2014 argued that Mr. Woods had intentionally lured the officers to their deaths. It did not have to prove that he actually killed anyone in seeking his conviction for capital murder.\", \"The Death Penalty Information Center estimates that of the country\\u2019s 1,458 executions between 1985 and 2018, 11 involved cases in which the defendant neither arranged nor committed murder. Even rarer are cases in which the person was unarmed and uninvolved in a violent act, such as a robbery \\u2014 cases like that of Mr. Woods, whose defenders say he had no foreknowledge of the violence to unfold and fled in terror as the bullets flew.\", \"\\u201cNathaniel Woods is 100% innocent,\\u201d another death-row inmate, Kerry Spencer, wrote in a letter in support of Mr. Woods. \\u201cI know this to be a fact because I\\u2019m the man that shot and killed all three of the officers.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Woods \\u2014 whose case is the subject of a new documentary by The New York Times, \\u201cTo Live and Die in Alabama\\u201d \\u2014 was a Black man living in the Black-majority city of Birmingham. But only two of the dozen jurors hearing his case were Black.

It has the country\\u2019s highest number of death-row inmates per capita and is the only state that does not require jury unanimity in recommending death.\", \"After brief deliberations, the jury had voted, 10 to 2: Death.\", \"In the annals of capital punishment, Mr. Woods is not the most sympathetic figure: a drug dealer whose evasive actions led to three deaths; who taunted one of the widows in a letter; who refused to show compassion, even at his sentencing. Still, just as jurors struggled with reading Mr. Woods\\u2019s impassive facial expression, so too does the law struggle with measures of punishment. How could it be that the armed man who killed three officers continues to live, while the unarmed man who fled dies?\", \"\\u201cThe tragedy is that people like Nathaniel Woods become victims of our indifference to injustice,\\u201d said Bryan Stevenson, the executive director of the Equal Justice Initiative, a human rights organization based in Alabama.

The surrounding empty lots and vacant storefronts told the familiar American story of steel and prosperity moving out and drugs and crime moving in.\", \"Mr. Woods was a clerk in a 24-hour drug operation run by his cousin Tyran Cooper, who went by Bubba. His job: Collect the money and hand over the drugs.\", \"\\u201cA good dude,\\u201d Mr. Cooper said.\", \"Mr. Woods spent his early childhood in Tuscaloosa, nursing stray animals and teasing his younger sisters, Heavenly and Pamela, who still call him by his nickname Quail. But they say the familial mirth all but ended when their parents split up, partly because their mother used beatings to keep them in line.\", \"\\u201cI told the police if I can\\u2019t whoop their ass, then they need to take them to jail or take me, because ain\\u2019t no child going to run my house when I\\u2019m getting up and going to work two jobs taking care of them,\\u201d their mother, also named Pamela Woods, said. \\u201cAnd all I get is, \\u2018You mean, you hateful, you abuse us.\\u2019\", \"\\u201cNo, I whipped them,\\u201d she added. \\u201cIf I abused them, they would have had marks.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Woods left school after the sixth grade and eventually moved to Birmingham to live with his father, Nathaniel Woods Sr. He developed a knack for electronics, able to revive a dead television, as well as a knack for trouble, with arrests for burglary, reckless driving and public drinking.\", \"He got a job driving a forklift at a Piggly Wiggly warehouse, where his father was a foreman, but it didn\\u2019t stick. Now he was 28, with three young children and a job selling drugs in an operation taking in $3,000 a day.\", \"His work partner and friend Kerry Spencer, 23, had followed a similar path. He, too, had left school, had worked at the Piggly Wiggly warehouse and had young children. But he was also snorting $350 worth of cocaine a day, and was usually armed.\", \"This wasn\\u2019t warehouse work, after all. Just two months earlier, in April 2004, their boss, Mr. Cooper, had helped set a Birmingham corner aglow with gunfire during a dispute that left two people wounded. He was arrested a short while later in his bullet-riddled white Buick.\", \"For all the drugs and bullets, life at the 18th Street apartment passed without police interruption, Mr. Spencer would later testify. \\u201cEveryone around us was getting busted, but we never got touched,\\u201d he would say.\", \"Except the police were now at the back door.\", \"Officer Carlos Owen, 58, was a Birmingham Police Department fixture assigned to patrol the Ensley streets he knew so well. Though he was a graying grandfather with plans to retire in two years, everyone called him by a nickname based on an old hairstyle: Curly.\", \"In his 26 years on the job, he had been shot at three times, bitten by a dog once and involved in too many chases to remember. He had led the police union and been repeatedly honored for his police work, including as Officer of the Year in 2002.\", \"\\u201cHe epitomized the community policing idea,\\u201d Bill Lowe, an Ensley business owner, would later tell The Birmingham News. He added: \\u201cHe knew where the good guys were and where the bad guys were.\\u201d\", \"Others praised Officer Owen as strict but fair.\", \"\\u201cHe was good to me,\\u201d said Lou Lou Chatman, 60, a self-described former drug dealer. \\u201cA couple of times he could have took me to jail. And even if he had to take you to jail, he would pull over and let you get rid of everything on you.\\u201d\", \"Looming beside Officer Owen at the back door was Officer Harley Chisholm III, a few days short of his 41st birthday. His on-the-job enthusiasm, coupled with his six-foot-four frame and wraparound sunglasses, had earned the six-year police veteran and former Marine a nickname of his own: RoboCop.\", \"\\u201cHe knew when to police from the book and police from his heart,\\u201d one of his sisters, Starr Chisholm Sidelinker, wrote to The New York Times. \\u201cHe chose to work in one of the bad-ass areas to help make it a better place for the community.\\u201d\", \"Officer Chisholm had been both honored and disciplined for his police work. In 2002, a year after being named the West Precinct\\u2019s officer of the year, he was suspended after admitting to opening a woman\\u2019s car trunk, dousing some baby clothes with beer from bottles he had broken, and destroying a television set in the vehicle with a knife.\", \"Curly and RoboCop, the patrolling guardians of Ensley. Some in the neighborhood respected them, some feared them, and some \\u2014 including Mr. Woods\\u2019s employer and cousin, Bubba Cooper \\u2014 considered them corrupt.\", \"In a 2012 affidavit, and again in an interview this summer with The Times, Mr. Cooper claimed to have paid protection money to Officers Owen and Chisholm for years \\u2014 with weekly payoffs of as much as $1,000 usually made at a local steakhouse called Niki\\u2019s West. In return, he said, they suppressed local competition and tipped him off to the buy-and-bust operations of narcotics officers.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s how I was able to operate so long,\\u201d he told The Times.\", \"But Mr. Cooper said that after he was arrested on attempted murder charges \\u2014 in connection with that shooting spree in April 2004 \\u2014 the two officers raised their price to $3,000 a week. At that point, he said, he stopped paying them for protection.\", \"Others who lived in Ensley, including some involved in the drug trade at the time, told similar stories about the two officers. But neither man was ever formally accused of corruption, according to Annetta Nunn, the police chief at the time.\", \"\\u201cWhere is the proof?\\u201d she asked.\", \"Mr. Owen\\u2019s daughter, Andrea Elders, dismissed the allegations against her father \\u2014 who, she said, used to deliver bicycles to disadvantaged children in Ensley \\u2014 as untruths concocted after his death by local criminals.\", \"\\u201c\\u2018Oh, he was a crooked cop,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Elders said with derision. \\u201cNo, he wasn\\u2019t. Twenty-six years on the police force, he was not a crooked cop. You would think if he was, it would have come out.\\u201d\", \"The screen-door standoff was the culmination of escalating tensions that day at the 18th Street apartment. There had already been one previous encounter, if not two.\", \"Mr. Spencer and Mr. Woods later claimed that Officer Owen first appeared at the apartment around dawn, pulling up in his truck on his way to the West Precinct building a half-mile away. Police records indicate that he reported to work at 6:30 that morning.\", \"They said that he kicked at the door, demanding to talk to Bubba, before finally leaving.\", \"But this account could not be verified, and another witness later testified that neither Mr. Woods nor Mr. Spencer was at the apartment early that morning, though she said someone later told her that Officer Owen had indeed stopped by.\", \"There is no question that Officers Owen and Chisholm arrived at the apartment around 10:30 that morning \\u2014 to check on stolen cars, they said \\u2014 and that they got into a heated argument with Mr. Woods and Mr. Spencer.\", \"The two sides swapped obscenities and threats that centered on hiding behind a badge and hiding behind a door. \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t a friendly conversation,\\u201d Mr. Spencer later testified.\", \"At some point, Officer Owen briefly removed his badge. At some point, Mr. Woods gave his name because, his defenders say, he believed he had done nothing wrong.\", \"Before the officers left the scene, they used the patrol-car computer of Officer Michael Collins, who had arrived in the midst of the confrontation, to run Mr. Woods\\u2019s name through criminal databases. The drug dealers, meanwhile, began hiding their paraphernalia \\u2014 in anticipation.\", \"Mr. Spencer said that he then took a pill, drank a Bud Lite and went to sleep. Beside him: a semiautomatic rifle he had recently acquired in exchange for $35, a handgun and a half-gram of cocaine.\", \"Less than three hours later, the police received confirmation by phone that Mr. Woods was wanted in nearby Fairfield on a misdemeanor assault charge related to a four-month-old domestic disturbance - eliciting a \\u201cWoohoo\\u201d from Officer Chisholm. This time, four police officers pulled up to the 18th Street apartment: Mr. Owen, Mr. Chisholm, Mr. Collins and Charles Robert Bennett.\", \"Now Officer Owen was at the back door again, telling Mr. Woods through the screen that there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest and to come outside. Mr. Woods profanely refused.\", \"When Officer Chisholm was summoned from the front yard to confirm the warrant\\u2019s existence, Officer Collins later said, Mr. Woods cursed again and ran deeper into the small apartment, where the covered windows cast the drug-house clutter in eternal dusk. Officer Chisholm rushed in after him, followed by Officers Owen and Collins.\", \"Some of what happened next is in dispute: whether the police used pepper spray; whether the police drew their guns. But there is no doubt of the sudden explosion of violence that followed, detailed by Mr. Spencer in a cellphone video recorded from death row last year.\", \"He said that he woke up to commotion, looked out a window to see a police car and then saw Mr. Woods stumbling out of the kitchen, holding his face as if in pain \\u2014 perhaps from pepper spray. Then, seeing movement, he opened fire with his semiautomatic, killing Officers Chisholm and Owen. One bullet nicked Officer Collins as he fled out the back door.\", \"\\u201cI was so shocked,\\u201d Mr. Woods later told the police. \\u201cAnd I was hollering, telling him to stop, stop, stop.\\u201d\", \"Then Officer Bennett \\u2014 33 and married, with a 4-year-old daughter \\u2014 came through the front door and, Mr. Spencer said, \\u201cI hit him like three times.\\u201d\", \"Amid the gunfire, Mr. Woods scrambled out the bathroom window and started to flee, passing Officer Bennett lying on the ground. \\u201cHe said, \\u2018Uh, I been hit,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Woods told the police. But he kept running.\", \"Mr. Spencer said he went to the back door and sprayed a patrol car with bullets to scare off Officer Collins. As he ran out the front door, he sensed that the gravely wounded Officer Bennett was trying to grab his leg. He shot him in the head.\", \"An anxious but determined manhunt followed, with crouched officers searching alleys and houses with guns drawn. Mr. Woods watched the activity while sitting on a porch diagonally across from the apartment, as if the drama had nothing to do with him. He surrendered when identified, convinced that he would be fine because he hadn\\u2019t killed anyone.\", \"\\u201cI won\\u2019t shoot no police officer,\\u201d he would say while being interrogated later that day. \\u201cAin\\u2019t do nothing like that. That ain\\u2019t, that ain\\u2019t me.\\u201d\", \"A memorial plaque hangs inside the Birmingham Police Department\\u2019s West Precinct building in Ensley. It depicts in bas-relief the likeness of three police officers killed in the line of duty. Carlos Owen, grandfather. Harley Chisholm III, former Marine. Robert Bennett, young father.\", \"Whenever their former police chief, Annetta Nunn, sees the memorial, she is instantly returned to that hot afternoon of June 17, 2004. To that 18th Street apartment.\", \"\\u201cBennett was the youngest,\\u201d Ms. Nunn said. \\u201cAnd, you know, looking in his eyes just reminds me of that day, because his eyes were partially opened when I saw him. It just brings that memory back, seeing his eyes.\\u201d\", \"The deaths staggered Alabama. A year later, it was time to prosecute the two men charged with causing those deaths.\", \"The gunman, Kerry Spencer, was convicted first. In presenting a case of self-defense, his lawyer, Michael Blalock, apparently raised enough doubt about what the police were doing at the apartment that the jury recommended life without parole, rather than the death penalty.\", \"\\u201cSomething\\u2019s going on that shouldn\\u2019t be going on, bottom line,\\u201d Mr. Blalock said in an interview. \\u201cAnd I think the jurors picked up on it.\\u201d\", \"But Alabama at that time allowed judges to overrule jury recommendations \\u2014 which Judge Tommy Nail of the Jefferson County Circuit Court did by sentencing Mr. Spencer to death. \\u201cMay God have mercy on your soul,\\u201d the judge said.\", \"A month later, in October 2005, Mr. Woods stood trial on the same capital murder charges for which Mr. Spencer had just been convicted.\", \"\\u201cMost people think that you can only get the death penalty for murders that you are responsible for, in the sense that you committed the killing or you paid somebody to commit the killing,\\u201d said Robert Dunham, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center. But he said that the Supreme Court permitted a person to be sentenced to death \\u201cif you had \\u2018reckless disregard\\u2019 for the life of the victim and were a major participant in the underlying felony.\\u201d\", \"Still, Mr. Woods\\u2019s lawyers had confidence in their case. He never fired a shot, he didn\\u2019t have a gun and even the shooter, Mr. Spencer, said Mr. Woods had nothing to do with the killings.\", \"True, Mr. Woods had talked trash about the police and had challenged Officer Owen to a fight. \\u201cMakes him guilty of having a big mouth,\\u201d his lawyer, Cynthia Umstead, told the jury. \\u201cMakes him guilty of stupidity for saying that. Does not make him guilty of capital murder.\\u201d\", \"But prosecutors challenged the premise that the shooting was unplanned by portraying Mr. Woods as a police-hating criminal who had purposely led the officers to their deaths in the tight apartment.\", \"\\u201cThey wanted them trapped,\\u201d a prosecutor, Mara Sirles, said. Mr. Woods \\u201cwas the bait,\\u201d she said. \\u201cKerry Spencer was the hook.\\u201d\", \"Three officers had died because Mr. Woods refused to cooperate with a simple, legitimate arrest warrant, Ms. Sirles said. And, under the law, he was just as culpable for their deaths as the gunman.\", \"Throughout, Mr. Woods\\u2019s flat expression invited interpretation. At least one white juror believed that the defendant tried to intimidate the jury with his stare. But a Black alternate juror, Christina Bishop, saw only defeat.\", \"\\u201cHis demeanor was just as serious as the crime that he was being charged with,\\u201d said Ms. Bishop, a retired postal worker who, as an alternate juror, was excused before the votes on conviction and sentencing were taken.\", \"Mr. Woods was convicted of all counts, after which a couple of jurors questioned the rigor of his legal team\\u2019s defense. Then came the sentencing phase, with Mr. Woods\\u2019s unapologetic defiance cast in a damning light.\", \"Prosecutors presented a piece of paper taken from his prison cell, on which he had rewritten the lyrics of a rap song by Dr. Dre to include the line, \\u201cI drop pigs like Kerry Spencer.\\u201d\", \"They presented a taunting letter that Mr. Woods had sent to Officer Chisholm\\u2019s widow shortly after his conviction. \\u201cThis is a good friend of yours, yes Gurl it\\u2019s me \\u2018Nathaniel Woods,\\u2019\\u201d he began, before maintaining his innocence and saying that he didn\\u2019t give a damn what she and other family members \\u201cthink, want or are seeking.\\u201d\", \"Prosecutors also summoned the widows of the officers to give voice to their profound loss, and to assert that \\u2014 as Officer Owen\\u2019s wife, Bobbie, put it \\u2014 Mr. Woods \\u201cneeds the death penalty.\\u201d\", \"With the jury about to decide whether he should live or die, Mr. Woods took the stand. His lawyers had prepped him in how best to seek the jury\\u2019s mercy, Ms. Umstead later said, \\u201cbut when he got on the stand, it\\u2019s like he had never heard a word.\\u201d\", \"Asked by Ms. Umstead whether he had anything to say to the families of the dead officers, Mr. Woods responded:\", \"\\u201cWell, I really don\\u2019t have no feeling about the officers. I really didn\\u2019t have nothing to do with it, but if they feel they need to take my blood, then fine. If they be satisfied with that, then it\\u2019s fine.\\u201d\", \"His response flabbergasted one juror, Chris McAlpine, a loss-recovery specialist for an Alabama utility. \\u201cThat\\u2019s all he said,\\u201d he recalled. \\u201cAnd I remember sitting there going, \\u2018You\\u2019ve got to be kidding me. That\\u2019s the best you could come up with, knowing what we\\u2019re fixing to decide?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIf I could have just shaken him and said, \\u2018You need to come up with some kind of heartfelt something to give us,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. McAlpine said. \\u201cOh, I wanted to. If I could turn back time and do it, I would do it.\\u201d\", \"Another juror, Curtis Crane, a retiree, recalled feeling the full gravity of the jury\\u2019s responsibility. \\u201cYou ask yourself: What gives you the right to do this?\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou\\u2019re just a man; just a person. What gives you the right to tell somebody else they\\u2019ve got to die?\\u201d\", \"This fundamental question explains why, in 2005, nearly every state with a capital-punishment statute required a jury to be unanimous in recommending death. At the time, only Florida, Delaware and Alabama allowed for a non-unanimous jury recommendation of death; today, the practice continues only in Alabama, where 10 of a dozen jurors is considered sufficient.\", \"Deliberations were short \\u2014 less than two-and-a-half hours \\u2014 but intense. According to Mr. McAlpine, the vote came down to 10 jurors in favor of death, and two jurors, both Black women, opposed.\", \"They didn\\u2019t offer an explanation, he said. \\u201cIt was: \\u2018I just can\\u2019t do it.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Mr. Woods spent the next 15 years at the William C. Holman Correctional Facility, infamous for its violence and overcrowding. The state began shutting down most of the prison in early 2020, but it remains the place where Alabama\\u2019s condemned live and die.\", \"In those 15 years, 32 other men on Alabama\\u2019s death row were executed. One had killed a Montgomery police officer. Another had robbed and killed a married couple. Another had killed a family of four.\", \"Each man was put to death on a Thursday, always a Thursday. In the moments before his execution, those he left behind on death row would bang on their doors, in faint hope that he might hear their clatter of solidarity.\", \"All the while, Mr. Woods\\u2019s family fought to have his life spared. A succession of lawyers made a succession of desperate arguments, including that his legal representation during the trial and the appeals process had been deficient or negligent. None found purchase.\", \"As Mr. Woods swayed between hope and despair, he corresponded with family members. He wrote poetry. He converted to Islam. He waited.\", \"Finally, on Jan. 30, 2020, prison officials presented Mr. Woods with a one-page document to sign. It stipulated that he was to be executed on March 5 and advised him to provide contact information for a funeral home.\", \"No similar letter has been sent to Mr. Spencer. Unlike Mr. Woods, he managed to extend his life by opting for death by nitrogen hypoxia. The protocols for this untested gassing method have yet to be finalized in Alabama \\u2014 the only state to approve it \\u2014 which means that the man who killed three police officers would continue to live while his unarmed associate would die.\", \"A month before Mr. Woods\\u2019s scheduled execution, two unlikely advocates took up his case: Lauren Faraino, 30, a corporate lawyer with no experience in capital murder cases, and her mother, Elaena Starr, 60, who had recently ended her support of the death penalty after reading the 2018 memoir of Anthony Ray Hinton, who spent three decades on Alabama\\u2019s death row before being exonerated.\", \"Turning Ms. Faraino\\u2019s kitchen into a command center, they scoured court documents, interviewed witnesses and capitalized on the media contacts of Ms. Starr\\u2019s husband, Bart Starr Jr., the son of the Hall of Fame quarterback Bart Starr. Celebrities of varying fame and notoriety \\u2014 including Martin Luther King III, Kim Kardashian and the rapper T.I. \\u2014 were soon championing Mr. Woods\\u2019s cause.\", \"Ms. Faraino was troubled that more people seemed to pay attention to Mr. Woods\\u2019s story only when two affluent Southern white women got involved. \\u201cA person on death row should not live or die based on whether the \\u2018right\\u2019 activists, politicians and celebrities speak out on their behalf,\\u201d she said.\", \"Finally, March 5. The Thursday.\", \"It was a somber day for Andrea Elders, the daughter of Officer Carlos Owen. The thought of that evening\\u2019s execution did not fill her with joy \\u2014 though she felt that Mr. Woods deserved death for taking the life of a father whose last words to her had been, \\u201cI love you. I\\u2019ll talk to you in the morning.\\u201d\", \"No one in her family was cheering, she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just: He broke the law and made a bad choice and that was his punishment.\\u201d\", \"At about 4 p.m., Mr. Woods said his final goodbyes to his family and disappeared behind a door. By now, corrections officials were far down their 17-page list of execution procedures. The execution team had rehearsed. The intravenous equipment had been tested. The veins of the condemned man had been checked.\", \"Ms. Faraino, meanwhile, was frantically trying to have the 6 p.m. execution called off, in part by persuading a relative of one of the murdered officers to ask Alabama\\u2019s governor, Kay Ivey, for compassion.\", \"With less than an hour to go, Kimberly Chisholm Simmons, a sister of Officer Harley Chisholm, returned her call. \\u201cHe didn\\u2019t kill my brother,\\u201d Ms. Simmons told Ms. Faraino, according to a recording of their call. \\u201cHe was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Faraino began to cry. \\u201cIf I, if I can get you in touch with, with, someone at the governor\\u2019s office, would you convey that message to them?\\u201d she asked.\", \"\\u201cYes I will,\\u201d Ms. Simmons said.\", \"With Ms. Simmons still on the line, Ms. Faraino tried to reach the State of Alabama.\", \"\\u201cYou have reached the Alabama Department of Corrections.

With the death warrant expiring at midnight, the Supreme Court had six hours to decide Mr. Woods\\u2019s fate.\", \"At 7:35, word came that Governor Ivey had decided that clemency for Mr. Woods was \\u201cunwarranted.\\u201d A few minutes later, the Supreme Court lifted the stay, allowing the execution to proceed.\", \"There was nothing more to do. At 8:08, a disconsolate Ms. Faraino sent an email to one of the lawyers who had fought for Mr. Woods\\u2019s life. All it said was:\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s over Alicia.
