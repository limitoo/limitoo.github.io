Green program to promote refrigerants that will contribute to global warming.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-18T12:41:17.000Z","content":"[\"For over a decade the N.H.L. has promoted its commitment to the environment, using hockey\\u2019s birth on frozen ponds to connect the sport to the natural world and to portray its protection as a corporate imperative. But a new report questions that commitment and accuses the league of using its N.H.L. Green program to endorse refrigerants that will contribute to irreversibly warming the planet.\", \"The N.H.L. has a partnership with the chemical company Chemours that involves promoting Opteon, a group of refrigerants produced by Chemours that are used in chillers underneath the ice at rinks. A news release issued last month announced a multiyear renewal of the partnership, which began in 2018, saying the deal would provide \\u201cenvironmentally and economically sustainable refrigerant solutions\\u201d to ice rinks across North America.\", \"But Opteon refrigerants have a high global warming potential, especially compared with ammonia, a chemical that does not warm the planet and is already used in the chillers of thousands of ice rinks. Misleading marketing could prompt hockey rinks across the United States and Canada to adopt a refrigerant that worsens climate change, according to the report published Wednesday by the Environmental Investigation Agency U.S., a nongovernmental organization based in Washington, D.C.\", \"\\u201cThe N.H.L.-Chemours partnership poses serious ethical concerns by disseminating a dangerously misleading message that it is sustainable to choose a potent greenhouse gas over a refrigerant with zero climate impact,\\u201d says the report, which was reviewed in advance by The New York Times. \\u201cThe N.H.L. is using its prominent influence and platform to amplify this misinformation to communities and companies.\\u201d\", \"An N.H.L. spokesman said in an email on Tuesday that the league had not seen the report and declined to comment.\", \"An email from a Chemours spokesman said the company had also not yet seen the report. But based on what the Environmental Investigation Agency shared with the company ahead of publication, the Chemours spokesman said that the report appeared \\u201cmisleading,\\u201d and that it \\u201cmischaracterizes\\u201d the company\\u2019s products and describes its relationship with the N.H.L. inaccurately. Thom Sueta, the spokesman, said that the company\\u2019s products have \\u201cfavorable cost and safety profiles\\u201d and that the report would not deter its \\u201cefforts to help community ice rinks reduce their environmental footprint.\\u201d\", \"Though N.H.L. teams play in 32 high-profile arenas, the market Chemours is really targeting is the thousands of smaller ice rinks across North America. Once systems that use the company\\u2019s refrigerants are in those rinks, those systems are likely to be in place for a couple of decades, maintaining a market for Opteon.\", \"The news release announcing the extension of the partnership said that more than 200 rinks \\u2014 including those where the San Jose Sharks and the Colorado Avalanche play, as well as the Beijing arena that will host the ice hockey competition at the Winter Olympics early next year \\u2014 had switched to Opteon.\", \"The Environmental Investigation Agency calculates that if all of North America\\u2019s roughly 4,500 ice rinks switched to Opteon from ammonia, over their lifetime those systems would emit an amount of carbon dioxide equivalent to what would be generated by 15 coal-fired power plants in a year.\", \"Opteon refrigerants have names like XP10 and XP40 and are made of a blend of hydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, and hydrofluoroolefins, or HFOs. These are human-made compounds that are most commonly used in air-conditioning and refrigerator systems.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s a reason why these compounds have been targeted for phasedown, which is that they contribute to global warming and they\\u2019re very potent,\\u201d said Susan Solomon, a professor of atmospheric chemistry and climate science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \\u201cFor every pound of it that you emit, your impact on global warming is far greater than a pound of carbon dioxide.\\u201d\", \"HFCs have been targeted for reduction by treaties and laws around the world because they contribute to global warming, and more than 120 countries, including Canada, have signed on to a treaty committing to reduce their use. The Biden administration has introduced regulations to reduce HFC use by 85 percent over the next 15 years.\", \"Business-as-usual emissions of HFCs could increase global warming by as much as half a degree by the latter part of this century, Solomon said. To stave off the most catastrophic effects of global warming, scientists say, the world must prevent the global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels.\", \"Though ice rink refrigeration systems might ultimately play a small role in warming, Solomon questioned the N.H.L. and Chemours\\u2019s advocacy of HFCs at a time when the world is trying to rapidly move away from them.\", \"\\u201cPersonally, I love the Boston Bruins,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s hard for me to make a case that they should get a special exemption\\u201d if they were to seek to switch to a new refrigerant from the ammonia that currently chills TD Garden. \\u201cAnd,\\u201d Solomon added, \\u201cwhy can\\u2019t they go directly to compounds that are already being used as substitutes?\\u201d\", \"The N.H.L.\\u2019s sustainability messaging now prominently features Chemours chemicals, but it wasn\\u2019t always that way. A league-issued \\u201cGreener Rinks\\u201d infographic on refrigeration systems from before 2018 endorses ammonia and carbon dioxide as natural refrigerants, saying that ammonia refrigeration systems have \\u201csignificantly lower potential for ozone depletion and global warming\\u201d than HFCs and a predecessor, hydrochlorofluorocarbons, or HCFCs.\", \"Matthew Rigby, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Bristol in England, said that the HFC refrigerants currently being marketed by the N.H.L. \\u201cweren\\u2019t the worst,\\u201d especially compared with compounds that were commonly used at arenas in the past. \\u201cThey\\u2019re fairly nontoxic and they don\\u2019t deplete the ozone layer,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo obviously this is much more preferable, but they do still impact the climate.\\u201d\", \"The major concern about ice rink refrigeration and similar systems is that they tend to be very leaky, said Alex Hillbrand, an expert on HFCs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a nonprofit environmental group. \\u201cThat system has a bunch of connections, like metal to metal joints, which can leak,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe chiller vibrates significantly as it\\u2019s operating. And vibrations over time cause small gaps to form.\\u201d\", \"The refrigerants could also escape when these systems are ultimately disposed of, Hillbrand said, making it important for there to be programs in place to capture, collect and properly incinerate the gas.\", \"Most scientists look at how much a substance warms the planet over 100 years to understand its effect on the environment, which is called its global warming potential. While the Environmental Investigation Agency and Chemours differ slightly on the numbers, they broadly agree that the first of two refrigerants marketed as Opteon warms the atmosphere about 600 times more than the same mass of carbon dioxide over a 100-year period; the second warms the atmosphere in excess of 1,200 times more.\", \"Ammonia\\u2019s global warming potential is zero.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re pushing facilities away from ammonia,\\u201d Hillbrand said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s a step in the wrong direction.\\u201d\", \"Chemours contends that Opteon is mostly used to replace the more harmful chemicals in older ice chiller systems, and that it reduces the global warming potential of those systems anywhere from 20 to 80 percent. Sueta, the company spokesman, said that Opteon was cost efficient for rink operators, and that while ammonia has no global warming potential, its production requires the use of fossil fuels.\", \"In a warming world, demand for refrigeration systems may rise as owners of small ice rinks \\u2014 especially backyard versions that have traditionally relied on naturally freezing temperatures \\u2014 struggle to keep the ice intact.\", \"Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle is home to the N.H.L.\\u2019s newest team, the Kraken. Amazon bought the rights to name the building after its own environmental initiative. The arena is powered by renewable sources and has a goal of diverting 97 percent of its waste from landfills. Its operator has promised to buy credits to offset any carbon produced. Environmental considerations were front and center in almost every facet of the arena\\u2019s retrofit, which cost more than $1 billion.\", \"And its ice chilling system? It uses ammonia. Rob Johnson, the head of sustainability and transportation for the Kraken, said that environmental concerns influenced the team\\u2019s decision on which chilling system to buy and that the \\u201clower carbon footprint of an ammonia chiller compared to an HFC-based chiller was a consideration.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"bbc44e8f486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bbc44e8f486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}},
