Another Mary, a woman in a lobster suit. John Kane, a nervous mental patient in blue pajamas. And a nameless drummer who never speaks. These eccentric characters come together in Enda Walsh\\u2019s often baffling yet always arresting new play, \\u201cMedicine,\\u201d a presentation of Landmark Productions and the Galway International Arts Festival that opened at St. Ann\\u2019s Warehouse on Tuesday.\", \"John (Domhnall Gleeson) wanders onto the set, a drab room with the look of a community center hall (design by Jamie Vartan). It\\u2019s a mess \\u2014 the aftermath of a staff party, with streamers and balloons \\u2014 and John is concerned about it. He putters around, fidgeting and picking things up haphazardly.\", \"He\\u2019s preparing for the arrival of the two Marys (Aoife Duffin and Clare Barrett) and the drummer (Sean Carpio). They\\u2019re there at the institution to run through a script of John\\u2019s life, presumably as a kind of drama therapy.\", \"Once they arrive and their routine gets underway, the Marys don different costumes and lip sync a recording of dialogue from the people in John\\u2019s life, beginning with his parents on the day he was born. As John narrates, the Marys interrupt, to share notes and perform random dances while the drummer scores the scenes. But as John\\u2019s story unfolds, he becomes increasingly frazzled.\", \"Walsh, a celebrated playwright and director whose enigmatic works include \\u201cGrief Is the Thing with Feathers,\\u201d \\u201cArlington\\u201d and \\u201cRooms,\\u201d also writes and directs this play, which feels like a psychosexual absurdist fantasy. How long has John been here? What parts of this are real? Walsh is less concerned with providing answers than he is with making us sit with John\\u2019s mounting sense of desolation and shame. In this way, the work resembles a poem or an interpretive dance, resonating with symbols and gestures and feelings, and the rest is for the audience to puzzle through.\", \"John recounts abuse by his parents and peers when he was a child, and maltreatment at the hands of a worker at the institution. He scrutinizes his mother\\u2019s negligence and overt sexuality, and conflates his budding erotic desires as a teen with his yearning for maternal love and attention. All the while the narcissistic Lobster Mary (or Mary 2, as the script calls her) controls the performance: She harasses Mary 1 and bullies John.\", \"If that weren\\u2019t Freudian enough, Walsh plants recurring images and themes throughout, implying connections between John\\u2019s version of his past and the present moment with the actors.\", \"What the two Marys are doing here is its own theater \\u2014 a production that Mary 1 starts to suspect is cruel. As they step into and out of the personalities in John\\u2019s life, the lights shift with Earth, Wind & Fire\\u2019s \\u201cSeptember\\u201d playing. (Adam Silverman handles the mercurial lighting.)\", \"Barrett gives a menacing performance as Mary 2, who embodies some of the more brutal characters in John\\u2019s tale and aims her own shots of hostility at Mary 1 (Duffin, who appeared as Ophelia opposite Ruth Negga in \\u201cHamlet\\u201d at St. Ann\\u2019s Warehouse in 2020). Duffin\\u2019s Mary is empathetic, so much so that she inhabits John\\u2019s story, and at some point the voice-over of a character she\\u2019s playing overlaps with her voice as she speaks the same lines. The language here \\u2014 which Walsh writes with aureate poeticism, full of vivid imagery and pointed symbolism \\u2014 is what gives the show its melancholic beauty.\", \"Then there\\u2019s Gleeson himself, with his impressive performance. He is a chameleonic TV and film star (\\u201cHarry Potter,\\u201d \\u201cStar Wars,\\u201d \\u201cRun\\u201d) who can convey anything from a villainous sneer to a sensitive whimper with his entire physical bearing. Despite his height, Gleeson seems to wilt like a flower in want of sun. He nervously shuffles around the stage or gets worked into a frenzy \\u2014 huffing and flailing with explosive bravado, seamlessly accompanied by Carpio\\u2019s percussion. (Helen Atkinson handily controls the layered sound design.)\", \"There could easily be more Gleeson \\u2014 and by that I mean more of John\\u2019s perspective, because we get only snapshots of his life. By the end, John reasserts that he\\u2019s \\u201cnot like other people\\u201d and belongs in the institution. It seems John is a victim of a kind of manipulation; the drama therapy isn\\u2019t to help him but to gaslight him into believing he mustn\\u2019t ever try to seek freedom. Beneath all the oddities of Walsh\\u2019s script is a criticism of the ways in which society fails the mentally ill.\", \"It\\u2019s unclear whether Walsh is also indicting theater \\u2014 this is, after all, a play in which a play is used toward devious ends. So perhaps \\u201cMedicine\\u201d is simply a work of fanciful mysteries. Honestly, it doesn\\u2019t really matter. The emotional core of the show is always prevalent.\", \"By the end, John\\u2019s dejection feels as familiar as a phantom pain. He may still be within the same sad four walls where he began, but Walsh\\u2019s production transforms the space from one of isolation into one of empathy that even the audience can share. Because ultimately, a couple of doses of human connection is the best medicine anyone can ask for.\"]","href_hash":"40ff1142474b11ecb4d98b08d1ef0fb1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"40ff1142474b11ecb4d98b08d1ef0fb1"}},
