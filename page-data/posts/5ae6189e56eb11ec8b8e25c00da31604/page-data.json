Andrew Cuomo of New York.\", \"\\u201cThe way my time ended at CNN was hard,\\u201d Chris Cuomo, who has denied the misconduct allegation, wrote in a statement on Monday posted to his social media. \\u201cWhile I have a thick skin, I also have a family, for whom the past week has been extraordinarily difficult. So, right now, I have to take a step back and focus on what comes next. That means I will no longer be doing my SiriusXM radio show.\\u201d\", \"The live two-hour radio program \\u2014 \\u201cLet\\u2019s Get After It,\\u201d named for one of Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s on-air catchphrases \\u2014 began in 2018, shortly after he ascended to the coveted 9 p.m. spot on CNN. A spokesman for SiriusXM, Patrick Reilly, confirmed on Monday that Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s show would no longer air. \\u201cWe thank Chris for his work at SiriusXM,\\u201d Mr. Reilly said.\", \"SiriusXM is controlled by Liberty Media, whose billionaire chairman, John Malone, is one of the primary shareholders in Discovery Inc., the media company that could soon merge with CNN\\u2019s parent company, Warner Media, if the deal is approved by regulators. Mr. Malone would sit on the board of the new combined company.\", \"CNN fired Mr. Cuomo on Saturday, citing a review of his behind-the-scenes activities with his brother\\u2019s political team earlier this year, when the former governor was facing a series of sexual harassment allegations that ultimately led to his resignation.\", \"CNN also received a complaint last week from a lawyer representing a former junior colleague of Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s at another network. The complaint detailed an allegation of sexual misconduct against the anchor. Mr. Cuomo, through a spokesman, said \\u201cthese apparently anonymous allegations are not true.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cLet\\u2019s Get After It\\u201d aired on Monday with a guest host, the former ABC journalist Brian Ross.
