The Omicron coronavirus variant, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson said could lead to a \\u201ctidal wave\\u201d of cases, threatens to upend people\\u2019s best-laid festive plans. After last year, when the government imposed restrictions on household mixing on the cusp of Christmas, the possibility of yet another fractured Yuletide is close to retraumatizing the nation.\", \"Ominously, the Christmas tree the Norwegians give us every year to stand in Trafalgar Square, in thanks for Britain\\u2019s help during World War II, is notably spindly and bare this winter.\", \"To make matters worse, our responsible queen has been unwell. A royal biographer described her as entering a new phase, as if she were developing an obsession with goth aesthetics. And amid it all, Mr. Johnson\\u2019s government has sunk to new lows of corruption, sleaze and shrugging incompetence. The mood is far from merry.\", \"It was very different earlier in the year. The government rolled out vaccines faster than any other country in Europe, and Britain hosted the Group of 7 meeting and a global climate summit in November. Any adverse effects of Brexit could be blamed on the pandemic. Things felt shinier for a while, especially if you didn\\u2019t look too closely at the rising child poverty figures or the government\\u2019s plans to curtail protest, criminalize refugees and exert more control over the judiciary.\", \"But winter is here. New restrictions, called Plan B, are being rolled out. People in England are advised to work from home, and masks and Covid passes will be mandatory in more places. The rules, as ever under Mr. Johnson, feel arbitrary and ill thought out. Work from home, but go to the pantomime; wear a mask in a taxi but not in a pub. And we don\\u2019t know what further restrictions will be imposed as Omicron spreads. The problem is: Will people follow them when it is likely that Mr. Johnson \\u2014 if the past is any indication \\u2014 will not?\", \"After all, breaking restrictions is precisely what has landed him in trouble. In December last year, according to multiple sources, there was a party at 10 Downing Street, the prime minister\\u2019s official residence. At the time, parties were forbidden, and people were dying of Covid-19 in hospitals all over Britain, denied the comfort of their loved ones. That parties should come back to haunt Mr. Johnson is ironic, since we liked him for his levity. But levity, in a time of pandemic, is less charming than it once was.\", \"The details of the party have emerged inch by inch. Then last week, a video was leaked in which the prime minister\\u2019s advisers pondered how to answer media questions about the party. His spokeswoman Allegra Stratton, who has since resigned, giggled as she said, \\u201cThis fictional party was a business meeting \\u2014 and it was not socially distanced.\\u201d\", \"They all laughed. And in that laughter, it was horribly clear that Mr. Johnson\\u2019s tendency to surround himself with the inexperienced and entitled leaves a vacuum where a functioning government should be. Ms. Stratton was hired to be the voice of his government and to give a daily briefing in the American style. In the end, only one was broadcast \\u2014 and it was a rehearsal, a fake.\", \"There is every sign that the spell Mr. Johnson cast over the country is cracking, that people are waking up to the truth of him. The latest polls show the Conservative Party sliding to second place while Mr. Johnson\\u2019s approval ratings continue their descent. It feels a long time since the elections in December 2019, when the country gave him an enormous majority of 80 seats.\", \"In retrospect, the election campaign was explicitly romantic. Mr. Johnson\\u2019s highest-profile campaign advert was a parody of a scene from the film \\u201cLove Actually,\\u201d in which a man stands outside a married woman\\u2019s home and tells her, using written signs, that he loves her. (Yes, it\\u2019s creepy.) The signs in the ad were Brexit-related \\u2014 \\u201cWith any luck, by next year we\\u2019ll have Brexit done\\u201d \\u2014 but the meaning was clear. Mr. Johnson was a lover, and the country was seduced.\", \"Infatuations die hard but fast. Now two-thirds of the country does not trust him, and half thinks he should resign. The mood in his Conservative Party is, according to one member, \\u201csulfurous.\\u201d Even cabinet ministers believe he has imposed Plan B to distract from the \\u201cparty crisis.\\u201d Many Conservative legislators, furious at the prime minister, are planning to oppose the new restrictions. A local election on Thursday, caused by the resignation of a corrupt legislator Mr. Johnson had disastrously tried to save, might suggest how alienated Conservative voters are.\", \"Elsewhere, allegations of corruption continue to mount. There is a long-brewing scandal over the funding of the renovation of Mr. Johnson\\u2019s flat on Downing Street. (The redecoration was predictably garish.) Last week the Electoral Commission fined the Conservative Party 17,800 pounds, or about $23,500, for not accurately reporting the donations that paid for the refurbishment \\u2014 and the government standards adviser is reportedly considering resigning after apparently being misled by Mr. Johnson.\", \"If it all seems trivial, then so is Mr. Johnson. The country faces serious problems \\u2014 not just the pandemic and the fallout from Brexit but also an energy crisis, economic stagnation and vertiginous inflation. There is no sign that the prime minister can see, much less solve, them. A brinkman seeing how far he can go, he is too preoccupied with his survival. His address to the nation on Sunday night was a tellingly tired, perfunctory affair. It could have been an email.\", \"As we watch Mr. Johnson\\u2019s narrative play out, Britain feels like a country put on hold. We don\\u2019t know whether the prime minister can save himself, let alone Christmas.\"]","href_hash":"810c16745ca711ecb5c523254817464c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"810c16745ca711ecb5c523254817464c"}},
