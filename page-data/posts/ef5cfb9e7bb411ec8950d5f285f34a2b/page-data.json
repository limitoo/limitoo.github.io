That person has generated more than 30 locations of interest so far.\", \"The Ministry of Health also advised a third case of Omicron had been detected in Auckland and, despite it being an airport worker, there was no known connection with another airport employee previously diagnosed with Omicron.\", \"\\\"It's going to come, there's no doubt about it,\\\" Dr Lloyd said.\", \"\\\"People have got to be prepared. They have got to get their medicines in, work out a support plan, and ask how will your family or neighbourhood know you are all right.\", \"\\\"With these rapidly escalating numbers you need to know how to access care if needed.\\\"\", \"Southern medical officer of health Dr Susan Jack stressed that vaccination was the best protection against serious Covid-19 illness.\", \"\\\"With Omicron, people who are vaccinated may still have a mild illness, especially if they were vaccinated more than six months ago,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"A Covid-19 booster shot increases your protection against illness, which will also help to decrease spread.\\\"\", \"So far, 67,882 people in the Southern DHB area have received a booster, out of a possible 127,229 due.\", \"This week, the vaccine programme for five to 11 year olds began.
