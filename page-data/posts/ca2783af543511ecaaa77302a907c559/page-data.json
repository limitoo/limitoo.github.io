This is true, as well, of queer lives onscreen, where, until very recently, most narratives centered around death, whether it was the trans person too tragic to continue living \\u2014 either as a result of murder (\\u201cBoys Don\\u2019t Cry,\\u201d 1999) or suicide, a trope that has existed since \\u201cGlen or Glenda\\u201d (1953), one of the earliest films to highlight transgender issues \\u2014 or gay men felled by their own murderous impulses (\\u201cCruising,\\u201d 1980) and, later on, complications from AIDS, representations of which have regularly treated the disease as a form of punishment.\", \"Then there were lesbian characters. They, too, were subjected to countless onscreen deaths, from Tara on \\u201cBuffy the Vampire Slayer\\u201d in 2002 to Poussey on \\u201cOrange Is the New Black\\u201d in 2016, but queer women have also been disappeared in a different way: For nearly a century, affection between two women has often been depicted as unrequited, predatory, transient or otherwise unserious. Just think of the menacing, lonely Mrs. Danvers in Alfred Hitchcock\\u2019s \\u201cRebecca\\u201d (1940), a famously queer-coded character; or, on a lighter note, Roseanne Barr and Mariel Hemingway on the former\\u2019s sitcom in 1994, or Calista Flockhart and Lucy Liu on \\u201cAlly McBeal\\u201d five years later. All these stories seemed to argue that the ultimate tragedy of lesbianism was that it was a choice, and that smart women, wanting marriage and children, chose otherwise. Such \\u201clesbian kiss episodes,\\u201d as they\\u2019re derided today, were usually (and unsurprisingly) dreamed up by straight male Hollywood showrunners as a kind of titillation, according to Sarah Kate Ellis, 50, the chief executive officer of GLAAD, who says, \\u201cLesbian storytelling has historically been told through the eyes of men and their experience of that, of their own desire.\\u201d\", \"Now, some two decades later, lesbian portrayals onscreen are finally starting to become deeper, more varied and more inclusive, moving beyond the aspirational (mostly rich, mostly white) women who dominated programs like Showtime\\u2019s \\u201cThe L Word,\\u201d which debuted in 2004, or Todd Haynes\\u2019s 2015 film, \\u201cCarol,\\u201d based on \\u201cThe Price of Salt,\\u201d Patricia Highsmith\\u2019s 1952 novel of mannered glances, and starring Cate Blanchett as a housewife who must choose between her female love and her daughter.\", \"In the past two years, there have been \\u201cThe Wilds\\u201d (2020), Sarah Streicher\\u2019s Amazon Prime video series about a group of teenage girls that doesn\\u2019t overly conflate coming out with conflict, as well as indie films like C\\u00e9line Sciamma\\u2019s \\u201cPortrait of a Lady on Fire\\u201d (2019) and Miranda July\\u2019s \\u201cKajillionaire\\u201d (2020), wherein love stories orbit around mutual desire rather than shared sexual frustration. In late 2019, when Showtime rebooted \\u201cThe L Word,\\u201d the show was celebrated by fans for its more diverse cast \\u2014 and more authentic writing, which didn\\u2019t shy away from the realities of menstruation, cunnilingus or seething jealousy. Gone was the tragic lesbian, forced to choose between love and a full life; instead, we got unpredictable, messy, complicated lesbian lives. \\u201cThe ultimate privilege is being able to do anything we want,\\u201d says its 36-year-old showrunner, Marja-Lewis Ryan. \\u201cWe\\u2019re getting closer to being able to have characters who are deeply [flawed] and not have them represent all of us.\\u201d\", \"And what is the point of queer representation if not that? Not just that there\\u2019s less death and despair, or that there are happier endings, but that the misery and pathos of life is rendered with more complexity, because everyday life is sometimes miserable, too. \\u201cIt\\u2019s so important to us to have characters [being] weird and crazy,\\u201d says the queer writer, producer and actor Lena Waithe, 37, when discussing the BBC thriller \\u201cKilling Eve,\\u201d soon to air its fourth season, which has thus far subverted the \\u201cwill they, won\\u2019t they\\u201d clich\\u00e9s of the past \\u2014 and, too, the murderous impulses \\u2014 by layering each episode with chaotic, bizarre sexual tension.\", \"Waithe accomplished something similarly complex when, earlier this year, she co-wrote and starred in Season 3 of Netflix\\u2019s \\u201cMaster of None,\\u201d a five-episode arc that centered on two women who are selfish, who step out on each other, who watch their dreams crumble but still manage to move forward. After their marriage eventually fractures, they bend, break and then start to heal themselves, offering a radical depiction of queerness that both references decades of downtrodden lesbian narratives and yet somehow still feels hopeful. Making the piece was, as Waithe says, a matter of \\u201clife and death,\\u201d as much for herself as for the other L.G.B.T.Q. creators it might someday inspire. \\u201cWe spend our lives trying to fit into a world we don\\u2019t want to fit in,\\u201d she adds. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t need to.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ca2783af543511ecaaa77302a907c559"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ca2783af543511ecaaa77302a907c559"}},
