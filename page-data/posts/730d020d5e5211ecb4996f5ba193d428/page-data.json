The crisis exposes a failure of public policy and democracy. Democratic institutions with the responsibility to anticipate and swiftly tackle crises have failed to do their job.\\\"\", \"Home ownership rates have been falling for decades, and the rental housing stock is on average of poorer quality than those housing owner-occupiers.
