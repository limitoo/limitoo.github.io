The money will be donated to the APL Victory Fund, a fundraising committee consisting of Luna's official campaign fundraising account and the APL PAC, Florida Politics reported.\", \"Trump announced he will be backing Luna for Florida's 13th District in a statement in September, describing the Air Force veteran as a \\\"warrior.\\\"\", \"\\\"Anna Paulina Luna is a great fighter who is running for Congress in Florida. She is an Air Force veteran who puts America First, unlike her RINO [Republican in name only] opponents,\\\" Trump said.\", \"\\\"Anna is committed to strong borders, serving our Veterans, and ensuring Florida's beautiful coastlines are protected. This is an important race because it is 'key' to taking back the House.\", \"\\\"Anna is a warrior, she is a winner, and it's time for all America First Republicans to unite behind her strong campaign. Anna has my complete and total endorsement.\\\"\", \"Luna previously won the GOP nomination and ran against Rep.
