With \\u201cFrankie & Bug,\\u201d she takes her first swing at writing for a middle grade audience. And she knocks it out of the park.\", \"It\\u2019s 1987, and 10-year-old Beatrice (a.k.a. \\u201cBug\\u201d) is looking forward to spending her summer at Venice Beach in Los Angeles with her older brother, Danny. Unfortunately, Danny has no interest in babysitting Bug this summer as in years past. He wants his space. Bug\\u2019s single mom must work, so Bug resigns herself to spending the summer hanging out in her apartment building being watched by a variety of neighbors, including her mom\\u2019s best friend, Phillip, who lives on the top floor. Excitement arrives in the form of Phillip\\u2019s nephew from Ohio: 11-year-old Frankie, who has a \\u201ckitchen\\u201d haircut. At first, Bug is rather disappointed in Frankie because he doesn\\u2019t like to swim \\u2014 there\\u2019s literally nothing worse in her book than not liking the beach. Also, Frankie isn\\u2019t impressed with California, which is mystifying to Bug.\", \"They finally bond over their shared interest in the Midnight Marauder, a serial killer who is capturing daily headlines by terrorizing Los Angeles. They begin their own investigation, which mostly consists of keeping notes and visiting shady houses in the neighborhood. In between, they also do regular kid things like sell lemonade and roller-skate and have sleepovers. Forman is especially skillful in how she portrays the burgeoning friendship between the two children. It\\u2019s not all smiles and ice cream. Instead, Bug and Frankie\\u2019s relationship is laden with mistakes, hurt feelings and awkwardness. In short, it feels real. What begins as a disappointing summer for both children becomes so much more.\", \"In Forman\\u2019s capable hands, the setting of late \\u201980s Venice Beach is a living, breathing character. You can smell the coconut suntan lotion and hear Duran Duran playing in the background. Pizza is only a quarter a slice and Bug\\u2019s favorite ice cream stand is manned by her friend Bian, who fled Vietnam on a boat. (\\u201cNot a ship like on \\u2018Love Boat\\u2019 but like a rickety canoe.\\u201d) Then there are the colorful characters who populate the boardwalk: Speedo-wearing Zeus, the \\u201cgood punks\\u201d with spiky haircuts and the \\u201cbad punks\\u201d who are skinheads. Forman\\u2019s frank depiction of the AIDS epidemic \\u2014 something probably unknown to most young readers \\u2014 is especially poignant. It\\u2019s a part of history that begs to be discussed with kids today. Forman pulls no punches when it comes to showing the harsh reality of homophobia. Phillip is hospitalized after a violent gay-bashing attack. Yet Bug\\u2019s aunt\\u2019s homophobic comments about him are more shocking for their casual cruelty. Racism is also woven into the story. Bug learns that her late father, who was Salvadoran, was shunned by her mother\\u2019s disapproving family.\", \"The novel doesn\\u2019t end tidily like an after-school special. Frankie reveals to Bug that he is transgender \\u2014 his parents sent him to California for the summer to \\u201cget it out of my system\\u201d and return home a girl. Phillip says it best when he tells Bug: \\u201cLife is long. And people are complicated.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cFrankie & Bug\\u201d is a bittersweet coming-of-age story. It will linger long after you\\u2019ve finished it, like the final haunting notes of a song by the Cure playing on the radio in a cramped Datsun.\"]","href_hash":"ad745e6443da11ecbfaf2f41dabbb760"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ad745e6443da11ecbfaf2f41dabbb760"}},
