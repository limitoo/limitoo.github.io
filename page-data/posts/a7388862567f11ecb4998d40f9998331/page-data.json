The number 19 in its name stands for the 19th Arrondissement, which it abuts, and \\u2014 as everything Chanel always has a connection with its founder \\u2014 the Aug. 19, 1883, birthday of Gabrielle Chanel. As for the \\u201cM,\\u201d Chanel said it stands for m\\u00e9tiers, mode (fashion), mains (hands), manufactures and maisons \\u2014 all words related to craft.\", \"Designed by the French architect Rudy Ricciotti, perhaps best known for projects like the Mucem museum in Marseille and the Mus\\u00e9e Jean Cocteau on the Riviera, the sprawling complex is made of glass, iron and concrete and totals 25,000 square meters, or almost 270,000 square feet. It surrounds a 2,600-square-meter courtyard garden dotted with beehives and nesting boxes and planted with pines, linden trees, Japanese cherry trees, camellias and other greenery.\", \"Mr. Ricciotti said he tried to take into account \\u201ceverything that fashion is looking at today, morally and environmentally,\\u201d while designing the building.\", \"\\u201cI do contextual architecture; it\\u2019s always experimental and made-to-measure,\\u201d he said.\", \"Viewed from the street, the triangular building looks as if it has been wrapped with giant threads. But what the architect called \\u201ceco-structures\\u201d actually are 23-meter, or 75-foot, concrete supports that frame the outdoor walkways on each floor, creating handy shortcuts among the various ateliers.\", \"The embroiderer Lesage and its school, the feather specialist Lemari\\u00e9, the pleating specialist Les Ateliers Lognon and the goldsmith Goossens all moved to the complex from a smaller facility in a neighboring suburb, Pantin. They have been joined by Atelier Montex and Studio MTX, both embroidery houses; Maison Michel, millinery; Massaro, shoes; Paloma, which specializes in flou, or delicate fabrics; and Lesage Int\\u00e9rieurs.\", \"Eres, the lingerie and swimwear brand that is owned by Chanel but not part of the M\\u00e9tiers d\\u2019Art group, also has headquarters there.\", \"A pioneer in preserving the industry\\u2019s endangered suppliers, Chanel began acquiring craft companies and manufacturers under the direction of Karl Lagerfeld, its former creative director. Its first acquisition, in 1985, was the button and jewelry maker Desrues.\", \"How did Chanel decide which of its 40 specialists would move to 19M? Mr. Pavlovsky said geography was the determining factor: All 11 were based in Paris, Pantin or Aubervilliers. And some had been operating in picturesque but poorly lit, overstuffed and sometimes almost ramshackle ateliers inherited from another era.\", \"The trick, Mr. Pavlovsky said, was integrating them \\u2014 and their total of about 600 employees \\u2014 under one roof while also preserving their relative independence.\", \"(In addition to working for Chanel, the businesses execute commissions for rival couture houses including Dior, Valentino and Balenciaga; ready-to-wear houses like Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Lacoste; and independent fashion designers like Alexandre Vauthier, St\\u00e9phane Ashpool of Pigalle and Christopher Kane.)\", \"Mr. Ricciotti, the architect, echoed Mr. Pavlovsky, saying he, too, saw the businesses as \\u201cembodying the glory of French savoir-faire.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cFor me, they are the \\u201cmakers\\u201d of fashion. I have the utmost admiration for them, and I wanted to express that through the construction,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Ricciotti said he developed a modular, open-plan layout to leave as much room as possible for shared space, and studied each side of the structure to optimize natural daylight, but also to ensure workers would be protected from sun exposure and the resulting heat. The \\u201ceco-structures\\u201d were placed more closely together, to create shade, in areas expected to have greater sun exposure, he said.\", \"Yet in addition to offering more space and light, 19M was designed as a creative hub that would \\u201cgive a certain modernity to m\\u00e9tiers of the past that have a legitimate place in the creation of tomorrow,\\u201d Mr. Pavlovsky said. Connecting with younger audiences, through master classes, workshops, exhibitions and collaborations with local schools, is a priority, he added. A series of talks and other events open to the public are scheduled to begin next month.\", \"Mr. Pavlovsky declined to divulge details about 19M\\u2019s first events until after the fashion show, or to disclose the cost of the building itself. \\u201cAt Chanel, we have the luxury of not telling,\\u201d he said, allowing nonetheless that the investment was \\u201cnot small.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt was commensurate with our ambitions for the m\\u00e9tiers d\\u2019art and everything those houses bring to creation in Paris,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd there is a genuine economic reality behind them.\\u201d\", \"On a recent morning, despite a typically gray Paris sky, the 19M ateliers were bathed in light as teams readied lavish embroidery samples, camellias made of feathers, eco-friendly tweeds and panels of pleated chiffon for final approval by Virginie Viard, Chanel\\u2019s creative director.\", \"For Ms. Viard, showing the new M\\u00e9tiers d\\u2019Art collection at 19M \\u2014 the 2020 one was held at a chateau in the Loire Valley \\u2014 makes a statement about cultivating the heritage and power of French craftsmanship, and couture in particular. It is also a homecoming of sorts: She began her 34-year career with Chanel working on couture embroideries with Fran\\u00e7ois Lesage, the second-generation owner of the embroidery company that bears his family name. Chanel acquired it in 2002.\", \"\\u201cIt is a rare privilege being able to work as we do,\\u201d Ms. Viard wrote in an email.\", \"She said that a \\u201cdialogue\\u201d would be established with the specialty houses at the start of each M\\u00e9tiers collection. \\u201cThe samples are a starting point: either they are assigned to certain pieces, or they will inspire others,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cThere are no rules.\\u201d\", \"Demonstrating the contemporary side of feather work \\u2014 hand weaving, silk screening, laser-cutting and incorporating less conventional materials or new techniques like 3-D printing \\u2014 is a priority to keep the company moving forward, said Christelle Kocher, the artistic director at Lemari\\u00e9.\", \"\\u201cFifteen years ago, there was less interest in all these crafts, which can only be done by hand, with precision and passion,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThe fear was that they would be lost with the older generation. Our challenge was to shake things up and, through Virginie\\u2019s vision for Chanel, show that they can be modern and encourage a certain openness.\\u201d\", \"Samples displayed to a visitor recently included flora in feathers and hand-painted rhodoid plastic; origami and intricate pleating by Lognon. One swatch featured a camellia motif \\u2014 a Chanel signature \\u2014 woven, plume by plume, from feathers in 19 colors. Producing a single couture jacket with that weave could take as long as 1,200 hours, Ms. Kocher added.\", \"\\u201cWhat\\u2019s exciting is seeing how, season after season, these rare, age-old techniques can produce something new and innovative,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWith all the m\\u00e9tiers under one roof, the possibilities for creating a dialogue between past, present and future are pretty infinite.\\u201d\", \"In one Lemair\\u00e9 atelier across the hall, a 19th-century machine whirred as a worker fed ribbons of organza into it, turning out spaghetti-like strands on the far side. In another, baskets of duck, turkey, goose and ostrich feathers awaited a second life as flowers and other embellishments that, while not necessarily visible on the runway, bring rich detail and added movement to designs. Ms. Kocher said that all the feathers the company uses are responsibly sourced.\", \"In the Lognon workshop, several m\\u00e9tiers \\u2014 which, confusingly, also is the term for two pieces of cardboard that, with a piece of fabric in the middle, are folded by hand and then tightly bound to create pleats \\u2014 were arranged on industrial shelving like so many baguettes in a boulangerie. At a vintage worktable, two young women moved in tandem to hand-fold a m\\u00e9tier containing a panel of black chiffon into accordion pleats with, at its center, a double-C logo in relief.\", \"While every kind of pleating and material has its own recipe for being folded, wrapped and steamed, the one with the Chanel logo, developed this season, is the most complicated the studio has ever produced, said Sophie Dion, the manager of the atelier.\", \"There is no school for pleating, Ms. Dion added; everything is passed down to new workers in the studio. Perfecting a cardboard m\\u00e9tier, for example, can take as long as two weeks. That morning, the team was on its seventh try.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re always pushing beyond our comfort zone and trying something different,\\u201d she said, picking up a sample of pleated stone paper, the term for a sheet of strong bio-plastic material. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not unlike gold smithing.\\u201d\", \"In the Goossens jewelry atelier, its managing director, Gwena\\u00eblle Cr\\u00e9halet, said the house is creating a showroom within its 19M space to display various decorative objects developed for designers over the years, to better illustrate the kinds of techniques available. For the new M\\u00e9tiers d\\u2019Art collection, the studio had reinterpreted some of those objects as jewelry, including a famous portrait of Gabrielle Chanel and a lion designed for her by the house\\u2019s founder, Robert Goossens.\", \"In Lesage\\u2019s space, more than 70,000 embroidery samples, which the company says make up the largest collection of its kind in the world, are stored in built-in units. The earliest is said to date to 1858. As at Lemari\\u00e9, each sample produced is cataloged and preserved, whether or not it ever appears on a runway.\", \"It was here that generational renewal was perhaps most apparent, as 20-something embroiderers worked alongside colleagues who have been with the house for 30 years or more. The company said it takes approximately five years for a newcomer\\u2019s training to be complete.\", \"In the drawing department, Harsh Parekh, one of the designers, dusted chalk powder over some stencils, creating a pattern of delicate stippling on a piece of ultrafine chiffon. Embroidering the intricate black floral motif, composed of at least 10 elements and about five colors, would take several hundred hours.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s another energy between the maisons here; it\\u2019s almost like an arts hotel,\\u201d Mr. Parekh said, comparing the new building with Lesage\\u2019s previous location in Pantin.\", \"And as it turns out, the hotel is already full. Even so, Mr. Pavlovsky said there was still room to expand a bit.\", \"\\u201cFinding new tools and carving out a place for them to exist in the next 20 years is an endless endeavor,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not looking to the past; it\\u2019s a bet on the future.\\u201d\", \"When it comes to ultimate luxury, he added, \\u201cthere is always room in the Chanel universe.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a7388862567f11ecb4998d40f9998331"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a7388862567f11ecb4998d40f9998331"}},
