The association added that artificial trees, as well as live ones, would be likely to cost more this year due to the shortages.\", \"\\\"I would say half of what we planted last year is not going to survive,\\\" Geoff Wiley, a farmer at Trinity Tree Farm in Issaquah, Washington, told King 5 on Sunday.\", \"Christmas trees can take a decade to grow, depending on the type. Fortunately, many of Wiley's mature trees made it through the heatwave and he plans to replant more, but he said this damage may lead to more shortages in the coming years.\", \"Wiley added that he heard that other tree farms weren't as fortunate. \\\"It's horrible to watch it because you see it happening and then you can't do anything to control it and you have to wait and see how bad the damage is going to turn out to be,\\\" he said.\", \"A steady increase in consumer spending, as well as the heightened demand for the trees at this time of year, has added pressure to the industry, he added.\", \"\\\"We just get swamped with so many people and so the trees go faster and faster,\\\" Wiley said.\", \"Meanwhile the Riverview Christmas Tree Farm in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, has fewer trees available this year than usual. It is asking families to buy them soon to avoid missing out due to the shortages and they expect all their Christmas trees to be gone by December 1.\", \"\\\"It was kind of the perfect storm with the drought of 2012 killing the babies and then last two years we just really haven't gotten much rain in the summer so it's really limited growth of our current trees,\\\" Todd Gannon, owner of Riverview Christmas Tree Farm, told the KELO news channel on Sunday.\", \"He added that his farm\\u2014which receives Christmas trees from all over the country\\u2014has about 25 percent fewer trees available than usual.\", \"Gannon urged customers to be organized in the run-up to Christmas if they are looking to get a tree.\", \"\\\"Come early. We still have a really good supply right now there's still over a thousand trees ready to go home but by the end of Thanksgiving weekend, most of those will probably be gone,\\\" he said.\", \"Blossom Hill Orchard and Farm in Preston, Minnesota, said on Facebook Friday that it will not be selling Christmas trees this year due to shortages from its Wisconsin supplier.\", \"The global supply chain has been under pressure, as demand soars but the pandemic has caused labor shortages and manufacturing delays. This in turn has led to higher freight costs and longer delivery times.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937653/christmas-trees-new-hampshire.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Marko Novcic, 23, helps a couple pick out a Christmas Tree at North Pole Xmass Trees in Nashua, New Hampshire on November 21, 2021.
