About 83 million Americans will be affected by the mandate, with the stricter health care rule applying to around 17 million.\", \"The increase in \\\"fake vaccine card\\\" searches, which have risen by about 90 percent over the past day, mirrors the reaction in September when Biden first announced the vaccine mandate.\", \"According to a report by Check Point Research, the cost of fake cards bearing the logo of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention jumped from $100 on September 2 to $200 after the president's announcement a week later.\", \"The number of online sellers of bogus cards on Telegram, an encrypted messaging service, increased by a factor of 10, the study found.
