On Tuesday, McCallion admitted in court that he attacked the young girl with a knife at the complex where he also happened to live.\", \"\\\"McCallion punched her in the face, knocked her to the ground, placed her in a chokehold, and then attempted to gouge out her eyes with his thumbs,\\\" Westchester County District Attorney Miriam E. Rocah said at a press conference.\", \"When the victim attempted to escape and call for help, McCallion slammed her head into the concrete multiple times. He then stabbed her multiple times in the face, head, back, hands, and chest, while shouting racist and anti-semitic epithets toward her, according to the DA.\", \"The attack occurred in the parking lot in front of the apartment complex and the DA said residents had to witness the crime, including the victim's father. Police were quickly called to the scene and McCallion was arrested.\", \"The teenage victim suffered serious and lasting injuries including a collapsed lung, corneal abrasions to both eyes, and lacerations to her face, head and kidney.\", \"\\\"This was by any measure one of the most vicious and brutal violent attacks we have ever seen,\\\" Rocah said. \\\"Even worse, it was fueled by ignorance and hate.\\\"\", \"According to the Department of Justice, there were approximately 8,052 reported hate crimes in the United States in 2020. Of the reported cases, more than 61 percent were motivated by racial or ethnic biases. Of the reported offenders, about 55 percent were white according to the DOJ.\", \"When police searched McCallion's apartment, they found illegal weapons including two loaded assault weapons, as well as \\\"Nazi paraphernalia, a confederate flag, a gas mask, and a tactical vest.\\\"\", \"Rocah also said he was interested in \\\"white nationalist-type organizations\\\" and became radicalized through harmful rhetoric. She said that because of these factors, there is an important message to be learned from this case.\", \"\\\"This case must serve as a warning, as a wake-up call,\\\" Rocah said. \\\"About how vicious and divisive rhetoric and hateful propaganda can turn dangerously violent.\\\"\", \"The 17-year-old victim was not present during McCallion's sentencing on Tuesday, but her dad did read a statement that she wrote.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1934710/court-sentencing.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Robert McCallion, 36, was sentenced to 15 years in prison after a brutal hate crime against a 17-year-old girl he had never met.
