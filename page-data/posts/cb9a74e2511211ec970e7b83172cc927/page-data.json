Biden is doing nothing to stop immigrants from South Africa entering illegally. Pure politics and hypocrisy.\\\"\", \"It is unclear if Abbott was confusing the country of South Africa with the continent of South America, or if he was suggesting migrants have been traveling from South Africa towards Mexico before illegally trying to enter the U.S.\", \"Either way, the tweet was condemned by a number of social media users.\", \"New York Democratic Senator James Skoufis tweeted: \\\"Greg Abbott can see South Africa from his house!

Phang, attorney and CNBC host, tweeted in response to Abbott: \\\"If this isn't a parody account, you need to resign.\\\"\", \"The World Health Organization has official listed Omicron as a \\\"variant of concern\\\" because it has several mutations which may impact on how it behaves, such how easily it spreads or the severity of illness those who are infected by it may be inflicted with.\", \"However, the WHO said it is still unclear if Omicron is more transmissible or causes more severe disease than other COVID variants, and more studies are needed.\", \"Abbott has been connected for further comment.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941353/greg-abbott-south-africa.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Texas Governor Greg Abbott speaks during the Houston Region Business Coalition's monthly meeting on October 27, 2021 in Houston, Texas.</div>\"]","href_hash":"cb9a74e2511211ec970e7b83172cc927"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cb9a74e2511211ec970e7b83172cc927"}},
