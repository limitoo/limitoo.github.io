It means poultry farms and facilities must slaughter birds\\u2014sometimes tens of millions of them\\u2014to stem the spread, including healthy ones.\", \"In bird populations the virus can cause huge numbers of fatalities with a mortality rate of around 50 percent, according to the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).\", \"The disease can also jump to humans.

Mortality with this type of bird flu has been highest in people aged 10 to 19 years old and young adults.\", \"People tend to catch bird flu through contact with sick birds, such as by handling them or generally being near them. The virus can be inhaled through the air, but can also enter the mouth, nose, or eyes if someone touches their face with a hand that has the virus on it.\", \"The CDC notes that some limited human-to-human infections have likely occurred in some cases.

While some medications have been shown to work against bird flu, there is concern that some types of the virus may become resistant to medications, and scientists are continuing to monitor this.\", \"Bird flu infections in humans can be prevented by avoiding exposure as most human infections occur following direct or close contact with infected poultry, the CDC notes. Vaccines for H5N1 also exist, which the U.S. has stockpiled.\", \"People cannot get bird flu from meat or eggs if they are fully-cooked, according to the U.K.'s National Health Service, but it is possible to get it while preparing infected poultry for cooking.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932981/dead-birds-amid-flu-outbreak.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Workers bury hundreds of dead ducks at a bird farm affected by bird flu in South Korea, in December 2003.
