The candle-lighting ceremony took place on the fourth of Hanukkah's eight nights.\", \"\\\"When we light this menorah in the White House, when Jewish families place menorahs in their windows, we are proclaiming liberty and showing that there is still light,\\\" Biden stated at the ceremony. \\\"That little bit of light, wherever it is found, can dispel the darkness and illuminate a path forward.\\\"\", \"The president appeared to be alluding to the message of moving forward together, something that he has tried to embrace throughout his first year in office. He also noted that rabbis have described the U.S. as a \\\"great nation of kindness.\\\"\", \"\\\"The Hanukkah story provides a powerful lesson and nourishes a wellspring of hope. In darkness, there's light; in cynicism, there's hope and optimism,\\\" the president continued.\", \"Biden's remarks come as antisemitic incidents continue to occur more regularly across the country, and across the world as a whole.\", \"Biden also lauded the presence at the candle lighting of the Israeli ambassador to the United States, Michael Herzog, who began serving in his position on November 15.\", \"\\\"Ambassador, I look forward to working with you to reaffirm the longstanding ties between the United States and the State of Israel,\\\" Biden told Herzog.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943760/white-house-hanukkah-ceremony.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">President Joe Biden called the menorah-lighting ceremony at the White House Wednesday a symbol of the enduring light of the United States.
