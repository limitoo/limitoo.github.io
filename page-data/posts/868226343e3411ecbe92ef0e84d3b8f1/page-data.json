Here’s a selection.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-05T12:33:42.000Z","content":"[\"LONDON \\u2014 Nearly 25 years after her death, Diana, Princess of Wales, remains a fixture in British culture and on screens both sides of the pond.\", \"Her life is often remembered as tragic: an unhappy marriage to Prince Charles, a complex private life hounded by paparazzi, a shocking death in a car crash at the age of 36. But she was also, truly, beloved, earning the moniker \\u201cthe people\\u2019s princess\\u201d for her charity work and candor.\", \"This complexity has inspired countless television and film adaptations of her life. The latest, in theaters Friday, is \\u201cSpencer.\\u201d Starring Kristen Stewart as Diana and directed by Pablo Larra\\u00edn, the film takes place over one Christmas holiday with the royal family, as Diana\\u2019s marriage (and possibly her mental health) unravel. \", \"Each Diana production \\u2014 made in every decade since she became a public figure \\u2014 takes a different perspective on the princess. Here\\u2019s a list of six varied examples, all available to watch online.\", \"In the early 1990s, U.S. television networks scrambled to make small-screen movies depicting Charles and Diana\\u2019s much-publicized unhappy marriage.\", \"Andrew Morton\\u2019s explosive biography \\u201cDiana: Her True Story\\u201d was published in 1992, and a year later NBC aired a movie adaptation of the book, starring Serena Scott Thomas as Diana and David Threlfall as Charles.\", \"This is a soapy rendering of Diana\\u2019s marriage, but the plot generally sticks to the story that \\u201cThe Crown\\u201d later explored with more nuance, and the differences between the couple are evident from the start. Charles is explicit that he doesn\\u2019t see love as a prerequisite for marriage, seeing it as a \\u201cpartnership.\\u201d Scott Thomas\\u2019s Diana, meanwhile, believes that her role is to support her husband and that, with time, she can make Charles love her.\", \"Scott Thomas doesn\\u2019t quite embody Diana\\u2019s looks or mannerisms, but she does capture the personable nature that made her so popular. Her portrayal of the princess is sympathetic and she frequently reacts to Charles\\u2019s mistreatment, screaming at him after she finds a photograph of Camilla on their honeymoon and throwing herself down the stairs while pregnant with her first child. Sticking to revelations in Morton\\u2019s book, Diana\\u2019s struggle with an eating disorder is also depicted. (Stream via Amazon Prime Video; rent or buy on Amazon.)\", \"\\u201cDiana: The Musical,\\u201d written by Joe DiPietro and Bon Jovi\\u2019s David Bryan, had its Broadway run swiftly shuttered because of the pandemic. Earlier this year a filmed version landed on Netflix.\", \"Starting with her initial courtship of Prince Charles, the two-hour musical flies through notable events in Diana\\u2019s life at a dizzying pace. There are numbers on her paparazzi intrusion (with lyrics like \\u201cAin\\u2019t nothin\\u2019 like the hunt, Ain\\u2019t nothin\\u2019 like the thrill. Find the right bird, Then go in for the kill\\u201d) and contrasting Diana\\u2019s common touch with the public with the royal family\\u2019s stuffiness (\\u201cAll right, I\\u2019m no intellect,\\u201d she sings while watching a cello performance with Charles. \\u201cBut maybe there\\u2019s a discotheque, where the prince could hear some Prince and we\\u2019d all get funkadelic.\\u201d)\", \"This version of Diana (played by Jeanna de Waal) is particularly one-dimensional. There isn't much of an opportunity to dwell on her emotions, or provide insight on her mental state, and the filmed musical was not well received. \\u201cThis is a Rocky Horror Picture Show of cluelessness and misjudged Judy Garlandification,\\u201d wrote Peter Bradshaw in The Guardian. (Stream on Netflix.)\", \"Based on the play of the same name by Mike Bartlett, \\u201cKing Charles III\\u201d is set following the death of Queen Elizabeth II and sees Charles (Tim Pigott-Smith) grappling with the death of his mother and his transition to king.\", \"In the vein of a Shakespearean tragedy, the ghost of Diana (Katie Brayben) appears several times in the made-for-TV movie. Always kept distant from other characters and wearing white, she reassures a stubborn Charles (\\u201cYou think I didn\\u2019t love you. It\\u2019s not true\\u201d) and a pained William, upset at his rebellious father (\\u201cYou\\u2019re now the man I never lived to see\\u201d).\", \"The ghost of Diana sparked a British tabloid storm, particularly when it was set to be broadcast soon after Prince Harry spoke about the impact losing his mother had on his mental health. Bartlett defended her inclusion: \\u201cIt\\u2019s a genuine investigation of what it is to be that family and in that role in the country,\\u201d he told the TV magazine Radio Times. \\u201cDiana is part of that.\\u201d (Rent or buy on Amazon and iTunes.)\", \"The posters for the fourth season of \\u201cThe Crown\\u201d marked the show\\u2019s arrival in the 1980s by sandwiching the face of the queen (now played by Olivia Colman) between two new characters: Margaret Thatcher (Gillian Anderson) and Diana (a newcomer, Emma Corrin).\", \"We meet Diana as a teenager, and while Corrin perfectly captures the future princess\\u2019s look and subtle mannerisms, the show also emphasizes the down-to-earth quality that made Diana so popular with the public through scenes of her roller skating through the palace and going out dancing with friends.\", \"We see her struggling with an eating disorder, and with feeling isolated from Charles and the rest of his family, as well as with the complicated social rules around interacting with royalty.\", \"Corrin received a Golden Globe for her portrayal, and as is typical on \\u201cThe Crown,\\u201d the role of Diana will be taken over by a new actress, Elizabeth Debicki, for the show\\u2019s fifth season.\", \"\\u201cI feel so happy to have done the arc of her life that I did, but for me it feels like a very closed chapter. I went into it knowing I wouldn\\u2019t continue,\\u201d Corrin told The New York Times. (Stream on Netflix.)\", \"Starring Naomi Watts as Diana, this film by the Oscar-winning director Oliver Hirschbiegel is set over the last two years of Diana\\u2019s life, when she was \\u201cthe most famous woman in the world.\\u201d This period includes her divorce from Charles and her subsequent relationships with the heart surgeon Hasnat Khan (Naveen Andrews) and the filmmaker Dodi Fayed (Cas Anvar).\", \"The film focuses on Diana\\u2019s charity work and desire to live a \\u201cnormal\\u201d life, but she is depicted to be increasingly isolated, upset that Khan does not want to make their relationship public. \\u201cI have never once been accepted by a family. Not my own, not the one I married into,\\u201d she tells him.\", \"In an interview with The Mail on Sunday, Khan said he was unhappy with his and Diana\\u2019s portrayal, saying the film was a result of \\u201cDiana\\u2019s friends talking about a relationship that they didn\\u2019t know much about, and some of my relatives who didn\\u2019t know much about it either. It is all based on hypotheses and gossip.\\u201d\", \"Critics weren\\u2019t excited by \\u201cDiana.\\u201d \\u201cThis movie isn\\u2019t especially good,\\u201d wrote Manohla Dargis in The New York Times, describing it as \\u201cpart reheated gossip, part moony romance.\\u201d (Rent or buy on iTunes and Vudu.)\", \"In the years since Diana\\u2019s death, the British tabloid press has speculated wildly about the official account of the traffic accident that killed her, fueling conspiracy theories. This culture is captured in a short film by the Uruguayan contemporary artist Martin Sastre, in which Diana (Denise Watson) didn\\u2019t die in Paris, and instead is living undercover in a neighborhood of Montevideo in Uruguay.\", \"The short, which was shown at the Venice Biennale, shows Diana embraced by the local community after helping to improve their living conditions and teaching them yoga. She is also shown, finally, as living a \\u201cnormal\\u201d life, shopping without having to resort to a disguise and openly expressing her love with a local resident. Most of all, she is depicted as being happy and at peace.\", \"After the media discovers her whereabouts, a local is interviewed about what life was like before Diana arrived in the neighborhood: \\u201cNo one, no cops, no ambulances. They used to let us die. But after she appeared, everything changed.\\u201d\", \"(Watch on Martin Sastre\\u2019s website.)\"]","href_hash":"868226343e3411ecbe92ef0e84d3b8f1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"868226343e3411ecbe92ef0e84d3b8f1"}},
