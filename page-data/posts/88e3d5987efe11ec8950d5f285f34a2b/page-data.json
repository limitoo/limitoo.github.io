He's absolutely dreaming\\\".\", \"\\\"Ask anyone in sector if they really think they've got surge capacity... I think if we look back clearly we were under prepared, but that's been and gone. Done.\", \"\\\"What we need to be doing now is looking forward as to if we accept that we're going to prepare the ICU sector.\\\"\", \"Meanwhile, University of Otago epidemiologist Professor Michael Baker told Morning Report estimates of overseas outbreaks from the research organisation have been accurate to date.\", \"He believed because New Zealand's outbreak came later than expected, the dates in the modelling could be shifted a by a week.\", \"The modelling assumes that about one in eight cases is being detected.\", \"Baker said the research only took New Zealand's response to the outbreak into account in a broad way and would miss some of the nuances.\", \"\\\"Interestingly, they build into their model something like the alert level system, which they consider to be a good model, and they are assuming that all countries are taking action,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I think we can definitely improve on these results.\\\"\", \"Once Omicron passed what the government was calling phase one, it was explosive, Baker said.\", \"The number one thing someone could do to get ready was to get a booster, particularly the elderly and immunocompromised, he said.\", \"Reducing contact with people outside your family unit when the outbreak was peaking was the second thing Baker advised.\", \"\\\"The other thing I think that really comes through in this modelling is that masks really do make a difference.\\\"\", \"If going out you should wear a N95 mask or similar, he said.\", \"People with discretionary events coming up should be postponing them.\", \"Reti's advice for those looking at the numbers shown in modelling with concern was, \\\"This is modelling. It has a lot of variance ... it is just modelling.\", \"\\\"Secondly, We can only control what we can control and what we're asking citizens to control is to control their social distancing, to control their mask wearing, to control their hand washing, to control sneeze etiquette, to be vaccinated, to get the booster.\", \"\\\"Those are the levers that individual New Zealanders have that that that can make a change, and we'll make a change to the modelling. In fact, the modelling takes into account mask wearing and it shows reductions in both hospitalisation and ICU hospitalisation with just mask wearing. Those are the things that we're asking New Zealanders to do.\\\"\", \"RNZ\"]","href_hash":"88e3d5987efe11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"88e3d5987efe11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
