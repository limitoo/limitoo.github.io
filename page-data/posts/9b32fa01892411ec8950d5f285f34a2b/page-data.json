But there's another tax benefit geared to parents that may be less well known than the CTC but that can be far more generous, providing up to $8,000 in tax credits this year.\\u00a0\", \"The Child and Dependent Care Credit was supercharged through the 2021 American Rescue Plan, with the pandemic aid bill boosting how much parents can claim on their tax returns for child care expenses as well as making it fully refundable. The latter is important because if the tax credit exceeds what you owe the IRS, you'll get the difference in your tax refund.\\u00a0\", \"The Child and Dependent Care Credit isn't new \\u2014 it's been around since the 1970s, and was designed to help working parents offset the cost of daycare, after school programs and summer camps. But the credit hadn't kept up with the pace of child care costs, with the child advocacy group First Five Years Fund noting  in 2018 that it only covered about 10% of the typical annual cost of care for two children in the U.S. at the time.\", \"The American Rescue Plan created several tax benefits for families. That includes a generous expansion of the Child and Dependent Care Credit, which the Biden administration said was geared toward helping parents return to work. Under the expansion, parents can receive a tax credit worth as much as $8,000 \\u2014 nearly four times the previous limit of $2,100.\\u00a0\", \"The expanded Child Tax Credit, by comparison, provides $3,600 for each child under six and $3,000 for children between 6 to 17.\", \"\\\"They are recognizing the increasing cost of child care in our country,\\\" said Robbin Caruso, co-lead of Prager Metis' National Tax Controversy Practice. \\\"It's a huge opportunity for taxpayers, and it shouldn't be missed out on.\\\"\", \"The fact that it's also fully refundable is important because it could boost the tax refund that many parents receive this year, experts say. Tax credits are dollar-for-dollar reductions in a person's tax liability, versus deductions that lower a person's overall taxable income.\\u00a0\", \"That means tax credits like the Child and Dependent Care Credit are more valuable for taxpayers than deductions \\u2014 and become even more so when they are fully refundable.\\u00a0\", \"The most parents can receive from the tax credit is $8,000, which applies to families with two or more children.\", \"The expanded tax break lets families claim a credit worth 50% of their child care expenses, which can be up to $16,000 for two or more kids. In other words, families with two kids who spent at least $16,000 on day care in 2021 can get $8,000 back from the IRS through the expanded tax credit.\\u00a0\", \"Prior to the American Rescue Plan, parents could only claim 35% of a maximum of $6,000 in child care expenses for two children, or a maximum tax credit of $2,100.\\u00a0\", \"Parents with one child can claim 50% of their child care expenses, up to $8,000. That means parents with one child can get a maximum tax credit of $4,000 on their taxes this year. (Prior to the American Rescue Plan, the limit for parents with one child was $1,050 via the tax credit.)\\u00a0\", \"Many parents \\\"may not realize how much it's increased,\\\" Lisa Greene-Lewis, a CPA and tax expert at TurboTax, said of the sweetened Child and Dependent Care Credit.\", \"Parents and people with dependents who paid for the care of a qualifying individual in order to work or look for work during 2021 are eligible for the expanded tax credit.\\u00a0\", \"A qualifying individual can mean a few things, according to the IRS:\", \"The latter is important because it extends the benefit to people who are caring for older or adult children with disabilities, as well as, say, taxpayers who claim elderly relatives as dependents and who pay for their care.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"If you have a child with disability, there's no age limit,\\\" Greene-Lewis said.\", \"Because the Child and Dependent Care Credit is aimed at helping working people pay for child care, parents must have spent money on caring for their children or dependents in order for them to work or look for work. People who pay for care for older dependents can claim expenses such as adult day care.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It can count for summer camp, sports camps \\u2014 as long as it's enabling you to work or look to work,\\\" Greene-Lewis noted.\\u00a0\", \"As with the difference between overnight and day camps, not every type of expense is considered valid by the IRS.\", \"The IRS says that, generally, parents must be working or looking for work to qualify, but there is wiggle room in some areas.\", \"One major caveat: Although the credit helps people looking for work, a taxpayer must have had some earned income for the year to qualify for it. So if you looked for work but didn't find a job (and therefore didn't have any income in 2021), you won't be able to claim the tax credit.\\u00a0\", \"Like many of the provisions in the American Rescue Plan, the expanded Child and Dependent Care Credit is only valid for the 2021 tax year \\u2014 the year for which people are now filing their tax returns.\\u00a0\", \"For 2022, the tax credit returns to its previous form. That means that when parents claim the tax credit on their returns next year, the benefit will be reduced to the previous maximum of $2,100.\\u00a0\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"9b32fa01892411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9b32fa01892411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
