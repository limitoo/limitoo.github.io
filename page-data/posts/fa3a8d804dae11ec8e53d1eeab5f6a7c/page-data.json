I'm sure, it's no different here in Kanpur.\\\"\", \"The touring side have had only two training sessions as a full squad, with their Twenty20 players taking part in a three-match series ahead of the tests. Williamson, who skipped the T20 leg, said they will have to adjust quickly.\", \"\\\"We know the strength of the Indian spin bowlers and they've been fantastic for a long period,\\\" Williamson said, adding that they will be looking at different methods and ways to try and score against the spinners.\", \"The hosts will be without captain Virat Kohli, who decided to skip the first test, while openers Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul, wicketkeeper Rishabh Pant and fast bowlers Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammed Shami will miss both matches.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/281185/eight_col_ap.jpg?1637776863\\\" alt=\\\"Axar Patel of India\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nAxar Patel \\nPhoto: PHOTOSPORT\\n</div>\", \"A depleted Indian side will, however, not make New Zealand the favourites, according to Williamson.\", \"\\\"One of the big strengths of Indian cricket in any format is the depth and we've seen that in a lot of ways over the years,\\\" he added.\", \"\\\"The knowledge of their own conditions is something that is quite unique for touring teams as well. The challenge is a big one and we're excited to take that on.\\\"\", \"India's stand-in captain Ajinka Rahane has confirmed that batter Shreyas Iyer will make his test debut at Kanpur.\", \"Rahane said the hosts were yet to finalise their combination for the match but added that the series would be a good opportunity for those coming into the side in the absence of the big names.\", \"Spin bowling will be the deciding factor in the match and the 33-year-old Rahane said it was important for India to maximise their home advantage.\", \"\\\"We are backing our bowlers to take 20 wickets on spin-friendly pitches,\\\" Rahane said.\", \"\\\"At the same time it will be good to bat on.
