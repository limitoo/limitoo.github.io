Those reports displayed the logos of drug makers, which acted as proof that Theranos\\u2019s technology had been validated by them. During the trial, investors have testified that those reports helped persuade them to pour money into Ms. Holmes\\u2019s start-up.\", \"But representatives from Pfizer and Schering-Plough testified that their companies had never validated Theranos\\u2019s technology. (Pfizer\\u2019s representative said the company had come to the opposite conclusion.) Nor had they approved of having their logos added to the reports.\", \"On the stand on Monday, Ms. Holmes testified about studies that Theranos did with Merck, AstraZeneca, Centocor, Bristol Myers Squibb and others in 2008 and 2009. One exhibit displayed internal documentation about the success of some of this early work and showed a map of around a dozen cities around the world where Theranos\\u2019s machines were used for studies.\", \"Kevin Downey, Ms. Holmes\\u2019s lawyer, also showed what he called a peer-reviewed journal that published the results of a study that Theranos did with Stanford University around this time. He did not mention the name of the journal.\", \"In each example, Ms. Holmes\\u2019s understanding of Theranos\\u2019s technology was that \\u201cit performed well,\\u201d she testified. In some of the examples, Theranos was paid for its work in the studies.\", \"Throughout her trial, Ms. Holmes\\u2019s defense team has tried making the case that there was some truth to what Ms. Holmes told investors.\", \"\\u201cThe reality of what happened at Theranos is far, far more complicated than what you have heard about Elizabeth Holmes so far,\\u201d Lance Wade, another of Ms. Holmes\\u2019s lawyers, said in his opening statement at the trial\\u2019s start in September.\"]","href_hash":"be56203a4bd911eca675cd48c0f4e854"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"be56203a4bd911eca675cd48c0f4e854"}},
