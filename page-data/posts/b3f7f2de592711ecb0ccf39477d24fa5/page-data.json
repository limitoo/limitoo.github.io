She hopes to receive up to $10,000 in compensation.\", \"Vasquez did not participate in any of the demonstrations held throughout the city, but tear gas deployed during that period affected the neighborhood she lived in. She said that the tear gas entered her home through windows that she opened to get fresh air. She then experienced severe cramping and an irregular menstrual cycle.\", \"\\\"Halfway around the block I would be almost doubled over with cramps,\\\" she said in an interview. \\\"The only factor that was different was tear gas, a poison that's known to cause issues with menstruation.\\\"\", \"The pain was so debilitating that she had to move out of her home of 10 years in August of 2020, she said. Although some of the pain has subsided and she is now able to go on her daily walks, she is still experiencing heavy and irregular cycles.\", \"\\\"When it does come, it's heavy and the cramps are like nothing I've ever experienced in my life, it's so painful,\\\" she said. \\\"I'm getting cancer screenings, and we don't know what will happen long term. It's nerve-wracking.\\\"\", \"Fuller said that the city's disbursement of tear gas was irresponsible and dangerous due to the chemicals' side effects.\", \"\\\"Deploying tear gas is by its very nature a very dangerous activity,\\\" he said. \\\"The city knew or should have known that it was a harmful, toxic chemical.\\\"\", \"The city has one month to respond to the filing. The Portland attorney's office declined to comment.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948704/portland-tear-gas.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">An Oregon woman is suing the city Portland, saying tear gas severely damaged her menstrual health.
