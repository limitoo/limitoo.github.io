Rather, the film turns its gaze to those who knew Lowe best \\u2014 or, in the case of his three children, those who barely got the chance to know him at all.\", \"It\\u2019s a stark tonal shift away from \\u201cFree Solo,\\u201d one of National Geographic\\u2019s previous (and much-lauded) documentaries on a climber, which built a character study around Alex Honnold\\u2019s exhilarating free solo climb of El Capitan. Max Lowe, who was only 10 when his father was killed in an avalanche in Tibet, aligns his project closer to \\u201cStories We Tell,\\u201d Sarah Polley\\u2019s 2013 exploration of her own family history that puts as much emphasis on digging up the truth as the truth itself.\", \"Though there are no real secrets to be uncovered regarding Alex Lowe\\u2019s motivations for climbing, nor his infectiously exuberant personality in life \\u2014 which, as seen in the many archival tapes that Max gets access to, could occasionally cause frustration to those around him \\u2014 the film unavoidably feels confessional and cathartic. The director\\u2019s conversations with his mother, Jennifer; his younger brothers, Sam and Isaac; and his stepfather, Conrad Anker, who was once Alex Lowe\\u2019s most trusted mountaineering partner, all straddle the line between interview and healing circle, trying to reconcile the real, mortal Alex with the Superman that they and the public at large saw him as. Learning to not only see but embrace that humanity is the central thread of \\u201cTorn,\\u201d which, by its quiet ending, has demonstrated how unexpected bonds can form around those in grief.\"]","href_hash":"35a69db8539611ecbd3d811438073cbf"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"35a69db8539611ecbd3d811438073cbf"}},
