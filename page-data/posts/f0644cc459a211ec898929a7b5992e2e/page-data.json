The sport has taken off.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-10T10:22:53.000Z","content":"[\"Thanks to one of the closest title battles in a decade, and increased interest drawn by Netflix, Formula 1 will wrap up a classic season on Sunday that has gripped fans old and new.\", \"After years of domination by Lewis Hamilton of England, who has won six of the last seven drivers\\u2019 titles with his Mercedes team, this season offered a sign of what Formula 1\\u2019s future may look like as a new challenger emerged.\", \"Max Verstappen of the Netherlands has been long regarded as the eventual successor to Hamilton. Ever since becoming the sport\\u2019s youngest driver at 17 in 2015 and its youngest race winner one year later, Verstappen, now 24, seemed bound for greatness.\", \"Verstappen\\u2019s Red Bull team started the season with a car capable of challenging Mercedes, and the two teams remained evenly matched throughout the year. Verstappen was no longer the underdog and had a real shot at the title, leading to a season-long battle with Hamilton.\", \"Hamilton and Verstappen are considered to be the defining drivers of their generation, but they are at very different points in their careers. Hamilton, 36, is seeking a record-breaking eighth world championship; Verstappen has not even challenged for a Formula 1 title before.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a young guy against the established world champion, and I think it\\u2019s very exciting,\\u201d Verstappen said. \\u201cWe always try to beat each other, of course. But it\\u2019s been a really cool season.\\u201d\", \"Hamilton said he was \\u201cmore relaxed than I\\u2019ve ever been\\u201d through the title fight because of his experience, but noted that the challenge from Verstappen had helped his game.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re always trying to level up, trying to improve,\\u201d Hamilton said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot of areas you can do it. When you\\u2019re in a title fight like this, you\\u2019re pushing as hard as you can, even more so in areas where you hadn\\u2019t in the past.\\u201d\", \"It was the closest championship battle between drivers from rival teams since 2012, when Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull beat Fernando Alonso of Ferrari by three points, causing tensions to flare this year on and off the track. A wheel-to-wheel fight between Hamilton and Verstappen in the final laps of the opening race in Bahrain set the tone for the season.\", \"The initial on-track battles between Hamilton and Verstappen were hard but fair, but as the competition grew fiercer, a crash looked inevitable. It arrived on the first lap of the British Grand Prix in July, when contact at high speed caused Verstappen to crash into the barrier at a force of 51Gs, resulting in a precautionary visit to the hospital.\", \"It would not be the only time Hamilton and Verstappen would crash together this year. In Italy, Verstappen\\u2019s car ended up on top of Hamilton\\u2019s after a fight for position, forcing both drivers out of the race. Later in the year, Verstappen drew criticism in Brazil for his aggressive defensive moves to unsuccessfully keep Hamilton behind when battling for the lead.\", \"It fueled season-long tension between Mercedes and Red Bull. Led by their respective team principals, Toto Wolff and Christian Horner, they traded verbal blows, as well as occasionally asking officials to investigate controversial incidents\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s the first time they have been challenged,\\u201d Horner said of Mercedes. \\u201cIt\\u2019s interesting to see how people react when they are under pressure. It\\u2019s by far the most intense political title fight we\\u2019ve been involved in in our time in the sport.\\u201d\", \"Wolff said the fight was on all levels: political (such as questioning each other\\u2019s wing designs, leading to stricter technical checks), sporting and technical (by making improvements to their cars). \\u201cI think that whoever wins this championship at the end of the year merits the win, because it was on a very high level.\\u201d\", \"The drama of the on-track championship fight and the off-track sparring has been perfect material for \\u201cFormula 1: Drive to Survive,\\u201d the Netflix docuseries, which will show the battle in its fourth season next year.\", \"Since acquiring Formula 1 in 2017, the Liberty Media Corporation has been clear in its ambition to make the sport more accessible to young fans and expand its reach into new markets, with a particular focus on the United States. This year suggested that it had succeeded on both counts, partly because of the impact of the Netflix series.\", \"A survey conducted by Formula 1, Motorsport Network and Nielsen revealed in October that fans were indeed getting younger. The average age fell to 32 from 36 since the last survey in 2017, while the number of female fans almost doubled, reflecting a more diverse audience.\", \"\\u201c\\u2018Drive to Survive\\u2019 had a big impact, mainly on the ones that were not really such avid fans of Formula 1,\\u201d said Stefano Domenicali, the chief executive of Formula 1. \\u201cThey saw different narratives within the sport.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI think diversity and getting younger audiences will enable us to enrich [Formula 1] in terms of being able to capture the attention of more people,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s something that we\\u2019ve seen [happen with] the effect of having the right language, the right narrative and the right tools that are closer to the way the younger generation are working and behaving.\\u201d\", \"Zak Brown, the chief executive of McLaren Racing, said the Netflix series had \\u201cdriven a younger, much larger fan base\\u201d and \\u201creally had an impact in America.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s doing what we as a sport would like it to do, which is turn on a bunch of new fans,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s been hugely successful.\\u201d\", \"The impact of \\u201cDrive to Survive\\u201d was no clearer than when 400,000 fans attended the United States Grand Prix weekend in Austin, Texas, in October, the only Formula 1 race in the country. It was not only a record for that race, but Liberty reported in its third-quarter earnings in November that it was a record for any Grand Prix the sport has held in its 71-year history. The race was hailed as a breakthrough for Formula 1 in the United States.\", \"Horner of Red Bull said he felt that Formula 1 made a \\u201cbig statement\\u201d with the crowd in Austin. \\u201cI think we have to thank Netflix, but without great content, then it\\u2019s not a good show,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe racing really delivered. Fans are really engaging with what Formula 1 could offer.\\u201d\", \"Netflix has helped move Formula 1 into the American mainstream. After the Austin race, Daniel Ricciardo of McLaren was invited to be a guest on \\u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show.\\u201d He said DeGeneres became interested in Formula 1 through \\u201cDrive to Survive.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cShe showed a real keen interest and understanding,\\u201d Ricciardo said.\", \"\\u201cWe chatted a bit after, and she\\u2019s all on board. She may get a little bit of time off in the near future and get to a race at some point, I hope.\\u201d\", \"The heightened American interest has furthered discussions over expanding Formula 1 in the United States. A second U.S. race is already scheduled in Miami next year. Las Vegas has also shown interest in hosting a Grand Prix, with some of the race potentially held on its Strip.\", \"\\u201cThe market could definitely handle a third race,\\u201d Brown said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very complicated to put these races together, but the obvious wish list: New York would be great, Las Vegas would be great, any of the big markets. I hope a third race happens.\\u201d\", \"Hamilton felt the close title fight with Verstappen was good timing for Formula 1.\", \"\\u201cWith the growth of what\\u2019s happened through Netflix, I think it\\u2019s been incredible,\\u201d Hamilton said.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve got new people coming in, and it\\u2019s the perfect time for people to come in and get into the sport, because it\\u2019s one of the most exciting times the sport has had in a long time.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f0644cc459a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f0644cc459a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}},
