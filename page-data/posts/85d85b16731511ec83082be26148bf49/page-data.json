It will also stop charging fees for non-sufficient funds (NSF) \\u2014 which are levied when it rejects a transaction \\u2014 better known as bouncing a check. While checks are no longer widely used, NSF fees can come from automated payments like utility bills.\\u00a0\", \"Bank of America says roughly 25% of its overdraft/NSF fee revenue each year came from NSF fees.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"This is the final step in the journey we've been on,\\\" said Holly O'Neill, president of retail banking at BofA, in an interview. \\\"We have good financial solutions for clients without them having to rely on overdraft, but we will still have overdraft if it is needed.\\\"\", \"Altogether, Bank of America estimates the steps will cut its overdraft-fee revenues by 97% from where they were in 2009, the year before it started taking incremental steps toward reining in overdraft-fee revenues.\\u00a0\", \"Originating in banks as a service fee to customers who may not have balanced their checkbook correctly but wanted a bank to honor a purchase, overdraft fees have been transformed by the widespread use of debit cards from a courtesy into a routine source of revenue for banks.

Elizabeth Warren, speaking at a\\u00a0Senate Banking Committee hearing\\u00a0in May, criticized bank executives for how much money their companies generated in fees during the coronavirus pandemic.
