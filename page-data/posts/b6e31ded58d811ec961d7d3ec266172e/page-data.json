Tickets start at $25 and are available at theshed.org.MELISSA SMITH\", \"When Ikue Mori visited Lower Manhattan from Tokyo in 1977, she didn\\u2019t really play any instruments, and she didn\\u2019t plan to stay. But she fell in with a tribe of outsider-art musicians who also had little formal training, and soon she was the drummer in DNA, a seminal no-wave group. (That\\u2019s her pounding the skins behind Arto Lindsay in \\u201cDowntown 81,\\u201d the art-house flick that sprang from that scene and stars a young Jean-Michel Basquiat.)\", \"New York became home, but she developed no similar attachment to the drum kit. By the mid-\\u201980s, she had moved on to using only a rig of drum machines and samplers, with processors and effects allowing them to play pitches and tones as well as percussion. Today, Mori uses laptops to make spectral, darkly glimmering music, often in collaboration with just one or two other improvisers.\", \"This weekend, she is in residency at the Stone, playing alone on Thursday night, with the pianist Craig Taborn (her partner on a 2017 album, \\u201cHighsmith\\u201d) on Friday, and with Brian Marsella on keyboards and Sae Hashimoto on percussion (this trio\\u2019s album, \\u201cArchipelago X,\\u201d came out in the spring) on Saturday. Each show starts at 8:30 p.m.; admission is $20.GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO\", \"In \\u201c<\\u2014>,\\u201d a.k.a. \\u201cBack and Forth,\\u201d just when you think the experimental filmmaker Michael Snow must be a huge tennis fan, a shift suggests he is an even bigger basketball fan. A landmark of avant-garde cinema, the film, shot in 1968 at Fairleigh Dickinson University, in New Jersey, principally consists of a camera panning between two fixed points in a classroom, at various speeds and with assorted, often humorous twists, as the people and details in the room change. Anthology Film Archives\\u2019 new, unmissable 35-millimeter restoration \\u2014 the first archival-quality print of \\u201c<\\u2014>,\\u201d according to Snow \\u2014 premiered Saturday and will screen again on Sunday and Tuesday.\", \"The restoration anchors a Snow retrospective at Anthology that is continuing into its second week. (Snow, incidentally, turns 93 on Friday.) In addition to showing rare works from the filmmaker, the theater has added a screening of his canonical \\u201cWavelength\\u201d (on Sunday), in which a zoom across a Canal Street loft confounds viewers\\u2019 notions of time, space and perspective.BEN KENIGSBERG\", \"Several years ago, Alex Edelman, a stand-up comedian and Orthodox Jew then living on the Upper East Side, responded to a tweet and found himself at a clandestine meeting of white nationalists in a Queens apartment. What happened next?\", \"In \\u201cJust for Us,\\u201d Edelman, a Massachusetts native and N.Y.U. alum, tells the tale of his adventure, questioning his Judaism and his whiteness along the way. Coincidentally, he also offers up one particularly memorable childhood Christmas story \\u2014 and even jokes about gorillas and horses. This one-hander was nominated in 2018 for an award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe, where Edelman won the best newcomer prize in 2014.\", \"The show, directed by Adam Brace and presented by the comedic storyteller Mike Birbiglia, opened in previews Off Broadway last week at the Cherry Lane Theater, where it will remain through Jan. 8. Tickets start at $37.SEAN L. McCARTHY\", \"Describing John and Faith Hubley\\u2019s animation as jazzy is more than a metaphor. This pioneering married couple, who collaborated from the mid-1950s until John\\u2019s death in 1977, made short films that were not only impressionistic and improvisatory but also filled with haunting melodies by musicians like Benny Carter and Quincy Jones.\", \"Families can see and hear the results on Saturday at 12:30 p.m., and Dec. 17 at 3 p.m., when the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens presents A Family Affair: The Hubleys\\u2019 Animated Shorts. This 70-minute program, for which tickets are $9 to $15, includes films based on the recorded playtime fantasies of the couple\\u2019s small children: \\u201cWindy Day,\\u201d a royal epic by their daughters, Emily and Georgia; and \\u201cMoonbird,\\u201d a wild escapade invented by their sons, Mark and Ray. (Ray Hubley will introduce the Saturday screenings.)\", \"The works, however, are extraordinarily sophisticated, with characters that sometimes seem to have stepped out of a Picasso canvas. \\u201cUrbanissimo\\u201d tackles industrialization, while \\u201cThe Hat,\\u201d with the talents of Dizzy Gillespie and Dudley Moore, offers a whimsical critique of militarism.\", \"But this program isn\\u2019t all that\\u2019s intriguing in Queens. On Saturday at 11 a.m. and 2 p.m., Flushing Town Hall will present Tanglewood Marionettes in \\u201cThe Dragon King,\\u201d another colorful adventure.
