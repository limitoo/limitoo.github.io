The agreement, dated November 12, must receive court approval, according to a press release from Bonta's office.\", \"In Bonta's initial complaint, the attorney general alleged there were \\\"multiple instances\\\" in which Amazon did not notify workers within one business day about potential exposure to the virus, which the company is required to do under California's labor laws. The company is also required to provide workers who may have been exposed to COVID-19 with information regarding virus-related benefits provided by local, state and federal laws, to which Bonta alleged the company did not fully comply.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932644/amazon-fine-california-right-know-law.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">California Attorney General Rob Bonta on Monday said Amazon will pay a $500,000 fine after the state accused the company of concealing COVID-19 cases among workers.

One revision, known as the \\\"right-to-know\\\" law, was signed by California Governor Gavin Newsom in September 2020. It requires employers to report virus outbreaks to local health officials and to inform employees about reported infections within one business day.\", \"Bonta's office said Amazon has over the course of the pandemic \\\"failed to adequately notify warehouse workers and local health agencies of COVID-19 case numbers, often leaving them in the dark and unable to effectively track the spread of the virus.\\\"\", \"The agreement requires Amazon to end what Bonta's office described as \\\"harmful labor practices.\\\" As part of the agreement, the company will be required to inform workers within one business day of the specific numbers of newly reported virus infections, provide greater information regarding disinfection efforts and virus-related benefits, and alert public health officials \\\"within 48 hours\\\" of new infections \\\"so they can intervene in potential workplace outbreaks.\\\"\", \"Bonta's office will also be able to review Amazon's dissemination of virus-related notifications moving forward, the release said.\", \"\\\"Today's first-of-its-kind judgment will help ensure Amazon meets that requirement for its tens of thousands of warehouse workers across California,\\\" Bonta said in the release. \\\"Bottom line: Californians have a right to know about potential exposures to the coronavirus to protect themselves, their families, and their communities.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"cc0b5979465911ecb7bfcbff42593b24"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cc0b5979465911ecb7bfcbff42593b24"}},
