I started with the \\u201cNightmare on Elm Street\\u201d series (which I loved), I moved to the \\u201cFriday the 13th\\u201d series (which is fine), and I\\u2019m currently working my way through the \\u201cHalloween\\u201d series, whose primary antagonist is Michael Myers.\", \"The \\u201cHalloween\\u201d movies, if you\\u2019ve never seen them, are pretty straightforward. In the first, directed by John Carpenter and produced by Debra Hill, Michael Myers is introduced as a young boy who has, inexplicably, killed his older sister. Fast forward to 1978, and the adult Myers has escaped from a sanitarium to terrorize his hometown and, specifically, a group of teenagers (including a young Jamie Lee Curtis as Laurie Strode) who live in Myers\\u2019s former neighborhood. Myers kills several teens before turning his attention to Strode, stalking her and the children she\\u2019s babysitting through their home, before he\\u2019s vanquished (although not killed) by his doctor, Sam Loomis, played by the always-wonderful Donald Pleasence.\", \"Subsequent installments take the plot in different directions, but the films that involve Myers (the third movie is unrelated to the character or his mythology) share the same basic structure. There is a young woman (or young girl), a stable family, and an idyllic suburban neighborhood of white, middle-class people. The schools are safe, the police are decent and life is good for most people.\", \"Myers, in this world, isn\\u2019t just a killer; he is an intrusion. His very presence destabilizes the existing social order. Each of his rampages makes clear that the manicured reality of suburbia provides no actual shelter or protection from the disorder of the world at large. Myers is practically unstoppable. He tears through the police with ease. In each of the Myers films, there is, somewhere, an avatar of traditional white American masculinity, usually a sheriff or another member of law enforcement. And each time, they are impotent in the face of Myers\\u2019s rage. In the fourth installment, a posse of local men gather with guns and trucks to try to confront and stop Myers. They are torn to pieces by a force that does not acknowledge their authority as \\u201cgood guys with guns.\\u201d\", \"In the same way that I watched the \\u201cNightmare on Elm Street\\u201d movies as parables about the way the world is indifferent to children and their safety, I find that I am watching the \\u201cHalloween\\u201d movies as stories about the failure of white flight to actually assuage the fears of middle-class white Americans. Fear of crime, fear of violence, fear of some evil, lurking in the dark, with their children \\u2014 and especially their daughters \\u2014 in the cross hairs. It is not for nothing that the fictional town in which these films take place, Haddonfield, Ill., is a suburb of Chicago.\", \"There are obviously other ways to read this series. As with the entire slasher genre, there are strong sexual overtones to the violence. Myers\\u2019s teenage victims are often with their partners when they are killed, and the women who survive \\u2014 like Curtis\\u2019s character in the first two films or Ellie Cornell\\u2019s in the fourth \\u2014 are the ones without sexual relationships.\", \"But as I watch these movies, I am struck by this theme of fear and failure, and by the ways in which the world, as represented by Myers, makes a mockery of our pretense to safety, security and control.\", \"My Tuesday column was inspired by my recent reread of large chunks of the sociologist Oliver Cromwell Cox\\u2019s book \\u201cCaste, Class, and Race: A Study in Social Dynamics.\\u201d\", \"My Friday column is a look at the Guarantee Clause of the Constitution, and how it might be used to fight democratic backsliding in the states.\", \"I joined the good folks at the Slate Culture Gabfest to talk about the new Marvel Studios movie, \\u201cThe Eternals,\\u201d as well as the latest season of \\u201cSuccession\\u201d and the controversy over critical race theory.\", \"I also have a podcast of my own! It\\u2019s called \\u201cUnclear and Present Danger.\\u201d My friend John Ganz and I discuss the political and military thrillers of the 1990s, and try to place them in the context of the post-Cold War moment. Our first episode is on \\u201cThe Hunt for Red October,\\u201d and our second episode is on \\u201cPatriot Games.\\u201d You should give it a listen!\", \"William Hogeland on the fight over the 1619 Project in Slate magazine.\", \"John Reeves on the Allen C.

Cabbage cooked nearly an hour in a spiced tomato sauce, topped with dill and sour cream. It is incredible and can be served with any number of dishes, or even on its own. Recipe comes from Bon App\\u00e9tit magazine.\", \"Ingredients\", \"Directions\", \"Preheat oven to 350\\u00b0. Mix tomato paste, garlic, coriander, cumin and red pepper flakes in a small bowl.\", \"Cut cabbage in half through core. Cut each half through core into 4 wedges.\", \"Heat \\u00bc cup oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Working in batches if needed, add cabbage to pan cut side down and season with salt. Cook, turning occasionally, until lightly charred, about 4 minutes per side. Transfer cabbage to a plate.\", \"Pour remaining \\u00bc cup oil into skillet. Add spiced tomato paste and cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until tomato paste begins to split and slightly darken, 2\\u20133 minutes. Pour in enough water to come halfway up sides of pan (about 1\\u00bd cups), season with salt, and bring to a simmer. Nestle cabbage wedges back into skillet (they should have shrunk while browning; a bit of overlap is OK). Transfer cabbage to oven and bake, uncovered and turning wedges halfway through, until very tender, liquid is mostly evaporated, and cabbage is caramelized around the edges, 50 minutes to an hour.\", \"Scatter dill over cabbage.
