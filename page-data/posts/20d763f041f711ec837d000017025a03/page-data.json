We were constantly embarrassed in the guidance counselor's office, pleading our case as parents doing our best. She didn't turn in her homework, she had behavioral problems, she was 'sick' more than anyone I've ever known to be.\\\"\", \"Returning to the incident during Mary's senior year\\u2014which occurred several years ago\\u2014the Redditor explained that her daughter \\\"kept saying the same thing, that her head hurt.\\\" Eventually, a doctor diagnosed her with a concussion and for a period of time, she only attended half-days at school. \\\"She was cleared to go back in November but only for half days, but we both worked until 4pm or later.
