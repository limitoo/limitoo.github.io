According to my research \\u2014 and if any entomologists are reading, please sound off in the comments with corrections \\u2014 \\u201cworm\\u201d might be a less appropriate term for a paper-eating critter than silverfish, biscuit beetle or even cockroach.

Kay is a former war correspondent who retreats to a small town with her children to chill out. The house she rents is fringed with maples and sits on acres of forest; it has poor cellphone service (warning sign No. 1) and a hidden crawl space in one of the bathrooms (warning sign No. 2).\", \"Gradually it becomes clear that an act of unspeakable violence has occurred inside the house \\u2014 and Kay, being a journalist, proceeds to annoy everyone in the small town by trying to solve the mystery. This causes her to intersect with the novel\\u2019s second protagonist, Ben, a recovering junkie trying to regain moral agency in a world that seems precision-designed to strip him of it. Other topics covered include drug trafficking, adultery and logging.

I persisted because I loved one of the author\\u2019s previous novels so much that the idea of skipping this one, smelly though it was, was inconceivable.\", \"Here we have the tale of a 55-year-old Angolan journalist who goes for a swim in the ocean and finds a camera floating in the water. When he gets the film developed, he discovers that the camera belongs to a Mozambican artist who stages and photographs her own dreams. He tracks her down. They discuss orchids and death. Intrigue ensues. Agualusa\\u2019s prose, as translated by Daniel Hahn from the Portuguese, is wry and lucid and weird.
