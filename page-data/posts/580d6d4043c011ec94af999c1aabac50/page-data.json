But until a few weeks ago, I hadn\\u2019t known that the company\\u2019s headquarters were in San Francisco, let alone that the original store was two miles from where I live now.\", \"In fact, three-quarters of the company\\u2019s 250 shops are in California, the See\\u2019s chief executive, Pat Egan, told me. It is one of the oldest businesses founded in the state.\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re born in California you take it for granted,\\u201d Egan said.\", \"Concerned I had some California blind spots, I made a recent plea on Twitter for people to name foods they associate with California.\", \"There are some easy ones, where it\\u2019s right in the name: California cuisine, California-style pizza (it\\u2019s real, there\\u2019s a Wikipedia page), the California roll and the California burrito.\", \"And there are crops we grow in abundance: avocados, almonds, pistachios, grapes, boysenberries, strawberries, garlic and more.\", \"But beyond that, things get murkier. My Twitter question yielded hundreds of suggestions and a fair amount of bickering but no clear answer.\", \"Plenty of chains started here \\u2014 In-N-Out, McDonald\\u2019s, King Taco, Taco Bell, Tommy\\u2019s and Trader Joe\\u2019s \\u2014 but so many have expanded out of state that the California association has faded.\", \"California has specialty dishes, but they tend to be regional: Santa Maria tri-tip, the San Francisco fish stew cioppino, Los Angeles\\u2019s chicken and waffles, bacon-wrapped hot dogs and doughnuts sold in pink paper boxes.\", \"There are Asian and Latin American foods that California does well \\u2014 tacos, burritos, Korean BBQ, dim sum, sriracha \\u2014 but you could argue those aren\\u2019t truly Californian because they originated elsewhere.\", \"The obvious rub here is that there are nearly 40 million people living in California and probably just as many opinions about what constitutes Californian food. And, as I\\u2019ve realized about myself, we enjoy a certain happy ignorance about the things we eat.\", \"The snacks we binged late at night in college or the takeout we grab on the way home from work feel like such personal choices that we\\u2019re rarely thinking about their place in a greater food taxonomy. The meals are satisfying and available, and that\\u2019s the end of it.\", \"When I asked my co-worker raised in the Bay Area about California foods, she brought up boba tea, Philz Coffee, Ike\\u2019s Sandwiches and sourdough bread. But she didn\\u2019t mention two of her favorites \\u2014 See\\u2019s and the chocolate-dipped ice cream sandwiches IT\\u2019S-ITs \\u2014 because she hadn\\u2019t known their California roots.\", \"It wasn\\u2019t until she was watching the Netflix show \\u201cNever Have I Ever,\\u201d and saw a Sherman Oaks family with a See\\u2019s Candies cabinet that she realized her parents had also tended to buy See\\u2019s boxes in bulk. And it wasn\\u2019t until her conversation with me that she realized perhaps there was something Californian about this.\", \"When I was a kid, I dismissed See\\u2019s because I didn\\u2019t like picking through the assorted boxes that often sat on our kitchen counter. It wasn\\u2019t until high school when my best friend dragged me into a See\\u2019s store that I got to choose my flavors and my opinion changed. (My favorites are the raspberry creams.)\", \"Last week, I walked into a See\\u2019s shop and took in the familiar black-and-white checkered floor and the framed photo of Mary See.\", \"Charles See began the business in 1921 using his mother Mary\\u2019s recipes for maple walnut creams, Victoria toffee and other candies. The company quickly expanded \\u2014 it had a dozen stores in Los Angeles by 1925, later moved into shopping malls and in 1972 was sold to the billionaire Warren Buffett \\u2014 but Mary\\u2019s face still appears on every See\\u2019s box.\", \"The woman working behind the counter offered me a free sample, a tradition whose origins I\\u2019ve learned have been lost to history.\", \"She reached across the glass case to hand me a special chocolate created for the company\\u2019s centennial. I gladly accepted the little piece of California.\", \"For more:\", \"On another food front, Florida\\u2019s governor this week tried to lure In-N-Out Burger out of California \\u2014 gasp! \\u2014 where the chain was founded, and into the Sunshine State.\", \"In-N-Out, a California institution since 1948, has refused to enforce local health rules in several parts of California that require customers to show proof of Covid-19 vaccination to enter the indoor areas of businesses, including restaurants.\", \"\\u201cWe refuse to become the vaccination police,\\u201d the company said last month after repeated violations of San Francisco\\u2019s local mandate forced health inspectors to temporarily shut down its Fisherman\\u2019s Wharf location. Since then, indoor dining has been suspended at the restaurant, along with several others in Contra Costa County.\", \"More than 250 of the chain\\u2019s 370-plus locations are in California. The impending showdown has intensified Republican claims that California, led by Democrats, is less business-friendly than G.O.P.-dominated states such as Florida and Texas.\", \"Last month, after the closure in San Francisco, Florida\\u2019s chief financial officer, Jimmy Patronis, wrote to In-N-Out\\u2019s president, Lynsi Snyder-Ellingson, expressing his sympathy and noting that Florida opposes \\u201charsh lockdowns and mandates.\\u201d\", \"On Monday, as the city of Los Angeles began a sweeping new vaccine mandate that includes indoor dining, that overture was followed by one from Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida.\", \"\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t in the room during the call, but I understand it was a productive conversation,\\u201d the Florida governor\\u2019s spokeswoman, Christina Pushaw, wrote in an email. \\u201cIf they can identify suppliers for all their ingredients here, which we believe is possible, In-N-Out could expand to Florida.\\u201d\", \"Not so fast, In-N-Out has since countered.\", \"\\u201cThe phone call was at the request of Gov. DeSantis and the primary purpose was to establish a business relationship,\\u201d the company\\u2019s chief legal counsel and business officer, Arnie Wensinger, said in a statement. \\u201cWhile we are thankful for the gracious invitation, In-N-Out Burger has no plans or intention to expand operations or move its corporate headquarters to Florida.\\u201d\", \"State records show that, as recently as April, In-N-Out was awarded a $7 million tax credit in return for a commitment to create 224 new jobs in its home state. \\u201cCalifornia is passionate about supporting local businesses, and In-N-Out is a California tradition,\\u201d said a spokeswoman for Gov. Gavin Newsom, Erin Mellon.\", \"At an economic summit this week, Newsom noted that California\\u2019s economy has rebounded considerably despite pandemic restrictions. And he had fightin\\u2019 words of his own for Republican rivals: \\u201cEat your heart out, Texas and \\u2014 I\\u2019m going to add, just as a little punctuation, especially \\u2014 Florida.\\u201d\", \"\\u2014 Shawn Hubler, Times correspondent based in Sacramento\", \"Nineteen recipes that your kids will actually eat.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from Max Farbman, who recommends the Monarch Butterfly Sanctuary Park in Pacific Grove near Monterey:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
