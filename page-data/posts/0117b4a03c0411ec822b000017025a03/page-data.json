However, an online petition that racked up about 1,030 signatures by Tuesday morning spurred the school to cancel his appearance.\", \"The petition said that Meacham's \\\"beliefs and core values do not align with those of Samford University, as it is a Southern Baptist institution,\\\" and described his scheduled address as \\\"alarming for the future of Samford.\\\" Planned Parenthood provides abortions and other reproductive health services in the U.S. and beyond.\", \"Beck A.
