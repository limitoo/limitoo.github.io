I pray to God if you have any children they die in your face.\\\"\", \"The threats ramped up after then-President Donald Trump verbally attacked her and her late husband John at a campaign rally in December 2019, the Michigan Democrat said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"He made very public comments about John looking up from hell. And I was just stunned by it,\\\" Dingell said.\\u00a0\", \"It's not only verbal abuse. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"I had men in front of my house with assault weapons after [Fox News host] Tucker Carlson had done a rant on me,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"In November, her Dearborn office was vandalized.\", \"The threats have had an impact on her and she worries that speaking out about it could make her more of a target. Other lawmakers declined to speak with CBS News because they didn't want to normalize the violent threats.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I'm trying not to let it get to me,\\\" Dingell said. \\\"But it doesn't mean that some nights when you're home and alone and you don't have the husband you love anymore, you don't get scared.\\\"\", \"A year after the January 6 riot, the Capitol Police says the threats to lawmakers are at an all-time high.

The rise in threats is a direct reflection of the current political discourse, he said.\", \"\\\"We're seeing more people out there putting out more threatening rhetoric. We're seeing more people out there justifying violence in their rhetoric,\\\" Scalora told CBS News. \\\"This is the most concern I've ever had in 20 years.\\\"\", \"\\\"We're being stretched.

The department is also looking to add 280 new officers this year and is opening field offices in California and Florida to investigate these threats more efficiently.\\u00a0\", \"Dingell said voters need to hold politicians accountable for their tone at the polls if the country is going to change course.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We all need to think about what we're saying to each other, what we're doing to each other,\\\" she said. \\\"Who I really worry about is the kids, the young people in our office who believe in public service, who believe in our democracy, who are frequently the ones that hear those messages first before we do.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"56528a3e6ef011ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"56528a3e6ef011ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
