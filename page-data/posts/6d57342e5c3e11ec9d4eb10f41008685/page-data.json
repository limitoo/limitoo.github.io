She was also the 50th bear rescued by the organization in the country over the course of 20 rescue missions.\", \"Most of these bears were rescued from dedicated bile farms but Four Paws also saved some from wildlife traffickers.\", \"\\\"The rescue of Tu Do went very smoothly. When we arrived she was calm, friendly, and curious. She's a very small bear and a little underweight,\\\" Emily Lloyd, an animal manager at the bear sanctuary in Ninh Binh, said in a statement.\", \"Veterinarians conducted a health check of the bear, revealing that she had gallstones. This means she will need surgery to remover her gallbladder in the future. The bear is also suffering from moderate liver and dental disease.\", \"\\\"We will now provide dedicated care for her and begin her rehabilitation to a better life,\\\" Lloyd said.\", \"According to Hong Kong-based charity Animals Asia Foundation, bear bile has been used in traditional Asian medicine for thousands of years.\", \"In the 1980s, the practice of farming bears to extract their bile spread across the continent. Now there are at least 10,000 bears being kept for this purpose despite the fact that herbal and synthetic alternatives with the same properties are available.\", \"According to the charity the extraction of bear bile from living bears causes \\\"unimaginable physical and psychological suffering and long-term health problems.\\\" Several extraction techniques exist, all of which are invasive and traumatic.\", \"Most bears on bile farms live in tiny cages amid unhygienic conditions and often suffer from poor health. Their owners often starve them and allow the animals to become dehydrated because this can encourage bile production.\", \"Vietnam has banned the sale and possession of bear bile but the practice has persisted due to legal loopholes and continued demand.\", \"While bear bile production has declined in recent years in Vietnam, Four Paws said there were still more than 300 bears continuing to suffer in the country's bear farms, with the capital Hanoi remaining a hotspot.\", \"\\\"Many provinces have been working hard to end bear farming, but Hanoi province has shown only very little improvement, reflecting poorly upon overall efforts of the government,\\\" Barbara van Genne from Four Paws said in a statement. \\\"We urge the government to do everything in its power to reach their goal of ending bear farming for good by 2025.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950547/rescued-bear-tu-do.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Rescue of the bear Tu Do from from a bear bile farm in Son La Province, Vietnam, on December 11, 2021.</div>\"]","href_hash":"6d57342e5c3e11ec9d4eb10f41008685"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6d57342e5c3e11ec9d4eb10f41008685"}},
