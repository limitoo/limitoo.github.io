key thing,\\\" he said.\", \"The park is\\u00a0exporting about 10MW\\u00a0of its capacity and hopes to improve this to 25MW, or 50 per cent, by Christmas.\", \"The half owner of KEP, Windlab, spent $160 million developing the generator in a significant boost to the local economy during the height of the district's drought.\", \"But problems with connecting to the grid led to legal troubles with contractors, and the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) stated that agreed performance standards for transmission had not been met for the generator to begin exporting power.\", \"That resulted in Windlab writing-down the value of KEP by $29.4 million last year.\", \"Despite the CSIRO identifying the region as ideal for electricity generation \\u2014 with 320 days of sunshine per year and
