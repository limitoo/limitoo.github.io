Her car payments. Shopping sprees at Bergdorf Goodman, Bloomingdale\\u2019s, Ferragamo, Neiman Marcus, Manolo Blahnik, Tiffany\\u2019s and other luxury retailers. Her brother and nephew, whom she put on the payroll of the nonprofit, Millennium Care.\", \"All together, Ms. Perry, 66, admitted using money the city paid Millennium Care to cover over $1 million in personal credit card bills, according to a plea agreement with the state attorney general\\u2019s office she signed on Friday. She took $2,394,169 from Millennium Care beyond her official salary.\", \"Even after the attorney general\\u2019s office came after her for failing to file taxes three years in a row, she kept defrauding the authorities, belatedly reporting, for instance, $31,358 in income for 2015 when Millennium Care actually paid her over $700,000, according to the agreement.\", \"\", \"Ms. Perry was able to use the nonprofit as her personal piggy bank in part because it had no board of directors, failed to file required financial reports with the state and the I.R.S., and, according to the plea agreement, \\u201ccarried out its business in a persistently illegal manner.\\u201d\", \"And so Ms. Perry, who owns two houses in the Bronx and also runs a dance studio, becomes the latest city homeless shelter operator found to have committed fiscal wrongdoing.\", \"In the plea bargain, reached in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Ms. Perry pleaded guilty to tax fraud and Millennium Care pleaded guilty to grand larceny. Ms. Perry was sentenced to five years\\u2019 probation and must pay $1.1 million in taxes and penalties. Millennium Care will pay a fine of $2,394,169 \\u2014 the exact amount that Ms. Perry overpaid herself \\u2014 and will be dissolved.\", \"\\u201cStealing money that is earmarked for people experiencing homelessness is as immoral as it is illegal,\\u201d Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement about Ms. Perry on Monday.\", \"The shelter is now run by one of the city\\u2019s biggest shelter providers, Acacia Network, and continues to house families without minor children, as it did during Ms. Perry\\u2019s time. In 2013, while Ms. Perry was running Millennium Care, Acacia sued Millennium Care, charging that Millennium owed it $654,000 for social services it provided at the shelter; the status of the lawsuit was not clear. \", \"Ms. Perry, whose biography on the site of her dance studio, Millennium Dance Company, says she studied with Alvin Ailey and Martha Graham, was one of founding directors of Millennium Care when it formed in 1992.\", \"Ms. Perry\\u2019s lawyer, Frank L. Perrone Jr., said that she had already paid over $200,000 of the back taxes she owed and noted that notwithstanding Ms. James\\u2019s comments, only Millennium Care, not Ms. Perry, had pleaded guilty to larceny. Mr. Perrone is also Millennium Care\\u2019s lawyer.\", \"The nonprofits that the city contracts with to run shelters have been so rife with self-dealing, nepotism and conflicts of interest that Mayor Bill de Blasio has ordered an audit of every nonprofit group in the system. Nine of the 62 groups that run shelters are on an internal city \\u201cwatch list.\\u201d\", \"Earlier this year, for example, the former head of one of the city\\u2019s biggest shelter networks, Victor Rivera, was charged with pocketing hundreds of thousands of dollars in kickbacks from contractors.\", \"Last year, the city filed a suit accusing a nonprofit called Childrens Community Services, which operated 28 shelters, of defrauding it by funneling payments to subcontractors that did not provide the supplies and services they were paid for.\", \"On Monday, the city cut ties with another of its biggest shelter operators, CORE Services Group, after a New York Times investigation found that CORE\\u2019s chief executive, Jack A. Brown III, steered millions of dollars from the city to for-profit companies he controlled and paid himself more than $1 million a year.\"]","href_hash":"8d98fd344c9a11ec9729f9897f532c78"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8d98fd344c9a11ec9729f9897f532c78"}},
