Governor Kathy Hochul announced the reinstatement of the mandate Friday, saying masks are required in all indoor public spaces unless the businesses or venues require proof of vaccination. Violators could face criminal and civil penalties, such as a fine of up to $1,000.\", \"The mandate will be in effect until January 15, with implementation left in the hands of local counties.\", \"\\\"We're entering a time of uncertainty and we could either plateau here or our cases could get out of control,\\\" Hochul said during a public appearance in New York City, according to the Associated Press.\", \"Republicans in some counties, such as Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro, Putnam County Executive MaryEllen Odell, Rockland County Executive Ed Day, said they wouldn't divert local health department resources into the implementation of the mandate.\", \"However, on Monday, Hochul said she hopes and expects a majority of local health departments to implement the mandate. She asked for help from disinclined county executives who are requesting help from the state regarding the surge in hospitalizations.\", \"\\\"It's a very simple temporary measure which is driven by our need to get this under control,\\\" said Hochul.\", \"For the first time since April 20, state COVID hospitalizations surpassed 3,600, according to NBC New York.
