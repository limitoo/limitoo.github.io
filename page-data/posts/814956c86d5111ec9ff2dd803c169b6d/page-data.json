Tesla on Friday announced the opening of its showroom in Urumqi, the Xinjiang capital, and said on its Chinese social media account, \\\"Let's start Xinjiang's all-electric journey!\\\" \\u00a0 The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), an American organization based in Washington, D.C., on Monday urged Tesla and its chairman, Elon Musk, to close the showroom and \\\"cease what amounts to economic support for genocide.\\\" \\u00a0 Pressure on foreign companies to take positions on Xinjiang, Tibet, Taiwan and other politically charged issues has been rising. The ruling Communist Party pushes companies to adopt its positions in their advertising and on websites. It has attacked clothing and other brands that express concern about \\u00a0reports of forced labor and other abuses in Xinjiang.\", \"\\\"No American corporation should be doing business in a region that is the focal point of a campaign of genocide targeting a religious and ethnic minority,\\\" CAIR's communications director, Ibrahim Hooper, said in a statement. \\u00a0 Activists and foreign governments say some 1 million Uyghurs and members of other mostly Muslim minorities have been confined in detention camps in Xinjiang. Chinese officials reject accusations of abuses and say the camps are for job training and to combat extremism. \\u00a0 On Friday, the ruling party's discipline agency threatened Walmart Inc. with a boycott after some shoppers complained online they couldn't find goods from Xinjiang in its Walmart and Sam's Club stores in China. \\u00a0 In December, Intel Corp., the world's biggest maker of computer chips, apologized for asking suppliers \\u00a0to avoid sourcing goods from Xinjiang after the state press attacked the company and comments online called for a boycott of its goods.\", \"The United States has barred imports of goods from Xinjiang unless they can be shown not to be made by forced labor. \\u00a0 China is one of Tesla's biggest markets. The company's first factory outside the United States opened in Shanghai in 2019. \\u00a0 Other foreign auto brands including Volkswagen, General Motors and Nissan Motor Co. have showrooms in Xinjiang operated by the automakers' Chinese joint-venture partners. VW also operates a factory in Urumqi.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"814956c86d5111ec9ff2dd803c169b6d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"814956c86d5111ec9ff2dd803c169b6d"}},
