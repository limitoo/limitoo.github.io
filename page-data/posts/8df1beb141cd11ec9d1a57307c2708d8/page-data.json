The last of the original members of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, it was removed from the index in 2018.\", \"GE refashioned itself in recent years from the sprawling conglomerate created by Jack Welch in the 1980s to a much smaller and focused entity.\\u00a0\", \"With its announcement Tuesday that it will spin off its health care business in early 2023 and its energy segment, including renewable energy, power and digital operations in early 2024, General Electric may have signaled the end of the conglomerate era.\", \"\\\"By creating three industry-leading, global public companies, each can benefit from greater focus, tailored capital allocation, and strategic flexibility to drive long-term growth and value for customers, investors, and employees,\\\" Chairman and CEO Lawrence Culp Jr. said in a prepared statement.\", \"We are excited to announce that GE is forming three industry-leading, global public companies focused on the growth sectors of aviation, healthcare, and energy. https://t.co/DIFs2jU7O9 pic.twitter.com/O8DwrIOmF1\", \"Culp will become nonexecutive chairman of the health care company.
