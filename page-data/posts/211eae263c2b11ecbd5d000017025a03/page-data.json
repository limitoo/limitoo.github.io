Last year it produced 148,000 tons of the local banana, most of which were shipped to Spain's mainland. While usually more expensive than imported bananas from Latin America and Africa, the smaller Canary Island banana is often preferred for its sweeter taste and meatier texture.\", \"Authorities have pledged financial aid to help the sector and fund furloughs for workers. They have also promised to revise a law that says that new land formed by the lava is the property of the state.\", \"Desalination plants have been shipped in to supply the water-dependent banana trees at points where lava flows have wrecked the irrigation systems.
