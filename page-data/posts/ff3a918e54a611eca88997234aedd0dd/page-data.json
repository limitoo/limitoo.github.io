It is an area where hikers have fallen and died in the past.\", \"Following a 2019 fatality, National Parks System spokeswoman Eleanor Siebers told CNN it was estimated that nine hikers had died falling from the trail since 2004.\", \"An estimated 14 hikers have died from the Angels Landing portion of the trail since 1987, though the real figure could be as high as 20, according to a compilation of news articles from hiking guide website DownTheTrail.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945480/zion-national-park-angels-landing-trail.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> In this May 8, 2011, photo Hikers climb down the Angels Landing trail in Zion National Park, in Utah. Zion National Park will soon require reservations to hike the famous southern Utah trail perched on the edge of a red-rock cliff, officials said Friday.</div>\", \"The lottery will be fairer to visitors and reduce crowding on the trail, said superintendent Jeff Bradybaugh.\", \"There will be two lotteries, one seasonal and another for one day ahead of planned hikes. Each drawing costs $6 per person to enter and people who win must pay a $3 per person fee. That will cover the cost of running the lottery and rangers to check permits on the trail.\", \"The permit system will apply specifically to the narrowest section of the trail, often called the \\\"chain section\\\" because it has metal handholds driven into the rock.\", \"Park officials did not immediately say how many people will be allowed per day, but planning documents outlined a previous experiment that limited visitors over Memorial Day weekend to 120 people per hour on the trail.\", \"The new system is considered a pilot project and could be adjusted as needed.
