He is unlikely to win in a city where registered Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly seven to one.\", \"The comptroller oversees the city\\u2019s public pension funds, whose assets total nearly $300 billion, and audits city agencies.\", \"The post also frequently attracts politicians with higher aspirations. The departing New York City comptroller, Scott M. Stringer, ran for mayor, as did his two predecessors, John C. Liu and William C. Thompson Jr.\", \"Mr. Lander supports efforts to make the city\\u2019s pension fund investments more environmentally friendly and has promised to expand upon them.

Mr. Carreras participated in the debate remotely because he declined to provide proof of vaccination \\u2014 something he said was a violation of privacy.\", \"During the debate, the moderator, Errol Louis, cut Mr. Carreras off, saying that NY1 did not traffic in \\u201cmisinformation\\u201d about the vaccine.\", \"Mr. Carreras has also been spotted on the campaign trail wearing a yellow Jewish star, of the sort the Nazis made Jews wear during the Holocaust, in protest against vaccine mandates.\"]","href_hash":"145940383c0411ecab72000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"145940383c0411ecab72000017025a03"}},
