My house is completely inundated with water and silt. [It's] pretty dramatic. This is actually worse than 2004.\\\"\", \"The February 2004 floods damaged about 200 homes and forced about 500 people to evacuate in Manawat\\u016b.\", \"Rush has heard a Bailey bridge could be put up within a couple of days so people can get in and out of the area.\", \"Until then she is staying with a neighbour and facing a massive clean-up.\", \"As the waters rose on Wednesday, she saved what she could.\", \"\\\"I battled it. I had to go and rescue my dogs from their kennels. I've got little dogs and they were all floating in their kennels. They were swimming.\", \"\\\"I got them out and made sure they were safe. I just kept battling the torrent of water, and it was a torrent of water.\\\"\", \"Her house is surrounded by waste from logging operations and silt.

It's had about 250mm for the month, well above average.\", \"When a heavy shower fell this morning the town's western roads turned into streams of water, although they cleared quickly when the rain stopped.\", \"On Wednesday evening the same roads were more like rivers.\", \"On Gladstone Terrace, the lower floor of Megan Pirret's house filled with water as a stream next door swelled.\", \"Today, a tide mark with duck weed sticking to every surface shows where the water lapped.\", \"Megan's father Chris, who lives in the house, said the water was powerful enough to pick up a freezer of meat, and it destroyed many of his possessions.\", \"\\\"Everything you're looking at here has been under water,\\\" he said when standing in the two-storey home's lower floor,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We salvaged a little bit of stuff, like all my chainsaws and bikes, but all the bedding, the whole complete wash house is knackered, washing machine, dryer, microwave, all gone. It's saddening.\", \"\\\"Then the hard work starts. Head to head with the insurance companies now.\\\"\", \"Next door Alicia Field also has a sopping ground floor.\", \"She said the water came in two waves, the first just after 5pm on Wednesday and the next a couple of hours later. The gap between meant she could move some items into her upper floor.\", \"One of her sons has a bedroom on her lower floor and the bed in there was picked up by the current.\", \"\\\"I had my grandmother's dressing table and things, but we were able to get that upstairs prior to the water coming in.\", \"\\\"It was honestly like a scene out of the Titanic, so you know where the water's coming up the hallway in the ship.
