This drive to honor and dignify people through representation comes at an ethical cost that often goes unremarked, though: Does exposing your sitters to the viewer\\u2019s gaze turn them into things to be looked at, emptied of their hidden complexities? Can you paint someone\\u2019s portrait while still insisting that vision cannot \\u2014 perhaps even should not \\u2014 capture all there is to know?\", \"I don\\u2019t know any artist right now who is doing as much to address these questions as Jennifer Packer, whose retrospective is on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art. While painting her subjects, usually those closest to her, with a deep sensitivity, she allows them to stay just beyond our visual grasp. It\\u2019s an act of protectiveness and care that is moving and still leaves the viewer with much to contemplate.\", \"The title of the exhibition, \\u201cThe Eye Is Not Satisfied With Seeing,\\u201d refers to a passage from Ecclesiastes that\\u00a0describes the human yearning for knowledge that can never be sated. It\\u2019s a paradoxical but entirely apt entry point for this painter, whose work is based on keen observation, while consistently probing the limits of representation.\", \"The 35 works here depict friends and acquaintances in domestic interiors; bouquets of flowers, some of which were painted to commemorate those who have died, often Black victims of police violence; and a handful of rarely seen drawings. They date from 2011, the year before Packer graduated from Yale\\u2019s M.F.A. program, to the present.\", \"They include her largest painting, \\u201cBlessed Are Those Who Mourn (Breonna! Breonna!),\\u201d made during the Covid lockdown in 2020. At around 10 feet by 14 feet of unstretched canvas tacked to the wall, it has presence that is both monumental and informal. The title refers, of course, to Breonna Taylor, the 26-year-old Black medical worker killed by police in her home in Louisville, Ky., in March 2020 \\u2014 an event, along with the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis, that sparked Black Lives Matter protests nationwide that May.\", \"The picture, awash in acid yellow tones, is based on photographs of Taylor\\u2019s apartment. Packer pays particular attention to the ordinary objects that occupied what should have been a place of refuge. The artist makes you work to see her paintings, and they reward such sustained looking: Out of the largely monochromatic surface emerge a ghostly fly swatter, a box fan, a poster with an inspirational aphorism, pages from a Batman comic, an iron, a wood-grained kitchen cabinet, and more. They appear in ways that don\\u2019t always make sense. Why is the chessboard next to the stove? What, if anything, are these objects sitting upon or attached to? Why are some barely delineated while others finely rendered? The logic is that of a mind seizing on inconsequential things in the process of coming to terms with an overwhelming grief.\", \"In the foreground, a shirtless man wearing blue basketball shorts sleeps on a tufted couch. As with much of the work in the show, subtle art-historical references accumulate and clash to convey complex moods. In this case, the figure\\u2019s tilted-back head evokes vulnerability and pleasure (think Girodet\\u2019s neoclassical painting \\u201cThe Sleep of Endymion\\u201d), pathos (the severed heads of corpses painted by G\\u00e9ricault), and martyrdom (any number of Renaissance Pietas, or Jacques-Louis David\\u2019s \\u201cDeath of Marat\\u201d).\", \"What you do not see in this canvas, however, is Breonna Taylor herself.\", \"Packer speaks of painting as a means of bearing witness to Black life. But bearing witness does not mean, for this artist, serving up her sitters to the viewer\\u2019s hungry gaze. As if in defiance of the endless videos and photographs of people who have been subject to state-sanctioned and institutional violence that flood our social media streams, Packer allows Taylor a rare privilege: that of privacy.\", \"The same is true of her flower still lifes, in which delicate blossoms and foliage appear to float in an indeterminate space. The artist refers to some of these as funerary bouquets \\u2014 acts of commemoration that let her, as she said in a recent interview, \\u201cmove through her grief,\\u201d whether of a specific person or a generalized sense of loss. \\u201cSay Her Name\\u201d (2017) is a modern-day memento mori marking the death of Sandra Bland, the young civil rights activist, while in police custody in 2015 after her arrest for a minor traffic violation. Her death sparked renewed attention to police violence against Black women.\", \"Packer approaches her sitters with unfailing tenderness and generosity. Some of her subjects are familiar faces from the art world: the curator Jessica Bell Brown appears in \\u201cJess\\u201d (2018), the artists Eric N. Mack in \\u201cThe Body Has Memory\\u201d (2018) and \\u201cEric (II)\\u201d (2013), Tomashi Jackson in \\u201cTomashi\\u201d (2016), and Jordan Casteel in \\u201cJordan\\u201d (2014).\", \"It is an endlessly fascinating paradox that, through a careful study of gesture, Packer creates convincing representations of real people even though her subjects often disappear into their monochromatic surroundings, or are made hard to see fully in other ways. Sketchy, even agitated contours barely define them. Paint \\u2014 and with it, facial features and bodily definition \\u2014 is scraped off with the palette knife as often as it is laid on.\", \"In Packer\\u2019s canvases, the line between drawing and painting is infrathin, and so it is gratifying to see alongside the paintings a small selection of works on paper. Among them is \\u201cThe Mind Is Its Own Place\\u201d (2020). Here, lines define the two figures while simultaneously discomposing and merging them. A bent head drips febrile marks as if it\\u2019s melting off the page; a leg looks bent one way, though a gray wash and the untouched white of the paper suggest that it\\u2019s kneeling another way. Again we see the play between almost inchoate mark-making and stunning specificity: An undefined face is rubbed into the surface with charcoal, but its hand is picked out, clearly, with purple crayon.\", \"It is as if the more the artist looks, the less she knows. But this admission of unknowing \\u2014 a disarmingly humble assertion from an artist who verges on the virtuosic \\u2014 is a recognition of her subjects\\u2019 complex humanity that can never be contained by mere representation.\"]","href_hash":"896dcf18487711ec915317c2b5936622"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"896dcf18487711ec915317c2b5936622"}},
