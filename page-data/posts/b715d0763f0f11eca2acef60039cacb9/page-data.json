By midafternoon, a long, winding line of protesters was making its way through the city, taking more than an hour to pass a fixed point.\", \"The protest illustrated how the battle to curb climate change had become an umbrella for a growing protest movement that aims to put global leaders under pressure for a broad range of causes, including racial justice and income equality.\", \"\\u201cWe should not underestimate the significance of how the climate movement has broken through into the mainstream in the last two years because it\\u2019s really starting to change people\\u2019s consciousness,\\u201d said Feyzi Ismail, a lecturer in global policy and activism at Goldsmiths, University of London.\", \"\\u201cI think it is more important than what\\u2019s going on inside the COP meeting because it\\u2019s applying the kind of pressure that\\u2019s needed to force governments to act, but also to take far more radical positions than they might have,\\u201d she added.\", \"Many of the protesters have made a connection to their own lives.\", \"\\u201cFlooding is happening, and it is going to keep happening,\\u201d said Alexandra Bryden, 63, an upholsterer and curtain maker from Auchterarder, north of Edinburgh, who said that her workshop had been flooded and that she worried about the future of her family members who live by the coast.\", \"According to some organizers, more than 200 events were planned around with the world, with more than half of that number in Britain.\", \"In Paris, hundreds of demonstrators gathered in front of City Hall, where activists held up portraits of world leaders they accused of doing too little to curb global warming. The leaders\\u2019 names, including President Biden and President Emmanuel Macron of France, were read out and then booed by the crowd. \\u201cOne, two and three degrees, that\\u2019s a crime against humanity,\\u201d the protesters chanted, before observing a minute of silence for the victims of climate change around the world.\", \"But the focus on Saturday was in Glasgow, where authorities were closing off several dozen streets to manage the arrival of what organizers said would be tens of thousands of protesters.\", \"\\u201cPeople are coming out in this weather to say we have had enough of this,\\u201d said Robert Dickie, 64, a retired accountant from Hamilton, Scotland, near Glasgow, wearing a kilt and speaking after playing the bagpipes.\", \"\\u201cThings have got to change before we all become extinct \\u2014 and that is what is going to happen in the long term,\\u201d he said.\", \"Saturday\\u2019s march was the culmination of smaller protests that took place during the week around the city, including a youth-led demonstration on Friday organized by the group Fridays for Future, an international movement that grew out of Greta Thunberg\\u2019s solo school strike in 2018. She addressed the crowd on Friday and described COP26 as \\u201ca failure.\\u201d\", \"The first week of the climate summit saw new pledges to tackle deforestation and to move away from coal. At least 105 countries signed an agreement to reduce emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, by 30 percent this decade. Major financial institutions said they would mobilize trillions of dollars to help shift the global economy toward cleaner energy.\", \"Still, experts say that, to avert the worst effects of climate change, temperature rise needs to be limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, or 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, between preindustrial times and the end of this century. And that goal is not within reach even if all countries fulfill their current pledges.\", \"Like many environmental groups, protesters in Glasgow were skeptical of pledges, doubting that such promises would be delivered and arguing that, in any case, they did not go far enough to solve an urgent global problem.\", \"\\u201cThere are going to be communities on the Scottish coast that will be cut off. It is real,\\u201d said Ms. Bryden, the upholsterer. \\u201cI can\\u2019t look my grandson in the eye. I am sorry about what he is going to have to put up with in the future.\\u201d\", \"Bel Burn, 59, a retired health worker from Cumbria, in northern England, said she was protesting because she opposed intensive agriculture and described how she had bought 20 acres of land, on which she planned to plant 4,200 trees.\", \"\\u201cWe are blaming China and we are blaming Brazil, but we are not doing enough, and I don\\u2019t see a strategy,\\u201d she said, sheltering from the rain.\", \"\\u201cThey haven\\u2019t gone far enough,\\u201d she added. \\u201cThey have agreed a lot of this stuff before, why would we believe it\\u2019s going to be different this time?\\u201d\", \"Stuart Graham, a Glasgow trade union official and a member of the COP26 Coalition that organized the protests, said he hoped the march would bolster campaigns for free public transportation and for a huge program to insulate and improve the city\\u2019s housing stock. \\u201cIt\\u2019s critical that we have a civil society with a powerful voice to hold these leaders to account,\\u201d he said.\", \"Organizers argue that the bewildering range of groups with different agendas are united by a common commitment to what they call climate justice.\", \"Katia Penha, one of the activists, who is also part of the Quilombola community, a group of Black rural residents in Brazil, said it was important to be in Glasgow this weekend to call attention to the concerns of those in the developing world who are often overlooked by global leaders. Her community has been affected by mining and wants its challenges to be acknowledged alongside Indigenous communities that are disproportionately affected.\", \"\\u201cWe came here to tell the world: Without us \\u2014 the Quilombola\\u2019s people in Brazil \\u2014 it\\u2019s not possible to have debate about climate change,\\u201d she said, pointing out how a burst hydroelectric dam in 2015 in Mariana, Brazil, killed Quilombola people and wiped out communities.\", \"Elsewhere, vegan activists carried balloons of a cow and a chicken with the message, \\u201cThank you for not eating us.\\u201d On a hillside, a group spelled out \\u201cAmazonia Forever\\u201d with strips of cloth above the image of a butterfly, calling attention to the destruction of the rainforest.\", \"So far, the violence that marked some of the protests in the early years of the summit, especially in 1999 in Seattle, has largely been avoided.\", \"Instead, youth groups and organizations that believe in nonviolent disruption, like Extinction Rebellion, have come to the fore.\", \"Ms. Ismail said that the question for the protest movement was whether it could extend its influence by combining with trade unions and persuading workers to use the threat of strikes to push forward a coherent agenda. But she said it had made strides already.\", \"\\u201cThe protest movement is the only thing that is going to change the situation,\\u201d Ms. Ismail said. \\u201cIf there is no pressure, there will be no change.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b715d0763f0f11eca2acef60039cacb9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b715d0763f0f11eca2acef60039cacb9"}},
