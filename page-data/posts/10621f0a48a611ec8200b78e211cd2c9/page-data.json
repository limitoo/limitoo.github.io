The post explained that criminals who wanted to commit crimes in his neighborhood were \\\"playing with fire.\\\" She also showed the defendant a reply he made in 2019 toward a post about committed crimes, simply saying, \\\"Arm up.\\\"\", \"He had also made an additional comment on the conversation that said his father, Gregory, who is also on trial for Arbery's death, was \\\"the same\\\" as his friend's father; the friend had told him that her father was \\\"slap crazy, old as dirt, and doesn't care about going to jail,\\\" said Dunikoski, implying that the context of the messages appeared to say that the older McMichael would commit vigilante justice if need be. Travis said in the conversation that he was \\\"beginning to feel the same.\\\"\", \"In response to the evidence, he admitted that he did write the Facebook posts and messages shown by Dunikoski.\", \"The revelation came on the second day of questioning the younger McMichael.
