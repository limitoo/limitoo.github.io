Instead, Tassler told Gless that she thought she had in book in her.\", \"\\u201cI dream a lot,\\u201d said Gless, \\u201cbut this was not something I dreamed of.\\u201d\", \"It took seven years, but Gless has come clean and then some in \\u201cApparently There Were Complaints,\\u201d a hilarious yet often affecting account of her metamorphosis: from the granddaughter of a film industry lawyer into the Emmy-winning actress behind one of TV\\u2019s most iconic characters, the New York City cop Christine Cagney. The book\\u2019s title captures its unflinching spirit: It\\u2019s how Gless explained to a friend her decision to go to rehab, not long after Cagney struggled with her own alcoholism on the show.\", \"Gless hated the process of writing the memoir, she admitted, but she loves being an author now that it\\u2019s done. And while she\\u2019s not sure if she has another book in her, she does believe that she has one more series.\", \"In the glow of a light-festooned palm in her home on Fisher Island, Fla. \\u2014 \\u201cMy husband\\u2019s birthday is at Christmas so he hates Christmas trees because it upstages him,\\u201d she laughed, referring to the \\u201cCagney & Lacey\\u201d executive producer Barney Rosenzweig \\u2014 Gless took what she called \\u201csentimental travels through my life.\\u201d\", \"Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"1. Ed Ruscha\\u2019s \\u201cPumping Sand\\u201d With my \\u201cCagney & Lacey\\u201d money, I was able to purchase a home in Malibu, and I bought it from a very famous producer, Doug Cramer. Doug was an art collector, and he left behind a piece of art for me as a gift. It was an Ed Ruscha graphic, and he said, \\u201cIt must stay in this beach house,\\u201d and I said, \\u201cWell, thank you.\\u201d\", \"I\\u2019m sure it\\u2019s bad taste to discuss money, but there was an Ed Ruscha show in New York last year and the Ed Ruscha Society asked if I would loan my graphic to them, and I said, \\u201cOf course. Do you insure it?\\u201d And they said, \\u201cYes, the value of it is around $400,000.\\u201d\", \"2. Union Station in Los Angeles I\\u2019m born and raised in Los Angeles. Union Station is a spectacular building, and as a child I used to go there to pick up my grandmother and other people who traveled across the United States. You\\u2019d see people always dressed so beautifully to travel in those days. I still enjoy going today and sitting on those highly, highly polished wooden benches, and just watching. It\\u2019s a tender spot.\", \"3. Broadway Classics at the Hollywood Bowl My grandfather had a box at the Hollywood Bowl, and he never used it. So he\\u2019d give the tickets to us, and my dad would take me to watch the Los Angeles symphony orchestra in that gorgeous setting at sunset. My two favorite nights were a Rodgers and Hammerstein night and a Lerner and Loewe night. I was enraptured.\", \"I constantly listened on my 33 1/3 records to every musical I could get my hands on. I knew every word. I always win bets with [my \\u201cCagney & Lacey\\u201d co-star] Tyne Daly, who has a Tony, on lyrics. She\\u2019s never won once.\", \"4. \\u201cGypsy\\u201d I saw Tyne do \\u201cGypsy\\u201d four times \\u2014 three in New York and once in Los Angeles. And in my humble opinion, I think she was the greatest Rose. We always think of musicals as being light but that performance was so desperate because Rose was desperate.\", \"5. Audra McDonald All the big Broadway greats were invited to sing at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. Hillary was about to be [nominated] and everybody showed up. Tyne and I were invited. Certainly Tyne qualifies as a Broadway singer, and I was invited to go along because I was Cagney. That\\u2019s when I met Audra. She has a world-class voice and a world-class soul. I\\u2019ve gotten know her since that evening, and I think she\\u2019s the best we have.\", \"6. Eddie Redmayne I was introduced to him as Stephen Hawking in \\u201cThe Theory of Everything.\\u201d He won the Oscar for it. And then the next year he did \\u201cThe Danish Girl,\\u201d and he should have won the Oscar again because he was absolutely brilliant. You never catch him acting. It\\u2019s such a thrill to watch talent like that.\", \"7. \\u201cHacks\\u201d \\u201cHacks\\u201d is a comedy, but Jean Smart could break my heart. And she\\u2019s an older actress, and she gives me such hope that that kind of career is still possible. There should be older women starring in shows on television. Older actresses have so much more to say.\", \"8. \\u201cRed Dragon\\u201d by Thomas Harris I love books that really frighten me. \\u201cRed Dragon\\u201d is where Hannibal Lecter was first introduced \\u2014 it wasn\\u2019t \\u201cSilence of the Lambs\\u201d \\u2014 and the description of him, I was petrified and I loved every moment of it. There was a quietness to him. A satisfaction. And he was quick! He could be the most calm \\u2014 I don\\u2019t know if tender is the right word because he was so evil. He could move faster than any other human being, and end a life in a second.\", \"9. Johnny Mathis Johnny Mathis formed my life. As a teenager, I used to dream about falling in love and I believed it would all happen because of these beautiful songs he\\u2019d sing. The first one that I ever heard of his was \\u201cMaria,\\u201d which had emerged from \\u201cWest Side Story.\\u201d The way he does it is like a choir singing. He makes the sound of her name sound so gorgeous. I have every album he\\u2019s ever made. He\\u2019s just magnificent.\", \"10. \\u201cAuntie Mame\\u201d When I was 14, my parents were divorcing and I was home from boarding school. My mother didn\\u2019t know what to do with me so she took me to Grauman\\u2019s Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard to see \\u201cAuntie Mame\\u201d every day. I\\u2019d sit there in the first-row balcony with my feet up on the brass railing and eat buttered popcorn, and I memorized every line. Rosalind Russell just did something to me. I was smart enough to know I could never play Mame. But she was everything I wanted to be.\"]","href_hash":"e85ae7ce680f11ec9b8587e297904086"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e85ae7ce680f11ec9b8587e297904086"}},
