to the eastern states and the rest of the\\u00a0world.\\u00a0\", \"Mr McGowan vowed to set the date in stone once the state reached the 80 per cent vaccination milestone for people over 12, which is due\\u00a0to happen today.\", \"Once the hard border comes down, international and interstate travel will resume, with testing and vaccination requirements.\", \"Under the government's transition plan released in November, interstate arrivals will be required to be double dose vaccinated, return a negative PCR test 72 hours prior to departure\\u00a0and undertake a test on arrival in WA.\", \"International arrivals would be required to do all of the above, as well as complete 14 days quarantine if they were deemed high risk, for example, if they were unvaccinated.\", \"Some restrictions would be introduced to help manage the spread of COVID-19 in WA, including face masks for some high-risk indoor settings and proof of vaccination for large events, nightclubs and the casino.\", \"Last week the Premier announced a plan to 'reconnect' WA with the world, by spending $185 million in measures to boost businesses and attract tourists, international students and workers to Western Australia when the state's borders reopen.\", \"The date was likely to be set for late January or early February, the Premier said, with an aim of reaching 90 per cent full vaccination across the over-12 cohort.\", \"It will be welcome news for families who have been separated since early last year, those who travel regularly for business, and even those just wanted to be able to holiday outside of WA.\\u00a0\", \"Few have been looking forward to the reopening more than the tourism sector, which has been hit hard by the pandemic.\\u00a0\", \"While some businesses have managed to stay
