local Australia Post office in Hawker, in Canberra's north.\", \"The store does not have wheelchair access, and when Mr Mitchell\\u00a0raised the issue with Australia Post, he was told to travel to

can't go in there?\", \"Mr Mitchell complained to Australia Post's customer service team, who told him that the closest wheelchair accessible branch was Belconnen Post Office, at Westfield.\\u00a0\", \"Mr Mitchell said travelling to Belconnen would mean he would have to pay for a wheelchair taxi, which he said was unfair given he had a local branch.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"To be told to travel three times the distance to another post office because my local one doesn't have wheelchair access, well, I don't think that's acceptable \\u2014 not in this day and age,\\\" he said.\", \"He believes a portable

some of our older post offices this can be difficult, where building heritage issues may also need to be considered,\\\" the spokesperson said.\", \"\\\"Despite the challenges posed by limitations on

unacceptable, unreasonable and unfair that anyone should have to sit or stand outside an inaccessible property of any type that's providing a service and beg to be noticed, beg to be able to get in,\\\" Mr Herd said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Australia Post is a public service, owned by the people of Australia, and it should be fully inclusive and fully accessible to all Australians.\\\"\", \"Mr Herd
