A practiced swing, Pringle covers the female parts in the ensemble of the new Broadway musical \\u201cMrs. Doubtfire.\\u201d She also understudies the role of Wanda, the social worker usually played by Charity Ang\\u00e9l Dawson.\", \"The musical was still in previews. Pringle had never really rehearsed as Wanda. But she had studied the script, mastered the choreography and watched dozens of performances. So when Dawson called out (for a reason unrelated to Covid-19), Pringle went on.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s the job,\\u201d she later explained. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the gig \\u2014 to be able to be thrown on in a moment\\u2019s notice and to be able to deliver.\\u201d\", \"Swings and understudies are the undersung heroes of Broadway theater. (Off Broadway and regional theater productions may or may not hire them, depending on a production\\u2019s budget and priorities.) If a curtain rises when one or more actors has suffered illness or injury, that\\u2019s because a swing or an understudy has stepped in, sometimes with just a few minutes to get into costume, sometimes in a costume that isn\\u2019t even theirs. At a time of pandemic uncertainty, their contributions have become even more essential.\", \"For those unfamiliar with the terminology: Understudies can fill in for one or more of a play or musical\\u2019s principal characters. They may regularly appear onstage in a smaller role or they may spend most nights backstage, performing only if needed. Swings have no regular role in a show. Instead they cover up to a dozen ensemble parts in a musical, each with its separate vocal and dance track. Swings may also cover a principal character or two. (Some shows also use standbys, who take over principal roles for a number of performances on a predetermined basis.)\", \"In the past week, about half of the shows on Broadway canceled some number of performances. Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the trade association the Broadway League, seemed to blame certain understudies for these cancellations in an interview published Monday in The Hollywood Reporter. \\u201cMy educated guess is the newer shows maybe have understudies that aren\\u2019t as efficient in delivering the role as the lead is,\\u201d she said.\", \"St. Martin quickly apologized, but not before fans and stars had leapt \\u2014 or maybe, grand jet\\u00e9ed \\u2014 to the defense of swings and understudies. \\u201c*My* educated guess is that when employers consistently reject our efforts to negotiate for more swings, understudies and sub stage managers, because the industry model has grown dependent on people working sick/injured, it\\u2019s short sighted and unsafe,\\u201d Kate Shindle, the president of Actors\\u2019 Equity, wrote on Twitter.\", \"In an interview a few hours later she expanded on those comments. \\u201cI hope that Broadway producers will be as proactive as possible in making sure that there is adequate coverage,\\u201d Shindle said. \\u201cCovid has changed how that looks.\\u201d Shows that don\\u2019t have enough coverage are forced to cancel.\", \"Hiring practices aren\\u2019t the only conventions worth re-examining. Historically, swings and understudies have not typically received dedicated rehearsal time until after a show\\u2019s opening night. Thursday night, after the fourth preview of \\u201cThe Music Man,\\u201d Hugh Jackman saluted the understudy Kathy Voytko for going on for an absent Sutton Foster, despite never having rehearsed the part of Marian Paroo.\", \"Without their own rehearsal schedule, swings and understudies have had to learn scenes, songs and choreography by observation and osmosis. (And in reverse, as they were often relegated to watching from the house.) If they had to go on in previews, like Voytko did, their castmates knew to \\u201cshove with love,\\u201d nudging them toward their correct positions.\", \"But the pandemic has encouraged a reckoning with the \\u201cshow must go on\\u201d culture. Graham Bowen, a longtime swing for \\u201cThe Book of Mormon,\\u201d described the mood backstage as, \\u201cHey, if you\\u2019re just not feeling great, don\\u2019t come to work. It\\u2019s OK. We got this.\\u201d He referred to nights when only the Playbill-listed cast performs as \\u201cunicorns now.\\u201d (In mid-December, Bowen tested positive for Covid-19 and had to quarantine, so other swings, many of whom he has trained, are performing in his place.)\", \"In response, a few shows are rehearsing understudies earlier, sometimes right alongside the main cast or with the principal director rather than an assistant. \\u201cI told them from the jump, \\u2018We have to all trust each other because there\\u2019s all this intimate work. You can\\u2019t just come in halfway through,\\u2019\\u201d said Robert O\\u2019Hara, the director of \\u201cSlave Play,\\u201d which includes several sex scenes. And there is also a drive to allow some understudies to deliver distinct performances, rather than simply copying the work of listed performers.\", \"Rehearsal makes some aspects of the job easier. But it doesn\\u2019t alleviate the anxiety of not knowing whether you will go on. Or the weirdness of earning a Broadway salary when you may not set foot on a Broadway stage for weeks at a time. Or the feeling that you may be disappointing ticket holders if they see your name printed on a Playbill slip.\", \"Despite her longtime career as a swing for \\u201cThe Phantom of the Opera,\\u201d Janet Saia said she once returned a ticket when she arrived at \\u201cThe Producers\\u201d and found that Nathan Lane was out. \\u201cThat show is all about him!\\u201d she said.\", \"Yet understudies and swings are always hired because they can do the role \\u2014 or the many roles \\u2014 with the virtuosity that Broadway demands.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re the last resort,\\u201d said Reynaldo Piniella, an understudy on \\u201cTrouble in Mind.\\u201d \\u201cBut I do know, watching my understudies rehearse, these people are incredible artists.\\u201d\", \"On Wednesday night, about 10 minutes before curtain, Piniella got his own call. Though he had already booked a last-minute job on a different Broadway show, \\u201cThoughts of a Colored Man,\\u201d he hurried to the \\u201cTrouble in Mind\\u201d theater, stepped into a costume he had never worn and made his entrance. \\u201cI bumped into pretty much every piece of furniture on that stage,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut I was prepared to tell the story.\\u201d\", \"In late November and early December, a few weeks before the current string of cancellations, I interviewed a number of swings and understudies about the rewards, stresses and peculiarities of the job and how Covid-19 has altered waiting in the wings. These are edited excerpts from the conversations.\", \"What makes you take an understudy job?\", \"I\\u2019m an Aries, we thrive on spontaneity. It keeps the job exciting, never really knowing when you have to turn the light switch on. Every time you go on, it feels like it could be the last time. So let me really give it my all, go full in and have a good time.\", \"What was your rehearsal process like?\", \"From the first week, we rehearsed with the main cast, warmed up with them. We were never under any obligation to do exactly what the main cast was doing. We were actually encouraged to create our own characters.\", \"The show ended its run before you went on. How did that feel?\", \"It was really upsetting. It became increasingly possible that I was going to go on at the end of the run. So the anxiety and the tension increased. I was so excited to be a part of the first Broadway play back. I wanted to be able to show my work. I\\u2019m sure every understudy feels that way.\", \"How do you feel about understudying?\", \"I equate it to being the sixth man on a basketball team. You\\u2019re not a starter, but you understand that you play a very vital role. When your number is called, you want to make sure you\\u2019re on your game. My fantasy is that the actor I\\u2019m understudying books some big Marvel movie. This show is my Broadway debut, and I would love to get on that stage at least one time, feel what that\\u2019s like.\", \"How do you keep all of those roles in your body and head?\", \"I physically need to do choreography every single day, I physically need to say words out loud every day so that it\\u2019s a part of my muscles. I will do cross training to make sure I have the stamina to do all of the dance choreography. I increase my voice work so that I am strong enough to sing the songs no matter what. I generally read the script two to three times a week.\", \"If you\\u2019re not on, do you ever relax backstage?\", \"It makes me feel weird if I\\u2019m just chilling out. As I\\u2019m watching the show, I try to say the lines in real time. I\\u2019m trying to go over steps that I want to perfect and really understand. I wait until I get home and I\\u2019m in my Epsom salts bath to relax.\", \"How does it feel to receive that last-minute call?\", \"I have experienced the stage manager coming into a dressing room and saying, \\u201cHey, we need you for the next scene.\\u201d And that scene would be in a matter of minutes. It\\u2019s kind of one of the best parts of it. You have this adrenaline rush. It\\u2019s definitely nerve-racking. But you can ride that and really have a wonderful experience.\", \"What makes a great swing?\", \"As a swing, you have to have the fantastic five. First, you have to be fast, you have to learn things fast, you have to adjust to change fast. Second, you have to be fabulous at what you do. The next one is focused, really, really focused. And flexible. And then the last one is fastidious, you\\u2019ve got to pay attention to all the details and make sure they\\u2019re all in there.\", \"With so many roles to cover, have you ever mixed them up?\", \"There\\u2019s a number in \\u201cPhantom,\\u201d \\u201cDon Juan.\\u201d It has all the people I cover in the ensemble around a table with props. One time I went out there and I had the jug and everything. Two seconds before the curtain goes up, somebody came in and said, \\u201cThat\\u2019s my jug.\\u201d Then I realized, I\\u2019m not this part. Instantly, I had to switch my brain and go into the correct part. You make mistakes, but then you say to yourself, \\u201cI\\u2019m covering eight roles, give me a break.\\u201d\", \"Have you ever felt that you were disappointing an audience?\", \"I covered Kelli O\\u2019Hara in \\u201cNice Work if You Can Get It.\\u201d Her name is above the title, people are excited to come and see Kelli O\\u2019Hara. I understand, because I want to see Kelli! I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ve ever come off feeling, like, \\u201cOh, my God, they hated me.\\u201d But I sometimes think, \\u201cWhy do I do this to myself?\\u201d Because I get so nervous every time. That doesn\\u2019t go away.\", \"Has Covid-19 made you feel differently about the job?\", \"I have an even greater personal sense of pride of showing up to the theater every night, knowing just how important having understudies is, so that nobody is ever put in a position where if they\\u2019re sick, if they\\u2019re injured, if they have a family issue, they ever have to think, I\\u2019m choosing between my well-being and whether or not a show happens that evening. I\\u2019m glad to be part of a production that\\u2019s really sort of living those values right now.\"]","href_hash":"b0da787664d311ec8e4cd76834bd033f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b0da787664d311ec8e4cd76834bd033f"}},
