She elaborated on the findings and stressed the effectiveness of vaccination against COVID-19.\", \"\\\"Previous infection used to protect against Delta, and now with Omicron it doesn't seem to be the case,\\\" she said.\", \"Scientists in South Africa and Botswana discovered the variant last week, with its exact origins currently being studied. The variant has been found in multiple countries, including the United States.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945229/south-africa-testing.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">South African scientists are warning that the Omicron variant could reinfect people who have already battled COVID-19.

The vaccines trigger different layers of immune response, some to fend off infection and others to prevent severe disease if someone does become infected.\", \"Much remains unknown about the new variant, including whether it is more contagious, as some health authorities suspect, whether it makes people more seriously ill, and whether it can thwart the vaccine.\", \"But learning how much protection is provided by prior infection is important, especially in parts of the world where much of the population remains to be vaccinated.\", \"The study suggests \\\"omicron will be able to overcome natural and probably vaccine-induced immunity to a significant degree,\\\" Paul Hunter, a professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said in a written response to the findings.
