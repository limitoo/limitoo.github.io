However, the teacher was able to pick up another position at a different Austin high school after the incident, according to KXAN. It is unclear what initially prompted the classroom performance.\", \"The teacher's performance occurred as Spears continues to grab headlines following her recent dissolution of a controversial conservatorship. Last month, a California judge ruled that Spears's conservatorship would be terminated, allowing the 39-year-old pop icon to be freed from an arrangement that had seen her personal and financial decisions overseen by others for 13 years.\", \"Spears was first placed under the arrangement in 2008 amid concerns about her mental health and ability to manage her own personal and professional responsibilities. In California, the state defines a conservatorship as a legal arrangement wherein \\\"a responsible person or organization\\\" is appointed by a judge to \\\"to care for another adult\\\" when it is determined that adult \\\"cannot care for himself or herself or manage his or her own finances.\\\"\", \"Spears's case received widespread attention from fans and other celebrities for years, with supporters using the slogan #FreeBritney to bring further traction to the issue. The pop singer called the end of her conservatorship \\\"the best day ever,\\\" writing on social media after the decision: \\\"Good God I love my fans so much it's crazy!!!\\\"\", \"Spears has since said that she requires \\\"lots of healing\\\" and is on the \\\"right medication,\\\" amid her newfound freedom.\"]","href_hash":"0813eacf56be11ec89f25fdc6b36123c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0813eacf56be11ec89f25fdc6b36123c"}},
