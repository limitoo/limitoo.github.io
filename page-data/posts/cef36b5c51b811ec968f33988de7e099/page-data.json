Women carrying fake binders to block unwanted advances. Forcible touches, kisses, comments about appearance. Fears of speaking out.\", \"A sweeping review of the workplace culture in Australia\\u2019s Parliament paints a damning picture of widespread sexual harassment, with employees sharing harrowing stories of an alcohol-soaked atmosphere where powerful men blurred lines and crossed boundaries with impunity.\", \"The report, released on Tuesday, was commissioned by the Australian government in March, shortly after a former staffer\\u2019s account of being raped in Parliament House sent shock waves through Australia\\u2019s halls of power. It found that one-third of parliamentary employees \\u2014 40 percent of women \\u2014 had experienced sexual harassment. About 1 percent of the more than 1,700 people who participated in the review said they had been the victim of attempted or actual sexual assault.\", \"In response, Australia\\u2019s sex discrimination commissioner, Kate Jenkins, who conducted the study, proposed a series of measures to address the power imbalances, gender inequality and lack of accountability that she said had made Parliament a hostile workplace for many employees, especially young female staffers.\", \"Prime Minister Scott Morrison called the findings of rampant sexual harassment \\u201cappalling\\u201d and added, \\u201cI wish I found them more surprising.\\u201d He said the government would review the report\\u2019s recommendations \\u2014 including the creation of an independent central complaints body, a code of conduct and alcohol policies \\u2014 but did not commit to accepting them.\", \"The Australian Parliament has long had a reputation as a testosterone-fueled bunker, a place that lagged the rest of society as the country\\u2019s corporations and other institutions made gradual moves toward gender equality. In the past 20 years, Australia has fallen from 15th to 50th in the world for parliamentary gender diversity.\", \"After Brittany Higgins, a former parliamentary staff member, said early this year that she had been raped by a more senior colleague in the defense minister\\u2019s office, thousands of women marched in cities across Australia to demand change.\", \"Women in politics who had never felt they had an outlet to share their experiences have come forward with accounts of the misogyny and sexual assault and harassment they endured: stories of being groped, demeaned, insulted, ignored, interrupted. Several federal female lawmakers have quit in recent years, in part because of the disrespect and abuse.\", \"The new report tried to both put numbers on the breadth of the problems in Australian politics and add, in sometimes painful detail, to the stories that have emerged. Among the comments that participants shared anonymously with investigators:\", \"The report describes a toxic work culture driven by power imbalances between members of Parliament and their staffs. In this pressure-cooker environment, sexual harassment was normalized and offenders acted with impunity because there were few avenues for recourse, the review says.\", \"\\u201cParliament is inherently about power, and that power runs in multiple directions,\\u201d Ms. Jenkins said at a news conference shortly after the review was released. \\u201cWe heard that power imbalances and the misuse of power is one of the primary drivers of bullying, sexual harassment and sexual assault.\\u201d\", \"The \\u201cfly in, fly out\\u201d nature of Parliament \\u2014 most lawmakers and staffers do not live in the nation\\u2019s capital, Canberra, and stay there only during the weeks when it is in session \\u2014 created a sense of isolation, the report said.\", \"One person interviewed for the report likened the culture to high schoolers at camp: \\u201cThere\\u2019s a bunch of naughty schoolboys on a school trip, and they think everyone\\u2019s fair game, and whatever happens in Canberra stays in Canberra, and it\\u2019s a kind of free-for-all.\\u201d\", \"Unable to go home when Parliament was sitting, \\u201cmany people preferred to stay late at work or to drink with their colleagues, heightening the risk of misconduct,\\u201d the review found.\", \"Alcohol was sometimes present during parliamentary business \\u2014 \\u201cmembers of Parliament have gone onto the floor of Parliament to vote under the influence of alcohol,\\u201d one submission to the review said. And at night, drinking was a key feature of networking and socializing events.\", \"A workplace environment characterized by \\u201cintense loyalty, the prioritization of \\u2018optics\\u2019 and, in political offices, intense media scrutiny and public interest,\\u201d discouraged staffers from speaking out. Doing so could be risky, they said.\", \"\\u201cI was sexually harassed multiple times, sexually assaulted, bullied and terrorized,\\u201d one person told the investigators. \\u201cAnd I was told that if I ever sought help or spoke about what happened to me my professional reputation and personal life would be destroyed.\\u201d\", \"Because members of Parliament do not have a direct employer, it is difficult to penalize those who engage in misconduct, the review found. Lawmakers are also responsible for hiring and managing their own staffers and have broad powers to fire them, creating an insecure workplace.\", \"Susan Harris Rimmer, a law professor at Griffith University and a former parliamentary staff member, called the report\\u2019s findings \\u201ca shameful picture but an accurate picture.\\u201d\", \"The review shows that Parliament has \\u201cnot been a safe workplace for women or any minority,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand that there was no recourse; bad behavior was seemingly unable to be regulated.\\u201d\", \"The report\\u2019s recommendations are similar to those put in place in Britain, the United States and Canada in years past, and implemented across Australian workplaces 20 years ago, she said. Calls for basic reforms found in other democratic legislatures, such as a complaint system independent of the major parties, have been ignored for years.\", \"\\u201cThe recommendations are just straight stock practice for a modern workplace, most of them, and it\\u2019s still shocking to me that it\\u2019s taken this level of pain and suffering to come to a place where Parliament catches up to the rest of Australia and the rest of the world,\\u201d she said.\", \"Since going public with her account of being raped inside Parliament, Ms. Higgins has become an advocate for victims of sexual abuse and harassment. The man she accused of raping her, Bruce Lehrmann, 26, is set to stand trial in Canberra. He has pleaded not guilty.\", \"In a statement, Ms. Higgins said of the new report: \\u201cI hope all sides of politics not only commit to but implement these recommendations in full.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"cef36b5c51b811ec968f33988de7e099"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cef36b5c51b811ec968f33988de7e099"}},
