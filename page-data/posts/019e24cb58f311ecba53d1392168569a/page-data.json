At the time, he urged the farmers to go home, but they did not immediately do so, vowing to wait until the laws were formally done away with. Last week, Parliament made that happen, signing off on the repeal without debate.\", \"Despite the unexpected victory for the farmers, serious problems remain with India\\u2019s current agriculture system, which incentivizes farmers to grow too much of the wrong kind of crops. Both sides recognize that something has to be done.\", \"The protesting farmers had other demands, and on Thursday they said Mr. Modi\\u2019s government had agreed, at least in principle, to discuss and resolve the major ones, including a countrywide law guaranteeing minimum prices for crops and withdrawal of tens of thousands of charges filed against protesting farmers.\", \"They were also seeking compensation for the families of people who lost their lives during the difficult conditions of a year of protests, such as from exposure to extreme temperatures, heart attacks and Covid-19.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a complete victory,\\u201d said Ramandeep Singh Mann, an engineer-turned farmers\\u2019 rights activist, wearing a pink turban. Yet he acknowledged that questions remained about whether the government would meet the additional demands, and who would be part of the government committee to discuss the guaranteed minimum prices. \\u201cIn every movement, you don\\u2019t get everything,\\u201d he conceded.\", \"Mr. Mann added that the fight for farmers\\u2019 rights was far from over, though the protest had been called off by farming unions and a majority of those involved would start returning to their villages as of Saturday. Mr. Mann said that some would continue to camp at the site until Jan. 15, when farmer organizations would gather once again to deliberate on the future of the movement. For now, he said, 85 percent of the people would start packing up and leaving.\", \"\\u201cThis is a long struggle, and we are capable of renewing our protest once again if needed,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"019e24cb58f311ecba53d1392168569a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"019e24cb58f311ecba53d1392168569a"}},
