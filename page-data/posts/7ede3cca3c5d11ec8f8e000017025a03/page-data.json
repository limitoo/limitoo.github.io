Ulrich since 2009, is a political rarity: It is the only Republican-held Council seat in Queens. \", \"And after Tuesday, it will stay that way. \", \"The race to succeed Mr. Ulrich had attracted attention from across the political spectrum. In the end, Joann Ariola, a longtime civic leader and the chairwoman of the Queens Republican Party, defeated Felicia Singh, a Democrat and teacher.\", \"It was something of a test of the enduring power of the Republican Party in Queens. While the county has long leaned Democratic, it is still home to roughly 140,000 registered Republicans, the most of any borough.\", \"District 32 sits in southeast Queens, spanning parts of many different neighborhoods around Jamaica Bay, from the western Rockaways up through Howard Beach, and into Ozone Park, Woodhaven and Richmond Hill. While the southern portion includes white conservative strongholds like Breezy Point, the northern end skews Democratic and includes large communities of South Asian and Caribbean immigrants.\", \"In Ozone Park, which lies in the northern part of the district, Rezbana Alam, 36, said on Tuesday she had voted for Ms. Singh. Ms. Alam, a Democrat and full-time parent, said that she believed Ms. Singh could make the neighborhood safer. Her public safety proposals included reallocating funding from the police budget to violence-intervention and mental health programs.\", \"Ms. Singh, who grew up in Ozone Park and has Indo-Caribbean roots, was among several candidates who could have become the first people of South Asian descent elected to the Council. She would also have been the first nonwhite representative of District 32.\", \"Ms. Alam said that Ms. Singh had visited her house while campaigning and seemed \\u201cvery open-minded.\\u201d \", \"But Ms. Ariola\\u2019s tough-on-crime platform resonated with voters who were frustrated with Mayor Bill de Blasio and the national Democratic Party. Ms. Ariola had called the city \\u201ca derailed train\\u201d and strongly criticized bail-reform measures and cuts in police funding.\", \"Eddie Rivera, 66, a retiree who also lives in Ozone Park and is not registered with either party, echoed those concerns, saying Democrats \\u201chave lost their way.\\u201d He called Ms. Ariola\\u2019s platform \\u201ccommon sense.\\u201d\", \"Zamil Ahmed, a 41-year-old server who lives in the neighborhood, is a registered Democrat, but he blamed the party for a rise in gun violence and said that quality of life had declined.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s like the whole city is almost destroyed,\\u201d he said. Ms. Ariola picked up his vote.\"]","href_hash":"7ede3cca3c5d11ec8f8e000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7ede3cca3c5d11ec8f8e000017025a03"}},
