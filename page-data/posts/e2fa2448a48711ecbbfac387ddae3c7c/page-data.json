Quintanilla, Selena's brother, worked on it.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Selena's been gone 26 years now,\\\" he said last week. \\\"It's amazing how fast time flies... What amazes me, and Suzette, my family, A.B., is that 26 years later and the public still remembers Selena. They haven't let go of her. They're waiting for a project like this to come out, and I know it will be well received by the public.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Quintanilla said there's a \\\"unique\\\" element of the album: Recordings of Selena when she was 13 years old were digitally updated to sound as if she was 23 years old \\u2013 the age Selena was before she was killed in 1995. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"My son worked on Selena's voice with the computers and if you listen to it, she sounds on this recordings like she did right before she passed away,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"The only holdup is the artwork that will be paired with the album, according to Quintanilla.
