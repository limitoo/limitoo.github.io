As members of a university\\u2019s theater department, the characters in Hillary Miller\\u2019s new comedy \\u201cPreparedness\\u201d \\u2014 presented by the Bushwick Starr and HERE \\u2014 belong to both constituencies, which means that their shoulders slump under boulder-size chips.\", \"That wariness is warranted, though, as their department is under attack from the university\\u2019s brass, which wants not just to cut their budget, but eliminate the program altogether.\", \"Figurative and literal survival become entangled when an irrepressibly chirpy H.R. representative, Kath (Alison Cimmet), turns up in the department\\u2019s shabby \\u2014 and decidedly not chic \\u2014 conference-slash-break room. If the teachers undergo state-mandated training on how to handle a potential mass shooting, they will have a better chance of surviving both a gunman and the dean\\u2019s delete button.\", \"An assistant professor in the English department at Queens College and the author of books on theater, Miller is fluent in academia\\u2019s quirks and jargon, as well as interdepartmental rivalries \\u2014 don\\u2019t get the theater professors started on their brethren in film and digital tech. She also nails bureaucracies\\u2019 love for acronyms, deployed here in a dizzying alphabet soup that includes MeRP (Mutual Respect Pledge), ACOST (Active Campus Operations Shooter Training) and GOHOHOF (Get Out, Hide Out, Help Out, Fight), as well as references to \\u201cFERPP requests\\u201d and \\u201cFULAP forms.\\u201d\", \"Miller and the director Kristjan Thor neatly sketch certain types that turn up in pretty much every group of educators. Most memorable are the beleaguered chairman, Jeff (Lou Liberatore), doing his darnedest to save his department, and Laurette (the wonderful Nora Cole, master of the haughty side eye), a grande dame prone to statement shawls and imbued with the authority that comes from charisma, experience and lofty ideals about her vocation. \\u201cWe\\u2019re theater artists,\\u201d she says. \\u201cWe create sacred spaces for a living!\\u201d\", \"Just as familiar is the high-strung, humorless Hayd\\u00e9e Garc\\u00eda-Shelton (Tracy Hazas), who seems to have a hard time gelling with her colleagues \\u2014 she casually informs them that she got married over the weekend, as if it were no big deal \\u2014 and shows disdain for musicals and their fans. \\u201cIf you ask these people about my work, they\\u2019ll pretend to care, and then they\\u2019ll go right back to pushing their GoFundMe for bouffant wigs,\\u201d she says. One guess as to who will eventually use pepper spray.\", \"Getting this motley bunch to agree on anything, especially an administrative injunction perceived as an imposition, is akin to herding cats \\u2014 real ones, unlike Cat Blanchett, the department\\u2019s new robotic \\u201cResilience Mascot,\\u201d a gesture meant to help improve the sinking morale.\", \"Ultimately, though, Miller can\\u2019t resolve a central issue: Some of the professors\\u2019 refusal to undergo training is mystifying. It\\u2019s easy to understand resistance to H.R., but a quick training session that both covers a very real concern \\u2014 mass shootings in schools \\u2014 and saves your funding feels like a gimme. And yet they bicker.\", \"Having painted herself into a corner, Miller can\\u2019t figure out how to end the play. So she gives Laurette, who is retiring, the last word in the form of an address to her students. It is a good speech, and a dodge.\"]","href_hash":"2b17d6b4442d11eca900d38de11253be"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2b17d6b4442d11eca900d38de11253be"}},
