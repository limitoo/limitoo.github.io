In the early days, when Facebook was only really used by university students, it simply displayed every post from friends, with the most recent ones first.\", \"Facebook, for its part, believes that users do not actually want that. A recent report by the Washington Post discovered that Facebook has run at least two experiments in recent years, exploring what happens when the algorithmic feed is disabled.\", \"One of those tests, the Post reported, resulted in users logging into Facebook less often, spending less time reading content, and posting less themselves.\", \"\\\"The documents suggest that Facebook's defence of algorithmic rankings stems not only from its business interests, but from a paternalistic conviction, backed by data, that its sophisticated personalisation software knows what users want better than the users themselves,\\\" the Post wrote.\", \"Facebook has added one way to access a chronological feed since March this year, although it is not an option available by default.\", \"On its mobile apps, while scrolling through the news feed, an option for \\\"most recent\\\" will sometimes appear. It only works for that browsing session. The next time the app is opened, it will revert to the algorithmic feed.\", \"- BBC\"]","href_hash":"355f2a364b0411eca23d91a107f3cbf3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"355f2a364b0411eca23d91a107f3cbf3"}},
