I\\u2019m guessing that the current president already does.\", \"Lois LowryFalmouth, Maine\", \"The writer is the author of \\u201cThe Giver.\\u201d\", \"To the Editor:\", \"I enjoyed Adam Hochschild\\u2019s review of \\u201cThe 1619 Project\\u201d (Nov. 21), but was disappointed to see him deploy a critique that is easily debunked. He claims that British abolitionism \\u201cdidn\\u2019t come to life until a decade later\\u201d than the American Revolution.\", \"A quick internet search yields books and scholarly articles by Brycchan Carey (2005) and Rena Vassar (1970) that trace an upwelling of abolitionist sentiment agitating the highest levels of church and state in pre-1776 Britain. William Warburton, the bishop of Gloucester, preached a sermon attacking slavery in 1766, a document that the Quaker abolitionist Anthony Benezet referenced in \\u201cA Caution and Warning to Great Britain\\u201d (1767). Other landmark antislavery texts include Granville Sharp\\u2019s \\u201cA Representation of the Injustice and Dangerous Tendency of Tolerating Slavery\\u201d (1769) and the founding Methodist John Wesley\\u2019s \\u201cThoughts Upon Slavery\\u201d (1774).\", \"\\u201cThe 1619 Project\\u201d\\u2019s claim that \\u201cgrowing calls to abolish the slave trade\\u201d in Britain predated the American Revolution is supported by a great deal of written evidence.\", \"Ronald BriggsNew York\", \"To the Editor:\", \"As a historian of publishing, I appreciated Tina Jordan\\u2019s survey of \\u201ca history of self-improvement, told through advertisements in the Book Review\\u201d (Nov. 28). Those of us who have made careers out of writing, editing, publishing and occasionally reading books will be pleased to learn, perhaps too late in life, that books can be an aid to impressing girls.\", \"As an addendum to Jordan\\u2019s piece, I would note that in the same era in which the Pocket Classical Library and Haldiman-Julius\\u2019s remarkable Little Blue Books came out, the most successful set of self-education books ever published in America appeared: the Harvard Classics, known popularly as \\u201cDr. Eliot\\u2019s five-foot shelf of books,\\u201d edited by Charles W. Eliot, retired president of Harvard, and published in 50 volumes by P. F. Collier & Son beginning in 1910.\", \"Collier specialized in mail-order subscription publishing and owned the popular Collier\\u2019s Magazine, in the pages of which the set was copiously advertised, as it was in other magazines and newspapers, including The New York Times. One of the advertising slogans was \\u201c15 minutes a day,\\u201d the amount of time an upward aspiring working-class reader might invest to achieve the equivalent of a liberal university education.\", \"The hard sell was overseen for a while by Collier\\u2019s assistant sales manager Bruce Barton, who went on to found the pioneering advertising firm of Batten, Barton, Durstine and Osborn. The ad campaign was followed up by a nationwide network of traveling salesmen who visited potential buyers, signed them to a contract, collected the money and delivered the product.\", \"The set sold in massive numbers. The New York Times reported in 1926 that \\u201cmore than 14,000,000 copies\\u201d of the individual books \\u201chave been sold. The value of these sales was $20,827,188.\\u201d The fact that possibly several years at \\u201c15 minutes a day\\u201d might be needed to master the 20,000 or so pages of the set seemed irrelevant.\", \"Paul M. Wright Boston\", \"To the Editor:\", \"I have to agree with Pete Warshaw\\u2019s letter in the Nov. 21 Book Review. Three reviews of historical fiction books in that issue summarized each book\\u2019s plot in depth and revealed what looked to me like key plot developments. Now it seems pointless to me to actually read the books.
