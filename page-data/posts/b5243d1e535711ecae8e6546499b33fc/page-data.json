NatWest, a lender to oil giants, provides a template.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-02T02:08:50.000Z","content":"[\"Advocates descended on the streets of Glasgow last month, pressing banks and other financial institutions at 26th United Nations climate summit to be more responsible stewards of the climate. But a bank based just 50 miles east of the Scottish city is already showing what that might look like.\", \"NatWest, formerly the Royal Bank of Scotland, has made the unlikely transformation from substantial financier of the oil and gas industry to a leader in green finance, whittling down its fossil fuel exposure and pledging to funnel 100 billion pounds, or $133 billion, into sustainable-energy projects in the next four years.\", \"The bank, with headquarters in Edinburgh, could serve as an example of the huge shift necessary for Britain\\u2019s banking and investment sector to become, in the government\\u2019s words, \\u201cthe world\\u2019s first net-zero-aligned financial center.\\u201d\", \"Since Brexit, Britain\\u2019s financial industry has lost some of its luster, as London can no longer be used as a hub for European business. The Treasury, determined to maintain the nation\\u2019s eminence, is exploring other ways to attract investors, including making regulatory changes and backing financial technology companies. But green finance could also be an answer.\", \"NatWest\\u2019s climate-friendly transformation has even earned the cautious praise of some of its protesters.\", \"Johan Frijns, a co-founder of BankTrack, a Dutch organization that pressures banks to give up financing fossil fuel projects, said NatWest could set a new benchmark for how to transform a large bank for a low-carbon economy.\", \"\\u201cWe almost desperately want to see NatWest as a beacon of hope, as a bank that shows it can change,\\u201d Mr. Frijns said. \\u201cAnd it comes from very far. It was proud to be the oil and gas bank.\\u201d\", \"The transition at NatWest has been helped along by its diminished global stature. For a short period before the 2008 financial crisis, it was the largest bank in the world, by assets. But then, facing huge losses as the global credit squeeze hit hard, it was bailed out by the British government and reined in its ambitions. Now, reflecting its smaller, domestic focus, nearly half of its loan book is made up of mortgages.\", \"But over the past decade, NatWest has \\u2014 first slowly, and then quickly \\u2014 become more zealous in its climate-related goals. In 2012, it set aside \\u00a3200 million for businesses to undertake energy-efficiency projects. Over the next few years, it helped finance more renewable-energy projects, including wind farms. In 2017, it reported that it didn\\u2019t directly finance any new coal mining or coal power projects. The year after that, NatWest said it would channel \\u00a310 billion into sustainable and climate financing over the next two years.\", \"But the biggest changes have come under the leadership of Alison Rose, who took over as chief executive in late 2019. Besides changing the bank\\u2019s name and distancing it from its crisis-stained past, Ms. Rose has said she wants to run a \\u201cpurpose-led bank,\\u201d with a focus on \\u201chelping to address the climate challenge.\\u201d\", \"In October, the bank announced that it would channel \\u00a3100 billion into financing for green and sustainable initiatives by the end of 2025. It said it would stop lending and underwriting major oil and gas producers if they hadn\\u2019t set out, by the end of this year, a transition plan aligned with restricting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels (the U.N. Paris agreement goal). The bank has also committed to a \\u201ccomplete phaseout\\u201d of investments touching on coal by the start of 2030, the same year it intends to have halved the carbon emissions from all its financing before getting to net zero in 2050.\", \"The bank\\u2019s transformation isn\\u2019t complete: At the end of September, NatWest\\u2019s exposure to major oil and gas companies, mostly from loans, was \\u00a31 billion, and \\u00a3600 million to companies in which more than 15 percent of the activity relates to coal. But its priorities follow the path laid by the government, which has set a legally binding target for the country to cut carbon emissions by more than three-quarters by 2035 compared with 1990 levels, and reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Lawmakers are working out how to meet these objectives.\", \"Rishi Sunak, who as chancellor of the Exchequer is Britain\\u2019s highest financial officer, has presented a plan that initially asks, and eventually requires, financial institutions, including asset managers and pension funds, and publicly listed companies to publish how they will adapt their activities and investments to help the country meet its net zero targets. These transition plans would come on top of existing requirements to publish financial information about climate risks to their business operations and investments.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a really positive indicator that the U.K. recognizes that it needs to take into account the emissions associated with its financial sector,\\u201d said Alison Kirsch of Rainforest Action Network, the lead author of its annual report on banks\\u2019 financing of fossil fuels. \\u201cIt\\u2019s something that hasn\\u2019t happened in the U.S.\\u201d\", \"But, she added, the transition plans aren\\u2019t mandatory yet, and the British government has said it would let the market decide if the plans were adequate or credible. \\u201cWe haven\\u2019t seen the market be a good judge on many things on climate,\\u201d she said.\", \"There are other ways Britain might struggle to meet its goals. Before the transition plans become mandatory, the government is setting up a task force to determine what a good plan looks like. It isn\\u2019t expected to report back for another year, even though some international groups have already provided guidance on transition plans, delaying mandatory reporting. And the government has explicitly stated that these transition plans are not designed to ban investments in carbon-intensive activities.\", \"\\u201cThe rules are all about disclosure \\u2014 and disclosure is very helpful \\u2014 but it\\u2019s not in and of itself going to solve anything,\\u201d said Chris Stark, the chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change, a watchdog funded by the British government to advise lawmakers on environmental policies.\", \"\\u201cBut I think it is an important first step to then have more action,\\u201d added Mr. Stark, whose group recommended that Britain commit to being a net-zero-aligned financial center.\", \"Britain is one of several countries trying to reach climate goals using financial regulations. But advocates say that to be a leader of this group, which also includes France, more needs to be done.\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re really serious about being a net-zero-aligned financial center, then you\\u2019ve got to move to mandatory reporting really quickly,\\u201d said Bethan Livesey of ShareAction, a British charity. \\u201cAnd you\\u2019ve got to have an accountability mechanism in there.\\u201d\", \"The transition plans also need to show investments in sustainable-energy and green projects, said Chris Dodwell of Impax Asset Management, a former climate negotiator for the British government. Meeting Britain\\u2019s climate goals will require a fivefold increase by 2030 in investments into, for example, electric vehicles and alternatives to gas boilers in houses, according to the Committee on Climate Change.\", \"As the finance industry tries to rewire itself to meet these goals, NatWest\\u2019s reputation as a leader faces an imminent test. It is a month away from the deadline it gave big oil and gas companies to provide a credible transition plan \\u2014 or lose the bank\\u2019s lending and underwriting services. Advocates want to know the threat of walking away is real.\", \"The bank has already told some companies that it can\\u2019t finance them in the future, based on the information they have provided, said James Close, a former director of climate change at the World Bank who joined NatWest this year to help lead its climate change strategy. He said these companies were coming back to the bank to check that the information was right.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a conversation \\u2014 it\\u2019s not a kind of one-off decision,\\u201d Mr. Close said. \\u201cAnd then we\\u2019ll have to evaluate.\\u201d\", \"While NatWest\\u2019s business with oil and gas companies is smaller than some other large British banks, Mr. Frijns of BankTrack doesn\\u2019t intend on lifting the pressure.\", \"\\u201cI promise that if at the end of this year we basically see business as usual for NatWest, then they will be the target of campaigning next year just like any other bank,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"b5243d1e535711ecae8e6546499b33fc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b5243d1e535711ecae8e6546499b33fc"}},
