Here's what you need to know.","country":"au","create_time":"2021-12-03T02:38:10.000Z","content":"[\"Another week, another COVID-19 variant.\", \"This time, it's Omicron,\\u00a0one of 11 strains to have been named by the World Health Organization.\", \"So is it more severe than Delta? How far has it spread? And how on Earth do I pronounce it?\", \"Here's your quick catch-up.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">I haven't been watching the news. When did Omicron first appear?</div>\", \"The alarm was first raised by health authorities in South Africa, when a\\u00a0doctor treating COVID-19 patients in early November realised their symptoms didn't quite fit the profile of the Delta variant.\", \"In recent weeks, the Omicron variant has been linked to a surge in COVID-19 case numbers in the Gauteng province of South Africa.\\u00a0\", \"On December 1, South Africa recorded 8,561 cases, up from the 3,402 reported on November 26.\", \"Omicron has since been detected in more than two dozen countries, including Australia, the United States and most recently Norway, which has reintroduced nationwide restrictions in response to a growing cluster.\", \"\\\"We know that this is now spreading into other countries in the world,\\\" Professor Kelly said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">So is Omicron worse than the Delta variant?</div>\", \"The short answer is, it's too early to say.\", \"The variant is expected to replace Delta as the dominant strain in South Africa, while the European Union's public health agency says\\u00a0Omicron may\\u00a0be responsible for more than half of all COVID infections in Europe within a few months.\", \"But\\u00a0cautioning it is still \\\"very early days\\\", Professor Kelly says\\u00a0there is\\u00a0\\\"no real evidence at the moment\\\" the variant is more severe.\", \"\\\"They are seeing a rise in hospitalisations there [in South Africa],\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Is Omicron resistant to COVID vaccines?</div>\", \"At the risk of sounding like a broken record,\\u00a0it's just too early to say.\", \"Addressing the efficacy of vaccines against Omicron, Professor Kelly says South Africa's\\u00a0low vaccination rate means\\u00a0\\\"that is probably not where we will get that information from\\\".\", \"\\\"We remain very actively engaged with the rest of the world \\u2026 we have had meetings with the European CDC and, [in] the last 48 hours\\u00a0with Japan, South Korea last week, and others today,\\\" he said.\", \"The World Health Organization notes\\u00a0that \\\"preliminary evidence suggests there may be an increased risk of reinfection with Omicron \\u2026\\u00a0as compared to other variants of concern\\\", but that evidence is limited.\", \"\\\"WHO is working with technical partners to understand the potential impact of this variant on our existing countermeasures, including vaccines,\\\" it said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Is Australia shutting the borders again because of Omicron?</div>\", \"Not exactly.\", \"But the federal government has deferred this week's planned easing of border restrictions for international students and other eligible visa holders until December 15.\", \"The reopening of travel with Japan and the Republic of Korea has also been pushed back to the same date.\", \"The government says that will allow it to gather further information about the Omicron variant and whether it poses a greater threat than the Delta strain.\", \"Furthermore, non-citizens travelling from South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Lesotho, Eswatini, Malawi and Mozambique are not allowed to enter Australia.\", \"\\\"Our approach, from the very day we closed the border\\u00a0with China\\u00a0on the 1 February 2020, has been to follow the medical advice\\u00a0and to take those difficult decisions,\\\" Health Minister Greg Hunt said.\", \"\\\"The \\u00a0medical advice \\u2026\\u00a0was on the balance of risks\\u00a0and on the basis of the precautionary approach, to put a ban on a temporary basis on flights from the southern African nations\\u00a0to ensure that it was only Australians returning home.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Will I\\u00a0need a booster sooner because of Omicron?</div>\", \"The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI)\\u00a0has recommended there be no widespread change to the vaccine booster program in response to the new variant.\", \"However, it has recommended that severely immunocompromised people get a booster shot two months after their second dose.\", \"Professor Kelly says\\u00a0ATAGI has\\u00a0reviewed evidence from around the world about whether it should shorten the time interval.\", \"\\\"There is one difference there, in relation to the immunosuppressed population, where that is seen as a third dose, [the booster] can be given at a minimum of two months after the second dose.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How do I pronounce Omicron?</div>\", \"According to the ABC's editorial adviser Tiger Webb, Omicron is pronounced as \\\"OM-i-kron\\\".\", \"But it'd be remiss not to mention that there's a few different schools of thought.\", \"Merriam-Webster\\u00a0places the emphasis on the first syllable (\\\"OH-muh-kraan\\\"), while David Sider, a professor of classics at New York University, maintains\\u00a0it's pronounced \\\"OH-micron\\\".\", \"So the short answer is\\u00a0say it however you want\\u00a0because there's a pretty good chance we're all saying it incorrectly anyway.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/bfd11b89bf9c0e1ee67b0988ba0bf006\\\"
