But with the uncertainty over the new Omicron variant and how to respond to President Biden\\u2019s release of oil reserves, there is no clear indication which way the oil ministers will go.\", \"Mr. Bronze said that oil officials and, particularly those representing Saudi Arabia, which leads the group, are fearful of what he called \\u201cvolatility on the downside\\u201d \\u2014 the chance that prices could keep sliding after Friday\\u2019s tumble.\", \"Analysts say the oil officials will be mindful of the severe price crashes that occurred in the early months of the pandemic in 2020, when some futures prices fell into negative territory, and in 2014, after Saudi Arabia temporarily walked away from trying to manage the markets.\", \"OPEC Plus this year has helped orchestrate a hefty price rise of more than 50 percent through careful supply management, and its members will not want those gains to slip away.\", \"Mr. Bronze and other analysts say that those worries may lead OPEC Plus to pause for a month or more the program to increase supplies each month. It could even decide to cut production, although that option seems unlikely.\", \"Because it\\u2019s too early to know what impact the Omicron variant may have on the world economy, the easiest move may be to stick with the agreed-upon plan and wait until the group\\u2019s next meeting, in January.\", \"Maintaining the planned increase would probably ease friction with the Biden administration, which orchestrated the release of oil stocks from the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve in conjunction with smaller moves by other large oil consumers.\", \"It would \\u201ckeep the White House content and stave off\\u201d an additional release of reserves, Helima Croft, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said in a note to clients. The Biden administration has signaled that another reserve release is possible if this one does not accomplish its goals.\", \"Coupled with the impact of the new variant, prices are now down about 15 percent since late October, probably accomplishing much of what the White House wanted.\", \"Over time, the strategic reserve releases could be a more worrying development than Omicron for OPEC Plus. Previous coordinated releases have been rare events, in response to disruptions in supply. The last came in 2011 when civil strife in Libya disrupted oil supplies from that country.\", \"This release, though, is, in effect, a protest over what oil-consuming nations perceive as excessively rapid price increases, at least partly because of artificial constraints on supplies by OPEC and its allies.\", \"\\u201cThis is a complaint about prices that are \\u2018regulated\\u2019 by OPEC countries,\\u201d Edward L. Morse, global head of commodities strategy at Citigroup, said in a video message to clients.\", \"What OPEC can do about this development, though, remains to be seen.\", \"Mr. Morse and others say that moves that once seemed unusual may become more commonplace as the world shifts away from dependence on oil to electric vehicles, for instance \\u2014 perhaps with new momentum imparted by the recent climate summit in Glasgow.\", \"While countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates need healthy oil revenues to fund the diversification of their economies away from oil to other forms of energy, high prices also encourage switching away from oil, weakening demand over time.\", \"\\u201cOPEC and the Saudis used to be able to manipulate the market with confidence in oil\\u2019s monopoly grip on transport,\\u201d said Jim Krane, an energy fellow at Rice University\\u2019s Baker Institute. \\u201cNow we\\u2019re seeing substitutes emerging at the margins. Confidence in oil\\u2019s longevity is slipping.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a745702652dc11ec92eaa5b254993841"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a745702652dc11ec92eaa5b254993841"}},
