For the second year, the government has advised those living away from home to stay put, and train and plane travel has been curtailed.\\u00a0Participants in the torch rally will undergo health screens and be carefully monitored, starting from two weeks before the event begins, said Xu Zhijun, deputy head of the organizing committee.\\u00a0Beijing reported its first local omicron infection on Jan. 15, and 11 cases had been confirmed in the capital as of Thursday afternoon, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.\\u00a0Outside of Beijing, several million people remain under lockdown as part of China's \\\"zero-tolerance\\\" approach to dealing with the pandemic that has been credited with preventing outbreaks on the scale of the U.S. and other countries.\\u00a0Numbers of new cases have dropped substantially in recent days amid strict adherence to masking, travel restrictions and school closures, along with a vaccination rate that now tops 85%. Some medical experts worry a lack of exposure to the virus could harm the Chinese population's ability to deal with future waves of infection.\\u00a0The scaled-down torch relay is a far cry from 2008, when Beijing sent the Olympic icon on a global journey ahead of its hosting of that year's Summer Games. The relay drew protesters against China's human rights violations and policies in Tibet, Xinjiang and elsewhere, leading to violent confrontations and the cancellation of some overseas stages.\\u00a0The Winter Games have been beset by similar political controversies, alongside medical considerations.\\u00a0Six weeks ago, the United States, Britain and several allies said they would not send dignitaries to attend the Games as a protest against human rights abuses by the Communist Party regime.\\u00a0Athletes have been threatened by the organizing committee with \\\"certain punishments\\\" for saying or doing anything that would offend their Chinese hosts, while several delegations urged anyone headed to Beijing to take \\\"burner\\\" phones instead of their personal devices because of concerns their personal information could be compromised.\\u00a0The National Hockey League cited uncertainty caused by the pandemic to hold back all of its players from the Olympic tournament.\\u00a0And earlier this week, American broadcaster NBC said it won't be sending announcing teams to China, citing the same virus concerns raised when the network pulled most of its broadcasters from the Tokyo Games.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"f50349967aaf11ecafa8d30f1160b11f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f50349967aaf11ecafa8d30f1160b11f"}},
