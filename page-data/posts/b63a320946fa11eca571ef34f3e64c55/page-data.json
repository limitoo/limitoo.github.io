Some of them have drawn down their KiwiSaver amounts for hardship, and others have used up their KiwiSaver as their deposit to get a house,\\\" she said.\", \"She has also written about the fact New Zealand women typically save less for retirement than men.\", \"\\\"Many women have time out of the workforce, particularly in the vital years between 20 and 40 rearing the next generation, and in that time they may not be making any contributions at all to their KiwiSaver.\", \"\\\"They don't get the benefit of the employer contribution.

Therefore the level of accommodation-related expenditure is relatively low.\", \"\\\"Whereas if you go into retirement in rental accommodation you're going to have a higher level expenditure, and you're going to have to save more to cover that.\\\"\", \"Matthews suggested using the Sorted website or talking to a retirement advisor to make a savings plan.\", \"\\\"Retirement represents a substantial life change for most. The financial aspect of retirement is one of the most important factors to consider, but there are other aspects to think about, many of which will directly or indirectly impact your financial planning.\", \"\\\"Factors to consider include budgeting, life insurance, health needs, living arrangements, wills, enduring powers of attorney, family trusts and retirement activities.\\\"\", \"Financial Advice chief executive Katrina Shanks welcomed the report and said it was a timely reminder about the need for people to plan for their retirement.\", \"\\\"We need to drill home to people that they must start thinking seriously about saving for their retirement from an early age, or they will struggle to live the lifestyle they want to once they stop work.\", \"\\\"These guidelines clearly show what people need to aim for.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"b63a320946fa11eca571ef34f3e64c55"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b63a320946fa11eca571ef34f3e64c55"}},
