Economic conditions, not the labels others attach to them, will determine where they lead the Fed.\", \"During their tenure at the Fed, Mr. Powell and Dr. Brainard have both shown a firm commitment to job growth. They understand that full recovery requires getting people on the margins back to work and keeping inflation low. As Dr. Brainard said at Monday\\u2019s announcement, she\\u2019s \\u201ccommitted to putting working Americans at the center\\u201d of her work, which includes \\u201cgetting inflation down\\u201d and \\u201csupporting a growing economy that includes everyone.\\u201d\", \"But it won\\u2019t be easy. The Fed has increasingly come under attack from both the right and the left to raise interest rates to fight inflation. And numerous former Fed officials, market analysts and other economists argue that the current low interest rates are putting the economy at risk of persistently high inflation.\", \"It would be a mistake to raise rates now. I do not expect Mr. Powell and Dr. Brainard to make that mistake. That\\u2019s because millions of American unemployed workers are counting on the Fed to do more.\", \"Currently, there are over four million fewer jobs than before Covid and 6 percent inflation. That hardship affects some more than others. Eight percent of Black workers are unemployed. That\\u2019s twice the rate of white workers. Low-income families, who typically spend over 80 percent of their budget on necessities like food, transportation, housing and health care, are especially feeling the squeeze from higher prices at the grocery store and the gas pump.\", \"This year, Mr. Powell has repeatedly defended the Fed\\u2019s view that inflation will ratchet down as the pandemic recedes. If that\\u2019s the case, then the Fed\\u2019s approach to keeping rates low will give workers more opportunities to find jobs.\", \"But what if the Fed is wrong about how high inflation will be next year just as it was this year? What if people who left their jobs during the crisis don\\u2019t all want to come back to work? Today, the Fed has no way of bringing down the high price of food and gas other than cutting demand through higher interest rates.\", \"But Mr. Powell and Dr. Brainard are ready for this moment. Among the six members of the Fed\\u2019s Board of Governors, who now oversee the nation\\u2019s financial system and monetary policy, they are the only two who were there in 2015, when the Fed first raised interest rates after the Great Recession. They both voted in favor of that increase and subsequent ones.\", \"Later, however, both said that the Fed had been too aggressive, needlessly slowing the recovery. In 2019, Dr. Brainard admitted that it \\u201cwould have been a better alternative to delay liftoff.\\u201d Likewise, Mr. Powell testified before Congress that the Fed had \\u201clearned that the economy can sustain much lower unemployment than we originally thought without troubling levels of inflation.\\u201d\", \"To avoid slowing the next recovery, the Fed conducted an intensive review starting in 2019 of its policy approach and tools, including a listening tour with people across the country. Mr. Powell publicly unveiled a new policy framework in the summer of 2020. Under that new plan, the Fed decided that unlike in the past, it would tolerate periods of inflation somewhat above its longstanding target of 2 percent to address the employment shortfall and to achieve a goal of \\u201cbroad-based\\u201d and \\u201cinclusive\\u201d employment.\", \"Now that the Fed\\u2019s new framework is being put to the test, it is time to clearly define what it means by broad-based and inclusive employment. So far, the Fed has punted. When asked this month, Mr. Powell said that maximum employment is \\u201cnot directly measurable\\u201d and \\u201cchanges over time due to various factors.\\u201d That is not going to be good enough next year, when the Fed is thinking about raising interest rates.\", \"The Fed must also decide exactly how much inflation it will tolerate to achieve that employment goal. Dr. Brainard, as vice chair, will be a key player in answering those difficult questions.\", \"Of course, they have not always agreed on policy; Senator Elizabeth Warren and other progressives favored Dr. Brainard for chair because she is seen as tougher on banks. Here again, the line between them is less sharp than outsiders think. I watched them work together to save the Community Reinvestment Act, which ensures that banks serve low- and moderate-income families, from attempts by other regulators to weaken it.\", \"Next year will be the big test. It\\u2019s a new Fed \\u2014 one that says it will support all workers \\u2014 but it\\u2019s still the Fed, where fears of inflation have always loomed large. More than ever, sound policymaking at the Fed is not about being dovish or hawkish. It\\u2019s about being grounded in reality.\", \"\\u201cWe have to be humble about what we know about this economy, which is still very Covid affected,\\u201d Mr. Powell said this month. He added: \\u201cThere\\u2019s room for a whole lot of humility here as we try to think about what maximum employment would be.\\u201d\", \"Humility is a trait often in short supply among policymakers and economists. It\\u2019s absolutely essential now.\"]","href_hash":"efdfedb44d6611ecb9d2bbcf1870d102"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"efdfedb44d6611ecb9d2bbcf1870d102"}},
