In it various committees had a 50-50 party split and/or were chaired by opposition MPs. Possibly as a result, the through-put of some committees slowed markedly. The 53rd Parliament has reverted to the norm and its committees are typically (but not universally) governing-party dominated and chaired.\\u00a0\", \"But regardless of that norm, the Regulations Review Committee has a tradition of being led by an MP from the opposition.

Because we are very much a committee of Parliament that is holding the government to account. And I think it\\u2019s really good actually that we\\u2019ve got [governing party] members on there as well who are taking a really robust look at whether powers have been used correctly, and legally \\u2013 probably more-to-the-point.\\u201d \\u2013 Chris Penk\\u00a0\", \"This committee also appears to have a very good spirit (though many committees often do). Chris Penk puts part of this down to the fact they focus not on the policy (which can be divisive), but on the regulatory mechanism.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a really good spirit and vibe I believe\\u2026 because you take the politics out of it, because you\\u2019re looking not at whether something\\u2019s a good idea substantively, but the way that it\\u2019s been done. So in that sense it\\u2019s actually quite an interesting and enjoyable committee to be on.\\u201d \\u2013 Chris Penk\", \"Rachel Brooking agrees. \\u201cIt\\u2019s quite a joyful committee almost. It\\u2019s an uber-geeky committee. We all revel in the wonderful advice we get from the legal counsel in particular. As Chris says, we\\u2019re not making policy decisions, we\\u2019re not criticising government on policy at all. It\\u2019s just that real balance of the executive [and Parliament].\\u201d \\u2013 Rachel Brooking\", \"There\\u2019s another tradition in this committee. Most of its members have a legal background. That is very true of the current committee. All the members from Labour, National and the Greens have legal training. The only non-lawyer on the committee is ACT MP Toni Severin. ACT has no MPs with a legal background to offer the committee.\", \"\\u201cI think in our first meeting the chair did note that perhaps we could start up a law firm after this.\\u201d \\u2013 Rachel Brooking.\", \"Penk, Brooking, Sage, Bishop, Walters and Lewis.
