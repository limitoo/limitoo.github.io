That includes 21 percent who said their lives are \\\"very normal,\\\" along with 53 percent who said their lives are \\\"somewhat normal\\\" when factoring in the impacts of the virus, according to the survey.\", \"However, the optimistic outlook comes as COVID-19 cases are again on the rise across much of the country. New daily cases are now topping more than 90,000, while more than 30 states are seeing sustained upticks in infections, according to The New York Times. In the hardest-hit regions, like the Northeast and Midwest, hospitalizations are also beginning to soar and intensive care units are running out of beds.\", \"The latest survey also found that even though unvaccinated people are at much higher risk of contracting or dying from COVID-19 than their vaccinated counterparts, those who have not received the jab are more likely to say that the virus is no longer disrupting their lives.\", \"In total, 70 percent of unvaccinated Americans describe their lives as normal, with 25 percent saying their lives are \\\"very normal\\\" and 27 percent saying their lives \\\"never stopped\\\" being normal. By contrast, only 19 percent of vaccinated Americans say their lives are now \\\"very normal,\\\" and 8 percent say their lives \\\"never stopped\\\" being normal.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939137/covid-19-pandemic-back-normal.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A majority of Americans believe their lives are back to normal nearly two years into the COVID-19 pandemic.
