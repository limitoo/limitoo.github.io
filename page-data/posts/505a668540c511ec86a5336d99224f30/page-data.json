We've had bears wander through before, but none settling in,\\\" Michael Payne said.\", \"\\\"I didn't know. I don't think he'd been there that long. They are just now starting to settle in during the next couple of weeks for the winter, so I'm sure [the hole] was rather new.\\\"\", \"As winter approaches, bears start preparing by eating and drinking as much as possible in order to put on weight.\", \"They will also make a den, choosing from a range of locations, including in hollow trees or logs, under the roots of trees, in rock crevices, or in high trees in warmer climates.\", \"Bears will stay in these dens over the course of their hibernation, during which their heartbeat and breathing slows down significantly, and their body temperature drops.\", \"After the bear escaped into the hole, the Paynes contacted a Colorado Parks and Wildlife official, Sam Peterson, to help remove it from their property.\", \"Peterson used ammonia for the job, the smell of which is an effective bear deterrent. Eventually, the bear beneath the Paynes' home couldn't stand the smell of the ammonia any longer and scurried out of the den and left the property.\", \"The Paynes told KDVR they were thankful that their uninvited guest left sooner than expected, but said they understand that they are living in bear country and that incidents like these are not unheard of.\", \"\\\"We're encroaching on their habitat, really. We are their guests. These things are going to happen living up here,\\\" Michael Payne said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928138/brown-bear.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Stock image showing a brown bear looking out of its den during winter.
