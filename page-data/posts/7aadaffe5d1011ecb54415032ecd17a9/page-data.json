Ten local teachers had five minutes to collect as many $1 bills out of $5,000 as they could on a carpet placed at center ice. According to Stampede president Jim Olander, each participant walked away with at least $500 that they can use to pay for class projects.\", \"However, video footage of the event quickly went viral--not for its fun way of raising money, but for allegedly humiliating and demeaning teachers. A video of the fundraiser saw participants scrambling on the floor to grab the money while spectators watched and cheered, drawing intense criticism both online and from teachers' groups.\", \"\\\"As a state, we shouldn't be forcing teachers to crawl around on an ice rink to get the money they need to fund their classrooms,\\\" said Loren Paul, who serves as the president of the South Dakota Education Association.\", \"As a response to the backlash, the Stampede and CU Mortgage Direct pledged to donate $15,500 directly to local teachers. Along with their current total, the participants will receive an additional $500 and the 21 who were not selected will also receive $500.\", \"Local newspaper The Argus Leader also published a list on how to donate to teachers, schools and education funds involved in the event directly.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1951796/sd-dash.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Local teachers scramble for dollar bills to fund projects for their classrooms on December 11, 2021, in the first-ever Dash For Cash between periods at the Sioux Falls Stampede game in Sioux Falls, South Dakota.
