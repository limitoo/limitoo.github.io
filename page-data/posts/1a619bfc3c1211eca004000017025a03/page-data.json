Growing up, I would sneak butterscotches and strawberry sweets. During the pandemic, my grandmother moved into assisted living. On my first visit after lockdown, I saw how much of her 90-year life she had discarded to fit into her new residence. Yet, she\\u2019d saved the familiar bowl. Driving home, I discovered that she\\u2019d slipped its candy into my purse. Years before, when I had confessed my childhood thievery, she laughed. \\u201cWhy do you think I kept it on that low table? It\\u2019s always been for you.\\u201d \\u2014 Samantha Facciolo\", \"My daughter was 2 when she was fitted for her first wheelchair. I cried because I feared the wheelchair meant a lifetime of dependence and frustration. When it arrived, I grimaced at its pink metal frame. But not my daughter! Her face lit up. Even then, its wheels whispered to her of freedom, of wings and wind and the sun on her face. Now, at 10, my daughter speeds down the road, squealing with delight. I love her wheelchair; it is a part of who my girl is. \\u2014 Aimee Christian\", \"It\\u2019s no coincidence that your name means \\u201cbeautiful wait\\u201d in Siswati. The past year and a half of your existence has been a lesson in waiting: waiting for you to be born, waiting as you grow and as I become more patient \\u2014 all during the pandemic. I\\u2019ve always rushed. But with you, I can be a new person, as if I too were recently born, soft from the universe\\u2019s molding with breath fresh in my lungs. To you, the most mundane activity is a wonder. Watching you discover your tiny world nourishes something I had long forgotten: possibility. \\u2014 Zanta Nkumane\", \"I was 8 when my older brother and I climbed the wooden stairs to our treehouse, careful to avoid the places that gave splinters. He sat across from me, cheeks flushed, and asked, \\u201cWhat number am I thinking of?\\u201d \\u201cEight.\\u201d I said. \\u201cHow did you know?\\u201d he said, incredulous. \\u201cI know you,\\u201d I said. More than a decade later, his eyes are the same, but his cheeks are sharper. I sit on his couch, anxious after coming out as bisexual. \\u201cYou will be OK,\\u201d he tells me. \\u201cHow do you know?\\u201d I ask. \\u201cI know you,\\u201d he says, smiling. \\u2014 Lucia Bailey\"]","href_hash":"1a619bfc3c1211eca004000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1a619bfc3c1211eca004000017025a03"}},
