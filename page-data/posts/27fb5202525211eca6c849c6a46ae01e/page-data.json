He died just over a month later, likely from a pill laced with fentanyl from an unknown source.\\u00a0\", \"Macintosh turned to his social media for answers. Looking through her son's Snapchat, she said she saw bags of pills and mushrooms. \\\"I felt really helpless like there's really nothing I can do when I saw how prevalent it was, how many people were in his feed,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"The drug trade is booming on social media, according to Kathleen Miles, who works for the Center on Illicit Networks and Transnational Organized Crime. \\\"I think social media can be great, but it also has a really dark side of it,\\\" Miles said.\\u00a0\", \"With fentanyl in high circulation, the risks are often deadly. The U.S. recorded more than 100,000 drug overdose deaths in a 12-month period for the first time, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

We also use third-party detection tools to scan other platforms where drug dealers may be trying to contact Snapchatters. We work with law enforcement and partner with parent groups, safety organizations, and experts who inform all of these practices, and we constantly evaluate where we can keep strengthening our work to combat this illegal activity.\\\" - Snapchat spokesperson\", \"\\\"We don't allow the sale of illicit drugs on Instagram.
