Musicals often get off to a slow start, even more so when they are released in mid-December. Fueled by positive word of mouth and awards attention, they can turn into little engines that could. Golden Globe nominations will be announced on Monday.\", \"\\u201cThe Greatest Showman,\\u201d for instance, collected $8.8 million over its first three days in domestic theaters in December 2017 and was insta-written off as a box office embarrassment. Then the soundtrack caught fire among young women. \\u201cThe Greatest Showman,\\u201d which cost $84 million to make, finished its six-month run in theaters with $437 million in worldwide ticket sales.\", \"In a results email on Sunday, Disney, which released \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d on its 20th Century Studios label, noted that ticket buyers gave the film an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls. Indicators of audience sentiment \\u201call bode well for the long run ahead through the upcoming holiday season,\\u201d the company said.\", \"In release in 37 international markets, including in some countries where the Omicron variant has prompted governments to tighten safeguards, \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d took in $4.4 million. The film\\u2019s global total so far, $14.9 million, missed Disney\\u2019s prerelease hope of $25 million by roughly 40 percent.\", \"\\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d based on the 1957 Broadway musical, cost an estimated $100 million to remake, not including tens of millions of dollars in marketing costs. Tony Kushner adapted the screenplay.\", \"In the United States and Canada, turnout for \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d was largest among ticket buyers over the age of 55. About 82 percent of the national audience came before 8 p.m., according to EntTelligence, a film research firm.\", \"\\u201cThis is a story about an interracial romance,\\u201d David A. Gross, who runs the film consultancy Franchise Entertainment Research, said in an email on Sunday. \\u201cOnce upon a time, that was rare and remarkable. Not any more. For moviegoers, context may have caught up with this film, however well-made it is.\\u201d (The filmmaking team and many critics would counter that \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d also tackles social issues, notably intolerance, that are as timely as ever. Reviewing the film for The New York Times, A.O. Scott said Spielberg\\u2019s take on the material \\u201creaffirms its indelible appeal while making it feel bold, surprising and new.\\u201d)\", \"Among A-list filmmakers, Spielberg is one of the last streaming holdouts. Although his company, Amblin, signed a multiyear deal in June to make feature films for Netflix, Spielberg has pushed for his directorial projects to remain theatrical exclusives. At the New York City premiere of \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d he thanked Disney executives for giving his film an old-fashioned theatrical rollout, despite the pandemic, rather than rerouting it to a streaming service, as the company had notably done with \\u201cHamilton.\\u201d (On Thursday, Disney removed a Ben Affleck thriller, \\u201cDeep Water,\\u201d from its January theatrical release schedule; the movie is expected to stream on Amazon Prime or Hulu instead.)\", \"So it was distressing for Hollywood traditionalists to see \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d arrive to even lower ticket sales than \\u201cIn the Heights.\\u201d That euphorically reviewed Warner Bros. musical took in $11.5 million over its first three days in theaters in June \\u2014 even though it was simultaneously available to stream at no extra cost on HBO Max. Box office analysts used words like \\u201cfizzled\\u201d and \\u201cdismal\\u201d to describe opening-weekend ticket sales for \\u201cIn the Heights.\\u201d\", \"Live-action musicals have long been a challenged genre at the box office.

The successful \\u201cLes Mis\\u00e9rables (2012) had Jackman, Russell Crowe, Anne Hathaway and Helena Bonham Carter.
