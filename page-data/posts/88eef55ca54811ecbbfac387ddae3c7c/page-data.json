This is a really practical thing that we can do to make it easy for families if their child, when they're sent home, goes home with a rapid antigen test for the family, just to make it easier,\\\" she said.\", \"In Wellington, about 86 percent of schools had children or teachers away with Covid-19.\", \"Te Kura Kaupapa M\\u0101ori o Ng\\u0101 Mokopuna tumuaki Rawiri Wright said providing tests was a good move.\", \"He said the country's 66 kura kaupapa M\\u0101ori recently persuaded the government to provide tests which they had been sharing with wh\\u0101nau for a week already.\", \"Wright said it helped his kura contain the spread of Covid-19.\", \"\\\"Just by closing in the first instance and being able to have those RATs to encourage wh\\u0101nau to test helped each wh\\u0101nau to better manage their own isolation and their awareness,\\\" he said.\", \"In Auckland, Papatoetoe High School principal and Secondary Principals Association president Vaughan Couillault said he had no problem with his school acting as a distribution centre for tests for its families.\", \"\\\"We've already started doing that with the RATs that we have been able to get hold of. If we know that the family's got vehicular access issues, rather than making them go to a testing site, we've actually just been throwing three or four at them because it just makes sense, it's the right thing to do morally,\\\" he said.\", \"Couillault said the tests were welcome, but he still wanted the government to make it easier for teachers to leave isolation with sick family members if they tested negative for Covid-19.\", \"Under the critical worker exemption scheme, isolating teachers who tested negative could return to work only if there was nobody else available to supervise children who could not stay home.\", \"\\\"I've currently got in excess of 20 teachers sitting at home at the moment. About nine or 10 of those have tested positive, certainly understand that but there's 10 of them that are sitting at home just in case.

It will absolutely help services and parents to manage how they keep their services open, how children can attend the services, and just keep everybody safe,\\\" she said.\", \"Principals Federation president Cherie Taylor-Patel said the tests would help schools.\", \"\\\"The best use of them is to bring down anxiety levels and for people to know that they are testing negative before they make a decision about whether or not they're going to go to work or go into a school situation where you might have at-risk students or at-risk staff,\\\" she said.\"]","href_hash":"88eef55ca54811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"88eef55ca54811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
