The unions recently joined a lawsuit filed by Brnovich to nullify the vaccine mandate after Phoenix's city manager required all employees to be vaccinated by Jan. 18 in order to obey the mandate, The Associated Press reported.\", \"Phoenix officials cited the city's federal contracts which would require it to adhere to Biden's policy. There is also a rule from the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) currently paused by a federal appeals court that would mandate employers with over 100 workers to regularly test unvaccinated workers.\", \"Brnovich calls the mandate an abuse of Biden's power.\", \"Bryan Willingham, a Phoenix firefighter and executive vice president of the United Phoenix Firefighters Association, said the vaccine mandate will cause people to leave their jobs, overworking the firefighters left.\", \"\\\"The community cannot lose these individuals.
