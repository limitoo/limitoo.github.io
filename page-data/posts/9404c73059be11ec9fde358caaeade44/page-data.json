The state\\u2019s water board could impose the penalties as soon as next month, when they come up for a vote.\", \"You may be wondering: What about mandating shorter showers? Fewer toilet flushes? Using the dishwasher only when it\\u2019s full?\", \"There\\u2019s actually good reason those measures aren\\u2019t atop the water-saving list. While in-home conservation doesn\\u2019t hurt, a majority of California\\u2019s residential water \\u2014 as much as 80 percent of it \\u2014 is used outdoors.\", \"Take this example: When California was slammed with an atmospheric storm in late October, many of us skipped watering our lawns. After months of water savings of no more than 5 percent compared with last year, Californians\\u2019 water usage in October dropped to 13.2 percent below the rate in October 2020, according to new state data. While still short of Gov. Gavin Newsom\\u2019s 15 percent target, it\\u2019s the closest we\\u2019ve come.\", \"\\u201cThis jump in water savings we saw across the state can illustrate just how much water can be conserved when we\\u2019re not irrigating outdoors, even for just part of the month,\\u201d said Charlotte Ely, who presented the savings data to the State Water Resources Control Board this week.\", \"Half of California\\u2019s annual water usage is considered environmental water, meaning it flows through protected rivers or supports wetlands in wildland preserves, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. The other 50 percent is for human use \\u2014 40 percent for agriculture and 10 percent for urban use, split between indoor (drinking water, showers) and outdoor (lawns, washing our cars).\", \"But the relatively warm, dry weather in California tips the scales toward outdoor consumption. Plants quickly evaporate water, so keeping them green is more water-intensive than in other parts of the nation, said Jay Lund, co-director of the Center for Watershed Sciences at the University of California, Davis.\", \"\\u201cOur per capita water use rates are much, much, much higher than they are back east, where they have rainfall in the summertime,\\u201d Lund told me.\", \"While the average Californian uses roughly 110 gallons of water a day, a person in Massachusetts, for example, consumes on average around 65.\", \"And it\\u2019s not because heat makes us drink more water. Every day, the average human consumes one gallon, maybe two, Lund told me. So at most, that\\u2019s 2 percent of our total water usage.\", \"Lund pointed to the water-saving success of Healdsburg, a town in Sonoma County that was facing a severe shortage this year. In June, officials banned residents from watering their lawns and yards.\", \"Since then, the city\\u2019s water usage has fallen by 50 percent.\", \"For more:\", \"The bizarre story behind the \\u201cBirds Aren\\u2019t Real\\u201d billboards in Los Angeles.\", \"Glazed holiday ham \\u2014 with a secret ingredient.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from Peter Lautz, a reader who lives in Chula Vista.
