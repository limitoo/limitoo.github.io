According to a statement released by the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police, the fire department was called to the scene where it found one person dead in the struck car.\", \"Ruggs, the police said, remained on the scene and \\u201cshowed signs of impairment,\\u201d adding in the statement that Ruggs would be charged with driving under the influence resulting in death. No charges have been filed yet, according to the Clark County (Nev.) District Attorney\\u2019s office. If convicted of the charge, a felony, Ruggs, 22, faces 2 to 20 years in prison.\", \"He was transported to University Medical Center in Las Vegas, where police said he was treated for injuries that were not life-threatening.\", \"Ruggs\\u2019s lawyers, David Z. Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld, said in a statement that they were conducting their own investigation and asked for judgment to be reserved \\u201cuntil all the facts are gathered.\\u201d\", \"The Raiders, in a statement, said that they were \\u201cdevastated by the loss of life and our thoughts and prayers go out to the victim\\u2019s family.\\u201d\", \"For the Raiders, Ruggs\\u2019s involvement in the crash is the latest in an unusually tumultuous stretch for the organization. The team announced over the summer that several high-ranking executives \\u2014 among them Marc Badain, the team\\u2019s longtime president, and Ed Villanueva, the chief financial officer \\u2014 had resigned. Mark Davis, the team\\u2019s owner, acknowledged last week that they had departed because the Raiders had overpaid taxes for years and the team may not be able to recoup them.\", \"Then, in October, Coach Jon Gruden resigned after The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal published stories detailing emails he sent over a 10-year period in which Gruden used sexist, racist and misogynist language.\", \"Even as turmoil has engulfed the organization, the Raiders, at 5-2, have gotten off to their best start since 2016. They have won both games under interim head coach Rich Bisaccia and are in first place in the rugged A.F.C. West.\"]","href_hash":"799b45de3c1a11ecbd3c000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"799b45de3c1a11ecbd3c000017025a03"}},
