The order announced by Denver Mayor Michael Hancock mirrors similar orders announced by counties that cover Denver's suburbs recently.\", \"Colorado Governor Jared Polis said at a news conference Tuesday that a statewide mask mandate is not currently under consideration, but he supports city and county health departments making the decisions to enact the mandates. Polis said it was the responsibility of local health departments to \\\"function within the social license of the area that they represent.\\\"\", \"Polis cited the state's vaccination rate as a reason he isn't currently considering a mask mandate, as the state has 81 percent of eligible adults vaccinated, with 92 percent of residents over 65 fully vaccinated.\", \"\\\"Hospitals are filling up by those of you who have chosen not to get vaccinated,\\\" Polis said.\", \"Hancock referenced hospitalizations in his announcement of the mandate, saying it was necessary to attempt to ease the pressure currently being felt by local hospitals. Denver Health, the city's public hospital, has repeatedly sent patients to other hospitals because of how overwhelmed their emergency room staff is dealing with COVID cases.\", \"Denver's Executive Director of the Department of Public Health and Environment Bob McDonald largely placed the blame on unvaccinated citizens for the need of the mandate, citing that 83 percent of the region's hospitalized COVID patients are unvaccinated.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939165/michael-hancock-denver-covid-mask-mandate.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Denver Mayor Michael Hancock announced a new mask mandate in Denver will go into effect Wednesday, citing a rise in COVID cases.
