In Aysegul Savas\\u2019s novel \\u201cWhite on White,\\u201d the narrator, an unnamed graduate student, moves to a European city to study the cathedrals in neighboring towns and plumb the medieval imagination. The narrator is researching depictions of Gothic nudes, an unusual topic, we\\u2019re told; the figures that decorate cathedrals and illuminate manuscripts are usually clothed, their garments rich with symbolism. But the lack of existing study is a draw. \\u201cI wanted to research an ambiguous topic,\\u201d the narrator says, \\u201cwhose greatest challenge would be one of consciousness: to view the naked human form as medievals did.\\u201d\", \"Through this academic interest, Savas sets up the novel\\u2019s key theme: the knotty business of imaginative sympathy, of discovering how other perspectives might intersect with \\u2014 and come to influence \\u2014 our own. \\u201cThere was no clear course of study for entering another\\u2019s consciousness, historical or not,\\u201d the narrator muses. \\u201cThis was as difficult a task as undoing one\\u2019s own mind, unraveling each layer of thought with all its prejudices and assumptions.\\u201d\", \"The narrator finds lodging in an apartment owned by Pascal, a medieval studies professor, and Agnes, a painter, who live in a town some hours away. In contrast to the ambiguity of the narrator, whose appearance and gender are not mentioned in the text, Agnes is sharply defined: \\u201ctall and pleasingly thin,\\u201d \\u201cdressed in a crisp white shirt, opening up into an elegant ruffle on one side of her waist.\\u201d Her tenant is initially enamored with the charming, creative, put-together woman she appears to be, and soon, the two are cohabitating. Instead of joining her husband at their usual home, Agnes decides to stay in the apartment, where she also keeps a painting studio. There, she frequently engages the narrator in exchanges about art that turn into increasingly one-sided monologues detailing Agnes\\u2019s personal history.\", \"Savas\\u2019s novel \\u2014 her second, after \\u201cWalking on the Ceiling\\u201d \\u2014 suggests that art reflects the spirit, that even without our knowledge, changes in the way we express ourselves mirror the condition of our souls. Agnes dismisses an early series, depictions of masks stiffly rendered with \\u201cformal restraint,\\u201d as an attempt to be painterly before she trusted her own taste, but finds drawings from her college years to be \\u201chonest and alive, entirely different from her controlled paintings.\\u201d The titular white-on-white painting arrives midway through the novel, revealing the artist on a precipice: shapes carved out by minute differences in hue and texture, a faint image with an aura of incompletion, appearing in \\u201cfree fall.\\u201d Art is everywhere in this book. The name Agnes evokes the filmmaker Varda or the painter Martin, her work recalling the white paintings of Rauschenberg or Ryman. But no artists are named, and Savas refrains from making overt references.\", \"In fact, the entire world of \\u201cWhite on White\\u201d is selectively outlined. What of it exists exists in crisp, clean prose. Like the narrator, the city is deliberately unnamed \\u2014 it may be Paris, it may not. The geographic ambiguity floats the narrative out of place, and, in a similar fashion, scenes that might have physical presence \\u2014 as when Agnes talks to the narrator while stretching a canvas with a staple gun \\u2014 feel curiously bodiless, stripped down. But this intangibility merely points us to the real site of the novel: the deeply psychological conversations with Agnes. Savas sets all other characters\\u2019 speech in quotations, but the narrator\\u2019s dialogue remains unquoted. Meanwhile, the line between Agnes\\u2019s monologues, as reported by the narrator, and the narrator\\u2019s own speech and thoughts grows increasingly thin.\", \"Over time, the narrator is drawn into Agnes\\u2019s mental world, in all of its turmoil, yet, with a strange coolness, resists providing the compassion and reassurance Agnes seems to so desperately seek. The results of this thwarted intimacy move the story inexorably toward a finale that, for a book so invested in visual art, feels surprisingly most like an act of literary revenge.\"]","href_hash":"34ab5554571d11ec99cf8b348dbb16c1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"34ab5554571d11ec99cf8b348dbb16c1"}},
