The first is that we want to be seen to be supporting the industry's efforts to recycle its waste.\", \"\\\"The second is that Plasback is accredited by the government and it has developed an efficient model for doing this,\\\" Currie said.\", \"Plasback's Neal Shaw said everyone in the farm plastics supply chain, from manufacturers through to consumers, will soon be responsible for recycling leftover plastic products and packaging - so farmers should get on board now.\", \"\\\"There is plenty of talk in the industry about supporting product stewardship, but it is time for all suppliers to back up that talk with action and join a scheme,\\\" he said.\", \"Shaw said local councils need to toughen up their rules around farmers burying or burning their plastic waste.\", \"\\\"A lot of the district councils have not really addressed the issue fully, saying people cannot burn or bury waste product on the farm anymore.\", \"\\\"Some of the the councils allow it, but say that the plastic needs to be burned at a temperature of 1000 degrees.\", \"\\\"I'm not sure there's many farmers that stand there and monitor the temperature of the plastic when they're burning it. It needs to be practical.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"0ac10334bc5711ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0ac10334bc5711ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
