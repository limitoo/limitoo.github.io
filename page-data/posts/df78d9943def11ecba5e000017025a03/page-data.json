War heightens the already helpless state of childhood. It removes the last vestiges of predictability and sense, offering randomness and brute violence instead \\u2014 bombs that may crash through a ceiling at any moment.\", \"The Ukrainian artists Romana Romanyshyn and Andriy Lesiv understand this. It\\u2019s why \\u2014 though they\\u2019ve lived through a revolution in 2013, the Crimea annexation in 2014 and the ongoing conflict in eastern Ukraine \\u2014 there is no explanation for the catastrophes that overtake a fictional town in their picture book, \\u201cHow War Changed Rondo.\\u201d War is \\u201cWar,\\u201d a monstrous dark cloud that sprouts fists, reducing everything it touches to \\u201cnothingness.\\u201d It is sudden in its appearance and unrelenting in its destructiveness, like anger itself.\", \"Romanyshyn and Lesiv deploy a charming combination of drawing and collage, pasting in diagrams from botany textbooks and old newspapers. There is a fragility to the arrangement, which looks scattered on the page, and a fragility to their three main characters: Danko, made from a strand of light; Fabian, a fuchsia balloon dog; and Zirka, an origami bird. The trio love their idyllic town and its most famous feature: flowers that sing.\", \"War obliterates all, seeding a thicket that blots out the sun. \\u201cWithout light, the delicate and defenseless flowers of Rondo started to weaken and fade, sapped of the strength they needed to raise their faces to the sky. Saddest of all, they stopped singing.\\u201d\", \"The book\\u2019s pages, shaded soft green and mustard yellow at first, turn the color of bruises, obsidian black and purplish gray. Danko, Fabian and Zirka dodge cutout bombs and tanks.\", \"Light must then defeat the dark. It\\u2019s a fairly tired metaphor, but Romanyshyn and Lesiv grab onto it. How else to avoid the nothingness? The three friends, a little cracked and burned, rally the town to build a \\u201clight machine.\\u201d Metallic gears and screws roll onto the page. Soon yellow beams are puncturing the shadowy form of War, until \\u201cevery black flower had disappeared and the darkness had dissolved completely. VICTORY!\\u201d Rondo returns, but its famous multicolored flowers have been replaced by red poppies.\", \"A note informs us of a fact that might be common knowledge to a European child: The red poppy, since the onset of World War I, has come to commemorate those fallen in war. That this final visual punctuation mark needs explaining goes to what might make this book difficult for some children. It speaks so precisely to the perspective of a young person who has experienced the confusion of war that the indiscriminate brutality might feel abrupt and inexplicable to one who hasn\\u2019t. What is this dark force? Why has it arrived? Why has it landed on us?\", \"If the book prompts these questions, maybe that\\u2019s OK. After all, Romanyshyn and Lesiv give their plucky characters a happy ending and more control over reality than a war would grant. The power of light over darkness and the return of singing flowers, illusory or comforting, are fantasies a terrorized boy or girl \\u2014 or really any of us \\u2014 surely needs to cling to.\"]","href_hash":"df78d9943def11ecba5e000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"df78d9943def11ecba5e000017025a03"}},
