The two states are reporting several thousand new COVID infections every day, including some cases of the Omicron variant.\", \"New York's move was announced on December 10 and came into effect three days later, while California's mandate came into effect on December 15.\", \"The number of daily COVID cases in the U.S. has been on the rise in December, from a seven-day rolling average of 86,530 on the 1st to 121,573 on the 7th, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
