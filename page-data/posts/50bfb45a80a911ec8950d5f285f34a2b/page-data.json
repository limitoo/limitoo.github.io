Now a widow, she struggled before a packed St. Patrick's Cathedral as she recalled a quarrel they'd had the morning of the shooting.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"You asked me if, 'You are sure that you don't want me to take you home, it might be the last ride I give you.' I said, 'No,' and that was probably the biggest mistake I ever made,\\\" Luzuriaga said in her eulogy.\\u00a0\", \"Rivera, a 22-year-old rookie, was gunned down a week ago after a domestic disturbance call that also took the life of his partner, 27-year-old Wilbert Mora.\\u00a0\", \"Luzuriaga recalled the moment she'd learned about the shooting.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"My heart dropped,\\\" she said. \\\"I immediately texted you and asked you, 'Are you OK?
