Although voting in person takes place on the day, postal voting has already begun. Some 60.4 million Germans over the age of 18 are eligible to vote.\", \"The Bundestag is made up of at least 598 seats, and usually more.\", \"Although the winning party becomes clear on the night, the make-up of the next government is only known once the winner is able to form an absolute majority in parliament with one or two other parties. So the next chancellor will not be known immediately.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How is the chancellor selected?</div>\", \"Typically the coalition party with the most seats picks the chancellor.

There are 299 constituencies - roughly one MP for every 250,000 people. The candidate who wins the most votes in each constituency is guaranteed a seat. This winner-takes-all system is known as first-past-the-post voting, similar to the election for the UK parliament.\", \"The second vote is based on a different system - proportional representation. The remaining 299 seats are allocated based on each party's share of the vote - and they are assigned to candidates on ranked lists drawn up by each party.\", \"This is the Bundestag's own explanation of the vote.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Why is the second vote decisive?</div>\", \"First, a party has to win at least 5% of the second vote to enter the Bundestag. This threshold was designed to prevent small, often radical, parties from gaining power.\", \"Then, according to Germany's mixed electoral system, the make-up of parliament must reflect the result of this second vote.\", \"The second vote therefore determines the percentage of seats each party will get in the Bundestag and its chances of forming a government.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">So why does the Bundestag's size vary?</div>\", \"This is the tricky part. The number of seats in parliament can increase if there are imbalances between each party's results in the two votes. So the outgoing Bundestag doesn't have 598 seats it has 709, and experts believe it could now go above 800.\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17B00/production/_120242079_gettyimages-140076783-594x594.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">German Chancellor Angela Merkel speaks in the Bundestag</div>\", \"Consider this hypothetical example:\", \"The CDU wins 110 seats in the constituency vote and 100 seats in the party vote. In this scenario, the CDU would have 10 more seats than it should, according to its share of the all-important second vote. Sometimes voters back a particular candidate and then choose a different party.\", \"So, the CDU gets to keep the extra 10 seats, which are known as \\\"overhang mandates\\\".\", \"However, the CDU now has 10 more seats than it should have, an unfair advantage.\", \"To level the playing field, all other parties are assigned so-called balancing seats. This increases the number of representatives for all other parties on a percentage basis.\", \"In this example, their seats would increase by 10% of their election results to correct the imbalance.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">When will we know the result? </div>\", \"The winners and losers should be clear within hours of the vote closing.\", \"That was the case in the last Bundestag vote in 2017, when Angela Merkel delivered a sombre speech to mark her party's underwhelming results.\", \"But talks on forming a government can take weeks, as in 2017, when there was a failed attempt to form a Jamaica coalition with the CDU (black), Greens and FDP (yellow).\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/1FCD/production/_105914180_line976-nc.png' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">line</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">More on Angela Merkel's legacy:</div>\"]","href_hash":"c740dacc05fd11ec96a9020017029e60"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c740dacc05fd11ec96a9020017029e60"}},
