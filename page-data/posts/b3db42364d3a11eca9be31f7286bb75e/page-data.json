Users can locate their county and plug-in details about the event they are considering going to, including the number of people in attendance.\", \"The resulting calculated risk level, which is presented from zero percent to 100 percent, is the estimated chance that at least one individual infected with COVID-19 will be present.\", \"\\\"You can reduce the risk that one case becomes many by wearing a mask, distancing, and gathering outdoors in smaller groups,\\\" the dashboard reads. \\\"For vaccinated individuals, preventative steps can reduce the risk of breakthrough infections that spread to vulnerable individuals. For unvaccinated individuals, preventative steps before vaccination can reduce the risk of breakthrough disease, including potentially severe cases, hospitalizations, and fatalities.\\\"\", \"The tool comes as vaccinated Americans have been given the OK by health experts to gather for Thanksgiving. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said on Sunday that inoculated individuals should enjoy the holiday season with friends and family.\", \"\\\"Obviously, if you're not vaccinated, you're in a situation where you're more vulnerable to getting infected,\\\" Fauci said during an appearance on CNN's State of the Union. \\\"But for the people who are vaccinated, the people who can get boosted, enjoy your holiday season with your family, indoors, grandparents, children.
