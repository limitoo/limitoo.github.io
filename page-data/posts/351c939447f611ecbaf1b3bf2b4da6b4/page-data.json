Users will be able to purchase the parts and tools needed for repairs directly from the company.\", \"The program is launching in the U.S. first and will expand to other countries throughout the upcoming year, Apple said.\", \"\\\"Creating greater access to Apple genuine parts gives our customers even more choice if a repair is needed,\\\" said Jeff Williams, Apple's chief operating officer, in the announcement. \\\"In the past three years, Apple has nearly doubled the number of service locations with access to Apple genuine parts, tools, and training, and now we're providing an option for those who wish to complete their own repairs.\\\"\", \"Right to repair advocates have criticized Apple in the past for its tight control over its hardware and software \\u2014 down to creating proprietary screws  for the iPhone a decade ago, making it impossible for consumers to open their devices.
