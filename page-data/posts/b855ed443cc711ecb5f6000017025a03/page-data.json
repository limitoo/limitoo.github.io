Sheâ€™s finally getting her chance.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-03T09:02:03.000Z","content":"[\"AUSTIN, Texas \\u2014 \\u201cI didn\\u2019t know I was half Dominican until I got older,\\u201d the comedian Aida Rodriguez said from the stage at the Stateside Theater. \\u201cThey broke it to me like it was bad news.\\u201d\", \"The crowd laughed, but Ms. Rodriguez was serious. This is a subject close to her heart. The range of Latino identities in America often falls under the broad category of \\u201cHispanic,\\u201d a box to check on a census chart that blurs the richness of the many cultures it encompasses. In a country where a handful of famous Latino comics come mostly from the Southwest, Ms. Rodriguez wants to bring a Caribbean perspective to the forefront.\", \"When she was 3 years old, her mother left her father and moved them to Miami from Santo Domingo, the Dominican capital. She grew up with her Puerto Rican side of the family, thinking she was only Puerto Rican. It wasn\\u2019t until this year, when she met her father for the first time since then, that she reconnected with Dominican culture.\", \"She now uses comedy to process the parts of her life over which she didn\\u2019t have any control.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to see things that are a part of you that you don\\u2019t remember that well,\\u201d said Ms. Rodriguez, from the greenroom before her set at the Moontower Comedy Festival on Sept. 22. Earlier this year, she filmed a one-hour comedy special, which premieres on HBO Max on Nov. 4. In the show, she uses material that touches on her upbringing and her hardships. She looks at it all unflinchingly. In fact, she even had cameras rolling when she met her father, capturing parts of their reunion to weave into the hourlong video.\", \"The pieces are starting to fall into place for Ms. Rodriguez\\u2019s comedy career, but when she first started she was a single mother of two, and stand-up was more of an outlet than a path she thought she would take.\", \"\\u201cI couldn\\u2019t afford a therapist,\\u201d she said.\", \"In 1998, she left her husband, a former football player for the Chargers, and moved from San Diego back to Miami. \\u201cI went home for two years to recover,\\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t fit into that world.\\u201d\", \"At the same time, she was working on a script that she submitted to the Sundance Screenwriters Lab, a workshop where new screenwriters are paired with seasoned writers who help them finish their manuscripts. When she was accepted into the program, she saw it as an affirmative sign to pursue her acting career, so, in 2000, she moved to Los Angeles. She took a job at a financial firm in between acting jobs and was signed by a talent agency.\", \"\\u201cI was signed pretty quickly,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt was part of the illusion that I was going to make it.\\u201d\", \"The trickle of acting jobs she had been booking soon dried up. In 2007, she started appearing on \\u201cSpeedy\\u2019s Comedy Corner,\\u201d a radio show on Jamie Foxx\\u2019s Sirius XM radio channel, The Foxxhole. The staff of the show put together a comedy show at the Orpheum Theater in Phoenix and invited Ms. Rodriguez to be part of the lineup.\", \"It was her first time onstage, and she was a hit. The audience roared throughout her five-minute set. She was hooked on that feeling, but it would be a long time before she\\u2019d be able recapture it. Back in Los Angeles, she managed to get a three-minute \\u201cFirst Impressions\\u201d spot on a \\u201cChocolate Sundaes\\u201d show at the Laugh Factory.\", \"\\u201cI bombed,\\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said. \\u201cI did well for the first few minutes, but then I got cocky.\\u201d\", \"She then booked another five-minute set, this time on \\u201cComic View: One Mic Stand,\\u201d a BET show hosted by Kevin Hart. But she wasn\\u2019t ready. \\u201cFive minutes when you\\u2019re bombing, feels like three hours,\\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said. \\u201cI realized it was too early for me and I needed to focus on the craft.\\u201d\", \"She began showing up for open mic nights at the Westwood Brewing Company in Los Angeles. Soon after, she started hosting a weekly comedy show at the Hollywood Studio Bar and Grill. After two years there, she picked up another hosting gig at a comedy club in San Diego for three years.\", \"In 2010, she was opening for Paul Mooney at the Punchline, a comedy club in Sacramento. By 2013, she was no longer opening at the Punchline; she was now the headliner.\", \"Her big break came in 2014, when she auditioned for Season 8 of \\u201cLast Comic Standing,\\u201d a reality competition show on NBC whose executive producers included Wanda Sykes. Other comedians warned Ms. Rodriguez about the snare of reality shows, but she felt it was her best shot at success.\", \"\\u201cIt was a reality show, but as a Latina it was the only chance I had,\\u201d Ms. Rodriguez, 44, said. \\u201cI had to be very careful that I didn\\u2019t perpetuate stereotypes. It was heavy.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sykes advised her to let go of her inhibitions. \\u201cIt just takes a while to feel comfortable with who you are,\\u201d Ms. Sykes said in an interview. \\u201cI think the journey is difficult, but once you get there and you can do it, it is so liberating and cathartic and just raw and beautiful.\\u201d\", \"Although Ms. Rodriguez didn\\u2019t win the competition, she said it helped her find her voice, and she began booking mainstream comedy clubs across the country. She performed at colleges, went on a 10-day military tour in Korea, and landed a role in \\u201cThe Comedian,\\u201d a 2016 film about an aging comic starring Robert De Niro.\", \"Everything seemed to be falling in place, but Ms. Rodriguez still felt like an impostor, she said. She often felt like she was cheating, like she could be found out at any moment.\", \"\\u201cI just thought, I keep getting away with it,\\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said. Still feeling like she had something to prove \\u2014 at least to herself \\u2014 she went to New York.\", \"As the saying goes, \\u201cYou go on the road to get good, you go to New York to get great, then you go to L.A. to get famous,\\u201d she said. The New York comedy scene helped her feel validated. Ms. Rodriguez is now a regular at the Comedy Cellar. \\u201cI go every month to do stand-up because that\\u2019s where you get the respect,\\u201d she said.\", \"Her satire is awash with the themes of race, religion, millennial wokeness and motherhood.\", \"\\u201cPeople were throwing up Black Lives Matter signs during the marches,\\u201d she says during her special. \\u201cAnd they only put those signs up so nobody will break their windows.\\u201d\", \"Onstage, Ms. Rodriguez finally gets to enjoy the spotlight and she wants to use it to inform and use humor to bring her identity to light, she said. \\u201cI want to create more space for other people.\\u201d As she puts it in her special: \\u201cWe have this ethnic spectrum that contains all the races \\u2014 we have white, Black, Asian, Indigenous, we have everybody.\\u201d\", \"With her newfound fame came a broader reach and higher expectations. In 2018, she was criticized for suggesting that Louis C.K., who had been accused of sexual misconduct by five women, use his routine to educate other men.\", \"\\u201cIf he uses the opportunity to address his shortcomings, maybe he can change a few minds among his fans and maybe he can save a couple of girls from unnecessary and unwanted incidents,\\u201d Ms. Rodriguez told The Hollywood Reporter.\", \"\\u201cThey called me a rape apologist,\\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said, while in the greenroom of the Stateside Theater in Austin, minutes away from performing her first hour of stand-up since the start of the pandemic. \\u201cBecause I said when he comes back, he should use his privilege and his platform to speak to the people who think like him because I can never reach those people.\\u201d\", \"In 2019, Ms. Rodriguez was one of six comedians chosen by Tiffany Haddish to be part of her Netflix anthology series, \\u201cTiffany Haddish Presents: They Ready.\\u201d Every episode is a 30-minute special from a different comedian. Once again, Ms. Rodriguez made headlines. This time, for jokes that were considered homophobic.\", \"\\u201cIf you want to have a conversation with me and say, This is problematic? Let\\u2019s talk about it,\\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said. \\u201cYou want to blast me on social media and try to take me down knowing that I\\u2019m at the bottom? I get paid the least out of everybody in comedy. Latinas are getting paid less than everybody, comedy is not exempt from it.\\u201d\", \"Now, Ms. Rodriguez mentors other Latina comedians, in hope that they can avoid becoming caught in industry traps.\", \"\\u201cShe probably is looking out for me in ways that I don\\u2019t even know,\\u201d said Glory Mora, 33, a comedian in New York who produced a show Ms. Rodriguez headlined, called \\u201cMorir So\\u00f1ando,\\u201d after a popular Dominican drink. \\u201cWhen she did our show, she gave us props and she didn\\u2019t even have to do that.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Rodriguez is also starring in and writing a half-hour comedy show based on her life, which is in development at HBO Max. Ms. Haddish has signed on as an executive producer. \\u201cI just want to show my people in an honest light,\\u201d Ms. Rodriguez said. \\u201cI want to be true to us.\\u201d\", \"It was call time and she headed to the stage. In a camo jacket, gray jeans and a bright pair Jordans designed by the rapper J. Balvin, she got to the microphone and opened up with a Karen joke.\", \"Several people got up and exited the theater.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s OK,\\u201d she reassured the rest of her audience. \\u201cPaul Mooney told me that if 10 people don\\u2019t leave while you\\u2019re onstage, you\\u2019re doing it wrong.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b855ed443cc711ecb5f6000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b855ed443cc711ecb5f6000017025a03"}},
