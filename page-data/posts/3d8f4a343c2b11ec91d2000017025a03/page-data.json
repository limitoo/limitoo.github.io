Filmmakers have likewise mined this moment for terrifying inspiration. Last summer Shudder released \\u201cHost,\\u201d a collaborative horror film made entirely over Zoom. Now \\u201cIsolation,\\u201d a collection of nine short horror films set all over the globe, offers stories of survival created under the limitations of quarantine. Though there are a few standout creations, the anthology is mostly muddled, privileging a heightened version of 2020 over a reality that was plenty scary on its own.\", \"In \\u201cIsolation,\\u201d each short is set in a specific city in a world upended by a mutating virus. Economies are crashing and food supply chains have halted, resulting in mass civil unrest. \\u201cPacific Northwest,\\u201d directed by Bobby Roe, follows two children as they outrun murderous escaped convicts who have been inexplicably freed from a nearby facility. This hovering between real-world horror and tacked-on scares results in more confusion than it does poetry.\", \"For instance \\u201cThe Dread,\\u201d directed by Dennie Gordon, artfully depicts a woman\\u2019s anxiety as her husband slowly dies in their bed \\u2014 but the film ends with gunshots and explosions as unknown vigilantes ransack the Hollywood Hills. Two films about conspiracy theorists, \\u201c5G\\u201d and \\u201cIt\\u2019s Inside,\\u201d only compound confusion. Without consistent information about this slightly different world, it\\u2019s impossible to tell if these characters are totally unhinged or if their paranoia is justified.\", \"The gimmick of this collection is its main draw. Seeing what the filmmakers have pulled off at the height of quarantine, with only at-hand resources at their disposal, is fascinating. Drone footage abounds; family members and friends play starring roles. Some films are meditative, while others go full-on slasher. But the bizarre 2020 that \\u201cIsolation\\u201d presents \\u2014 exactly like ours, except when it\\u2019s not \\u2014 is ultimately a hobbling distraction.\"]","href_hash":"3d8f4a343c2b11ec91d2000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3d8f4a343c2b11ec91d2000017025a03"}},
