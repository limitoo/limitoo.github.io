And if the former president interferes with primaries and tries to help nominate folks that are unelectable in swing districts and purple states, that's gonna hurt,\\\" he cautioned.\", \"However, Hogan noted that this is a \\\"constant problem.\\\" He pointed out that he easily won reelection in Maryland in 2018 as a Republican governor despite Trump losing there in 2016 and again in 2020 by a wide margin. \\\"So it is possible,\\\" he asserted.\", \"\\\"The Democrats have been trying to make it all about Trump and I think that's a mistake.\\\"\", \"Hogan also admitted that despite his sentiments, Trump is \\\"likely not going away.\\\"\", \"Polls consistently show that Trump remains widely popular with most Republican voters. But Hogan and other moderates are concerned about the sentiments of independents and moderate GOP voters who have been turned off by the former president's divisive style of politics.\", \"Hogan has been highly critical of Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was \\\"rigged\\\" in favor of President Joe Biden.

And there's no whitewashing,\\\" Hogan said in a July appearance on CBS News' The Takeout podcast. \\\"We need to get all the facts and find out exactly what happened. But there's no way to just overlook this and say it didn't happen. The nonsense about 'these were just peaceful tourists' is completely absurd.\\\"\", \"During his interview with CNN on Sunday, Hogan urged fellow Republicans to move on from the 2020 election.\", \"\\\"We gotta look to '22 and '24 and we've gotta have a message that appeals to more people,\\\" he said. \\\"It's not about the former president.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"42da9d3e3fe811ecaaa10f67130f53eb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"42da9d3e3fe811ecaaa10f67130f53eb"}},
