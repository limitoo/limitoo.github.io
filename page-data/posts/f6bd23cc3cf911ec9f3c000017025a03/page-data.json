But several justices seemed open to allowing the state to exclude guns from crowded public settings or other sensitive places.\", \"The Second Amendment protects a constitutional right just as the First Amendment does, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said. People seeking to exercise either of those rights, he said, should not have to demonstrate to the government that they have a good reason or special need to do so.\", \"\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to say, when you\\u2019re looking for a permit to speak on a street corner or whatever, that, you know, your speech is particularly important,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo why do you have to show in this case, convince somebody, that you\\u2019re entitled to exercise your Second Amendment right?\\u201d\", \"At the same time, the chief justice was among the justices who asked whether guns could be barred at settings as varied as subways, protests, Yankee Stadium, Times Square on New Year\\u2019s Eve and college campuses in New York City.\", \"The hearing \\u201cprovided a road map for New York to follow,\\u201d said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, and the author of \\u201cGunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe justices appeared convinced that restrictions on guns in sensitive places were constitutionally permissible, with Times Square and the subway as potential illustrations,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPerhaps we will see New York loosen its permitting requirements but strengthening the restrictions on sensitive places to make it very difficult for carry in New York City.\\u201d\", \"Paul D. Clement, a lawyer for the plaintiffs in the case, including two men who were denied licenses to carry handguns at all times, gave cautious answers to questions about restrictions on guns in sensitive places, saying those issues were not part of the dispute before the justices and should be resolved in future cases.\", \"In general, though, and without defining what counts as \\u201csensitive,\\u201d he said that \\u201cNew York is entitled to have laws that say that you can\\u2019t have weapons in sensitive places.\\u201d\", \"The main point, Mr. Clement said, was that \\u201ccarrying a firearm outside the home is a fundamental constitutional right,\\u201d one allowed with few restrictions in 43 states. Those states, he said, included major cities like Phoenix, Houston and Chicago.\", \"Justice Elena Kagan responded that \\u201cmost people think that Chicago is, like, the world\\u2019s worst city with respect to gun violence.\\u201d\", \"Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said the court should limit its ruling to what he called \\u201cthe permitting regime.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t have to answer all the sensitive places questions in this case, some of which will be challenging no doubt,\\u201d he said.\", \"Barbara D. Underwood, New York\\u2019s solicitor general, told the court that limits on guns in sensitive places would not be a complete solution.\", \"\\u201cYou end up having a very big difficulty in specifying what all the places are that have the characteristics that should make them sensitive,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt has an attractive quality to it, but in implementation, I think it would be unsuccessful.\\u201d\", \"But Ms. Underwood\\u2019s defense of New York\\u2019s licensing system did not seem to satisfy a majority of the justices.\", \"She said that \\u201cunrestricted permits are more readily available in less populated areas,\\u201d setting off a discussion of where it is most valuable to have a gun for self-defense.\", \"\\u201cIf the purpose of the Second Amendment is to allow people to protect themselves,\\u201d Chief Justice Roberts said, \\u201cthat\\u2019s implicated when you\\u2019re in a high-crime area. It\\u2019s not implicated when you\\u2019re out in the woods.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Underwood said it made sense to allow guns where there is little law enforcement presence. The chief justice asked, \\u201cHow many muggings take place in the forest?\\u201d\", \"Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. asked whether people who work late in Manhattan \\u2014 \\u201cit might be somebody who cleans offices, it might be a doorman at an apartment, it might be a nurse or an orderly, it might be somebody who washes dishes\\u201d \\u2014 would be granted a license if they said they had a dangerous commute through a high-crime area.\", \"\\u201cThey do not get licenses, is that right?\\u201d Justice Alito asked.\", \"Ms. Underwood said that was generally correct. \\u201cThe core right to self-defense,\\u201d she said, \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t allow for all to be armed for all possible confrontations in all places.\\u201d\", \"There was much discussion of history, including repeated references to the Statute of Northampton of 1328, which appeared to forbid carrying arms to fairs and markets and is cited by some proponents of gun regulation as evidence that the founders did not intend the Second Amendment to preclude limits on the public carrying of firearms.\", \"Mr. Clement said that statute was not understood to be \\u201ca general prohibition on carrying outside the home but was a prohibition on either carrying unusual and dangerous weapons or using common weapons in a way that terrorized the public.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Underwood said the statute and the long history of regulating guns where people gather, including in the American colonies and in states at the time of the founding, supported New York\\u2019s law.\", \"But several justices said the historical evidence was contested. Justice Stephen G. Breyer added that judges were ill-suited to the task of doing authentic historical research, calling what they do \\u201claw office history.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis is a wonderful case for showing both sides,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo I\\u2019m not sure how to deal with the history.\\u201d\", \"Justice Kavanaugh said the solution was to start with the text of the Second Amendment, which speaks of a right to keep and bear arms, suggesting that bearing arms happens outside the home.\", \"\\u201cThere will be tough questions, as the arguments revealed, about what the historical practice shows, but the default or baseline is the text,\\u201d he said.\", \"The question of how the Second Amendment applies to carrying guns in public is an open one. When the Supreme Court established an individual right to own guns in 2008 by a 5-to-4 vote in District of Columbia v. Heller, it addressed only the right to keep firearms in the home for self-defense.\", \"At the same time, it indicated that many kinds of gun regulations are permissible.\", \"\\u201cNothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms,\\u201d Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in 2016, wrote for the majority.\", \"The question the justices agreed to decide in Wednesday\\u2019s case, New York State Rifle & Pistol Association v. Bruen, No. 20-843, was \\u201cwhether the state\\u2019s denial of petitioners\\u2019 applications for concealed-carry licenses for self-defense violated the Second Amendment.\\u201d\", \"But the issue of restricting guns in sensitive places got a lot of attention at Wednesday\\u2019s argument. Chief Justice Roberts asked Mr. Clement, for instance, whether states could say \\u201cyou\\u2019re not allowed to carry on a university campus.\\u201d\", \"He said, \\u201cI think the answer to your question is yes.\\u201d\", \"Justice Kagan seemed to think that was an important concession. \\u201cYou know, anybody can walk around the N.Y.U. campus,\\u201d she said, referring to New York University\\u2019s many buildings in and around Greenwich Village.\", \"Mr. Clement responded, to laughter, that \\u201cN.Y.U. doesn\\u2019t have much of a campus.\\u201d\", \"Justice Kagan disagreed, as did Justice Breyer. \\u201cTo my mind,\\u201d he said, to more laughter, \\u201cI think NY.U. does have a campus.\\u201d\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett asked about the masses of people who sometimes gather in Manhattan.\", \"\\u201cCan\\u2019t we just say Times Square on New Year\\u2019s Eve is a sensitive place because now we\\u2019ve seen, you know, people are on top of each other?\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve had experience with violence, so we\\u2019re making a judgment, it\\u2019s a sensitive place.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Underwood said that Times Square is, at least in the absence of a pandemic, always crowded. \\u201cWhen commerce is in full swing,\\u201d she said, \\u201cTimes Square almost every night is shoulder-to-shoulder people.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f6bd23cc3cf911ec9f3c000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f6bd23cc3cf911ec9f3c000017025a03"}},
