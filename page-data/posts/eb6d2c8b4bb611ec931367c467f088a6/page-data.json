When the men saw Mr. Arbery running through the neighborhood on a Sunday afternoon in February 2020, their lawyers have argued, their goal was to stop him. \", \"Robert G. Rubin, representing Travis McMichael, cited the citizen\\u2019s arrest law in his opening statement, focusing on property crimes, which he said had left the neighborhood \\u201con edge.\\u201d He said that Mr. Arbery had been spotted four times via security cameras in a half-built house and that Mr. McMichael had confronted a man emerging from that house on the fourth occasion and felt threatened when the man appeared to reach toward his waist, as if for a weapon. \", \"It was the same house from which Mr. Arbery was seen running on the day he was fatally shot, Mr. Rubin said, giving Mr. McMichael probable cause to assume that a burglary had occurred \\u2014 and reason to suspect that Mr. Arbery might be armed \\u2014 thus giving Mr. McMichael the right to make a citizen\\u2019s arrest.\", \"The law in question had existed in Georgia since 1863. It allowed residents to arrest each other if they had reasonable suspicion that someone had committed a felony and the police were not present.\", \"In this case, the jury will have to consider whether the men reasonably suspected that Mr. Arbery had committed a felony. \", \"These kinds of laws, similar to \\u201cstand your ground\\u201d and \\u201ccastle doctrine\\u201d laws that allow people to use force to protect themselves or their homes, exist in man states but are not uniform. Critics argue that they enable people to act out of pre-existing biases and help foment environments that can lead to extrajudicial killings.\", \"\\u201cThis is based on racism,\\u201d said Ira P. Robbins, a law professor at American University who wrote a paper on the issue. \\u201cYou look at the Georgia law, for example. This is a law that was used for white people to help catch escaping slaves. There is a close connection between citizen\\u2019s arrest laws in the South and lynchings.\\u201d\", \"Another criticism of these kinds of laws is that ordinary citizens are not well-versed in the complexities of the law when they take matters into their own hands. \\u201cIt\\u2019s scary because it allows for vigilante injustice,\\u201d Mr. Robbins said.\", \"Georgia lawmakers dismantled the citizen\\u2019s arrest law last spring in response to Mr. Arbery\\u2019s killing, repealing the portion that allowed a private person to arrest someone if that person witnessed \\u2014 or was told about \\u2014 a crime, or if someone suspected of committing a felony was trying to escape. The legislation carved out some exceptions for business owners, who can detain people on \\u201creasonable grounds\\u201d if they are suspected of shoplifting or other thefts. Other exceptions apply to licensed private detectives and security guards.\", \"Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, called the former statute \\u201can antiquated law that is ripe for abuse.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"eb6d2c8b4bb611ec931367c467f088a6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eb6d2c8b4bb611ec931367c467f088a6"}},
