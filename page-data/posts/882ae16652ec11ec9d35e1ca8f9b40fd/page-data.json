The two were separated by fewer than 60,000 votes, and Abrams initially refused to concede amid allegations of widespread voter suppression. Kemp, then the secretary of state and in charge of overseeing elections, denied the accusation.\", \"In her first campaign video, Abrams said Wednesday she's running for governor \\\"because opportunity in our state shouldn't be determined by ZIP code, background or access to power.\\\"\", \"\\\"If our Georgia is going to move to its next and greatest chapter, we are going to need leadership,\\\" Abrams said. \\\"Leadership that knows how to do the job. Leadership that doesn't take credit without also taking responsibility. Leadership that understands the true pain folks are feeling and has real plans.\\\"\", \"Kemp kicked off his reelection campaign this past summer with a rally at the Georgia National Fairgrounds and an advertisement bashing Abrams and \\\"the liberal mob,\\\" even though she hadn't entered the race yet.\", \"Since the last gubernatorial race, Abrams has become one of the nation's leading voting rights activists. She helped Georgia turn blue during the 2020 presidential election, as Joe Biden was the first Democrat to win the Peach State in nearly three decades.\", \"The state also flipped both of its U.S. Senate seats in a 2021 special election that resulted in victories for Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. The two representatives gave Democrats narrow majority control of the evenly divided chamber.\", \"This is a developing story and will be updated with more information as it becomes available.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943491/stacey-abrams-wants-2022-gubernatorial-rematch.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Voting rights activist Stacey Abrams has announced she will run for governor of Georgia in 2022, setting up a rematch with Republican incumbent Brian Kemp.
