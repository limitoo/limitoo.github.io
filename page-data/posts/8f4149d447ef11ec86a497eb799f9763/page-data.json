However they are possible if the duty lawyer's expanded scope of responsibilities avoids equivalent legal aid costs,\\\" the documents said.\", \"The legal groups consulted on the design of the scheme said it would be better to provide a more substantial increase in general rates for duty lawyers but justice ministry officials said there was no money to do so.\"]","href_hash":"8f4149d447ef11ec86a497eb799f9763"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8f4149d447ef11ec86a497eb799f9763"}},
