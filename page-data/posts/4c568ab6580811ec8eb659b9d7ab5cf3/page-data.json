Four of them purchased the Megaplier, doubling their third prize to $20,000.\", \"There were 229 players who matched four of the five white balls, but not the Mega Ball, each earning $500, with 45 of them each earning the Megaplier prize of $1,000.\", \"A group of 672 people matched three white balls, each winning $200, with 135 of them each winning the Megaplier prize of $400.\", \"The next Mega Millions drawing will be on Friday, December 10, at 11 p.m. ET, for a jackpot prize of $135 million, with a cash-value option of $98.5 million.\", \"Last Friday's drawing, for which the Megaplier was 5x, also saw no grand prize winner.
