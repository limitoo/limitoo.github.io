He claimed in August that he was \\\"immunized\\\" against the virus.\", \"During a Friday appearance on The Pat McAfee Show, he defended his decision to not get vaccinated, saying he did \\\"a lot of study\\\" during the off-season and that he was allergic to an ingredient in the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. He said he was hesitant to get the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\", \"He said he did research to petition the NFL to avoid being placed on its list of unvaccinated players. He also said he spoke to podcaster Joe Rogan and has been taking ivermectin to manage his illness. However, ivermectin is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat the virus.\", \"Since his comments, the number of State Farm advertisements featuring the football star have declined.\", \"Apex Marketing Group found that only 1.5 percent of State Farm advertisements featured Rodgers on Sunday, down significantly from 25 percent one week earlier on October 31, according to the Action Network, a sports news organization.\", \"A State Farm spokesperson, in a statement to USA Today, described Rodgers as a \\\"great ambassador\\\" for the company, but said it does not support some of the statements he has made.\", \"\\\"We don't support some of the statements that he has made, but we respect his right to have his own personal point of view. We recognize our customers, employees, agents and brand ambassadors come from all walks of life, with differing viewpoints on many issues. Our mission at State Farm is to support safer, stronger communities. To that end, we encourage vaccinations, but respect everyone's right to make a choice based on their personal circumstances,\\\" the spokesperson wrote.\", \"Still, other companies have done more to distance themselves from Rodgers.\", \"Prevea Health wrote in a statement that their partnership with Rodgers would end on Saturday, noting they are \\\"deeply committed to to protecting its patients, staff, providers and communities amidst the COVID-19 pandemic.\\\"\", \"\\\"This includes encouraging and helping all eligible populations to become vaccinated against COVID-19 to prevent the virus from significantly impacting lives and livelihoods,\\\" the statement reads.\", \"The football star continues to face mounting backlash for his comments.\", \"Terry Bradshaw, a pro football Hall of Fame quarterback, said Rodgers \\\"lied to everyone\\\" about his vaccine status.\", \"\\\"I'll give Aaron Rodgers some advice. It would have been nice if he had just come to the Naval Academy and learned how to be honest [and] learned not to lie,\\\" Bradshaw said on Fox NFL Sunday. \\\"Because that's what you did, Aaron. You lied to everyone.\\\"\", \"Howard Stern said he would \\\"throw this guy out of the football league so fast\\\" during his show on Monday.\", \"\\\"This f****** guy\\u2014I don't watch football, sorry. I'm not a big fan. I know the guy's a real good football player\\u2014that's why they put up with his bulls***,\\\" he said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928504/aaron-rodgers.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">State Farm advertisements featuring embattled football quarterback Aaron Rodgers, above, dropped amid the controversy surrounding his vaccine comments.</div>\"]","href_hash":"6c3e075240dc11ec9ff18b32d561f094"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6c3e075240dc11ec9ff18b32d561f094"}},
