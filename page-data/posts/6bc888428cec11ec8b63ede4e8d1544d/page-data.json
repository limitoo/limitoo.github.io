But it is the expanding emigration of French Muslims that points to a deeper crisis for the country.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-02-13T16:47:25.000Z","content":"[\"PARIS \\u2014 France\\u2019s wounded psyche is the invisible character in every one of Sabri Louatah\\u2019s novels and the hit television series he wrote. He speaks of his \\u201csensual, physical, visceral love\\u201d for the French language and of his attachment to his hometown in southeastern France, bathed in its distinctive light. He closely monitors the campaign for the upcoming presidential elections.\", \"But Mr. Louatah does all of that from Philadelphia, the city that he began considering home after the 2015 attacks in France by Islamist extremists, which killed scores of people and deeply traumatized the country. As sentiments hardened against all French Muslims, he no longer felt safe there. One day, he was spat on and called, \\u201cDirty Arab.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s really the 2015 attacks that made me leave because I understood they were not going to forgive us,\\u201d said Mr. Louatah, 38, the grandson of Muslim immigrants from Algeria. \\u201cWhen you live in a big Democratic city on the East Coast, you\\u2019re more at peace than in Paris, where you\\u2019re deep in the cauldron.\\u201d\", \"Ahead of elections in April, President Emmanuel Macron\\u2019s top three rivals \\u2014 who are expected to account for nearly 50 percent of the vote, according to polls \\u2014 are all running anti-immigrant campaigns that fan fears of a nation facing a civilizational threat by invading non-Europeans. The issue is top of their agenda, even though France\\u2019s actual immigration lags behind that of most other European countries.\", \"The problem barely discussed is emigration. For years, France has lost highly educated professionals seeking greater dynamism and opportunity elsewhere. But among them, according to academic researchers, is a growing number of French Muslims who say that discrimination was a strong push factor and that they felt compelled to leave by a glass ceiling of prejudice, nagging questions about their security and a feeling of not belonging.\", \"The outflow has gone unremarked upon by politicians and the news media even as researchers say it shows France\\u2019s failure to provide a path for advancement for even the most successful of its largest minority group, a \\u201cbrain drain\\u201d of those who could have served as models of integration.\", \"\\u201cThese people end up contributing to the economy of Canada or Britain,\\u201d said Olivier Esteves, a professor at the University of Lille\\u2019s center on political science, public law and sociology, which surveyed 900 French Muslim \\u00e9migr\\u00e9s and conducted in-depth interviews with 130 of them. \\u201cFrance is really shooting itself in the foot.\\u201d\", \"French Muslims, estimated at 10 percent of the population, occupy a strangely outsize place in the campaign \\u2014 even if their actual voices are seldom heard. It is not only an indication of the lingering wounds inflicted by the attacks of 2015 and 2016, which killed hundreds, but also of France\\u2019s long struggle over identity issues and its unresolved relationship with its former colonies.\", \"They are being linked to crime or other social ills through dog-whistle expressions like \\u201czones of non-France,\\u201d used by Val\\u00e9rie P\\u00e9cresse, the center-right candidate now tied with the far-right leader, Marine Le Pen, for second place behind Mr. Macron. They are singled out for condemnation by the far-right television pundit and candidate \\u00c9ric Zemmour, who has said that employers have the right to deny jobs to Black and Arab people.\", \"The tenor of the race has stoked dread as they watch it from abroad, say Mr. Louatah and others who have left, speaking with a mix of anger and resignation of their home country, where they still have family and other strong ties.\", \"The places he and others have settled, including Britain and the United States, are not paradises free of discrimination for Muslims or other minority groups, but those interviewed said they nevertheless felt greater opportunity and acceptance there. It was outside France that, for the first time, the simple fact that they are French was not questioned, some said.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s only abroad that I\\u2019m French,\\u201d said Amar Mekrous, 46, who was raised in a Paris suburb by his immigrant parents. \\u201cI\\u2019m French, I\\u2019m married to a Frenchwoman, I speak French, I live French, I love French food and culture. But in my own country, I\\u2019m not French.\\u201d\", \"Finding the suspicion surrounding French Muslims oppressive after the 2015 attacks, Mr. Mekrous settled with his wife and three children in Leicester, England.\", \"In 2016, he created a Facebook group for French Muslims in Britain, which now has 2,500 members. Newcomers to Britain surged before Brexit, he said, adding that they were mostly young families and single mothers who found it difficult to find jobs in France because they wore the Muslim veil.\", \"Only recently have academic researchers begun to form snapshots of French Muslims who have left. They include the research project into the emigration of French Muslims led by academics affiliated with the University of Lille, a leading French university, and the National Center for Scientific Research, the French government\\u2019s main research institution.\", \"Separately, researchers at three other universities \\u2014 the University of Li\\u00e8ge and K.U. Leuven in Belgium, and the University of Amsterdam in the Netherlands \\u2014 have been working on a joint project looking at the emigration of Muslims from France, as well as from Belgium and the Netherlands.\", \"J\\u00e9r\\u00e9my Mandin, a French researcher involved in the study at the University of Li\\u00e8ge in Belgium, said that many young French Muslims had been disillusioned \\u201cthat they had played by the rules, done everything that was asked of them, and ultimately been unable to lead a desirable life.\\u201d\", \"Elyes Saafi, 37, a marketing executive at the London operations of StoneX, an American financial firm, grew up in Remiremont, a town in eastern France, where his parents settled after arriving from Tunisia in the 1970s. His father operated a spinning machine at a textile factory.\", \"Like his own parents, Mr. Saafi ended up making a new life in a new country. In London, he met his wife, Mathilde, who is French, and found an easygoing diversity unimaginable in France.\", \"\\u201cAt corporate dinners, there might be a vegetarian buffet or a halal buffet, but everybody mingles,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe C.E.O. shows up and he has a turban on his head, and he mixes with his employees.\\u201d\", \"The Saafis miss France, but they decided not to return partly because of worries about their 2-year-old son.\", \"\\u201cIn Britain, I\\u2019m not worried about raising an Arab child,\\u201d Ms. Saafi said.\", \"In 2020, anti-Muslim acts in France rose 52 percent over the previous year, according to official complaints gathered by the government\\u2019s National Human Rights Commission. Incidents have risen in the past decade, rising sharply in 2015. A rare official investigation in 2017 found that young men perceived as Arab or Black were 20 times more likely to have their identities checked by the police.\", \"In the workplace, job candidates with an Arab name had 32 percent less chance of being called for an interview, according to a government report released in November.\", \"Despite her degrees in European law and project management, Myriam Grubo, 31, said she was never able to find a job in France. After a half-dozen years abroad \\u2014 first in Geneva at the World Health Organization and then in Senegal at the Pasteur Institute of Dakar \\u2014 she is back in Paris with her parents. She is looking for work \\u2014 abroad.\", \"\\u201cTo feel like a stranger in my country is a problem,\\u201d she said, adding that she just \\u201cwanted to be left alone\\u201d to practice her faith.\", \"Rama Yade, a junior minister for human rights during the presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy, said that France\\u2019s denial of problems like police violence had made matters worse. She saw the current backlash in France against \\u201cwokisme\\u201d \\u2014 or supposedly \\u201cwoke\\u201d American ideas on social justice \\u2014 as \\u201cnothing else but a pretext to no longer fight discrimination.\\u201d\", \"When Ms. Yade \\u2014 born in Senegal in a Muslim family \\u2014 was appointed a junior government minister in 2007, she believed it would be a \\u201cstarting point.\\u201d But after an unsuccessful bid for the presidency in 2017, she left for the United States.\", \"\\u201cMy glass ceiling was political,\\u201d said Ms. Yade, 45, who is now senior director of Africa at the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based think tank.\", \"To her, the presidential race\\u2019s focus on immigration was the \\u201cconsecration of 20 years of deterioration\\u201d in a political culture obsessed with national identity. She had quit her political party \\u2014 for which Ms. P\\u00e9cresse is now the candidate \\u2014 because, Ms. Yade said, it had become \\u201cvery hostile to anything that did not represent a fantasy version of French identity.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Louatah, the writer in Philadelphia, whose French wife is an economist and teaches at the University of Pennsylvania, said he hoped to return one day to the country that fills his novels. When the television series based on his work, \\u201cThe Savages,\\u201d was broadcast in 2019, it became an immediate hit for the company behind it, Canal Plus \\u2014 and an unusual one, imagining France for the first time led by a president of North African descent.\", \"But two years later, Mr. Louatah has come to view his series as an \\u201canomaly.\\u201d He began writing the second season, with a story line focusing on police violence, one of the most sensitive themes in France. Ultimately, \\u201cThe Savages\\u201d was not renewed for reasons that he said were never made clear to him. A spokeswoman for Canal Plus said that the series had been planned for only one season.\", \"In Philadelphia, he is writing a new novel that deals with exile from a country that is never named.\"]","href_hash":"6bc888428cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6bc888428cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}},
