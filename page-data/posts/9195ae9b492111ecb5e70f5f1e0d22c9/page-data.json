Capitalism cannot love. This new work ethic, in which work is expected to give us something like self-actualization, cannot help but fail.\\u201d\", \"[You can listen to this episode of \\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\\u201d on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]\", \"Jaffe is a Type Media Center reporting fellow, a co-host of the podcast \\u201cBelabored\\u201d and the author of \\u201cWork Won\\u2019t Love You Back: How Devotion to Our Jobs Keeps Us Exploited, Exhausted and Alone.\\u201d Many of us, especially Gen Zers and millennials, have grown up with the idea that work should be more than just a way to make a living; it\\u2019s a vocation, a calling, a source of meaning and fulfillment. But for Jaffe, that idea is a scam, a con, a false promise. It prevents us from seeing work for what it really is: a power struggle over our time, our labor and our livelihoods.\", \"So this is a conversation about the dissonance between our expectations of what work can offer our lives and the reality of what our jobs and careers are capable of delivering \\u2014 about whether work can ever really love us back. But there\\u2019s a bigger picture here, too. Workers are quitting their jobs in record numbers. Strikes are taking place across the country. In her role as a labor reporter, Jaffe has spent much of the past year interviewing workers across the country \\u2014 spanning industries from retail to health care to tech \\u2014 giving her insight into the shift in attitudes behind this uproar in the labor market. So that\\u2019s where we begin: Why are so many Americans radically rethinking work?\", \"We also discuss the rise of corporate virtue signaling, the threat that American consumerism poses for worker power, how the decline of religion could be contributing to the veneration of careers, why the term \\u201cburnout\\u201d doesn\\u2019t go far enough in describing the problems of modern work, how the logic of capitalism has shaped our notions of human value and self-worth and more.\", \"You can listen to the whole conversation by following \\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\\u201d on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.
