Greetings from isolation on this final day of what was for many an unsettling, un-fun year. There\\u2019ll be no Champagne and caviar for me tonight, no elegant roast, no countdown to 2022. I might tie some flies, listen to an old Ry Cooder show. Quarantine and testing, here\\u2019s to auld lang syne.\", \"I hope that\\u2019s not the case for you. I hope you\\u2019re safe and happy in the embrace of family or friends, that you\\u2019ve got a good and safe plan for celebrating, that maybe you\\u2019ll look around in the fridge and be able to put together this Dutch baby with bacon and runny Camembert (above) to eat with cocktails, before something grand for dinner and the wait for the ball to drop.\", \"Say, honey-glazed chicken with shallots? Or creamy pan-roasted scallops with fresh tomatoes? With braised kale either way, and a Lisbon chocolate cake for dessert?\", \"And then for the morning, the first of the year, how about eggnog overnight French toast? Or, if you prefer a savory start, fried eggs, oven bacon and perfect hash browns?\", \"And then to follow at dinner, some black-eyed peas and greens? Kayla Stewart explored the tradition of cooking them for The Times recently, with recipes for collard greens and cornmeal dumplings, and for black-eyed peas with rice.\", \"But maybe not. Maybe you, like so many, like me, have been caught up in the spread of the omicron variant and find yourself in seclusion either with those you live with or all alone, and wondering if a peanut butter sandwich might be the best option for this evening (on warm toast, with chile crisp and pickles), or if a baked potato might be more festive (fully loaded, please!).\", \"Me, I hauled a couple of pork chops out of the freezer the other day \\u2014 beautiful heritage pork, red and marbled with fat, off an animal that took yoga and read poetry and had only one bad day in its life \\u2014 and could see my way to making pork chops in onion gravy tonight. There\\u2019ll be enough meat left over for a pork chop po\\u2019 boy on New Year\\u2019s Day, the meat cut off the bone and heated through in the leftover gravy, to put on a toasted hero roll with cold shredded iceberg lettuce and a few dollops of hot sauce. I\\u2019m living large.\", \"We have many thousands more actual recipes to cook tonight, tomorrow and tomorrow\\u2019s tomorrow waiting for you on New York Times Cooking. You do need a subscription to access them, it\\u2019s true. Subscriptions support our work. I\\u2019m so thankful to you if you\\u2019ve already secured one.

Someone will get back to you. (You can also write to me, if you\\u2019re particularly exercised or just want to say hello: I\\u2019m at foodeditor@nytimes.com. I read every letter sent.)\", \"Now, it\\u2019s nothing to do with tournedos Rossini or a salmon and caviar croque monsieur, but I\\u2019m dipping into \\u201cYellowstone\\u201d on Peacock and enjoying the scenery. The show itself? \\u201cBloodline\\u201d crossed with \\u201cSuccession\\u201d crossed with \\u201cSons of Anarchy,\\u201d with some \\u201cDynasty\\u201d and \\u201cThe Sopranos\\u201d in there, too.\", \"I\\u2019ve had Gilbert Cruz\\u2019s \\u201cThe Essential Stephen King\\u201d bookmarked since he published the guide in 2020. I wanted a great crime novel and Gilbert delivered: King\\u2019s \\u201cThe Outsider,\\u201d my very first King. (Literally, my first. I\\u2019m working up to the scary stuff.)\", \"It is old-school travel writing of the sort that you don\\u2019t see very often these days, but Ben Lerwill\\u2019s visit to Devon, on Britain\\u2019s southeast coast, for National Geographic, introduced me to the term coasteering, which looks pretty cool.\", \"Finally, for Katy Tur and the rest of the fans who won\\u2019t be at Madison Square Garden tonight because the shows were canceled, here\\u2019s Phish on New Year\\u2019s Eve back in 2018, \\u201cMercury\\u201d into \\u201cSay It to Me S.A.N.T.O.S.\\u201d Noodly noodly!
