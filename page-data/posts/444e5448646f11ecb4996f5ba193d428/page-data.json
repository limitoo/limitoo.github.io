Around 500 people are hospitalised each year as a result of the infection.\", \"While the vast majority of cases recover in full, in rare instances the infection can lead to Guillain-Barre syndrome - a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks its nerves, sometimes resulting in permanent paralysis.\", \"New Zealand has one of the highest rates of campylobacter infection in the world, with 6000 to 7000 people diagnosed each year according to the national notifiable disease surveillance database, EpiSurv.\", \"It's estimated thousands more people are infected but do not seek medical help.\", \"Dr Jay Harrower from ARPHS said following good food preparation practices could help reduce the risk of contracting gastro-enteritis illnesses.\", \"\\\"Most importantly chill, prepare and cover poultry properly: store it in containers, keep it chilled, defrost it thoroughly, keep it separate, cook it fully and wash your hands regularly when preparing it.\\\"\", \"It was particularly important not to wash raw chicken - a common mistake which Dr Harrower said was \\\"a recipe for spreading and spraying the nasty bugs\\\".\", \"While most gastro-enteritis illnesses are contracted when people ingest contaminated food, they can also occur when people swim in contaminated water.\", \"ARPHS recommends members of the public check the [www.safeswim.org.nz Safeswim website] before heading to the beach, to ensure it's safe to take a dip.\", \"*\\u00a0For more information on campylobacter visit [www.arphs.health.nz/public-health-topics/disease-and-illness/campylobacter/ the ARPHS website].\", \"RNZ\"]","href_hash":"444e5448646f11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"444e5448646f11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
