Replays confirmed the ball was nowhere near the pad and had hit the top of the off-stump, although the impact was not enough to dislodge the bails.\", \"The lbw decision was overturned and Stokes, then on 16, could not suppress his glee at the reprieve, before he resumed batting.\", \"\\\"He knew that it definitely had not hit the pad,\\\" says Jonny Bairstow, whose 103 not out was England's first century of the series.\", \"Stokes had been rewarded with another 'life', after Cummins spilled a sharp return catch, when the batsman was on nine.\", \"The all-rounder went on to score 66 - his first half-century of the series - before off-spinner Nathan Lyon finally trapped him lbw.\", \"Stokes' 128-run partnership with Bairstow steadied England, who - at 36/4 - risked being subjected to follow-on, but went on to finish the day on 258/7.\", \"Stokes had sustained a left side strain, and looked in discomfort when playing the pull and sweep shots.\", \"Bairstow also batted through pain, after suffering a blow to the thumb from a Cummins delivery, but went on to bring up his seventh test hundred, which included three sixes.\", \"\\\"I'm absolutely over the moon,\\\" he says \\\"It's the hardest one so far.\\\"\", \"The 32-year-old needed medical attention to carry on and lead England's fight to salvage some pride, with Australia already holding an unassailable 3-0 lead in the five-match series.\", \"\\\"Yes, it was sore, but obviously, with the circumstances of the game, it was one of those decisions I made to stay out there.\\\"\", \"\\\"The medics can give you advice, but ultimately, you are out there playing an Ashes New Year's test match on a pink day in Sydney in front of the crowd.
