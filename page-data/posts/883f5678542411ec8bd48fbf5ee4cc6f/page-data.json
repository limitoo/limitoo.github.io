Dr. Jacqui Lewis said. \\u201cIt keeps on burning.\\u201d\", \"She should know. Dec. 5 is the one-year anniversary of the six-alarm fire that gutted Middle Collegiate Church in Manhattan\\u2019s East Village, where she serves as senior minister.\", \"At the time, all programs were virtual because of the pandemic, so there was no loss of life. But the loss of the historic building \\u2014 the home of New York\\u2019s Liberty Bell (which is safe and temporarily housed at the New-York Historical Society) was a blow. Dr. Lewis is part of a campaign to rebuild the sanctuary of the inclusive and socially active church by 2025.\", \"In the meantime, she keeps burning, preaching in person again at Middle\\u2019s temporary home, Calvary-St. George\\u2019s Parish, near Gramercy Park, and has published her fourth book, \\u201cFierce Love: A Bold Path to Ferocious Courage and Rule-Breaking Kindness that Can Heal the World.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Lewis, 62, lives in the East Village with her husband, the Rev. John Janka, a retired clergyman in the United Methodist Church. Although they are empty nesters, they maintain an open-door policy with their son, Joel Janka; their daughter-in-law, Gabrielle Deveaux; and their grandchildren, Ophelia, 3, and Octavius, 21 months.\", \"STILL COOKING At 7:30, I wake up thinking, this is going to be an amazing day. While I\\u2019m brushing my teeth, John makes the coffee. I\\u2019m a terrible coffee maker. I don\\u2019t know what the recipe is. When the coffee is ready, we sit in our two red swivel chairs that face north, toward the Chrysler Building. We catch up: What did you dream about? How did you sleep? John says, Do you have a sermon? No matter how much I\\u2019ve worked on it during the week, he knows me well enough to know I keep cooking it until the last minute. I want it to feel as present-tense as possible.\", \"NO NOTES At about 8:30 I hop in the shower. In the shower I\\u2019m rehearsing my sermon. Not loud-loud, but loud. I\\u2019m really turning the phrases over, thinking about the key thing, the poetic piece. I\\u2019m also memorizing. I don\\u2019t want to be looking at my notes on Sunday. If I have a piece of paper between me and everyone else, that\\u2019s not the best way to be with the spirit. It\\u2019s good for my soul to prepare. It\\u2019s joyful.\", \"MEDITATION The dreadlocks come down out of the shower, and I spend some time in the mirror. It\\u2019s difficult to talk while putting your lipstick and mascara on, so I go inside myself and really use that time in an almost meditative way. While I\\u2019m moisturizing my face and rubbing my muscles I\\u2019m thinking of the diversity of the people in the congregation and what they need to hear.\", \"NO ONE IS LEFT OUT I might think of Miss Geraldine, who\\u2019s an 80-year-old Black lady, or of Dominic, who\\u2019s 13 and white, or of Edna, who\\u2019s Latinx, and her wife, Heidi. Or I might see Daryl, who\\u2019s a queer Black man. I visualize them so I can think to myself, no one is left out. No one is left behind. This sermon needs to be fierce enough that if I\\u2019m talking about queer justice, I\\u2019m bringing the straight people with me. If I\\u2019m talking about the race problem, it can\\u2019t be just about Black people. To hit my mark and get the love out there, I need to weave everybody in.\", \"SOLIDARITY I don\\u2019t eat. There\\u2019s no food until church is over. That way, I\\u2019m in solidarity with people who have to skip meals. Also, the emptiness makes me feel focused. It\\u2019s a spiritual discipline, in a way.\", \"JOY PLACE Church starts at 11:45. My sermon starts at 12. I love to preach, so when I\\u2019m in the pulpit I\\u2019m in my joy place. I get a little, teeny butterfly when I say the first few words, but then I feel like I\\u2019m on a wind, or a breath. I\\u2019m in the zone. I feel enveloped in grace. And the interaction with the people is so much better than preaching from a square on a computer. I make eye contact. I can see you nod. I can see you cry.\", \"BREAD-BREAKING After church I\\u2019m totally spent. I get to say I\\u2019m done, and I might walk a little bit with a colleague or have lunch at one of two restaurants I\\u2019ve been going to. Both have outdoor seating. One is the French restaurant Boucherie in Union Square, and the other is the Italian restaurant Isabelle\\u2019s Osteria. Sunday is my work day, but it\\u2019s also my Sabbath day. To have that worship experience and then that bread-breaking experience is wonderful. If John\\u2019s with me we walk home holding hands. We\\u2019ve been married 16 years. Holding hands is our jam.\", \"SWEATS, SCREEN When I get home, I can\\u2019t wait to lock the door, kick my shoes in the air and put on socks and sweatpants. I\\u2019ll come out to the living room and watch something like a \\u201cblack-ish\\u201d rerun. It takes my brain to a transitional space. John\\u2019s at one end of the couch and I\\u2019m at the other. We\\u2019ll fall asleep.\", \"REVIVING NANA Then it\\u2019s 5:30 and we\\u2019ll think about dinner. I have learned how to make baked chicken so crispy it\\u2019s like fried. We\\u2019ll do that if we\\u2019re by ourselves. If the grandbabies are here it\\u2019s different. They\\u2019re jumping and dancing and running around. I\\u2019ll tell them I\\u2019m so tired I have to fall asleep on the floor. Then they come sit on my stomach and say, \\u201cNana! Wake up!\\u201d\", \"HEADS TOGETHER After dinner could be a time of reading. We read a lot of stuff about race and culture, like Dante Stewart or James Baldwin. Or we might zone out and watch movies until I totally fall asleep. But I am a firm believer in getting the makeup off my face, and John knows it, so he\\u2019ll wake me up so I can wash my face and brush my teeth. The last thing I like to do is look at pictures or videos of Ophelia and Octavius their parents have sent us. John and I share a phone with our heads together and look at it till it\\u2019s lights out, about 10:30ish.\"]","href_hash":"883f5678542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"883f5678542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}},
