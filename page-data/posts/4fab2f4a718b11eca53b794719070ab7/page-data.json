I think it is the first such conversation that I've had and I firmly felt that I was doing the right thing, responding as quickly as possible.\", \"\\\"For those who know me, I think they, hopefully, consider that I'm a caring and considerate person, so I can only apologise to Jamie.

survivors cannot make claims against institutions that haven't joined the scheme.\", \"Mr Hockley says the organisation is now seeking to join the scheme.\", \"In August, when Mr Mitchell's

Mr Hockley said,\\u00a0it was not Cricket Australia's responsibility to compensate survivors of sexual abuse by former ACT\\u00a0under-17 and under-19 team coach Ian King, whose teams competed in national carnivals administered by Cricket Australia and contained players destined for senior national selection.\", \"King was jailed for 19 years for a string of serious sexual offences against boys whom he coached in the ACT in the 1980s and 1990s.\", \"Asked if Cricket Australia's hands-off approach to King's offending would meet community expectations of the sport's peak body, Mr Hockley said: \\\"It's something we'll continue to work [on] and discuss with Cricket ACT to make sure that they're supported in this matter.\\\"\", \"Up to 15 players who were abused by King have been left \\\"penniless\\\" in their attempts to seek Redress Scheme payments from Cricket ACT, which was deemed incapable of meeting the financial obligations of the scheme, despite posting a $670,000 profit in 2020-21 on the back of $2.2 million in funding from Cricket Australia.\", \"Asked if the sport needed to take the lead from the AFL's concussion fund and carve out a portion of its sizeable TV rights income to address historical abuse matters that continue to surface, Mr Hockley said: \\\"I think it's something we need to continue to look at and how the sport responds in the most appropriate manner.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Nobody is blaming Nick Hockley for what happened in 1985'</div>\", \"Mr Mitchell told ABC Sport that one consolation of his traumatic experience
