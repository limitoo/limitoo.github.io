Food and beverage industry associations said the decisions showed aspartame was safe and a good option for people wanting to reduce sugar in their diets.\", \"The WHO said that the existing consumption levels meant, for example, a person weighing between 60-70kg would have to drink more than 9-14 cans of soda daily to breach the limit, based on the average aspartame content in the beverages - around 10 times what most people consume.\", \"\\\"Our results do not indicate that occasional consumption could pose a risk to most consumers,\\\" Branca said.\", \"He said the WHO was not urging companies to remove aspartame from their products entirely, but was instead calling for moderation from both manufacturers and consumers. Earlier this year, the WHO said there was no evidence that sweeteners helped with weight control, which the industry has disputed.\", \"\\\"We have raised a flag,\\\" Branca said.\", \"Reuters first reported in June that the IARC would put aspartame in group 2B as a \\\"possible carcinogen\\\" alongside aloe vera extract and traditional Asian pickled vegetables.\", \"The IARC panel said on Friday it had made its ruling based on three studies in humans in the United States and Europe that indicated a link between hepatocellular carcinoma, a form of liver cancer, and sweetener consumption, the first of which was published in 2016.\", \"It said limited evidence from earlier animal studies was also a factor, although the studies in question are controversial. There was also some limited evidence that aspartame has some chemical properties that are linked to cancer, the IARC said.\", \"\\\"In our view, this is really more a call to the research community to try to better clarify and understand the carcinogenic hazard that may or may not be posed by aspartame consumption,\\\" said Dr Mary Schubauer-Berigan, acting head of the IARC Monographs programme.\", \"Scientists with no links to the WHO reviews said the evidence that aspartame caused cancer was weak.\", \"\\\"Group 2B is a very conservative classification in that almost any evidence of carcinogenicity, however flawed, will put a chemical in that category or above,\\\" said Paul Pharaoh, a cancer epidemiology professor at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, the United States. He said JECFA had concluded there was no \\\"convincing evidence\\\" of harm.\", \"\\\"The general public should not be worried about the risk of cancer associated with a chemical classed as Group 2B by IARC,\\\" Pharaoh said.\", \"The WHO conclusion \\\"once again affirms that aspartame is safe\\\", said Kate Loatman, executive director of the International Council of Beverage Associations.\", \"\\\"Aspartame, like all low/no calorie sweeteners, when used as part of a balanced diet, provides consumers with choice to reduce sugar intake, a critical public health objective,\\\" said Frances Hunt-Wood, secretary general of the International Sweeteners Association.\", \"- Reuters\"]","href_hash":"1a241f4222cb11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1a241f4222cb11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
