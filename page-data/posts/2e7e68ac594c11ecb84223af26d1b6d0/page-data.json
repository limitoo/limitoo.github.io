Yet here they are, sharing a stage on this week\\u2019s list of recommended titles: Brooks\\u2019s rollicking autobiography \\u201cAll About Me!\\u201d is characteristically filled with snappy punch lines, while Robert Gottlieb\\u2019s \\u201cGarbo\\u201d returns its subject to her accustomed role as the inscrutable object of scrutiny.\", \"Also up this week: A book seeking to strip the mythology from World War II, a biography of the Surrealist painter Ren\\u00e9 Magritte and two decades of diary entries from the beloved comic essayist David Sedaris. The dissident Chinese artist Ai Weiwei looks back on his career and his family history, the Pulitzer-winning biographer Debby Applegate recounts the life of a Jazz Age brothel owner in New York, and three acclaimed writers (Lydia Davis, Ann Patchett and Susan Orlean) offer three very different essay collections. And in fiction, we recommend a philosophical supernatural thriller from France and a story collection from the accomplished novelist Lily King.\", \"Gregory CowlesSenior Editor, BooksTwitter: @GregoryCowles\", \"LOOKING FOR THE GOOD WAR: American Amnesia and the Violent Pursuit of Happiness, by Elizabeth D. Samet. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $28.) Samet\\u2019s new book is a discerning study of the gauzy mythology that has shrouded the historical reality of World War II. She argues that glib treatments of World War II have done real harm, distorting our understanding of the past and consequently shaping how we approach the future. It is \\u201ca work of unsparing demystification \\u2014 and there is something hopeful and even inspiring in this,\\u201d our critic Jennifer Szalai writes.\", \"ESSAYS TWO: On Proust, Translation, Foreign Languages, and the City of Arles, by Lydia Davis. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $35.) A novelist, short story writer and essayist, Davis is also an acclaimed translator. In addition to translating Proust and Flaubert, she has tackled a biography of Marie Curie, art catalogs, travel essays, histories of China and more. In this collection of essays she \\u201cextracts endless thrills from the painstaking process\\u201d of working with language, our critic Molly Young writes. \\u201cWhatever the topic, Davis is always superb company: erudite, adventurous, surprising.\\u201d\", \"ALL ABOUT ME! My Remarkable Life in Show Business, by Mel Brooks. (Ballantine, $29.99.) The comedic mind behind \\u201cThe Producers,\\u201d Blazing Saddles,\\u201d \\u201cYoung Frankenstein\\u201d and much more, now 95, tells his life story, keeping it light the whole way. He takes us through his years growing up poor in Brooklyn, his time in the Army (during which he accosted Bob Hope for an autograph), his days writing for Sid Caesar\\u2019s variety shows and the making of his big Hollywood successes. \\u201c\\u2018All About Me!\\u2019 takes humor as an absolute value,\\u201d our critic Alexandra Jacobs writes. \\u201cIts 460 pages rattle along like an extended one-liner.\\u201d\", \"THE ANOMALY, by Herv\\u00e9 Le Tellier. Translated from the French by Adriana Hunter. (Other Press, $16.99.) \\u201cThe Anomaly,\\u201d a runaway best seller in France, where it won the Prix Goncourt last year, combines high entertainment with serious literature. Its plot \\u2014 about the strange fate of a flight from Paris to New York and the people on it \\u2014 might have been borrowed from \\u201cThe Twilight Zone\\u201d or \\u201cBlack Mirror,\\u201d but it movingly explores urgent questions about reality, fate and free will. \\u201cIt\\u2019s impossible not to feel tenderness toward the bewildered characters,\\u201d our reviewer Sarah Lyall writes, \\u201cwith their valiant efforts to make sense of the unfathomable and to rewrite their stories according to the new reality.\\u201d\", \"MADAM: The Biography of Polly Adler, Icon of the Jazz Age, by Debby Applegate. (Doubleday, $32.50.) Some of Manhattan\\u2019s most colorful denizens \\u2014 from writers and pols to corrupt cops and mobsters \\u2014 traipsed through the Depression-era brothels run by Polly Adler, the savvy subject of this exuberant history by a Pulitzer-winning biographer. Adler\\u2019s life \\u201cshows how women who wish to transcend their status must become expert practitioners of chameleonism,\\u201d Paulina Bren writes in her review. \\u201cIn other words, the very trait that made Polly Adler survive and succeed is also what makes her defiantly elusive. Applegate, armed with formidable skills, may be the biographer who can come closest to revealing her.\\u201d\", \"MAGRITTE: A Life, by Alex Danchev with Sarah Whitfield. (Pantheon, $45.) Ren\\u00e9 Magritte embodied Flaubert\\u2019s dictum that artists should be orderly in life and wild in their work. A brilliantly subversive Belgian Surrealist with little patience for bohemian adventures, Magritte never fit in with the avant-garde, yet he became one of the most important painters of the 20th century. Our reviewer, Deborah Solomon, calls this biography \\u201caccessible, factually reliable and, at 439 pages, free of the inflated heft of so many recent biographies.\\u201d The book is especially strong, she adds, when it comes to Magritte\\u2019s career making art \\u201cbased on his belief that everyday life is shrouded in mystery.\\u201d\", \"1000 YEARS OF JOYS AND SORROWS: A Memoir, by Ai Weiwei. Translated by Allan H. Barr. (Crown, $32.) Dedicated to his parents and to his young son, the artist\\u2019s first memoir traces his life as a political dissident in China back to the story of his father, Ai Qing, a poet exiled during Mao\\u2019s murderous purge of intellectuals. \\u201cAi claims that unlike his father, \\u2018I lacked that ability to harness the power of words\\u2019; but this isn\\u2019t true,\\u201d Jiayang Fan writes in her review. \\u201cHe is most eloquent when he stops pontificating on art and surrenders, almost despite himself, to the act of remembering. \\u2026 Remembering, too, is a form of resistance. In documenting the past, he is also repudiating the country\\u2019s generations of imposed amnesia.\\u201d\", \"THESE PRECIOUS DAYS: Essays, by Ann Patchett. (Harper/HarperCollins, $26.99.) In this excellent collection, the veteran novelist and bookseller explores her relationships with three father figures, a friendship that blossomed during the pandemic and her decision not to have children, among other topics; her candor is a breath of fresh air. \\u201cThe days that Patchett refers to are precious indeed, but her writing is anything but,\\u201d Alex Witchel writes in her review. \\u201cPatchett\\u2019s heart, smarts and 40 years of craft create an economy that delivers her perfectly understated stories emotionally whole. Her writing style is most gloriously her own.\\u201d\", \"GARBO, by Robert Gottlieb. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $40.) A \\u201cbewildered, unsophisticated\\u201d 19-year-old when she arrived in Hollywood, Gottlieb writes in this richly detailed, scrupulous biography, Greta Garbo rapidly rose to become the most inscrutable of movie stars, even to her friends. \\u201cOnce Garbo steps in front of the camera, Gottlieb\\u2019s book comes gloriously into its own, a tour through a career offered by a shrewd, deeply perceptive docent, brimming with knowledge and insight,\\u201d Mark Harris writes in his review. \\u201cHe brings to his assessments a fan\\u2019s appreciation, a connoisseur\\u2019s acuity and an amused impatience with the aspects of them that are and always were ridiculous.\\u201d\", \"FIVE TUESDAYS IN WINTER, by Lily King. (Grove, $27.) As in her novels, many of the stories in King\\u2019s first collection of short fiction are preceded by loss and ignited by desire. Readers are reminded that what we call coming-of-age doesn\\u2019t happen in a single moment at 14, but that part of being human is to keep discovering new corners of being. In our time of anxiety and isolation, King writes stories to curl up in. \\u201cThe pursuit of desire \\u2014 the hubris and folly of it, its links to our intellect and the tricky synchronicity of brain and heart \\u2014 is King\\u2019s best subject,\\u201d Megan O\\u2019Grady writes in her review. \\u201cKing reminds us of the revelations still to be found in plot and character, those elements of fiction that might be called old-fashioned if it weren\\u2019t for the fact that she, with her range and emotional precision, never makes them feel so.\\u201d\", \"ON ANIMALS, by Susan Orlean. (Avid Reader, $28.) From show dogs to homing pigeons, from roving turkeys to restless ducks, Orleans\\u2019s essays celebrate the full spectrum of the animal kingdom with an eye toward the pathos of all creatures great and small. \\u201cThis emphasis on interconnectedness emerges not just from one essay after another but also from the cumulative effect of the collection as a whole,\\u201d Margaret Renkl writes in her review. \\u201cThough Orlean does not overtly wade into the thorn field of animal-rights debates, and though many of these essays predate a widespread public recognition of the escalating dangers of climate change and diminishing global biodiversity, what she understands about the human-animal relationship is fundamental to addressing both of those calamities: the fact that we belong to one another.\\u201d\", \"A CARNIVAL OF SNACKERY: Diaries (2003-2020), by David Sedaris. (Little, Brown, $32.) Like Sedaris\\u2019s exquisitely crafted personal essays, his diary entries explore odd hairstyles, blandly aggressive post office interactions, airport bureaucracy and the non sequiturs of small talk: micro-topics he elevates to their own pedestals of meaning and humor. \\u201cWhat sets Sedaris\\u2019s diaries apart from his essay collections is not that they\\u2019re more intimate (more wouldn\\u2019t be possible) or that they show a different aspect of the author or his life, but that the collections themselves are longer. Time passes,\\u201d Liana Finck writes in her review. \\u201cSomeone like Sedaris, who has such a gift for illuminating small things, would normally have no business crafting an edifice. But the beauty of a diary is that it doesn\\u2019t need to be crafted. It just grows on its own, while the diarist concentrates on the human-scale (or even microscopic) things that interest him.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"2e7e68ac594c11ecb84223af26d1b6d0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2e7e68ac594c11ecb84223af26d1b6d0"}},
