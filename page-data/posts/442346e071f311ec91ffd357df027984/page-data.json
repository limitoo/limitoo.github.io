Its actions have prompted concerns among Western and Ukrainian officials that an invasion could occur as soon as this month. \\u00a0\", \"The United States, the G7, NATO and the European Union have each warned of massive economic consequences to a Russian invasion. The U.S. has also said it would continue bolstering Ukraine's military defenses, and that NATO would move to reinforce its eastern flank. \\u00a0\", \"There are three different groups meeting on different days in Geneva, Switzerland, Brussels, Belgium and Vienna, Austria next week. Each session is expected to focus on different security issues, though there may be some overlap among them. \\u00a0\", \"Deputy Secretary Sherman and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov met on Sunday evening in Geneva, where the two sides discussed the topics to be addressed on Monday and in the coming days, according to a readout from the State Department.\\u00a0 \\u00a0\", \"Finally, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg will also meet on Monday with Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba during a gathering of the NATO-Ukraine Commission in Brussels, where the U.S. will be represented by the recently confirmed U.S. Ambassador to NATO, Julie Smith. \\u00a0\", \"No, the presidents are not expected to participate in any of the meetings next week. Their last direct interaction was a phone call that took place at Mr. Putin's request on December 31, 2021. \\u00a0\", \"The issues addressed will depend on the forum. No agendas have been publicly released. \\u00a0\", \"The first, bilateral meeting on January 10 is expected to focus on arms control issues, from traditional nuclear weapons to nontraditional arms like hypersonic weapons, space and cyber technologies. \\u00a0\", \"On Sunday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said there \\\"may be grounds\\\" for renewing a treaty with Russia that governs the deployment of intermediate nuclear forces in Europe. The Trump administration exited a version of that treaty in 2019, citing repeated violations by Russia. \\u00a0\", \"Blinken also said the U.S. was ready to address the \\\"scope and scale\\\" of military exercises in Europe, provided the Russians reciprocate. He said scaling down troop levels, however, was not being considered. \\u00a0\", \"On Wednesday, the NATO-Russia Council is expected to address some of the public demands Russia has made, including security guarantees from the alliance that it will not expand eastward. NATO's Secretary General, Jens Stoltenberg, has already said that only the alliance will determine its future membership. \\u00a0\", \"U.S. officials have said consistently that the U.S. was coordinating closely with its allies on the agendas for each session, and stressed the phrase, \\\"nothing about you, without you\\\" \\u2014 to underscore that no security discussions will take place without European allies, including Ukraine, present. \\u00a0\", \"In remarks at the State Department on Friday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Ukraine's security would be \\\"front and center\\\" in all the talks. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"We will make the point in every single one of these fora that the aggression against Ukraine will be met with\\u2026 massive consequences,\\\" he said. \\u00a0\", \"Last month, the Russians made public an eight-point draft security proposal that outlined a range of demands. \\u00a0\", \"They include, among others, a commitment that Ukraine will never join NATO; that military arms be withdrawn from and drills be halted in countries that joined the alliance after 1997; and a ban on deploying intermediate-range missiles and nuclear weapons from outside countries' national territories. \\u00a0\", \"While U.S. and NATO officials have already ruled out some of the Russian proposals, they have said some, including a discussion of arms control and increased transparency in military activities, could serve as a starting point for negotiations. \\u00a0\", \"First and foremost, Western powers want indications of de-escalation from Moscow, which have thus far not materialized. \\u00a0\", \"Blinken said on Friday that Russia had massed nearly 100,000 troops at Ukraine's border, with \\\"plans to mobilize twice that number on very short order.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"U.S. officials have otherwise been more circumspect in detailing their asks for Moscow. Senior administration officials have said they would offer a detailed \\\"laydown\\\" of concerns at the appropriate time, but have declined to specify either what the U.S. hopes to achieve or what it rejects from Russia's public demands. \\u00a0\", \"A wholesale breakthrough is not impossible, but highly unlikely. Because these are complex issues being discussed in multiple venues by a variety of stakeholders, the pace of dialogue is likely to be incremental and piecemeal. Both Russian and American officials offered pessimistic outlooks over the weekend.\\u00a0\", \"In remarks following a meeting of foreign ministers on Friday, NATO's Stoltenberg said that the alliance had a \\\"dual-track\\\" approach to Moscow and, while it would prioritize dialogue and a political solution, would also have to be \\\"prepared for the possibility that diplomacy will fail.\\\" \\u00a0\", \"Blinken said Sunday that the U.S. was \\\"committed to dialogue and diplomacy,\\\" but that the U.S. would deal \\\"very resolutely\\\" with Russia if it pursued conflict. \\u00a0\", \"It means the risk of an invasion is still real and acute. Russia has shown no signs of pulling back forces since its buildup began. U.S. defense and intelligence officials have said Russian units are positioned for a rapid, large-scale invasion. \\u00a0\", \"Stoltenberg emphasized on Friday that Russia's military buildup had \\\"not stopped.\\\" \\u00a0\", \"\\\"We see armored units, we see artillery, we see combat-ready troops. We see electronic warfare equipment and we see a lot of different military capabilities, which are gradually building up in and around Ukraine,\\\" he said. \\\"The capabilities, the rhetoric and the track record, of course, that sends a message that there is a real risk for new armed conflict in Europe.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"[T]o make actual progress, it's very hard to see that happening when there's an ongoing escalation, when Russia has a gun to the head of Ukraine,\\\" Blinken said Sunday. \\u00a0\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"442346e071f311ec91ffd357df027984"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"442346e071f311ec91ffd357df027984"}},
