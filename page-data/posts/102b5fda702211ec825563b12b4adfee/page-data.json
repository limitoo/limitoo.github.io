For a lot of us, we haven't played against Australia, for example, and South Africa for at least nearly a year now. They've got a few changes in their squads, so it'll be good to see them.\", \"\\\"And also, [we're] up against England as well - who I think have had a fantastic series against Jamaica just recently. So overall it's a massive staging for us.\", \"\\\"We'll be able to see what we can and can't do, where our gaps are and set tasks in the ANZ [Premiership] to best prepare for the final selections.\\\"\", \"The Quad Series also means the return of the pair of Phoenix Karaka and Kayla Johnson, both back in the international ranks for the first time since becoming mothers.\", \"And with the likes of senior players Ameliaranne Ekenasio, Katrina Rore and Jane Watson among those to miss out, younger players have been given a golden opportunity to stake their places for a Commonwealth Games place.\", \"\\\"I'm really excited by what we have. There's a lovely mix of players who're coming back into the mix - regards to Phoenix and also Kayla. I'm interested to see what they look like back in the international stage.\", \"\\\"We've got a really young shooting end, and Te Aroha Keenan, who's also the New Zealand secondary schools [coach]. She'll be coming with us on tour, she's got a bit of work to do in regards to that shooting end - but that's also her expertise.\", \"\\\"Like always, we've got our midcourt engine room. It's hard to tell, but what they've been doing the last three-four weeks has been quite inspirational in regards of their preparation and training.\\\"\", \"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"102b5fda702211ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"102b5fda702211ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
