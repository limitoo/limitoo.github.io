Andrew Cuomo was, of course, compelled to resign the governorship of New York in August, approximately one second ahead of likely impeachment for what we can perhaps describe as verbal harassment and pathological grabbiness.\", \"Now Chris Cuomo has been suspended by CNN, where he is a top-rated news host. There\\u2019s no question that he was trying to help with his brother\\u2019s defense even as he was assuring his viewers and bosses that it was more or less hands off.\", \"(In a happier time, when everything wasn\\u2019t so depressing, we might have noted that \\u201chands off\\u201d would also have been a policy that could have saved Andrew Cuomo\\u2019s career.)\", \"Our job today is to decide how bad Chris Cuomo\\u2019s Andrew-related activities have been. It\\u2019s very easy to sympathize with his desire to protect his older brother. Their bond was evident in a series of joint, jibing TV appearances they did, some while Chris was recovering from Covid early last year, quarantined away from his family.\", \"\\u201cRule 1 is never hit a brother when he\\u2019s down, and you\\u2019re literally in the basement,\\u201d the governor pointed out.\", \"The banter went on and on. Including one unfortunate episode in which Chris called Andrew the \\u201clove guv.\\u201d (At a later date, CNN shared \\u201cthe very moment\\u201d Chris finally emerged from his below-ground exile \\u2014 which was problematic only in that he\\u2019d reportedly been out for days.)\", \"As a journalist, Chris had a terrible conflict of interest when Andrew fell into headline-making disgrace. The obvious answer was to keep clear, steeling himself against a very natural desire to protect a brother and a very Cuomo-like impulse to take control of the situation.\", \"Now we know how he really responded.\", \"\\u201cOn it,\\u201d he said, when his brother\\u2019s most powerful staff member, Melissa DeRosa, asked him to find out from his \\u201csources\\u201d whether Politico was working on a new damaging Andrew story.\", \"In a more perfect world, this sort of temptation wouldn\\u2019t have come up because Andrew would have fiercely ordered his younger brother to stay away from the whole mess. Directed the staff to leave Chris alone and maybe organized a family intervention. It does say something that our former governor didn\\u2019t try to protect him.\", \"Almost everything in this saga goes back to family. You have to wonder if the brothers\\u2019 impulse to take action \\u2014 even action that objective minds would instantly discern as a really bad idea \\u2014 is a response to the defects of Dad, who was once nicknamed \\u201cHamlet on the Hudson.\\u201d\", \"Mario Cuomo, in a moment that must be seared into the minds of his offspring, was expected to fly to New Hampshire and file, at the very last minute, for the presidential primary in 1991. But he left two chartered planes waiting at the Albany airport, claiming that he needed to go back to work with the Republicans on a state budget.\", \"Not surprising that his sons are action-oriented. Not necessarily always to their advantage.\", \"Chris Cuomo told state investigators \\u2014 lately state investigators seem to be omnipresent in family life \\u2014 that he was obsessed with thinking of ways to protect Andrew, and the question of how he should protect himself \\u201cjust never occurred to me.\\u201d Hmm.\", \"One of the things Chris was worried about was an article he had heard Ronan Farrow was preparing for The New Yorker. His paranoia certainly made sense. If you had ever once for a single second worried that a prominent member of your family was pathologically grabby with female employees, Ronan Farrow is one of the last people in the world you want around asking questions.\", \"What did Chris do? Well, according to his own testimony to state officials, he went poking around \\u2014 sort of like an investigative reporter \\u2014 trying to find out what Farrow was up to. It was precisely what he\\u2019d promised not to do.\", \"\\u201cPlease let me help with the prep,\\u201d he told DeRosa around the time when the team was getting ready for the gubernatorial defense. Many, many text messages and email chains followed.\", \"Then he took on Anna Ruch, who had accused Andrew of trying to kiss and fondle her at a wedding reception in 2019. \\u201cI have a lead on the wedding girl,\\u201d he reported to DeRosa.\", \"The story, as Chris told it, was that a friend called to express concern that said wedding girl had been \\u201cput up to it.\\u201d This is very possibly true \\u2014 the part about the call, that is. If somebody claimed your brother had made inappropriate moves at a public event, a pal or two might let you know they were on his side. Even if they secretly \\u2026 wondered.\", \"One big problem with Chris\\u2019s reporting is that it\\u2019s at best pretty useless. And at worst \\u2014 which is also in reality \\u2014 pretty wrong.\", \"Where do you draw the line between journalism and family? Maybe at the point where you, the prominent news anchor, start thinking that your job is running down rumors for your brother.\"]","href_hash":"64c737c6530d11ecb74ec955a41e95b6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"64c737c6530d11ecb74ec955a41e95b6"}},
