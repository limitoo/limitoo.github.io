U.S. sources confirm the extradition is scheduled.\", \"Hern\\u00e1ndez, the release says, will be extradited Thursday at 9 a.m. ET from Hernan Acosta Mejia airbase. He'll then be brought to New York by authorities to face weapons and drug trafficking charges, according to a senior U.S. official. Honduras' highest court cleared the way last month for Hern\\u00e1ndez to be sent to the U.S.after, rejecting\\u00a0 Hern\\u00e1ndez's appeal to stop the extradition.\\u00a0\", \"Hern\\u00e1ndez was president from 2014 until his second term concluded in January. He was arrested in Honduras' capital city of Tegucigalpa in February.\\u00a0\", \"U.S. prosecutors in the Southern District of New York are expected to unseal an indictment against him this week. In recent years, they have accused Hern\\u00e1ndez of funding his political rise with profits from drug traffickers in exchange for protecting their shipments. He has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.\", \"Hern\\u00e1ndez has insisted that statements against him have been made by drug traffickers extradited by his government who wanted revenge.\\u00a0\", \"It is extremely unusual for a former head of state to be extradited to another country to face prosecution for drug and weapons trafficking. In this case, Hern\\u00e1ndez was the leader of a country whose residents have been fleeing en masse to the U.S. due in part to this very type of corruption. Honduras is also a major recipient of U.S. aid \\u2013 over the past 20 years, the U.S. has given more aid to Honduras \\u2014 $125 million \\u2014 than any other country.\"]","href_hash":"06c447c0c12311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"06c447c0c12311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
