So I would love to see that funding brought up to a level where it was sustainable, where we didn't have to beg, steal and borrow to get by.\\\"\", \"Bay Financial Mentors Tau Awhi Noa was formerly known as Tauranga Budget Advisory Services.\", \"McCombe said the name change, which took effect on the organisation's 50th anniversary signalled the reciprocal nature of the relationship with their clients, the desire to incorporate Te Tiriti o Waitangi and Tikanga M\\u0101ori into their practice, and a commitment to whanaungatanga (the importance of relationships), manaakitanga (respect and generosity) and kotahitanga (unity).\", \"She also said it was important to move away from the term \\\"budget advisors\\\" because the services provided were more than just budgeting.\", \"\\\"The word budget is aptly with the word diet... it's about going without, it feels like punishing yourself, I guess and it's a very old fashioned idea of going along to somebody who works out what comes in and what goes out and tells you all the things you're doing wrong and sends you on your way.\", \"\\\"And that is absolutely what we're not about these days, we spend a great majority of our time advocating for people, providing education, negotiation, all those sorts of things. So the budgeting itself, is a small part of a much bigger picture.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"138196e49c3311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"138196e49c3311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
