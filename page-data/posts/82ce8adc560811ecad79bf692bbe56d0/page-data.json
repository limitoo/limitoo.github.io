We're going to have to continue to build a movement. If we don't change the rules of the Senate, then we're ultimately going to need 60 votes and so we need to continue to build up our political power around the country,\\\" Murphy stated.\", \"Tapper then asked Murphy about more modest gun reform legislation that has been proposed by Senators Joe Manchin, a West Virginia Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a Pennsylvania Republican. The legislation would close the so-called \\\"gun show loophole\\\" by adding a requirement for unlicensed firearms dealers to do background checks on gun buyers.\", \"Tapper said Toomey told him a few months ago that he thinks the bill could get 60 votes in the Senate, but that there's \\\"been no progress on it because people who want gun reform in the Senate want big, sweeping gun reform and won't be happy with even just an incremental step, like closing the gun show loophole.\\\"\", \"\\\"Isn't something better than nothing?\\\" Tapper asked Murphy.\", \"\\\"I won't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.

And so my hope is that in the next couple weeks we can get back to the table and see if we can, at the very least as you said, maybe close the gun show loophole.
