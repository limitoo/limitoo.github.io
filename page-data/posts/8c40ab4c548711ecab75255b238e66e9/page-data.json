When the policy was introduced by the Trump administration, human rights organizations were quick to condemn the former president, and placed pressure on President Joe Biden to do away with the policy, which he ultimately did in February.\", \"Following an August 13 ruling by a federal court in Texas, the administration faced pressure to renew the policy, with the legal standing for that ruling supported by an August 24 Supreme Court decision whereupon the nation's highest governing body refused to block the Texas decision.\", \"Now that the administration will follow through with the court's guidance, human rights organizations share how the decision to continue the program will endanger the lives of migrants and jeopardize their abilities to claim legal asylum in the U.S.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945358/topshot-mexico-us-politics-migration.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Families are not exempt from MPP, leaving young children in vulnerable situations as their asylum claims are processed.

Factors including language, skin color, and general xenophobia make migrants targets of crime and violence in Mexico, Garza said. And under the new version of MPP, more people could be targeted.\", \"Under the prior iteration of MPP, those originating from Central American countries fell under the category of those who had to follow Remain in Mexico rules. Under the new version, individuals from Haiti will fall under this category. Most Haitians are Black and speak Creole, which could make them greater targets of crime as they await processing in Mexican border cities.\", \"The International Rescue Committee (IRC) shared these concerns, stressing that Black and indigenous migrants are \\\"routinely targeted\\\" on the basis of their skin color. While MPP does recognize other vulnerable groups, the IRC fears that disorder in enforcing the policy may ultimately result in some of these individuals still being unable to cross the border.\", \"In October, BuzzFeed News published a report where it shared government documents detailing how certain border authorities did not comply with MPP exemption rules, barring exempt migrants with disabilities and medical conditions from entering the country.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1778626/border-tent-camp.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Some migrants cannot afford accommodations, electing to live in tents as their cases are processed.

If you're just trying to figure out how to live and negotiate each day, how do you get yourself into the mindset where you're able to actually prepare an asylum application?\\\" Rabinovitz said. \\\"In some cases, it may be that people don't even get notice of their hearing because when they're returned, they don't have an address and then there's no way to notify them.\\\"\", \"A report by the American Immigration Council states that 7.5 percent of individuals in Mexico under MPP were able to hire a lawyer. Almost a year after the program went into effect in January 2019, the council reported that of the over 42,000 MPP cases completed, 521 people (1.2 percent) were granted relief. In contrast, a general analysis of asylum cases undertaken by Syracuse University, which took into account people applying who were not under MPP, found that 29 percent of requests were approved that same year, in financial year 2020.\"]","href_hash":"8c40ab4c548711ecab75255b238e66e9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8c40ab4c548711ecab75255b238e66e9"}},
