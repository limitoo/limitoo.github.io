He died at age 35 from an aortic aneurysm the day before the first preview of his breakthrough hit, \\u201cRent.\\u201d In addition to \\u201cRent,\\u201d Larson left behind the 1991 meta-musical \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!,\\u201d a self-portrait of the artist as an angst-ridden wretch, which Miranda has reverently dusted and polished like a sacred totem for a select cult. When Larson introduces himself as \\u201ca musical theater writer, one of the last of my species,\\u201d the line prods fans to protest that his as-yet-unwritten rock musical would galvanize a generation of creators. Miranda, who saw \\u201cRent\\u201d at 17, is palpably thrilled to gain access to his hero\\u2019s hovel on Greenwich Street, here recreated with exactitude \\u2014 right down to the Scorpions cassette.\", \"\\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!\\u201d is an autobiography of anxieties. Larson, played with kinetic desperation by Andrew Garfield, fixates on success. How can he get it? How long can his wallet can hold out for it? How much might his all-consuming ambition cost him emotionally? Larson stakes his hopes on wowing producers with a head-scrambling sci-fi operetta called \\u201cSuperbia.\\u201d At the same time, his dancer girlfriend, Susan (Alexandra Shipp, primarily tasked to look beatific), threatens to slink off to a teaching job in the Berkshires, and his best friend, Michael (Robin de Jes\\u00fas), sells out for a corporate salary and an apartment big enough to host the film\\u2019s only full-on dance number. (The charismatic de Jes\\u00fas celebrates his walk-in closet by letting Garfield spin him in the air like a Christmas puppy.)\", \"\\u201cCompromise or persevere?\\u201d Garfield\\u2019s striver croons, convinced that his impending 30th birthday \\u2014 the time bomb in the title \\u2014 will mark his decline from future superstar to \\u201cwaiter with a hobby.\\u201d Foreshadowing carries the film. Even the songs cop that Larson was not yet the lyricist he would become. The lyrics dwell on chirpy observations about his diner job, his writer\\u2019s block, his favorite swimming pool (another location in the film) and, of course, his prescient fear of mortality, which is the only reason Steven Levenson\\u2019s screen adaptation has dramatic heft.\", \"Miranda\\u2019s devotion to his idol keeps him from expanding the musical\\u2019s myopic fretting into a universal story of sacrifice and resolve. Garfield at least gives Larson an endearing vulnerability. While he isn\\u2019t a lifelong singer like Vanessa Hudgens (in a supporting role as a cast member in Larson\\u2019s show-within-the-show), Garfield holds up his half of their duet with a capable voice that creaks just enough to sound sincere. As a dancer, Garfield is a gleeful pogo-bopping creature in the homespun key of David Byrne. His gangly limbs fill the frame, and the cinematographer Alice Brooks even follows his lead by eschewing pizazz for the humble grays of a walk-up apartment in winter. Instead, it\\u2019s up to a constellation of stage legends to bring the glitz \\u2014 and boy, do they, in a centerpiece number with so many cameos that this small-scale film briefly becomes Broadway\\u2019s \\u201cAvengers.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"be6db53c486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"be6db53c486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}},
