Then the police arrived, and he was jailed under China’s strict but messy gun laws.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-01T10:29:24.000Z","content":"[\"When the police swarmed into San Cheng\\u2019s apartment in Beijing late at night and accused him of illegally buying guns, he was sure it was a mix-up.\", \"True, he had bought dozens of toy guns on Taobao, the Alibaba shopping site, as props for his business designing shoot-em-up games for smartphones. But the seemingly harmless replicas were so cheap and easily purchased, Mr. Cheng said, that he thought owning them could not be a crime.\", \"He was wrong. Mr. Cheng, 47, a Taiwanese American game designer, ended up spending three years in detention and prison. In detention, he said, he met 20 or so other men who had also been arrested in a police sweep against buying replica guns online.\", \"China has some of the world\\u2019s toughest weapons laws, including broad definitions of what counts as an illegal gun. But Mr. Cheng\\u2019s experience shows how wildly expansive the rules can be, potentially punishing people for buying toy or replica guns that are widely available online.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re China\\u2019s biggest digital retailing platform,\\u201d Mr. Cheng said, referring to Taobao, in an interview from New Jersey, where he has been recovering after his release from a Chinese prison last year. \\u201cPeople just don\\u2019t understand that they\\u2019re illegal, because if you go on to Taobao and search for toy guns, you\\u2019ll get so many recommendations.\\u201d\", \"The Chinese authorities have mostly prosecuted the buyers of such items, and to a lesser extent, the sellers, according to a search of an online nationwide database of court judgments. But the online shopping platforms where these sales take place have rarely been targeted, and it is unclear how much legal responsibility companies like Alibaba have in such situations.\", \"In Taobao\\u2019s terms of service, Alibaba warns shoppers that they are buying from third-party merchants, which means the company cannot possibly guarantee that each and every product is safe, high-quality and legal. Alibaba declined to comment.\", \"Mr. Cheng and other campaigners have urged the authorities to turn up the pressure on China\\u2019s online shopping sites rather than jail ill-informed buyers.\", \"China\\u2019s strong gun controls mean that fatal shootings are rare, and many citizens support the laws to keep it that way. But there has been a growing debate over the legal definition of a firearm. Experts say that China\\u2019s regulations \\u2014 which ban buying, selling or owning weapons above a very low threshold of force \\u2014 are vague and hard for laypeople, even judges, to understand. The result, critics say, is that unsuspecting buyers of compressed-air and spring-powered toys are turned into criminals.\", \"China\\u2019s gun control law of 1996 states that to be legally classified as a gun, a weapon has to be capable of killing someone or knocking them unconscious. But in 2010, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security imposed far stricter rules that in effect defined many toys as illegal guns. Under the rules, a toy gun that fires a projectile with enough force to tear a sheet of newspaper \\u2014 far short of lethal or dangerous force \\u2014 can be considered a gun, according to lawyers.\", \"In a study published in 2019, investigators from China\\u2019s Public Security University found that nearly all of a random sample of 229 replica guns bought online would be classified as illegal under the 2010 rules.\", \"\\u201cThese toy guns are openly sold in Hong Kong, but in the mainland they\\u2019re treated as weapons and ammunition,\\u201d said Wang Jinzhong, whose son was sentenced to life imprisonment in Hebei Province, northern China, in 2016, for owning 16 replicas that the police deemed illegal.\", \"\\u201cFrankly, there are many things more dangerous than these toys,\\u201d said Mr. Wang, who has petitioned judges and officials for his son, Wang Yinpeng, 37, to be released. \\u201cThis really is a human rights disaster for China.\\u201d\", \"Chinese regulators have demanded over the years that Alibaba be more proactive about stopping various kinds of illegal goods from being sold on its digital bazaars. In 2015, the country\\u2019s market watchdog accused the company of turning a blind eye to sales of fake alcohol and cigarettes, knockoff designer bags and \\u201citems that endanger public safety,\\u201d such as certain knives. Alibaba called the regulator\\u2019s findings \\u201cflawed\\u201d and filed a complaint.\", \"When it comes to objects that might count as illegal firearms, Taobao warns customers about the risks, though somewhat inconsistently. Searching for \\u201creplica gun\\u201d on the platform yields no results \\u2014 only a warning message about China\\u2019s gun laws. But tweak the search term \\u2014 to, say, \\u201cgun toy replica\\u201d \\u2014 and Taobao displays plenty of replica handguns and rifles.\", \"Zhou Yuzhong, a lawyer in southern China who specializes in defending people accused of buying illicit guns, said the key problem was that the definition of a gun is so technical in China that special equipment is needed to judge if a product is illegal.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s very hard for sellers and consumers to see at a glance whether a gunlike object crosses the threshold,\\u201d Mr. Zhou said. That makes it just as difficult for Taobao and other e-commerce sites to police listings for illegal guns as it is for shoppers to avoid buying them.\", \"Some Chinese police bureaus and consumer associations have offered simple advice for anyone considering purchasing toy guns online: just don\\u2019t.\", \"Mr. Cheng, the Taiwanese American game developer, said that the other inmates and detainees he met \\u2014 who included military hobbyists and parents \\u2014 had also bought their replicas on the internet. \\u201cMost were dads who had bought them for their kids,\\u201d Mr. Cheng said.\", \"Mr. Cheng said that he bought his guns in 2016 to use them as models for designing first-person shooting games. His account was supported by Paula Friedman, a poet and writing coach who befriended Mr. Cheng and his wife when they were living in the United States.\", \"\\u201cI got no indication from him or from her that he had any interest in guns,\\u201d Ms. Friedman, who helped the couple after Mr. Cheng\\u2019s arrest, said in an interview from California. \\u201cThat was never a part of their lives.\\u201d \", \"Until a judge announced he was guilty and sentenced him, Mr. Cheng had felt confident he would be freed, he said. The court, though, accepted the police accusations, which Mr. Cheng said unfairly painted him as a \\u201cgun nut\\u201d and exaggerated the threat of his toy guns. He had never fired them, he said.\", \"In China, lawyers, judges and even members of the legislature have pushed back against the country\\u2019s gun laws for years, arguing that they were leading to cases of unjustified imprisonment.\", \"China\\u2019s highest court and prosecution office sought to ease the problem by issuing guidance in 2018 advising legal authorities to take into account how harmful suspected illegal guns really are, and buyers\\u2019 intentions in acquiring them.\", \"Since that official guidance, judgments in gun cases \\u201chaven\\u2019t been as rigid as before,\\u201d said Mr. Zhou, the lawyer. Many defendants are now given suspended sentences, meaning they will not go to prison unless they reoffend, court records indicate.\", \"Still, the authorities continue to crack down on guns and replicas, recently launching a campaign in May. And even if those found guilty are spared prison time, they must live with a criminal record and the stigma that comes with it.\", \"Mo Zhicheng, a retired driving instructor in the southern city of Guangzhou, said he had been appealing unsuccessfully for the conviction of his son to be overturned. His son had bought six toy guns more than a decade ago, when he was a teenager.\", \"\\u201cHe wants to find work but can\\u2019t find any now,\\u201d Mr. Mo said. \\u201cWhen they see he has a gun possession conviction, nobody dares employ him.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6489359c529111ec81de372dbf136874"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6489359c529111ec81de372dbf136874"}},
