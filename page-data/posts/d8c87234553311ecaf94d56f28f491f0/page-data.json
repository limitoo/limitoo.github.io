Unlike many businesses which have since opened as restrictions eased, cinemas have remained closed.\", \"Today, their doors have finally opened once again as the country moved to the traffic light system.\", \"But going to the movies will be a different experience under the traffic light system.\", \"As no area of the country has started off in 'green', only people who are vaccinated, or those aged under 12, are able to go to public screenings under the new framework - not just in Auckland but anywhere in the country.\", \"However, cinemas can hold \\\"gatherings\\\" (private groups where attendees are known to each other) without using My Vaccine Pass. Numbers are limited to 25 under 'red' and '50' in 'orange' zones, according to advice from Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment.\", \"Theatres can move between using the vaccine pass, and not, but must clean between groups. All staff at any business using the vaccine pass must be vaccinated.\", \"When using the vaccine pass in the red setting, numbers are limited to 100 per defined space, or based on 1m distancing - whichever is the lesser. People can still buy drinks and food and consume them in the theatre. Masks are \\\"encouraged\\\".\"]","href_hash":"d8c87234553311ecaf94d56f28f491f0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d8c87234553311ecaf94d56f28f491f0"}},
