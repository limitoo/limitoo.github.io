But that morning in Tokyo, where we lived then, I awoke with the same heaviness I have felt on this day since meeting my husband, Andy, nearly eight years before.\", \"He was already out for a jog.\", \"I pulled our 4-year-old twin boys out of bed, opened a box of crayons and told them we were going to make daddy a card. They didn\\u2019t ask why, and I didn\\u2019t tell them that it was so he would feel our warmth and affection on this day, the anniversary of the worst day of his life. They drew colorful hearts, and I wrote \\u201cWe Love You\\u201d in big letters.\", \"When Andy returned, one of our boys ran to the door, arm outstretched, proudly handing him our creation.\", \"\\u201cThanks guys,\\u201d Andy said with a smile, his eyes asking me: What is this for?\", \"\\u201cBecause it\\u2019s today,\\u201d I said.\", \"\\u201cWhat\\u2019s today?\\u201d he asked, wiping the sweat from his forehead.\", \"\\u201cToday. You know \\u2014 \\u201d\", \"It hit him: This was the day that his first wife and two sons died in the Haiti earthquake 10 years earlier. His body deflated, and his face, still bright from his run, crumpled.\", \"Then the texts began: \\u201cThinking about you.\\u201d \\u201cSending love.\\u201d With every buzz of his phone, he would look at me with a pleading face, as if to say: \\u201cHow could all these people remember, except me?\\u201d\", \"Of course, he never forgets. He tells me they are with him every day; I imagine their memories like a heavy blanket wrapped around his heart, keeping him warm and grounded.\", \"He rationalized that his slip of the mind that day honored who they were, because they wouldn\\u2019t want him to still tear up at the sound of children\\u2019s laughter, to still be vacillating between sorrow, anger and emptiness.\", \"\\u201cForgetting\\u201d also meant he was present in a way that was once unimaginable \\u2014 waking up without dread, going for a carefree run, sitting down for toast and eggs with his family.\", \"Our boys didn\\u2019t know about Andy\\u2019s past. He and I met two years after the earthquake when our work overlapped. In time, Andy and I fell in love, married and had twin sons. As the boys turned 3, then 4, I found myself searching online, \\u201cWhat is the right age to talk to children about death?\\u201d\", \"I wondered when they would ask about the other two boys in framed photos on our bookshelves or recognize them on their grandmother\\u2019s refrigerator \\u2014 the pictures that didn\\u2019t change with each new baseball season or dance recital like those of the other grandchildren. Those two faces never grow up.\", \"When I looked at my sons \\u2014 at their baby teeth smiles and wrists still pudgy with baby fat \\u2014 I could only guess at who they would be years from now. Andy often wondered the same about his first boys. One recent August marked when the eldest, Evan, would have turned 18. Would he be headed off to college? How would his voice sound?\", \"That August afternoon, we had just finished eating lunch next to a lake near our home when Andy turned to me and said, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to tell them.\\u201d\", \"I felt anxious, not knowing how the boys would take it, but also reassured by Andy\\u2019s calm. We got up and started walking along the edge of the lake when Andy stopped and said, \\u201cBoys, I have something to tell you.\\u201d\", \"They loved his stories and ran to him, each grabbing a hand.\", \"\\u201cMany years ago,\\u201d he said, \\u201cwhen I was working in a country called Haiti, I lived with my two sons and their mom. My sons were just about your age \\u2014 Baptiste was almost 5, and Evan was 7. Today is Evan\\u2019s birthday actually; he would have been 18. One day, there was a big earthquake.\\u201d He explained what an earthquake was, tectonic plates and all. \\u201cI was at work and Evan, Baptiste and their mom, Laurence, my wife before your mommy, were at home.\\u201d\", \"When the shaking started, Andy explained, they couldn\\u2019t make it out of the building before it collapsed, and the three of them died.\", \"I tensed to see if the boys would be scared or surprised, or if it would even register.\", \"\\u201cWhat does collapse mean?\\u201d one asked.\", \"\\u201cLook there\\u2019s a fish!\\u201d said the other, pointing.\", \"Andy carefully answered all their questions, then took a deep breath and said, \\u201cLet\\u2019s go for a swim.\\u201d\", \"We put on bathing suits and hopped into the cold water, the boys splashing behind rocks and laughing. They didn\\u2019t seem to absorb the gravity of the loss, or how brave their father was. It probably struck them as just another story.\", \"Back home, we took the photos of Evan, Baptiste and Laurence from our shelves, introducing the boys to the faces they had always seen around the apartment. In the coming weeks, Andy shared details about them that I realized he had been carrying alone this whole time.\", \"Soon Andy began working memories of his first family into our everyday lives. \\u201cEvan and Baptiste loved this book,\\u201d he would say before settling in for a bedtime story that he had read our boys countless times. Or as we gathered on the couch to watch a movie, he would tell us that this was Evan and Baptiste\\u2019s favorite.\", \"\\u201cDid they get scared too?\\u201d one of the twins asked.\", \"\\u201cSure they did.\\u201d\", \"One summer evening as we walked home from the park, the boys tugged excitedly at our hands, pulling us this way and that, until Andy pulled his hand away from their incessant yanking. Then he immediately flinched and put his hand out again, later saying to me, \\u201cI get so mad at myself for doing that.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhy?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBecause I would give anything to hold their hands again.\\u201d\", \"As in that instance, I sometimes overlook how his interactions with us are shaped by regret over things he wishes he had done differently, and his sorrow over things he wishes he still could do. But they are also shaped by the realization that today he has another chance.\", \"I often think about Andy\\u2019s former wife \\u2014 I am older than she was when she died at 40 \\u2014 and how she was robbed of so much life. It shouldn\\u2019t have surprised me when the boys did the same about their half brothers.\", \"After losing his first tooth, one of the twins asked, \\u201cDid Baptiste ever lose a tooth?\\u201d And they would tell their friends over lunch about how Evan pronounced butter \\u201cbuller.\\u201d When they turned 5, they wanted to know if Baptiste ever had a 5th birthday party, and they began asking more often for details about what happened, trying to understand. But so much of what happened isn\\u2019t understandable.\", \"\\u201cWhy did your house break, Daddy?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhy were they at home and you weren\\u2019t?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhy didn\\u2019t your office fall down?\\u201d\", \"These questions had haunted Andy for years, but when they come from the mouths of his innocently curious children, he tells me that he can face them more easily, which has helped relieve his lingering guilt. One day they may ask about his despair, and perhaps he will explain the many dimensions of his grief. For now, getting through the facts is enough.\", \"One morning after one of the boys\\u2019 friends slept over, we all sat down for pancakes when the friend noticed a framed picture of Evan and Baptiste on a seesaw and said, \\u201cWhen were you there?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s not us,\\u201d one of the twins said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s Daddy\\u2019s other sons, Evan and Baptiste. They died in the earthquake in Haiti when their building fell on them.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOh, like when the bear got smushed by the rocks in that cartoon,\\u201d the friend said. He was only 5 \\u2014 what other reference could he possibly have?\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not a cartoon,\\u201d our son said. \\u201cIt was real. And it\\u2019s not funny.\\u201d\", \"I had thought the gravity was lost on him and his brother, but he understood. And for the first time, Andy didn\\u2019t have to take a deep breath and muster the strength to tell the story yet again. His son had done it for him.\", \"This year, the night before the earthquake anniversary, Andy was feeling low, his attention elsewhere while cooking dinner.\", \"\\u201cWhat\\u2019s wrong, Daddy?\\u201d asked our older twin.\", \"\\u201cTomorrow is the anniversary of the earthquake,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo I\\u2019m thinking of Baptiste, Evan and Laurence.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cTomorrow there will be an earthquake?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cNo baby, tomorrow\\u2019s just the anniversary. And I\\u2019m sad.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOh,\\u201d our son said, then quickly added, \\u201cBut lucky too, Daddy.\\u201d\", \"Andy looked up. \\u201cLucky?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cLucky you found us.\\u201d His voice was high and his head tilted, as if asking.\", \"Andy looked at me with disbelief. Our boy might not have understood the meaning of an anniversary, but he could comprehend the idea of renewal.\", \"Andy scooped him up in his arms. \\u201cYes, my boy,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI am the luckiest.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"de8b0e13597911ec9d7faddb0b9babe9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"de8b0e13597911ec9d7faddb0b9babe9"}},
