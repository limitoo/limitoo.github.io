She testified in court Tuesday that the alleged abuse made \\\"my heart sink into my stomach\\\" when talking about her encounter with Jeffrey Epstein.\", \"During the cross examination, Maxwell's attorney Laura Menninger said the FBI had documents from 2019 and 2020 that didn't match up with what the witness was saying in court.\", \"Menninger said the documents claimed that Jane told the FBI her memory was \\\"foggy\\\" and she wasn't sure if Maxwell ever touched her or was there when Epstein assaulted her.\", \"Jane responded at one point during the cross examination that she doesn't recall what the FBI had written down.\", \"During her testimony, she described the first time she was allegedly abused by Epstein and said she was \\\"frozen in fear.\\\"\", \"She said she never changed her story and that her statements were never recorded.\", \"\\\"This was just someone jotting down notes. ...

That contradicted her testimony about alleged encounters with Epstein.\", \"She challenged the accuracy of the documents, saying her statements were never recorded.\", \"At another point, she responded, \\\"I don't recall saying what's written here.\\\"\", \"She did not dispute other documents saying she had named several \\\"model types\\\" and other women she said witnessed participating in group massages with Epstein. She also confirmed telling the FBI she once flew on a private jet with Britain's Prince Andrew.\", \"Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to charges that prosecutors say show that she and Epstein were \\\"partners in crime.\\\" The defense has countered by claiming she's being made a scapegoat for 66-year-old Epstein, who killed himself in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019 as he awaited his own sex trafficking trial.\", \"On Tuesday, the accuser described numerous sexual encounters with Maxwell and Epstein that began in 1994 and continued through 1997.\", \"Another time, she said she was taken to a massage room where he and Maxwell both took advantage of her. Other encounters involved sex toys or turned into oral sex \\\"orgies\\\" with other young women and Maxwell, she added.\", \"On cross examination, the defense has also attacked the witness's credibility by asking why she waited over 20 years to report the alleged abuse by Maxwell to law enforcement.
