Families have been forced to buy their own bottled water, or simply drink the contaminated water if they cannot afford to purchase it, which has been linked to gastrointestinal infections, whooping cough, pneumonia and skin diseases on the reserves, according to the court records.\", \"\\u201cCanada\\u2019s failure to provide safe drinking water has resulted in deep frustration and relationships being tainted by mistrust,\\u201d Paul Favel, the federal court judge, wrote in his Dec. 22 ruling, calling the settlement a \\u201cturning point for Canada and First Nations.\\u201d\", \"Chief Emily Whetung, a lawyer who leads the Curve Lake First Nation in Ontario, said this settlement won\\u2019t help all affected Indigenous communities, especially those who experience intermittent water contamination or those served entirely by private wells. But she relished the achievements of the settlement.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m just so thrilled,\\u201d said Chief Whetung. \\u201cNow that we\\u2019ve turned this corner, we can keep going down this road and ensure that we get access to clean drinking water for all First Nations.\\u201d\", \"While the settlement was seen as a victory for Indigenous communities, it could also prove to be a political liability for Mr. Trudeau, whose rivals in the recent federal election campaign regularly criticized his government\\u2019s failure to fulfill its promise to eliminate long-term boil-water advisories.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a problem for his credibility,\\u201d said Doug McArthur, a professor emeritus in public policy at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia. \\u201cI think he\\u2019s going to want to try to use this to show now he will deliver, although it\\u2019s an embarrassment, again, because it\\u2019s gone through the courts.\\u201d\", \"The settlement of 8 billion Canadian dollars, or $6.2 billion, was reached in about two years and was the product of two national class-action lawsuits heard concurrently by the Federal Court of Canada and the Court of Queen\\u2019s Bench of Manitoba, the first time the federal court and another superior court have presided over a case together, according to the decision.\", \"On Thursday, the federal government issued a statement saying it looked \\u201cforward to implementing this historic settlement.\\u201d\", \"The approval of the settlement comes just a few weeks after the federal government announced it was committing 40 billion dollars for compensation of residential school survivors and for addressing discrimination against Indigenous children who receive social services.\", \"Curve Lake, an Ojibway First Nation that was pivotal in bringing the civil suit to the federal court, is about 20 miles north of Peterborough, Ontario, a city of over 82,000 residents. But it is not connected to that city\\u2019s water plant. Instead, 140 of its 700 members on the reserve are serviced by a small water treatment plant built by the federal government in the early 1980s, and face regular short-term boil-water advisories. The rest of the community are served by private wells that are vulnerable to contamination.\", \"When the province of Ontario carried out an inspection in 2017, it found the treatment plant wasn\\u2019t disinfecting water to the province\\u2019s safety standards, according to court records. But the federal government, which is responsible for services on reserves, examined the plant and deemed it \\u201clow risk.\\u201d The discrepancy between these two assessments, and a chance conversation between a few legal minds on the reserve, helped galvanize the community to move forward with a civil claim.\", \"They were joined by Neskantaga First Nation, a fly-in community in Ontario that has the country\\u2019s longest boil water advisory of 25 years. Soon afterward, another lawsuit was filed by Tataskweyak Cree Nation in Manitoba.\", \"Under the agreed settlement, up to 258 First Nation communities that were ordered for more than a year to boil water will be eligible for damages of at least 500,000 dollars each.\", \"It also includes a 400 million dollar economic and cultural restoration fund, and a commitment from the government to repeal and replace existing First Nations drinking water legislation with laws that they believe will more fairly allocate funding for water treatment.\", \"The settlement also implements a dispute resolution process that empowers reserve communities to hold the government accountable to its new commitments and timelines.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s a radically different arrangement from the way things are done today, where this idea of delivering safe drinking water is a political promise,\\u201d Michael Rosenberg, one of the lawyers representing the First Nations, said in an interview earlier this month. Currently, he said, \\u201cit depends on the political will of the government of the day.\\u201d\", \"As of Dec. 17, according to the ministry\\u2019s data, 29 communities are facing 38 long-term boil-water orders, and 124 such advisories have been lifted since November 2015. As some are resolved, others have been identified.\"]","href_hash":"3580513e657111ec9711bdb7587b3a92"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3580513e657111ec9711bdb7587b3a92"}},
