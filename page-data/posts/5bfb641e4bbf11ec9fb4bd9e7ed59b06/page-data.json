The government leaders and EU officials announced that Monday that a return to pre-COVID days is still out of the question, and that some of the peaceful protests that turned violent were counterproductive.\", \"And for those who turned the protests into violent riots, Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte simply called them \\\"idiots.\\\"\", \"The protests started after the fourth wave of infections began locking down Austrians and forcing COVID-19 restraints in many European nations. Citizens are limited with new restrictions, which do not allow things such as working in offices and drinking at bars.\", \"The civil unrest also comes from discontent with politicians who had promised that with vaccinations, freedom would come. As the delta variant brought on rising infection numbers, the EU governments decided to re-impose regulations and restrict non-vaccinated individuals.\", \"\\\"Not able to work where you want work, to be where you want to be. That's not what we stand for, that's not freedom,\\\" said Eveline Denayer, who was at Sunday's march in Brussels, which drew a crowd of over 35,000.\", \"\\\"We live in Western Europe and we just want to be free, how we were before,\\\" she said.\", \"Protest marches from Zagreb to Rome and from Vienna to Brussels and Rotterdam gathered crowds of tens of thousands, some turning violent because of the new lockdown measures.\", \"Friday night, police in Rotterdam used live fire to disperse rioters and four people suffered gunshot wounds at the riots.

Please, let us not get incited by a small group which would turn it into a fight against one another,\\\" said Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo.\", \"The Dutch violence came a week into a new partial lockdown in the Netherlands and after an announcement that the government was banning fireworks on New Year's Eve in an effort to ease the strain on hospital emergency rooms.\", \"\\\"Of course, we see that the constraints with which we have been living for almost two years can be tiresome,\\\" said EU stokesperson Dana Spinant.\", \"\\\"But it's important from a community level to stick together and to follow those restrictions because that's the way out of the pandemic,\\\" she said.\", \"The EU pointed out that scientific evidence shows that increased vaccinations would contain the crisis and avoid more deaths.\", \"\\\"You know the three words very well \\u2014 vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate,\\\" said spokesperson Stefan De Keersmaecker.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931782/netherlands-prime-minister-mark-rutte.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Friday night, police in Rotterdam used live fire to disperse rioters and four people suffered gunshot wounds at the riots.
