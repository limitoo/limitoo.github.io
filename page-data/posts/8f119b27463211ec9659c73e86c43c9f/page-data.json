A lot. \\u201cThe whole time, I was wondering, well, when are we actually going to put bodies back into real places at real times?\\u201d she said in a recent interview. \\u201cAnd it was not possible until relatively very recently.\\u201d\", \"She wasn\\u2019t referring to bubbles, she said, but to the flood of performances that have made this fall season feel almost as robust as any other. But even before anyone could have predicted that, she was determined to put on a show. And so at 80, Tharp used what she had: a milestone birthday.\", \"\\u201cWe leveraged my age into an evening,\\u201d she said, laughing. \\u201cYou know, I have no shame. Whatever it takes. That\\u2019s what I did. Nothing new there.\\u201d\", \"What is new is the program she has created. While Tharp has presented evenings of work over the past few years, none have felt as poignant and sharp, as charming and as wise in their blending of past and present, as \\u201cTwyla Now,\\u201d which she will unveil at New York City Center beginning Wednesday. It\\u2019s the right dances, the right dancers, the right time.\", \"The cast includes members of Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, American Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet, along with six ensemble dancers, ages 14 to 21, who represent the future to Tharp \\u2014 as all young dancers do. She found them on the internet. When Savannah Kristich, a competition dancer and the youngest, received an email from Tharp out of the blue, she basically packed her bag right then and there. \\u201cShe\\u2019s a living legend,\\u201d said Kristich, who lives in Las Vegas. \\u201cShe changed dance history.\\u201d\", \"Kristich, wild yet precise, has a Tharpian bent to her dancing. She likes to feel free. She knows a lot of younger dancers worry about what they look like to others when they\\u2019re moving; not her. \\u201cI do what I think is fitting me, and she\\u2019s a huge inspiration on that,\\u201d Kristich said of Tharp.\", \"The younger cast join the professionals in the program\\u2019s last dance, \\u201cAll In,\\u201d a premiere set to Brahms, in which moments from the show\\u2019s previous works \\u2014 three duets \\u2014 float in and out like slivers of phantom choreography. Phrases from the past mingle with those from the present in a feat of structural counterpoint.\", \"It\\u2019s a Tharp signature, but it\\u2019s also her way of saying the past and the present are equal entities. \\u201cI\\u2019d be sort of bare in a way just trying to start out anew,\\u201d she said, \\u201cwithout referencing, without using the foundation that I already have.\\u201d\", \"For the program, she starts with works she already has \\u2014 sort of. The first of the three is the most straightforward: the lively \\u201cCornbread,\\u201d a 2014 duet, danced by Tiler Peck and Roman Mejia of New York City Ballet and set to music by the string band Carolina Chocolate Drops. It\\u2019s a virtuosic display of daring speed and glittering musicality.\", \"\\u201cEverybody\\u2019s going to go, she\\u2019s crazy,\\u201d Tharp said. \\u201cThat was the end, wasn\\u2019t it? When do we open with the end? What do you do next?\\u201d\", \"The answer comes in a pair of dances that revive vintage choreography in fresh ways. For the new \\u201cSecond Duet,\\u201d danced by James Gilmer and Jacquelin Harris of Ailey, Tharp unearthed improvisations she performed with Kevin O\\u2019Day in 1991 when she was devoted to weight training.\", \"Set to music by Thomas Larcher, \\u201cSecond Duet\\u201d requires superhuman strength and trust: a display of lifts and dips that the dancers seem to be inventing on the spot. In overhead balances, the woman, far from passive, relies on the strength in her upper back to hold her weight. You see the effort and the struggle, but there\\u2019s also something else at play.\", \"For Tharp, after the elite athleticism of \\u201cCornbread,\\u201d the new dance \\u201cshows what it takes to be a human,\\u201d she said. \\u201cTrying to identify yourself in relation to another person is what this whole duet is about \\u2014 and is, in fact, what all duets are about.\\u201d\", \"Gilmer and Harris have spent months learning the movement from archival footage. It begins as something of a battle and becomes more playful over time \\u2014 but also more vulnerable as the dancers continue their conversation through falling and catching, support and control \\u2014 tenants of modern dance. \\u201cIt\\u2019s tearing down walls and taking off layers to be your most honest self,\\u201d Harris said.\", \"\\u201cPergolesi\\u201d is a different sort of experiment. For it, Tharp has taken a duet that she choreographed for herself and Mikhail Baryshnikov in 1992, and set it on Robbie Fairchild, a former City Ballet principal and Tony-nominated lead for the Broadway musical \\u201cAn American in Paris,\\u201d and Sara Mearns, a City Ballet principal known for stretching herself far beyond ballet. (During the program, Mearns performs in jazz shoes, pointe shoes and ballet slippers \\u2014 an athletic tour de force, says Tharp.)\", \"There are twists. One is that they are learning the dance \\u2014 which was never performed exactly the same way \\u2014 from a video of one specific performance. The other is that Fairchild will be dancing Tharp\\u2019s part while Mearns takes on Baryshnikov\\u2019s.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s the return of the ghosts, right?\\u201d Tharp said at a recent rehearsal while surveying Fairchild and Mearns.\", \"At first, the prospect of becoming one of those ghosts \\u2014 Baryshnikov \\u2014 was daunting to Mearns. \\u201cI was like, what?\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no way I can do that. Let\\u2019s just be honest here. Nobody can be Misha. Nobody. He is one in a lifetime. But then again, you know me: I\\u2019m never going to say no.\\u201d\", \"In the duet \\u2014 competitive, playful, arduous \\u2014 the two dancers never touch. \\u201cIt is androgynous in a way,\\u201d Mearns said. \\u201cWhen you watch the performance video, it\\u2019s not male, female. It\\u2019s two insanely independent human beings doing their thing.\\u201d\", \"She doesn\\u2019t look at Tharp when she studies the video, only Baryshnikov, whose \\u201cabundance of strength was unlike any other,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe was so grounded and nothing was ever off. It was like he was straight on all the time. There was no wavering back and forth, or arms flying around. And it was hard for him to not be on it. My favorite place to be is off\\u201d \\u2014 that is, she likes to fall away from a balance, to turn a seemingly fixed position into a motion.\", \"For his part, Fairchild feels kinship with Tharp. As he put it, \\u201cWe\\u2019re in the ballet world, but we like to jazz it up.\\u201d\", \"In the duet, he senses his physicality changing as soon as he begins to dance; shrinking his torso, he tries to become her. \\u201cIt\\u2019s fun to also think about who she is \\u2014 as a trailblazer, as a female choreographer in a world of men,\\u201d Fairchild said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s this little firecracker who was just out to stick it to the man, dancing next to the greatest ballet dancer of all time. The world that she created for herself was hard-earned.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cPergolesi\\u201d is painstaking work. In one solo, Fairchild performs Tharp\\u2019s improvised version of what she just watched Baryshnikov dance; in another, Mearns references roles from Baryshnikov\\u2019s classical repertory, and that expands the gender experiment even further: Here, she\\u2019s not only dancing a man\\u2019s part, she\\u2019s dancing male parts from the classical ballet canon.\", \"It can get confusing. During a rehearsal, Fairchild was stuck. \\u201cWhat are we saying here?\\u201d he asked Tharp about a lower-than-usual energy moment.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re saying stall,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThe guy\\u2019s exhausted.\\u201d\", \"The guy is Mearns \\u2014 meaning Baryshnikov. At this point, he\\u2019s dead. \\u201cYou come in and you actually have the tiniest tad of compassion. Very small! But you have a tiny touch of compassion here.\\u201d\", \"Mearns howled with laughter. She loves how in the dance, Tharp \\u2014 now Fairchild \\u2014 has the last say. \\u201cI finish and I think she\\u2019s going to finish, but then she keeps going,\\u201d Mearns said later. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s just so her, right? She\\u2019s like, this is my dance, I made this.\\u201d\", \"While demonstrating another view of partnering \\u2014 in many ways, the program is a study of that, too \\u2014 \\u201cPergolesi\\u201d is part of a bigger picture: the diversity that exists within Tharp\\u2019s vision. \\u201cYou work your way back and forth between all of these disparities: racial diversity, sexual diversity, gender, stylistic, and you get to a common point,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd that, to me, has always been a big part of what the dances do. They are a societal statement of possibility, of inclusion.\\u201d\", \"How do we understand and see things? When many different styles of dance live together on a stage \\u2014 Tharp was the first choreographer to make a crossover ballet, mixing ballet with modern dance \\u2014 what is created? That boils down to her message of the evening and what she\\u2019s been trying to say from the start, when in the 1970s she worked intimately with a group of women of varying sizes and shapes, with different dance backgrounds and from different cultures.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s all about community,\\u201d she said. \\u201cEach one of the dances is my hope for a perfect world where people can actually correspond, communicate, grow together, work together, respect together. And the more diversity, the broader the spectrum, the happier the world. What else is new here? This is what dance does.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8f119b27463211ec9659c73e86c43c9f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8f119b27463211ec9659c73e86c43c9f"}},
