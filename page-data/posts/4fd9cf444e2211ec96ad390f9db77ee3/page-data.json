Australian police officers arrive in the country to help quell rioting.\", \"Protests in the capital Honiara quickly spiralled out of the control of local police, with arson and looting in the Chinatown district and the city centre, and crowds threatening to disrupt parliament.\", \"A mixture of grievances have fuelled the protests, but the government's decision in 2019 to switch diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China is the main source of the conflict.\", \"Speaking to the ABC from Honiara, Prime Minister Manasseh Sogavare stood by the decision to terminate diplomatic relations with Taipei, despite fierce and sustained criticism.\", \"\\\"That decision is a correct decision, it is legal, it puts Solomon Islands on the right side of history and it is in line with international law,\\\" he said.\", \"The Malaita Province, the most populous island of the archipelago, has maintained connections with Taipei in defiance of the central government.\", \"\\\"I feel sorry for my people in Malaita because they are fed with false and deliberate lies about the switch,\\\" Mr Sogavare said.\", \"<img

conflict.\", \"\\\"That's the only issue, the only issue, and unfortunately, it is influenced and encouraged by other powers,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"These very countries that are now influencing Malaita are the countries that don't want ties with the People's Republic of China and they are discouraging Solomon Islands to enter into diplomatic relations and to comply with international law and the United Nations resolution.\\\"\", \"\\\"I don't want to name names, we'll leave it there, we know who they are,\\\" he said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Prime Minister thanks 'best friend'

any position on the internal issues of the Solomon Islands.\\\"\", \"The deployment follows the long-running Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), a peace-keeping mission that began
