Boone was one of the five white officers charged in the September 17, 2017, beating, although Boone's attorneys argued that he did not participate in the initial beating.

Richard Webber to give him 26 months. Prosecutors had sought a 10-year sentence.\", \"According to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, the sentence appeared to stun Hall along with his relatives and his supporters, who walked out of the courtroom before Webber finished announcing the sentence.
