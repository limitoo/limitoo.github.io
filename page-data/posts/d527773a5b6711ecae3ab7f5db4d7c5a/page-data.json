The Met, which since the start of its season has required all who enter to be vaccinated, de facto banned children under 12, who were not eligible for vaccines.\", \"When eligibility expanded at the end of October, though, the door was open for kids to come back. And they did on Friday, to Julie Taymor\\u2019s fantastical production \\u2014 trimmed to just under two intermissionless hours and performed in J.D. McClatchy\\u2019s snappy English adaptation.\", \"The performance boasted a winning cast and glowing playing from the orchestra, led with elegance and insight by Jane Glover. I\\u2019ve long been in the minority in finding Taymor\\u2019s stylized, puppet-filled staging overly busy \\u2014 too inventive for its own good. But the audience applauded each scenic touch and stage trick, including some children near me, though there seemed not that many of them in attendance overall. (The company is also offering an abridged, English-language version of Massenet\\u2019s \\u201cCinderella,\\u201d which opens on Friday.)\", \"From the melting love aria that Prince Tamino sings early on, the tenor Matthew Polenzani \\u2014 who sang the role at this staging\\u2019s premiere in 2004 \\u2014 was in warm, ardent voice. When the questing Tamino exchanges questions with the Speaker (the robust bass-baritone Patrick Carfizzi), who oversees the entrance to a temple of wisdom, Polenzani\\u2019s heated earnestness lent the scene dark intensity. And his English diction was a model of clarity.\", \"Pamina, with whom Tamino falls in love, was sung beautifully by the plush-voiced soprano Hera Hyesang Park. Pamina\\u2019s mother, the Queen of the Night, was the soprano Kathryn Lewek, who dispatched her florid leaps and super-high notes with fearless brilliance. The powerful bass Morris Robinson made an imposing yet trustworthy Sarastro, the spiritual leader of the temple.\", \"In a bold move, the tenor Rolando Villaz\\u00f3n sang Papageno, the hapless bird catcher \\u2014 traditionally a baritone role. In a recent interview with The New York Times, Villaz\\u00f3n, a star since the early 2000s, was candid about the vocal troubles and mental setbacks that almost led him to retire in recent years. He said in the interview that he believed his voice was mended. But on Friday, his low range was weak and patchy, and even his higher notes had trouble carrying in the house.\", \"Still, he sang honestly and energetically, and brought a charming blend of comedic antics and wistful yearning to his portrayal of this bumptious character who yearns for love \\u2014 and finds it, eventually, with Papagena, here the sunny soprano Ashley Emerson.\", \"On the podium, Glover balanced warmth and brightness, breadth and high spirits, and rightly received an enthusiastic ovation. When she made her Met debut in 2013 in this holiday \\u201cMagic Flute,\\u201d she was just the third woman to conduct at the company. This current run is her first time back.\", \"Glover has worked with the Royal Opera and the Glyndebourne Festival in England, the Berlin State Opera, the Royal Danish Opera and other major houses. Isn\\u2019t it time for the Met to utilize her full capabilities?\"]","href_hash":"d527773a5b6711ecae3ab7f5db4d7c5a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d527773a5b6711ecae3ab7f5db4d7c5a"}},
