Golden also stood by his vote against the COVID package.\", \"\\\"I don't think people should accept things like this as the price of doing business,\\\" he said.\", \"His recent opposition toward these bills has resulted in some party members calling him a \\\"Democrat in Name Only\\\" or a \\\"DINO.\\\" However, he dismissed these accusations, saying that he's worried for the future of the Democratic party if they are unable to hold their congressional majorities during the midterm elections.\", \"Regarding the Build Back Better bill, he said that 88 percent of millionaires would get a tax break of approximately $17,000. Meanwhile, little more than 1 percent of benefits would go to people making less than $100,000 per year. Golden maintained that Democrats shouldn't support that, regardless of the party the current president is in.\", \"\\\"Sometimes the truth hurts,\\\" he said.\", \"The Build Back Better bill is expected to be revised when it reaches the Senate.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937001/infrastructure-golden.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">U.S. Representative Jared Golden shrugged off criticism for voting against President Joe Biden's Build Back Better bill. Golden walks through the U.S. Capitol building on November 5 in Washington, D.C.</div>\", \"Golden said the March COVID package was \\\"too big, too fast\\\" and contributed to creeping inflation.\", \"It's all part of a delicate political balancing act for Golden, a Marine Corps veteran who serves an increasingly conservative district in rural Maine. His district, which covers almost four-fifths of Maine's land area, voted for former President Donald Trump in 2020 even as it sent Golden to Congress for a second term. Republicans have made it a top target as they try to win back the House in next year's election.\", \"His decision to break ranks on Biden's bill attracted some Twitter scorn Friday.\", \"He said his opposition to Biden's bill centered on the state and local tax deduction, where a $10,000 cap would be raised to $80,000. People making under $100,000 would get back $20 or $30 under the provision, he said.\", \"He said he expects those negotiations will produce a final version of the bill that he can support.\", \"Golden noted that Biden has vowed for months that the overall proposal would be funded by rich people who don't pay their share in taxes.\", \"\\\"We need to deliver on that,\\\" he said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937003/ap-golden.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">U.S. Representative Jared Golden on November 19 voted against an expansive social and environment bill that President Joe Biden hailed as \\u201canother giant step forward\\u201d for the country.
