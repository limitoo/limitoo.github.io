Those  actions have undermined hopes for averting a conflict that could cause  massive casualties, energy shortages on the European continent and economic chaos  around the globe.\", \"The  U.S. and European Union condemned Russia and prepared to hit back with  sanctions. On Tuesday, Germany suspended the approval process for the  Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring Russian natural gas to Europe.\", \"Western powers have feared Russia might use skirmishes in Ukraine's   eastern regions as a pretext for an attack on the former Soviet state, which has   defied Moscow's attempts to pull it back into its orbit. \", \"Putin on Monday claimed that Ukraine's modern borders were put into being by the USSR and said that Russian troops in Luhansk and Donetsk were necessary to protect the rights of Russian-speaking people in the region.
