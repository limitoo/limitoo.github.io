Instead of editing and writing, she would recruit employees, mentor staff members and lead events, among other duties.\", \"The retractions echoed an episode at WNYC in February, when the reporter Fred Mogul was fired for using language from another news organization without proper attribution. Mr. Mogul, a health care reporter who worked at WNYC for 18 years, submitted an article to his editor at Gothamist that contained a paragraph from an article published by The Associated Press.\", \"Mr. Mogul disputed the firing, saying he had given proper credit to The A.P. Shortly after the firing, more than 60 WNYC employees signed a letter in support of Mr. Mogul, calling the decision a \\u201ctroubling precedent.\\u201d In May, he filed a lawsuit accusing WNYC and Ms. Cooper of defamation.\", \"In the suit, Mr. Mogul said that he gave credit to The A.P. in a line at the end of his copy, in keeping with what had been a common practice at WNYC. A lawyer for Mr. Mogul declined to comment, referring an inquiry to the legal complaint. WNYC has called the lawsuit \\u201cmeritless.\\u201d\", \"The SAG-AFTRA union, which represents WNYC journalists, has also sued the station, accusing it of denying Mr. Mogul severance and refusing to arbitrate the dispute.\", \"In a staff meeting that took place shortly after he was fired, Ms. Cooper told employees that WNYC had a \\u201czero-tolerance policy\\u201d against using unattributed language from other news outlets, according to a recording of the meeting that was shared with The Times.\", \"During last week\\u2019s Zoom videoconference, one employee asked Ms. Cooper if WNYC no longer had a zero-tolerance policy against using language from work by other news outlets. A second person asked the editor to explain the difference between the latest instance of a reporter borrowing text and Mr. Mogul\\u2019s case. Ms. Cooper defended how the station had approached both cases, saying it had made its decisions on how to handle them after careful consideration.\", \"In an interview for this article, Ms. Cooper said, \\u201cThese cases were handled differently because they are extremely different cases.\\u201d\", \"WNYC, which has more than a million weekly listeners for its AM and FM stations, has gone through significant staff turnover in the last year. Fourteen journalists have resigned or been terminated from a staff of more than 150 editorial employees. In April, the station laid off four people who worked in the newsroom.\", \"SAG-AFTRA filed an unfair labor practice complaint with the National Labor Relations Board, accusing WNYC of retaliating against a shop steward who was among the employees laid off. A spokeswoman for the station said that WNYC \\u201cnever has and never will make a personnel decision based on retaliation.\\u201d\", \"Workplace morale has been low, said a dozen current and former staff members, most of whom spoke for this article on condition of anonymity to discuss internal issues.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t want to leave,\\u201d Jim O\\u2019Grady, a reporter who left WNYC last month after 11 years, said in an interview. \\u201cBut I felt like I had to, because for the most part it\\u2019s no longer a place of collaboration, collegiality and mutual respect.\\u201d\", \"When Ms. Cooper started at WNYC in 2020, after five years as the editor in chief of The San Francisco Chronicle, she stepped into a volatile workplace.
