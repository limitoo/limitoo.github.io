When the parole hearing began on Jan. 18, he entered the courtroom and made a Nazi-style salute. He also carried and wore signs emblazoned with racist messages, including one that read \\u201cStop your genocide against our white nations.\\u201d\", \"Speaking to the judge, Mr. Breivik demanded that he be treated as a prisoner of war.\", \"Judge Dag Bjorvik oversaw the parole hearing, which lasted for two weeks and was held at Skien prison for security reasons.\", \"Mr. Breivik\\u2019s lawyer, Oystein Storrvik, confirmed that they would appeal the verdict, after expressing pessimism at the start of the hearing. \\u201cNo Norwegian lawyer wants a case to begin with a Hitler salute,\\u201d he said in an interview with The Times last month. He said he was not particularly concerned with Mr. Breivik winning his parole, adding that his long-term strategy was to \\u201cimprove the conditions under which he is sitting\\u201d in prison.\", \"On July 22, 2011, Mr. Breivik detonated a fertilizer bomb in downtown Oslo, killing eight people. He then went on a shooting rampage at a summer camp on the island of Utoya, killing 69 people, most of them teenagers. The camp was organized by the youth arm of the country\\u2019s center-left Labor Party.\", \"The judgment said Mr. Breivik \\u201cverbally expressed grief over those affected \\u2014 but at the same time, he defended and possibly legitimized his actions by saying that most of those affected on Utoya were not children, but people with \\u2018leadership positions.\\u2019 This despite the fact that he must know that among those killed were children as young as 14 years old.\\u201d\", \"At the start of the parole hearing, Hulda Karlsdottir, the lead prosecutor, said that Mr. Breivik should remain in prison and that he would \\u201cremain dangerous after serving his sentence.\\u201d\", \"She added: \\u201cBoth the survivors and relatives alike are left with bottomless grief, and the atrocities committed are unparalleled in Norwegian history.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Breivik, who legally changed his name to Fjotolf Hansen in 2017, said he had carried out the attack as part of a violent campaign against a Muslim invasion of Europe, which he said was contributing to the country\\u2019s \\u201ccultural suicide.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Breivik was convicted on terrorism and murder charges in 2012 and sentenced to 21 years in prison, the maximum under Norwegian law. The sentence can be extended indefinitely if he is deemed a continued threat to society.\", \"The parole hearing, revived memories of the most horrific crime in modern Norwegian history, and showcased the extremist views of the country\\u2019s neo-Nazi fringe. \", \"In past court appearances, Mr. Breivik has betrayed little emotion when recounting his deeds. His crimes, which he detailed in a sprawling 1,500 page tract discovered after the attacks, have since influenced right-wing extremists around the world, including an American white nationalist, Christopher Paul Hasson, who was indicted on federal gun and drug charges and accused of plotting to commit mass murder.\", \"Mr. Breivik last appeared before Norwegian and European courts in 2016 to argue that his long-term solitary confinement amounted to torture. He is being held in a three-room suite that includes a treadmill, a refrigerator, a television with a DVD player and a Sony PlayStation. He has also threatened to go on a hunger strike.\", \"Lisbeth Kristine Royneland, a spokeswoman for the families of victims and survivors of the attacks, said she had worried that Mr. Breivik would use the hearing as a platform to expose his brand of violent extremism. \\u201cThere should be as little focus as possible on the terrorist and his message,\\u201d said Ms. Royneland, whose daughter Synne Royneland was killed during the attack on Utoya.\", \"Pal Grondahl, a forensic psychologist in Oslo who has followed the case, said in an interview that Mr. Breivik seemed \\u201cto be very much the Breivik we saw both in 2012 and 2016.\\u201d He added: \\u201cBased on his behavior so far, he appears to be seeking attention without empathy, and he has some grand illusions about himself.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f336bcd0837711ecab9f3f2a68d347b9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f336bcd0837711ecab9f3f2a68d347b9"}},
