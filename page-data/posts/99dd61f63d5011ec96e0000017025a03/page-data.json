Now negotiators must hunker down to turn pledges into reality.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-04T01:22:07.000Z","content":"[\"GLASGOW \\u2014 Presidents and prime ministers have left town. Now the hard work starts, with diplomats hunkering in a cavernous tent complex at the U.N. climate talks here for the next week and a half to hammer out deals to cut emissions that are warming the planet. \", \"More nations than ever before are pledging to reduce emissions, move away from coal, eliminate deforestation and deliver money to help poor countries adapt. Environmental groups and poor nations aren\\u2019t as optimistic. They have seen promises come and go before. \", \"Here are five takeaways from the early, frenetic days of the climate conference:\", \"More than 39,000 people are registered for the summit. One problem: Capacity in the main venue is limited to 10,000 people because of Covid restrictions.\", \"That has led to bottlenecks, long security lines and frustration, especially among civil society groups who were already angry that the U.N. had capped their presence inside the negotiating halls.\", \"Everyone entering the venue, known as the \\u201cblue zone,\\u201d is asked to take a daily rapid coronavirus test. But for all the talk of strict controls, participants have to report their results. It\\u2019s basically an honor system.\", \"For nearly four years, the United States worked to undermine the progress of climate talks. Former President Donald J. Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement and vowed to burn more, not less, gas, oil and coal.\", \"President Biden on Monday arrived in Glasgow and flipped the script. He promised to show the world that the United States is \\u201cleading by the power of our example.\\u201d \", \"Asked about the leaders of other countries, particularly China and Russia, who did not attend, Mr. Biden said, \\u201cWe showed up.\\u201d\", \"The fact that President Xi Jinping of China, Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and Jair Bolsonaro of Brazil did not show up turned heads.\", \"Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia did show up \\u2014 but brought an emissions target that experts said falls far short of what\\u2019s needed. Brazil pledged to end deforestation by 2028 . Activists are skeptical that Mr. Bolsonaro will follow through.\", \"Both Russia and China have targets that, experts say, are not enough to keep the planet on a relatively safe trajectory On his way out, Mr. Biden scolded Mr. Xi and Mr. Putin for not attending. Officials in Beijing hit back, noting Mr. Biden was unable to convince his own party to vote for climate legislation necessary to meet the United States\\u2019 aggressive targets.\", \"Sparring won\\u2019t solve the climate crisis. And it remains unclear whether the two biggest emitters, China and the United States, can move past tensions over trade and human rights to work together. \", \"Banks and other lenders said they have $130 trillion to finance projects that aim to get companies and countries to net-zero emissions. The number, more than five times the size of the U.S. economy, grabbed headlines. \", \"Environmentalists quickly threw cold water on it, arguing that scant details were provided and that banks still invest hundreds of billions of dollars in fossil fuels each year. \", \"Poland, Vietnam, Egypt, Chile and Morocco are among 18 countries that will pledge Thursday to phase out coal-fired generation and stop building new plants. The British hosts of the U.N. conference want to leave their mark by ensuring the end of coal \\u201cis in sight.\\u201d\", \"Yet the issue is deeply contentious. At the start of the summit, the prime minister of Fiji, Frank Bainimarama, told Mr. Morris of Australia that \\u201ccoal has no place in this century.\\u201d Mr. Morris has clearly said he won\\u2019t discuss fossil fuel mandates or bans.\", \"Expect more pushback in the coming days from Australia well as China, India and Russia to any language formalizing a phase-out of coal in any final decision from the summit.\", \"\"]","href_hash":"99dd61f63d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"99dd61f63d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}},
