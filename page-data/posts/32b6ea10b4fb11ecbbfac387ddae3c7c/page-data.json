He made it clear that without changes to stop Russia using its veto power to block Security Council action, the United Nations and the entire system of global security it represents could be rendered obsolete. The Ukrainian leader called on the U.N. to either kick Russia out, or change the Council's rules.\", \"\\\"Ukraine has the moral right to propose a reform of the world security system,\\\" he said. \\\"We have proven that we help others... now we need decisions from the Security Council for peace in Ukraine.\\\"\", \"\\\"The U.N. system must be reformed immediately so that the [Security Council] veto is not the right to die,\\\" said Zelenskyy. \\u00a0\", \"Suggesting more atrocities were yet to be revealed, he accused Russia of \\\"deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities.\\\"\", \"\\\"Now the world can see what they have done in Bucha,\\\" he told the Security Council. \\\"But the world has yet to see what Russia has done in other regions.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Russian troops are deliberately destroying Ukrainian cities to ashes with artillery and airstrikes. They are deliberately blocking cities, creating mass starvation. They deliberately shoot columns of civilians on the road trying to escape from hostilities. They even deliberately blow up shelters where civilians hide from airstrikes,\\\" Zelenskyy said.\", \"CBS News has witnessed firsthand clear evidence of atrocities in towns and villages around Ukraine's capital, Kyiv. Bodies were found littering the streets of Bucha, with scores more dumped into hastily dug mass graves.\\u00a0\", \"The gruesome scenes left behind by Vladimir Putin's invading forces have led to calls for tougher sanctions against the Kremlin, including a complete cut-off of gas and oil imports from Russia. Germany and France reacted by expelling dozens of Russian diplomats, suggesting they were spies. U.S. President Joe Biden said Putin should be tried for war crimes.\\u00a0\", \"U.N.
