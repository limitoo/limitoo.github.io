According to Schneider's written statement, the survey was conducted on October 25 and 26, with its data currently being analyzed. The Newark and Detroit offices were involved in the investigation.\", \"The search was spurred by a new tip that is just as mysterious as Hoffa's disappearance. The New York Times reported that Frank Cappola was summoned by his father Paul on his deathbed in 2008. He allegedly told his son about his involvement in the 1975 case when he worked at the PJP Landfill in Jersey City.\", \"\\\"Unidentified people brought Hoffa's dead body to PJP,\\\" Frank wrote in a 2019 statement. Because of the awkward position of Hoffa's corpse after they removed him from whatever container he was in before, they were unable to place him, feet first, in a 55-gallon steel drum retrieved at PJP. So, they put him in the drum headfirst.\\\"\", \"Paul then encouraged his son to \\\"reveal it when the time seemed right.\\\" In 2019, Frank wrote and signed a detailed report of his father's story before dying in 2020.\", \"More than 45 years have passed since Hoffa disappeared. The union head was last seen on July 30, 1975, at the Machus Red Fox restaurant in Detroit. Rumors and urban legends have revolved around his fate since his disappearance, with renewed attention after the release of Martin Scorsese's crime epic The Irishman in 2019.\", \"No further information on the survey was provided. The last search for Hoffa occurred in 2013.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936578/skyway.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The future Skyway Park, a former illegal dumping ground for toxic waste that city officials plan on transforming into a memorial park for the hundreds of thousands of Americans who have died from the COVID-19 pandemic, on February 25, 2021 in Jersey City, New Jersey.

Moldea has written extensively about the search for Hoffa.\", \"The search over the years has included various digs in rural Michigan and even the removal of floorboards at a Detroit house.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936584/jimmy-hoffa.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The decades-long odyssey to find the body of former Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa apparently has turned to a former New Jersey landfill below an elevated highway.
