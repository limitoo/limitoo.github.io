It was the culmination of a study that analyzed data from more than 300 satellites.\", \"\\u201cWe now have the emissions, for the last five years, for every large source of greenhouse gas emissions on the planet,\\u201d said Mr. Gore, whose film about climate change, \\u201cAn Inconvenient Truth,\\u201d won the 2007 Academy Award for best documentary. \\u201cBy next year, we will have that down to such a granular level that we will be able to report monthly, weekly and in a few cases daily totals from every single significant machine source everywhere in the world.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gore said he wanted to focus on the potential for new technology to help make greenhouse gas emission reporting more transparent, more timely and more accurate. At past climate conferences, he said, the discussion was based on outdated data. There are 100 countries that don\\u2019t have any emissions data that is more recent than five or even 20 years old, he said.\"]","href_hash":"d4e700323cd211ec9bdc000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d4e700323cd211ec9bdc000017025a03"}},
