But centrist and moderate Democrats grumbled that the party\\u2019s left flank had held back final passage of what they considered the most popular part of the agenda, a bipartisan $1 trillion infrastructure bill.\", \"Senator Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat who campaigned hard for Terry McAuliffe, only to see him lose, said, \\u201cWhat I heard when I was out campaigning for the ticket was, \\u2018Hey, you guys got the White House, the Senate, the House. When are you going to get more things done?\\u2019 I mean only in Washington could people think that it is a smart strategy to take a once-in-a-generation investment in infrastructure and prevent your president from signing that bill into law. And that\\u2019s somehow a good strategy?\\u201d\", \"Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, added: \\u201cWe have a proven piece of legislation in the infrastructure bill that should have been done \\u2014 we should have taken that. But you know, that\\u2019s water over the dam now.\\u201d\", \"Liberal lawmakers were not about to accept that criticism from Mr. Manchin, who continued to be the main impediment to passage of a separate $1.85 trillion social safety net and climate change bill that they want approved before giving their votes for the public works measure.\", \"But virtually all Democrats came away from the sweeping defeats in Virginia and what appeared to be a narrow escape for New Jersey\\u2019s Democratic governor, Philip Murphy, agreeing that the imperative now was to pass both bills as quickly as possible to prove their party could govern.\", \"Hanging over the endeavor was a deep sense of dread among Democrats \\u2014 reinforced by the results on Tuesday \\u2014 that their prospects for keeping control of Congress in the midterm elections next year were dwindling by the day, amid President Biden\\u2019s sagging approval rating and widespread discontent with the direction of the country.\", \"\\u201cThe No. 1 concern voters have raised with me over the last several weeks has been inability of Congress and government in general to get things done at a time of great need for the country,\\u201d Representative Tom Malinowski, a Democrat in a swing district in New Jersey. \\u201cSo the best thing we can do in Congress is to pass these damned bills, immediately.\\u201d\", \"To that end, Speaker Nancy Pelosi ordered the House Rules Committee on Wednesday to take up and approve a final draft of the social policy and climate bill by day\\u2019s end. And she injected a twist that indicated that Democrats were in no mood to pull back on their ambitious agenda in response to the disappointing election results, asking the committee to add back in four weeks of paid family and medical leave that had been removed at Mr. Manchin\\u2019s insistence.\", \"That was a break from her stated policy of only bringing before the House a bill that she knew could pass the Senate, where Democrats cannot afford to lose a single vote from their party given the chamber\\u2019s even partisan split.\", \"\\u201cToday is another momentous day in our historic effort to make the future better for the American people, for the children, to build back better with women, to save the planet,\\u201d Ms. Pelosi wrote in a letter to Democrats outlining the plan.\", \"Republicans honed their lines of attack off the successful campaign of Glenn Youngkin, the private equity executive and political neophyte who captured the governorship of Virginia by focusing heavily on education and the grievances of parents unhappy with how school districts have responded to the pandemic.\", \"Representative Elise Stefanik of New York, who is in charge of House Republican messaging, convened a round table on education on Wednesday to try to take Mr. Youngkin\\u2019s message national. Republicans made clear they would go after two of the biggest and most popular provisions in the social policy bill \\u2014 universal prekindergarten and generous child care support \\u2014 by saying they were schemes to nationalize early childhood education and force-feed left-wing pedagogy to youngsters.\", \"Ms. Stefanik said children had been \\u201cforced to remain masked and distanced from their peers,\\u201d and exposed to \\u201cinappropriate material\\u201d on race and gender.\", \"\\u201cVirginians spoke loud and clear last night that parental rights is an issue we can run on and win on,\\u201d she said. \\u201cGlenn Youngkin ran on education, and he won on education.\\u201d\", \"Democrats, though, appeared confident they could weather that line of attack, by emphasizing the benefits of the programs created by their legislation, against which Republicans are united in opposition.\", \"\\u201cOh, I welcome that fight,\\u201d said Senator Bob Casey, Democrat of Pennsylvania. \\u201cThey\\u2019re saying that we shouldn\\u2019t help families pay for child care and have more three- and four-year olds go to pre-K? Please say that, Republicans. Please say that.\\u201d\", \"But Mr. Warner was more circumspect. Democrats, he said, had been right to shower school districts with coronavirus pandemic relief over the last 18 months, but they now need to consider how that has fed into Republican accusations of the federal government centralizing control over how schools handled the pandemic and what they teach children.\", \"\\u201cI have not met a Virginia educator or parent anywhere that doesn\\u2019t think that kind of relief was appropriate as we come out of Covid,\\u201d he said. But, he added, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got to acknowledge that Glenn Youngkin tapped into concerns about education at the local level. He touched a nerve, and I think those of us on the Democratic side need to sit back and think about how we address that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3f5ba1123ccd11ec8384000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3f5ba1123ccd11ec8384000017025a03"}},
