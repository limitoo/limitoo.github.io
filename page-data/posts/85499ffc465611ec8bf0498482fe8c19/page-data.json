Last week, a coalition of the nation's largest unions also announced they too would file a suit against the mandate. However, this coalition is seeking expansion.\", \"The AFL-CIO, United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW), and Service Employees International (SEIU) unions sent a petition to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia requesting the court review vaccination requirements, CNBC reported.\", \"Though the petition did not include a summary of their arguments, a representative for the food workers union told CNBC that the coalition wants the president's mandate expanded to cover more of the nation's workers. They also want the Labor Department to require employers to finance employee COVID tests and face masks, something not mandated under the current rules.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932639/topshot-us-health-virus-politics-biden.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Biden said he would be the most pro-union president in American history.

The union, which represents workers in healthcare, public services and property services, argued the current mandate \\\"fails to adequately protect all workers who face a grave danger from COVID-19 exposure in the workplace.\\\"\", \"Under the current Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) mandate, employers with a staff of over 100 people must vaccinate their workers by January 4.
