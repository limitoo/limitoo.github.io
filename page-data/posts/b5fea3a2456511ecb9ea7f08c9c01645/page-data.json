It was 1988, years before the 2000 Pearl Jam concert where nine people died in a stampede, but I knew that people had been crushed to death at a 1979 Who concert and stabbed at a 1969 Rolling Stones concert. So I hung back and watched the band alone that night, as my friends disappeared into the crowd of thousands that pushed up against the stage under a haze of smoke.\", \"I remember their proud smiles when they emerged 45 minutes later with their T-shirts torn and stained. Each glowed with the arrogant joy of a teenage boy who\\u2019d just won a fight. And I wondered whether, by choosing caution, I\\u2019d missed something important, some essential rite of passage that would bind the rest of them together.\", \"I thought of that moment this week, as the internet was flooded with horrific videos from the Travis Scott concert where eight people were killed and hundreds injured, at the Astroworld festival in Houston on Nov. 5. Investigations into what went so terribly wrong are still underway. It\\u2019s clear, however, that fans of the rapper, who has created a stage show that combines mosh-pit sensibilities with bombastic technology and pyrotechnics, come seeking a physical and cathartic experience, just like my friends at that Guns N\\u2019 Roses concert.\", \"Why are generation after generation of young people drawn to these places where they\\u2019re pushed, jostled, pummeled or worse? Why do they run into a seething crowd?\", \"It\\u2019s not an easy question to answer, but over my 25-year career playing in bands, and now as a record label executive, I\\u2019ve come to realize that when a feeling of shared community and that primal sense of adventure and danger meet at a concert, the result can be intoxicating. We feel a rush when we push things to the edge, especially when we do so in communion with others. And even if the crowd is rowdy or scary, there\\u2019s unity in surviving it, a fellowship in trauma. As the journalist Bill Buford wrote in \\u201cAmong the Thugs,\\u201d \\u201cbeing in a crowd is an act of violence. Nothingness is what you find there. Nothingness in its beauty, its simplicity, its nihilistic purity.\\u201d\", \"A few years after that Guns N\\u2019 Roses show, I found myself in the pit at the Lollapalooza festival, where tens of thousands of bodies swayed as one mass. The crowd surged toward the stage, and I was lifted off the ground and floating uncontrollably, in slow motion. What I felt in that moment was a wave of tremendous terror, and I remember wondering why nobody else looked as scared as I felt. In fact, the people around me all looked as if this was why they were there, that this was the most rewarding part of the event.\", \"Live music has often prompted a physical response. Igor Stravinsky\\u2019s \\u201cThe Rite of Spring\\u201d received \\u201ca storm of hissing\\u201d and caused what some described as a riot at its 1913 Paris debut. By the time I went to that Guns N\\u2019 Roses show, 75 years later, chairs had been removed from arenas, bringing the audiences to their feet. Sound systems had become deafening, and concerts were extravaganzas of explosions and flames whose heat could be felt at the back of the hall. None of this was designed to keep crowds calm.\", \"Today\\u2019s festivals and concerts are taking the athleticism of the mosh pit to a new level. As Mr. Scott himself has said, his shows feel like wrestling matches, with the audience \\u201craging and, you know, having fun and expressing good feelings.\\u201d Part of what fans are looking for in these secular places of worship is a feeling of belonging. The singalong of a chorus can unite thousands, and the simple acknowledgment of the person next to us who wears the same shirt, or displays a similar tattoo, can feel connective. Humans socialize in different ways, and many of us choose to do so among people who identify with the same music.\", \"We mosh, elbows to ribs and chins. We let others hoist us up and pass our bodies over the heads of strangers, trusting them not to drop or grope us. We climb on stages, dodging beefy security guards, to run a short victory lap before leaping into the welcoming arms of a crowd. We do all of these things with an unspoken understanding that we are there together, that we will take care of one another and that nobody wants to leave with more than a minor injury.\", \"By my early 20s, I had made it to the other side of the pit and was onstage as the drummer in a rock band. It might look as if the band exists outside of the crowd and its mayhem, but the performers can be swept up like any crowd member. There were times that I felt so lost in the moment that I blacked out my memory of an entire set. Other times, I felt like a spectator as I watched fans collide into one another at the front of the stage, wondering why they did what they did and questioning my role in their behavior \\u2014 the behavior I\\u2019d always feared as a fan.\", \"Even the largest music events are usually safe. But part of what many people love about concerts is the feeling of danger; the sense that you never know, something might go wrong. We like horror movies with scenes that make us jump. We pay money to sky-dive and hang glide. We take our children on roller coaster rides.\", \"My band once opened for the Los Angeles punk band Fear. During our set, the packed club crowd threw beer bottles at us (not out of appreciation). One bottle smashed on my bandmate\\u2019s guitar, narrowly missing his hand. Another bottle would have hit me squarely in the head had I not ducked mid-song. That was the most scared I\\u2019ve ever been at a show.\", \"But in that moment, I finally understood my friends\\u2019 rush of excitement at the Guns N\\u2019 Roses concert. The sense of imminent danger told me I should flee but also froze me in place. Like so many others who have survived a churning crowd, I felt a tremendous bond with my bandmates that night. I knew that if I could make it through that show, I\\u2019d never forget it.\"]","href_hash":"b5fea3a2456511ecb9ea7f08c9c01645"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b5fea3a2456511ecb9ea7f08c9c01645"}},
