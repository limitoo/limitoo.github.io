New York City's mandate went into effect November 1, with Police Commissioner Dermot Shea saying that out of 35,000 department employees, only 34 were placed on leave due to not being vaccinated.\", \"Lee and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have both been critics of President Joe Biden and other Democrats' policies on vaccine mandates. DeSantis has announced plans to give $5,000 bonuses to officers refusing to comply with vaccination mandates that want to relocate and join Florida's police force, a plan set to be formalized during a legislative session in January 2022.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935936/bill-lee-vaccine-mandate-tennessee.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Tennessee Governor Bill Lee announced an offer to pay relocation fees of unvaccinated police officers who move to join Tennessee's Highway Patrol in a video Wednesday. Above, Smith and Wesson President and CEO Mark Smith, left, and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee prepare for a groundbreaking ceremony for the new Tennessee location for the firearms manufacturer, November 5 in Alcoa, Tennessee. </div>\", \"The offer makes Lee the latest Republican leader to capitalize on vaccine mandate tensions. He didn't immediately mention how much the state would reimburse officers or how it would be done.\", \"\\\"The reimbursement rate for relocation expenses will depend on the number of qualified candidates who commit to moving,\\\" complete training and join the state police force, Lee's spokesperson Casey Black said in an email.\", \"\\\"As so many cities and states choose to disrespect, degrade and defund the honorable work of law enforcement, we want Florida to continue valuing our men and women of law enforcement today, tomorrow and for generations to come,\\\" DeSantis said in a statement in August.\", \"Both DeSantis and Lee have criticized vaccine mandates touted by Democratic President Joe Biden's administration. They've also backed various bills in their GOP-controlled legislatures to combat virus rules.\", \"The focus on law enforcement amid the COVID-19 pandemic comes when the nation's first responders are both dying in larger numbers from the disease while also pushing back against mandates.\", \"While there are no national statistics that break down the vaccination rate for the country's first responder population, police officers, firefighters and others are largely considered among the more hesitant to get the vaccine.\", \"Some 280 law enforcement members have died of COVID-19 in 2021 and at last count 13 of them with Tennessee ties, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page.\", \"Earlier this month, Lee hinted he was eager to boost the numbers of the state's troopers during a budget hearing with Tennessee Highway Patrol Colonel Matt Perry. At the time, Perry said there were currently more than 930 troopers though he was roughly seeking a goal of 1,300.\", \"\\\"I would say, you should be challenged that what you have is an administration that would like to have 1,300 troopers on the road right now,\\\" Lee told Perry. \\\"So you should think about what's keeping you from doing that and aggressively go after that.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935938/bill-lee-vaccine-mandate-tennessee.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Tennessee Governor Bill Lee announced in a video Wednesday an offer to pay unvaccinated police officers to move to the state and join Tennessee's Highway Patrol.
