Leaders across the U.S. have urged vaccination and masking in response to the variant. Airlines in the U.S. were told to identify passengers who had recently visited southern Africa.\", \"More than a dozen countries across four continents have detected the variant since it was first identified.\", \"South Africa has been sequencing the variant, which now accounts for nearly three-quarters of 249 samples from positive coronavirus tests that were checked in November. Cases are rising sharply, with 8,651 new cases reported on Wednesday, almost twice as many as the day before. The share of tests that are coming back positive has risen to 16.5 percent from 10.2 percent on Tuesday.\", \"\\u201cThe message from the health ministry is \\u2018Wait and see, we don\\u2019t know enough yet,\\u2019\\u201d Lynsey Chutel, a Times reporter based in Johannesburg, told me today. The case numbers, she said, were still far lower than in places like the U.S. and Germany.\", \"\\u201cWhat is worrying is that jump in positivity rate,\\u201d she added.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"The E.U. proposed new measures on Wednesday that would allow member states bordering Belarus to suspend some protections for asylum seekers. The move could undermine the ability of migrants to seek refuge in the bloc.\", \"Poland, Lithuania and Latvia have been taking a hard line against the migrants who have been trying to enter Europe via Belarus.\", \"Officials said the measures would be temporary; if approved, they would remain in force for six months but could be extended. But immigration experts say the new measures will have worrying consequences for asylum rights within the bloc.\", \"Critics also said the move would simply land people in detention for longer periods, creating additional burdens rather than easing the border crisis.\", \"Details: The current registration period for asylum applications is three to 10 days. Under the proposal, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland could extend that to four weeks. The processing time for claims could be extended to four months.\", \"The toll: At least 12 people have died during the crisis, but aid groups say the number could be higher.\", \"The Supreme Court appeared poised to uphold a Mississippi law that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. Dobbs v. Jackson Women\\u2019s Health Organization is the most important abortion case in decades, and the questioning during arguments was tense and heated.\", \"The ruling could have monumental impact on access to abortions in the country and could allow at least 20 states to make almost all abortions unlawful. Here are the latest updates.\", \"Such a ruling would be at odds with what the court has said was the central holding of Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion. \", \"Details: Roe stopped states from banning the procedure before around 23 weeks of pregnancy. The court seemed divided on Wednesday about whether to make 15 weeks the new limit, as is stipulated in the Mississippi law, or whether to completely overrule Roe, allowing states to ban abortions at any time or entirely.\", \"Timing: The decision in the abortion case is not expected until late June or early July. Here\\u2019s what happens next.\", \"On the ground: We visited Mississippi\\u2019s last abortion clinic, which is busier than ever.\", \"Loic Gouzer upended the traditional auction format while he was at Christie\\u2019s. In May, he teamed up with cryptocurrency experts to purchase the 2005 Banksy painting \\u201cLove Is in the Air\\u201d for $12.9 million and now plans to sell off 10,000 digital pieces of it as NFTs, or nonfungible tokens. If successful, the venture could help fuel a burgeoning category of art market competition, with consortiums of buyers challenging billionaire collectors.\", \"After a year of reading, meeting, more reading, discussing, culling and voting, the final decision is here: The editors of The Times Book Review have chosen the 10 best books of 2021.\", \"\\u201cWe deliberated all year with monthly two-hour-long meetings (sometimes longer!) to discuss possible contenders,\\u201d Pamela Paul, the editor of the Book Review, told us. The editors cast votes, and runoffs were often necessary. Below are a few of the choices, and here are all 10. You can also browse our 10-best lists from previous years.\", \"How Beautiful We Were by Imbolo Mbue: Set in a fictional African village, the novel is a decades-spanning fable of power and corruption.\", \"Intimacies by Katie Kitamura: A court translator in The Hague is assigned to vanish into the voices and stories of war criminals.\", \"No One Is Talking About This by Patricia Lockwood: This novel distills the pleasures and limitations of life split between online and flesh-and-blood interactions.\", \"On Juneteenth by Annette Gordon-Reed: Exploring the racial and social complexities of her home state of Texas, Gordon-Reed asks readers to take a more nuanced look at history.\", \"Make hearty vegetarian mushrooms and dumplings.\", \"Simple activities like walking may boost immune cells in the brain that help keep memory sharp and even ward off Alzheimer\\u2019s disease.\", \"Here\\u2019s a guide to the new documentary \\u201cThe Beatles: Get Back.\\u201d\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: 404 Page Not Found, e.g. (five letters).\", \"And here is today\\u2019s Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.
