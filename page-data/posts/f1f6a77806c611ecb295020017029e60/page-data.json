But Indian-Americans  say that they are often ostracised by those who have the holy task of solemnising their unions. \", \"Temples refusing to host same-sex weddings, priests hanging up on their phone calls or unwilling to tweak the ceremony to suit them and, in some cases, not even showing up on the day of the wedding - these experiences have driven Indian-American gay couples to fall back on friends and well-wishers to create unique ceremonies rooted in their culture. \", \"Sapna Pandya, for instance, became a priest herself although female priests are virtually unheard of in Hinduism. \", \"She did it because of the opposition she and her Pakistani Muslim wife, Sahar, faced when they wanted to get married the traditional way. \", \"\\\"I didn't feel comfortable going to the temple to see a priest.
