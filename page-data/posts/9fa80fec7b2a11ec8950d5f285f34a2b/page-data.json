There is a risk all these parts of the health system will be under stress, especially around the peak time of an Omicron outbreak.\\\"\", \"Prof Wilson did not think future lockdowns were necessary - instead, the Government needed to roll out a new alert level system enforcing more mask use and increasing building ventilation, he said.\", \"RNZ\"]","href_hash":"9fa80fec7b2a11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9fa80fec7b2a11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
