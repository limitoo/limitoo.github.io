Even many who have been vaccinated themselves are more divided over whether to vaccinate their own younger children, given that severe Covid-19 is much less common for them.\", \"There were no new safety issues in Pfizer's study of the vaccine in thousands of children, but there is also no long-term data for its use.\", \"A few other countries, including China, are already vaccinating children.
