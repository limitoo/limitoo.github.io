This leaves \\u201ca large vaccination gap that cannot be bridged rapidly and gives ample room for the virus to spread,\\u201d Ms. Ammon said.\", \"Recommended restrictions could include wearing face masks, working from home, keeping a safe distance and reducing social interactions. Lockdowns are like an \\u201cemergency brake,\\u201d Ms. Ammon said, used when \\u201cyou want to bring down a very high case number in a short period of time.\\u201d \", \"She added: \\u201cI am aware that it requires a significant effort from public health authorities and society at large to achieve this goal.

On Tuesday, Italy allowed vaccinated people to get a booster shot five months after the second shot of their initial vaccination.\", \"Europe has seen a sharp spike in the number of new infections, hospitalizations and deaths in recent weeks, prompting governments to impose new restrictions, including a lockdown in Austria, one of the first in Western Europe since vaccines became available. The German health minister, Jens Spahn, warned on Monday that by the end of this winter \\u201cjust about everyone in Germany will probably be either vaccinated, recovered or dead.\\u201d\", \"According to the World Health Organization, Europe accounted for more than half of the world\\u2019s reported Covid deaths this months, and more than two million new cases each week, the most since the pandemic began. On Tuesday, the World Health Organization said that Covid had become the leading cause of death in Europe, and that Europe\\u2019s Covid death toll would likely exceed two million by next spring. \", \"Over the weekend, tens of thousands of Europeans across the continent protested, sometimes violently, against vaccine mandates and new restrictions.\", \"There are very high discrepancies in vaccination rates between different European countries. Only 24 percent of the total population in Bulgaria has been fully inoculated, contrasted with 81 percent in Portugal. But as vaccinated people can also transmit the disease, the E.C.D.C. said, it is important to put in place restrictions even in countries with high inoculation rates.\", \"\"]","href_hash":"c6bc38e24d4411ec9e025326e97e4f58"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c6bc38e24d4411ec9e025326e97e4f58"}},
