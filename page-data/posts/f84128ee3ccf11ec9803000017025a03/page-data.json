Above, Leah Lefkove, 9, shows off her vaccination sticker just before being the first child to be vaccinated at the Viral Solutions vaccination and testing site in Decatur, Georgia, on the first day COVID-19 vaccinations were available for children from 5 to 12 on November 3, 2021.</div>\", \"At a Decatur, Georgia, pediatrician's office Wednesday, 10-year-old Mackenzie Olson took off her black leather jacket and rolled up her sleeve as her mother looked on.\", \"\\\"I see my friends but not the way I want to. I want to hug them, play games with them that we don't normally get to,\\\" and have a pillow fight with her best friend, Mackenzie said after getting her shot at the Children's Medical Group site.\", \"With the federal government promising enough vaccine to protect the nation's 28 million kids in this age group, pediatricians' offices and hospitals began inoculating children, with schools, pharmacies and other locations planning to follow suit in the days ahead.\", \"Brian Giglio, 40, of Alexandria, Virginia, brought in his 8-year-old son, Carter, for vaccination at Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C. The boy has Type 1 diabetes that puts him at risk for complications if he were to become infected.\", \"\\\"Carter is the last in our house to get vaccinated and he was always the one that we had the most concern about,'' Giglio said. \\\"And so today is like a hallway pass for us to begin living life again and we couldn't be more thankful to everybody that's been involved in this process to helping us feel that freedom that we feel today.''\", \"Carter said he can't wait to leave masks behind once he's fully vaccinated, so he can smell the things he used to be able to smell without it.\", \"\\\"I'm ready to trash it,\\\" he said, though the CDC still recommends masks in schools and indoor public spaces where virus activity is high, even for the fully vaccinated.\", \"Cate Zeigler-Amon, 10, arrived with her mom and was first in line early Wednesday for a drive-through vaccination at Viral Solutions in Atlanta. The girl bounced around the car, her body hanging halfway out the window in excitement before the shot, which she broadcast live on her computer during morning announcements at her elementary school.\", \"Afterward, Cate said she was \\\"very, very, very excited and very happy,\\\" looking forward to eating inside a restaurant, hugging her friends, and celebrating her birthday indoors next month \\\"instead of having a freezing cold outside birthday party.\\\"\", \"The vaccine\\u2014one-third the dose given to older children and adults and administered with kid-sized needles\\u2014requires two doses three weeks apart, plus two more weeks for full protection to kick in. That means children who get vaccinated before Thanksgiving will be covered by Christmas.\", \"\\\"The timing before winter holidays is very fortunate,\\\" said Dr. Jennifer Shu, whose Children's Medical Group office in Decatur, Georgia, began vaccinating first thing Wednesday. \\\"This age group will be able to spend holidays with friends and family more safely than they have been able to since the start of the pandemic.\\\"\", \"Thousands of pediatricians pre-ordered doses, and Pfizer began shipments soon after the Food and Drug Administration's decision Friday to authorize emergency use.

CVS was also accepting appointments online and by phone for vaccinations at select pharmacies starting Sunday.\", \"Many locations planned mass vaccination events in coming days. And while many pediatricians' offices were expecting strong demand at least initially, almost two-thirds of parents recently polled by the Kaiser Family Foundation said they would either wait or not seek out the vaccines for their kids.\", \"Hannah Hause, a Colorado mother of four children ages 2, 5, 7 and 8, is among those not in any rush. She's vaccinated but wants more time to see how the child vaccines play out and are studied in the larger childhood population.\", \"\\\"It's not studied long-term.

That data showed more than 2,000 COVID-related school closures in just the first two months of the current school year. Advocates say getting school-aged kids vaccinated will reduce those disruptions.\", \"But Stewart thinks demand for kids' shots will be mixed.\", \"\\\"Because many of my patients are Black, Indigenous and people of color, I've seen the full spectrum,'' from parents eager to get their children vaccinated to those who are more hesitant \\\"because of a history of mistrust in the medical community,'' said Stewart, past president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.\", \"Her message to both is the same: \\\"Vaccines work, they're safe, they're effective and they save lives,'' she said. \\\"The more individuals that we can get vaccinated including our children, the sooner we will be able to get out of this pandemic.''\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1925615/kids-covid-vaccine.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The U.S. enters a new phase Wednesday in its COVID-19 vaccination campaign, with shots now available to millions of elementary-age children in what health officials hailed as a major breakthrough after more than 18 months of illness, hospitalizations, deaths and disrupted education.
