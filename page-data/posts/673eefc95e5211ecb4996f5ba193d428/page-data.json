They were chosen from 31 who applied, the rest missing out on the chance to put dignity aside in exchange for fistfuls of dollars.\\u00a0\", \"The money was donated by a loan provider CU Mortgage Direct, local paper the Argus Leader said in a glowing report, quoting participants praising the chance to compete for $1 notes as \\\"really cool\\\" and \\\"awesome\\\".\\u00a0\", \"Teachers involved told the paper they'd spend the money on chairs, cameras for remote learning and other equipment they need to teach. The most successful teacher scraped up US$616, the least successful just US$378.\\u00a0\", \"After the reporter behind the story tweeted a video of the event, however, criticism quickly rolled in.\", \"\\\"Teachers, on their hands and knees, grabbing for $1 bills to buy classroom supplies, for the amusement of a crowd. yeah, totally uplifting and fun not at all totally dystopian,\\\" one person replied, racking up tens of thousands of likes.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We're just a few sharpened sticks away from public education 'Squid Game',\\\" tweeted Bill Weir, a CNN anchor.\\u00a0\", \"Others noted the 'Dash for Cash' was eerily similar to a scene from 1987 Arnold Schwarzenegger vehicle The Running Man, a dystopian film about a game show, based on a book by horror maestro Stephen King. In an advert for an in-universe show Climbing for Dollars, a man climbs a rope pocketing cash while rabid dogs nip at his heels from below. Eventually, he gets gassed and falls to his presumed death.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"THE RUNNING MAN reboot is going to be about student loan forgiveness,\\\" tweeted podcaster Jason Goldman.\\u00a0\", \"Others took to CU Mortgage Direct's Facebook page, CBS News reported, saying the stunt had backfired.\", \"\\\"Making teachers crawl on hands and knees in helmets for money. Disgusting and shameful,\\\" one person wrote.\\u00a0\", \"After initially talking the stunt up as an \\\"awesome group thing to do for the teachers\\\", CU Mortgage Direct changed its tune after the backlash went global. In its apology, the company said it would give all the teachers involved $500 - including the 21 who missed out.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Although our intent was to provide a positive and fun experience for teachers, we can see how it appears to be degrading and insulting towards the participating teachers and the teaching profession as a whole,\\\" the company said in a joint statement with Sioux Falls Stampede, the local hockey team.\\u00a0\", \"In a follow-up story, the Argus Leader reported South Dakota has some of the worst-paid teachers in the US.\", \"\\\"Events like this show that our educational system is broken,\\\" Sioux Falls Education Association president Tim Eckart told the paper.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"673eefc95e5211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"673eefc95e5211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
