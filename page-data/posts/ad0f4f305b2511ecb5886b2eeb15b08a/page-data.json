Now the company appears to be disputing her accusation, saying in the dismissal letter that she had \\u201cspread falsehoods such as \\u2018raped by executives and the company knew but did not deal with it.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSince August, the incident has gone through several twists and turns,\\u201d the letter went on, \\u201cand the damage caused to the company and the parties, including you, is incalculable.\\u201d\", \"Her accusation has not been buried by censors, as happened when Peng Shuai, the professional tennis player, posted an allegation of sexual assault against a former vice premier, Zhang Gaoli.\", \"Alibaba did not respond to a request for comment on Sunday. Mr. Du, the lawyer, declined to comment beyond confirming her dismissal and the letter informing her, which was previously reported by Dahe Daily, a publication of the state-owned Henan Daily Newspaper Group.\", \"The publication posted a lengthy interview with Ms. Zhou, in which she recounted the anguish she experienced in the aftermath of her accusation, including harassment online, the threat of legal action against her and, effective Nov. 25, her firing. Mr. Du said that Ms. Zhou was not immediately available to comment.\", \"In the video she posted on the company\\u2019s internal website, she accused her boss, identified in media reports by his surname, Wang, of attacking her in a hotel in the city of Jinan after a drunken evening with a company client, whom she also accused of sexual assault. She said that she had reported the assault to the company but no one acted, prompting her to go public.\", \"Prosecutors in Jinan investigated her accusation but announced in September that they would not file charges against Mr. Wang because his behavior did not constitute a crime. The other man, who has been identified in police statements by his last name, Zhang, is still reported to be under investigation for his role in the events that night.\", \"The decision not to prosecute Mr. Wang brought more attention to the case. Its notoriety was fueled by Alibaba\\u2019s prominence and, perhaps, by the government campaign against it and its founder, Mr. Ma.\", \"When Ms. Zhou\\u2019s accusation went public, Alibaba said the company had \\u201ca zero-tolerance policy against sexual misconduct\\u201d and vowed it would write an explicit policy against sexual harassment and create a dedicated channel for employees to report incidents of misconduct.\", \"Now, according to her dismissal letter, the company, too, faces legal consequences. It did not specify a case, but Mr. Wang\\u2019s wife has said publicly that she intended to sue over his dismissal.\", \"The letter suggested that the company had sought Ms. Zhou\\u2019s cooperation, offering to cover the cost of lawyer fees and psychological consultation. It said that she had not responded. Nor did she respond to what appeared to be an effort to negotiate her termination.\", \"In the end, however, the company cited her original accusation as grounds for dismissal, noting an article in the company\\u2019s code of conduct: \\u201cPublishing or disseminating inappropriate remarks to the outside world, or deliberately fabricating or disseminating fictitious facts, or disseminating unconfirmed information, causing bad influence.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ad0f4f305b2511ecb5886b2eeb15b08a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ad0f4f305b2511ecb5886b2eeb15b08a"}},
