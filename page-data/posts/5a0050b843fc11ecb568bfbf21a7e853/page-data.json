In one common form, a protagonist with a question will pose it to a succession of others. It\\u2019s a fun training ground to understand point of view. Each answer offers someone else\\u2019s. Usually the question is a simple one: Did you see a mouse? Have you seen my hat?\", \"In two new picture books with text featuring repeated questions, what\\u2019s asked isn\\u2019t so simple. \\u201cHow Beautiful,\\u201d by Antonella Capetti and Melissa Castrill\\u00f3n, puts the question \\u201cWhat does beautiful mean?\\u201d in the mouth of a caterpillar. \\u201cWhat Is Love?,\\u201d by Mac Barnett and the Caldecott honoree Carson Ellis, has a boy pose its title question. Both books seem to aim higher than mere entertainment.\", \"In these disturbing times, authors, parents, editors and just about everyone else long for answers to big questions \\u2014 a longing that has burrowed down to books for the very young. We\\u2019re seeing large numbers of picture books that explore important and serious themes \\u2014 ways to make the world better, reassurance that everyone matters \\u2014 with an explicitness that gives me pause: Are these issues that engage small children? Do the books work as intended? What\\u2019s certain is that when presented with books on the most abstract of themes, children will make of them what they make of them.\", \"Of the two new books, \\u201cHow Beautiful\\u201d is more down-to-earth. Its setting is the forest floor. An \\u201cUnknown Thing\\u201d (a girl) has found a caterpillar and called it beautiful, so now this tiny creature is possessed by the need to understand that word. It asks one animal after another, each one responding with a thing it deems beautiful (bear: a honeycomb; mouse: a mushroom; mole: the underground). But an intrusive blackbird contradicts each answer: That thing is not beautiful, it says; maybe just tasty or useful or cozy. In the end, a giant moon rises. The gathered animals gasp. \\u201cHow beautiful!\\u201d they all exclaim. \\u201cSo it was.\\u201d\", \"Children pick up words largely by inference, so perhaps this one uncontested example, the moon, could serve to define beauty. In fact, though, the book suffers from an impossible translation problem: The Italian bello has a far wider-ranging meaning than the English beautiful: In context, \\u201cQuesto \\u00e8 bello\\u201d can mean \\u201cthis is great (in a general way)\\u201d rather than \\u201cthis is beautiful.\\u201d So the crow\\u2019s disagreements make more sense in Capetti\\u2019s Italian than in the English; the bird\\u2019s issues aren\\u2019t aesthetic. The Italian text ends with an awed silence, subtly suggesting deeper levels of meaning in a story that is about the meaning of a word.\", \"The spirit of awe is fully available to a 4-year-old. But the importance of understanding the concept of beauty? Not so much. A small inner me wondered why this quest for a definition was so important to the caterpillar. Yet the series of animals with answers is humorous and varied. My favorite among them is a deer posed on an abandoned couch in the woods. (Beautiful couch? Maybe not. Great place to be? Yes.)\", \"Luckily, translation had no effect on Castrill\\u00f3n\\u2019s striking pictures, which more than make up for problems with the text. Her wild drawings carry a decorative impulse to unexpected heights. Her unique style hasn\\u2019t much changed from earlier books (see her collaborations with Nina Laden), and I imagine one could overdose, but not me, not yet.\", \"The animals have a droll folk-art quality and the caterpillar is adorable, but it\\u2019s their environment that dazzles. Oddly colored, with a narrow but beautiful palette, the pictures are equal parts goofy and elegant. Each page turn reveals a new way of deploying hallucinogenic wonder across a two-page spread. This, too, is a definition of beautiful.\", \"As for love, do you need a definition of the word to experience it?\", \"\\u201cWhat is love?\\u201d a boy asks his grandmother in Barnett and Ellis\\u2019s book. She picks him up and says, \\u201cIf you go out into the world, you might find an answer.\\u201d So he goes. \\u201cLove is a fish,\\u201d says the fisherman. \\u201cLove is a house,\\u201d says the carpenter. As the boy rejects each answer, the fable-like text builds to a crescendo of solutions, both serious and amusing: A mass of people of all types proudly parade their love metaphors across the page. Finally the boy, now grown, returns to his old home. In a moving passage, he absorbs the scene through all his senses, digging his toes into the dirt. His grandmother appears and asks if he has found his answer. He picks her up and replies, \\u201cYes.\\u201d\", \"My adult self sees a meaning here: Trying to understand love through other people\\u2019s words is no substitute for experience \\u2014 for feeling, and being there for someone. My inner child, with whom the need to understand \\u201cwhat is love\\u201d struck no resonant chord, recoils at the picking up of a grandmother, is a bit mystified about that \\u201cyes\\u201d and goes back to look at the pictures.\", \"Ellis\\u2019s immaculate design sense infuses this book with a dignity and grace that adds power to the words. In her gouache drawings every watery bloom and ragged edge helps to strengthen the composition, build the space. The art is tactile and lively, playful and solemn. It recalls good midcentury illustration \\u2014 artists like Alice and Martin Provensen and Heinz Edelmann \\u2014 with hints of outsider art. A bit of blankness in the depiction of people, which in another kind of story could detract, here adds to the timeless quality of the words. The shapes and patterns of Ellis\\u2019s art, combined with the tenor of Barnett\\u2019s narration, give this book an air of mystery, whatever love is or isn\\u2019t.\", \"If ideas in a text go over a child\\u2019s head, it\\u2019s not a problem. Early in life, that over-the-head airspace is a barrage of words sailing by; you\\u2019re used to it. You guess, you assume, you go on. The failed book is one that doesn\\u2019t engage on some other level. A sense of story with a tangible theme, a good rhythm and a set of brilliant illustrations are what a child needs. At the start of life, the small questions want answering most of all.\"]","href_hash":"5a0050b843fc11ecb568bfbf21a7e853"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5a0050b843fc11ecb568bfbf21a7e853"}},
