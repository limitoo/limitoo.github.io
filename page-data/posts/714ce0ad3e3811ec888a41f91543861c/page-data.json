Tensions among Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats\\u2014the three largest ethnic groups\\u2014may collapse the power-sharing system adopted in 1995 to end the Bosnian War, which was one of the Yugoslav Wars.\", \"\\\"The crisis we are currently in perhaps is the best indication of why Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to enter the security alliance as soon as possible, which will permanently guarantee peace in this part of the world,\\\" Turkovic said.\", \"Bosnia and Herzegovina is made up of two parts; the Republika Srpska dominated by ethinic Serbs, and the Croat-Bosniak-dominated Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The country is headed by a three-member presidency with one from each of the major ethnic groups.\", \"The system\\u2014set out in the 1995 Dayton Agreement\\u2014has prevented a return to the brutal civil war of the 1990s, but according to critics has also entrenched the ethnic divisions that spurred past conflicts.\", \"Milorad Dodik is the Serb presidential representative. In recent months, the 62-year-old has dismissed Bosnia as an \\\"impossible\\\" and \\\"failed\\\" country.\", \"Dodik is also threatening to withdraw the Republika Srpska from national Bosnian institutions, including the armed forces. The threat of a revived ethnic Serb army is enough to set alarm bells ringing across the Balkans.\", \"He appears to be banking on further backing from Moscow. When threatening to force all Bosnian armed forces out of the Republika Srpska last month, Dodik said he had \\\"friends\\\" who would support such an operation\\u2014an apparent reference to Serbia and Russia.\", \"Moscow has also been engaging in more direct meddling. The mandate of the 700-strong EU peacekeeping force in Bosnia was up for renewal at the UN security council this week, a proposal Moscow threatened to oppose before eventually acquiescing at Wednesday's vote.\", \"For NATO and the EU, instability in Bosnia is an open door for Russia. For Putin, chaos and conflict is both a Russian opportunity and a drain on the European and American adversaries who will be forced to handle the fallout.\", \"The Kremlin is fiercely opposed to Bosnia's long-running efforts to join NATO and the EU, threatening action to stop such steps if required. In March, Russia's embassy in Serbia said that in the event of Bosnian rapprochement with NATO Moscow \\\"will have to react to this hostile act.\\\"\", \"The Croat member of Bosnia's three-member presidency, Zeljko Komsic, described the statement as a \\\"twisted threat.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926863/bisera-turkovic-press-conference-germany.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Bosnia and Herzegovina's Foreign Minister Bisera Turkovic addresses a joint press conference with her German counterpart following talks at the Foreign Ministry in Berlin, Germany on March 9, 2021.</div>\", \"\\\"Russia made it clear that it does not support NATO membership for Bosnia and Herzegovina, and we noticed that,\\\" Turkovic said.\", \"\\\"However, we are a sovereign and independent state, and we have democratic institutions that decide about our future based on the will of the people.

And we see U.S. and EU diplomats working on some solution.\", \"\\\"The problem is that sometimes diplomats on the ground search for easy and quick compromises that do not bring comprehensive and lasting solutions.
