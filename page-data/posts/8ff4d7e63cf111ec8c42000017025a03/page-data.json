Scotland, she said, has to manage the transition away from fossil fuels carefully.\", \"\\u201cWhat we need to do better in Scotland, to be candid,\\u201d she said, \\u201cwhat we\\u2019ve not done well enough and we need to get better at, not least to support the just transition away from oil and gas, is to capture more of the economic benefit of renewable technology.\\u201d\", \"Many of the wind projects in Scotland are foreign investments. \\u201cWe welcome them,\\u201d Ms. Sturgeon said, \\u201cbut we haven\\u2019t yet captured enough of that benefit in our own jobs and supply chain.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sturgeon, who was speaking at a Times event series running alongside the U.N. summit, said she viewed carbon capture and storage as an important way to deal with carbon emissions. But Scotland did not get backing from the British government to develop a carbon capture and storage facility in Aberdeenshire.\", \"Ms. Sturgeon, who has clashed with Prime Minister Boris Johnson on major issues, including his handling of the pandemic and Brexit, argued that Scotland would be able to manage a transition away from fossil fuels better on its own, as an independent nation, than as part of Britain. \", \"Reducing Scotland\\u2019s carbon emissions is a priority, she said.\", \"Over the summer, in a move that shocked the oil and gas industry, Ms. Sturgeon urged Britain\\u2019s government to revisit licenses already granted for offshore oil fields still in the planning stages. She cited \\u201cthe severity of the climate emergency we now face.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sturgeon said she was hopeful about the ability of leaders to make substantial progress at COP26.\", \"\\u201cPotentially, people 100 years from now will look back on this summit, I hope, and describe Glasgow as the place which really took the correct fork in the road for our planet,\\u201d she said.\"]","href_hash":"8ff4d7e63cf111ec8c42000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8ff4d7e63cf111ec8c42000017025a03"}},
