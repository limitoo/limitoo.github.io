Yet the accompanying recipe gave no credit to the authors, Alan Richardson and Karen Tack. \\u201cIt was so specific, down to the corncob holders,\\u201d Ms. Tack said. \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t a twist on it. It was just like ours.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Martin wrote to the magazine expressing disappointment, but\\u00a0never heard back. She asked a lawyer for her publisher whether they could do anything about the identical feature.\", \"\\u201cHe said the wording on the method isn\\u2019t the same, there is no similarity on the headnote \\u2014 tough luck,\\u201d said Ms. Martin, who is now a freelance editor. \\u201cI think that pretty much encompasses the problem in a nutshell.\\u201d\", \"U.S. copyright law seeks to protect \\u201coriginal works of authorship\\u201d by barring unauthorized copying of all kinds of creative material: sheet music, poetry, architectural works, paintings and even computer software.\", \"But recipes are much harder to protect. This is a reason they frequently reappear, often word for word, in one book or blog after another.\", \"Cookbook writers who believe that their work has been plagiarized have few options beyond confronting the offender or airing their grievances online. \\u201cIt is more of an ethical issue than it is a legal issue,\\u201d said Lynn Oberlander, a media lawyer in New York City.\", \"It was noteworthy, then, when in October, the publisher of the cookbook \\u201cMakan,\\u201d by the prominent British chef Elizabeth Haigh, pulled the book out of circulation, citing \\u201crights issues.\\u201d\", \"The author Sharon Wee had noticed that \\u201cMakan,\\u201d about the cuisine of Ms. Haigh\\u2019s native Singapore, contained recipes and stories nearly identical to ones in her own 2012 cookbook, \\u201cGrowing Up in a Nonya Kitchen.\\u201d Ms. Haigh even replicated some of Ms. Wee\\u2019s personal recollections, in much the same language \\u2014 material that could be protected by copyright laws in both Britain and the United States.\", \"Ms. Wee alerted Ms. Haigh\\u2019s publisher, Bloomsbury. (Eater later reported that \\u201cMakan\\u201d included recipes and passages almost identical to those in two other cookbooks.)\", \"\\u201cI am grateful that Bloomsbury has responded to my concerns by withdrawing \\u2018Makan\\u2019 from circulation,\\u201d Ms. Wee wrote in a statement on Instagram. (Bloomsbury and Ms. Wee declined to comment for this article, and Ms. Haigh, who has never replied publicly to the accusations, didn\\u2019t respond to requests for an interview.)\", \"The news was breathlessly covered online, and readers took to social media to express outrage over Ms. Haigh's apparent borrowing from a fellow Singaporean author with a smaller following.\", \"In the publishing world, it is well known and largely accepted that recipes, for the most part, can\\u2019t be copyrighted. But the \\u201cMakan\\u201d incident reinvigorated a debate about recipe ownership, leaving many writers and editors wondering how they can \\u2014 or even if they should \\u2014 protect their work in a genre that\\u2019s all about building on what came before.\", \"\\u201cThe whole history of American cookbook publishing is based on borrowing and sharing,\\u201d said Bonnie Slotnick, the owner of Bonnie Slotnick Cookbooks, an antique bookstore in the East Village of Manhattan.\", \"Amelia Simmons\\u2019 \\u201cAmerican Cookery,\\u201d published in 1796 and considered one of the first American cookbooks, is riddled with recipes copied from British cookbooks. In the ensuing years, white authors took recipes from Black cooks and passed them off as their own. Even the pioneering American cookbook author James Beard regularly published recipes taken from his colleagues, without giving credit.\", \"As recipe development became a full-time profession in recent decades, authors started getting litigious about perceived plagiarism. In a 1996 lawsuit, Meredith Corporation accused Publications International Ltd., of publishing recipes from its cookbook \\u201cDiscover Dannon: 50 Fabulous Recipes With Yogurt.\\u201d A court ruled that recipes and instructions were not covered by copyright law.\", \"Twelve years later, Missy Chase Lapine sued Jessica Seinfeld, claiming that Ms. Seinfeld\\u2019s cookbook \\u201cDeceptively Delicious,\\u201d about hiding healthful ingredients in children\\u2019s meals, stole the concept of her cookbook \\u201cThe Sneaky Chef.\\u201d A court ruled that Ms. Lapine\\u2019s concept was not protected.\", \"Whatever the merits of those cases, Jonathan Bailey, a copyright expert in New Orleans, said the internet and self-publishing on platforms like Amazon have made borrowing more common. \\u201cIt is easier to find stuff to plagiarize, it is easier to plagiarize and it is easier to publish whatever you plagiarize.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Bailey said many cookbook authors are used to the free exchange of ideas on social media, and may not be conscious of the importance of giving credit. \\u201cIt has become so tempting in this environment to just take rather than to create,\\u201d he said.\", \"The law views a recipe merely as a factual list of ingredients and basic steps rather than as creative expression. The introductions, photography and design that accompany a recipe can be covered by a copyright, as can the cookbook as a whole, or a specific sequence of recipes, said Sara Hawkins, a business and intellectual property lawyer in Phoenix.\", \"If the instructions are written with enough literary flourish, she said, they may be sufficiently creative to be copyrightable.\", \"When the nation\\u2019s copyright law was first codified in 1790, cooking was seen as a woman\\u2019s domestic responsibility rather than as a professional activity, Ms. Hawkins said. Written recipes are a relatively new invention; many cultures passed down culinary traditions orally.\", \"While the technology and music industries have pushed successfully to change copyright law in their fields, \\u201cthere is not a big powerful lobby to push anything through for individual recipes,\\u201d she said.\", \"As a result, some cookbook authors feel less willing to publish their treasured recipes.\", \"\\u201cWhen you feel like your stories, your work, your investment ends up benefiting people who are already higher up in the hierarchy of fame, it tempts me to go to a place I don\\u2019t want to go, which is to hoard knowledge,\\u201d said Leela Punyaratabandhu, who has written three Southeast Asian cookbooks.\", \"Ms. Punyaratabandhu said she felt more vulnerable to recipe theft as a Thai person documenting traditional Thai recipes. People see her as simply sharing long-held knowledge, she said, \\u201calthough I spent the time and expense testing the recipes to come up with what I think is the best formula. My role has been reduced to just the translator.\\u201d\", \"But when a white author develops Thai recipes, she said, \\u201cthese people are considered scholars because they come from a different culture.\\u201d (On the other hand, they may be accused of another type of unethical borrowing \\u2014 cultural appropriation.)\", \"Recipes undergo \\u201cdepersonalization\\u201d throughout the publishing process, she said, making it harder to argue that they should be protected. \\u201cThe instructions have been standardized to the point where everyone is speaking the same voice,\\u201d she said.\", \"To guard against recipe theft, the cookbook author Andrea Nguyen maintains a \\u201cPermission\\u201d section on her website, with clear instructions for how to republish her recipes with credit. Many others do the same.\", \"Ms. Nguyen said publishers must bear some responsibility in ensuring their cookbooks are wholly original. \\u201cSo many books are being pushed out right now that publishers are racing to the release line,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere is little time for, frankly, auditing the book. You have editors that may not be deeply immersed in the subject matter.\\u201d\", \"But Michael Szczerban, the editorial director of Voracious, an imprint of Little, Brown and Company, said it is not the editor\\u2019s job to be an authority on the cookbook\\u2019s subject. \\u201cIt is my role, I feel, to read critically, to ask questions, to help illuminate for an author areas they might not have thought through,\\u201d he said. Authors are chosen for their expertise, and are contractually required to submit original work.\", \"He said placing copyright protections on recipes would harm the genre.\", \"\\u201cI think it is a good thing in the world that many people have different ways for making chocolate chip cookies,\\u201d Mr. Szczerban said. \\u201cI have more examples in my memory bank of people who have kind of furthered the culinary arts by engaging with other people\\u2019s recipes and bringing their own transformation to them than people who have ripped other people off.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Bailey, the copyright expert, said the lack of legal protections for recipes may help explain why so many cookbooks now have creative elements like narrative essays and beautiful photography, both of which can be copyrighted. \\u201cI think this is a situation where the law has shaped recipes, far more than recipes have shaped the law,\\u201d he said.\", \"Several cookbook writers said they simply didn\\u2019t think about copyright protections when writing recipes.\", \"\\u201cThe purpose of a recipe is for someone else to make it, not for you to have some trademark on it,\\u201d said Jenn\\u00e9 Claiborne, the author of \\u201cSweet Potato Soul.\\u201d Readers tend to step in if they see that a recipe is stolen, Ms. Claiborne said. Even if the cookbook stays in print, the offending author\\u2019s reputation will be damaged.\", \"Klancy Miller, who wrote \\u201cCooking Solo\\u201d and founded \\u201cFor the Culture\\u201d magazine, questioned how original any recipe can truly be. \\u201cIsn\\u2019t there just one platonic version of X,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand we are all just making modifications, some of us better than others?\\u201d\", \"Still, the furor over the cookbook \\u201cMakan\\u201d made her worry that at some point, she had been subconsciously influenced by another author without giving credit. \\u201cFor people who have been plagiarized, I empathize with them,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut I also think, like, what if we have all done it a little bit?\\u201d\", \"There have been attempts to set standards for borrowing recipes. As a student at Le Cordon Bleu cooking school in Paris, Ms. Miller was taught she had to change six elements of a recipe before it could be considered a new one. In \\u201cJubilee,\\u201d a 2019 cookbook about African American foodways, the author Toni Tipton-Martin explicitly tells readers to adapt the recipes, and includes historical versions of those recipes in the margins \\u2014 attributed to the authors \\u2014 so readers can understand how each dish evolved.\", \"Judy Pray, the executive editor of Artisan Books, said she asks her authors to err on the side of crediting, in the introduction to a recipe, anyone who may have inspired the dish. \\u201cIt is up to those of us who could be considered gatekeepers to try to create those norms,\\u2019 she said, \\u201cor start to enforce those norms.\\u201d\", \"That includes the people cooking the recipes.\", \"Thanks to the outpouring of support from cookbook enthusiasts, the British book \\u201cGrowing Up in a Nonya Kitchen\\u201d is being reissued, and Ms. Wee is working on a 10th anniversary version to be released next year.\", \"Ms. Nguyen said she hoped the public response taught those in publishing an important lesson: \\u201cIt is still readers who hold the power.\\u201d\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
