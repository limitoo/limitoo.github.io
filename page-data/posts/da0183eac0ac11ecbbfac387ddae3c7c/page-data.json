Wu said the virus was \\\"under effective control\\\" for the first time in some parts of the city.\\u00a0Under the latest changes, more than 4 million people are included in areas where the status shifted from closed to controlled, said Wu. He said some are not allowed to leave their neighborhoods and large gatherings are prohibited.\", \"\\u00a0Meanwhile, the IMF reduced its forecast of Chinese growth this year to 4.4% from 4.8% due to the shutdowns of Shanghai and other industrial centers. That is down by almost half from last year's 8.1% growth and below the ruling Communist Party's 5.5% target.\\u00a0China's case numbers in its latest infection surge are relatively low, but the ruling party is enforcing a \\\"zero-COVID\\\" strategy that has shut down major cities to isolate every case.\\u00a0On Wednesday, the government reported 19,927 new cases in China's mainland, all but 2,761 of which had no symptoms. Shanghai accounted for 95% of the total, or 18,902 cases, of which 2,495 had symptoms.\\u00a0The Shanghai city health agency reported seven people who had COVID-19 died Tuesday but said the deaths were due to cancer, heart disease and other ailments. All but two were over 60.\\u00a0Shanghai shut down businesses and confined most of its population to their homes starting March 28 after a spike in infections. That led to complaints about lack of access to supplies of food and medicine. People in Shanghai who test positive but have no symptoms have been ordered into \\u00a0quarantine centers set up in exhibition halls and other public buildings.\\u00a0Official data this week showed economic growth in the first three months of this year declined compared with the final quarter of 2021.\\u00a0The lockdowns in China \\\"will likely compound supply disruptions elsewhere\\\" and might add to pressure for inflation to rise, the IMF said in a report.\\u00a0The ruling party has promised tax refunds and other aid to businesses but is avoiding large-scale stimulus spending. Economists say that strategy will take longer to show results and Beijing might need to spend more or cut interest rates.\\u00a0Chinese leaders have promised to try to reduce the human and economic cost of anti-disease controls by shifting to a \\\"dynamic clearing\\\" strategy that isolates neighborhoods and other smaller areas instead of whole cities. However, many areas appear to be enforcing more stringent controls after Shanghai officials were criticized for not acting aggressively enough.\\u00a0Also Wednesday, the Ministry of Agriculture ordered local officials to avoid any measures that might interfere with spring planting by farmers who feed China's 1.4 billion people. The order followed warnings that production of wheat and other crops might be disrupted, which would boost demand for imports and push up already high global prices.\\u00a0The government reported 26,760 people who tested positive but had no symptoms were released Wednesday from observation. That included 25,411 in Shanghai, where some residents of quarantine centers have complained they are unsanitary.\\u00a0Other industrial and trading centers including Changchun, Jilin and Shenyang in the northeast, the port of Tianjin east of Beijing and Shenzhen and Guangzhou in the south have closed businesses, imposed travel restrictions or told told residents to stay home.\\u00a0Global automakers and other manufacturers reduced or stopped production because suppliers couldn't deliver.\\u00a0This week, Volkswagen AG announced its Changchun factory resumed production and the automaker was considering when its Shanghai facility would reopen. BMW AG said its factory in Shenyang reopened.\\u00a0While some cities were easing controls, the the government of Harbin, a city of 5.3 million in the northeast, suspended bus and subway service on Wednesday and barred the public from moving between districts.\"]","href_hash":"da0183eac0ac11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"da0183eac0ac11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
