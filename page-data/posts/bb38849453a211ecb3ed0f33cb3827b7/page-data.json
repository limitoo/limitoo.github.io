I was born with hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy, which causes weakness in my muscles and loss of sensation in my lower legs \\u2014 it's great for getting tattoos but less ideal for walking.\\u00a0\", \"I also have severe idiopathic kyphoscoliosis, which has caused chronic lung disease and fatigue and means I have to use a cute pink wheelchair for most of my time out and about.\", \"For as long as I can remember, I've wanted to be a teacher. As a nine-year-old, I would use my parents' computer to print out colouring sheets and organise them into a display folder. I'd then take the folder to my younger brother's room and demand he complete my \\\"worksheets\\\" so I could collect and mark them.\\u00a0\", \"Now, I'm in my final semester of a primary education bachelor's degree at university.\", \"Of course, there's a deeper reason why teaching is my dream job: I want to change negative perspectives and misconceptions about disability that I have faced my whole life.

Education has become much more inclusive than when I was a five year old.\\u00a0\", \"Back then, my parents had to stand up to primary schools in my hometown and try and persuade them to let me in to mainstream classes. Only one school accepted me. My mum and the principal at the time then began writing letters to decision-makers, trying to get funding to build my school's first ramps, disabled toilets and assistive technology.\\u00a0\", \"I faced similar difficulties in high school \\u2014\\u00a0to the point I wasn't able to access a lot of the school buildings until I was in year 11. I had to fight just to do my elective subjects, which had to be relocated so I could get into the classroom. Along the way I had to deal with teachers who believed I was a hassle and should just sit alone while classes ran upstairs, while also struggling with the fact I looked \\\"different\\\" to most of my peers.\\u00a0\", \"When I reached university, I'd become a passionate disability advocate ready to shine \\u2014 but of course fresh challenges were unlocked. There was a whole new world of protocols to be followed to get my accessibility needs met, but I obliged and advocated every chance I could. I started to affect small but meaningful changes in policies, take up volunteering opportunities and achieve academic goals.\\u00a0\", \"As I gained experience as a pre-service teacher, I also took up more opportunities for disability advocacy and promoting inclusion, volunteering at hospitals and on committees. Because I'd spent so much time in hospital myself, I knew how to help others.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Kids\\u00a0ask confronting questions</div>\", \"Now that I'm nearing the end of my degree, I've been reflecting on how I can teach my future students the importance of disability, advocacy and inclusion. If I teach just one class each year, that's a whole group of primary school kids who will potentially have a completely different (and hopefully more positive) perspective on disability.\\u00a0\", \"Since the day I first starte+d my degree, I've kept in my head a speech I use to introduce myself and my disability. Kids are curious and are renowned for asking questions that some may find rude or mean \\u2014\\u00a0I've experienced this since I was a kid myself.\\u00a0\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/9911e1174bdfb4024b2937f55ff7985d\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> As I gained experience as a pre-service teacher\\u00a0I took up more opportunities for disability advocacy.(Supplied)</div>\", \"One of the most interesting questions I've been asked is whether I could \\\"take off\\\" what is on my back. It took me a moment to realise what the student meant \\u2014\\u00a0I thought I must have had a sticky note or some other prank on my back. But no, they meant my spinal curvature.\\u00a0\", \"It was a really confronting experience because when I was a kid, I really did wish I could just take it off, flatten it, anything to not look different. Still, I used the opportunity to explain why my curved spine is different \\u2014\\u00a0that I was born this way \\u2014\\u00a0and let them ask questions.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Powerful moments I'll never forget</div>\", \"Recently, I was lucky enough to teach a full set of lessons on the topic of diversity and inclusion to a class of year three students. There were a couple of powerful moments I will never forget. In one of my lessons, some students said they \\\"wished\\\" they were in a wheelchair\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0because to them, it seemed easier than walking long distances.\\u00a0\", \"It turned into quite a philosophical discussion about why they felt this way: all they knew was walking long distances. But for me, all I know is using a wheelchair. We talked about our different perspectives, and I told them that sometimes, I wish I could walk without getting fatigued.\\u00a0\", \"Another classroom interaction turned into a lesson on the power of language, how certain words or phrases can be offensive to people with disabilities. Several students expressed how happy they were to know why they shouldn't use certain words \\u2014\\u00a0for example, using the word \\\"autistic\\\" or \\\"retard\\\" as an insult \\u2014 instead of just being told not to \\\"because it's wrong\\\".\\u00a0\", \"It made my heart melt with pride \\u2014\\u00a0though not as much as the day I introduced to them the term \\\"disability advocate\\\". To hear a group of children say they wanted to become advocates for people with disabilities\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0despite not having disabilities themselves \\u2014\\u00a0was one of the most special moments of my degree.\", \"Moments like that are what inspires me, why I'm pursuing a career as a teacher. To be able to change negative perspectives and misconceptions about disability \\u2014\\u00a0to change hearts and minds and make a difference in ways I wish I'd seen more of growing up \\u2014 feels incredible.\\u00a0\", \"I want to continue developing a teaching program that provides meaningful lessons and resources to help my students and colleagues explore disability, advocacy and inclusion.\\u00a0\", \"Ashleigh Gibson is a 24-year-old disability advocate and pre-service teacher who lives in Beckenham, Western Australia.
