But since the natural disasters, foreign aid has come into the country, and even though deliveries have been contactless and supplies have been isolated for three days, the virus has managed its way in.\", \"Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni announced on Tuesday two port workers had tested positive, according to BBC News. Three more cases in family members were later confirmed.\", \"Sovaleni said the nation would go into lockdown Tuesday night and the situation would be assessed every 48 hours. \\\"The most important issue at the moment is to slow down and stop those who have been affected,\\\" he said. No boats will be allowed to travel between islands and there will be no more domestic flights, Sovaleni said, according to BBC News.\", \"Following the eruption\\u00a0\\u2013 which blanketed the nation in toxic ash, poisoned drinking water, destroyed crops and completely wiped out at least two villages \\u2013 and the subsequent tsunami, ships from Australia, New Zealand, the United States, China, France, Fiji and the U.K. have been sent to Tonga to deliver aid.\", \"An Australian warship delivered desperately needed aid this week.
