There were no uncorked bottles or public victory laps. His daily grind of consecutive Zoom meetings continued, unperturbed.\", \"Never mind that this meant the company he started out of his parents\\u2019 Montreal basement in 2003, with the help of his two brothers, would now be one of the most valuable luxury e-commerce operations in the world.\", \"\\u201cIt didn\\u2019t exactly surprise us,\\u201d Mr. Atallah said recently at SSENSE\\u2019s mammoth five-story retail store in the touristy Old Port neighborhood of Montreal. \\u201cThe number was within the range of what we had in mind, but we don\\u2019t see it as the destination for us.\\u201d\", \"The valuation was made by Sequoia Capital, a tech-focused venture capital firm, which had made a minority investment in the platform (and whose amount neither company will disclose).\", \"The valuation figure is the closest thing resembling a boast about SSENSE\\u2019s success to date, and it places it among the ranks of e-commerce conglomerates like YOOX Net-a-Porter Group and Farfetch, though both of those companies are publicly traded.\", \"SSENSE says it will bring in more than $750 million in revenue this year, though that number could not be independently verified, and, until now, has never taken on significant outside investment.\", \"\\u201cModesty,\\u201d of course, is not typically a word that comes to mind when discussing the hype-heavy spheres of designer fashion and street wear, SSENSE\\u2019s foremost offerings.\", \"And although Mr. Atallah, 39, a Palestinian-born immigrant who grew up in Damascus, prefers not to be the face of his company, he has quietly become one of the most influential figures in the fashion industry. He oversees 1,300 employees spread across North America and Europe, alongside his brothers, Firas, 41, the company\\u2019s chief governance office, and Bassel, 37, its chief operations officer.\", \"His appetite for making big bets on emerging designers has turned SSENSE into a tastemaker. Long before designers like Virgil Abloh, Demna Gvasalia and Matthew Williams became superstar stewards of some of the oldest luxury houses in fashion, SSENSE was selling their debut collections. Today, the three occupy top creative spots at Louis Vuitton men\\u2019s wear, Balenciaga and Givenchy.\", \"SSENSE also supported the French designer Marine Serre from the earliest days, when she was still showing her collections in her Paris bedroom. \\u201cIt was really quite special when they came to me,\\u201d Ms. Serre said. \\u201cThey had ideas. They were ready to take risks.\\u201d\", \"Now, nearly two decades after the company was founded, SSENSE has become a destination for Gen Z and millennial consumers of designer clothing and footwear. The platform offers over 70,000 items from more than 700 brands, the company said. It likes to juxtapose high fashion labels like Gucci and Prada, which joined in 2017, against street wear brands such as Noah and Jun Takahashi\\u2019s Undercover.\", \"Even more, SSENSE is the rare retailer perceived as a brand all on its own, a result of Mr. Atallah\\u2019s desire to make his company a \\u201ccultural protagonist.\\u201d It has invested heavily in an editorial platform, overseen by Joerg Koch, the founder of the German fashion magazine 032c, which expanded into a twice-a-year print magazine in 2019.\", \"Collaborations with brands large and small are frequent occurrences, as are lavishly produced cultural events, like the time a replica of Virgil Abloh\\u2019s Chicago studio was built inside of SSENSE\\u2019s retail space, designed by the architect David Chipperfield, or when the experimental producer ARCA staged an elaborate performance, involving vats of fluid, on all five floors.\", \"This summer, Burberry collaborated with the retailer on a capsule collection, codesigned by Peter Saville and Jo Ratcliffe. And as part of the collaboration, Burberry invited SSENSE to add its neoteric polish to its SoHo retail space.\", \"SSENSE is also experimenting with new categories. After experiencing what Mr. Atallah called a \\u201c10 to 20 percent increase in demand\\u201d during the pandemic in 2020, the retailer introduced a new home and lifestyle vertical, Everything Else. The new category is a mix of high-end furniture \\u2014 including Tom Sachs\\u2019s X-chairs, which cost $12,500 each \\u2014 and designer children\\u2019s wear, personal electronics and a pet clothing category featuring designs by Ms. Serre and Heron Preston.\", \"Mr. Atallah described his growing up in Syria as a culture \\u201cvery, very far\\u201d from the world of fashion. Music lessons, French school and competitive tennis occupied the brothers\\u2019 days. Firas, the oldest brother, recalled that as teenagers they were already bristling against the conforming pressures of that society.\", \"\\u201cIt was a bit narrow-minded,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBeing successful meant being a doctor or an engineer, otherwise you\\u2019d be a nobody.\\u201d\", \"Their first brush with Western-designed fashion, Rami Atallah said, came in the form of Nike tennis apparel, specifically the Andre Agassi acid-washed and color-spattered designs their father would bring back from business trips to France. Though Mr. Atallah was an under-14 tennis champion in Syria, whose first ambition was to play at Roland-Garros, his future may have been set when his tennis coach first explained the internet to him.\", \"\\u201cI was like, \\u2018Wow, I want to do that,\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt just sparked my curiosity.\\u201d\", \"After his father, a steel importer, relocated the family to Montreal, Mr. Atallah went on to study computer science at Polytechnique Montreal university, where he first realized the potential of selling clothes online. He began reselling designer jeans, purchased at cost from local retailers, first on eBay and later on an embryonic version of SSENSE that he coded himself for his graduate thesis project.\", \"\\u201cThat was in addition to handling customer service, warehouse picking and packing,\\u201d he said of his workload during the company\\u2019s early first years. \\u201cAt one point, I was the photographer. I know how to retouch product too.\\u201d\", \"Having discovered that high margins could be made selling designer brands like Diesel, Mr. Atallah asked his father for a small loan and enlisted his two brothers to join the operation.\", \"\\u201cWe never doubted him,\\u201d Bassel said in a phone interview, referring to Rami. SSENSE\\u2019s chief operating officer since its founding, Bassel described the first years as being defined by a sense of \\u201ctinkering.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt was about being curious and solving problems,\\u201d he said. \\u201cLike: How do you Photoshop? How do you print labels? How do you describe products? How do you buy it? How do you ship it? And we haven\\u2019t slowed down since.\\u201d\", \"Firas, also on that call, recalled that despite being the chief financial office at the time, he was also responsible for packing and shipping products. \\u201cI would create these huge lines at the post office,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m pretty sure the customers there hated me.\\u201d\", \"SSENSE appears to operate in a world of its own design. Geographically speaking, it does in a sense. Its corporate headquarters are in Montreal\\u2019s sleepy garment district, far from the major fashion capitals of the world. This is exactly as Mr. Atallah likes it. Even today, he\\u2019s loath to admit any degree of insider influence, preferring instead to refer to himself and his team as \\u201cexpert outsiders.\\u201d It\\u2019s a mind-set he maintains, in part, by rarely hiring talent away from competitors.\", \"\\u201cThis is a story about immigrants with zero experience or knowledge about fashion, having to learn everything from scratch,\\u201d Mr. Atallah said one recent morning as he sat in a quiet nook of his retail store. Wearing purple Salomon sneakers and a gray mohair sweater, he spoke softly and evenly as sales associates trickled into the building, a cold space punctuated by a minimalist steel lighting system and black sandblasted concrete walls (a hue customized to Mr. Atallah\\u2019s exacting standards).\", \"\\u201cComing from a completely closed-off world to a place like Canada, experiencing the openness of its culture, has freed us up to see things differently,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSeeing the two extremities has allowed us to open up our horizons on what\\u2019s possible.\\u201d\", \"There have been a few public missteps by the company. Mr. Atallah\\u2019s willingness to experiment with hiring people who lack fashion experience has reportedly led to high turnover among its management team. Some former employees have also said wages at the company are low, compared with peers in the industry.\", \"In 2018, it bought Polyvore, a fashion mood board app, once worth a reported $200 million, and promptly shut it down. SSENSE never explained its logic behind the acquisition, though it did discover a highly vocal community of Polyvore users who were enraged by the sudden disappearance of their platform.\", \"SSENSE quickly published an apology for the \\u201cdistress\\u201d it had caused, and Mr. Atallah issued a measured mea culpa in an interview with Business of Fashion at that time: \\u201cI didn\\u2019t realize the intensity of the relationships being formed on the platform,\\u201d he said. The company could have handled it in a different way, but \\u201cbusiness is about taking risks.\\u201d\", \"Some of SSENSE\\u2019s innovations can be seen inside its 115,000-square-foot offices that are tucked into two floors inside a drab office building on the rue Chabanel. While the majority of the employees were shifted to remote work during the pandemic, about 150 photo and production employees have maintained a frenzied daily churn, uploading roughly 3,000 to 4,000 products onto the platform every week, the company said. SSENSE has 26 photo studios, sequestered behind a door with biometric security, to maintain this volume.\", \"During a recent tour of the headquarters, there was a hushed choreography of discerningly dressed 20-somethings \\u2014 models, stylists, assistants, retouchers and photographers, preparing shots amid racks of newly arrived products. The process is one of SSENSE\\u2019s most closely guarded secrets. (Its photography lighting, for example, is especially guarded, and I was asked not to take photos in the studios, not even for personal notes.)\", \"SSENSE\\u2019s product photos may be the brand\\u2019s most distinctive calling cards. Each item is styled with editorial precision, usually on flinty-faced models, like the kind you may find meandering through Dimes Square in New York City, against open white backgrounds.\", \"\\u201cYou can see an SSENSE photo anywhere on the web, and you know it\\u2019s SSENSE without having seen the logo,\\u201d Mr. Atallah said.\", \"Alexa Lanza, the market director of Interview magazine, often uses SSENSE as a research tool because of its vast selection of products and visual presentation.\", \"\\u201cThey have a very particular eye when it comes to their casting and lighting and styling,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a personality to it, but it\\u2019s not overwhelming to the customer.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYou can tell what the clothes are going to look like on a person,\\u201d she said.\", \"Another example of Mr. Atallah\\u2019s outsider approach is his fixation on data and systematized thinking in an industry \\u2014 the fashion world \\u2014 renowned for its volatility. His favorite creative voices tend to be those with meticulously defined approaches: He cited Rei Kawakubo, Stanley Kubrick, Wes Anderson and Steve Jobs.\", \"Current and former employees said the company resembles a tech firm more than a purveyor of cool clothing, where each decision must be bolstered by numbers. Yet they also said that it\\u2019s an environment where left-brained and right-brained thinking operate in relative harmony.\", \"\\u201cOur growth is a result of our having two strong approaches \\u2014 the art of it and the science of it,\\u201d said Krishna Nikhil, the chief marketing officer. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t blend art and science. If you blend, you get mush. We toggle.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Atallah put it more directly: \\u201cI look at data day in and day out. That\\u2019s what feeds the intuition. Intuition is not just \\u2018I feel like doing it.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The only time Mr. Atallah seems to have acted solely on gut feelings is when he named the company. \\u201cIt just looked good written out, so we went for it,\\u201d he said, explaining that it is a play on the word \\u201cessence.\\u201d (While it may be obvious to some, SSENSE\\u2019s correct pronunciation seems to be a source of bewilderment for many.)\", \"This mode of computer-science thinking, as Eric Hu, SSENSE\\u2019s design director from 2016 to 2018, said, guides every aspect of the company\\u2019s decision making. \\u201cRami has a very clear-cut vision for how things should be,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd he\\u2019s able to make very bold decisions because he requires data and actual intel to prove his hunches.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Hu was brought on to oversee the company\\u2019s rebranding, including a redesign of the website, which today attracts 100 million page views per month, according to the company. The effort came on the heels of SSENSE\\u2019s expansion of its editorial platform, and Mr. Atallah was insistent that visitors to the landing page be greeted not by products, but by cultural content, a blend of essays, fashion editorials and interviews. Mr. Hu was taken aback.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t think it was logical at the time,\\u201d said Mr. Hu, who is now the global design director at Nike. \\u201cIt felt antithetical to the job of making sure product is sold. But now when I look at other websites, it\\u2019s obvious SSENSE has a much more intimate feel. Rami was adamant that even if you didn\\u2019t have money, people should be able to walk away with something from SSENSE. It was a long-term investment that has clearly paid off.\\u201d\", \"SSENSE said its customer base is overwhelmingly between the ages 18 and 40. It\\u2019s a coveted demographic expected to represent more than 70 percent of all consumers of personal luxury goods by 2025, according to recent figures released by Bain & Company.\", \"Charles de Brabant, the executive director of the School of Retail Management at McGill University in Montreal, said that SSENSE\\u2019s relentless attention on its audience sets it apart from competitors like Farfetch and Net-a-Porter.\", \"\\u201cMost brands want to be everything to everybody and dominate every category, but SSENSE is very focused,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey have found a sweet spot that positions them as a very strong niche player. They connect with a special type of consumer.\\u201d\", \"Retail analysts, like Mr. de Brabant, were surprised when news of Sequoia\\u2019s multibillion dollar valuation was announced. SSENSE is still privately held by Mr. Atallah and his brothers, so little financial information about the company has been shared publicly. And the brothers are extremely quiet about their wealth or plans for the company.\", \"What\\u2019s certain is that Mr. Atallah is in the act of placing his largest bet yet: on the Chinese luxury market. Sales of luxury goods in the country doubled in the last year, to $68 billion, according to the same Bain & Company report. And since 2018, SSENSE has been publishing its website in simplified Chinese to help \\u201clocalize\\u201d its offerings.\", \"The recent investment from Sequoia Capital was led by the firm\\u2019s China arm. SSENSE said that its most immediate use for that investment was filling more than 400 new jobs within the next year.\", \"Angelica Cheung, the founder of Vogue China and a partner at Sequoia, helped lead the investment and has recently joined the SSENSE board of directors.\", \"\\u201cYoung Chinese consumers are looking not just for cool products but also guidance on how to style them, to show them some attitude,\\u201d Ms. Cheung said. \\u201cSSENSE is a brand with its own attitude. They know they have style.\\u201d\", \"Style, yes. But will Mr. Atallah admit his newfound influence? Maybe some other time.\", \"\\u201cIt does come up from time to time, but I don\\u2019t pay attention to it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt is, of course, nice to hear compliments.\\u201d\", \"\", \"\"]","href_hash":"f34c1d2c4c8211ec8c95a3d4ab45c753"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f34c1d2c4c8211ec8c95a3d4ab45c753"}},
