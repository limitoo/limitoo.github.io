Her reported disappearance came one day after another migrant was found dead near the border, the latest casualty in a migrant crisis that goes hand in hand with tensions between the European Union and Belarus.\", \"The Border Group, a refugee and human rights organization, believes that the young girl was separated from her parents and went missing on the Polish side of the border after Polish Border Guard officers pushed her parents back into Belarus. Poland's Border Guard agency denied the allegations and claimed that it had not detained any families.\", \"It added that it had conducted both land and air searches to try to find the child after learning the information provided to the nation's human rights commissioner by activists.\", \"Belarus' border with Poland is also its border with the EU. Migrants and refugees have been gathering at the border and attempting to cross into the bloc since the summer, triggering a standoff between the travelers and Poland's security forces.\", \"The EU has accused Belarus of funneling the migrants toward the border to destabilize the EU in retaliation for imposing sanctions against Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko's government, though he has denied the allegations.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947814/belarus-migrant-crisis.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A 4-year-old girl from Iraq is believed to have gone missing in subfreezing weather near Poland's border with Belarus, according to a humanitarian group.
