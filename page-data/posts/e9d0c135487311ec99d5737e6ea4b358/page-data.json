pm on Thursday night,\\u00a0there were\\u00a0no longer density limits at hospitality venues, restrictions of home visits were removed, and masks were no longer\\u00a0required in most settings.\", \"Mr Andrews said the changes were due to Victorians being on track to have 90 per cent of its population aged 12 and over fully vaccinated on Saturday or Sunday.\", \"\\\"You will be able to go back to
