As a company, we don\\u2019t think unions are the best answer for our employees.\\u201d\", \"The ruling comes as a setback to Amazon at a time when its labor model is under increasing scrutiny. In September, California approved a law that would require warehouse employers like Amazon to disclose the productivity quotas that they impose on workers and would prohibit quotas that prevent workers from taking breaks and abiding by health and safety rules.\", \"Earlier this month, the nearly 1.4 million-member International Brotherhood of Teamsters elected a new president who ran on a platform that included aggressive efforts to unionize the company.\", \"The election at the warehouse in Bessemer, Ala., was conducted by mail in February and March. Roughly half of the nearly 6,000 eligible workers cast ballots.\", \"The union filed a formal objection to the election shortly after the results were announced in April, arguing that Amazon had undermined the conditions for a fair election by pressing the Postal Service to install a collection box at the warehouse. The union said the box, which was not authorized by the labor board, created the impression that Amazon was monitoring which workers voted.\", \"Amazon has said that the box was intended to make it easier for employees to vote and that it did not have access to the ballots that workers deposited in it.\", \"The union also argued that Amazon consultants and managers created fear among workers by removing them from mandatory anti-union meetings if they asked skeptical questions and by telling workers they risked loss of pay or benefits, or even their jobs, if they unionized.\", \"In the August recommendation, the labor board\\u2019s hearing officer dismissed many of the union\\u2019s objections in this vein, but the officer found that \\u201cthe employer\\u2019s unilateral decision to create, for all intents and purposes, an on-site collection box for N.L.R.B. ballots destroyed the laboratory conditions\\u201d that are supposed to prevail during a union election.\", \"The hearing officer highlighted the fact that the collection box was surrounded by a tent, on which Amazon printed a campaign message (\\u201cspeak for yourself\\u201d) and a directive to workers to \\u201cmail your ballot here,\\u201d and that the tent appeared to be in view of Amazon\\u2019s surveillance cameras.\", \"This setup \\u201cusurped\\u201d the labor board\\u2019s role in overseeing the vote and \\u201cso tainted the election that a second election is necessary,\\u201d the officer concluded.\"]","href_hash":"32004da1515a11ec8acd2f3ef0ab59c3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"32004da1515a11ec8acd2f3ef0ab59c3"}},
