Filmed over five years in five separate countries, \\u201cSimple as Water\\u201d is anything but simple when it comes to its technical achievements, weaving together familiar immigrant narratives in ways that still manage to surprise and stun.\", \"The film is book ended by vignettes featuring Yasmin, a mother of four living in a refugee camp near the dockyards of Athens, who is fighting to reunite her children with their father in Germany. Her story provides an optimistic through line for Mylan\\u2019s other subjects, who offer a much more devastating and uncertain look at the struggles of trying to build a new life in an unfamiliar place. In Turkey, a single mother with no time to care for her children attempts to take them to an orphanage, but her eldest son \\u2014 a 12-year-old who has assumed the role of caretaker while she\\u2019s at work \\u2014 steadfastly refuses to go.\", \"In Pennsylvania, a delivery man named Omar applies for asylum for himself and his teenage brother.
