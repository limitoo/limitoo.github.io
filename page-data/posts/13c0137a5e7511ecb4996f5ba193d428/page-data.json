Then everything changes. Unhappy and introspective, he looks for new meaning and purpose, and by the end has embarked on a nascent career as a filmmaker.\", \"The movie, which began streaming on Netflix on Wednesday, is being mentioned as a contender for best international feature at next year\\u2019s Oscars, the award Sorrentino won in 2013 with \\u201cThe Great Beauty.\\u201d \\u201cThe Hand of God\\u201d also marks the director\\u2019s return to his hometown for the first time since his 2001 debut, \\u201cOne Man Up.\\u201d Writing in The New York Times, A.O. Scott called \\u201cThe Hand of God\\u201d \\u201ca beautiful tautology: a true-to-life movie about a life made for movies.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhen I was younger, I was very skeptical about any attempt to make an autobiographical film,\\u201d Sorrentino, 51, said, speaking in Italian through a translator. \\u201cI started thinking about this 10 years ago, when I realized that my own life experience could be cinematic.\\u201d\", \"He spent years gathering memories about his family, friends and parents, he said, before writing the screenplay in his typical process: very fast, taking \\u201cnot longer than two weeks,\\u201d using the notes on the facts, ideas and characters, and possible dialogues that took years to accumulate. \\u201cI have to have 3,000 ideas, then skim down until I have the cream,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cThe Hand of God\\u201d was no more difficult to write, he added, than any other script, apart from the psychological issue of \\u201cmy own shyness and secretiveness.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not a secret that I chose a profession behind, not in front of, the camera,\\u201d he said.\", \"Filippo Scotti, the 21-year-old Italian actor who plays Fabietto, said that he had prepared for the role by asking Sorrentino what music he had listened to and which films he had watched as a teenager.\", \"\\u201cThe first day of the shoot, I remember I did a scene about 15 times. Then I thought, I am focusing on Paolo\\u2019s life, and I need to focus on Fabietto\\u2019s life. After that, it was easier,\\u201d Scotti said. \\u201cTo have the thought, \\u2018I am playing him\\u2019 \\u2014 it\\u2019s a kind of nightmare!\\u201d\", \"Although the film is based on the events of Sorrentino\\u2019s youth, and his memories of \\u201980s Naples, it is also partly fictional, the director said. \\u201cWhen I write, I start believing my own lies, to the point when I\\u2019m no longer able to distinguish between what is true and false,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWatching the film again last night here in Naples, I realized how many lies it contains.\\u201d\", \"The movie opens with a mysterious encounter between a beautiful woman (Luisa Ranieri) at a bus stop, and a man who claims he is San Gennaro, the patron saint of Naples. (The other, unofficial patron saint of Naples is the Argentine soccer star Diego Maradona; the movie\\u2019s title refers to his description of a goal he scored in the 1986 World Cup.)\", \"The surreal, hallucinatory images of that opening sequence, including the portrayal of a mythical figure called the Little Monk, which echo throughout the film, are techniques that are characteristic of Sorrentino\\u2019s work, but also, he said, tropes that are deeply true to his hometown.\", \"\\u201cIn Naples, the dogma of Catholicism is somehow structured upon a very imaginative and fantastical creativity,\\u201d Sorrentino said. \\u201cGod is too far away and so you pray to your dead parents and Maradona and saints who feel close to you.\\u201d\", \"These extraordinary images and conjunctions are what distinguish Sorrentino as a filmmaker, said Toni Servillo, who plays Fabietto\\u2019s father in \\u201cThe Hand of God\\u201d and has starred in five other Sorrentino movies, including \\u201cThe Great Beauty.\\u201d\", \"Sorrentino has \\u201cthe gift of creating visuals, images, situations that are completely surprising,\\u201d Servillo said in a video interview. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the ability of a unique artist; to suggest something you have never thought of.\\u201d\", \"Jude Law, who worked with Sorrentino on both \\u201cThe Young Pope\\u201d and \\u201cThe New Pope,\\u201d said that the director would spend a long time looking for \\u201cthe right way\\u201d to shoot a scene. \\u201cHe creates beautiful and elegant camera moves,\\u201d he said, \\u201cwhich are so effective for an actor, because you understand where he is putting his eye, where an audience is looking.\\u201d\", \"Sorrentino said that he became passionate about film at the age of 17 or 18. \\u201cI thought it must be beautiful to do something that combined music, images, stories,\\u201d he said, though at the time he was studying economics at university and his family had very little interest in art or culture. But he began to volunteer on films that came to shoot in Naples, and he met the celebrated director Antonio Capuano (played in \\u201cThe Hand of God\\u201d by Ciro Capano) \\u201cjust as it happens in the movie.\\u201d\", \"He began to write screenplays, and won an award for \\u201cOne Man Up.\\u201d \\u201cWe found the small amount of money needed to make a film,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was an obsession to do it.\\u201d\", \"Sorrentino has written his own screenplays ever since, and his subjects have ranged widely, including politics, via the Italian prime ministers Giulio Andreotti (\\u201cIl Divo\\u201d) and Silvio Berlusconi (\\u201cLoro\\u201d); Catholicism, in the HBO series \\u201cThe Young Pope\\u201d and \\u201cThe New Pope; and the state of Italy, seen through the eyes of a world-weary journalist, Jep Gambardella, in \\u201cThe Great Beauty.\\u201d\", \"Servillo said that \\u201cThe Hand of God\\u201d reminded him \\u201cof the simplicity, the immediate emotions that were so typical of \\u2018One Man Up,\\u2019 the first film we shot together,\\u201d but that over the years, what had improved was Sorrentino\\u2019s \\u201cability as a writer, the invention of character and the brilliance of the dialogues.\\u201d\", \"The script was the principal source for character, said Teresa Saponangelo, who plays Fabietto\\u2019s mother in the film. \\u201cPaolo said very little about his mother, other than that she was very funny, a prankster and full of life,\\u201d Saponangelo said, adding that she had inferred the many years of her character\\u2019s suppressed pain over her husband\\u2019s affair, expressed in a startling scene midway through the movie.\", \"\\u201cPaolo isn\\u2019t the kind of director who tells you to use a specific tone or express an emotion,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe builds the scaffolding, then you move alone with the freedom and trust he gives you.\\u201d\", \"One lesson Sorrentino will take from \\u201cThe Hand of God,\\u201d he said, is \\u201ca new way of telling stories that is simpler and brings about decent results.\\u201d After nine films, he added, \\u201cyou become bored with what you are familiar with, it becomes mannered.\\u201d\", \"Asked whether making the film had been therapeutic, Sorrentino said he thought so.
