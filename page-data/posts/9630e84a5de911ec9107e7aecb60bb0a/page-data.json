Then, she shared a story of how she was standing in what was formerly Baize's bedroom, packing anything that could be salvaged.\", \"Then, she \\\"heard the most beautiful sound.\\\" It was music.\", \"She walked to discover her brother sitting at a piano, playing There's Something About That Name by Bill and Gloria Gaither. She filmed him playing in a space that used to be surrounded by walls and a roof.\", \"\\\"Everything around him was broken,\\\" Brown wrote. \\\"The piano had water damage, it had missing keys, and he didn't know I was filming. But still he used his gift to glorify his God the best way he knew how.\\\"\", \"Her post has been liked over 51,000 times and shared over 95,000 times.

As for surviving the severe weather, he said he was with his family when he received an urgent text alert.\", \"\\\"We immediately went to the basement,\\\" Baize said. \\\"I'm glad that we did. Mattress over our heads, in the middle of the basement floor. It was loud, but it was also quick.\\\"\", \"Baize summarized his feelings to the news station in one word after surviving the tornado: thankfulness.\", \"\\\"What was meant to be a private, reflective moment seems to have brought peace and perspective to many,\\\" Baize said in a Facebook post. \\\"Only God can do it, folks. I am honored to have had the opportunity to share my faith with so many in such a difficult time. I'm still praying for our precious little community. Would you join me?\\\"\"]","href_hash":"9630e84a5de911ec9107e7aecb60bb0a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9630e84a5de911ec9107e7aecb60bb0a"}},
