But in a book published in 2017, \\u201cThe Blood of Emmett Till\\u201d by Timothy B. Tyson, the author wrote that Ms. Donham had recanted her testimony in a 2008 interview, saying that the earlier stories she told were \\u201cnot true.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cNothing that boy did could ever justify what happened to him,\\u201d Mr. Tyson, a researcher and historian at Duke University, quoted Ms. Donham as saying in the book.\", \"Mr. Tyson\\u2019s claim generated outrage and renewed calls for the case to be reopened. Kristen Clarke, who leads the Justice Department\\u2019s civil rights division, delivered the news to the family in person that the case was formally closed.\", \"In a statement on Monday, the Justice Department said Mr. Tyson, despite saying he had recorded two interviews with Ms. Donham, provided just one recording to the F.B.I. that did not contain a recantation.\", \"Mr. Tyson has said that although he did not record Ms. Donham\\u2019s recantation, he took detailed notes.\", \"\\u201cCarolyn started spilling the beans before I got the recorder going. I documented her words carefully,\\u201d Mr. Tyson said in an email on Monday, adding, \\u201cMy reporting is rock solid.\\u201d\", \"At a news conference in Chicago on Monday afternoon, Emmett\\u2019s family members said they were disappointed by the result of the investigation but were not surprised.\", \"\\u201cI did not expect that they would have found any new evidence,\\u201d said Ollie Gordon, one of Emmett\\u2019s cousins, adding, \\u201cI ask where do we go from here.\\u201d\", \"The Rev. Wheeler Parker Jr., Emmett\\u2019s cousin and best friend who was in the Mississippi Delta house when Emmett was kidnapped in the middle of the night, said the conclusion of the investigation marked the end of a painful 66 years for Emmett\\u2019s loved ones.\", \"\\u201cToday is a day that we will never forget,\\u201d he said. \\u201cFor 66 years we have suffered pain for his loss, and I suffered tremendously because of the way that they painted him.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Donham, 87, has rarely spoken publicly about the case. Her former husband and another man confessed to Emmett\\u2019s murder, though the confessions came after they were acquitted by an all-white jury. Both men are dead.\", \"In the summer of 1955, 14-year-old Emmett traveled from Chicago to the Mississippi Delta to visit relatives. One day in August, he walked into a store in Money, Miss., run by Ms. Donham and her husband, Roy Bryant, to buy candy. Accounts vary about what happened, but a witness said that Emmett whistled at Ms. Donham.\", \"Days later, Mr. Bryant and his half brother abducted, tortured and shot the teenager. Then they tied a 75-pound cotton gin fan around his neck and tossed his body into a river. His corpse, broken, battered and mutilated, was retrieved from the water on the last day of August.\", \"Mamie Till, Emmett\\u2019s mother, insisted on an open coffin for the funeral and allowed photographs to be published in Jet magazine \\u2014 ensuring that \\u201cthe whole nation had to bear witness\\u201d to what is considered among the worst hate crimes of the 20th century.\", \"Despite the passage of time and the civil rights movement, Emmett\\u2019s death has never faded from public memory. It has often been invoked as an enduring symbol of deep, unbridled racism. Historic markers erected at sites connected to his death have repeatedly been vandalized. The marker near the river where his body was found has been replaced at least three times because it has been vandalized and damaged by bullets.\", \"\\u201cMississippi has never escaped the story of Emmett Till and nor should it,\\u201d said Susan Glisson, who worked with the town of Sumner, Miss., which issued a public apology and formed the Emmett Till Memorial Commission.\", \"In closing its investigation, the Justice Department said that Ms. Donham denied ever recanting her earlier testimony. In 2018, Ms. Donham\\u2019s daughter-in-law, Marsha Holley Bryant, who was present for the interviews with Mr. Tyson, said that Ms. Donham never recanted.\", \"Reached by phone on Monday, Ms. Holley Bryant said she had no comment. Other relatives of Ms. Donham did not respond to several requests for comment.\", \"Before the current investigation, federal officials last revisited the case in 2004. They closed it two years later after prosecutors determined that the statute of limitations kept them from pursuing additional federal charges. As part of that inquiry, Emmett\\u2019s body was exhumed.\", \"The latest investigation was part of the Justice Department\\u2019s larger review of cases believed to be motivated by racial hatred. Over the past 15 years, the department has led several successful investigations, including the prosecution of Edgar Ray Killen. Mr. Killen, who died in prison about four years ago, was a former Klansman who arranged the murders of three civil workers in Mississippi in 1964.\", \"\\u201cCold cases never close,\\u201d said Keith Beauchamp, a filmmaker and producer of \\u201cThe Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till\\u201d and the upcoming film \\u201cTill.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere still may be a way,\\u201d he continued, \\u201cto revisit one of the greatest injustices committed upon a child in American history.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"54e09f8c56eb11ec8b8e25c00da31604"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"54e09f8c56eb11ec8b8e25c00da31604"}},
