In the background, a student could be heard telling the driver to calm down.\", \"While it is unclear what started the altercation, which occurred at Greater Latrobe High School, the bus driver appeared to yell at a specific student in the videos.\", \"\\\"I don't care who else you have, I don't put up with it,\\\" the driver yelled. \\\"You're in a world of trouble girl. I don't care who it was.\\\"\", \"The student then yelled back that they didn't do anything before the driver said she better \\\"rat out\\\" the student who was responsible, but it is unclear what the driver was referring to.\", \"As the students continued arguing with the driver, he replied that he was \\\"old enough to swear\\\" and that he would not open the door to let the students off the bus.\", \"\\\"Bruh you slammed on the brakes and cracked all our necks and gave us a bloody nose,\\\" one student said to the driver.\", \"\\\"I don't care what I did!\\\" the driver yelled back.\", \"Some students told the driver to calm down but he yelled back that he would not calm down because the students \\\"started it.\\\"\", \"In another video, an adult with a lanyard, presumably staff or an administrator, stood at the front of the bus to oversee the situation as the driver said that the students were \\\"the worst kids\\\" he ever picked up.\", \"\\\"You guys want respect? You're gonna earn it!\\\" the driver yelled at the students as he looked at them through the rearview mirror.\", \"The adult in the video then asked the students to please sit down but multiple students replied that they didn't feel safe on the bus with the driver.
