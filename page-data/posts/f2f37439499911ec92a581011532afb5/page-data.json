And then even after we [qualify for the ballot], there will be more lawsuits.\\\"\", \"\\\"Millionaires, really must not want to support Arizona students in schools,\\\" he added.\", \"The Arizona Free Enterprise Club, a conservative pro-business group, filed lawsuits against the legality of the signatures and referendum. The group's attorneys pointed out that referrals for measures that give \\\"support and maintenance\\\" of state government are prohibited, arguing that tax cut bills would be under this rule.\", \"In reply, the coalition's lawyers said that that rule only applies to bills that raise taxes, not decreases them. No ruling has been given in the case.\", \"Over 118,000 signatures were required to block the measure. Those opposed to the tax cuts managed to file around 220,000 signatures. The Secretary of State's office denied a little over 10,700. Overall, the signatures were found to have a validity rate of over 78 percent by the state's county recorders.\", \"The repeal of the tax cuts will be on the November 2022 ballot as Proposition 307 if it holds against the lawsuits.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937033/doug-ducey-tax-cuts-opposition.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Those who opposed tax cuts by Arizona Governor Doug Ducey gathered about 220,000 signatures in hopes of putting the measure to a vote in November 2022.

The vast majority of the tax relief goes to high-earning Arizonans, although proponents say all taxpayers will see some decrease in income taxes.\", \"Education advocates failed to collect enough signatures to block two other tax cut bills enacted by the legislature this year. One creates a new exemption for small business income that would have been subject to a voter-approved surcharge, and another shields high-earning Arizona taxpayers from the same 3.5 percent surcharge approved by voters last year when they passed Proposition 208.\", \"The state Supreme Court in August ruled a part of Proposition 208 that exempts the new revenue from a cap on school spending is unconstitutional, but more legal proceedings will be needed to determine if the entire law will be thrown out.\", \"Arizona's constitution allows voters to block new legislation by collecting signatures from 5 percent of the people who voted in the past general election. If they do, the law is put on hold until voters decide at the next general election.\"]","href_hash":"f2f37439499911ec92a581011532afb5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f2f37439499911ec92a581011532afb5"}},
