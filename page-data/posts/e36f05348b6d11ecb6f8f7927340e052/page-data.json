But I find its retro sweetness irresistible, especially when it\\u2019s done right, with French toast, strong cocktails, fudgy desserts and homemade Valentines. \", \"I don\\u2019t yet know what I\\u2019m making this year, aside from Genevieve Ko\\u2019s new flourless chocolate cake. What I do know is that it doesn\\u2019t have to be expensive or take a lot of time. It just needs to be tailored to the one(s) you love, and what they love. Does that mean nachos? French-bread pizza? Stuffed shells? Tacos al pastor? Bulgogi? Buttermilk roast chicken? Coconut curry fish? I think one of the best dinners for two is shrimp cocktail with a big salad and a baguette on the side. Do not forget drinks. \", \"We have tons of Valentine\\u2019s Day recipes for you, and Eric Kim also wrote a wonderful menu for two that you can cook with your sweetie, complete with cute individual beef Wellingtons. Oh yeah, there is also a huge football game on Sunday: There are recipes for the Super Bowl over this way. And I\\u2019m here at dearemily@nytimes.com for your questions or requests. \", \"Risotto\\u2019s luxurious, creamy texture makes it feel fancy, and that it requires a lot of attention at the stove makes its appearances rare. But Hetty McKinnon bakes this recipe, which eliminates the constant stirring; she also uses Thai curry paste and coconut milk to make a dish that is enormously flavorful, creamy and vegan, too. \", \"View this recipe.\", \"I rarely eat steak, and so when I do, I want it to be great. This simple recipe by Mark Bittman qualifies, a marriage of smart technique and superb flavor. You\\u2019ll need a martini as well, and maybe mashed potatoes on the side. \", \"View this recipe.\", \"Few things say romance like vodka sauce and a bottle of red wine. This recipe from Colu Henry delivers. Much of the alcohol cooks off here, but if you\\u2019re concerned about the vodka and still want the vibe, try fettuccine Alfredo instead, or this easy one-pot pasta with ricotta and lemon.\", \"View this recipe.\", \"These pork chops, from Toni Tipton-Martin\\u2019s essential cookbook \\u201cJubilee,\\u201d are served in a bright and buttery lemon sauce, with hot sauce stirred in as a finishing touch.

Use shrimp that still has the shells on \\u2014\\u00a0they bring extra flavor to this simple, spicy stew, packed with greens and ideal for sopping up with rice or crusty bread. \", \"View this recipe.\", \"Thanks for reading and cooking.
