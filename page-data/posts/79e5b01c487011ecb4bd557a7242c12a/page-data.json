Soon after her nomination, bank lobbyists began an unusually strident campaign against her, echoing critics who cited her birthplace \\u2014 Kazakhstan, a former Soviet republic \\u2014 as a reason to question her loyalty to the United States.\", \"Bankers claimed that her academic writing proved that she was poised to replace the banking system with a government-run alternative. Even members of the Senate Banking Committee, where Ms. Omarova is set to appear, joined in questioning her views: The committee\\u2019s highest-ranking Republican, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, repeatedly demanded to see Ms. Omarova\\u2019s master\\u2019s thesis to check it for Marxist ideas.\", \"In a prepared opening statement posted on the Senate Banking Committee website on Wednesday, Ms. Omarova cast her background in the opposite light. She grew up, she said, with a grandmother who was orphaned when Stalin sent her family to Siberia for refusing to join the Communist Party.\", \"She described the government during her childhood as an \\u201coppressive state-run system, with no free enterprise and no economic opportunity for people like me.\\u201d Her ultimate dream, she said, became \\u201ccoming to America \\u2014 the land of opportunity and freedom.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Omarova also vowed to \\u201cguarantee a fair and competitive market where small and midsize banks that invest in their neighbors\\u2019 homes and small businesses can thrive.\\u201d She added that her mission would include \\u201cpreserving and fostering the relationship banking that drives economic growth and creates local jobs and prosperity.\\u201d Twice in the remarks, Ms. Omarova pointed out that she had worked for a Republican president, George W. Bush.\", \"If confirmed, Ms. Omarova would lead the regulator that banks are looking to for clarity on how they can participate in cryptocurrency markets, as well as how they can more successfully compete with nonbank financial technology companies, or fintechs. She would most likely have to draft new rules for the decades-old anti-redlining law, the Community Reinvestment Act, and would be expected to help carry out Mr. Biden\\u2019s stated mission to get the financial industry to help combat economic inequality and climate change.\", \"The hearing on Thursday is only the first of several hurdles Ms. Omarova must clear. The committee will later vote on her nomination, and if it is approved there, it would face a full Senate vote.\"]","href_hash":"79e5b01c487011ecb4bd557a7242c12a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"79e5b01c487011ecb4bd557a7242c12a"}},
