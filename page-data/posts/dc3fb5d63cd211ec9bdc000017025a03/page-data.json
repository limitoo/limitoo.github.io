The problem is not so much Mr. Biden\\u2019s absolute performance, it\\u2019s the president\\u2019s performance relative to expectations.\", \"Mr. Biden raised the hope of being a transformational president like Franklin D. Roosevelt, and he has not delivered. The Covid-19 crisis is receding, but it\\u2019s far from over. The economy is not in recession, but it\\u2019s not booming either. Inflation, especially the highly visible grocery and gasoline prices, is in a mini-surge.\", \"These phenomena are reflected in one striking statistic in a recent poll. More than 70 percent of Americans feel that our country is moving in the wrong direction.\", \"Mr. Biden was not elected for his promise of a super-progressive far-left agenda. He was elected as the anti-Trump and to bring stability and normalcy back to America. We\\u2019re not there yet, and Tuesday\\u2019s election results reflect that.\", \"Ken DerowSwarthmore, Pa.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"As disappointing as Terry McAuliffe\\u2019s performance in the Virginia governor race was, it could well turn out to be a blessing in disguise. It should spur Democrats to take a close and serious look at how, where and why they failed and, with a bit of luck and a lot of hard work, turn it into a winning strategy for the 2022 and 2024 elections.\", \"If that happens, Mr. McAuliffe will have earned his laurels in the Democratic Party.\", \"Zvi J. DoronPittsburgh\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Thank you, Progressive Caucus; you\\u2019ve just lost us Democrats at least one important governorship. You\\u2019ve handicapped the entire party with your arrogance and shortsightedness.\", \"You don\\u2019t always get what you want when you don\\u2019t have a mandate, and a 50-50 Senate and a narrow House majority are not close to a mandate.\", \"Speaker Nancy Pelosi should have put the bipartisan infrastructure bill up for a vote months ago, and we would have had a victory. She and President Biden look weak, incompetent and hamstrung by the progressives, who for some reason are in charge even though the country elected a center-left candidate instead of Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren.\", \"They had all better turn it around before the midterms, but I\\u2019m not optimistic.\", \"Julie Braverman BrunoBrookline, Mass.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Of the many explanations being suggested for the election of a Republican as Virginia\\u2019s governor, and the many suggestions being offered to Democrats as to how they should now proceed, perhaps these things are worth considering:\", \"(1) It appears likely that Virginia voters may have been more concerned with issues like education and the economy than with conducting a referendum on President Biden versus Donald Trump.\", \"(2) The voters expressed no particular admiration for Mr. Trump but rather expressed support for rational approaches to issues of importance to them.\", \"One message for Democrats may be that they should make some renewed effort to prevail on Republicans in Congress to work with them on issues of genuine importance to voters, such as those embodied in the infrastructure legislation, rather than feeling any necessity to follow Mr. Trump slavishly.\", \"Perhaps there are at least some Republican senators who may agree, allowing something to be achieved of legitimate benefit to the country. Perhaps they might also consider voting rights in the process.\", \"Jerold LaxAnn Arbor, Mich.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cChildren\\u2019s Beating Deaths Expose City\\u2019s Lapses\\u201d (front page, Oct. 27):\", \"True, it keeps happening. Julissia Batties. Aisyn Emerson-Gonzalez. Jayce Eubanks. Legacy Beauford. All of these children were under the age of 8 and beaten to death at home. Undoubtedly, children deserve to have the circumstances that surround their deaths understood, but the adult violence that ended their lives is just the tipping point.\", \"The overreliance on the Administration for Children\\u2019s Services to ensure that poor children are safe and thriving is based on flawed assumptions \\u2014 that the broader society is fair and that correcting the behavior of parents deemed to have failed their children is primary. There was no one moment that would have prevented tragedy in these cases. They reflect a systemic breakdown.\", \"If we continue to disregard the inadequate child care options, neglected neighborhoods, poor housing and tenuous financial circumstances that burden some families, we will continue to fail families. So as we prepare to usher in a new mayoral administration in New York City, let\\u2019s summon a renewed sense of political will and boldness to holistically advance efforts that truly keep children safe and families thriving.\", \"Benita MillerAnne Williams-IsomLeah HillMs. Miller is a former deputy commissioner at the Administration for Children\\u2019s Services.
