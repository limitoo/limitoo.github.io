The company has pointed out that when its emissions are measured relative to its booming sales, its carbon footprint has been decreasing. But some climate experts say this calculation, called carbon intensity, obscures that the company is still generating an increasing amount of carbon.\", \"\\u201cThe planet doesn\\u2019t care about carbon intensity,\\u201d said Roland Geyer, a professor of industrial ecology at the University of California, Santa Barbara. \\u201cThe climate is being hurt by absolute emissions.\\u201d\", \"The actions taken by Amazon came after pressure from employees for the company step up its efforts in addressing climate change. That has included calls that the company stop offering custom cloud-computing services that help the oil and gas industry find and extract fossil fuels, and that it cease giving campaign donations to politicians who deny that climate change is happening.\", \"The pledge that Mr. Bezos made on Monday is part of a philanthropic effort by the Bezos Earth Fund, to which he committed $10 billion last year.\", \"Mr. Bezos, who recently made headlines by flying in a spacecraft built by his rocket company, Blue Origin, called the loss of Earth\\u2019s forests \\u201ca profound and urgent danger to us all.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIn too many parts of the world, nature is already flipping from carbon sink to a carbon source,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Bezos has joined an international push to safeguard at least 30 percent of Earth\\u2019s lands and waters by 2030, known as 30x30.\", \"The plan, led by Britain, Costa Rica and France, is intended to help tackle a global biodiversity crisis that puts a million species of plants and animals at risk of extinction. While climate change is part of the problem, activities like farming and fishing have been even bigger drivers of biodiversity loss.\", \"The 30x30 plan would try to slow that by protecting intact natural areas like old-growth forests and wetlands, which not only nurture biodiversity, but also store carbon and filter water.\"]","href_hash":"c6c4786a3bd111ec9adc000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c6c4786a3bd111ec9adc000017025a03"}},
