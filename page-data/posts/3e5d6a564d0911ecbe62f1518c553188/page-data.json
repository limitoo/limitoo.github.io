On Tuesday, a Missouri judge exonerated Strickland and ordered his immediate release after a three-day hearing requested by Jackson County Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker, who said evidence used to convict had been recanted or disproven.\", \"\\\"Clear and convincing evidence\\\" was presented that \\\"undermines the Court's confidence in the judgement of conviction,\\\" Judge James Welsh wrote in his judgement.\", \"No physical evidence connected Strickland to the crime scene, the judge noted, a key eyewitness recanted before her death, and two other men convicted in the killings later said Strickland was not involved.\", \"\\\"Under these unique circumstances, the Court's confidence in Strickland's conviction is so undermined that it cannot stand, and the judgment of conviction must be set aside,\\\" Welsh wrote.\", \"Despite serving the longest prison time for a wrongful conviction in Missouri's history, Strickland, now aged 62, does not qualify for compensation from the state, which only allows payments to people exonerated through DNA evidence.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939296/kevin-strickland.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Kevin Strickland managed a smile while talking to the media after his release from prison, Tuesday, Nov. 23, 2021, in Cameron, Missouri. </div>\", \"\\\"For those that have been wrongfully convicted, the agony of prison life and the complete loss of freedom are only compounded by the feelings of what might have been,\\\" Strickland's lawyer Tricia Rojo Bushnell, the executive director of the Midwest Innocence Project, wrote on a GoFundMe page that was set up for Strickland in June.\", \"\\\"Deprived for years of family and friends and the ability to establish oneself professionally, the nightmare does not end upon release. With no money, housing, transportation, health services or insurance, and a criminal record that is rarely cleared despite innocence, the punishment lingers long after innocence has been proven.\\\"\", \"The state of Missouri has \\\"robbed him of his youth, his health, and much of his life's potential.

By early Wednesday, the total raised was more than $230,000.\", \"\\\"Thank you all for your support!\\\" Rojo Bushnell tweeted Tuesday along with a link to the fundraiser. \\\"All funds go directly to Mr. Strickland, who the state of Missouri won't provide a dime to for the 43 years they stole...\\\"\", \"Rojo Bushnell has been contacted for additional comment.\"]","href_hash":"3e5d6a564d0911ecbe62f1518c553188"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3e5d6a564d0911ecbe62f1518c553188"}},
