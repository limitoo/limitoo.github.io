It’s “girl gaze” makeup.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-09T00:25:20.000Z","content":"[\"Sarah Weingartz, 18, became a makeup expert during her senior year of high school. Her days were spent in Zoom classes and at a part-time job at McDonald\\u2019s, and her nights on FaceTime, where she would connect with two classmates, usually around midnight, put on a bunch of eye shadow and lipstick, wipe it off and then go to sleep.\", \"During the thick of quarantine, Ms. Weingartz, who never wore makeup prepandemic, stocked up on vibrant pencils, powders and palettes. She studied cat-eye techniques from Kall Me Kris, a.k.a., Kris Collins, a Canadian TikToker with more than 40 million followers, and experimented with blue shadow and eyeliner, now staples in her growing makeup collection.\", \"\\u201cI started with a basic wing and got more and more fancy as it went on,\\u201d Ms. Weingartz said of her eyeliner journey. \\u201cIt snowballed from there.\\u201d\", \"Now she draws an exaggerated wing that \\u201cswoops up\\u201d and extends beyond the outer corner of her eye and uses white liner on her waterline to make her eyes \\u201cpop.\\u201d When she feels like it, she smudges on some red or blue eye shadow.\", \"This is what the new way to wear makeup is all about.\", \"After years of romanticizing \\u201cno-makeup makeup,\\u201d a catchall for the products to give the illusion of a \\u201cbare\\u201d (yet perfect) face, people are opting for self-expression as they weigh their appearance in a largely post-lockdown world. Many are back to socializing, eating out, vacationing, going to the office, events and, soon, holiday parties, and they\\u2019re hungry for ways to express their individuality.\", \"The pandemic is one of few experiences that affected people all at once at a global scale. Those who were trapped at home, reduced to three inches of real estate on video calls, are now looking to identify or showcase themselves as special or unique. Makeup is one of the most approachable, affordable ways to do that, and it gives the opportunity, at its purest form, to be an artist with a blank canvas and a paintbrush.\", \"\\u201cThere is a huge collision of cultural trends that are affecting the reinvention of makeup,\\u201d said Sam Cheow, the global head of makeup innovation, portfolio and product development of the Est\\u00e9e Lauder Companies, including lockdowns, social media, Gen Z and a more discerning shopper. \\u201cPeople hate to be told that \\u2018this is the trend.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s why the pandemic ignited a makeup rebirth in terms of how we apply it, the products and colors we use, and our attitudes toward beauty. Modern makeup is meant to reflect what\\u2019s going on inside; it isn\\u2019t about looking hot or as if you\\u2019re not wearing any at all \\u2014 it\\u2019s colorful, expressive, imperfect and meant to be seen.\", \"According to 1010data, which analyzes consumer habits, online makeup sales in the United States (lip, eye and face categories combined) have increased by 29 percent in 2021, compared with 2019.\", \"\\u201cPeople are coming to the realization that makeup is a way to celebrate your femininity and personality,\\u201d said Violette Serrat, a makeup artist and the founder of Violette_Fr. \\u201cIt\\u2019s finally happening.\\u201d\", \"So what will makeup look like and how will we wear it?\", \"After years of perfecting imperceptible makeup, the kind designed to conceal, contour and highlight, something new is afoot. It\\u2019s not a heavy-handed, complicated look that demands a 35-shade eye shadow palette and a 30-minute YouTube tutorial. Nor is it the kind of makeup which, like shapewear, you\\u2019re not supposed to see but which is quietly rearranging your body into something more palatable for men.\", \"\\u201cA \\u2018no-makeup makeup\\u2019 look implies that you\\u2019re trying to cover up something,\\u201d said Maria Salcedo, the senior vice president for merchandising at Ulta Beauty. The store is phasing out the term.\", \"Enter \\u201cgirl gaze\\u201d makeup, a new middle ground that\\u2019s expressive yet still simple in its application and, most important, wearable. A single wash of metallic pink shadow over the entire lid or blue eye \\u201cpaint\\u201d used as liner doesn\\u2019t require much time (or skill).\", \"It\\u2019s not revolutionary, but it is an evolution of the painstakingly pink Glossier era. Dewy-faced teens and millennials still want to look dewy but with twinkling yellow-gold liquid eye shadow. Real skin is in; the full-coverage foundation of the contouring heyday \\u2014 which took place, roughly, between 2015 and 2019 \\u2014 is out.\", \"Doniella Davy, the makeup designer for HBO\\u2019s \\u201cEuphoria,\\u201d believes makeup should be something you wear for yourself, she said, not because you feel pressure to contour your nose or cheeks to give the illusion of perfect bone structure (although that\\u2019s perfectly fine, too).\", \"She urges people to think about makeup less \\u201ccorrectively.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere is a world where you can wear the pink eye shadow and not do the concealer,\\u201d Ms. Davy said.\", \"Mascara, eyeliner, eyebrow enhancers, false lashes and eye shadow are a bright spot for beauty. The eyes are the only visible part of the face in a mask, but they\\u2019re also the feature that allows for the most expression and creativity.\", \"\\u201cThere is this inner urge to peacock out somewhere,\\u201d said Shireen Jiwan, the founder and chief executive of Sleuth Brand Consulting. \\u201cMaybe we\\u2019re not willing to peacock in three-inch heels, but we are in a blue eye shadow.\\u201d\", \"Overall, online eye makeup sales in the United States have been 47 percent higher in 2021 than in 2019, according to 1010data. That\\u2019s more than double the rise in sales in the lip or face categories in the same time period.\", \"Search terms reflect the trend, too. 1010data looked at the top terms leading to a beauty purchase on Amazon. Last year \\u201cface wash\\u201d and \\u201cshampoo\\u201d were the most searched for items. Now \\u201cmascara\\u201d and \\u201cgel nail polish\\u201d are the No. 1 and 2 searches leading to a beauty purchase.\", \"\\u201cNow is the time to be seen,\\u201d said Tereza Kurbasa, 41, an administrative assistant in Melbourne, Australia. \\u201cEveryone is going to go crazy.\\u201d She celebrated the end of Melbourne\\u2019s sixth lockdown with shimmery eye shadow and lunch with friends, her first time in a restaurant in months.\", \"A pink eye was the epicenter of a \\u201cflirty and fun\\u201d weekend makeup look Ms. Kurbasa planned far in advance using Milk Makeup Color Chalk in Skip It, Flower Beauty eye shadow palette in Bloom, KVD Beauty liquid liner and MCoBeauty mascara.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t get the chance to add my LoveSeen lashes, but they will be used hopefully soon,\\u201d she said. (LoveSeen is the new line of fake lashes from the former J. Crew executive Jenna Lyons.)\", \"Alanna McDonald, the president of Maybelline, said that its Sky High mascara, which hit shelves in January, is one of the top sellers of the year.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a real customer insight about the desire to wear makeup for everything you missed,\\u201d she said of the company\\u2019s makeup business, now disproportionately driven by eye and lip products.\", \"Similarly, e.l.f. Cosmetics has had success with its Big Mood mascara, which came out in August, and the No Budge Shadow Stick, a collection of 12 metallic eye shadow pencils that come in neutral beige to vibrant sapphire.\", \"Shadow sticks are designed for \\u201cone swipe\\u201d use, said Gayitri Budhraja, the chief brand officer of e.l.f. Also, they\\u2019re shimmery and cost just $5.\", \"Raynell Steward, the founder and chief executive of the Crayon Case, a school supply-inspired line of makeup, is seeing demand for bold eye shadow.\", \"\\u201cPeople that were never into color are more into color now,\\u201d Ms. Steward said, adding that she had trouble keeping an 18-shade Box of Crayons palette and mini eye shadow \\u201cnotepads,\\u201d especially in green, in stock. \\u201cThe nude palettes are not selling,\\u201d she said.\", \"Beauty industry experts say complicated eye motifs \\u2014 think over-the-top shadow with eyebrows that look as if they were drawn on with a Sharpie \\u2014 are pass\\u00e9.\", \"Ms. Serrat suggests a single wash of color painted over the entire lid (blue is her favorite), applied with a brush or your finger. Depending on your mood, the end result can be intense and opaque, light like a watercolor or somewhere in the middle.\", \"With Violette_Fr\\u2019s Yeux Paint, a liquid eye color that doubles as a liner, you can swipe it across your lid and blend to your liking or paint a thick line along the lash line (wing optional) with a pretty easy-to-use applicator. A \\u201ctwinkling\\u201d blue is the most popular color, Ms. Serrat said. (She thought it would be beige.) Two new shades came out in late October: a rich navy and an acid yellow gold.\", \"Don\\u2019t let blue eye shadow conjure memories of frosted hair, feathered bangs, Madonna in the 1980s and bad fashion. The new blue isn\\u2019t garish. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re wearing a blue eye shadow but your hair is chill, your skin is kind of bare and you have a little gloss on, you still look like you,\\u201d Ms. Serrat said.\", \"At MAC Cosmetics, yellow lids are trending.\", \"In some places, sales for yellow shadow tripled or quadrupled, Drew Elliott, the company\\u2019s global creative director, reported, a result, he said, of content and a \\u201cYes to Yellow\\u201d campaign that kicked off last spring.\", \"\\u201cWe kept it going because we saw that people were really engaging,\\u201d Mr. Elliott said.\", \"Zanna Roberts Rassi, a co-founder of Milk Makeup, uses words like \\u201ceasy\\u201d and \\u201cplayful\\u201d to describe modern eye makeup.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re seeing this explosion of color from the biggest designers trickle down to the high-high street, and that\\u2019s something that\\u2019s been mirrored on the lids more than lips,\\u201d she said, referring to the bold lids that were seen on the runways at Proenza Schouler, LaQuan Smith and Versace during the last round of fashion shows. \\u201cNothing was precise. It was so arts and crafts.\\u201d\", \"What about skin?\", \"\\u201cThis younger consumer knows their skin is textured,\\u201d said Eden Palmer, the vice president of global brand for Morphe. \\u201cThey\\u2019re OK with that and want to show it.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s a sentiment shared industrywide. At brands and stores like Morphe, Nars, Sephora and Ulta, customers are opting for tinted moisturizer or skin tint over full-on foundation \\u2014 to pair with a big eye look, of course.\", \"\\u201cPeople are excited to show their face again,\\u201d Ms. Jiwan said. \\u201cThe only difference is that they\\u2019re showing it in a different way than they did before.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"79fd804958c911ec9e9911b1064635c3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"79fd804958c911ec9e9911b1064635c3"}},
