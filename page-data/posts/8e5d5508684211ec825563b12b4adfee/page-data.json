It causes about 3% of all global carbon dioxide gas emissions, which is more than the CO2 emissions from the airline industry.\", \"A much larger hydrogen-powered ferry is now being built in Europe, and the technology could eventually be applied to container ships.\", \"But there is a downside: if hydrogen leaks during production or from its tanks, it contributes to global warming.\", \"\\\"There's a lot of hope and promise around it, but in order for it to really move forward \\u2014 in order for the climate to be protected, we need to understand what the leak potential really is,\\\" said Amanda Leland, the executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund.\", \"Back in Bellingham, they're proud that a cleaner future is being built in America.\", \"\\\"Really think it's gonna be a game changer as things move forward,\\\" Willie said.\", \"Ben Tracy is a CBS News senior national and environmental correspondent based in Washington, D.C.\"]","href_hash":"8e5d5508684211ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8e5d5508684211ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
