captain, Cummins laid down an important marker on the sort of person he is and how he wants to be judged.\", \"\\\"I won't always get things right, I'm certainly not perfect,\\\" he told a Zoom media conference on Friday afternoon.\", \"It was a timely admission, coming after a tortuous week in which cricket has had an internal and external debate about moral character following the revelations about the text message exchange that\\u00a0led to Tim Paine's resignation.\", \"Last week, Cricket Australia (CA) chair Richard Freudenstein said it was \\\"absolutely appropriate that Tim has resigned the captaincy, which is in the best interest of Australian cricket\\\".\", \"\\\"The captain of the Australian (men's) cricket team has to be held to a very high standard,\\\" Freudenstein said last\\u00a0Saturday.\", \"The CA board had clearly lifted that standard since Paine was cleared of any wrongdoing in the text-messaging incident three years ago.\", \"But then again, cricket has always had a problem with imaginary lines, like the one David Warner and Cameron Bancroft tripped over when they conspired to sandpaper a cricket ball in South Africa in 2018, and the one Steve Smith sidestepped when he chose to look the other way at the time.\", \"It was appropriate that Smith \\u2014 now back as Australian men's vice-captain \\u2014 gave a rueful smile while sitting alongside Cummins on Friday, as his new skipper revealed he has\\u00a0imperfections.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5c82bd9afb3ca38d537a536a8df0da3d\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Steve Smith will work alongside Cummins in his role as men's vice-captain.(AAP: Michael Dodge)</div>\", \"Yes, Cummins is tall, handsome, intelligent, considered and\\u00a0a natural-born leader, with a disposition that seemingly never gets ruffled.\", \"And yes, he's the world's number one men's fast bowler.\", \"Cummins seems perfect to such an extent that he has been portrayed as a CA poster child, a golden boy for the organisation.\", \"But he's not having a bar of it, telling reporters he's not \\\"overly comfortable\\\" with those sorts of descriptions.\", \"\\\"That's probably really hit home in the last few days seeing Tim [Paine],\\\" he said.\", \"Cummins added that Australian cricketers face\\u00a0enormous pressure being put on a pedestal.\", \"\\\"I think a lot of the pressure and the responsibility of being perfect is unreasonable, I think it's too much to ask of anyone,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We're going to have players come into our side who are teenagers, who are just out of school, who are growing up.\", \"\\\"They've got to be able to fail and know they're allowed to grow from that.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Cummins admits he's his 'harshest critic'</div>\", \"And so \\u2014 without even trying \\u2014\\u00a0Cummins demonstrated that he will be the\\u00a0leader that Australian men's cricket needs by directly taking on his own chairman and the\\u00a0assertion that the leader has to be held to a very high standard.\", \"Because this is a leader who will embrace imperfections.\", \"\\\"When it comes to \\u2026\\u00a0moral character, I'm probably my harshest critic and judge on that,\\\" he said.\", \"<img

that comes with being Test skipper.(AP: Asanka Brendon Ratnayake)</div>\", \"Cummins said he had already had some great conversations with Freudenstein and CA chief executive Nick Hockley.\", \"He wasn't concerned about upholding a higher moral standard than the rest of the team or indeed the average Australian.\", \"\\\"I know with the role comes added scrutiny, but for 10 or 11 years I've been playing for Australia in the public eye,\\\" Cummins\\u00a0said.\", \"You suspect Cummins sleeps pretty well.\", \"But you also suspect that there are things he's done in his past that he's not proud of.\", \"We have all done things we're not proud of and that's the point.\", \"In the cancel culture era, it's easy to get a group of people outraged at a perceived slight and ever\\u00a0more difficult to draw a distinct line between what is morally acceptable and what isn't.\", \"We all know about those pesky imaginary lines: they bloody well keep moving on us.\", \"Paine made a self-confessed blunder that was at one moment acceptable to Australian cricket's power brokers,\\u00a0yet three years later it wasn't.\", \"Whatever your opinion about his actions, be sure that Paine is paying a heavy price.\", \"Smith said \\\"I don't want to know about it\\\" on the field when the ball-tampering incident was unfolding at Newlands in Cape Town in 2018, a crime that cost him a year in cricket's wilderness.\", \"Increasingly, we all feel impelled to judge and then immediately come to a conclusion about what is wrong and right, without taking the time to consider the myriad shades of grey that is the reality of existence.\", \"But you suspect that Cummins gets nuance.\", \"\\\"I'm certainly going to be standing up for players if they make some minor mistakes,\\\" Cummins said.\", \"\\\"They're opportunities to grow from; not always ideal, but they happen.\", \"\\\"We've got to manage our expectations of everyone a little bit more.\", \"That last statement drew another nod of understanding and approval from Smith.\", \"Cummins could well be the leader for our times. Just don't call him perfect.\"]","href_hash":"c6ddc49e4eed11ecad2c9534cd0732d0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c6ddc49e4eed11ecad2c9534cd0732d0"}},
