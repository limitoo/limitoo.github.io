Putin of Russia spoke for roughly two hours by videoconference on Tuesday in an effort to defuse a growing military crisis along Ukraine\\u2019s borders, where tens of thousands of Russian troops have massed in what U.S. officials say could be the prelude to an all-out invasion.\", \"The meeting was one of the biggest foreign policy tests of Mr. Biden\\u2019s presidency to date, with consequences for the stability of Europe, the credibility of American threats and the future of a country the United States has spent years trying to defend from Mr. Putin\\u2019s aggression. Here are five takeaways from the day.\", \"The leaders\\u2019 videoconference did not resolve the crisis along Ukraine\\u2019s borders, and neither the Kremlin nor the White House reported substantial progress.\", \"Jake Sullivan, the White House national security adviser, said after the meeting that Mr. Biden had offered Mr. Putin the choice between a diplomatic solution and the severe economic and political consequences that would follow a Russian invasion of Ukraine \\u2014 but he did not say whether Mr. Putin had made any commitments.\", \"Whether Mr. Biden\\u2019s threats will deter the Russian leader from invading Ukraine is unclear. But Mr. Putin was not conciliatory. A Kremlin readout of the meeting said that Mr. Putin blamed the tensions on the West, which he said was building up its military capability in and around Ukraine. And Mr. Putin demanded legal guarantees that NATO would not expand eastward toward Russia\\u2019s borders or deploy offensive weapons systems in Ukraine.\", \"Although the Kremlin said that Mr. Biden agreed to continue discussing Mr. Putin\\u2019s demands, U.S. officials rejected Mr. Putin\\u2019s analysis of the situation and said they would never make promises about possible NATO expansions.\", \"The Biden administration and Congress have been at odds over a new pipeline between Russia and Germany that critics say is an unacceptable political and economic boon for Moscow. It is now in danger.\", \"Russian companies have spent several years building the Nord Stream 2 natural gas pipeline to Germany, a project that the Biden administration officially opposes, because it could deprive Ukraine of revenue from another pipeline that runs through its territory and would give Mr. Putin added leverage over Europe\\u2019s energy supplies.\", \"But to avoid a rift with the German government, Mr. Biden has deflected congressional sanctions on Germany aimed at stopping the project, angering many Republicans and some Democrats.\", \"During testimony to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday, however, Victoria S. Nuland, a top State Department official, told senators that if Mr. Putin attacked Ukraine, \\u201cour expectation is that the pipeline will be suspended.\\u201d That suggests private U.S. diplomacy had won such a commitment from Germany, which would suffer financially if the pipeline were delayed or scrapped.\", \"Immediately after concluding his meeting with Mr. Putin, Mr. Biden spoke by phone with the leaders of France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom, whose support U.S. officials say will be crucial to deterring the Russian leader. Mr. Putin has sought for years to drive wedges between America and its allies in the hope of weakening resistance to his actions and undermining NATO and the trans-Atlantic alliance. \\u201cWe have experts from the Treasury Department, the State Department and the National Security Council in daily contact with the key capitals and with Brussels\\u201d to discuss what punitive steps could be taken jointly against Russia, Mr. Sullivan said.\", \"There is little evidence of any personal hostility between Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin. In a brief video clip of the virtual meeting\\u2019s start posted online by Russian state media, the two leaders appeared to exchange friendly greetings, with the American president, who prides himself on his rapport with foreign leaders, smiling and waving to his Russian counterpart and telling him, \\u201cGood to see you again.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere was a lot of give and take, there was no finger wagging,\\u201d Mr. Sullivan told reporters. \\u201cThis was a real discussion,\\u201d he added, \\u201cit was not speeches.\\u201d\", \"The Kremlin called the conversation \\u201chonest and businesslike.\\u201d An adviser to Mr. Putin, Yuri V. Ushakov, later told reporters that Mr. Biden brought up the shared sacrifice of the United States and the Soviet Union during World War II, and that the two leaders even made occasional jokes and \\u201cexchanges of compliments.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"2c9059fa57b311ec80d8afd8a81edc1a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2c9059fa57b311ec80d8afd8a81edc1a"}},
