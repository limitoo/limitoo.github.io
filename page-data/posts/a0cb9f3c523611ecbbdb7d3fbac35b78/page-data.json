He discussed his withdrawal from the case with Brooks and Milwaukee County Circuit Judge David Feiss. Prosecutors did not object to Domask's withdrawal, the AP said.\", \"In the wake of Domask's departure from the case, Deputy District Attorney Matthew Torbenson went forward with seeking additional conditions on Brooks' imprisonment. They claim to have evidence of him intimidating a victim from a previous case filed on November 5. Brooks is a registered felon with several previous charges, including domestic violence, reckless endangerment, bail jumping, shooting at his nephew and owning a firearm as a registered felon.\", \"Brooks is accused of driving his red Ford Escape SUV into the route of the Waukesha Christmas Parade on November 21. Investigators have yet to determine a motive for the attack. He has been charged with six counts of first-degree intentional homicide. He was previously charged with five counts, with the sixth being added on Monday after the death of 8-year-old Jackson Sparks on November 23. His bail is currently set at $5 million.\", \"Brooks will make his next appearance in the Milwaukee County Circuit Court on December 20.
