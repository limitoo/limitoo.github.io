(Exactly 11 years later, Davis would take office as the president of the Confederate States of America.) A flood of antislavery fanaticism and sectional hatred, Davis declaimed, had opened a \\u201cmoral crevasse\\u201d that endangered America\\u2019s very foundations. The framers, Davis pronounced, had enshrined in the Constitution the right to hold property in humans, but frenzied antislavery Northerners undermined the law of the land; and now the flood was surging, pouring \\u201cturgid waters through the broken Constitution.\\u201d\", \"Davis\\u2019s pro-slavery remarks provide Noah Feldman with both the epigraph and the title of his new book about Jefferson Davis\\u2019s nemesis, Abraham Lincoln, which seems a very odd choice. Unlike Davis, Lincoln never believed that the Constitution had been broken, even after the slaveholders began their rebellion in 1860-61. Instead, Lincoln charged that the insurrection Davis helped to lead was \\u201cthe essence of anarchy.\\u201d\", \"On both points, though, Feldman contends that Davis was right and Lincoln was wrong. Moreover, Feldman argues, despite Lincoln\\u2019s professed fidelity to the framers\\u2019 work, he was the one who finally broke the Constitution during the Civil War by turning the presidency into a quasi dictatorship, much as his Confederate and Copperhead enemies alleged he did. Only then, Feldman concludes, paradoxically, could America redeem its claims to nobility by purging the original sin of slavery, refounding itself by embracing what he calls a new, expansive \\u201cmoral Constitution.\\u201d\", \"Feldman\\u2019s reliance on Jefferson Davis to frame a book on Abraham Lincoln thus makes perfect sense: Aside from the slaveholders\\u2019 insistence on the ethical legitimacy of slavery, Feldman\\u2019s constitutional analysis consistently backs their arguments over Lincoln\\u2019s. Less than perfect, unfortunately, are the renderings of American history he offers to support his surprising thesis.\", \"A professor at Harvard Law School and a prolific scholar and commentator on current affairs, Feldman is well equipped to assess Lincoln\\u2019s constitutional record. A lucid, provocative stylist and an expert in fields ranging from Islamic politics to the American separation of church and state, he is widely known for an illuminating political biography of James Madison. \\u201cThe Broken Constitution\\u201d can be read as a sequel to that book, connecting the nation\\u2019s founding and early years to what Lincoln called the \\u201castounding\\u201d outcome of the Civil War. Indeed, Feldman roots his interpretation of Lincoln and slavery in what he now calls the \\u201ccompromise Constitution\\u201d that Madison and the other framers hammered out \\u2014 the Constitution, he says, that Lincoln would eventually break.\", \"From the start, however, Feldman\\u2019s depiction of the Constitution\\u2019s connection to slavery is questionable. Although he calls it the \\u201ccompromise Constitution,\\u201d Feldman\\u2019s Constitution was almost seamlessly pro-slavery. The famous negotiations that offered concessions to the slaveholders come across more like abject submission. Feldman ignores the antislavery currents inside the Federal Convention that challenged and sometimes defeated the pro-slavery delegates. He overlooks how much the Constitution\\u2019s provision authorizing abolition of U.S. participation in the Atlantic slave trade was an antislavery victory over the lower South, which tried to block it as a dealbreaker \\u2014 a measure that, even when weakened by a maneuver Madison bemoaned, was the first serious blow ever against the trade undertaken in the name of a national government. Feldman fails to see the Constitution as an ambiguous document that offered protections to the slaveholders but also contained considerable antislavery potential, sufficient for thoughtful if wishful Northern abolitionists like Benjamin Rush to hail it as the death knell of slavery.\", \"Having erased the Constitution\\u2019s ambiguities over slavery, Feldman claims antislavery activists down to Lincoln could not seriously invoke the Constitution in order to attack slavery \\u201cbecause the Constitution said nothing against the practice.\\u201d With little more to go on than the wispy, hypocritical egalitarian phrases in the Declaration of Independence \\u2014 dismissed by Feldman as \\u201cthe slaveholders\\u2019 Declaration\\u201d \\u2014 antislavery advocates supposedly railed against slavery with admirable moral fervor but feeble constitutional backing. When Lincoln carefully constructed a historical and constitutional argument for halting slavery\\u2019s expansion and hastening its doom for his famous Cooper Institute address in 1860, the result, Feldman contends, was an \\u201codd performance\\u201d that incoherently identified antislavery possibilities in the framers\\u2019 \\u201ccompromise Constitution.\\u201d Eradicating slavery, Feldman insists, would require breaking the very Constitution that Lincoln claimed to venerate.\", \"In fact, as historians have been detailing for decades, antislavery spokesmen and organizations, from the framer Benjamin Franklin in 1790 up to and including Lincoln\\u2019s Republican Party, repeatedly seized upon provisions in the Constitution, from the preamble\\u2019s \\u201cgeneral welfare\\u201d clause to the provision granting Congress authority over the national territories, as instruments to hasten slavery\\u2019s demise. Three generations of antislavery constitutionalists, while admitting that the Constitution barred Congress from directly abolishing slavery in the states where it already existed, pushed numerous strategies to place slavery, as Lincoln would put it, \\u201cin course of ultimate extinction.\\u201d The antislavery constitutionalists\\u2019 demands \\u2014 above all to halt slavery\\u2019s expansion, bar the admission of new slaveholding states and uphold state laws that would obstruct the capture and return of fugitive slaves \\u2014 in time persuaded no less stalwart an abolitionist than Frederick Douglass that the Constitution was a \\u201cglorious liberty document.\\u201d As incorporated in the Republican Party platform, those demands led directly to Lincoln\\u2019s ascension in 1860, Southern secession and the civil war that ended in slavery\\u2019s abolition.\", \"Contrary to Jefferson Davis, Lincoln and the Republicans\\u2019 triumph did not break the Constitution; it broke the pro-slavery view of the Constitution while vindicating the long beleaguered antislavery view. Nor did Lincoln break an already broken Constitution by assuming quasi-dictatorial powers in order to preserve the Union. Feldman\\u2019s charge that Lincoln violated respect for constitutional popular sovereignty by refusing to acquiesce in Southern secession elides that the Constitution established the majority as sovereign in national affairs, and it rests on the assumption, rightly disputed by Lincoln, that the Southern fire-eaters truly represented the will of the Southern citizenry. Even President James Buchanan stated that secession was unconstitutional. Feldman\\u2019s criticisms of Lincoln for trivializing and then suspending habeas corpus in much of the North have more merit. Still, it strains credulity to indict Lincoln for tyranny because he took emergency actions, almost exclusively against Confederates, spies and other traitors, in order to save democratic government, all the while holding open elections and suffering the merciless attacks of Democrats.\", \"Finally, Feldman cuts corners to claim that the Emancipation Proclamation was an arbitrary violation of slaveholders\\u2019 property rights. In reality, Lincoln wrote the proclamation armed with abundant legal opinion, including a well-known pronouncement of John Quincy Adams affirming the president\\u2019s authority to emancipate the enslaved when invasion or insurrection threatened the nation. As an antislavery constitutionalist, meanwhile, Lincoln never conceded an absolute right to property in humans.\", \"Coming at a time when not a few scholars have been saying that our modern Constitution is broken, Feldman\\u2019s final paradox \\u2014 that it took an elected tyrant to emancipate the enslaved and usher in a rebirth of American freedom \\u2014 can sound ominous. Still, there should be no cause for alarm. \\u201cThe Broken Constitution\\u201d displays its author\\u2019s usual brilliance and boldness in his contrarianism, and a passionate engagement with the past. What it lacks is historical soundness. In the end, Jefferson Davis\\u2019s constitutionalism proves, once again, no match for Abraham Lincoln\\u2019s.\"]","href_hash":"a82aaa243bc611ec8a60000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a82aaa243bc611ec8a60000017025a03"}},
