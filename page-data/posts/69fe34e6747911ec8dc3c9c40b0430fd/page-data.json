But it wasn\\u2019t until she visited Japan that she decided she would one day open a ryokan-style spa of her own in France, a vision that has now come to fruition with Maison Suisen, located in the heart of Paris\\u2019s popular Marais district. From the moment guests walk in the door, Maison Suisen embodies the concept of omotenashi, or the art of hospitality, asking each visitor to select from an assortment of organic teas procured from Japan that they then brew and serve after treatment. In addition to other services, guests can choose between traditional shiatsu, on tatami and futon, or a more contemporary setup with massage table and aromatic oil. From $130, suisen.fr.\", \"As an art student at the University of Brighton and then the Royal Drawing School in London, the now 28-year-old artist Somaya Critchlow noticed a dearth of depictions of Black women in Western art. \\u201cI was feeling isolated, so I thought I would confront myself,\\u201d she says of deciding to draw her own body. \\u201cAs soon as I started drawing myself nude, I started to enjoy myself.\\u201d These self-portraits soon evolved into a broader celebration of Black femininity, one showcased in her first monograph, \\u201cSomaya Critchlow: Paintings.\\u201d Referencing disparate influences \\u2014 Renaissance and rococo portraiture, the surrealism of Leonor Fini and David Lynch and the unapologetic carnality of pop stars like Cardi B and Nicki Minaj \\u2014 Critchlow depicts curvaceous women, often in varying states of undress, inhabiting an ambiguous zone between sexualized object and playfully independent subject. $40, artbook.com.\", \"Handcrafted objects by international artisans are the raison d\\u2019\\u00eatre of En Place, a new digital shop for home d\\u00e9cor that is the brainchild of Alexis Kanter, a creative consultant and former market editor at Vanity Fair. From a playful raffia-and-clay table lamp by the Spanish ceramist Marta Bonilla to a graphic black-and-white chair upholstered in hand-loomed natural wool by the Guatemala-based store Meso Goods, the curated selection is presented against a chic editorial backdrop that includes maker stories and city guides, adding context and narrative to every piece. \\u201cI wanted to create a marketplace that you could shop online, but also in an experiential way that wasn\\u2019t traditional bricks and mortar,\\u201d says Kanter. Later this year, En Place will also collaborate with a handful of hotels (including H\\u00f4tel le Sud in Antibes, France, and Lisbon\\u2019s Santa Clara 1728), allowing guests to shop their wares with the click of a button. \\u201cI like to think of it as a reimagining of the hotel gift shop,\\u201d she says, \\u201cmaking it seamless to bring home something meaningful that really tells the story of a place.\\u201d From $24, en-place.co.\", \"While shopping at a beauty store in Seoul a few years ago, the couple Su min Park and Wonny Lee realized that, though the shelves were filled with Korean products, the fragrance section offered only familiar Western brands. And so Park, a photographer and art director, and Lee, a marketing executive, who live in New York City, decided to start Elorea, a modern fragrance brand inspired by Korea\\u2019s rich history and culture. \\u201cWe were at a time in our lives where we wanted to get closer to our roots and culture,\\u201d says Lee. A portmanteau of \\u201celements\\u201d and \\u201cKorea,\\u201d Elorea launches with four distinctive scents named after the four trigrams adorning the South Korean flag: Heaven, Earth, Water and Fire. After extensive research, the couple sourced ingredients from various regions of South Korea, such as citrus from Jeju, which they mixed with camellia and nutmeg for the warm notes of amber and leather in Fire. From $170, elorea.com.\", \"Like many of us, the Brooklyn-based artist Elliott Puckette has spent the pandemic taking solace in what she can control while making peace with what she cannot. Her ninth solo exhibition with New York\\u2019s Kasmin Gallery, which will also publish her first major monograph later this year, showcases her characteristically precise yet expansive line paintings alongside her first foray into sculpture, a medium she\\u2019s long wanted to explore. Early attempts with plaster of Paris, wire, paper and clay did not pass muster. \\u201cIt was an absolute disaster,\\u201d Puckette says. \\u201cThen I realized it wasn\\u2019t something I could do on my own; I needed to hand it over.\\u201d Cast in bronze by Workshop Art Fabrication in Kingston, N.Y., the two sculptures in the exhibition, \\u201cRandom Walk\\u201d and \\u201cPivot,\\u201d represent a natural evolution of Puckette\\u2019s career-long commitment to the line by manifesting it in three-dimensional space. What once meandered along inside the confines of the canvas has now broken free. \\u201cElliott Puckette\\u201d is on view at Kasmin Gallery from Jan. 13 to Feb. 26, kasmingallery.com.\"]","href_hash":"69fe34e6747911ec8dc3c9c40b0430fd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"69fe34e6747911ec8dc3c9c40b0430fd"}},
