Rapinoe told \\\"CBS Mornings\\\" on Tuesday that the lawsuit represents justice for players across the board.\", \"\\\"Obviously, we have been in this for a long time, and coming from a long history of women who have fought to put this sport in a better place. I mean, I think pride comes to mind, just incredibly proud of the women on this team and all the women who this lawsuit represents,\\\" Rapinoe said. \\\"The thing I look forward to and am really proud of is that, you know, the justice comes in the next generation never have to go through what we went through.
