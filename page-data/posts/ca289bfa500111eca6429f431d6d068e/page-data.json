Al Sharpton sat in the courtroom in support of the Arbery family. \", \"\\u00a0\\\"The Right Rev. Al Sharpton managed to find his way into the back of the courtroom,\\\" said Gough. \", \"He added, \\\"We don't want any more Black pastors coming in here \\u2026 sitting with the victim's family trying to influence a jury in this case.\\\"\", \"But Rev. Sharpton was apparently so unobtrusive, Gough admitted he didn't even notice Sharpton was there until it was pointed out to him.\\u00a0 \\\"And I'm not saying the state is even aware that Mr. Sharpton was in the courtroom, I certainly wasn't aware till last night.\\\"\", \"But Gough kept pushing, claiming the Arberys' high-profile supporters wanted to turn the trial into a spectacle \\u2013 and, some say, making a spectacle of himself.\\u00a0 He inexplicably invokes the brand ambassador for Kentucky Fried Chicken.\\u00a0 \", \"He said, \\\"If a bunch of folks came in here dressed like Colonel Sanders with white masks sitting in the back, I mean, that would be\\u2014\\\"\", \"Judge Walmsley cut him off, \\\"I don't want to hear about that \\u2026 I was asked at lunch whether the court had any objection to the Rev. Al Sharpton coming into the courtroom \\u2026 and my comment to that was simply, 'as long as things are not disruptive, and it's not a distraction to the jury, or anything else going on in the courtroom, so be it.'\\\"\", \"Days later, hundreds of Black clergy gathered to support the Arbery family.\\u00a0 They held a vigil in front of the courthouse. Gough repeatedly pushed for a mistrial and prosecutor Linda Dunikoski grew frustrated saying, \\\"Your honor, Mr. Gough is a brilliant lawyer \\u2026 He stood up knowing he was on television \\u2026 He got the response that he wanted \\u2026 Now he's asking for a mistrial based on something he caused.\\\"\", \"Was bringing up the Colonel and the Black pastors a carefully considered strategy or a last-minute scramble to deflect from a sinking case?\\u00a0 \", \"Civil rights attorney Lee Merritt, who is representing the Arbery family, told \\\"48 Hours\\\" he believes Gough was worried his client was in trouble. \", \"Gough denies it, but Merritt told \\\"48 Hours,\\\" \\\"Roddie Bryan asked for a plea deal \\u2026 he wanted to turn state['s] evidence.\\\" \", \"But there would be no deal, and Bryan was convicted of multiple counts including felony murder. \", \"After the trial, we called Gough to ask about his Colonel Sanders comment.\\u00a0 He told us it was \\\"not a reference to Kentucky Fried Chicken.\\\" He went on to explain he was referring to the all-white suits the Colonel often wore \\u2013 not to the man himself.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I should have been more direct,\\\" Gough said.
