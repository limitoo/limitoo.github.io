The multiple myeloma cancer diagnosis he recently received is dire. But Greg is plucky and unshakable, plus he has a good marriage, a 7-year-old daughter he adores and a successful career under the tutelage of a benevolent boss. \\u201cHe could call his life perfect if he weren\\u2019t dying,\\u201d explains the narrator of \\u201cA Little Hope,\\u201d Ethan Joella\\u2019s poignant and quietly powerful debut novel. \\u201cDon\\u2019t they know he will wrestle and clobber this thing? That is who he is.\\u201d\", \"Of course, he also might not, which is the novel\\u2019s central tension. The story unspools in a series of interconnected vignettes told from the perspectives of various people living in the fictional town of Wharton, Conn. As we await news of Greg\\u2019s fate, the ecosystem of the place comes alive.\", \"There\\u2019s Freddie, Greg\\u2019s wife, who works as a seamstress at a dry cleaner but dreams of applying to the Iowa Writers\\u2019 Workshop. Freddie\\u2019s boss, Darcy, is a crotchety widow who started her own business after her husband\\u2019s death; she\\u2019s semi-estranged from her son, Luke, a ragged former rock star with cripplingly low self-esteem. A bride-to-be named Suzette is still mourning her sister\\u2019s long-ago death when she patronizes the dry cleaning store for a wedding dress fitting. Greg\\u2019s boss, Alex, and his wife lost their only child in a bicycle crash decades ago, and now Alex is about to become a grandfather as a result of an affair he had after the accident.\", \"Each resident picks up a different thread, most of them while engaged in seemingly mundane tasks \\u2014 a chance encounter at a toy store, a gas station stop after a long workday. Joella is particularly deft at deconstructing quiet moments in small-town life and amplifying their significance. When Suzette goes in for her dress fitting, she ends up spilling the story of her sister\\u2019s death, which occurred on the eve of her own wedding. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t ever get over that loss. It leaves a scratch in you like a record that never plays right again,\\u201d Darcy counsels Suzette. The exchange has a calming effect; suddenly Darcy doesn\\u2019t seem so stern.\", \"With so many characters populating the pages, you\\u2019d expect to encounter the occasional skimpily drawn one. But Joella impressively balances a cast of thoroughly realized personalities grappling with momentous events \\u2014 deaths, but also weddings, breakups and births. \\u201cShe was such a full person, made up of perfections and flaws and kindness and sadness,\\u201d a newlywed husband remembers of his first impression of his wife. The same could be said of the husband, along with the rest of the community. Even Darcy\\u2019s dead husband\\u2019s beloved 1964 navy blue convertible has a robust presence \\u2014 and a name, Betsy.\", \"Greg realizes early on that he\\u2019ll need to let go of the life he\\u2019s been living if he hopes to preserve it. He takes a hiatus from his job and slowly accepts his radical identity shift. Yet as we catch glimpses of his transformation, his death seems increasingly likely. His 5 o\\u2019clock shadow is obliterated by chemo and his mobility is drastically reduced. The sense of foreboding is exacerbated by the fact that the whole town seems to be grieving one thing or another.\", \"By now, you might be thinking this all sounds like a huge bummer. But the title is not a wild misnomer; \\u201cA Little Hope\\u201d is also about survival and healing. The question of Greg\\u2019s fate remains a cliffhanger to the end, and yes, there\\u2019s ample anguish within his family, but the stakes have been neutralized somewhat by the townspeople\\u2019s collective growth and recovery from their own travails. These characters transform over time, make amends and see one another more honestly and fully. Their evolution is inspiring \\u2014 and more than a tad hopeful.\"]","href_hash":"41c5c7b146c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"41c5c7b146c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
