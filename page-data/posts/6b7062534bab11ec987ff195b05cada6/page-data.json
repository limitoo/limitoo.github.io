When it came to wedding invites, however, her sister did not allow her a +1 to give to the girlfriend, in order to prevent drama with her fianc\\u00e9's family on the day.\", \"\\\"Her fianc\\u00e9 comes from a very regressive and religious family, and while he himself is fine, his extended family is very traditional and anti-gay,\\\" she wrote.\", \"\\\"My sister gave me my invitation in person instead of mailing it, and explained that I wasn't getting a +1 because having a gay couple at the wedding would likely end up causing lots of drama with his side of the family. All my other siblings have +1s and are welcome to bring their hetero partners.\\\"\", \"The woman explained she \\\"understands where she's coming from but it still feels like such a slap in the face.\\\" She decided against forcing her sister to give her a +1, but said she is considering no longer attending the wedding.\", \"\\\"I'm not comfortable spending a whole day alone, while my other siblings are allowed to bring their partners, just because my sister wants to cater to a bunch of bigots,\\\" she wrote.\", \"How views towards gay couples play in weddings have long been a much-discussed topic. In 2019, the Arizona Supreme Court controversially ruled that graphic designers were within their rights to refuse to create invites for gay couples. The court ruled that a 2013 anti-discrimination ordinance in Phoenix violated the First Amendment rights of the owners of a calligraphy invitation business who refused to create invitations for same-sex weddings.\", \"Normally, however, issues don't often arise between apparently previously-accepting families when it comes to weddings.\", \"An overwhelming majority of responses to the question at hand agreed with the user's feelings towards the lack of +1. Many zoned in on the sister's stance on it all, claiming that she shouldn't pander to her new side of the family, at the expense of her sister.\", \"\\\"This is not a one time issue. This is how the stage gets set for how their family is going to interact with yours and whose values will be prioritized. It's her wedding, and she can invite who she wants to, but choosing to do this is not a neutral stance; it is siding with his family to avoid drama. That's a slippery slope with no bottom,\\\" wrote one user.\", \"\\\"Your sister needs to learn to stick with principles. It's a really bad way to start a marriage, to toss your principles just to get on the good side of hateful people.\\nWhat she should do: Invite you both. If there's a problem, it's the fiance's family's problem. She should probably tell them in advance that you guys are coming together, so you're not faced with extreme unpleasantness once you're there. If she won't, you should absolutely decline to go. Let people know why. That's important, because if you decline, they'll try spreading rumors about you.\", \"\\\"You're her sister. You're going to be in her life the rest of her life.
