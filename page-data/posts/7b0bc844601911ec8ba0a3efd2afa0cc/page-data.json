I think we have an obligation to get involved on the local level, whether that is commenting at a City Council meeting or serving on a city commission or organizing with friends and neighbors to improve your street or block. I think this also extends to giving; we should focus our efforts on those around us.\", \"To that end, I want to share some organizations that are doing good work in the Charlottesville, Va., area, where I live. Each one attends to a different need and each one is worthy of your support.\", \"The Jefferson School African American Heritage Center works to preserve and honor the heritage and legacy of the African American community of Charlottesville and its surrounding counties, as well as provide educational and other resources to residents and scholars in the area.

Greg Tate, a critic, musician and producer, died on Dec. 7 at the age of 64. bell hooks, a scholar, author, activist and educator, died on Wednesday at the age of 69.

In a large Dutch oven or pot, heat the oil over medium-high heat. Working in batches, add the meatballs in a single layer and cook, flipping halfway through, until golden brown on two sides, 5 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a plate and repeat, adding oil as needed.\", \"Once all the meatballs are browned and out of the pot, if the oil is burned, wipe it out and add a bit more to the pot. Reduce the heat to medium, add the reserved ginger mixture and saut\\u00e9 until fragrant, about 1 minute.

Add the meatballs and any juices from the plate, and simmer until the flavors come together and the meatballs are cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes.\", \"Remove from heat, and stir in the spinach and lime juice. Divide rice among bowls, then top with meatballs, broth and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges.\", \"This article is part of Times Opinion\\u2019s Holiday Giving Guide 2021.
