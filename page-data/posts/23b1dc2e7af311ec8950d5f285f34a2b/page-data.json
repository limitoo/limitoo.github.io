So when I picked up \\u201cPutting the Rabbit in the Hat,\\u201d the new memoir by Brian Cox, who plays the family\\u2019s tyrannical patriarch, Logan Roy, I was desperate for tidbits to tide me over during the long wait for Season 4.\", \"Well, there aren\\u2019t many. Cox writes gruffly of a newcomer director on the show giving Kieran Culkin, who plays his youngest son and is an ace at mixing up the script, notes to \\u201cslow down.\\u201d \\u201cNow, this is an actor who\\u2019s calibrated the patterns of his character\\u2019s delivery over the course of two previous seasons,\\u201d the author thunders, or so I imagine (as Roy, he\\u2019s a big thunderer). \\u201cHe\\u2019s not going to suddenly slow down just because you\\u2019ve given him a note.\\u201d\", \"Cox confides furthermore that he doesn\\u2019t really relate to the intense, Method-like \\u201cprocess\\u201d that Jeremy Strong uses to get into the character of Kendall, Logan\\u2019s middle son. Fans already knew about Strong\\u2019s tactics from a profile of him in The New Yorker that was chewed over for weeks after it was published in December. Some perceived condescension in the article toward Strong\\u2019s working-class background, including an anonymous Yale classmate having marveled at his \\u201ccareerist drive.\\u201d\", \"The heated discussion was fascinating and perplexing. When did acting become so bougie and aspirational? Wasn\\u2019t a working-class background once a key element of the Hollywood success narrative \\u2014 getting yanked out, discovered and made over by the savior figure of agent or studio executive? Think Cary Grant (born Archibald Leach, son of a tailor\\u2019s presser), Lana Turner (miner\\u2019s daughter), Ava Gardner (child of sharecroppers) and all those other glamour figures of yesteryear.\", \"A humble background didn\\u2019t hinder Cox, who has gone from leading man of the British stage to one of America\\u2019s most prolific and consistent character actors \\u2014 what is sometimes called a \\u201cjobbing actor,\\u201d though he now has the clout to negotiate a chauffeur, nice hotels and a double-banger trailer. Nobody rescued Cox, the consummate utility player. \\u201cI knew that simply wasn\\u2019t my ballpark,\\u201d he shrugs, on the subject of Hollywood stardom. \\u201cBesides, I\\u2019m too short.\\u201d He\\u2019s written two previous memoirs, one that tracks him to Moscow to direct \\u201cThe Crucible\\u201d and another about the challenges of \\u201cKing Lear.\\u201d Taking stock at 75, he\\u2019s not so much a lion in winter (indeed, he was fired as the voice of Aslan in the Narnia movies) as a seasoned workhorse finally able to enjoy a victory gallop.\", \"Cox writes eloquently about his origins in Dundee, Scotland, as the youngest of five children who occasionally had to beg for batter bits from the local chip shop. His parents met at a dance hall; his mother had been a spinner at jute mills and suffered multiple miscarriages and mental illness; his father, a shopkeeper and socialist, died when Brian was 8. Getting plunked in front of the telly rather than taken to the funeral was formative. So were later escapes to the movies, particularly ones like \\u201cSaturday Night and Sunday Morning\\u201d (1960), starring Albert Finney: \\u201ca film that wasn\\u2019t all about the lives of posh folk in drawing rooms, or struggling nobly in far-off places, or having faintly amusing high jinks on hospital wards,\\u201d Cox writes. \\u201cIt was all about working-class people \\u2014 people like us.\\u201d A kind teacher told him about a gofer gig at the local repertory theater and boom, he was home.\", \"Cox went on to attend the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art and perform in esteemed halls like the Royal Court, learning the classics but also grooving nicely with the rise of the angry young man and kitchen-sink realism led by the playwright John Osborne, with whom he became friends. Before very long he was working with his gods, including Finney.\", \"At a time when theater, the fabulous invalid, is straitjacketed by the pandemic, it\\u2019s heartening and a little wistful-making to have it recalled in all its messy midcentury glory. Cox fluffed a flustered Lynn Redgrave\\u2019s wig; got felt up by Princess Margaret backstage; narrowly escaped dying in a plane crash on his way to audition for Laurence Olivier. Years later, as Lear in a wheelchair, he \\u201cfrisbeed\\u201d his metal crown into the first row at the National Theater, injuring an audience member. He once compromised his testicles during a naked yoga scene. In the leaner years, he booked bikini waxes and cohabited with an army of cockroaches in a sublet apartment. There was drunkenness aplenty; one actor playing the priest in \\u201cHamlet\\u201d got so soused he tumbled into Ophelia\\u2019s grave.\", \"Cox, who prefers cannabis to drink, can ramble on a bit. If times ever get lean again, it\\u2019s easy to imagine him doing bedtime stories for a sleep app. He salts all the idolatry with disdain. On Kevin Spacey: \\u201cA great talent, but a stupid, stupid man.\\u201d On Steven Seagal: \\u201cAs ludicrous in real life as he appears onscreen.\\u201d On Quentin Tarantino: \\u201cI find his work meretricious. It\\u2019s all surface.\\u201d (Though he\\u2019d take a part if offered.) He\\u2019s softer on Woody Allen, owning up to himself dating an 18-year-old when he was in his 40s. \\u201cIt seems that everybody in this book is either dead or canceled,\\u201d he notes with some rue. He\\u2019s preoccupied with making a \\u201cgood death,\\u201d cataloging friends\\u2019 ends with an almost clinical relish (cancer, emphysema, suicide, a heart attack so massive it threw the victim \\u201cclean across the pebbles\\u201d).\", \"Like many actors, Cox treads more nimbly on the boards than in his personal life. He admits he wasn\\u2019t fully present for family tragedies, like his first wife\\u2019s stillborn twins and their daughter\\u2019s anorexia. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s my flaw,\\u201d he declares. \\u201cIt\\u2019s this propensity for absence, this need to disappear.\\u201d He loves the part of Logan partly because, when not thundering, he\\u2019s \\u201creined in and bottled up.\\u201d But on the page, at least, he is present, lively and pouring forth, though the hints of his distinctive burr may send you heading for the audiobook instead.\"]","href_hash":"23b1dc2e7af311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"23b1dc2e7af311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
