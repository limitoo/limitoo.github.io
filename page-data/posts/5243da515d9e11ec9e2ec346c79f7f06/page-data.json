Here it was, the 106th anniversary of Frank Sinatra\\u2019s birth in Hoboken, and an energetic, raucous crowd that included a handful of elite recruits overflowed Prudential Center\\u2019s lower bowl to see a men\\u2019s college basketball matchup with some verifiable juice: Seton Hall hosting Rutgers.\", \"It is hard to recall the last time New Jersey\\u2019s flagship basketball schools \\u2014 one of which views itself as a football school \\u2014 were fighting each other for supremacy rather than relevance.\", \"But then Thursday happened. Moments after Seton Hall vanquished seventh-ranked Texas \\u2014 the Pirates\\u2019 second win over a top-10 team this season \\u2014 Rutgers did them several turns better, shocking No. 1 Purdue on Ron Harper Jr.\\u2019s buzzer-beating heave from just inside the half-court line.\", \"The court swelled with fans, including Todd Frazier, the former Yankees and Mets third baseman and a Rutgers alumnus, who in the bedlam had to turn back to retrieve his young son. The victory raised the possibility that the Scarlet Knights might shake out of an early-season funk and find the form required to make a second consecutive appearance in the N.C.A.A. tournament, which they have not done since the mid-70s.\", \"But Seton Hall had a little too much for Rutgers on Sunday night \\u2014 too much depth, rebounding and second-half shotmaking by Bryce Aiken and Jared Rhoden \\u2014 and fended off the Scarlet Knights for a 77-63 victory.\", \"Rutgers, which dropped to 5-5, had sliced a 16-point deficit to 6 with just over six minutes left. But Aiken \\u2014 a graduate transfer from Harvard who missed most of last season with the Pirates because of injuries \\u2014 delivered down the stretch for Seton Hall, which improved to 9-1 and jumped from 23rd to 16th in the Associated Press Top 25 poll on Monday.\", \"Late in the game, with the outcome no longer in doubt and play stopped, Rhoden walked toward the band, which had exhausted its Bon Jovi playlist, and the student section, which extended into the usually closed-off upper deck, and waved his arms over his head, urging the fans to get louder.\", \"They responded with music to his ears, chanting \\u201cWe Own Jersey.\\u201d\", \"Afterward, Seton Hall took back possession of the game\\u2019s trophy \\u2014 a 33-pound memento in the shape of New Jersey made from reclaimed Asbury Park boardwalk planks (which presumably have been scrubbed of sea gull guano and ice cream drippings).\", \"Rhoden, a 6-foot-6 senior forward from Long Island, said the win was particularly meaningful to him. The teams did not play last year when their schedules were upended because of the pandemic, and the series \\u2014 which has continued on a rotating home-and-home basis since Rutgers left the Big East Conference after the 2012-13 season \\u2014 had been in doubt until Rutgers Coach Steve Pikiell agreed to play this year\\u2019s game on the road.\", \"That left Rhoden to stew for another 12 months over the last time the teams met: a 68-48 thrashing by Rutgers at the boisterous, since-rebranded Rutgers Athletic Center.\", \"Rhoden keeps a photo on his phone from that night: He\\u2019s laying on the floor after having dived for a loose ball in front of the opposing bench and a Rutgers reserve is yelling at him. \\u201cThat was something that resonated with me forever,\\u201d said Rhoden, who had 16 points and 9 rebounds on Sunday. \\u201cEvery time I think of Rutgers, I think of that moment. I knew I was going to come out here tonight and try to be a dog as much as I could.\\u201d\", \"In fact, Rhoden was so amped up that Coach Kevin Willard took him out after only a little more than two minutes \\u2014 and two missed shots \\u2014 to settle him down.\", \"Among those who appreciated that tenacity was Jerry Walker, who starred at St. Anthony, the since-shuttered Jersey City high school powerhouse, before coming to Seton Hall. He helped the Pirates reach the N.C.A.A. West Regional final in 1991 \\u2014 the last year Seton Hall and Rutgers both reached the tournament.\", \"He took part in a lunch on Friday with some former standouts at both schools, an event the organizers would like to build on to promote the game.\", \"\\u201cThis is one of these underrated rivalries,\\u201d said Walker, who runs a nonprofit for after-school programs and is a Hudson County commissioner. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like Ohio State and Michigan in football. That\\u2019s a big statement, I know.\\u201d\", \"Hyperbole aside, as college basketball returns to something resembling normal this season, there has been more ruminating among coaches and administrators about not leaning so heavily into neutral-site games and playing more marquee games on campuses. On Saturday, for example, there were several intriguing matchups featuring ranked teams that were enhanced by partisan crowds: U.C.L.A. at Marquette; Missouri at Kansas; Houston at Alabama; Arizona at Illinois; Kentucky at Notre Dame; and Arkansas at Oklahoma. Sunday provided another when Villanova played at Baylor, which moved to No. 1 on Monday.\", \"\\u201cThe environment is what\\u2019s special about college basketball,\\u201d Pikiell said. Of the rivalry with Seton Hall, he added: \\u201cIt\\u2019s obviously a great game for New Jersey, I don\\u2019t care who the coach is. I said this many times: We should always play this game.\\u201d\", \"He thanked Willard for playing the game, which was a diplomatic way of reminding everyone that Seton Hall, instead of working to reschedule the game last year after it was canceled because of the pandemic, had instead picked up a game with Penn State. And Sunday\\u2019s game, the fifth consecutive sellout in the series, wasn\\u2019t finalized until June, when Rutgers agreed to play in Newark.\", \"Neither Sunday\\u2019s win nor having some A-list recruits \\u2014 including Naas Cunningham, a 6-foot-7 wing who has visited Rutgers and is considered among the top players in the class of 2024 \\u2014 sitting behind the Seton Hall bench seemed to salve Willard\\u2019s reluctance.\", \"\\u201cI hate this game,\\u201d he said with a laugh, adding that at least he has to play Rutgers only once now that it\\u2019s in the Big Ten. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a no-win situation.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI know it\\u2019s important to the fans,\\u201d he added. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just never been that big. I\\u2019m not from New Jersey. When you\\u2019re a coach, every game is a big game \\u2014 seeding, making the tournament.\\u201d\", \"Willard paused.\", \"\\u201cI hate to ruin it for you,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"5243da515d9e11ec9e2ec346c79f7f06"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5243da515d9e11ec9e2ec346c79f7f06"}},
