It said the teen was taken from her Florida home on Saturday by someone she'd been chatting with through a video game, reportedly Free Fire Max. She took a black book bag and her cellphone when she left, but left her money behind.\", \"Henrriquez later called her mother, Ana Quintanila, at around 10 p.m. on Saturday. Crying, the teen said that she was hungry and far from home. Investigators were able to pin the phone call to North Carolina but were not able to determine where exactly in the state she might have been.\", \"\\\"I worry she could be in danger,\\\" Quintanila said.\", \"Henrriquez is reported to be 5'1\\\" and around 130 pounds. Aside from the black bag she took with her, it is unknown what sort of clothes she was wearing when she left home. Police are asking anyone with information about her whereabouts to call detectives at 305-949-2940.\", \"Police believe that the teen could now be as far away as Philadelphia, nearly 1,200 miles away from her home in North Miami Beach. Henrriquez's mother told Local 10 News on Sunday that the girl had called multiple times since that initial call and said that she regrets leaving home. Quintanila also disclosed that her daughter left a note before leaving, but did not discuss its contents.\", \"\\\"She said don't tell police and this is no one's fault,\\\" Quintanila explained.\", \"In mid-October, New Jersey teen JaShyah Moore was reported missing. Moore had left home to pick up groceries, returning briefly after realizing she'd lost the family EBT card. After she failed to return home an hour later, her mother, Jamie Moore, began to search for her and eventually reported her missing.\", \"Moore was found safe in New York City a month later and determined by police to be a runaway. Jamie Moore was charged with two counts of second-degree child endangerment, including accusations of abuse and neglect, New Jersey authorities later reported.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941204/missing-teen-miami-beach.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A teen girl was taken from her North Miami Beach, Florida, home on Saturday by someone she had been chatting with in a video game.
