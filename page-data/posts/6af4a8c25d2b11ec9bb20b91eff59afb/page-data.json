Ms. McWilliams said the regulator\\u2019s general counsel had ruled the vote, which had been taken earlier by the Democratic members, to be invalid.\", \"The dispute \\u2014 believed by some experts to be part of an effort by Democrats to unseat Ms. McWilliams \\u2014 spilled into public view last week.\", \"Mr. Chopra and two other Democrats on the board \\u2014 Martin J. Gruenberg, a longtime member, and Michael J. Hsu, the acting comptroller of the currency \\u2014 voted over email last week to request public comment on the issue of bank mergers. A statement on the request was posted not on the F.D.I.C.\\u2019s site but on the site of the consumer bureau that Mr. Chopra leads. The F.D.I.C. soon released a statement saying it had not approved such a request for comment.\", \"Now the Democrats on the board of the F.D.I.C., which is chiefly known for backing consumer deposits but has a hand in overseeing all of the country\\u2019s banks, contend that Ms. McWilliams is stonewalling attempts by the majority to set policy.\", \"The regulators spoke politely to one another during the virtual meeting on Tuesday, but Mr. Chopra released a scathing statement afterward, calling the general counsel\\u2019s decision \\u201clegally dubious.\\u201d\", \"In his own statement, Mr. Hsu said he believed \\u201cthe views of the majority of the F.D.I.C. board members should influence the agency\\u2019s agenda and actions.\\u201d\", \"A spokeswoman at the F.D.I.C. did not respond to messages seeking comment.\", \"Ms. McWilliams has mostly adhered to Republican ideological lines during her tenure. That makes her something of a barrier to President Biden\\u2019s agenda, which involves shifting the federal government\\u2019s stance on big issues like climate change and income inequality.\", \"The F.D.I.C. focuses closely on the smallest banks. It has a five-member board that typically allows input from both political parties. A fully seated board will generally consist of two Republicans and two Democrats serving six-year terms and a chair appointed for a five-year term. One seat is currently empty.\", \"The agency is just one of several regulators that play a regulatory role in the financial industry. Others include the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (overseen, for now, by Mr. Hsu) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (overseen by Mr. Chopra).\", \"Banking industry groups have urged calm and transparency. The American Bankers Association wrote to the board on Monday emphasizing the importance of an \\u201corderly, transparent policymaking process.\\u201d\", \"The head of the Consumer Bankers Association, another industry group, echoed that sentiment in an opinion essay in The Hill on Monday.\", \"\\u201cAmericans expect and deserve regulators to operate with transparency and instill certainty, especially for those tasked with overseeing financial institutions,\\u201d the group\\u2019s chief, Richard Hunt, wrote. \\u201cThe implications of potentially unstable leadership at the F.D.I.C. and other prudential regulators are especially significant.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6af4a8c25d2b11ec9bb20b91eff59afb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6af4a8c25d2b11ec9bb20b91eff59afb"}},
