The news of its authorization came as governments around the world reimposed coronavirus restrictions, bracing themselves for a surge in cases brought on by Omicron, the new variant that appears to be the most contagious form of the disease yet. Its quick spread underscored the urgency of addressing vaccine inequity globally to stamp out the pandemic.\", \"The approval of Novavax, which was expected to make up a significant portion of the world\\u2019s vaccine supply, could bring important change. Novavax announced an agreement in February to supply 1.1 billion doses to Covax, a United Nations-backed initiative to deliver vaccines to low- and middle-income countries. In September, Covax had to cut its projected delivery of doses in 2021 by a quarter, in part because Novavax had yet to win authorization for its vaccine.\", \"The gap in vaccination rates between high-income countries, many of which now urge booster shots for most adults, and low-income countries remains staggering. Novavax\\u2019s clearance by the W.H.O. is likely to help bolster vaccine supplies for some of the world\\u2019s most at-risk populations.\", \"\\u201cThis listing aims to increase access particularly in lower-income countries, 41 of which have still not been able to vaccinate 10 percent of their populations, while 98 countries have not reached 40 percent,\\u201d Dr. Mari\\u00e2ngela Sim\\u00e3o, the W.H.O.\\u2019s assistant director general for access to medicines, said in a statement.\", \"Novavax was the ninth vaccine granted emergency approval by the W.H.O.\", \"Unlike Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech\\u2019s mRNA vaccines, Novavax deploys an older technology that uses nanoparticles made of spike proteins to evoke an immune response. It can also be stored and shipped in normal refrigeration temperatures, increasing its accessibility for more countries.\", \"Though it has been troubled by production delays, Novavax\\u2019s vaccine, which is a two-dose regimen, proved highly effective in clinical trials in the United States and abroad. In a trial involving about 30,000 people, the vaccine demonstrated an overall efficacy of 90.4 percent, according to results published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. Novavax\\u2019s efficacy against moderate or severe disease was 100 percent.\", \"Novavax won its first authorization from Indonesia last month, and soon after was approved for use in the Philippines. The company also said it would submit an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the end of the year.\"]","href_hash":"033d34705faa11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"033d34705faa11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
