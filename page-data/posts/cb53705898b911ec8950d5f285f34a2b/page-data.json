Jeter became CEO of the Marlins in September 2017 when Bruce Sherman bought the team from Jeffrey Loria.\", \"A five-time World Series champion during a playing career from 1995-2014 spent entirely with the Yankees, Jeter earned election to baseball's Hall of Fame in 2020.\", \"Miami went 218-327 during his four seasons at the helm, finishing with a winning record only once at 31-29 in the pandemic-shortened 2020 season. In the full seasons under Jeter, the Marlins went 63-98, 57-105 and 67-95.\", \"While the Yankees are among baseball's highest spenders, Miami was 27th among the 30 teams in payroll last year at $61 million.\", \"\\\"I will no longer serve as CEO nor as a shareholder in the club,\\\" Jeter said in a statement released through PR Newswire rather than the Marlins. \\\"We had a vision five years ago to turn the Marlins franchise around, and as CEO, I have been proud to put my name and reputation on the line to make our plan a reality. Through hard work, trust and accountability, we transformed every aspect of the franchise, reshaping the workforce, and developing a long-term strategic plan for success.\", \"\\\"That said, the vision for the future of the franchise is different than the one I signed up to lead.\\\"\", \"In a separate statement, Sherman thanked Jeter \\\"for his many contributions and wish him luck in his future endeavors.\\\"\", \"\\\"We have a deep bench of talent that will oversee both business and baseball decisions while we work to identify a new CEO to lead our franchise, \\\" Sherman said. \\\"The ownership group is committed to keep investing in the future of the franchise -- and we are determined to build a team that will return to the postseason and excite Marlins fans and the local community.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"cb53705898b911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cb53705898b911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
