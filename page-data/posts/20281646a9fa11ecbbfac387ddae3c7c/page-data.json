Tui moving to goal attack gave her confidence too.\", \"While the Mystics grew their lead to 15 at one point in the second spell, the Steel reeled it back to draw the quarter, trailing 32-22 at halftime.\", \"Peta Toeava was injected into the game at wing attack to start the third quarter, with Filda Vui replacing Falkner (who'd shot 10 from 11) at goal attack.\", \"It was a much more decisive Steel who returned to the court, and with Burley switching with Te Huinga Reo Selby-Rickit to sit back on Nweke at goal keep, they closed the gap to six.\", \"Karaka was in and out of the game after a heavy fall, with young defender Carys Stythe given an opportunity to show her skills in the Mystics defence. But there was no doubting the strength of Karaka and Fitzpatrick, teaming up with Sokolich-Beatson at wing defence, and how quickly the score would swing back in the Mystics favour when they were together.\", \"It was reflected on the scoreboard at the end of the third quarter, the Mystics back in control up 47-35.\", \"Toeava's incredible range of skills were on show, and her understanding with Nweke is unrivalled; the goal shoot sinking 50 from 52 attempts. Sokolich-Beatson was a critical cog in the Mystics machine, and with some trademark intercepts from Fitzpatrick, the score difference was pushed well outside the Steel's reach.\", \"Shooting Stats - Steel:\", \"George Fisher 24/28 (86%)\", \"Saviour Tui 19/25 (76%)\", \"Georgia Heffernan 7/10 (70%)\", \"Shooting Stats - Mystics:\", \"Grace Nweke 50/52 (96%)\", \"Filda Vui 10/11 (91%)\", \"Monica Falkner 10/12 (83%)\", \"MVP: Sulu Fitzpatrick (Mystics)\"]","href_hash":"20281646a9fa11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"20281646a9fa11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
