It was there that he encountered Joseph Rosenbaum, one of the men fatally shot, AP reported.\", \"Lackowski said Rosenbaum \\\"asked very bluntly to shoot him\\\" and mimed a few steps forward as if to \\\"entice someone to do something.\\\" Lackowski demonstrated what he described as \\\"false stepping\\\" by taking a small step and slightly lurching forward before stopping.\", \"However, he said that he perceived Rosenbaum as a \\\"babbling idiot\\\" rather than a true threat and ignored him, according to AP. His description contrasted earlier testimony that Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, might have viewed Rosenbaum as a threat.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927411/rittenhouse-trial-underway.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A witness who testified in the trial for Kyle Rittenhouse said that one of the men Rittenhouse shot was acting \\u201cbelligerently\\u201d but did not appear to be a threat. Above, Rittenhouse looks back as Susan Hughes, the great aunt of Anthony Huber, one of the men fatally shot, enters the courtroom during his trial at the Kenosha County Courthouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on November 5, 2021.</div>\", \"Rittenhouse is white, as were those he shot. Prosecutors have portrayed Rittenhouse as the instigator of the bloodshed, while his lawyer has argued that he acted in self-defense, suggesting among other things that Rittenhouse feared his weapon would be taken away and used against him.\", \"On Thursday, Richie McGinniss, who was recording events on a cellphone that night for the conservative website The Daily Caller, testified that Rosenbaum chased Rittenhouse and was gunned down as he lunged for the young man's rifle.\", \"A state crime lab DNA analyst testified Friday that she tested the barrel guard from Rittenhouse's rifle and did not find DNA from Rosenbaum or the other man killed that night, Anthony Huber. But Amber Rasmussen said she received no swabs from the actual barrel of the gun and would have no way of knowing if Rosenbaum touched it.\", \"Under cross-examination by Rittenhouse attorney Corey Chirafasi, Rasmussen was shown still images of Huber and Rittenhouse and agreed they appeared to show Huber touching the rifle. She also acknowledged that the absence of Huber's DNA on the gun doesn't mean he didn't touch it.\", \"Also Thursday, Ryan Balch, a former Army infantryman who carried an AR-style rifle that night and walked around patrolling the streets with Rittenhouse, testified that Rosenbaum was \\\"hyperaggressive and acting out in a violent manner,\\\" including trying to set fires and throwing rocks. Rosenbaum also angrily threatened to \\\"f------ kill\\\" both Balch and Rittenhouse, Balch testified.\", \"In testifying about what they were doing in Kenosha, Lackowski and Balch both used military terminology that reflected their backgrounds. Lackowski referred to \\\"areas of occupation,\\\" talked about taking up his \\\"post\\\" in a parking lot, and said he was trained in \\\"shout, shove, show, shoot.\\\"\", \"\\\"You shout, you shove, you show your firearm and you shoot,\\\" Lackowski explained.\", \"Balch used the term \\\"plate carrier,\\\" which he explained means body armor. He gave a detailed explanation of the differences between full metal jacket bullets and hollow points, and talked about ensuring the armed citizens in Kenosha that night worked in pairs to protect each other.\", \"According to testimony, Rosenbaum, 36, was unarmed and did not hurt anyone that night.\", \"His killing has emerged as one of the most crucial moments that night and one of the few not clearly captured on video. It set in motion the bloodshed that followed moments later.\", \"Rittenhouse shot and killed Huber, a 26-year-old protester seen on bystander video hitting Rittenhouse with a skateboard. Rittenhouse then wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, 27, who had a gun in his hand as he stepped toward Rittenhouse.\", \"Rittenhouse could get life in prison if convicted in the case that has stirred furious debate over self-defense, vigilantism, the right to bear arms and the racial unrest that erupted around the U.S. after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and other cases like it.\", \"Before court resumed Friday, the judge granted the request of a pregnant juror to be dismissed because she was experiencing discomfort. She was the second juror dismissed: A retired man was dropped from the case Thursday after making a joke about Blake's shooting.\", \"Eighteen people remain on the panel: Twelve will be designated to decide the case; the rest are alternates.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927416/jason-lackowski-testifies.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Kyle Rittenhouse is accused of killing two people and wounding a third during a protest over police brutality in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year.
