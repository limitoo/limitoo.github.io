The intensive care units specifically designated for COVID-19 patients are already at 90 percent occupation.\", \"Jung Eun-Kyeong, commissioner of KDCA, said South Korean's in their 60's and older make up 42 percent of the virus patients that were deemed in serious or critical condition. However, less than 8 percent of that age group are unvaccinated or not fully vaccinated.\", \"Officials for the KDCA said there are 4,100 new coronavirus cases that came directly from the capital, Seoul, and the surrounding regions. There's a total of 5,266 new cases for the country making it break its daily record for new cases for the second day in a row.\", \"The country had 47 patients die in the past 24 hours with a total death toll of 3,705.\", \"Jung worried that with the new Omicron variant entering the country people will postpone getting their booster shots until pharmaceutical companies create a new vaccine to target the variant.\", \"\\\"It's not yet clear how exactly omicron would affect the effectiveness of vaccines, but it's not like existing vaccines would be completely useless or provide significantly less protection\\\" against the new variant, Jung said.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944164/seoul-south-korea-covid-19-testing.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Health officials said South Korean's in their 60's and older make up 42 percent of the virus patients that were deemed in serious or critical condition.

Among the nine who were confirmed or suspected of Omicron infection, only the couple who arrived on November 24 was vaccinated, the KDCA said.\", \"The country will require all passengers arriving from abroad over the next two weeks to quarantine for at least 10 days, regardless of their nationality or vaccination status.
