So our writer is keeping some of her secrets.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-08T18:56:46.000Z","content":"[\"I\\u2019m not going to tell you what the hostess said to Emily Ratajkowski. Instead, I will tell you this: We are having lunch at a restaurant. We consult the restaurant\\u2019s menu, which boasts many items. Ratajkowski, a model who first became famous for appearing naked in a music video, orders something. I, who have never been in a music video but have been naked many times, also order something. We remark casually on the restaurant\\u2019s ambience, noting its proximity to various locations. I turn on my recorder. Each of us is wearing clothes.\", \"We are here to talk about Ratajkowski\\u2019s new book, \\u201cMy Body.\\u201d In it, she reflects on her fraught relationship with the huge number of photographs of her body that have come to define her life and career. The book\\u2019s marquee essay, \\u201cBuying Myself Back,\\u201d which describes how Ratajkowski ended up purchasing a print of her own Instagram post from the appropriation artist Richard Prince, was published to great notice in New York magazine last fall. Ratajkowski also wrote that the photographer Jonathan Leder sexually assaulted her in his home after a photo shoot when she was 20.\", \"At lunch, Ratajkowski explains that New York magazine took \\u201cBuying Myself Back\\u201d from her book proposal. In fact, she began working on \\u201cMy Body\\u201d without anyone but herself in mind, jotting down notes on her phone as they occurred to her. One day she realized she was writing a book. Several times, Ratajkowski characterizes writing as a means of \\u201corganizing\\u201d her own thoughts \\u2014 not as an act of branding but out of what strikes me as the genuine curiosity of a woman whom constant exposure has deprived of the possibility of self-knowledge.\", \"But Ratajkowski knows she is in an impossible position as a model-turned-writer. Indeed, the author has spent her career dodging the backhanded compliment that she is the \\u201cthinking man\\u2019s naked woman.\\u201d Failure will be met with schadenfreude; success, with smug surprise. Someone recently asked her who her ghostwriter was. Others asked if her face is on the book\\u2019s cover. (It isn\\u2019t.) After \\u201cBuying Myself Back\\u201d came out, a journalist unearthed a 2018 profile in Marie Claire in which the writer Thomas Chatterton Williams lavishly praised her breasts while expressing surprise that she\\u2019d read Roberto Bola\\u00f1o\\u2019s daunting novel \\u201c2666.\\u201d An irritated Ratajkowski tweeted her exhaustion with profiles that have boiled down to \\u201cShe has breasts AND claims to read.\\u201d\", \"We cannot see ourselves. This is an existential fact, as sure as death. Yes, we can look down at our limbs and trunks, but we cannot enter our own regard as subjects; we cannot see ourselves seeing. For a model, this existential fact is promoted, or relegated, to a professional one. \\u201cI don\\u2019t even know what I look like anymore,\\u201d Ratajkowski confesses to me. \\u201cI can\\u2019t even tell what\\u2019s a good or bad picture in the same way. It\\u2019s just another picture.\\u201d Sixteen years in the modeling industry \\u2014 over half her lifetime \\u2014 have left Ratajkowski burned out and grasping for narrative.\", \"With \\u201cMy Body,\\u201d Ratajkowski has created a new mirror for glimpsing her own reflection. Some essays recount the author\\u2019s hustle as a young model who often found herself in troubling situations with powerful men; another is written as a long, venomous reply to an email from a photographer who has bragged of discovering her. Throughout, Ratajkowski is hoping to set the record straight: She is neither victim nor stooge, neither a cynical collaborator in the male agenda, as her critics have argued, nor some pop-feminist empoweree, as she herself once supposed. Today she is just a girl, standing in front of 28 million Instagram followers, asking them to take her seriously.\", \"Whether she\\u2019ll succeed remains to be seen. While Ratajkowski wrote \\u201cMy Body\\u201d to reassert control of her image, publishing it will mean releasing yet another piece of herself into the world. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the misery and the joy of it,\\u201d she tells me, comparing the process to giving birth to her son, now 8 months old. In the book, Ratajkowski remembers asking for a mirror when she was in labor, so she could see her body. \\u201cI wanted to witness its progress,\\u201d she writes. This is a modest goal, and equally profound, especially for someone who is looked at for a living \\u2014 to regard oneself, without preconception or judgment.\", \"Photography, for all its ambition, cannot bear witness; nor, for that matter, can the mirror, save perhaps in moments of rapture or deep quietude. Before the mirror, we had the mysteries of water to betray our forms; before that, the glowing eyes of another animal. Ratajkowski knows there is something hungry in the camera. It takes what it wants and holds it forever \\u2014 \\u201clike a footprint or a death mask,\\u201d as Susan Sontag wrote. To cope, Ratajkowski has internalized the gaze; walking a red carpet, she hears the clicking of photographers and knows, as if by echolocation, what each photo will look like \\u2014 and that none will capture the real her. Ever since her private photos were posted to 4chan by hackers, she has started to assume that every picture taken of her will become public, just to quell her anxiety. \\u201cThere are no images that are just for myself,\\u201d Ratajkowski remarks sadly.\", \"The phrase reverberates in my mind as we talk. \\u201cFor better or worse, I\\u2019ve always been drawn to overexposure,\\u201d Ratajkowski writes in \\u201cMy Body,\\u201d describing the thrill she still gets when uploading a photo of herself to Instagram. I\\u2019m drawn to exposure, too; I\\u2019ve written extensively about my own body, and like Ratajkowski, I\\u2019m ambivalent about the attention it has won me. (I can confidently say it\\u2019s why I was assigned this article.) \\u201cI knew that when I met you,\\u201d Ratajkowski discloses later; it\\u2019s why she feels comfortable talking to me. But if I\\u2019m sympathetic to her compulsion, I\\u2019m not doing her any favors by writing a profile about her, which is just another kind of portrait. Then again, she was the one who called it \\u201cMy Body.\\u201d\", \"Could we help each other out, one woman to another? In this context, the idea of equality would be a fantasy; we cannot step outside our roles and histories and meet, as it were, in the wild. But it could be interesting to try. I ask Ratajkowski if she would like to take some Polaroids with me. As I imagine it, we would take photos of ourselves, by ourselves, and then share them with each other \\u2014 and no one else. Ratajkowski interjects. \\u201cIt would be about the experience of taking them,\\u201d she says simply: how we felt, whether we could trust each other, whether we could see each other, ourselves. She agrees to the exercise, fascinated by the idea of a photograph of herself that, by some miracle, nobody will ever see. \\u201cI do love the idea of our bodies being in conversation,\\u201d she later tells me. I am struck by the tenderness of her remark. When I ask what we should do with the photos afterward, Ratajkowski smiles. \\u201cWe have to set them on fire.\\u201d\", \"Ratajkowski was born in London in 1991, but raised in Encinitas, Calif., a surf town outside San Diego. Her mother was an English professor; her father, a painter and high school art teacher. The house where she grew up, which her father built himself, was filled with eccentric details: mismatched doorknobs, exposed beams and walls that stopped short of the roof. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an artist\\u2019s house,\\u201d her mother would tell guests sheepishly. As a girl, Ratajkowski would be awakened by \\u201cthe rhythmic sound of my parents having sex\\u201d \\u2014 or more often, their vicious screaming matches. She would sink onto the floor of her bedroom and play with imaginary friends until it ended. But even when the house was silent, Ratajkowski writes, \\u201cI could hear my parents\\u2019 thoughts.\\u201d\", \"Early in \\u201cMy Body,\\u201d Ratajkowski describes a diptych of herself and her mother as young girls; when guests see the photos in her parents\\u2019 living room, they ask who is who. From a young age, she sensed that her mother felt entitled to her beauty, \\u201clike a piece of bequeathed jewelry.\\u201d Ratajkowski\\u2019s parents, and especially her beauty-obsessed mother, took immense pride in their daughter\\u2019s modeling career, which began when she was 14. When, as an adult, Ratajkowski finally persuaded her mother to take down an ostentatiously placed print from an old photo shoot, the latter responded matter-of-factly, \\u201cYou\\u2019re more beautiful than that now.\\u201d\", \"This is a portrait of a young girl with no privacy and a single avenue for self-worth. In bed, Ratajkowski prayed for beauty, squeezing her eyes shut to \\u201cfocus on the expanding spots of light behind my eyelids,\\u201d developing the wish like a photograph. As a teenager, she would scrutinize herself in her bedroom\\u2019s full-length mirror, which her father first hung for a ballerina ex-girlfriend. In her freshman year at San Dieguito Academy, where her father taught painting, word spread that \\u201cRata\\u2019s daughter models.\\u201d After graduating from high school, Ratajkowski studied art for a year at U.C.L.A. before dropping out to pursue modeling full time, appearing fully naked on the cover of Treats, an artsy Playboy imitator, in 2012. She liked to tell friends that the French word for \\u201cmodel\\u201d was \\u201cmannequin.\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m a mannequin for a living,\\u201d she would say, shrugging ambivalently.\", \"The Treats pictorial caught the eye of the recording artist Robin Thicke, who recommended Ratajkowski for the music video for his 2013 single \\u201cBlurred Lines.\\u201d The unrated version of the video, which YouTube censors removed within a week of its posting, featured Ratajkowski and two other models flouncing around in nude thongs next to Thicke and his collaborators T.I. and Pharrell Williams. \\u201cBlurred Lines\\u201d arrived at the peak of the feminist blogosphere \\u2014 an unfederated group of scrappy writers and websites that approached the crude oil of personal experience with the blowtorch of moral certitude \\u2014 and bloggers seized upon the video as an emblem of \\u201crape culture.\\u201d \\u201cI know you want it,\\u201d sang Thicke, a declaration of predation putatively excused by the nudity.\", \"The controversy rocketed a bewildered Ratajkowski to international fame. \\u201cI and, more specifically, the politics of my body were suddenly being discussed and dissected across the globe by feminist thinkers and teenage boys alike,\\u201d she recalls. When Ratajkowski told reporters she had found the experience \\u201cempowering,\\u201d some dismissed her as complicit in her own victimization \\u2014 or worse, a clueless agent of rape culture. At the time, Ratajkowski responded defiantly; these days, she\\u2019s not so sure. She knows that her fashion-week invitations, brand ambassadorships and short-lived film career (she played Ben Affleck\\u2019s topless mistress in \\u201cGone Girl\\u201d), to say nothing of her massive Instagram platform where she hawks bikinis and endorsed Bernie Sanders \\u2014 this is all the fruit of male attention.\", \"Perhaps. The language of objectification has followed Ratajkowski like a hungry dog for her whole career, waiting for her to let down her guard. Her reputation as thoughtful and well read, coupled with her support of socialist policies, has only heightened for her the growing expectation that famously beautiful women be able to justify, politically, the act of being famously beautiful. Caught in the wrong video at the wrong time, Ratajkowski became an effigy for the exhaustion of a pop-feminist framework; if the author of \\u201cMy Body\\u201d cannot decide whether her success has been empowering or not, that\\u2019s because this is a trick question.\", \"It is by transforming one\\u2019s body into an object that one can sell it; it is by selling it that one may gain food, housing, status, influence and, yes, \\u201cpower.\\u201d This is as true for the poorest sex worker as it is for the most celebrated actress; it is also true, by the way, for Amazon workers, short-order cooks and (my neck hurts as I write this) magazine writers. I am not mocking our differences; I am saying that the experience of becoming an object for pay is so general as to be trivial. That the tiny sliver of this experience to do with female sexuality should be singled out by feminists for censure reflects, certainly in Ratajkowski\\u2019s case, a gratuitous inflation of male power\\u2019s scope and reach.\", \"Accordingly, the best parts of \\u201cMy Body\\u201d are when Ratajkowski realizes that the best way to stop thinking about the male gaze is to think about something else instead. \\u201cI\\u2019m very obsessed with women,\\u201d she tells me. When Ratajkowski arrived on the set of \\u201cBlurred Lines,\\u201d she was pleased to find that the director Diane Martel had stacked the crew with women; for many hours, Thicke and the song\\u2019s other co-writers weren\\u2019t even present. Ratajkowski remembers wiggling around in her platform sneakers \\u201cridiculously, loosely, the way I would to entertain my girlfriends.\\u201d The \\u201cBlurred Lines\\u201d video, viewed today, is clearly self-parodic. If anything, with its mismatched props, barnyard animals and flat beige cyclorama, it depicts a group of attractive people amusingly failing to make a music video. \\u201cThere\\u2019s something risky and sexy about relationships with other women when you\\u2019re aware of the gaze, but the gaze isn\\u2019t there physically,\\u201d Ratajkowski observes.\", \"But the blurred lines between one woman and the next, unacceptable to misogynists and many feminists, too, will most likely disappear next to Ratajkowski\\u2019s allegations that a drunk Robin Thicke cupped her bare breasts during the shoot. \\u201cI felt naked for the first time that day,\\u201d she writes, ashamed that it would take her years to call it sexual harassment. The allegations have already leaked to the tabloids, which have cast Ratajkowski as a helpless victim. \\u201cRemind me why I decided to do this?\\u201d she texted me after The New York Post called her childhood \\u201csad\\u201d and \\u201csexualized.\\u201d (Representatives for Thicke didn\\u2019t respond to requests for comment.)\", \"The book contains many accounts of violation, sexual and otherwise. In one essay, it is not until after the death of Ratajkowski\\u2019s first boyfriend, who she says raped her when she was 14, that she is able to whisper to herself, \\u201cOwen, no.\\u201d (Owen is a pseudonym.) In \\u201cBuying Myself Back,\\u201d Ratajkowski is incredulous when she is sued for posting a paparazzi photo to Instagram; horrified when hackers leak her nudes on 4chan; furious when Jonathan Leder, who she says digitally penetrated her without her consent, publishes Polaroids of her with an allegedly forged release form. (Leder has said that Ratajkowski\\u2019s allegations are \\u201ctoo tawdry and childish to respond to,\\u201d telling a fact checker for New York magazine, \\u201cThis is the girl that was naked in Treats magazine and bounced around naked in the Robin Thicke video at that time. You really want someone to believe she was a victim?\\u201d)\", \"But the author of \\u201cMy Body\\u201d has no investment in herself as a victim. If the men who hurt Ratajkowski in \\u201cMy Body\\u201d are predators, she does not depict them as predatory. On the contrary, they are small, insecure people desperate to prove themselves, as pathetic as they are powerful. As Ratajkowski is quick to note, her experiences are neither disintegrating, even when traumatic, nor especially unique; her point is simply that they are no one\\u2019s but her own.\", \"Instead of focusing on her damage \\u2014 she considers suing Leder, but says he isn\\u2019t worth the trouble \\u2014 Ratajkowski would rather create. \\u201cMy Body\\u201d is only one example of that. Last May, she cleverly auctioned off an NFT, or nonfungible token, of a photo of herself standing next to the Richard Prince print, coolly reappropriating Prince\\u2019s appropriation of her image. (The NFT sold for $175,000 through Christie\\u2019s.) There was cheerful wit here, and more deliberateness in her self-presentation than the model took earlier in her career. These days, Ratajkowski is not looking for vengeance, or even recognition, but something quieter.\", \"For the book\\u2019s epigraph, Ratajkowski selected a lucid passage from the late John Berger\\u2019s influential book \\u201cWays of Seeing,\\u201d adapted from the 1972 television series of the same name. \\u201cYou painted a naked woman because you enjoyed looking at her, you put a mirror in her hand and you called the painting \\u2018Vanity,\\u2019 thus morally condemning the woman whose nakedness you had depicted for your own pleasure,\\u201d Berger wrote, addressing an Everyman painter. \\u201cThe real function of the mirror was otherwise. It was to make the woman connive in treating herself as, first and foremost, a sight.\\u201d The point is clear: If Ratajkowski is complicit in being looked at, the crime is ours for looking.\", \"When I have told female friends that I am writing about Emily Ratajkowski, most have asked me some variation on the question \\u201cSo how hot is she, really?\\u201d We often forget that, when we speak of women\\u2019s envy for one another, we are also speaking of the ever-present gap, hardly unique to women, between one\\u2019s self-image and one\\u2019s reflection in the mirror. Indeed, it is a particular cruelty of popular feminism to have mistaken the universally alienating experience of examining one\\u2019s reflection for a uniquely female one, solvable through self-love and political consciousness. \\u201cI hate women who compare themselves to other women,\\u201d Ratajkowski imagines yelling at her therapist in \\u201cMy Body,\\u201d knowing she is talking about herself. But feminism can be just as competitive as any beauty pageant: yet another mirror in which to examine one\\u2019s blemishes, and yet another means \\u2014 the irony is exquisite \\u2014 of comparing oneself with other women.\", \"For what is wrong with wanting to be beautiful? Pop-feminism, for its part, is so preoccupied with criticizing what we rotely call \\u201cconventional beauty standards\\u201d that it has surprisingly little to say about beauty. It may be tempting, given the evidence of Ratajkowski\\u2019s own career, to deny the possibility of a beauty that would transcend male taste, at least in this world. Of course, the imagined saturation of the beautiful by male preference is immediately disproved by the existence of at least one lesbian (me); but it is further refuted if we acknowledge that the envy that heterosexual women have for one another is indeed an authentic expression of female desire.\", \"When Ratajkowski was 15, beauty\\u2019s name was Sadie. Tall and magnetic, Sadie was a cool girl in the \\u201cGone Girl\\u201d sense \\u2014 eating burritos, getting high, hanging with a crew of skater boys. Ratajkowski was in awe. \\u201cSadie seemed dangerous,\\u201d she remembers, \\u201clike she was built of weapons she had yet to master.\\u201d That year she fell into the older girl\\u2019s gravity, catching rides with her to the Ford modeling agency in Los Angeles (Ratajkowski helped her friend sign) and attending drunken house parties where Sadie would play fight with boys until she collapsed on the concrete.\", \"After high school, the two fell out of touch. Sadie went off to college in San Francisco, then to art school in Los Angeles. Ratajkowski, after a year at U.C.L.A., dropped out to focus on modeling, commuting from San Diego to Los Angeles for catalog jobs. When she was 19, she showed up at a casting for Treats. Waiting at the studio, Ratajkowski spotted a large poster for \\u201cBlow-Up,\\u201d the 1966 film about a fashion photographer by the Italian director Michelangelo Antonioni, his first English-language work. \\u201cI love that film,\\u201d she told Treats\\u2019 founder Steve Shaw, who excitedly produced a book of Helmut Newton photographs to show her the tasteful nudity he was after. Then he asked her to take her clothes off. \\u201cA mere mention of a pretentious film \\u2014 it was so easy to subvert your expectations,\\u201d Ratajkowski writes in an essay addressed to Shaw. But she hadn\\u2019t feigned her admiration for \\u201cBlow-Up,\\u201d which she watched in high school, struck by the desperation of the film\\u2019s beautiful models. She even owned the same poster, which features the film\\u2019s protagonist straddling the German supermodel Veruschka as he searches for the perfect shot.\", \"Later in \\u201cBlow-Up,\\u201d the fashion photographer, whose name is Thomas, wanders into a park and takes candid photos of a pair of lovers. When he enlarges the photos, Thomas is startled to notice a gunman hiding in the bushes, as well as what might be a dead body. But before investigating further, he is interrupted by two aspiring models who demand that he photograph them. When he gropes one of them, she panics and gestures at her friend. \\u201cShe\\u2019s got a better figure than me!\\u201d she squeals. In the infamous sequence that follows, the girls end up rolling around laughing on one of Thomas\\u2019s paper backdrops while he peels off their nylons. \\u201cMuch was made of the nudity in 1967,\\u201d remembered the late film critic Roger Ebert. \\u201cToday, the sex seems tame, and what makes the audience gasp is the hero\\u2019s contempt for women.\\u201d\", \"But does the male gaze really have any more control over what it sees than Thomas does in the park? All photographs are clues in search of a mystery; they tell us something happened, but they do not say what. This is as true of \\u201cBlurred Lines\\u201d as it is of \\u201cBlow-Up,\\u201d right down to the possible crime. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know that a woman giggling sheepishly means what these male directors think it means,\\u201d Ratajkowski says to me, wondering how the actresses must have felt on set. The sequence is far too chaotic to be choreographed. The models tug at each other\\u2019s bodies, crunch awkwardly on the paper beneath them. They are as interested in each other\\u2019s bodies as they are in the photographer, who remains mostly clothed; when they first wrestle each other to the ground, Thomas is not even in the room. What kind of sex the models have offscreen with him \\u2014 or with each other \\u2014 is left to our imagination.\", \"When I ask if she thinks her friendship with Sadie had a sexual charge, Ratajkowski is hesitant. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know if it was true homoeroticism because I do think it was about male desire,\\u201d she answers, recalling how much the boys at school liked seeing the two of them together. When they were alone, Ratajkowski was unsure what the older girl could possibly want from her. On the weekends, the two friends would crash with Sadie\\u2019s boyfriend, Mike, the three of them crammed onto one bed together. One night, Ratajkowski awoke to the feeling of Mike\\u2019s hands on her bare breasts; Sadie lay beside her, still asleep. Ratajkowski rolled over out of his reach, and never told Sadie. \\u201cI told myself that in choosing to reach over Sadie\\u2019s body to touch mine, Mike had complimented me,\\u201d she writes. \\u201cI knew that if Sadie found out, she\\u2019d blame me.\\u201d\", \"Ratajkowski, Sadie, Mike \\u2014 this is a classic triangulation. But what does it mean? \\u201cDid it give me some power over her?\\u201d Ratajkowski wonders in retrospect. \\u201cI even started to convince myself that I liked the feel of Mike\\u2019s touch. Maybe I was into it? Turned on even?\\u201d Mike had crossed a line, yes. But if anything was arousing, it wasn\\u2019t his attention but the prospect of Sadie\\u2019s jealousy. \\u201cYour boyfriend likes my boobs better than yours,\\u201d Ratajkowski imagines needling her friend. And as for Mike? If the author\\u2019s teenage attraction to her friend indirectly expressed the lust of skater boys and male photographers \\u2014 that is, if Ratajkowski liked Sadie because boys liked Sadie \\u2014 then it is equally plausible that Mike\\u2019s fumbling betrayed the intuition that his girlfriend\\u2019s relationship with Ratajkowski had, at root, nothing to do with him. (Sadie and Mike are pseudonyms.)\", \"My point is that heterosexual male desire \\u2014 that vaunted juggernaut of psychic space \\u2014 is just as often a convenient vehicle for women, gay or straight, to reach one another. I ask Ratajkowski if she has seen \\u201cThe Unbearable Lightness of Being,\\u201d the 1988 adaptation of Milan Kundera\\u2019s novel about a love triangle. (She has.) In the film, a photographer named Tereza asks her friend Sabina, an artist whom Tereza correctly suspects of being her husband\\u2019s mistress, to pose nude for some photographs. Initially meek, Tereza begins to order Sabina around, pushing her naked body into the carpet; behind the lens, Tereza is crying. When they are finished, Sabina slips on her robe and snatches the camera. \\u201cTake off your clothes,\\u201d she says, pinning Tereza to the couch and miming sex. By the end of the sequence, the two women have collapsed in laughter.\", \"Ratajkowski remarks on the husband\\u2019s absent presence in the scene. \\u201cThere\\u2019s this very clear power thing where the women are both aware of how men look at them, and specifically one man,\\u201d she says, \\u201cand yet they also have their own relationship.\\u201d Then she asks me for my reading. I tell her that the women are trying the camera on like an article of clothing, experimenting with the gaze, seeing if they can see each other. They are nervous, titillated, ashamed, jealous, vicious. They role-play as Tereza\\u2019s husband; they role-play as each other. They want to humiliate each other, and they almost have sex. Their laughter, like the laughter of the groupies in \\u201cBlow-Up,\\u201d expresses both the futility of escaping and the fact that, somehow, they already have.\", \"I arrive first at the studio, a cavernous space with massive windows overlooking SoHo. Before the official photo shoot for this article, Ratajkowski and I are going to take the Polaroids we discussed. In the dressing room, I take a seat in front of a vanity lined with glowing light bulbs and exchange a few halting words with Ratajkowski\\u2019s publicist and stylist. In my tote bag are two lighters, a box of matches and a little brass pot, for fire safety. The night before, Ratajkowski told me she was excited to destroy the photos. \\u201cThe chemical inside the Polaroids is sticky,\\u201d she texted.\", \"Ratajkowski walks in a few minutes later. Unprompted, she tells me she\\u2019s been meaning to read \\u201cCamera Lucida,\\u201d a book on photography by the French writer Roland Barthes that I mentioned to her in passing. Barthes built the book around an old photograph of his mother as a young girl standing in a glass conservatory. Discovering the photo while sorting through her possessions, the grieving writer felt that he could glimpse in the faded image the full being of his late mother. Nevertheless, Barthes refused to print the photograph in the book. \\u201cIt exists only for me,\\u201d he told his readers. \\u201cFor you it would be nothing but an indifferent picture.\\u201d Shortly after the book was published in 1980, Barthes himself died after being hit by a laundry van in Paris. \\u201cLet\\u2019s hope that doesn\\u2019t happen to us,\\u201d Ratajkowski quips.\", \"We retire to the greenroom upstairs with a vintage Polaroid camera provided by a crew member. Ratajkowski suggests that we photograph each other in addition to ourselves; I agree. To decide who goes first, we play rock, paper, scissors. \\u201cPaper covers rock,\\u201d she says triumphantly, before realizing we hadn\\u2019t specified what winning meant. She\\u2019s up, I say. \\u201cYou just want me to go first,\\u201d she teases, picking up the camera. I step outside, closing the door behind me, and sit at the top of the stairs. I can hear echoes of the crew setting up for the shoot below.\", \"The door opens. Ratajkowski hands me the camera, grinning. \\u201cYou\\u2019re up.\\u201d Alone, I hop up on a long table opposite a full-length mirror and take two shots before letting Ratajkowski back in. With childlike solemnity, we place our undeveloped Polaroids facedown on a small bench in the room\\u2019s odd glassed-in corner, which looks out onto the studio like a private box at a stadium. Then Ratajkowski directs me to sit in a chair. I laugh when she points the camera at me, because I do not know what else to do. I know how my face will look \\u2014 and that I will not like it. When it\\u2019s my turn, I position her against a dark mahogany wall. \\u201cTell me what to do,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI like being directed.\\u201d I say, \\u201cLook away. Don\\u2019t look at me.\\u201d\", \"We seat ourselves in the glass corner. There are now eight Polaroids total: four of her, four of me. I pick up the photos Ratajkowski took of herself, and she does the same with mine. For a moment, we look. The first thing I notice is that the vanity she chose has caught the glass window across the room, producing a ghostly series of mirrored lights. I try to describe her expression to her, but to my frustration I cannot find the words. \\u201cYou know, I\\u2019m about to have a million pictures taken of myself,\\u201d Ratajkowski explains, gesturing at the studio below. She decided to make these different.\", \"Ratajkowski turns over the photos we took of each other. \\u201cOh, whoa,\\u201d she mutters. We forgot that the vintage camera didn\\u2019t have a flash; without the luminescence of a mirror, these Polaroids are dark and ethereal. In some, we are not recognizable. To my surprise, Ratajkowski can\\u2019t bring herself to destroy the photos, suggesting that we exchange them instead. \\u201cIt feels nice to take each other\\u2019s picture and then take them away,\\u201d she explains. \\u201cLike a handshake or a hug.\\u201d\", \"I\\u2019m not going to tell you what Emily Ratajkowski looks like in the Polaroids she gave me. Instead, I will tell you this: Like millions of people around the world, I have seen many pictures of Ratajkowski. Now I have seen a few more. These, no one else will ever see. Does that make them any more real than the thousands of other Emilys that Ratajkowski describes in \\u201cMy Body,\\u201d dispatched into the world with the click of a shutter? \\u201cEverybody is going to write about me in terms of what I represent in the zeitgeist,\\u201d she says wistfully as I end our final interview. \\u201cThe real Emily will get lost.\\u201d She leaves to get dressed for the big shoot and I decide to stay. I watch her pose in front of the camera, disappearing once more behind herself.\"]","href_hash":"8801daca40c511ec86a5336d99224f30"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8801daca40c511ec86a5336d99224f30"}},
