But her release has been consistently blocked, twice by then-Governor Jerry Brown and twice by Governor Gavin Newsom, both Democrats.\", \"The latest recommendation is likely headed back to Newsom after a 120-day procedural review. Van Houten is still challenging Newsom's rejection of her parole a year ago in two courts, said her attorney, Rich Pfeiffer.\", \"Pfeiffer said the commissioners on Tuesday addressed every reason governors have given for blocking her release the first four times, \\\"which will make it more difficult for Governor Newsom to do it again, but he wants votes so I predict he will reverse this grant as well.\\\"\", \"Newsom said last year that Van Houten still \\\"poses an unreasonable danger to society\\\" if released from the California Institution for Women in Riverside County outside Los Angeles.\", \"Van Houten and her boyfriend ran away to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury District during the city's Summer of Love when she was 17. She was traveling along California's coast when friends introduced her to Manson, who was living at an abandoned movie ranch on the outskirts of Los Angeles. There he recruited what he called a \\\"family\\\" to survive what he predicted would be a race war that he planned to start by committing a series of random, terrifying murders.\", \"Manson died in 2017 of natural causes at a California hospital while serving a life sentence.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"11bcd99c422711ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"11bcd99c422711ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
