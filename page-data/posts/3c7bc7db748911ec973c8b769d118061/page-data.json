His subject is nothing less than the history of anti-Black racism in the United States.\", \"For Robinson\\u2019s arguments, the historical evidence is in plain sight, yet much of it, as he promises, may be new to many viewers. He shows how the text of Article V of the Constitution shielded slavery from amendments until 1808, reads from Confederate states\\u2019 secession statements and has a chorus perform the disfavored third verse of \\u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner.\\u201d\", \"The film, directed by Emily Kunstler and Sarah Kunstler (daughters of the Chicago Seven lawyer William Kunstler), intersperses scenes of Robinson traveling the country. He visits Charleston, where fingerprints from slave labor can still be seen; Staten Island, where he meets with Eric Garner\\u2019s mother; and his native Memphis, where his parents had to devise a workaround to buy a home as a Black family.\", \"Robinson brings nuance to topics \\u2014 unconscious bias, reparations, how to deal with the fact that George Washington owned slaves \\u2014 that have become flash points in society, without ever losing the core of his progressive message. It\\u2019s a confrontational film, but never an alienating one, and so much of what\\u2019s in it is persuasive.\"]","href_hash":"3c7bc7db748911ec973c8b769d118061"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3c7bc7db748911ec973c8b769d118061"}},
