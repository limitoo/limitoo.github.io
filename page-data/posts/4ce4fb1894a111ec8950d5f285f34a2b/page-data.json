He said it would last at least 30 days. The emergency declaration must be approved by Ukraine's parliament, but a vote was expected later Wednesday. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"Ukraine is a peaceful nation,\\\" Ukrainian president Volodymir Zelensky said Wednesday. \\\"We want calm, but if we keep silent now, we will be extinct tomorrow.\\\"\", \"Russia's parliament gave the Kremlin formal permission on Tuesday to send troops into foreign territory. That could mean the territory of the separatist \\\"republics\\\" in eastern Ukraine's Donbas area, which Putin unilaterally recognized as sovereign and independent earlier this week \\u2014 or it could mean permission for a wider invasion of Ukraine.\", \"President Biden said Tuesday that Russia had begun an invasion of Ukraine, and the White House said a meeting between Secretary of State Antony Blinken and his Russian counterpart, Sergey Lavrov, which had been expected on Thursday, would no longer happen.\\u00a0\", \"That discussion was intended to lay the groundwork for a summit between Putin and Mr. Biden, but that also was off the cards.\\u00a0\", \"With the diplomatic efforts seemingly up in flames, new satellite photos appeared to show the deployment of more than 100 military vehicles and dozens of tents for troops within about 30 miles of the Ukrainian border in Belarus. Russian forces were also seen advancing toward the battlefields of the separatist Donetsk and Luhansk regions in Donbas.\", \"\\\"I have a bad feeling,\\\" Lukansk resident Tatiana said. \\\"I feel the burden in my soul. It's very difficult.\\\"\", \"\\\"You wake up and you feel all this pressure, even though people are staying positive,\\\" Kyiv resident Valeria told CBS News. \\\"It's like this tension that's growing inside. It's kind of hard.\\\"\", \"Ukrainian political analyst Taras Berezovets told CBS News that Putin can no longer hide behind the claim that it is Ukrainian rebels doing the fighting against Ukraine's military.\", \"\\\"There are now no more 'Russian proxies,' no more 'Russian-backed separatists.' It's only Russia,\\\" he said. \\\"Russia is fully responsible for whatever happens now in Donetsk and Luhansk. Completely.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"4ce4fb1894a111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4ce4fb1894a111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
