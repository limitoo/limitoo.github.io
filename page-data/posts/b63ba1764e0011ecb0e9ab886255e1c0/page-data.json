On a Friday night in October, hundreds of attendees crammed into a second-floor dance studio near the northern edge of Bogot\\u00e1 adorned with flowers, chains, corsets and long flowing wigs, their carefully painted makeup smearing as the night wore on.\", \"Contestants were vying for a grand prize, and when it came time to compete in the sex siren category, contenders pulled out all manner of props, including lollipops and bottles of liquor to tantalize the judge as they stripped down to near nudity.\", \"Sitting next to the judge, the competition\\u2019s commentator, Jhon Dewar Cordoba Valdes, known to most as Papu, chanted phrases of encouragement, interspersing his raps and rhymes and shouting various unprintable expressions for female genitalia at the dancers. These land as compliments in the lingo of ballroom, the queer subculture of dance and modeling competitions founded by Black and Latino gay men and trans women in New York City in the 1970s.\", \"Latin America\\u2019s ballroom scene is relatively new. It started in 2013 when a group of dancers began hosting vogue battles in Brazil, and has since spread to Mexico, Chile, Costa Rica, Argentina and Colombia.\", \"In Colombia, a recent viral video of voguers on public buses brought Bogot\\u00e1\\u2019s scene international attention. It also highlighted an important aspect of the culture there: While some events \\u2014 like the Met Gala-themed evening \\u2014 are held in theaters and dance studios, ballroom plays out largely in public. Street balls attract parades of participants who strut and dip for cheering crowds. And just about every Sunday, there are practice balls in Bogot\\u00e1\\u2019s Renacimiento park (until recently hosted by Papu), where dancers refine their moves as parents with baby strollers and middle-aged men in basketball shorts look on intrigued.\", \"But as the Latin American scene has expanded, so too have concerns about cultural appropriation, exploitation and inclusion. How much should ballroom culture change and adapt in a new context? Is enough being done to include Black and trans people?\", \"On the Colombian scene, few people are as outspoken about these issues as Papu, 22, who was born in Quibd\\u00f3, capital of the province Choc\\u00f3, in Colombia, but raised in New York City. Since arriving on Bogot\\u00e1\\u2019s ballroom scene in March 2020, he has been vocal about the lack of Afro-Colombian representation and insistent on respecting ballroom\\u2019s original structures, which he imbibed in New York.\", \"\\u201cThe Latin American girls don\\u2019t respect titles, they don\\u2019t respect hierarchies, they don\\u2019t follow the guidelines that were set up for ballroom,\\u201d Papu said in an interview. \\u201cThey are rebellious. They want to do whatever they want to do.\\u201d\", \"In New York, the ballroom scene was founded by the most vulnerable members of society, including homeless youth and sex workers. But across Latin America, the culture has largely been imported by white, cisgender professionally trained dancers who encounter voguing through the dance world \\u2014 and then reverse engineer ballroom as a lifestyle and community.\", \"Archie Burnett, the grandfather of the House of Ninja in New York who has helped start ballroom scenes in Mexico, Brazil and Europe, says some of these dynamics are inevitable.\", \"\\u201cWhen you have a different demographic, let\\u2019s say a white demographic that has more access to monies and resources, it\\u2019s easy to put on an event,\\u201d he said in an interview.\", \"At a ball that Papu organized in Medell\\u00edn in October, Sky Vemanei, a 32-year old nonbinary DJ from New York who has worked with ballroom scenes across Latin America, told the crowd: \\u201cBallroom is not a dance contest. And ballroom is not a fashion show. And ballroom is not \\u2018Drag Race.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Instead, Vemanei \\u2014 whose remarks were met by snaps and murmurs of approval \\u2014 said that ballroom exists specifically for dark-skinned trans people to be valued and celebrated.\", \"\\u201cIf your skin color is not dark like this,\\u201d they added, gesturing at their arm, \\u201cit is your job to create space for these people first.\\u201d\", \"Vemanei, who recently left the House of Labeija to form their own house, said in an interview that many Latin American ballroom communities \\u201cdid not have much experience with discussing white privilege or discussing whiteness in general \\u2014 and who actually belongs in ballroom and who this space was created for.\\u201d\", \"Latin America has 130 million people of African descent, compared with 42 million in the United States. But higher levels of mestizaje, or racial mixing, have led to national myths of racial democracy that cover up histories of segregation, inequality and discrimination. This seeps into every part of society, including ballroom. Black participants across Latin America say that racism, colorism, hypersexualization of Black bodies and the valuation of Eurocentric beauty standards persist.\", \"In Colombia, which has the second-largest Afro-descendant population in South America after Brazil, Papu said he felt the racial component essential to ballroom was being left out of the scene. For him, realizing he couldn\\u2019t escape racism even in his home country was heartbreaking.\", \"\\u201cOK, now I\\u2019m in reality,\\u201d he said he remembered thinking. \\u201cNow I\\u2019m grown. Now I understand.\\u201d\", \"But many on the Colombian scene see Papu as an intruder, barging into an unfamiliar culture and telling people how things should be done without first getting to know them or acknowledging what they have already built.\", \"Mauricio Godoy, 27, known as Pantera, an Afro-Colombian, nonbinary member of the House of Yeguazas, said in an interview that while there were \\u201cmicro racisms\\u201d in the scene like being told \\u201cyou\\u2019re cute for a Black guy,\\u201d Colombian ballroom remains a space under construction.\", \"\\u201cI cannot demand that a newborn baby walk for me because it is not going to happen,\\u201d Pantera said. \\u201cWhat we need is patience. A house is not built with shouting and bragging, a house is built with practice, putting down one brick at a time.\\u201d\", \"For others, like Scarlett Mizrahi, 19, the founding mother of Colombia\\u2019s House of Cataleya, the scene\\u2019s newness is no excuse. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like \\u2018Yeah I\\u2019m still reading the Satanic Bible but I\\u2019ve only been coming to the Christian church for about a month,\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s illogical.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere can\\u2019t be the slightest drop of racism inside ballroom,\\u201d added Mizrahi, whose house has become known as an Afro-house, though she is white.\", \"What Papu calls \\u201crebellious\\u201d in the Latin American scenes also stems from a historically aggrieved relationship with the United States, and a reluctance to feel colonized. Vemanei pointed out the original categories from American ballroom do not always translate, given the distinctive relationship every country has with colonization, oppression and queer rights: \\u201cThey\\u2019re responding to a very unique set of dynamics that do not always match what Black queer Americans had to fight against.\\u201d\", \"And while Latin American ballroom may have a long way to go on conversations surrounding white privilege and race, it has become a more welcoming space for nonbinary people than the American scene.\", \"Jose Toledo, 28, the founding mother of House of Cobras in Colombia, spent time in New York City learning from the ballroom scene. Back in Colombia, when Toledo, who uses the pronouns she/her, started to come into her identity as a nonbinary trans woman and founded her own house, she realized that certain structures of the New York scene didn\\u2019t apply.\", \"Toledo wears makeup, skirts and long nails, but she keeps her hair cropped short and feels no need to medically transition. If she walked as a trans woman in a New York ball, she said, she would get shade with comments like, \\u201cYou don\\u2019t look like a woman: Where is your hair? Where are your boobs?\\u201d\", \"Queer people face enormous risks of violence and discrimination across Latin America. Ballroom provides family, community and a space of liberation to celebrate the nuances of their identity. Colombia is a largely Catholic and socially conservative country, and even in relatively progressive Bogot\\u00e1, which elected a lesbian mayor in 2019, anecdotes of verbal and physical aggression are commonplace.\", \"Many Bogot\\u00e1 ballroom participants see gender as fluid, and transitioning as a process without a fixed destination. Facial hair, body hair, long hair, wigs, makeup, dresses, heels, nails and lingerie are all fair game for mixing and matching. Hormone therapy and surgery are not always widely accessible, or even desired.\", \"Original ballroom was generally divided into categories like femme queens for trans women and butch queens for gay men. But in Colombia, for the most part, categories are open to all. It feels \\u201caggressive\\u201d to separate people, Toledo said.\", \"This also presents a challenge to traditional categories like \\u201crealness,\\u201d in which participants compete in how well they pass as straight if they\\u2019re gay or as cisgender if they are transgender. Realness celebrates and rewards the passing that gay people have had to do. And while some have questioned the continued relevance of realness in New York, it remains an essential part of ballroom.\", \"In Latin America, many resent being judged on how well they conform to traditional beauty standards they may not even be trying to achieve.\", \"Here, too, Papu has ruffled feathers by criticizing modifications to the original structures. When he started, he said, walking realness made him feel comfortable and confident in his body. And seeing a majority white-mestizo ballroom scene in Colombia alter that culture, doing away with categories and realness, seemed disrespectful to him \\u2014 he called it a kind of \\u201cwhite thinking.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIf I want to change it, I can,\\u201d he said of some white-mestizo members\\u2019 attitudes toward ballroom. \\u201cAnd if I want to do this, I can. And so I can take whatever is yours and make it mine.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe all have our space, and I feel like that\\u2019s the space for people like me,\\u201d Papu said. If they take realness out, he asked, \\u201cWhere do we go?\\u201d\", \"Vemanei said that some of these trade-offs are inevitable. \\u201cWe want everyone to feel free, but how do you define everyone?\\u201d\", \"In October, shortly after the ball Papu threw in Medell\\u00edn, which was poorly attended, he sent out a note to the ballroom community on social media asking for unity.\", \"\\u201cWhen a mistake is made, you apologize,\\u201d he wrote, although he didn\\u2019t specify for what. He has stopped hosting the practices in the park, ceding control to others. And he feels positive, he said, that the scene is growing.\", \"\\u201cBallroom,\\u201d he wrote, \\u201cis a big house where all of us are not always going to agree but we can lift each other up and take care of each other.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b63ba1764e0011ecb0e9ab886255e1c0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b63ba1764e0011ecb0e9ab886255e1c0"}},
