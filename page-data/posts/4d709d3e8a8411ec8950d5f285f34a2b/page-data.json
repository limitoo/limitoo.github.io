Kathy Hochul over mask mandates.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-02-10T07:19:06.000Z","content":"[\"Bruce Blakeman, who has emerged as the leader of suburban Long Island\\u2019s revolt against mask mandates, has lost his fair share of elections.\", \"In 1998, Mr. Blakeman \\u2014 a lifelong Republican \\u2014 was trounced in a statewide election for comptroller. A year later, he was stunned to be voted out of the Nassau County Legislature, losing his perch as its presiding officer and majority leader. After toying with a run for New York City mayor in 2009, he then lost a congressional race to Representative Kathleen Rice of Long Island in 2014.\", \"But Mr. Blakeman\\u2019s surprising November win in the race for Nassau County executive \\u2014 upsetting Laura Curran, a moderate, first-term Democrat \\u2014 has led, after so many races, to his informal anointment as the state party\\u2019s unlikeliest new star.\", \"Helping to fuel his rise has been Mr. Blakeman\\u2019s seemingly single-minded political mission to challenge and defy Gov. Kathy Hochul, the state\\u2019s top Democrat, over her mask mandates, as well as rising crime rates and bail reform, which have proved potent issues for Republicans.\", \"\\u201cBruce Blakeman is on the scene; he\\u2019s a major Republican leader in this state,\\u201d said Nick Langworthy, New York\\u2019s Republican Party chairman. \\u201cEverybody counted him out, but now Bruce has a great platform. And what I admire about him is he really wants to use it.\\u201d\", \"On Wednesday, Ms. Hochul announced that she would end some rules on indoor masking. Infection rates and hospitalizations have rapidly declined as the Omicron variant of the coronavirus has waned. She added that counties and individual businesses could still require masks, framing that decision as empowering for local leaders.\", \"Extending that sort of restriction seems unlikely in Nassau, at least as far as the county government is concerned. Shortly after being inaugurated in early January, Mr. Blakeman made headlines by issuing a flurry of executive orders directing county agencies to stop enforcing mask mandates, and proclaiming that local school districts had to vote on whether or not to grant children what he called \\u201cthe constitutional right\\u201d to cast off masks in the classroom.\", \"Whether those orders are legal or not \\u2014 and Ms. Hochul says they clearly weren\\u2019t, considering that state orders outweigh local dictums \\u2014 the defiant stance resulted in Mr. Blakeman\\u2019s ascension to the role of sought-after rabble-rouser, complete with repeated appearances on Fox News and a hero\\u2019s welcome in Republican circles in Albany.\", \"All of which, Mr. Blakeman insists, stems from a genuine concern for parental rights, not political gain.\", \"\\u201cI think good government is good politics,\\u201d Mr. Blakeman said in a recent interview in the State Capitol. \\u201cAnd part of good government is listening to your constituents.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Blakeman\\u2019s opponents counter that such platitudes are a mere disguise for an ambitious and oft-thwarted politician who has found his moment amid the polarization of the Trump era.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s following the tried-and-true Republican playbook,\\u201d said Jay Jacobs, who serves as both the Nassau County Democratic Party chair, as well as state chairman for the party. \\u201cYou either scare the voters or make them angry.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Blakeman\\u2019s sudden celebrity has already paid dividends in one way: Less than a week after he announced his executive orders, his party selected Nassau County as the host for its 2022 convention later this month, noting the \\u201chistoric Republican resurgence\\u201d in the county.\", \"Mr. Blakeman\\u2019s victory was part of a wave of Republican wins in Nassau, including by Anne Donnelly in the race for Nassau County district attorney, the first time that a Republican has held that position since 2005.\", \"White-maned, blue-eyed and fond of snazzy three-piece suits, Mr. Blakeman, 66, exudes a kind of old-school New York political swagger, complete with providing Page Six fodder, in part because his ex-wife, Nancy Shevell, is married to Paul McCartney.\", \"Politics is a bit of a Blakeman family business: Mr. Blakeman\\u2019s father, Robert, was a state assemblyman, and his younger brother, Bradley, was on President George W. Bush\\u2019s White House staff. One of five siblings who grew up in Valley Stream, on the Queens border, Mr. Blakeman recalls using Halloween as a campaign outing for his father.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019d go out with an empty bag and a full bag of literature,\\u201d Mr. Blakeman said. \\u201cI came back home with a full bag of candy and an empty bag of literature.\\u201d\", \"After college and law school stints in Arizona and California \\u2014 working for Republican campaigns and as a driver and aide to the former first lady Nancy Reagan \\u2014 Mr. Blakeman returned to Long Island to serve as a partner in his father\\u2019s firm before being appointed Hempstead town councilman in 1993. He won a full term on the council later that same year, before being elected to the County Legislature in 1995.\", \"Last winter, he had come full circle, once again serving as a member of the Hempstead Town council, when the Nassau County Republican chairman, Joseph G. Cairo Jr., approached him about taking on Ms. Curran.\", \"He was ambivalent, he said, because he was in \\u201ca very comfortable place in my life\\u201d and \\u201cwasn\\u2019t sure I wanted to go into that kind of a battle.\\u201d\", \"But, Mr. Blakeman said, he saw an opening as he looked at polling, saying that while Ms. Curran was popular, \\u201cshe was upside-down on every important issue,\\u201d including bail reform. A 2019 law passed by Democrats in Albany had effectively abolished bail for many nonviolent felonies and most misdemeanors.\", \"To that end, Mr. Blakeman ran a law-and-order and anti-tax campaign. He seemingly galvanized concerned suburbanites and die-hard Trump conservatives into a winning coalition, despite Democrats outnumbering Republicans by about 25,000 in the county, with a tranche of some 200,000 independent voters.\", \"The margin was thin, with Mr. Blakeman beating Ms. Curran by less than 1 percent, or about 2,100 votes.\", \"Mr. Cairo said that Mr. Blakeman\\u2019s opponents \\u201ctried to portray him as being a loser, and that he\\u2019s only doing this because he\\u2019s Cairo\\u2019s friend.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Blakeman proved to a dogged campaigner, however, impressing even some Democrats.\", \"\\u201cI would see him along the way and he\\u2019d say, \\u2018Tom, we\\u2019re going to win this.\\u2019 And I would say, \\u2018Really?\\u2019\\u201d said Thomas DiNapoli, the state\\u2019s comptroller, a Democrat, and a figure in Nassau County politics for more than three decades. \\u201cBut he believed in himself.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Blakeman also won, said Lawrence Levy, the dean of suburban studies at Hofstra University, because he \\u201cleveraged concerns over bail reform and property tax assessments in ways that appealed both to his base and the sort of moderate independent who abandoned Trump in 2020.\\u201d\", \"That combination, however, will prove to be difficult to maintain, Mr. Levy said.\", \"\\u201cHe is trying to thread a political and ideological needle,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHe is getting a lot of attention for taking very conservative populist positions with Trump-style rhetoric, ostensibly to deliver on promises he made to his base. But he\\u2019s also trying not to entirely alienate the sort of suburban swing voter that decides national and local elections.\\u201d\", \"Still, Mr. Blakeman\\u2019s victory gave particular hope to Republicans on Long Island, where liberals had celebrated in 2018, after an anti-Trump sentiment led to four State Senate seats flipping to Democrats on the island. The party then took control of the chamber for the first time in nearly a decade.\", \"And while new redistricting maps may dash any Republican dreams of seizing the State Senate \\u2014 the Democrats hold a 23-seat advantage in a 63-seat chamber \\u2014 Robert Ortt, the Republican minority leader, said Mr. Blakeman showed the potential potency of \\u201cbail reform and crime and public safety\\u201d in elections all across the state.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a template from the standpoint that it\\u2019s a huge issue,\\u201d Mr. Ortt said, adding that \\u201cpublic safety is an issue we all campaign on.\\u201d\", \"Even before taking office, Mr. Blakeman was invited to Albany in mid-December to headline an anti-bail-reform rally in the State Capitol and once again took an opportunity to criticize Ms. Hochul as someone \\u201cwho likes to lecture me on the law.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhen you look at this bail reform law it is nothing more than a get-out-of-jail-free card,\\u201d he said, citing examples of gun charges in his county related to defendants released without bail. \\u201cIt\\u2019s madness, it\\u2019s crazy and enough is enough.\\u201d\", \"In a county in which President Biden won, of course, Mr. Blakeman may well have to walk a fine line between appealing to moderates and the Republican base. Asked about President Donald J. Trump, he said he was \\u201ca very effective president,\\u201d but added: \\u201cOur personalities and delivery style are very different.\\u201d\", \"His ascension in Republican ranks has fostered some chatter that perhaps Mr. Blakeman \\u2014 who lives in the well-to-do enclave of Atlantic Beach with his wife, Segal Blakeman, a lawyer \\u2014 might want to challenge Ms. Hochul at some point.\", \"But Mr. Blakeman denies this, saying he supports this year\\u2019s front-runner for the Republican nomination, Representative Lee Zeldin, and is happy staying put in Nassau.\", \"\\u201cI have zero plans,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThis is a great job, I love it. And I get to stay home.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4d709d3e8a8411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4d709d3e8a8411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
