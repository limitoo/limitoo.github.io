In recent years, it has begun to catch on with mainstream audiences, too, fueled in part by the coronavirus pandemic.\", \"The site is particularly popular with young adults, teenagers and almost-teenagers. Here are five ways those young people are using Discord:\", \"Because Naima Mortley, a 12-year-old in Bethesda, Md., goes to an online school, Discord is her main way of interacting with classmates.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re not talking in the hallways or forming friend groups \\u2014 everyone is sharing emotes,\\u201d she said, referring to Discord\\u2019s custom emojis.\", \"When she talks with her classmates and friends on Discord, \\u201cwe\\u2019ll use it for homework help, or letting them know a teacher is in a meeting or if we just want to play video games together,\\u201d Naima said.\", \"Asa Mele, a 12-year-old who lives outside Boston, said he used Discord to talk with other Formula 1 racing fans and to interact with his friends and middle school classmates. Discord, he said, has largely replaced text messaging for him. He might send five texts each day, but several hundred messages on Discord.\", \"\\u201cInstagram, Snapchat, TikTok \\u2014 I don\\u2019t use any of those,\\u201d Asa said.\", \"In a server for his classmates, students can get updates on assignments they may have missed, and collaborate on homework problems in a voice channel, which is essentially a group phone call.\", \"Though Discord prohibits users under 13, Asa said \\u201cnobody follows that rule,\\u201d and he knows children as young as 8 on Discord.\", \"In Gjovik, Norway, 19-year-old Henning Strandaa uses Discord to chat with other fans of his favorite Twitch streamers, like the chess grandmaster Hikaru Nakamura.\", \"As a gamer, he was attracted to the platform because it was easier to use than Skype. But during the pandemic, he said, he started using it to connect with his high school friends. He now chats with people at his university.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not really like any social platform where you post or have a feed, like Instagram,\\u201d Mr. Strandaa said. \\u201cIt is kind of like a space for talking.\\u201d\", \"On New Year\\u2019s Eve, he said, he plans to travel to Finland to meet a friend he made on Discord.\", \"In Nicaragua, Brandon Ha, a 16-year-old who has developed an anime game on Roblox, the gaming site popular with children, runs a Discord server with over 100,000 fans of his game. He\\u2019s a big fan of the platform, and uses it to chat with the people who play his game, much like how a celebrity might occasionally interact with fans on Twitter or Instagram.\", \"Discord, he said, got off to a bad start \\u2014 at least in terms of perception \\u2014 with headlines about child predators and white nationalists flocking to it. Because of that perception, though, and because of a belief among many people his age that Discord is mostly for nerdy gamers, Brandon said he and his friends at school were not open about their use of the platform. \\u201cIt\\u2019s something that\\u2019s embarrassing for us,\\u201d he said.\", \"A common insult to frequent Discord users, or to moderators who spend hours on online communities, Brandon said, is that they need to \\u201cgo out, exercise, touch grass.\\u201d But one sign of its growing popularity: Some of his friends who are girls are now using Discord, he said.\", \"Kyleigh Jacobs, a 23-year-old San Diego resident, uses Discord to call with her friends during their weekly musical album discussion group, and to play the role-playing game Dungeons & Dragons.\", \"Ms. Jacobs, who works at a medical devices company, had never used Discord before the pandemic and does not play video games. But she got on the platform on the advice of her friends.\", \"\\u201cI mostly just use this for a really specific purpose, for talking to friends or playing games,\\u201d she said.\"]","href_hash":"88c105bc688111eca1f73fc6d123110f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"88c105bc688111eca1f73fc6d123110f"}},
