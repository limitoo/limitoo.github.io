They include Ukrainian students, business travelers and tourists.\", \"Amid pressure from advocates, Biden administration officials at the White House and the Department of Homeland Security have been considering offering TPS or Deferred Enforced Departure (DED), a similar deportation relief policy, to Ukrainians in the U.S., CBS News reported last week.\", \"A bipartisan group of lawmakers in the House of Representatives is also planning to send a letter to Mr. Biden urging his administration to grant TPS or DED to Ukrainians, according to Democratic Illinois Congressman Mike Quigley.\", \"\\\"In this time of crisis, we must reaffirm our commitment to America's most sacred values and ensure Ukrainian nationals are provided a safe haven,\\\" reads a draft of the letter obtained by CBS News.\", \"Earlier on Monday, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said there were no updates regarding a potential TPS designation for Ukraine, reiterating that the decision to approve such a program involves an inter-agency process. \\u00a0\", \"In addition to shielding them from deportation, TPS or DED would also allow eligible Ukrainians already in the U.S. to apply for temporary work permits. Both policies have eligibility requirements, and do not apply to people convicted of certain crimes.\", \"The deportation relief programs, if granted, would also exclude new arrivals from Ukraine, which has already seen more than 520,000 of its citizens flee to neighboring Poland, Moldova, Romania and Slovakia, according to figures from the United Nations refugee agency.\", \"Filippo Grandi, the United Nations high commissioner for refugees, said Monday that up to 4 million people could flee the conflict in Ukraine in the coming weeks in what threatens to become the largest European refugee crisis since the Balkans war.\", \"While it has voiced support for resettling Ukrainian refugees, the Biden administration has said the vast majority of people displaced from Ukraine will likely settle in other European countries.\\u00a0\", \"Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.
