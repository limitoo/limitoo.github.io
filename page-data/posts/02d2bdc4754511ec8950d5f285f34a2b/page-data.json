In no time, Giglio residents hosted thousands of journalists, law enforcement officers and rescue experts who descended on the port. In the months to come, salvage teams set up camp in the picturesque harbor to work on safely removing the ship, an operation that took more than two years to complete.\", \"The people of Giglio felt like a family for those who spent long days at its port, waiting to receive word of their loved ones whose bodies remained trapped on the ship. On Thursday, 10 years to the day of the tragedy, the victims\\u2019 families, some passengers and Italian authorities attended a remembrance Mass and threw a crown of flowers onto the waters where the Costa Concordia had rested. At 9:45 p.m., the time when the ship ran aground, a candlelit procession illuminated the port\\u2019s quay while church bells rang and ship sirens blared.\", \"What stands out now for many is how the wreck forever changed the lives of some of those whose paths crossed as a result. Friendships were made, business relations took shape and new families were even formed.\", \"\\u201cIt feels as if, since that tragic night, the lives of all the people involved were forever connected by an invisible thread,\\u201d Luana Gervasi, the niece of one of the shipwreck victims, said at the Mass on Thursday, her voice breaking.\", \"Francesco Dietrich, 48, from the eastern city of Ancona, arrived on the island in February 2013 to work with the wreck divers, \\u201ca dream job,\\u201d he said, adding: \\u201cIt was like offering someone who plays soccer for the parish team to join the Champions League with all the top teams in the business.\\u201d\", \"For his work, Mr. Dietrich had to buy a lot of boat-repair supplies from the only hardware store in town. It was owned by a local family, and Mr. Dietrich now has a 6-year-old son, Pietro, with the family\\u2019s daughter.\", \"\\u201cIt was such a shock for us,\\u201d said Bruna Danei, 42, who until 2018 worked as a secretary for the consortium that salvaged the wreck. \\u201cThe work on the Costa Concordia was a life-changing experience for me in many ways.\\u201d\", \"A rendering of the Costa Concordia used by salvage teams to plan its recovery hung on the wall of the living room where her 22-month-old daughter, Arianna, played.\", \"\\u201cShe wouldn\\u2019t be here if Davide hadn\\u2019t come to work on the site,\\u201d Ms. Danei said, referring to Davide Cedioli, 52, an experienced diver from Turin who came to the island in May 2012 to help right the Costa Concordia \\u2014 and who is also Arianna\\u2019s father.\", \"From a barge, Mr. Cedioli monitored the unprecedented salvage operation that, in less than a day, was able to rotate the 951-foot vessel, partly smashed against the rocks, from the sea bottom to an upright position without further endangering the underwater ecosystem that it damaged when it ran aground.\", \"\\u201cWe jumped up and down in happiness when the parbuckling was completed,\\u201d Mr. Cedioli remembered. \\u201cWe felt we were bringing some justice to this story. And I loved this small community and living on the island.\\u201d\", \"The local council voted to make Jan. 13 a day of remembrance on Giglio, but after this year it will stop the public commemorations and \\u201cmake it a more intimate moment, without the media,\\u201d Mr. Ortelli said during the mass.\", \"\\u201cBeing here ten years later brings back a lot of emotions,\\u201d said Kevin Rebello, 47, whose older brother, Russell, was a waiter on the Costa Concordia.\", \"Russell Rebello\\u2019s remains were finally retrieved three years after the shipwreck, from under the furniture in a cabin, once the vessel was upright and being taken apart in Genoa.\", \"\\u201cFirst, I feel close to my brother here,\\u201d Kevin Rebello said. \\u201cBut it is also some sort of family reunion for me \\u2014 I couldn\\u2019t wait to see the Giglio people.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Rebello hugged and greeted residents on the streets of the port area, and recalled how the people there had shown affection for him at the time, buying him coffee and simply showing respect for his grief.\", \"\\u201cOther victims\\u2019 families feel differently, but I am a Catholic and I have forgiven,\\u201d Mr. Rebello explained.\", \"The Costa Concordia accident caused national shame when it became clear that the liner\\u2019s commander, Francesco Schettino, failed to immediately sound the general alarm and coordinate the evacuation, and instead abandoned the sinking vessel.\", \"\\u201cGet back on board!\\u201d a Coast Guard officer shouted at Mr. Schettino when he understood that the captain was in a lifeboat watching people scramble to escape, audio recordings of their exchange later revealed. \\u201cGo up on the bow of the ship on a rope ladder, and tell me what you can do, how many people are there and what they need. Now!\\u201d\", \"The officer has since pursued a successful career in politics, while Mr. Schettino is serving a 16-year sentence in a Roman prison for homicide and for abandoning the ship before the evacuation was completed. Other officials and crew members plea-bargained for lesser sentences.\", \"During the trial, Mr. Schettino admitted that he had committed an \\u201cimprudence\\u201d when he decided to sail near the island of Giglio at high speed to greet the family of the ship\\u2019s headwaiter. The impact with the half-submerged rock near the island produced a gash in the hull more than 70 meters long, or about 76 yards, leading to blackouts on board and water pouring into the lower decks.\", \"Mr. Schettino tried to steer the cruiser toward the port to make evacuation easier, but the vessel was out of control and began to tip as it neared the harbor, making many lifeboats useless.\", \"\\u201cI can\\u2019t forget the eyes of children, scared to death, and of their parents,\\u201d said Mr. Pellegrini, who had boarded the ship to speak with officials and organize the evacuation. \\u201cThe metallic sound of the enormous ship tipping over and the gurgling of the sea up the endless corridors of the cruiser.\\u201d\", \"Sergio Ortelli, who is still the mayor of Giglio ten years later, was similarly moved. \\u201cNobody can go back and cancel those senseless deaths of innocent people, or the grief of their families,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe tragedy will always stay with us as a community. It was an apocalypse for us.\\u201d\", \"Yet Mr. Ortelli said that the accident also told a different story, that of the skilled rescuers who managed to save thousands of lives, and of the engineers who righted the liner, refloated it and took it to the scrapyard.\", \"While the global attention shifted away from Giglio, residents have stayed in touch with the outside world through the people who temporarily lived there.\", \"For months, the Rev. Lorenzo Pasquotti, who was then a pastor in Giglio, kept receiving packages: dry-cleaned slippers, sweaters and tablecloths that were given to the cold, stranded passengers in his church that night, returned via courier.\", \"One summer, Father Pasquotti ate German cookies with a German couple who were passengers on the ship. They still remembered the hot tea and leftovers from Christmas delicacies that they were given that night.\", \"\\u201cSo many nationalities \\u2014 the world was at our door all of a sudden,\\u201d he said, remembering that night. \\u201cAnd we naturally opened it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"02d2bdc4754511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"02d2bdc4754511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
