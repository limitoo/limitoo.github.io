The Navy fuel tanks sits 100 feet above an aquifer that, according to the Water Supply Board, supplies water between 400,000 and 450,000 residents and visitors in Honolulu.\\u00a0\", \"The military has mobilized troops to distribute water that's safe so mothers like Jamie Simic can bathe their children. \\\"How long have I been poisoning myself and my kids,\\\" Simic said through tears.\\u00a0\", \"Families have expressed their anger to military officials at recent town hall meetings.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"When we could smell the fuel in the water I was told we cannot get told anything.

Go away.'\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Military officials have tried to reassure residents, but for many the reassurance came too late.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I understand your frustrations and concerns and I share them.
