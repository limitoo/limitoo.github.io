The live annual extravaganza \\u2014 which, because of the pandemic, was produced last year for television only \\u2014 involves 300 pounds of glitter, 200 pounds of confetti, 240 gallons of paint and 15 giant helium balloons. This year the parade, which starts along Central Park West in Manhattan and ends in front of the Macy\\u2019s flagship at Herald Square, will welcome back the crowds. \\u201cI have to say, the excitement of where we are in the season and how it\\u2019s coming together is something that I\\u2019m actually really appreciating,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Coss, 41, came to Macy\\u2019s from a career in production at Nickelodeon, Vice and MTV. He lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with his wife, Mary Coss, who owns an event production company, and their daughter, Mila Rose, 3.\", \"PART ONE For a while now and until the parade, Sundays have been a two-part day. We\\u2019ve been using the first half as daddy-daughter time. I wake up at around 6:30, brush my teeth and do a bit of stretching before I pop into Mila Rose\\u2019s room to get her up and get her excited for the day.\", \"BAGEL FIX We head out early for our bagel Sunday at Broadway Bagel. Mila Rose does an egg bagel with cream cheese. Being the native New Yorker that I am, I get bacon, egg and cheese on an everything. It used to be a roll. Growing up, the roll was the classic New York sandwich. But these days, I can appreciate a bagel in the morning. The everything gives it a little extra flavor.\", \"OFF TO THE RACES The past year or so, I\\u2019ve been into Formula 1 racing. At the start of the pandemic, my wife and I got into a Netflix show called \\u201cDrive to Survive.\\u201d That really deconstructed the process for me and helped me to understand what\\u2019s going on on the track. I got hooked. Now Mila Rose is getting into it, too. If there\\u2019s a race on, we\\u2019ll go home and watch the race. If there\\u2019s no race on, we\\u2019ll head over to the playground at Central Park and do an hour or so of swinging and slides. Then we\\u2019ll look at ducks and birds and have a little walk. My weekdays have been long, so I really value the dedicated time with my little girl. She\\u2019s my life.\", \"SALSA IN SANTA\\u2019S WORKSHOP The second part of the day is parade prep. Now that the schedule is picking up, it\\u2019s all hands on deck. Sometimes I\\u2019ll drive out to the studio in Moonachie, N.J., and spend some quiet time in my office. Most days I\\u2019m having a lot of meetings and conversations. On Sundays, I can reflect and plan the week ahead. I might put some music on, either a jazz playlist or some salsa \\u2014 I\\u2019m Puerto Rican and from the Bronx \\u2014 or not. Before I leave, I like to take a walk around the studio and take it all in. It\\u2019s sort of like Santa\\u2019s workshop. You realize all you see on the streets of New York at the parade comes from this facility, and it feels magical. As a kid from the Bronx who always wanted to create things, I feel really fortunate to be here.\", \"TINA, BARRY If I can, I try to get back home in time for dinner with the family. Dinner is a floating plan. Sometimes we\\u2019ll go out or sometimes we\\u2019ll prepare something or my mother-in-law will come over and she\\u2019ll prepare something. After dinner, we\\u2019ll sort of pivot into traditional bedtime stuff. But my daughter likes one or two songs before we transition. She\\u2019s a big \\u201cProud Mary\\u201d fan. There\\u2019s a specific live Tina Turner performance she\\u2019s watched many times, and she knows the dance, the whole routine. She\\u2019ll grab her mike and get into it. She also listens to Barry Manilow. I don\\u2019t know how she got into him, but it\\u2019s just what she\\u2019s drawn to. She likes \\u201cI Can\\u2019t Smile Without You\\u201d and \\u201cSomewhere Down the Road.\\u201d I try to stay away from \\u201cCopacabana\\u201d at bedtime.\", \"TV DATE From 8 on, I get a little quality time with my wife. That\\u2019s our opportunity to catch up on the day and talk about the week ahead and watch some television. Right now we\\u2019re not fully through with \\u201cOnly Murders in the Building\\u201d on Hulu. It\\u2019s got Steve Martin and Martin Short, and those two together are quite dynamic and engaging. It\\u2019s also a New York-centric show, so you see a lot of familiar neighborhoods and places. At 10 or 11, we\\u2019re headed toward bedtime. I try not to overthink the week ahead before I go to sleep. The last thing I do is kiss my wife good night.\"]","href_hash":"8d625e5f492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8d625e5f492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}},
