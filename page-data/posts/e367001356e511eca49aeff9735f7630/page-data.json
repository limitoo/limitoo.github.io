She explained that the police had to kick down the apartment door because someone changed the locks.\", \"Once the police were able to enter the apartment, they found the strangers still inside. Footage showed them being escorted through the parking lot by one officer.\", \"The video then cut to clips of the empty living room with full trash bags in the corner. In the bedroom, the people had set up a twin mattress on the floor and even left snacks and a frozen drink on the nightstand.\", \"\\\"They had a gun and a knife the police found,\\\" Rice said in the video.\", \"She also showed a knife with the handle wrapped in a washcloth that was left on the kitchen counter and pictures that were drawn on that she had left in the apartment.\", \"\\\"They went into our storage and put up Christmas decor,\\\" Rice mentioned.\", \"She showed that the strangers had put up some of her Christmas decorations including a small silver tree. She also mentioned that they stole the dryer.\", \"In a follow-up video, Rice explained that she has more than one apartment. She also said she noticed something strange about two weeks prior when she noticed the storage unit on the balcony was open.\", \"She said that about a week later her son's father checked the apartment again and noticed tape on the deadbolt of the door and the two decided to wait until the next day to contact the police. When they came back the next day, they noticed that the tape was replaced with a brand new deadbolt.\", \"In another video, Rice said police found a man and woman inside the apartment and that she had never seen either of them before. She also said the majority of the stuff in her closet was gone as well as her son's toy kitchen. She also said her TVs and electronics were gone.\", \"In the comments, many mentioned that this is a prime example of why people should invest in renter's insurance. They also mentioned how scary it was that the two people seemed prepared for Rice to come home with the knife casually left on the kitchen counter.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946313/christmas-decoration.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A woman went viral on TikTok after she showed footage of her empty apartment after two strangers broke in and began living inside.

Payne died inside her home in 2018, but her body was never discovered because she had no close family or friends to check in on her.\", \"Eventually, police believed a group of squatters noticed the vacant home and decided to move in.\", \"\\\"After finding her, the decision was made between several people that they were going to dismember her body and bury her,\\\" said Metro Homicide Lieutenant Ray Spencer. \\\"And then basically drain her finances and sell off her belongings, fraudulently.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"e367001356e511eca49aeff9735f7630"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e367001356e511eca49aeff9735f7630"}},
