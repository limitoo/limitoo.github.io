I assumed that Stephen Sondheim\\u2019s latest musical was sold out, but I decided to take a chance and see if I could get a ticket to the matinee.\", \"Amazingly, there was a great one available \\u2014 fourth row center. I was unshaven, in jeans and a T-shirt, carrying a stuffed backpack. I didn\\u2019t care. Elated, I took my seat.\", \"Then who walks in and sits directly in front of me? John Lennon and Yoko Ono. Would I be distracted by their presence?\", \"Not a bit. Even two cultural gods faded before the engulfing beginning of \\u201cSweeney.\\u201d\", \"Sondheim, who died on Friday at 91, establishes the work\\u2019s dark, gothic mood in strange, chromatically wandering organ music right at the start. Then the deafening blast of a factory whistle breaks in, and the orchestra starts the prologue, a subdued, murmuring minor-mode riff over which the hushed chorus sings: \\u201cAttend the tale of Sweeney Todd.\\u201d\", \"I was immediately riveted by the grim, suspenseful drama of the music. Even in those opening moments, the musician in me wanted to know more. What were those harmonies, the chords that the rippling figure was tracing? What were those notes that seemed to escape from the orchestra and jab me with touches of dissonance? When the bass line that grounds the music took a sudden low plunge, it seemed, briefly, like the harmonic floor had opened a chasm. I had to get the score, to study the music, to see if I could figure out what was going on.\", \"Twenty-two years later, by then the chief classical music critic for The New York Times, I found myself seated at a piano, playing that opening music to \\u201cSweeney\\u201d in front of its composer and asking Sondheim questions about it. During that Times Talks event in 2001, I also played other extraordinary passages from the show \\u2014 like the moment early on when Sweeney, obliquely telling the young sailor Anthony the story of his tragic life, sings, in understated phrases, \\u201cThere was a barber and his wife,\\u201d over a slow accompaniment that echoes the prologue.\", \"Then, Sweeney adds, \\u201cAnd she was beautiful.\\u201d At that final word \\u2014 \\u201cbeautiful\\u201d \\u2014 the chord below, which repeats three times, is piercingly, hauntingly dissonant. A graduate seminar in music theory could devote considerable time to deciphering the elusive harmony. It has always struck me as a counterintuitive touch. Shouldn\\u2019t the wife\\u2019s beauty be conveyed through something more melting, more radiant?\", \"Yet, as we learn, it was this young woman\\u2019s beauty that made her the prey of the lecherous, powerful Judge Turpin. In our interview, Sondheim acknowledged that the moment had this subtext, yet denied that he had calibrated the effect; he said he had just followed his musical instincts.\", \"I also played excerpts from \\u201cMerrily We Roll Along,\\u201d never his most popular but perhaps my desert-island Sondheim musical, and one of his most appealing, ingeniously intricate and moving scores. All the songs are \\u201cinterconnected through chunks of melody, rhythm and accompaniment,\\u201d as he put it in the liner notes for the original cast recording.\", \"I tried to show the audience how those chunks break down and fit together. Sondheim mostly just smiled and listened, nodding and saying, basically, \\u201cYep, that\\u2019s it.\\u201d He never liked to discuss the inner workings of his music in front of the public. This was his business, he felt.\", \"He did offer detailed analyses of several of his works in a series of interviews in 1997 with Mark Eden Horowitz, a music specialist from the Library of Congress, later published as an essential book, \\u201cSondheim on Music.\\u201d\", \"If you want specifics, this is your source. Of a passage in \\u201cPassion,\\u201d Sondheim says that two chords \\u201crepresent the entire progression\\u201d of the sequence.\", \"\\u201cI write long-line stuff in either whole notes or half notes,\\u201d he added. \\u201cA whole note could represent four bars, eight bars, 12 bars, 16 bars,\\u201d but the \\u201cglue has to be harmonic\\u201d \\u2014 \\u201chas to be spinning out the triad and spinning out the harmony.\\u201d\", \"Between my first time seeing \\u201cSweeney\\u201d \\u2014 I went back twice! \\u2014 and getting to know him personally in the late 1990s, Sondheim was a singular presence in my life and work. When I taught music theory at Emerson College in Boston, I used Sondheim songs like \\u201cThe Miller\\u2019s Son\\u201d (from \\u201cA Little Night Music\\u201d) and \\u201cBarcelona\\u201d (from \\u201cCompany\\u201d) as illustrations of how he, while hewing to a tonal musical language, activated harmonies and folded elements of jazz and Impressionist styles in his own distinctive, exhilarating voice.\", \"In the early \\u201990s, at several memorial services for friends who had died of AIDS, I played \\u201cGood Thing Going,\\u201d a wistful song about recalling imperfect but cherished relationships. \\u201cMarry Me a Little,\\u201d cut from the original production of \\u201cCompany\\u201d but beloved in later revivals as the protagonist\\u2019s statement of determination and despair, was another piece I relished performing; I still use the demanding perpetual-motion piano part as an exercise to keep my finger technique limber.\", \"In 2010, I made an 80th birthday tribute video to him for the Times website, in which, among other excerpts, I played and analyzed the wondrous chords at the start of \\u201cSunday in the Park with George.\\u201d Here, the hero, Georges Seurat, speaking to the audience, explains the elements of painting, how the artist must bring \\u201corder to the whole\\u201d through design, composition, balance, light \\u2014 and, finally, harmony. Each word is accompanied, almost musically illustrated, by a variant of a five-note arpeggio figure that uncannily embodies each concept. The chord for light is so piercing and bright you almost want to squint.\", \"In 2016, I posed to Sondheim the question of why such a master composer so seldom wrote a purely instrumental work. Yes, he was one of the greatest lyricists in the history of musical theater. But wasn\\u2019t he tempted to put words aside now and then, and just compose, say, a piano sonata?\", \"He answered that it wasn\\u2019t really the words that generated his musical ideas. \\u201cI express the character,\\u201d he said. \\u201cLet\\u2019s see what happens to him. I express it musically.\\u201d He was endlessly fascinated by the \\u201cpuzzle of music,\\u201d he added. But when he gets solely into music, the \\u201cpuzzle takes over.\\u201d\", \"I\\u2019ve been thinking since his death about a trip to the Bronx Zoo my husband and I took in the spring of 2019 with Sondheim and his husband, Jeff Romley. They were passionate animal lovers, and my cousin Kathleen LaMattina works and lives there with her husband, Jim Breheny, the zoo\\u2019s director. In a special room, these honored guests could pet sloths and penguins, and even get close to a cheetah, under a staff member\\u2019s calm control. I have pictures of Sondheim feeding leafy tree branches to a giraffe.\", \"I\\u2019m looking as I write this at the piano-vocal score to \\u201cSweeney Todd\\u201d Sondheim signed for me the first time he came to dinner, in 1997.\", \"\\u201cTo Tony,\\u201d his inscription reads. \\u201cWith thanks for the enthusiasm.\\u201d\", \"That enthusiasm will never diminish, and the thanks will always go the other way.\"]","href_hash":"09efaad9508b11ec8ebb658b75bef5fc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"09efaad9508b11ec8ebb658b75bef5fc"}},
