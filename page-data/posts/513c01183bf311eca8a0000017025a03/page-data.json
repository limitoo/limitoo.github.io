Williams is no stranger to running for public advocate. His likely victory for a full four-year term on Tuesday comes after three elections for the seat in under three years following a 2019 special election victory.\", \"Re-election as public advocate would give him a stable base to pursue another office that he\\u2019s interested in: governor. Mr. Williams has formed an exploratory committee and has said he will make a decision in the next few weeks about whether he will run for that job.\", \"The race for governor has grown competitive recently. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who took office when former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo resigned, is running, and Letitia James, the New York State attorney general, announced her candidacy last week. Other possible candidates include the New York City mayor, Bill de Blasio, and Representative Thomas Suozzi from Long Island.\", \"Eyeing a run for governor while running for public advocate has left Mr. Williams open to criticism from his fellow candidates that he would not pay attention to the job of public advocate if re-elected. The public advocate serves as an ombudsman and is also next in the line of succession to the mayor.\", \"Dr. Devi Nampiaparampil, the Republican nominee, said New Yorkers deserved an advocate who is focused on dealing with issues specific to the city; he has claimed that Mr. Williams would be distracted if he runs for governor.\", \"Mr. Williams said that if he ran for governor, he would do so to address two of the most important issues facing the state \\u2014 criminal justice reform and affordable housing \\u2014 from his perspective as a progressive.\", \"After a surprise run for lieutenant governor in 2018 brought him closer to victory than many expected, Mr. Williams said that he was getting a warm reception during state listening tours.\"]","href_hash":"513c01183bf311eca8a0000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"513c01183bf311eca8a0000017025a03"}},
