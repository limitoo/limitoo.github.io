The clip, in which the pup appears to impersonate the bark of a smaller dog, has gone viral, generating over 680,000 views, 183,000 likes, and 2,100 comments.\", \"German Shepherds are known for their intelligence and trainability. As such, members of the breed are often used as service, guide, military, police, and drug- and bomb-detection dogs.\", \"In fact, German Shepherds are so smart that \\\"many can learn a new behavior in only a few repetitions.\\\" As the American Kennel Club noted, the breed also carries a \\\"legendary desire to cooperate and work with us, a trait many see as a wish to please their humans.\\\"\", \"In his video, Ty\\u2014who goes by @ty_anubis\\u2014introduces Anubis' newest command: \\\"Ankle Biter.\\\" He wrote in the caption: \\\"Guarantee NO OTHER DOG knows this trick.\\\"\", \"The clip begins with Anubis facing a window and barking. He has a distinctly low and slightly menacing bark, typical of a German shepherd.\", \"However, when Ty gives Anubis the \\\"Ankle Biter\\\" command, his entire demeanor changes. The dog shifts to a high-pitched yap, characteristic of small, \\\"ankle biter\\\" breeds like Chihuahuas.\", \"While many viewers were impressed by Anubis' abilities, several expressed doubt that the clip was real. \\\"All of you that thought this was real... please take a break from this app for the night,\\\" commented @heartlesskat.\", \"According to these commenters, the audio in the video was \\\"pitched up\\\" for Anubis' \\\"Ankle Bite\\\" command. \\\"If you listen to the fan in the background it changes also,\\\" noted @frassa_cas.\", \"In response, Ty posted a follow-up video offering further \\\"proof\\\" of Anubis' bark, though some remained unconvinced.\", \"\\\"Imagine breaking [into] a house, hearing the ankle biter bark and this comes down the stairs,\\\" wrote @jeremymenchaca.\", \"\\\"When your lease only permits one dog, and you have to explain that you do only have one dog,\\\" joked @adamcarlson7.\", \"\\\"The amount of sounds my German shepherd can make surprises me all the time,\\\" shared @that1bagel.\", \"Many more asked Ty to make a tutorial video explaining how he trained Anubis to perform the high-pitched bark.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947168/german-shepherd.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A German Shepherd named Anubis sparked an online conversation hearing the dog mimic the bark of a small dog.
