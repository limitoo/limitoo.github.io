Oklahoma City-based Hobby Lobby runs 956 stores in 47 states and employs more than 43,000 people.\\u00a0\", \"While the federal minimum has not budged from $7.25 an hour since 2009, a slew of retailers and fast-food chains have increased wages to $15 or more amid the\\u00a0pandemic\\u00a0and a shortage of workers. \\u00a0\", \"Frontline employees\\u00a0like grocery clerks and retail workers have seen wages grow at their fastest pace in years, but rising prices means those seemingly robust wage gains amount to \\\"pennies\\\" an hour once inflation is included, according to an analysis\\u00a0from the Brookings Institution.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The living wage is closer to $18 an hour,\\\" said Molly Kinder, a co-author of the new study on wages for frontline workers and a fellow at Brookings Metro.\\u00a0\", \"Hobby Lobby was ahead of the trend in raising its full-time minimum to $15 an hour in 2014, the retailer noted.
