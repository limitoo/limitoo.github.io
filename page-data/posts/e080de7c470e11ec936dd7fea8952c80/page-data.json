At the heart of the dispute is a provision in the contract that allows JPMorgan to tweak its details following any \\u201cextraordinary events\\u201d at Tesla.\", \"The bank is claiming that an Aug. 7, 2018, tweet \\u2014 in which Mr. Musk, Tesla\\u2019s chief executive, said he had \\u201cfunding secured\\u201d to take Telsa private at $420 a share \\u2014 fit the bill because it significantly lowered Tesla\\u2019s share price. Tesla\\u2019s leaders disagree.\", \"JPMorgan\\u2019s lawsuit says that Tesla sold JPMorgan stock warrants in 2014 \\u201cas part of a larger capital markets transaction.\\u201d According to the agreement, if Tesla\\u2019s stock was at or above a certain price on the day the options expired seven years later, it would have to pay JPMorgan a certain amount of money \\u2014 the difference between the actual share price on that date and the so-called \\u201cstrike price\\u201d that the two sides had set.\", \"The strike price was initially set at just over $560 a share. Then came Mr. Musk\\u2019s tweet about a deal to take Tesla private at $420 a share \\u2014 a significant premium over the company\\u2019s stock price the time. The tweet initially sent Tesla\\u2019s share prices soaring. But they sank when it quickly became clear that no such deal had been reached.\", \"Tesla executives scrambled to explain the tweet to shareholders and regulators. Mr. Musk and Tesla later paid $20 million each to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission case over the matter, and he agreed to step aside from his role as chairman for three years.\", \"Just after the crisis began, JPMorgan wanted to reset the strike price in its contract. Ten days after Mr. Musk\\u2019s tweet, the bank told Tesla it had reset the price to $424 a share. A week later the bank raised the price slightly, to $484.35 a share.\", \"Tesla did not respond to the changes until early 2019, when its lawyers wrote to JPMorgan claiming that the bank\\u2019s strike price adjustments had been \\u201cunreasonably swift and represented an opportunistic attempt to take advantage of changes in volatility in Tesla\\u2019s stock.\\u201d\", \"The two sides were still in a deadlock in 2020, when Tesla\\u2019s five-for-one stock split prompted JPMorgan to adjust the strike price a third time, lowering it to $96.87.\", \"Tesla never accepted any of these changes. Starting in June this year, Tesla paid JPMorgan only the \\u201cundisputed\\u201d portion of the two sides\\u2019 agreement. (Tesla shares traded for more than $600 for much of that month; the stock was worth $1,013.39 a share at Monday\\u2019s close.)\", \"\\u201cWe have provided Tesla multiple opportunities to fulfill its contractual obligations, so it is unfortunate that they have forced this issue into litigation,\\u201d a spokeswoman for the bank, Tasha Pelio, said in an email to The New York Times.\", \"Mr. Musk and Ryan McCarthy, an attorney for Tesla, did not respond to messages seeking comment on Tuesday.\"]","href_hash":"e080de7c470e11ec936dd7fea8952c80"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e080de7c470e11ec936dd7fea8952c80"}},
