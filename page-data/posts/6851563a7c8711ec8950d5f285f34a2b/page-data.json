What I'm hoping (is) that we will have a vaccine that you will have to do once a year,\\\" Bourla said.\", \"\\\"Once a year - it is easier to convince people to do it. It is easier for people to remember.\", \"\\\"So from a public health perspective, it is an ideal situation. We are looking to see if we can create a vaccine that covers Omicron and doesn't forget the other variants and that could be a solution,\\\" Bourla said.\", \"Bourla has said Pfizer could be ready to file for approval for a redesigned vaccine to fight Omicron, and mass produce it, as soon as March.\", \"Citing three studies, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Friday that a third dose of an mRNA vaccine is key to fighting Omicron, providing 90 percent protection against hospitalisation.\", \"A preliminary study published by Israel's Sheba Medical Center on Monday found that a fourth shot increases antibodies to even higher levels than the third but was likely not enough to fend off Omicron. Nonetheless, a second booster was still advised for risk groups, Sheba said.\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"6851563a7c8711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6851563a7c8711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
