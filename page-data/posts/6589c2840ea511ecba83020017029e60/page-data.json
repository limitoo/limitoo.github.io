Investigations of abuses by the security forces in Thailand rarely go far.\", \"Mr Thitisant's dramatic rise and fall tells us a lot about the Thai police force. \", \"The popular image most Thais have from their own experience, is of bumbling lower-ranked officers engaged in petty acts of extortion and self-enrichment. This belies the reality of an institution which has long had an essential role in the opaque power networks which run the country. \", \"That is why many ambitious young Thais see the police as a quick route to success and wealth.\", \"\\\"The police have long been central to Thailand's political power structure,\\\" says Paul Chambers at the Center of ASEAN Community Studies in Naresuan University.\", \"\\\"Because they have preserved it, armed and legitimised as a domestic enforcement agency for the palace, the army, and for powerful people. In return they are allowed to operate endless extortion rackets with impunity as a sort of legal mafia.

At some point Mr Thitisant also got involved in confiscating luxury cars, another lucrative operation. \", \"Thailand imposes taxes of more than 300% on supercars like Ferraris, Rolls-Royces and Lamborghinis, for which, in a country with plenty of billionaires, there is a large market. \", \"This has created a substantial business in tax avoidance, either by bribing customs officers to report a much lower value for the cars, or describing them as parts or partially-assembled. \", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15731/production/_120375878_gettyimages-615526078.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">2003 Ferrari Enzo</div>\", \"Some are stolen in other countries and smuggled in.
