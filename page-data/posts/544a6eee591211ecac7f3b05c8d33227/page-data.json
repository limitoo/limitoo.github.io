I second her negative take on holiday gift giving, be it among office staff, friends or family. I still remember those bottles of wine from one of my former bosses every holiday season. He had not noticed that I did not drink alcohol.\", \"I know I am not a good gift giver myself, especially to people I am not around a lot and I cannot know their specific tastes, needs, sizes, etc.\", \"Let\\u2019s face it: Ritualized gift giving is outdated in our 21st-century developed society. Many of us are fortunate to have everything we need and opportunities to buy much of what we want all year round.\", \"Holidays do not carry the meaning they did in preindustrial, poorer, more rural societies. We don\\u2019t look forward to the break from hard labor, or the change from basic food to rich feasts, because for most of us our lives are pretty good all year.\", \"Thus the gifts can be a burden as much as a joy, and certainly not an efficient allocation of resources. We would all be better off just exchanging greetings and giving to those less well off.\", \"Rebecca S. FahrlanderBellevue, Neb.The writer is a retired adjunct professor of psychology and sociology.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Deriding gift giving as materialistic has long been the refuge of the thoughtless or untrained gift giver. But it also betrays a lack of cultural awareness of the meaning and value of gifts, particularly on big gift-giving occasions like Christmas.\", \"For many families, including my own, Christmas gifts are, in their own way, financial management; big items that we would not buy for ourselves are consigned to one special time a year. Knowing what others \\u201cwant and need\\u201d is important in this context, but there are other contexts as well.\", \"Thinking of something for someone \\u2014 as small as a special book, for example \\u2014 or picking up something that reminds you of somebody is an act of love. Giving gifts to strangers \\u2014 when visiting the family of a fianc\\u00e9, for example \\u2014 is a way of forging connection and extending gratitude.\", \"I hope the author\\u2019s journey in this direction will continue to grow.\", \"Nicole KnoblochArlington, Mass.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cStates Must Not Bar Religious School Options,\\u201d by Michael Bindas and Walter Womack (Opinion guest essay, Dec. 8):\", \"By arguing that Maine should take the unprecedented step of making tuition assistance available to parents sending their children to private religious schools, the writers are essentially seeking to have the state\\u2019s taxpayers pay for religious indoctrination.\", \"There\\u2019s no doubt that religious schools play an important role in American education. But our nation was founded on the bedrock principle of separation of church and state.\", \"Out of respect for freedom of religion, we allow religious schools to discriminate in whom they employ as teachers, to teach religious doctrines and to promote a religious worldview. But requiring taxpayers to fund those religious views and teachings \\u2014 even those they find objectionable \\u2014 is antithetical to our constitutional freedoms.\", \"As we stated in our amicus brief at the Supreme Court, Maine\\u2019s tuition program is constitutional. Ruling against the state would be inconsistent with precedent and undermine the right of states to protect their taxpayers from coerced funding of distinctly religious activities. Simply put, this case should not be viewed as a case of discrimination against religion.\", \"Jonathan A. GreenblattNew YorkThe writer is chief executive and national director of the Anti-Defamation League.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cSupply Chain Issues Threaten New York Ritual: Bagel and a Schmear\\u201d (news article, Dec. 5):\", \"Although Midwest-raised, I had a New Yorker\\u2019s passion for the cream cheese schmear. But my parents, East Coast natives, and then a college roommate from New York, preferred their bagels toasted with butter. I finally tried it. So should everyone else. It was wonderful. You can actually taste the bagel!\", \"Joshua G. VincentChicago\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Is it heresy? I don\\u2019t know, but it\\u2019s delish! I spread mayonnaise on my bagel, not cream cheese, before adding lox, capers, fresh dill, a tomato slice and red onion. Try it. You\\u2019ll like it. You may never go back to that big glob of butterfat!\", \"Peter FeibelmanAlbuquerque\", \"To the Editor:\", \"I call on President Biden to release the Strategic Cream Cheese Reserve!\", \"Ron FreedmanToronto\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cEnd the Destructive Trump-Biden Tariffs,\\u201d by Binyamin Appelbaum (Opinion, Nov. 25):\", \"The International Trade Commission found that U.S. producers were \\u201cmaterially injured\\u201d by subsidized Chinese chassis. The I.T.C. duties gave domestic chassis manufacturers and their competitors in Canada, Mexico and elsewhere the ability to compete at fairly traded prices.\", \"More than a thousand Americans make chassis today because of the commission\\u2019s decision. Yes, some of these jobs start at $18 an hour, as you report, but many pay far more, with medical benefits, 401(k)s and other incentives. We are proud to be part of the effort to save American jobs and restore equity to this industry.\", \"Domestic chassis manufacturers believe in free trade, but free trade must also reflect fair trade. We welcome fairly traded foreign competition, but we believe that the United States is well advised to defend its businesses that suffer from unfair Chinese trade practices.\", \"Frank KatzSeattleThe writer is the chairman of Cheetah Chassis.\"]","href_hash":"544a6eee591211ecac7f3b05c8d33227"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"544a6eee591211ecac7f3b05c8d33227"}},
