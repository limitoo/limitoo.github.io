But the book is reportedly moving to a telling destination: the same specializing-in-the-deplorable publishing house that took on Woody Allen\\u2019s memoir and picked up Blake Bailey\\u2019s Philip Roth biography.\", \"If Mailer was really given a politically motivated push, it\\u2019s a sign that our would-be apparatchiks are getting lazy. To take aim at J.K. Rowling, Dave Chappelle or even Dr. Seuss shows real censorious ambition. But to cancel Mailer at this moment would be an act of superfluity, like canceling Booth Tarkington or James Whitcomb Riley \\u2014 a pointless kick to a fundamentally anachronistic character.\", \"I don\\u2019t mean that Mailer deserves permanent diminishment \\u2014 far from it. But his reputational decline is so overdetermined, his persona so intensely out of step with our own era \\u2014 the brawling macho solipsist who stabbed his own wife with a penknife \\u2014 as to make him a comically easy and therefore pointless target for cancellation.\", \"Who would be a more worthy and imposing target, you might ask, if I were handing out assignments to the censors? Well, why not one of Mailer\\u2019s still-beloved contemporaries, a woman whose literary cult made her recent passing a major media event?\", \"You want to impress me? You want to flex some cultural muscle? Let\\u2019s see you cancel Joan Didion.\", \"I\\u2019m even ready with the material you need. Maybe you\\u2019ve heard dire things about the right\\u2019s fixation on so-called cultural Marxism \\u2014 basically the idea that contemporary progressivism is just communism reborn, but with identity-based groups taking on the role of the proletariat. Well, here is an example of that dangerous reactionary idea, applied to feminism in particular:\", \"This is from Didion\\u2019s famous/infamous critique \\u201cThe Women\\u2019s Movement,\\u201d a version of which ran in this very newspaper in 1972.\", \"The essay is not a dogmatic attack on the Marxist ideas that it discerns in feminism; it offers its critique in the name of \\u201cthose of us who remain committed mainly to the exploration of moral distinctions and ambiguities.\\u201d But that critique is so extraordinarily harsh \\u2014 \\u201cthe astral discontent with actual lives, actual men, the denial of the real generative possibilities of adult sexual life\\u201d \\u2014 and so obviously applicable to contemporary styles of thought that if it were published today, it would certainly be deemed reactionary, a get-thee-to-Substack offense, the sort of verbal violence that can run only in either the right-wing press or Harper\\u2019s Magazine.\", \"And if \\u201cThe Women\\u2019s Movement\\u201d is a particularly stinging example of reactionary Didion, her early essay collections offer many others: Didion on the romance of John Wayne, Didion on the bureaucracy, Didion casting a cold eye on the hippies and what became the Summer of Love, Didion taking down all of 1960s-era liberal Protestantism in \\u201cJames Pike, American,\\u201d her brutal backward glance at a celebrity bishop.\", \"That these essays are not all overtly political only makes their critiques that much more lethal. If all fans of Didion have something they particularly owe her, then what she offered to admirers on the right was an example of how to write conservative essays that were first and foremost simply essays, their conservatism a matter of atmosphere and attitude rather than tedious polemic.\", \"This reactionary streak is not news to Didion\\u2019s liberal admirers. In the recent obituaries you could see it enfolded into a larger narrative of her career, in which the conservative aspect of her writing \\u2014 the Didion who began as a Goldwater voter and National Review contributor \\u2014 was something she gradually questioned and then transcended, coming over to a deeper skepticism about her country, the particularly American patterns of exclusion and oppression, and the Republican Party of Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush.\", \"This narrative, in which Didion (to quote Hilton Als of The New Yorker) inherited a mythology and then \\u201cbegan to see the cracks, and to wonder what those cracks meant,\\u201d is part of her protection against contemporary cancellation. It\\u2019s also accurate, so far as it goes: She did change ideologically; she did become more politically liberal in her attitudes and theories and commitments, and in that sense she genuinely belongs to her left-of-center admirers.\", \"But like many great writers, she doesn\\u2019t belong just to the ideological faction she happened to align with late in life. And on behalf of the conservative Didion, two things should be said.\", \"The first is that part of her conversion \\u2014 not all, but part \\u2014 actually reflects a continuity, in which Didion retained her coolness to enthusiasm and utopianism but simply applied it to the enthusiasms and utopianism of the Reaganite right, once the Reaganites seemed to become more powerful than hippies, feminists or progressive bishops. (In this reading she had something in common with V.S. Naipaul, another right-leaning litt\\u00e9rateur, whose work she once praised in The New York Review of Books for its preference for dazzling reality over imprisoning ideology.) As the American right became more ideological, she naturally turned away from it, sustaining a small-c conservative skepticism of American \\u201cdreampolitik\\u201d both when left-wing dreampolitik ruled the culture and, in the 1980s and again after Sept. 11, when right-wing dreampolitik took its place.\", \"There is a loose collection of writers, from Kevin Phillips to Michael Lind, who occupy a similar ground, belonging in some sense to the right but then, by the George W. Bush era, standing outside it, in judgment or critique. Many of them were particularly alienated, as Didion seemed to be, by the Bush-era G.O.P.\\u2019s Southern and evangelical inflection.\", \"But Didion, you could say, was alienated from the modern right twice over, because the conservative movement\\u2019s more secular aspect, its Western manifestation, represented precisely the postwar form of Californian life \\u2014 the vast suburbia of Orange County, the world of defense contractors and aerospace engineers \\u2014 that displaced her family\\u2019s agrarian, older-Californian world. Reaganism was for California\\u2019s newcomers, and she was rooted in the prior dispensation.\", \"And the specifically old-Californian aspect of her vision also offers a case study in the other thing to be said for the conservative Didion \\u2014 which is that her earlier, more right-leaning writing is just somewhat better than her later work. Not completely or in every case: She had brilliance in every phase of her career. But there is a reason that \\u201cSlouching Towards Bethlehem\\u201d and \\u201cThe White Album\\u201d have had stronger afterlives than a later collection like \\u201cPolitical Fictions,\\u201d which, for all its skill and insight and maturity, feels less unique, less pure and distinctive, than the coolly portentous vision of the \\u201960s that made her famous in the first place.\", \"Accounts of her political transformation often place a special stress on \\u201cWhere I Was From,\\u201d her revisionist 2003 meditation on her native state and familial mythos. Writing in The New Republic after her death, Jacob Bacharach described it as \\u201ca narrative of conversion \\u2014 or, maybe, of repudiation: the discovery, after a lifetime of unthinking faith, that the same lifetime\\u2019s worth of steadily accumulating doubts suddenly rolls down the mountainside and drowns out the old, mumbled liturgies.\\u201d Writing in 2015, Louis Menand in The New Yorker called it \\u201cthe central book in Didion\\u2019s career.\\u201d\", \"If we regard Didion\\u2019s career primarily in terms of her conversion, then Menand is right \\u2014 \\u201cWhere I Was From\\u201d offers the clearest sense of transformation, woven together with a critique and even repudiation of some of her early writing. But if you read the book side by side with that earlier work \\u2014 from \\u201cRun, River,\\u201d the Californian novel her later book critiques, to \\u201cNotes From a Native Daughter,\\u201d an essay in \\u201cSlouching Towards Bethlehem\\u201d \\u2014 it feels overlong and overcooked, less a radical revision and more a too-literal unpacking of the uncertainties and ambiguities that she handled with more subtlety and complexity early on.\", \"In a key moment in \\u201cWhere I Was From,\\u201d Didion takes her daughter, Quintana, to Old Sacramento, to show her the places steeped in family lore, and partway through realizes the falsity of the experience:\", \"Now here is Didion in \\u201cNotes From a Native Daughter,\\u201d making a similar point but with more ambiguity:\", \"See how the earlier essay, the earlier passage, contains the later idea \\u2014 the falseness or unreality of family history and personal memory \\u2014 but also conveys more complexity and mystery, the way that something can be unreal and real at the same time, the impossibility of making the clean separation between past and present, narrative and memory and experience, that the later book tries more crudely to establish.\", \"Though perhaps I am also drawn to the earlier Didion\\u2019s ambiguities because I am myself from California in a peculiar, attenuated way, and I have my own borrowed memories that I\\u2019m reluctant to give up. I was born in San Francisco, my father grew up in Santa Monica, and my sister lives in Los Angeles today. But I have never really lived there; we were distant from my father\\u2019s family growing up, and so my strong sense of that other coast, my powerful feeling of connection, is entirely the result of those \\u201ctraces of someone else\\u2019s memory\\u201d \\u2014 plus, of course, many years of reading the essays of Joan Didion.\", \"The migration Didion made away from a certain kind of conservative nostalgia, Bacharach suggests in his essay, is \\u201ca metonym for a larger American experience of history as a dream from which we have to wake up in order to write it down.\\u201d\", \"But Didion\\u2019s best work, even when it wasn\\u2019t her last word, denied the reader precisely that kind of clean dichotomy. The dream alone can be dangerous; it can curdle into ideology and fantasy. But the waking world isn\\u2019t all there is either, and you can\\u2019t describe reality fully unless you stay partway inside the dreams, the myths, the memories that don\\u2019t belong to you alone.\"]","href_hash":"d0d64bad6e2c11ecab3e7f2ef8c3bb6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d0d64bad6e2c11ecab3e7f2ef8c3bb6f"}},
