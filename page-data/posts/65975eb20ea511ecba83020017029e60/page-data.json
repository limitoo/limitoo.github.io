Now in its 13th edition, Feria has not only become a bestseller but has triggered frenzied debate and thrust its 30-year-old author into the spotlight.\", \"Sim\\u00f3n was born in Castilla-La Mancha, the region in central Spain renowned for its flat geography, agriculture and status as the setting for the adventures of Don Quixote. \", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/9996/production/_120381393_anairissimonfather2.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Father of Ana Iris Sim\\u00f3n</div>\", \"Her parents' families were from two villages there and her maternal grandparents were feriantes, or travelling fairground workers, giving the book its title. \", \"\\\"For a long time, since the nineties, we've had a lot of literature which is written for people in cities, by people in cities and about life in cities,\\\" says Sim\\u00f3n.  \", \"\\\"I was born in a tiny little village and lived in an even smaller one and I knew that important things didn't happen there,\\\" she says. \", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/549/cpsprodpb/9D1A/production/_120381204_anairissimon-asachild.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Ana Iris Sim\\u00f3n as a child</div>\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">1px transparent line</div>\", \"Sim\\u00f3n is no longer embarrassed by her origins and in Feria she delves into small-town life through colourful and often heartrending descriptions of her own experiences - such as secretly sneaking into church to take communion, or her father explaining her mother's recent miscarriage by showing her a jar containing the foetus.\", \"\\\"My family happens to be pretty normal, so through them you can see the recent history of the Spanish working class,\\\" she says. \", \"In some ways, Feria resembles the Neapolitan novels of pseudonymous author Elena Ferrante, which offer a vivid view of life growing up in Italy.   \", \"But as well as its autobiographical content, there is a strident, moral tone to Feria, as Sim\\u00f3n takes aim at a range of targets that she believes have tainted Spanish society and culture, including consumerism, classism, the marginalisation of rural Spain - and even reggaeton music. \", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/00DA/production/_120381200_anairissimn-lamancha.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Home life in La Mancha</div>\", \"\\\"I envy the life my parents had at my age,\\\" she writes in the book's first sentence, pointing out that they had a daughter, a house and \\\"a Thermomix\\\" kitchen appliance by then. She, on the other hand, is childless, shares a flat and earns \\u20ac1,000 (\\u00a3850) per month, despite having gone to university and travelled widely. \", \"In many ways, Sim\\u00f3n is expressing the ongoing frustrations of the \\\"indignados\\\" generation, who took to the streets and squares of Spain 10 years ago to protest against an economic and political system that left many of them disenfranchised and unable to enter the jobs and housing markets. \", \"Yet some commentators on the left have warned that the author has smuggled a right-wing treatise on to bookshelves, claiming that Sim\\u00f3n is romanticising rural and family life - both often seen as the domain of Spain's traditional, Catholic right. \", \"\\\"It may not be a fascist book, but without a doubt it is a book that wouldn't upset a fascist,\\\" wrote leftist essayist Pablo Batalla Cueto. \", \"Sim\\u00f3n courted further controversy in May, when she was invited to the prime minister's residence as part of the leftist government's plan to revive rural Spain.
