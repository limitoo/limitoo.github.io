Samet demystifies the cultural narrative that has shrouded the historical reality.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-29T18:56:03.000Z","content":"[\"Toward the end of \\u201cLooking for the Good War,\\u201d Elizabeth D. Samet\\u2019s discerning new book about the gauzy mythology that has shrouded the historical reality of World War II, she reminds us of the 2019 speech that then-President Trump gave at Normandy, on the 75th anniversary of D-Day. Some listeners were so surprised by the solemnity of Trump\\u2019s words that they eagerly welcomed it as evidence that he was donning the mantle of dignified statesman. But Samet, a professor of English at West Point who has previously written about teaching the literature of warfare, refuses to grade on a curve.\", \"She briskly enumerates the speech\\u2019s jumble of platitudes \\u2014 \\u201c\\u2018Great Crusade\\u2019 (Eisenhower), \\u2018Freedom\\u2019s Altar\\u2019 (a Civil War song), \\u2018consecrated to history\\u2019 (bastardized Lincoln), \\u2018new frontiers\\u2019 (misappropriated Kennedy), \\u2018heat of battle,\\u2019 \\u2018fires of hell,\\u2019 \\u2018Nazi fury,\\u2019 \\u2018awesome power,\\u2019 \\u2018breathtaking scale,\\u2019 \\u2018cherished alliance,\\u2019 \\u2018undying gratitude\\u2019 (clich\\u00e9s) and \\u2018tough guy\\u2019 (ad-lib).\\u201d What Samet calls our \\u201ctin-eared age of tweets\\u201d can make it harder to distinguish soaring oratory from flimsy bombast, but \\u201cmost of the sentences won\\u2019t bear the weight of careful reading,\\u201d she writes.\", \"And \\u201ccareful reading,\\u201d as Samet provocatively (and persuasively) argues, can in fact be a matter of life or death. Glib treatments of World War II have done real harm, she says, distorting our understanding of the past and consequently shaping how we approach the future. As \\u201cthe last American military action about which there is anything like a positive consensus,\\u201d World War II is \\u201cthe good war that served as prologue to three-quarters of a century of misbegotten ones.\\u201d\", \"Her book is therefore a work of unsparing demystification \\u2014 and there is something hopeful and even inspiring in this. Like the cadets she teaches at West Point, civilians would do well to see World War II as something other than a buoyant tale of American goodness trouncing Nazi evil. Yes, she says up front, American involvement in the war was necessary. But she maintains that it\\u2019s been a national fantasy to presume that \\u201cnecessary\\u201d has to mean the same thing as \\u201cgood.\\u201d\", \"Among the most credulous offenders, she says, have been figures like Stephen Ambrose and Steven Spielberg, who came together for the HBO mini-series of Ambrose\\u2019s \\u201cBand of Brothers\\u201d \\u2014 an ode to American might and pristine intentions. Ambrose may have been an academically trained historian, but he seemed to pride himself on being a hagiographer. \\u201cI was 10 years old when the war ended,\\u201d he once recalled. \\u201cI thought the returning veterans were giants who had saved the world from barbarism. I still think so. I remain a hero worshiper.\\u201d\", \"Not that Ambrose\\u2019s heroes would have necessarily recognized themselves in his beatific portraits. Samet quotes a memoir by the Shakespeare scholar Alvin Kernan, who joined the Navy in 1941 in order to escape a dire economic situation in rural Wyoming. \\u201cWe were children still,\\u201d he wrote, \\u201cand, like all children, fascinated with killing.\\u201d Such children may have fought valiantly, Samet writes, \\u201cbut their motivations were hardly lofty, their experience less than ennobling.\\u201d\", \"The extreme depravity of the Nazis would retrospectively sanctify the \\u201cinglorious work\\u201d of the Allied effort, but Samet points out that even after American entrance into the war, liberating the Jews was never a priority. \\u201cWhy We Fight,\\u201d a series of propaganda films that Frank Capra made between 1942 and 1945, made no mention of the Nazis\\u2019 systematic attempt to exterminate the Jews, even though the American government learned of the Final Solution\\u201d as early as the summer of 1942.\", \"The United States only entered the war after the attack on Pearl Harbor \\u2014 and even then, Samet says, contemporary observers remarked on \\u201ca general American indifference to the fact that the world was on fire.\\u201d The war in the Pacific was \\u201cbegun in revenge and complicated by bitter racism,\\u201d she writes. She quotes a Marine\\u2019s memoir recounting how Americans\\u2019 antipathy toward the Nazis couldn\\u2019t compare to their \\u201cburning hatred\\u201d for the Japanese. \\u201cJapanese were looked upon as something subhuman and repulsive,\\u201d the journalist Ernie Pyle wrote, \\u201cthe way some people feel about cockroaches or mice.\\u201d Surveying the records of the era, Samet contrasts this dehumanization with the portrayal of European fascists, who were more typically described as \\u201cgangsters.\\u201d\", \"Despite the swift ascent of the \\u201cgood war\\u201d mythology, there was a moment after World War II when a more complicated picture persisted \\u2014 and traces of it continue to this day, even if an \\u201copen, ambivalent, reflective mode of remembrance\\u201d has been largely obscured, Samet writes. She seems to have seen every noir film featuring a disillusioned veteran who struggles to adjust to the postwar American dispensation. But she also shows how Hollywood was quick to overwhelm the culture with its \\u201chabitual optimism.\\u201d The 1947 movie \\u201cThe Hucksters,\\u201d for instance, begins with a veteran returning to the advertising business only to find himself feeling disgusted by it; the happily-ever-after ending comes not with him rejecting the industry but with his resolve to \\u201csell good things, things that people should have, and sell them with dignity and taste.\\u201d\", \"The fall of Saigon in 1975 may have temporarily hobbled the American strut of exceptionalism and invincibility, but the end of the Cold War and the beginning of Operation Desert Storm worked to restore some American confidence. Yet as good as such confidence can feel, it can also be deadly, Samet writes, feeding a \\u201cpernicious American sentimentality\\u201d that \\u201cshort-circuits reason.\\u201d\", \"She ends with a chapter on the old Lost Cause mythology of the Civil War, which we have turned into \\u201ca kind of theme park,\\u201d suffused with symbolism and nostalgia, ignoring the expansionist wars this mythology later enabled. The country\\u2019s imperialist ambitions in the late-19th and early-20th centuries were promoted as a nationalist project that would finally unite the North and South against a foreign enemy.\", \"But Samet is maybe too insistent that the truth of the Civil War has been irrevocably lost to fanciful delusion. The myth, she says, is \\u201cso resistant to all subsequent attempts to undo it, the removal of a few statues and the renaming of a few buildings notwithstanding.\\u201d This seems to me a pat way of playing down what\\u2019s been happening over the last several years. Dismantling a few statues may not amount to a wholesale revision of historical memory, but to write it off as extraneous detail is to submit to another abstraction, one where the edges of Samet\\u2019s nuanced argument are tidier than they need to be. As she herself puts it, \\u201cWars are seething struggles, not object lessons.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"eccad87c514511ec9d91ff4c1b806a56"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eccad87c514511ec9d91ff4c1b806a56"}},
