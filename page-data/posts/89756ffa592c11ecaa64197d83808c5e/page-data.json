We saw a lot of films that are looking at the fight for democracy.\\u201d\", \"Examples include Rory Kennedy\\u2019s documentary \\u201cDownfall: The Case Against Boeing,\\u201d from Netflix, which investigates the two Boeing 737 Max crashes that killed 346 people; \\u201cThe Exiles,\\u201d a nonfiction film centering on three dissidents after the Tiananmen Square massacre; and two films that examine the Jane Collective \\u2014 an underground group of women from Chicago who between 1969 and 1973 helped women secure safe, illegal abortions before Roe v. Wade was handed down. One, the documentary \\u201cThe Janes,\\u201d was directed by Tia Lessin and Emma Pildes, with HBO producing. The other, \\u201cCall Jane,\\u201d is a fictional feature from Phyllis Nagy (the screenwriter of \\u201cCarol\\u201d) with a cast that includes Elizabeth Banks and Sigourney Weaver.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of the hallmark of independent work, isn\\u2019t it? A resistance to the status quo,\\u201d said the festival director, Tabitha Jackson. \\u201cThis year, it\\u2019s reflecting on the fact that we are in this age of reckoning, this age of accountability.\\u201d\", \"Three films take on that reckoning, examining the insidious nature of racism and privilege through the lens of Black women: \\u201cAlice,\\u201d a time-traveling take on slavery, stars Keke Palmer and Common, and was written and directed by Krystin Ver Linden. \\u201cMaster,\\u201d a film from Mariama Diallo starring Regina Hall, focuses on three women trying to find their place at an elite New England university. (Amazon will distribute.) And \\u201cNanny,\\u201d by the writer-director Nikyatu Jusu, follows an undocumented woman from Senegal who works for a well-off couple in New York City; Anna Diop (\\u201cTitans\\u201d) and Michelle Monaghan star. All three films, part of the U.S. dramatic competition, hail from first-timers and use supernatural elements.\", \"Of the submissions to Sundance this year, only 28 percent were from women. Yet among all the features selected, 52 percent were directed by women. When asked whether the programmers decided to boost women auteurs over men, they steered around the question, saying they are always looking to promote female filmmakers. Jackson added: \\u201cThe slightly depressing fact is that the figure of 28 percent submissions from women has remained pretty static across the years. It is a figure that we would wish to see higher because of what it indicates about the state of the industry. It\\u2019s surprising that so few are submitting.\\u201d\", \"The majority of the films at the festival, which runs Jan. 20-30, will arrive without distribution, a fact that Jackson calls \\u201ckind of cool.\\u201d But they\\u2019re also debuting at a time when theatrical distribution is still depressed amid consumers\\u2019 fears about returning to the movies. Though the market was held virtually in 2020, Apple paid a festival record $25 million to acquire \\u201cCODA,\\u201d the drama about a hearing daughter and her deaf family that was just named one of the American Film Institute\\u2019s 10 best films of the year. The industry will be watching the Sundance sales titles closely in January for clues to the health of both the streaming and theatrical markets.\", \"While sales are always dependent on how a film plays in the snowy confines of Park City, buyers may be leaning toward the better-known directors and actors, like Dunham, who is returning to the independent film scene 12 years after \\u201cTiny Furniture\\u201d with \\u201cSharp Stick,\\u201d about a na\\u00efve young Hollywood outsider who has an affair with her older boss. Dunham plays a supporting role in the film alongside Jon Bernthal and Jennifer Jason Leigh.\", \"Hazanavicius is making his Sundance debut a decade after he won the best director Oscar for his black-and-white silent dramedy. His new \\u201cFinal Cut\\u201d is a horror film featuring his wife and \\u201cArtist\\u201d star, B\\u00e9r\\u00e9nice Bejo, in the story of a small crew attacked by real zombies while shooting a low-budget zombie movie.\", \"Both the Dunham and Hazanavicius titles will debut in the Premieres section, which is usually reserved for more high-profile work. That includes Jesse Eisenberg\\u2019s feature directing debut, \\u201cWhen You Finish Saving the World,\\u201d which stars Julianne Moore and Finn Wolfhard of \\u201cStranger Things\\u201d and was produced by the indie label A24.\", \"Other buzzy titles include \\u201cAm I OK?,\\u201d starring Dakota Johnson in the feature directing debut of Tig Notaro and her partner, Stephanie Allynne; \\u201cGood Luck to You, Leo Grande,\\u201d with Emma Thompson as a retired educator who hires a young sex worker to teach her his ways; and \\u201cFresh,\\u201d an Adam McKay-produced film directed by Mimi Cave about a young woman (Daisy Edgar-Jones of \\u201cNormal People\\u201d) trying to survive the unusual appetites of her boyfriend (Sebastian Stan).\", \"Documentaries are always a popular draw at Sundance, and this year looks strong with Netflix debuting \\u201cjeen-yuhs: A Kanye Trilogy\\u201d (directed by Clarence Simmons, known as Coodie, and Chike Ozah), with new footage of Kanye West covering 21 years, and Showtime premiering \\u201cWe Need to Talk About Cosby,\\u201d W. Kamau Bell\\u2019s examination of the age-old question of whether you can or should separate the art from the artist.\", \"Two actresses-turned-directors are taking on the nonfiction genre for the first time. Amy Poehler is bringing the Amazon documentary \\u201cLucy and Desi\\u201d and Eva Longoria Bast\\u00f3n has \\u201cLa Guerra Civil,\\u201d about the rivalry between the boxers Oscar De La Hoya and Julio C\\u00e9sar Ch\\u00e1vez.\", \"\\u201cThese are two pleasant surprises in our programming,\\u201d Yutani said of the those two titles. \\u201cEva\\u2019s is such an interesting project for her to be involved in, and Amy Poehler is the perfect person to tell that story.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"89756ffa592c11ecaa64197d83808c5e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"89756ffa592c11ecaa64197d83808c5e"}},
