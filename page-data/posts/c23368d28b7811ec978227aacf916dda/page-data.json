Featuring Jeunet\\u2019s signature irreverence and colorful mise en sc\\u00e8ne, \\u201cBigBug\\u201d follows an ensemble cast of offbeat characters and their domestic robots, confined to a technologically advanced home by the malevolent androids that now rule the world. Together they must find a way out.\", \"Jeunet considers it a cynical entry in an oeuvre that includes \\u201cDelicatessen\\u201d (1991), about a murderous landlord and his tenants in a postapocalyptic reality, and \\u201cThe City of Lost Children\\u201d (1995), a steampunk fantasy centering on a mad scientist who steals children\\u2019s dreams.\", \"Speaking shortly before the recent Oscar nominations, the director, 68, said that two decades later it still pains him that \\u201cAm\\u00e9lie\\u201d didn\\u2019t win any of the five Academy Awards it was up for in 2002.\", \"He said he believed the academy shut out his film over the producer Harvey Weinstein\\u2019s awards campaign tactics. \\u201cIt was a punishment, not for me but for him,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut this was our year! That is a trophy I would have liked to have.\\u201d\", \"Jeunet was speaking from his home in Paris. These are edited excerpts from our conversation.\", \"Were you thinking about the dystopias of your earlier films, like \\u201cThe City of Lost Children\\u201d and \\u201cDelicatessen,\\u201d when you were writing \\u201cBigBug\\u201d?\", \"I used to say this was \\u201cDelicatessen 2.0.\\u201d No, the concept was to make a cheap movie, because all my films are very expensive and I was looking for something with a single set, like \\u201cDelicatessen.\\u201d It was a concept to write a story with people stuck in a room and it was created before Covid, which is funny. We wrote this story during the shooting of \\u201cThe Young and Prodigious T. S. Spivet\\u201d [about a boy genius on a cross-country journey]. I\\u2019m sure you don\\u2019t know about it.\", \"I actually have seen it.\", \"Oh, you saw it! Cool, because Harvey Weinstein did everything he could to kill that movie. [Laughs] Have you seen it in 3-D?\", \"Yes, it played in a couple theaters in 3-D in 2015. I remember it took a long time to be released in the U.S.\", \"I know, because he didn\\u2019t care. I refused to modify the film. Of course he wanted to re-edit, but now it\\u2019s fun to imagine him in jail. [Laughs]\", \"Can you elaborate on what happened with Harvey Weinstein on that film?\", \"He told me, \\u201cWe will do something better than with \\u2018Am\\u00e9lie.\\u2019 I promise.\\u201d But when after some test screenings he was like a gallery owner saying to the painter, \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to modify the green because in U.S. we don\\u2019t like green. I will ask the framer to put some blue instead.\\u201d I refused. I said, \\u201cI won\\u2019t change one frame.\\u201d So he punished me like he punished everybody. He wanted to do that with \\u201cAm\\u00e9lie\\u201d as well, but he couldn\\u2019t because it was such a success. He never touched a thing.\", \"Your films often feature mechanical gadgets. \\u201cBigBug\\u201d has a lot of robots that were physically built.\", \"I love to imagine these objects because I get to keep them. I don\\u2019t know if it\\u2019ll be possible with Netflix. I hope so. Two years ago, a beautiful exhibition of props from our movies in Paris and in Lyon had 180,000 admissions. I was waiting for money for \\u201cBigBug\\u201d and nobody wanted to produce it. But yes, it was such a pleasure to imagine the robots, especially Einstein [a mechanical bust resembling the physicist]. He had 82 motors inside to move.\", \"Thinking of how \\u201cBigBug\\u201d presents technology, are you afraid of the future or what the future may hold for humanity?\", \"I am just curious, because I am not young and I would like to live to see what will be the next gadget, the next iPhone, the next GPS. Maybe there will be more drama, maybe nothing. Maybe the earth will disappear like in \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up.\\u201d I\\u2019m curious more than afraid. If I had kids, maybe I would be more scared about the future.\", \"What do you believe it says about the future of our flawed species?\", \"I hate messages. But if there is a message in \\u201cBigBug\\u201d it is that artificial intelligence will never kill human beings because they will stay stupid. They don\\u2019t have a soul. They try to have a sense of humor, but they don\\u2019t understand anything. [Laughs]\", \"Why do you think it was difficult to find the funds to produce \\u201cBigBug\\u201d?\", \"Because in France, when you have something original you\\u2019re [expletive]. It was the case with \\u201cDelicatessen.\\u201d The same for \\u201cAm\\u00e9lie.\\u201d It was too weird, too quirky, as you say in English. With Netflix it was kind of a dream. They wrote me and said, \\u201cDo you have something?\\u201d And I said, \\u201cYes, I have a film, but in France nobody likes it. You won\\u2019t like it.\\u201d [Laughs] They told me, \\u201cSend it.\\u201d Twenty-four hours later it was greenlighted!\", \"Did you consider the fact that it will be streaming but not in theaters?\", \"Yes, but I have to admit I am pretty relieved because waiting for the first day in theaters, it\\u2019s so depressing. If it doesn\\u2019t do well enough in the first three days, you go to less and less theaters. With Netflix, half a billion people can see it. [Officially Netflix has some 220 million subscribers.] So even if just 1 percent of those people watch \\u201cBigBug,\\u201d it would be huge. Also, I don\\u2019t go often to the cinema because I don\\u2019t like to have young people beside me eating popcorn or playing with their iPhone or texting. It drives me crazy. I start yelling in the theater, so I prefer to watch films at home on a big plasma screen or with my projector.\", \"Last year \\u201cAm\\u00e9lie\\u201d turned 20. What do you think about the legacy of the film?\", \"That it continues! There was a new release in Germany and Belgium, and Sony [Pictures] Classics bought it now for the U.S. They\\u2019re going to do something with it, but of course, it\\u2019s not good timing with Covid. [The distributor confirmed that it plans to rerelease the movie.] At the Cannes Film Festival last year, for example, we showed the film on the beach with a big screen and it was free. They had 800 seats and they warned me, \\u201cIt\\u2019s raining today. Probably we won\\u2019t have a lot of people.\\u201d It was packed. They had to turn people away. Sometimes I think, \\u201cI am dead and I am in paradise and everybody is playing a character.\\u201d [Laughs]\", \"A few years ago you said that you were thinking of making a documentary about the making of \\u201cAm\\u00e9lie.\\u201d Is that still happening?\", \"Another disappointment because nobody wanted to produce it. It would have been so funny because I wanted to make fun of myself in it. It was going to be cheap to make but they said it\\u2019s risky. So I gave up. If I had proposed a serious documentary about \\u201cAm\\u00e9lie,\\u201d they would want to produce it.\", \"You also published a book of anecdotes in 2018 from the making of \\u201cAm\\u00e9lie.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s only available in French. If someone reading your article is interested for it in the U.S., my brother, the publisher, would be very happy. [Laughs] It\\u2019s between 500 and 600 small memories. It\\u2019s like when you eat candies, you cannot stop. If you saw \\u201cAm\\u00e9lie\\u201d you know I am very good at remembering things. I have a very bad memory for bad things, but for the good stuff, anecdotes and funny stories, I am very good.\", \"There was also a stage version of \\u201cAm\\u00e9lie.\\u201d Do you have any thoughts on that?\", \"I hate musicals. I accepted the money to save kids, but that\\u2019s the only reason. I support an organization that provides open-heart surgeries for children. In the end I think it wasn\\u2019t very good. It was a disaster on Broadway. [Laughs]\"]","href_hash":"c23368d28b7811ec978227aacf916dda"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c23368d28b7811ec978227aacf916dda"}},
