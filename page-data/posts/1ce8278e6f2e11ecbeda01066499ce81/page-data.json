The safe and easy thing to do with a winter preview would be to fill it with those known quantities. But that wouldn\\u2019t be much fun.\", \"So you\\u2019ll have to look elsewhere for \\u201cOzark\\u201d (Jan. 21), \\u201cBillions\\u201d (Jan. 23), \\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\\u201d (Feb. 18), \\u201cKilling Eve\\u201d (Feb. 27), \\u201cBetter Things\\u201d (Feb. 28), \\u201cOutlander\\u201d (March 6), \\u201cAtlanta\\u201d (March 24), \\u201cBridgerton\\u201d (March 26) or \\u201cBetter Call Saul\\u201d (undated but soon). Instead here are, in chronological order, 20 new shows or slightly lower-profile returning shows that look interesting. Try to fit in one or two.\", \"If you\\u2019re looking for a trend, how about notable actresses playing real-life women in some sort of trouble: Amanda Seyfried as Elizabeth Holmes (\\u201cThe Dropout\\u201d), Lily James as Pamela Anderson (\\u201cPam & Tommy\\u201d), Ren\\u00e9e Zellweger as the convicted murderer Pam Hupp (\\u201cThe Thing About Pam\\u201d), Julia Garner as the con woman Anna Sorokin (\\u201cInventing Anna\\u201d). \", \"Dates subject to change.\", \"The most acclaimed anime series of recent years, about young soldiers fighting to save the human race from mysterious and really creepy humanoid giants, begins its final run of episodes. (Crunchyroll, Funimation, Sunday)\", \"It may not be your show. But if you have teenagers, there\\u2019s a very good chance that this dreamy, graphic suburban soap opera is their show, and that they will maintain that nothing else so profoundly captures the turmoil and contingency of their lives. Zendaya, who won an Emmy for the first season, and Hunter Schafer return in Season 2 as the mentally troubled, lovestruck addict Rue and Jules, the transgender girl she adores. (HBO, Sunday)\", \"The actor Michael K. Williams had nearly completed a second season of this documentary series before his death in September. Like an Anthony Bourdain of the hustle, Williams examines \\u201cwhy people do the things they do\\u201d when the mainstream economy fails them. His Season 2 subjects include street-level identity thieves and a Baltimore rapper who rose to success on the back of bots. (Vice, Monday)\", \"The CW\\u2019s latest DC Comics adaptation stars Kaci Walfall, an engaging and authentically teenage actress. (She was 16 when the pilot was shot.) She plays a nerdy military brat who has a Superman fixation and a mysterious past of her own, in a series developed by Ava DuVernay with the \\u201cArrow\\u201d producer Jill Blankenship. (CW, Tuesday)\", \"It\\u2019s an Australian rom-com in the novel setting of Adelaide, starring the American actor Josh Gad, in a more toned-down performance than usual, as an immigrant widower who\\u2019s been torn apart by his wife\\u2019s death and is morbidly overprotective of his young daughter (Ariel Donoghue). Opposite Gad is the Australian actress Isla Fisher as the love interest who has a particular problem with dating, one that\\u2019s strongly hinted at in the title. (Peacock, Jan. 13)\", \"Bridget Everett gets the autobiographical you-can-go-home-again-but-it\\u2019s-damn-tough treatment in a dramedy set in her real-life hometown, Manhattan, Kan. Hannah Bos and Paul Thureen of the Brooklyn theater company the Debate Society created the show; the veteran improv comedian and musical-theater actor Jeff Hiller stands out as the heartbroken heroine\\u2019s unlikely new ally. (HBO, Jan. 16)\", \"Set in the red-light-and-drug-squats district of Amsterdam in 1980, this series is based on the popular novels of A.C. Baantjer, featuring the detective Jurre de Cock, played here as an enthusiastic rookie by Waldemar Torenstra. The buddy-cop formulas play out with energy and wit against the colorful backdrop. (MHz Choice, Jan. 18)\", \"This Spanish series, the first TV project of the director Alejandro Amen\\u00e1bar (\\u201cThe Others\\u201d), combines seagoing adventure and international political intrigue as a young Spanish diplomat (\\u00c1lvaro Mel) takes on an American treasure hunter who has appropriated the cargo of a sunken galleon. It\\u2019s an international, bilingual production with a difference: The major American characters \\u2014 a buccaneer and a principled lawyer \\u2014 are played by the high-caliber performers Stanley Tucci and Clarke Peters. (AMC+, Jan. 20)\", \"It\\u2019s one thing to make a recovery story that feels authentic to people who have been through it; it\\u2019s another to make a recovery story that is, if you\\u2019ll excuse the word, entertaining for everyone. Simone Finch, a \\u201cConners\\u201d writer, and Jenni Konner of \\u201cGirls\\u201d try to thread the needle in this melancholy comedy about a young alcoholic (Sofia Black-D\\u2019Elia) who comes home to Boston to sober up and cope with her problematic mother (Ally Sheedy). (Freeform, Jan. 20)\", \"First announced as an NBC project in 2012, this drama set among the upper crust of 1880s New York was going to be Julian Fellowes\\u2019s follow-up to \\u201cDownton Abbey.\\u201d It finally arrives with a newcomer, Louisa Jacobson (a daughter of Meryl Streep), starring as a country cousin who comes to the city to live with her old-money aunts, played by Christine Baranski and Cynthia Nixon. Carrie Coon plays an arriviste neighbor, and the Broadway-centric cast includes Den\\u00e9e Benton, Michael Cerveris, Linda Emond, Celia Keenan-Bolger, Audra McDonald, Debra Monk, Donna Murphy, Kelli O\\u2019Hara and John Douglas Thompson. (HBO, Jan. 24)\", \"Alan Tudyk looks to be having a blast playing a crotchety alien in this shaggy, likable science-fiction dramedy. In Season 1, he came to earth to destroy the human race for the good of the planet, but his ship crashed in the Rockies and he was forced to live among us, killing and assuming the form of the first person he came across. Since then, he\\u2019s been slowly mellowing, though the destruction of humanity remains on the table in Season 2. (Syfy, Jan. 26)\", \"The title would lead you to expect an over-the-top satire of an already over-the-top genre, but this sendup of psycho-thrillers is, in its early episodes, surprisingly understated. It is also promising that it stars Kristen Bell, who, while she has experience in this area (\\u201cScream 4\\u201d), is generally one of our most down-to-earth performers. (Netflix, Jan. 28)\", \"W. Kamau Bell directed this four-part documentary about Bill Cosby, re-examining his public record and conducting a wide range of interviews, many with people who grew up idolizing the comedian and now wrestle with their feelings about him. (Showtime, Jan. 30)\", \"The wonderful Lily James, perhaps still best known for playing Lady Rose on \\u201cDownton Abbey,\\u201d goes in a different direction in this comic mini-series from Seth Rogen\\u2019s production company about the Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee sex tape. Sebastian Stan, best known as the cyborg Bucky Barnes in the Marvel universe, plays Lee. (Hulu, Feb. 2)\", \"Shonda Rhimes takes a creator\\u2019s credit for the first time in her Netflix tenure, with a glossy mini-series that fictionalizes the story of the socialite scam artist Anna Sorokin a.k.a. Anna Delvey (Julia Garner) and her Boswell, a writer for a glossy New York magazine called Manhattan (Anna Chlumsky). (Netflix, Feb. 11)\", \"Into the techno-thriller microclimate that includes \\u201cHomecoming,\\u201d \\u201cMr. Robot,\\u201d \\u201cCounterpart\\u201d and \\u201cBlack Mirror\\u201d comes this series starring Adam Scott as an employee of a company that has developed an extreme approach to the work-life balance. The dark and quiet tale also features Patricia Arquette, John Turturro and, in a rare series appearance, Christopher Walken. (Another Walken show, the BBC series \\u201cThe Outlaws,\\u201d is due later this spring on Amazon Prime Video.) (Apple TV+, Feb. 18)\", \"A lot of good TV shows don\\u2019t win awards, but it\\u2019s particularly galling that this sharp and compelling drama about the crack cocaine trade in Los Angeles has not been nominated for a single prime-time Emmy across its four seasons. In Season 5, set in 1986, the self-made drug kingpin Franklin Saint (Damson Idris) encounters ever greater obstacles. (FX, Feb. 23)\", \"This one isn\\u2019t low profile, obviously, but a 12-year gap between seasons gets you special consideration. Returning from the original are Sam Waterston and Anthony Anderson; the half cops, half prosecutors structure; and, presumably, that sound effect. (NBC, Feb. 24)\", \"Amanda Seyfried plays the Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes, and Naveen Andrews plays her former subordinate and boyfriend, Sunny Balwani, in a dramatization whose timing, two months after Holmes\\u2019s fraud conviction, makes you wonder what last-minute tweaks the filmmakers will be able to get in. Speaking of the filmmakers, it\\u2019s striking that of the eight executive producers listed in press materials, seven are women, including the showrunner, Elizabeth Meriwether, the creator of \\u201cSingle Parents\\u201d and \\u201cNew Girl.\\u201d (Hulu, March 3)\", \"This mini-series came about after the true-crime story it tells, about a Missouri woman implicated in several murders, proved popular on NBC\\u2019s \\u201cDateline\\u201d and in a subsequent podcast. Normally, that lineage might determine whether or not you would be interested, but in this case there\\u2019s an added wrinkle: The central character is played by Ren\\u00e9e Zellweger, in just her second significant TV role (after \\u201cWhat/If\\u201d on Netflix). (NBC, March 8).\"]","href_hash":"1ce8278e6f2e11ecbeda01066499ce81"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1ce8278e6f2e11ecbeda01066499ce81"}},
