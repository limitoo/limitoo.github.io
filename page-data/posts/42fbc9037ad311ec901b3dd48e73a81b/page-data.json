More than 60 Raven employees walked out in early December, protesting the company ending the contracts of a dozen temporary Raven quality assurance workers, which they said felt abrupt and unfair.\", \"\\u201cThis is just the best thing for us and our company going forward, for us to have a voice,\\u201d said Erin Hall, a Raven quality assurance worker who helped organize the union. She said she hoped unionizing would lead to better job security, and that the Game Workers Alliance would be just \\u201cthe first domino at Activision.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI think a lot of us are motivated a lot by the fact that unionization in the games industry hasn\\u2019t really happened yet,\\u201d Ms. Hall said.\", \"Now, Activision executives will have to decide whether to recognize the union voluntarily or force a vote among employees, which would be overseen by the National Labor Relations Board. \", \"Activision, which Microsoft on Tuesday said it would purchase for nearly $70 billion, has been dealing with months of employee unrest. Before the company incited anger by not keeping the Raven workers in December, employees had been pushing for labor organizing and better treatment since July, when a California employment agency sued Activision, accusing it of fostering a culture where women were routinely sexually harassed and discriminated against.\", \"Jessica Gonzalez, a former Activision worker and one of the organizers of ABetterABK, a group of activists that formed in the wake of the lawsuit to improve conditions at Activision and its Blizzard and King units, said she hoped the Raven union, though small, would galvanize more labor efforts at the company \\u2014 which has about 10,000 employees \\u2014 and at other gaming publishers.\", \"\\u201cI think it\\u2019ll have a ripple effect across the industry,\\u201d Ms. Gonzalez said. \\u201cI\\u2019m hoping the rest of ABK will join our mission and help push this movement forward.\\u201d\", \"Unlike among European game workers, unions are rare in the North American gaming industry. Yet American employees are often subjected to unexpected layoffs and brutal \\u201ccrunch,\\u201d in which they are required to work long hours and weekends for weeks at a time to ensure games do not miss deadlines.\", \"Interest in unionization has picked up in recent years, with groups like Game Workers Unite, Game Workers of Southern California and the Campaign to Organize Digital Employees, a project from the Communications Workers of America union, all working on efforts to mobilize gaming employees.\", \"In December, workers at the independent game developer Vodeo Games, which has about a dozen employees, became the first video game studio union in North America.\", \"The Raven employees\\u2019 organizing effort was shepherded by C.W.A., a prominent tech, media and communications union.\", \"\\u201cA collective bargaining agreement will give Raven QA employees a voice at work, improving the games they produce and making the company stronger,\\u201d Sara Steffens, C.W.A.\\u2019s secretary-treasurer, said in a statement. \\u201cVoluntary recognition is the rational way forward.\\u201d\", \"In a news release announcing the union, C.W.A. and the Game Workers Alliance accused Activision of using \\u201csurveillance and intimidation tactics, including hiring notorious union busters, to silence workers.\\u201d\", \"The organizing effort comes at a time of upheaval for Activision, given the blockbuster Microsoft acquisition, though Ms. Hall and C.W.A. both said the timing was coincidental. Some workers view Microsoft\\u2019s purchase of the company, which could take a year or more to close, as a path for Activision to improve its workplace culture.\", \"Others see it as an easy out for the company\\u2019s embattled chief executive, Bobby Kotick, who has been under fire since last summer and is expected to step down as chief executive once the deal is complete, according to two people with knowledge of his plans.\", \"During a company livestream Thursday with Julie Hodges, Activision\\u2019s chief people officer, Mr. Kotick told employees he promised Microsoft that he would \\u201cstay as long as is necessary to ensure that we have a great integration and a great transition,\\u201d according to a transcript of the conversation viewed by The New York Times.\", \"Mr. Kotick also addressed Activision's culture problems, saying that the Microsoft deal \\u201creinforces\\u201d his commitment to reforming the workplace, \\u201cand we\\u2019ve certainly recognized that we have opportunities for improvement.\\u201d\", \"He added that Microsoft \\u201chas been on its own journey to improve its workplace, and I think that it\\u2019s a shared journey.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"42fbc9037ad311ec901b3dd48e73a81b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"42fbc9037ad311ec901b3dd48e73a81b"}},
