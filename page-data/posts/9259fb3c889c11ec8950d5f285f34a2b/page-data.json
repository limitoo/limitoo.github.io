Still, he says he has no regrets for it or the brain trauma that he thinks football gave him.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-02-07T21:06:22.000Z","content":"[\"CINCINNATI \\u2014 Tim Krumrie walked into the restaurant wearing a black Bengals cap and a shirt emblazoned with the logo of the Super Bowl he didn\\u2019t finish. His left leg \\u2014 the one he fractured in three places, in perhaps the grisliest injury in Super Bowl history \\u2014 is all healed. Of course it is. It has been 33 years.\", \"The more noticeable appendage is his hands. Krumrie does not shake people\\u2019s hands so much as he engulfs them in a clamp. They hoisted 75-pound anvils in the Bengals\\u2019 weight room. They grappled with double-teaming offensive linemen. They pushed a snowblower through the Wisconsin slush in the winter of 1989, mere weeks after surgeons implanted the 15-inch stabilizing nail inside his tibia.\", \"Last week, from across a half-circle booth, Krumrie extended those same hands. One cradled his iPhone, the other swiped through photos until he found images of his brain, captured in August 2015. Splotches of blue, stains of green.\", \"Those colors, revealed by nuclear imaging that shows how blood courses through tissue, indicated a lack of blood flow to affected areas of the brain. His doctor, having only read the scan, asked Krumrie whether he had been having mood swings and balance issues, sleeping difficulties and memory loss \\u2014 symptoms common among players who hit, and were hit, as often as Krumrie did across his 12 years in the N.FL.\", \"Yes, Krumrie said, he did.\", \"For him and other N.F.L. retirees, blows to the head \\u2014 or \\u201cgetting dinged,\\u201d Krumrie\\u2019s preferred euphemism \\u2014 were just an inconvenience during his playing days. Their accumulation, though, has meted out a brutal truth: brain trauma. Krumrie has acknowledged the consequences of his outstanding career and accepted them. He has also resolved to destigmatize talking about brain injuries.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a humbling experience to say, \\u2018Hey, I have a problem,'\\u201d said Krumrie, a two-time All-Pro nose tackle. \\u201cYou\\u2019re supposed to be a tough guy. This is reality. My reality is I see that and I recognize that and I address that. Just like my leg, I addressed it. And I won.\\u201d\", \"Krumrie harbors no regrets toward football\\u2019s role in his health. He would break his other leg, he said, merely to play in another Super Bowl \\u2014 not even to avenge Cincinnati\\u2019s loss to San Francisco at the end of the 1988 season. All those football games, he won or lost. Either he tackled the running back or he didn\\u2019t. Those were binary propositions. The brain, when damaged, does not fully heal. So Krumrie (pronounced KRUM-rye) has managed his symptoms by adhering to routines.\", \"He stopped drinking Diet Coke and alcohol. He reads every day \\u2014 books about Jerry Rice, Vince Lombardi and Brett Favre, who, Krumrie noted, came to start in Green Bay, in 1992, because Packers quarterback Don Majkowski injured his ankle on a Krumrie sack.\", \"Before trips to the market, he photographs what he needs to buy. He writes Post-it reminders. Krumrie also continues to wear, for maintenance, a device he likened to a football helmet without a face mask. It transmits infrared light into his skull to improve blood flow.\", \"After the first of 30 treatments, he said, names and memories flooded back. His hands flipped to another set of images, taken the last time he had the nuclear imaging, called a Spect scan, in December 2015. Much better. More gray filled the screen. The blemishes, though still present, had receded some.\", \"\\u201cSome guys can\\u2019t talk about it,\\u201d Krumrie said. \\u201cAm I a tough guy? Put me in a ring with anybody \\u2014 today. That mind-set is still there. Can I do it? No. But my mind says I can.\\u201d\", \"The Cincinnati Enquirer detailed this phase of his life in December 2017, a few months before he and his wife, Cheryl Krumrie, left Steamboat Springs, Colo., where they loved to ski and snowshoe and bike, and relocated to the Cincinnati area. Back to the embrace of old friends. Back to the familiar.\", \"\\u201cWe could surround Tim with people he\\u2019s known for a really long time and who are accepting and willing to let that stuff go by,\\u201d Cheryl said of the move. \\u201cAnd he feels very safe around them, like he doesn\\u2019t have to pretend he\\u2019s something he\\u2019s not.\\u201d\", \"Only those who know Tim Krumrie well, she said, sense a difference. He still conveys the same traits that defined him in his football-playing prime. \\u201cTimmy could eat nails and spit them out,\\u201d Jason Buck, a former Bengals teammate, said \\u2014 now, at 61. Krumrie works out for two hours every day. A staccato laugh punctuates stories and sentences.\", \"The Bengals\\u2019 turnabout from 4-11-1 to A.F.C. champions has invigorated Krumrie, though he still forgets things, like he did en route to the Arrowhead Stadium complex ahead of this year\\u2019s A.F.C. championship game. As he and Cheryl drove past Kansas City\\u2019s training facility, she asked if he remembered it, since he coached there for four years. Nope, he said.\", \"But on other days, he will recall anecdotes and names and words that he thought had been lost forever.\", \"\\u201cHe has stayed pretty steady,\\u201d Cheryl said. \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m happy with that, because there\\u2019s no getting better. There\\u2019s no recreating and making the brain right again. I\\u2019m just looking to stay in the same place. Being status quo is fine with me.\\u201d\", \"When Evan McPherson\\u2019s overtime field goal propelled the Bengals to the A.F.C. title, the Krumries, guests of N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell, rejoiced. In a quiet moment in the suite, their son, Dexter, told Cheryl that a Bengals win in the Super Bowl against the Los Angeles Rams would provide Tim Krumrie with closure.\", \"When Cheryl relayed that, Krumrie said he was going to cry: He hadn\\u2019t thought about it like that. He was just looking forward to scouting the Rams\\u2019 position groups to see how the Bengals measured up. He was certain they would beat Kansas City, but knew he could not control the outcome.\", \"\\u201cI live every day for every day,\\u201d Krumrie said. \\u201cI wake up, it\\u2019s daylight, it\\u2019s a good day.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9259fb3c889c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9259fb3c889c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
