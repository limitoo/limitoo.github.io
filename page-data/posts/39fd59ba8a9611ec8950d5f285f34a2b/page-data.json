The supplier collects used masks from various companies and delivers them to Future Post. There, they sit in bags for a couple of weeks to minimise bugs, and then the bags are thrown into a granulator with milk bottles and soft plastics and turned out into small pieces used to make the posts. The posts are then sent throughout New Zealand. \\u00a0\", \"The company has only used the masks in their posts for the last three months, but Wenzlink estimates millions have been processed.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cWe've been doing this for a month or three now and it's just sort of starting to really get a few leads now, like I think in the last week we've had 100 different firms call about whether we can take their stuff, so there\\u2019s a lot out there.\\u201d\\u00a0\", \"He hopes to have a second line running in the next couple of weeks, which will help keep up with demand, and is close to finalising a second site in the South Island.
