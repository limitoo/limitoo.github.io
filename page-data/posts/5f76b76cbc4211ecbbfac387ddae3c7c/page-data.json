that his own military could achieve victory \\\"at minimal cost;\\\" that Europeans would remain \\\"risk-averse\\\" and that his own economy was \\\"sanctions-proofed\\\" by massive foreign currency reserves. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"When he launched his war seven weeks ago, Putin was proven wrong on each of those counts,\\\" Burns said. \\u00a0\", \"He said scenes in Mariupol and Kharkiv, under weeks-long assault by the Russians, were \\\"sadly reminiscent\\\" of images he witnessed in Grozny, Chechnya, as a young diplomat in the winter of 1994.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"But Ukrainian will is unbroken, and Putin's Russia has inflicted massive material and reputational damage on itself,\\\" he said. \\u00a0\", \"Burns extolled what he said was the largely unseen work of U.S. intelligence officers and repeatedly lauded the effects of the Biden administration's policy of publicly releasing declassified intelligence about Russia's plans, which he said had \\\"paid off in some important ways.\\\" \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"\\\"By being open with some of our secrets, we made it harder for Putin to obscure the truth of his unprovoked and vicious aggression,\\\" Burns said, adding that the success of the strategy reflected the need for \\\"new thinking and new tactics\\\" in a uniquely demanding era for intelligence. \\u00a0\", \"Last week, the intelligence community broadened the scope of the intelligence it was sharing with Ukraine to reflect changing tactical realities and address a looming Russian offensive in the east and south of the country, according to U.S. officials. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"We are intensely sharing timely intelligence with the Ukrainians to help them defend themselves throughout their country, including in areas held by Russia before the 2022 invasion,\\\" a U.S. intelligence official told CBS News. \\u00a0\", \"Burns said during a question-and-answer session Thursday that earlier \\\"rhetorical posturing\\\" by the Kremlin about the potential use of nuclear weapons had not, to date, been matched by \\\"practical evidence\\\" of deployments or military dispositions, but said the CIA would \\\"watch for that very intently.\\\" \\u00a0\", \"He also said the agency would boost the resources it dedicated to China, which, he said, sought to overtake the U.S. \\\"in literally every domain.\\\" He said the CIA aimed to \\\"double\\\" the number of its Mandarin-speaking officers and increase overseas posts focused on Beijing. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"Nothing will matter more to our long-term success as an intelligence agency than how well we compete with the [People's Republic of China] and how well we organize ourselves for that competition over the next few years,\\\" Burns said.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"5f76b76cbc4211ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5f76b76cbc4211ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
