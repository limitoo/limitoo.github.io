The second prize winning would have been worth $3 million had there been any winners who purchased the Megaplier for an extra $1.\", \"But 13 ticket holders correctly matched four white balls and the Mega Ball, winning them each $10,000. One of the winners bought the Megaplier, tripling their third prize to $30,000.\", \"A group of 200 ticket holders matched four of the five white balls, but not the Mega Ball, each earning $500, with 43 of them each earning the Megaplier prize of $1,500.\", \"There were 547 players who matched three white balls, each winning $200, with 108 of them each winning the Megaplier prize of $600.\", \"The next Mega Millions drawing will be on Friday, November 26, at 11 p.m. ET, for a jackpot prize of $94 million, with a cash-value option of $66.3 million.\", \"Last Friday's drawing also saw no grand prize winner and no ticket holders correctly guessed the five white balls minus the Mega Ball to win the second prize, valued at $1 million.\", \"However, eight players last Friday did match four of the five white balls plus the Mega Ball, which earned them each the third prize of $10,000.

Five white balls are drawn from a set of balls numbered 1 through 70, while one yellow Mega Ball is drawn from balls numbered 1 through 25. You win if the numbers on your lottery ticket match the numbers of the balls drawn on that date.\", \"Mega Millions tickets cost $2 per play. If no one wins the jackpot prize, the money is added to the top prize for the following drawing.\", \"Most states offer a Megaplier option, which costs an additional $1 per play and increases non-jackpot prizes by two, three, four or five times. Before each Mega Millions drawing on Tuesdays and Fridays, the Megaplier is drawn from a pool of 15 balls. Five of these balls are marked with 2X, six with 3X, three with 4X and one with 5X.\", \"The odds of winning with a $2 Mega Millions ticket are one in 303 million.
