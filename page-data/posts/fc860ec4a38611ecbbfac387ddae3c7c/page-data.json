British Prime Minister Boris Johnson reportedly plans a trip to Saudi Arabia next week over oil prices as well.\", \"The number of death penalty cases being carried out in Saudi Arabia had dropped during the coronavirus pandemic, though the kingdom continued to behead convicts under King Salman and his assertive son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\", \"The state-run Saudi Press Agency announced Saturday's executions, saying they included those \\\"convicted of various crimes, including the murdering of innocent men, women and children.\\\"\", \"The kingdom also said some of those executed were members of al-Qaida, the Islamic State group and also backers of Yemen's Houthi rebels. A Saudi-led coalition has been battling the Iran-backed Houthis since 2015 in neighboring Yemen in an effort to restore the internationally recognized government to power.\", \"Those executed included 73 Saudis, seven Yemenis and one Syrian. The report did not say where the executions took place.\", \"\\\"The accused were provided with the right to an attorney and were guaranteed their full rights under Saudi law during the judicial process, which found them guilty of committing multiple heinous crimes that left a large number of civilians and law enforcement officers dead,\\\" the Saudi Press Agency said.\", \"\\\"The kingdom will continue to take a strict and unwavering stance against terrorism and extremist ideologies that threaten the stability of the entire world,\\\" the report added. It did not say how the prisoners were executed, though death-row inmates typically are beheaded in Saudi Arabia.\", \"An announcement by Saudi state television described those executed as having \\\"followed the footsteps of Satan\\\" in carrying out their crimes.\", \"The executions drew immediate international criticism.\", \"\\\"The world should know by now that when Mohammed bin Salman promises reform, bloodshed is bound to follow,\\\" said Soraya Bauwens, the deputy director of Reprieve, a London-based advocacy group.\", \"Ali Adubusi, the director of the European Saudi Organisation for Human Rights, alleged that some of those executed had been tortured and faced trials \\\"carried out in secret.\\\"\", \"\\\"These executions are the opposite of justice,\\\" he said.\", \"The kingdom's last mass execution came in January 2016, when the kingdom executed 47 people, including a prominent opposition Shiite cleric \\u00a0who had rallied demonstrations in the kingdom.\", \"In 2019, the kingdom beheaded 37 Saudi citizens, most of them minority Shiites, in a mass execution across the country for alleged terrorism-related crimes. It also publicly nailed the severed body and head of a convicted extremist to a pole as a warning to others. Such crucifixions after execution, while rare, do occur in the kingdom.\", \"Activists, including Ali al-Ahmed of the U.S.-based Institute for Gulf Affairs, and the group Democracy for the Arab World Now said they believe that over three dozen of those executed Saturday also were Shiites. The Saudi statement, however, did not identify the faiths of those killed.\", \"Shiites, who live primarily in the kingdom's oil-rich east, have long complained of being treated as second-class citizens. Executions of Shiites in the past have stirred regional unrest. Saudi Arabia meanwhile remains engaged in diplomatic talks with its Shiite regional rival Iran to try to ease yearslong tensions.\", \"Sporadic protests erupted Saturday night in the island kingdom of Bahrain - which has a majority Shiite population but is ruled by a Sunni monarchy, a Saudi ally - over the mass execution.\", \"The 1979 seizure of the Grand Mosque remains a crucial moment in the history of the oil-rich kingdom.\", \"A band of ultraconservative Saudi Sunni militants took the Grand Mosque, home to the cube-shaped Kaaba that Muslims pray toward five times a day, demanding the Al Saud royal family abdicate. A two-week siege that followed ended with an official death toll of 229 killed. The kingdom's rulers soon further embraced Wahhabism, an ultraconservative Islamic doctrine.\", \"Since taking power, Crown Prince Mohammed under his father has increasingly liberalized life in the kingdom, opening movie theaters, allowing women to drive and defanging the country's once-feared religious police.\", \"However, U.S. intelligence agencies believe the crown prince also ordered the slaying and dismemberment of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, while overseeing airstrikes in Yemen that killed hundreds of civilians.\", \"In excerpts of an interview with The Atlantic magazine, the crown prince discussed the death penalty, saying a \\\"high percentage\\\" of executions had been halted through the payment of so-called \\\"blood money\\\" settlements to grieving families.\", \"\\\"Well about the death penalty, we got rid of all of it, except for one category, and this one is written in the Quran, and we cannot do anything about it, even if we wished to do something, because it is clear teaching in the Quran,\\\" the prince said, according to a transcript later published by the Saudi-owned satellite news channel Al-Arabiya.\", \"\\\"If someone killed someone, another person, the family of that person has the right, after going to the court, to apply capital punishment, unless they forgive him. Or if someone threatens the life of many people, that means he has to be punished by the death penalty.\\\"\", \"He added: \\\"Regardless if I like it or not, I don't have the power to change it.\\\"\", \"The executions on Saturday were announced a day after the release of Saudi blogger and human rights activist Raif Badawi, who had been sentenced to 1,000 lashes and 10 years' prison on charges of insulting Islam.\", \"But Badawi, who received only 50 lashes before the punishment was halted following global condemnation, is now subject to a 10-year travel ban, officials confirmed to AFP on Saturday.\", \"It means the 38-year-old is unable to rejoin his wife Ensaf Haidar and their three children in Canada, where they fled following his arrest.\", \"In recent years, Saudi has announced a series of reforms concerning sentences, including a moratorium on the death penalty for drug offences, as well as abolishing court-ordered floggings.\", \"In April 2020, the kingdom also announced it was ending the death penalty for those convicted of crimes committed when they were under 18.\", \"Last year, Saudi Arabia executed a man from the minority Shiite community who was convicted on charges related to an anti-government protest when he was a teenager.\", \"On Saturday, a rights group and relatives of a Saudi man sentenced to death when he was a minor said he had been taken to hospital after going on hunger strike and collapsing.\", \"Abdullah al-Howaiti, who was just 14 when he was arrested in 2017 on charges of armed robbery and killing a police officer, was first sentenced to death in 2019, with the verdict upheld last month in a retrial.\", \"\\\"Abdullah has gone on hunger strike and has been hospitalised after collapsing,\\\" Reprieve said.\", \"The AFP contributed to this report.\"]","href_hash":"fc860ec4a38611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fc860ec4a38611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
