Her disappearance started a nearly 40-year saga that has included criminal investigations, breathless media coverage, books, a film and a documentary, much of it centered around her now-notorious husband, Robert A. Durst.\", \"Now, decades after her disappearance \\u2014 and just weeks after Mr. Durst was convicted of murder in another woman\\u2019s death in Los Angeles \\u2014 prosecutors in Westchester, N.Y., say they can finally prove what many have long suspected.\", \"Mr. Durst, a one-time heir to a real estate empire whose towers are strung across Manhattan, was indicted in White Plains on Monday on a single count of second-degree murder that accuses him of killing Kathie Durst when she was 29 and months away from fulfilling her lifelong dream of becoming a doctor.\", \"\\u201cFor nearly four decades there has been a great deal of speculation about this case, much of it fueled by Robert Durst\\u2019s own highly publicized statements,\\u201d Miriam E. Rocah, the Westchester district attorney, said in a statement. \\u201cAn indictment is a crucial step in the process of holding wrongdoers accountable for their actions.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Durst, who has since been tried for two different murders and convicted once, has long insisted that he did not kill his wife. But he has acknowledged that he was violent toward her on the night of her disappearance. He told the producers of the 2015 documentary, \\u201cThe Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst,\\u201d that he engaged in a \\u201cpushing, shoving argument\\u201d with Kathie Durst that night in South Salem, about 50 miles northeast of Manhattan.\", \"The case, the first in which Mr. Durst was implicated, in some ways represents a fitting conclusion to the long, strange legal odyssey surrounding him. Over the years of suspicion that followed his wife\\u2019s disappearance, his bizarre affect and disarming manner in interviews made him an irresistible subject for true-crime stories.\", \"For the investigators who long pursued him, Mr. Durst proved to be a challenging adversary. Only this year was he finally convicted of murder. Just two weeks before the Westchester County indictment, Mr. Durst, 78 and frail, was sentenced in Los Angeles to life without parole for the murder of his confidante Susan Berman in December 2000. The jury in that case found that Mr. Durst had shot Ms. Berman in the back of her head because he feared she was about to reveal to investigators what she knew about the disappearance and murder of Kathie Durst.\", \"Ms. Berman, a journalist and screenwriter who was living in New York in 1982, arranged interviews with the city\\u2019s tabloids for Mr. Durst at the time his wife disappeared. Both of them told police and reporters that Ms. Durst was drug-addled and in danger of flunking out of Albert Einstein College of Medicine, contrary to school officials and academic records.\"]","href_hash":"a821e9ec3b5911ec9d3a000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a821e9ec3b5911ec9d3a000017025a03"}},
