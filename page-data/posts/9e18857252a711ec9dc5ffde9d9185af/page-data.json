My husband and I were engaged at the time, and as a holiday present, he bought me a selection of clothing from a local boutique. I absolutely detested everything he got me \\u2014 including a pair of those hideous jeggings \\u2014 and I have no poker face, so my reaction went undisguised: A for effort, D for execution. This wasn\\u2019t the first time he\\u2019d missed the mark on a present; we still don\\u2019t talk about the robot panda fiasco of 2007, though it was immortalized on a podcast.\", \"I tried to rein in my visible displeasure, but the damage was done (the jeggings went over worse than the panda, which was at least kind of cute). We were both disappointed, and the episode confirmed my long-held feelings about compulsory gift-giving, especially around the holidays: Though I don\\u2019t begrudge anyone who finds joy in holiday gift-giving, I find the whole exercise to be emotionally exhausting and spiritually unfulfilling, often causing more anxiety for both parties than it\\u2019s worth.\", \"I think this is in part because I grew up in a household that had no particular attachment to gift-giving rituals. I\\u2019m Jewish and I can\\u2019t remember not knowing that American Jewish parents give their kids gifts on Hanukkah so that the kids don\\u2019t feel left out of the gift-giving season, despite not celebrating Christmas.\", \"As soon as I was old enough, around 12 as I recall, my parents just started giving me cash instead of gifts for both my birthday and the holidays. It was more efficient and about as sentimental as making a list and them buying from it. To this day, they refuse all gifts except handmade cards or crafts from my children.\", \"But I married into a family that both celebrates Christmas and finds gift-giving meaningful, so I wanted to learn how to give and get gifts gracefully. And while I have improved over the 16 years my husband and I have been together, this still really isn\\u2019t my forte. We give our children and their cousins presents, but it\\u2019s getting fraught already with my older daughter, who is quite particular and has about as good a poker face as I do.\", \"When I recently tweeted about my hatred of both giving and receiving gifts, I found many kindred spirits. I also learned that there are psychological, cultural and economic implications around gift-giving, and ended up in an internet rabbit hole reading Derrida and wondering if pure altruism really exists.\", \"Joel Waldfogel, a professor and an associate dean at the University of Minnesota\\u2019s Carlson School of Management and the author of \\u201cScroogenomics: Why You Shouldn\\u2019t Buy Presents for the Holidays,\\u201d has found that putting sentimental value aside, goods are worth 20 percent less per item when they\\u2019re gifts. So if your boyfriend spends $100 on a robotic panda for you (you know, hypothetically), on average you\\u2019ll get only $80 worth of utility out of it.\", \"As Waldfogel explained it to me, \\u201cWe are usually pretty good judges of what we need and want,\\u201d but we are not very good judges of what other people need and want. He said that economists call this a \\u201cresource allocation problem\\u201d and that the whole exchange is \\u201calmost doomed,\\u201d quickly adding that maybe that\\u2019s too strong a word, though gift-giving is indeed \\u201cvery challenging.\\u201d\", \"Not all economists agree. Benjamin Ho, an associate professor of economics at Vassar College, who has studied the role of gifts for building trust, told me that \\u201cgifts have a lot of value in society\\u201d and that the reason gift-giving and receiving is so challenging is part of the point. \\u201cIf it was easy to get a gift for people, anyone could do it,\\u201d he said. Giving a good gift shows that you know someone well, and it builds trust over time. Receiving a gift may be stressful, too, because reciprocity is part of the process, Ho explained, so we feel we need to repay the present at some point.\", \"There\\u2019s another economic concept that may explain why I find it so hard to embrace holiday season gift-buying, Ho said \\u2014 the concept of diminishing returns. When we buy so many gifts for people who are not close to us, and it\\u2019s compulsory rather than motivated by any sort of feeling or desire, the value of the gift drops for the giver as well as the recipient.\", \"Though I appreciated the cold, hard, economic analysis, I felt most moved by the description of gift-giving I heard from Mark Osteen, a professor of English at Loyola University Maryland and the editor of \\u201cThe Question of the Gift: Essays Across Disciplines.\\u201d First, he said that many people dislike Christmas gift-giving because the commercial process removes any sacredness around the exchange. \\u201cIt becomes a drop of water in the sea now, one more purchased item, one more ordinary exchange we have no stake in,\\u201d as he put it. Many gifts \\u2014 like family heirlooms \\u2014 have significant emotional value that transcends the market, he said.\", \"Osteen also said that \\u201ca gift is a story, because you\\u2019re telling a story about the person you give it to, and a story of how we know each other.\\u201d I identified with that, because my husband\\u2019s bad gift-giving and my ungracious reaction has become part of our narrative as a couple, and part of our lore as we created a family.\", \"We of course got to know each other better over the years, including through our failures and successes at buying each other presents. My husband learned that he can buy me wearables only if his choices get sign-off from his very fashionable sister, who has excellent taste and has always done right by me. I learned that the gifts he enjoys most are experiences, not things, so for his recent birthday I arranged for my parents to watch our daughters and booked us a trip upstate for the weekend.\", \"We\\u2019ve also come around to the other\\u2019s point of view to some extent: I\\u2019ve discovered ways to enjoy gift-giving, especially for new babies \\u2014 and for my own children. Making my tiny tough customers happy by showing them how much I am listening to their interests is a particular delight. My husband can laugh at his past gifts gone awry, and he concedes that a lot of holiday gift-giving can feel phoned-in. And we decided together that we\\u2019re not getting each other anything this year. An empty stocking is better than a pair of unfortunate jeggings any day.\", \"If you want a chance to get your Tiny Victory published, find us on Instagram @NYTparenting and use the hashtag #tinyvictories; email us; or enter your Tiny Victory at the bottom of this page.
