one at Pariroa near Tongaporutu and the other at Gilbert Stream off Pukearuhe Road in Mimi.\", \"The work requires about 400,000 cubic metres of gas to be vented at three locations, including one alongside State Highway 3.\", \"It is being is timed to coincide with Auckland Anniversary weekend to minimise disruption to supply.\", \"In a statement, Firstgas said it had liaised with the community and worked with the Taranaki Regional Council and Worksafe to ensure its safety controls were robust.\", \"But a bach owner -
