The Tesla and SpaceX boss has published a number of tweets over the years that have caused a stir.\", \"In March last year, he wrote that \\\"the coronavirus panic is dumb\\\" and also stated that \\\"kids are essentially immune\\\" to the virus.\", \"Some months later he weighed in on the gender identity discourse by stating: \\\"Pronouns suck.\\\"\", \"And in the past few days the multi-billionaire has offered to counter assertions that he does not pay a fair share of income tax by offering to sell off 10 percent of his Tesla stock\\u2014but only after letting a Twitter poll decide it first.\", \"When Portland senator Ron Wyden targeted Musk by calling for a billionaires income tax over the weekend, Musk responded with a lewd remark about Wyden's Twitter profile picture.\", \"With all this in mind the 'edgelord' interpretation of Musk's new Twitter identity may appear clear-cut.
