After running tests, including those meant to detect 19 various respiratory pathogens, Dr. O\\u2019Connor said the culprit was gastroesophageal reflux, or acid reflux, a condition treatable with Pepcid.\", \"Dr. O\\u2019Connor also said that Mr. Biden\\u2019s gait had become stiffer, which he said had been caused by age-related changes in the president\\u2019s spine. He added that an \\u201cextremely detailed neurologic exam\\u201d had ruled out the possibility that the stiffness could be caused by a stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson\\u2019s, or other neurological disorders.\", \"A foot fracture Mr. Biden suffered last year \\u201chas healed nicely,\\u201d Dr. O\\u2019Connor said, though he added that the president could benefit from orthopedic shoes.\", \"A three-millimeter \\u201cbenign-looking\\u201d polyp was found during what Dr. O\\u2019Connor said was a regularly scheduled colonoscopy, and a pathologist\\u2019s evaluation of the polyp is expected to be completed next week. Mr. Biden\\u2019s lipid levels are \\u201cremarkably low,\\u201d Dr. O\\u2019Connor said.\", \"During the colonoscopy, Vice President Kamala Harris became the first woman to assume acting presidential duties. She spent that 85-minute span of time in her West Wing office watching live television coverage of the House passing a large social spending package, her office said.\", \"Historically, presidential checkups are used to bolster whatever image the president wishes to present about his health, and the details provided relate in no small part to the president\\u2019s age and health. There is no template for what presidents should release about their health, and the details they choose to disclose are up to them. In Mr. Biden\\u2019s case, his physical was not included on his public schedule ahead of time, and was performed amid an onslaught from conservative commentators raising questions about his age \\u2014 he turns 79 on Saturday \\u2014 and his fitness to hold office.\", \"Polling released by Politico and Morning Consult this week found that a growing number of voters do not think that Mr. Biden is in good health, and that voters are about evenly split on whether he is mentally fit.\", \"Mr. Biden\\u2019s predecessor, Donald J. Trump, faced similar questions about his mental acuity throughout his presidency. In 2018, questions about his mental health, fueled by the publication of the book \\u201cFire & Fury,\\u201d intensified to the point that Mr. Trump insisted to the public that he was a \\u201cstable genius.\\u201d\", \"Dr. O\\u2019Connor did not say in his report whether Mr. Biden underwent cognitive testing, which many doctors recommend for older adults. Dr. O\\u2019Connor served as Mr. Biden\\u2019s physician when he was vice president, and was named the president\\u2019s physician on Inauguration Day.\", \"Since Mr. Biden assumed office, Republicans have made repeated references to his age. In September, Senator Jim Risch, Republican of Idaho, quizzed Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken in a Senate hearing about Mr. Biden\\u2019s fitness for office, declaring the Biden presidency a \\u201ca puppeteer act.\\u201d In that exchange, a bemused-looking Mr. Blinken replied that \\u201cthe president very much speaks for himself.\\u201d\", \"In presidential physicals, the White House often provides specific information on height, weight and cholesterol. President George W. Bush\\u2019s physicals noted that he smoked the occasional cigar. His decision in 2002 to undergo a colonoscopy at Camp David \\u2014 and briefly transfer presidential power to Vice President Dick Cheney \\u2014 made headlines. \", \"Dr. O\\u2019Connor said Mr. Biden\\u2019s physical exam was \\u201cfundamentally unchanged from baseline\\u201d aside from new findings that concluded he had mild peripheral neuropathy, a condition defined by nerve damage, pain and stiffening in the feet. Despite extensive testing, the team found no cause for that condition.\", \"Mr. Biden\\u2019s height, 5 feet 11 inches, and weight, 184 pounds, earned him a body mass index of 25, which is on the low end of overweight.\", \"Presidential physicals are \\u201conly as credible as the doctor delivering them, is what we\\u2019ve learned,\\u201d said Matthew Dallek, a political historian. \\u201cBiden appears to be much more straightforward than a lot of presidents and more transparent in the 10 months or so he\\u2019s been on the job, but because we don\\u2019t have access to all of the details, it\\u2019s very hard to rely completely on these reports.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden\\u2019s physical and colonoscopy took place at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.\", \"The White House released the specialties of the medical professionals who evaluated Mr. Biden, as a number of his predecessors have. Mr. Biden was treated by consultants who specialize in optometry, allergy treatment, dentistry, foot and ankle orthopedics, spine orthopedics, physical therapy, neurology, cardiology, radiology, dermatology, anesthesiology and gastroenterology, Dr. O\\u2019Conner said.\", \"A geriatrician was not among the medical specialists from 12 disciplines who participated in the president\\u2019s detailed health checkup on Friday. Geriatrics is the specialty that focuses on the elderly. Consultations with geriatricians are usually determined by a patient, or his or her primary care physician. There is no specific age at which geriatricians typically begin examining patients.\", \"Mr. Biden used Section 3 of the 25th Amendment to temporarily transfer power during his colonoscopy. Under that provision, the president was required to notify the president pro tempore of the Senate, Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi that he was temporarily unable to carry out his presidential duties. Those letters were transmitted to both at 10:10 a.m.\", \"Mr. Biden resumed his duties around 11:35 a.m. on Friday, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Twitter, adding that he was \\u201cin good spirits.\\u201d Three hours later, the president emerged from Walter Reed and told reporters that the procedure had gone well.\", \"\\u201cGood! We\\u2019re gonna release all the details. I feel great. Nothing\\u2019s changed. We\\u2019re in great shape,\\u201d Mr. Biden said, before returning to the White House to pardon a pair of turkeys. \\u201cAnd I\\u2019m looking forward to celebrating my 58th birthday.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"161663bc499a11ec92a581011532afb5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"161663bc499a11ec92a581011532afb5"}},
