Both had been delayed by the pandemic.\", \"With the cast of \\u201cCompany\\u201d standing onstage behind her at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, arms around one another\\u2019s shoulders, Elliott said that Sondheim\\u2019s death had been a shock to the production, whose members had gotten to know the composer and lyricist during the preparation for the revival. Even at 91 years old and with more than six decades of writing music and lyrics for Broadway behind him, Sondheim had taken an active role in the new run of the musical, which first premiered in 1970 and won six Tony Awards. The current production was a hit with critics when it debuted in London in 2019.\", \"\\u201cHe didn\\u2019t need to do that,\\u201d Elliott said. \\u201cBut he became the greatest enthusiast for it, and every single line of George Furth\\u2019s and every single lyric we talked about, we debated, we argued, we chatted, we laughed,\\u201d Elliott added, referring to the playwright.\", \"In this version, the central character, a bachelor with commitment issues, is played by a woman (Lenk). He had been supportive of the changes to the musical, Elliott said. \\u201cHe really understood about art,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand he really understood about the now and why art should speak to the now.\\u201d\", \"Right up until his death, Sondheim was both a fairly active writer and theatergoer. Earlier this month, Sondheim had traveled to Manhattan from his home in Connecticut to see these productions himself, attending the opening night of \\u201cAssassins\\u201d at the Classic Stage Company on Nov. 14 and a preview of \\u201cCompany\\u201d the next day. This week, Sondheim discussed his current project \\u2014 his final musical \\u2014 with The New York Times, saying, \\u201cWhat else would I do with my time but write?\\u201d\", \"Speaking to the audience at \\u201cAssassins,\\u201d Doyle urged the theatergoers to celebrate Sondheim\\u2019s work rather than grieve.\", \"\\u201cHe would be curious if you sat here sadly tonight,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI would ask you to sit back, to luxuriate in his extraordinary words and music.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a5da50fa4f4211ec98bcf5d3c31b522d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a5da50fa4f4211ec98bcf5d3c31b522d"}},
