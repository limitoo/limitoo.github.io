Barry, investigators say, told them he didn't know how the cap got there, but admitted he was an experienced tranquilizer dart gun shooter. The cap, however, had Suzanne DNA on it, not Barry's. Investigators also found a spy pen right out of a James Bond movie that was able to capture and record conversations. The pen captured several intimate conversations between Suzanne Morphew and a secret lover.

And this is a ridiculous explanation, so it must be the explanation of a guilty person.\\\"\", \"There was no evidence of any chipmunk shootings around Barry's house. Part of his problem, Aya says, is that Barry granted between 30 and 40 interviews \\u2014 all without a lawyer \\u2014 to everyone from a county detective to members of the FBI.\", \"Peter Van Sant: Would you have allowed him to do all these interviews?\", \"Aya Gruber: No. Absolutely not.\", \"Meanwhile, Jeff Libler was cleared.

What do authorities believe happened during that time? \", \"Ashley Franco: Authorities say that they believe, when his phone went into airplane mode, that he was disposing of possible evidence.\", \"Unable to track Barry's cell phone, investigators tapped into a relatively new investigative technique \\u2014 digital vehicle forensics \\u2014 to pull a stream of data out of Barry's Ford truck.

Investigators created a Berla report, meaning they tapped into the data in Barry's Ford truck to track its movements after his cell phone went into airplane mode.\\u00a0 \", \"Aya Gruber: \\u2026 a couple of the pieces of evidence that I think are very harmful to his case \\u2014 come from the data in the car \\u2026\", \"Ashley Franco: The prosecution's case is that Barry snapped at one point the day before Mother's Day.\", \"Authorities believe Barry killed Suzanne that afternoon. He told agents he went to bed around 8 p.m. that night, but the data pulled from the truck shows that the truck was put in reverse and moved some 96 feet closer to his house around 9:30 p.m.\", \"Ashley Franco: Investigators think that's when he could have loaded Suzanne's body.\", \"Initially, Barry told police that he set his alarm for 4:30 a.m. on Mother's Day and left the house by 5 a.m. to drive to a job site in Broomfield, a town near Denver, 150 miles from Salida. But the truck's computers show that someone was opening and closing the truck's doors around 3:30 a.m. \", \"Investigators believe Barry began driving toward Broomfield much earlier than he claimed, but there is a 4-hour window\\u2014approximately 4 a.m. to 8 a.m.\\u2014when no activity was recorded by the vehicle's computers.\\u00a0\", \"Aya Gruber: \\u2026 there are events in the car \\u2014 that aren't recorded. So, they can't give sort of a full chronological picture.\", \"And if Barry hid Suzanne's body during that 4-hour window, the truck's data does not provide answers. \", \"Peter Van Sant: Why is data missing sometimes?\", \"Ben Lemere: Well, it gets overwritten. You know, it is a computer \\u2026 Log files, they only last so long.\", \"But Barry helped fill in some of the missing data. He told agents he took a left upon leaving his home instead of a right because, even though it was dark, he remembered seeing some elk. \", \"Ashley Franco: He saw a herd of elk, and he's a hunter. So, he was interested, and he wanted to get an up-close look.\", \"That admission was significant to agents because it put him in an area where a key piece of evidence had been recovered. \", \"Ashley Franco: Investigators found Suzanne's bike helmet up that road. So, they believe, at that point when he turned left instead of turning right, that he could have been ditching her bike helmet.\", \"At 8:10 a.m. on Mother's Day morning, the truck's computers again begin recording data. And by then, Barry's cell phone had also come back to life. Agents are able to track Barry's cell and truck movements and can see that he first pulled over at a Broomfield bus stop where he discarded something in a garbage can.\\u00a0\", \"Ashley Franco: And then he moves on to a hotel trash can, a McDonald's trash can \\u2026 a dumpster \\u2026 in a Men's Wearhouse parking lot, and then back to the hotel, and dumps stuff in a dumpster there. Investigators believe that during these \\\"trash runs,\\\" he was disposing of evidence in different places within the Denver area.\", \"In a surveillance shot of Barry on one of those trash runs, investigators could not see what he was throwing away. It may have looked incriminating, but Barry claims it was just another day at the office. He told agents he was merely being cheap, not criminal.\", \"Peter Van Sant: And his claim, well, I just always have a lotta junk in \\u2014 in the vehicle. I don't like to pay to have it \\u2014 disposed at a landfill, I \\u2014 this is just what I do.\", \"Ashley Franco: But it's suspicious that you would go to five different trash areas to dispose of several things. Why not just do it at one?\", \"After checking out the work site, Barry headed back to his room at the Holiday Inn, and investigators say he stayed there from 12:42 p.m. to 6:03 p.m. By then, he'd already spoken to older daughter Mallory who told him she could not get in touch with her mother. \", \"That's when the Morphew neighbors were contacted and could find no sign of Suzanne. \", \"Dan Ridenour: Barry asked them at that time if the bike was there, to go check on her \\u2026 her bicycle is not here.\", \"Barry asks his neighbor to call 911.\", \"Dan Ridenour: And that's when the call to 911 \\u2026 was placed, that Suzanne is missing.\", \"Ashley Franco: Barry doesn't head home immediately, and he is dropping some tools off for his coworkers. \", \"Tools including a shovel. With Suzanne now officially reported missing, Barry tells his workers there's a family emergency and arranges hotel rooms with one of those workers taking over Barry's room. \", \"Ashley Franco: When the employee was interviewed, he told investigators that \\u2026 the room that Barry checked out of, it had a strong smell of chlorine or bleach.\", \"Peter Van Sant: Which suggests what?\", \"Ashley Franco: That he could be cleaning up a crime scene.\", \"Just after 6 p.m., Barry starts driving back to Salida. On the way, Barry speaks to sheriff deputies who advise him they've found Suzanne's bike and he arrives at that ravine at around 8:40 p.m. \\u00a0 \", \"Ashley Franco: And investigators say that when he arrived there, he was pretty emotional for a few minutes. \", \"By Sunday night, Suzanne's daughters were back home but Suzanne is nowhere to be found. Barry offered a $100,000 reward for information that was later doubled to $200,000.\", \"Investigators later discovered many texts from Suzanne to a close friend that apparently revealed her tormented feelings about Barry:\", \"\\\"He won't speak of divorce \\u2026\\\"\", \"\\\"I feel no peace when he's here \\u2026\\\"\", \"\\\"I wouldn't feel safe alone with him \\u2026\\\"\", \"Barry became the prime suspect and investigators think they know how he killed Suzanne.\\u00a0\", \"While investigators searched the Morphew home and the family's cars and trucks, Barry continued to talk, seemingly to anyone with a badge. Weeks and months went by and Barry remained at the center of the investigation.\\u00a0\", \"Aya\\u00a0Gruber: \\u2026 police are absolutely correct as a statistical matter to look at intimate partners \\u2026 when they suspect that a woman might've been harmed or murdered.\", \"Peter Van Sant: It's something like eight out of 10 times, when a spouse dies the other one's involved.\", \"Aya Gruber: Absolutely.\", \"Sometimes the smallest item will turn an investigation, and, in this case, agents seized on a clear plastic cap that a forensics team had found in the family's dryer.\\u00a0 \", \"Aya Gruber: And the cap was to a syringe that's used to fill a dart that you would use to tranquilize, say, animals.\", \"Peter Van Sant: How do prosecutors interpret that?\", \"Aya Gruber: The prosecution's theory is that at some point, when Barry came home on the 9th and snapped, and decided to murder Suzanne, he used a tranquilizer dart that you would use on animals \\u2026\", \"There was no working tranquilizer rifle found in the Morphew's home. But Barry told investigators he was an experienced tranquilizer dart gun shooter. He knew how to load darts with paralyzing chemicals, having used them to illegally sedate deer and remove their antlers to sell. \", \"We asked Dan Ridenour to read some of what Barry told investigators.\", \"Dan Ridenour [reading]: Barry said, \\\"The first thing I thought of when I came here and saw deer in my yard with big horns, I'm like, 'I'm getting them horns.'\\\" \", \"Dan Ridenour [reading]: \\\"And I'll tell you exactly what I did \\u2026 I shoot 'em.

Agents theorized that Barry's phone had pinged from various locations around the house\\u2014not because he was shooting chipmunks, but because he was chasing Suzanne after he shot her.\\u00a0\", \"Ashley Franco: Investigators find a doorframe within the Morphew home that has been broken. And they say that there could have been a chase and then a struggle.\", \"Andrew Katers, the owner and CEO of Animal Care and Equipment Services, showed us a tranquilizer rifle he'd typically use on animals. \", \"Peter Van Sant: And what are you holding?\", \"Andrew Katers: What I'm holding is a TeleDart model 706 rifle \\u2026 they use this a lot in parks throughout the country.\", \"Peter Van Sant: And this does not fire bullets or shot?\", \"Andrew Katers: It only fires darts. \\u2026 It's impossible to \\u2014 get it to do anything else.\", \"Peter Van Sant: Could you now demonstrate for me?\", \"Andrew Katers: Sure.
