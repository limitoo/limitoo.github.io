It is less than a 10-minute drive from the running and hiking trails at Mission Trail Park and about the same distance from the art galleries and restaurants on Ocean Avenue. Carmel Beach, popular with surfers and dog owners, is about a five-minute drive or a 15-minute walk.\", \"Size: 1,388 square feet\", \"Price per square foot: $1,981\", \"Indoors: A wood gate and lush hedges enclose a private courtyard facing the main entrance. An arched Dutch door opens into a living room with high ceilings, exposed beams, wood-paneled walls painted a soft cream and a fireplace surrounded by stone.\", \"The hardwood floors in the living room continue into an open dining and kitchen area with French doors facing the courtyard. The space is big enough to hold a small table and chairs, and the appliances include a cobalt-blue-and-stainless-steel range and a stainless-steel refrigerator.\", \"From the far side of the living room, a short corridor leads to the bedroom, which has high ceilings, another stone fireplace, a ladder up to a lofted storage area and a nook with enough space for a desk or an armchair. On either side of the room, French doors open to patios. The nearby bathroom is painted a sunny yellow and has a checkerboard-tile floor, a claw-foot tub and a shower with a glass door.\", \"The guest quarters over the garage include a bedroom big enough to hold a queen-size bed, a full bathroom and a covered porch reached by an outdoor staircase.\", \"Outdoor space: The main courtyard is paved with gravel and stone, with two focal points: a stone fountain and a circular hedge framing a flower bed. A brick patio at the side of the house is big enough for a cafe table and chairs. The detached garage holds one car.\", \"Taxes: $34,380 (estimated)\", \"Contact: The Canning Properties Group, Sotheby\\u2019s International Realty Carmel Rancho Brokerage, 831-624-1566; sothebysrealty.com\", \"This house is in Studio City, a few blocks north of Ventura Boulevard, the San Fernando Valley\\u2019s main drag. Development along Ventura has been brisk in the past few years: An outpost of the Erewhon Market chain recently opened a half-mile from this property; other nearby stores include a Ralph\\u2019s supermarket, a bowling alley and several sushi restaurants. Another nearby amenity is Weddington Golf & Tennis, a complex with a nine-hole golf course and a clubhouse. West Hollywood and downtown Los Angeles are less than a half-hour away.\", \"Size: 3,260 square feet\", \"Price per square foot: $857\", \"Indoors: An iron gate divides the front yard from the sidewalk, with a brick path leading to the front door. Across the threshold is a living room with hardwood floors, a wood-burning fireplace, a bay of windows overlooking the front yard and double doors that open to one of several patios.\", \"Behind the living room is a sunny hallway leading to a dining room with hardwood floors, a white-painted beamed ceiling and glass doors that open to another patio. The facing kitchen has custom wood cabinets, glossy stone counters, a Sub-Zero refrigerator and a Wolf range. On the other side of the kitchen is a family room with a new built-in entertainment center and access to a patio.\", \"There are three bedrooms on this level. Two are off the hallway connected to the living room: On one side is the primary suite, which has an airy sitting room with a view of the swimming pool and a recently updated bathroom with a marble-tiled shower; across the hall is a guest room with built-in cabinetry. Another guest room is off the family room, with a walk-in closet and backyard access; next door is a bathroom with a large shower and a marble-topped vanity.\", \"From the center hall, stairs lead to the upper level, which currently functions as a bedroom with an en suite bathroom, but could be used as a home office.\", \"Outdoor space: The outdoor spaces are configured to allow for privacy, with one brick patio off the living room and another, larger patio off the dining room; the first has a fountain, and the second functions as an outdoor dining room. A lawn connects the dining terrace and the pool area, which has a cabana with room for several lounge chairs. The attached garage has two parking spots.\", \"Taxes: $34,932 (estimated)\", \"Contact: Thomas Davila, Robert Vitela and Kennon Earl, RARE Properties, Inc., Compass, 424-230-7928; compass.com\", \"Real estate in Sunnyvale, the second-largest city in Santa Clara County (after San Jose), is prized by tech workers, as it allows them to avoid Bay Area traffic. The headquarters of Google and Apple are less than 20 minutes from this property, along surface streets, and many other tech and aerospace companies have offices nearby. This house is on a cul-de-sac, within walking distance of an elementary school, a middle school and a high school, all public and well ranked. Rancho San Antonio County Park, which has more than 20 miles of hiking trails and a working farm with cows, chickens and pigs, is 10 minutes away by car.\", \"Size: 2,086 square feet\", \"Price per square foot: $1,341\", \"Indoors: The house is set back from the street, facing a yard landscaped with drought-tolerant plants.\", \"The front door opens into a foyer that flows into a living room with a white-painted brick fireplace and a wide window facing the street. Beyond the living room is an open dining area with access to a bright, spacious kitchen that has backyard-facing windows and plenty of room for a breakfast table.\", \"Off the kitchen is a hallway that leads to a bedroom suite with direct backyard access and a full bathroom. A laundry room and powder room, as well as an entrance to the garage, are also on this side of the house.\", \"The other three bedrooms are upstairs. The primary suite is at the end of the hall, with enough space for a king-size bed; the en suite bathroom has a shower with a frosted-glass door and a white vanity with black accent hardware. Closer to the stairs are two guest rooms, both large enough to hold a queen-size bed; between them is a bathroom with a combination tub and shower.\", \"Outdoor space: From the kitchen, sliding-glass doors open to a covered patio, paved with brick accents. From there, paved paths traverse the backyard, with one stopping at a bench and lamppost at the far corner of the lot. Mature trees, including one that produces oranges, line the perimeter of the yard. The attached garage holds two cars.\", \"Taxes: $34,980 (estimated)\", \"Contact: Stefan Walker, KW Bay Area Estates, 408-209-6100; stefanwalker.com\"]","href_hash":"3ac5e1ce5c1e11ecbc0d95cffe4d3ded"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3ac5e1ce5c1e11ecbc0d95cffe4d3ded"}},
