Crumbley allegedly conducted the shooting using a gun purchased by his parents Jennifer and James Crumbley.\", \"Crumbley's parents are now facing involuntary manslaughter charges, accused of allowing their son to access the gun used in the shooting.

However, just 7 percent of Republicans and 27 percent of independents felt the same way.\", \"Conversely, 34 percent of Republicans said it's more important to protect the right of people to own guns than it is to protect people from gun violence. When asked the same question, only 5 percent of Democrats and 21 percent of independents agreed.\", \"In another vast difference of opinion, 80 percent of Democrats said they'd favor making gun laws more strict, but only 23 percent of Republicans and 43 percent of independents agreed.\", \"The poll was conducted by YouGov, a British market research and data analytics firm, and The Economist, an international weekly newspaper focused on business and international politics. The poll had a plus or minus 3 percent margin of error.\", \"It's actually quite rare for parents to face criminal charges when their children commit crimes using their firearms.\", \"Only 23 states and Washington, D.C., have laws requiring gun owners to lock their guns away, out of the reach of children. Michigan doesn't have such a law, but the state has a law making it illegal for children to own guns. The Crumbleys said they had purchased the gun used in the shooting as a Christmas gift for their son.\", \"About 76 percent of the firearms used in school shootings came from the homes of parents or close relatives, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a 2019 assessment reported by NPR.\", \"The reason that parents rarely face charges is because the laws aimed at preventing children from accessing guns aren't always enforced by local prosecutors, legal experts told NPR.\"]","href_hash":"d02d7f2e596c11ecb2d093938877b8ab"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d02d7f2e596c11ecb2d093938877b8ab"}},
