Only one remake has ever been awarded best picture: Martin Scorsese\\u2019s \\u201cThe Departed\\u201d (2006), adapted from the Hong Kong crime thriller \\u201cInfernal Affairs\\u201d \\u2014 and no remake of a previous best-picture winner has even so much as been nominated in that Oscar category. (Cast members have said this isn\\u2019t a remake but simply a new adaptation of the stage musical; moviegoers will still consider it a remake.)\", \"But now, after a rapturously received premiere in New York City this week and a strong burst of initial reviews, I\\u2019ve come to think that \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d can manage what was formerly impossible. Here are three reasons.\", \"After the low-budget drama \\u201cNomadland\\u201d swept last season\\u2019s muted Oscar ceremony, I think voters will be eager to crown a more traditional crowd-pleaser. While films like \\u201cBelfast\\u201d and \\u201cKing Richard\\u201d certainly fit that bill, they can\\u2019t hold a candle to the scale and grandeur of \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d: Simply put, this is the biggest contender that could actually win \\u2014 sorry, \\u201cDune\\u201d \\u2014 and its very presence fills a power vacuum that had been lingering at the top of this race.\", \"Spielberg has always exhibited a sense of musical timing in the way he blocks and stages action movies, but the 74-year-old has never tackled a feature-length song-and-dance film until now, and the results are impressive: Choreographed by Justin Peck and edited by Michael Kahn and Sarah Broshar, this \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d marries old-school sweep to a new script by Tony Kushner that further contextualizes the story\\u2019s themes of gentrification and racial strife.\", \"This time, the dance battles between the gangs \\u2014 the white Jets and Puerto Rican Sharks \\u2014 bring violence out of the realm of the hypothetical, adding even more bloody stakes to the Romeo-and-Juliet romance of Tony (Ansel Elgort) and Mar\\u00eda (Rachel Zegler), who hail from rival factions. And unlike the original film, which put several white actors in brownface, this take on \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d has more authentic casting and even allows Mar\\u00eda and the Jets to often converse in unsubtitled Spanish, a daring choice that works because the themes are so evident.\", \"It\\u2019s the best kind of remake, something that feels classic and refreshed at the same time. And it can\\u2019t be underestimated just how good it feels to watch something so significant on the big screen. (Upon leaving my press screening, I heard one critic exult, \\u201cThat is a movie!\\u201d)\", \"The 1961 version of \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d picked up both of the supporting Oscars \\u2014 in addition to Moreno, George Chakiris won for his performance as the Sharks leader Bernardo \\u2014 and lead Natalie Wood would have almost certainly been in contention if it weren\\u2019t for her best-actress nomination that same year for \\u201cSplendor in the Grass,\\u201d as well as an Oscar rule that prohibits an actor from showing up twice in the same category.\", \"Spielberg\\u2019s version should be in the hunt for even more acting nominations than its predecessor. Rachel Zegler as Maria is an appealing newcomer and lovely singer, and Oscar voters love to push a fresh-faced ing\\u00e9nue into the best-actress race. In the supporting categories, Mike Faist as the Jets leader Riff makes a strong, flinty-eyed impression, while the Broadway veteran (and \\u201cSo You Think You Can Dance\\u201d alum) Ariana DeBose gets tons of showy material as Anita, including a new version of \\u201cAmerica\\u201d staged in the streets that stands out as the movie\\u2019s centerpiece number.\", \"But though DeBose is playing the role that won Moreno the Oscar in the original film, I still think it\\u2019s Moreno\\u2019s new performance that could trump all comers in the supporting-actress category. Here, she plays Valentina, a kindly widow who advises Tony while he stocks shelves at her pharmacy. She wants only the best for her young charge and works desperately to keep him on the straight and narrow, so when things start to go haywire, it has double the impact because you know how devastated Valentina will be.\", \"Moreno is moving in the role, which is based on the drugstore owner Doc from the original film but radically reconceived and expanded by Spielberg and Kushner. (She even gets to sing \\u201cSomewhere,\\u201d a romantic duet now repurposed as a tear-jerking solo lament.) The still sprightly Moreno will celebrate her 90th birthday later this month, and an Academy Award nod would make her Oscar\\u2019s oldest nominee ever. Can you imagine how the room would leap to its feet if she won? Voters will surely envision it.\", \"Robert Wise\\u2019s \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d scored 11 Oscar nominations and won all but one of those trophies, a haul exceeded only by \\u201cBen-Hur,\\u201d \\u201cThe Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King\\u201d and \\u201cTitanic.\\u201d I\\u2019m not sure Spielberg\\u2019s version can win as many Oscars, but the upside is there for it to receive as many or more nominations, which will almost certainly make the film this year\\u2019s nomination leader.\", \"Nods in the picture and director categories are all but certain, and if Zegler, Faist, DeBose and Moreno all get in, that\\u2019s six nominations before we even get into the below-the-line categories. There, expect recognition for Kushner\\u2019s adapted screenplay, the cinematography from Spielberg vet Janusz Kaminski, the large-scale production design and period costumes, and the film\\u2019s editing and sound.\", \"That\\u2019s 12 potential nominations, one more the original film got and more than \\u201cDune\\u201d will probably manage unless the sci-fi film wildly overperforms. Becoming the nomination leader doesn\\u2019t always guarantee wins \\u2014 just recently, Spielberg\\u2019s \\u201cLincoln\\u201d managed 12 nominations but won in only two categories \\u2014 but in an unusually diffuse Oscar year, it gives \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d the most heft.\", \"Still, this awards season will be long (the ceremony isn\\u2019t until the end of March) and the implosion of the Golden Globes deprives \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d of some easy televised wins in the musical-comedy categories along the way. There are also some simmering controversies that could boil over soon: Elgort was accused of sexual assault in 2020 (a charge he denies) and some cultural pundits are leery of reviving \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d at all, arguing that the story furthers racial stereotypes.\", \"The film will also face an uphill battle at the box office, where older audiences are still hesitant to return to theaters and musicals rarely muster a strong opening weekend. (A miscalculated poster campaign, which sells desaturated grit instead of romance and entertainment, will hardly help matters.) And when it comes to Oscar voting, some academy members will always resist the idea of awarding a remake, which may help more original films (like the end-of-the-world satire \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up\\u201d) mount a counteroffensive.\", \"Still, I expect voters will find a lot to love in \\u201cWest Side Story.\\u201d It\\u2019s hard to compete not just with the 1961 original but the very idea of that film, but Spielberg manages to pull off the magic trick. Like the swooning dreamer Tony, when I look out over the awards season to come, I can\\u2019t help but feel that something\\u2019s coming. Something good.\"]","href_hash":"7dbfd047545f11ecac8da35f2dd33c53"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7dbfd047545f11ecac8da35f2dd33c53"}},
