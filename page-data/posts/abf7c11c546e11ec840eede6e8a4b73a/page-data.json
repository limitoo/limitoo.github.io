The font appears in all of the club\\u2019s marketing campaigns. It is deployed on all its social media pronouncements. It adorns the Juventus offices in Turin and Milan.\", \"Using the font is important to Juventus executives: uniformity of iconography, they believe, is crucial in helping build the club\\u2019s brand, in expressing to current fans and prospective ones and, where none can be found, putative customers, quite what Juventus stands for. Everything the club publishes has to have that distinctive, recognizable Juventus look. Image comes first.\", \"All of which makes the events of the last few months \\u2014 perhaps longer \\u2014 difficult to understand. First, there is the ongoing and now faintly masochistic devotion of Andrea Agnelli, the club\\u2019s president, to a Super League project that has not only cost him friendships and positions of power, but that has been met with pretty much universal opprobrium from fans. Continued commitment to it is not, as they say, a good look.\", \"And then, more serious still, there is the investigation by Italy\\u2019s financial authorities into six current and former executives \\u2014 including Agnelli and Pavel Nedved, the club\\u2019s vice president \\u2014 into Juventus\\u2019s transfer dealings. The authorities are said to be considering various charges of false accounting and reporting. The police have already raided the club\\u2019s training facility and its offices. That is not great for the image, either.\", \"It would be easy, then, to see more than a little hubris in Juventus\\u2019s on-field travails this season. There is a scene in the first episode of the club\\u2019s edition of the \\u201cAll Or Nothing\\u201d documentary series \\u2014 which started airing on Amazon Prime late last month, and over which the team\\u2019s executives hung like hawks, every step of the way \\u2014 in which Agnelli gathers the members of the playing squad and lets them know, in no uncertain terms, the expectations.\", \"With an expletive or two thrown in, he tells the players that the previous season was not up to scratch. The year in question was the one before last, the one in which Maurizio Sarri led Juventus to a ninth straight Serie A title. The coach, an unlikely appointment who turned into an unpopular incumbent, had gone; Agnelli would not, he said, tolerate a repeat.\", \"In comparison, of course, that year under Sarri would come to be seen as the last chapter of the golden era. Under his replacement, the novice Andrea Pirlo, Juventus barely scraped into the Champions League \\u2014 relying on Napoli\\u2019s stumbling at home on the final day to make it \\u2014 and then, over the course of the summer, discovered that Cristiano Ronaldo, the player it had brought in to turn domestic hegemony into continental success, no longer wanted to stick around.\", \"If that seemed like the nadir, it was not. After the failed experiments with Sarri and Pirlo, Juventus restored Massimiliano Allegri as coach this summer. His task was to prioritize \\u201cresults,\\u201d as he has put it, over the pursuit of style that had captivated the club when it decided, a couple of years ago, that it had outgrown Sarri. Juventus had realized, it seemed, that the fact of winning was more central to its identity than the nature of it.\", \"Things are not, though, quite so simple. Allegri\\u2019s team has lost five games in Serie A already this season. Relative minnows, like Sassuolo, and actual minnows, like Empoli, have returned from Juventus\\u2019s Allianz Stadium with victories. Last weekend, Atalanta won in Turin for the first time in more than 30 years.\", \"Juventus sits seventh in Serie A, 12 points behind Napoli, the early leader. Allegri has already stated his belief that finishing fourth, and securing yet another season in the Champions League, may be the limit of this team\\u2019s ambitions. Even that relatively meager target is by no means guaranteed.\", \"The cause of that decline can be traced to the same root as the demise in Juventus\\u2019s image. There is a tendency, in soccer, to believe nobody is capable of doing two things at once: A player taking an interest in off-field activities \\u2014 whether that is being on TikTok, running a fashion label, feeding hungry children \\u2014 will, at some point, invariably be told to concentrate on their performances; a club that takes care of its brand identity will be told to focus, instead, on signing players.\", \"It is a false dichotomy, of course. Players can run a business, campaign or social media account and still remember how to mark opponents on corners. Clubs employ hundreds of people, not all of whom are devoted to tactics, nutrition or being a right back.\", \"Where the two threads of Juventus\\u2019s struggles entwine is in the rationale behind them. Agnelli favors a Super League because it solves his club\\u2019s immediate financial problems. The plusvalenza system that the team\\u2019s executives are accused of manipulating offers the same, short-term hit: It makes sure this year\\u2019s books look good, with little or no thought to what happens later.\", \"That is precisely how Juventus has been run, too. In 2017, after a second defeat in the Champions League final in three years, Agnelli became obsessed with winning instantly. The painstaking, intelligent work that had returned the club to the pinnacle in both Italy and Europe was out; signing players to triumph immediately became the order of the day. A year later, the approach reached its apogee when Ronaldo arrived in Turin.\", \"Now Juventus is paying for that impatience. Ronaldo may be gone, but there are countless others \\u2014 all on hefty contracts, all eating up the club\\u2019s pandemic-ravaged finances, all too costly to be easily offloaded \\u2014 who remain: Aaron Ramsey and Alex Sandro and Adrien Rabiot.\", \"Allegri has at his disposal the sketch outline of a young, competitive team: Matthijs de Ligt, Rodrigo Bentancur, Manuel Locatelli, Dejan Kulusevski and Federico Chiesa. The club\\u2019s decision to establish an under-23 team in Italy\\u2019s third tier was made with the future in mind, too.\", \"But none of it can come to fruition while the squad, and the balance sheet, is filled by the underperforming and the overpaid. Juventus has thought for too long about the now, and too little about what comes next. And it is that, ultimately, which will do the damage to its image, to how it is perceived, and how it perceives itself. What matters, after all, is the story a club tells, not how it is written.\", \"There have been years when it has felt at least a little like either Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo won the Ballon d\\u2019Or by default, that they were awarded the most prestigious individual prize in soccer not so much for what they had achieved recently but because it seemed inconceivable to suggest one of the two of them was not the finest player in the world.\", \"This year was not one of them. Of course, Robert Lewandowski offered a compelling alternative case. Even discounting the emotional appeal of honoring a player who so richly deserved the award 12 months ago, Lewandowski, the Bayern Munich striker, had done enough \\u2014 more than enough \\u2014 to win it based on his 2021 alone. It is not every season, after all, that a player breaks a 50-year-old goal-scoring record.\", \"But it hardly requires some great suspension of disbelief to understand why, eventually, France Football\\u2019s jurors chose Messi: It was this year, after all, that he finally ended his \\u2014 and his country\\u2019s \\u2014 long wait for an international trophy. The Copa Am\\u00e9rica was Argentina\\u2019s first senior triumph since 1993. Delivering international glory was the one hole on Messi\\u2019s r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9. Now he has filled it. That was, as it should have been, enough.\", \"The complication is that Messi won his seventh Ballon d\\u2019Or as his domestic form is \\u2014 how to put this delicately? \\u2014 stuttering. His final season at Barcelona brought 38 goals in 47 games, even in a bitterly disappointing campaign, but he has struggled to find that form at Paris St.-Germain.\", \"He has three goals in the Champions League \\u2014 including a wonderful strike against Manchester City \\u2014 but only one in Ligue 1. A delayed start to the season, a couple of interruptions from minor injuries and being part of a somewhat inchoate team have not helped, but he has certainly not found France\\u2019s top flight as easy as anticipated.\", \"That will change, obviously, as P.S.G. hits its stride and as Messi adapts to a league he has acknowledged is more physical to the one to which he was accustomed. He recorded three assists against Saint-Etienne last weekend.\", \"But for now it serves as a reminder, perhaps, that Ligue 1 \\u2014 widely derided as the weakest of Europe\\u2019s major domestic tournaments \\u2014 is not quite the cakewalk many believe it to be, that any player at all can find a new environment challenging, and that nothing is easy, not really, even for the greats.\", \"It is hard to tell which is the more startling statistic: that England scored 20 goals \\u2014 20, two zero \\u2014 in a single game on Tuesday, or that in the process, Sarina Wiegman\\u2019s team racked up 64 shots. That works out, math fans, to roughly one every 90 seconds.\", \"The victory, in a World Cup qualifier against Latvia, ranks as the biggest-ever win by an England team. It also represented a European record for a competitive women\\u2019s game, though there should be just a small asterisk there: the previous mark was set only a few days earlier, when Belgium beat Armenia, 19-0.\", \"The issue of what to do with overmatched teams is not exclusive to the women\\u2019s game, of course \\u2014 the debate flares up pretty reliably in men\\u2019s qualifying, too \\u2014 but, because of the rapid development of the game across Europe, the scale of the imbalance and the urgency with which it must be addressed feel much greater.\", \"It is, certainly, no time to indulge the two nonsensical orthodoxies that infect this debate in the men\\u2019s game: that playing the very best helps the smaller nations to improve \\u2014 even Wiegman quite rightly dispatched that idea \\u2014 and that changing the format of qualifying, in some way, prevents everyone from having an even chance to reach a tournament.\", \"A two- or even three-tier qualifying system for major competitions exists in North America, Africa and Asia. It does not exist in South America, but only because the likes of Suriname and French Guiana compete (for reasons that are not strictly geographical) in Concacaf. There is absolutely no reason Europe could not do the same.\", \"As Wiegman said, Latvia learned nothing from losing, 20-0, to England, in a game in which it had 14 percent possession and no shots on goal. England, likewise, learned nothing. Streamlining qualification is not a mark of disrespect to developing nations. It is not depriving them of a chance to get better. If anything, the exact opposite is true.\", \"To be honest, I could just copy and paste Nitin Bajaj\\u2019s email and leave it there for correspondence this week: \\u201cI read the bit on managers\\u2019 captivation with condiments with a great deal of \\u2026 er \\u2026 relish,\\u201d he wrote, clearly very pleased with himself.\", \"Gary Brown, meanwhile, thinks there is some sort of ketchup-based conspiracy at play. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s the evidence that Dean Smith had ever allowed ketchup at Villa before his sacking?\\u201d he asked. \\u201cSteven Gerrard announced that he\\u2019d banned it before he\\u2019d even seen it on the table at his new club. On the other hand, a suspicious mind might follow Dean Smith to his quick appointment at Norwich, whose majority owner is Delia Smith, cookery writer and TV legend, who is on record as saying she and her husband have \\u2018Big Mac picnics in the car-park\\u2019 at evening games, with fries and loads of ketchup\\u2019.\\u201d\", \"A clutch of you, meanwhile \\u2014 James Patch, Martin Maudal and Jim Yoder \\u2014 all got in touch to suggest the perfect example of how much difference a manager can make: Thomas Tuchel at Chelsea. This is absolutely correct, of course, but once again: I cannot produce a newsletter that just runs to four words.\", \"And Thabo Caves sends an email that leads me to another thought. \\u201cA team has 11 players on the pitch most of the time,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cIf one player has roughly the same impact as another, then each player would have roughly a 9 percent influence on their team\\u2019s performance. Bringing in a new manager could then be considered as almost as influential as signing a new player in the middle of the season. Single players are consistently lauded for having transformative effects on teams, so why can\\u2019t a manager?\\u201d\", \"Why not indeed, Thabo, which leaves me to wonder: Should we not limit when teams can change their managers \\u2014 perhaps to two windows, one before and one during the season \\u2014 as we do with players? Why the reason for the difference?\"]","href_hash":"abf7c11c546e11ec840eede6e8a4b73a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"abf7c11c546e11ec840eede6e8a4b73a"}},
