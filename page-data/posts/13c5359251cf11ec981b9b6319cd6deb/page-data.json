a record fourth year running.\", \"Kleier spends his days working on the family property, Luxor, 40 kilometres west of Clermont, but is eager to pack his bags and head to the US for another crack at the big time when travel restrictions ease.\", \"The 23-year-old jetted stateside in\\u00a0early 2020 but was forced to return as the pandemic brought a halt to the Professional Bull Riders (PBR) tour.\", \"\\\"I really want to get back overseas \\u2014\\u00a0it's where the world's best bull riders are,\\\" Kleier said.\", \"\\\"Due to COVID, I came home and in the last two years I've been at home here, poking along with it.\", \"\\\"I'm waiting to see how it all pans out [with travel restrictions easing].\\\"\", \"Bull riding is big business in the US \\u2014\\u00a0Brazilian rider Jose Vitor Leme claimed his second straight PBR World Championship in Las Vegas earlier in the month and pocketed a cool US$1.871million (AU$2.618 million) in prize money for his efforts.\", \"<img

leg-slapping, energy drink-imbibing\\u00a0routine on hold for a few months.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0060d4d33f6b15d677fd9c9bffce9d62\\\"

pre-ride ritual that has worked wonders for the St Brendan's College graduate, who rose\\u00a0to the top of the PBR Australia charts in 2018 and has remained there ever since.\", \"\\\"I try and do the same thing on rodeo days,\\\" Kleier said.\", \"\\\"I've got a certain time I like to eat, I get the same energy drink every single time, even the same pair of riding jeans.\", \"\\\"Even down to how I get on \\u2014 I slap each leg twice just as I'm about to crawl down into the bucking chute and I have a little routine that I do every single time I get on.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Record-breaking run</div>\", \"Kleier secured his fourth consecutive PBR Australia title and pocketed $25,000 after outgunning 21 of the country's best riders at the 2021 PBR Australia Grand Finals in Townsville on the weekend.\", \"It's no mean feat \\u2014 only Kyogle rider David Kennedy has won four titles: in 2009, 2010, 2012 and 2014.\", \"\\\"It probably won't all sink in until I'm finished and I look back on what I've achieved,\\\" Kleier said.\", \"St Brendan's College deputy principal Matt Couper remembered Kleier as a highly respected member of the college's rodeo team.\", \"\\\"It's a great achievement for Aaron,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"It's a testament to a lot of the work that he's done through his senior years at school and since he's graduated.\", \"\\\"The college is very proud of what Aaron has been able to achieve and really happy for his family.\\\"\", \"Kleier is quick to admit it's a family affair, with his dad Darryl offering advice and his brother Travis supplying bucking bulls to the PBR.\", \"Kleier appreciates\\u00a0what his brother does, because bull riding is a team effort \\u2014 a quality bull and an even better cowboy lead to rodeo-winning rides.\", \"\\\"He doesn't really give me any tips, but I suppose I don't really look for tips either,\\\" Kleier said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Traditional approach to success</div>\", \"While many professional athletes are renowned for their high intensity gym workouts and high-tech video analyses to prepare for events, Kleier takes a more organic approach.\", \"He prefers\\u00a0to keep in shape by spending his days working on the family property and, while he watches his rides back on his phone, he doesn't like to do his homework before facing a bull.\", \"\\\"I don't look at the draw or anything until I rock up at the rodeo,\\\" Kleier said.\", \"\\\"I want my body to react.\", \"\\\"I've trained my body since I was young to react to riding balls and just do it automatically, because it happens too quickly that you can't be thinking about it.\"]","href_hash":"13c5359251cf11ec981b9b6319cd6deb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"13c5359251cf11ec981b9b6319cd6deb"}},
