The state and tribe argued that people could wager anywhere in the state because their bets are processed on computer servers located on tribal lands, the Associated Press reported.\", \"Friedrich called that a \\\"fiction,\\\" in her ruling, saying, \\\"When a federal statute authorizes an activity only at specific locations, parties may not evade that limitation by 'deeming' their activity to occur where it, as a factual matter, does not.\\\"\", \"Friedrich also added that gambling outside of tribal lands must be put to a vote, according to a 2018 state constitutional amendment.\", \"The tribe is restricted from adding roulette and craps to their Florida casinos under the decision, as well. This could have allowed non-Indian casinos to follow suit.\", \"Florida was the most recent state to legalize sports gambling after a 2018 Supreme Court ruling. The ruling lifted bans on sports betting outside Nevada and other states. Bets originally started being taken Nov. 1 on the Hard Rock Sportsbook mobile app before Friedrich's decision, Local10.com reported.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939131/seminole-tribe-florida-sports-betting-appeal.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Seminole Tribe of Florida is attempting to appeal a decision by a federal judge to block a 30-year agreement between the tribe and Florida to allow sports betting in the state.

Miami billionaire Norman Braman, who has led a years-long battle against expanded gambling in Florida, called the decision a \\\"big win for our community and our state.\\\"\", \"He said the deal's ultimate goal wasn't just to allow sports wagering, but to allow casinos to open in Miami Beach, downtown Miami, Trump's golf resort near Miami and elsewhere throughout the state. He said that would harm the state's quality of life, increase crime and turn some of its cities into another Las Vegas.\", \"\\\"This is not what the state of Florida is,\\\" Braman said. \\\"We are growing here. People are coming here to our state and our community. We are developing a high-tech industry here.
