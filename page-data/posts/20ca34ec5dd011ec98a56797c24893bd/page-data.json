Consequently, while only 43 percent of product is halal certified, over 90 percent of animals are processed in the halal manner.\", \"\\\"Without sufficient labour, companies cannot run their processing plants at full capacity.\\\"\", \"Farmers are already facing delays in getting stock to the works due to a lack of staff.\", \"\\\"We need the government to understand our specific needs and work with us on practical and sustainable solutions.\", \"\\\"The ad hoc nature of the government immigration re-set policies is not doing anything more than kicking the issue down the road,\\\" Karapeeva said.\", \"Agriculture Minister Damien O'Connor said he was aware there were only 11 positions vacant for halal workers at the moment and at this stage there wasn't the capacity to provide the industry with extra visas as a \\\"backup\\\" measure.\", \"O'Connor said it would continue to work with the industry on this.\", \"\\\"Everyone wants to have more people across every sector of the New Zealand economy at the moment,\\\" he said. \\\"It's a challenge in Covid times.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"20ca34ec5dd011ec98a56797c24893bd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"20ca34ec5dd011ec98a56797c24893bd"}},
