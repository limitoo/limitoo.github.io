Hasan Siber, an olive oil expert whose family is native to the Greek-speaking southern part of the island, wanted to show the world the quality of Cypriot olive oil and to \\u201cbridge the divide in Cyprus,\\u201d as he said in an email. He brings the handpicked olives from the harvest in the north across to the south where they are cold-pressed within 24 hours with olives from the south. The greenish-gold oil \\u2014 mostly from Kypriaki olives, an indigenous variety, with some koroneiki and arbequina \\u2014 has a grassy aroma and warm richness finishing with a touch of bitterness. It complies with the international regulations for extra virgin and is now available in the United States. The company is donating 10 percent of profits from each bottle to organizations promoting peace and education.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.
