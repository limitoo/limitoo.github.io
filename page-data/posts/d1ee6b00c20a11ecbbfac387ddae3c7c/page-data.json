There is already a lot of mahi across government under way that is consistent with UNDRIP, but having a plan sets a roadmap of actions to steadily work towards and measure progress against,\\\" Jackson said.\", \"\\\"As stated previously, He Puapua is not the Declaration Plan, nor is it government policy.
