Increasingly, they have pointed a finger at the algorithms powering sites like Facebook and Twitter, the software that decides what content users will see and when they see it.\", \"Some lawmakers from both parties argue that when social media sites boost the performance of hateful or violent posts, the sites become accomplices. And they have proposed bills to strip the companies of a legal shield that allows them to fend off lawsuits over most content posted by their users, in cases when the platform amplified a harmful post\\u2019s reach.\", \"The House Energy and Commerce Committee will hold a hearing Wednesday to discuss several of the proposals. The hearing will also include testimony from Frances Haugen, the former Facebook employee who recently leaked a trove of revealing internal documents from the company.\", \"Removing the legal shield, known as Section 230, would mean a sea change for the internet, because it has long enabled the vast scale of social media websites. Ms. Haugen has said she supports changing Section 230, which is a part of the Communications Decency Act, so that it no longer covers certain decisions made by algorithms at tech platforms.\", \"But what, exactly, counts as algorithmic amplification? And what, exactly, is the definition of harmful? The proposals offer far different answers to these crucial questions. And how they answer them may determine whether the courts find the bills constitutional.\", \"Here is how the bills address these thorny issues:\", \"Algorithms are everywhere. At its most basic, an algorithm is a set of instructions telling a computer how to do something. If a platform could be sued anytime an algorithm did anything to a post, products that lawmakers aren\\u2019t trying to regulate might be ensnared.\", \"Some of the proposed laws define the behavior they want to regulate in general terms. A bill sponsored by Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota, would expose a platform to lawsuits if it \\u201cpromotes\\u201d the reach of public health misinformation.\", \"Ms. Klobuchar\\u2019s bill on health misinformation would give platforms a pass if their algorithm promoted content in a \\u201cneutral\\u201d way. That could mean, for example, that a platform that ranked posts in chronological order wouldn\\u2019t have to worry about the law.\", \"Other legislation is more specific. A bill from Representatives Anna G. Eshoo of California and Tom Malinowski of New Jersey, both Democrats, defines dangerous amplification as doing anything to \\u201crank, order, promote, recommend, amplify or similarly alter the delivery or display of information.\\u201d\", \"Another bill written by House Democrats specifies that platforms could be sued only when the amplification in question was driven by a user\\u2019s personal data.\", \"\\u201cThese platforms are not passive bystanders \\u2014 they are knowingly choosing profits over people, and our country is paying the price,\\u201d Representative Frank Pallone Jr., the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, said in a statement when he announced the legislation.\", \"Mr. Pallone\\u2019s new bill includes an exemption for any business with five million or fewer monthly users. It also excludes posts that show up when a user searches for something, even if an algorithm ranks them, and web hosting and other companies that make up the backbone of the internet.\", \"Lawmakers and others have pointed to a wide array of content they consider to be linked to real-world harm. There are conspiracy theories, which could lead some adherents to turn violent. Posts from terrorist groups could push someone to commit an attack, as one man\\u2019s relatives argued when they sued Facebook after a member of Hamas fatally stabbed him. Other policymakers have expressed concerns about targeted ads that lead to housing discrimination.\", \"Most of the bills currently in Congress address specific types of content. Ms. Klobuchar\\u2019s bill covers \\u201chealth misinformation.\\u201d But the proposal leaves it up to the Department of Health and Human Services to determine what, exactly, that means.\", \"\\u201cThe coronavirus pandemic has shown us how lethal misinformation can be and it is our responsibility to take action,\\u201d Ms. Klobuchar said when she announced the proposal, which was co-written by Senator Ben Ray Luj\\u00e1n, a New Mexico Democrat.\", \"The legislation proposed by Ms. Eshoo and Mr. Malinowski takes a different approach. It applies only to the amplification of posts that violate three laws \\u2014 two that prohibit civil rights violations and a third that prosecutes international terrorism.\", \"Mr. Pallone\\u2019s bill is the newest of the bunch and applies to any post that \\u201cmaterially contributed to a physical or severe emotional injury to any person.\\u201d This is a high legal standard: Emotional distress would have to be accompanied by physical symptoms. But it could cover, for example, a teenager who views posts on Instagram that diminish her self-worth so much that she tries to hurt herself.\", \"Judges have been skeptical of the idea that platforms should lose their legal immunity when they amplify the reach of content.\", \"In the case involving an attack for which Hamas claimed responsibility, most of the judges who heard the case agreed with Facebook that its algorithms didn\\u2019t cost it the protection of the legal shield for user-generated content.\", \"If Congress creates an exemption to the legal shield \\u2014 and it stands up to legal scrutiny \\u2014 courts may have to follow its lead.\", \"But if the bills become law, they are likely to attract significant questions about whether they violate the First Amendment\\u2019s free-speech protections.\", \"Courts have ruled that the government can\\u2019t make benefits to an individual or a company contingent on the restriction of speech that the Constitution would otherwise protect. So the tech industry or its allies could challenge the law with the argument that Congress was finding a backdoor method of limiting free expression.\", \"\\u201cThe issue becomes: Can the government directly ban algorithmic amplification?\\u201d said Jeff Kosseff, an associate professor of cybersecurity law at the United States Naval Academy. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be hard, especially if you\\u2019re trying to say you can\\u2019t amplify certain types of speech.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"71699d9c529111ec81de372dbf136874"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"71699d9c529111ec81de372dbf136874"}},
