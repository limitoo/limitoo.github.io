The jury requested the video in both regular and slow motion.\", \"\\\"Their focus is rightly on the video evidence that can be replayed and compared to the instructions,\\\" McAuliffe said. \\\"Remember, the jurors didn't have the full instructions when they initially saw the videos during the trial.

Rittenhouse is also charged with wounding Grosskreutz.\", \"The jury asked for four pieces of evidence involving the shooting of Rosenbaum, including FBI aerial footage, with all persons of interest marked; a drone video, along with its zoomed-in images after Rittenhouse put down a fire extinguisher he was holding; and a full-events video in regular and slow motion.\", \"The jury was given everything requested, except for the still images from the drone video, which is now the subject of two motions for a mistrial brought by the defense.\", \"Rittenhouse's attorneys have argued that they did not receive the higher-quality version of the drone footage but rather a compressed version. They have asked for a mistrial without prejudice\\u2014which means Rittenhouse could still be retried.\", \"However, the defense has filed for a motion with prejudice, which would bar the state from retrying the case.\", \"The judge has yet to rule on those motions, and a ruling would hinge on the jury's verdict.\", \"If jurors reach a not guilty verdict on all five charges, the motions will be moot.
