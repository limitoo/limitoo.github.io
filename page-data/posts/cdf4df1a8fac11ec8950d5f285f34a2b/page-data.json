Pay disparities, they continue to exist. All of those are things we are looking to address.\\\"\", \"Sepuloni described it as a plan underpinned by three pou.\", \"The first would be to ensure M\\u0101ori - rangatahi and pakeke - can get the skills and knowledge they need. Second would see moves to create better conditions for kaimahi, and workplaces that are free of discrimination. The third would be to empower iwi, hap\\u016b and other M\\u0101ori, she said.\", \"M\\u0101ori development minister Willie Jackson said it was a vital plan for all New Zealand.\", \"With the M\\u0101ori labour force growing five times faster than that of non-M\\u0101ori, improving the situation for M\\u0101ori was vital to the growth of the national economy.\", \"\\\"We've got a young M\\u0101ori population, M\\u0101ori making up a much bigger part of our economy. We know that there are over 10,000 economically significant M\\u0101ori-owned businesses, and the M\\u0101ori asset base is approaching 70 billion [dollars] and has grown about 10 percent a year for the past decade, much faster than the overall economy,\\\" Jackson told the same hui.\", \"The challenge, he said, was getting that to flow to the coalface, so it could improve the lives of wh\\u0101nau.\", \"\\\"That remains a challenge for us,\\\" Jackson said. M\\u0101ori employed three times as many M\\u0101ori as non-M\\u0101ori employers, he said.\", \"\\\"We have to be courageous, we have to look at different ways.\\\"\", \"Also on Thursday, Sepuloni celebrated a milestone of 10,000 M\\u0101ori being supported into jobs through the Mana in Mahi, He Poutama Rangatahi, Apprenticeship Boost, M\\u0101ori Trades and Training, and Flexi-Wage schemes.\", \"He Poutama Rangatahi alone had supported 3133 rangatahi into employment, education and training since 2018, she said.\", \"An extra $14.2m in funding would be added to the programme through 11 community providers to help get 967 more rangatahi into education, training and employment.\", \"M\\u0101ori had historically not been able to access the level of training and education that others had and the extra funding was aimed at addressing that, Sepuloni said.\", \"\\\"They've made it very clear that they want to have that kind of support so that they're uplifted to get into the kinds of jobs they want ... it's about being able to put food on the table, get into employment and have a happy life.\", \"\\\"Much of this has been informed by young people and I think that's been really important.\\\"\", \"\\\"We've heard the stories, we've seen the results, so we're investing in something that has proven to be effective.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"cdf4df1a8fac11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cdf4df1a8fac11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
