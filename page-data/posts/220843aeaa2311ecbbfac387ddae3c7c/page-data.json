They figure, \\\"'if I lost my job, I could probably get another one fairly easily',\\\" he said.\", \"Logan finds similarities between Starbucks and a recent campaign to unionize an REI store in New York. In both cases \\\"there is a union involved, but it's almost a process of self organization, about workers speaking to each other,\\\" he said. \\\"It's not really about having a big union invest millions and millions of dollars into a campaign at McDonald's, it's more grass-roots and worker-led, and companies probably fear that a lot more.\\\"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"220843aeaa2311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"220843aeaa2311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
