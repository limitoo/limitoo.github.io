Victoria has gone up as much as 10 per cent in the last 12 months.\\u00a0\", \"The weekly price for a rental property in the Bendigo region has jumped by 11.43 per cent, the largest jump in Victoria, while prices in the Hume and North West regions jumped by more than 8\\u00a0per cent respectively.\", \"During the same time, the average rent\\u00a0dropped by 3.33 per cent in Melbourne's Inner-East and stayed relatively stable in Melbourne's CBD.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"But such figures pale in comparison to what seems to be happening in the seaside hamlet of Port Fairy in south-west Victoria.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">No room at the Inn</div>\", \"Port Fairy is a quaint,\\u00a0seaside town around three-and-a-half hours' drive west of Melbourne.\", \"It's long been a popular holiday town in the south-west, with the prevalence of local holiday-makers from the wool-rich western district at one time giving the town the nickname \\\"Hamilton South\\\".\", \"However
