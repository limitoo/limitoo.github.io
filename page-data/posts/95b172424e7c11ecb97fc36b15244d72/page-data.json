(Hong Kong requires almost all overseas arrivals to quarantine in hotels for two to three weeks.) The virus\\u2019s genetic sequence was identical in both men, suggesting airborne transmission, according to the city\\u2019s Center for Health Protection. Both men were vaccinated.\", \"Further sequencing by the University of Hong Kong confirmed that the viruses belonged to the new variant from South Africa, officials said, though they acknowledged that information about the variant\\u2019s public health impact was \\u201clacking at the moment.\\u201d\", \"Some Hong Kong experts have questioned the length and efficacy of Hong Kong\\u2019s quarantines, noting that officials have recorded several cases of residents in quarantine hotels apparently infecting people who were staying in other rooms.\", \"In the case of the latest variant infections, the government has blamed the first man for not wearing a surgical mask when opening his hotel room door, as well as \\u201cunsatisfactory air flow\\u201d in the hotel. As of Friday afternoon there had been no reports of infections in nearby rooms.\", \"The presence of the new variant may complicate efforts to reopen the border between Hong Kong and mainland China. For months, Hong Kong officials have said that resuming quarantine-free travel between the Chinese territory and the mainland \\u2014 virtually the only places in the world still pursuing a containment strategy that seeks full eradication of the virus \\u2014 is their top priority, even though the strategy has damaged the city\\u2019s reputation as a global finance hub.\", \"Mainland officials have said that Hong Kong is not doing enough to control the virus, even though the city has recorded just two locally transmitted cases in the last six months. The mainland has recently faced new domestic outbreaks; on Thursday, the National Health Commission there reported four new local cases.\", \"On Thursday evening, Hong Kong\\u2019s No. 2 official, John Lee, said mainland officials had told him earlier in the day that Hong Kong had \\u201cbasically fulfilled\\u201d the conditions to reopen the border. He said details would still need to be worked out, including the introduction of a mainland-style \\u201chealth code\\u201d app that has raised privacy concerns.\", \"Asked by a reporter whether the new variant would delay reopening with the mainland, Mr. Lee said only that the Hong Kong authorities would \\u201censure that adequate research and tracking are done in this regard.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOf course, we must manage and control any new risks,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"95b172424e7c11ecb97fc36b15244d72"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"95b172424e7c11ecb97fc36b15244d72"}},
