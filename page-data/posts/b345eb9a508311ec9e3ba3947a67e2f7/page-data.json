He was 41.\", \"The cause was cancer, according to Mo\\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury group that bought a majority stake in Mr. Abloh\\u2019s Off-White brand this year.\", \"The artistic director of Louis Vuitton men\\u2019s wear as well as the founder of his own company, Mr. Abloh was a prolific collaborator with outside brands from Nike to Evian, and a popular fashion theorist whose expansive and occasionally controversial approach to design inspired comparisons with everyone from Andy Warhol to Jeff Koons.\", \"Mr. Abloh transformed not just what consumers wanted to wear, bridging streetwear and the luxury world, but what brands wanted in a designer.\", \"For him clothes were not garments but fungible totems of identity that sat at the nexus of art, music, politics and philosophy, and he treated them as such.\", \"\\u201cVirgil was not only a genius designer, a visionary, he was also a man with a beautiful soul and great wisdom,\\u201d Bernard Arnault, the chairman of LVMH, said in a statement.\", \"A workaholic who maintained a punishing schedule and moonlighted as a D.J. and a furniture designer, Mr. Abloh nevertheless seemed to glory in having his fingers in as many pies as possible. Indeed, he referred to himself not as a designer but as a \\u201cmaker,\\u201d in acknowledgment of his own omnivorous creative mind.\", \"Just last July, he had been promoted to a new position within LVMH that would allow him to work across the group\\u2019s 75 brands, making him the most powerful Black executive in the most powerful luxury group in the world.It was a nontraditional job for a nontraditional personality who was more interested in carving a new path in an old industry than following in anyone\\u2019s footsteps.\", \"\\u201cVirgil is incredibly good at creating bridges between the classic and the zeitgeist of the moment,\\u201d said Michael Burke, the chief executive of Louis Vuitton, when Mr. Abloh was named artistic director of men\\u2019s wear for the luxury brand in 2018.\", \"Virgil Abloh was born in Rockford, Ill., on Sept. 30, 1980, to Ghanaian immigrant parents, and grew up immersed in skate culture and hip-hop. He studied civil engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and received a master\\u2019s degree in architecture from the Illinois Institute of Technology. \", \"When he was 22 he met Kanye West, and soon thereafter became his creative director, a relationship that set him on the road to Paris.\", \"\", \"A full obituary will appear soon.\"]","href_hash":"b345eb9a508311ec9e3ba3947a67e2f7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b345eb9a508311ec9e3ba3947a67e2f7"}},
