As you can see they are breaking the fencing by running into them or kicking them down. As Thanksgiving break begins, parents please council your children on why fencing is not a trend to hop on,\\\" the department wrote on Facebook, sharing images of fences broken.\", \"Since the summer, various areas across the U.S. have frequently reported similar incidents, often pinpointing TikTok as the cause behind it all.

Searching the term rakes in few videos, and those that do exist, do not feature individuals damaging fences.\", \"Often, the videos feature contractors running through thin walls, which were likely planned to be destroyed anyway.\", \"In July, Omaha police shared incidents of broken and damaged fences, with CCTV capturing individuals similarly running through them. At the time, the department suspected it may have been part of a TikTok challenge.\", \"\\\"I believe we made some arrests in this investigation; all juveniles. I'm told there was no evidence the destruction of property was part of a TikTok challenge.
