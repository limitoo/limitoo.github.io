Millions of players bought tickets in the hope of taking home the huge prize.\", \"The winning numbers were: 01, 02, 24, 50 and 57. The Powerball number was 26 and the Power Play was 2x.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Did Anyone Win the Powerball Jackpot?</div>\", \"For Wednesday's draw, there was no winner of the jackpot.\", \"There was, however, one ticketholder who took home the second prize of $1 million. The ticket-holder of this prize was based in New York.\", \"There were also six winners who took home a version of the third prize. In Powerball, the Power Play ticket will multiply all prizes except for the jackpot, so of these winners, three took home the Power Play amount.\", \"As the Power Play was x2, the usually $50,000 prize was doubled for these winners.\", \"The three third prize winners without the Power Play were based in Massachusetts, Minnesota and Oregon, while the three third prize winners with the Power Play were based in Texas, Virginia and Pennsylvania.\", \"Because the jackpot was not won, it will roll over to the next draw on Sunday.\", \"The new amount of the Sunday draw is currently estimated at $146 million, with a cash value of $104.2 million.\", \"However, as with all lottery games, the final winnings depend on how many tickets are sold across the country.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How Does the Powerball Lottery Work?</div>\", \"The Powerball draws take place every Monday, Wednesday and Saturday at 10:59 p.m. ET.\", \"Players pay $2 to buy a ticket, and select five numbers from one to 69 as their Fast Five numbers. They then choose one number from one to 26 as the red Powerball.\\nThose who want to hand over their odds to Lady Luck can play on a lottery terminal and let the machine randomly choose their numbers.\", \"Players can choose to use the Power Play as well, which costs an extra $1, and can see the prizes multiplied by two, three, four, five or 10.\", \"The 10x multiplier is only available when the jackpot is $150 million or less.\", \"The multiplier works on all prizes except the jackpot, but for the second prize it will only multiply it by two, becoming $2 million maximum.\", \"The Power Play is chosen randomly before the numbers are drawn.\", \"In terms of the prize money, the amount of tickets bought can change how the game is played.\", \"As the jackpots get larger, more people buy tickets, which means more possible number combinations are sold. As a result, it eventually becomes impossible for a drawing to occur without a winner, as so many combinations have been sold.\", \"All the prizes are set cash amounts, except the jackpot which will change depending on tickets sold. In California, however, the amounts are pari-mutuel and determined by sales and the number of winners.\", \"This means that the money which is owed to lower prize winners is deducted from the jackpot, so in California the jackpot will potentially be slightly lower after these deductions take place.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1908905/powerball.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Powerball is a lottery system where you select 6 numbers, trying to match with what is drawn 3 times a week.</div>\"]","href_hash":"b293f8d43d4d11ecac03000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b293f8d43d4d11ecac03000017025a03"}},
