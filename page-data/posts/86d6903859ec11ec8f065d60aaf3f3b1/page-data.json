He remembered thinking, \\u201cHow do I make a show about the culture wars that doesn\\u2019t become a part of the culture wars?\\u201d\", \"The result is \\u201cThings Fell Apart,\\u201d a podcast now airing weekly in Britain on BBC radio, with the first two episodes free to stream on Apple Podcasts in the U.S. Over eight episodes, Ronson looks back at the history of America\\u2019s culture wars \\u2014 which he defines as the \\u201cbattle for dominance over conflicting values\\u201d \\u2014 to discover the sources of our current cultural fault lines.\", \"Ronson speaks to people who found themselves at the vanguard of issues like abortion and school curriculums, including Alice Moore, who ignited a clash in West Virginia over the content of school textbooks in the 1970s, and Frank Schaeffer, who as a young man helped make Christian documentaries that led to American evangelicals getting involved in the anti-abortion movement.\", \"In the interview, Ronson talked about the series and covering the culture wars in a constructive way. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"You talk about your friends tearing themselves apart because of online culture wars. Were you witnessing their \\u201ccancellations\\u201d or were they just perturbed by what was happening online?\", \"Well, cancellations has become such a sort of catchall term. I find it a frustrating term, particularly because it includes everything from the disproportionate punishment of private individuals who really don\\u2019t deserve it, through agent-provocateur newspaper columnists who are saying that they\\u2019re being canceled when actually it\\u2019s just the rough and tumble of public discourse, through to politicians who have sexually assaulted someone. So it\\u2019s such a difficult word.\", \"I suppose the people I\\u2019m talking about are people that are sort of in the middle of that. These were public figures who would say something, there would be pushback and then it would escalate, and the next thing you know, it had completely consumed these people\\u2019s lives and they were seeing it all out of proportion.\", \"In the podcast, you go back and look at eight stories from the history of cultural fault lines in the United States. Why these stories specifically?\", \"It felt like a kind of mathematical equation, because I wanted to tell stories about the big culture wars that have been happening since the early \\u201970s, and I didn\\u2019t want to leave any out, but I also wanted to find amazing human stories. I wanted these to feel like mini-movies as opposed to polemics. So that wasn\\u2019t easy.\", \"What\\u2019s clear from the podcast is that culture wars are nothing new. What is it about our current age\\u2019s preoccupation with them?\", \"Obviously you\\u2019ve got powerful individuals who were prodding at the culture wars for their own reasons, like Trump- \\u2014 people who knew they could utilize the culture war for their own ends.\", \"You also have great passion and new weapons, I think, on the left. Social media gave a voice to voiceless people, and suddenly marginalized communities had a way of expressing what had been bubbling up inside, and they didn\\u2019t have an outlet for it before.\", \"In Episode 5, I look at these engineers who worked on the early days of the internet, who believed in allowing machines to do whatever machines are capable of doing. Don\\u2019t try and interfere in any way whatsoever. Even if that means allowing the most offensive language to flourish unencumbered, even if it means allowing lies to flourish unencumbered. Those things are more important than trying to temper things in any way. This was the sort of utopian ideal behind the invention of the internet, and that\\u2019s the world we\\u2019ve all been living in ever since.\", \"You\\u2019ve written so much about social media and the culture wars. Did you feel like you could approach the topics dispassionately?\", \"\\u201cHow do I approach it dispassionately\\u201d was one of my first questions because I didn\\u2019t want to throw any oil on any fires. So then I thought the perfect idea would be to go back in history and tell origin stories.\", \"It kind of de-emotionalizes it a little bit, when you\\u2019re talking about something that happened 20, 30 years ago, that has real echoes to what\\u2019s happening today \\u2014 really surprising, unexpected echoes that you wouldn\\u2019t anticipate. Most culture war stories are partisan, and they\\u2019re all about making the culture wars flare even more, but if you\\u2019re taking the anger out of it then there\\u2019s space for curiosity.\", \"You don\\u2019t mention politicians a lot in the show. Is the omission intentional?\", \"I tend to have stayed away from party politics, politics with a capital P. When I find an odd story of somebody just living a personal life and they get caught up in big politics \\u2014 decisions being made upon high filter down and impact them, and maybe in ways they don\\u2019t know \\u2014 I just find those stories very engaging. With politicians, I think there are so many better political journalists than me with experience, they\\u2019ve been doing it for decades, and I just haven\\u2019t, it\\u2019s probably hard to break through all of the politicians\\u2019 P.R.-ing.\", \"I was especially struck by your episode about Tammy Faye Bakker, the televangelist who, in a 1985 interview, showed compassion for Rev. Steve Pieters, a pastor living with AIDS at a time when prominent evangelicals were hostile toward the gay community. Is there a moral message you want to leave listeners with?\", \"Everybody says that they want a solution. If you look to the past, human connection and people listening to each other tends to work better than people retreating to their corners and screaming at each other.\", \"With the Tammy Faye episode, people have been emailing and messaging me to say that they were sobbing listening to the show. And I think that means it\\u2019s touching something that really matters to us, that we haven\\u2019t been able to access quite as much as we should have these last six or seven years, which is human connection, empathy, shared humanity.\", \"Do you see yourself continuing to produce work about the culture wars?\", \"I can\\u2019t lie, it does occupy a lot of my thoughts. It does feel like the most important thing that\\u2019s happening at the moment, especially since the Republicans are gearing up to make the midterm elections about the culture wars, all about cancel culture, quote unquote, so it is a very important part of our world.\", \"I think I\\u2019ve done enough critiquing of it now. What I want to do instead is try and tell positive stories that might make people have different emotional responses.\"]","href_hash":"86d6903859ec11ec8f065d60aaf3f3b1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"86d6903859ec11ec8f065d60aaf3f3b1"}},
