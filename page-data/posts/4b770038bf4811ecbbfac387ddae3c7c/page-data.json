One of his defense attorneys said during closing arguments of the trial that began in February that the state hadn't provided evidence to prove murder allegations.\", \"Before deliberations began last week, the judge told jurors they could also consider lesser charges of attempted murder, and denied a last-minute motion to declare a mistrial.\", \"Jurors seated for the trial heard from 53 prosecution witnesses, including medical experts, Mount Carmel employees, investigators, and family members of all 14 patients.\", \"Husel's defense team called a single witness on March 30: a Georgia anesthesiologist who testified that Husel's patients died from their medical conditions and not Husel's actions.\", \"Helen Young's husband of 46 years died in Husel's care.\", \"\\\"He said, 'Mr. Young's kidneys are gone. His lungs are gone. He's brain dead.' I said, 'How did all that happen at once?'
