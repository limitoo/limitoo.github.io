Back then, there was just a single room, with pupils sat on a mud floor. \", \"Under Taliban rule, beginning in Kabul in 1996, girls weren't allowed to get an education, and female teachers were ordered to stay at home. \", \"Aisha Misbah was one of them. Now she's headteacher and proudly shows off newly built classrooms. \", \"Many of those she taught have gone on to become doctors, engineers or even teachers at the school, she says. \", \"\\\"This is our biggest achievement. Our students are so bright. They're so creative and make such beautiful things that even we get shocked. I hope the Taliban will allow it all to continue.\\\"\", \"Since taking over Afghanistan for a second time, the Taliban have permitted girls to go to school. \", \"For now, however, only primary school pupils of both genders are attending classes, whilst teachers await the publication of new rules governing secondary schools. \", \"In some more rural areas, there have long been reports of Taliban commanders only permitting girls to go to school until they reach the age of puberty. \", \"The most recent figures from the World Bank show that about 40% of Afghan girls attend primary school, far more than during the Taliban's previous stint in power but far fewer than in other countries in the region. \", \"It's a similar picture in healthcare, where infant and maternal mortality rates have improved but remain shockingly high.  \", \"The Taliban insist women will be allowed to work, but some remain sceptical, especially after Taliban officials recently said most women, other than those working in healthcare or education, should stay at home until security improves. \", \"The same excuse was given throughout the 1990s to completely prevent women working.\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/167E7/production/_120453129_tents.png' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Tents in the Manouchehri school playground</div>\", \"But the pupils at Manouchehri face other challenges, too.\", \"In the playground, three large tents have been erected, with desks and blackboards. The school is so overcrowded that about half of the pupils have to study outside. \", \"Pleas to the previous government fell on deaf ears, and when non-government organisations offered to help, they were told to give the money to the education ministry first. \", \"Rampant corruption has plagued Afghanistan over the past two decades, and it meant that the billions of dollars of international support didn't always make it to those in need. \", \"The education system has helped mould, however, a generation of young Afghan women and men who are vocal in standing up for their views, including challenging the Taliban.\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/15527/production/_120453378_protesters.png' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Women protest in Kabul</div>\", \"\\\"We are not those men and women of 20 years ago,\\\" one female protester at a demonstration in Kabul tells me, \\\"who were whipped into submission.\\\"\", \"Another, her voice pulsing with emotion says: \\\"We are not afraid of death.
