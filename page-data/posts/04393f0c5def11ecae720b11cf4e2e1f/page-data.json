Putin concurred with Xi\\u2019s critical view of Western military activity in the Asia-Pacific region. The leaders discussed forming an \\u201cindependent financial infrastructure,\\u201d a Kremlin aide said, to reduce their reliance on Western banks.\", \"Context: Western officials have been in talks about Russia\\u2019s pressure on Ukraine. But Moscow is signaling that it has plenty of other friends, as with Putin\\u2019s trip last week to meet with Prime Minister Narendra Modi of India. Putin and Xi floated a possible three-way summit with India.\", \"Quotable: \\u201cBoth China and Russia face the same pressure from the United States,\\u201d Cheng Xiaohe, a professor in Beijing, said. \\u201cTherefore, the two countries need to support each other in diplomacy.\\u201d\", \"North Korea has executed at least seven people in the past decade for watching or distributing K-pop videos, according to a rights group.\", \"The group, Transitional Justice Working Group, which is based in Seoul, interviewed 683 North Korean defectors since 2015 to help map places in the North where people were \\u200bkilled and buried\\u200b in state-sanctioned public executions\\u200b. In its latest report, the group said it had documented 23 such executions under Kim\\u2019s government.\", \"Though he invited Korean musicians to perform in 2018, Kim has said he believes the entertainment corrupts North Koreans\\u2019 minds. Under a law adopted last December, those who distribute South Korean entertainment can face the death penalty.\", \"Context: Public executions have been used to create an atmosphere of terror. One witness said her second-grade classroom had been made to watch. A few spectators have secretly filmed trials and killings, and they smuggled the evidence out of North Korea. \", \"Ethiopia\\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, won the Nobel Peace Prize for making peace with his country\\u2019s longtime enemy \\u2014 and then used the alliance to plan a war.\", \"Abiy won the Nobel in 2019 for his surprise deal with Isaias Afwerki, the authoritarian leader of Eritrea. That pact ended two decades of hostility and war between the neighboring rivals. But it also emboldened Abiy and Isaias to secretly plot a course for war against their mutual foes in the northern Tigray region, according to officials.\", \"Abiy insists that war was foisted upon him. But new evidence shows he was planning a military campaign for months before the first shot was fired. Analysts say that Abiy\\u2019s journey from peacemaker to battlefield commander is a cautionary tale of how the West, desperate to find a new hero in Africa, got this leader spectacularly wrong.\", \"Quotable: \\u201cFrom that day, Abiy felt he was one of the most influential personalities in the world,\\u201d Gebremeskel Kassa, a former senior Abiy administration official now in exile in Europe, said of the Nobel. \\u201cHe felt he had a lot of international support, and that if he went to war in Tigray, nothing would happen. And he was right,\\u201d he added.\", \"Thousands of Afghan refugees are being released from military bases to U.S. cities to rebuild their lives.

The product of their work will be touched by approximately 100 hands in at least three countries, from Mongolia to Italy to its final store, over a period of 18 months to two years.\", \"Soon, the garments that cashmere becomes will include garment tags that trace the cashmere\\u2019s journey from herd to bale to sweater. It may seem like a simple thing: a brand knowing exactly where and how its products are made.\", \"Yet the fashion supply chain is so complicated, its many moving parts spread out over so many countries and processes, that for most of us the origin stories of our clothes are almost entirely opaque. Here\\u2019s what Loro Piana\\u2019s supply chain looks like, beginning with Ha Si Ba Gen, a rancher in Mongolia.\", \"This caramelized brussels sprouts pasta with toasted chickpeas is fast and satisfying.\", \"\\u201cThe Oxford Companion to Spirits and Cocktails\\u201d is a witty, encyclopedic guide that tells you everything you need to know about mixing drinks, their history and more.\", \"Here are four ways toward a healthier tech life in 2022.\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: Best-selling cookie in the U.S. (four letters).\", \"And here is today\\u2019s Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.
