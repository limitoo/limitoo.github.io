Americans, after all, have reacted to the pandemic with division and anger, which has fueled widespread refusal to take lifesaving vaccines and continuing chaos in schools.\", \"Given all of this, you might not be feeling especially intimidated by the U.S., even though it continues to have the world\\u2019s largest economy, most important currency and strongest military.\", \"This background helps explain the tensions in both Ukraine and Taiwan. In each, an authoritarian power is making noises about invading a small nearby democracy, and the U.S. has issued stern warnings against any such action. The two authoritarian powers \\u2014 Russia and China \\u2014 may ultimately choose to stand down, at least temporarily. But their increasing aggression is a sign of their willingness to defy what their leaders see as a weakened U.S.\", \"Today, I\\u2019m going to focus on Ukraine. President Biden and President Vladimir Putin of Russia spent two hours in a tense video call yesterday, focused largely on Ukraine. Russia recently moved troops toward the Ukrainian border, creating fears of an invasion.\", \"Putin believes that Ukraine \\u2014 a country of 44 million people that was previously part of the Soviet Union \\u2014 should be subservient to Russia. The two countries share a 1,200-mile border as well as cultural and linguistic ties (which many Ukrainians think Putin exaggerates).\", \"But instead of aligning itself with Russia, Ukraine has shifted toward the West, including the toppling a Putin-backed leader in 2014. Ukraine\\u2019s current president, Volodymyr Zelensky, has pushed back against Russia\\u2019s attempts to expand its influence.\", \"\\u201cPutin sees Ukraine developing into a de facto U.S. and NATO military outpost,\\u201d my colleague Michael Crowley, who covers the State Department, says.\", \"Russia\\u2019s amassing of troops along Ukraine\\u2019s border is a signal that Putin will consider an invasion unless Ukraine backs away from the West. Russia already annexed Ukraine\\u2019s Crimean Peninsula in a 2014 military operation, although much of the world does not acknowledge it as Russian territory.\", \"Foreign aggression often gives political leaders a chance to rally nationalistic support at home, especially as a distraction from domestic problems. And Russia has domestic problems, like surging Covid-19 cases, slow-growing wages and rising prices. Last year, opposition groups held some of the largest anti-Putin marches in years.\", \"Putin may also fear that his sway over Ukraine is weakening, both because of Zelensky\\u2019s resistance within Ukraine and because of Russian politics. Kadri Liik of the European Council on Foreign Relations writes:\", \"For years, Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian troops have fought skirmishes along Ukraine\\u2019s eastern border (the other hot spot, in addition to Crimea). The two sides exchanged fire from machine guns and grenade launchers yesterday. International diplomats worry the skirmishes could offer Putin a pretext for an invasion.\", \"Russia\\u2019s tactics are not limited to force, either. It has waged a disinformation campaign, falsely labeling the 2014 revolution a fascist coup and launching cyberattacks against Ukraine\\u2019s government, military and power systems. These tactics, of course, also recall Putin\\u2019s interference in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump\\u2019s campaign \\u2014 which Russia has falsely blamed on Ukraine.\", \"In a recent Atlantic magazine story, Anne Applebaum explains how Putin and his allies are using disinformation to support an autocrat in Belarus as well. \\u201cThey are seeking to entrench and solidify the autocratic world while undermining the democratic world,\\u201d Applebaum said in a recent NPR interview.\", \"Even if Russian troops don\\u2019t invade, Putin could gain from the confrontation, by intimidating the U.S. and Western Europe into backing away from Ukraine.\", \"Putin has rejected multilateral diplomacy on Ukraine, insisting on one-on-one conversations with the U.S. \\u201cHe wants a Cold War-style treaty,\\u201d Anton Troianovski, The Times\\u2019s Moscow bureau chief, says. But Putin\\u2019s demands \\u2014 including a pledge that NATO would stop military cooperation with Ukraine \\u2014 are probably too big for Biden to meet.\", \"More likely than a treaty is a continued mix of confrontation and diplomacy.\", \"On its own, Ukraine\\u2019s military seems outmatched by Russia\\u2019s. And a full-scale U.S. military response seems doubtful, given a weariness of foreign wars that Biden and many American voters share.\", \"But Biden still has options. The U.S. can increase its military support to Ukraine, which could make a potential invasion look bloodier and more costly for Russia. (The U.S. is pursuing a related strategy in Taiwan.)\", \"Biden can also threaten sanctions on Russia, as he did on the call with Putin yesterday, according to Jake Sullivan, the president\\u2019s national security adviser. \\u201cHe told President Putin directly that if Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States and our European allies would respond with strong economic measures,\\u201d Sullivan told reporters. If Russia does attack Ukraine, Biden said that the U.S. would react more strongly than it did to the 2014 takeover of the Crimean Peninsula.\", \"But sanctions might not be enough to deter Putin. As Applebaum has pointed out, autocracies have endured sanctions in recent years partly with economic aid from other autocracies, including China. It\\u2019s one of the realities of a world in which autocracy is on the rise.\", \"For more: Five takeaways from the Biden-Putin call.\", \"The media is covering Biden too harshly, The Washington Post\\u2019s Dana Milbank argues. Ross Douthat disagrees, writing that Biden\\u2019s negative press reflects reality.\", \"Slate\\u2019s Lili Loofbourow mourns the American mall.\", \"Festive: It\\u2019s a Christmas sweater on a T. rex.

Han died at 83.\", \"The most watched original film in Netflix\\u2019s history is now \\u201cRed Notice,\\u201d a globe-trotting heist movie starring Dwayne Johnson, Gal Gadot and Ryan Reynolds. The plot is an amalgamation of action movie clich\\u00e9s: Johnson plays a lawful strongman, Reynolds is the jester and Gadot plays the femme fatale, Beatrice Loayza writes in a review.\", \"Though \\u201cRed Notice\\u201d has a relatively small cultural footprint compared with Netflix hits like \\u201cSquid Game\\u201d and \\u201cBird Box\\u201d \\u2014 the company\\u2019s previous most-watched film \\u2014 it\\u2019s engineered for mass appeal.
