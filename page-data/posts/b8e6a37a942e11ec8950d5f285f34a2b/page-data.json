First, the clinic surprised consumers with surprise bills for bogus doctor's visits and consultations that never occurred, the lawsuit alleges. Second, it told patients they would be reimbursed for their up-front testing costs. \\\"\", \"This just never happened,\\\" Roman said. \\\"People found that their insurers were getting billed. and they were getting billed on top of that.\\\"\", \"Schumacher and Cunningham, who are domestic partners, allege they were each billed $225 for a COVID-19 test result required for travel. At the time, CareCube allegedly told the couple it could not reach their insurers, but that they would be reimbursed.\", \"\\\"Both my partner and I needed COVID tests right away in order to travel. CareCube took advantage of that to cheat us out of $450,\\\" Cunningham said in a statement to CBS MoneyWatch. \\\"It's sad that companies like CareCube are exploiting people during a global pandemic just to make a quick buck, especially in a hard-hit area like New York City.\\\"\", \"They are suing to recover for damages and to force CareCube to disgorge millions of dollars in revenue it is estimated to have \\\"wrongfully taken from New York consumers,\\\" attorney Burkett McInturff said.\", \"McInturff added that the COVID-19 testing market has been rife with scams since\\u00a0the virus first took hold, with criminals capitalizing on the complexity of medical billing practices to prey on consumers.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Whenever markets are shrouded in opacity, it makes it easier for bad actors to take advantage of consumers.

In early January, New York Attorney General Letitia James announced an investigation over how the company charges customers for both rapid and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) COVID-19 tests.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"CareCube and all COVID-19 test providers have a responsibility to be accurate and transparent in their billing process,\\\" James said in the announcement.
