Trysten told authorities he was with his father all morning.\\u00a0 \", \"Jim Axelrod: How important was that for Todd?\", \"Dina Nesheiwat: Crucial. \\u2026 That was his saving grace.\", \"But everything changed just days before the trial when Trysten was re-interviewed and admitted he did not have eyes on his father the whole time. Trysten said he lost sight of Todd a couple of times when Trysten went to get some water in the office at the front of barn.\", \"Matthew Troiano: This is not the situation that we had before where Trysten is saying I'm with him the whole time.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \", \"Jim Axelrod: I have eyes on my dad the entire time?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \", \"Matthew Troiano: Correct.\", \"Jim Axelrod: And once you don't have that?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \", \"Matthew Troiano: Game changer.\", \"In that interview, Trysten estimated he was gone less than a minute each time. But when he was questioned by prosecutor Maureen Hughes at the trial \\u2026 \", \"MAUREEN HUGHES: At some point, did you lose sight of your dad?\\u00a0\", \"TRYSTEN MULLIS: Yes.\\u00a0\", \"MAUREEN HUGHES: Do you know exactly how long your dad wasn't in your sight?\", \"TRYSTEN MULLIS: No. \", \"MAUREEN HUGHES: Trysten, would it be accurate to say that you don't know how much time you were away from your dad when you were in -- when you were working in the hog barn?\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0 \", \"TRYSTEN MULLIS: Yes.\", \"And with Trysten's revised statement, the prosecution insisted Todd had the opportunity to kill Amy.\", \"Matthew Troiano: Every statement that he's given has been worse and worse for his father because the first one was pretty airtight. \", \"Jim Axelrod: What do you think's goin' on with Trysten?\", \"Matthew Troiano: I think he's like any other 13- or 14- or 15-year-old where \\u2026 there's probably, \\\"I wanna try to do the right thing. I wanna try to maybe help my mom and help my dad\\\" \\u2026 And you know, that's culminated in he has to testify against his father. It's awful.\", \"But there was still room for doubt. Trysten said he never saw blood on Todd. And that at no point while they were working together in the hog barn did his demeanor change. What's more, Dina Nesheiwat maintains that no matter how long it took Trysten to get those drinks of water in the office. There was no way Todd had enough time to get from the hog barn to the red shed.\\u00a0\", \"Dina Nesheiwat: To expect him to stab his wife with a corn rake, not once, not twice, possibly three times. Wait for her to make sure she's dead and then come with no blood, no torn clothes, same composure as if nothing happened. It's not possible.\", \"Investigators didn't have any physical evidence linking Todd to the scene. But they did have electronics from the Mullis farm, including a security camera system.\", \"Matthew Troiano: There's two vantage points for these cameras that look out over the property, one of which would've captured the area around the red shed. Not inside the red shed, but around the red shed.\", \"And when investigators searched for any footage from the day Amy died \\u2026\", \"Travis Hemesath: We were unable to find any video.\", \"But strangely, one of the cameras had a recording from the next day.\", \"Jim Axelrod: Well, now, that doesn't seem to add up. \", \"Jim Axelrod: Do you think he deleted the footage?\", \"Matthew Troiano: I think that the reasonable explanation is that he deleted the footage.\", \"To make matters worse for Todd, investigators found a series of disturbing internet searches on his iPad, including \\\"what happens to cheaters in history,\\\" \\\"thrill of the kill\\\" and \\\"killing unfaithful women.\\\" \", \"Jim Axelrod: if I'm investigating a homicide and the guy I think committed the murder of his wife has been searching online about what happens to cheating wives, don't I have an open-and-shut case? \\u2026\", \"Matthew Troiano: It doesn't look good.\", \"With the prosecution's case laid out, all eyes turned to Todd, who took the stand in his own defense. \", \"Jim Axelrod: Were you surprised that Todd testified? \", \"Matthew Troiano: You know, his reactions and -- and his actions and what he does and doesn't do are made such an important part of the case that the best person to explain that is Todd Mullis. \", \"For about three hours, Todd calmly addressed the many questions swirling around him, including why he didn't call 911 right away. \", \"TODD MULLIS:\\u00a0 I -- I just wanted to -- help her. I just wanted to -- let's - let's go to the hospital there's something wrong. \\u2026 I'm a doer, I guess. I just -- I wanted to help. \\u2026 I was in reaction mode. I \\u2013 I -- wanted to get her to the hospital.\\u00a0 \", \"Todd also told the jury why there was no security camera footage from the day Amy died. He said he believed his cats had accidentally knocked the antennas off the window ledge while they were trying to find a warm spot to sit.\", \"TODD MULLIS: The colder it gets, cats go to heat. And -- there's a heater right below the window, sun comes up in the morning, they sit in the window.\", \"In fact, there were no recordings for nearly two weeks leading up to Amy's death. And the reason one of the cameras suddenly started working the following day:\", \"TODD MULLIS: It was the day after. I think after -- talking to family members and stuff, they go \\u2026\\\"do you have anything on the camera?\\\" \\u2026 So, I went out \\u2026 I seen everything was knocked off, hanging down by the floor. \\u2026 I picked it all back up. \\u2026 I did not know how long it had -- been off or whatever.\", \"As for those internet searches about cheating spouses, when defense attorney Gerald Feuerhelm asked Todd if he had done them \\u2026 \", \"TODD MULLIS: No. I did not.\", \"GERALD FEUERHELM: Did you know who did?\", \"TODD MULLIS:\\u00a0 I have no idea who looked that up. \", \"Todd said other family members used the iPad, including Amy.\\u00a0\", \"GERALD FEUERHELM: have you ever searched for wedding dresses?\", \"TODD MULLIS: I have never searched for wedding dresses. \", \"GERALD FEUERHELM: Did you ever do a Pinterest search?\", \"TODD MULLIS: No.\", \"GERALD FEUERHELM: Do you know what Pinterest is?\", \"TODD MULLIS: I have no idea what Pinterest is. \", \"Then came the question everyone wanted to know.\", \"GERALD FEUERHELM: Todd, did -- did you -- ambush your wife, Amy, in that shed that day and brutally beat her and chop -- chop her up with that corn fork?\", \"TODD MULLIS: No, I did not. \", \"GERALD FEUERHELM: Do you know who did?\", \"TODD MULLIS: I have no idea.\", \"In closing statements, the prosecutor left the jury with a final thought about Todd's motive. \", \"MAUREEN HUGHES: Why did he kill Amy? Because he didn't want to lose his farm, because she was cheating. \\u2026 You might not like that Amy was having an affair, but that doesn't mean she deserved to die. \", \"As for the defense \\u2026\", \"GERALD FEUERHELM: The State has not proven a case against Todd Mullis beyond a reasonable doubt. . .. the dots don't even remotely connect, here. \", \"Dina Nesheiwat: There was zero physical evidence linking Todd to anything that happened. \", \"With the weeklong trial complete, the jury was excused to deliberate and decide Todd Mullis's fate. \", \"\\u00a0\", \"After a week of testimony, it was now up the jury to decide if Todd Mullis had murdered his wife Amy.\", \"Matthew Troiano: I think the question is this. Not so much is Todd Mullis innocent of doing this \\u2026\\u00a0 I think the more critical question is: Did the state prove that he did it?\", \"An alternate juror, who asked that we not use her name, weighed all of the testimony and evidence as she watched the trial.\", \"Jim Axelrod: From where you're sitting, did the prosecution do a good job?\", \"Alternate Juror: I personally just wish that they would have been able to provide more forensics evidence. \", \"And some of the 12 jurors who went into the jury room to decide Todd Mullis' fate felt much the same way. Another juror, who also did not want to use her name, said the jury was split going into deliberations.\", \"Jim Axelrod: What was the initial feel? \", \"Juror: There was probably half, at least, that said he was guilty. And then \\u2026 the rest were undecided. \\u2026 there were some that had difficulty saying he was guilty when there was no witnesses.\", \"Jim Axelrod: This was a big deal that you were basically sifting through circumstantial evidence and there was no witness to the crime.\", \"Juror: Yes. \\u2026 it was a serious -- a serious verdict to come up with.\", \"After roughly seven hours of deliberation -- a verdict. \", \"JUDGE BITTER: \\\"We the jury find the defendant, Todd Michael Mullis, guilty of the crime of murder in the first degree \\u2026\\\"\", \"Guilty. Amy Mullis' family breathed a sigh of relief, and Todd Mullis subtly shook his head before being led out of the courtroom in chains. As the juror who spoke with \\\"48 Hours\\\" explained, the jury reached a consensus by going back through all the evidence.\", \"Juror: \\u2026 we talked about all the different scenarios it could have been and it was -- we couldn't come up with a plausible explanation. But then we went back to Todd and \\u2026 all the points against him. \\u2026 It was \\u2026 a series of unfortunate events that \\u2026 just didn't add up. \", \"Starting with Todd's decision to take the corn rake out of Amy's back and drive her away to get help before calling 911.\", \"Juror: I didn't understand why he didn't call 911.\\u00a0\", \"Jim Axelrod: And the fact that he chose not to, was that a big deal for you?\", \"Juror: Yes, I think he wanted to get her away from the farm.\", \"And, she says Todd did not do himself any favors by taking the stand.\", \"Juror: To me he seemed cold. He was a cold fish. \\u2026 you know, he was probably a man of few words, which a lot of farmers are. But, you know, when you talk about things that they're passionate about, like their families or their farms, or \\u2026 their wives, or -- they usually can muster up some emotion.\\u00a0\", \"Then, there were those internet searches.\", \"Juror: We spent quite a bit of time going line by line down them \\u2026 looking at the searches before, looking at the searches after. And \\u2026 we concluded that they -- it was him. \\u2026 it wasn't just a crime of passion \\u2026 He had premeditation.\", \"After being found guilty, Todd Mullis hired a new legal team. And submitted a motion for a new trial, as he awaited sentencing.\", \"Matthew Troiano: So now, the issue is gonna become a legal issue of did he get a fair trial? Was anything done wrong that shouldn't have happened? \", \"Todd's motion claimed that, among other things, Todd's trial lawyers \\\"blatantly disregarded\\\" his guidance to argue that Amy died from an accident right from the start.\", \"Dina Nesheiwat: When that happened, Todd wrote on a sheet of paper, \\\"What the F was that?\\\"\", \"Jim Axelrod: The job of the defense lawyer is not to convince the jury that Todd is innocent, the job is to create reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury.\", \"Dina Nesheiwat: He should never have closed that door. He should have left it open for -- for the jurors to wonder, \\\"Well, was it an accident or was it a murder?\\\"\", \"The judge ruled on the motion:\", \"JUDGE BITTER: As to the defendant's motion for a new trial, and motion in arrest of judgement, I will deny those motions in their entirety. \\u2026 We will go ahead and proceed with sentencing at this time \\u2026\", \"Before being sentenced, Todd Mullis took one last chance to address the court:\", \"TODD MULLIS: I did not do this. This is supposed to be America where \\u2026 You shouldn't have to prove your innocence. \\u2026 I thought it was guilty until -- innocent until proven guilty. I feel this was the other way around. And, I was a faithful and loving husband \\u2026\", \"JUDGE BITTER: Mr. Mullis, for the charge of murder in the first degree \\u2026 you are sentenced to life in prison with no opportunity for parole.\", \"Now, as Todd Mullis is left to appeal his conviction from prison, the ripples of Amy's death continue to be felt by all who loved her.\", \"Dina Nesheiwat: This case is a tragedy all around.
