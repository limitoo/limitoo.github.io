The Albuquerque Police Department, the FBI and the families of the women have contributed to a reward of up to $100,000 for information that leads to an arrest and successful prosecution in this case.\", \"\\\"I think that we have to remember that we can never give up hope,\\\" said Police Chief Harold Medina, who was a lieutenant on the graveyard shift when the discovery was made.\", \"APD discusses West Mesa case on 13th Anniversary. \\nA reward of up to $100,000 is being offered for information leading to an arrest. \\n\\nIf you have any information about this case, please call (505)-768-2450 or Crime Stoppers at (505)843-STOP. You can also contact Investor Ida Lopez at ilopez@cabq.gov\", \"Authorities gathered to mark the 13th anniversary of the discovery of a human bone by a woman who was walking her dog on the mesa not far from a new housing development. It was the first of many skeletal remains that would be unearthed as part of an intense around-the-clock excavation that was followed by a nearly yearlong effort to identify the victims based on DNA and dental records.\", \"A few years before the discovery, Detective Ida Lopez noticed women with ties to drugs and prostitution had been vanishing from Albuquerque. All of the women who made the detective's list were among those found at the mass grave site on Albuquerque's west side.\", \"Authorities also noted Wednesday that eight women with similar backgrounds remain missing.\", \"While many of the victims struggled with drugs, family members never imagined they would turn up dead. Some were mothers and many knew each other.\", \"\\\"These women were loved, each one has a unique story and their families want answers, and we are dedicated to finding those answers,\\\" Lopez said in a statement.\", \"The women's names were read aloud by City Councilor Klarissa Pe\\u00f1a, whose district includes the area where the remains were found. She said the case has been burned into Albuquerque's collective memory and that a memorial park helps to keep the women's memories alive.\", \"\\\"These family members just want closure,\\\" she said. \\\"We hope that there are tips out there or anybody who knows anything can help in closing this case so the families can finally put their family members to rest in peace.\\\"\", \"Nearly 1,200 tips have come in over the years and about 200 women with arrest records for drugs and prostitution have been interviewed as part of the case. A task force also is conducting an audit of all the tips to ensure each one has been worked to the fullest.\", \"In 2018, two extensive searches were done \\u2014 one of which used ground penetrating radar based on a tip received in search of evidence of the missing women. The other search was near the original dig site and was determined to be an ancient burial ground. In 2021, another search was conducted based on a tip, but nothing turned up.\", \"Other cold case homicides also are being reviewed to see if there are similarities.\", \"Authorities said there are \\\"more than a few\\\" suspects in the serial killings.\", \"CBS affiliate KRQE reports that retired Homicide Sergeant Liz Thompson is now leading investigative work on the case. Thompson was hired back to the Albuquerque Police Department in 2021 as a contract investigator on cold cases.\", \"\\\"The number [of suspects] does change as we start looking into a new tip or eliminate someone,\\\" Thompson said. \\\"But I can tell you it's more than the two [people] that are commonly out there.\\\"\", \"\\\"This person may have been charming, or friendly in order to build trust or a relationship of some kind with the women first,\\\" Thompson said, describing the assumed profile of the suspect. \\\"This person is a predator, he sought out vulnerable women.\\\"\", \"Mayor Tim Keller said new information is what will lead to the case being solved.\", \"\\\"Sometimes we don't have all the answers, but we're not going to quit,\\\" he said.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"91c8465084fb11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"91c8465084fb11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
