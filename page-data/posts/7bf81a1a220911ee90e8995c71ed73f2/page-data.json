And I do also understand the points that the prime minister's making about the fact that this is a very uncertain and volatile time and major change in that has to be considered carefully.\\\"\", \"Robertson said investigating a capital gains tax was only one aspect of the government's \\\"huge and important work programme\\\".\", \"\\\"But we have a process, that process has been gone through, we're not going to be doing it and I'm getting on with the job that I've got.\\\"\", \"Any tax cuts would have to be funded, otherwise tax cuts would lead to cuts elsewhere and in the current economic environment that was not affordable, he said.\", \"Robertson would not rule out tax cuts saying Labour's tax policy had not yet been announced and he would not play the \\\"rule in rule out game\\\" adding now was not the time for major change in the tax system, he said.\", \"Current polling suggests that Labour would need the Green Party and Te P\\u0101ti M\\u0101ori to form a government.\", \"Robertson said Labour would not buckle in its approach to coalition partners.\", \"\\\"For all of the coalition governments that have existed under MMP it's the largest party's economic policy that sets the direction. Coalitions have to be built, everyone faces the same issues but the prime minister's made clear his view around the future of these kinds of taxes or the lack of them in a government that Labour will lead,\\\" Robertson said.\", \"But the Green Party yesterday said it was a very real possibility it would refuse to join a coalition with Labour if it will not put a wealth tax back on the table.\", \"Green Party co-leader James Shaw said no party leader was in a position to rule anything out yet as it was up to the voters to decide and the Greens' ability to negotiate would depend on the number of MPs they had.\", \"Party members could decide it was better to walk away than be part of a government that would not reform the tax system, he said.\", \"\\\"If you are voting for the Green Party then you are voting to support a Green and Labour government coalition, but if the terms of that aren't sufficient for our members then we always reserve the right to support Labour in a minority government where they have to come to us for every single vote and that is a very difficult proposition for them.\\\"\", \"That meant the Greens would have negotiating power, he said.\", \"Te P\\u0101ti M\\u0101ori has also criticised the decision, saying Hipkins is effectively ending coalition discussions before they have even met.\"]","href_hash":"7bf81a1a220911ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7bf81a1a220911ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
