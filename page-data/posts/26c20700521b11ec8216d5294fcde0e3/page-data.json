My husband and I had skipped the traditional marriage vows, but that conversation showed me their value: \\u201cFor better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health.\\u201d Thirty-one years later, we\\u2019re still married, he\\u2019s still H.I.V. negative and our 25-year-old twin daughters (also H.I.V. negative) are thriving. Sometimes, people\\u2019s comments say more about them than they do about you. \\u2014 Rebecca Denison\", \"My youngest was born with blue eyes, fair skin and curly blond hair. Nurses marveled over genetics and said that his appearance might change in months. It didn\\u2019t matter to me; my son is my son. Most strangers don\\u2019t think twice about our family. There\\u2019s context when they see his caramel siblings. But when it\\u2019s just us two? I\\u2019m often mistaken for the nanny. When people stare, I briefly wonder how I\\u2019ll explain or prove myself before I realize that I don\\u2019t have to. My skin is brown, my husband is white and our son is mixed with love. \\u2014 Wendy Newbury\", \"I\\u2019ve always hated melons. To me, they taste strange and have a repugnant, rotten smell. In Lebanon, my jiddo (slang for \\u201cgrandpa\\u201d in Arabic) would always invite me to eat melons for breakfast with him. After cutting the melon into small pieces, he would put the bites straight into my mouth. I pretended to love melon as he glimmered with pride, extolling the fresh, local produce. Years after I immigrated to the United States, I accidentally ate some melon in a fruit salad. Only then did I remember how much I hated melons, and how much I miss home. \\u2014 Youssef Saklawi\", \"\\u201cI am listless!\\u201d my friend said, happily. \\u201cI have stopped making lists. I am free!\\u201d I was horrified. My beloved list book gently guides my days, boasting all of my tasks and accomplishments. After my friend\\u2019s internet bill went unpaid and her sink pipe rusted through, I was secretly pleased. Then I got the flu. I lacked energy to write in my list book. I lay lost, hopeless, listless, thinking of everything I could be doing. Then one morning I awoke and reached for my list book \\u2014 a clear and happy sign that I was on the mend. \\u2014 Janet McGiffin\"]","href_hash":"26c20700521b11ec8216d5294fcde0e3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"26c20700521b11ec8216d5294fcde0e3"}},
