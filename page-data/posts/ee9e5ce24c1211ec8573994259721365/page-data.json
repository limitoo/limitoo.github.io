More than 400 million goats, 500 million sheep, and a whopping 1.5 billion pigs.\", \"But all these pale in comparison to the humble chicken: every year, we eat more than 50 billion chickens.\", \"Part of the reason for this is modern farming practices. Chickens are small and can be farmed for meat in great numbers, which means chicken meat is (relatively) cheap and plenty of people can buy it.\", \"But increasingly, those modern farming practices are coming under scrutiny.\\u00a0\", \"Today on The Detail, Emile Donovan speaks to RNZ\\u2019s Farah Hancock about a jarring video which shows the reality of life for chickens bred for their meat in this country, and a commitment from a big industry player which could change the nature of chicken farming in Aotearoa.\", \"The video was supplied to RNZ by animal activist group Animals Aotearoa.\", \"It shows the unpalatable reality of life for a meat chicken in New Zealand, with hundreds of chickens standing wing-to-wing in a dark barn.\", \"Many of the chickens don\\u2019t look especially healthy, with patchy feathers and some barely able to walk \\u2013 though poultry industry representatives say inferences shouldn\\u2019t be drawn from the video, which they say may have been selectively edited to look as bad as possible.\\u00a0\", \"But Animals Aotearoa says it raises questions about baseline chicken welfare in New Zealand, and whether the high-volume intensive farming of chickens for meat is conscionable at a time when countries overseas are taking steps which may reduce productivity, but are likely in the best interest of the chickens.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/280279/eight_col_AA-meat-chickens_004.jpg?1637009410\\\" alt=\\\"A screengrab from footage released to RNZ by Animals Aotearoa from inside a free range meat chicken farm.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPhoto: Supplied / Animals Aotearoa\\n</div>\", \"One of those steps is the types of chickens that are used: in New Zealand, two types of chicken are bred for their meat, Cobb and Ross.\", \"These are both \\u2018fast-growing\\u2019 chickens \\u2013 meaning they go from being hatched to being slaughtered in four to six weeks.\", \"They\\u2019ve been specially bred to grow quickly and produce a lot of breast meat, but their rapid growth can lead to complications, such as growing too fast for their legs to handle, rendering them lame. \\u00a0\", \"Slower-growing chickens, which are used in places like France, Sweden and Denmark, take about two weeks longer to reach maturity, but aren\\u2019t available at scale in New Zealand, due in part to strict biosecurity laws.\\u00a0\", \"They are more expensive to produce, but animal activists say their quality of life is much better.\", \"Last week, fast food giant Dominos committed to switching from using fast-growing chicken to using only slow-growing chickens by 2026, saying it was the right thing to do and it hoped other outlets would follow suit.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re the first and only company in New Zealand \\u2013 and they\\u2019re challenging other companies to follow their lead\\u201d, says Farah Hancock.\", \"\\u201cThey say, \\u2018it\\u2019s happening overseas, it\\u2019s probably going to happen here, so we may as well get out and do it now\\u2019.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s actually quite (a) big (deal) \\u2026 once they\\u2019ve started that, it means the slower-growing breed will be established in New Zealand, and other companies that want to use them, it\\u2019ll be a lot easier to get hold of them.\\u201d\", \"The introduction of slow-growing chickens would have repercussions: production costs can be up to 25 percent more expensive, and this cost would invariably be passed on to consumers.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cA lot of meat has become more expensive\\u201d, says Hancock.\", \"\\u201cChicken and pork hasn\\u2019t.
