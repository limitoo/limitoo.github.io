Their documentary follows Joy Womack, an American ballet dancer who moved alone to Moscow at 15 with aspirations of joining the Bolshoi Ballet. After achieving that goal, she quit the company and made international headlines in 2013 saying that she was told she would have to pay a bribe for a solo role. (She subsequently joined the Kremlin Ballet.)\", \"Drawn from seven years of shooting, the documentary charts Womack\\u2019s life in Russia, where she says success is more elusive than in the United States. In the U.S., she says, \\u201cIf you\\u2019re a hard worker, you can make it happen,\\u201d but in Russia, \\u201cit\\u2019s like if you do not have the aesthetic, forget about it, just don\\u2019t even try it.\\u201d The film observes her efforts to reconcile what a ballet critic in the film calls a Broadway style with the Russian style. Womack also has to dance and medicate through injuries. Less than two minutes in, the movie shows her going for an M.R.I.\", \"To a degree, Womack\\u2019s audacious career path has been shoehorned into a conventional profile format. The directors might have done more to illuminate Womack\\u2019s offstage life (you\\u2019re left wondering if she learned to speak Russian overnight), although they do chronicle the struggles of a marriage she entered into in apparent sincerity, while also knowing it would help her obtain permission to stay in Russia. Womack comes across as incredibly adaptable, which may be the film\\u2019s ultimate point.\"]","href_hash":"e1c5cf9f58e911ec860041a44871c280"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e1c5cf9f58e911ec860041a44871c280"}},
