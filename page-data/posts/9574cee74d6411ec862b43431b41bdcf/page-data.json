It wasn't even a thing.\\\"\", \"The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says that for healthy couples in their 20s and early 30s, around one in four women will get pregnant in any single menstrual cycle. Those chances become less by age 40 where around one in 10 women will get pregnant per menstrual cycle.\", \"ACOG says that a man's fertility also declines with age though it's not as predictable.\", \"She said it was not until three years ago when a new OBGYN, Dr. Carolyn Harraway-Smith Cone Health Women's Hospital asked \\u2014 for the first time \\u2014 if she had any concerns or questions.\", \"\\\"Because she asked it, I mentioned that we hadn't gotten pregnant, and she said, 'OK, we can work on that',\\\" Susie told GMA.\", \"Dr. Smith then referred Susie to a reproductive endocrinologist who discovered she had fibroids that would need to be surgically removed. Despite their removal, she was told that she and her husband would still not be able to get pregnant naturally, GMA reported, because of her age and because of health complications on her husband's side.\", \"After a few rounds of IVF, which costs thousands of dollars per treatment, the couple did not produce a viable embryo so they decided to try egg donation.\", \"Egg donation can happen when a donor has their eggs medically removed from their ovaries. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, \\\"once the eggs are removed, they are evaluated by an embryologist. Then sperm from the male partner or a sperm bank is placed around or injected into each egg.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939838/pregnant-couple.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A North Carolina couple is celebrating the birth of their new baby after years of struggling with infertility.
