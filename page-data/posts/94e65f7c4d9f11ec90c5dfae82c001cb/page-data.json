(She is also nominated as a songwriter on Rodrigo\\u2019s \\u201cSour.\\u201d) West\\u2019s nomination for \\u201cDonda\\u201d brought his career total to 75.\", \"It was possible to discover which artists benefited from the expansion because their names were absent from an early version of the \\u201cfinal nominations list\\u201d that had been created several days before the announcement and included only eight names in those categories. That version had begun circulating outside the Recording Academy before the nominations were announced on Tuesday, and a copy of it was obtained by The New York Times.\", \"The expansion in the top categories comes after the academy has trumpeted a new era of openness and transparency in its awards process. The 64th annual Grammys will be the first in more than 30 years without the use of anonymous nomination review committees, which were charged with whittling down voters\\u2019 choices to create the final ballot \\u2014 a step that was intended to safeguard the awards\\u2019 integrity but was accused of allowing manipulation behind the scenes.\", \"Mason defended the move to add more nominees as a sign of a newly nimble, responsive Recording Academy, and said that the added names brought new sounds, styles and faces to the top categories. \\u201cFor us this is all positive movement,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThis is us honoring more great artists, more great music, giving artists an opportunity to shine and showcase.\\u201d\", \"Mason said that the artists added to the list were simply the ninth and tenth most voted by the academy\\u2019s members, and were determined by Deloitte, the academy\\u2019s longtime partner in collecting and tabulating votes.\", \"In the record of the year category, Lil Nas X\\u2019s \\u201cMontero (Call Me by Your Name)\\u201d and Abba\\u2019s \\u201cI Still Have Faith in You\\u201d joined tracks by Rodrigo, Bieber, Bennett and Gaga, Batiste, Doja Cat, Eilish, Silk Sonic and Brandi Carlile. This was Abba\\u2019s first-ever Grammy nomination.\", \"For song of the year, which recognizes songwriters, the change brought in Doja Cat\\u2019s \\u201cKiss Me More,\\u201d which features SZA, and \\u201cRight on Time\\u201d by Carlile, who was already on the list for another song, \\u201cA Beautiful Noise,\\u201d with Alicia Keys. Best new artist added the rapper Baby Keem and the Pakistani American composer and vocalist Arooj Aftab.\", \"Representatives for each of the added artists declined to comment.\", \"As recently as the 2018 Grammys, there were only five slots in the top field. In an interview on Wednesday, Mason said that the expansion had been considered for years, but that this year\\u2019s change was inspired by his visit last week to the Latin Grammys, at which as many as 12 artists competed in some top categories. He said he and his team moved quickly to propose and implement the change.\", \"\\u201cIt lines up perfectly everything that we\\u2019ve been trying to do in the last year in a half,\\u201d Mason said, \\u201cwhich is to honor excellence in music, serve our music community, and do it in a thoughtful but proactive way.\\u201d\", \"Valeisha Butterfield Jones, the academy\\u2019s co-president, added, \\u201cWhile it may seem rushed, it really was a thoughtful, well intentioned process that was also data-driven,\\u201d pointing to internal numbers that showed an increase in voting by its members.\", \"The revelation that nomination lists were expanded on the eve of their release \\u2014 unbeknown to voters until the full ballot was announced \\u2014 is the latest twist in the Grammys\\u2019 tumultuous recent history, with the academy\\u2019s last chief dismissed after accusing the institution\\u2019s leadership of rampant conflicts of interest and of covering up accusations of sexual harassment and rape.\", \"The move to end the nomination review committees for the 2022 Grammys came after years of complaints by artists, especially Black musicians in rap and R&B, who said they had been relegated to the genre categories but not ultimately recognized in the four general field awards.\", \"Ahead of the most recent Grammys ceremony, the pop star the Weeknd \\u2014 who received no nominations for his top-selling album, \\u201cAfter Hours\\u201d \\u2014 said he would boycott the awards in the future, calling the Grammys \\u201ccorrupt.\\u201d\", \"The academy said that without the committees this year, the artists who appeared on the final ballot were those who got the most votes from their music industry peers, and that the expansion to 10 nominees from eight in the top four categories was made without knowing which artists would benefit.\", \"The winners will be determined by votes from the 11,000 members of the Recording Academy, who must qualify as working musicians. The ceremony will take place Jan. 31 in Los Angeles.\", \"Mason also said that the addition of Swift and West \\u2014 superstars in their own right, whose rivalry is a perennial media spectacle \\u2014 was solely a matter of the votes they received and that they were not selected for their appeal on the Grammys\\u2019 television show.\", \"\\u201cA thousand percent no,\\u201d Mason said. \\u201cThat was not a consideration.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"94e65f7c4d9f11ec90c5dfae82c001cb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"94e65f7c4d9f11ec90c5dfae82c001cb"}},
