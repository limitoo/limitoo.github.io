Currently 17 people die every day in the US waiting for a transplant, with more than 100,000 reportedly on the waiting list.\", \"The possibility of using animal organs for so-called xenotransplantation to meet the demand has long been considered, and using pig heart valves is already common.\", \"In October 2021, surgeons in New York announced that they had successfully transplanted a pig's kidney into a person.

However, the recipient on that occasion was brain dead with no hope of recovery.\", \"-BBC\"]","href_hash":"71a262b8a0a111ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"71a262b8a0a111ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
