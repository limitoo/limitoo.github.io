Since then, the Brooklyn-based dance punks have reunited to headline festivals, tour internationally and release the 2017 album \\u201cAmerican Dream,\\u201d which expanded their repertoire of self-conscious yet body-friendly bangers. Still, the band\\u2019s history of self-termination produces a nagging sense that when the frontman James Murphy sings, \\u201cThis could be the last time,\\u201d in their hit \\u201cAll My Friends,\\u201d he might finally mean it.\", \"As of now, there are at least 15 more opportunities to see LCD Soundsystem live. The band is posting up at Brooklyn Steel for their first New York shows in four years \\u2014 a 20-date residency that began on Nov. 23 and continues this weekend. On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the concert begins at 8 p.m.; verified resale tickets are available (for a pretty penny) at bowerypresents.com.OLIVIA HORN\", \"After more than a year away from the stage, the extraordinary drag performers BenDeLaCreme and Jinkx Monsoon are back where they belong with \\u201cThe Return of the Jinkx & DeLa Holiday Show, LIVE!,\\u201d a new musical spectacle in which they share their unique brand of glittery Christmas cheer.\", \"The duo\\u2019s touring show, their biggest yet, makes a stop at the Town Hall on Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. (tickets start at $27). It features some of their beloved songs and fabulous costume changes, as well as their irreverent commentary on surviving the apocalypse just in time for the holidays.\", \"The show, co-written by DeLa and Jinkx, highlights what they do best: dissect and subvert popular culture and tradition in order to create a fresher, more inclusive sense of community. DeLa\\u2019s caustic Donna Reed-ness and Jinkx\\u2019s Joan Crawford-meets-Rosalind Russell quips are sure to lift your spirits and make you howl with laughter. Expect more naughty than nice.JOSE SOL\\u00cdS\", \"The shopping season is upon us, that grueling holiday tradition. Thankfully, a potent antidote arrived this week in Brooklyn in the form of Big Dance Theater\\u2019s \\u201cThe Mood Room,\\u201d created by Annie-B Parson. The new hourlong work, presented by Brooklyn Academy of Music in association with the Kitchen, features an all-female cast and takes inspiration from Guy de Cointet\\u2019s 1982 play, \\u201cFive Sisters,\\u201d a critique of consumerism filtered through Reagan-era California wellness culture.\", \"Parson\\u2019s inventive movement \\u2014 at once surprising and relatable \\u2014 is currently on display on Broadway as a crucial and celebrated ingredient in David Byrne\\u2019s \\u201cAmerican Utopia.\\u201d In \\u201cThe Mood Room,\\u201d that pointed physicality anchors her storytelling, which also mixes in spoken text from Chekhov\\u2019s \\u201cThree Sisters\\u201d and soap operas, as well as an electronic score by Holly Herndon. The remaining shows through Sunday at BAM Fisher have sold out online, but the box office will be releasing a block of tickets each day. Call 718-636-4100 for availability. Also, a standby line will form 90 minutes before each performance.BRIAN SCHAEFER\", \"Whether she\\u2019s playing in a free-improvisation duo or notating compositions like \\u201cEight Pieces for the Vernal Equinox,\\u201d the pianist Kris Davis has proved to be a reliable bet in recent seasons. Her latest project is the multimedia effort \\u201cSuite Charri\\u00e8re.\\u201d It introduces a new Davis-led ensemble as well as fresh works from the composer\\u2019s pen \\u2014 all in response to excerpts from films by the artist Julian Charri\\u00e8re.\", \"The suite will be performed this Saturday \\u2014 along with its cinematic accompaniment \\u2014 at 8 p.m. at Roulette in Brooklyn. (Tickets start at $20; the concert will also be livestreamed free on the club\\u2019s website.) Davis\\u2019s recent track record is not the only aspect that is promising; her chosen collaborators for this date are, too. In addition to the composer herself on piano, her septet includes Angelica Sanchez on a Moog synthesizer, the violist Mat Maneri and the trumpeter Taylor Ho Bynum \\u2014 all of whom possess distinctive profiles as interpreters.SETH COLTER WALLS\", \"Hanukkah commemorates finding a small amount of oil, which the Jewish Maccabees used to rededicate the temple in Jerusalem after they defeated the Syrian Greeks in the second century B.C. Sufficient for only one day, the oil miraculously burned for eight.\", \"On Sunday (Hanukkah ends Monday evening), children visiting the Jewish Museum in Manhattan will also go on a faith-related quest, not for oil but for intriguing menorahs. This experience will shed light, too.\", \"Included in museum admission (free for ages 18 and under), the Hanukkah Hunt drop-in gallery program runs from 10:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. (Timed-entry tickets, however, are required.) Participants will receive an information sheet with photographs of four lamps in the exhibition \\u201cAccumulations: Hanukkah Lamps.\\u201d They range from an 1885 Eastern European model consisting of eight dollhouse-size lead chairs to the artist Karim Rashid\\u2019s 2004 silicone and stainless-steel \\u201cMenorahmorph,\\u201d which resembles a series of hot-pink volcanoes.\", \"Little visitors will also search for an early-20th-century silver lamp, resplendent with carved lions and turquoise and carnelian stones; and Peter Shire\\u2019s 1986 \\u201cMenorah #7,\\u201d a painted-metal creation that doubles as a modernist sculpture.\", \"In addition, the museum will dispense fuel for young imaginations: art kits with materials for children to sketch, collage and sculpt their own menorahs.LAUREL GRAEBER\"]","href_hash":"3cce45b8535b11ecae47fb21c8804243"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3cce45b8535b11ecae47fb21c8804243"}},
