Black parents called their children, weeping. Activists choked up, embracing what they called a rare instance of justice.\", \"In a country whose cavernous divides over race, guns and vigilante violence have been on display recently in courtrooms from Kenosha, Wis., to Charlottesville, Va., to Brunswick, Ga., the guilty verdicts on Wednesday against three white men who pursued and killed Ahmaud Arbery were hailed by political leaders and many Americans across the political spectrum.\", \"Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia said he hoped the verdicts would help the country \\u201cmove forward down a path of healing and reconciliation.\\u201d President Biden said the verdict showed the \\u201cjustice system is doing its job,\\u201d but said Mr. Arbery\\u2019s murder and the chilling videotape that recorded it were a measure of the country\\u2019s persistent racial inequities.\", \"The widespread exclamations of support for the jury\\u2019s verdict over what some activists called a 21st-century lynching stood in stark contrast to the deeply polarized response to the acquittal of Kyle Rittenhouse, the white 18-year-old who fatally shot two people during the unrest in Kenosha following the police shooting of a Black man last year.\", \"Many conservatives embraced Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s acquittal last week as a victory for self-defense and gun rights while liberals worried it would encourage armed vigilantism as a response to racial justice protests.\", \"\\u201cThe Kyle Rittenhouse verdict is the America I expect \\u2014 the Arbery verdict is the America I fight for,\\u201d said the Rev. Lenny Duncan, 43, a Black pastor in Portland, Ore., who attended many of the demonstrations that roiled the city last year after the killing of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black Americans.\", \"The conviction of all three defendants charged in Mr. Arbery\\u2019s February 2020 killing \\u2014 Travis McMichael, 35; his father, Gregory McMichael, 65; and their neighbor William Bryan, 52 \\u2014 drew few rebukes or protests.\", \"The lawyers for Travis McMichael told reporters that they respected the jury\\u2019s decision but planned to appeal the verdict, which they described as \\u201cdisappointing and sad.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis is a very difficult day for Travis McMichael and Greg McMichael,\\u201d Jason Sheffield, one of the lawyers, said, adding that both of them \\u201chonestly believe what they were doing was the right thing to do.\\u201d\", \"The men also face federal hate crimes charges and are expected to stand trial on them in February.\", \"The verdict came as a relief to some Black Americans who had watched the trial with sadness and dread. Many had urgently hoped for a guilty verdict, but worried that the overwhelmingly white jury would side with defense lawyers who portrayed the three white defendants as neighbors worried about a rash of crimes in their neighborhood when they took off in pursuit of Mr. Arbery as he ran in the street.\", \"\\u201cThank God for this verdict today,\\u201d said Warren Stewart Jr., a Black clergyman and political activist in Phoenix. \\u201cI started calling a few friends and they\\u2019re crying on the phone. It\\u2019s bittersweet. Having two Black sons, this is scary. This is real life for us.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Stewart\\u2019s 18-year-old son, Micaiah, had been paying rapt attention to the trial, and the family tried to balance its hopes and prayers for a guilty verdict against a long history of high-profile killings of Black men and women that have been declared justified by the legal system.\", \"\\u201cIt happens too often, that they get away with it,\\u201d Micaiah Stewart said. He said Mr. Arbery\\u2019s killing on a public street seemed to confirm his own fears of simply going outside as a young Black man in the United States.\", \"Some Black Americans said the trial had posed a make-or-break test for their frayed trust in the legal system. They said the video showing how an unarmed Black man had been chased, cornered and shot had left little room for doubt in their minds that Mr. Arbery\\u2019s death was murder.\", \"\\u201cWe look forward to the day when it\\u2019s not a question when a person is lynched by a racist that it is murder,\\u201d said Hawk Newsome, the co-founder of Black Lives Matter Greater New York, who called the guilty verdicts a \\u201cpartial victory.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Newsome said the convictions in Mr. Arbery\\u2019s killing juxtaposed against Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s acquittal in the shooting of three white men protesting the police shooting of a Black man added up to a \\u201cmixed message.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYou can\\u2019t outright chase down and murder Black people and those who support them,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut if you make it look like self-defense, you got a shot.\\u201d\", \"In Atlanta, Chris Stewart, a lawyer who has represented several families of Black people killed by white police officers, fought back tears as he reflected on the verdict in Georgia.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s good to see racism lose,\\u201d said Mr. Stewart, whose clients have included the family of Walter Scott, a 50-year-old Black man shot in the back in 2015 by a South Carolina police officer. \\u201cThis case will be remembered for many years. You can\\u2019t overstate how big this is.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Stewart said that had the verdict gone the other way, \\u201cIt would have broken me \\u2014 I would have lost faith in the system.\\u201d He said the jury\\u2019s decision \\u201cshows African Americans that justice is possible.\\u201d\", \"But only sometimes, many said. The three defendants were not arrested until several weeks after the shooting, and only once a video of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s last moments generated nationwide outrage and anger.\", \"\\u201cThey had no choice but to convict them,\\u201d said Wilburt Dawson, 68, as he and a friend sat at Dugan\\u2019s restaurant and bar in Atlanta\\u2019s Old Fourth Ward, reflecting on the verdict.\", \"\\u201cBut without the video none of this happens,\\u201d his friend, Curtis Duren, 64, said. If the men had been acquitted, \\u201cThere would\\u2019ve been such an uprising,\\u201d Mr. Duren said. \\u201cIt would\\u2019ve destroyed the moral fabric of America.\\u201d\", \"In Brunswick, local officials and activists largely heralded the verdict. Allen Booker, a city commissioner who represents a majority of Brunswick\\u2019s Black residents, said he was overjoyed for Mr. Arbery\\u2019s family while acknowledging that nothing could bring Mr. Arbery back.\", \"Bobby Henderson, a co-founder of A Better Glynn, a local organization created in the wake of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s death to push for more diversity in local leadership, said that he was gratified Mr. Arbery\\u2019s family got accountability, but that more work was needed \\u201cto combat the system that failed Ahmaud on that day.\\u201d\", \"The courthouse in Brunswick where the trial unfolded became a scene of tearful celebration.\", \"Outside, where activists and Mr. Arbery\\u2019s supporters embraced and cried and clasped each other\\u2019s hands in a gesture of victory, John Howard, 60, a white man from Hazlehurst, Ga., said that justice had been served.\", \"He called the killing \\u201ca lynching.\\u201d Mr. Howard said it seemed as if race relations were better when he was young. He grew up in the countryside and called his Black elders \\u201cuncle\\u201d and \\u201cauntie.\\u201d The divide now is deeper, he said, but it felt like people were coming together to protest injustice. \\u201cBlack and white citizens are getting fed up with it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEnough is enough.\\u201d\", \"Theawanza Brooks, Mr. Arbery\\u2019s aunt, said, \\u201cThank God\\u201d as the judge read each guilty verdict. Another of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s aunts, Diane Arbery Jackson, simply said, \\u201cThis is amazing.\\u201d\", \"They were both in tears. The day had been emotional, with family members crying when the video of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s killing was replayed for the jury in the morning. At various times during deliberations, those gathered in the overflow room prayed together for a guilty verdict.\", \"As the judge finished reading the verdict, people in the room raised their fists. Mr. Arbery\\u2019s childhood best friend, Akeem Baker, was silent as the verdict was read. His head was bowed and his eyes red from crying. \\u201cI feel better,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"b8e7ac464d8111ecbd0709e27cd75547"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b8e7ac464d8111ecbd0709e27cd75547"}},
