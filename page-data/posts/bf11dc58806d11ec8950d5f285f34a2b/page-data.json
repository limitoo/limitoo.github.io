Under the statute, any money granted in the lawsuit would be split between Mr. Hutchins and his son, she said.\", \"Ms. Hutchins, who was 42 and originally from Ukraine, was an up-and-coming cinematographer whom friends described as talented, spirited and deeply committed to her work.\", \"In the aftermath of the deadly shooting on Oct. 21, several members of the film\\u2019s crew have filed lawsuits against Mr. Baldwin and others associated with the production. Mr. Baldwin, who was starring in the western and was also a producer on it, asserted in a television interview that he was not responsible for the fatal shooting and said that he had not pulled the trigger, suggesting that the gun could have gone off after he pulled back the hammer. His lawyers filed a motion on Monday calling for a lawsuit filed against him by the film\\u2019s script supervisor, Mamie Mitchell, to be dismissed.\", \"Officials in New Mexico are still examining how a live bullet got on set and then into the gun that Mr. Baldwin was practicing with and whether anyone should be held criminally responsible.\"]","href_hash":"bf11dc58806d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bf11dc58806d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
