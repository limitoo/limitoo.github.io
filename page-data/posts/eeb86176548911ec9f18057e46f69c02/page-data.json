As our colleagues Lynsey Chutel and Richard P\\u00e9rez-Pe\\u00f1a noted, that means it could potentially erase a layer of defense that humanity has won slowly and at immense cost.\", \"A week into Omicron\\u2019s documented rise, there\\u2019s still a lot we don\\u2019t know. The new variant is a reminder that dealing with uncertainty will be a regular part of our lives in the pandemic era.\", \"\\u201cWhat\\u2019s so difficult about this particular moment is that many of us had been feeling some relief after getting vaccinated and boosted, having our children back in school, and seeing our friends and family members again,\\u201d my colleague Christina Caron, a reporter covering mental health, said. \\u201cBut now there\\u2019s this sense of \\u2018Oh great, here we go again.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"I spoke to Christina to help us make sense of the moment and for tips for dealing with uncertainty.\", \"What are the consequences of having so much that is newly unknown?\", \"My colleagues and I on the Well desk were recently discussing how many of us are having \\u201cworry burnout.\\u201d At this point, nearly two years into the pandemic, there\\u2019s a sense of whiplash from the nonstop news cycle \\u2014 not to mention the ever-changing public health guidance. It\\u2019s challenging to continually try to assess what risks you or your family are willing to take.\", \"Are there lessons from earlier in the pandemic that apply to this moment?\", \"I think a big one is that the scientific process takes time. It can be fluid and unpredictable, and our understanding of the virus is continually changing. We cannot expect quick answers tied up neatly with a bow, and as hard as it is, we need to exercise patience.\", \"Uncertainty has always been a part of our lives in one way or another, but it\\u2019s difficult to imagine a time when it has taken center stage in this many ways for such an extended period of time. I can\\u2019t speak for anyone else, but what has helped me become more comfortable is to try to focus on the here and now. It\\u2019s a clich\\u00e9, but the concept of taking it one day at a time and living in the moment has become essential, because it can be overwhelming to fixate on what might happen in the future.\", \"What are your other tips for dealing with uncertainty?\", \"Practice mindfulness. Meditation can teach you that while there will always be external stressors, you don\\u2019t need to be dominated by those problems. Being mindful can help you remember to return to the present when you become distracted, which can be useful in curbing ruminative thoughts. [Here\\u2019s a guide to mediating.]\", \"Cultivate \\u201cflow.\\u201d The state of mind where you become so engaged that time seems to fall away is also useful during periods of uncertainty. Flow doesn\\u2019t come when you passively watch TV or listen to music. It\\u2019s more of a blend between work and play. For some people, things like yoga or gardening might generate flow. For others, it might be a jigsaw puzzle or cooking an elaborate meal.\", \"Focus on what you can control. When the news of Omicron surfaced, I was initially very concerned, and the continual churn of anxious thoughts became exhausting. Most of my worries centered on my daughter, who recently turned 5. So I decided to get her some better fitting masks because I noticed her current ones kept slipping down her nose. Then I scheduled an appointment for her second dose of the Covid vaccine. Those two simple actions helped me feel calmer.\", \"We asked readers how they were approaching this next phase of unpredictability: \", \"\\u201cAt this point, I\\u2019m desensitized to Covid news. I no longer have the energy to get worked up about a new variant. I\\u2019m vaccinated and boosted and am trying to live my life in this new normal. I now view the dangers of Covid like driving in a car: I put on my seatbelt, wear my mask and continue on with my life.\\u201d \\u2014 Cecelia, Indianapolis\", \"\\u201cUntil we have more information about Omicron, I think it\\u2019s better to be as cautious as possible. So for me it feels like going back to the very beginning of the pandemic. I have three vaccinations, and I hope that\\u2019s helping at least partially against Omicron. I have reduced the contacts outside my family to a minimum.\\u201d \\u2014 Wolfgang Lynen, Munich\", \"\\u201cI have never felt this burned out, tapped out and weighed down. I\\u2019d be mad at the folks who still believe this isn\\u2019t real, and that vaccines are suspect, but I just can\\u2019t summon the energy. I\\u2019ll be staying close to home, practicing as much low-cost self-care as I can and working on projects around the house \\u2014 again. Groan.\\u201d \\u2014 Boleyn H. Willis, Durham, N.C.\", \"\\u201cOrdered more comfortable N95 masks that perform well in lab tests. Making list of things to stockpile if Omicron disrupts the supply chain. Going out now because I may not later. I will adjust my plans to perceived risk when more is known.\\u201d \\u2014 Alan Drake, New Orleans\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m no longer OK with putting my life fully on hold, and I\\u2019m not exactly sure how I\\u2019ll cope if things continue to go downhill. I\\u2019m 37 and it\\u2019s clich\\u00e9, but I\\u2019m in the prime of my life. I struggled last winter, and dread feeling that way again. But I am vaccinated and have received the booster, so for now I\\u2019ll just cope by continuing to live as I have been and hope to someday see the light at the end of the tunnel.\\u201d \\u2014 Michelle Craren, New York, N.Y.\", \"\\u201cI feel pandemic fatigue setting in deeply. Where I once was \\u201call in\\u201d for wearing masks and vaccination, I find myself more and more irritated with the media hype about ongoing Covid developments. I am becoming more skeptical and hopeless. In order to cope, I will get my family boosted and continue to wear a mask. But I wonder if my son will ever get to go to school without a mask. I wonder if my daughter\\u2019s wedding in May 2022 will be hindered by Covid. Is herd immunity not a thing? When will this end?\\u201d \\u2014 Emily, Boise, Idaho\", \"\\u201cAs someone who lives with chronic illness, I\\u2019ve never known a life of certainty. I feel like the rest of the world is getting a poignant look into what it\\u2019s like to live with chronic conditions. I plan for success as much as I can \\u2014 wear a mask, get boosted, maybe don\\u2019t go to that indoor concert, be honest with friends and family about my safety plan \\u2014 and then be ready to pivot as necessary. I might not be living the life I imagined, but I\\u2019m still living, and that\\u2019s still something pretty extraordinary, don\\u2019t you think?\\u201d \\u2014 Anna Peshock, Louisville, Colo.\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic.
