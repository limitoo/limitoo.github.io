Slalom requires aggressiveness, agility, quickness and combines relatively high speed and technical difficulty. The many gates that provide a lot of direction changes should be set to provide an interesting combination of single and multiple gates, which provide a good test of a wide variety of skiing skills. Slalom events are held in two runs on separate courses. The skier with the best combined time from two separate runs is declared the winner.\", \"Giant Slalom\", \"Giant Slalom consists of two runs over separate courses, which may be on the same slope. Giant Slalom presents a range of long, medium and tight turns, which require strength, and a good sense of rhythm. The course is to be set to make optimum use of the variations in terrain and full use of the width of the hill, to increase the spectacle of the event.\", \"Super-G\", \"Super Giant Slalom (Super-G) is a single run over a long course, which combines the speed of Downhill and some of the technical characteristics of the Giant Slalom. It requires the skier to be very precise at high speeds. It combines a variety of long and medium turns on courses that have vertical drops only slightly less steep than in Downhill.\", \"Downhill\", \"Downhill races feature the greatest vertical drop of all the Alpine disciplines, with skiers reaching speeds of up to 130 kilometres per hour on a typical World Cup Downhill course. In Downhill the racer must demonstrate excellent technique, agility, continuous concentration, marked endurance and physical fitness and a high level of courage.\", \"Courses are long with control gates strategically placed so that considerable speed will be maintained through challenging turns, shallow dips, flats, and small airs.\", \"Alpine Combined\", \"Consisting of a shortened Downhill or Super-G run followed by a Slalom run, Alpine Combined combines a speed event with a technical event to showcase overall skiing skills. Introduced by the International Ski Federation in 2005, Alpine Combined is generally referred to as the fifth alpine skiing discipline.\", \"Rules\", \"If a skier misses a gate, he or she is disqualified from the competition, unless he or she hikes uphill and successfully passes through the missed gate.
