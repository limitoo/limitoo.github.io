Opponents say the changes will debase the 850-year-old cathedral and disturb the harmony of its Gothic design.\", \"The heritage commission also authorized cathedral administrators to rearrange the tabernacle and other items to create more room for visitors. Msgr. Patrick Chauvet, Notre-Dame\\u2019s rector, said the proposals would allow for an easier and more pleasant visit to the religious monument and create \\u201ca dialogue\\u201d between Notre-Dame\\u2019s medieval architecture and new, more modern features.\", \"Artworks from the 20th and 21st centuries could be placed next to old master paintings from the cathedral\\u2019s collection, such as Mathieu Le Nain\\u2019s \\u201cNativity of the Virgin Mary,\\u201d Chauvet said.\", \"He added that the diocese was also considering light projections on the walls of some chapels that would display short text excerpts from the Bible.\", \"Most of the confessionals would be moved to the first floor in the rearrangement of the cathedral\\u2019s 2,000 or so furniture items, Chauvet said, and Notre-Dame\\u2019s more than 12 million annual visitors would now enter through the central portal instead of via a side door.\", \"\\u201cThe idea is that the faithful, or visitors, are first struck by the grandeur, by the beauty of Notre-Dame,\\u201d Chauvet said.\", \"Yet the addition of modern touches threatens to disfigure the cathedral, according to dozens of cultural figures and intellectuals who have stood up against the proposals.\", \"Notre-Dame has already gone through more than two years of careful restoration efforts, after a blaze tore through it in April 2019, destroying the spire and most of the roof. The building has now been secured enough to start the rebuilding process, which is expected to be completed just in time for the 2024 Olympics in Paris.\", \"French authorities initially contemplated seizing the opportunity to significantly rework the cathedral\\u2019s architecture. Heritage experts eventually recommended that the monument be restored to its prior state and, last year, President Emmanuel Macron dropped the idea to replace the 19th-century spire with something more contemporary.\", \"On Tuesday, about 100 public figures in France signed their names to an open letter in the conservative newspaper Le Figaro titled \\u201cNotre-Dame de Paris: What the fire spared, the diocese wants to destroy.\\u201d\", \"The signatories, who include Alain Finkielkraut and Pierre Nora from the prestigious Acad\\u00e9mie Fran\\u00e7aise, said some proposals recalled \\u201c\\u2018immersive\\u2019 cultural projects where, often, inanity vies with kitsch.\\u201d\", \"Le Monde newspaper said the proposals had led to a fierce battle within the French Catholic Church between \\u201cadvocates of modernity and ecumenism and the guardians of a nostalgic conservatism.\\u201d\", \"Some conservative British newspapers seized on passages in the redevelopment plan about creating \\u201cemotional spaces\\u201d and \\u201ca discovery tour.\\u201d A headline in The Daily Telegraph said that Notre-Dame faced a \\u201cwoke Disney revamp.\\u201d\", \"Didier Rykner, the editor in chief of the art magazine La Tribune de l\\u2019Art and one of the signatories of the open letter in Le Figaro, said that criticism in the British press was based on caricatures, but that he agreed with their general thrust.\", \"\\u201cThe church is 2,000 years old \\u2014 it is an old lady,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt has a history that we must respect, that today\\u2019s people cannot erase with a stroke of the pen.\\u201d\", \"The heritage commission may have heard some of the criticism. It did not accept the proposal put before it by the diocese in full, and rejected or questioned some elements. The committee denied a request, for instance, to remove statues of saints from several chapels. It also asked for a review of a design for removable benches that were proposed as a replacement for the cathedral\\u2019s traditional wooden chairs, according to a statement issued Thursday by the minister of culture.\", \"Chauvet said that the changes to Notre-Dame\\u2019s interior were not revolutionary and would only \\u201cbring a little more sense to the visitors.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cDon\\u2019t think we\\u2019re going to make Disneyland,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"6c32245459e711ec9cd9d9c1f84dbad9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6c32245459e711ec9cd9d9c1f84dbad9"}},
