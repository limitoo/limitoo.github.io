That order has not yet taken effect.\\u00a0\", \"First instituted in March 2020, the Title 42 policy allows U.S. immigration authorities to expel migrants to Mexico or their home country without screening them for asylum or allowing them to see a judge. Over 1.5 million migrant expulsions have been carried out so far, according to government data.\", \"The Biden administration has retained the Title 42 expulsions, arguing they are needed to curb the spread of the coronavirus inside border detention facilities. Under Mr. Biden, U.S. border officials have used Title 42 to expel most single adult migrants and some families traveling with minors.\\u00a0\", \"But the Biden administration has declined to expel unaccompanied children, who have special legal protections under U.S. law. Instead, officials have been transferring unaccompanied children to shelters overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, as mandated by a 2008 anti-trafficking law.\\u00a0\", \"After entering HHS custody, unaccompanied children remain in government care until they are placed with sponsors, typically family members in the U.S. To remain in the U.S. permanently, they can seek asylum or other immigrant benefits, such as visas for abused, neglected or abandoned youth.\", \"On Friday, Pittman said the Biden administration failed to properly justify the Centers for Disease and Control Prevention orders that codified the Title 42 exemption for unaccompanied minors last summer, calling them \\\"arbitrary and capricious\\\" and in violation of federal administrative law.\", \"Texas, Pittman argued, has been harmed financially by the Title 42 exemptions because of costs associated with schooling and medical services for migrant children who have relocated to the state.\", \"It's unclear if the administration will start to expel unaccompanied minors in light of Friday's court order. During the Trump administration, nearly 16,000 unaccompanied children were expelled under Title 42 before a federal judge blocked the practice in November 2020, calling it illegal.\", \"Representatives for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) did not immediately respond to requests to explain how it would comply with Friday's court order.\", \"Pittman suspended his order for seven days to give the government time to appeal. The Justice Department, which would file the appeal, did not respond to a request for comment.\", \"Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News. Based in Washington, he covers immigration policy and politics.\"]","href_hash":"fd571f889c1911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fd571f889c1911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
