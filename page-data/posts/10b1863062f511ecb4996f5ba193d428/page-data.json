This completes the first tunnel drive,\\\" City Rail Link CEO Sean Sweeney says.\", \"That drive started at Mt Eden in May, broke into Karangahape station in October and has now finished next to Aotea square just in time for Christmas.\", \"\\\"It's a great credit to the team that we have broken through two months prior to what we were expecting,\\\" Auckland Mayor Phil Goff says.\", \"Dubbed Dame Whina Cooper, the tunnelling machine's cut into the earth, removed spoil to the surface and installed concrete panels on the walls.\", \"It's all part of a project that will create a 3.5km link between Britomart and Mt Eden.\", \"When fully operational 54,000 passengers an hour will use City Rail Link stations at peak times with Aotea destined to be New Zealand's busiest.\", \"But that won't be for some time yet.

That's unheard of in New Zealand,\\\" Sweeney says.\", \"\\\"Three years ago when we were doing the planning for this job we were predicting 2 percent a year.\\\"\", \"So has the $4.4 billion budget blown?\", \"\\\"I wouldn't go that far yet,\\\" Sweeney says.\", \"A cost too for businesses above the tunnel who have lost customers and income due to construction and road closures.\", \"\\\"The current compensation package is in place for two years and we have always said towards the end of that period we would then review and have appropriate compensation going forward,\\\" Wood says.\", \"Engineers are getting ready to reassemble the machine at Mount Eden where they'll turn it around and start boring a second tunnel next year.\\u00a0\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"10b1863062f511ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"10b1863062f511ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
