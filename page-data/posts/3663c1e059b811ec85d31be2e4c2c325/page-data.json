Andrew M. Cuomo of sexual harassment.\", \"His resignation, which goes into effect on Jan. 14, marked a spectacular fall for yet another of Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s allies amid the multiple scandals that led to the former governor\\u2019s resignation in August.\", \"Mr. Malatras faced bipartisan backlash and mounting criticism over the past two weeks after Letitia James, the state attorney general, released new evidence from her office\\u2019s investigation into Mr. Cuomo. \", \"The new materials included text messages from May 2019 between Mr. Malatras and top Cuomo officials disparaging Lindsey Boylan, a former economic development official who 18 months later accused Mr. Cuomo of sexual harassment.\", \"At the time, Ms. Boylan, who left the Cuomo administration on acrimonious terms, had criticized the governor\\u2019s office\\u2019s paid family leave policies on Twitter, setting off a clash between Mr. Malatras and Ms. Boylan on the social media platform.\", \"The public feud spilled over into a private text chain among members of Cuomo\\u2019s inner circle. In one text to the group, Mr. Malatras wrote, \\u201cMalatras to Boylan:,\\u201d followed by an obscenity. In another text message, Mr. Malatras wrote, \\u201cLet\\u2019s release some of her cray emails!\\u201d Cray is slang for crazy.\", \"The messages, released in late November, prompted an outcry from the governing bodies representing the system\\u2019s students and faculty, as well as from a growing group of state legislators, who called on the university\\u2019s board of trustees to remove Mr. Malatras.\", \"He had apologized for the text messages last week, saying: \\u201cMy words were inappropriate, disrespectful and wrong.\\u201d\", \"As Mr. Malatras became increasingly embattled, the SUNY board of trustees had released a statement of support, and Merryl Tisch, the board\\u2019s chairwoman, had tried to intervene by talking to legislators in an attempt to stave off additional calls for his resignation. Unions representing the university\\u2019s employees also publicly backed Mr. Malatras.\", \"Mr. Malatras\\u2019s allies had defended his actions by pointing out that he sent the text messages about 18 months before Ms. Boylan first accused Mr. Cuomo of sexual harassment. Mr. Malatras was also not among the Cuomo surrogates involved in the effort to retaliate against Ms. Boylan months later by leaking her personnel file to reporters, according to the state attorney general\\u2019s report.\", \"In the end, however, Mr. Malatras said the recent controversies had created an insurmountable \\u201cdistraction.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe recent events surrounding me over the past week have become a distraction over the important work that needs to be accomplished as SUNY emerges from Covid-19,\\u201d he wrote in a letter to SUNY\\u2019s Board of Trustees. \\u201cI believe deeply in an individual\\u2019s ability to evolve, change, and grow, but I also believe deeply in SUNY and would never want to be an impediment to its success.\\u201d\", \"The controversy around Mr. Malatras had grown into a political headache for Gov. Kathy Hochul, who replaced Mr. Cuomo and vowed to bring civility back to Albany by rooting out the bullying tactics that tarnished the Cuomo administration. Ms. Hochul this week had refused to call on Mr. Malatras to resign, saying that only the board of trustees could remove him. \", \"On Thursday, however, Ms. Hochul confirmed reports that she had spoken on Wednesday night to Ms. Tisch about Mr. Malatras\\u2019s future just before he decided to resign.\", \"\\u201cI think people understand that the position of the governor is not to stand out and make proclamations and statements,\\u201d Ms. Hochul said about her reluctance to publicly call on Mr. Malatras to resign. \\u201cI\\u2019m more inclined to work behind the scenes and focus on results, and that is what I\\u2019m going to continue to do.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Hochul\\u2019s attempts to distance herself from Mr. Cuomo have lead to the resignation of nearly all of the officials who were part of Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s inner orbit, including most of his top staff, as well as his inspector general and health commissioner. Mr. Malatras had been one of the last holdovers.\", \"As chancellor, Mr. Malatras was tasked with overseeing one of the country\\u2019s largest higher education systems, comprising nearly 400,000 students across 64 campuses, and widely credited with successfully spearheading its operations amid the coronavirus pandemic.\", \"Mr. Malatras was appointed chancellor by the system\\u2019s board of trustees \\u2014 most of whom are appointed by the governor, with approval from the State Senate \\u2014 in August 2020 after the previous chancellor, Kristina M. Johnson, resigned to become president of Ohio State University.\", \"Citing the urgency of responding to the pandemic, the board did not conduct a broad, national search for a chancellor as in the past, an approach that was criticized by some board members, as well as students and faculty.\", \"Others debated whether Mr. Malatras\\u2019s close ties to Mr. Cuomo would erode SUNY\\u2019s independence or if his relationship with the governor and his experience in state government would bring more resources to the university.\", \"Mr. Malatras, who received a $450,000 salary plus a $60,000-a-year housing allowance, became the first SUNY graduate to be named chancellor. He nonetheless drew scrutiny for his lack of academic leadership compared to past chancellors, many of whom had presided over large universities before taking over SUNY.\", \"Mr. Malatras began working as a policy adviser to Mr. Cuomo in 2007 when Mr. Cuomo was state attorney general, later serving as the former governor\\u2019s director of state operations, a top role tasked with overseeing the state\\u2019s day-to-day operations.\", \"He also served as vice chancellor and chief of staff to a former SUNY chancellor, Nancy Zimpher, for about a year, until late 2014. In 2017, he was appointed president of the Rockefeller Institute of Government, a SUNY-affiliated think tank. And in 2019, the SUNY board appointed him president of Empire State College in Saratoga Springs, which has about 10,000 students.\", \"Mr. Malatras was part of a group of trusted advisers that Mr. Cuomo temporarily recruited to lead the state\\u2019s coronavirus response in early 2020, turning him into a fixture during Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s daily coronavirus briefings. (When introducing him, Mr. Cuomo would frequently poke fun at Mr. Malatras, who holds a Ph.D in political science, saying he was \\u201cnot a real doctor.\\u201d)\", \"Hailed as a problem solver and for his vast knowledge of the state\\u2019s bureaucracy, Mr. Malatras belonged to the close circle of officials who, to varying degrees, became enmeshed in many of the controversies that led to Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s downfall.\", \"Mr. Malatras, for example, was one of the Cuomo advisers who substantially rewrote the now-infamous report from the Health Department that obscured the true extent of deaths in nursing homes during the pandemic. The version of the report Mr. Malatras edited, however, did not downplay the death toll; that was done by other aides later in the process. \", \"He also helped edit and fact check the book on leadership that Mr. Cuomo wrote during the pandemic, earning the former governor more than $5 million. A recent investigation by the State Assembly found that some Cuomo staffers had worked on the book during government hours, but Mr. Malatras has said he took time off on the work days he volunteered.\", \"Indeed, Mr. Malatras is not mentioned in the 46-page report released by the State Assembly in November that scrutinized many of the scandals that engulfed Mr. Cuomo. He also wasn\\u2019t mentioned or accused of wrongdoing in the 165-page state attorney general report from August that looked at the sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Cuomo and the response from his top allies and aides.\"]","href_hash":"3663c1e059b811ec85d31be2e4c2c325"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3663c1e059b811ec85d31be2e4c2c325"}},
