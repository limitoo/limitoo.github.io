Of course there was going to be some adversity and I was happy to regroup in the third set.\", \"\\\"I don't think the score reflected the match really as I was really feeling it.\\\"\", \"When Raducanu belted away a forehand winner on the opening point of the match and pocketed the first set without breaking sweat it seemed she had just carried on from where she left off when beating Leylah Fernandez at Flushing Meadows.\", \"It had been a whirlwind existence since that momentous day for the youngster and the spotlight has been firmly on her as the Australian Open loomed.\", \"A 6-0 6-1 defeat by Elena Rybakina in Sydney, her only competitive match ahead of the Open, was a reality check and when her level dropped alarmingly in the second set, albeit with Stephens upping her own game, the alarm bells were ringing.\", \"With little experience of deciding sets in Grand Slams, the odds had switched towards Stephens whose world ranking of 67 does not do justice to her pedigree.\", \"But it was Raducanu who showed the better game-management, cutting out the errors to seize the initiative early before romping home to take her winning streak in Grand Slams, including the U.S. Open qualifying, to 11.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"45791f2e78a611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"45791f2e78a611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
