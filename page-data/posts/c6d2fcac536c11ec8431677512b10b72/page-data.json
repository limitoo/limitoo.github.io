Initially marketed as a convenience, the fees have proliferated over the past quarter-century and have become known as an aggressive way to siphon money from consumers.\", \"They\\u2019re a moneymaker: The banking industry collected $15.47 billion in overdraft fees in 2019, according to a report that the consumer bureau released on Wednesday.\", \"Though overdraft revenues dipped in 2020 when Americans received stimulus money, Rohit Chopra, the bureau\\u2019s director, said the fees had been steadily rising before the pandemic struck. They remain a major revenue source for many institutions, dwarfing other fees like those for account maintenance and A.T.M. use, he added.\", \"\\u201cLarge financial institutions are still hooked on exploitative junk fees that can quickly drain a family\\u2019s bank account,\\u201d Mr. Chopra said in a statement.\", \"The bureau did not identify any banks it may be targeting, but Mr. Chopra said it had asked its examiners to focus on banks that rely heavily on overdraft fees. Banks with \\u201ca higher share of frequent overdrafters or a higher average fee burden for overdrafting\\u201d should also expect close supervisory attention, he said.\", \"Mr. Chopra said the bureau would take action against banks that violated rules governing overdraft fees and would \\u201cseek to uncover the individuals who directed any illegal conduct.\\u201d\", \"Some banks have already begun making changes: Just before the bureau\\u2019s announcement, Capital One said it would stop charging retail customers overdraft fees early next year, making it the latest bank to either eliminate them or provide less punitive alternatives.\", \"In May, Ally Bank said it would eliminate its $25 overdraft fee, giving customers six days to get in the black again before it potentially limits how they use their accounts. A number of other banks, like Bank of America and PNC, are taking smaller but still notable steps that include grace periods and small short-term loans \\u2014 if users qualify.\", \"Customers who have already opted into Capital One\\u2019s overdraft program will be automatically moved to the no-fee version early next year, fully eradicating the $35 fees. The bank said eliminating them would cost it roughly $150 million in revenue annually.\", \"While Capital One is not among the country\\u2019s very biggest banks \\u2014 JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America generated 44 percent of the fees reported in 2019 by banks with assets above $1 billion, according to the consumer bureau \\u2014 it is large enough for its decision to have some significance, advocates said.\", \"\\u201cThis move by Capital One will have tremendous benefits for the most vulnerable consumers,\\u201d said Lauren Saunders, associate director at the National Consumer Law Center, an advocacy group. It also \\u201cputs pressure on the rest of the banking industry to eliminate these predatory fees, which are a back-end way of harming consumers.\\u201d\", \"Regulations introduced in 2010 helped curtail some of the worst abuses by requiring banks to receive consumers\\u2019 consent to opt into overdraft services on debit transactions and A.T.M. withdrawals, but the practice is still worth billions. From 2015 to 2019, overdraft and related revenue at banks with $1 billion or more in assets increased about 1.7 percent annually to $11.97 billion, according to the bureau\\u2019s latest report. But it fell more than a quarter in 2020 to $8.84 billion, a decline credited at least in part to government aid programs in response to the pandemic.\", \"The bureau has already taken action against some banks in recent years. In August, it ordered TD Bank to pay $122 million in penalties and customer restitution. In 2018, TCF National Bank \\u2014 whose former chief named his boat Overdraft \\u2014 reached a $30 million settlement.\", \"Capital One customers who do not already have overdraft protection will be able to enroll in the no-fee program, but habitual overdrafters may not qualify. In a memo to staff, Richard Fairbank, the bank\\u2019s chief executive officer, said customers would need to show a steady pattern of deposits to be granted overdraft protection \\u2014 and could not have a history of frequent overdrafts.\", \"If a participant\\u2019s overdraft balance is not repaid after 56 days, the bank will write it off \\u2014 the same procedure the bank follows now, according to a spokeswoman. The missed payment will not affect a consumer\\u2019s traditional credit score, but it will be reported to a specialty bureau, Early Warning Services, owned by seven of the largest banks.\", \"The bank will continue to allow customers to sign up for automatic no-fee transfers from their Capital One savings or money market accounts to pay for transactions their checking account cannot cover.\"]","href_hash":"c6d2fcac536c11ec8431677512b10b72"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c6d2fcac536c11ec8431677512b10b72"}},
