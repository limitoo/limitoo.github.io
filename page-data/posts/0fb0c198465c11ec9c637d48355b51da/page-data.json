Ji-Young, a Korean American 7-year-old who loves playing her electric guitar and skateboarding, will make her debut next week.\", \"Ji-Young won\\u2019t just be sharing her love for rock music and tteokbokki, or Korean rice cakes, on the show. She will also play a role in countering anti-Asian bias and harassment at a time of heightened awareness around the issue.\", \"Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit that produces \\u201cSesame Street,\\u201d said it created Ji-Young to support families of Asian and Pacific Islander heritage as part of its racial justice initiative, Coming Together. Sesame Workshop introduced the initiative in the summer of 2020, after the murder of George Floyd and as racism and violence targeting Asians and Asian Americans surged during the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cSesame Street\\u201d has been on air for more than 50 years, but Ji-Young is its first Asian American muppet.\", \"The show has had human characters and guests of Asian descent, including Alan Muraoka, who is Japanese American and owns the fictional Hooper\\u2019s Store. In June, \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d released a video called \\u201cProud of Your Eyes,\\u201d in which Mr. Muraoka helped Analyn, a Filipino American girl, after she was teased about the shape of her eyes. Muraoka and Wes, a muppet, told Analyn that her eyes were beautiful and part of what made her who she was.\", \"Nancy Wang Yuen, a sociology professor at Biola University in La Mirada, Calif., and an expert on race and racism in Hollywood, said that when she first immigrated to the United States from Taiwan at age 5, she learned more English from \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d than from the E.S.L. classes at her school.\", \"The show was more diverse than most children\\u2019s programming of the time, but Ms. Yuen said it was missing characters who looked like her when she was growing up in the 1980s and early 1990s.\", \"\\u201cI think having this muppet who is more culturally specific and is able to speak another language, especially in the current time of rising anti-Asian hate, is so essential to representation,\\u201d she said.\", \"Ji-Young made her television debut on the \\u201cToday\\u201d show on NBC on Monday. \\u201cYou know what\\u2019s really cool about \\u2018Sesame Street\\u2019 is that no matter what you look like, or how you play or where you come from, you belong, and that\\u2019s really cool,\\u201d Ji-Young said.\", \"She will be introduced on \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d during a special episode on Thanksgiving Day on HBO Max and on local PBS stations.
