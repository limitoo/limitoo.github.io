Parties, vacations, weddings. But more often, the real best days in hindsight weren\\u2019t the obvious ones. They were marked by the ordinary: a long conversation with a friend when I realized I wasn\\u2019t the only one who felt the way I did. That time we were going to miss the train so we sprinted to the point of near collapse \\u2014 and made it. Staggering home with a Christmas tree so big, it barely fit through the door.\", \"The planned punctuations to life \\u2014 holidays, job promotions, family milestones \\u2014 often disappoint. New Year\\u2019s Eve is useless; Thanksgiving ends up being memorable not for the meal but for the next-day deliberations over how many ways you can eat a leftover turkey. The polished moments that ended up on Instagram weren\\u2019t what I remembered at the end of the year, either. I rarely had any photos at all of the best days. I was too busy living them.\", \"The problem with these best days was they went by without me realizing how special they were. Unmarked by ceremony and undocumented for posterity, they streamed together in my mind as a blur.\", \"I wondered, could I find a way to know when the best days were coming and really feel them as they happened? So I tried declaring a best day in advance. Even if it felt ridiculous, this effort to make the ordinary feel extraordinary usually worked. Mundane experiences felt special when I marked them as such. Staying up talking in a living room until too late at night or going for a weekend run through a park in the sunshine felt as wonderful as I had hoped it would.\", \"Designating a regular night as a best night helped me claim that moment. I no longer had to battle my nostalgia for ownership of my experiences. Now that I was looking for them, I caught them before they became memories.\", \"Marking experiences this way is one key to happiness, said Dr. Robert Waldinger, a psychiatrist, Zen priest and the director of the Harvard Happiness Study.\", \"\\u201cOften we\\u2019ll remember the things that are more emotionally loaded as opposed to the neutral, the flat, the boring,\\u201d Dr. Waldinger told me. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why you probably can\\u2019t remember what you had for dinner last Monday night \\u2014 unless it was something special. That\\u2019s because our brains have to screen out a whole bunch of stuff. So when we look back, we tend to remember the things that were more emotional.\\u201d\", \"In other words, the framing I was giving my declared best days \\u2014 and the anticipation I was assigning them \\u2014 was tricking my brain into seeing them as something more special, more weighted with emotional significance, than it otherwise would. I was burning these ordinary but precious days into my mind.\", \"Looking back at 2021, I realized recently that I had stopped seeing the best days. I was too busy following the news and wishing my life would go back to normal. But this is normal now. Our lives are not on hold. This is it.\", \"It\\u2019s easy to stay caught in nostalgia\\u2019s thrall, to think back longingly to when things were better. That makes sense because nostalgia is an especially powerful psychological tool for enduring trauma. It helps you cope with stress, combat loneliness and find meaning in struggle. It is restorative. But for me, it has sometimes led to an unsettling feeling that my past was better than where I am now.\", \"When I think about it, it\\u2019s clear that there will be experiences from this pandemic that I will miss or feel nostalgic for as well: a blissfully vacant calendar; meandering walking catch-ups with friends; smiling at neighbors after months of waving from across the street. Not the tedium or the dread, of course, but the beauty we found in the quiet.\", \"And lately I\\u2019ve realized that a lot of what made me unhappy during the pandemic made me unhappy beforehand, too. The loneliness that I worried at times might become a permanent feature of adulthood, for example, or the way the days and years can stretch together. The excuses I made as I waited for something to change.\", \"We can\\u2019t wait anymore. The stress we feel now isn\\u2019t going to magically disappear, just as it never would have before the pandemic. The world has always been a shambles. There\\u2019s only one thing we can control: How are we going to live in it?\", \"Why not try to have a best day right now, maybe even tonight? It certainly beats waiting until the world is fixed. And a moment of happiness doesn\\u2019t stop us from pushing for the worst of the world to change. On the contrary, as Dr. Waldinger told me, savoring positive moments can serve as fuel to create more of them.\", \"So I\\u2019m going to go back to my practice of declaring a best day in advance. I\\u2019ll start by declaring today or tomorrow or next Monday one of the best days of 2021. Then I\\u2019ll tell someone its new designation, because a best day is often better with company. I\\u2019ll put down my phone. I\\u2019ll decide to do something I enjoy \\u2014 it could be as simple as having some friends over or going for a walk.\", \"Most important, I won\\u2019t wait. Today is as good a day as any to enjoy what life already offers.\"]","href_hash":"81b1818d506c11ecb4ff9f6aead3dfc7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"81b1818d506c11ecb4ff9f6aead3dfc7"}},
