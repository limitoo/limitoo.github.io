Most of the workers who tested positive are asymptomatic although in a few cases they have reported mild symptoms.\", \"After the hospital became aware of COVID-19 infections following the meal, management proceeded to test everyone involved. Those workers who tested positive had to isolate for ten days and must not return to their jobs at the ICU until they obtain a negative result on a PCR test.\", \"The oubtreak and the fact that Monday is a public holiday in Spain has reportedly forced the hospital to draft in emergency personnel to ensure adequate services in the ICU, a union delegate for the hospital from the Uni\\u00f3n General de Trabajadores (UGT,) Carlos Bueno, told local media outlet La Opini\\u00f3n de M\\u00e1laga.\", \"\\\"This is something common when unforeseen events like this happen and above in the middle of a [period] where a good part of the staff has gone on vacation.
