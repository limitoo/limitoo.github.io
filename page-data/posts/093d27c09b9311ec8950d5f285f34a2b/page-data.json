Bloomfield, fronting a briefing on his own, had to apologise for delays in testing thousands of PCR swabs.\", \"He said it was mainly because the ministry was \\\"a day or two late\\\" to recognise how quickly Omicron was spreading.\", \"Stuff reported him as saying that at its worst 50,000 swabs had been waiting more than five days to be processed and 9000 were sent to Queensland. He gave an assurance the backlog would be quickly cleared.\", \"National and ACT, having been unable to criticise the government for announcing an end to MIQ because they had been calling for it for months, went for Bloomfield.\", \"ACT leader David Seymour said he should resign. \\\"Based on the quality of the management of the pandemic, it is clear he needs to go,\\\" he said.\", \"National Party Covid-19 response spokesman Chris Bishop said Bloomfield had misled the public about the capacity of the testing system.\", \"\\\"Everyone has suspected this, you've had multiple experts from the laboratory and from the testing community on the record saying that the system could not cope with the numbers that the ministry said it could,\\\" he said.\", \"For months opposition parties have been criticising the government for the late securing of rapid antigen tests (RATs), and ministers must have been relieved this week when they started arriving in millions.\", \"The RATs were first distributed to testing centres and then retailers began receiving their own. People could walk into a shop this week and buy them, and they did.\", \"\\\"There are fears rapid antigen tests could become 'the new toilet paper' as rising Covid-19 infections spark massive demand for the at-home testing kits,\\\" the NZ Herald reported.\", \"It said one Auckland pharmacy sold almost 3000 in a day, there were queues and \\\"desperation\\\" among customers.\", \"Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said there was no need to stockpile, the tests had a use-by date and the older they were the less reliable they became.\", \"Prices varied widely.

He tweeted to say he was isolating at home after testing positive on Sunday. He hadn't been in the Beehive since the previous Monday so hadn't been with other MPs or staff while infectious.\", \"During the week National called for stronger measures against Russia for invading Ukraine. Luxon wanted the Russian ambassador expelled and New Zealand's representative withdrawn from Moscow, saying the time for diplomacy was \\\"well and truly over\\\".\", \"He had previously said the government should pass a law allowing New Zealand to impose autonomous sanctions against Russia and Ardern indicated legislation would soon be in Parliament.\", \"\\\"We are pursuing new measures to target Russian investment including measures to target financial institutions in New Zealand,\\\" she said.\", \"RNZ reported it understood the legislation would allow Russian individuals to be targeted and the bill could be passed next week, with National's support.\", \"The first item of business for Parliament this week was a motion put up by Ardern condemning Russia for the invasion.\", \"\\\"Slava Ukraini\\\" she said as she introduced it, which Stuff said translated as \\\"glory to Ukraine\\\".

The usually beautifully kept lawn had been destroyed and graffiti covered every piece of masonry the protesters could get to. The slide in the children's playground had been set on fire but was still standing.\", \"Parliament's only business on Thursday afternoon was the unanimous passing of a motion that pledged the grounds would be restored and thanking the police and emergency services for removing the protesters.\", \"Wellington City Council said it was on standby to carry out a \\\"deep clean\\\" of the grounds because some of the protesters had been infected.\", \"Police said it had been established as a crime scene to allow forensic investigators to identify those responsible for arson and other crimes, Stuff reported.\", \"Discussions about what happens next have started. On Thursday night Speaker Trevor Mallard said Parliament would have to have a wall and gates that could be closed, but he wanted to \\\"retain the openness and accessibility of our House and grounds\\\".\", \"Deputy Prime Minister Grant Robertson, the local MP, told Morning Report he had been confident throughout that buildings would not be breached but nevertheless, the protesters' actions had been disturbing.\", \"\\\"There will be a review of the overall security arrangements for Parliament.
