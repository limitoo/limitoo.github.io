I was young and woefully unprepared, so I put my inheritance on the back burner and lived my life as if I was financially \\u201cnormal.\\u201d However, since the pandemic, my portfolio has hit a new high. I am utterly distraught. I feel that I should have never gotten so wealthy when people are suffering so much.\", \"I\\u2019ve been seriously considering giving a large portion away, but the more I talk to people, the more I realize that to give away large sums of money responsibly and ethically turns my life into a job that I never wanted. I don\\u2019t want my father\\u2019s money to become my life, my career or the most significant thing about me, even though I know that I benefit from it. I have privileges with it, it gives me options and frankly I could not afford to live in a big city without it.\", \"My questions are these: How much money is it ethical to keep, and how much would it be ethical to give away? What is the best way to decide who should receive the money? And how much time and responsibility and rewriting of my life do I owe this gift that often feels like a burden? Name Withheld\", \"On the one hand, your father was entitled to leave these assets to you, and you were entitled to accept them. (Assuming, of course, that they weren\\u2019t acquired through criminal means.) Maybe the tax code should have taken more of it from you: Many people think there\\u2019s a moral case for steep taxes on intergenerational transfers of wealth, because it\\u2019s a source of unfair inequality. Maybe taxes on capital gains should be higher: Many people think such revenue should be treated as regular income. If you supported such reforms, you\\u2019d have reason to back candidates who favored them. This one bequest, though, will make a de minimis difference to inequality in the world.\", \"On the other hand, having this money puts you in a position to do good, and there\\u2019s something to the thought that luck of this kind (you didn\\u2019t earn any of this money) places you under an obligation to give back. I understand that you don\\u2019t want to devote your life to doing this. But giving money away just isn\\u2019t that hard. You\\u2019re not in some \\u201cBrewster\\u2019s Millions\\u201d pickle.\", \"There are many excellent philanthropic organizations in the world, with staffs and boards who focus on making positive change. I suppose you could also identify a foundation that has its own portfolio of philanthropic projects and see if you can add your gift to its endowment. That\\u2019s what Warren Buffett, with his rather sizable family business, did when he committed 30-odd billion dollars to the Gates Foundation. There are also groups \\u2014 e.g., BBB Wise Giving Alliance, Charity Navigator, Charity Watch \\u2014 that evaluate philanthropies, although smaller ones may not be on their radar. GiveWell, an organization associated with the effective-altruism movement, identifies charities it thinks could deliver \\u201cmaximum impact\\u201d per dollar. Insecticide-treated bed nets, which prevent malaria, score high in its system.\", \"Unless you\\u2019re committed to utilitarianism, \\u201cmaximum impact\\u201d \\u2014 in lives saved or suffering averted \\u2014 need not be your only guide. Ours is a richly variegated world, with many values and many things to value; it isn\\u2019t as if all charitable giving must go to malaria prevention. You\\u2019re not wasting your money if you want to donate to that performing arts center you love \\u2014 or maybe it\\u2019s a public radio station or a nonprofit legal-aid provider or a music program for children. You\\u2019ll have helped make the world, or at least your community, a better and perhaps a more vibrant place. You may take a special interest in certain causes, owing to your own experiences. Taking a couple of days to consider some options isn\\u2019t going to derail your life.\", \"Speaking of which: Giving back doesn\\u2019t require sacrificing your ability to keep living as you\\u2019d prefer in the place you prefer. (Remember, too, you can bequeath your estate \\u2014 including, say, that apartment you couldn\\u2019t otherwise afford \\u2014 to worthwhile beneficiaries.) You say you feel distraught; let me urge another sentiment. \\u201cThe reaction of my family and me to our extraordinary good fortune is not guilt,\\u201d Buffett has said, \\u201cbut rather gratitude.\\u201d You can free yourself from whatever part of your father\\u2019s legacy you find burdensome. But the time and thought it takes to make the necessary decisions should indeed be an expression not of guilt but of gratitude.\", \"In an effort to provide for the long-term financial stability of her children, my grandmother bought a large amount of stock in a fossil-fuel company, which she left to my father. I find it heartbreaking that the investment she made and that my father has maintained to provide safety and security is one of the things that is actively moving the planet toward terrible destruction. My father is elderly and would not consider divesting from this company. This stock will be a majority of his bequest to my siblings and me. I hope my father will live for many more years, but when that stock \\u2014 and the associated wealth \\u2014 come to me, what is the ethical thing for me to do with the money? I feel guilt and disgust at the prospect of profiting off the suffering of so many. Name Withheld\", \"The case for divesting from fossil-fuel companies is that such divestment, on a large scale, would stigmatize their activities, exert a downward pressure on their share prices and (through an indirect mechanism of action) reduce the amount of capital available to them. We want to restrain investment in the exploitation of fossil fuels; we want to encourage investment in alternatives. But some people are motivated less by considerations of capital flows and more by a desire to have clean hands \\u2014 to feel unsullied by the fossil-fuel industry and its grievous legacy.\", \"There are a few complications here. One is that most oil reserves are state-owned and aren\\u2019t directly affected by divestment campaigns, so the strategy is quite limited in its effects. Another is that the world currently relies on fossil fuels for most of its energy needs, including most of its electricity, and though we should decarbonize as fast as we can (which is much faster than oil-and-gas companies would like), there\\u2019s no switch we can throw that would obviate a period of transition: Oil companies can\\u2019t yet be wished out of existence.\", \"Then there\\u2019s the question of how to think about socially responsible shareholder activists. The hedge fund Engine No. 1, by becoming an Exxon Mobil shareholder and corralling the support of much larger investors, succeeded in installing three directors committed to getting the company to spend more on carbon reduction. Can investors who are devoted to E.S.G. (environment, social and governance) issues play a positive role in reforming the energy sector?\", \"If you\\u2019re simply concerned with keeping your hands clean, you won\\u2019t be able to explore these matters. The great economic and political theorist Albert O. Hirschman explored \\u201cexit\\u201d and \\u201cvoice\\u201d as among the ways we can respond to dysfunctional organizations. Exit, in this case, means withdrawing from these entities; voice means speaking up and trying to redirect them. Some combination of exit and voice might be optimal here.\", \"And when the stock passes into your possession? I would recommend a forward-looking approach: The question is what you can do that would contribute to solving one of the great problems facing humanity. That might mean liquidating your holdings and adding to the social pressure on the company. It might also mean donating some of the money to a nonprofit group that works for a greener world; it might mean putting resources into the alternative-energy sector.\", \"Your father, out of sentimentality, won\\u2019t consider divesting from this company. He\\u2019s caught up, it seems, in the fact that his mother made the investment \\u2014 a backward-looking consideration. Don\\u2019t get caught up in backward-looking considerations, too. To dwell on the fact that this wealth came from an investment made by someone else a few generations ago is another form of sentimentality. Almost any inheritance entails profiting from the sins of the past. An awareness of historical mistakes is salutary, but the task is to help put things right in the future.\"]","href_hash":"f6e08e4b4c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f6e08e4b4c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}},
