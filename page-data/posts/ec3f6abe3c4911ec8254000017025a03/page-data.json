But the amendment\\u2019s failure showed that even in a liberal city where skepticism in the police runs deep, many Americans are not prepared to get rid of the police.\", \"Minneapolis leaders now face the challenge of filling staffing shortages in a Police Department that is about a third smaller than it was before Mr. Floyd\\u2019s killing, and at a time when the city is facing the most homicides since the mid-1990s. Even though voters were bitterly divided over the charter amendment, the city has been largely united in a view that meaningful reforms to policing are needed.\", \"\\u201cWe all agree that we can\\u2019t sustain as we are now with the way policing has been,\\u201d said Brian Herron, the pastor of a church on the city\\u2019s North Side and an opponent of the amendment. But he added: \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have time to reimagine. We got bodies dropping in the streets. We got innocent folk being killed.\\u201d\", \"Supporters of the measure had framed it as an opportunity to rethink law enforcement and perhaps become a national model for a different approach.\", \"\\u201cFor every new change, someone had to be the first,\\u201d said Sheila Nezhad, who supported the amendment, and who decided to run for mayor after working as a street medic following Mr. Floyd\\u2019s death. \\u201cThis is our opportunity to lead.\\u201d\", \"In the days after Mr. Floyd\\u2019s murder, Minneapolis became the center of a push to defund or abolish the police, and the amendment on Tuesday\\u2019s ballot grew out of that. But while many in Minneapolis have deep concerns about the current policing system, the city was deeply divided on whether the ballot language went too far.\", \"Moderate Democrats, including Mayor Jacob Frey, called for improving the current department. An uptick in homicides led some residents to question the wisdom of shedding the Police Department for a new public safety agency. And a lack of clarity on what the amendment would actually do scared off some voters.\", \"\\u201cPolicing is the No. 1 issue, but I don\\u2019t see my opinion reflected,\\u201d said Leanne Fanner, 54, who works in insurance and said before Election Day that she intended to vote against the measure. \\u201cI do think we need systemic reform of the Police Department \\u2014 systemic and accountable reform.\\u201d\", \"The amendment called for discarding minimum police staffing levels for the city, and getting rid of the Minneapolis Police Department altogether. Under the amendment, the City Council would have more oversight over the agency that replaced the Police Department, which would be focused on public health and, according to the ballot language, \\u201ccould include licensed peace officers (police officers), if necessary.\\u201d\", \"Supporters of the measure, who largely steered away from describing the plan as one to \\u201cdefund the police,\\u201d framed it as a way to help their city move past the pain of the past 18 months and create a new, more equitable system. And they have disagreed with some opponents who say this is not a wise moment to replace the Police Department, given rising gun violence in the streets.\", \"\\u201cI find it fascinating that folks are saying, \\u2018No, this is the wrong time to do things that directly address the things that are bad right now,\\u2019\\u201d said JaNa\\u00e9 Bates, a minister who helped lead a campaign supporting the amendment and believes that having more social workers and community violence workers would do a better job reducing gun violence than would traditional policing.\", \"Many Minneapolis residents say they remain shaken by the events that unfolded in the city, from the video of an officer kneeling on Mr. Floyd\\u2019s neck, to the protests and arson and looting that followed.\", \"\\u201cWe are going through some of the hardest and most difficult circumstances our city has ever faced,\\u201d Mr. Frey told high school students during a debate this fall.\", \"The question of how to respond has divided Minnesota\\u2019s top Democrats. Representative Ilhan Omar, whose congressional district includes Minneapolis, and Keith Ellison, the state attorney general, supported replacing the Police Department. Their fellow Democrats in the Senate, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, opposed it.\", \"Since Mr. Floyd\\u2019s murder, many large cities, Minneapolis included, have invested more money in mental health services and experimented with dispatching social workers instead of armed officers to some emergency calls. Some departments scaled back minor traffic stops and arrests. And several cities cut police budgets amid the national call to defund, though some have since restored funding in response to rising gun violence and shifting politics.\", \"But no large city went as far as getting rid of its police force and replacing it with something new.\"]","href_hash":"ec3f6abe3c4911ec8254000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ec3f6abe3c4911ec8254000017025a03"}},
