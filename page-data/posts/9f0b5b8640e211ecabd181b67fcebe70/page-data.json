She suffered minor physical injuries but says still suffers from emotional scars.\", \"Blair said she has flashbacks, panic attacks and depression from witnessing the attack and the grief over the death of her friend, 32-year-old Heather Heyer.\", \"\\\"My emotional scars were way worse than my physical ones,\\\" Blair said to the court.\", \"Hundreds of white nationalists attended the rally in Charlottesville on Aug. 11 and Aug.12, 2017, to protest city plans to remove a statue of Confederate Gen.
