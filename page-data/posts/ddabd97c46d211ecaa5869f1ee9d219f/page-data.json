Kevin Stitt is still considering whether or not he will accept the state Pardon and Parole Board's recommendation to commute Jones' sentence to life in prison with the possibility of parole.\", \"Stitt has not commented on whether he will grant clemency to Jones, but a growing chorus that includes celebrities, state Republican lawmakers and faith leaders have urged him to accept the parole board's recommendation.\", \"On Monday, supporters including Jones' mother, Madeline Davis-Jones, visited the state Capitol with the hope of meeting with the Republican governor. An official with the governor's office told her he wasn't available.\", \"In a lengthy Twitter thread later on Monday, Kardashian West said she, Jones's family, and supporters are all \\\"anxiously awaiting\\\" a decision from Stitt.\", \"\\\"Julius, his family and everyone on his team are still hopeful Stitt will do the right thing. Today Julius' family and close friends received invites to his execution,\\\" she wrote. \\\"I can't even imagine how they all must be feeling right now.\\\"\", \"The reality television star turned criminal justice reform campaigner has advocated for Jones since his case attracted national attention after it was profiled in The Last Defense, a documentary series produced by Viola Davis that aired on ABC in 2018.\", \"She visited him on death row in November last year.\", \"In her Twitter thread, Kardashian West went on to describe in detail what the process of an execution is like in Oklahoma.\", \"Last month, the state resumed executions after a six-year pause prompted by a series of flawed lethal injections by putting to death John Marion Grant, who witnesses said repeatedly convulsed and vomited after the sedative midazolam was administered.\", \"Jones \\\"has been on death watch for more than 2 weeks,\\\" Kardashian West wrote. \\\"In preparation for his execution on Nov. 18, he is alone in his prison cell just feet away from the executioner's chamber. He has been strip searched, x-rayed, and issued a new set of clothes, shoes, mattress & bedding.\\\"\", \"He is being \\\"closely monitored\\\" by staff, she noted, which includes everything he consumes being logged. \\\"His personal property has been catalogued and he has designated who is to receive it after he is put to death. He has also designated who will receive his remains,\\\" she added.\", \"Oklahoma \\\"is so bent on vengeance that they will make every effort to ensure they get to kill Julius - including reviving him if he happens to go into cardiac arrest prior to the execution,\\\" she wrote in another tweet, along with a screenshot of the relevant section of the state's execution policy.\", \"\\\"Like all incarcerated people put to death by the Oklahoma Dept of Corrections, #JuliusJones organs are not eligible for donation. The staff who will administer his execution are being selected and trained to put him to his death,\\\" she continued.\", \"\\\"On Thursday, the Inspector General will obtain the body bag and tag from the medical examiner's office and all witnesses for the execution will be selected. Next week, they will restrict access to the unit where Julius is housed and they will perform equipment checks.\\\"\", \"Jones will lose his phone privileges at 9 p.m. on Wednesday, Kardashian West adds, and receive his last meal.\", \"\\\"He will be checked on every 15 minutes for the last four hours of his life. Then, he will be put to death,\\\" she wrote.\", \"\\\"This is the cold machinery of the Death Penalty in America. In just over two [days], an innocent man could be put to death. My heart breaks for Julius and so many others who have suffered from such tragic miscarriage of justice.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1933042/kim-kardashian-west-speaks-onstage.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Kim Kardashian West of 'The Justice Project' speaks onstage during the 2020 Winter TCA Tour Day 12 at The Langham Huntington, Pasadena on January 18, 2020 in Pasadena, California.</div>\"]","href_hash":"ddabd97c46d211ecaa5869f1ee9d219f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ddabd97c46d211ecaa5869f1ee9d219f"}},
