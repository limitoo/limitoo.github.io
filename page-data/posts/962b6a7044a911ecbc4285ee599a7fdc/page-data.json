The document urged countries to accelerate a coal phaseout and eliminate subsidies for fossil fuels.\", \"Negotiators from about 200 countries worked into Saturday morning, arguing over several aspects of the document, including whether countries should be asked to return next year with stronger emissions plans, if wealthy countries should give financial help to developing countries suffering the worst impacts, and how to structure a global market for carbon.\", \"They even disputed whether the final agreement should mention the words \\u201cfossil fuels,\\u201d which have never before appeared in a global climate agreement even though their combustion is the principal cause of climate change.\", \"One of the most divisive questions involves whether industrialized countries that have prospered by burning coal, oil and gas should pay developing countries for the irreparable harms they have caused.\", \"The state of the negotiations reflected the intensifying pressure on polluter countries to not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions far more quickly than they have been willing, but also to address the damage that those emissions have exacted on countries least responsible for the problem.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s a huge disconnect between where we are, where we will be based on current projections and where we need to be in terms of what science is telling us,\\u201d said Saber Hossain Chowdhury, a negotiator from Bangladesh.\", \"A new draft text was expected Saturday morning, according to summit organizers. To reach a final agreement, all parties must approve. By tradition, if one country objects to language in the agreement, the talks can deadlock.\", \"The summit host, Britain, had said its goal was to ensure that the planet would not heat more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) by 2100, compared with preindustrial times. That is the threshold beyond which scientists say devastating heat waves, fires and floods become significantly more likely.\", \"That goal is nowhere within reach.\", \"The world has already warmed an average of 1.1 degrees Celsius since the Industrial Revolution, although some places have already heated more than that. One analysis found that even if all the pledges made in Glasgow are kept, temperatures will still skyrocket by 2.4 degrees Celsius by 2100.\", \"The Kenyan environment minister, Keriako Tobiko, noted that an average global temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius would translate into 3 degrees in Africa, intensifying erratic patterns of rainfall and drought that are already punishing farmers.\", \"\\u201cIn Kenya and Africa, we cry, we bleed. We bleed when it rains, we cry when it doesn\\u2019t rain,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo for us, ambition, 1.5 is not a statistic. It is a matter of life and death.\\u201d\", \"Pressure mounted throughout the day to deliver a strong final document. At noon, more than 700 climate activists marched through the convention center where the summit is being held, chanting \\u201cclimate justice\\u201d and calling for more ambitious targets. They spilled out into the streets to join noisy throngs of more protesters.\", \"The demonstrations enlivened the two-week-long proceedings, which have been dominated by well-crafted speeches onstage and arguments over verbs in small meeting rooms. But they also served as a reminder to politicians and diplomats of the demands of ordinary citizens. Midway through the summit, more than 100,000 protesters filled the streets of Glasgow, many of them young people, angrily demanding that world leaders take aggressive action to deal with the climate crisis.\", \"A British diplomat closely following the negotiations said talks would go down to the wire.\", \"\\u201cThere are a number of key issues still in play here, and we\\u2019re still some distance from reaching an outcome,\\u201d said David Waskow, international climate director at the World Resources Institute, a Washington-based environmental think tank.\", \"The latest draft also \\u201crequests\\u201d nations to return every year to strengthen their emissions-cutting targets until the 1.5 degree Celsius goal is within reach. In diplomatic terms, that is tamer than \\u201curges,\\u201d which was used in the previous draft.\", \"Even at current temperatures, Mr. Chowdhury said, \\u201cwe see the destruction, the devastation, the pain, the suffering that all countries of the world are facing.\\u201d Mr. Chowdhury is from Bangladesh, one of the nations that have suffered most from climate change. He received sustained applause from delegates in the plenary hall.\", \"The latest draft calls on countries to accelerate \\u201cthe phaseout of unabated coal power and of inefficient subsidies for fossil fuels.\\u201d Unabated coal refers to power plants that do not capture their carbon dioxide emissions using a nascent technology not currently available on a commercial scale. The language would allow power plants with the technology to continue burning coal, and is a change from previous language asking nations to \\u201caccelerate the phasing out of coal and subsidies for fossil fuels.\\u201d\", \"John Kerry, the United States special envoy for climate change, on Friday described fossil fuel subsidies as the \\u201cdefinition of insanity,\\u201d denouncing measures taken by governments that artificially lower the price of coal, oil or gas.\", \"The world spends about $423 billion each year to subsidize oil, gas and coal, about four times the amount needed to help poor countries address climate change, according to the U.N. Development Program.\", \"Officials from other countries argued that the words \\u201cunabated\\u201d and \\u201cinefficient\\u201d should be removed from the agreement.\", \"\\u201cWe need clear language on the need to eliminate all fossil fuel subsidies, not only the inefficient ones, and to accelerate the phaseout of coal power,\\u201d said Andrea Meza, Costa Rica\\u2019s environment minister.\", \"\\u201cWeasel words,\\u201d Catherine Abreu, executive director of Destination Zero, an environmental group, called them.\", \"Mr. Kerry defended the language about unabated coal, saying commercial carbon capture technology could be available in the future.\", \"It\\u2019s unclear whether the coal language will stay in the final version, considering that countries like China, India, Poland and the United States still rely heavily on coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel.\", \"In the negotiations Friday night, diplomats were wrestling over how to write regulations to govern the fast-growing global market in carbon offsets, in which one company or country compensates for its own emissions by paying someone else to reduce theirs. One of the thorniest technical issues is how to properly account for these global trades so that any reductions in emissions aren\\u2019t overestimated or double-counted, and negotiators still haven\\u2019t resolved debates over how best to do so.\", \"It is common for United Nations climate conferences, which are supposed to run for two weeks, to go into overtime. Diplomats often don\\u2019t get down to the nitty-gritty details until the final night.\", \"Lia Nicholson, who represents small island nations in the negotiations, said the group \\u201cfinds ourselves at the final hours of this conference overwhelmed at the work still ahead of us.\\u201d\", \"\"]","href_hash":"962b6a7044a911ecbc4285ee599a7fdc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"962b6a7044a911ecbc4285ee599a7fdc"}},
