He wept in court as he begged the victims' families for forgiveness and asked the judge for leniency.\", \"But the Colorado judge last week reluctantly sentenced him to 110 years in prison, saying Colorado law required he impose the mandatory minimum sentences to all the counts Aguilera-Mederos was convicted of.\", \"Now an online petition calling for Colorado Governor Jared Polis to grant a clemency commutation, which lessens the severity of the sentence, has gained over 4.5 million signatures.\", \"\\\"This accident was not intentional, nor was it a criminal act on the drivers part. No one but the trucking company he is/was employed by should be held accountable for this accident,\\\" the petition states.\", \"\\\"Rogel has said several times that he wishes he had the courage to crash and take his own life that day, this tragic accident wasn't done with Intent, it wasn't a criminal act, it was an accident.\\\"\", \"Aguilera-Mederos' lawyer James Colgan told KDVR that an application for commutation is \\\"in the works\\\".\", \"\\\"Part of the application process requires the findings and evaluations by the Department of Corrections be sent to the governor. That isn't the case with Mr Mederos. He hasn't been in the system very long,\\\" Colgan said.\", \"In a statement to the NY Times, he added he thought the chances \\\"pretty good\\\" that Governor Polis would look at the application favourably.\", \"\\\"I have been in this system for 32 years and I have never seen anything like this,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"This is truly, truly, truly something that is out of the ordinary.\\\"\", \"Reuters / Newshub\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"3986a96062d111ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3986a96062d111ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
