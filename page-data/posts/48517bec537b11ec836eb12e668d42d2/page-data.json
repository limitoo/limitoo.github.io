The man, whose name was not released, drove to a hospital for treatment.\", \"Alexander leaves behind a 1-year-old daughter, CBS affiliate WWLTV reports.\", \"At age 12, Alexander played the character Joy Strong in \\\"Beasts of the Southern Wild,\\\" a drama filmed near Houma recounting the story of a poor Louisiana bayou community struggling for survival. The film won the Grand Jury Prize at the Sundance Film Festival and was nominated for four Academy Awards, including best picture.\", \"Director Benh Zeitlin cast Louisiana natives for the lead roles, auditioning more than 4,000 actors before completing the cast.
