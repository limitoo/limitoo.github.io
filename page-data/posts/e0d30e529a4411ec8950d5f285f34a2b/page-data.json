Please bear with us.\", \"\\\"As has been the case with supply chains around the world dealing with Omicron, this kind of disruption to the workforce is hard to manage, but we're doing our best and bringing on temporary team members where we can, keeping up our recruitment and we've also seconded team from our support offices too.\", \"\\\"With fewer team members available to work across the network, we're prioritising getting key lines and essentials into our stores, so customers may not always see their favourite brands or products. We're also changing how we operate in some stores and distribution centres, by doing things like temporarily shifting team around to support critical areas and reducing hours if we need to.\\\"\", \"In addition, fewer delivery slots were available for online orders and supply chain issues would mean more substitutions in orders, too.\", \"\\\"Our team is doing their best to ensure our customers, particularly those who are staying at home and isolating, get what they need, but it is challenging at the moment,\\\" Hannifin said.\", \"Rapid antigen tests will also be available at Countdown pharmacies this week.\", \"\\\"These will retail at $32.99 for a five-pack. We have a limited supply of RATs for sale at the moment as we have focused on having tests available in critical parts of our supply chain first, but we'll be selling RATs in more stores as they come through from our suppliers.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"e0d30e529a4411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e0d30e529a4411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
