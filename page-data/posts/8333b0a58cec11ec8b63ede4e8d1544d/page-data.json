Through Saturday, their record was perfect: six events, six golds.\", \"With devoted resources and four domestic tracks, Germany has long been a powerhouse in sliding sports. But it is extending its dominance another level at the Beijing Games.\", \"Germans first swept the golds in the four luge disciplines, winning the men\\u2019s and women\\u2019s singles and the men\\u2019s doubles, and then putting those champions together for the team event. Few were surprised when that squad, too, collected a gold.\", \"Next came skeleton, the event where athletes hurl themselves headfirst down the track. Christopher Grotheer won gold in the men\\u2019s event before Hannah Neise\\u2019s surprising first in the women\\u2019s competition interrupted a procession of three straight British champions in the event. Until this year, skeleton had been the only sliding sport in which Germany had never won the gold. Now, it has two in a weekend.\", \"\\u201cIt means a lot, especially for skeleton sliders,\\u201d Neise said of her victory. \\u201cWe haven\\u2019t had so many medals the past years, and we are very proud to represent our country and our federation.
