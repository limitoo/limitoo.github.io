While the pandemic forced the cancellation of many longtime races, the sport scrambled to add new ones. When the checkered flag goes down on Sunday, this will have ended up being Formula 1\\u2019s longest season.\", \"Events planned in China, Canada, Singapore, Japan and Australia were canceled, but races were added in Portugal, Turkey and Qatar, which hosted its first Grand Prix in November.\", \"\\u201cWe were able to bring home a calendar that will take us to 22 races this year, showing how strong the system is and how good the relationships are that we have around the world,\\u201d said Stefano Domenicali, the chief executive of Formula 1.\", \"The record calendar, up from 21 races in 2019, was positive news for Formula 1 as it tried to recover from the impact of Covid-19. Revenue jumped, rising 12 percent in the third quarter, compared with the same period last year, but the longer season has also taken a toll on teams. The Haas team said workers had quit because of the added workload and constant travel.\", \"G\\u00fcnther Steiner, team principal of Haas, said a handful of his staff members were leaving to find jobs outside Formula 1, partly because of the growing calendar.\", \"\\u201cA few people just don\\u2019t want to do the 23-race schedule next year,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cOne [engineer] just started a family, and he\\u2019s leaving. In general, I would say we have got a little bit more turnover than the years before, but not a lot.\\u201d\", \"It is not about to get easier. The calendar will grow again in 2022 because of the addition of the Miami Grand Prix. Twenty-three races are scheduled from March 20 to Nov. 20. About a month has been cut from the season to avoid a clash with the FIFA World Cup. To accommodate that compressed schedule, races will be held on back-to back Sundays 11 times, up from eight this season, giving teams less time to rest. Twice there will be events on three straight weekends.\", \"Andreas Seidl, team principal of McLaren, said holding more races in a shorter season would \\u201cmake it even more intense between the first and the last race.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBut it is positive seeing how big the interest is in the different countries,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe as a team are highly interested in the commercial growth of Formula 1.\\u201d\", \"Still, senior officials are conscious of the schedule\\u2019s cost to team personnel, including the drivers.\", \"Lando Norris of McLaren said it was becoming \\u201charder\\u201d to find time to rest and recover between races as more Grands Prix are added. He called the amount of travel \\u201cone of the toughest things.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt does take a toll on you,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re directly at work less than the mechanics and the engineers. But our side of the job is a lot more physical, and it\\u2019s still mentally draining, how much you\\u2019ve got to focus, how much time and effort you put into thinking about all these things and trying to improve and so on.\\u201d\", \"Sebastian Vettel of Aston Martin warned that Formula 1 \\u201cmustn\\u2019t neglect that we are a group of people and human beings traveling around the world.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIf we have 52 weekends in a year, we do 23 of those as races and [there are] a couple of months in a year that we can\\u2019t hold races in most places around the world [because of the weather], it obviously gives you a very intense season,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cThe objective should be [that] we have a sustainable way to run our season, not only for our environment, but also looking at the human resource.\\u201d\", \"Teams are taking steps to ease the burden. Many allow people to miss some races to stay fresher over the season. Some teams offer financial incentives for working more races and book more comfortable hotels at the end of a long trip.\", \"The expansion may also not stop at 23 races. Qatar and China have contracts to each host a race starting in 2023, which would create a 25-race schedule, the limit under Formula 1\\u2019s regulations.\", \"Franz Tost, the team principal of AlphaTauri, feared that the saturation of races could also be too much for fans.\", \"\\u201cI think Formula 1 will lose a little bit [of] the premium market, because if every weekend there is a race, people will lose interest,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cThis is what worries me more: not because of the workload, it\\u2019s because people get overloaded with races.\\u201d\", \"Fr\\u00e9d\\u00e9ric Vasseur, the team principal of Alfa Romeo, said a potential 25-race calendar should be considered \\u201ca positive first, because it means that Formula 1 is doing well and perception of F1 is improving.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe have to take care that the fans won\\u2019t lose the motivation,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat is important. But for the team, I don\\u2019t think it will be a mega issue.\\u201d\", \"Kimi Raikkonen of Alfa Romeo will retire from Formula 1 this weekend, ending a 20-year career. When he made his debut in 2001, the calendar had only 17 races, the majority of which were in Europe.\", \"Raikkonen, 42, said the growing calendar was not a factor in his decision to retire. But he did urge caution over the impact it would have on those working in Formula 1.\", \"\\u201cThey are doing long days, especially if there are issues with the cars,\\u201d he said. At the race in Mexico, he said, \\u201cthey worked overnight. It\\u2019s hard for them.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe problem will burn out a lot of people,\\u201d Raikkonen said, \\u201cand it\\u2019s not going to be good for anybody.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c3e3bce358d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c3e3bce358d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}},
