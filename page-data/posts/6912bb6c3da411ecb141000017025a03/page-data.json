Maybe a little.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-04T19:22:08.000Z","content":"[\"I told people on Monday that I thought Jack Ciattarelli would do better in the race for governor of New Jersey than the polls were indicating. My unscientific rationale was that Mr. Ciattarelli, the Republican challenger, had many more lawn signs than Gov. Phil Murphy where I live, northeastern Bergen County. I would estimate that Mr. Ciattarelli had at least 10 times as many signs.\", \"Mr. Ciattarelli did lose, but by only about 1 percentage point, defying a Rutgers-Eagleton poll showing him 8 percentage points down in late October. That didn\\u2019t make my lawn sign theory correct, of course. But the result was surprising. So I decided to look into the matter more closely.\", \"One theory might be that lawn signs influence election outcomes by increasing candidates\\u2019 name recognition. There might have been some of that going on. A 2016 study in the journal Electoral Studies by Donald Green, a political scientist at Columbia University, pooled the results of four experiments that involved placing lawn signs in randomly selected voting precincts and found that the signs had a small but not negligible effect \\u2014 \\u201cprobably greater than zero,\\u201d as he put it, \\u201cbut unlikely to be large enough to alter the outcome of a contest that would otherwise be decided by more than a few percentage points.\\u201d\", \"Another theory might be that lawn signs are a sensitive indicator of voters\\u2019 preferences: If you care enough to have a sign in your yard, you probably care enough to vote for the candidate and maybe get others to do so. (Handmade signs presumably convey even more conviction.) In the 2016 presidential race, Michael Koenig of ABC News saw signs that Donald Trump would win \\u2014 literally, about 20 lawn signs for every Hillary Clinton sign he encountered while bicycling through the countryside of swing states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania.\", \"Professor Green told me by email that there is \\u201ca long history of trying to use the preponderance of lawn signs as a quasi poll to predict outcomes.\\u201d One study he sent me, from a 1979 issue of the journal Political Methodology, analyzed seven political races in a small, unnamed California city in 1978. It found that \\u201ccandidates with the greatest number of signs received the greatest number of votes in six of the seven races.\\u201d\", \"In the U.S. presidential election of 2012, another study, by an undergraduate researcher at the University of Wisconsin, Eau Claire, found a high correlation in Eau Claire between the numbers of lawn signs for Barack Obama and Mitt Romney and the candidates\\u2019 vote totals by ward.\", \"I\\u2019d call that research inconclusive. What\\u2019s conclusive is the sea change in the vote in northeastern Bergen County between the presidential election of 2020 and this year\\u2019s election for state and local offices. Using data from the Bergen County Board of Elections, I totaled up the votes from seven of the county\\u2019s 56 boroughs: Alpine, Closter, Cresskill, Demarest, Northvale, Norwood and Tenafly. These boroughs range from prosperous to outright rich. (The median listing price of houses for sale in Alpine is $5.7 million, according to Realtor.com.)\", \"In 2020, Joe Biden walloped Donald Trump in these boroughs, capturing 61.9 percent of the vote to Mr. Trump\\u2019s 36.6 percent. This year, according to early results that don\\u2019t include write-ins and provisional ballots, Mr. Murphy got 49.6 percent of the vote to Mr. Ciattarelli\\u2019s 50.3 percent.\", \"To me that says two things: Mr. Trump is highly disliked in the area, and Mr. Ciattarelli didn\\u2019t suffer by association with him. Mr. Ciattarelli\\u2019s signature issue was cutting taxes and reallocating state school aid, which now largely goes to troubled urban schools, to what he described as \\u201cstruggling suburban, shore area and rural schools.\\u201d\", \"I\\u2019d like to say that my lawn sign detector was picking up on that big swing in voter preference. On Wednesday, though, I came upon another possible explanation for the profusion of Ciattarelli signs. I spoke with Richard Kurtz, a wealthy real estate investor who owns property in Alpine. He\\u2019s the chief executive of the Kamson Corporation of Englewood Cliffs, N.J., which owns and operates apartment complexes in Connecticut, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. He told me that he bought more than 100,000 Ciattarelli signs and had them put up all over the state, including on his own apartment properties.\", \"\\u201cI met Jack four or five months ago and I said, \\u2018This is a solid citizen,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Kurtz told me. \\u201cHis keen interest in the state. Everything he wants to do is positive, most of all lower taxes and do the right thing.\\u201d\", \"As for the signs, he added: \\u201cFor some reason I always remember in my experience of voting, lawn signs are so special. If I had more time and energy, I would have liked to do even more.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Kurtz said that a man who works for him part-time put up dozens of signs on a heavily traveled stretch of Closter Dock Road in Alpine where Mr. Kurtz owns a sprawling property once owned by descendants of the industrialist Henry Clay Frick. It was that stretch of signage that first caught my attention. \\u201cThey probably overdid it here in Alpine,\\u201d Mr. Kurtz said with a laugh.\", \"When I told Professor Green about the Kurtz blitz, he thought of comparing vote totals in precincts where Mr. Kurtz put up signs on his properties with precincts where he didn\\u2019t to see if the signs made a difference. \\u201cThat would be a lot of fun,\\u201d he said, imagining getting a nice research paper out of it. But since Mr. Kurtz spread the signs all over the state, that experiment won\\u2019t be possible.\", \"What originally looked to me like an indication of a groundswell of support for Mr. Ciattarelli doesn\\u2019t look so grass-roots anymore. On the other hand, Mr. Kurtz wasn\\u2019t responsible for all of those Ciattarelli signs I spotted. I\\u2019d say my lawn sign theory may still have something to recommend it.\"]","href_hash":"6912bb6c3da411ecb141000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6912bb6c3da411ecb141000017025a03"}},
