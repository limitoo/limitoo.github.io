Across the country, there are at least 40 legal challenges to vaccine and testing mandates issued by cities, hospitals, universities and other employers that have yet to move forward, while others have been knocked back.\", \"The leaders of most major religious organizations have recommended that their members get the vaccine. Officials say that no one is actively discouraging people in the military from seeking a religious exemption. But anyone seeking one from the Pentagon or Department of Veterans Affairs would be required to have an established history of adherence to a religion that prohibits vaccines, among other things.\", \"Vaccine reluctance in the military and the Department of Veterans Affairs mirrors that of civilian society, where vaccine rates are largely lower without such mandates.\", \"Over the summer, as the Delta variant surged, military officials became alarmed at the growing number of deaths; over the fall, more active duty members died from the virus than in all of 2020, none of them vaccinated.\"]","href_hash":"00da7c043cde11ec83ce000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"00da7c043cde11ec83ce000017025a03"}},
