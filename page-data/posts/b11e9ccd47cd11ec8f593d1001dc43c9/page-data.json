Neither have school staffing problems. And parent protests against pandemic restrictions have only grown stronger.\", \"School nurses, already overworked, increasingly find themselves under fire from parents for enforcing public health rules that they did not make and cannot change.\", \"\\u201cThey just basically hate you,\\u201d said Anne Lebouef, a school nurse in Louisiana, who said that she cries several times a week. \\u201cThey\\u2019re yelling at you. They\\u2019re accusing you of fear mongering.\\u201d\", \"Before the pandemic, the majority of U.S. school nurses were already responsible for covering more than one school, according to a 2018 study. And one-quarter of schools have no paid nursing staff at all.\", \"Through the pandemic, nurses still tried to keep students safe. They have acted as contact tracers and quarantine enforcers, while still handling the scrapes, allergic reactions and broken bones of a normal semester.\", \"This year, nurses told my colleague Emily Anthes, is even worse. Fighting burnout, they say they are juggling more Covid cases, quarantines and furious parents.\", \"For the first time, some hate their jobs. Others are quitting, exacerbating a school nursing shortage that predates the pandemic.\", \"Sherry McIntyre, a nurse in western Oregon, faced stiff criticism from parents last month after she quarantined two dozen football players.\", \"\\u201cThey call us and tell us we\\u2019re ruining their children\\u2019s athletic career,\\u201d she told Emily. \\u201cThey see us as the enemy.\\u201d\", \"Pediatric vaccination could alleviate the strain on some school nurses, especially if it reduces the number of kids they must send home. (The C.D.C. says fully vaccinated students do not need to quarantine.)\", \"But vaccine skepticism remains high, and uptake has been slow among children aged 12 to 15, who have been eligible for a shot since May. The C.D.C. reports that just 48 percent of them are fully vaccinated, and the vast majority of kids 11 and younger have yet to receive one dose.\", \"\\u201cI loved being a school nurse before Covid,\\u201d McIntyre said. Last month, she resigned.\", \"In other staffing news: As full-time classroom teachers quit or retire, substitute teachers are filling the gaps. Some districts have been forced to cancel classes; others have lowered hiring standards, just to keep an adult in a classroom. In one especially dire shortage, Denver is closing schools this Friday to give adults time for their \\u201chealth and self-care.\\u201d\", \"In other virus news:\", \"This week, \\u201cThe Daily\\u201d podcast is taking a deep dive into school board races.\", \"On Tuesday, the team spoke with my colleague Campbell Robertson, who tracked an escalating argument in Central Bucks, Pa., an important county in national politics. In today\\u2019s episode, Campbell looks closer at what\\u2019s happening inside classrooms there.\", \"\\u201cWhat I am hearing being discussed at the school board meetings isn\\u2019t ways to help us solve our school problems,\\u201d Betsy Coyne, a teacher who has been working in Central Bucks for almost 20 years, said.\", \"These fights mirror those happening in Loudoun County, Va., another suburban district struggling with demographic change.\", \"Parents, inflamed by the district\\u2019s efforts to address racism and promote diversity, crowded meetings to shout and protest. School board members took sides on pandemic restrictions, as masks in meetings became a symbol of partisanship.\", \"Fights about transgender rights also escalated. This week, the school system settled with a teacher who had refused to address transgender students by their pronouns. And a sexual assault in a bathroom became fodder for a false story about transgender students.\", \"As we\\u2019ve reported before, these local fights have national consequences. As Republicans and Democrats dissect educational issues that can be used in the midterm elections next year, places like Loudoun and Central Bucks may well be their case studies.\", \"Also of interest: The Los Angeles Times examined California\\u2019s ethnic studies requirement, slated to go into effect by 2030. The look inside two elective ethnic studies classrooms \\u201cshows teachers\\u2019 intent on creating an environment without judgment, one where students are learning as much about their own cultural roots as those of others.\\u201d\", \"In critical race theory news:\", \"In book censorship news:\", \"College\", \"The social spending package\", \"And the rest \\u2026\", \"Since 1952, The Times been awarding annual prizes to illustrated children\\u2019s books. Since 2017, we\\u2019ve been partnering with the New York Public Library to administer the honor.\", \"Here are this year\\u2019s 10 winners, with illustrations from each. There are books about the subway, the Tulsa race massacre and even a robot in a fairy tale. They\\u2019re beautiful, and we hope you enjoy them.\", \"But as the holidays tick ever closer, here are a few other suggestions.\", \"Younger readers may enjoy these stories about snow, mummies or even philosophy. Middle schoolers can escape on horseback or by riding a bike.\", \"The artistically inclined can marvel at paintings and museums, or learn about famous visual creators or musicians. And a young traveler may enjoy Hayao Miyazaki\\u2019s favorite children\\u2019s book, a Japanese classic now translated into English, or an illustrated memoir about growing up behind the Iron Curtain.\", \"Or, just check out this delightful illustrated story in The Times about Beatrix Potter, a beloved author who created Peter Rabbit.
