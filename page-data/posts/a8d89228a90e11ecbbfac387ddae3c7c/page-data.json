Hook said his Subaru \\\"can't be turned or driven.\\\"\", \"\\\"The cringeworthy thing that gets your blood boiling isn't necessarily the car jumping and crashing\\\", he said. \\\"It's the attitude of these guys and the fact that they're so cocky about it. Then they just get up and leave after it's done.\\\"\", \"\\\"The fact that they tried to jump it is just so dumb,\\\" said Ben Havok, another neighbor in the area. \\\"Everything that happened after is just kind of insane.\\\"\", \"Cliff Magreta, who lives on the street, recorded from his house detailing detailed the \\\"eerie calm\\\" after the vehicle finally settled at the bottom of the hill.\", \"The Tesla reportedly was left at the scene of the incident and no motorist \\u00a0information was available as authorities continued their search. They plan to follow up with the renter of the vehicle and have already filed a misdemeanor hit-and-run report.\", \"Jonathan Sutak was angry, telling CBS L.A., \\\"The cops are gonna do nothing about it because it's property damage,\\\" he said. \\\"No one was hurt; of course if someone was hurt they'd do something about it, but then it would be too late.\\\"\", \"As he picked the debris from the crash from his front yard, Sutak continued to note that he didn't really see an end in sight due to the lack of accountability for these crimes, especially knowing what people will do for a little bit of internet clout.\", \"\\\"I think only if there's a high profile arrest or fine will there be some kind of sign people should not drive Teslas over my house,\\\" he said.\", \"The LAPD said it would be increasing patrols through the vicinity to try to prevent any copycat attempts.\"]","href_hash":"a8d89228a90e11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a8d89228a90e11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
