It was not an easy world to understand: Born in 1940, she had \\u201ca dystopian childhood,\\u201d she told me recently from her home near Albuquerque, N.M. Her father worked as a horse trader, her mother left when she was two and the artist, now 81, spent her early years toiling in fields alongside Filipino migrants and Japanese Americans who\\u2019d been recently released from internment camps, cutting rhubarb in tar paper sheds each winter, picking strawberries and raspberries in the spring and harvesting string beans in the fall.\", \"When she was 7, Smith began hiding in trees to read anything and everything she could borrow from a bookmobile that occasionally passed through town. It was an escape from her work, but not always from the bitter realities of living through an ongoing American genocide. \\u201cThe stories in Steinbeck told me what was going to happen to me when I was older,\\u201d she said to me. \\u201cKnowing what I faced in my future, I even thought about suicide in my teens, which is very common for Native people \\u2026 we were people who were lost and just grasping.\\u201d\", \"Instead, she found inventive and incisive ways to critique how power and hegemony work on canvas, using materials ranging from charcoal and acrylic paints to newspaper print and other text elements. But first she had to walk through doors that were meant to be closed to her, with white gatekeepers doing all they could to hold her back \\u2014 in high school, a guidance counselor suggested vocational courses because, he said, \\u201cIndians don\\u2019t go to college.\\u201d Then, after Smith did just that, first at Olympic College in Washington and then at Framingham State University in Massachusetts, she was discouraged from applying to the M.F.A. program at the University of New Mexico. \\u201cIn the art department, they said, \\u2018Indians go to art ed, you can\\u2019t go to fine arts,\\u2019 \\u201d she told me. \\u201cBecause Indians do crafts.\\u201d Unmoved by the sort of discouragement she\\u2019d already heard, Smith took classes there anyway, ultimately spending four years accumulating credits. Along the way, she met other American Indian artists, people like Emmi Whitehorse and Ed Singer, and formed the Grey Canyon Artists collective.\", \"The art world, by contrast, was somewhat more accepting of Smith\\u2019s ambitions. In 1979, she joined New York\\u2019s Kornblee Gallery after the painter Susan Crile bought some of her work and arranged a meeting between Smith and Jill Kornblee. The following year, after her first solo exhibition at Kornblee received media attention from Art in America and the Village Voice, Smith left the University of New Mexico with an M.A. in visual arts. Three of her abstract pastel, charcoal and graphite pencil on paper pieces from this period are now in the permanent collection of the Whitney Museum of American Art. Even without the strong use of text that has defined so much of Smith\\u2019s work since, they call to mind Kandinsky set loose on the American plains, betraying an already highly evolved style and worldview.\", \"In the subsequent decades, Smith had many more shows and continued to hone and deploy her distinct visual language, one infused with a Pop Art sensibility that often situates the symbols of American empire and Native life alongside one another to striking effect. \\u201cSpam\\u201d (1995), for instance, suggests centuries of lost food traditions through the simple outline of a buffalo painted on a canvas collaged with newspaper clippings, with the title of the work spelled out beneath its hoof. \\u201cGifts for Trading Land With White People\\u201d (1992) incorporates a canvas similarly plastered with pieces of newspaper and inscribed with the image of a canoe. Above the canvas hangs a range of sports memorabilia (baseball caps, bumper stickers) from real sports teams with Native American names or mascots. And in \\u201cState Names\\u201d (2000), a multicolored map of the United States seems to ooze with dripping paint that obscures the few state and territory names that didn\\u2019t stem from Indigenous sources.\", \"Smith\\u2019s new body of work, \\u201cIndigenizing the Colonized U.S. Map,\\u201d 12 large-scale mixed-media paintings that form the majority of \\u201cWoman in Landscape,\\u201d on view now at the Garth Greenan Gallery in New York, is a continuation of her decades-long interest in maps. These canvases feature different renderings of a U.S. map turned on its side, awash in color and plastered with text and other collage elements that highlight the disorienting effect of being handed a map of your home by the person who has stolen it from you. \\u201cA map is not an empty form for me, it\\u2019s not an icon of this incredible country,\\u201d the artist told me. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not just a vacant idea, it\\u2019s real. It\\u2019s about real land \\u2014 stolen land, polluted land.\\u201d When she looks at a map, she sees the many reservations she\\u2019s visited and the many people she\\u2019s known on them. She sees bloodshed, oil pipelines; she sees the climate disaster brought about by the plundering of resources. And, at the same time, she sees the miracle that is our continued existence as American Indians.\", \"\\u201cI think I\\u2019m a miracle and I say that whenever I talk to an audience,\\u201d Smith said. \\u201cI tell them: \\u2018I\\u2019m a miracle, and any Native person here is a miracle.\\u2019 And I say that to you, Joshua \\u2014 the fact that you are here talking to me is a miracle.\\u201d Below, her answers to T\\u2019s Artist\\u2019s Questionnaire.\", \"What is your day like? What\\u2019s your work schedule?\", \"It includes a lot of administrative work, like answering requests for reference letters from young Natives, and dealing with questions from museums that still write and ask things like \\u201cDo you know any Native American artists?\\u201d even though there are half a dozen that are in the news all the time. In this book I\\u2019m working on [for Thames & Hudson], I hope to feature 250 contemporary Natives, and I could double that number easily. So that\\u2019s part of my day. And then the other part is working here in my studio or doing things with my granddaughters.\", \"What does your studio look like?\", \"One wall is covered with supplies, which I\\u2019ve collected over the years because [the artist] Fritz Scholder told me one time, \\u201cDon\\u2019t ever run out of paint and don\\u2019t ever run out of canvases.\\u201d So I\\u2019ve tended to always order more than what I need. In the next room is a big library of books. I have a lot of books because, since childhood, I\\u2019ve always valued them. And then there are always multiple works underway here.\", \"Could you tell me about the benefits of having a library next to your studio?\", \"Because I\\u2019m a chameleon in a sense, I\\u2019ll be working on a painting and think, \\u201cOh, I need to get my books of plateau pictographs out,\\u201d then I\\u2019ll rummage through my library and pull out what I need. I\\u2019ve got a dozen books that I pulled out before I started drawing my mother earth figure here, \\u201cWoman in Landscape\\u201d (2021). I\\u2019ll look things up, then go to work and scramble it all up and make my own thing out of it.\", \"When you start a new piece, where do you begin?\", \"I often begin with an idea, a very general idea, like maps. I\\u2019ve done maps before, but they\\u2019ve always been horizontal, like maps would normally be. That was my plan with these maps here, behind me, but then I stood them up to get them out of the way and I saw how it really changes the shape of the map \\u2014 it becomes an organic thing, like a side of beef. It\\u2019s kind of creepy. And then I thought about that, and about what else I could do to that map, and got the idea that maybe I could put some beadwork designs or something on part of it. So I did a little bit of that and it scared me, so I stopped and worked on some other stuff, then came back to it and thought, \\u201cYeah, that\\u2019s really kind of weird.\\u201d I have to grow into it when I do something like that.\", \"And how do you know when you\\u2019re done?\", \"Generally, I get it to a place where I think it might be done and then I\\u2019ll wait awhile before leaving it at that. You know, it\\u2019s like when you\\u2019re writing something and you leave it for a while and come back to it and, suddenly, you can see all the things that you need to fix. At that point you\\u2019re pretty sure that it\\u2019s probably OK. Then, of course, I\\u2019ve got my son, Neal Ambrose-Smith, who is an incredible artist, and I\\u2019ll call him up and invite him to come over and take a look.\", \"What\\u2019s the first work you ever sold? And how much did you sell it for?\", \"I think it was a pastel, back in the early \\u201970s, for maybe $45.\", \"How many assistants do you have?\", \"None. I mean, my son is generous and kind and he\\u2019s helping me with this butterfly mask because he\\u2019s an incredible fabricator. But he\\u2019s an artist in his own right, not an assistant. So I don\\u2019t have one, but I wish I did. I am very blessed, though. A couple of times I\\u2019ve had people come to help me straighten up a bit because I tend to clutter, and if I\\u2019m in desperate straits and have to show somebody the studio my son will come over and help neaten things up for me.\", \"What music do you play when you\\u2019re making art?\", \"Often it\\u2019s quiet in here, but I love Native flute music. I love Spanish guitar. I love Bach a lot. Those are my go-tos.\", \"Is there a meal that you eat on repeat when you\\u2019re working?\", \"I eat a lot of beans and rice. I\\u2019m a vegetarian, so I eat a lot of salad, and my granddaughters will eat that with me.\", \"When did you first feel comfortable saying you\\u2019re a professional artist?\", \"I didn\\u2019t think of myself as worthy of that title for a long time, even after I\\u2019d sold work. I had no idea where it was going. I know now from teaching that white students are filled with agency and say that they\\u2019re an artist, that they\\u2019re going to New York, that they\\u2019re going to get in a gallery. And I\\u2019m amazed at that because I can tell you that when I was going through that part of my journey, I did not ever think that any of these things were going to happen. I just stumbled into them, then wondered, \\u201cHow did I get here? If somebody finds out that I\\u2019m really not worthy of this, they\\u2019re going to tell other people.\\u201d\", \"When I served on the College Art Association board I was the first Native to do that. I\\u2019ve been the first Native to do a lot of stuff, and each time I\\u2019m thinking, \\u201cHow did I get here?\\u201d I still remember people talking about their parents taking them to Europe on their summer vacations, and meanwhile I wasn\\u2019t inside of a museum until I was in my 20s.\", \"How often do you talk to other artists?\", \"I talk to my son every other day or every few days. A lot of times, if I\\u2019m lonely, I\\u2019ll call him up just to talk about art. And if I can get out to something, which we haven\\u2019t been able to do because of Covid, I\\u2019ve got some Native girlfriends that are my age in Santa Fe: Linda Lomahaftewa, who is Hopi and Choctaw, and Karita Coffey. They\\u2019ve been my friends for 40 years. I love to get together with them and talk Indian politics and Native art.\", \"What\\u2019s your worst habit?\", \"I gave up booze in the late \\u201970s because so many of my family members had died from it. And then I continued to smoke but gave that up in the mid-90s. Those were really my worst habits, but I keep working on improving myself.\", \"What are you reading right now?\", \"Joan Didion. I\\u2019ve got a pile of maybe eight Native writers on my night stand, like Heid Erdrich, Louise Erdrich, a guy named Hobson. And I must have four Joy Harjo books there, too, because I love her poetry. But I was reading some writer\\u2019s biography and they said that Joan Didion had the biggest impact on them, so I got \\u201cSlouching Towards Bethlehem\\u201d (1968) and I\\u2019m around halfway through it.\", \"What is your favorite artwork by someone else?\", \"I love Philip Guston for his storytelling and his painting, and the reason I\\u2019m drawn to his work is because it\\u2019s the stories of the Jews and how they fled the Holocaust. That story resonates with me. And then James Ensor, who made all those political paintings. He had a retrospective in New York and I flew to New York just to see it. I stayed all day in the museum studying his work and then flew back home at midnight. Goya is another one, especially his work about war. His \\u201cLos Caprichos\\u201d (published in 1799) is just stunning.\", \"What\\u2019s the weirdest object in your studio?\", \"I\\u2019ve got a sculpture here that\\u2019s actually affected several paintings or drawings I\\u2019ve done. It\\u2019s a Mexican sculpture I found in a secondhand shop in Albuquerque\\u2019s Old Town and it didn\\u2019t have a base, so I just put a little piece of wood under the feet here. It may not actually be from Mexico, it could be from here. There was no name on it. But it speaks to me \\u2014 about oppression, imperialism, hegemony.\", \"This interview has been edited and condensed.\"]","href_hash":"81fe4ad853c011ecb652d7df2ef5cd5d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"81fe4ad853c011ecb652d7df2ef5cd5d"}},
