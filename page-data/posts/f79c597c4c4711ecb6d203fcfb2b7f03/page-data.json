It purports to help you operate elevator buttons and open latches and poke your phone without touching any of them. This item was, at best, a silly response to what turned out to be an airborne virus. And yet at the same time it reflects something fundamental to the human experience: the urge to tinker and design and adapt in the face of crises large and small.\", \"Some of those responses prove fleeting; others endure. In the immediate aftermath of 9/11, American airports bristled with armed soldiers. That went away, but the security procedures surrounding air travel were permanently transformed; it\\u2019s hard to explain to someone under 25 just how comparatively breezy movement through an airport used to be. Today, every time you toss your shoes into a plastic bin before boarding a plane \\u2014 or submit to a biometric identification procedure to avoid that process \\u2014 you are living in the designed legacy of a past crisis.\", \"It\\u2019s fascinating to consider what the physical legacies of the pandemic might be. The most obvious example \\u2014 the face mask, in its profusion of options and styles \\u2014 was far from obvious at first. In April 2020, the chairman of Uniqlo\\u2019s parent company declared with confidence that the Tokyo-based retailer \\u201cwill not sell masks.\\u201d In hindsight, that was an astonishing assertion, given that the cloth face mask would become the unavoidable icon of the era. After health authorities belatedly advised its widespread use, there were not enough to go around, and practically every apparel maker, from Gap to Louis Vuitton to countless independent sellers on Etsy, began selling face masks. This transition from exotic item to familiar one seemed to happen overnight.\", \"In East Asia, previous viral outbreaks (SARS, H1N1, etc.) had already made masks a routine accessory for anyone feeling a bit under the weather, or just looking to avoid the seasonal flu. It\\u2019s now easy to imagine that behavior repeating across the metropoles of the United States and Europe \\u2014 \\u201cessentially the normalizing of people wearing masks in everyday situations,\\u201d says Christian L\\u2019Orange, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at Colorado State University, who has researched mask materials and effectiveness. For a generation of children, classroom use has made it familiar. \\u201cThere has certainly been a huge increase in the number and style of masks that are available,\\u201d and significant improvements in the fabrics used by some makers of cloth masks, L\\u2019Orange continued; we now have studies showing that cloth masks with higher thread counts are better filters, and that masks combining a layer of cotton with another material layer can also be more effective.\", \"One prime example, it turns out, is the line of masks Uniqlo wound up making. Citing customer demand, the company changed course in June 2020, selling a mask using a proprietary fabric that it previously used for, among other things, underwear. Its \\u201cAIRism\\u201d mesh material promised to be lighter and more breathable than cotton, enclosing a filter within layers comfortable to the skin. The mask was an immediate hit in Japan and rolled out worldwide, soon trendy enough to make Vogue and GQ and Hypebeast. By this past summer, the company signaled that masks would remain part of its permanent mix. \\u201cWe believe there will continue to be a need for masks,\\u201d Uniqlo\\u2019s U.S. chief marketing officer told The Times in August, \\u201cand we have decided to offer the product year-round.\\u201d The mask\\u2019s surprising status as a divisive ideological symbol has obscured a more significant development: It has become a mainstream, quotidian object.\", \"While the mask might seem, for better or worse, a kind of icon of the pandemic, this era is still redesigning our world. There may never be the kind of definitive end to Covid-19 that we all crave, no decisive before-and-after moment. But for nearly two years now, we\\u2019ve been gradually but steadily redesigning the world in response to this crisis. And whenever things get back to normal \\u2014 whatever that looks like \\u2014 our world will be full of these changes that, blatant or stealthy, will alter the texture of our lives.\", \"If the mask is a designed object we resisted and ultimately capitulated to, some pandemic design experiments may outlive the era because a significant number of people \\u2014 or businesses \\u2014 have actually welcomed and embraced them. Consider the way the early pandemic period absolutely brutalized the dining business. Even when regulations eased, restaurants large and small had to reassure customers of their safety. Seating arrangements were adjusted, staff masked up \\u2014 and in many cases, menus disappeared, on the theory that people didn\\u2019t want to handle an object many others had touched. This ended up giving new life to a bit of information design that seemed to have peaked in the U.S. a decade or so ago: the QR code. Now you could wave your phone over one of these pixelated blobs and access a digital menu \\u2014 and sometimes even order without talking to a server.\", \"We now know that touching a menu is a highly unlikely way to contract the virus. But QR codes have proved sticky anyway. The reason is economic. Even before the pandemic, restaurants traditionally ran on very thin margins. The savings on printing costs alone are a significant incentive, but a digital menu could allow restaurants to nudge prices in real-time response to their own market costs. \\u201cQR codes have had this refresh, a new lease on life, because of Covid,\\u201d says Aaron Allen, a consultant in the hospitality industry. Millions of people finally learned how to interact with them; hotels and other businesses figured out how to use them to replace brochures and other print collateral. \\u201cWhat was probably going to fade away,\\u201d Allen says, \\u201chas become relevant in a way that will extend its life.\\u201d\", \"But maybe not everywhere. Particularly at the higher end, the printed menu is one of the most conspicuous design platforms a restaurant has. \\u201cBetter restaurants are going to be going back to real menus quite soon, because having that object in your hand is part of that greeting experience,\\u201d says Warren Ashworth, an architect and hospitality design expert. More value-focused eateries and chains will likely stick with the QR option that saves costs and time. So the way we react to the presence of a QR code may evolve accordingly. But we\\u2019ll know what it is \\u2014 and it will be hard to explain that these interfaces used to be an overhyped curiosity with little practical value.\", \"More significant, the normalization of the QR code as information-design surface has implications that transcend the restaurant and hospitality business, as designers figure out new ways to deploy it. Viewed expansively, QR is \\u201ca low-cost gateway\\u201d to information that can be constantly updated and adjusted, says Sandy Speicher, chief executive officer of the design firm IDEO. Retailers from Foot Locker to Macy\\u2019s have begun to use the codes as part of a touchless-payment option; small businesses such as hair salons use them for appointment check-ins, or to make it easier to tip barbers through Venmo. The familiarity and acceptance spread partly by restaurant (and patron) adaptation served as a sort of proof of concept for the form \\u2014 a decade late. \\u201cThat it scaled up that pervasively, that quickly, is remarkable,\\u201d Speicher says.\", \"\\u201cSometimes these emergencies become opportunities to create new baselines,\\u201d says Paola Antonelli, senior curator of architecture and design at MoMA. This is not always an intentional or conscious process, and the results can be troubling. The ways in which the aftermath of 9/11 helped reset baseline expectations around privacy and surveillance serve as a cautionary example. But, Antonelli says, the pandemic has perhaps established some positive new norms. This reflects another design side effect of the pandemic era: rapid experimentation, born of desperation.\", \"There\\u2019s an argument to be made that the pandemic proved that research and innovation processes in the sciences and beyond need a refresh. Certainly it was remarkable, Antonelli points out, how quickly city governments moved to accommodate experiments like new bike lanes and allowing eateries to build outdoor spaces. Not everyone is a fan of those new structures, and it seems very likely that some kind of regulatory standards will emerge. But given the intense economic pressure to do something to help the restaurant industry and its workers, the new spaces came together with a speed that would have been \\u201cunthinkable\\u201d two years ago, says Ellen Fisher, vice president for academic affairs and dean at the New York School of Interior Design.\", \"And Fisher believes the effects will last: \\u201cI think it\\u2019s really expanded the design vocabulary of the restaurant, what the boundaries are.\\u201d In a sense, she argues, it has returned the eatery to earlier roots as a center of community and gathering, \\u201calmost like a modern-day version of the plaza \\u2014 like in Venice, the extension of the cafe into the square. I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s ever going to go away.\\u201d\", \"One place where this particular \\u201cdesign emergency,\\u201d as Antonelli calls it, has been most visible is the white-collar workplace. There has been much fevered speculation about the way offices might now be redesigned and re-envisioned to accommodate a \\u201chybrid\\u201d model, with a chunk of employees opting to continue working from home a few days a week. Maybe desks will be configured differently, ending the reign of the widely loathed open-office scheme; maybe there will be even stranger developments. A company called Poppy is marketing a device that can monitor the air for traces of pathogens.\", \"But so far, it\\u2019s the other side of the work-home dyad that has been more definitively redesigned. White-collar work has invaded the home, bringing office life into the domestic sphere in unprecedented ways. It\\u2019s now routine for office workers to reconsider some chunk of their home as a de facto studio. Early in the pandemic era, it was understandable if you checked into a digital meeting looking a bit ragged on your couch, or even opted to keep your video off. The fact that everyone was in the same position made such laxity possible; but once people are back in the office, and your video-connected colleagues are increasingly crisp-looking, well groomed and smartly lit, the calculus will be different.\", \"And a whole ecosystem of products offers help. Logitech webcams now sell at triple the level they did two years ago. Sales of flattering \\u201cring\\u201d lights \\u2014 a halo of LED bulbs that smooth out shadows and minimize blemishes favored by social media influencers \\u2014 are five times higher than they were a year ago, according to The NPD Group, a market research firm. In fact, the normalization of video distance by now transcends the workplace. Events from funerals to bar mitzvahs now accommodate video guests. Book readings and concerts and lectures have opened up to remote attendance. In education, distance learning transitioned from the experimental to a de facto standard practically overnight. (New York City has moved to end snow days, replacing them with remote learning \\u2014 to the dismay of teachers and students alike.) Clearly, not all of these changes will stick. But just as clearly, a barrier has been breached, and the simple acceptability of video connection seems permanent \\u2014 and significant.\", \"Forcing such breaks may be the core legacy of the pandemic\\u2019s effect on design and innovation. It changed minds. For example: Phil Libin, a creator of the Evernote app and a founder of the product studio All Turtles, was among those who just wanted things to get back to the way they were. \\u201cI was an in-person kind of person,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI was a big proponent of fancy, nice offices.\\u201d In fact, what he didn\\u2019t like was video meetings. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t realize that the office was a central problem,\\u201d he continues. \\u201cNow I think it\\u2019s literally one of the dumbest ideas.\\u201d\", \"Eventually, Libin shut down All Turtles\\u2019 physical offices and moved from San Francisco to northwest Arkansas. He and a few colleagues developed software designed to improve video presentations and calls, eventually building a whole new start-up called Mmhmm around it. \\u201cWe used to be doing this totally wrong,\\u201d he says. \\u201cWhy would I commute to an office, to sit in a cubicle and put on headphones to isolate myself from other people who had to commute to the office, so that I can get some work done? That makes zero sense.\\u201d The office made work inefficient, and interfered with life, he argues; the shift away from it is, in his eyes, \\u201cpermanent.\\u201d\", \"Looking back, Libin says the total rethink of the office is \\u201cone of the great silver linings of the pandemic.\\u201d It was remarkable how frequently some version of this sentiment came up in my conversations about the design legacies of the Covid-19 plague. In a way that seems distinct from other crisis periods in recent memory, there\\u2019s an overt determination to extract positive lessons from an emergency that has lasted so much longer than most of us thought it would.\", \"This thought may be difficult to square with some of the implications of the designed responses to this crisis. The mass adoption of masks, and the general theme of increased distance, are frankly a little depressing. QR codes, for all their efficiency, further enable the personal-data tracking that was already one of the most vexing issues of modern life. And if it\\u2019s really true that virtual hybridity could become a routine component of the most momentous occasions in our lives \\u2014 weddings, funerals and so on \\u2014 then the startling and rather grim implication is that somehow we will grow comfortable spending even more time in front of our screens.\", \"So how is it possible we might nevertheless emerge optimistic from this era? Maybe it\\u2019s simply because this particular crisis has been so slow and lasting: We\\u2019ve had time to learn that a no-touch door opener has a limited future, but that other changes have durable potential. And more than that, we\\u2019ve also had time to consider more deeply whether we can improve our workplaces, our cities \\u2014 whether, after a decade of tech-centric thinking, we can have a more people-centric restart. Maybe this is a singular chance to reconsider how to make all our dazzling technologies work for us, rather than the other way around.\", \"\\u201cIf Covid happened five years ago, it could have been a very different experience,\\u201d Libin muses. \\u201cWe\\u2019re very fortunate that underlying technology and platforms were good enough that we actually could do this kind of stuff. Maybe we wouldn\\u2019t really have been so ready to think about silver linings.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f79c597c4c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f79c597c4c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}},
