But what about that altitude?","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-05T09:14:59.000Z","content":"[\"After two decades of wandering the globe, the WTA Finals had finally found a home, or so it seemed in 2019.\", \"That was the first year the finals were held, to great fanfare, in Shenzhen, China, under a deal that would keep the tournament there for 10 years.\", \"The event has not been back since, and on Wednesday it will instead be played in Guadalajara, Mexico, after an agreement in September.\", \"The tournament, which has been played under different names over the years, has long been a bit nomadic. It was held at Madison Square Garden from 1979 to 2000 and has moved five times from 2001 to 2013. It then spent five years in Singapore.\", \"The pandemic forced the cancellation of last year\\u2019s tournament, the first time it had not been held since the finals began nearly 50 years ago, when the finals were called the Virginia Slims Championships.\", \"This year, with the Akron WTA Finals Guadalajara, that means some players will be competing in one of the biggest tournaments outside of the Grand Slams in the third different city in the last three finals.\", \"\\u201cI personally don\\u2019t care if the location changes every year; it\\u2019s always exciting to be able to compete in the event,\\u201d said Garbi\\u00f1e Muguruza of Spain, who qualified three times from 2015 to 2017 and is one of the eight players invited to play singles this year.\", \"For months, the WTA planned a return to Shenzhen, while having parallel discussions with other cities, including Hong Kong.\", \"\\u201cKnowing the situation was less than clear, we had a Plan A, a Plan B and a Plan C,\\u201d said Micky Lawler, the WTA president. \\u201cWe wanted to give our top players a chance to compete the way they deserved to end 2021, but putting on events is really tough during a pandemic, and circumstances keep changing and are out of your control.\\u201d\", \"The tour ended up going with Plan D: Guadalajara.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s very difficult to plan an event at this scale, and they offered a great solution in a market where we already had a tournament,\\u201d Lawler said, referring to the lower-level tournament held there in March. (The No. 1 seed was 46th-ranked Nadia Podoroska of Argentina.)\", \"The WTA was impressed by the team that ran that tournament, but also there was no Plan E, Lawler said. \\u201cThis wasn\\u2019t a situation of \\u2018Let\\u2019s choose between places,\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt was, \\u2018We don\\u2019t want a second year in a row without a WTA Finals, so let\\u2019s put all our resources together and make this work.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Lawler said that Steve Simon, the WTA chief executive, was running weekly board meetings and that the tour held constant discussions with the players and the sponsors. \\u201cEveryone\\u2019s attitude was that this was not what we planned for, but they would support it because it was better than no tournament.\\u201d\", \"While Lawler is certain that there will be challenges \\u2014 she points to a sudden Covid-related lockdown that started during a recent tournament in Moscow \\u2014 she is confident that they will be surmountable. Many of the players are certainly eager for the tournament, even if there are obstacles. (The exception is Ashleigh Barty, the tour\\u2019s top-ranked player and the defending champion. She is skipping the tournament to avoid another stint in quarantine after returning to her native Australia.)\", \"Karolina Pliskova said reaching the WTA Finals was always a personal goal when the season started. This is her fifth straight year at the tournament, making her the only player besides Muguruza with experience in the event. The newcomers competing in singles are Paula Badosa, Anett Kontaveit, Barbora Krejcikova, Aryna Sabalenka, Maria Sakkari and Iga Swiatek.\", \"Pliskova, who is the only person to play in Singapore, Shenzhen and now Guadalajara over three consecutive WTA Finals, said the shift in locales erased some of her advantage.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s better for players who have never played in the tournament because if it was in the same place each year, players who had been there would know how the courts play and know all the activities and would feel more relaxed,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThis year, everybody is basically starting from zero.\\u201d\", \"The biggest difference between Guadalajara and pretty much any other WTA Finals location is the altitude. The city is about 5,000 feet above sea level, which will make the ball fly faster but trickier to control, while also challenging players to catch their breath after long rallies.\", \"\\u201cThe altitude is a salient factor, and it came up in conversations with the players, but everyone\\u2019s in the same boat,\\u201d Lawler said, adding that it is no different from having a surface that favors certain players. \\u201cThese players are the best of the best, so while some will love it less, they\\u2019re going to adjust.\\u201d\", \"Krejcikova said that she had no experience playing at that altitude, but that she did not care about how it would change the game. \\u201cI\\u2019m just happy to be going to the WTA Finals,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI always wanted to play against the other top players to see where my level is.\\u201d\", \"She said that she believed that the bigger hitters and servers might benefit from getting extra velocity on their power shots, resulting in shorter points, but that she would not decide how to adjust her game until she practiced there.\", \"Muguruza said the strongest players might benefit from the altitude. But the extra velocity comes with a catch. \\u201cIt will be the ones who can control their power who will have more opportunities,\\u201d she said, because balls could easily sail long or wide.\", \"Pliskova said she might change the tension on her strings to give her more control or more spin.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to change too much \\u2014 my game is my game \\u2014 but I may change a little,\\u201d she said, adding that someone who was good at defending might benefit if players could not control their shots, as long as they were in good enough condition to handle long points at that altitude.\", \"Although the WTA hopes to return the finals to Shenzhen in 2022, there is hope that this rare visit from the game\\u2019s best players will give the sport a boost in Mexico. Heather Bowler, a spokeswoman for the International Tennis Federation, said in an email that at the recreational and amateur level Mexico had the lowest ratio in the region of players to population and the lowest percentage of female players.\", \"\\u201cBringing an elite-level tournament, WTA Finals will drive awareness and increase an appetite for the game, so it certainly is a good basis on which to build on in the future,\\u201d she wrote, \\u201cand the WTA should be a great catalyst for sport in the region and for Mexico as a nation.\\u201d\", \"Lawler said that while nothing was in the works, increased interest could eventually lead to bigger tournaments and more resources for young players in the region, creating a positive cycle. \\u201cIf there is an appetite to build something in Mexico, we would do everything we can to support it,\\u201d she said.\", \"Krejcikova said she thought about the way the sport and the players were seen by girls at every tournament, but especially when it was someplace new.\", \"\\u201cI hope we are good examples for them,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand can have a big impact on the younger generation in Mexico.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c03d2a8f3e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c03d2a8f3e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}},
