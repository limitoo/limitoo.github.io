The authorities, she said, reported that he had been involved in a burglary and killed after a tussle over a gun.\", \"Her own trip to investigate the scene of his death \\u2014 his blood still visible on the ground \\u2014 made her only more skeptical. Nearly three months later, when a video became public showing Mr. Arbery being chased, cornered and then shot at close range, she felt vindicated and angry \\u2014 an anger that has persisted nearly two years.\", \"Ms. Brooks, 37, who works in retail, is among many members of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s large extended family and circle of friends who have been both grief-stricken and galvanized to action since his death in February 2020. Over the past month, as the case against the three men charged with murder has played out in the Glynn County Courthouse, they have watched with anguish as the gruesome details of the final moments of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s life \\u2014 but nearly none of his humanity \\u2014 were described to the jury. Part of the family\\u2019s role, Ms. Brooks said, is helping the public understand who her nephew was.\", \"\\u201cThis activism kicked in me that I never saw myself being a part of,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI feel that every day that I go out, I have to have some kind of representation of Ahmaud.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Brooks has attended the trial regularly, filling notebooks with detailed descriptions of what is said by witnesses, lawyers and the judge. At the end of the day, she cross-references media coverage to make sure her notes are accurate before going live on Facebook to relay the day\\u2019s events to people around the world.\", \"Diane Arbery, another of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s aunts, has been outside the courthouse all day, every day talking to supporters. So has Carla Arbery, an aunt whose children were especially close to Mr. Arbery. Ruby Arbery, still another of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s aunts, has brought home-cooked meals for family members and supporters. Mr. Arbery\\u2019s parents have attended every day of the trial, each arriving with his or her own lawyer, and sometimes sitting with high-profile civil rights activists, including the Rev. Al Sharpton and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve been trying to watch every second, every minute because I don\\u2019t want to miss anything,\\u201d said Akeem Baker, one of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s best friends since childhood. \\u201cI feel like if I take my eyes off it, I don\\u2019t want anything to kind of slip through the cracks.\\u201d\", \"Many of those closest to Mr. Arbery begin and end the day with a prayer. They pray throughout the day for the strength to keep watching. \\u201cWe need prayer,\\u201d Diane Arbery said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve got to keep praying, and we ask everyone out there to keep praying for us.\\u201d\", \"Last week, Black pastors from across the country joined the family in Brunswick in a show of support after a defense lawyer asked that Black pastors and civil rights leaders not be allowed in the courtroom because they could intimidate the jury.\", \"\\u201cMy heart is full of just joy in the midst of this broken heart,\\u201d Wanda Cooper-Jones, Mr. Arbery\\u2019s mother, told the assembled crowd before asking the pastors and activists to say her son\\u2019s name.\", \"Ms. Brooks and Mr. Arbery\\u2019s other aunts were there too, wearing T-shirts that said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s the Black pastors for me.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Arbery, 25, was known to his family and friends as Maud or Quez. He had been a standout linebacker for the Brunswick High School Pirates and dreamed of playing professional football. He left town briefly to attend a technical school but eventually returned to the Brunswick area and was living with his mother. \\u201cHis mom was his queen,\\u201d Mr. Baker said.\", \"He liked rapping and listening to trap music. After a hard day, he sometimes went to Madge Merritt Park, near Brunswick, to rap to clear his mind. He had recently started a job doing landscaping work with his father, and he was also working at a truck wash, according to a friend. He also had a mental illness that caused him to have auditory hallucinations.\", \"James Trimmings, who grew up and played football with Mr. Arbery, described his devotion to his friends. He said Mr. Arbery was always happy to babysit for his two children.\", \"\\u201cIf you called Maud and he didn\\u2019t pick up, he\\u2019d call you back,\\u201d Mr. Trimmings said. \\u201cBut if you didn\\u2019t answer, he\\u2019d come find you because he worried you weren\\u2019t OK. Everyone should be so lucky to have a friend like Maud.\\u201d\", \"The picture of Mr. Arbery painted by the lawyers for the men accused in his death has been difficult for the family to hear. One lawyer, building an argument that his assailants had reason to believe Mr. Arbery was responsible for a string of neighborhood break-ins, described him as \\u201can intruder\\u201d who was caught four times on video \\u201cplundering around\\u201d a house under construction in the neighborhood.\", \"Mr. Arbery\\u2019s aunts and grandmother said that the day the medical examiner spoke was the hardest. The testimony left no doubt in their minds that Mr. Arbery died afraid and alone.\", \"Ms. Brooks has been focused on that moment since she first learned of her nephew\\u2019s death. Though she and Mr. Arbery had grown apart after he moved to a different part of town with his mother, they had spent considerable time together in the months before he was killed. She checked in on him every few days while his mother was out of town for work. He didn\\u2019t have a car, so she made sure he had groceries.\", \"On Feb. 23, 2020, Ms. Brooks drove to the Satilla Shores neighborhood outside Brunswick as soon as she got off work \\u2014 her disbelief at the news of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s death there compelling her to see for herself.\", \"\\u201cI was distraught,\\u201d she said. She was surprised to see that the house her nephew was accused of burglarizing had no windows or doors; it was still under construction.\", \"\\u201cBurglary,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt just kept playing in my mind, \\u2018How can you burglarize this?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Ms. Brooks began keeping track of local news articles mentioning Mr. Arbery, trying to piece together what happened. She wanted everyone to know what happened to her nephew and for his killers to be held accountable.\", \"Eventually, three men \\u2014 Travis McMichael, his father, Gregory McMichael, and their neighbor William Bryan \\u2014 were charged with murder. The case became among the most high-profile in the country, contributed to the national furor over shooting deaths of Black people and the wave of protests against systemic racism. In Georgia, it propelled lawmakers to enact hate crimes legislation and to largely dismantle the state\\u2019s citizen\\u2019s arrest law.\", \"In the months since, Ms. Brooks has marched through the streets of Brunswick chanting Mr. Arbery\\u2019s name, knocked on doors telling residents the story of her nephew\\u2019s life and death and urged them to vote out the district attorney who initially refused to press charges against the suspects in Mr. Arbery\\u2019s killing. Her nephew\\u2019s name and likeness are on her car, her clothing, her jewelry.\", \"\\u201cTravis McMichael got up there and talked about fearing for his son,\\u201d Ms. Brooks said. \\u201cMaud was someone\\u2019s son. What about the son he took away from Wanda and Marcus? The son that we love that we will never see again, who will never go home again?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"edb0e8524b7e11ecaa1c65446754d144"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"edb0e8524b7e11ecaa1c65446754d144"}},
