Sabry, along with a new central bank governor, was brought in as part of a new team to tackle the situation.\", \"But, aware of the brewing crisis, the government did seek help from countries, including India and China. Last December, the then finance minister travelled to New Delhi to arrange $1.9b in credit lines and swaps from India.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/142075/eight_col_000_328G6GH.jpg?1650247165\\\" alt=\\\"Protesters hold placards as they participate in an anti-government demonstration near the president's office in Colombo on April 17, 2022, d (Photo by Ishara S.
