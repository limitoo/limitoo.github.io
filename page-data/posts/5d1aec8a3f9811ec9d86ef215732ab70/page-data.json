For most, the shift automatically occurred on their smartphone, meaning that when they woke up this morning they had the accurate time. But the change also means a difference in the time gap between parts of the country.\", \"All but two states, Hawaii and Arizona (except the Navajo Nation), observe daylight saving time. So for people in 48 states, clocks went back one hour on Sunday. That means that the time difference between New York and Phoenix went from a three-hour difference on Saturday to a two-hour difference on Sunday.\", \"On Saturday, the time difference between New York and Honolulu was six hours. That decreased to a five-hour difference on Sunday.\", \"Since Chicago, Atlanta and Los Angeles are all in states that observe daylight saving time, there's no change in the time difference between New York and those cities. On Sunday, there is still no time difference between New York and Atlanta, a one-hour difference with Chicago and a three-hour difference with Los Angeles.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927431/did-time-change-end-daylight-saving-time.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Daylight standard time returns on Sunday.

States don't have the option to stay on daylight saving time, although some lawmakers are hoping to change that.\", \"Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has repeatedly introduced bills to make daylight saving time permanent, citing the benefits of having the extra hour of daylight. Rubio's most recent attempt has garnered bipartisan co-sponsors, including Democratic Senators Ron Wyden, Ed Markey and Sheldon Whitehouse.\", \"\\\"Changing the clock twice a year is outdated and unnecessary,\\\" Senator Rick Scott, a Florida Republican, said Thursday in a statement.\", \"\\\"We need to give families in Florida more sunshine, not less!\\\" he continued. \\\"I'm proud to be leading this bipartisan legislation with Senator Rubio that makes a much-needed change and benefits so many in Florida and across the nation. It's time for Congress to act, and we can begin by having the U.S. Senate pass this good bill today.\\\"\", \"In 2018, Scott signed legislation that would let Florida remain on daylight saving time year-round. Other states have passed similar measures, but without action from Congress to change the Uniform Time Act, it's little more than a gesture of support.\", \"So without congressional action, much of America will remain on daylight standard time until March, when clocks will move forward one hour for the return of daylight saving time.\"]","href_hash":"5d1aec8a3f9811ec9d86ef215732ab70"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5d1aec8a3f9811ec9d86ef215732ab70"}},
