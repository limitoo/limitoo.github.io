Three students were killed and several others were left critically and seriously injured.\", \"A 15-year-old male student was later arrested in connection with the shooting and was being held at a juvenile jail, the authorities said.\", \"The deadly gunfire in Oxford, in Oakland County \\u2014 about 30 miles north of Detroit \\u2014 added to a growing list of shootings on school grounds in the United States this year after a lull during the coronavirus pandemic, when many schools held classes remotely.\", \"The shooting was the deadliest this year, according to Education Week, which tracks such shootings and reported that there had been 28 so far in 2021.\", \"Many details, including the name of the suspect and a motive, remained unclear. Here\\u2019s what we know.\", \"At 12:51 p.m. on Tuesday, the authorities received the first of more than a hundred 911 calls about the shooting.\", \"When students at Oxford High School first heard the gunshots, they rushed for cover and used chairs to barricade themselves behind classroom doors. Within five minutes, the authorities said, 11 people had been shot.\", \"The gunman fired 15 to 20 shots with a semiautomatic handgun before being apprehended by deputies in the school hallway, the authorities said. Seven bullets remained in the gun, the county sheriff, Michael Bouchard, said at a news briefing on Tuesday night.\", \"Had there been no intervention, Sheriff Bouchard added, \\u201cwe might be, if it\\u2019s possible, in a worse situation.\\u201d\", \"After the shooting, students said they fled from the building. Some parents rushed to a nearby grocery store to reunite with their children.\", \"Officials across the country expressed shock and issued statements of sadness and frustration, as residents of Oakland County announced a vigil and prepared for funerals.\", \"Democratic leaders renewed their calls for more to be done to reduce gun violence.\", \"\\u201cNo one should be afraid to go to school,\\u201d Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan said in a statement.

She remained on a ventilator Tuesday night.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s looking very tough for this young girl,\\u201d Sheriff Bouchard said.\", \"The only adult who was injured, an unidentified 47-year-old teacher, had been discharged from the hospital, he added.\", \"Few details are known about the arrested student, whom the authorities have described as a sophomore at Oxford High School and a resident of Oxford Village, a suburb with a population of fewer than 3,500 people.\", \"After the suspect was apprehended, he declined to speak while in the presence of his parents, officials said. The family has hired a lawyer, they added.\", \"Officials have not identified a motive.\", \"\\u201cThe person that\\u2019s got the most insight into the motive is not talking,\\u201d Sheriff Bouchard said at the news briefing.\", \"He added that the 9-millimeter Sig Sauer handgun used in the shooting had been bought by the suspect\\u2019s father four days earlier. The gun had 15 round magazines, he said, two of which had so far been found at the school.\", \"The authorities said that they did not believe that the student had planned the shooting with anyone else and that they were still investigating.\", \"Mass shootings at schools have been a recurring tragedy in the United States. In 2018, a gunman killed 17 people and injured 17 others at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. That same year, a gunman killed 10 people at Santa Fe High School in Texas.\", \"\\u201cThis is a uniquely American problem that we need to address,\\u201d Ms. Whitmer said on Tuesday.\"]","href_hash":"9694717652a711ec9dc5ffde9d9185af"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9694717652a711ec9dc5ffde9d9185af"}},
