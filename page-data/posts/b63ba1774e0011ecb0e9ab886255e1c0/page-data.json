The writer and director explain the difficulties.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-25T15:03:07.000Z","content":"[\"Haruki Murakami\\u2019s well-loved books have been the basis for several big-screen adaptations over the years, with variable results. But the latest has attracted nearly unanimous acclaim: \\u201cDrive My Car,\\u201d from a short story by the writer. It\\u2019s the rare successful adaptation that stands firmly on its own as a sophisticated film, and it puts a fresh spotlight on its director, Ryusuke Hamaguchi, as a major talent.\", \"The source for \\u201cDrive My Car\\u201d runs no more than 40 pages. It\\u2019s about a theater actor named Yusuke Kafuku, who gets a personal driver and makes an unexpected friend, an actor who was one of his late wife\\u2019s lovers. Out of the Harukami tale\\u2019s ambling reflections on regret and performance, Hamaguchi spins something grander yet no less intimate: a multilayered, unpredictable three-hour drama that tends to leave viewers reinvigorated.\", \"The 42-year-old director has been making films since the 2000s, but he\\u2019s the first to say how unlikely this one might seem.\", \"\\u201cFundamentally, I don\\u2019t think that Murakami\\u2019s works are made for adaptation,\\u201d the director said with a thoughtful air at the offices of Janus Films, one of the distributors of \\u201cDrive My Car.\\u201d He was speaking in September ahead of its New York Film Festival premiere. \\u201cMurakami\\u2019s writing is wonderful at expressing inner emotions, and I think that\\u2019s why people want to adapt them. But it\\u2019s really difficult to re-create those inner feelings in film.\\u201d\", \"Once upon a time, Murakami didn\\u2019t even allow adaptations: \\u201cIt\\u2019s enough for a book to be a book,\\u201d he told The New York Times in 1990. But along with \\u201cDrive My Car,\\u201d notable examples include \\u201cBurning,\\u201d an acclaimed adaptation by the Korean auteur Lee Chang-dong that co-starred Steven Yeun, as well as \\u201cTony Takitani\\u201d and \\u201cNorwegian Wood.\\u201d Carlos Cuar\\u00f3n, the co-screenwriter of \\u201cY Tu Mam\\u00e1 Tambi\\u00e9n,\\u201d even made a short film of \\u201cThe Second Bakery Attack,\\u201d starring Kirsten Dunst.\", \"Murakami was surprised when he heard that Hamaguchi\\u2019s adaptation (which had his permission) was three hours long. So he bought a ticket to see \\u201cDrive My Car\\u201d at a local theater.\", \"\\u201cI was drawn in from beginning to end,\\u201d the writer said in an email. \\u201cI think that this alone is a wonderful feat.\\u201d\", \"Hamaguchi\\u2019s simmering interpretation \\u2014 Japan\\u2019s candidate for the Academy Award for best international feature \\u2014 seems to crack the code in adapting Murakami. For starters, the director chose a relatively straightforward story. \\u201cDrive My Car\\u201d lacks the surreal touches that readers might know from the novelist\\u2019s \\u201cA Wild Sheep Chase\\u201d and \\u201cThe Wind-Up Bird Chronicle,\\u201d for example.\", \"\\u201cHe is able to go back and forth between things that are realistic and things that are not real in a book,\\u201d Hamaguchi said of the author\\u2019s other work. \\u201cBut when you put that in the film, it\\u2019s easy for that to become a little silly and hard to make the audience believe in it. \\u2018Drive My Car\\u2019 was one story where it remained in the realistic realm.\\u201d\", \"Murakami\\u2019s original followed Yusuke\\u2019s conversations with his driver, Misaki (played onscreen by Toko Miura), a reserved younger woman who gradually warms up. Misaki doesn\\u2019t mind when Yusuke runs lines with the help of the car\\u2019s cassette player. He tells her how he ghosted his new actor friend out of vengeance over his wife\\u2019s infidelity. His wife in turn remains just a memory in the story.\", \"Hamaguchi\\u2019s version shuffles and expands the story\\u2019s timeline. Yusuke\\u2019s wife, Oto (Reika Kirishima), is still alive, and we begin by observing her and Yusuke (Hidetoshi Nishijima). She\\u2019s a popular writer for television, and the couple have a ritual: She tells him stories when they have sex, and later they elaborate on the plots together.\", \"It\\u2019s a beguiling conceit and actually comes from another Hamaguchi story, \\u201cScheherazade\\u201d (which, like \\u201cDrive My Car,\\u201d is part of the collection \\u201cMen Without Women\\u201d). Hamaguchi\\u2019s opening scene is a becalmed moment between Yusuke and Oto at home, with Oto at first mysterious in a twilit silhouette.\", \"The scene is a romantic contrast to Murakami\\u2019s opening: Yusuke monologuing about different kinds of female drivers. Hamaguchi attributes the idea to his co-writer, Takamasa Oe.\", \"\\u201cI wanted to emphasize Oto\\u2019s centrality to the narrative,\\u201d Oe wrote in an email. \\u201cHer voice and her ghostly presence were always going to be the key to the story.\\u201d\", \"The film does stay faithful to Oto\\u2019s death, but Hamaguchi then builds out a mention of \\u201cUncle Vanya\\u201d in the original into a central story line. Yusuke is invited to direct the play for a theater festival in Hiroshima. His international cast includes a young hotshot (and hothead) named Koshi (Masaki Okada), who had an affair with Yusuke\\u2019s wife (like the actor in the short story).\", \"The actors in Yusuke\\u2019s play speak their lines in different languages \\u2014 an idea that partly came from Hamaguchi\\u2019s experiences taking an English-language class in the United States with other foreign visitors. In the film, Hamaguchi takes particular interest in the rehearsals\\u2019 shifting energies.\", \"\\u201cI think in the rehearsal, there are more mistakes. You can feel more vividly what is happening. And this is actually the creative process,\\u201d Hamaguchi said. \\u201cI think maybe this is more interesting than the perfected or final version.\\u201d\", \"Hamaguchi gives Yusuke one of his own habits as a filmmaker: very thorough table readings of the screenplay before shooting. Yusuke\\u2019s intensive preparations add another dimension to Hamaguchi\\u2019s interplay of emotions. In \\u201cUncle Vanya,\\u201d Sonya\\u2019s line \\u201cWhat can we do? We must live out our lives\\u201d takes on a deep resonance as Yusuke strikes up the bond with Misaki that becomes the film\\u2019s emotional anchor.\", \"Mounting a Chekhov production might seem a significant departure from Harukami\\u2019s self-contained story, but it\\u2019s all fair game to the author.\", \"\\u201cWhen my work is adapted, my wish is for the plot and dialogue to be changed freely,\\u201d Murakami wrote in the email. \\u201cThere is a big difference between the way a piece of literature develops and how a film develops.\\u201d\", \"For that reason, the writer also favors \\u201cBurning,\\u201d which liberally departs from his 1983 short story \\u201cBarn Burning\\u201d and relocates the action.\", \"\\u201cBy changing the setting from Japan to South Korea, it felt like a new mysterious reality was born. I want to highly commend these kinds of \\u2018gaps\\u2019 or differences,\\u201d Murakami added. (With one possible exception in \\u201cDrive My Car\\u201d: \\u201cI had been imagining an old Saab convertible so when I saw the Saab with a roof appear in the movie, I felt a little bothered at first. But I got used to it very quickly.\\u201d)\", \"In a way, Hamaguchi\\u2019s stage conceit stays faithful to the sense of nested realities in Murakami\\u2019s work. It brings to mind Cuar\\u00f3n\\u2019s characterization of the story he adapted, \\u201cThe Second Bakery Attack.\\u201d In an email, Cuar\\u00f3n said it shared with other Murakami work the sense of \\u201ca parallel universe, which belongs to fantasy or to the main character\\u2019s inner experience and is almost impossible to adapt.\\u201d\", \"Adapting Murakami can sound only more daunting when the author describes his writing as a kind of private moviemaking: \\u201cDo I imagine the scenes play out in my head while I write? Of course. In fact, for me, that is one of the joys of writing fiction \\u2014 I\\u2019m making my own film made just for myself,\\u201d he wrote in the email.\", \"But Hamaguchi knows enough to avoid idealizing his source. He\\u2019s more faithful to how \\u201cDrive My Car\\u201d made him feel when he read it.\", \"\\u201cI had to think about how I had received the short story,\\u201d he said. \\u201cMy emotional experience was something I wanted to convey to the viewers of the film as much as possible. That was behind my thinking of the construction of the movie.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cDrive My Car\\u201d joins an already impressive filmography for Hamaguchi, who studied under a master of mood, the director Kiyoshi Kurosawa. The five-hour \\u201cHappy Hour\\u201d (2016), the first Hamaguchi film to make waves at festivals, chronicled the lives of four women. In the romantic melodrama \\u201cAsako I and II\\u201d (2019), a woman falls for the doppelg\\u00e4nger of an old flame. Hamaguchi also directed \\u201cWheel of Fortune and Fantasy\\u201d and wrote the screenplay for Kurosawa\\u2019s \\u201cWife of a Spy,\\u201d both released here this year.\", \"Hamaguchi seems set to expand that oeuvre, by keeping a close eye on those inner feelings.\", \"\\u201cWhat I really do think about is the mystery that\\u2019s inside any human being,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo if a character is able to give that sense of mystery, that\\u2019s when the character no longer feels unreal. They start to really exist. If the character can make you feel that mystery somehow, that to me is the core of working with fiction.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b63ba1774e0011ecb0e9ab886255e1c0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b63ba1774e0011ecb0e9ab886255e1c0"}},
