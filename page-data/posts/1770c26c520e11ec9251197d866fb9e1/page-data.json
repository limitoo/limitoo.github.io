Blinken said the group, known as FARC, had \\u201cformally dissolved and disarmed\\u201d and \\u201cno longer exists as a unified organization that engages in terrorism or terrorist activity or has the capability or intent to do so.\\u201d\", \"The move, which drew criticism from several prominent Republicans, is a sign of the Biden administration\\u2019s support for a fragile peace deal that the Colombian government signed with the FARC in November 2016. The agreement officially ended a five-decade conflict in which the U.S. military backed the government against a left-wing fueled insurgency that was funded by the drug trade. The fighting left more than 220,000 people dead.\", \"Colombia had urged Washington for years to remove the FARC from its official list of terrorist groups, and Mr. Blinken said in his statement that the shift would allow the United States to \\u201cbetter support implementation of the 2016 accord, including by working with demobilized combatants.\\u201d Many of the FARC\\u2019s former top military commanders are now prominent politicians.\", \"Under the deal, more than 13,000 FARC rebels agreed to lay down their arms in return for more government investment in neglected rural areas. But implementation of the accord has been shaky. Government aid has been slow to materialize in remote areas, and pockets of armed rebels carry on their fight.\", \"After a helicopter carrying Colombia\\u2019s president, Iv\\u00e1n Duque, was attacked in July, the government arrested 10 former FARC rebels and charged them with attempted assassination and a car bombing at a military base.\", \"Mr. Blinken said two rebel groups formed by former FARC commanders who refused to demobilize were designated terrorist organizations. Segunda Marquetalia and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia \\u2014 People\\u2019s Army, or FARC-EP, are responsible for armed attacks, assassinations and hostage-takings, he said.\", \"The United States also designated several leaders of the two groups as terrorists.\", \"Some Republicans have criticized the Biden administration\\u2019s decision to remove the FARC\\u2019s terrorist group designation. After the planned action was first reported last week by The Wall Street Journal, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Representative Mike McCaul of Texas, called the move \\u201can exercise in appeasement.\\u201d\", \"FARC members \\u201chave not exercised remorse or acts of contrition for their ongoing narco-terrorism against innocent Colombians & Americans,\\u201d Mr. McCaul wrote on Twitter.\", \"\\u201cPresident Biden\\u2019s decision to remove the FARC from the State Department\\u2019s list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations will embolden terrorist groups throughout Latin America, empower narco-traffickers and pave the way for Castro-chavismo in Colombia,\\u201d Florida\\u2019s Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, said in a statement.\"]","href_hash":"1770c26c520e11ec9251197d866fb9e1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1770c26c520e11ec9251197d866fb9e1"}},
