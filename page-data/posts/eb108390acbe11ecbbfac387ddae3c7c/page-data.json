Their assault met with stiff resistance from Ukrainian forces and has been halted outside Kyiv.\", \"The Russians have instead been bombarding and encircling cities, laying waste to residential areas and have driven about a quarter of Ukraine's 44 million people from their homes. More than 3.7m of them have fled abroad, half to neighbouring Poland.\", \"US President Joe Biden travelled to Poland on Friday, meeting soldiers from the US Army's 82nd Airborne Division bolstering NATO's eastern flank and getting a look at efforts to help refugees.\", \"\\\"I'm here in Poland to see first hand the humanitarian crisis,\\\" Biden said.\", \"Battlelines near Kyiv have been frozen for weeks with two main Russian armoured columns stuck northwest and east of the capital. A British intelligence report described a Ukrainian counter-offensive that had pushed Russians back in the east.\", \"\\\"Ukrainian counter-attacks, and Russian forces falling back on overextended supply lines, have allowed Ukraine to reoccupy towns and defensive positions up to 35km east of Kyiv,\\\" the report said.

Ukraine and its Western allies have dismissed this as a baseless pretext for an unprovoked war launched on 24 February.\", \"Russia's defence ministry said 1351 Russian soldiers had been killed and 3825 wounded, the Interfax news agency reported. Ukraine says 15,000 Russian soldiers have died.\", \"Volodymyr Borysenko, mayor of Boryspol, an eastern suburb where Kyiv's main airport is located, said 20,000 civilians had evacuated the area, answering a call to clear out so Ukrainian troops could counter-attack. Ukrainian forces recaptured a nearby village the previous day and would have pushed on but halted to avoid putting civilians in danger, he said.\", \"On the other main front outside Kyiv, to the capital's northwest, Ukrainian forces have been trying to encircle Russian troops in the suburbs of Irpin, Bucha and Hostomel, reduced to ruins by heavy fighting.\", \"In Bucha, 25km northwest of Kyiv, a small group of Ukrainian troops armed with anti-tank missiles was digging foxholes.

Tens of thousands of people are still believed to be trapped with little access to food, power or heat, while the city around them has been reduced to ruins.\", \"Local officials, citing witness accounts, said they estimated that 300 people were killed in the bombing of a theatre in Mariupol on 16 March. The city council had not previously provided a toll and made clear it was not possible to determine an exact figure after the incident. Russia has denied bombing the theatre.\", \"The governor of Ukraine's Donetsk region, Pavlo Kyrylenko, said Ukrainian forces still controlled Mariupol. Around 65,000 people had fled but efforts to organise mass evacuations under ceasefires had mostly failed.\", \"The cities of Chernihiv, Kharkiv and Sumy in the east have also endured devastating bombardment. Chernihiv was effectively surrounded by Russian forces, its governor said.\", \"Western sanctions have isolated Russia from global trade. Moscow warned that billing in roubles for natural gas exports to heavily dependent Europe could be just days away, leaving buyers wondering how they could get their hands on the currency.\", \"Speaking at a meeting with leading cultural figures broadcast on national television, President Vladimir Putin accused the West of trying to cancel Russian culture, including composers Pyotr Tchaikovsky and Sergei Rachmaninov, comparing it to actions by Nazi Germany in the 1930s.\", \"China is the biggest power not to have condemned the Russian invasion and has repeatedly voiced opposition to the sanctions.\", \"The Reuters report that Sinopec had suspended discussions about investments potentially worth $500 million was the first concrete sign that sanctions are affecting trade between Moscow and Beijing.\", \"Beijing has insisted it will maintain trade links. But it is pressing Chinese companies to tread carefully.\", \"\\\"Companies will rigidly follow Beijing's foreign policy in this crisis,\\\" said an executive at a Chinese state oil company. \\\"There's no room whatsoever for companies to take any initiatives in terms of new investment.\\\"\", \"- Reuters\"]","href_hash":"eb108390acbe11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eb108390acbe11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
