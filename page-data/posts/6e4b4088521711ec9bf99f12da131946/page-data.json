The former president has sued to keep the records secret, but on Tuesday a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit appeared skeptical of that argument.\", \"If the January 6 committee votes to advance a criminal contempt referral against Clark, it is likely that the Democratic-controlled chamber will pass it. The measure would then be left in the hands of the Justice Department.\"]","href_hash":"6e4b4088521711ec9bf99f12da131946"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6e4b4088521711ec9bf99f12da131946"}},
