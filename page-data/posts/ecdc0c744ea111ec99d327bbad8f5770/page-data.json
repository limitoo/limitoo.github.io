(\\u201cDeers have nothing to do with Hanukkah,\\u201d Ms. Herman added. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a Christmas thing!\\u201d)\", \"The experience of finding Hanukkah imagery transposed onto Christmas tropes seemed to resonate. Ms. Herman, who had a couple dozen TikTok followers before her viral post and is now over 1,000, racked up more than 300,000 views on her video.\", \"The National Retail Federation estimates people will spend up to $859 billion in November and December, nearly 11 percent more than the same period last year. Not everyone wants to spend on mistletoe and Santa pillows, though. So national retail chains have attempted to broaden their inventory for those who observe holidays other than Christmas, whether Hanukkah, Kwanzaa or Lunar New Year \\u2014 but their offerings sometimes displayed confusion about the spirit of those celebrations.\", \"Last month, an Instagram account called Hanukkah Fails started posting screenshots of holiday merchandise seemingly designed by someone with a nontraditional understanding of Jewish holiday traditions. There was a \\u201cMatzo Matzo Man\\u201d T-shirt from the company Tipsy Elves (matzo is eaten on Passover); a \\u201cChallah at ya girl\\u201d sweater on TeePublic\\u2019s site (challah is made on Shabbat); a Hanukkah tea towel from Disney embroidered with Sabbath candles.\", \"One Hanukkah pillow inscribed with, \\u201cWhy is this night different from all other nights?,\\u201d a question recited at the Passover Seder, was taken down from the Michaels and Bed Bath & Beyond websites.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m happy to serve as any national brand\\u2019s Hanukkah ambassador,\\u201d said Yael Buechler, 36, a rabbi at the Leffell School, a Jewish day school in Westchester County. \\u201cBecause they could definitely use a rabbi.\\u201d\", \"Bed Bath & Beyond conceded that its collection of items targeted to different cultural groups sometimes missed the mark. \\u201cIn our effort to provide a wide selection of Hanukkah items, some were included that shouldn\\u2019t have been,\\u201d the company said in an email. \\u201cAs soon as our team was alerted, the items were removed.\\u201d\", \"Michaels, which had also initially stocked the Hanukkah-turned-Passover pillow online, said it was open to hearing customer responses to its holiday inventory.\", \"\\u201cWhile the overall feedback to our expanded, inclusive product lines has been positive, we don\\u2019t always get it right,\\u201d a spokesperson for the company said in an email. \", \"This year, Michaels changed its protocols for approving holiday merchandise, ensuring that its employee resource groups, which have representatives from different cultures, have more input into products sold online, a process that they\\u2019ve found helpful when stocking up for Pride celebrations. Lowe\\u2019s and TJX, which owns the T.J. Maxx and Marshall\\u2019s brands, both said that their holiday wares were reviewed internally to confirm that cultural iconography was used appropriately.\", \"But some shoppers are fed up: \\u201cThere\\u2019s a Santa on Wayfair wearing a tallit,\\u201d Ms. Herman said, referring to a Jewish prayer shawl. \\u201cTallits are kind of a big deal, it means you went through a bar mitzvah. Is St. Nicholas now a Jew, like, welcome to Jewish adulthood? \\u201d\", \"More than 150 years ago, American Jews faced the opposite problem. Families settling in U.S. cities found that December was filled with cheer for Christian families \\u2014 caroling, decorations, presents \\u2014 while Jewish children were left without much levity to distract from the winter gloom. One Cincinnati rabbi happened across a neighborhood Christmas celebration and realized that Hanukkah, a holiday without much religious significance, could benefit from festive traditions: songs, Maccabee costumes, gifts (the children got oranges, a rarity in the midst of a Midwestern winter).\", \"\\u201cHanukkah became a way for Jews to reaffirm their commitment to Judaism in the face of pressure to be Christian,\\u201d said Dianne Ashton, a historian and author of \\u201cHanukkah in America.\\u201d \\u201cFamilies are concerned about keeping their children happy to be Jewish at this time of the year.\\u201d\", \"Retailers were eager to meet those concerns with the tried-and-true American antidote to unhappy kids: more stuff. Musical menorahs entered the market starting in the 1950s, soon followed by Hanukkah sticker books and gelt-filled dreidels. Hallmark launched a line of cards for Jewish customers, called Tree of Life, in 1995. Today more than one million Hanukkah cards are exchanged in the United States annually, according to the company.\", \"The ecommerce boom of the early 2000s gave rise to a flood of new products including dreidel-shaped waffle makers, latke-adorned snuggies, star of David-speckled pajamas and Grateful Dead Hanukkah bobble heads. Consumer enthusiasm picked up even more in 2013 when Hanukkah coincided with Thanksgiving, a rare holiday mash-up that can make it easier to gather families for gift exchanges, according to Rabbi Buechler. (This year, Hanukkah begins three days after Thanksgiving.)\", \"But as the Hanukkah inventory has swelled over the decades, it has also been met with critiques. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an afterthought,\\u201d said Adam Cohen, 52, a television producer in Los Angeles. \\u201cA lot of times they\\u2019re copying what Christmas does. You had \\u2018Elf on a Shelf,\\u2019 so someone made \\u2018Mensch on a Bench.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Mr. Cohen took the opportunity to make his own, more culturally informed products. In 2009, he started selling an annual Nice Jewish Guys wall calendar. \\u201cThere were these predictable calendars that showed menorahs or gefilte fish,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere was nothing really celebrating the culture, not just the history but the present-day culture. Where\\u2019s the calendar with the nice Jewish guy?\\u201d\", \"Mr. Cohen went on to sell more than 10,000 calendars each year, including to major retailers like Urban Outfitters: \\u201cI was just making a calendar of what I know, and what there\\u2019s an absence of recognition for,\\u201d he added.\", \"Like Mr. Cohen, other Jewish entrepreneurs found that the confusion of mainstream retailers presented an opening for their own holiday merchandise.\", \"Take Rabbi Buechler, who in 2011 started Midrash Manicures, which makes nail decals customized for Jewish holidays \\u2014 plagues for Passover, tiny shofars for Rosh Hashana, scales of justice for Yom Kippur. As she expanded her business, she focused on Hanukkah, making neon dreidel leggings and a cold-shoulder dreidel top that she wore to get her coronavirus booster shot.\", \"\\u201cOne of the themes of Hanukkah is \\u2018Pirsum HaNes,\\u2019 which means \\u2018publicizing the miracle,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Buechler explained. \\u201cAny form of Hanukkah swag is a way of extending that theme.\\u201d\", \"While Ms. Buechler\\u2019s business has grown, selling more than 1,000 sets of $14 nail decals this year, she has faced stiffening competition from national chains, which, she observed, seem to expand their Hanukkah collection each year. Still, the botched products from companies like Michaels and Bed Bath & Beyond remind Ms. Buechler that there\\u2019s a market for rabbi-approved merchandise like her own.\", \"When the big brands misstep, she added, rabbis groan about it on social media. \\u201cIt\\u2019s \\u2018here we go again, another national chain that hasn\\u2019t quite gotten Hanukkah right,\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cJust give us a call, and we\\u2019re willing to help.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ecdc0c744ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ecdc0c744ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}},
