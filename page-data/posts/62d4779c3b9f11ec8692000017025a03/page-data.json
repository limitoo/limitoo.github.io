water?","country":"au","create_time":"2021-11-02T05:40:45.000Z","content":"[\"The fallout from Prime Minister Scott Morrison's decision to scrap a\\u00a0French submarine deal in favour of a nuclear option from the US or UK has continued into this week's meeting of world leaders in Glasgow.\", \"French president Emmanuel Macron says Mr Morrison lied to him about his intentions with the\\u00a0deal, and that his trust in Australia has been deeply damaged.\", \"And US President Joe Biden is doing his best to distance himself from what he called Mr Morrison's\\u00a0\\\"clumsy\\\" move, as the federal opposition says it's time for the Prime Minister to apologise.\", \"Mr Morrison has acknowledged the decision caused anger, but he says it was necessary and that he did not mislead the French.\", \"So what got us to this point?\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What was the deal with the French?</div>\", \"When and how to upgrade Australia's ageing\\u00a0Collins Class submarines was first floated back in 2009, with the then-Labor government in 2013 announcing whatever would come next would be built in South Australia.\", \"Fast-forward a couple of years and, after a lot of discussions and debate, bids from Japan, Germany and France were put forward to build the next fleet \\u2014\\u00a0with the French awarded the deal.\", \"The $50 billion agreement for French company DCNS \\u2014\\u00a0now called Naval Group \\u2014\\u00a0to build 12 new subs in Adelaide was announced in 2016 under then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull.\\u00a0\", \"<img

French to supply Australia's submarine fleet.(AAP: Mick Tsikas)</div>\", \"Under the plan, the French subs would have been delivered in 2030 and operational between then and 2034.\", \"Australia's new nuclear submarines are unlikely to be in the water before 2040.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">It hasn't been smooth sailing</div>\", \"Although Mr Macron\\u00a0asserts\\u00a0he was caught off guard by the announcement, it was well known the submarine contract was in turbulent waters.\", \"The $50 billion deal announced by Mr Turnbull was now being estimated by Defence to likely cost an extra $40 billion\\u00a0\\u2014 and that was before even a single part had begun to be made.\", \"As early as 2019, the government was publicly discussing its frustration with Naval Group, and\\u00a0quietly discussing exercising an option\\u00a0in the contract to terminate the deal and make a break payment to Naval Group.\", \"Mr Morrison publicly warned the French government in June this year the government was deeply unhappy with the lack of progress on the submarine fleet.\", \"The Prime Minister said he'd had \\\"candid talks\\\" with both Mr Macron and Naval Group, and told the company it must meet a September deadline to submit re-worked designs for the submarine fleet, as its existing plans were too expensive.\", \"Days earlier, Defence officials said they were already looking at alternatives, although they insisted the government was committed to the French design.\", \"At the same time, Mr Macron was signalling\\u00a0to Australia\\u00a0how important it was to him to\\u00a0keep\\u00a0the contract, saying it was the pillar of the partnership between France and Australia, and \\\"the relationship of confidence\\\" between the two countries.\", \"So it was clear\\u00a0the diplomatic damage from dumping the french submarines would be immense.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Did France know the submarine deal was dead in the water?</div>\", \"In the end, it was an awkwardly-named acronym that sank the submarine deal.\", \"At an early-morning joint press conference in mid-September, US President Joe Biden, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Mr Morrison revealed the new 'AUKUS' security partnership.\\u00a0\", \"The linchpin of the new agreement was the dumping of the French submarine deal, in favour of Australia acquiring nuclear submarines from either the UK or the US.\", \"Mr Macron claimed he was\\u00a0blind-sided by the announcement, and responded with fury.\", \"He recalled France's\\u00a0ambassadors to the US and Australia, an extraordinary diplomatic rebuke of the country's close allies \\u2014 France had never previously recalled its ambassador to the United States.\", \"France's Foreign Minister labelled the cancellation of the contract a \\\"stab in the back\\\", and said trust between France and Australia was broken.\", \"But what exactly France knew, and when the country was told, about the cancellation of the submarine project is now somewhat disputed.\", \"On Mr\\u00a0Morrison's telling, Australia had been expressing its discontent with the French contract for some time and the scrapping of the contract should not have been a surprise.\", \"He said\\u00a0the French response to Australian concerns at the time indicated they clearly understood the depth of the problems the contract faced.\", \"However, crucially, Mr Morrison said he could not reveal to Mr Macron or any other French official that Australia was in talks with the US and UK due to security concerns.\", \"Some \\u2014 such as\\u00a0former Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull \\u2014\\u00a0argue that relying on the French to pick up \\\"hints\\\" that the contract might be dumped is not good enough, and Mr Morrison should have been more direct.\", \"Mr Turnbull also suggests that, if Australia really wanted nuclear submarines, the French could have been involved, given the French submarines Australia was buying were retrofitted from a nuclear model.\", \"President Macron's comments yesterday suggest he would agree.\", \"Asked if he felt Mr Morrison had lied to him, Mr Macron did not mince his words.\", \"\\\"I don't think, I know,\\\" he said.\"]","href_hash":"62d4779c3b9f11ec8692000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"62d4779c3b9f11ec8692000017025a03"}},
