It’s just really hard to.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-02-13T19:11:11.000Z","content":"[\"Six hundred dollars for coffee with Kate Sacker; $46,863 for Wendy Rhoades\\u2019s wardrobe; $162,500 for a night at a Covid-free bordello with Wags; $300 million for Mike Prince\\u2019s new yacht, plus an extra $300 million to neutralize its carbon footprint. We\\u2019ve said before in this space that the credo of the pro wrestler Ted DiBiase (a.k.a. the Million Dollar Man), \\u201cEverybody\\u2019s got a price,\\u201d holds sway in the world of \\u201cBillions.\\u201d Never before has the show made it quite this literal.\", \"In one of the boldest stylistic choices ever made by the show \\u2014 you could argue the boldest, and I wouldn\\u2019t object \\u2014 this week\\u2019s episode of \\u201cBillions\\u201d repeatedly freezes the action and superimposes graphics that show you the cost of all the name brands, grand plans and illegal indulgences enjoyed by Michael Prince and his employees. Did you know that a private hog roast with the restaurateur Rodney Scott costs $25,000? That a batch of quaaludes and a courier to deliver them runs you $8,400? That multiple characters\\u2019 personal wardrobes and grooming routines on a given day cost more than this country\\u2019s yearly per capita income? You sure do now!\", \"It doesn\\u2019t stop there. By the episode\\u2019s end, as Prince gazes at his work force from the balcony, running totals of all the money they\\u2019re generating float above their heads, like stats for characters in a video game. Then, in a breach of the fourth wall, all of the main Prince Cap players pause for a group portrait, gazing right into the camera as lists of luxuries and those luxuries\\u2019 price tags float behind them. It\\u2019s enough to make you want to take up arms with Chuck Rhoades the next time he whips out a bullhorn or a pitchfork.\", \"It\\u2019s a dazzling device, courtesy of the episode\\u2019s director, Chloe Domont, and the writers Lio Sigerson, Brian Koppelman and David Levien. (Koppelman and Levien created the show with the New York Times columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin.) It makes the show\\u2019s subtext literally its text.\", \"And given the behavior the show\\u2019s protagonists in this episode, it couldn\\u2019t be more pointed. Take Chuck Rhoades. He\\u2019s still out to scupper Prince\\u2019s drive to make New York City the home of the 2028 Olympic Games, by any means necessary. This week, that meant almost immediately abandoning the man-of-the-people schtick he had adopted and warning the city\\u2019s big telecommunications companies that Prince plans to provide the city with free Wi-Fi in perpetuity as part of his Olympic bid \\u2014 wi-fi surreptitiously siphoned from those companies\\u2019 unused signals. Big Telecom puts the kibosh on this plan toot sweet.\", \"You might think Prince would get his back up about this, but no, not really. Rather than jeopardize his Olympic bid with a big battle, he gets in bed with the telecom firms, settling on two weeks\\u2019 worth of free Wi-Fi for the city, during the Games only.\", \"This infuriates Taylor Mason, who pushed Prince toward the Wi-Fi plan from the start. In addition, connecting the Big Apple was supposed to be just part one of the plan, which would have also seen the firm set up free wi-fi across sub-Saharan Africa. Taylor compares the meager offering Prince comes up with to a free tote bag; \\u201cPeople love free tote bags!\\u201d he replies.\", \"But his overall message to Taylor is far more direct. \\u201cI\\u2019m independently wealthy,\\u201d he says. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not; you\\u2019re kind of rich. Which is great, but if you want to change the world, nine digits ain\\u2019t going to do it.\\u201d With that, he sparks a new ambition inside the brain of Mase Carb\\u2019s brilliant founder. No longer will Taylor settle for the $100 million fortune once seen as the threshold for effecting positive change in the world. Now, it has to be a billion. (Minimum, we\\u2019re guessing. Billions are like Pringles: Once you pop, you can\\u2019t stop.)\", \"As for Chuck, things go poorly indeed. He is gently rebuffed when he seeks an alliance with New York\\u2019s governor, Bob Sweeney (Matt Servitto). \\u201cI know I\\u2019ve got to take a flume ride with one of you two lunatics on this,\\u201d Sweeney says amusingly, but for now he\\u2019s simply relishing his newfound power over two of the state\\u2019s biggest players.\", \"Meanwhile, Prince begins courting Chuck\\u2019s right-hand woman, Kate Sacker, asking her to quit her job and become the New York Games\\u2019 lead counsel, after which he\\u2019ll line up support for her congressional run. When she dutifully informs Chuck of this overture, he tells her to wait before declining and puts his best friend, Ira (Ben Shenkman), into play, asking him to pitch himself to Prince for the position instead.\", \"For a minute, it looks as if Prince were considering the idea \\u2014 who better to neutralize Chuck than his own best friend, right? Wags and Scooter, Prince\\u2019s chief minions, are aghast that the bossman is even giving the idea the time of day.\", \"But he isn\\u2019t. It\\u2019s all a ploy to get Chuck to take his eyes off the real target, Kate. Tired of being told to wait for her moment in the sun by her mentor, she decides she is no longer in the father-figure business and joins Prince Cap, not as Prince\\u2019s prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9 but as his peer, with all the perks that entails. Chuck is bitterly disappointed, but having continuously put Kate\\u2019s political aspirations on the back burner in favor of his own, he has no one to blame but himself. (Well, himself and Prince\\u2019s bottomless purse.)\", \"There\\u2019s a tremendous sense of loss as Kate rides away in her expensive chauffeured vehicle. She has always been ambitious, but she also seemed incorruptible, at least insofar as she had a clear picture in her mind of how to achieve her goals, and this picture never involved defecting to the other side. It\\u2019s a bummer to see her give in.\", \"But it\\u2019s also thrilling. What will a steel-trap mind like Kate\\u2019s be capable of doing with limitless funds at its disposal? She instantly makes Prince Cap a more formidable force than it already was. So when we see her in that group portrait, her fortune increasing by the second, it\\u2019s both sad and exciting to say that she fits right in.\"]","href_hash":"94b7485c8d4311ecbaaa2f9b58284cc2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"94b7485c8d4311ecbaaa2f9b58284cc2"}},
