Shkaplerov was launched to the lab October 5, but Dubrov and Vande Hei have been on board since April and are working through a nearly year-long stay in space.\", \"NASA and SpaceX originally planned to launch the Crew-3 astronauts on October 31, but the flight was delayed, first by stormy off-shore weather and then by a minor medical issue with one of the crew members.\", \"Launch was tentatively reset for this past Saturday, but was called off and pushed back to Monday at the earliest because of more bad weather, locally and along the crew's path to orbit where they might have to attempt an emergency landing in an abort.\", \"NASA would prefer to bring station astronauts home after they've had a chance to brief their replacements on lab operations. But in this case, given the Crew-2 capsule is nearing its 210-day certification limit, NASA decided to bring Kimbrough and company back to Earth first.\", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News. He covered 129 space shuttle missions, every interplanetary flight since Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune and scores of commercial and military launches.
