A tornado watch was in effect through 8 p.m. Central time in parts of Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota, the National Weather Service said.\", \"It was on track to sweep into the upper Great Lakes on Wednesday, bringing high winds that could exceed 70 miles per hour in some locations. In Nebraska, Kansas and Colorado, wind gusts of 75 m.p.h. could spike even higher, possibly to 90 miles per hour.\", \"Strong winds and dense fog were forecast to hamper travel in Minnesota and northeast South Dakota through Thursday, while an onslaught of cold air could turn rain into snow, the Weather Service said.\", \"The same dense fog and wind conditions were moving through Taylor County in north-central Wisconsin, the Weather Service said.\", \"The impact was already being felt in some places on Wednesday afternoon. Denver International Airport said high winds could very likely cause flight delays. In Colorado Springs, some schools closed early on Wednesday or announced that they would shift to remote learning there, according to local news reports.\", \"Schools also closed early in Iowa, where record temperatures reached the lower 70s and wind gusts of up to 75 m.p.h. were reported.\", \"\\u201cThe storm system is unprecedented,\\u201d said Andrew Ansorge, a meteorologist with the Weather Service in Des Moines. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have anything to compare it to.\\u201d\", \"The storm system, he added, \\u201cis bringing a lot of warm and moist air.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOff the charts is the best way to say it,\\u201d he said, adding that a secondary \\u201cpunch of winds\\u201d of 75 m.p.h. or higher was expected in the evening.\", \"A.J.
