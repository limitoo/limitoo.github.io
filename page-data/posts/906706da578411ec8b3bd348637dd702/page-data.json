If it passes, it would give about 800,000 more people the right to vote in city elections, though they would still not be able to vote in state or federal elections. If passed, the measure would begin to apply in the 2023 elections.\", \"Mayor Bill de Blasio worried that the bill could face legal challenges. He and other New York lawmakers have expressed concern that the new measure could decrease motivation for some permanent residents to become citizens.\", \"\\\"Citizenship has an extraordinary value,\\\" he said on Inside City Hall, a news program. \\\"People work so hard for it. We need people in every good way to want to be citizens.\\\"\", \"However, de Blasio also said that he would not veto it once it came to his desk, leaving little opposition to the bill.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946920/new-york-city-local-elections.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">New York's City Council is expected to approve a bill that would allow 800,000 noncitizens to vote in city elections.

Noncitizens wouldn't be allowed to vote until elections in 2023.\", \"Giving nonresidents the right to vote could empower them to become a political force that can't be easily ignored, said Anu Joshi, the vice president of policy of the New York Immigration Coalition.\", \"New York City, with more than 3 million foreign-born residents, would be a fitting place to anchor a national movement to expand immigrant voting rights, said Ron Hayduk, now a professor of political science at San Francisco State University but who spent years in New York steeped in the movement for noncitizen voting rights.\", \"\\\"New York, the home of the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, prides itself on being the place of immigration,\\\" he noted. \\\"So there's this question of what's the place of immigrants in our city\\u2014are they really New Yorkers, are they full New Yorkers in the sense of qualifying and deserving the power of the vote and to shape its political future?\\\"\", \"The answer should be a \\\"resounding yes,\\\" he said.\", \"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946939/new-york-city-election-day.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">New York City is set to approve a bill that would allow legal permanent residents of longer than 30 days to vote in city elections.
