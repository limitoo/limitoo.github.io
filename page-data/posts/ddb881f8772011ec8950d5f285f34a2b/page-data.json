This means the process can be standardised and scaled up, making vaccine development faster than traditional methods of making vaccines.\", \"\\\"This technology could be quickly adapted to create an effective vaccine against Covid-19. The Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine has met international standards for quality, safety, and efficacy. The vaccine is safe.\\\"\", \"There is no evidence the vaccine makes people magnetic.\", \"RNZ\"]","href_hash":"ddb881f8772011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ddb881f8772011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
