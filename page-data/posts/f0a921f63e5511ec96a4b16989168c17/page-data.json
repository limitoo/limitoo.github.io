Among the proposals given in the memo include defunding academic programs involving racial education and emphasizing gifted and advanced programs.\", \"House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has also announced support for a Parent's Bill of Rights that has been said to target critical race theory. The term has been used to describe academia aiming to teach students about race throughout American history.\", \"Former Republican Governors Association Executive Director Phil Cox said that \\\"parents are angry at what they view as inappropriate social engineering in schools and an unresponsive bureaucracy.\\\"\", \"The Biden administration is expressing concern over the increase in mobilization. White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre countered Republican interpretations of critical race theory as targeting and shaming white students.\", \"\\\"Great countries are honest, right?\\\" Jean-Pierre said to reporters. \\\"They have to be honest with themselves about the history, which is good and the bad, and our kids should be proud to be Americans after learning that history.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927176/glenn-youngkin.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Republicans plan to forcefully oppose race and diversity curricula in public schools as a core piece of their strategy in the 2022 midterm elections.
