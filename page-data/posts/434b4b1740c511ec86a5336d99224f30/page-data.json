During an October 28 game, students from the rival Armstrong High School harassed her with vulgarities as she took the ice against their River Hawks team. Video of the incident was posted to social media, and 50 to 60 students who participated in the chants have been identified.\", \"On November 6, the student played another game with her Pittsburgh Amateur Hockey League team, the Arctic Foxes. She was met with cheers and support from the audience.\", \"Mars coach Steve Meyers stood by his player in a statement, which highlighted the student's integral status on the team.\", \"\\\"We have no one else, said Meyers. \\\"She plays varsity and JV for us. We've had plenty of girls in this league before and never heard anything like this. With all the training we're required to do as coaches about safe sports and sportsmanship, this should not happen. For it to fail this badly, it's really disappointing.\\\"\", \"The Pennsylvania Interscholastic Hockey League imposed a ban against Armstrong students from attending River Hawks games.
