At Prairie View, a historically Black university, some of that optimism has been magnified by a $50 million donation from MacKenzie Scott, the former wife of Jeff Bezos, who has quietly given billions of dollars to underfunded organizations since 2020.\", \"The president of Prairie View, Ruth Simmons, is using the money for initiatives to reignite the campus, including starting a writing program, opening a center for race and justice, increasing the university\\u2019s endowment and reserving $10 million for a grant program from which some students are already benefiting.\", \"Joshua Gant, 21, remembers texting his mother several months ago about his remaining balance for the summer semester and his concerns about how it was going to get paid. He had applied for a Panther Success Grant \\u2014 created in 2020 to provide support for students financially impacted by the pandemic \\u2014 but had not heard back yet.\", \"Born in Shreveport, La., Mr. Gant came to Prairie View to study mass communication and play trombone in the marching band. At the height of the pandemic, he juggled his music, a part-time job and his virtual classes, all while managing the anxiety and depression that crept in during isolation.\", \"When he finally reached the financial aid office, Mr. Gant was told that if he didn\\u2019t pay off his tuition balance in time he would be dropped from his classes. Then, just before the deadline, $2,000 landed in his account and reduced his debt to $0.\", \"\\u201cIt said: Panther Success Grant has been added to your account,\\u201d Mr. Gant said. \\u201cI\\u2019m like, \\u2018Mom, you don\\u2019t have to worry about it.\\u2019 And she\\u2019s like, \\u2018Thank you, God.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The grant helped him quit his job so he could focus on graduating. He hopes to stay at Prairie View for graduate school, too, for audio engineering or radio broadcasting.\", \"Students, faculty and graduates of historically black colleges and universities have a special kind of school pride.\", \"This stems from the experience of attending schools where Black people aren\\u2019t the minority, where Black culture is celebrated and where the academic needs of Black students are a priority, despite historically racist systems that have made those aims difficult.\", \"But what does it feel like when decades of underfunding and lack of support make it hard for an institution to meet all of its academic and operational demands?\", \"Prairie View is the first state-supported college for African Americans in Texas and the second oldest public university in the state. Founded in 1876, it has been an incubator for Black talent. The school was built on a former plantation, where enslaved people worked the land, and, more than 140 years later, the university has educated tens of thousands of mostly African American students.\", \"Nearly 9,000 students attend Prairie View. They come from various socioeconomic backgrounds and ethnicities; many are first-generation college students and immigrants.\", \"Prairie View, one of two public H.B.C.U.s in the state, has historically received less money from the state government and philanthropists than state flagship schools like Texas A&M University, which was founded the same year.\", \"In April, The Houston Chronicle reported that Prairie View spends a larger percentage of its overall budgets to provide scholarships and support services to students, but graduates a greater number of students with more debt than those at Texas A&M.\", \"\\u201cOne of the most difficult things that we do as a state institution is to try to persuade this government that we deserve to be supported at the highest level, and so they\\u2019re not there yet,\\u201d Dr. Simmons, Prairie View\\u2019s president, said in an interview. \\u201cAfter 1876 and all of the years that we have been at work doing what we do and providing a Black professional class for the state and doing so much for the state, there still is not enough recognition of the value of the institution.\\u201d\", \"The state has worked to rectify these inequities and has made \\u201cgenerous\\u201d contributions, Dr. Simmons added, but she believes that bolstering the school\\u2019s funding initiatives is the key to a successful future.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m certainly persuaded that our future is in fund-raising,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not in being a supplicant to the state government.\\u201d\", \"Philanthropists were galvanized to assist Black communities after last year\\u2019s nationwide protests in response to the murder of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis and the exposure of the immense disparities between minority communities and nonminority communities.\", \"In 2015, a similar tragedy hit the university close to home when Sandra Bland, a 2009 graduate of Prairie View, died inside a jail cell in Waller County three days after she was arrested by a white Texas state trooper during a traffic stop.\", \"Her death spurred protests across the country as questions were raised about what happened at the jail. The Prairie View City Council later voted to change the name of University Drive, the roadway that leads to Prairie View A&M where she was stopped and arrested, to Sandra Bland Parkway.\", \"Ms. Scott first made an anonymous donation of $10 million to Prairie View in November to help during the pandemic. She gave the remaining $40 million in December and allowed the university to reveal her as the source.\", \"The university has used some of the money to create the Ruth J. Simmons Center for Race and Justice and the Toni Morrison Writing Program; revamped its library\\u2019s student center; and invested in faculty development and career services.\", \"At the end of May, the school\\u2019s endowment was more than $142 million, up from $95 million the previous year. Tulane University in New Orleans, which enrolls about 5,000 more students than Prairie View, has a pooled endowment of about $1.4 billion.\", \"Amid the excitement and optimism over the recent improvements there is also some wariness about how the additional funds from Ms. Scott will used. That concern may be underscored by past experience.\", \"Imani Taylor, 21, a senior, said that she\\u2019s excited for the recent donations but hasn\\u2019t seen much change.\", \"\\u201cI know a lot of students have wanted more parking, better housing,\\u201d said Ms. Taylor, who is studying management information systems.\", \"She described the Wi-Fi on campus as \\u201cterrible.\\u201d \\u201cAnd especially since we\\u2019re in the middle of nowhere, even our cellular doesn\\u2019t always work,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSo it\\u2019s times where the Wi-Fi will go out in the housing unit and we can\\u2019t do anything. It\\u2019ll even go out in the actual academic buildings.\\u201d\", \"She was also a recipient of the new grant and said that it has been nice to have extra funds to support her along with her scholarships, but as someone who will graduate soon, she hopes to see the underclassmen reap more benefits in the future.\", \"\\u201cEven if I don\\u2019t get to experience it, there\\u2019s going to be other generations that go here,\\u201d Ms. Taylor said. \\u201cAnd like I said, just improving the quality on campus will make a drastic difference in the lives of the students and the teachers.\\u201d\", \"Prairie View is a small, largely rural city within Waller County that comes with the quirks of having limited cellular coverage, grocery stores and restaurants. Many students acknowledged that these issues aren\\u2019t all attributable to the school but that they would like to see more efforts being made to fix them.\", \"Mr. Gant said that he notices the differences on campus between Prairie View and other, predominantly white institutions nearby with more funding and larger endowments.\", \"\\u201cRight now we still don\\u2019t have some working water in my major\\u2019s department,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHow are we supposed to wash our hands?\\u201d\", \"Issues like these aren\\u2019t exclusive to Prairie View. Last month, students at Howard University began protesting against what they described as subpar living conditions inside the dorms, including mold growth and poor Wi-Fi connections. \", \"Melanye Price, an endowed professor of political science and the director of the new race and justice center at Prairie View, said that when it comes to H.B.C.U.s, there is a tendency to believe that \\u201cwe don\\u2019t take care of it well.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s not the whole story,\\u201d Dr. Price said.\", \"She said that she had attended public schools from kindergarten through graduate school, including Prairie View as an undergraduate in the 1990s. The only school that wasn\\u2019t underfunded, she said, was a predominantly white institution, Ohio State University, where she received her Ph.D.\", \"\\u201cEndowments allow you to do the things that the state won\\u2019t pay for,\\u201d Dr. Price said. \\u201cEndowments allow you to bring back top-shelf professors and scholars to teach here because we can cut down the number of classes they can teach. Endowments help us fund more students to not drop out of school because they can\\u2019t come up with $600.\\u201d\", \"Having a deep endowment, she said, is key to \\u201cdo all the things we\\u2019ve been dreaming about over time.\\u201d She also described it as a safety net. \\u201cThere are some schools for whom, if in Covid, they had to give back all the tuition \\u2014 I\\u2019m thinking Harvard, Princeton, University of Texas \\u2014 they would still have enough money in their endowment to make it,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe wouldn\\u2019t.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Price said that Prairie View takes those who have been \\u201cunderserved\\u201d in their early education and turns \\u201cthem into engineers.\\u201d For the most part, she said, the students there are \\u201cnot trying to choose between Harvard and us. We\\u2019re taking kids who are choosing between nothing and us, and we\\u2019re saying, \\u2018I know nobody expected you to go to college. I know you were not well prepared in your high school.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Marquinn Booker, a 22-year-old from Houston and the president of Prairie View\\u2019s student body, gave the welcome remarks at the first virtual gathering for the Toni Morrison writing program. The event featured its inaugural writer-in-residence, the poet Nikki Giovanni.\", \"When it comes to the future of the university, Mr. Booker said, he\\u2019d like to see the state and others assist more in helping the university build a stronger infrastructure. But regardless of what happens, he is certain that Prairie View will continue to support its students.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m going hard behind Prairie View because Prairie View has given me something that I haven\\u2019t received anywhere else,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOnce you receive your degree, you\\u2019re supporting the fight behind your education.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"0236e2503fa311ecb542a914d30babdf"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0236e2503fa311ecb542a914d30babdf"}},
