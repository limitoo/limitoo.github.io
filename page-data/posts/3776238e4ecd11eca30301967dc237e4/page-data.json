After almost a month under house arrest following a coup, Mr. Hamdok signed a new power-sharing agreement with the military in a bid to end a bloody standoff and restore the democratic process.\", \"In Darfur, at least 43 people were killed and 46 villages burned and looted after conflict erupted last week in the Jebel Moon area between Arab herders and farmers from the Misseriya Jebel tribe, according to the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\", \"The local branch of the Central Committee of Sudanese Doctors said at least 17 people had been injured and were receiving treatment in local hospitals, though activists and aid organizations said the true number was most likely higher. The U.N. refugee agency said in an emailed statement that an unknown number of people had fled across the border into Chad. Several people, including children, remained missing, with some of those displaced fleeing into nearby mountains and caves.\", \"\\u201cThis is a serious tragedy,\\u201d said Adam Mohamed Adam, a spokesman for the Sudanese Coordinating Committee for Refugees and Displaced People, in a telephone interview. \\u201cThese are very needy people, and the world should come to their rescue.\\u201d\", \"As of Friday, the security situation in the area remained volatile, with humanitarian organizations struggling to get assurances of safety to travel into conflict areas and provide help. The deadlock remained despite a \\u201csignificant outreach to all sides,\\u201d said William Carter, the Sudan country director for the Norwegian Refugee Council.\", \"Mr. Carter said a joint mission of emergency responders was hoping to visit the area by early next week.\", \"Experts say the deadly unrest in Darfur had already begun to intensify before a hybrid United Nations and African Union mission completed its withdrawal from the region this year. Under the deposed dictator Omar Hassan al-Bashir, the region endured a campaign of rape, murder and ethnic cleansing in which at least 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million others displaced, according to the United Nations.\", \"The violence has continued despite Mr. al-Bashir\\u2019s removal from power. In January, at least 250 people, including three humanitarian workers, were killed in inter-communal clashes in West Darfur that began after armed militias attacked and besieged a camp for internally displaced people. The latest clash between farmers and herders is part of a seasonal trend around nomadic movements and harvests, but aid workers say the recent attacks have been much more brutal.\", \"\\u201cSearing ethnic violence in Darfur is devastating communities, razing whole settlements to the ground,\\u201d Mr. Carter said. \\u201cWithout a unified, civilian-led security sector, it\\u2019s difficult to see how this deterioration could be checked, reversed.\\u201d\", \"The thousands who took to the streets of the capital, Khartoum, and other major cities on Thursday to protest the deal between Mr. Hamdok and the army chief Lt. Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan demanded \\u201cjustice for the martyrs\\u201d killed in the weeks after the coup. Mr. Hamdok has been criticized by protesters and civilian members of his former cabinet for signing the agreement, arguing he was simply giving cover to continued military rule.\", \"The protesters also criticized the failure to protect the lives and properties of people in West Darfur.\", \"\\u201cDarfur is bleeding, what peace are you talking about?\\u201d some chanted, while others carried banners that read \\u201cThe entire country is Darfur\\u201d and \\u201cSudanese blood is one.\\u201d\", \"Hatim Abdallah El Fadil, a civil society activist in El Geneina in West Darfur who is monitoring the situation, said the communication blackout imposed after the coup had complicated efforts to send or receive information from the region. Mr. El Fadil said that warring parties were mobilizing in the area, and that smoke was detected yesterday around a village east of Jebel Moon.\", \"\\u201cWe are expecting more problems, given the instability in the area,\\u201d he said in a telephone interview. \\u201cThe situation is fragile.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3776238e4ecd11eca30301967dc237e4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3776238e4ecd11eca30301967dc237e4"}},
