Family members coordinate which old clothing they would want to use on the a\\u00f1o viejo (\\u201cold year\\u201d in Spanish); an uncle will bring an old pair of pants, a cousin an old shirt, and maybe someone has a hat to top it off. It often becomes something entire neighborhoods do together, Mr. Salazar said. Whenever he asks the family next door for extra sawdust to stuff the doll, they happily oblige, he said.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not really about burning it,\\u201d Mr. Salazar said. \\u201cFor us, building it is almost as important as our family dinner on the 24th of December,\\u201d he added, referring to the traditional celebration the night before Christmas.\", \"According to Odi Gonzales, a professor of Latin American and Andean studies at New York University, the burning of a\\u00f1os viejos started in Ecuador, and like many traditions in Latin America today, it is a product of mestizaje \\u2014 the racial and cultural mixing of Spanish and Indigenous peoples.\", \"\\u201cThe concept of a\\u00f1os viejos comes from European influence,\\u201d Professor Gonzales said, adding that unlike European cultures, which experience time with a beginning and an end, Andean cultures conceive of time as \\u201ccontinuous.\\u201d\", \"But rituals to expel epidemics or ailments are prehistoric and Indigenous, Professor Gonzales said.\", \"Mar\\u00eda Bel\\u00e9n Calvache, a specialist in politics and traditions in Ecuador, said in an interview that \\u201cthere are historical records in Ecuador that show that Indigenous populations, specifically the people from Otavalo, would burn a doll symbolizing a feudal leader during the celebration of the solstice in December, March and June.\\u201d\", \"She added, \\u201cThey were burned as a symbol of regeneration.\\u201d\", \"The first a\\u00f1os viejos as we know them today were burned along the Andean sierra in major Ecuadorean cities like Quito and Guayaquil in the 19th century, historians explained. The burnings were the climax of a 10-day Catholic celebration marking the end of the year, running from Dec. 28, the Day of the Innocents, to Three Kings Day, on Jan. 6.\", \"During those days, people wore masks and costumes on the streets. On Dec. 31, large rag dolls representing drunken old men were carried through the streets by masked people dressed in white to represent their weeping widows, Ms. Calvache explained. Because the drunks didn\\u2019t leave wills, the widows would roam about asking for money. At midnight, the rag doll would be burned, \\u201cand a humorous testament where different things are left to the mourners is read,\\u201d Ms. Calvache added. Those things were usually satirical omens or wishes for prosperity.\", \"\\u201cFor a fundamentally working-class society, end-of-the-year celebrations were an opportunity to forget about sorrows through parties,\\u201d said Alfonso Ortiz Crespo, a historian and architect from Ecuador. \\u201cIt was a time to make fun of the other \\u2014 not only civil authority, but also make fun of the neighbor, the friend and the relative, or the political enemy.\\u201d\", \"Today in Ecuador, a\\u00f1os viejos are burned mostly by teenagers and young adults, Ms. Calvache said. But for the last two years, the burning of a\\u00f1os viejos has been prohibited across the country to prevent large gatherings amid the coronavirus pandemic.\", \"Today, it\\u2019s more common to see papier-m\\u00e2ch\\u00e9 a\\u00f1os viejos modeled after superheroes or comic book monsters than effigies made of rags, but some parts of Ecuador and Colombia still keep to tradition.\", \"In Pasto, every Dec. 31, there\\u2019s a parade of a\\u00f1os viejos made by the city\\u2019s artists. \\u201cDuring this parade, many artisans use a\\u00f1os viejos to pose a cultural and political critique of the country,\\u201d Mr. Salazar said. That usually means parading around likenesses of politicians.\", \"Former President \\u00c1lvaro Uribe of Colombia, former President Donald J. Trump of the United States and Hugo Ch\\u00e1vez, the Venezuelan leader who died in 2013, are some of the most common faces. Steve Harvey, the television host, had a surge in popularity after he wrongly crowned Miss Colombia the winner of the 2015 Miss Universe pageant.\", \"Last year, there were many a\\u00f1os viejos wearing masks and holding hand sanitizer, a nod to the raging coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Salazar said.\", \"The main reason the tradition continues, though, is because of families.\", \"Mr. Salazar remembers building a\\u00f1os viejos with his grandfather when he was little. \\u201cWe used to fill them with fireworks,\\u201d he said, a practice that is now illegal in Colombia. \\u201cThe loudest a\\u00f1o viejo meant that you were the most macho in the neighborhood.\\u201d\", \"Nicol\\u00e1s Franco, a civil engineer from Bogot\\u00e1, Colombia\\u2019s capital, began making a\\u00f1os viejos six years ago. He and his family would spend Christmas in Pereira, in the coffee-growing region of Colombia. In Bogot\\u00e1, \\u201cyou really don\\u2019t see a\\u00f1os viejos,\\u201d he said. But when he traveled to Pereira, they lined the streets.\", \"Mr. Franco, 60, really enjoyed the idea of burning away the bad things of the year. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a cleansing,\\u201d he said.\", \"Camila Pava of Cali, Colombia, who works in user experience, says a\\u00f1os viejos are a way to reset with her family. Around 11:30 p.m. on New Year\\u2019s Eve, her entire family sits around and writes what they want to get rid of. \\u201cIt can be personal, like about love, or about the world, like Covid,\\u201d Ms. Pava, 28, explained.\", \"Everyone then tucks the notes in the hat, pants and shirt of the a\\u00f1o viejo, a small rag doll given by her aunt. As they light the a\\u00f1o viejo, after eating 12 grapes and making 12 wishes, she and her family talk to one another about what they want to accomplish and change in the next year. To Ms. Pava, it feels grounding and cathartic.\", \"\\u201cI love believing in that little bit of magic,\\u201d she said.\"]","href_hash":"b79e4575695c11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b79e4575695c11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
