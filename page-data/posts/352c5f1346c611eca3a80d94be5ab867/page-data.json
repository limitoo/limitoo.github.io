Snow sports equipment, which includes things like snowshoes and cross-country skis as well as alpine skis and snowboards, was up 7 percent between August 2020 and March 2021 compared to the same period before the pandemic, according to the retail analysts NPD Group. Alpine equipment outpaced that, growing 8 percent.\", \"\\u201cThere wasn\\u2019t enough inventory in the marketplace to articulate how big the trend to snow sports was,\\u201d said Ben Johns, the general merchandising manager for action sports at the outdoor retailer REI.\", \"As of this August, REI\\u2019s sales of winter equipment had begun to rise dramatically, with cross country and snowshoeing equipment running ahead of downhill.\", \"Supply chain issues, which have plagued manufacturing, are also threatening snow sports equipment, especially apparel.\", \"In this pinch, how is a snow fan to gear up \\u2014 literally \\u2014 for the season ahead? The following are a few strategies that span the spectrum of budgets.\", \"The surge to the slopes last year also drove traffic to ski shops, which couldn\\u2019t keep up with demand. Though retailers like REI say they are well-stocked now, ski sales are already growing by triple digits each week.\", \"\\u201cWe will have no problem selling everything, but folks buying early are doing the right thing. Supply will be constrained,\\u201d Mr. Johns said.\", \"Just getting goods in stores is a challenge. The Outdoor Industry Association, which represents more than 1,200 manufacturers, distributors, retailers and others in outdoor businesses, said snow gear manufacturing has been affected by aluminum and carbon fiber shortages. But many skis are made in Europe, where factories have not had the pandemic-related slowdowns seen in Asia.\", \"Still, prices are likely to be higher this year.\", \"\\u201cAll goods are suffering from higher shipping costs and major shipping delays before and after they arrive at ports in North America,\\u201d said Kelly Davis, the director of research for the association.\", \"The current season\\u2019s sales figures include a spillover by shoppers who were frustrated last winter.\", \"\\u201cAnother supply chain issue that is unique to the outdoor industry was the massive consumer demand from last year that has carried over to this year,\\u201d said Reese Brown, the executive director of the Cross Country Ski Areas Association. \\u201cVirtually every pair of skis and boots were sold last year.\\u201d\", \"While your ski trip may be months ahead, it\\u2019s not too early to purchase equipment. The average cost for a classic women\\u2019s cross-country kit of skis, bindings, boots and poles costs about $500 at REI.\", \"\\u201cIf you are in the market for new product, the sooner the better,\\u201d Mr. Sargent said. \\u201cIf you wait, there\\u2019s no guarantee you\\u2019re going to find what you\\u2019re looking for.\\u201d\", \"That goes for used equipment, too. Aaron Provine, the president and chief executive of Geartrade, an online dealer of used sporting goods, said snow gear sales started to pick up two months earlier than usual this year, in August, and that sales are already outpacing last year, which was big.\", \"\\u201cIt seems people are being more methodical,\\u201d he said.\", \"Depending on the condition of the skis, buyers may save between 30 and 80 percent at the site compared to new equipment. The problem with buying used, of course, is finding your size, particularly in boots. It may pay to check the site frequently; Mr. Provine expects more inventory once retail delivery issues are resolved as purchasers of new gear resell the old.\", \"For rental services, particularly those that deliver, last winter was a watershed season.\", \"\\u201cA lot of people chose delivery versus a traditional ski shop because they didn\\u2019t want to wait in line,\\u201d said Mike Cremeno, the chief marketing officer for Ski Butlers, a rental delivery service based in Park City, Utah, that services 50 resorts worldwide. \\u201cJust like people were willing to try something new like grocery delivery, a lot gave us a try.\\u201d\", \"Renters choose where Ski Butlers\\u2019 staffers meet them for fittings, typically at their resort or rental home. The company exclusively rents Rossignol gear, with prices starting at $41 a day with a minimum of two days (except for the weeks of Christmas and New Year\\u2019s, when the minimum is three days).\", \"With ski travel expected to rise, rental skis could be the new rental car: the last thing a traveler thinks about, only to be surprised by a shortage.\", \"\\u201cLast year was reactive,\\u201d Mr. Cremeno said, noting shorter lead times on bookings by skiers making last-minute plans. \\u201cThis year, we\\u2019re getting back to normal, with planning three to six months out.\\u201d\", \"Rental operations say they serve both novice and experienced skiers and riders, the former because they lack the equipment and the latter because they are interested in trying out the latest models. Black Tie Ski Rental Delivery, which has been in the business for 20 years, encourages beginners to try the better ski packages, usually about a $10 a day upgrade.\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re learning to drive for the first time, would you be happier with a Porsche or a rusty old pickup truck with brakes that don\\u2019t work?\\u201d said Ian Prichard, the president and co-founder of the company.\", \"Black Tie has 18 locations \\u2014 including new outlets in Whitefish, Mont., and Boone, N.C. \\u2014 serving 45 resorts. The individually owned operations carry equipment customized to local conditions. Prices vary by location, with ski and snowboard packages starting at 47 Canadian dollars a day (about $37) in Banff, Alberta, and $56 in South Lake Tahoe, Calif.\", \"As with getting a restaurant reservation, early birds can pick the time slot they want for a fitting, while those who wait risk being shut out. Renters can swap out different skis during their rental term, including getting wider powder skis in anticipation of a snowstorm.\", \"\\u201cThe phones light up the night before a powder day because people want to switch it up,\\u201d Mr. Pritchard said.\", \"Advance rental reservations often come with a discount, including up to 20 percent at Christy Sports, which has 63 locations in Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Washington.\", \"Vail Resorts owns Breeze Ski Rentals, which offers online booking for pickup at 16 locations in Colorado, Utah and British Columbia. Advance bookings in the Denver area in December, for example, cost $19 a day for skis, boots and poles compared to $29 for walk-in customers. Epic Pass holders get an additional 20 percent off rates.\", \"Last year, Vail Resorts launched Epic Mountain Rentals, which offers free delivery at many of its resorts.\", \"Generally speaking, the farther you are from a ski resort, the cheaper the rentals.\", \"Two winters ago, I priced rental gear for a ski trip to Taos, N.M., from a shop affiliated with Christy Sports in Santa Fe and another of its locations at the base of Taos Ski Valley. The difference in rates, about $5 a day, added up over a week of skiing for a family of three. In the end, an early flight departure made it impossible to return the skis in Santa Fe when the shop was open, so we went with the more expensive alternative.\", \"\\u201cWe try to meet skiers and customers where they\\u2019re at,\\u201d said Matt Gold, the chief executive of Christy Sports. Compared to outlets in resort bases, he said, \\u201cthe city stores and mountain town stores will be a little bit less, but then you have to transport the equipment yourself.\\u201d\", \"Sometimes, it\\u2019s worth it. Last ski season, a trip to Aspen took me through Glenwood Springs, Colo., where it was convenient to rent from a local shop, Brian\\u2019s Bench. Paying $24 a day, I saved about half of what I would have spent at the resort\\u2019s rental shops.\", \"For those staying local or driving regionally, many REI stores in northern regions rent downhill and cross-country skis as well as snowshoes. Prices for classic cross-country ski packages, with skis, boots and poles, start at $22 for the first night and $13 for each additional night. Downhill packages start at $28 for the first night and $17 for each additional night.\", \"Supply shortages may be felt the most in winter apparel, much of which is manufactured in Asia, where factories have been slowed by the pandemic and goods have been subject to shipping delays.\", \"If your old parka won\\u2019t do, or you hadn\\u2019t needed one, try a secondhand source like Geartrade, which has strong inventory of jackets searchable by size. For a more temporary solution, the outdoor industry has its own version of Rent the Runway in services that supply outerwear.\", \"Kit Lender, which ships rental winter apparel to your destination, providing pre-addressed packaging for returns, offers a men\\u2019s set that includes a jacket and snow pants from Patagonia, Kombi gloves and Smith goggles for $49 a day, with a three-day minimum, and a women\\u2019s kit from Helly Hansen at $45 a day.\", \"For the youngest family members who are likely to outgrow their winter gear from year to year, Kit Lender has toddler sets from $16 a day, as well as clothing for older children from $20. The service also has sport-specific apparel for snowboarding, snowmobiling and snowshoeing.\", \"Slope Threads, a shop based in Golden, Colo., also ships its rental apparel to your destination (free with orders made more than five business days in advance). Fashion meets function in the inventory, with lots of color combinations. Prices for adult sets start around $45 a day.\", \"Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.
