Zalatoris, 25, of the United States, tied for sixth at the United States Open, eighth at the PGA Championship and won the PGA Tour\\u2019s Rookie of the Year. Most notably, Zalatoris crashed onto golf\\u2019s center stage when he took second at the Masters, losing to Hideki Matsuyama of Japan by one stroke\", \"\\u201cThis past year has been pretty crazy,\\u201d Zalatoris said in an interview. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s all good stuff. It\\u2019s been a lot of fun. Augusta is the one I\\u2019m most proud of, though. Just knowing that I can put myself in that position and be in contention and handle it. It\\u2019s nice to know that you can do stuff like that. It\\u2019s motivating.\\u201d\", \"Zalatoris, who is No. 11 in the Race to Dubai, has been working on distance control, but said there is no secret to his success. \\u201cThe good is really good,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe just need to make the bad a little bit better.\\u201d\", \"Matt Fitzpatrick\", \"Fitzpatrick, 27, of England is the defending champion and comes to Dubai fresh off a win at the Andalucia Masters in Spain, making for a total of seven wins on the European Tour.\", \"\\u201cI really think my game is trending in the right direction,\\u201d he told reporters recently. \\u201cPlaying well in the next few weeks, I\\u2019ll hopefully have some good results.\\u201d\", \"Fitzpatrick, No. 6 in the Race to Dubai, said it was important to manage the amount of pressure he puts on himself and to be patient.\", \"\\u201cI think for me it\\u2019s just about trying to have consistency throughout the whole four aspects of my game,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThis year it\\u2019s been driving and putting, but my approach play\\u2019s been off, so hopefully I\\u2019ll get that to a better level and keep going with that.\\u201d\", \"Collin Morikawa\", \"Morikawa, 24, of the United States, made his Dubai debut last year and is leading the Race to Dubai this year.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve put myself in a pretty strong position to win,\\u201d he said in a phone interview. \\u201cNow, I\\u2019m trying to get prepped, just like any other event. I\\u2019m coming out trying to win. It\\u2019s going to be a great field of players. I\\u2019ve seen this course, and I know what to expect.\\u201d\", \"Morikawa is working on \\u201ca few small things,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSome things are physical, and some things are mental. It\\u2019s just about getting a little sharper. It\\u2019s the end of the season, and sometimes you get a little too relaxed.

You try to be consistent and keep a routine. It\\u2019s about being simple and thinking simple things when you\\u2019re out on the golf course. Sometimes that\\u2019s not so easy. I can\\u2019t think about protecting my lead. I just need to go out and hit the target.\\u201d\", \"Richard Bland\", \"Bland, of England, made headlines in May when he took his first European Tour win at the British Masters at 48 years old.\", \"After grinding his way through 478 tournaments over more than two decades, Bland finally won.

It\\u2019s hard to explain why a win didn\\u2019t happen earlier. I just carried on playing well since the win. I haven\\u2019t changed the way I practice. I\\u2019m not trying to do anything different. Everything just clicked into place, and then you get the confidence of winning. It just snowballed from there.\\u201d\", \"Comfort, consistency and a clear head work for Bland. \\u201cI\\u2019m not a big tinkerer, or changer of things,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf it ain\\u2019t broke, then don\\u2019t try and fix it. If your game is in good shape, then just go play. I don\\u2019t want too many thoughts going around in my head.\\u201d\", \"Min Woo Lee\", \"Lee, 23 of Australia, is the latest to crack the Race to Dubai top 10 after three recent performances on the European Tour.

The results place him at No. 5 on the Race to Dubai.\", \"\\u201cI was going to take this week off, but I thought my form was pretty solid and it would be another challenge in front of me and I could overcome it,\\u201d Lee said in a statement. \\u201cIt is tough, I haven\\u2019t been home in six months, but I\\u2019m looking forward to going home and relaxing.\\u201d\", \"Earlier this season, Lee notched his first two wins on the tour, narrowly edging out Fitzpatrick at the Scottish Open and finishing two shots ahead of Ryan Fox of New Zealand at the ISPS Handa Vic Open.\"]","href_hash":"dcbfd22a479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dcbfd22a479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}},
