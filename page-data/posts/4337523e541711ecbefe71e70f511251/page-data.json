He saw his front door was smashed and an intoxicated man charged at him.\", \"He then retreated to his car and called police but said they did not show up until about an hour later.\", \"\\\"We were calling ... next door the liquor person was also calling continously,\\\" Singh-Rana said.\", \"\\\"Police came very late, for maybe one hour [we waited].\\\"\", \"Jash Kanakia, the manager of a liquor store on the same premises, said the drunk man had been causing issues there for a while.\", \"He said the man punched their grille door after staff refused to let him in and sell him alcohol, and yelled racist and threatening comments.\", \"CCTV footage also shows the man chasing customers away, breaking a letter box, tossing around road cones, advertisement stands and a wood pallet.\", \"Kanakia said he and other staff were hiding in the back of the store and kept calling police, but the wait was ridiculously long.\", \"\\\"It's a right to ask questions ... Why are you so late?

Now don't get me wrong, police are doing their good job, but there is not enough police. They are stretched.
