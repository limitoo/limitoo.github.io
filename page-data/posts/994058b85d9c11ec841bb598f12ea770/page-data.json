That left the production in limbo and London\\u2019s theater world wondering if anyone would dare to take it on.\", \"Now, there is an answer. On Aug. 19, 2022, Gilliam\\u2019s \\u201cInto the Woods\\u201d will debut at the Theater Royal in Bath, 115 miles from London. The show will run through Sep. 10, 2022, the theater said in a statement.\", \"The fuss around the revival \\u2014 which had received Sondheim\\u2019s blessing before his death \\u2014 began in May, when the Old Vic announced the production as the centerpiece of its new season. That news caused a stir on British social media, because of comments Gilliam had made, in a newspaper interview, about the MeToo movement and so-called cancel culture.\", \"In January 2020, Gilliam told The Independent that MeToo \\u201cwas a witch hunt\\u201d and that he was tired of white men \\u201cbeing blamed for everything that is wrong with the world.\\u201d Anyway, he added, he now identified as \\u201ca Black lesbian in transition.\\u201d\", \"According to a report in The Stage, a British theater newspaper, \\u201csome within the Old Vic team\\u201d felt Gilliam\\u2019s comments were \\u201cat odds with the theater\\u2019s culture and values.\\u201d\", \"On May 12, Kate Varah, the Old Vic\\u2019s executive director, addressed staff concerns at an internal meeting. She said that she had spoken with Gilliam and that the conversation had reassured her that he shared the theater\\u2019s values.\", \"But the dispute escalated after Gilliam wrote a post on Facebook about \\u201cThe Closer,\\u201d the Dave Chappelle comedy special on Netflix. In the show, the comedian comments mockingly on transgender issues and aligns himself with some feminists who say a transgender woman\\u2019s biological sex determines her gender and can\\u2019t be changed. Dozens of Netflix employees in Los Angeles staged a walkout over the special, accusing Netflix of endorsing bigotry.\", \"\\u201cThere is a storm brewing over Netflix\\u2019s support for the show,\\u201d Gilliam wrote on Oct. 14. \\u201cI\\u2019d love to hear your opinions.\\u201d\", \"On Nov. 1, the Old Vic and Scenario Two, the musical\\u2019s co-producers, announced that they had \\u201cmutually agreed to cancel the production,\\u201d leading British newspapers to speculate that the Facebook post was the reason behind the decision. The theater and the director both declined to comment for this article. But on Monday, Gilliam said on Facebook that a group of up-and-coming playwrights, directors, costume designers and others at the theater was responsible for the cancellation.\", \"Gilliam said that members of a short-term artistic development program at the theater, called the Old Vic 12, had \\u201cintimidated\\u201d the playhouse into canceling the musical after he recommended Chappelle\\u2019s special to his Facebook followers.\", \"Members of the program were \\u201cclosed-minded, humor-averse ideologues,\\u201d Gilliam said, adding, \\u201cFreedom of Speech is often attacked, but I never imagined that Freedom of Recommendation would be under threat as well.\\u201d\", \"Three members of the Old Vic 12 declined to comment, but one did note that the program had ended several months before the Old Vic reached its decision on \\u201cInto the Woods.\\u201d\", \"In a phone interview, John Berry, a co-founder of Scenario Two, declined to comment on the Old Vic\\u2019s decision. \", \"His focus was on making an entertaining show, he added. \\u201cFor me, nothing else matters.\\u201d\", \"The controversy around \\u201cInto the Woods\\u201d is not the only recent scandal involving accusations of bigotry in London\\u2019s theaters. In November, several prominent Jewish celebrities and journalists accused the Royal Court Theater of perpetuating antisemitic tropes after it staged a new play by the British playwright Al Smith, called \\u201cRare Earth Mettle.\\u201d Early performances in the show\\u2019s run featured a character called Hershel Fink, a big-nosed, greedy billionaire who seemed to embody negative stereotypes about Jewish people.\", \"After a barrage of criticism on social media and in British newspapers, the character\\u2019s name was changed. The theater said in a statement that a Jewish theater director had raised concerns about the character in a September workshop: \\u201cWe acknowledge our wrongdoing and will include antisemitism in future anti-oppression practices and training,\\u201d the statement said.\", \"Berry declined to comment on whether the two controversies had implications for theater makers, but added, \\u201cI have my own views.\\u201d\", \"He was certain of one thing, though: \\u201cThere\\u2019s certainly not going to be anything controversial\\u201d in his production of \\u201cInto the Woods.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be vintage Terry Gilliam,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"994058b85d9c11ec841bb598f12ea770"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"994058b85d9c11ec841bb598f12ea770"}},
