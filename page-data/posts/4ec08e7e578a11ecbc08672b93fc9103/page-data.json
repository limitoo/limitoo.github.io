Now, at 27, he has opened Bonnie\\u2019s, a restaurant of his own, realizing the dream of many young chefs. Mr. Eng, a Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, native whose family is Cantonese, named the restaurant for his mother, who nurtured his understanding of Cantonese food, which he said he rejected at first but has now embraced. At Bonnie\\u2019s, he\\u2019s putting an international spin on the cuisine, bathing won-tons in Parmesan broth, dressing long beans in garlic butter, marrying cacio e pepe with fermented bean curd, and plating glazed steamed ribs with bread-and-butter pickles. He\\u2019s also tinkering with some Cantonese dishes like pepper steak velveted and served with charred onions and peppers and crisp Hong Kong noodles; and boned whole trout, a labor-intensive affair stuffed with shrimp, ginger and water chestnuts. \\u201cI\\u2019m bringing my background into the forefront but with variations, changing up old-school Cantonese,\\u201d he said.\", \"Just past the entrance to the new Irish Arts Center, housed in a century-old former auto repair shop in Hell\\u2019s Kitchen, is this cafe with a bar, lounge seating and some high-top tables, all done in mossy tones of velours with dark wood accents. Some Irish materials like repurposed Waterford crystal and Connemara marble are also used. The food is handled by Ardesia, Mandy Oser\\u2019s nearby wine bar, and will include Irish cheeses and sausages, brown bread with smoked salmon, potato-leek soup with black pudding, small savory pies and colcannon puffs. \\u201cIt\\u2019s Irish with a modern twist,\\u201d Ms. Oser said. Drinks emphasize Ireland with Guinness on tap and Irish whiskies, but also New York with beers from each borough. For now, it will be open starting 90 minutes before performances, and after. (Opens Wednesday) \", \"Emmett Burke brought the deep-dish pizzas of his native Chicago to his West Village restaurant, Emmett\\u2019s, in 2013. Now he\\u2019s expanding his footprint in the neighborhood with a fuller Italian American menu of meatballs with and without spaghetti, chicken Parm and pizzas. Here, the pizza crusts are cracker-thin, or tavern-style, another Chicago taste, and served classically topped with tomato and cheese, or with spicy elements, or as a build-your-own version. There\\u2019s a 20-seat bar up front and a 55-seat dining room hung with art posters. (Wednesday)\", \"Michelle Morgan was inspired by her mother, who is from Hong Kong, when she opened Tiger Lily Kitchen for only delivery during the pandemic. It specialized in gluten-free food. Now, it\\u2019s ready for dining in, as well as delivery and pickup, and she\\u2019s serving mostly vegetarian fare from the same template. Dishes include organic tofu bites, spicy grilled Japanese eggplant, celery root steak with carrot and ginger dressing, and curried fish steamed in a banana leaf. It\\u2019s a gracious spot, with rose tones dominating the d\\u00e9cor. (Friday)\", \"Thailand meets the American diner at this bi-level space, the latest from Hand Hospitality, known for Her Name Is Han and Little Mad. The waffles that come with a fried chicken dish are made with coconut milk. Crab meat finds its way into the mac and cheese. And the omelet is more Eastern than Western. Other dishes like tom yum ramen, fish in banana leaf and beef noodle soup hew more closely to the Thai kitchen. \", \"This all-day sandwich shop and cafe from the group behind L\\u2019Artusi is adjacent to its new wine bar, b\\u2019artusi. Breakfast items like cacio e pepe scones are followed by an array of creative Italian sandwiches and salads like a sunchoke Caesar. The shop also sells Italian grocery items like olive oils, cheeses and L\\u2019Artusi\\u2019s jarred sauces. And it does double duty: In the evening, it becomes the kitchen for L\\u2019Artusi\\u2019s takeout orders. \", \"This Mexican restaurant left its original location at 58th Street and First Avenue in 2019 and reopened at 52nd Street and Second Avenue this year. It then closed awaiting a liquor license. Now, it has reopened, necessary paperwork secured, in the two-level space with seating indoors and out. The executive chef is Judy Cooper. \", \"The menu at the Moynihan Train Hall is beginning to expand. First up, opening Wednesday, is H&H Bagels with made-to-order sandwiches like smoked salmon and cream cheese, griddled eggs and various spreads. It\\u2019s on the main concourse level, just outside what will be the Moynihan Food Hall. The food hall will open in January with an assortment of spots, including Alidoro, Jacob\\u2019s Pickles, E.A.K. Ramen and Burger Joint. (Wednesday) \", \"The idea behind this company is as follows: Several restaurants use a huge kitchen to independently prepare food for delivery and pickup, and consumers can order from any of them in a single shot. At some locations, customers can also dine in. The model is now operating in San Jose and Pasadena, Calif.; Austin, Tex.; Scottsdale, Ariz.; Chicago; and now New York, where Han Dynasty, Caf\\u00e9 Habana, Jersey Mike\\u2019s and, from London, Camille Thai are involved. This location has no seating. The company also has opened a branch at 30 Vandam Street (Varick Street) and has others coming to Hudson Yards and Garden City, N.Y. \", \"In November, to celebrate the eighth anniversary of their Long Island City restaurant\\u2019s Crescent Street location, Sarah Obraitis and Hugue Dufour held a market selling foods and crafts. There\\u2019s a pre-Christmas repeat on tap for Sunday from noon to 6 p.m. This one will be bigger, with items like gingerbread house kits, escargot kits, charcuterie, pastrami, ice cream, chili crisps, breads, and foods from Vermont to buy or for snacking on the spot. (Sunday)\", \"After nearly 25 years, Nick Livanos is closing his family\\u2019s rustic 200-seat Greek restaurant. The pandemic shuttered the Wellington Hotel, where it is. The restaurant\\u2019s last day will be Dec. 31. Mr. Livanos is looking for a new, smaller location.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
