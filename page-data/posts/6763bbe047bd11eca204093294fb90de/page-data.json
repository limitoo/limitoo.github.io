He has no family here.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Hasan\\u2019s fate was not unique. Two Syrians found late Sunday by aid workers, and seen by The New York Times, had been stranded in the forest straddling the Polish-Belarusian border for days and were in an advanced stage of hypothermia. With their faces half-frozen and their lips blue from the cold, they were barely able to utter a word to the aid workers who found them.\", \"\\u201cThey had been in the forest for at least four days,\\u201d said Agata Kolodziej from Fundacja Ocalenie, a Polish charity that has been helping migrants since September. \\u201cThey only told us their names. We don\\u2019t know anything more.\\u201d\", \"The brothers, Layous, 41 and Khedr, 39, were also from Homs. A medical worker helped to carry the brothers to an ambulance parked on the edge of an unlit road next to Orla, Poland, about 15 miles from the border, the aid workers said.\", \"The Polish activists, whose phone numbers have been circulating among migrants at the border, said they were receiving several messages a day from migrants over the past two months, including from the Syrian brothers. But since last week, the activists\\u2019 phones have gone largely silent, and aid workers have seen few signs of migrants on the Polish side.\", \"Instead, among the only sign of migrants managing to cross the border, passing through one of Europe\\u2019s oldest and densest forests, are objects that aid workers and residents have found on daily patrols: a backpack filled with documents and passport pictures; an empty tuna can with a Belarusian label; a Cham Wings boarding pass for a flight between Damascus and Minsk; an ophthalmologist prescription written in Arabic.\", \"Still, as the funeral proceeded in Bohoniki, Belarusian forces were massing large groups of migrants and encouraging them to force their way across the border at Kuznica-Bruzgi, a 15-minute drive to the northeast. There, Polish troops and police officers were deployed in long lines to defend the border, which is festooned with large spirals of razor wire.\", \"A video sent to The New York Times by Nishan Abdulqadr Mustafa, a 25-year-old Kurd from Iraq who is on the Belarusian side of the border, showed hundreds of migrants stranded outside the checkpoint at Kuznica-Bruzgi.\", \"\\u201cWe are going to Poland,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt is just too cold, we cannot take it anymore.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6763bbe047bd11eca204093294fb90de"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6763bbe047bd11eca204093294fb90de"}},
