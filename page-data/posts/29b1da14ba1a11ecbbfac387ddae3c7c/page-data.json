Vake was unable to break his fall and his head hit the asphalt road.\", \"The fall caused a skull fracture and brain bleeding, which, despite surgery, could not be recovered from. Vake died in hospital nine days later.\", \"Fau's brother Ika was also attacked, including by Havili. Ika was hospitalised but survived.\", \"Of the four men charged, Daniel Havili, 30, was the only one charged with manslaughter.\", \"Two others have pleaded guilty to assault. Ofa He Mooni Folau was last year sentenced to six months' home detention and Siofilisi Paongo is yet to be sentenced.

It was not a series of punches, she said, or the most forceful punch. However it was enough to cause Vake to fall backward and hit his head, which caused his death.\", \"\\\"It goes without saying that your offending is serious, given the manslaughter charge. Your actions led to the death of another,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"It was also gratuitous, given you yourself were not threatened by Liufau.\\\"\", \"Justice Fitzgerald noted that Havili grew up with \\\"a culture of violence\\\" in Tonga, and suffered from deprivation, hardship and housing instability. He himself was attacked when he was 15 years old and was hospitalised for six months.\", \"\\\"Childhood trauma, leading to anger management issues, is also an underlying cause. I accept that there is a causal link between the deprivation and violence that charactersied your upbringing and offending,\\\" Fitzgerald said.\", \"\\\"Your rehabilitation will depend very largely on you not drinking. It's as simple as that. You will need targeted counselling to address some of the deep-seated issues that arise from your childhood. But I accept you are genuinely motivated to rehabilitate.\\\"\", \"She noted Havili had not drunk alcohol since shortly after the time of the offending.\", \"Fitzgerald found the \\\"starting point\\\" of imprisonment for Havili's offending, in comparison to other similar cases, should be five years imprisonment. She gave him a standard 25 percent discount for pleading guilty, a 15 percent discount for the deprivation and violence which characterised his upbringing, and a further five percent for his remorse and rehabilitative attempts.\", \"Justice Fitzgerald imposed a final sentenced on Daniel Havili of two years and nine months in prison.\"]","href_hash":"29b1da14ba1a11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"29b1da14ba1a11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
