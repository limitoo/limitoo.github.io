Activists have staged protests outside her office and begun a hunger strike to urge Ms. Sinema to support changing the Senate rules to allow voting-rights legislation to pass with a simple 50-vote majority.\", \"But she has steadfastly refused, and reiterated her opposition to scrapping the filibuster in a Jan. 13 speech on the Senate floor, arguing that the parliamentary tactic \\u201chas been used repeatedly to protect against wild swings in federal policy.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sinema said that she supported the Democratic voting-rights legislation, but that she believed doing away with the filibuster would worsen America\\u2019s political divisions.\", \"The opposition from Ms. Sinema and Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia to changing the 60-vote threshold required in the Senate to move major legislation forward has all but doomed the Democrats\\u2019 hopes of passing federal voting legislation.\", \"The Arizona Democratic chairwoman, Raquel Ter\\u00e1n, said on Saturday that the party\\u2019s executive board had voted for the censure because of Ms. Sinema\\u2019s \\u201cfailure to do whatever it takes to ensure the health of democracy.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Ter\\u00e1n said voting rights were already being threatened in Arizona, and cited Republican proposals to limit mail-in voting and a widely criticized Republican-run audit of the 2020 election results in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix and 60 percent of the state\\u2019s registered voters. Democrats nationally cite a barrage of Republican legislation aimed at the rules for voting, as well as counting and certifying votes as a fundamental threat to American democracy.\", \"\\u201cThe ramifications of failing to pass federal legislation that protects their right to vote are too large and far-reaching,\\u201d Ms. Ter\\u00e1n said in a statement.\", \"Hannah Hurley, a spokeswoman for Ms. Sinema, said in a statement that Ms. Sinema had been consistent about her opposition to changing the filibuster.\", \"\\u201cKyrsten has always promised Arizonans she would be an independent voice for the state \\u2014 not for either political party,\\u201d Ms. Hurley said. \\u201cShe\\u2019s delivered for Arizonans and has always been honest about where she stands.\\u201d\", \"Arizona\\u2019s other senator, Mark Kelly, also a Democrat, said last week that he would support weakening the filibuster rules to pass voting rights legislation.\", \"Ms. Sinema, a onetime Green Party-affiliated activist, has won praise from Republicans and infuriated Democrats by bucking her own party as a senator who represents a closely divided swing state.\", \"In being censured by her own party, she joins a club that includes former Senator John McCain, former Senator Jeff Flake and the state\\u2019s sitting Republican governor, Doug Ducey, who have all been censured by the Arizona State Republican Party.\", \"Barrett Marson, a Republican political strategist, said that those censures of prominent Arizona Republicans by their own party had little effect, and that he doubted the censure alone would hurt Ms. Sinema\\u2019s political fortunes. But, he said Ms. Sinema\\u2019s problems go far deeper than the censure vote.\", \"\\u201cThe censure in and of itself means absolutely nothing,\\u201d Mr. Marson said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a feckless move. However, Senator Sinema certainly has a broader problem than just a censure from the party faithful.\\u201d\", \"Those problems include fierce discontent among Democratic voters, who have signaled they might prefer a liberal alternative to Ms. Sinema, such as Representative Ruben Gallego, a Phoenix congressman some activists are hoping to draft into a primary.\", \"The fund-raising group Emily\\u2019s List, a major supporter of Ms. Sinema in her 2018 run for Senate, has also threatened to pull its support, and she has recorded flagging numbers among her Democratic base in recent polls.\"]","href_hash":"ce5f3b227bc411ec8d4659aad80c962d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ce5f3b227bc411ec8d4659aad80c962d"}},
