The clip, found here, has gone viral in the day since it was posted, racking up 1.1 million views, 37,400 likes, and 3,000 comments at the time of writing.\", \"The question of when babies should sleep remains somewhat contentious. Some, such as sleep resource Baby Sleep Science, argue that \\\"as long as your child is getting enough sleep...then an early or late bedtime is fine as long as it suits your family's schedule.\\\"\", \"Family therapist Kim West (also known as \\\"The Sleep Lady\\\"), however, noted to Pampers that a late bedtime can disrupt a baby's circadian rhythm\\u2014the natural, 24-hour process that regulates one's hormones and wake-sleep cycle.\", \"\\\"A young child's circadian rhythm naturally wakes them as early as 6:00 to 7:30 a.m. Too late a bedtime means they'll still awaken, but with less sleep,\\\" noted West. In addition to more sleep, an earlier bedtime is linked to babies falling asleep more easily.\", \"Wrote TikToker @toriyav, also known as Victoria, in her video's on-screen captions: \\\"I never understood why parents would put their babies to bed at 7:00 pm.\\\"\", \"\\\"That just means when they have their full 12 hours of sleep, they [will] wake up at 7:00 am,\\\" she explained. \\\"And us being stay-at-home parents, this isn't very necessary.\\\"\", \"She adds that \\\"as long as the baby has their needed amount of sleep,\\\" it doesn't matter what their bedtime is. \\\"Time is a man made thing.
