The parent company also owns Tidal, a music streaming service, Cash App, a payment service, and a developer platform focused on Bitcoin called TBD54566975. Square said there would be no organizational changes made to the company other than the name change.\", \"\\u201cThe name has many associated meanings for the company \\u2014 building blocks, neighborhood blocks and their local businesses, communities coming together at block parties full of music, a blockchain, a section of code, and obstacles to overcome,\\u201d the company said in its release. It expects the name change to be official on Dec. 10.\", \"Mr. Dorsey has in recent years grown more fascinated by cryptocurrencies and the promise of decentralization that blockchain technology could allow for. In 2019, he said Twitter would help create a decentralized type of social media in which users could make their own algorithms and moderate their own communities. The only thing in his Twitter bio is \\u201c#bitcoin.\\u201d\", \"A foray deeper into cryptocurrencies and blockchain could be alluring for Mr. Dorsey, who in his last few years as a social media chief executive spent increasing amounts of time defending Twitter\\u2019s role in disseminating misinformation, testifying in front of politicians and receiving frequent criticism from former President Donald J. Trump, who was barred from Twitter shortly after the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\", \"Mr. Dorsey did not reference cryptocurrencies or the blockchain in a brief quote in the news release about his company\\u2019s name change, saying only that despite the new name, \\u201cour purpose of economic empowerment remains the same. No matter how we grow or change, we will continue to build tools to help increase access to the economy.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"bf2dee3d52fc11ecb6b4e9b7af2bac97"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bf2dee3d52fc11ecb6b4e9b7af2bac97"}},
