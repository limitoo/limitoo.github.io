The coffered ceilings, the overwrought moldings, the decorative columns, the divided-light windows, the antiques \\u2014 it all suddenly seemed old.\", \"They also wanted to correct annoyances they had put up with for years, including the kitchen, which was weirdly cramped considering the size of the house \\u2014 and hardly ideal for Mr. Rosenberg, who loves few things more than cooking elaborate meals for guests.\", \"\\u201cThe kitchen was completely devoid of windows,\\u201d he said, \\u201cso it had no natural light.\\u201d\", \"Seeking a new vision for the house, they turned to Allen Saunders, a Miami-based interior designer who had conceived a clean-lined, modern home for their son in nearby Boca Raton.\", \"Although the couple had specific ideas for what they wanted in the food-focused spaces \\u2014 an expanded kitchen, a large wine room, an Italian pizza oven in the backyard \\u2014 they gave Mr. Saunders only one directive for the rest of the house: \\u201cWe want to walk in and go, \\u2018Wow,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Rosenberg said. \\u201cWe literally said to Allen, \\u2018You\\u2019ve got carte blanche to do whatever you need to do.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Relishing the challenge, Mr. Saunders drew up plans for a down-to-the-studs gut renovation that changed the floor plan and gave the home an unapologetically modern interior with black, white and aubergine details, along with plenty of conversation-starting pieces.\", \"The design converted what had been a five-bedroom house into a three-bedroom \\u2014 a primary suite, a guest bedroom and a bunk room for the couple\\u2019s grandchildren \\u2014 with a gym, a home theater and plenty of space for entertaining.\", \"Just inside the front entrance is a living room centered around an enormous chandelier with 55 purply handblown glass bubbles from Cameron Design House. \\u201cThat\\u2019s supposed to be a \\u2018wow\\u2019 feature,\\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \\u201cJeff collects wine, so we played with that idea, with the coloration and planning it almost like grapes.\\u201d\", \"The living room is open to the dining area, where Mr. Saunders installed two custom high-gloss lacquer dining tables, end to end, for both intimate family dinners and larger gatherings. \\u201cWe felt it would be strange to have four people sitting at a gigantic table,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo we broke the table into two: one that can easily sit eight or nine people, and one that sits four or five people.\\u201d\", \"Above the tables, a light installation of cast-glass droplets from Ochre is similarly divided into two sections that can be controlled individually to illuminate a single area or the entire expanse.\", \"For Mr. Rosenberg\\u2019s showpiece kitchen, Mr. Saunders designed a space with two islands: a hardworking one, with black-granite and butcher-block counters, for food preparation; and a sleeker, 10-foot unit with curved ends, bronze-finished metal doors and a Calacatta Viola marble top, for serving. Three shiplap-paneled doors conceal the refrigerator, freezer and entrance to the pantry.\", \"In the primary suite, Mr. Saunders added more aubergine details, including an upholstered headboard that stretches nearly to the ceiling, high-gloss lacquered doors in the bathroom and slabs of Lilac marble that have subtle hints of violet.\", \"After spending roughly two years on the new interior, the Rosenbergs had Mr. Saunders transform the outdoor space behind the house, as well. There, he replaced the round pool with a rectangular one integrated into a new terrace and built a wall of green- and bronze-glazed tiles that provides privacy from neighbors while amplifying reflections off the water.\", \"\\u201cI used the pool as a reflecting pond,\\u201d Mr. Saunders said. \\u201cAnd that wall became a moving piece of art.\\u201d\", \"After about nine months of additional construction outdoors, the project was finally completed last year, at a cost of about $2.5 million.\", \"The couple are \\u201ctotally thrilled\\u201d with the house, said Ms. Rosenberg, 72, sounding slightly in awe of how different it looks today. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t believe it.\\u201d\", \"The end result was worth it, Mr. Rosenberg added, even if it took longer than they expected.\", \"\\u201cIf you had asked me while we were going through the construction process, and we had to live in a rental, we might have had second thoughts about what we were doing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut everybody who goes through a renovation, or a knockdown and a rebuild, goes through that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"45628dd446c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"45628dd446c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
