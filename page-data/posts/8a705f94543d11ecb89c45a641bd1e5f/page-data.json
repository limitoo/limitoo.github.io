With Covid-19 cases surging, the couple could not imagine squeezing 40 guests into a one-bedroom apartment in Flatbush, Brooklyn. But this year, with the city reopened amid high vaccination rates, they are ready to revive the tradition, just on a smaller scale.\", \"They whittled the invite list to 15, and their save-the-date email read more like a Covid protocol explainer than a party announcement, asking guests if they\\u2019d be comfortable coming to the intimate gathering, where adults would be vaccinated and windows would be open.\", \"Everyone seemed ready to celebrate. \\u201cI love getting together with friends for the holidays,\\u201d said Mr. Wilcox, 42, a New York City tour guide. \\u201cI\\u2019m a very big Christmas person. It made me very sad not to do it last year. I\\u2019m very excited to go back to it and dip our toes back into the water.\\u201d\", \"If the 2020 holiday season was the year to cancel everything, 2021 is about figuring out how to get our groove back. Weddings and bar mitzvahs have been back on for months, and families are gathering to celebrate the holidays with grandparents, aunts and uncles. But the smaller social events with friends \\u2014 the friendsgivings, cocktail parties and New Year\\u2019s Eve bashes \\u2014 have been slower out of the gate, as such gatherings often fall lower on the list of social priorities.\", \"Add to the equation the recent rise in cases and a potentially troubling new variant, and some hosts and guests might pause before crowding into a friend\\u2019s apartment for eggnog and canap\\u00e9s. Event planners and caterers say that so far, the parties have been scaled back and the ones that are happening are organized on the fly, with little advance notice.\", \"\\u201cPeople want to go back to living, they want to learn how to live with this thing,\\u201d said Seri Kertzner, the owner of Little Miss Party in Manhattan, who encourages her clients to keep their gatherings small and, weather permitting, to hold them outdoors. \\u201cWe do also need to learn to live with it without being too alarming.\\u201d\", \"And so, there are new rules for a gracious host to learn amid a pandemic. Making guests feel comfortable is no longer just about nameplates and signature cocktails. It\\u2019s also about hand sanitizer, seat spacing and vaccination protocols.\", \"People have different comfort levels when it comes to Covid. So be direct and clear in your invitation about yours.\", \"\\u201cThe best host is the one who provides the most information,\\u201d said Mary Giuliani, a caterer in Manhattan. \\u201cThe more information the better.\\u201d\", \"She added: \\u201cWe are all re-entering at different phases. I find it\\u2019s really helpful to really lay out what you\\u2019re going to get.\\u201d\", \"If the party is indoors, will the windows be open? If so, remind guests to bring a sweater. If the event will be maskless, let guests know before they arrive. Lay out your vaccination rules, too. If you plan to restrict the invite list to the fully vaccinated, tell guests, and explain how you will enforce the policy. Will it be an honor system or will you be checking vaccine cards at the door?\", \"Many hosts of larger events have required guests to take a PCR or rapid Covid test before the party, and to bring their results with them. You could set the same rules for a smaller gathering, or simply suggest pre-party testing, particularly if some of your guests are at higher risk for serious illness. \\u201cYou can just say to people, \\u2018Right before, let\\u2019s all get tested so we can feel at ease, comfortable and able to just hang out with each other,\\u2019\\u201d said Amanda Hudes, an event and wedding planner in New Jersey.\", \"You could even hire a private company to test guests at the door. The cost will depend on the company you hire and the type of testing you choose. A company like A2Z Diagnostics in Eatontown, N.J., which provides rapid on-site testing and bills insurance companies, charges $75 per hour per staff member. According to its director of business development, Jason Gross, a typical at-home party would require one or two staff members for about one or two hours.\", \"For people seeking more comprehensive options, companies like Concierge Covid Testing, based in Boston, offer on-site PCR tests and rapid tests throughout the Northeast and other parts of the country. Concierge bills customers directly: $55 to $125 for rapid tests, which are ready in 10 to 15 minutes; and $125 to $225 per PCR tests, with results in less than an hour.\", \"Create an environment that feels spacious so guests can spread out. If you have outdoor space, make it accessible, even if the party is largely indoors. Set up a fire pit outside or outdoor heaters, and make seating available so people can get fresh air. If you\\u2019re planning a seated dinner indoors, don\\u2019t overcrowd the tables; and group people based on their households or with their closest friends, rather than mixing them up.\", \"Create nooks in the space where people could comfortably stand off by themselves or with one other person without feeling like they\\u2019re hiding.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a good idea to have chairs separated a bit and to have sanitizers out and some windows open,\\u201d Ms. Hudes said. \\u201cWhatever is going to keep the air flowing and people feeling really good and comfortable with each other \\u2014 to just be able to have fun again.\\u201d\", \"If you decide to host a winter event that is entirely (or mostly) outdoors, include an activity, like s\\u2019mores for the fire pit. Ms. Hudes planned an event recently with a temporary ice skating rink set up in the backyard.\", \"As tempting as a charcuterie board might be, it\\u2019s wise to avoid shared platters. Instead, offer each guest an individual plate or box of appetizers. A personalized box \\u201cis adorable,\\u201d Ms. Kertzner said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s got crackers, cheese, salami \\u2014 whatever you want to put in it. It\\u2019s tied up with a cute bow.\\u201d\", \"Rather than serve mixed drinks, offer individual cans of beer, wine or hard seltzer. With a wide enough selection, guests will be happy \\u2014 and you\\u2019ll have fewer glasses to wash at the end of the night.\", \"Put out bottles of hand sanitizer to make guests feel at ease. Leave some paper towels in the bathrooms for them to dry their hands after washing. And even if you have a mask-free event, set out a basket of disposable ones, in case someone feels anxious during the night. \\u201cKeep it light,\\u201d Ms. Kertzner said. \\u201cIf you end up wanting a mask, here\\u2019s a mask.\\u201d\", \"And with that, you get to have your party.\"]","href_hash":"8a705f94543d11ecb89c45a641bd1e5f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8a705f94543d11ecb89c45a641bd1e5f"}},
