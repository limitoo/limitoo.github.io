She had only just formed a two-party minority government with the Green Party. But after their budget was rejected in favor of one proposed by the opposition, which included the far-right Sweden Democrats party, the Green Party the quit the coalition out of frustration, leaving Ms. Andersson\\u2019s center-left party without a partner.\", \"\\u201cAccording to constitutional practice, a coalition government should resign if one party leaves the government,\\u201d Ms. Andersson said in a statement shared on her Facebook page. \\u201cFor me, it is about respect, but I also do not want to lead a government where there may be grounds to question its legitimacy.\\u201d She added that she had met with the speaker and asked to be dismissed from the her new position.\", \"Ms. Andersson\\u2019s resignation plunged Sweden into political uncertainty. The country\\u2019s political landscape was already frayed by fragile coalition governments, and a vote of no confidence in June against the former prime minister, Stefan Lofven. Ms. Andersson later succeeded Mr. Lofven as leader of the Social Democrats.\", \"Sweden, at one point, accepted more refugees per capita than any other European nation. But its progressive image has gradually been eroded by far-right populist sentiment that has taken hold, led by the Sweden Democrats party. The political spectrum has shifted to the right with increasing anti-immigrant and anti-European voices.\", \"Per Bolund, a Green Party spokesman, said his faction left the government in frustration because Parliament had approved a state budget negotiated by the opposition, which included a right-wing extremist party.\", \"Until a new government is elected, the current one will remain on in the interim. Ms. Andersson, who served as Sweden\\u2019s finance minister since 2014, has said she is still ready to serve as prime minister, but only in a one-party government.\"]","href_hash":"e821c2944dfe11ec9e2dcd186261a3d9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e821c2944dfe11ec9e2dcd186261a3d9"}},
