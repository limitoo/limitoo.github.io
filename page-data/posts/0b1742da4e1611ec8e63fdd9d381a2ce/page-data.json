About 2.3 million people passed through Transportation Safety Administration checkpoints on Wednesday, more travelers than on any other day during the pandemic.\", \"This figure was more than twice as many travelers as the Wednesday before Thanksgiving last year. This year\\u2019s total was about 88 percent of the travelers that flew on that same Wednesday in 2019. \", \"Social media was abuzz with nearly equal complaints about the longest airport lines people had experienced in years and surprise that lines were so short, reinforcing the idea pandemic unpredictability persists.\", \"Among those travelers sharing a sense of excitement about being able to visit family this Thanksgiving, was Katie Thurston of San Diego, known to some as the Bachelorette from Season 17 of that reality show.\", \"\\u201cTo go back to something that feels normal makes me feel so emotional,\\u201d she said in a telephone interview, after tweeting about her tearful reaction to landing in Seattle to visit her mother and sister and meet her baby niece for the first time.\", \"Hundreds of airport food service workers picketed on Wednesday at San Francisco International Airport over a dispute involving health care.

Still, the day seemed unlikely to surpass prepandemic travel figures overall given how extraordinary that weekend was two years ago. More people flew on the Sunday after Thanksgiving in 2019 \\u2014 according to T.S.A. checkpoint data \\u2014 than ever before in the agency\\u2019s 20-year history.\", \"And travelers are unlikely to face weather delays as they try to get home.\", \"\\u201cSunday is pretty quiet across much of the country,\\u201d said Lara Pagano, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service.\", \"Still, Becky Esquivel, a T.S.A. officer at the McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, urged people to arrive at least two hours before boarding their return flights just to be safe.\"]","href_hash":"0b1742da4e1611ec8e63fdd9d381a2ce"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0b1742da4e1611ec8e63fdd9d381a2ce"}},
