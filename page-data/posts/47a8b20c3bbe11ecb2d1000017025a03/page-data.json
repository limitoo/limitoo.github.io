Momentous events occur, and sometimes we\\u2019re caught up in them, but we are \\u2014 simultaneously, inescapably \\u2014 the main characters in our own stories. Sarah Winman\\u2019s sweeping \\u201cStill Life\\u201d is a parade of small stories, intimate connections and complex characters whose lives illuminate the tedium and cataclysms of the 20th century.\", \"Ulysses Temper is the modest, searching, wandering protagonist. (We\\u2019re told early that he\\u2019s named after a winning greyhound, but sometimes a cigar is not just a cigar.) We meet him as a young soldier in Italy in 1944; almost immediately he crosses paths with Evelyn Skinner, a 64-year-old lover of life and an enthusiastic art historian. She imparts life-changing wisdom about love and art and the city of Florence. Their paths diverge, and he takes her words with him back to London, where he resumes working at a pub. Soon enough, Ulysses and his makeshift family \\u2014 his ex-wife\\u2019s young daughter, Alys; his friend Cress; and a talking parrot named Claude \\u2014 move to Italy, where Ulysses has inherited a large apartment that they convert into a thriving pensione. Cress, who was able to communicate with trees in London, can also communicate with trees in Italy.\", \"It\\u2019s hard to encompass all that happens in this whopper of a book, partly because it spans four decades (and more than 450 pages), but even more so because much of it is just the stuff of life, suffused with copious dialogue so casual and idiomatic that it almost subverts its own demand for attention. Ulysses\\u2019 wife, Peg, falls in love with another soldier; she gets pregnant. Ulysses continues to love Peg and eventually raises the child on his own, since Peg is not fit for motherhood. One character finds love in his golden years. Another finds love early, and nothing else compares. During the war, Ulysses saved a life in Florence. Some years later, he is repaid for his kindness.\", \"What holds these characters together is the love of a chosen family and the role of art in maintaining their commitments to one another. Much of the story takes place in Florence, and one particular capital-H Historical moment is the 1966 flood of the Arno, during which millions of books and works of art were destroyed, and countless livelihoods were obliterated \\u2014 each, Winman reminds us, meaningless without the other.\", \"The novel\\u2019s articulation of faith is spoken by Evelyn, who rhapsodizes in the early pages, \\u201cBeautiful art opens our eyes to the beauty of the world, Ulysses. It repositions our sight and judgment.\\u201d This is a theme that runs through the novel, and it\\u2019s a bold authorial move, insisting upon the transformative power of aesthetics. Winman makes the case over and over again that beauty is truth, truth beauty, and of course it raises the reader\\u2019s expectations. If the book itself isn\\u2019t transcendent, the scaffolding will not hold.\", \"But the scaffolding, for the most part, does hold (although I could have done without the talking parrot, who seems to have flown in from another story). The real magic of \\u201cStill Life\\u201d is the elevation of the ordinary, the unabashed consecration of human experiences.\", \"Early in the novel, after Ulysses\\u2019 wife asks for a divorce, and then sleeps with him, he ruminates on the scope of his life: \\u201cSomewhere between an atom and a star was this.\\u201d He orders a meal: \\u201cHe asked her what the specials were, and she moved close to his ear. Tortellini in brodo, she purred. It was as erotic a moment as he\\u2019d had in years. He felt giddy and stumbled against the chair.\\u201d These are humans in orbit, connected by the staying power of heartbreak and kindness. And here is Winman describing an ordinary Italian summer day: \\u201cGolden light edged around the dark gray clouds and Cress used the phrase \\u2018unconscionable beauty\\u2019 in describing the garden. Cress was becoming poetry.\\u201d\", \"Sentence after sentence, character by character, \\u201cStill Life\\u201d becomes poetry.\"]","href_hash":"47a8b20c3bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"47a8b20c3bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}},
