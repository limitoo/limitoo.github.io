But Allen's fun ended not long after, as he was caught by Todd Astle off the bowling of Matt Henry for 12.\", \"Tom Blundell followed for a first-ball duck, trapped lbw by Henry to leave Wellington at 12/2 five balls into their innings.\", \"But a partnership worth 143-runs between Conway (74 not out) and Michael Bracewell (81) held the Firebirds' innings together, and saw Wellington post 190/3 from their 20 overs.\", \"Conway reached his half-century from 39 balls, hitting three boundaries and one six, while Bracewell took 40 balls with three boundaries and two sixes.\", \"Henry finished as the pick of the Canterbury bowlers, albeit with an expensive 2/47 from four overs, and was supported by 1/21 to Henry Shipley.\", \"In reply, Canterbury lost Blackcaps opener Tom Latham early at 37/1, clean bowled by Logan van Beek in the third over. Fellow international Daryl Mitchell came and went for 11, before he fell to Rachin Ravindra, caught by Conway at 65/2.\", \"Despite the fall of wickets, Kings opener Chad Bowes batted on to score a half-century, coming in 38 balls with six fours and one six.\", \"But at 93/2 in the 12th over, and with the target less than 100 runs away, Bowes fell to legspinner Peter Younghusband, caught by van Beek for 51. And when Younghusband had Kings captain Cole McConchie for a second ball duck in the same over, Canterbury's hopes were teetering at 93/4.\", \"In a stunning counter-attack, Carter and Fletcher added a 50-run partnership for the fifth wicket in just 26 balls, coming as Canterbury still needed 51 from the final four overs.\", \"A 16-run over from Jimmy Neesham gave Canterbury hope, as Fletcher passed his half-century in 21 balls - with 38 of his runs coming in boundaries, leaving the Kings needing nine runs from the final over, bowled by Younghusband.\", \"And after three runs from the first two balls, Carter sent Younghusband over midwicket for one final six to seal Canterbury's victory.\", \"The Kings will hope to lift New Zealand's domestic Twenty20 title for the first time since 2005/06 - coming under their old moniker of Canterbury Wizards.\", \"Wellington Firebirds 190/3 (Bracewell 81, Conway 74 not out; Henry 2/47)\", \"Canterbury Kings 191/4 (Fletcher 63 not out, Bowes 51; Younghusband 2/20)\", \"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"936077d67f1911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"936077d67f1911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
