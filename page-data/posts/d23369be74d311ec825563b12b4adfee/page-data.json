After winning her 32nd straight game on Thursday night, she is now tied for third place with James Holzahuer for the number of consecutive games won.\\u00a0\", \"Schneider took home the win with $32,800 on Thursday night. She was far ahead of her competition for most of the game, especially after finding \\u2014 and correctly answering \\u2014 all three of the Daily Double questions. She had $28,800 going into Final Jeopardy, with her second-place competitor at only $11,200. A correct answer about \\\"The words of Victor Hugo\\\" gave her an additional $4,000.\\u00a0\", \"The first transgender \\\"Jeopardy!\\\" contestant to qualify for the Tournament of Champions, Schneider has captivated audiences with her gameplay. Since her first game on November 17, she has won $1,101,600 and is the highest earning female contestant in \\\"Jeopardy!\\\" history.\\u00a0\", \"But for months, she had not yet reached the records of Holzhauer, Matt Amodio or Ken Jennings, who made up the top three for consecutive games won and for total regular-season winnings.\\u00a0\", \"She is $417,001 away from overtaking Matt Amodio's third-place spot for highest regular season play winnings, and only six games away from tying Ammodio's second-place streak of 38 games.

While it's gratifying to know that people didn't necessarily know I was trans until they read about it, I do want people to know that aspect of me. I think being trans is really cool!\\\"\", \"Schneider's next game will air on Friday night.
