Incarnated in gently bulbous, digitally smooth form, our hero, Greg Heffley (voiced by Brady Noon), runs through a good-natured medley of misadventures over 56 episodic minutes.\", \"Greg enjoys the companionship of his cylindrical buddy, Rowley (Ethan William Childress), but is driven by an abject fear of ostracism. Together they weather the dread of putting a foot wrong under the unfamiliar rules of middle school, whether that means saying \\u201cplay\\u201d when you mean \\u201chang out\\u201d or touching a fetid piece of cheese in the playground (a cherished conceit in the series). But the truest worry that Kinney\\u2019s characters explore is how friends survive transitions, and clash (as they do over being the cartoonist for the school paper).\", \"Greg \\u2014 a stick-figure with Jughead-esque askew smile and a Charlie Brown wisp of hair \\u2014 can be weak-willed and secretly nasty, especially toward Rowley. But the movie\\u2019s tone remains wholesome, unless you count the teenage bullies. These uncool degenerates are prone to reckless driving and, oddly, listening to Judas Priest\\u2019s 1980 hit \\u201cBreaking the Law.\\u201d Greg\\u2019s teen sib is a pill, too, especially next to his sage mom, antsy dad and supercute moppet kid-brother.\", \"The movie, directed by Swinton O. Scott III, plays like an extended series pilot, built out of largely interchangeable episodes. But its vacuum-packed, impersonal animation does bear one benefit: no live child actors onscreen who can age out of their roles.\"]","href_hash":"6cde2db0541211eca9d999f4b72daefc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6cde2db0541211eca9d999f4b72daefc"}},
