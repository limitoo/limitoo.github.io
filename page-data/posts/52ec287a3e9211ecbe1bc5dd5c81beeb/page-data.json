Their scores tell lawmakers and the public what legislation will cost. They\\u2019re also a required part of the special budget process Democrats are using to pass their bill through the Senate without needing to overcome a legislative filibuster.\", \"In the case of the Build Back Better Act \\u2014 the formal name of the social spending plan \\u2014\\u00a0the budget office\\u2019s staff must consider a 2,000-page bill with effects throughout the economy. The bill changes tax policy; shifts the health care system; accelerates the nation\\u2019s response to climate change; and establishes new programs for subsidized child care and paid leave, to name a few of its elements. Developing detailed estimates for any of those provisions would be a big job. The budget office tries to figure out how they interact together.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m sure the analysts at C.B.O are working 24-7 now,\\u201d said Doug Elmendorf, who was the office\\u2019s director from 2009 to 2015, when it scored the Dodd-Frank financial reform, the economic stimulus bill and the Affordable Care Act in rapid succession. \\u201cBut their responsibility is to not make up some number and write it down, but to produce a real estimate.\\u201d\", \"Negotiations on the package have been continuing \\u2014 with final legislative details changed as late as Thursday night. Former budget office directors said such small-seeming changes can often lead to major revisions in estimates.\", \"\\u201cThese things pop up, and you\\u2019d think it\\u2019s just going to be a day or two of work,\\u201d said Keith Hall, who ran the budget office from 2015 to 2019, and is now a professor of the practice at Georgetown University. \\u201cAnd, no. It\\u2019s weeks and weeks of work.\\u201d\", \"The budget office has been working alongside Congress on the legislation for months, considering various proposals and advising congressional committees on how various policy tweaks might influence the costs of different provisions. That might have led lawmakers to think a final score was just a few clicks away. But the budget office dashed those hopes Friday: According to aides, its staff told lawmakers it would not have a full estimate for the bill for a few weeks.\", \"\\u201cSeriously, I think it\\u2019s more likely I will get calls from constituents asking what the C.B.O. is rather than asking for a C.B.O. score,\\u201d said Representative Mark Pocan, Democrat of Wisconsin, on Twitter. \\u201cLet\\u2019s go.\\u201d\", \"Budget analysts have already assessed the costs of the bipartisan infrastructure bill, another piece of legislation that had been scheduled for a Friday vote. That bill, which the moderate Democrats support, is estimated to increase the deficit by $256 billion over the next decade.\", \"At the time, both Senate Democrats and Republicans were quick to point to other estimates and data points that provided alternate summaries of how the bill was paid for. (\\u201cThey\\u2019re kind of crazy anyway, right?\\u201d Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, said of the C.B.O.)\", \"The demand for a score on the social spending bill caused Democrats to delay the planned Friday vote on both measures. Because Republicans are unanimously opposed to the bill, Democrats can afford to lose only three votes in the House. And Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a key centrist in the evenly divided Senate, has said he will not vote for the bill if it does not pass certain fiscal tests.\", \"As frustrations spilled over, some Democrats warned that it was a sign that their broader agenda was in jeopardy.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s obvious where this is headed,\\u201d grumbled Mike Casca, a spokesman for Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the chairman of the Budget Committee, on Twitter. \\u201cHouse mods are going to use the C.B.O. score \\u2014 no matter what it says \\u2014 to vote against the B.B.B.\\u201d\", \"The Build Back Better measure presents particular challenges. In addition to its sheer magnitude and ever-changing details, it aims to establish several brand-new federal programs, such as paid leave and child care subsidies. The office has less experience to draw upon when considering such policies than it does in assessing more familiar changes to the funding formulas for existing programs.\", \"The constant negotiations can make that process even more difficult. In addition to its public, official scores, the office provides confidential advice to committees and leadership in Congress. In recent months, its analysts have been focused on assessing many different versions of policies. Those requests have been numerous and time-consuming for the office\\u2019s economists. \", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s like monitoring a kindergarten class during arts and crafts,\\u201d said Zach Moller, the director of economic policy at the centrist think tank Third Way, and a former Senate Budget Committee aide. \\u201cAll of the sudden, somebody spills the paste, and you\\u2019ve got to go clean that up. And while you turn your back, somebody is tugging someone else\\u2019s hair. It\\u2019s so much more complicated being the adult in the room with something like this.\\u201d\", \"Budget office economists often must exercise judgment about questions that can be challenging to predict. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who was the C.B.O. director from 2003 to 2005, recalled his efforts to calculate the expected costs of a terrorism insurance program in the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks. The work involved estimating the frequency and magnitude of terrorist attacks in coming years.\", \"\\u201cYou don\\u2019t want to know just how many times I just rolled dice on that one,\\u201d he said. But Mr. Holtz-Eakin, now the president of the American Action Forum, emphasized that the budget office would not serve Congress well if it cut corners or guessed about policies where it could conduct rigorous estimates.\", \"Sometimes, the office works hard to understand the effects of a brand-new policy, and realizes later it has erred. During the debate over the Affordable Care Act, the office believed that the law\\u2019s individual mandate to obtain health insurance would have a major effect on the number of Americans who were covered under the law. In 2018, it acknowledged that years of experience had shown the provision\\u2019s impact had been substantially smaller.\", \"Health care changes are often particularly slow to calculate. The budget office has constructed a computer model that evaluates the effects of public policy on health care insurance rates and spending. That model\\u2019s sophistication is valuable, but its heft means the program often takes a day to run, before analysts spend weeks assessing its output and interpreting the results, Mr. Hall said. He recalls explaining this process to frustrated Republican lawmakers during their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act in 2017.\", \"The final round of changes to the social spending package concerned price regulation for prescription drugs, a policy that could ripple through cost estimates for numerous related health programs.\", \"When Republicans were trying to partly repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017, the budget office faced criticisms for estimates that were politically damaging. But several C.B.O. directors said congressional angst is typically about the perceived slowness of the C.B.O. process, not the fairness of its estimates.\", \"\\u201cI was regularly berated for not having estimates ready the instant that some legislative agreement was reached,\\u201d Mr. Elmendorf said.\", \"The budget office is often likened to a referee in a sporting event. While referees are generally seen as neutral \\u2014 and powerful \\u2014 they are not always beloved figures. And particularly consequential calls tend to generate displeasure.\", \"\\u201cThey get to be the umpire,\\u201d said Rodney Whitlock, a former health policy adviser for the Senate Finance Committee, who is now a vice president at McDermott+Consulting. \\u201cWhere\\u2019s the last ballgame of any kind you\\u2019ve been to where people cheer the refs?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"52ec287a3e9211ecbe1bc5dd5c81beeb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"52ec287a3e9211ecbe1bc5dd5c81beeb"}},
