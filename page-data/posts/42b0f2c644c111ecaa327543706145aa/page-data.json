She was 80.\", \"The cause was cancer, her daughter, Serena Larson, said.\", \"\\u201cJane did everything behind the scenes,\\u201d Chris Evert, who won 18 Grand Slam singles titles, said in an interview. \\u201cShe didn\\u2019t crave attention and quietly went about her work. Not a lot of women tennis players know what she did, because she was under the radar.\\u201d\", \"In 1989, Mrs. Brown Grimes, as managing director of the Women\\u2019s International Professional Tennis Council, which governed women\\u2019s tennis, headed talks that led to a change in title sponsorship of the women\\u2019s tour \\u2014 from Virginia Slims, a cigarette brand marketed to women, to Kraft General Foods. Both were owned by Philip Morris (now the Altria Group).\", \"Anti-tobacco activists, as well as some players, had for years demanded that women\\u2019s tennis move on from its tobacco sponsorship, the financial backbone of the tour since the early 1970s, to one that promoted a healthier lifestyle.\", \"\\u201cJane was a very strategic, intelligent leader, and she was clear that the council had to move away from tobacco,\\u201d said Anne Worcester, who was director of worldwide operations for the Virginia Slims series and succeeded Mrs. Brown Grimes as the council leader in 1991.\", \"Pam Shriver, who won 132 titles in her career, acknowledged in an interview that \\u201cthere were no apologies for Virginia Slims being a sponsor.\\u201d But, she added, \\u201cBy the time Jane was in a key position to make a change, she made it happen.\\u201d\", \"Jane Trowbridge Gillespie was born on Jan. 20, 1941, in Freeport, N.Y., on Long Island. Her father, Samuel Hazard Gillespie, was a litigator who served as the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York from 1959 to 1961.

She reveled in watching stars like Althea Gibson, Margaret Court, Tony Trabert and Maureen Connolly.\", \"\\u201cThey were my movie stars,\\u201d she told The News Journal of Wilmington, Del., in 2009. \\u201cThey were my idols.\\u201d\", \"She studied history at Wellesley College in Massachusetts and received a bachelor\\u2019s degree in 1962. After working as a fact checker for Life magazine and then for a documentary filmmaker, she joined the Manhattan office of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1977.\", \"Starting as an event planner, she became a fund-raiser before rising to executive director of the Hall of Fame in 1981, a post she held until 1986.
