Absolutely,\\u201d said Dr. Sean O\\u2019Leary, the vice chair of the academy\\u2019s infectious diseases committee. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s driving the increase in kids is there is an increase in cases overall.\\u201d\", \"While children under 18 make up about 22 percent of the U.S. population, the recent cases account for about a quarter of the country\\u2019s total caseload. Experts say that children now make up a greater percentage of overall cases after the vaccines were rolled out among adults.\", \"Though children are less likely to develop severe Covid illness than adults, they are still at risk, and can also spread the virus to adults. As of last month, about 8,300 American children ages 5 to 11 have been hospitalized with Covid and at least 172 have died, out of more than 3.2 million hospitalizations and 740,000 deaths overall, according to the C.D.C.\", \"Experts have warned that children should be vaccinated to protect against possible long-Covid symptoms, Multi-system Inflammatory Syndrome and hospitalization. Dr. O\\u2019Leary said that he was especially concerned about case increases in children during the holiday season.\", \"Overall, cases are on the upswing, especially in the Upper Midwest and Northeast. The country is recording more than 90,000 cases per day, and while that\\u2019s well below the summer surge or even the level reached before Thanksgiving last year, more than 30 states are seeing sustained upticks and hospitalizations are climbing in the hardest-hit areas.\", \"Federal medical teams have been dispatched to Minnesota to help at overwhelmed hospitals. Michigan is enduring its worst case surge yet, with daily caseloads doubling since the start of November. Even with high vaccination rates, states in New England \\u2014 including Vermont, Maine and New Hampshire \\u2014 are trying to contain major outbreaks.\", \"It\\u2019s a complicated moment. While the vaccines continue to offer protection against the worst outcomes, their effectiveness against infection is waning for many, just as cases are on the rise across the country. Plenty of people who hit the road this year will be unvaccinated, unmasked and largely unworried about Covid-19.\", \"Still, health officials have largely stopped telling people to avoid Thanksgiving gatherings, as they did last year, and millions of Americans are forging ahead with holiday plans. Experts largely agree that, with the right precautions, it\\u2019s possible for vaccinated people to host a relatively safe, though not fully risk-free, gathering.\", \"Millions more Americans are expected to take to the skies this Thanksgiving compared to last year. Many have been emboldened by vaccinations and are reluctant to spend another holiday alone. The T.S.A. said it expected to screen about 20 million passengers at airports in the 10 days that began Friday, a number approaching prepandemic levels.\", \"While the industry is projecting optimism about easy traveling, the influx of passengers has injected an element of uncertainty into an already fragile system.\", \"Major airlines have struggled to ramp up after sweeping layoffs at the beginning of the pandemic, and flight crews have had to contend with overwork, as well as disruptive and belligerent passengers. The F.A.A. has so far begun investigations into 991 episodes involving passenger misbehavior in 2021. That\\u2019s more than in the last seven years combined.\", \"Airlines including Southwest and American have also experienced recent troubles that rippled for days \\u2014 stymieing travel plans for thousands of passengers \\u2014 as the carriers struggled to get pilots and flight attendants in place for delayed and rescheduled flights, a task complicated by thin staffing.\", \"Some lawmakers warned that a Monday vaccination deadline for all federal employees could disrupt T.S.A. staffing at airports, resulting in long lines at security checkpoints, but the agency said those concerns were unfounded. Even so, AAA, the travel services organization, recommended that during the Thanksgiving travel wave passengers arrive two hours ahead of departure for domestic flights and three hours ahead for international destinations.\", \"For those of you taking a flight this holiday, travel industry officials say to be prepared for crowded flights, inclement weather that could delay trips, and elevated costs of tickets if you have to make last-minute changes to plans. \", \"With the holidays on the horizon, it can often be difficult to find time to exercise \\u2014 let alone reach our fitness goals. The coronavirus pandemic has further complicated our fitness routines by shuttering yoga studios and gyms, many of which have not reopened, not to mention finding the motivation to get moving. But that\\u2019s where we hope you\\u2019ll come in.\", \"We\\u2019re asking readers for the workout routines that they\\u2019ve found work for them, as well as the pandemic fitness hacks that have delivered results.
