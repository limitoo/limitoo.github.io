They point to Democrats suffering a 15-point drop with white women in the 12 months between the 2020 presidential election and the Virginia's governor's race.\", \"Democrats who work to turn out Black voters, however, argue that Republicans have a narrow base, so their messaging that receives high marks can be more narrow, while Democrats have a much wider base and so must employ more complex concepts, such as cross-racial solidarity.\", \"These Democrats make the case that Black voters have long allowed the Democratic party to go broader with their messaging to attract white voters, but the frustration comes when campaigns are run this way and it doesn't result in specific positive change for Black voters.\", \"Voting rights, these Democrats insist, are about Black people, \\\"because they lose the most when voting rights are under attack.\\\"\", \"The issue of critical race theory, which argues that racism is embedded in the U.S. legal system and its policies, has also risen in importance in the minds of Democrats who saw how education became a mobilizing issue for frustrated voters in the Virginia governor's race.\", \"Paultre would like to see Democrats embrace messaging that shows they will not stand idly by as Republicans use Black voters and issues they care about as a scare tactic to get white voters out. But they acknowledged a Catch 22: While issues of race deeply matter to Democratic voters, talking about them is exactly what Republicans want.\", \"That is why he and others embrace a populist economic message that doesn't shy away from race.\", \"\\\"You can't do either or, you have to do both,\\\" he said.\", \"Paultre said such messaging is about correctly identifying \\\"who is doing you wrong and saying, 'I'm going to go and fight on your behalf.'\\\"\", \"While fighting on behalf of voters is going to vary by state and city, the key delivery system for that message is populism, Paultre argued.\", \"\\\"Donald Trump was a populist. Who you blame is the big difference,\\\" he said. \\\"Trump blamed immigrants, Reagan blamed the welfare state and Black people, and Obama blamed the banks.\\\"\", \"Way To Win, a progressive donor network that helped raise $110 million during the 2020 election, says looking at the three major post-Trump era elections, which include the Georgia Senate runoffs and California governor recall race, is more useful than focusing on Virginia alone.\", \"\\\"You have to give people clarity about what we're going to do,\\\" Way To Win co-founder Jenifer Fernandez Ancona said of the Georgia messaging, which included the effective \\\"money in your pocket and shots in arms.\\\"\", \"Democrats say the Party must emphasize its wins on COVID relief, infrastructure packages and lowering the unemployment rate, and move past the Trump-focused message that appeared to doom Terry McAuliffe in Virginia.\", \"\\\"Branding the GOP as the party of extremism is very different than just blaming Trump,\\\" Ancona said. She called Trump \\\"an invisible bogeyman we can't rely upon to turn out the voters we need to win,\\\" noting that Newsom did a better job of telling this story than McAuliffe did.\", \"Still, Ancona said a big lesson in Georgia was that Democrats can't ignore the issue of race, which she said the right weaponizes. The Georgia race featured now-Senator Raphael Warnock, a Black pastor, and the issues in the runoff were often listed as \\\"jobs, health, and justice.\\\"\", \"\\\"They talked about voting rights. Those issues are salient for the Biden coalitions,\\\" she said. \\\"Terry McAuliffe's campaign didn't address it until the very end. We can't ignore it. Race is on the table.\\\"\", \"California Representative Tony Cardenas said Democrats have a responsibility to remind Americans that they \\\"helped them get through the worst of times\\\" by lessening the danger of COVID and boosting the economy, but they need to avoid focusing on the \\\"sausage-making\\\" in politics.\", \"\\\"We need to do less talking about the process,\\\" he said. \\\"The average American could care less if we have to deal with cloture, House rules, Senate rules; they really don't care about that.\\\"\", \"\\\"We have to get over ourselves,\\\" Cardenas said. \\\"That's what we deal with in Washington, but we don't have to bore the American people with that.\\\"\", \"Where he became animated, however, is in discussing race and engagement with non-white voters through the lens of a Latino voter.\", \"\\\"With all due respect, we're stuck on stupid, hiring the same consultants over and over who don't have a good win-loss record,\\\" he said pointing to Latino consultants who could craft a culturally competent message in key markets like South Florida and South Texas with uniquely resonant messaging in each area.\", \"That strategy would be better, he argued, than the tired approach of TV ads aired \\\"in the last few weeks, throwing money away,\\\" rather than doing things like getting on Spanish-language radio.\", \"And part of the reset must be in donor relations.\", \"Still, the source acknowledged that donors write the checks, and in some states Democrats are outgunned 5-to-1 or 6-to-1 by Republican financiers.\", \"Democratic donors, it seems, are in the driver's seat, and they expect what they were promised.\", \"\\\"I don't want Donald Sussman's money going away,\\\" the source said. \\\"When Republicans pay for something they want to see results, and they got Donald Trump's tax bill. Democratic donors are saying we want what we paid for.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937876/black-voters-matter.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Voting rights activists participate in a demonstration at Lafayette Square August 4, 2021 in Washington, DC.
