The team had once again rebuilt its roster in pursuit of a championship, and James said he knew that forming chemistry would be a process, that nothing would come easily \\u2014 at least not right away. James illustrated his point by making an analogy.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going to be like peanut butter and jelly to start the season,\\u201d he said in September.\", \"James seemed to be carefully managing expectations rather than hyping them up after the Lakers acquired Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony and several other aging stars. The Lakers had the potential for boom or bust as one of the league\\u2019s most curious experiments.\", \"Sure enough, a quarter of the way through the season, they are not exactly making sandwiches.\", \"The latest obstacle for the Lakers surfaced on Tuesday when the team said that James had entered the N.B.A.\\u2019s coronavirus health and safety protocols, which apply to players who have tested positive or potentially been exposed to someone who has. The Lakers declined to comment when asked whether James had tested positive for the virus, but after the team defeated the Sacramento Kings on Tuesday night without James, the Lakers\\u2019 Anthony Davis made comments that could suggest that he had.\", \"\\u201cScary situation,\\u201d Davis told reporters. \\u201cHe\\u2019s said he\\u2019s good. I think he\\u2019s asymptomatic, which is a good sign. We want to make sure that he gets back. Health is most important. It\\u2019s bigger than basketball.\\u201d\", \"James, 36, who said before the season that he had been vaccinated against Covid-19, could be forced to sit out for at least 10 days unless he is able to return two negative tests 24 hours apart, according to league guidelines. The Lakers have a relatively light schedule over the next week and a half, which means that James could miss a total of four games if he is absent for the full 10 days.\", \"Typically, players who are vaccinated face less stringent requirements than unvaccinated players. After Thanksgiving, though, the N.B.A. implemented enhanced testing requirements even for vaccinated players, according to documents sent by league officials to each of the 30 teams. They did so with the expectation that the holiday would increase players\\u2019 potential exposure to the virus.\", \"The league, which has said that 97 percent of its players have been vaccinated, has also been urging eligible players to get booster shots as breakthrough cases create disruptions and additional health concerns. \", \"On Tuesday, Lakers Coach Frank Vogel said James\\u2019s health was the top priority.\", \"\\u201cWe just want the best for him right now,\\u201d Vogel said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s where our thoughts are. We have a next man up mind-set. It\\u2019s an 82-game season. You got to deal with guys being in and out of the lineup. We\\u2019ve been without him some already this season.\\u201d\", \"It has not been a seamless season for James, who, largely because of injuries, has missed more than half of the team\\u2019s games, or for Los Angeles, which improved its middle-of-the-pack record to 12-11 with Tuesday\\u2019s 117-92 win over Sacramento.\", \"One of the big questions for the Lakers entering the season was their durability, and it was unavoidable because the Lakers are, by average age, the oldest team in the league.\", \"At the center of it all is James, who will turn 37 on Dec. 30. For so many years, he operated as a seemingly indestructible force. Seldom injured, he almost never missed games \\u2014 until he joined the Lakers in 2018. He has since labored with injuries, and a sprained ankle hindered him as the Phoenix Suns bounced the Lakers from the first round of last season\\u2019s playoffs.\", \"This season, James has been sidelined for 10 games because of ankle and abdominal injuries, and he also missed a game because of a suspension. When active, he has been solid and occasionally brilliant, averaging 25.8 points while shooting 48.4 percent from the field, numbers that are not far off his career averages. His production is remarkable considering he is the fourth-oldest player in the league.\", \"There is the mileage, too: all those career minutes, all those deep playoff runs. Now, he is absent again as the new-look Lakers continue to search for their footing in a competitive conference.\", \"Davis has not played his best. And Vogel has rarely had a full roster at his disposal. The Lakers\\u2019 lopsided victory over the Kings was their first double-digit win since Halloween. But there is some cause for optimism. After a brutal start to his first season with the Lakers, Westbrook has been more consistent.\", \"\\u201cI feel like we\\u2019re further along with our cohesiveness now than we were the first time he went out with his ab strain,\\u201d Vogel said, referring to James\\u2019s extended absence last month.\", \"For his part, James has long viewed the regular season in increments, as a slow build toward the playoffs. He has said that he considers the first measuring stick of a team\\u2019s progress to come around Christmas Day, and that he likes to guard against getting too high or too low, especially when a team has so many new pieces.\", \"Without him for now, the Lakers have more immediate tests against the Clippers on Friday and the Boston Celtics on Tuesday \\u2014 another pair of opportunities for the rest of the roster to come together. The Lakers, with all their experience, are built for the postseason. But first, they need to get there in one piece.\"]","href_hash":"c3789d3c543911ec9363c5785187cdc3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c3789d3c543911ec9363c5785187cdc3"}},
