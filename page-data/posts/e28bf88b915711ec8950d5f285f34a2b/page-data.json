Some retailers have had to close while others are reducing their operating hours.\", \"Chief executive Greg Harford said very few customers are visiting the central city area near parliament, which includes some of Wellington's prime shopping.\", \"\\\"Things were bad before the protests, with the move to the red traffic light setting, but protests and the disruption associated with them are really just keeping customers away from town.
