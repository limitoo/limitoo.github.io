It found the 'nocebo effect' accounted for about 76 percent of common adverse reactions after the first dose and nearly 52 percent after the second dose.\", \"The study found these reactions most commonly included headaches, arm pain and fatigue and were produced by misattributing routine background symptoms, anxiety and expectations of reactions.\", \"The study urges that better public information about nocebo responses may reduce people's hesitancy towards the COVID vaccine and improve uptake, The Guardian reported.\", \"Director of the Immunisation Advisory Centre Nikki Turner said common side effects like sore arms and headaches are usual for most types of vaccines.\", \"\\\"Many people are aware from having other vaccines you commonly get sore arms, you get aches and pains, you can get headaches, some people get fevers, some people can feel really tired and some need to take a day off work... this is normal, standard stuff,\\\" Dr Turner told The AM Show.\", \"\\\"This vaccine has got more safety surveillance than any medical product, any food product, any other vaccine.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"c9d5edb678d711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c9d5edb678d711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
