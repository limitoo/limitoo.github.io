However, The Associated Press has speculated that SCOTUS could release a statement on Texas' ban on abortion after six weeks. There are now two cases against the law, which the justices reviewed on November 1. Given the unique fast-track that the judges granted Texas cases, there is a chance that a decision could be announced soon.\", \"Texas' ban prohibits abortion once any cardiac activity is detected in the fetus. This development often occurs six weeks into the pregnancy and often before most women know that they're pregnant. No exceptions for rape or incest were provided in the law.\", \"However, SCOTUS' cases center around a facet of the law that allows private citizens to sue clinics and doctors who perform abortions.
