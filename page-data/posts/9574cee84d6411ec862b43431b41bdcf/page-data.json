However, that piece of legislation \\\"didn't overcome their opinions that we have spent the last year infighting and careening from crisis to crisis,\\\" the report said.\", \"Among the report's conclusions were that voters \\\"believe the economy is bad\\\" and do not think the Democratic Party is offering solutions to nationwide problems, including economic issues like inflation.\", \"\\\"They aren't hearing us talk about the economy enough, and the things they are hearing about our agenda (people mentioned the child tax credit, paid leave, free college) don't have to do with getting people back to work or taking on the cost of goods,\\\" the report said.
