Two teams consisting of 22 people will arrive at Hennepin County Medical Center and St. Cloud Hospital next week. Both are experiencing staff shortages and an overflow of unvaccinated patients.\", \"\\\"Our best defense against this is the vaccine,\\\" Walz told reporters at a virtual press conference.\", \"Minnesota is currently the second-ranking state in the country in the number of booster shots administered, behind only Vermont.\", \"Health Commissioner Jan Malcolm also discussed the recent deployment, particularly the need for other emergency teams across the country.\", \"\\\"There's just been a tremendous demand for those teams nationwide,\\\" Malcolm said. \\\"At this point in time, there are very, very few teams available to be deployed across the whole nation, so the fact that Minnesota's getting two of them is great good news.\\\"\", \"The teams will consist of 10 nurses from the federal Public Health Service and 15 nursing assistants from the Minnesota National Guard. Private vendors will provide transitional care. A skilled-nursing facility will also serve as a \\\"hospital decompression\\\" site for patients who are still sick with COVID-19 but do not need severe treatment.\", \"\\\"I need Minnesotans to recognize, as we've been saying, this is a dangerous time,\\\" Walz added.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1934961/gov-walz.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Department of Defense will be assisting two Minnesota hospitals overwhelmed by COVID-19 patients.
