We were living really, really, simply at this stage and now we're probably a little bit more comfortable,\\\" Antoinette says.\", \"\\\"It's always a little bit fragile, but we really have built our lives in order to be super resilient to the coming and going of funds in the Hidden Films bank account.\\\"\", \"These days, things are a bit different.\", \"About of a third of their funding comes from YouTube ad revenue.

Being alternative to this destructive, industrial, capitalistic way that has taken over so much of the world.\", \"\\\"It's interesting for us as well, you know, it's been a learning journey. We've been going on these journeys over last few years filming with people and hearing their stories as a way to learn for ourselves and then share those learnings with people as well as like hey, there is an alternative to this.\", \"\\\"Here's what you can practically do on an individual level, on a community level without waiting for governments to do something about it.\\\"\", \"Ever felt like a documentary you've watched made you want to change your whole life?\", \"People who've watched Jordan and Antoinette's films have actually followed through.\", \"Feedback helps the couple stay motivated, Antoinette says.\", \"\\\"We get an amazing number of emails from people saying that they've made sometimes quite major lifestyle changes as a result of watching the films, which is really important to us as well because it motivates us to keep going, so it does feel like we're having an impact,\\\" she says.\", \"Some of the stories are pretty wild.\", \"For example, the couple recently visited Robert and Robyn Guyton, who live in Riverton, Southland.\", \"After a Happen Films documentary on the Guytons' permaculture food forest five years ago, people flew across the world to visit the property, Antoinette says - although she points out that's not an action they support due to the carbon footprint involved.\", \"\\\"Somebody helicoptered into the paddock next door and invited them to come and manage a food forest on an island in the Pacific.\\\"\", \"Another example: \\\"One of our film subjects had a guy from Deutsche Bank get in touch and say (the film) changed his life and said 'I've left my job, what should I do now?'\", \"\\\"I think our ultimate goal is to not have goals. That's been a process in itself - coming to that conclusion that we that we don't want to confine ourselves to that conventional model of setting goals and so on,\\\" Antoinette says.\", \"\\\"I think ultimately, what we want to do is be inspired and share inspiring stories and the way that we do that can evolve organically from here to eternity because I don't believe they'll ever be a shortage of people with inspiring stories to tell.\\\"\", \"\\\"This process that we have been on of wanting to simplify how we live, so living more simply, not just you know, to reduce costs and obviously environmental impact, but also just the personal, the value that you get from doing this,\\\" Antoinette says.\", \"The notion of being busy is ingrained in society today, and they've had to work hard not to look for constant growth, they say.\", \"\\\"We really want to stay being a team with our awesome two helpers who are just invaluable.\\\"\", \"When it's put to them that they're walking to the talk when it comes to their lifestyle, Jordan says they're doing the best they can.\", \"\\\"It's a journey that we're constantly evolving and improving on. There's so many things in our life that you know are compromises and anybody trying to live by their ethics is going to have compromises so we see ourselves as taking steps to living our values and living in a way that feels right for us.\", \"\\\"The next big step for that is the tiny house having a place of our own and then finding community, being on land, growing more food.\", \"\\\"We've incorporated so much of what we've learned over the last six years of making films because we really believe in it and we're not making films because they get lots of views.

A lot of the people that we film with, our people who are showing that living with less is creating much more for them in their life and they are thriving.\", \"\\\"As we go forward \\u2026 I'm not interested in technological solutions because I don't believe that's the right mentality to approach what we're facing.\", \"Jordan says they will always use technology - like solar panels on their tiny home - but the problem is \\\"the foregrounding of technology as the main answer to these problems\\\".\", \"\\\"The endless search for a solution to the problem that's created by technology and industrial civilisation in the first place is kind of never-ending cycle.\\\"\", \"We need to find a way to live that works in the modern context, they say.\", \"\\\"How do we do that while healing the planet as well?,\\\" Jordan asks.\", \"\\\"Not just doing less harm, but how do we actually regenerate? Because it's not just enough to live sustainably, we, you know, we can't just sustain things - we need to actually heal what damage that has been done.\\\"\", \"Antoinette says that involves healing both land and people.\", \"\\\"I think that that's become much more of a focus for us over the last few years. The more we're learning we're seeing that this isn't just putting permaculture practices into place.\", \"\\\"People ... tend to forget about people and how we're treating each other and how we are relating with each other and how we connect.\", \"\\\"The problems can feel so big at times is because they are all interconnected,\\\" Jordan says.\", \"\\\"That's why the solutions need to be interconnected and holistic.\\\"\", \"Jordan says if there's a takeaway from their films, they hope people will be \\\"inspired to find one thing that they're passionate about\\\".\", \"\\\"Start there and give that ago and then once you've incorporated that into your life and it's just part of what you do, then it's like OK, what can I do next?\", \"\\\"Then you can follow what you're excited about and in no time you'll be living quite differently.\", \"\\\"I think it's a journey and it's exciting and I hope people get that from seeing the stories that we share.\\\"\", \"Inspiring people take action is about \\\"finding a balance between the urgency and the reality of what can be done\\\", Antoinette says.\", \"And that action must be grass roots - not led by the government or those at the top - but individual and community action.\", \"\\\"You can be making contributions in all sorts of small ways, and if you feel empowered by that, if we all re-education ourselves to understand that we are incredibly powerful, then that to me is how we are going to reach that critical mass and see true change happening.\\\"\", \"Their latest feature is a 40-minute documentary about an enterprise called Common Unity.\", \"Located in Lower Hutt, it's having a huge impact on its community, Antoinette says.\", \"This is a documentary about an organisation which has developed a relationship with Kainga Ora and is working in the tenants' backyards to teach them to grow food.\", \"\\\"They turn their whole back yards into food gardens, from which they harvest what they need and then the rest goes back to the community kitchen where they're making 2000 meals a week that go out to schools.\\\"\", \"They also work with a local marae that has a pataka kai.\", \"\\\"The work that they're doing together is amazing. They've developed whole food gardens and an orchard and they've got weekly (food) boxes going out. They're just doing really, really important stuff.\", \"\\\"It's not just about the quality of the food. It's about where it's come from and how it's been grown. Who it's been grown by and the connection between the members of the community and those kids understanding where that food's coming from\\u2026 so many people are like that - we don't understand where our food comes from,\\\" Antoinette says.\", \"\\\"Common Unity has been very active about getting kids into the garden, teaching them to grow the food, but also, if the food that's coming to them at lunchtime is food that they know was grown up at Rimutaka Prison - sometimes by their dads - grown in their house, in the backyard sometimes of friends of theirs and the youth facility\\u2026 that's a whole different connection with your community.\\\"\", \"Jordan says the enterprise is empowering the community.\", \"\\\"It's showing people how to grow food. It's giving them the skills to do it themselves.\", \"\\\"There's a great quote from Julia, our main interviewee and the founder of Common Unity at the end of the film - she basically says the measure of success for Common Unity would be to dismantle the facility that they've created and it's just a part of the community - that they don't need to be there facilitating - it's just happening.\\\"\", \"That documentary - Together We Grow - is coming out in early February.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/135643/eight_col_Together_We_Grow_BtS_Julia_interview.JPG?1639466039\\\" alt=\\\"Interviewing Julia for Together We Grow.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nInterviewing Julia for Together We Grow. \\nPhoto: Happen Films\\n</div>\"]","href_hash":"9d64f0fc6ebd11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9d64f0fc6ebd11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
