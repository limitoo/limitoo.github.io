And no relationship seethes, across such a wide and consequential set of issues, with more tension and mistrust.\", \"The United States and China are profoundly at odds on how people and economies should be governed. The two powers jockey for influence beyond their own shores, compete in technology, and maneuver for military advantages on land, in outer space and in cyberspace. But they are also major trade and business partners, making their rivalry more complex than those of the Cold War, to which it is sometimes compared.\", \"That complexity will be in full play when President Biden holds a virtual summit with China\\u2019s top leader, Xi Jinping.\", \"Antony J. Blinken, the U.S. Secretary of State, has called managing the relationship with China \\u201cthe biggest geopolitical test of the 21st century.\\u201d Yet China has vexed American policymakers ever since Mao\\u2019s armies took control of the nation \\u2014 \\u201cliberated\\u201d it, in the Communist Party\\u2019s parlance \\u2014 in 1949.\", \"In the decades that followed, the party drove the economy to ruin. Then the government changed course, and China got much, much richer. Now, Mr. Xi, China\\u2019s leader since 2013, wants to restore the nation\\u2019s primacy in the global order.\", \"\\u201cThe East is rising,\\u201d Mr. Xi has said, \\u201cand the West is declining.\\u201d\", \"Here are the main fronts in the contest that is defining this era.\", \"The United States has used its naval and air might to enforce order across the Pacific region since the end of World War II. This is not a state of affairs that China will accept for the long term.\", \"As China has built up its military presence in the region, the Biden administration has sought to widen America\\u2019s alliances with Australia, Japan, India and other nations. Beijing regards such actions as dangerous provocations meant to secure American \\u201chegemony.\\u201d\", \"A major potential flash point is Taiwan, the self-governing, democratic island that the Communist Party regards as Chinese territory. Mr. Xi has vowed to achieve the \\u201cgreat rejuvenation of the Chinese nation,\\u201d a project that includes bringing Taiwan under Chinese control. China has flown more and more warplanes into the airspace near Taiwan, sending a reminder that it has never ruled out annexing the island by force.\", \"American presidents have long been vague about how forcefully the United States would come to Taiwan\\u2019s defense. This \\u201cstrategic ambiguity\\u201d is meant to avoid provoking Beijing and signal to the island\\u2019s leaders that they should not declare independence with the idea that America would have their back.\", \"Even so, the administrations of both Mr. Biden and former President Donald J. Trump have stepped up U.S. support for Taiwan. American warships have sailed through the Taiwan Strait. Small teams of troops have conducted training with the Taiwanese military.\", \"Asked in October whether the United States would protect Taiwan, Mr. Biden said bluntly: \\u201cYes, we have a commitment to do that.\\u201d\", \"The White House quickly said his remark did not represent a change in U.S. policy.\", \"The trade war started by the Trump administration is technically on pause. But the Biden team has continued protesting China\\u2019s economic policies that led Mr. Trump to begin imposing tariffs on Chinese goods, including Beijing\\u2019s extensive support for steel, solar cells, computer chips and other domestic industries.\", \"\\u201cThese policies have reinforced a zero-sum dynamic in the world economy,\\u201d Katherine Tai, the United States Trade Representative, said in October, adding that \\u201cChina\\u2019s growth and prosperity come at the expense of workers and economic opportunity here in the U.S.\\u201d\", \"The cycle of tariffs and counter-tariffs that began in 2018 showed how interconnected the two countries\\u2019 economies are \\u2014 and how vulnerable they remain if either side goes further to \\u201cdecouple\\u201d them.\", \"The tariff fight has prompted Mr. Xi to declare that China\\u2019s economy needs to be driven primarily by domestic demand and homegrown innovation and only secondarily by exports, in what he calls a \\u201cdual circulation\\u201d strategy.\", \"Beijing officials say this does not mean China is closing the door to foreign investment and foreign goods. But the climate of economic nationalism has already ignited new interest and investment in homegrown brands. Chinese consumers are increasingly intolerant of foreign companies that fail to toe the party\\u2019s line on Hong Kong, Tibet and other hot-button issues or are otherwise seen as disrespectful to China.\", \"As a result, Hollywood studios have all but stopped producing movies with Chinese villains. One of China\\u2019s biggest recent blockbusters, a government-sponsored epic, celebrates a bloody victory over the Americans during the Korean War.\", \"Silicon Valley\\u2019s internet giants have mostly been shut out of China for years. The latest one to leave was Microsoft\\u2019s LinkedIn, which in October gave up trying to run its service under Beijing\\u2019s censorship requirements.\", \"Plenty of other American tech companies still do big business in China, including Apple, Tesla, Qualcomm and Intel. This feeds all kinds of concerns in Washington: that Chinese agents are siphoning the companies\\u2019 technology and secrets; that the products they make in China are vulnerable to cybermeddling; that they are compromising on professed values in playing by Beijing\\u2019s rules.\", \"It\\u2019s a vicious cycle. The Trump administration\\u2019s crippling of Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, has made Beijing more conscious of how easily the United States can use its economic clout to limit China\\u2019s access to advanced technology.\", \"\\u201cTechnological innovation has become the main battleground in the global strategic game,\\u201d Mr. Xi told a conference in May. China, he has said repeatedly in recent years, needs to achieve \\u201cself-reliance.\\u201d\", \"That, in turn, has made U.S. officials even more alert about stopping sensitive American know-how from ending up in Chinese hands. Washington agencies are more closely scrutinizing Chinese tech investments in the United States. Chinese-born scientists working in America have been arrested on accusations of concealing ties to the Chinese state, though the Justice Department has dropped some of those cases.\", \"The Communist Party\\u2019s leaders have for decades bristled at outside criticisms of their authoritarian governance, calling them intrusions on national sovereignty. But as the party under Mr. Xi has doubled down on its iron-fisted approach to dissent, China\\u2019s confrontations with the United States over values and freedoms have become more frequent.\", \"Washington has imposed sanctions on Chinese officials over Beijing\\u2019s sharp response to the 2019 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. The Commerce Department has restricted U.S. exports to companies involved in China\\u2019s crackdown in Xinjiang, the northwestern region where hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs and other predominantly Muslim minorities have been detained for re-education and indoctrination.\", \"American officials have also expressed concern about labor programs involving workers from Xinjiang who are transferred to factories and cities. The idea behind such transfer programs is that steady work can alleviate poverty and instill loyalty to the Communist Party. But experts say that the programs involve harsh methods that amount to forced labor.\", \"China flatly denies the use of forced labor in the region and called accusations of genocide there the \\u201clie of the century.\\u201d Beijing officials say their policies in Xinjiang are meant to curb religious extremism.\", \"China\\u2019s leaders see signs of American decline everywhere of late: in the nation\\u2019s fumbled handling of the coronavirus pandemic, in its internal divisions over race, in its chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan.\", \"They want a bigger voice in global leadership. They have sought a greater role in Western-dominated institutions like the World Health Organization. They have created their own version of the World Bank to finance development in poor countries. They have tried to expand the loose coalition of nations \\u2014 including Russia, Iran and Cuba \\u2014 that share their frustration with Western bullying and meddling.\", \"Beijing officials insist that America need not see China\\u2019s ascent as a threat. In September, China\\u2019s foreign minister, Wang Yi, told Mr. Biden\\u2019s climate envoy, John Kerry, that America\\u2019s \\u201cmajor strategic misjudgment\\u201d was behind the two nations\\u2019 deteriorating relations.\", \"Mr. Wang cited a Chinese saying: \\u201cHe who tied the knot must untie it.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe ball is now in America\\u2019s court,\\u201d Mr. Wang said.\"]","href_hash":"e85a9671465911ecb7bfcbff42593b24"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e85a9671465911ecb7bfcbff42593b24"}},
