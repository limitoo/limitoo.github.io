Buckley and Gore Vidal and the rancorous public arena of today.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-13T09:29:53.000Z","content":"[\"LONDON \\u2014 History comes hurtling to life in \\u201cBest of Enemies,\\u201d the latest attempt from the prolific playwright James Graham (\\u201cInk,\\u201d \\u201cQuiz\\u201d) to put flesh on the bare bones of the past. Chronicling a sequence of televised face-offs that transfixed the United States in 1968, Graham once again shows a gift for mining the annals of politics and journalism for real theatrical gems. The result, at the Young Vic through Jan. 22, is the most riveting play in London just now.\", \"It helps that the personalities involved in those 10 TV debates were William F. Buckley Jr. and Gore Vidal, two richly articulate men of any dramatist\\u2019s dreams. On the one side was Buckley (played here by David Harewood), founder of The National Review and a conservative grandee; on the other was Vidal (Charles Edwards), the pleasure-seeking novelist and playwright with two homes in Italy and a withering disregard for the \\u201cChristian values\\u201d Buckley espoused.\", \"Ideological opposites, the pair were brought together by ABC to restore the flagging ratings of a network dryly referred to early in the play as the \\u201calmost broadcasting company.\\u201d Drawing inspiration from a 2015 film documentary of the same name, Graham sets their increasingly barbed exchanges against the backdrop of a tumultuous summer. We\\u2019re reminded, via Luke Halls\\u2019s video design, of the riots and protests that were tearing at America, just as Buckley and Vidal tore into one another. (Bunny Christie\\u2019s set is a horseshoe-shaped soundstage with screens perched above the action.)\", \"Graham\\u2019s narrative begins at the end, with his opponents clearly disturbed by a shift in their discussion from which there is no turning back. Vidal has denounced Buckley on air during the Democratic convention in Chicago as \\u201ca crypto-Nazi,\\u201d and Buckley has retaliated by dismissing Vidal as \\u201cqueer.\\u201d The play then rewinds and charts the course back to that on-air debacle, but we also seem to be witnessing a descent into ad hominem argument that has only gathered in intensity to this day.\", \"Graham\\u2019s obvious theatrical prototype is \\u201cFrost/Nixon,\\u201d Peter Morgan\\u2019s 2006 play, which Ron Howard later made into a film. But the stakes here seem higher and the context broader: Jeremy Herrin\\u2019s deft production brings in cameos by Aretha Franklin (Justina Kehinde) \\u2014 \\u201cthey know who I am,\\u201d she snaps when she is introduced \\u2014 and Andy Warhol (Tom Godwin). The actor John Hodgkinson, doubling parts, plays Chicago\\u2019s bellicose mayor, Richard Daley, and the ABC News anchor Howard K. Smith, both of whom he does well.\", \"James Baldwin (Syrus Lowe, excellent), another onetime debating opponent of Buckley\\u2019s, is seen now and again, commenting on the personalities and the fallout between them: \\u201cWhatever the hate, wherever it comes from, it will always eventually destroy the one hating,\\u201d he tells us.\", \"Graham sufficiently connects the vitriol between Buckley and Vidal with the contempt, and worse, that dominates the airwaves now, but you slightly recoil when someone belabors a point. \\u201cMore and more, we\\u2019re divided into our own communities of concern,\\u201d a media analyst (Kehinde again) remarks near the end, bemoaning the way in which TV has increasingly carved up American life.\", \"Even then, the feral energy between the two leads proves irresistible. Vidal is a plum role, and the wonderful Edwards is suitably dapper and silver-tongued, not least when on the offensive: \\u201cDo you read?\\u201d he asks Buckley. \\u201cYou could learn a great deal.\\u201d We clock Vidal\\u2019s predatory eye \\u2014 \\u201cspeaking of eating, hello\\u201d he remarks libidinously to a young man (Sam Otto) who will become his aide and bedmate \\u2014 alongside his exhaustive breadth of historical knowledge.\", \"Buckley, far from being the straw man of the pair, is arguably the more complicated. Casually disdainful and airily patronizing, he is given tremendous gravitas by Harewood, a Black British actor cunningly cast against expectation as a white establishment figure who was taken to task for bigotry more than once.\", \"Speaking in a lower register than Buckley, Harewood requires that we listen afresh to Buckley, as we do to Vidal: both men at ease with their characters\\u2019 fast-talking fluency of thought. And if their shared fate was to cross the line that separates reasonable debate from rancor, well, welcome to the world today, and to the coarsening of the public arena that \\u201cBest of Enemies\\u201d brings stingingly to life.\"]","href_hash":"32b19ae85c3a11ec9bc11fe9ddd7fc61"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"32b19ae85c3a11ec9bc11fe9ddd7fc61"}},
