According to a March 2021 report by the W.H.O. and China, the first known case was an accountant who was not connected to the market and who reportedly developed symptoms on Dec. 8.\", \"But Michael Worobey, a leading expert in tracing the evolution of viruses at the University of Arizona, recently poured over public accounts of early Covid-19 cases. In a review published in the journal Science, he found that the W.H.O. inquiry had likely gotten wrong the early chronology of the pandemic, my colleagues Carl Zimmer, Benjamin Mueller and Chris Buckley report. His analysis suggests that the first known patient was a woman named Wei Guixian, who was a vendor in the animal market.\", \"Dr. Worobey argues that the vendor\\u2019s ties to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as well as a new analysis of the earliest hospitalized patients\\u2019 connections to the market, strongly suggest that the pandemic began there.\", \"\\u201cIn this city of 11 million people, half of the early cases are linked to a place that\\u2019s the size of a soccer field,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt becomes very difficult to explain that pattern if the outbreak didn\\u2019t start at the market.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Worobey combed through public medical journals, as well as video interviews with a Chinese news outlet of people believed to have the first two reported infections. He discovered that the original date of the accountant\\u2019s infection was most likely incorrectly logged in the W.H.O. report as Dec. 8. Both a study and an interview with the accountant put his original infection at Dec. 16. (The New York Times was not able to independently confirm the identity of the man in the interview.)\", \"Several experts said that Dr. Worobey\\u2019s detective work was sound, but that the evidence was still insufficient to decisively settle the larger question of how the pandemic began.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t disagree with the analysis,\\u201d said Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t agree that any of the data are strong enough or complete enough to say anything very confidently, other than that the Huanan Seafood Market was clearly a super-spreading event.\\u201d\", \"A new documentary offers a rare look inside the U.S. hospital system during the early days of the pandemic. The film, \\u201cThe First Wave,\\u201d follows a team of health care workers at a New York City hospital as they confront the unfolding Covid disaster. \", \"I spoke to Matthew Heineman, the film\\u2019s director, about the project. Our conversation has been condensed and edited.\", \"What do you think would surprise Americans about the early days of pandemic?\", \"Witnessing it. As the American public, we were so shielded from the realities of what was happening inside hospitals during this time. The Times did an incredible job of documenting it, but for the most part, Americans were shielded from those images. Covid was constantly referred to with wartime language, you know, doctors and nurses on the front lines. But when you look at wars throughout history, there\\u2019s images. And I think that\\u2019s part of why this issue became so polarized, and why there was so much misinformation, because we didn\\u2019t know what was really happening.\", \"What did you learn about Covid while making this film?\", \"Imagine training your entire life to understand the human body in a certain way and everything you\\u2019ve learned, and everything that you studied, everything you\\u2019d done was just thrown out the window. And that\\u2019s what it was like for these doctors and nurses. These people were doing everything they could to keep people alive with no tools or knowledge on how to do so.\", \"Psychologically, it was a really difficult thing to witness. And I think we\\u2019re now seeing \\u2014 a year and a half later \\u2014 the long-term mental health impacts of that on health care workers. And I think we have the possibility of losing a whole generation of health care workers as a result of what they went through.\", \"Was there a particular moment that resonated with you?\", \"One of our main participants in the film is a nurse, named Brussels Jabon, who tested positive for Covid along with her entire family. She was pregnant, and right after giving birth she was intubated and separated from her baby and struggling to stay alive. The baby wasn\\u2019t able to go home because the family was still Covid positive. So their cousins go pick up the baby and drive by the house so that Brussels\\u2019s husband, Naph, can see his newborn. And as they drive by, Naph is trying to touch him through the window. That moment will always stick with me. It just it felt so otherworldly. You know \\u2014 what universe are we living in where this is happening?\", \"I\\u2019m going to be honest, before I watched the film, I thought, I don\\u2019t know if I\\u2019m ready for this. \", \"People are nervous about seeing this film. But I think the experience of coming together and watching it with your family, or in a theater, or however you\\u2019re watching it, has been really cathartic for people. And since we\\u2019ve been so isolated and so separated, to have the space to reflect on what we\\u2019ve been through has been really emotional to see.\", \"And for those who watch it, I think it\\u2019ll give them an enormous amount of gratitude that a brave group of individuals came together to fight this virus with nothing at their disposal. And I think it will give them a place to reflect on the world that we live in, and how we\\u2019ve all changed.\", \"\\u201cThe First Wave\\u201d is playing in select theaters tomorrow, and streaming on Hulu beginning on Dec. 5.\", \"Leaving health care: Ed Yong at The Atlantic explains why about one in five health care workers have quit since the beginning of the pandemic.\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic. Send us a response here, and we may feature it in an upcoming newsletter.\", \"Sign up here to get the briefing by email.\"]","href_hash":"786b0ea648bd11ecaddded3101c0aae9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"786b0ea648bd11ecaddded3101c0aae9"}},
