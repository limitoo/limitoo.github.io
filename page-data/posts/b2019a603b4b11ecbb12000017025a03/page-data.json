Jenny Gersten, who had led the festival from 2010 to 2014, will return as interim artistic director during the search for a new leader.\", \"The summer festival, which runs in the Berkshires region of Western Massachusetts and has traditionally relied in part on a pool of young seasonal workers, did not offer a reason for the change of leadership. But it follows a pair of reports in The Los Angeles Times detailing concerns by employees \\u2014 sound crew members who objected to working outdoors, on a show set in a reflecting pool, during rainy weather, and former employees, many of them onetime interns, who expressed other safety concerns.\", \"The festival said in a news release that the leadership change \\u201cwill ensure a future vision that not only expands on the Festival\\u2019s well-respected legacy, but one that is accountable, safe and equitable for all.\\u201d\", \"In a statement, Greenfield said that her \\u201cgoal as artistic director was to swing for the fences, make art and try to improve and evolve every day.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIn 2019, I declined to renew a multiyear contract offered to me by the Festival; while flattered to be asked to continue, I agreed instead to stay on for two years, on a year-to-year basis,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI also publicly committed to leadership transition as I deeply believe, influenced by the British tradition, that theatrical institutions must empower new, diverse leaders in regular, shorter intervals than is the custom in the United States.\\u201d\", \"Greenfield\\u2019s tenure featured a notable number of artistic successes, including Broadway transfers for \\u201cGrand Horizons,\\u201d \\u201cThe Sound Inside,\\u201d \\u201cThe Rose Tattoo,\\u201d \\u201cFool for Love\\u201d and \\u201cLiving on Love,\\u201d as well as multiple Off Broadway transfers.\", \"Gersten has held a variety of positions in the theater world.
