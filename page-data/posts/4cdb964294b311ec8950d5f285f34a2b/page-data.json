Metropolitan Police Department and the U.S. Capitol Police for National Guard assistance ahead of trucker protests expected to arrive in the area soon.\\u00a0\", \"Roughly 700 National Guard personnel will be deployed to help control traffic at designated traffic posts and points leading to the Capitol. Truck drivers protesting vaccine requirements are expected to depart Pennsylvania on Wednesday morning and drive to the D.C. area, arriving late Wednesday or Thursday. The demonstration protesting vaccine requirements and other issues is inspired by truck driver protests in Canada.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The people who live, work and visit the District are part of our community, and their safety is our first mission priority,\\\" Major General Sherrie McCandless, commanding general of the D.C. National Guard, said in a statement. \\\"Our MPD and USCP partners have asked for our help in ensuring people can demonstrate peacefully and safely, and we stand ready to assist.\\\"\\u00a0 \\u00a0\", \"An organizer from the Scranton, Pennsylvania, area told CBS News he has \\\"many\\\" commitments for the protest against vaccine requirements and any other issues, and that they plan to block the D.C. beltway but not drive into the city. That could complicate commutes for those who live in neighboring Virginia and Maryland.
