Like other Afghan officers who fled in dozens of military aircraft to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the pilot had faith that his American military partners would rescue him.\", \"\\u201cWe believed in the U.S. military and government \\u2014 that they would help us and get us out of this situation,\\u201d said the pilot, a lieutenant, who, like other pilots in this article, spoke on the condition of anonymity because of security concerns.\", \"The lieutenant is among 143 Afghan pilots and crew members now detained by the Tajik authorities. They are English speakers trained by the U.S. Air Force, and they are counting on the American government or military to evacuate them, and also to help evacuate their families back home in Afghanistan.\", \"Several thousand other Afghan Air Force pilots and crew members are in hiding in Afghanistan, feeling abandoned by the U.S. military, their longtime combat ally. They say they and their families are at risk of being hunted down and killed by the Taliban.\", \"\\u201cI stood shoulder to shoulder with my American allies for five years \\u2014 but now they have forgotten us,\\u201d an Afghan Air Force captain who piloted C-208 airplanes said by phone from a safe house in Kabul.\", \"Several other pilots who spoke by phone from Afghanistan said they had heard nothing from the U.S. government. But they said they were being assisted by their former military advisers, many of them volunteers in a group called Operation Sacred Promise, formed to help get Afghan Air Force personnel to safety.\", \"Brig. Gen. David Hicks, a retired Air Force officer who is chief executive of Operation Sacred Promise, said the group, formed in August, had received desperate messages from stranded pilots asking whether the U.S. government had a plan to get them to safety.\", \"\\u201cWe found out that there was no plan by the U.S. to do anything to get these folks out,\\u201d said General Hicks, who once commanded the U.S.-led air force training mission in Afghanistan.\", \"He said: \\u201cThe U.S. has spent millions and millions on these highly educated and highly motivated individuals. Based on what they did fighting the Taliban, we think they deserve priority.\\u201d\", \"A State Department spokesperson offered no timeline on relocating Afghan pilots but said Sunday, \\u201cWe are in regular communication with the government of Tajikistan, and part of those communications includes coordination in response to Afghan Air Force pilots.\\u201d\", \"The spokesperson said, \\u201cThe United States verified the identities of approximately 150 Afghans after gaining access to the last group in mid-October.\\u201d\", \"The United States spent $89 billion training and equipping Afghan defense and security forces, including the Afghan Air Force and its elite Special Mission Wing. Many of the pilots were trained in the United States.\", \"Some pilots and crew members and their families were evacuated with the help of the U.S. government and military just after the Taliban takeover. But many more were unable to get out, despite attempts by their former advisers to help them.\", \"Since mid-August, General Hicks said, Operation Sacred Promise has helped evacuate about 350 Afghans. The group has vetted about 2,000 Afghan Air Force personnel and their relatives trying to leave the country, with about 8,000 more still to be vetted, he said.\", \"Lt. Col. Safia Ferozi, an Afghan Air Force squadron commander who was evacuated to the United States with her husband \\u2014 also a pilot \\u2014 and daughter, said she had been inundated with panicked calls and texts from Afghan pilots in Afghanistan and Tajikistan.\", \"\\u201cThey fought side by side with the Americans,\\u201d Colonel Ferozi said in a telephone interview. \\u201cNow they feel forgotten. Why doesn\\u2019t the U.S. care about these people who fought beside them?\\u201d\", \"In September, a group of Afghan pilots and crew members was evacuated from Uzbekistan with the help of the U.S. government and Operation Sacred Promise after being detained by the Uzbek authorities.\", \"But another group of 143 Afghan Air Force personnel remains in detention at a sanitarium near the Tajik capital, Dushanbe. They said they were growing increasingly desperate, even though U.S. Embassy officials in Dushanbe had recently arrived to record their biometric data as part of an effort to evacuate them.\", \"\\u201cThe morale among our colleagues here is very low,\\u201d said an Afghan Air Force major who flew a C-208 military plane to Tajikistan. \\u201cWe are in an unknown situation and we don\\u2019t know what will happen next to us.\\u201d\", \"The major and several other pilots spoke on WhatsApp audio messages recorded on smuggled cellphones hidden from guards. They said they were not allowed to leave the facility, where most cellphones had been confiscated. They survive on meager food rations and receive only basic medical care, they said.\", \"Many have not been in touch with their families in Afghanistan, some of whom don\\u2019t know whether they are still alive, they said.\", \"\\u201cWe feel abandoned, but we still have hope the U.S. will help us,\\u201d said a major who said he had piloted numerous combat missions.\", \"The Tajikistan Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to email messages requesting comment.\", \"Among those held in Tajikistan is an Afghan pilot who is pregnant and said she needed prenatal care. Her husband, also a pilot, was being held with her.\", \"\\u201cWe are living like prisoners,\\u201d she said in an audio message recorded late last month. \\u201cWe are fed up. We are getting weak. I\\u2019d like to request that the U.S. government expedite our situation here.\\u201d\", \"During Afghanistan\\u2019s collapse about 25 percent of the Afghan Air Force\\u2019s aircraft were flown to Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, according an Oct. 31 report by the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. General Hicks put the number at 56 to 60 aircraft. (U.S. forces rendered unusable 80 others at the Kabul Airport in late August.)\", \"The status of the planes is uncertain. When asked in mid-August what was being done to recover the aircraft, Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III replied, \\u201cWe\\u2019re focused on the airfield and getting people out safely.\\u201d \", \"Speaking from Afghanistan, several Afghan Air Force pilots described moving from house to house to avoid capture by the Taliban. They said they were running out of money and did not dare look for work because they feared being discovered by Taliban officials.\", \"An Afghan Air Force major who flew C-208 planes for eight years said the Taliban had confronted his relatives, demanding to know his whereabouts. Taliban fighters searched his home and interrogated his mother, said the major, who had moved with his wife and four children to a series of safe houses.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s very dangerous for us here,\\u201d the major said.\", \"He said he had been unable to reach anyone in the U.S. government or military, other than his former U.S. Air Force adviser. \\u201cIt seems we aren\\u2019t so important to them anymore,\\u201d he said.\", \"The Taliban have said there is a general amnesty for any Afghan who served in the former government or worked with the U.S. government or military. But several Afghan Air Force pilots have been killed by the Taliban this year.\", \"\\u201cThey have no good options,\\u201d General Hicks said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re at risk of being hunted down and killed.\\u201d\", \"A major who piloted C-208 planes and was trained at a U.S. Air Force base in Texas said he turned down a chance to fly to Tajikistan in August because he didn\\u2019t want to leave his family behind. Now he and his wife and their seven children are in hiding, low on money and food.\", \"\\u201cOur life gets worse day by day,\\u201d the major said. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t stay in one place. We are always hiding \\u2014 even our relatives don\\u2019t know where we are.\\u201d\", \"General Hicks said he feared the pilots and crew members in Afghanistan would soon run out of money and food, and possibly lose what freedom they have left.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s no place for them to hide inside Afghanistan,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe have to realize that it\\u2019s about to be a very dark winter for these people.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a96e8148400911ecaba1cfe81d931c45"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a96e8148400911ecaba1cfe81d931c45"}},
