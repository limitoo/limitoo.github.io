Many MPs were motivated by deeply held convictions, but the tone of debate wasn't helped by a heavy dose of political opportunism and partisanship across the aisles of parliament.\", \"The political right senses an opportunity to expose the left as being weak on faith, calculating it will hurt Labor in multicultural seats, especially in Sydney's west. They paint the left and the progressive politics of identity at its more extreme as dismissive, indeed hostile, to religion.\", \"Social progressives frame the deeply held beliefs of conservative people of faith on abortion, LGBTIQ issues and euthanasia as discrimination and intolerance rather than matters of faith and conviction.\", \"Conservatives, meanwhile, sometimes seem more eager to plant the flag of their faith in the defence of intolerance or exclusion than the teachings of love, forgiveness, grace and humility.\", \"The\\u00a0bold assertion of religious freedom\\u00a0has also been\\u00a0undermined in recent times by the moral failings of many faith groups\\u00a0on issues of sexual abuse.\", \"As this week has shown, the politics of faith and secularism are divisive and seemingly implacable.\", \"But Australia is not alone when it comes to questions of God.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">The role of faith in the public square</div>\", \"Throughout the world faith is a political fault line. Indeed, for liberal democracies it is an existential challenge. It raises questions of who belongs? Where does the public and private begin and end? What is the future of pluralism? Can democracy still effectively govern over diversity?\", \"From India's hijab ban in some schools, to France's public prohibition of full face veils to Sweden's ban on minarets on mosques, the role of faith in the public square is an incendiary one.\", \"Political leaders around the world are seizing on religion as a fundamental marker of national identity. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi pursues a virulent Hindu nationalism that is eroding the country's democracy. In Myanmar Buddhist nationalism has inspired the slaughter and mass removal of Rohingya Muslims.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a26bd608ee8992cb08315dc2e5e3d10f\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Vladimir Putin has positioned Orthodox religion as a cornerstone of what it is to be Russian.(Reuters: Sputnik/Mikhail Metzel/Pool\\u00a0)</div>\", \"The Chinese Communist Party outlaws all Christian churches not authorised, monitored and approved by the state.

He says Western Europe has given up on Christianity; instead he says it had chosen a \\\"godless cosmos, rainbow families, migration and open societies.\\\".\", \"Vladimir Putin has positioned Orthodox religion as a cornerstone of what it is to be Russian. He has lectured the West on the perils of identity politics.\", \"Like China's Xi Jinping, Putin sees Western liberalism as inherently weak and, to Putin, the erosion of faith is symbolic of that weakness.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Is Europe still Christian?</div>\", \"This is especially acute in Europe.

It is a society built on rationalisation and bureaucratisation.\", \"Inevitably there is an emptiness, filled today by identity-based politics seeking belonging around shared suffering and injustice, and people of faith for whom divine scripture cannot be contracted away.\", \"Both identity and faith are a response to a world stripped of meaning.
