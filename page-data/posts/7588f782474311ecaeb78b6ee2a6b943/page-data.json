What this indictment further exposes is that James Comey\\u2019s F.B.I. became a Bureau of Dirty Tricks, mitigated only by its own incompetence \\u2014 like a mash-up of Inspector Javert and Inspector Clouseau. Donald Trump\\u2019s best move as president (about which I was dead wrong at the time) may have been to fire him.\", \"If you haven\\u2019t followed the drip-drip-drip of revelations, late in 2019 Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Department\\u2019s inspector general, published a damning report detailing \\u201cmany basic and fundamental errors\\u201d by the F.B.I. in seeking Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court warrants to surveil Carter Page, the American businessman fingered in the dossier as a potential link between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin.\", \"Shortly afterward, Rosemary Collyer, the court\\u2019s presiding judge, issued her own stinging rebuke of the bureau: \\u201cThe frequency with which representations made by F.B.I. personnel turned out to be unsupported or contradicted by information in their possession, and with which they withheld information detrimental to their case, calls into question whether information contained in other F.B.I. applications is reliable,\\u201d she wrote.\", \"Here a question emerged: Were the F.B.I.\\u2019s errors a matter of general incompetence or of bias? There appears to be a broad pattern of F.B.I. agents overstating evidence that corroborates their suspicions. That led to travesties such as the bureau hounding the wrong man in the 2001 anthrax attacks.\", \"But it turns out the bureau can be both incompetent and biased. When the F.B.I. applied for warrants to continue wiretapping Page, it already knew Page was helping the C.I.A., not the Russians. We know this because in August 2020 a former F.B.I. lawyer, Kevin Clinesmith, pleaded guilty to rewriting an email to hide Page\\u2019s C.I.A. ties.\", \"And why would Clinesmith do that? It certainly helped the bureau renew its wiretap warrants on Page, and, as he once put it in a text message to a colleague, \\u201cviva la resistance.\\u201d When the purpose of government service is to stop \\u201cthe crazies\\u201d (one of Clinesmith\\u2019s descriptions of the elected administration) then the ends soon find a way of justifying the means.\", \"Which brings us to the grand jury indictment of Danchenko in the investigation being conducted by the special counsel John Durham. Danchenko was Steele\\u2019s main source for the most attention-grabbing claims in the dossier, including the existence of a likely mythical \\u201cpee tape.\\u201d Steele, in turn, wrote his report for Fusion GPS, an opposition-research outfit that had been hired by a Washington law firm close to the Hillary Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee.\", \"Translation: The Steele dossier was Democratic Party-funded opposition research that had been sub-sub-sub-sub contracted to Danchenko, who now stands accused of repeatedly lying to the F.B.I. about his own sources while also having been investigated a decade ago for possible ties to Russian intelligence. Danchenko has pleaded not guilty and adamantly denies Russian intelligence ties, and he deserves his day in court. He describes the raw intelligence he collected for Steele as little more than a collection of rumors and innuendo and alleges that Steele dressed them up for Fusion GPS.\", \"Of such dross was spun years of high-level federal investigations, ponderous congressional hearings, pompous Adam Schiff soliloquies, and nonstop public furor. But none of that would likely have happened if the F.B.I. had treated the dossier as the garbage that it was, while stressing the ways in which Russia had sought to influence the election on Trump\\u2019s behalf, or the ways in which the Trump campaign (particularly through its onetime manager, Paul Manafort) was vulnerable to Russian blackmail.\", \"Instead, Comey used it as a political weapon by privately briefing President-elect Trump about it, despite ample warnings about the dossier\\u2019s credibility. In doing so, Comey made the existence of the \\u201csalacious and unverified\\u201d dossier news in its own right. And, as the University of Chicago\\u2019s Charles Lipson astutely notes, Comey\\u2019s briefing \\u201ccould be seen as a kind of blackmail threat, the kind that marked J. Edgar Hoover\\u2019s tenure.\\u201d\", \"If you are a certain kind of reader \\u2014 probably conservative \\u2014 who has closely followed the Durham investigation, none of the above will come as news. But I\\u2019m writing this column for those who haven\\u2019t followed it closely, or who may have taken a keener interest in tales about Trump being Russia\\u2019s puppet than in evidence that, for all of his many and grave sins, he was the victim of a gigantic slander abetted by the F.B.I.\", \"Democrats who don\\u2019t want the vast power wielded by the bureau ever used against one of their own \\u2014 as, after all, it was against Hillary Clinton \\u2014 ought to use the Durham investigation as an opportunity to clean up, or clean out, the F.B.I. once and for all.\"]","href_hash":"7588f782474311ecaeb78b6ee2a6b943"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7588f782474311ecaeb78b6ee2a6b943"}},
