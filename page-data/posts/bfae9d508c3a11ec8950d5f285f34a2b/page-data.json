This has often been true in the movies, as cops bond during stake-outs and road-tripping passengers spill secrets; where everything from a Jeep-bound conversation in a Kiarostami film to a high-speed Fast and the Furious bro-down takes on unexpected emotional grace.\", \"In writer-filmmaker Ry\\u00fbsuke Hamaguchi's newly Oscar-nominated Drive My Car, a cherry-red 1987 Saab 900 Turbo is the latest, somewhat unlikely vessel for shared intimacy, gliding through the three-hour emotional epic.\", \"Loosely adapted from a 2014 short story by Haruki Murakami, Hamaguchi's melodrama focuses on renowned Tokyo theatre director Y\\u016bsuke Kafuku (Hidetoshi Nishijima), a melancholy 40-something whose screenwriter wife Oto (Reika Kirishima) is having an affair with her doll-faced TV star (Masaki Okada).\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d1b31ee356b641669021b5906c0bed1d\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The film has been nominated for four Academy Awards, including best picture, matching the previous record for a Japanese language film.\\u00a0(Supplied: Potential Films)</div>\", \"Hamaguchi's precise filmmaking here is so seemingly nonchalant that his title credits don't unroll until some 40 minutes in, by which time the story has jumped ahead two years and a tragedy. We pick up with a grief-wracked Y\\u016bsuke, who has accepted a two-month artist's residency at a theatre festival in Hiroshima, where he is to stage a production of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya with an international troupe.\", \"Y\\u016bsuke arrives in Hiroshima behind the wheel of his faithful Saab, a now-vintage ride that he's cared for with the level of affection normally reserved for an old friend, on whose tape deck he listens to recordings of his wife reading the lines of his plays.\", \"So he's a little rattled when a driver is assigned to chauffeur him to and from the institution each day \\u2014 in his own car. She's Misaki Watari (T\\u00f4ko Miura), an aloof, 23-year-old Hokkaido runaway in Chuck Taylors, who puffs on cigarettes like a young beatnik \\u2013 or Winona Ryder's tomboy cabbie in Night on Earth \\u2013 but whose insouciance belies a wisdom beyond her years.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/507da5518926205ad19174b2b946bcad\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> \\u201cI\\u2019ve started to think that there is no such thing as an original. Everything is an adaptation,\\u201d Hamaguchi told Screen Slate.(Supplied: Potential Films)</div>\", \"Y\\u016bsuke's begrudging acceptance of Misaki's skilled driving is sealed when he breaks a long silence to ask: \\\"Could you play the cassette tape?\\\"\", \"The film moves effortlessly between affecting close-ups, patient long takes and lyrical images, such as the pair's cigarettes held aloft in the car's sunroof, tips glowing in the night sky \\u2013 all shot cleanly by cinematographer Hidetoshi Shinomiya with an unfussiness that conceals his elegant command.\", \"As the car winds the roads of the island, skirting lush forest and the edge of the Setouchi Sea, the unusual pair are slow to exchange words. She simply drops him off to rehearsals each morning; waits; then drives him home each night, while Y\\u016bsuke gazes numbly out the window, his eyes betraying a deeply repressed well of sadness.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2f6586eb6f1916f510b83060a1f07684\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Hamaguchi invited Shinomiya to be his cinematographer\\u00a0after seeing And Your Bird Can Sing, which Shinomiya also shot.(Supplied: Potential Films)</div>\", \"Often, the car is filled with the sound of Chekhov's words on endless loop, Oto's voice a haunting reminder of Y\\u016bsuke's fraught marriage and his unspoken existential crisis, as well as the encroaching deadline of the theatre production.\", \"\\\"Don't you get sick of hearing this?\\\" he asks Misaki when the tape starts once again, a question that could drolly be extended to the audience.\", \"But words, and their delivery, are what electrify Drive My Car, and the lines of Chekhov's play shift and transform with each new iteration.\", \"\\\"The text is questioning you,\\\" Y\\u016bsuke says to one of his actors, in full thrall to its diabolical powers.\", \"The ineffable magic of performance is a cinematic well that's long been tapped by filmmakers such as Jacques Rivette. As clear-cut notions of reality collapse, life and art enchantingly blur.\", \"Here, Misaki might be seen as a version of Chekhov's Sonya, a world-weary innocent who resists self-pity, and who slowly guides Y\\u016bsuke, a stand-in for the despairing Vanya, to accept the trials of life and find something like peace.\", \"That this all plays out against the backdrop of atomic-bombed Hiroshima, a city synonymous with a suffering that can never be forgotten, subtly amplifies the emotional pitch.\", \"This blurring seems to be a private obsession of Hamaguchi's. His characters are always engaged in some form of ambiguous role-play; in his breakthrough ensemble piece Happy Hour (2015), the doppelganger drama Asako I & II (2018) and his phenomenal 2021 triptych Wheel of Fortune and Fantasy (due in cinemas in March), deception and mistaken identities abound.\", \"Drive My Car is a less experimental, more classically emotional and outwardly \\\"major\\\" offering than those films. It's also \\u2014 not coincidentally \\u2014 the first of Hamaguchi's movies to find significant favour outside the festival circuit, having already collected a trunk-full of awards (including three at the Cannes Film Festival) en route to its multiple Oscar nods.\", \"Like so many professional loners, Y\\u016bsuke and Misaki are drawn to each other through a kind of quiet, mutual respect \\u2013 highly skilled craftspeople who cling to their work to get through each day.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/cf993945d6b050b5d9320cad3ebec751\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> \\\"Acting is a mysterious thing;\\u00a0a fiction. But when [it] is superb, it becomes something beyond fiction,\\\" Hamaguchi told the LA Times.(Supplied: Potential Films)</div>\", \"But their rapport evolves into something deeper as the back-seat chatter increases, especially after Misaki drives him to one of her favourite spots on the island, a hulking waste treatment facility where she stops to admire the falling scraps of garbage: \\\"Isn't it kind of like snow?\\\"\", \"It's in these rare moments that Y\\u016bsuke and Misaki are each able to find a sympathetic ear and open up about their own painful pasts\", \"The film majestically balances icy restraint with pure blasts of emotion, burrowing right down into the characters' souls.\", \"Like much of Hamaguchi's work, Drive My Car profoundly understands the fickleness of fate, of lives marked by freak accidents and chance connections. No amount of real talk can bring Y\\u016bsuke's loved ones back, but \\u2013 to paraphrase Lennon and McCartney's urtext \\u2013 he's found a driver, and that's a start.\", \"Drive My Car is in cinemas now.\"]","href_hash":"bfae9d508c3a11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bfae9d508c3a11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
