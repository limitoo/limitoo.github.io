Paul Irving, the House sergeant at arms at the time, consulted with Congressional leadership before the Capitol Police Board, on which he sat, determined there was an emergency. Thirty minutes later, Sund sent a request for aid to the Defense Department. By that time, rioters had broken into the Capitol and had reached the doors to the Senate chamber.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"While the Board's Manual included general information about some of the authorities available for obtaining outside assistance, neither the Board nor the Capitol Police had clear procedures or guidance for when and how to use the different authorities to obtain outside assistance,\\\" the GAO report reads.\\u00a0\", \"Sund resigned the day after the attack on the U.S. Capitol.\\u00a0\", \"The GAO found that the Capitol Police Board does not have a documented procedure for evaluating which Capitol vulnerabilities are deemed relevant enough for precautions to be implemented. The report also said that the Capitol Police's list of countermeasures lacks the specificity of the Interagency Security Committee (ISC) standard. For instance, the report notes that the list includes measures like \\\"window protection,\\\" \\\"locks,\\\" and \\\"fencing,\\\" but it does not say the type of window protection, locks or fencing required for different scenarios.\\u00a0\", \"In a letter to the GAO, Capitol Police chief Thomas Manger said he agreed with the recommendations directed to him, and that he had already taken steps to remedy the GAO's concerns, including instituting a new critical incident response plan that outlines the processes for requesting outside help last July. Manger said the department will create a standard operating document for those situations as well. He also wrote that Capitol Police are creating a new security coordination division to evaluate threats and assess risk and countermeasures according to standards set by Congress.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The Department appreciates the review by the U.S. Government Accountability Office.
