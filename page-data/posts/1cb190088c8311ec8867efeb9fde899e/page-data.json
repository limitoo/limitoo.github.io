Gu is one of the few athletes to compete in both slopestyle and halfpipe, and halfpipe qualifications are scheduled for Thursday.\", \"Gu already has one gold medal, in big air, earned in dramatic, come-from-behind fashion last Tuesday at an industrial park in western Beijing. Her win catapulted her to another level of fame and scrutiny. Afterward, she deftly answered questions from reporters for more than an hour while swiping away probing queries about her citizenship status.\", \"The Olympics have a policy that athletes must be citizens of the country for which they compete, and China does not allow dual citizenship.\", \"Gu, whose mother was born and raised in China and who maintains deep ties to Beijing, is a ubiquitous figure here. Her face graces advertisements of all sorts and her exploits receive constant attention on state-run news channels.\", \"Slopestyle is an event that suits Gu, who showed technical prowess on the rails at a young age, working with the U.S. national team (she switched to China in 2019). She is a daring jumper, as her big air victory demonstrated.\", \"In a smattering of international competitions over the past year, Gu has won or finished second in every slopestyle event. Her biggest threat here is likely to come from Kelly Sildaru of Estonia and Tess Ledeux of France. It was Ledeux who led the big air event until Gu\\u2019s final jump dropped her to silver.\"]","href_hash":"1cb190088c8311ec8867efeb9fde899e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1cb190088c8311ec8867efeb9fde899e"}},
