Except this one. \\u201cHow to With John Wilson\\u201d is a video collage of footage shot by Wilson and assembled into gorgeous, silly and strange musings. Seemingly random vignettes of pedestrians, of wry graffiti, of urban minutiae play under Wilson\\u2019s narration, and suddenly what was a mess of roving is now a beautiful strand of yarn. Season 2 kicks off with \\u201cHow to Invest in Real Estate,\\u201d which somehow includes clotheslines of underpants and an array of ventriloquism dummies. I love this show.\", \"\\u2018Wellington Paranormal\\u2019When to watch: Saturday at 8:30 p.m., on the CW.\", \"\\u201cWellington Paranormal\\u201d is a comedy from New Zealand that\\u2019s like a hybrid of \\u201cThe X-Files\\u201d and \\u201cReno 911.\\u201d It\\u2019s part of the \\u201cWhat We Do in the Shadows\\u201d universe, but you don\\u2019t need to have seen that movie or that show to like the supernatural shenanigans here. Three seasons have aired in New Zealand, but so far only two have aired in the United States, broadcast on the CW and streaming on HBO Max. This weekend\\u2019s episode is the Christmas special from 2019, and it\\u2019s a perfect entree: Officers Minogue and O\\u2019Leary (Mike Minogue and Karen O\\u2019Leary) investigate a cursed doll, a mall Santa who is actually a mall Satan and a barbecue where a portal to another dimension has opened.\", \"\\u2018School of Chocolate\\u2019When to watch: Arrives Friday, on Netflix.\", \"This eight-part chocolate-sculpture competition series sets itself apart from other food-contest shows in a few ways. First, no one is eliminated (the dream!) but rather graded throughout the season. Second, the host and judge, Amaury Guichon, provides genuine instruction to the chocolatiers, not just \\u201care you suuuure?\\u201d eyebrow waggles, or passive-aggressive suggestions like, \\u201cWell, if you like those flavors. \\u2026 \\u201d Third, several of the episodes are around 30 minutes. Fourth, the contestants taste one another\\u2019s work. And finally, they seem less interested in testy infighting than cheftestants on other shows; \\u201cIt\\u2019s not personal,\\u201d one says, correctly, when she is ranked last in a challenge. If you want a crowd-pleasing, low-lift show for this weekend, try this.\"]","href_hash":"1d585de54e1611ec8e63fdd9d381a2ce"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1d585de54e1611ec8e63fdd9d381a2ce"}},
