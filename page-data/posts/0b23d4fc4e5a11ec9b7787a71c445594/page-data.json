Dyer also mentioned Illinois Representative Marie Newman installing a transgender flag across the hall from Greene's office in opposition to Greene's stances against transgender inclusion in public accommodations.\", \"Greene has been accused of abusive behavior as well for acts like referring to Democratic Minnesota Representative Ilhan Omar as a \\\"brotherf**ker\\\" and Bush as a \\\"terrorist\\\" for supporting the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement. Greene has said that BLM has done more harm to the U.S. than the participants in the January 6 riots at the U.S. Capitol.\", \"In January, Gomez (a California Democrat) introduced a resolution to expel Greene from Congress for her past social media posts calling for violence against Democratic politicians and promoting extremist conspiracy theories.\", \"In Greene's past social media comments, she has advocated for violence against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former President Barack Obama, said that an airplane never hit the Pentagon during the September 11 terrorist attacks, said that a space laser started the California wildfires to benefit a Jewish bank and also accused former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton of slicing off a child's face and wearing it, as well as many other conspiracy theories.\", \"In early February, the Democratic-led House voted to strip Greene of all her committee seats. Every Democratic House member and 11 Republican members voted in favor of unseating her.\", \"At the time, Greene blamed \\\"cancel culture\\\" for encouraging the public uproar over her social media posts.\", \"After being stripped of her committee assignments, Greene said her removal freed her to build a political network supporting Republican former President Donald Trump and to push congressional Republicans further rightward, The Washington Post reported.\", \"Greene's reference about holding Republicans accountable likely refers to the 13 House Republicans who voted in support of the $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill on November 5. The bill had already passed in the Senate with some Republican support in August.\", \"Greene referred to GOP senators who supported the bill as \\\"traitors.\\\" She also called for them to be removed from any House committee assignments they might have as punishment for helping Democrats pass President Joe Biden's agenda.\", \"After the November 5 House vote on the bill, Greene tweeted out the office phone numbers of the 13 House Republicans who supported it. Some of the Republicans who voted for the bill have since received death threats.\", \"If Republicans do regain House majority and McCarthy becomes speaker, he will have to balance the desires of his party's far-right and moderate factions.\", \"Hard-right GOP lawmakers\\u2014such as Greene, Gaetz and other members of the House Freedom Caucus\\u2014have hailed Trump as the future of the party. Meanwhile, other GOP Congress members, including Illinois Representative Adam Kinzinger and Wyoming Representative Liz Cheney, have rejected Trump as a dangerous and anti-democratic influence.\"]","href_hash":"0b23d4fc4e5a11ec9b7787a71c445594"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0b23d4fc4e5a11ec9b7787a71c445594"}},
