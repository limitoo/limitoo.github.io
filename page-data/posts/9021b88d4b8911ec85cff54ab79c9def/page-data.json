That seems to have changed.\", \"As the House debated last week whether to censure Paul Gosar, a far-right congressman from Arizona, for posting an altered anime video depicting him killing Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the progressive from New York, something unusual happened. Speaking one after the other, lawmakers delivered candid and raw confessionals about the frequency with which they, too, had received violent threats.\", \"Nikema Williams, a freshman Democrat from Georgia, described how strange it felt to drop off her child at kindergarten flanked by security officers. Jackie Walorski, a veteran Republican from Indiana, disclosed that an activist had recently tried to run her over with his car.\", \"\\u201cThe threat of actual violence against members of Congress is real, and it is growing,\\u201d said Ted Deutch of Florida, a Democrat who leads the House Ethics Committee. \\u201cNow more than ever, many of us fear for our physical safety.\\u201d\", \"I\\u2019ve covered Congress for more than three years, and those lawmakers\\u2019 testimonials struck me as evidence of the extent to which the rising threat of political violence has loomed over American politics since the Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol by Trump supporters.\", \"But the Republican response to Gosar\\u2019s eventual censure was just as striking: Party leaders in the House pointedly refused to condemn the video, and their rank and file nearly unanimously closed ranks around Gosar. A dozen or so Republicans huddled in solidarity around him as he was censured.\", \"The vote was intended to showcase accountability for political violence. Instead, it revealed a more worrying trend: a growing tolerance in the Republican Party for the menacing, incendiary rhetoric increasingly espoused by its loudest voices. It was a preview of what could become the new status quo in Washington.\", \"The timeline that culminated in Gosar\\u2019s censure began when he posted the video this month. A crudely edited work, it depicted him slashing Ocasio-Cortez\\u2019s neck and swinging swords at President Biden.\", \"Gosar, who has allied himself with white nationalists, refused to apologize. He insisted the video was meant to depict a \\u201csymbolic\\u201d policy battle over immigration.\", \"But it was clear that the shadow of the January attack on the Capitol hung over last week\\u2019s proceedings. Democrats warned that Gosar\\u2019s comments could be perceived as the same kind of call to arms made by Donald Trump on Jan. 6 when he encouraged his supporters at a rally to march on Congress and \\u201cfight like hell.\\u201d\", \"And while Gosar\\u2019s video was the most provocative display of violence amplified by a sitting member of Congress, it was just the latest example of Republican lawmakers using viciously suggestive language.\", \"In the days and weeks before the riot, Trump\\u2019s closest allies in the House, including Gosar, used bellicose, inflammatory rhetoric to encourage their followers to fight against Biden\\u2019s victory. They falsely suggested that Trump was the victim of an attempted \\u201ccoup\\u201d and cast Jan. 6 as the party\\u2019s \\u201c1776 moment.\\u201d\", \"While politically motivated violence targeting lawmakers \\u2014 in both parties \\u2014 is not a new phenomenon, the Capitol Police say they have seen a rapid uptick in violent threats and messages over the past five years, as Trump\\u2019s style of politics became mainstream. A spokesman declined to break down the threats by party, but a review of court records indicates that both Republicans and Democrats in Congress have been targeted.\", \"Democrats stripped Gosar of his posts on two House committees. But his exile might not last long. Republicans are already vowing political retribution if they take back the House.\", \"Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, told reporters that he would return Gosar and Marjorie Taylor Greene, the Georgia Republican whom Democrats also booted off committees for violent comments, to their panel assignments if Republicans take back the majority in 2023. And McCarthy reiterated that Republicans would consider kicking some Democrats out of their committee seats.\", \"Shortly after he was censured, Gosar retweeted his original violent video, and Trump rolled out a fresh endorsement of him.\", \"The act of congressional censure is meant to cast a shadow of disgrace over a lawmaker for politicians and voters alike to see. Instead, by rallying around Gosar, Republican leaders conveyed their implicit support, even as they publicly but vaguely denounced violence.\", \"Those ramifications will stretch beyond Gosar\\u2019s political standing.\", \"\\u201cThis is not about me. This is not about Representative Gosar,\\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said on the House floor. \\u201cThis is about what we are willing to accept.\\u201d\", \"Gail Collins and Bret Stephens discuss what they\\u2019re thankful for.\", \"In the French and British Embassies in Washington, the Hundred Years\\u2019 War is still raging, Maureen Dowd writes.\", \"Plunder: A Cambodian temple looter sold away his people\\u2019s heritage.
