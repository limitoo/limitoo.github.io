Another offered up a video of Ms. Peng at a dinner, in which she and her companions rather conspicuously discussed the date to prove that it was recorded this past weekend.\", \"The international outcry grew only louder. Instead of persuading the world, China\\u2019s ham-handed response has become a textbook example of its inability to communicate with an audience that it can\\u2019t control through censorship and coercion.\", \"The ruling Communist Party communicates through one-way, top-down messaging. It seems to have a hard time understanding that persuasive narratives must be backed by facts and verified by credible, independent sources.\", \"China has grown more sophisticated in recent years at using the power of the internet to advance a more positive, less critical narrative \\u2014 an effort that appears to work from time to time. But at its heart, China\\u2019s propaganda machine still believes the best way to make problems disappear is to shout down the other side. It can also threaten to close off access to its vast market and booming economy to silence companies and governments that don\\u2019t buy their line.\", \"\\u201cMessages like these are meant as a demonstration of power: \\u2018We are telling you that she is fine, and who are you to say otherwise?\\u2019\\u201d Mareike Ohlberg, a fellow at the German Marshall Fund, a Berlin research institute, wrote on Twitter. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not meant to convince people but to intimidate and demonstrate the power of the state.\\u201d\", \"China has a history of less-than-believable testimonials. A jailed prominent lawyer denounced her son on state television for fleeing the country. A Hong Kong bookstore manager who was detained for selling books about the private lives of Chinese leaders said after his release that he had to make a dozen recorded confessions before his captors were satisfied.\", \"This time, the world of women\\u2019s tennis isn\\u2019t playing along and has suggested it will stop holding events in China until it is sure Ms. Peng is truly free of government control. The biggest names in tennis \\u2014 Serena Williams, Naomi Osaka and Novak Djokovic, among many others \\u2014 don\\u2019t seem to be afraid to lose access to a potential market of 1.4 billion tennis fans either. The pushback is problematic because the Winter Olympics in Beijing are just weeks away from opening.\", \"The country\\u2019s huge army of propagandists has failed its top leader Xi Jinping\\u2019s expectations that it take control of the global narrative about China. But it shouldn\\u2019t take all the blame: The failure is ingrained in the controlling nature of China\\u2019s authoritarian system.\", \"\\u201cIt can make Peng Shuai play any role, including putting up a show of being free,\\u201d Pin Ho, a New York-based media businessman, wrote on Twitter.\", \"For Chinese officials in charge of crisis management, he continued, such control is routine. \\u201cBut for the free world,\\u201d he said, \\u201cthis is even more frightening than forced confessions.\\u201d\", \"One of the biggest giveaways that Ms. Peng isn\\u2019t free to speak her mind is that her name remains censored on the Chinese internet.\", \"\\u201cAs long as coverages about her inside and outside China are different, she\\u2019s not speaking freely,\\u201d said Rose Luqiu, an assistant professor of journalism at the Hong Kong Baptist University.\", \"Despite the outpouring of concern about Ms. Peng\\u2019s well-being on Twitter and other online platforms that are blocked in China, the Chinese public has little knowledge of the discussions.\", \"Late Friday night, as the momentum of the hashtag #whereispengshuai was building on Twitter, I couldn\\u2019t find any discussion of the question on Chinese social media. Still, Ms. Peng had clearly caught the attention of politically observant Chinese. I messaged a friend in Beijing who was usually on top of hot topics and asked generally, in coded words, if she had heard about a huge campaign to find someone. \\u201cPS?\\u201d the friend guessed, using Ms. Peng\\u2019s initials.\", \"It\\u2019s hard to estimate how many Chinese people learned about Ms. Peng\\u2019s allegation, which she detailed in a post on Chinese social media earlier this month. Her post \\u2014 which named Zhang Gaoli, a former top Communist Party leader, as her assailant \\u2014 was deleted within minutes. One Weibo social media user asked in a comment whether saving a screenshot of Ms. Peng\\u2019s post was incriminating. Another Weibo user, in a comment, described being too scared to share the post.\", \"They have good reasons to be afraid. Beijing has made it easier to detain or charge people for what they say online. Many people get their social media accounts deleted for simply sharing content that the censors deemed inappropriate, including #MeToo-related content.\", \"China has been bitter about its poor image in the Western mainstream news media and has talked for years about taking control of the narrative. Mr. Xi, the top leader, said that he hoped the country would have the capacity to shape a global narrative that\\u2019s compatible with its rising status in the world. \\u201cTell the China story well,\\u201d he instructed. \\u201cCreate a credible, lovable and respectable image of China.\\u201d\", \"Official media has raised the suggestion that Covid-19 emerged from a lab in the United States and spread the unproven allegation on Facebook and Twitter. China released thousands of videos on YouTube and other Western platforms in which Uyghurs said they were \\u201cvery free\\u201d and \\u201cvery happy\\u201d while the Communist Party was carrying out repressive policies against them and other Muslim ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang region.\", \"In reality, China is less respected, and its narratives less credible, since Mr. Xi took power nine years ago. He cracked down on relatively independent media outlets and eliminated critical online voices within the country. He unleashed diplomats and nationalistic youth who would roar back any hint of criticism or belittlement.\", \"\\u201cThere are three things that are inevitable in life: life, death and humiliating China,\\u201d a reader commented on a recent column of mine.\", \"Despite China\\u2019s relatively fast economic growth and relatively competent response to the pandemic, the country\\u2019s deteriorating human rights records and its uncompromising international stance are not helping its image. The negative views of China in the vast majority of the world\\u2019s advanced economies reached a historic high last year, according to Pew Research Center.\", \"China can\\u2019t respond to the questions about Ms. Peng effectively because it can\\u2019t even address the problem directly. \", \"The subject of Ms. Peng\\u2019s sexual assault allegation, Mr. Zhang, had been one of the Communist Party\\u2019s most powerful officials before he retired. The party sees criticism of a top leader as a direct attack on the whole organization, so it won\\u2019t repeat her allegation. As a result, the state media journalists who are trying to argue that Ms. Peng is fine can\\u2019t even refer to it directly.\", \"For Hu Xijin, the editor of the nationalist Global Times tabloid, the allegation against Mr. Zhang has become \\u201cthe thing.\\u201d \\u201cI don\\u2019t believe Peng Shuai has received retaliation and repression speculated by foreign media for the thing people talked about,\\u201d he wrote on Twitter.\", \"Mr. Zhang can\\u2019t even be discussed online in China. Those who do call him \\u201ckimchi\\u201d because his given name sounds like the name of an ancient Korean dynasty.\", \"If Mr. Hu, China\\u2019s spin master, could speak more plainly, and if the Chinese people had the freedom to discuss Ms. Peng and her allegation, official media might understand how to build a narrative. Instead, Mr. Hu alternates between trying to change the conversation and trying to shut it down completely.\", \"\\u201cFor those who truly care about safety of Peng Shuai, her appearances of these days are enough to relieve them or eliminate most of their worries,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cBut for those aiming to attack China\\u2019s system and boycott the Beijing Winter Olympics, facts, no matter how many, don\\u2019t work for them.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f954883e4c2e11ec87d00b0976b67394"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f954883e4c2e11ec87d00b0976b67394"}},
