One market trader in Paris said he was yet to decide whether to vote for Marine Le Pen or Jean-Luc M\\u00e9lenchon.\", \"Philippe Bridou, a former Socialist voter in south-western city of Perpignan, told the BBC he had switched to the far right because \\\"security is important, immigration is important too because it's a subject now - and the left wing doesn't discuss it\\\".\", \"For many voters, the old stigma of voting for the far right has gone. After she was trounced by Macron in 2017, Le Pen rebranded her National Front as National Rally, even if many of her policies have hardly changed.

Then there are the so-called votes blancs - the ballots left blank as a protest.\", \"Tactical voting may also play a part, if voters decide to back one of the favourites because they have more of a chance of winning than, for example, Greens candidate Yannick Jadot.\", \"The French economy is in decent shape and unemployment has fallen to 7.4 percent, but voters are not feeling the benefit.\", \"That's because prices are going up across the board, at the shops, the market, the petrol pump and in domestic energy bills. The phrase you hear everywhere is pouvoir d'achat - which translates as spending power but is better known in English as the cost of living.\", \"Thierry, who lives outside Paris and runs a shoe stall, says prices have gone through the roof. \\\"The cost of shoes has gone up by 20 to 30 percent and all the taxes have gone up too,\\\" he points out.\", \"That is why many of the candidates are promising to boost the minimum wage, in some cases by hundreds of euros. It's due to go up at the start of May to about \\u20ac1,300 ($NZ2000) a month after tax.\", \"For Marine Le Pen, the spending crunch is also a big opportunity. She has spent less time talking about nationalism and focused more on low wages.\", \"But she still wants a referendum on restricting immigration, she wants to ban the Islamic hijab in public areas and wants radical change to the European Union.\", \"She has distanced herself from Russia's Vladimir Putin, even though she went to see him in 2017, used to admire him and her party is still paying back a Russian loan.\", \"By contrast, voters have been unimpressed with revelations that the Macron government has spent increasing amounts of taxpayers' money on consultants such as US firm McKinsey.\", \"\\\"People are a bit disgusted who gets the money,\\\" said Thierry.\", \"Macron entered the campaign late, with a rousing rally eight days before the vote. While his adversaries were criss-crossing France, he was focusing on diplomacy in Russia's war in Ukraine.\", \"He only got going on his main adversary shortly before campaigning ended, condemning her policies as racist and \\\"very brutal\\\".\", \"The first round will only decide the top two candidates, but already the race is tight.\", \"- BBC\"]","href_hash":"c6232ca6b8f611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c6232ca6b8f611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
