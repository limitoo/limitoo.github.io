No, of course we didn't, but actually overall it's a very good deal for New Zealand,\\\" he said.\", \"Meat Industry Association chair Nathan Guy, a former National MP in John Key's government, said they had been hoping for more access for beef.\", \"\\\"We ended up getting 10,000 tonne over seven years, and the Europeans consume 6.5 million tonnes a year,\\\" he said. \\\"We do know that the Europeans are generally very wealthy - there's 450 million of them that are prepared pay more, basically a premium, for what we produce here in a sustainable way - and unfortunately we didn't get what we asked for.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nzhttps://rnz-ressh.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--9yMVC7iJ--/ar_16:10,c_fill,f_auto,g_auto,q_auto,w_1050/v1643407688/4O6ZR23_image_crop_42805\\\" alt=\\\"Nathan Guy\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nNathan Guy. \\nPhoto: RNZ / Conan Young\\n</div>\", \"But he was philosophical about the deal overall.\", \"\\\"I do also happen to chair Apiculture New Zealand that leads the honey industry, and I know they're celebrating today the signing - particularly with m\\u0101nuka and other honeys coming online in three years' time,\\\" he said. \\\"Certainly for some of the primary sector it's a day of celebration.\\\"\", \"\\\"In terms of sheep meat, we did get a lift in our quota when it was split between the European Union and the UK so that is a small positive - particularly if there are geopolitical issues in the future.\\\"\", \"He also acknowledged the difficulties of getting more access for meat and dairy.\", \"\\\"We do realise that the European Union, a lot of it is very protectionist. If you look at France, they're not very sympathetic to free trade, so I guess the focus now is let's use all of our diplomatic skills to get it shunted across the line.\\\"\", \"Groser was a trade minister in Key's government and told Morning Report the right way to look at the deal was as a step forward.\", \"\\\"I think that's exactly the right way to look at it. Look, we've made a lot of progress in the last 35 years in opening up markets to New Zealand,\\\" he said.\", \"He said the deal also had to be looked at alongside the New Zealand FTA with the United Kingdom, and in the context of \\\"deeply protectionist sentiment\\\" from the EU dairy and meat sectors.\", \"\\\"I'm sure our officials who would have negotiated the deals pushed as hard as they could and got what they can. Overall, certainly not a reason for walking away from it in my opinion.\\\"\", \"The deal would particularly help with diversifying away from New Zealand's reliance on the Chinese market, he said - and that was even true in a limited way for meat.\", \"\\\"The sheep meat deal in the EU deal is actually quite a valuable insurance policy against China turning south on sheep meat, because China's displaced the Europeans as our principal export market.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nzhttps://rnz-ressh.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--PPTmGc7z--/ar_16:10,c_fill,f_auto,g_auto,q_auto,w_1050/v1624946405/4PIMDF4_1M1A1518_9047\\\" alt=\\\"National MP Tim Groser\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nTim Groser.

I believe the overall result is nevertheless worth it for both sides.\\\"\", \"She also highlighted strategic and political gains as being key for the European side.\", \"\\\"The Indo-Pacific, this enormous region of which you are a part of, is the centre of economic gravity, and strengthening our ties with partners in the Indo-Pacific is very important,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"This deal shows that good deals can be made whilst the global trading system is under threat. So this is way more than trade.\\\"\", \"The deal has been praised in some quarters for its inclusion of emissions reduction targets, but Groser said he saw that as political messaging to help get the deal through the European Parliament.\", \"\\\"No New Zealand government's going to walk away from doing the right thing on climate change, we can debate the precise way in which we do it.\", \"\\\"It's sort of, you can't just do trade any longer on a pure trade basis - you have to have a social licence to engage in trade and that's part of that political process as far as I'm concerned.\\\"\", \"The deal is set to remove 91 percent of tariffs on New Zealand goods into the EU from day one of coming into force, eventually rising to 97 percent.\", \"Red meat and dairy are expected to get up to $120 million worth of new annual export revenue on day one, with estimates of more than $600m within seven years.\", \"It is anticipated to enter into force in the first half of 2024 once the final steps of ratification and passing related legislation have been completed.\", \"Obermaier said all signs pointed towards successful ratification.\", \"\\\"The International Trade Committee was in New Zealand last year, was very warmly welcomed and I think there's a lot of goodwill towards New Zealand.\", \"\\\"Member states have already approved the deal two weeks ago - under Swedish presidency - which is also the reason for the PM going to Stockholm later today, and now it will be up to Parliamentarians to give their consent.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"52951a901ee111ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"52951a901ee111ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
