Her third album, \\u201c25,\\u201d sold nearly 3.4 million copies in a single week in the United States, smashing records at a time when CD sales were cratering and streaming had not yet proved itself to be the business\\u2019s savior.\", \"Her newest release, \\u201c30,\\u201d which arrives on Friday, is all but assured to be another blockbuster, though just how big is anybody\\u2019s guess.\", \"Adele\\u2019s label, Columbia, is keeping mum about commercial projections. But the buzz in the business is that the album\\u2019s \\u201cequivalent sales\\u201d figure \\u2014 a new metric that reconciles old-fashioned album purchases with song-by-song clicks on streaming services \\u2014 will easily exceed one million in its first week out, and could go far higher.\", \"No album has done so since Taylor Swift\\u2019s \\u201cReputation,\\u201d four years ago. In fact, since \\u201c25\\u201d came out in late 2015, only four other titles (three by Swift, plus Drake\\u2019s \\u201cViews\\u201d) have had more than half a million full-album sales in a single week. Yet reports in music trade publications \\u2014 neither confirmed nor denied by Sony Music, Columbia\\u2019s corporate parent \\u2014 suggest that up to 500,000 copies of \\u201c30\\u201d on vinyl alone may be ready to go.\", \"A wave of extremely high-profile promotion means that Adele\\u2019s audience has been fully primed. On Sunday, CBS aired \\u201cAdele One Night Only,\\u201d a prime-time concert special, interspersed with interview segments by Oprah Winfrey, which drew 10.3 million viewers \\u2014 just shy of the total for this year\\u2019s Academy Awards. A few weeks ago, Vogue published simultaneous cover stories in its American and British editions.\", \"\\u201cHer core fan base is incredibly wide-ranging,\\u201d said Hannah Karp, the editorial director of Billboard magazine. \\u201cThey still buy albums, still listen to terrestrial radio. That makes it easier to cut through the noise of the ever-growing amount of new music on streaming services.\\u201d\", \"Adele, a 33-year-old North Londoner who has settled in an exclusive enclave in Los Angeles \\u2014 where she is sometimes spotted courtside at basketball games with her boyfriend, the sports agent Rich Paul \\u2014 is that rarest of music unicorns: One who not only lands headline-grabbing hits, but does so after years of inactivity, even near silence, contradicting every unwritten rule of pop-star career management, which these days involves a steady stream of songs and near-constant social media activity.\", \"\\u201cShe defies gravity,\\u201d said Tom Poleman, the chief programming officer of iHeartMedia, the country\\u2019s largest radio chain. \\u201cNo other artist can release a new album after five, six years and have this kind of success.\\u201d\", \"Part of the appeal of Adele\\u2019s music may lie in its consistency. \\u201cEasy on Me,\\u201d her latest single, is textbook Adele, with just piano, bass and a faint bass-drum heartbeat supporting her vocal fireworks. Like \\u201cHello\\u201d before it \\u2014 and \\u201cSomeone Like You\\u201d before that \\u2014 it is a classic torch ballad largely removed from the trends of contemporary pop production, yet it easily landed in heavy rotation on pop radio alongside upbeat, electronic hits like the Kid Laroi\\u2019s \\u201cStay\\u201d and Dua Lipa\\u2019s \\u201cLevitating.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cEasy on Me\\u201d has held at No. 1 on Billboard\\u2019s Hot 100 singles chart for the last four weeks.\", \"On her CBS special, Adele sang outside the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, surrounded by a celebrity audience that included Lizzo, Leonardo DiCaprio and Drake, with postcard-perfect sunset views of the Hollywood Hills. Yet the special seemed to make her relatable even as it rendered her a musical deity.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019s as real, as down-to-earth, as we all believe she is,\\u201d Winfrey said, introducing the performance.\", \"In her interview segments, Adele wore a striking white pantsuit and spoke with disarming candor about her divorce, her late father\\u2019s alcoholism and her experience losing more than 100 pounds through a vigorous training regimen. At points, her lines could scarcely have been written better by a magazine editor, as when she said that this is the first time she has \\u201cloved myself and been open to loving and being loved by someone else.\\u201d\", \"Those paradoxical qualities \\u2014 supreme glamour, salt-of-the-earth approachability \\u2014 are key to Adele\\u2019s connection to her fans, even after years out of the spotlight.\", \"\\u201cPeople see her as an old friend,\\u201d Karp said. \\u201cThe way she banters with an audience between songs, in a very conversational way \\u2014 that only increases her appeal, especially in this world of Instagram, where people are so careful with the image they project.\\u201d\", \"Since \\u201c25,\\u201d Adele has become a streaming star. Like Swift, she was a notable holdout when the format was newer, keeping her full LP off streaming services for months to help maximize sales. Since then, Swift \\u2014 whose protest was more rooted in her discomfort with some services\\u2019 free tiers \\u2014 has released six studio albums, gradually honing her approach to both streaming and sales (hello, merch bundles and vinyl pre-orders).\", \"Adele, on the other hand, is diving headfirst into a vastly changed music business. Streaming now accounts for about 84 percent of recorded music\\u2019s domestic sales revenue, and while vinyl and deluxe CD packages can help push a new album to No. 1, online clicks are usually vital to its success in the long run.\", \"So far, Adele seems to have a strong position. \\u201cEasy on Me\\u201d has been streamed 134 million times in the United States since its release a month ago, according to MRC Data, Billboard\\u2019s tracking arm.\", \"After \\u201c25,\\u201d Adele\\u2019s songs drew 700 million to 800 million streams in the United States each year, even with no new material, according to MRC. Chartmetric, a company that tracks streaming and social media data, found that the playlisting of Adele\\u2019s songs, while growing for years, shot up dramatically as anticipation for \\u201c30\\u201d grew this year. \\u201cEasy on Me\\u201d is on almost 300,000 Spotify playlists, reaching nearly 360 million followers there, according to Chartmetric.\", \"That success spreads to nearly every part of the music industry \\u2014 brick-and-mortar retailers, streaming services and radio stations.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019s the Christmas present you look forward to,\\u201d said Poleman, of iHeartMedia, \\u201cexcept Christmas only comes every five to six years.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"defeebd5479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"defeebd5479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}},
