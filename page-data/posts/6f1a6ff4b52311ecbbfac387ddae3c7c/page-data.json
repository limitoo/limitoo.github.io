Ford and BMW also have recalled batteries in recent years. Additionally, the U.S. National  Transportation Safety Board investigated a series of fires in Tesla  vehicles, saying that the high-voltage lithium-ion batteries posed safety  risks to first responders after crashes.\", \"Many governments are counting on EVs to replace  gasoline-burning vehicles that emit greenhouse gases that cause global  warming.\", \"Data on electric vehicle fires is limited, but a small sample in  April of 2021 by the insurance industry's Highway Loss Data Institute  found that EVs and their conventional gas counterparts had about the  same number of non-crash fire claims per 1,000 insured vehicle years. The institute tracked claims for 10 EVs and their gas equivalents and  found that EVs had 0.19 fire claims per 1,000 insured vehicle years  compared with 0.2 for gasoline counterparts.\", \"In a document posted Tuesday on its website, the NHTSA said the recalls  began on February 24, 2020, when Mercedes recalled a 2019 Smart Fortwo  electric vehicle. The company said the high-voltage battery made by LG  had a defect that could ignite inside the battery cells, raising the  risk of a fire.\", \"Eight months later, Hyundai recalled some 2019 and 2020 Kona EVs with a similar problem.\", \"In November of 2020, General Motors began a string of recalls that  involved more than 140,000 Chevrolet Bolt EVs from the 2017 through 2022  model years due to the \\\"simultaneous presence of two rare manufacturing  defects in the same battery cell.\\\" The defect caused at least 10 fires,  causing GM to warn owners to park the Bolts outdoors. LG Energy  Solution agreed to reimburse GM $2 billion for the recall costs, and the  company remains in a joint venture with LG to build batteries for its  next generation of electric vehicles. This month, GM is scheduled to  restart production and sales of Bolts with replacement battery cells.\", \"Hyundai issued a second battery recall March of 2021 covering 2019  and 2020 Konas and 2020 Ioniq EVs and said an electrical short inside  the batteries could increase the risk of fires while parked, charging or  driving.\", \"Last February, Stellantis' Chrysler brand recalled some 2017 and 2018  Pacifica plug-in hybrid minivans with LG batteries after getting a  dozen reports of fires. A month later, VW recalled some 2021 ID4  electric vehicles with unreliable connections inside the batteries that  could cause stalling. Stellantis also has a joint venture with LG Energy  Solution to make batteries for future electric vehicles.\"]","href_hash":"6f1a6ff4b52311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6f1a6ff4b52311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
