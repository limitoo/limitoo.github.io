A neighbor, William \\\"Roddie\\\" Bryan, joined the pursuit in his own truck and took cellphone video of Travis McMichael shooting Arbery at close range with a shotgun.\", \"More than two months passed before the three men were arrested on charges of murder and other crimes, after the graphic video leaked online and deepened a national reckoning over racial injustice.\", \"Glynn County Police Sergeant Roderic Nohilly told the jury Wednesday he spoke with Greg McMichael at police headquarters a few hours after the shooting. He said Greg McMichael told him Arbery \\\"wasn't out for no Sunday jog. He was getting the hell out of there.\\\"\", \"He told Nohilly he recognized Arbery because he had been recorded by security cameras a few times inside a neighboring home under construction. Greg McMichael said they gave chase to try to stop Arbery from escaping the subdivision.\", \"\\\"He was trapped like a rat,\\\" Greg McMichael said, according to a transcript of their recorded interview Nohilly read in court. \\\"I think he was wanting to flee and he realized that something, you know, he was not going to get away.\\\"\", \"Defense attorneys say the McMichaels and Bryan were legally justified in chasing and trying to detain Arbery because they reasonably thought he was a burglar. Greg McMichael told police Travis McMichael fired in self-defense after Arbery attacked with his fists and tried to grab his son's shotgun.\", \"\\\"He had an opportunity to flee further you know,\\\" Greg McMichael told Nohilly. \\\"We had chased him around the neighborhood a bit, but he wasn't winded at all. I mean this guy was, he was in good shape.\\\"\", \"Prosecutors say the McMichaels and Bryan chased Arbery for five minutes before he was shot in the street after running past the McMichaels' idling truck. Prosecutor Linda Dunikoski has described him as an \\\"avid runner\\\" who lived about 2 miles from the Satilla Shores neighborhood where he was slain.\", \"The first police officer on the scene, Ricky Minshew, testified earlier in the trial that Bryan told him Arbery at one point in the chase stopped to catch his breath and appeared to be \\\"tired of running.\\\"\", \"Jurors were shown graphic, close-up police photos Monday of the gunshot wounds that killed Arbery, while one officer on the scene\\u00a0testified he did not try to render medical aid\\u00a0because it would not have been safe.\", \"In court, Matthew Albenze testified he was splitting logs in his front yard on the day of the shooting when he saw Arbery enter the home under construction across the street.\", \"Albenze testified Wednesday that he went inside his house and put a handgun in his pocket before he called police from behind a tree at the curb. Arbery left the house running toward the McMichaels' home while Albenze was on the phone.\", \"Albenze told the jury he called the police nonemergency number. Dunikoski asked him: Why not 911?\", \"He replied: \\\"I did not see an emergency.\\\"\", \"On the witness stand Wednesday, Nohilly pushed back as one of Greg McMichael's attorneys asked if raising a gun would be an appropriate response to a fleeing suspect who refused verbal commands to stop.\", \"\\\"You'll sometimes draw your weapon, won't you?\\\" attorney Franklin Hogue asked.\", \"Nohilly replied: \\\"I don't just pull my gun.\\\"\", \"Hogue then asked: \\\"At some point, if the person is going to attack you, you'll go ahead and use your weapon.\\\"\", \"\\\"It depends on how he's attacking me,\\\" Nohilly said.\", \"Hogue then asked him what if the attacker is trying to take his gun away.\", \"\\\"At that point it might meet the threshold, yes,\\\" the police sergeant said.\", \"The Rev. Al Sharpton spoke with reporters Wednesday outside the Glynn County courthouse, where he held the hands of Arbery's parents while leading a prayer for justice. Sharpton criticized the \\u00a0disproportionately white makeup of the jury.\", \"Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley allowed the jury to be sworn in last week after prosecutors objected, saying several Black potential jurors were excluded because of their race, leaving only one Black juror on the panel of 12. The county where the trial is being held is nearly 27% Black.\", \"\\\"It's an insult to the intelligence of the American people,\\\" Sharpton said. \\\"If you can count to 12 and only get to one that's Black, you know something's wrong.\\\"\", \"Last week, the trial had an emotional start as\\u00a0Arbery's mother watched graphic video\\u00a0of her son being chased down and killed. She sobbed in court as she watched the video for the first time.\", \"\\\"I decided it was time to see the video to heal my curiosities,\\\" Wanda Cooper-Jones said after the testimony on Friday. \\\"It's very heartbreaking but I've gotten past that part.\\\"\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"3224e366425211ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3224e366425211ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
