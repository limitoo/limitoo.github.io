Broadway has reopened and nearly 80 percent of adults have been vaccinated, but many workers have not returned to offices in Manhattan.\", \"Mr. Adams, a Democrat and the Brooklyn borough president, seemed to sense the challenges that await him on Jan. 1, even as he took a victory lap on Wednesday in a series of national television interviews.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m going to be a mayor that is going to be a G.S.D. mayor: Get Stuff Done,\\u201d Mr. Adams said on MSNBC.\", \"In a phone interview later on Wednesday, he re-emphasized his campaign commitment to improving public safety, citing two examples of what \\u201cgetting stuff done\\u201d would look like in his first 100 days in office. He said he intended to address the crisis at the Rikers jail complex by making some immediate changes like separating gang members, and he would bring back a plainclothes police unit that was disbanded last year.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not anti-crime, but an anti-gun unit,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s having well-trained officers who are going to use their body cameras so that we can see their interactions. They\\u2019re going to specifically zero in on gang and gun violence.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Adams, who ran as a centrist, immediately struck a tone of unity in his acceptance speech on Tuesday and again on Wednesday. He said he had already spoken to union leaders late Tuesday about a contentious vaccine mandate for city workers and wants to work with them \\u2014 and with new Republicans in the City Council.\", \"\\u201cHow do we move our city forward?\\u201d Mr. Adams said on MSNBC on Wednesday morning, adding: \\u201cI\\u2019m going to build those bridges and not blow those bridges up.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Adams, who understands how much of a mayor\\u2019s agenda depends on Albany, from schools funding to the subway\\u2019s revival, had already showed his political savvy by having Gov. Kathy Hochul, a fellow Democrat who faces a primary challenge next year, speak at his election night party.\", \"After years of sparring between Mayor Bill de Blasio and former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the image of a smiling Mr. Adams joining hands in the air with Ms. Hochul in victory seemed to set a very different tone.\", \"Over the next several weeks, Mr. Adams will consider how to fill his administration\\u2019s top posts. He has chosen Sheena Wright, a prominent nonprofit executive, to lead his transition team; is known to have a close inner circle of advisers; and has also been leaning on former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his allies for advice.\", \"Mr. Adams has been focused on two key positions: police commissioner and schools chancellor. He has pledged to hire the city\\u2019s first female police commissioner to address violent crime \\u2014 one of the main issues he ran on \\u2014 and is considering at least two Black women: Juanita Holmes, the department\\u2019s current chief of patrol, and Carmen Best, the former police chief in Seattle, according to a person who is familiar with his thinking. For schools chancellor, Mr. Adams is believed to favor David C. Banks, the president of a network of public prep schools and the partner of Ms. Wright.\", \"Another major unknown is who will be the next City Council speaker \\u2014 a powerful role in New York City government \\u2014 and whether Mr. Adams will seek to influence the wide-open contest for the job. Several of his allies are running for speaker, while other candidates might clash with him on matters where the Council wields power.\", \"Mr. Adams said he hopes that the speaker is someone he can work with, but that he would let the Council do its job of selecting a leader among its 51 members.\", \"\\u201cNo matter who it is, I\\u2019m going to work with them,\\u201d he said.\", \"But first, Mr. Adams will fly to Puerto Rico this week for a prominent gathering of New York elected officials and lobbyists staged by a nonprofit known as Somos. Then he will visit the Dominican Republic.\", \"Mr. Adams, who promoted himself as a blue-collar New Yorker, was criticized by his Republican opponent, Curtis Sliwa, for spending time in Monaco and for fund-raising in the Hamptons and Martha\\u2019s Vineyard. He has also faced questions during the campaign over transparency, where he lives, and his financial dealings.\", \"During his victory speech, Mr. Adams hinted at his flaws, but said that he would work hard to move the city in a new direction.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re going to find some blemishes,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBecause I\\u2019m perfectly imperfect.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Adams will also clearly offer a different style than Mr. de Blasio, who was not known to delight in the city\\u2019s cultural events. After his victory party on Tuesday night, Mr. Adams left for an exclusive soiree at Zero Bond, a private club in downtown Manhattan, with celebrities like the comedian Chris Rock, the actor Forest Whitaker and the rapper Ja Rule and business leaders like Eric Schmidt, the former chief executive of Google, and James Dolan, the owner of the Knicks and Madison Square Garden.\", \"Inside, Mr. Adams, who wore a snazzy blue blazer, was accompanied by his son, Jordan, and the Brooklyn power broker Frank Carone. He gave a seven-minute speech and then moved around the room, taking photos with the guests. Burgers and cheese balls were served, but Mr. Adams stuck to his vegan diet when he finally sat down to eat.\", \"\\u201cThey brought him broccoli, and they served it at the table for him,\\u201d said Corey Johnson, the City Council speaker, who walked out of the event just before 1 a.m. \\u201cEveryone was being a carnivore except Eric Adams.\\u201d\", \"A reporter from The New York Post was allowed in, but The New York Times was turned away.\", \"\\u201cHis words were very powerful,\\u201d Mr. Whitaker said as he posed for pictures on his way out of the club. \\u201cVery honest and very true.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Adams finally emerged from the club at 1:04 a.m. as security began removing the velvet ropes outside the club. The night was not over, Mr. Adams told his team.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re going over to Cipriani\\u2019s,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"6e96a17e3cd811ec8415000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6e96a17e3cd811ec8415000017025a03"}},
