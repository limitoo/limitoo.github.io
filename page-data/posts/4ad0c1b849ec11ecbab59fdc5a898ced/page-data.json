Both our bodies and the planet would be healthier if we ate a plant-focused diet instead.\", \"Vegetarianism in those days was a strange if not heretical way of nourishing oneself. The center of the American dinner plate was reserved for a big pork chop or steak. In the introduction to one edition of \\u201cDiet,\\u201d she recalls promoting the book on a local Pittsburgh TV talk show in the mid-1970s. Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 was booked alongside a U.F.O. expert, and her only question from the host was: \\u201cWhat do you think they eat on U.F.O.s?\\u201d\", \"Going veggie was also a logistical challenge back then. Mollie Katzen, who read \\u201cDiet\\u201d as a 20-year-old college student and later used it as a reference when she helped found the vegetarian Moosewood Restaurant in Ithaca, N.Y., in 1973, out of which came her own hugely influential \\u201cMoosewood Cookbook,\\u201d recalled that many ingredients were not easy to find in supermarkets at the time.\", \"\\u201cThere were no fresh herbs anywhere,\\u201d Ms. Katzen, 71, said in a recent interview. \\u201cPeople didn\\u2019t cut onions. They just used onion powder. You couldn\\u2019t even find a bottle of olive oil \\u2014 it was Wesson cooking oil.\\u201d Adopting a vegetarian regimen was, Ms. Katzen said, \\u201cdefinitely way off Main Street.\\u201d\", \"Flash forward a half century, and Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 has not only lived to see \\u201cDiet\\u201d turn 50 \\u2014 an updated anniversary edition was published in September \\u2014 but to watch her ideas about food and nutrition get adopted by millions of Americans and even spawn marketing buzzwords for the wellness industry. (Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 was \\u201cplant-based\\u201d long before the term existed.)\", \"On a recent afternoon, Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 welcomed a reporter into her home in a leafy town outside Boston to talk about the way we eat, then and now. Despite her success \\u2014 \\u201cDiet\\u201d has sold more than three million copies, and she was named a recipient of the Right Livelihood Award, a kind of alternative Nobel Prize \\u2014 Ms. Lapp\\u00e9, or Frankie to her friends, is a down-to-earth, cheerful woman of 77. She greeted her guest with a warm bowl of Comforting Carrot and Onion Soup, one of the recipes included in \\u201cDiet,\\u201d which she specially prepared that morning.\", \"\\u201cI made this soup for Betty Ballantine,\\u201d Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 said brightly, referring to the book publisher so struck by Ms. Lapp\\u00e9\\u2019s message that she took a chance on commissioning a book by Ms. Lapp\\u00e9, a former community organizer. Up until then, she hadn\\u2019t published so much as a letter to the editor; she has since written 19 more books, on topics including sustaining our democracy to raising children without TV.\", \"Over the years, many people have categorized Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 as a cookbook author or chef, like another of her contemporaries, the food activist Alice Waters. In fact, it was Ms. Ballantine who suggested that Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 include recipes in \\u201cDiet,\\u201d to soften and make more salable what was essentially a political manifesto. Many of the dishes were crowdsourced from friends.\", \"Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 said she has never thought of herself as leading a revolution strictly fought in the produce aisle. As she put it, \\u201cThe reward isn\\u2019t how many vegetarians I created.\\u201d Rather, she is gratified when people come up to her and say, as many have over the years, \\u201cI read your book and it changed my life.\\u201d\", \"If you eat Tofurky this Thanksgiving rather than an actual bird, in a way you can thank Ms. Lapp\\u00e9. The inventor of the plant-based protein, Seth Tibbot, read \\u201cDiet\\u201d and, as he told the makers of a Vice documentary about the future of food, it changed his life. Ethan Brown, the founder of Beyond Meat, is another disciple. And, of course, you could count the author herself among those whose life was radically changed by the ideas within \\u201cDiet.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 was 25 and attending graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley, when she began to question her life\\u2019s purpose. Like many in her generation, she\\u2019d read \\u201cThe Population Bomb,\\u201d the 1968 book by Paul Ehrlich that predicted (wrongly, it turned out) a coming famine because of overpopulation, and she was inspired by the ecological movement that led to the first Earth Day.\", \"Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 was also being exposed to new and different foods, including bulgur and tofu. She started auditing courses on soil science and poring over academic reports in the agricultural library at Berkeley, to better understand the food system and global hunger.\", \"She was surprised by her findings; notably, that over half of the harvested acreage in the United States at the time went to feeding livestock, leaving more than enough food to go around if those resources were redirected. Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 printed up a one-page handout and circulated it around Berkeley. Through a friend of hers, an expanded booklet found its way to Ms. Ballantine.\", \"\\u201cDiet\\u201d was an unlikely best seller, a broadside against the good old hamburger with dry charts on U.S. crop yields and a homespun cover illustration of corn and wheat. But it was published during \\u201ca very idealistic time for American youth,\\u201d Ms. Katzen said, adding, \\u201ca lot of college students like me were searching for an alternative way to live that was less impactful on the earth. There was also this idea of the personal is political. Her book filled in the blanks.\\u201d\", \"Today, a similar desire for personal and planetary health pervades the culture. There\\u2019s been such a consciousness shift around food that fast-food restaurants are serving plant-based burgers, and climate change activists are once again calling for cutting consumption of beef, though for different reasons, including its outsize impact on greenhouse gas emissions.\", \"Surveying the current landscape, Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 mentioned with approval the proliferation of community and school gardens and the thousands of farmers\\u2019 markets around the country. \\u201cThese didn\\u2019t exist\\u201d 50 years ago, she said.\", \"But Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 is troubled by the way healthy eating has become an elitist activity, saying of $12 green smoothies, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what I\\u2019m about at all.\\u201d She\\u2019s also ambivalent about plant-based meats made in a lab: While they contribute less to climate change, they are not a solution to fixing our broken food system, she said.\", \"\\u201cIt keeps processed foods as our staple,\\u201d Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 said. \\u201cThe answer is healthy foods that come directly from the earth, or as close as possible.\\u201d\", \"Nowadays people seem to eat much better, and much worse. Processed foods loaded with sugar dominate the supermarket shelves, and nearly 1 in 7 Americans now have diabetes. \\u201cFood is life itself \\u2014 and we\\u2019ve turned it into a killer,\\u201d Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s jaw-dropping.\\u201d\", \"Her daughter, Anna Lapp\\u00e9, 47, who is carrying on her mother\\u2019s work as an author and sustainable food advocate, said that when she thinks of her childhood home, \\u201cI can picture tall glass Mason jars filled with beans and lentils.\\u201d\", \"The family shopped in bulk at a food co-op, and Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 cooked simple, healthy dishes like the carrot soup, freezing the leftovers for quick weeknight meals. Fifty years later, Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 still cooks that way. (And she still has the inner glow of a health food devotee.)\", \"But while the family lived in crunchy Berkeley, it must be said that Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 was no hippie. She grew up in a literal cow town, Fort Worth, where she was a football cheerleader, and her activism took root at her small Quaker college, Earlham. Her stylish, put-together appearance on TV and in college auditoriums made it hard to dismiss her as a California kook or scold. As Ms. Lapp\\u00e9\\u2019s Twitter bio states, she has always viewed herself as \\u201chope monger.\\u201d (\\u201cIt gets more challenging every year,\\u201d she said with a laugh.)\", \"Sitting in her kitchen, with its same glass jars of grains and beans on the shelves, Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 reflected on her long-ago conversion. \\u201cNot eating meat, I call it my act of rebel sanity,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt was like opening the door. The world of taste, color, texture is in the plant world. I tell people, it wasn\\u2019t a sacrifice. It was a discovery.\\u201d\", \"Which brings us around to her final hamburger, in 1971. Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 was expecting her first child. As she put it, \\u201cwomen who are pregnant get certain cravings,\\u201d so she found her way to a joint called the Smokehouse. Munching on a charbroiled burger, Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 looked up, and there, walking through the door, was the man who was helping her edit her book.\", \"\\u201cThe most embarrassing moment of my life,\\u201d Ms. Lapp\\u00e9 said laughing again. \\u201cI felt like such a fake. I was so humiliated. And that was my last meat.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4ad0c1b849ec11ecbab59fdc5a898ced"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4ad0c1b849ec11ecbab59fdc5a898ced"}},
