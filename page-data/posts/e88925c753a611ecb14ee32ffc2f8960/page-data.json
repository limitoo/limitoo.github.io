COVID-19 infections, which were more likely to be serious in those who had not been vaccinated.\", \"\\\"The situation in our country is serious,\\\" Ms Merkel told reporters in Berlin, calling the measure an \\\"act of national solidarity\\\".\", \"She said officials also agreed to require masks in schools, impose new limits on private meetings and aim for 30 million vaccinations by the end of the year \\u2014\\u00a0an effort that will be boosted by allowing dentists and pharmacists to administer the shots.\", \"Ms Merkel herself backed the most contentious proposal of imposing a general
