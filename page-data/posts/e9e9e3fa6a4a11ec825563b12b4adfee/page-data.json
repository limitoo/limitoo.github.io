The eight-part \\u201cAround the World,\\u201d a zippy take on the Verne story, will premiere on Jan. 2 on PBS\\u2019s \\u201cMasterpiece.\\u201d (In Britain, it debuted on Dec. 26, on BBC 1.)\", \"There have been many film and television productions inspired by Verne\\u2019s novel, most notably Michael Todd\\u2019s 1956 version starring David Niven, which won an Academy Award for best picture and included cameos by No\\u00ebl Coward, Marlene Dietrich, Frank Sinatra and Buster Keaton, among others. A less faithful version, from 2004, featured Jackie Chan as the story\\u2019s (originally French) valet, Passepartout.\", \"But this version is tailored to contemporary sensibilities, introducing a diverse cast of characters. An ambitious young journalist, Abigail Fortescue (Leonie Benesch), and an updated version of Passepartout (played by the Black French actor Ibrahim Koma) share the limelight with Phileas Fogg (Tennant), the buttoned-up Englishman whose initial ideas about the world are based on a colonial-era vision typified by our grand hotel surroundings.\", \"\\u201cWe are in the world of 1872; it\\u2019s very much of the time,\\u201d Tennant said. \\u201cBut the show looks at the social mores and expectations of the era with a 21st-century lens.\\u201d\", \"The series begins in a stodgy men's social club in London, the Reform Club, where Fogg reads an article describing a recently finished Indian railway line that makes it theoretically possible to traverse the globe in 80 days. Goaded by a hostile fellow member, he bets a considerable sum (around $3 million today) that he can make it back to the club 80 days later, by 1 p.m. on Christmas Eve.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a fabulous setup, the man taking a bet, then racing against obstacles and time,\\u201d the series\\u2019s lead writer, Ashley Pharoah (\\u201cLife on Mars\\u201d), said. \\u201cA screenwriter is always desperate for that kind of great premise.\\u201d But the new series is \\u201cmore of a reimagining than an adaptation,\\u201d he added. In this version, Abigail \\u2014 whose byline is Abigail Fix, using her mother\\u2019s maiden name \\u2014 writes the newspaper article that prompts the bet from Fogg. Despite opposition from Fogg and from her father (Jason Watkins), who owns the newspaper, she decides to chronicle Fogg\\u2019s journey; together with Fogg and Passepartout, who is given a more complex back story and emotional trajectory than in the book, she forms part of an unlikely trio of adventurers.\", \"\\u201cWe wouldn\\u2019t have made a version with three white middle-aged men going around the world because we wanted it to resonate and connect with a modern audience,\\u201d said Simon Crawford-Collins, an executive producer of the show. \\u201cIt felt like a very natural thing to make the change to a more diverse setting that was still faithful to the era.\\u201d\", \"The writers also added cameo characters from history like the legendary Bass Reeves (Gary Beadle), who escaped slavery and became a deputy U.S. marshal, and the famed English beauty Jane Digby (Lindsay Duncan).\", \"\\u201cShe was an aristocrat and fantastic personality who had scandalous affairs with all sorts of people and married a sheikh,\\u201d said Steve Barron, who directed five episodes and helped develop story lines. \\u201cShe would have been about 54 at the time, on Fogg\\u2019s path, and he would have been appalled by her, so it felt like a great way to bring out more of his character.\\u201d\", \"Viewers familiar with Verne\\u2019s novel will recognize the name Fix, which Abigail adopts as a way to distance herself from her father \\u2014 the name a nod, as Pharoah described it, to the \\u201crather boring\\u201d Detective Fix in the book. But the inspiration for Abigail Fix, he said, was the American writer Nellie Bly, who emulated Verne\\u2019s voyage in 1890. (She did it in 72 days.) Making Passepartout a Frenchman of color \\u201cfelt natural,\\u201d he added. \\u201cAs a writer, it gives you much more to play with when there are three of them, with such different personal histories.\\u201d\", \"For Benesch, who is German, and Koma, who is French, these were their first major roles in English \\u2014 and Benesch\\u2019s first role playing a native English speaker. \\u201cAnd Abigail talks and talks!\\u201d Benesch said with a laugh in a telephone interview. (Benesch\\u2019s British accent is cut-glass perfection.)\", \"Abigail Fix, she said, is \\u201coutside of societal convention but with real precedents.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI think her motivation comes from a very deep need to prove to her father, to herself and to society that she is a good and worthy journalist,\\u201d she continued, \\u201cdespite her sex and age.\\u201d\", \"Koma said that he was struck, when approached for the role, that Passepartout was a Black man who is a central character. \\u201cI thought it was audacious, and I was intrigued,\\u201d he said in a telephone interview.\", \"\\u201cIn the book, the characters don\\u2019t really evolve, but in our series there are real evolutions,\\u201d he added. \\u201cFor Passepartout, the challenge is to deal with his life, to trust people, because when you are Black there are always presumptions. As he goes through that journey, he becomes more able to take that risk.\\u201d\", \"When directing the actors, Barron said he had tried to achieve a balance between the fantastical adventures of the story and striking a more realistic tone. \\u201cI felt there hadn\\u2019t been a definitive new version that said, \\u2018This is the spirit of Jules Verne\\u2019 and felt more contemporary without being too theatrical or broad,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou can get into a jokey kind of pantomime with the story, but I wanted to create something audiences could relate to.\\u201d\", \"Tennant said that he hadn\\u2019t watched the 1956 movie. \\u201cDavid Niven has such flair, and there was a danger I would try to emulate that, and it might not be relevant to this version,\\u201d he said. The Fogg of the book is \\u201ca rather unknowable, Zen-like character,\\u201d he added. \\u201cHe is utterly inscrutable and unpanicked, and if he has an emotional life, it\\u2019s deeply hidden. Whereas my Fogg is full of insecurity and failure and is not heroic at all. The others are the heroes.\\u201d\", \"Fogg\\u2019s emotional journey is, in fact, the heart of this new adaptation, Tennant said in a follow-up telephone interview in mid-December. \\u201cFor the character, it\\u2019s a journey around the world and into the soul,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHe is a man of privilege who is terribly frightened by life, and the whole thing is a white-knuckle ride into the unknown for him.\\u201d\", \"And, Tennant added, \\u201cwe worked hard on the thrills and spills.\\u201d\", \"The narrative arc of the show was shaped by the route the travelers follow, Pharoah said, traveling east from Europe to Yemen, India, Hong Kong, the Pacific and to the West and East coasts of the United States before heading back to London. (Apart from brief scenes shot in London, filming took place in South Africa, which stood in for the \\u201chot countries,\\u201d Pharoah explained, and Romania, which was used for Europe and North American scenes.)\", \"\\u201cThe research was often about finding something that was actually happening in that year in those countries,\\u201d Pharoah said, referring to 1872. Real historical events were used to build plotlines, he explained, which include uprisings in Paris, \\u201cpolitical shenanigans\\u201d in India and one in which Bass Reeves takes a white prisoner to trial.\", \"\\u201cEach episode is in a different country and has a discrete story line, so they are almost like mini-films,\\u201d Pharoah said. \\u201cIt was very ambitious for television because from a design perspective, you had to create every episode from scratch.\\u201d\", \"When it was suggested that telling a story set in colonial Britain might be a sensitive issue today, Tennant said that from a 21st-century perspective, \\u201cyou have to acknowledge it\\u2019s not something to celebrate.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cThat\\u2019s part of Fogg\\u2019s journey I think \\u2014 realizing that the world he lives in isn\\u2019t necessarily the world as it should be. And you have Passepartout looking at it all with a raised eyebrow, another lens on colonial history. I think people will go, this is a time in history we have mixed feelings about.\\u201d\", \"Then he grinned, settled back in his chair and looked around the beautiful garden. \\u201cBut everyone loves a period drama!\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e9e9e3fa6a4a11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e9e9e3fa6a4a11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
