Greg McMichael was acquitted for malice murder but found guilty on the other eight charges. Bryan was acquitted for malice murder and one count of felony murder but found guilty on the other seven charges.\", \"The three men had been accused of chasing Arbery with their pickup trucks and killing him with a 12-gauge shotgun in the Satilla Shores neighborhood outside Brunswick, Georgia.\", \"The most serious of the charges is malice murder, which carries a life sentence or the death penalty. The state chose not to seek the latter in this case.\", \"The McMichaels and Bryan were also charged with felony murder, which means someone died while an individual was committing a felony, even if the murder was not planned. Thus, even though Travis McMichael pulled the trigger in the fatal shooting, the other two men would be guilty of felony murder if the jurors decided they were involved in the crime. Felony murder is also punishable by life in prison.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938631/ahmaud-arbery-travis-mcmichael-verdict-murder.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A demonstrator holds a sign at the Glynn County Courthouse on October 18 as jury selection begins in the Ahmaud Arbery shooting death trial in Brunswick, Georgia.</div>\", \"All three of them pleaded not guilty to the nine counts. Over two weeks, their defense attorneys each made a similar case, saying that their clients wanted to make a citizen's arrest and alleging that Travis McMichael was forced to fire his gun in an act of self-defense.\", \"The prosecution and Arbery's family and supporters argued that the young man, who was reportedly jogging at the time of the incident, was targeted for being Black. Arbery's name and image became a rallying point during the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020.\", \"During the trial, race emerged as a focal point in the case, not only in the courtroom but outside the courthouse as well. Halfway through the trial, hundreds of Black pastors traveled to Georgia to rally with Arbery's family in response to complaints from Bryan's attorney, Kevin Gough, about the number of Black pastors seen accompanying the Arbery family in the courtroom gallery during the trial.\", \"Gough filed several motions for mistrial, alleging that prominent figures like the Reverend Al Sharpton and Jesse Jackson would influence the jury. He received widespread criticism after telling the court, \\\"We don't want any more Black pastors coming in here.\\\"\", \"The judge denied all of Gough's motions, saying he would not issue a blanket exclusion on who could attend the trial.\"]","href_hash":"427377c24d5711ec969cf326d5caa64b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"427377c24d5711ec969cf326d5caa64b"}},
