These are incorrect,\\\" NRHCC Clinical Director, Dr Anthony Jordan told Newshub on Tuesday.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We can confirm there are no reports of any such events occurring.\\\"\", \"Multiple sources who were at the event told Newshub the claims were \\\"nonsense\\\" and did not occur.\\u00a0\", \"St John ambulance also told Newshub they were not called to the North Shore vaccination centre on Monday.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"St John was not called to the Vaccination Centre that's located at Eventfinda Stadium in Wairau Valley on Monday.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We did respond to a call to an unrelated medical incident within the facility's gym at 10.23am.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"One ambulance responded and treated one patient who was taken to Northshore Hospital in a minor condition,\\\" a St John spokeswoman said.\", \"One of those spreading the claim is former TV host Liz Gunn, who was filmed questioning a One News reporter why she wasn't reporting on the rumour.\", \"In the video, Gunn grabs the reporter's arm before asking: \\\"Have you heard that five kids have\\u2026 because I used to work at One News\\u2026 have you heard five kids have collapsed this morning? Have you heard that and are you going to report that on One News.\\\"\", \"\\\"I used to sit next to Simon Dallow on the One News desk and I just can\\u2019t believe you guys are not reporting the full story. Why would you be hiding something like five kids collapsing?\\\"\", \"Newshub contacted Gunn to ask if she had any evidence to support her claim five children collapsed.\", \"She did not give any evidence or say where she heard the rumour, instead responding with an angry, conspiratorial rant.\", \"\\\"I do have something powerful to say William but since you were irresponsible enough to go to print with your government approved hit piece on me without waiting to talk to me, I will not be saying it to you.\", \"\\\"Please go to print with that statement verbatim ( means quoting ALL words William that I have said here) ...\", \"\\\"Of course, that would not fit with the current zeitgeist of your sorry Newshub outift which, through this covid propaganda-led nightmare, has appeared to be to seek to discredit any who hold deep concerns about this current government's very dubious and, to many Kiwis, dangerous policies.\\\"\", \"\\\"Shameful man.
