taken aback by the sheer volume of vacancies.\\u00a0\", \"According to the ABS's seasonally adjusted data estimates for the three months to August, there were 333,700 job vacancies in Australia \\u2014\\u00a0a whopping 46.5 per cent increase since February 2020, before the pandemic hit.\", \"Last week Seek announced that October had seen the most job ads posted in a single month in its 23-year history.\", \"The ABS's head of Labour Statistics, Bjorn Jarvis, said he was among those caught off-guard by the shift.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What's driving the\\u00a0growth?</div>\", \"Mr Jarvis says the increase in vacancies is probably not being caused by the so-called \\\"great resignation\\\" phenomenon being talked about overseas, where millions of workers are quitting their jobs.\", \"\\\"In the Labour Force Survey, every quarter we ask respondents a question about whether they expect to be with their employer or their business in 12 months' time,\\\" he said.\\\"It was a little over 9\\u00a0per cent\\u00a0[who thought they were likely to change jobs]\\u00a0in February of 2020, and a little over 9\\u00a0per cent\\u00a0in August 2021,\\\" he said.\", \"Instead, he said employers were putting staffing challenges down to a drop in the number of applicants and the inability of skilled migrants to fly into the country.\", \"According to the ABS's August quarter data, healthcare and social assistance had the most job vacancies, with 51,200 positions up for grabs.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Shortage takes toll on workers</div>\", \"The National Skills Commission, which uses online data scraping technology, lists positions for registered nurses as the fourth most commonly advertised\\u00a0in Australia in September.\", \"There were 7,900 positions advertised.\", \"Irene McInerney, a 58-year-old registered nurse who works in aged care in Hobart,\\u00a0says her Linkedin account has been flooded with ads.\", \"\\\"I'm very employable,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"I could move absolutely anywhere in the state because such is the desperation.\\\"\", \"Ms McInerney,\\u00a0a union member, said she believed the labour shortage was taking its toll.\", \"\\\"Our responsibility levels are going up on a month-by-month basis and we are not getting remunerated accordingly,\\\" she said.\", \"Australian Nursing and Midwifery Association federal secretary Annie Butler\\u00a0put the large number of nursing vacancies down to population increases over time, poor workforce planning, and COVID-19, which had restricted domestic and international movement.\", \"Ms Butler said she did not have hard data on how many of the union's 300,000 plus members had resigned because of vaccine mandates, but believed it would only be in the hundreds.\", \"\\\"That's happened more in places that haven't had COVID outbreaks,\\\" she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/03b41e93b5aab4279331f799004e6c29\\\"

border in the West Australian town of\\u00a0Kununurra, the not-for-profit Ewin Childcare Centre has had to cut\\u00a0childcare by a day a week for most families.\", \"<img

to\\u00a0work fewer\\u00a0hours.\", \"She said that was \\\"obviously causing\\u00a0them emotional and financial stress\\\" as well as impacting their employers.\", \"A June ABS survey of employers found 18 per cent believed \\\"pay conditions\\\" were a reason they were finding it hard to find suitable staff,\\u00a0but Ms Atwell said the salaries she was offering were well above the award rate.\", \"\\\"Our room leaders hold a Diploma in Education and Care,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"That's a two-year TAFE course, so [the work is] full-time and we pay them $90 000 a year.\", \"\\\"I would
