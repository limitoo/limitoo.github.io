It was also predominantly run by men.\", \"A notable exception was Ruth Polsky, who arranged concerts for cutting-edge rock artists, like the Smiths and New Order, at the influential Manhattan clubs Hurrah and Danceteria, whose regulars included Madonna and Jean-Michel Basquiat.\", \"Polsky had a knack for finding young talent, and helped both clubs earn a reputation for debuting new artists. Early in their careers, British bands like the Cure and the Specials played American shows at Hurrah, and Madonna performed one of her first-ever live shows at Danceteria, in 1982.\", \"Polsky\\u2019s choice of artists was diverse. She booked guitar-driven bands like Echo and the Bunnymen, influential minimalists like Young Marble Giants and challenging genre-busters like Einst\\u00fcrzende Neubauten and the Birthday Party, fronted by Nick Cave.\", \"There were potent, female-led groups, including Au Pairs, a politically-fuelled band from Birmingham, England, and kitschy Pulsallama from New York. She was an early supporter of Ru Paul, who performed with bands in the 1980s. (Ru Paul was occasionally referred to by a friend as Ru Polsky.)\", \"Polsky also arranged the United States premieres of alternative rock bands, many from the United Kingdom, including New Order, the Psychedelic Furs and Simple Minds, whose music eventually became mainstream soundtracks of the 1980s.\", \"\\u201cThis is the place where anything goes,\\u201d Polsky said about Danceteria in a British television interview in the mid-1980s, \\u201cfrom oompah bands to Diamanda Gal\\u00e1s to the funkiest thing happening on the street.\\u201d\", \"Her inclusive approach welcomed a clientele from all over the city, one that was racially diverse and of varying socioeconomic backgrounds. She turned her clubs into a hub for nonconformists, some of whom, like the actress Debi Mazar and the Beastie Boys, became famous.\", \"\\u201cIt was kind of weirdos unite,\\u201d said Cynthia Sley, a member of Bush Tetras, whom Polsky booked several times. \\u201cEverybody who was an outcast from regular society would converge down there.\\u201d\", \"Her interactions with musicians went well beyond a professional obligation.\", \"\\u201cShe was good at her job, and she had people power,\\u201d Bernard Sumner, a member of the band New Order, said in an interview. \\u201cShe could handle people and charm them over.\\u201d\", \"And her dealings with performers didn\\u2019t end when the shows were over; she often invited them to her West Houston Street apartment to mingle with other musicians.\", \"\\u201cIt was like a writers\\u2019 salon, but for punk rockers,\\u201d said Hugo Burnham, a founding member of Gang of Four, a taut British band who played several shows that Polsky booked. \\u201cShe was the punk rock Dorothy Parker.\\u201d\", \"Her style was enhanced by the sort of devotion a loyal friend would show. It was a \\u201cmixture of strength and a kind of sisterly, kind of motherly instinct,\\u201d said Johnny Marr, a former member of the Smiths, whose first American show was at Danceteria.\", \"\\u201cYou could stay up until 4 o\\u2019clock in the morning with her,\\u201d he added, \\u201cbut then she would make sure that you went out and had a decent breakfast and a warm coat.\\u201d\", \"Part of her drive came from frequently being the only woman in the room, interacting with managers, booking agents and club owners who were mostly men.\", \"\\u201cShe wanted to show that she could make a difference as a woman in a very male-dominated world,\\u201d said Howard Thompson, a former record company executive and a friend of Polsky\\u2019s.\", \"Ruth Rachel Polsky was born on Dec. 5, 1954, in Toms River, N.J., to Louis and Bertha (Rudnick) Polsky. Her father was an egg distributor, her mother a homemaker. From a young age, Ruthie, as she was called, was an excellent student. By the time she was a teenager, her love of books and writing was matched only by an obsession with music. Her taste, even then, was precocious: In high school, she saw the Doors and Led Zeppelin play live.\", \"Polsky attended Clark University in Massachusetts, where she wrote about music for the school paper. She earned a degree in English literature in 1976 and began writing for Aquarian Weekly, an alternative newspaper in New Jersey, covering up-and-coming music as a contributing editor. She also worked at a magazine publishing company.\", \"In her writing, she championed innovative sounds and encouraged fans to support them.\", \"\\u201cRight now, people need to dance,\\u201d she wrote in Aquarian Weekly in 1979, \\u201cnot the well-oiled, machine-like dancing of a bland, conformist half-decade, but the individualistic style of a crazy new era.\\u201d\", \"That year, she started booking bands at Hurrah, a club near Lincoln Center, alongside another well-known promoter, Jim Fouratt. Three years later, she moved to Danceteria, a multilevel space in the Flatiron district.\", \"Before long her impact began reaching well beyond New York City. In 1981, Polsky took a handful of American bands, including Bush Tetras, to London to perform for the first time in England. The show was called \\u201cTaking Liberties From New York.\\u201d\", \"In the United States, bands were able to use the money they earned from the concerts Polsky had arranged to go on national tours, furthering their exposure and success.\", \"\\u201cPeople in Columbus and Madison and Seattle and Minneapolis could see these bands that normally wouldn\\u2019t be able to tour America,\\u201d said Robert Vickers, a former member of the Go-Betweens, an Australian band that played several shows arranged by Polsky. \\u201cIt made it possible for these cutting-edge bands, the post-punk bands, that Americans in these smaller cities would never have seen except for Ruth.\\u201d\", \"By the summer of 1986, Ms. Polsky had started her own company, S.U.S.S. \\u2014 for Solid United States Support, a nod to a colloquial British term for astutely figuring something out \\u2014 to help artists from abroad navigate their careers in America. She was managing bands, too, and writing a memoir about her nightlife adventures.\", \"Polsky died on Sept. 7, 1986, when she was hit by an out-of-control taxi outside the Limelight, a Manhattan club where she had arranged for one of her clients, Certain General, to play that evening. She was 31.\", \"\\u201cIt just seemed like such an awful waste,\\u201d Mr. Sumner said, \\u201cbecause she was on an upward trajectory.\\u201d\", \"As alternative music was gaining in popularity, that path might well have included working directly with superstars, her ultimate goal.\", \"\\u201cShe had the smarts, she had the passion, she had the good taste and she had the nurturing qualities,\\u201d said Mr. Marr of the Smiths. \\u201cShe was tough and really ticked all the boxes to have been really successful with a band.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ea86ef1c48bf11ec95622502da624544"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ea86ef1c48bf11ec95622502da624544"}},
