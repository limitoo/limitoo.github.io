This compares with an overall surplus of about $70m in earlier years,\\\" it said.\", \"The report said 43 schools had working capital deficits, about half as many as in previous years.\", \"The good results were achieved despite a significant loss of income.\", \"As previously reported schools lost about $170m from the combined effect of the government's donation scheme and the pandemic preventing fund-raising events and reducing foreign student income.\", \"\\\"Total locally raised funds for 2020 was $390m, compared to $520m in 2019.

Without the same level of Covid-19 support funding as in 2020, there is a risk that more schools get into financial difficulty in 2021,\\\" the report said.\", \"Meanwhile, the report said auditors had warned 10 schools about hospitality and entertainment expenses that seemed excessive, and three schools and travel-related expenditure.\", \"It also singled out some schools' spending.\", \"\\\"The board of Papatoetoe North School gifted several hardware items costing $4310 to the principal of the school as a leaving gift and paid for a farewell event costing $8695.
