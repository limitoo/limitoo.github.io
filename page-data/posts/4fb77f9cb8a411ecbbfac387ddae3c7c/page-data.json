People are living in the rubble of what was their normal lives with nothing to their name, faced with cold, harsh conditions, with little or no food. So humanitarian support such as we are providing ... is essential.\\\"\", \"But while fighting there may have stopped, missiles were still \\\"raining down\\\" on the city, making it unsafe.\", \"Seawright said with many trucks bringing aid into the country - and at least one plane of medical supplies - a lot of organisation was involved.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/115719/four_col_Mike_Seawright_2.jpg?1609280913\\\" alt=\\\"Mike Seawright from ReliefAid\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nMike Seawright. \\nPhoto: Supplied\\n</div>\", \"\\\"It also takes a lot of management on the fly. So we've predefined plans ... but of course what happens on the day is entirely dependent on checkpoints we can't control, road conditions on roads that have been severely damaged ... and a security situation that is extremely volatile. So this is our number eight wire - managing all of this.\\\"\", \"His team also wants to deliver aid to people in the besieged city of Mariupol.\", \"\\\"We are standing by to get in there as soon as conditions allow. We pride ourselves on being at the forefront of humanitarian action. ReliefAid is a warzone specialist humanitarian aid organisation but I have to say, even we can't get access to Mariupol at the moment.\\\"\", \"As soon as an access corridor was established, they would be in, Seawright said.\", \"Being on the ground was key to working effectively, he said.\", \"\\\"It takes a lot of hard working, a lot of networking, a lot of managing logistics, but I'm proud to say we've got an incredible team here in Ukraine allowing us to do that.\", \"\\\"The most important thing you need to do when engaging with a new environment is see what is happening on the ground. We've got to know who we are supporting. We have got to make sure we know what their needs are and therefore we need to make sure the support that we receive by generous kiwis in New Zealand and across the world is going to the right place.\", \"\\\"You can't do this from a desk in New Zealand, you can't do this by reading a report.
