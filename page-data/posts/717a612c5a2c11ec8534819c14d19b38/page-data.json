While police have connected him to at least six rapes, authorities suspect he may have attacked women in other parts of the state as well.\", \"Police arrested Garcia on October 5 and charged him 14 felonies on Friday. The felony charges include forcible rape, attempted murder, kidnapping, assault, sodomy and oral copulation, KNBC reported. He has pleaded not guilty and is currently being held without bail. If convicted, he faces life in prison.\", \"The Riverside County District Attorney's office said that Garcia attacked six women in Coachella Valley between September 2020 and August 2021.\", \"The Indio Police Department said Garcia would often approach women, walking alone on the street in the middle of the night, while he drove in one of two white trucks that he used for work: a white Chevy Silverado and a white Dodge Ram.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949714/jose-manuel-martinez-garcia-rapist-murder-california.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">An accused rapist named Jose Manuel Martinez Garcia has also been accused of attempted murder along with rapes in California.

One woman hit by his truck was left in a ditch with a broken leg.

His lawn and pool work caused him to travel outside of the Coachella Valley region, and some of his accusers lived outside of the region as well, KESQ reported.\", \"Police have asked for the public's help to identify more of Garcia's victims.\", \"Garcia is a Mexican native and Coachella resident. He previously lived in Bakersfield, California. In 2010, he was convicted of driving on a suspended license in Orange County, according to John Hall, a spokesperson for the Riverside County district attorney's office.\", \"In 2019, Coachella residents reported nine rapes, according to City Data, a website that sources statistical data about North American cities from public and private sources.
