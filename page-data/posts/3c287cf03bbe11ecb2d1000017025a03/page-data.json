These days, those goals include being \\u201ccarbon neutral\\u201d by 2040.\", \"The equipment manufacturer Caterpillar, Texas Instruments, Exxon Mobil and the Walt Disney Company have all made similar claims about the sustainability of their operations and have set objectives to reduce emissions.\", \"But something is missing from these lofty corporate goals: any accounting of significant emissions from their supply chains or waste from their products. For some companies, those can total as much as 95 percent of their overall contributions to greenhouse gases.\", \"A closer look at corporate America\\u2019s claims that it\\u2019s accelerating efforts to tackle the climate crisis \\u2014 made in marketing and investor presentations \\u2014 reveals that many of these assertions remain quite limited and fail to make a dent in the largest source of carbon emissions: the global supply chains that power the modern economy and have become dinner-table conversation amid massive disruptions this year.\", \"Emissions from supply chains and waste are \\u201chugely important,\\u201d said Tom Cumberlege, an associate director at The Carbon Trust, which works with companies, governments and others to create carbon-reducing plans. \\u201cAny company that isn\\u2019t measuring the full value chain is not coming to grips with a key piece of their impact.\\u201d\", \"Corporations are again highlighting their role as responsible environmental stewards as the United Nations\\u2019 annual global warming conference in Glasgow begins. Heads of state, diplomats and activists are meeting in person to set new targets for cutting emissions from fossil fuels in the hopes of preventing the average global temperature from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius compared with levels before the Industrial Revolution. Failure to do so could lead to catastrophic consequences from global warming, scientists warn.\", \"But despite their pledges to help, many companies are still taking steps that reduce carbon in the most minimal ways. These include installing solar panels at headquarters, designing more energy efficient stores, and tracking commuting and business travel by their employees.\", \"But emissions from the factories that make the sneakers sold on e-commerce websites or from the farms that produce the meat and milk sold on grocery shelves continue to grow in some cases.\", \"That poses challenges to consumers who want to spend money on sustainable goods and services and to investors who increasingly are looking to finance companies that are helping, not hurting, the planet.\", \"Angel Hsu, an assistant professor at the University of North Carolina and founder of the Data-Driven EnviroLab, created a database using corporate climate disclosures and other sources and found 1,858 companies out of 2,000 have either pledged or committed to become net zero. But only 210 of the companies reported emissions from supply chains or consumer waste.\", \"In another analysis, Professor Hsu found that roughly two-thirds of the companies that said they were on track to meet emission-reduction targets set for 2030 had set low or unambitious targets. \\u201cI\\u2019m generally skeptical of a company that says it has achieved or overachieved its targets at this point,\\u201d Professor Hsu said.\", \"Amazon said emissions from indirect sources, for example, increased 15 percent in 2020 from the previous year. The company has pointed out that when its emissions are measured relative to its booming sales, its carbon footprint has been decreasing. But some climate experts say this calculation, called carbon intensity, obscures the fact that the company is still generating an increasing amount of carbon.\", \"\\u201cThe planet doesn\\u2019t care about carbon intensity,\\u201d said Roland Geyer, a professor of industrial ecology at the University of California, Santa Barbara, \\u201cThe climate is being hurt by absolute emissions.\\u201d\", \"Walmart said it is difficult to accurately measure carbon contributions from its many suppliers, and the company does not disclose whether total emissions in its supply chain have been increasing or declining each year. The company said about 95 percent of the carbon emissions related to its business comes from its supply chain.\", \"The retailer said that it has set a voluntary emissions reduction goal for its suppliers and that about 1,500 companies have reported progress toward the goal.\", \"But Walmart has stopped short of requiring suppliers to reduce emissions. Rather if they report certain levels of progress, Walmart awards them with labels such as \\u201cGiga-Gurus\\u201d and \\u201cSparking Change Suppliers\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe have internal dashboards showing which suppliers are participating and who the leaders are,\\u201d said Zach Freeze, a senior director of strategic initiatives and sustainability at Walmart. \\u201cMerchants are competitive. They want to be on the leaderboard.\\u201d\", \"An increasing number of companies are trying to quantify the problem. The number of companies voluntarily submitting their emission reports and reduction goals to the Science Based Targets initiative, a nonprofit that assesses and approves company targets, doubled this year to more than 2,000, said Alberto Carrillo Pineda, the co-founder of the initiative.\", \"Last week, the organization released the criteria companies will have to meet to reach \\u201cnet zero\\u201d goals later, and they include steep reductions in emissions from supply chains. But Mr. Carrillo Pineda noted that the companies provide the data voluntarily, so \\u201cthere is no full guarantee that a company is always including every emission.\\u201d\", \"Eventually, companies may be forced to do so. The Securities and Exchange Commission is weighing whether to require more robust disclosures from companies about their emissions, citing increased demand for more transparency from investors.\", \"In July, the S.E.C.\\u2019s chairman, Gary Gensler, said he had asked his staff for a recommendation on whether to start requiring companies to reveal emissions generated by their suppliers to give investors a full accounting of their carbon footprint.\", \"\\u201cCompanies could announce plans to be \\u2018net zero\\u2019 but not provide any information that stands behind that claim,\\u201d Mr. Gensler said in a speech this summer.\", \"But forcing companies to more fully disclose their carbon footprints is only part of the challenge. Meaningfully reducing emissions in their supply chains could conflict fundamentally with their business models.\", \"Take the retail industry. The more products retailers sell, the more emissions they generate from the production and transportation of those products. Target said sales during the pandemic \\u2014 which grew by $15 billion in 2020, greater than its total sales growth over the prior 11 years \\u2014 contributed to a 16.5 percent increase in emissions from its supply chain.\", \"\\u201cThe historic challenges and unique retail needs driven by the dynamics of 2020 had an undeniable impact on our business as we met increased consumer demand,\\u201d Target said in its most recent sustainability report. \\u201cIn turn, we also saw an increased impact of our emissions.\\u201d\", \"Still, Target says it is keeping its pledge to reach net zero emissions, including its supply chain, by 2040.\", \"\\u201cThese increases do not deter us from our net zero commitment, nor from our work to continue creating strategies to avoid, reduce and remove emissions from our value chain,\\u201d the company said\", \"Professor Geyer said the pressure for companies to constantly grow their profits and sales make such pledges unrealistic. He recently wrote a book, \\u201cThe Business of Less,\\u201d in which he argued that companies need to pull back on their growth or make other radical changes to their businesses if they want to truly help the climate. Such transformations no longer seem impossible, as the auto industry is demonstrating with its switch to electric vehicles.\", \"\\u201cThe big myth in the corporate sustainability world is the idea of \\u2018win-win\\u2019 \\u2014 that a company can maximize profits and still stay environmentally friendly,\\u201d Professor Geyer said in an interview. \\u201cWe have 30 years of data that we can look at and say that doesn\\u2019t work.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3c287cf03bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3c287cf03bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}},
