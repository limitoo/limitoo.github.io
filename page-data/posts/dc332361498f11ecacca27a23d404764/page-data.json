The mother is facing charges of neglect of a dependent and child selling where the defendant transfers or receives property for terminating the care of a dependent, according to the Journal Gazette.\", \"Court records say that the man, Zee Kdee Ya, gave the girl jewelry and about $2,000 in cash, which the parents used to buy makeup for the girl and food for the party on December 20, 2020. The mother claimed that the girl's father knew that they used the money to fund the party. Ya also allegedly said that when he gave the money to the girl, she told him that she had passed it along to her father.\", \"However, the father told police that he never received the money and \\\"didn't know anything about the money given to the victim,\\\" according to court documents.\", \"An investigator from the Department of Child Services said that she told the girl's father twice in December that he could not legally arrange a marriage for his daughter because of her age, the Gazette reported. Two other DCS employees told the mother and father the same thing in separate instances in the week before the wedding.\", \"The girl's father is not currently facing any charges, but Ya was charged Thursday for child solicitation and neglect of a dependent.

Adults there denied it was a marriage celebration, saying it was \\\"only an engagement between the girl and Zee Kdee Ya,\\\" according to court records.\", \"But when police spoke privately to the girl, she said that seven days prior to the wedding celebration, her parents had signed paperwork in Burmese, arranging the marriage.\", \"Court records allege that Ya gave the girl a gold bracelet, necklace and about $2,000 in cash, which she turned over to her parents. At that point, she was considered married and was moved in with Ya and had to share a bed with him, according to court documents.\", \"When Ya allegedly tried to touch the girl on top of her clothes, she yelled at him to leave her alone, court records state.\", \"He then quoted the Bible to her and told the girl: \\\"I own you now.
