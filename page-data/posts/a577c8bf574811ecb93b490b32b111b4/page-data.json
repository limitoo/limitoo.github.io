Publishers are increasingly skeptical.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-07T10:31:14.000Z","content":"[\"A book by Billie Eilish seemed like a great bet. One of the most famous pop stars in the world, Ms. Eilish has 97 million followers on Instagram and another 6 million on Twitter. If just a fraction of them bought her book, it would be a hit.\", \"But her self-titled book has sold about 64,000 hardcover copies since it came out in May, according to NPD BookScan, which tracks most printed books sold in the United States \\u2014 not necessarily a disappointing number, unless Ms. Eilish got a big advance. Which, of course, she did. The book cost her publisher well over $1 million.\", \"It\\u2019s difficult to predict whether a book will be a hit. A jar of tomato sauce doesn\\u2019t change that much from year to year, making demand reasonably predictable. But every book is different, an individual work of art or culture, so when the publishing industry tries to forecast demand for new titles, it is, however thoughtfully, guessing. Because there are so few reliable metrics to look at, social-media followings have become some of the main data points publishers use to try to make their guesses more educated.\", \"An author\\u2019s following has become a standard part of the equation when publishers are deciding whether to acquire a book. Followings can affect who gets a book deal and how big an advance that author is paid, especially when it comes to nonfiction. But despite their importance, they are increasingly seen as unpredictable gauges of how well a book is actually going to sell.\", \"Even having one of the biggest social-media followings in the world is not a guarantee.\", \"\\u201cThe only reliable part about it,\\u201d said Shannon DeVito, director of books at Barnes & Noble, \\u201cis that it\\u2019s unreliable.\\u201d\", \"An author\\u2019s platform has long been something publishers look at \\u2014 does she have a radio show, for example, or a regular guest spot on TV? But as local news outlets and book coverage have dwindled, the avenues for book publicity have shrunk, making an author\\u2019s ability to help get the word out more crucial. And when an author speaks to her followers about a book she wrote, she is talking to people who are at least a little bit interested in what she has to share.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s become more and more important as the years went on,\\u201d said Marc Resnick, executive editor at St. Martin\\u2019s Press. \\u201cWe learned some hard lessons along the way, which is that a tweet or a post is not necessarily going to sell any books, if it\\u2019s not the right person with the right book and the right followers at the right time.\\u201d\", \"Take Justin Timberlake. His book \\u201cHindsight\\u201d was acquired for over $1 million, but when it came out in 2018, Mr. Timberlake had bruised vocal cords and was unable to promote it as planned. The 53 million Instagram followers he had at the time weren\\u2019t able to make up for it. \\u201cHindsight\\u201d has sold about 100,000 printed copies since its publication three years ago, according to BookScan, not nearly the number his publisher was hoping for.\", \"Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, is no global pop star, but she has a significant social-media presence, with 3 million Twitter followers and another 1.3 million on Instagram. Yet her book, \\u201cThis Is What America Looks Like: My Journey from Refugee to Congresswoman,\\u201d which was published in May 2020, has sold just 26,000 copies across print, audio and e-book formats, according to her publisher.\", \"Tamika D. Mallory, a social activist with over a million Instagram followers, was paid over $1 million for a two-book deal. But her first book, \\u201cState of Emergency,\\u201d has sold just 26,000 print copies since it was published in May, according to BookScan.\", \"The journalist and media personality Piers Morgan had a weaker showing. Despite his followers on Twitter (8 million) and Instagram (1.8 million), \\u201cWake Up: Why the World Has Gone Nuts\\u201d has sold just 5,650 print copies since it was published a year ago, according to BookScan.\", \"It\\u2019s difficult to know why this happens. Sometimes, publishing and marketing executives say, there is a mismatch between what people post about on social media and the subject of their books. Perhaps the books don\\u2019t provide anything beyond what they\\u2019ve already put on Instagram. It could be that the author hasn\\u2019t pushed the book to his followers effectively, or that those followers (the ones who aren\\u2019t bots, or paid for) aren\\u2019t terribly engaged with what he posts.\", \"Or maybe the book isn\\u2019t that good. Social media is only one part of why a book does or doesn\\u2019t work, just as it is only piece of why a book is acquired \\u2014 publishers were interested in Billie Eilish\\u2019s book not just because of Instagram, but because she is Billie Eilish.\", \"In an effort to mitigate these issues, some book contracts now specify the number of posts required before and after a book is published.\", \"\\u201cIn addition to hearing from the agent and reading the manuscript, we want to hear from the celebrity that they are invested in the book,\\u201d said Barbara Marcus, president and publisher of Random House Children\\u2019s Books. \\u201cTo say, in the nicest way possible, what would you say about this project and where would this fit in with all the other things you\\u2019re doing?\\u201d\", \"Crucially, executives say, there is also an increasing awareness in the industry about the difference between the number of followers and how engaged they really are. Do they comment? Do they share?\", \"\\u201cThere are people who stop being famous who still have their millions of followers, or people who left office eight years ago,\\u201d said Eric Nelson, the editorial director of Broadside Books. \\u201cThe important thing is, why are people talking about this person? It\\u2019s about what\\u2019s driving engagement.\\u201d\", \"A new dimension of this conversation is TikTok, which has become a powerful force in selling books. Successful \\u201cBookTok\\u201d titles are generally pushed by enthusiastic readers weeping into their camera phones about how much they loved the book, not authors shilling their own work. But book proposals by TikTok stars are now getting snapped up.\", \"Mary Ann Naples, publisher of Hachette Books, said she recently came across a proposal by an author who had quickly built a huge TikTok following. Ms. Naples said she wanted the book, but its price shot up.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t feel comfortable going to those heights,\\u201d she said.\", \"There are, however, plenty of examples where a social-media following does help sell books, like \\u201cAccidentally Wes Anderson\\u201d by Wally Koval, a coffee-table book of photographs from around the world of things that look like the filmmaker\\u2019s set pieces, like a pink, yellow and blue bowling alley. Mr. Koval\\u2019s Instagram account, of the same name and concept, had over 1 million followers when the book was acquired and now has 1.6 million. The book has sold more than 100,000 copies of the hardcover since it was published in January, its publisher said.\", \"Another book that performed well was \\u201cHow to Do the Work\\u201d by Dr. Nicole LePera, a holistic psychologist with 4.4 million Instagram followers. Her Instagram bio says \\u201cI teach you to heal + consciously create a new version of yourself,\\u201d and her book has sold about 216,000 copies, according to BookScan.\", \"Tanya McKinnon, a literary agent, said that it isn\\u2019t accurate to say that social media doesn\\u2019t matter for book sales. But the truth is that the industry doesn\\u2019t really know what it will do for any given book.\", \"\\u201cIf we knew, publishers would make no mistakes,\\u201d Ms. McKinnon said. \\u201cMy whole position on this is that if you find someone who really does know, will you please share their information with me?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a577c8bf574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a577c8bf574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}},
