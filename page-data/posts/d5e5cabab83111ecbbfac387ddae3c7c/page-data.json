He told CBS News' Dana Jacobson that the ceremony represents a moment in golf's history.\", \"\\\"Well it's what it symbolizes. I think most would say it represents the greatest victory in golf. It represents history, tradition, heritage. It just connects the generations of champions. I mean, I would say it's the richest reward in golf. It's not about the money, it's about the green jacket,\\\" Nantz said.\", \"Nick Faldo, who won the Masters in 1989, 1990 and 1996, said that even the strongest of men get overwhelmed with emotions when the green jacket is bestowed upon them.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"You come in and you're in a fog.

For some like Faldo that served as inspiration in back-to-back Masters' victories.\", \"\\\"I used that as motivation. I honestly went down, and I thought, 'I'm not going to put that jacket on him. It's my jacket,\\\" Faldo said. \\\"Yeah, for a split second I thought, 'No it's mine, I'm not giving it away.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"d5e5cabab83111ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d5e5cabab83111ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
