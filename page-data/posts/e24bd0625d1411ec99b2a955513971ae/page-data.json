Our imaginations would be required to fill in the blanks of what the A.R.T. is calling a concert production.\", \"All of which is fair enough. But the charismatic lead and hummable pop score of \\u201cWild\\u201d can\\u2019t camouflage the fact that this musical is very much in the awkward phase of becoming whatever it ultimately might be.\", \"Still, it can make for an enjoyable evening, depending on your willingness to overlook the ungainly book by V, the playwright formerly known as Eve Ensler, and get over your disappointment in a show that includes Javier Mu\\u00f1oz \\u2014 a.k.a. Broadway\\u2019s sexy Hamilton \\u2014 but gives him far too little to do, and dresses him dowdily. Actually, you may have to get over the other actors\\u2019 costumes, too.\", \"Directed by Paulus at the Loeb Drama Center, the story takes place in a town called Outskirtzia. Hard up for cash, the local farmers get an offer from corporate outsiders called the Extractacals: $50,000 apiece in exchange for drilling on their land.\", \"The community\\u2019s adults are tempted; the teenagers are alarmed. That strife is the primary tension of a show that, for all its ecological advocacy, is also a parable about understanding between parents and children.\", \"Menzel plays Bea, a farmer struggling with her mortgage who could use the windfall from the Extractacals. But her adolescent daughter, Sophia (the mononymous musician-actor Yde), is so terrified of the destruction of the planet and outraged by the adults\\u2019 complicity in it that she falls into a catatonic state, then disappears into the forest and transforms into a sea horse.\", \"It may or may not be a spoiler to say that other children in the town follow suit, each manifesting as a different kind of animal, each determined to save the earth from their parents\\u2019 recklessness.\", \"With the grown-ups in danger of selling their souls, \\u201cWild\\u201d is partly a morality play, gesturing in the direction of Christopher Marlowe\\u2019s \\u201cDoctor Faustus\\u201d \\u2014 and also toward Brecht, Dr. Seuss and \\u201cUrinetown.\\u201d All of it in two dimensions.\", \"Which is unfortunate, because the cast is packed with talent. Menzel, a disarmingly sympathetic not-so-evil stepmother in Amazon\\u2019s recent \\u201cCinderella,\\u201d brings an appealing ease and playfulness to Bea, and adds a touch of country music to the richness of her voice (Menzel\\u2019s run in the show ends Dec. 23). And Yde opens a window to Sophia\\u2019s soul with a couple of striking solos, \\u201cDear Everything\\u201d and \\u201cHuman.\\u201d\", \"With music principally by the pop songwriters Justin Tranter and Caroline Pennell, and lyrics principally by Tranter, Pennell and V, \\u201cWild\\u201d is a slickly produced work in progress. Rock-show lighting by the excellent Jeanette Oi-Suk Yew is remarkably effective in revving up the crowd during the more anthemic numbers.\", \"The cast of 10 is backed by a three-piece band (the music director is David Freeman Coleman) and members of the Boston Children\\u2019s Chorus, who add vocal depth and, by their presence, enhance the sense of a generation demanding action.\", \"But the show comes across as more pageant than musical, with politics paramount. Too often, the text bonks us over the head with its messaging, as when Sophia\\u2019s friend Forte (Paravi Das) explains that \\u201call living things are now being seriously jeopardized by us humans \\u2014 well, non-Indigenous humans, of course.\\u201d\", \"And does a debate over pronouns really need to erupt \\u2014 around Possible (the very funny Luke Ferrari), a nonbinary teenager, and their unaccepting father, Mr. Custom (Mu\\u00f1oz) \\u2014 during the crisis over Sophia\\u2019s disappearance? Might there be a more organic moment to make the same point?\", \"The only actor who briefly lucks into dialogue that lets whole characters emerge is Josh Lamon, as the excitable Minister Muddle and the ultra-tranquil therapist Dr. Projection.\", \"\\u201cYour children were traumatized by learning about the consequences of you leasing your lands,\\u201d Dr. Projection tells the parents of Outskirtzia. \\u201cThen you told them you didn\\u2019t care what they thought or felt. You made them feel unimportant and unseen.\\u201d\", \"Somehow, from Dr. Projection, this lesson doesn\\u2019t feel like a lesson \\u2014 a rare sensation in \\u201cWild.\\u201d The show\\u2019s creators frequently seem under the impression that virtue excuses lapses in artistry, as when a program note highlights the eco-consciousness of its costume construction.\", \"The designers, SiiGii, Roy Caires and Tommy Cole, write that they used \\u201cexclusively second hand, recycled and repurposed materials.\\u201d Yet the outfits, in nonsensical patchworks of denim and plaid, are unflattering \\u2014 \\u201cHee Haw\\u201d meets the apocalypse \\u2014 in a way that seems condescending, as if being poor and rural meant having no sense of style.\", \"The show\\u2019s successful reuse of scenic elements from earlier this season \\u2014 the set of the A.R.T.\\u2019s \\u201cMacbeth In Stride\\u201d (by Dan Soule), augmented with luxuriantly leafy sculptures (by Daniel Callahan) from its \\u201cThe Arboretum Experience\\u201d \\u2014 makes a worthier point: that recycled materials don\\u2019t need to feel penitential.\", \"\\u201cWild\\u201d is meeting the world before it\\u2019s ready, but there is something ultimately affecting in it about parents and teenagers, and something commendable, too, about theater that tries to respond to the urgent concerns of the day.\", \"\\u201cWe want you to panic, we want you to act,\\u201d the children sing, indicting their elders. \\u201cYou stole our future, and we want it back.\\u201d However clumsily, \\u201cWild\\u201d is on the side of the kids \\u2014 an offering of respect and contrition from the grown-ups, while there\\u2019s still time.\"]","href_hash":"e24bd0625d1411ec99b2a955513971ae"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e24bd0625d1411ec99b2a955513971ae"}},
