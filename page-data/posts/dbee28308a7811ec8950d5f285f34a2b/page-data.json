They walk a fine line between embracing the need for doctors to prescribe opioids to alleviate some cases of severe pain while guarding against exposing patients to the well-documented perils of opioids.\", \"The 229-page document warns of addiction, depressed breathing, altered mental status and other dangers associated with opioids, but it also notes that the drugs serve an important medical purpose, especially for easing the immediate, acute agony from traumatic injuries such as burns and crushed bones. In those instances when opioids seem the way to go, doctors should start with the lowest effective dose and prescribe immediate-release pills rather than long-acting ones, the recommendations said.\", \"The recommendations are now open on the Federal Register for public comment for 60 days. The agency will review the comments and most likely issue a final version by the end of 2022. Like the 2016 guidelines, they are suggested practices and not mandatory.\", \"\\u201cWe are welcoming comments from patients who are living with pain every day and from their caregivers and providers,\\u201d said Christopher Jones, a co-author of the draft and acting director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, the arm of the C.D.C. that released the new guidelines.\", \"The guidelines do not apply to patients suffering pain from cancer or sickle cell, or are in end-of-life or palliative care.\", \"The 2016 guidelines generated anger and fear in many chronic pain patients, many of whom rely on doses far higher than the recommended ceiling of 90 morphine milligram equivalents daily. Hundreds of pain medicine specialists protested as well.\", \"Though the dosing ceilings were merely a recommendation, dozens of states codified them. Fearing criminal and civil penalties, many doctors misapplied them as rigid standards, tapering chronic pain patients too abruptly and even tossing some from their practices.\", \"Studies show that the number of opioid prescriptions overall has been dropping since 2012, and the decline escalated after the 2016 guidelines came out.\", \"The new proposed recommendations step back from the notion of one-size dosing fits all and instead builds in \\u201cflexibility to recognize that pain care needs to be individualized,\\u201d Dr. Jones said.\", \"But the recommendations make it abundantly clear that doctors should regularly reassess the benefits and risks of opioids.\", \"\\u201cThe evidence around the long-term benefits of opioids continues to remain very limited,\\u201d Dr. Jones said.\", \"In another indication that the C.D.C. sees these new guidelines as a course-correction to the earlier ones, the agency now suggests that when patients test positive for illicit substances, doctors should offer counseling, treatment and, when necessary, careful tapering. Because doctors had interpreted the 2016 dosing limits narrowly, some had worked up one-strike policies and were summarily ejecting such patients.\", \"Dr. Jones said that such results should instead be considered one piece of diagnostic information among many. An unduly high level of opioids could indicate the patient still has untreated pain or even a substance use disorder. \\u201cIf you instead retain the patient and have those conversations, there\\u2019s now an opportunity to improve the patient\\u2019s life,\\u201d he said.\", \"Drawing from a mountain of research that accumulated in recent years, the proposed guidelines also offer extensive recommendations for the treatment of acute pain \\u2014 short-term pain that can come with an injury like a broken bone or the aftermath of surgery. They advise against prescribing opioids, except for traumatic injuries, such as burns and auto accidents.\", \"In granular detail, they compare the relief provided by opioids to that offered by alternatives such as exercise and acupuncture and other drugs. And they give fine-tuned recommendations for discrete areas of pain, such as lower back, knees and neck.\", \"The guidelines, for example, note that opioids should not be used for episodic migraines. They endorse, among other treatments, heat therapy and weight loss for knee osteoarthritis, and, for neck pain, suggest options like yoga, tai chi, qiqong, massage and acupuncture.\", \"The recommendations also say that many studies show that, over time, pain alleviation from opioids usually plateaus and then wanes, requiring ever higher doses.\", \"\\u201cWe never wanted to pretend that opioids aren\\u2019t really important tools,\\u201d said Dr. Jeanmarie Perrone, a professor of emergency medicine at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, who served on an advisory panel for the prescribing guidelines. \\u201cBut after you\\u2019ve got that cast on, we\\u2019re going to wean you off those opioids. One long-bone fracture doesn\\u2019t mean six weeks of opioid prescriptions.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"dbee28308a7811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dbee28308a7811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
