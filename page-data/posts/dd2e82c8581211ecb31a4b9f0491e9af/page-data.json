Even more than last year, I\\u2019ve been drawn to art, music and movies that, in one way or another, evade the workings of likes and shares \\u2014 and carve out a place for human creativity in a world too governed by algorithmic logic.\", \"The apple of my eye. The Museum of Modern Art\\u2019s meticulous, almost overwhelming summer exhibition distilled modernism\\u2019s father figure to his essence, revealing the day-by-day, stroke-by-stroke scrutiny needed to make a piece of fruit as weighty as the Holy Family. Those bottom-heavy pears, those clumpy bathers. Those short daubs of green and blue in his views of Mont-Sainte-Victoire. Those Proven\\u00e7al rock formations \\u2014 rocks of air and watercolor, C\\u00e9zanne as geologist! What these hundreds of sheets reconfirmed, right on time, was that your art will never change another person\\u2019s life if it merely shows what you think. You need the distinction, the seriousness, that can only come from form. (Read our review of \\u201cC\\u00e9zanne Drawing.\\u201d)\", \"I\\u2019d call the 42-year-old Japanese film director the most exciting in years if he weren\\u2019t so \\u2026 calm. \\u201cDrive My Car,\\u201d Hamaguchi\\u2019s unfailingly precise tale of a widowed actor sublimating his grief through his chauffeur and Chekhov, has virtues one fears have gone missing from cinema: long takes, guillotine-crisp editing, an unhurried faith in the importance of images. Like Jacques Rivette and Mike Leigh before him, Hamaguchi contrasts his unobtrusive camerawork with the conventions of theater \\u2014 in this case, a multilingual \\u201cUncle Vanya\\u201d production that builds to a silent, heart-stopping finale, when the troupe\\u2019s Sonya sighs \\u201cWe shall rest!\\u201d in Korean sign language. Add to that \\u201cWheel of Fortune and Fantasy,\\u201d Hamaguchi\\u2019s three-part fugue of love and intuition also released this year, and you have the emergence of a stunning talent who finds the romance in rigor. (Read our review of \\u201cDrive My Car.\\u201d)\", \"Two decades ago his world-making was mistaken for American Wagnerism; but Matthew Barney is more collaborative and more relaxed than you\\u2019d think, and he\\u2019s doing the best work of his career in the lighter register first seen in his 2019 film \\u201cRedoubt.\\u201d\", \"For the performance \\u201cCatasterism in Three Movements,\\u201d this September at the Schaulager in Switzerland, he ceded more than half the evening to the Basel Sinfonietta, who performed Jonathan Bepler\\u2019s churning music alongside a Berniniesque sculpture of copper, brass and scorched pine. Three women brought the remainder of \\u201cCatasterism\\u201d to life: the contact improvisation pioneer K.J. Holmes, the Cree hoop dancer Sandra Lamouche, and the athlete Jill Bettonvil as a sharpshooting Diana who pumped a dense-as-flesh Barney sculpture full of lead. (Read our review of Matthew Barney\\u2019s \\u201cRedoubt.\\u201d)\", \"Alone in Rome this spring, at the nearly empty Capitoline Museums, I saw the first public display in half a century of the greatest collection of ancient art in private hands. Travel restrictions made an accidental sleeper of the Torlonia family\\u2019s Greek and Roman sculptures: dozens of portrait busts, a hirsute billy goat reclining like a love god, a shattered Hercules recomposed from a hundred shards. Rome was my first trip abroad since the pandemic, and I\\u2019d submit to a dozen P.C.R. tests to see this actually legendary collection before it disappears again on Jan. 9. (Read our report on the Torlonia Marbles.)\", \"Astral but never spacey, architectural yet also boundless, this nine-movement, album-length composition deserved every one of the rave reviews that rained down upon its release in March. As Pharoah Sanders\\u2019s subdued tenor sax (and occasional vocalizations) weave around the London Symphony Orchestra\\u2019s strings and the synths and celesta of Sam Shepherd \\u2014 a.k.a. Floating Points, a British electronic musician nearly five decades Sanders\\u2019s junior \\u2014 \\u201cPromises\\u201d comes to feel like a self-regulating ecosystem, an ever denser net of music and motion. These guys knew what they were doing when they chose, for the album\\u2019s cover, a painting by Julie Mehretu, whose retrospective this year at the Whitney Museum of American Art had the same accumulating grandeur. (Read our review of \\u201cPromises.\\u201d)\", \"The secret to good decorating: just buy the best stuff and do nothing! The Frick\\u2019s down-to-the-pith reinstallation in the Whitney\\u2019s vacated building refiltered the Vermeers and Vel\\u00e1zquezes we thought we knew, and isolated Bellini\\u2019s \\u201cSt. Francis in the Desert\\u201d in a sublime Brutalist cell illuminated by one of Marcel Breuer\\u2019s trapezoid windows. What Frick Madison has proved, more subtly, is that we can give art context in a hundred digital formats; museums\\u2019 bigger challenge is carving time and space to really look. (Read our story on the making of Frick Madison.)\", \"I feel as useless / As a tree in a city park / Standing as a symbol of what / We have blown apart \\u2026. As forests burned in B.C. and diplomats dithered in Glasgow, the Toronto singer-songwriter Tamara Lindeman, who performs as the Weather Station, turned in an unreserved, openhearted album of atmospheric anxiety, in which guitars mingle with greenhouse gases and loss is measured in metric tons. She knows we don\\u2019t need artists to tell us the climate has changed; we need them to tell us how we have. (Read our interview with the singer.)\", \"Paris had a quartet of major cultural openings this year. The Bourse de Commerce, renovated by Tadao Ando for the contemporary art collection of Fran\\u00e7ois Pinault, drew the most Instagram shares, but it was two renovated historical sites \\u2014 the Mus\\u00e9e Carnavalet, the museum of Parisian history, and the H\\u00f4tel de la Marine, the stupefyingly grand naval headquarters \\u2014 that best married old and new. The city\\u2019s sweetest surprise is the old Samaritaine department store, reopened after 16 years, its Art Nouveau expanses renewed with the undulating glass of the Japanese firm Sanaa. (Read our story on the restoration of the H\\u00f4tel de la Marine.)\", \"Closer to home, the New York Public Library re-emerged from a far too long pandemic closure with a sweet new home: the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library, formerly the decrepit Mid-Manhattan Library, rethought and revived by the Dutch firm Mecanoo with Beyer Blinder Belle. Its clean white expanses have computers galore (there\\u2019s even a Bloomberg terminal for budding teen traders), but the core remains its 400,000-strong circulating book collection, open for free browsing. A few years ago, the N.Y.P.L. was planning to sell this place, and to exile the books in its main research branch to New Jersey. The Niarchos \\u2014 as well as Toshiko Mori\\u2019s renovation of the Brooklyn Public Library \\u2014 is an affirmation that cities need readers, and readers need print. (Read our review of the new library.)\", \"The year\\u2019s finest and funniest performance art took place at Arthur Ashe Stadium, when the lanky young Russian smacked his last serve, won the U.S. Open title \\u2014 and dumped his whole body onto to the court, miming a PlayStation move as he lolled like a dead fish. As arrogant as it was ridiculous, Medvedev\\u2019s side flop has stuck with me all this fall as a Gen-Z master class in how to stay human in a world of memes. If you must dive into the algorithm, then do it with total contempt.
