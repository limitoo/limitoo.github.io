The new analysis suggests that the first known patient sickened with the coronavirus was a vendor in a large Wuhan animal market, not an accountant who lived many miles from it.\", \"The report, published on Thursday in the prestigious journal Science, will revive, though certainly not settle, the debate over whether the pandemic started with a spillover from wildlife sold at the market, a leak from a Wuhan virology lab or some other way. The search for the origins of the greatest public health catastrophe in a century has fueled geopolitical battles, with few new facts emerging in recent months to resolve the question.\", \"The scientist, Michael Worobey, a leading expert in tracing the evolution of viruses at the University of Arizona, came upon timeline discrepancies by combing through what had already been made public in medical journals, as well as video interviews in a Chinese news outlet with people believed to have the first two documented infections.\", \"Dr. Worobey argues that the vendor\\u2019s ties to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as well as a new analysis of the earliest hospitalized patients\\u2019 connections to the market, strongly suggest that the pandemic began there.\", \"\\u201cIn this city of 11 million people, half of the early cases are linked to a place that\\u2019s the size of a soccer field,\\u201d Dr. Worobey said. \\u201cIt becomes very difficult to explain that pattern if the outbreak didn\\u2019t start at the market.\\u201d\", \"Several experts, including one of the pandemic investigators chosen by the W.H.O., said that Dr. Worobey\\u2019s detective work was sound and that the first known case of Covid was most likely a seafood vendor.\", \"But some of them also said the evidence was still insufficient to decisively settle the larger question of how the pandemic began. They suggested that the virus probably infected a \\u201cpatient zero\\u201d sometime before the vendor\\u2019s case and then reached critical mass to spread widely at the market. Studies of changes in the virus\\u2019s genome \\u2014 including one done by Dr. Worobey himself \\u2014 have suggested that the first infection happened in roughly mid-November 2019, weeks before the vendor got sick.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t disagree with the analysis,\\u201d said Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t agree that any of the data are strong enough or complete enough to say anything very confidently, other than that the Huanan Seafood Market was clearly a super-spreading event.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Bloom also noted that this was not the first time the W.H.O. report, done in collaboration with Chinese researchers, was found to contain mistakes, including errors involving early patients\\u2019 potential links to the market.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s just kind of mind-boggling that in all of these cases, there keep being inconsistencies about when this happened,\\u201d he said.\", \"Toward the end of December 2019, doctors at several Wuhan hospitals noticed mysterious cases of pneumonia arising in people who worked at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, a dank and poorly ventilated space where seafood, poultry, meat and wild animals were sold. On Dec. 30, public health officials told hospitals to report any new cases linked to the market.\", \"Fearing a replay of SARS, which emerged from Chinese animal markets in 2002, Chinese officials ordered the Huanan market closed, and Wuhan police officers shut it down on Jan. 1, 2020. Despite those measures, new cases multiplied through Wuhan.\", \"Wuhan authorities said on Jan. 11, 2020, that cases had begun on Dec. 8. In February, they identified the earliest patient as a Wuhan resident with the surname Chen, who fell sick on Dec. 8 and had no link to the market.\", \"Chinese officials and some outside experts suspected that the initially high percentage of cases linked to the market might have been a statistical fluke known as ascertainment bias. They reasoned that the Dec. 30 call from officials to report market-linked illnesses may have led doctors to overlook other cases with no such ties.\", \"\\u201cAt the beginning, we presumed that the seafood market may have the novel coronavirus,\\u201d Gao Fu, director of China\\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said in May 2020, according to China Global Television Network. \\u201cBut it now turns out that the market is one of the victims.\\u201d\", \"By the spring of 2020, senior members of the Trump administration were promoting another scenario for the origin of the pandemic: that the virus had escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which has a campus roughly eight miles away from the Huanan market, across the Yangtze River.\", \"In January of this year, researchers chosen by the W.H.O. visited China and interviewed an accountant who had reportedly developed symptoms on Dec. 8. Their influential March 2021 report described him as the first known case.\", \"But Peter Daszak, a disease ecologist at EcoHealth Alliance who was part of the W.H.O. team, said that he was convinced by Dr. Worobey\\u2019s analysis that they had been wrong.\", \"\\u201cThat December the eighth date was a mistake,\\u201d Dr. Daszak said.\", \"The W.H.O. team never asked the accountant the date his symptoms began, he said. Instead, they were given the Dec. 8 date by doctors from Hubei Xinhua Hospital, who handled other early cases but did not care for Mr. Chen. \\u201cSo the mistake lies there,\\u201d Dr. Daszak said.\", \"For the W.H.O. experts, Dr. Daszak said, the interview was a dead end: The accountant had no apparent links to an animal market, lab or a mass gathering. He told them he liked spending time on the internet and jogging, and he did not travel much. \\u201cHe was as vanilla as you could get,\\u201d Dr. Daszak said.\", \"Had the team identified the seafood vendor as the first known case, Dr. Daszak said, it would have more aggressively pursued questions like what stall she worked in and where her products came from.\", \"This year, Dr. Daszak has been one of the strongest critics of the lab-leak theory. He and his organization, EcoHealth Alliance, have taken heat for research collaborations with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Last month, the National Institutes of Health said EcoHealth was in breach of the terms and conditions of its grant for research on coronaviruses in bats.\", \"While the doctors at Hubei Xinhua Hospital said that the onset of the accountant\\u2019s illness had been Dec. 8, a senior doctor at Wuhan Central Hospital, where Mr. Chen was treated, had told a Chinese news outlet that he developed symptoms around Dec. 16.\", \"Asked about Mr. Chen\\u2019s case, China\\u2019s National Health Commission said it stood by comments made by Liang Wannian, the leader of the Chinese side of the W.H.O.-China investigation who led the interview with the Hubei Xinhua Hospital doctors. Mr. Liang told a news conference in February of this year that the earliest Covid case showed symptoms on Dec. 8 and was \\u201cnot connected\\u201d to the Huanan market.\", \"In their report, the W.H.O. experts concluded that the virus most likely spread to people from an animal spillover, but they could not confirm that the Huanan market was the source. By contrast, they said that a lab leak was \\u201cextremely unlikely.\\u201d\", \"The report has come under fire for several errors and shortcomings. The Washington Post revealed in July that the report listed the wrong viral samples for several early patients \\u2014 including the first official case \\u2014 and mistakenly linked the first family cluster of cases to the Huanan market. The W.H.O. promised to fix the errors, but they remain in the report on the organization\\u2019s website. (The organization said that it would ask the report\\u2019s authors if and how they would correct the mistakes.)\", \"In May, two months after the report by the W.H.O. and China was published, 18 prominent scientists, including Dr. Worobey, responded with a letter in Science complaining that the W.H.O. team had given the lab-leak theory short shrift. Far more research was required, they argued, to determine whether one explanation was more likely than the other.\", \"An expert on the origins of influenza and H.I.V., Dr. Worobey has tried to piece together the early days of the Covid pandemic. Reading a May 2020 study of early cases written by local doctors and health officials in Wuhan, he was puzzled to see a description that seemed like Mr. Chen: a 41-year-old man with no contact with the Huanan market. But the study\\u2019s authors dated his symptoms to Dec. 16, not Dec. 8.\", \"Then Dr. Worobey found what appeared to be a second, independent source for the later date: Mr. Chen himself.\", \"\\u201cI got a fever on the 16th, during the day,\\u201d a man identified as Mr. Chen said in a March 2020 video interview with The Paper, a publication based in Shanghai. The video indicates that Mr. Chen is a 41-year-old who worked in a company\\u2019s finance office and never went to the Huanan market. Official reports said that he lived in the Wuchang district in Wuhan, miles from the market.\", \"The New York Times was not able to independently confirm the identity of the man in the video.\", \"Along with his fever on Dec. 16, Mr. Chen said he felt a tightness in his chest and went to the hospital that day. \\u201cEven without any strenuous exercise, with just a tiny bit of effort, like the way I\\u2019m speaking with you now, I\\u2019d feel short of breath,\\u201d he said.\", \"Dr. Worobey said that the medical records shown in the video might hold clues to how the W.H.O.-China report wound up with the wrong date. One page described surgery Mr. Chen needed to have teeth removed. Another was a Dec. 9 prescription for antibiotics referring to a fever from the day before \\u2014 possibly the day of the dental surgery.\", \"On the video, Mr. Chen speculated that he might have gotten Covid \\u201cwhen I went to the hospital\\u201d \\u2014 possibly a reference to his earlier dental surgery.\", \"The Washington Post noted in July that the details provided by the W.H.O. for the Dec. 8 case seemed to fit better with an entry from an online database of viral samples linked to someone who got sick on Dec. 16. In response, the W.H.O. had said it was looking into the discrepancy.\", \"An agency spokesman told The New York Times it would be \\u201cdifficult to comment\\u201d on the first known case because the W.H.O. team had limited access to health data. He said it was important for investigators to keep looking for patients infected even earlier.\", \"In Dr. Worobey\\u2019s revised chronology, the earliest case is not Mr. Chen but the seafood vendor, a woman named Wei Guixian, who developed symptoms around Dec. 11. (Ms. Wei said in the same video published by The Paper that her serious symptoms began on Dec. 11, and she told The Wall Street Journal that she began feeling sick on Dec. 10. The W.H.O.-China report listed a Dec. 11 case linked to the market.)\", \"Dr. Worobey found that hospitals reported more than a dozen likely cases before Dec. 30, the day the Wuhan authorities alerted doctors to be on the lookout for ties to the market.\", \"He determined that Wuhan Central Hospital and Hubei Xinhua Hospital each recognized seven cases of unexplained pneumonia before Dec. 30 that would be confirmed as Covid-19. At each hospital, four out of seven cases were linked to the market.\", \"By focusing on just these cases, Dr. Worobey argued, he could rule out the possibility that ascertainment bias skewed the results in favor of the market.\", \"Still, other scientists said it\\u2019s far from certain that the pandemic began at the market.\", \"\\u201cHe has done an excellent job of reconstructing what he can from the available data, and it\\u2019s as reasonable a hypothesis as any,\\u201d said Dr. W. Ian Lipkin, a virologist at the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University. \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t think we\\u2019re ever going to know what\\u2019s going on, because it\\u2019s two years ago and it\\u2019s still murky.\\u201d\", \"Alina Chan, a postdoctoral fellow at the Broad Institute in Cambridge, Mass., and one of the most vocal proponents of investigating a lab leak, said that only new details about earlier cases \\u2014 going back to November \\u2014 would help scientists trace the origin.\", \"\\u201cThe main issue this points out,\\u201d she said, \\u201cis that there\\u2019s a lack of access to data, and there are errors in the W.H.O.-China report.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6c1b6c2248a411ec88b503613f0e92d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6c1b6c2248a411ec88b503613f0e92d8"}},
