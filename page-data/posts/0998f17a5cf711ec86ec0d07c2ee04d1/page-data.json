The next month, Harjo presented a prize at the Emmy Awards alongside the show\\u2019s four young breakout stars. Two days before I talked to him, \\u201cReservation Dogs\\u201d won the Gotham Award for short format breakout series. (Was he expecting it? \\u201cI was not. I would have had less wine.\\u201d)\", \"And to top it off, Netflix this month released \\u201cLove and Fury,\\u201d Harjo\\u2019s second documentary, about Native artists navigating their careers, both in the United States and abroad. What happens, the film asks, when they push Native art into a postcolonial world?\", \"For roughly a year, Harjo and his crew followed more than 20 artists, few of whom were complete strangers: Members of the band Black Belt Eagle Scout, the recording project of Katherine Paul, sometimes stay with him in Tulsa, Okla., when they are on tour. Tommy Orange, the author of the acclaimed \\u201cThere There,\\u201d asked Harjo to moderate an event he was speaking at. (Harjo then filmed the event for this documentary.)\", \"Harjo, of course, is a Native artist, too: The Seminole and Muscogee Creek filmmaker directed three features (\\u201cFour Sheets to the Wind,\\u201d \\u201cBarking Water\\u201d and \\u201cMekko\\u201d) and a documentary (\\u201cThis May Be the Last Time\\u201d) before brainstorming \\u201cReservation Dogs\\u201d over tequilas with Waititi.\", \"These artists pass through one another\\u2019s orbits constantly, drawing closer and closer together. As he explained on a recent call, Harjo wanted to express that notion himself \\u2014 but through the lens of community.\", \"Here are edited excerpts from our conversation.\", \"Why love and fury? How are those two concepts related?\", \"As artists, I think collectively we have all of these different experiences and these different types of survival that we come from. And you can take that survival, you can take any sort of oppression, and feel bitter and feel like things are hopeless. Because some of us are displaced, some of us have lost our language, a lot of us have, there\\u2019s a lot of abuse in boarding schools, a lot of things that happened throughout history. Not just Western expansion. It was also a lot of things, a lot of U.S. policies, that really did oppress our people.\", \"And so you can take that and convert that into feeling bitter and angry. Or you can take that anger and turn it into love and creation. And I think that\\u2019s what each of these artists do. All of them are connected to community, all of them have community-driven work. And they take this history and try to make sense of it and express themselves in this way that people can connect to. And I think that that is love.\", \"The last film you made was in 2015. Does it feel different this time around, after \\u201cReservation Dogs\\u201d?\", \"I made this before \\u201cReservation Dogs.\\u201d So I was making this very low-budget, and I just really wanted to tell a story that needed to be told. Contemporary Native art has not been looked at and presented in a way that I felt like it should be. There\\u2019s such a dated view of what Native art is in the world. I\\u2019m friends with all of these artists, and I\\u2019ve just known artists forever. It felt like an opportunity to show this world that hasn\\u2019t been seen and also help reframe Native art.\", \"I wanted it to organically expand. So if I\\u2019m filming with one artist and then I meet a couple more artists, I would follow them and go do stuff with them.\", \"I\\u2019ve done many documentaries where I do the sit-down interview with slow motion B-roll over it, and that\\u2019s great. But I wanted to do something different. I purposely didn\\u2019t do a lot of sit-down interviews. I was looking at a lot of Les Blank films, specifically, \\u201cA Poem Is a Naked Person,\\u201d about [the musician-songwriter] Leon Russell. But you watch the film, and it\\u2019s really about this time period [the early 1970s].\", \"We watched this documentary called \\u201cHeartworn Highways\\u201d that\\u2019s about Guy Clark and Townes Van Zandt, Steve Earle, back in the \\u201970s. It was what it sounds like: It\\u2019s a visual document of what was happening. That\\u2019s what I wanted to do with this: film people doing their thing.\", \"Did you go into this with specific people you knew you were going to follow?\", \"Yeah, originally it was [the singer] Micah P. Hinson, [the interdisciplinary artist] Cannupa Hanska Luger, [the painter] Haley Greenfeather English and my friend Penny Pitchlynn, who has the band Labrys. Penny\\u2019s tour didn\\u2019t happen, so I didn\\u2019t end up going with her on tour. She\\u2019s still on the film, but [the dancer] Emily Johnson becomes a bigger part of the documentary. And it was really following them, and then organically letting it expand with other people.\", \"I wanted to show this community: how everyone\\u2019s connected in this Native art world. If you look at \\u201cReservation Dogs,\\u201d it\\u2019s similar; it\\u2019s about a community. I\\u2019m really interested in community-driven filmmaking and storytelling.\", \"You\\u2019ve now made three features and two documentaries. Is there as much room for artistic freedom with documentaries as there is with a feature film?\", \"There\\u2019s not, but I think it\\u2019s just a different way of telling a story; I really like the boundaries that you have with documentary. With \\u201cLove and Fury,\\u201d I set up these rules [for] each person on the camera, including myself. I said, \\u201cAct like you\\u2019re the only person in the room getting footage, like it\\u2019s 1970 and we only have one camera.\\u201d If you don\\u2019t get it, no one will.\", \"We all shot with zoom lenses. So instead of cutting and reframing, we could zoom in to do close-ups or zoom out for wides. The idea was, act like we\\u2019re not editing. So don\\u2019t do a fast zoom; let it be fluid so I can keep it in the film. I love working that way because it\\u2019s a challenge. And it\\u2019s very different from the control you have on a narrative. There\\u2019s something in that challenge that I really like as a storyteller.\", \"What do you think the documentary itself, and these artists, have to say about endurance?\", \"All of these artists have been working for so many years. And we\\u2019re in a time period right now, myself included, where people want to pay attention to Native art and Native stories, and there\\u2019s talk of inclusion and diversity. I think that they all just kept working, even though there was no money and no way of guaranteeing they would have careers. And the fact that they kept pushing and keep pushing to this day is just a testament to their endurance, but also their people\\u2019s endurance. I think that that\\u2019s what drives us: our people survived a lot of things, and our endurance in this art world is connected to that.\"]","href_hash":"0998f17a5cf711ec86ec0d07c2ee04d1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0998f17a5cf711ec86ec0d07c2ee04d1"}},
