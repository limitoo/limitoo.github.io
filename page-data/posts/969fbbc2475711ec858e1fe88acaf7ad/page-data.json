We're not going to change our policy at all,\\\" Biden told reporters. When asked to clarify the United States' position on Taiwan, the president added that independence was not something his administration was backing.\", \"\\\"I said that they have to decide, 'they,' Taiwan. Not us. And we are not encouraging independence, we're encouraging that they do exactly what the Taiwan Act requires,\\\" Biden continued. \\\"That's what we're doing. Let them make up their mind. Period.\\\"\", \"\\\"It's independent. It makes its own decisions,\\\" the president added.\", \"Biden told the press that he and Xi spoke for 3 1/2 hours on a wide variety of issues, and made it clear to the Chinese leader that \\\"[the United States is] going to abide by the rules of the road.\\\"\", \"A senior White House official also backed up the position of non-independence during another gaggle with reporters.

These tensions were reportedly a significant part of Monday's discussion between Biden and Xi.\", \"How these tensions will play out remains to be seen, but the president did refer to the meeting as \\\"positive,\\\" and reportedly assured Xi that the U.S. would \\\"stay outside of their territorial waters\\\" for the time being, but \\\"would not be intimidated.\\\"\", \"\\\"We talked about that, and it was ... there was no argumentation, just a matter of fact,\\\" Biden said in regards to American travel patterns through the South China Sea.\", \"The United States and Taiwan have long enjoyed significant informal ties, and the island nation continues to be a significant trading partner for the U.S.\", \"Despite this, though, the U.S. has not officially recognized Taiwan as a sovereign state since 1979.
