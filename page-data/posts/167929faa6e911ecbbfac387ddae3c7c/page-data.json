Madison Cawthorn, of North Carolina, was \\\"wrong\\\" to call Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy a \\\"thug\\\" \\u2014 but says he will still be supporting Cawthorn's reelection bid.\", \"The North Carolina Republican has come under fire in recent days, after reports \\u2014 and then a video\\u00a0\\u2014 emerged in which he told supporters in Asheville, North Carolina, \\\"Zelenskyy is a thug,\\\" and \\\"Remember that the Ukrainian government is incredibly corrupt, and it is incredibly evil, and it has been pushing woke ideologies.\\\"\", \"His view in the minority \\u2014 the Ukrainian president is widely admired around the world and in Congress as an inspiring leader who has united his people and much of the international community against a withering and unprovoked assault by Russia.
