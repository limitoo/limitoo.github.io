A second source, though, said Manchin supports the child tax credit, but does not believe the price tag for the legislation should exceed $1.75 trillion over a decade. The child tax benefit alone would cost $1.4 trillion over 10 years.\", \"\\\"I've always been for child tax credits. We've voted for it many times,\\\" Manchin told reporters Wednesday, adding, \\\"I'm not negotiating with any of you.\\\"\", \"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, said Democrats are \\\"still optimistic\\\" about the sweeping domestic policy plan passing, but said the child tax credit is \\\"really important leverage\\\" in discussions over the bill, casting doubt on whether standalone legislation extending the aid could clear Congress.\", \"\\\"Of course we could pass that in the House. Whether we could pass it in the Senate remains to be seen,\\\" she told reporters during a press conference Wednesday. \\\"But I don't want to let anybody off the hook on the [Build Back Better Act] to say, well, we covered that one thing, so now the pressure is off.\\\"\", \"The House passed its version of Mr. Biden's domestic policy plan last month, which includes a one-year extension of the expanded credit. But the path to its approval by the Senate has been complicated by Democrats' fragile majority in the upper chamber. While Senate Democrats are using a special procedure to pass the plan with a simple majority, that still requires support from all 50 Democrats, making backing from Manchin crucial.\", \"The West Virginia senator has for months been at the center of negotiations with the White House, during which he has raised concerns about the size and scope of the plan. Manchin's opposition to the plan's initial $3.5 trillion price tag led the president to scale down his proposal significantly, to $1.75 trillion. While talks among Democrats were ongoing, Schumer repeatedly said he believed the Senate could finish its work on Mr. Biden's signature domestic policy proposal before Christmas.\", \"But with progress on the package sputtering with the impasse between Manchin and the White House, Senate Democrats have begun to shift the focus to voting rights. Schumer met Wednesday morning with a group of Democrats, including Manchin, to discuss possible change to Senate rules to allow voting rights legislation to pass with a simple majority, a source on Capitol Hill said. Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, huddled with a group of Democratic senators Wednesday to discuss the path forward on voting rights, the organization said.\", \"Mr. Biden, meanwhile, told reporters Wednesday there has been \\\"some\\\" progress on his social spending package, but indicated he would be open to a push toward voting rights.\", \"\\\"If we can get the congressional voting rights done, we should do it,\\\" the president said during a trip to Dawson Springs, Kentucky, to survey damage from a devastating tornado outbreak. \\\"If we can't, we've got to keep going. There's nothing domestically more important than voting rights. It's the single biggest issue.\\\"\", \"Nikole Killion, Jack Turman, Ed O'Keefe and Tim Perry contributed to this report.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"6c0da2985e8111ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6c0da2985e8111ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
