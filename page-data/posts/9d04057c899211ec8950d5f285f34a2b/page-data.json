That clearly hasn't happened yet with these quite large disparities. In fact, it's worse than what happened with adults. I think that's the most disappointing thing in my mind.\\\"\", \"He said M\\u0101ori health providers are becoming scapegoats for what is a completely failed system.\", \"\\\"The MOH have said they have difficulty engaging with M\\u0101ori health providers, but they do very good analysis about whether those providers are researched enough to do it.\\\"\", \"He said that on average M\\u0101ori health providers received fewer resources.\", \"\\\"What I would like the MOH and current health system to do is look at why they can't achieve equitable outcomes, what is the problem?

The issue is getting a system that works to deliver it in a time when busy working families, particularly poor families, can get there to do it.\", \"\\\"This is the final part of the strategy.
