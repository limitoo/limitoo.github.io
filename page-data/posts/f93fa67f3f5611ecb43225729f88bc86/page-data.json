\\\"couple of stitches\\\" when he got to the Royal Adelaide Hospital.\", \"He would end up getting 55 stitches.\", \"While he was arriving at hospital to be met by about 15 doctors and surgeons, wife Joey had been contacted by one of Oakley's\\u00a0friends with secondhand information that he had suffered a bump on the head and may be getting some stitches.\", \"Far from alarmed, Ms Oakley

nurses went to lift it up a little bit and I don't know if this is too graphic, but I could see his eyeball through his cheek from just lifting it up there and I nearly fainted,\\\" she admitted.\",

those nasty wounds.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Concern his smile might not be same</div>\", \"Just as worrying was the fact the nerve in his face was possibly gone, which would mean an incomplete smile forever.\", \"\\\"It wasn't possible to see whether the nerve was cut or whether we were going to be able to [do] anything, so it was a matter of repairing the wounds, putting the

couldn't see out of my left eye;\\u00a0I couldn't move properly.\\\"\", \"The couple said it was family, their local pastor and their Pentecostal church that pulled him out of the spiral, including an emotional return to a Sunday service.\", \"\\\"The entire church gathered round \\u2014 about 300 people all just prayed for healing for all movement to come back, for [my] nerves to be restored,\\\"
