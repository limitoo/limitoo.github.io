Scion holds a confidential agreement with private investment company Pacific Channel to continue pursuing commercialisation.\", \"The council originally pursued Terax as it needed a way to dispose of sewage sludge, but continued funding it after it resolved that issue via composting in 2012.\", \"A retired chemist and economist said in his view Terax was based on a technology that was never going to make the council any money - something he has been telling the council since 2014.\", \"Others, however, say the Terax technology may still make money - it was just ahead of its time.\", \"But the fact remains - the technology cost taxpayers and ratepayers almost $10m and has yet to provide a service, product or any financial return.\", \"---\", \"It all starts with poo. Rotorua's, to be exact.\", \"Sewage sludge is a by-product of the wastewater treatment process. The question, for councils, is what to do with it.\", \"According to Rotorua Lakes Council infrastructure manager Stavros Michael, until about 2009 or 2010, Rotorua's sewage sludge was mixed with green waste to create a compost called Gardener's Gold.\", \"It became unviable for three major reasons: The odour from the mixing process; cost and scarcity of mixing agents such as sawdust; and because users - farms especially - became averse to using a compost made from human poo.\", \"With Gardener's Gold no longer an option, the council had to send it to the landfill.\", \"Michael said this was problematic because there was not enough general waste to achieve the necessary ratio to mix in the sludge. The wet sludge also made the landfill face unstable and generated a run-off that needed re-treating.\", \"---\", \"Meanwhile, since 2005 or so, Scion had been working on ways to dispose of forestry sludge through combining wet oxidation and anaerobic fermentation processes.\", \"Applied to sewage sludge, anaerobic fermentation would dramatically reduce the solids entering the wet oxidation process, according to an archived page on the Scion website.\", \"Wet oxidation used high pressure, temperature and oxygen to break down the solids into carbon dioxide, water and small organic compounds, and in a later stage, biological nutrients could be removed to \\\"make valuable products\\\" it said.\", \"The project was named Waste 2 Gold.\", \"Scion chief executive Dr Julian Elder - who was not in the role at that time - said the forestry application was not pursued as forestry sludge disposal costs were already low.\", \"Elder said Scion became aware of the council's sludge disposal quandary at the same time as the council became aware of Scion's research.\", \"---\", \"In August 2010 then-Environment Minister Nick Smith announced a $1m grant from the Ministry of the Environment's Waste Minimisation Fund for Waste 2 Gold.\", \"The grant would go toward the Terax pilot plant - the first step, after Scion's initial research, towards the ultimate goal: a Terax demonstration plant at the Rotorua wastewater treatment plant.\", \"That demonstration plant was intended not just to provide a solution to Rotorua's sewage sludge woes, but also to demonstrate the technology to potential buyers.\", \"Smith opened the pilot plant opened on 31 May 2011.\", \"The plant's purpose, according to an archived Scion website page, was to \\\"provide sufficient data to determine if the technology can work at a full commercial scale\\\".\", \"In November 2011 the pilot plant became operational. It was also the month the council entered into a contract with Whakat\\u0101ne-based company Ecocast to compost its sewage sludge.\", \"The Ecocast contract has cost an average of $800,000 annually and remains in place today.\", \"On 3 February 2012, Terax Limited - later renamed Terax 2013 Limited - was incorporated.

Auckland has a huge [sewage] problem.\", \"\\\"Those places needed it more than we did because they have the huge populations.
