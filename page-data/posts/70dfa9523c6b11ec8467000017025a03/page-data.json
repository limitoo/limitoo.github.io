Burns, the C.I.A. director, met with a top adviser to President Vladimir V. Putin in Moscow on Tuesday, leading a delegation of American officials on a two-day visit to the Russian capital that served as the latest evidence of heightened engagement between two global adversaries.\", \"Mr. Burns was traveling at President Biden\\u2019s request, the American Embassy in Moscow said in a statement. The surprise visit was something of a merger of Mr. Burns\\u2019s current role as intelligence chief and his past jobs as a senior American diplomat and state department official. Karen Donfried, the assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian Affairs, joined Mr. Burns in his meeting with the adviser to Mr. Putin, Nikolai Patrushev. \", \"\\u201cThey are meeting with members of the Russian government to discuss a range of issues in the bilateral relationship,\\u201d an embassy spokesman said of the American delegation\\u2019s visit, scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday.\", \"It was at least the fourth trip to Moscow since July by a senior American official, a sharp uptick in contact that has come in the wake of the summit meeting between Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin in Geneva in June. Officials on both sides say the talks have so far yielded no breakthroughs and are aimed primarily at stabilizing the relationship between two nuclear-armed adversaries increasingly competing in cyberspace as well as geopolitics. \", \"The talks include a serious conversation on arms control and another on cybersecurity. The United States, for example, has turned over the names and other details of a few hackers actively launching attacks on America from Russia, and is waiting to see if the information results in arrests, The New York Times has reported. \", \"The two sides are also discussing other matters of mutual interest, including North Korea, Afghanistan and climate policy. \", \"American officials have also said that Moscow has been helpful in ongoing talks with Iran about its nuclear program. Mr. Burns was one of the diplomats who began the back channel talks with Tehran that ultimately led to the international agreement in 2015 to limit its nuclear program. Former President Donald J. Trump withdrew the United States from the deal in 2018. \", \"\\u201cWhile the number of issues that we have reached agreement on is not great, we are on the right path,\\u201d Mr. Putin said last month, praising the White House as \\u201cinterested in building ties.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Burns\\u2019s visit \\u2014 and the decision to immediately disclose it \\u2014 underlined the efforts by both sides to telegraph that they were working to manage a volatile relationship. \", \"Mr. Biden has argued that even as the United States and Russia compete on the world stage they should be able to cooperate \\u201cwhere it\\u2019s in our mutual interests.\\u201d But his stance has opened him up to criticism that he is too willing to engage with a country that is undermining American interests globally and repressing dissent at home. \", \"After landing on Tuesday, Mr. Burns sat down with Mr. Patrushev, who is the secretary of the Kremlin\\u2019s Security Council and is widely seen as the most powerful figure among the intelligence officials in Mr. Putin\\u2019s inner circle. In a brief video of the start of the meeting posted online by Russian media, Mr. Patrushev tells Mr. Burns, seated across from him at a conference table: \\u201cI am glad to greet you in Moscow.\\u201d\", \"The C.I.A. declined to comment.\", \"Russian officials have publicly floated the possibility of a second meeting between Mr. Putin and Mr. Biden before the end of the year, although the White House has not confirmed that another summit is under consideration. American officials would likely want to see some further progress on the issues discussed in Geneva before agreeing to another meeting.\", \"Asked on Tuesday about the possibility of another Putin-Biden meeting, the Kremlin\\u2019s spokesman, Dmitri S. Peskov, said that there was \\u201ca mutual interest in holding such contacts.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe timetable will be determined,\\u201d Mr. Peskov said. \", \"The White House has used Mr. Burns as something of a roving diplomat, sending him, for example, to Afghanistan to talk with Taliban leaders during the evacuation of the Kabul airport in August. He also met with senior Israeli leaders in Israel ahead of Prime Minister Naftali Bennett\\u2019s visit to Washington. \", \"A former U.S. ambassador to Moscow who has twice been stationed as a diplomat in Russia, he is one of the Biden Administration\\u2019s senior officials most experienced in Russian affairs.\", \"The range of intelligence issues between the United States and Russia includes Moscow\\u2019s election interference, pushing of disinformation globally, and ransomware attacks by Russian criminal groups.\", \"It is not clear if Mr. Burns was going to raise the issue of the anomalous health incidents known as \\u201cHavana Syndrome,\\u2019\\u2019 a growing number of episodes where C.I.A. officers and other officials have suffered traumatic brain injuries after experiencing strange pressure, heat or sounds.\", \"Some American officials say privately that they believe Russia is responsible for those health incidents. \", \"However, C.I.A. analysts and other American intelligence agencies have not yet drawn any formal conclusions about what has caused them. Russia has dismissed speculation that it could be responsible as \\u201cunhealthy fantasies.\\u201d \"]","href_hash":"70dfa9523c6b11ec8467000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"70dfa9523c6b11ec8467000017025a03"}},
