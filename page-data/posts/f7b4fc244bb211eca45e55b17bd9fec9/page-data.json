So it\\u2019s time to catch up.\\u201d\", \"Pasternak said the funding will enable the museum to embark on a new slate of initiatives: modernizing 40,000 square feet of existing gallery space, creating a permanent gallery devoted to the history of Brooklyn and supporting energy-efficiency upgrades in the city-owned landmark building. The fourth- and fifth-floor galleries for European, decorative and American arts, including Indigenous artworks, as well as design, will all get new interiors and climate control systems. Installations of work from the museum\\u2019s collection will also be reconsidered as part of the project.\", \"\\u201cWe hope to be able to significantly expand our contemporary art galleries and design spaces,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe have one of the great American design collections, and absolutely inadequate spaces in which to show it.\\u201d\", \"Pasternak said the investment will not only allow the museum to showcase more of its permanent collection, but also to engage visitors in new ways.\", \"\\u201cPeople are wanting more immersive, participatory experiences in addition to having beautiful galleries with natural light,\\u201d she said. \\u201cYou want to be able to have sound; you want to be able to have projection. You want to be able to envelop people in a multitude of ways of telling stories.\\u201d\", \"The Brooklyn Museum is one of the oldest and largest art museums in the United States, the second largest in New York after the Metropolitan Museum of Art. It has a permanent collection of more than 500,000 objects, including one of the finest collections of Egyptian art in the world.\", \"In addition to serving as a gallery space, the museum attracts thousands of younger adults to its monthly free First Saturday events, in which it remains open until 11 p.m. and becomes a kind of dance club, with wine, food and live music (on hold for the moment).\", \"But the institution, which has a large building that is far from Manhattan\\u2019s Museum Mile, has long struggled financially. It faced pushback from art critics and curators last year when it became the first major U.S. arts organization to take advantage of a two-year window in which the Association of Art Museum Directors allowed institutions hit hard by the economic crisis to deaccession, or sell off, work in order to pay for the existing collection\\u2019s care.\", \"The city gives the museum approximately $9 million each year for operating expenses \\u2014 or about 20 percent of its operating budget of approximately $43 million. The mayor said in a statement on Monday that the latest investment \\u201cwill ensure the Brooklyn Museum remains an iconic destination for generations to come.\\u201d\", \"Pasternak said that while there is no timeline yet for the renovations, many more announcements are to come.\", \"\\u201cWe have dreams for a lot of projects,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re excited to at long last give Brooklyn the museum it deserves.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f7b4fc244bb211eca45e55b17bd9fec9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f7b4fc244bb211eca45e55b17bd9fec9"}},
