Lowy predicts only a third of PNG's adult population will be fully vaccinated by April 2026, more than four years from now.\", \"The vaccine rollout in Vanuatu and Solomon Islands has been significantly faster, and both nations have managed to protect their citizens and stop COVID-19 from spreading through the community by shutting their borders.\", \"However, both countries are still making much slower progress than other Pacific nations.\", \"The Lowy Institute research predicts that the Solomon Islands will have vaccinated 66 per cent\\u00a0of its eligible adults by December next year, below the thresholds needed to curb the impact of COVID-19.\\u00a0\", \"And the Lowy Institute predicts\\u00a0Vanuatu will only have vaccinated 56 per cent\\u00a0of eligible adults by the end of next year, which means it will remain vulnerable to a catastrophic outbreak and will likely have to keep its borders shut for some time.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Challenges facing the

conjecture about the vaccine have spread faster than the disease itself.\", \"\\\"This has fed into an already-low level of trust in formal and public institutions.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Australia has already poured substantial resources into the vaccine rollout in Papua New Guinea, including programs designed to encourage vaccination and fight misinformation.\\u00a0\", \"However, Mr Dayant said, the grim forecast for PNG showed Australia and other development partners in the country needed to expand counter-misinformation campaigns.\", \"\\\"You could help design more targeted and context-specific campaigns across a range of platforms to convey the message [that]\\u00a0the vaccine is safe,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"He also urged Australia to expand its efforts to bolster health systems in Melanesia in order to help drive up the vaccination rate.\\u00a0\", \"The Lowy Institute's forecasts for Melanesia contrast sharply with its projections and assessments of the vaccine rollout in other parts of the Pacific.\\u00a0\", \"Fiji was battered by an outbreak of the Delta variant of Covid-19 this year but has now vaccinated more than 90 per cent\\u00a0of adults \\u2014

ahead of Australia.\", \"The Lowy Institute predicts that other Micronesian nations are likely to reach the same level of protection in the first half of next year, often using doses provided by the United States.\\u00a0\", \"Larger Polynesian nations are making good progress towards full vaccination as well, with the Lowy Institute projecting Samoa will achieve widespread coverage next month,

Pacific Island countries and Timor Leste as part of a broader commitment to provide 60 million doses to the wider region.\\u00a0\", \"The most recent federal government data shows that Australia has, so far, sent more than one million vaccines to Fiji, as well as more than 200,000 vaccines to both Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands.\", \"Vanuatu has received 100,000 doses from Australia, while Samoa has taken 50,000 doses and Tonga has taken 19,000.\", \"The Lowy Institute said that the next-largest commitment to the Pacific region was from the COVAX Facility, which has committed 4.5 million doses, followed by New Zealand, which has promised 520,000 doses, and then China and the United States.\\u00a0\", \"Mr Dayant said that, when COVID-19 broke out, there were fears that Pacific Island nations would \\\"fall towards the back of the global queue\\\" for vaccines, but that scenario was averted thanks to the vaccine diplomacy of Australia and other donors.\"]","href_hash":"6648150a4ac711ecb87f778dcca17d1c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6648150a4ac711ecb87f778dcca17d1c"}},
