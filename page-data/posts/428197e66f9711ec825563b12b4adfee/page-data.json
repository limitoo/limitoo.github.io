This is just nonsense,\\u201d Mr. Tokayev said in an address to the nation on Friday.\", \"\\u201cWhat negotiations can there be with criminals and murderers,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey need to be destroyed and this will be done.\\u201d\", \"Since the protests turned violent, it has been very hard to assess the events unfolding in the country. Internet and telephone service have been sporadic and there are few reliable independent news outlets in the country. People reached by phone have been largely confined to their homes, hunkering down as explosions rattle the walls.\", \"Russian troops, operating alongside Kazakh law enforcement agencies, said on Friday they regained full control of the airport in Almaty, the country\\u2019s largest city, according to the Russian Defense Ministry.\", \"\\u201cThe security of the Consulate General of the Russian Federation located in the city and other important facilities is being ensured,\\u201d a spokesman for the ministry, Igor Konashenkov, said as reported by Interfax, a Russian news agency.\", \"The ferocity of the unrest caught many observers by surprise. The oil-rich Central Asian nation perched on Russia\\u2019s southern steppe had been widely viewed as perhaps the most stable country in a volatile region.\", \"For most the time since it gained independence three decades ago, the country was ruled by one man: Nursultan Nazarbayev. Even after he formally stepped down as president, he retained the title \\u201cleader of the nation\\u201d and he was widely viewed as keeping control over the state through his role as chair of the national security council.\", \"In the wake of the unrest, Mr. Tokayev has publicly assumed control of the security forces and sidelined the 81-year-old autocrat.
