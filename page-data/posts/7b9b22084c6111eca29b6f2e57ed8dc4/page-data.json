I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d\", \"Kammerer, a retired fisherman, is playing a small role in aiding California\\u2019s crab fishing industry, which faces an uncertain future as it grapples with an ever-shortening season.\", \"On that day, he was selecting crabs to be tested for domoic acid, a neurotoxin that, when found in the seafood, can halt the opening of the commercial fishing season. The toxin is not the only unwanted presence: In the past few years, a handful of migrating whales have been tangled in crab traps.\", \"Now, the season can\\u2019t open until a majority of the whales are gone.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve gone from a seven-month-long crab season to one that is going to be three months, at best,\\u201d said Ben Platt, the president of the California Coast Crab Association, which advocates for the fishery. He and some other fishermen say that it is not just their way of life at risk, but also potentially the future of California\\u2019s crab fishery, one of the state\\u2019s most valuable.\", \"If the regulations keep tightening, Platt said, \\u201cthere\\u2019s a good chance that the Dungeness fishing industry won\\u2019t survive.\\u201d\", \"The curtailed season is the outcome of a bitter conflict between fishermen and environmentalists, who have long campaigned to protect California\\u2019s marine life from becoming entangled in fishing gear. In 2019, they reached a settlement with the state government and a group of fishermen to ensure that a region\\u2019s crabbing season could begin only once it had been declared mostly free of threatened and endangered whales.\", \"It is also a case study in whether the country\\u2019s major fisheries can adapt to climate change: Rising ocean temperatures, scientists say, may have helped encourage the whales into crab territory. Warming waters can also increase the toxic algae blooms that can end up poisoning the shellfish.\", \"\\u201cIt all trickles down,\\u201d Jarrod Santora, a marine biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said of the knockoff effects of climate change on the fishing community. The humpback whale population, historically threatened by hunting, he added, has also recovered significantly.\", \"Kammerer, the fisherman, said: \\u201cWhen there\\u2019s too many of them, who wins the battle? The whales or the fishermen?\\u201d\", \"This year, the season is still not open in some parts of the state, including the Bay Area. For many, crab won\\u2019t be on the Thanksgiving menu. Other fishermen worry they will lose out on the Christmas market as well.\", \"\\u201cIf we don\\u2019t have the product, we\\u2019re going to lose our income,\\u201d said Tony Anello, 73, a fisherman and the owner of Spud Point Crab Company, a restaurant in Bodega Bay, a small town about 70 miles north of San Francisco.\", \"Anello, who has been fishing for more than five decades, said he had watched his town morph increasingly into a tourist destination as many fishermen moved on. \\u201cThe boats are dwindling away.\\u201d\", \"For younger fishermen, breaking into the crab fishery can seem near impossible.\", \"\\u201cI tried to get this job for 10 years,\\u201d said Liam Brayton, 37, who on a recent Thursday was repairing crab traps in a yard opposite the Spud Point Marina in Bodega Bay. But now, he said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t see much of a future.\\u201d\", \"In Kammerer\\u2019s case, the tough regulations were part of what led him to retire and sell his boat four years ago. But the ocean continues to lure him back, he said, and so he occasionally works as a deckhand to Dick Ogg, a friend and fellow crab fisherman.\", \"That day, the pair cruised through cerulean waters, launching the traps and hauling them back with an air of optimism despite their acknowledgment that the future of the fishery was uncertain.\", \"\\u201cThis is our living, this is what we do every day, we don\\u2019t want that to go away; we want to take care of this environment,\\u201d Ogg, 68, said.\", \"\\u201cI can\\u2019t imagine a life without fishing,\\u201d he added. \\u201cI\\u2019m a water person.\\u201d\", \"Livia Albeck-Ripka is a reporter for The New York Times, based in California.\", \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention created a $200 million pandemic \\u201cweather service\\u201d \\u2014 but outbreaks are a lot harder to predict than storms.\", \"See $2.7 million homes in California.\", \"California cabernet sauvignon, from beyond Napa Valley.\", \"Today\\u2019s tip comes from Lisa McInnis, who recommends the Trona Pinnacles in Central California:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
