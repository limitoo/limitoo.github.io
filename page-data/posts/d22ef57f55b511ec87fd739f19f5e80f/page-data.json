Its operations stretch across Syria, including workshops that manufacture the pills, packing plants where they are concealed for export, and smuggling networks to spirit them to markets abroad.\", \"An investigation by The New York Times found that much of the production and distribution is overseen by the Fourth Armored Division of the Syrian army, an elite unit commanded by Maher al-Assad, the president\\u2019s younger brother and one of Syria\\u2019s most powerful men.\", \"Major players also include businessmen with close ties to the government, the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, and other members of the president\\u2019s extended family, whose last name ensures protection for illegal activities, according to The Times investigation, which is based on information from law enforcement officials in 10 countries and dozens of interviews with international and regional drug experts, Syrians with knowledge of the drug trade and current and former United States officials.\", \"The drug trade emerged in the ruins of a decade of war, which shattered Syria\\u2019s economy, reduced most of its people to poverty and left members of Syria\\u2019s military, political and business elite looking for new ways to earn hard currency and circumvent American economic sanctions.\", \"Illicit speed is now the country\\u2019s most valuable export, far surpassing its legal products, according to a database compiled by The Times of global captagon busts.\", \"In recent years, the authorities in Greece, Italy, Saudi Arabia and elsewhere have seized hundreds of millions of pills, most of them originating from one government-controlled port in Syria, some in hauls whose street value could exceed $1 billion, according to law enforcement officials.\", \"Officials in Italy found 84 million pills hidden in huge rolls of paper and metal gears last year. Malaysian officials discovered more than 94 million pills sealed inside rubber trolley wheels in March.\", \"These seizures likely represent only a fraction of the drugs shipped, drug experts say. But they provide a window into the scope of the trade, suggesting that the industry has exploded in recent years.\", \"More than 250 million captagon pills have been seized across the globe so far this year, more than 18 times the amount captured just four years ago.\", \"Even more concerning to governments in the region, the Syrian network built to smuggle captagon has begun to move more dangerous drugs, like crystal meth, regional security officials say.\", \"The biggest obstacle in combating the trade, officials said, is that it has the backing of a state that has little reason to help shut it down.\", \"\\u201cThe idea of going to the Syrian government to ask about cooperation is just absurd,\\u201d said Joel Rayburn, the U.S. special envoy for Syria during the Trump administration. \\u201cIt is literally the Syrian government that is exporting the drugs. It is not like they are looking the other way while drug cartels do their thing. They are the drug cartel.\\u201d\", \"Captagon was originally manufactured by a German pharmaceutical company as a stimulant to treat attention deficit disorder and narcolepsy. In the 1980s, users in Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states started taking it recreationally to get an energy boost, banish fear and stay awake to study for exams, work, party or drive long distances.\", \"Its white pills were stamped with two crescents, giving it the Arabic nickname \\u201cabu hilalain,\\u201d or \\u201cthe one with two moons.\\u201d\", \"After it was found to be addictive, it was banned internationally in the late 1980s. But to continue feeding the Gulf market, illicit captagon production took off, including in Lebanon\\u2019s Bekaa Valley, a hub of hashish production and a stronghold of Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militant group that is now part of Lebanon\\u2019s government.\", \"While the pharmaceutical Captagon contained the amphetamine fenethylline, the illicit version sold today, often referred to as \\u201ccaptagon\\u201d with a lowercase c, usually contains a mix of amphetamines, caffeine and various fillers. Cheap versions retail for less than a dollar a pill in Syria, while higher quality pills can sell for $14 or more apiece in Saudi Arabia.\", \"After the Syrian war broke out, smugglers took advantage of the chaos to sell the drug to fighters on all sides, who took it to bolster their courage in battle. Enterprising Syrians, working with local pharmacists and machinery from disused pharmaceutical factories, began making it.\", \"Syria had the needed components: experts to mix drugs, factories to make products to conceal the pills, access to Mediterranean shipping lanes and established smuggling routes to Jordan, Lebanon and Iraq.\", \"As the war dragged on, the country\\u2019s economy fell apart and a growing number of Mr. al-Assad\\u2019s associates were targeted with international sanctions. Some of them invested in captagon, and a state-linked cartel developed, bringing together military officers, militia leaders, traders whose businesses had boomed during the war and relatives of Mr. al-Assad.\", \"Captagon labs are scattered across government-held parts of Syria, according to Syrians in areas where the drugs are produced \\u2014 in territory controlled by Hezbollah near the Lebanese border; outside the capital, Damascus; and around the port city of Latakia.\", \"Many of the factories are small, in metal hangars or empty villas, where workers combine the chemicals with mixers and press them into pills with simple machines, according to two Syrians who have visited them. Soldiers guard some facilities. Others bear signs declaring them closed military zones.\", \"The finished pills are hidden in false bottoms in shipping containers; packages of milk, tea and soap; and shipments of grapes, oranges or pomegranates. Then they are smuggled overland to Jordan and Lebanon, where some leave via Beirut\\u2019s air and seaports. The largest portion leave Syria from the Mediterranean port of Latakia.\", \"The security bureau of the Fourth Division, headed by Maj. Gen. Ghassan Bilal, provides much of the network\\u2019s nervous system. According to regional security officials and a former Syrian military officer, the bureau\\u2019s troops protect many of the factories and ease the movement of drugs to Syria\\u2019s borders and the port.\", \"\\u201cThe division\\u2019s presence in the region is dangerous,\\u201d said Col. Hassan Alqudah, the head of the narcotics department for Jordan\\u2019s Public Security Directorate. \\u201cCaptagon factories are present in the Fourth Division\\u2019s areas of control and under their protection.\\u201d\", \"Maher al-Assad and General Bilal could not be reached for comment. Officials from the Syrian Information Ministry and its diplomatic mission in Vienna did not respond to requests for comment. The leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, has denied that his group has anything to do with captagon.\", \"Other prominent Syrians participate in the business.\", \"A key player near Damascus is Amer Khiti, a businessman whose rise is emblematic of Syria\\u2019s new wartime business class, according to former U.S. officials and Syrians with knowledge of the drug trade.\", \"Originally a modest livestock trader, Mr. Khiti became a smuggler during the war, spiriting food and other goods between Damascus and the rebel-held suburbs with the support of the state, according to Sami Adel, an activist from Mr. Khiti\\u2019s hometown who has tracked his career.\", \"As the rebels were routed from the suburbs, he bought up real estate there and invested in packaging facilities that are used for smuggling.\", \"Another wartime rags-to-riches figure is Khodr Taha, a one-time poultry merchant who oversees Fourth Division checkpoints across the country, where he facilitates the movement of captagon, according to regional security officials and Syrians with knowledge of the drug trade.\", \"Mr. Khiti did not respond to requests for comment and efforts to reach Mr. Taha through companies he owns were unsuccessful.\", \"Both men gave back to the government by spending lavishly on banquets, billboards, rallies and concerts in support of Mr. al-Assad\\u2019s presidential bid this year.\", \"Mr. Khiti also paid to refurbish a military conscription center and other government buildings that had been damaged in the war, and last year won a seat in Syria\\u2019s rubber-stamp Parliament.\", \"In May, Mr. al-Assad awarded Mr. Taha the Order of Merit, \\u201cin recognition of his prominent services in economics and financial management during a time of war.\\u201d\", \"The United States has imposed sanctions on Bashar and Maher al-Assad, General Bilal, Mr. Khiti and Mr. Taha. It called Mr. Taha an intermediary for the Fourth Division whose businesses \\u201cgenerate revenue for the regime and its supporters.\\u201d\", \"Captagon is still produced in and smuggled through Lebanon. Nouh Zaiter, a Lebanese drug lord who now lives mostly in Syria, links the Lebanese and Syrian sides of the business, according to regional security officials and Syrians with knowledge of the drug trade.\", \"A tall, longhaired Bekaa Valley native, Mr. Zaiter was sentenced in absentia to life in prison with hard labor by a Lebanese military court this year for drug crimes.\", \"Reached by phone, Mr. Zaiter said his business was hashish and denied that he had ever been involved with captagon.\", \"\\u201cI have not and will never send such poisons to Saudi Arabia or anywhere else,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEven my worst enemy, I won\\u2019t provide him with captagon.\\u201d\", \"Captagon has probably become Syria\\u2019s most important source of foreign currency, according to Jihad Yazigi, the editor of The Syria Report, a publication that tracks Syria\\u2019s economy.\", \"\\u201cThat does not mean that the revenues earned are going back into the economy,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey are mostly being invested in the bank accounts of smugglers and warlords.\\u201d\", \"So little is known about captagon outside of the Middle East that law enforcement agencies in other regions don\\u2019t always recognize the drug when they find it.\", \"And the smugglers employ ever-changing methods to hide the drugs and transport them via circuitous routes to conceal their origin.\", \"Since 2015, authorities have found captagon in the private jet of a Saudi prince, hidden in oil filters for trucks and machines for making tiles, mixed in with shipments of grapes and oranges, and stuffed inside plastic potatoes hidden in a shipment of real potatoes. Smugglers have buried the drugs with coffee and spices to confuse sniffer dogs and sealed them inside of lead bars and giant rocks to block scanners.\", \"The drugs have been seized in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan, in the ports of Egypt, Greece and Italy, in an airport in France and as far away as Germany, Romania and Malaysia. Most of those countries are not significant markets for the drug but are merely decoy stops en route to the Gulf.\", \"Saudi Arabia, the largest market, has announced as many as six busts per month, with the drugs found in packets of tea and sewn into the linings of clothes.\", \"In May, after Saudi authorities discovered more than five million pills hidden inside hollowed out pomegranates shipped from Beirut, they banned produce from Lebanon, a major blow to local farmers.\", \"According to The Times\\u2019 database, the number of pills seized has increased every year since 2017.\", \"The street value of the drugs seized has outstripped the value of Syria\\u2019s legal exports, mostly agricultural products, every year since 2019.\", \"Last year, global captagon seizures had a street value of about$2.9 billion, more than triple Syria\\u2019s legal exports of $860 million.\", \"Law enforcement agencies have struggled to catch the smugglers, not least because the Syrian authorities offer little if any information about shipments that originated in their country.\", \"The name of shippers listed on manifests are usually fake and searches for the intended recipients often lead to mazes of shell companies.\", \"The Italian seizure of 84 million pills in Salerno last year, the largest captagon bust ever at the time, had come from Latakia. Shipping documents listed the sender as Basil al-Shagri Bin Jamal, but the Italian authorities were unable to find him.\", \"The listed recipient was GPS Global Aviation Supplier, a company registered in Lugano, Switzerland, that appears to have no office.\", \"Phone calls, text messages and emails to the company received no response, and the wealth management firm that the company listed as its mailing address, SMC Family Office SA, declined to comment.\", \"Greek investigators have hit similar roadblocks.\", \"In June 2019, workers in Piraeus found five tons of captagon, worth hundreds of millions of dollars, inside sheets of fiberboard on their way to China.\", \"The fiberboard was branded as Quick Click, a company with no online profile, if it exists at all.\", \"Official documents said the goods were bound for a Chinese company, Shenzhen Xiang Sheng Li Trade Co Ltd. Messages sent to an email address associated with the company received no response.\", \"The documents also listed a customs broker using the name Trista at Seehog, a Chinese logistics firm. When reached by phone, she denied knowing anything about the shipment and refused to answer questions.\", \"\\u201cYou are not the police,\\u201d she said, and hung up.\", \"There was one more clue in the documents: The sender was Mohammed Amer al-Dakak, with a Syrian phone number. When entered into WhatsApp, the phone number showed a photo of Maher al-Assad, the commander of Syria\\u2019s Fourth Armored Division, suggesting the number belonged to, at least, one of his fans.\", \"A man who answered that number said that he was not Mr. al-Dakak. He said that he had acquired the phone number recently.\", \"Loukas Danabasis, the head of the narcotics unit of Greece\\u2019s financial crime squad, said the smugglers\\u2019 tactics made solving such cases \\u201cdifficult and sometimes impossible.\\u201d\", \"While officials in Europe struggle to identify smugglers, Jordan, one of the United States\\u2019 closest partners in the Middle East, sits on the front lines of a regional drug war.\", \"\\u201cJordan is the gateway to the Gulf,\\u201d Brig. Gen. Ahmad al-Sarhan, the commander of an army unit along Jordan\\u2019s border with Syria, said during a visit to the area.\", \"Overlooking a deep valley with views of Syria, General al-Sarhan and his men detailed Syrian smugglers\\u2019 tricks to bring drugs into Jordan: They launch crossing attempts at multiple spots. They attach drugs to drones and fly them across. They load drugs onto donkeys trained to cross by themselves.\", \"Sometimes the smugglers stop by Syrian army posts before approaching the border.\", \"\\u201cThere is clear involvement,\\u201d General al-Sarhan said.\", \"The drug trade worries Jordanian officials for many reasons.\", \"The quantities are increasing. The number of Captagon pills seized in Jordan this year is nearly double the amount seized in 2020, according to Colonel Alqudah, the head of the narcotics department.\", \"And while Jordan was originally just a pathway to Saudi Arabia, as much as one-fifth of the drugs smuggled in from Syria are now consumed in Jordan, he estimated. The increased supply has lowered the price, making it easy for students to become addicted.\", \"Even more worrying, he said, is the growing quantity of crystal meth entering Jordan from Syria, which poses a greater threat. As of October, Jordan had seized 132 pounds of it this year, up from 44 pounds the year before.\", \"\\u201cWe are now in a dangerous stage because we can\\u2019t go back,\\u201d said Dr. Morad al-Ayasrah, a Jordanian psychiatrist who treats drug addicts. \\u201cWe are going forward and the drugs are increasing.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"d22ef57f55b511ec87fd739f19f5e80f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d22ef57f55b511ec87fd739f19f5e80f"}},
