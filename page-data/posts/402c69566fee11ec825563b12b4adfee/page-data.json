The hospitalizations of young children now are \\u201cblowing away our previous Delta wave at the end of the summer, early fall, which had been our highest prior to that,\\u201d said Dr. Danielle Zerr, a pediatric infectious diseases expert at Seattle Children\\u2019s Hospital.\", \"Experts are typically cautious about interpreting an increase in pediatric hospitalizations as a sign that a variant is particularly severe in children relative to adults. There were similar fears about the Delta and Beta variants, but the rise in pediatric hospitalizations then turned out to be more a consequence of the contagiousness of the variants.\", \"This time, too, at least part of the increase in cases is a reflection of Omicron\\u2019s surge across all age groups. The nation is now recording roughly 600,000 cases on average per day, about one in five of them in children.\", \"\\u201cThe more kids that get infected, the more you\\u2019re going to have kids who are going to be sick enough to be hospitalized,\\u201d said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado, chair of the committee on infectious diseases at the American Academy of Pediatrics and a physician at Stanford University.\", \"At Seattle Children\\u2019s Hospital, for example, about 21 percent of children are testing positive for the coronavirus, compared with the average of about 1 percent and a high during the Delta wave of about 3 percent.\", \"\\u201cThat is just a game changer,\\u201d Dr. Zerr said of the more recent figures.\", \"Doctors may be quicker to admit a young child than an adult with similar symptoms, and that may account for some of the rising rates in young children. But some experts said the increase this time might be too steep to be explained only by the usual factors.\", \"One alternative hypothesis for the rise may be that young children are particularly vulnerable to infections in the upper airway \\u2014 exactly where Omicron is thought to be more concentrated in comparison with other variants.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re smaller, their airways are smaller,\\u201d Dr. Kristin Oliver, a pediatrician at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, said of young children.\", \"\\u201cIt does seem reasonable in a disease that if it looks like it\\u2019s affecting the upper airway more, that they would be more impacted,\\u201d she added. \\u201cThey are more at risk for that \\u2014 for longer, prolonged cases, as well as the hospitalization that can come along with a more severe case.\\u201d\", \"That may explain why more hospitalized children aged 4 and younger have tested positive for the coronavirus throughout the pandemic than those 5 and older. It\\u2019s also why young children are more vulnerable to other pathogens, like respiratory syncytial virus, and to having the seal-like cough associated with croup.\", \"For parents of young children, the numbers add another layer of worry as they wait for vaccines to become available.\", \"Alicia Henriquez, a public-school teacher in Chicago, has three children, two of them younger than 5. Her younger children \\u2014 Maxi, 4 and Sofia, 2 \\u2014 are both infected with the coronavirus, but Maxi has no symptoms at all, and Sofia has only a cough.\", \"Still, Ms. Henriquez said she was monitoring their symptoms carefully. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t know if your child is going to end up in the hospital or not, so I think you still have to be careful,\\u201d she said.\", \"The C.D.C.\\u2019s new data were collected by Covid-Net, the agency\\u2019s hospitalization surveillance network, which includes 14 sites and covers about 10 percent of the U.S. population. The rates are likely to be underestimates because of the lack of availability of tests, according to the agency.\", \"Many children who become severely ill have other conditions or have weak immune systems. \\u201cThose kids are definitely at high risk right now,\\u201d Dr. Maldonado said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re seeing more of them now than we were before.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Julie Binder, a gastroenterologist in Philadelphia, has two daughters under 5. Her older daughter, Annie, 4, has an undiagnosed medical condition that results in \\u201csome very bizarre reactions\\u201d to viruses, Dr. Binder said. After a viral infection landed Annie in the hospital two years ago, she had complications for months.\", \"Dr. Binder and her husband have been adamant about maintaining as normal a life for Annie as possible, even during the pandemic. But they have kept her home from day care the past couple of weeks to shield her from the post-holiday spike in infections.\", \"\\u201cHearing this information, I\\u2019m certainly glad that I did,\\u201d Dr. Binder said of the data released on Friday. \\u201cI would have felt much more comfortable through this wave right now if she had been vaccinated.\\u201d\", \"A coronavirus vaccine is not yet available in the United States to children under 5, and is unlikely to be for a few more months. But many older children are also still unvaccinated.\", \"Fewer than 25 percent of children from 5 to 11, and just over 60 percent of adolescents from 12 to 17, have received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine.\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re really worried about your child getting sick, you should be vaccinating your child,\\u201d Dr. Maldonado said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the easiest thing we can do right now to keep our kids healthy.\\u201d\", \"As of Oct. 31, about one in three children hospitalized with Covid was obese. Still, about half had no other known medical conditions, according to data collected by the C.D.C.\"]","href_hash":"402c69566fee11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"402c69566fee11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
