Soft items like garden hoses or gumboots should be moved out of reach.\", \"\\\"It's about trying to make your place less attractive to kea and not encouraging them if they do visit, to stick around.\\\"\", \"Killing protected wildlife is an offence with a maximum penalty of up to two years in prison, a fine of up to $100,000 or both.\", \"Goodman encouraged people who saw kea, particularly in Golden Bay, to report sightings to citizen science project - the Kea Database.\", \"\\\"It gives us a bit of insight into where these birds are coming from and where they are going and how long they are living.\\\"\", \"Anyone with information about the kea shooting and who may have shot the birds is asked to contact the Department of Conservation (DOC) 24-hour number 0800 DOC HOT/0800 36 24 68.\"]","href_hash":"4806cca15eed11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4806cca15eed11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
