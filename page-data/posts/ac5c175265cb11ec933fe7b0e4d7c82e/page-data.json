About\\u00a0seven out of every 10 smartphone users pay with digital wallets each week.\", \"Consumers have also gravitated towards buy now, pay later (BNPL) apps like Afterpay, Zip and Openpay,\\u00a0which are similar to old fashioned lay-by\\u00a0except you can take your goods home straight away.\", \"In the past financial year, Australian retailers processed more than $9 billion worth of BNPL transactions.
