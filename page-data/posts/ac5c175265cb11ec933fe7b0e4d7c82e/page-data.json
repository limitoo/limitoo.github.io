It's something that Sydney busker Rafael Tavares learned the hard way.\", \"Even before the highly contagious Delta variant ripped through Greater Sydney and triggered a three-month lockdown, he noticed that many people who watched his outdoor performances were no longer carrying cash (or even wallets).\", \"\\\"There are days that we expect a lot, but we earn very little,\\\" said Mr Tavares, a former construction worker who goes by the stage name Rafa the Pianist.\", \"\\\"And there are days we don't expect much, but we make a lot.\\\"\", \"Determined to keep up with the latest trends, Mr Tavares, who plays his electronic keyboard across the Sydney CBD, began experimenting with several cashless payment methods.\", \"His audience can now use their mobile phones to pay him via PayPal or make an instantaneous payment to his bank account (by typing in his PayID or mobile number).\", \"They can also scan a QR code which takes them to his profile on \\\"Busk\\\" \\u2013 a website specially designed to facilitate electronic payments to buskers worldwide.\", \"After two months, Rafa the Pianist observed that: \\\"Eighty per cent of [my] income is cash \\u2014 coins and notes \\u2014 and 20 per cent is [from] a cashless payment.\\\"\", \"His earnings have also dwindled in the past few months, but he believes that's more due to lockdowns than our shift towards abandoning cash.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3fcdd5e37f8547a4c3c41fe87165e0cb\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The value of monthly ATM withdrawals peaked at $13.6b in 2008.(RBA, Australian Banking Association)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Electronic payment surge</div>\", \"Most signs point to Australia becoming a cashless society within years,\\u00a0or at least one where cash is a \\\"niche\\\" payment method.\", \"Back in December 2008, we (collectively) withdrew more than $13.5 billion from ATMs each month.\", \"Since hitting that peak, the trend has been a rapidly declining one.

About\\u00a0seven out of every 10 smartphone users pay with digital wallets each week.\", \"Consumers have also gravitated towards buy now, pay later (BNPL) apps like Afterpay, Zip and Openpay,\\u00a0which are similar to old fashioned lay-by\\u00a0except you can take your goods home straight away.\", \"In the past financial year, Australian retailers processed more than $9 billion worth of BNPL transactions.
