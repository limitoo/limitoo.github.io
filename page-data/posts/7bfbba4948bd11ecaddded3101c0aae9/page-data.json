Aziz, one of two men wrongfully convicted of the murder of Malcolm X, said the decision to throw out the verdict against him 56 years after the assassination could not eliminate the decades he had lost.\", \"\\u201cI do not need this court, these prosecutors or a piece of paper to tell me I am innocent,\\u201d said Mr. Aziz, who was released from prison in 1985. \\u201cI am an 83-year-old who was victimized by the criminal justice system.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cI hope the same system that was responsible for this travesty of justice also takes responsibility for the immeasurable harm caused to me,\\u201d noting that his wrongful conviction should have never taken place and was part of a broader trend \\u201cthat is all too familiar to Black people.\\u201d\", \"Thursday\\u2019s hearing came after a 22-month review of the convictions of two men, Mr. Aziz and Khalil Islam, in the 1965 murder of the civil rights leader. The review, jointly conducted by the district attorney\\u2019s office and lawyers for the men, concluded what historians and scholars had long argued: that the case against them was dubious from the start, based on conflicting witness testimony and no physical evidence.\", \"\\u201cI regret that this court cannot fully undo the serious miscarriages of injustice in this case and give you back the many years that you lost,\\u201d said Ellen N. Biben, the State Supreme Court judge in Manhattan who presided over the hearing. As she granted the motion to throw out the convictions, the courtroom burst into applause.\", \"The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr., apologized on behalf of some of the nation\\u2019s most prominent law enforcement agencies before the judge\\u2019s momentous decision, which officially rewrites the narrative of one of the most painful moments of the civil rights era. He had submitted a 43-page motion written with the men\\u2019s lawyers asking that the convictions be vacated.\", \"\\u201cI want to begin by saying directly to Mr. Aziz and his family, and the family of Mr. Islam, and of Malcolm X that I apologize,\\u201d Mr. Vance said as the hearing began on Thursday. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t restore what was taken from these men and their families, but by correcting the record, perhaps we can begin to restore that faith.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Islam, who spent more than 20 years in prison before being paroled in 1987, died in 2009, and those at the hearing lamented that he did not live to see his exoneration. Two of his sons, Ameen and Shahid Johnson, were gathered in the courtroom on Thursday, and tears welled in their eyes after the judge\\u2019s decision.\", \"\\u201cI honestly didn\\u2019t think that I was going to live to see the day,\\u201d said Ameen Johnson, 57, in a brief interview outside the courtroom before the hearing began.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s good but bittersweet,\\u201d he said, noting the absence of his father and mother. \\u201cThey\\u2019re the ones who suffered.\\u201d\", \"One of his lawyers, David Shanies, called Mr. Aziz \\u201ca dignified and brave man\\u201d who \\u201csuffered enough injustice for a thousand lifetimes\\u201d on Thursday, while expressing disappointment that Mr. Islam \\u201cnever lived to see the day of his exoneration.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cNothing can give back these men or their families the decades of freedom that was stolen from them,\\u201d Mr. Shanies said, calling the two men victims of the same racism that Malcolm X spoke against throughout his life.\", \"A third man, Mujahid Abdul Halim, was also found guilty, and his conviction stands. At the trial, he confessed to the murder but said and has maintained that the other two men were innocent.\", \"The news on Wednesday that the convictions were expected to be thrown out spurred waves of reactions from the public, historians and civil rights leaders, who lamented the decades that Mr. Aziz and Mr. Islam spent in prison. The Rev. Al Sharpton called the miscarriage of justice \\u201ca strange and perverted irony.\\u201d\", \"The wrongful convictions also allowed others to escape accountability, compounding the tragedy of a killing that silenced one of America\\u2019s most influential Black leaders \\u2014 a man whose words and ideas still reverberate in contemporary social justice movements.\", \"The men who some historians say were the actual assassins are dead, as well as the witnesses who testified and the police officers who handled the case.\", \"Mr. Vance took up the case in January 2020, after meeting with Mr. Aziz and his lawyers from the Innocence Project and the office of Mr. Shanies, a civil rights lawyer. The \\u201csearch for the truth\\u201d in the investigation was \\u201cseverely impacted by the passage of time,\\u201d Mr. Vance said on Thursday, while apologizing on behalf of law enforcement.\", \"On Thursday, Barry Scheck, the co-founder of the Innocence Project, called for officials to undertake \\u201ca larger investigation with greater access to evidence to get the history right.\\u201d He said that the suppression of exculpatory evidence by F.B.I. and police officials served to inflict \\u201cimmeasurable\\u201d damage to the lives of the two wrongfully convicted men \\u2014 and altered the record of a moment that still holds deep relevance five decades later.\", \"\\u201cIt would have changed the history of the civil rights movement in this country,\\u201d Mr. Scheck said.\"]","href_hash":"7bfbba4948bd11ecaddded3101c0aae9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7bfbba4948bd11ecaddded3101c0aae9"}},
