It was a tradition so ingrained, she even saw family members last year for the holidays, in the middle of the pandemic and against the guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\", \"But this year she decided she\\u2019d had enough.\", \"She and her husband, Brendan, don\\u2019t share views with his family on almost anything. \\u201cOur thoughts on religion and politics and the way we should treat each other and ethics is completely different,\\u201d said Ms. Ivarsson, 28. \\u201cSitting down at a table together is hard because of that.\\u201d\", \"To get to her parents required a 10-hour drive. \\u201cWe get along with them, but it\\u2019s a big drive to do with little kids,\\u201d she said.\", \"So this year she decided to celebrate Thanksgiving sans family. Instead she and her husband invited her best friend and her family over to celebrate (and share the cooking).\", \"\\u201cWe had such a good time, and there was zero drama to it and zero obligation,\\u201d said Ms. Ivarsson. \\u201cI think the pandemic shifted something that made us realize if we don\\u2019t want to spend time with family, we don\\u2019t have to.\\u201d\", \"She now plans to celebrate Christmas with friends as well.\", \"People across the country are saying no more to holiday obligations. After the drain of the pandemic, some are choosing to skip the stress of travel or of spending hours around a table with people they don\\u2019t entirely enjoy. Even those who like their families are choosing to be apart, opting instead to be with friends who live close to them or to go on far-flung trips they\\u2019ve always wanted to take.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve all finally realized we don\\u2019t have to do things the way they\\u2019ve always been,\\u201d Ms. Ivarsson said.\", \"Throughout the pandemic, many Americans have realized the value in taking care of themselves and doing what they want to do, not what\\u2019s expected of them.\", \"Megan Vice\\u2019s family lives on Long Island and wants her to come home for the holidays, but for the past few years, spending Christmas there has been a bummer. \\u201cMy parents don\\u2019t even have a tree anymore,\\u201d said Ms. Vice, a 31-year-old musician who lives in Los Angeles. \\u201cI need to be doing things that make me happy, and for me, Christmas is not an enjoyable experience. As much as I love my parents, this holiday does not make me feel good.\\u201d\", \"This year, she will fly to Chiapas, Mexico, for a 10-day silent meditation retreat in the mountains. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be intense, but I think it will be meaningful,\\u201d Ms. Vice said. \\u201cThe pandemic has made me crave not just new experiences, but ones that are intentional.\\u201d\", \"The pandemic has taught other Americans that virtual connections can be as meaningful as in-person ones. If that is the case, they figure, why spend all the money and time to travel to be with family in person?\", \"Tracy Lee, 40, who works in financial tech in Manhattan, loves visiting her parents and siblings who live in Montana, Arizona and Indiana. But Thanksgiving, when airfare is generally more expensive and the airports are packed, is not an ideal time to fly there. \\u201cI would rather see my family when we can actually do things and not feel forced,\\u201d said Ms. Lee, 40. \\u201cWhy not meet up in August and enjoy a nice week together and not force this holiday on all of us?\\u201d\", \"When she was away from her family over the pandemic, she learned how easy it was to keep in touch with them virtually. So she decided to do that for the holiday this year instead. \\u201cWe played a trivia game with them, some version of Heads Up,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt feels so natural to interact virtually since the pandemic. This is now how we make the holidays work.\\u201d\", \"Thom Tran, a stand-up comedian in Los Angeles, said the pandemic normalized virtual connections so much that this year he felt free to celebrate Thanksgiving away from his parents, who live in New York, \\u201ccompletely without guilt.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMy dad is a 70-something man who now embraces the iPhone like I never expected,\\u201d said Mr. Tran, 42. \\u201cHe now FaceTimes me on a biweekly basis,\\u201d he said. (Mr. Tran spent Thanksgiving serving meals to the homeless, then eating dinner with 25 new and old friends.)\", \"For others, skipping family gatherings last year helped them realize the get-togethers are not that important.\", \"Tony Hurt, 31, a software engineer in Columbus, Ohio, usually spends Christmas with his large extended family at his aunt\\u2019s house, also in Columbus. \\u201cI buy gifts for everyone and I usually spend $600 to 1,000. And it\\u2019s not even about the money. It\\u2019s so stressful buying gifts for so many people.\\u201d\", \"The pandemic helped him have a breakthrough. \\u201cSince we weren\\u2019t able to get together last year, I realized how much money I saved,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt made me realize it\\u2019s not the worst thing in the world to skip spending a day with family I see a lot anyway.\\u201d Instead he\\u2019s going to Puerto Rico by himself for a week to relax on the beach and listen to live music.\", \"\\u201cI would have never dreamed of missing Christmas before the pandemic, but now it makes sense,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI am so excited about my trip.\\u201d\", \"The pandemic also turned friends into family. When they couldn\\u2019t be with their biological relatives, some created a family of friends and neighbors who lived closer.\", \"Caragh Creswell, who works in fashion in New York City, chose to celebrate Thanksgiving with one of her best friend\\u2019s families. For Christmas, she is hosting friends at her apartment.\", \"\\u201cWe have all gone through such a huge, huge emotional roller-coaster together,\\u201d said Ms. Creswell, 29, who is originally from Australia and still has family there.\", \"\\u201cWhat the pandemic has taught me is that family doesn\\u2019t have to represent those that are blood related. Family is made of those people who support you and love you,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSo when I think about who I want to spend the holidays with, it\\u2019s those people.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e5d4290a58e911ec860041a44871c280"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e5d4290a58e911ec860041a44871c280"}},
