Guests included Jeff Bezos (net worth: $197 billion), who after the party flew back to his own yacht, not to be confused with the \\u201csuperyacht\\u201d he is building at a cost of more than $500 million.\", \"The world\\u2019s richest person, Elon Musk (net worth: $317 billion), did not attend. He was most likely in Texas, where his company Space X was preparing for a rocket launch. Mark Zuckerberg (net worth: $119 billion) wasn\\u2019t there, either, but the day after Mr. Gates\\u2019s party, he announced his plan for the metaverse, a virtual reality where, wearing a headset and gear that closes out the actual world, you can spend your day as an avatar doing things like going to parties on remote Aegean islands or boarding a yacht or flying in a rocket, as if you were obscenely rich.\", \"The metaverse is at once an illustration of and a distraction from a broader and more troubling turn in the history of capitalism. The world\\u2019s techno-billionaires are forging a new kind of capitalism: Muskism. Mr. Musk, who likes to troll his rivals, mocked Mr. Zuckerberg\\u2019s metaverse. But from missions to Mars and the moon to the metaverse, it\\u2019s all Muskism: extreme, extraterrestrial capitalism, where stock prices are driven less by earnings than by fantasies from science fiction.\", \"Metaverse, the term, comes from a 1992 science fiction novel by Neal Stephenson, but the idea is much older. There\\u2019s a version of it, the holodeck, in \\u201cStar Trek,\\u201d a TV show that Mr. Bezos was obsessed with as a kid; last month, he sent William Shatner, the actor who played Captain Kirk in the original series, into space. Billionaires, having read stories of world-building as boys, are now rich enough, as men, to build worlds. The rest of us are trapped in them.\", \"Weirdly, Muskism, an extravagant form of capitalism, is inspired by stories that indict \\u2026 capitalism. At Amazon Studios, Mr. Bezos tried to make a TV adaptation of the Culture space opera series, by the Scottish writer Iain Banks (\\u201ca huge personal favorite\\u201d); Mr. Zuckerberg put a volume of it on a list of books he thinks everyone should read; and Mr. Musk once tweeted, \\u201cIf you must know, I am a utopian anarchist of the kind best described by Iain Banks.\\u201d\", \"But Banks was an avowed socialist. And, in an interview in 2010, three years before his death, he described the protagonists of the Culture series as \\u201chippy commies with hyper-weapons and a deep distrust of both Marketolatry and Greedism.\\u201d He also expressed astonishment that anyone could read his books as promoting free-market libertarianism, asking, \\u201cWhich bit of not having private property and the absence of money in the Culture novels have these people missed?\\u201d\", \"Admittedly, it\\u2019s possible these men\\u2019s sci-fi fandom is so much tech-bro-PR blather, but these are very smart people and you do get the sense they\\u2019ve actually read these books. (Mr. Gates, a philanthropist, isn\\u2019t much involved in all this. \\u201cI\\u2019m not a Mars person,\\u201d he said last winter. He read a lot of science fiction as a kid but has mostly left it behind, and, full disclosure, he once put a book of mine on a list of gift books for the holidays, so I\\u2019m in no position to question the man\\u2019s taste.) Muskism, it seems, involves misreading.\", \"Muskism has origins in Silicon Valley of the 1990s, when Mr. Musk dropped out of a Ph.D. program at Stanford to start his first company and then his second, X.com. As the gap between the rich and the poor grew wider and wider, the claims of Silicon Valley start-ups became more and more grandiose. Google opened an R&D division called X, whose aim is \\u201cto solve some of the world\\u2019s hardest problems.\\u201d\", \"Tech companies started talking about their mission, and their mission was always magnificently inflated: transforming the future of work, connecting all of humanity, making the world a better place, saving the entire planet. Muskism is a capitalism in which companies worry \\u2014 very publicly, and quite feverishly \\u2014 about all manner of world-ending disasters, about the all-too-real catastrophe of climate change, but more often about mysterious \\u201cexistential risks,\\u201d or x-risks, including the extinction of humanity, from which only techno-billionaires, apparently, can save us.\", \"But Muskism has earlier origins, too, including in Mr. Musk\\u2019s own biography. Much of Muskism is descended from the technocracy movement that flourished in North America in the 1930s and that had as a leader Mr. Musk\\u2019s grandfather Joshua N. Haldeman, an ardent anti-communist. Like Muskism, technocracy took its inspiration from science fiction and rested on the conviction that technology and engineering can solve all political, social and economic problems. Technocrats, as they called themselves, didn\\u2019t trust democracy or politicians, capitalism or currency. Also, they objected to personal names: one technocrat was introduced at a rally as \\u201c1x1809x56.\\u201d Elon Musk\\u2019s youngest son is named X \\u00c6 A-12.\", \"Mr. Musk\\u2019s grandfather, an adventurer, moved his family from Canada to South Africa in 1950, two years after the start of the apartheid regime. In the 1960s, South Africa recruited immigrants by billing itself as a lavish, sun-soaked, custom-made, whites-only paradise. Elon Musk was born in Pretoria in 1971. (To be clear, Elon Musk was a child of apartheid, not an author of it. He also left South Africa at 17 to avoid being conscripted into the military that enforced it.)\", \"As a teenager, he read Douglas Adams\\u2019s \\u201cThe Hitchhiker\\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy\\u201d; he plans to name the first SpaceX rocket to Mars after the crucial spaceship in the story, the Heart of Gold. \\u201cHitchhiker\\u2019s Guide\\u201d doesn\\u2019t have a metaverse, but it does have a planet called Magrathea, whose inhabitants build an enormous computer to ask it a question about \\u201clife, the universe and everything.\\u201d After millions of years, it answers, \\u201cForty-two.\\u201d Mr. Musk says that the book taught him that \\u201cif you can properly phrase the question, then the answer is the easy part.\\u201d But that is not the only lesson of \\u201cHitchhiker\\u2019s Guide,\\u201d which also didn\\u2019t start out as a book. Adams wrote it for BBC Radio 4, and, starting in 1978, it was broadcast all over the world \\u2014 including to Pretoria.\", \"\\u201cFar back in the mists of ancient time, in the great and glorious days of the former galactic empire, life was wild, rich and, on the whole, tax-free,\\u201d the narrator intones at the beginning of an early episode. \\u201cMany men, of course, became extremely rich, but this was perfectly natural and nothing to be ashamed of because no one was really poor, at least, no one worth speaking of.\\u201d \\u201cHitchhiker\\u2019s Guide,\\u201d in other words, is an extended and very, very funny indictment of economic inequality, a science-fiction tradition that stretches all the way back to the dystopias of H.G. Wells, a socialist.\", \"Early science fiction emerged during an era of imperialism: Stories about traveling to other worlds were generally stories about the British Empire. As Cecil Rhodes himself said, \\u201cI would annex the planets if I could.\\u201d The best early science fiction offered a critique of imperialism. Wells began his 1898 novel, \\u201cWar of the Worlds,\\u201d in which Martians invade Earth, by remarking on British colonial expansion into Tasmania, writing that the Tasmanians, \\u201cin spite of their human likeness, were entirely swept out of existence in a war of extermination waged by European immigrants, in the space of 50 years. Are we such apostles of mercy as to complain if the Martians warred in the same spirit?\\u201d Wells wasn\\u2019t justifying Martians; he was indicting the British.\", \"Douglas Adams was to South Africa what H.G. Wells was to the British Empire. The U.N. General Assembly denounced apartheid as violating international law in 1973. Three years later, police officers opened fire on thousands of Black schoolchildren during a protest in Soweto, an atrocity extensively reported on by the BBC.\", \"Adams wrote \\u201cHitchhiker\\u2019s Guide\\u201d for the BBC in 1977. It takes particular aim at the mega-rich, with their privately owned rockets, establishing colonies on other planets. \\u201cFor these extremely rich merchants, life eventually became rather dull, and it seemed that none of the worlds they settled on was entirely satisfactory,\\u201d the narrator says. \\u201cEither the climate wasn\\u2019t quite right in the later part of the afternoon or the day was half an hour too long or the sea was just the wrong shade of pink. And thus were created the conditions for a staggering new form of industry: custom-made, luxury planet building.\\u201d\", \"This would appear to be exactly what Mr. Bezos and Mr. Musk are up to, with their plans for the moon and Mars, annexing the planets if they could. And Douglas Adams? He wrote \\u201cHitchhiker\\u2019s Guide\\u201d on a Hermes manual typewriter. He\\u2019d decorated that typewriter with a sticker. It says, \\u201cEND APARTHEID.\\u201d\", \"How have these men so gravely misread these books? One clue lies in the science fiction they seem, mostly, to ignore: new wave, Afrofuturism, feminist and post-colonial science fiction, the work of writers like Margaret Atwood, Vandana Singh, Octavia Butler and Ted Chiang.\", \"Ursula K. LeGuin once wrote an essay, a riff on an essay by Virginia Woolf, about how the subject of all novels is the ordinary, humble, flawed human being. Woolf called her \\u201cMrs. Brown.\\u201d LeGuin thought midcentury science fiction \\u2014 of the sort written by Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein, two more writers lavishly admired by Mr. Musk and Mr. Bezos \\u2014 had lost track of Mrs. Brown. This version of science fiction, she worried, seemed to be \\u201ctrapped for good inside our great, gleaming spaceships, hurtling out across the galaxy,\\u201d ships she described as \\u201ccapable of containing heroic captains in black and silver uniforms\\u201d and \\u201ccapable of blasting other, inimical ships into smithereens with their apocalyptic, holocaustic rayguns, and of bringing loads of colonists from Earth to unknown worlds,\\u201d and finally \\u201cships capable of anything, absolutely anything, except one thing: they cannot contain Mrs. Brown.\\u201d\", \"The future envisioned by Muskism and the metaverse \\u2014 the real and virtual worlds being built by techno-billionaires \\u2014 doesn\\u2019t contain Mrs. Brown, either. Misreading both history and fiction, it can\\u2019t even imagine her. I think someone maybe ought to make a sticker. It could read, \\u201cEXIT THE METAVERSE.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"957237a43d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"957237a43d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}},
