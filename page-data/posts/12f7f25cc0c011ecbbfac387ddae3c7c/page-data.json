In the circumstances of such unjustified and unprecedented military aggression, it would be unacceptable for the Russian regime to derive any benefits from the involvement of Russian or Belarusian players with The Championships,\\\" the statement said.\", \"Reigning U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev, who is No. 2 in the ATP rankings, is among the prominent players affected by the ban.
