So much trauma,\\\" said Dr Inna Dymitr, stroking the soldier's pale face as he slipped back into unconsciousness and the ambulance swerved, at furious speed, heading away from the frontlines south-east of Zaporizhzhia.\", \"The young soldier's name was Oleh. In a trench that morning, shrapnel from an exploding Russian mortar had dug a large hole in his lower back, quite possibly severing his spinal cord.\", \"\\\"He's stable, but in a serious condition. We get so many like him,\\\" said Dr Dymitr, listing half a dozen other cases from recent days. She works for a private, Western-funded aid group, MOAS.\", \"As the casualties from Ukraine's counter-offensive mount, it is easy to see why - on a rare visit to this closely guarded section of the southern front - some soldiers and observers are starting to wonder if a breakthrough is possible, or whether Russia's defensive lines, built up and heavily-reinforced over the winter months, are simply too much of a barrier.\", \"\\\"Without more [Western] help, I think we might lose this game,\\\" said Kyrylo Potras, a Ukrainian marine whose lower left leg was torn off by a Russian mine in 2020, but who has now returned to the frontlines. Potras said the presence of vast Russian minefields was proving a huge obstacle.\", \"\\\"These Russians\\u2026 there are a lot [of them]. They have many anti-tank guns and missile systems,\\\" he said.\", \"And yet, one month into this long-planned counter-attack, there are plenty of soldiers and experts who vehemently disagree, judging that the opening phase is going according to plan, and that the active frontline - which stretches in a rough arc for more than 1,000km (620 miles) from the Black Sea Coast up to Ukraine's north-eastern border with Russia - was never going to be breached with the same abrupt speed that Kyiv's forces achieved last year.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nzhttps://rnz-ressh.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--_29UMGyI--/ar_16:10,c_fill,f_auto,g_auto,q_auto,w_1050/v1685126637/4L8D5B2_000_33GA3F9_jpg\\\" alt=\\\"This handout photograph released on May 26, 2023 by the Telegram account of Serhiy Lysak, the head of the Dnipropetrovks Regional Military Administration, shows the fire at a medical facility, the site of a missile strike, in the city of Dnipro, amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

It will end with a political deal,\\\" he said gloomily.\", \"The wood theory - by which I mean a frontline more likely to snap and splinter, but not collapse - was brought home to me some three hours' drive southwest of Bakhmut, beyond the small town of Velyka Novosilka.\", \"In the fields and rolling hills that stretch towards the Black Sea, Ukrainian forces were pushing forwards, finding ways through the minefields and attacking Russian positions from unexpected angles, and - slowly, but steadily - capturing significant chunks of territory and several villages and small towns.\", \"\\\"I'm a realist, although some people call me a pessimist,\\\" said Artem, a 36-year-old soldier, as a Ukrainian jet roared overhead. His view was that Russian troop morale was low, and that Ukraine was likely to make some significant breakthroughs in the coming months. But he could not see the counter-offensive turning into a rout, like it briefly did last November.\", \"\\\"The media and society are in a hurry. [But] the worst option is always possible,\\\" he added, wondering what sort of \\\"price\\\" Ukraine would be prepared to make in terms of the likely casualties involved forcing a strategic break in Russia's frontlines.\", \"It is notable that the gloomier perspectives regarding Ukraine's counter-offensive tend to come from soldiers closest to the frontlines and most heavily involved in combat operations.\", \"You could argue that they have the most experience and the most realistic views. But it is also reasonable to point out that these soldiers are least able to see the bigger picture, focused, as they are, on small sections of a huge military operation.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nzhttps://rnz-ressh.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--ropQAoIb--/ar_16:10,c_fill,f_auto,g_auto,q_auto,w_1050/v1686642230/4L7GNV4_000_33J2436_jpg\\\" alt=\\\"A local resident clears debris of a shop destroyed after a Russian shelling in Kherson, on June 12, 2023, as the region deals with massive flooding from the destruction of Kakhovka hydroelectric power plant dam.

We believe and wait. We know everything will be fine. We just need to be patient,\\\" he said with a smile, sitting in the sunshine outside the well-organised field hospital, with the boom of outgoing artillery rounds echoing in the distance.\", \"- BBC\"]","href_hash":"5a34e92c1d4911ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5a34e92c1d4911ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
