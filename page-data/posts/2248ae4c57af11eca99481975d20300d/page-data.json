They displace native flora, they also deoxygenate the water and as that biomass dies off it creates a sediment that is detrimental to native growth.\\\"\", \"O'Neill said it was possible to spray the weeds, however, the uwhi prevent photosynthesis and stop weeds from rising to the surface again.\", \"And as the harakeke gradually breaks down it provides a nutrient base for the native seed growing water plants.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/134877/eight_col_uwhi._leah_tebbutt.jpg?1638348356\\\" alt=\\\"A blessing of the uwhi at lakes edge.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPhoto: RNZ / Leah Tebbutt\\n</div>\", \"While the primary purpose is to suppress the weeds, kaum\\u0101tua of Te Roopu Raranga Ki Rotorua, Jim Schuster, was excited to see k\\u014dura return.\", \"\\\"You can walk along in the shallows with a sort of scooper, and sort of scoop them up.
