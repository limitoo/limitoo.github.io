But they will need to show a negative coronavirus test before coming to the United States.\", \"Mr. Biden made the decision after he was briefed by advisers including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, who said in an interview Friday that the variant appeared to be spreading rapidly and that he and other health officials in the United States were consulting with South African scientists. The White House announced the decision after the World Health Organization said the new variant, labeled Omicron, was \\u201cof concern.\\u201d\", \"By imposing the travel restrictions, the administration will not stop the virus from coming to the United States; in fact, experts said, it may already be here. But it can give health officials and pharmaceutical companies time to determine whether the current vaccines work against the new variant \\u2014 and if not, to create new vaccines that do.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s going to buy us some time,\\u201d Dr. Fauci said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not going to be possible to keep this infection out of the country. The question is: Can you slow it down?\\u201d\", \"Dr. Fauci said the new variant has about 30 mutations, and roughly 10 of them are on a part of the virus that is associated with transmissibility and immune protection. That suggests the virus may be more transmissible and may escape the current vaccines \\u201cto an extent yet to be determined.\\u201d\", \"He said there had been some breakthrough infections among those who had recovered from the Delta variant, and among those who were vaccinated.\", \"But at the same time, he said, scientists do not know the severity of the infections caused by the new variant. It is entirely possible that it spreads more quickly but causes less severe disease.\", \"\\u201cYou don\\u2019t want to say don\\u2019t worry, and you don\\u2019t want to say you\\u2019ve got to worry yourself sick, because we\\u2019re gathering information rapidly,\\u201d he said, adding, \\u201cEven though the numbers are still small, the doubling time is pretty rapid and the slope of the increase is really rather sharp.\\u201d\", \"Biden administration officials said they were continuing to work with health officials in other countries to learn more about the variant. \", \"\\u201cRestricting travel is going to slow its coming, not stop it from coming,\\u201d said Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, chair of the department of medical ethics at the University of Pennsylvania and an adviser to the president during his transition. \\u201cThe fact that it\\u2019s coming here is inevitable. The environment in which it comes may not be inevitable. We can alter the environment.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden said on Friday that the rise of the Omicron variant was another reason for vaccinated Americans to get boosters and unvaccinated Americans to get inoculated \\u2014 a point Dr. Fauci echoed. And Mr. Biden said the development should push the international community to donate more vaccines to nations suffering from a lack of access or poor vaccination rates.\", \"Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota who also advised Mr. Biden during his transition, said the administration had little choice on implementing the travel ban.\", \"But Dr. Osterholm said it could take time before scientists know if the current vaccines are effective against the variant, and how transmissible it is. One way to figure that out is through laboratory studies, which will take several weeks, he said. Another way is to follow breakthrough cases in people who are already vaccinated, which could take months.\"]","href_hash":"5ae1aed04efd11ec89ccc51891d900ca"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5ae1aed04efd11ec89ccc51891d900ca"}},
