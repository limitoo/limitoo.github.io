As the region\\u2019s traditional center of gravity, India has a history of promoting tolerance. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also positioned himself as the champion of Hindus against a history of victimhood.\", \"But the erosion of human rights in India has weakened its moral high ground in a region where ethnic and sectarian tensions are worsening. Sheikh Hasina \\u2014 Bangladesh\\u2019s prime minister and a close ally, who had just sent Mr. Modi 71 red roses on his birthday \\u2014 had pointed words for India, even as she promised to hunt the culprits.\", \"\\u201cWe expect that nothing happens there,\\u201d Ms. Hasina said, \\u201cwhich could influence any situation in Bangladesh affecting our Hindu community here.\\u201d\", \"India is losing leverage in South Asia as its government tries to reshape the country into a Hindu state. In marginalizing and maligning its minority Muslims at home, Mr. Modi\\u2019s government has weakened India\\u2019s traditional leadership role of encouraging harmony in a region of many fault lines.\", \"The shift could also open opportunities for China, which has used the promise of investment and access to its hard-charging economy to cultivate stronger relations with its rival\\u2019s neighbors.\", \"\\u201cThe openly partisan approach to communal issues has created a very peculiar situation for us as far as that moral high ground in neighborhood policy is concerned,\\u201d said Yashwant Sinha, who was India\\u2019s foreign minister when Mr. Modi\\u2019s Bharatiya Janata Party was last in power in the early 2000s. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t say \\u2018you stop it, this should not happen,\\u2019 because we ourselves are guilty of it.\\u201d\", \"Leaders of the ruling party declined to comment. In public statements, officials have pointed to Mr. Modi\\u2019s \\u201cneighborhood first\\u201d focus in foreign policy, something he announced soon after taking office in 2014. They say the Indian leader is deeply invested in improving regional connections \\u201cthat bear prosperity to the neighborhood.\\u201d\", \"Calls for tolerance in the region are increasingly needed.\", \"In Sri Lanka, a Buddhist-majority country, the government has been taking a tougher stance toward the Tamil, a largely Hindu minority whose grievances led to a three-decade civil war, and toward its small Muslim population. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa recently appointed a hard-line Buddhist monk to lead an overhaul of the legal system, though he has been accused of stirring hatred against Muslims and jailed for intimidating the wife of a journalist who had disappeared. The panel overseeing the overhaul effort includes Muslim scholars but has no Tamil representation.\", \"In majority-Muslim Pakistan, where the ethnic Pashtuns and Baloch have long been marginalized, increasing Islamist extremism has resulted in vigilante action against the Hindu minority, who make up just 2 percent of the population. They have faced repeated episodes of violence, vandalism of their temples, occupation of their land and an increase in forced conversion of minority girls, according to Pakistan\\u2019s human rights commission. Prime Minister Imran Khan has spoken out against the abuses, but to little effect.\", \"Communal violence in one country often becomes fodder for the narrow nationalism of the other. Mr. Khan has blamed Mr. Modi for \\u201cunleashing a reign of fear and violence against India\\u2019s 200 million-strong Muslim community.\\u201d Mr. Modi\\u2019s supporters frequently splash videos of the anti-Hindu violence in Pakistan and elsewhere in the region as justification for policies seen as discriminating against Muslims.\", \"But such violence and the abuse of minorities is nothing new in South Asia, a region of deep ethnic and religious fault lines that is home to a quarter of the world\\u2019s population.\", \"The traumatic partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, and the later war-driven split of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971, left sizable ethnic and religious minorities in each country. The domestic policies of one nation inevitably affect the population of another.\", \"Traditionally, how India \\u2014 the largest and the most diverse of the nations \\u2014 tried to manage its affairs set the tone for the rest. Even when sectarian violence flared within its own borders, India was the big brother with larger-than-life leaders like Gandhi and its legacy of ending centuries of colonial rule through nonviolence.\", \"The policies of Mr. Modi\\u2019s party have chipped away at that position, not unlike the erosion of the United States\\u2019 global standing on human rights during the Trump administration. His Bharatiya Janata Party has pursued a Hindu-first agenda that has often put the country\\u2019s Muslims at a disadvantage. The party has also refused to rein in hard-line elements within its ranks, sometimes leading to violence.\", \"Ms. Hasina, Bangladesh\\u2019s prime minister, and others have suggested that the hardening attitudes toward Muslims in India have contributed to violence against Hindus in Bangladesh.\", \"\\u201cThe situation that happened in Bangladesh is empowering the Hindutva politics, and they are trying to exploit it,\\u201d said Mohammad Tanzimuddin Khan, a professor of international relations at Dhaka University, referring to the B.J.P.\\u2019s Hindu nationalist ideology. \\u201cAnd at the same time, the Hindutva politics of India is empowering the B.J.P.-type politics in Bangladesh.\\u201d\", \"The violence last month in Bangladesh was set off by rumors that a Quran, the Muslim holy book, had been disrespected in a Hindu temple. Seven people have been killed, the police said.\", \"That violence has further deepened sectarian tension in India. In recent weeks, a right-wing Hindu group has been organizing large protests in the Indian state of Tripura, just over the border from Bangladesh, against the anti-Hindu violence there. Police have had to deploy heavy security to protect mosques, after members of the group vandalized at least one mosque and burned shops. A group of lawyers and activists who went to Tripura to document the damage found themselves charged with violating a draconian antiterror law.\", \"While some B.J.P. officials criticized the violence, Mr. Modi himself has been largely silent. In contrast to Pakistan, where tensions with India sometimes break out into open conflict, Mr. Modi has cultivated good relations with Bangladesh, and harsh words could sour diplomatic ties between New Delhi and Dhaka.\", \"India\\u2019s neighbors can find friends elsewhere. China, flush with development projects and loans, has actively placed itself as a potentially lucrative alternative. In addition to strengthening economic ties with Pakistan, it has also used Covid-19 vaccines and other aid to improve relations with Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.\", \"But the ruling party\\u2019s Hindu nationalist ideology has made India more inward-looking, said Aparna Pande, director of the India initiative at the Hudson Institute. Previously, its pluralistic example of governance had avoided stoking tensions, and it took at times a paternalistic view toward its neighbors. Now, she said, Mr. Modi\\u2019s \\u201cneighborhood first\\u201d policy appears at odds with the backlashes caused by the Hindu nationalist vision at home.\", \"\\u201cIf you are pushing a nationalist narrative, it is difficult to then ask your neighbors to not do the same,\\u201d Dr. Pande said. \\u201cYou will then see every country in South Asia becoming more nationalist and, forget about anything else, that creates a strategic challenge for India.\\u201d\", \"Today, said Mr. Sinha, the former foreign minister, Mr. Modi\\u2019s silence \\u201ccreates the impression as if we have lost control of the situation or that the state is actively encouraging violence against minorities.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Sinha, who quit the B.J.P. and now belongs to an opposition party, was foreign minister immediately after some of the deadliest communal violence in India in 2002 in Gujarat, where Mr. Modi was the state\\u2019s chief minister. He said such violence did not affect India\\u2019s standing because the country\\u2019s prime minister at the time, Atal Bihari Vajpayee, made clear that the episodes were both unacceptable and isolated.\", \"These days, Mr. Sinha said: \\u201cThe interlocutor can turn back and say \\u2018Why don\\u2019t you practice at home what you preach to us?\\u2019\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3cf679d63ee111ec9ef7eb76041703c1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3cf679d63ee111ec9ef7eb76041703c1"}},
