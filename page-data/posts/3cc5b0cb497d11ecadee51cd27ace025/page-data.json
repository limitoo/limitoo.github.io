But when Hugh (Bill Camp) challenges her by asking why she does not pass for white like her biracial childhood friend, Clare Kendry (Ruth Negga), her response is a revelation, startling me almost as much as it did him.\", \"\\u201cWho\\u2019s to say I am not?\\u201d she snaps back.\", \"In that moment, I realized that what I had considered the B-plot of Nella Larsen\\u2019s 1929 novel, \\u201cPassing,\\u201d had risen to the surface in the writer-director Rebecca Hall\\u2019s adaptation, giving us a narrative that remains all too rare in Hollywood today: the interior world of a Black woman\\u2019s mind.\", \"When I teach Larsen\\u2019s novel to my undergraduate students, I usually start with the obvious: its racial plot and the ways in which Clare finds refuge from racism by identifying as white, only to be tragically alienated from her Black family and community.\", \"But I mainly teach \\u201cPassing\\u201d through what I think is the novel\\u2019s real central conflict: same-sex female desire and the paranoia that begins to overtake Irene, and for that matter Larsen\\u2019s story line, as a result of her unconsummated relationship with Clare. In a 1986 essay on Larsen\\u2019s novel, the critic Deborah E. McDowell explained why this longing had to appear secondary to the emphasis on race. \\u201cThe idea of bringing a sexual attraction between two women to full expression,\\u201d she wrote, was \\u201ctoo dangerous of a move\\u201d in 1929. Instead, \\u201cLarsen enveloped the subplot of Irene\\u2019s developing if unnamed and unacknowledged desire for Clare in the safe and familiar plot of racial passing.\\u201d\", \"Rather than explore the ways that Irene comes into her sexuality, racial passing \\u2014 at the height of segregation in America \\u2014 was considered a far more urgent and thus more conventional theme than that of Black women\\u2019s inner lives. As a consequence, Larsen\\u2019s novel ended up passing, too, eventually taking \\u201cthe form of the act it implies,\\u201d McDowell concluded.\", \"Visually, Hall compensates for the novel\\u2019s restraint through stolen glances, flirtatious phrases, and lingering touches and kisses between Clare and Irene. As Irene\\u2019s tension mounts, the film externalizes it through other symbols: a loudly ticking grandfather clock, a pot of water boiling over and even her breaking a teapot at a midday social in her home. In these hints, we see both Irene\\u2019s desire to break free from the illusion of middle-class domesticity and heterosexuality that she performs, as well as the threat that Clare\\u2019s presence poses to Irene\\u2019s sense of control.\", \"But, to externalize Irene\\u2019s internal thoughts and her sublimated identity, the movie makes what is suggested in the novel far more explicit. For example, Irene\\u2019s confession to Hugh never actually happens in the book. Hall opted to amp up that moment, she explained in a video for Vanity Fair, because she wanted \\u201cto highlight the latent homosexuality and power dynamics\\u201d underlying their shared secret.\", \"But for all that movie does so very well \\u2014 its subtle swing jazz score; its beautiful black-and-white montages evocative of the photographers Gordon Parks and Carrie Mae Weems; and the delightful cat-and-mouse performances by Thompson and Negga \\u2014 it deliberately limits how much access we have to Irene. Such restrictions, after having a glimpse of Irene\\u2019s full personality, further reminded me of how few stories about African American female sexuality and subjectivity have been told on the big screen.\", \"In other words, at this moment, when Black artists are being celebrated and validated as never before, what does it mean to invest in films that fully move us beyond a racist or sexist gaze and into their innermost thoughts?\", \"To date, such layered depictions mainly are found in the indie sphere, like Kathleen Collins\\u2019s recently restored 1982 \\u201cLosing Ground\\u201d; Cheryl Dunye\\u2019s 1997 autofiction, \\u201cThe Watermelon Woman\\u201d; and Ava DuVernay\\u2019s 2010 \\u201cI Will Follow You.\\u201d Not only do these films meditate on Black women\\u2019s struggles to understand themselves as sexual or spiritual beings in the world \\u2014 but they also do so by acknowledging Blackness as one, not the only, marker of their identities.\", \"\\u201cPassing\\u201d reminds us of the need for movies to get us past the surface \\u2014 of skin and sight \\u2014 and revel in the worlds that Black women create for themselves beyond the gaze of others.\"]","href_hash":"3cc5b0cb497d11ecadee51cd27ace025"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3cc5b0cb497d11ecadee51cd27ace025"}},
