The standard sentence for the more serious charge, first-degree manslaughter, is within a range of about six to eight and a half years in prison; the maximum penalty is 15 years, and prosecutors have indicated that they will ask the judge to hand down a longer-than-average prison term.\", \"Body camera videos from April 11 showed that Mr. Wright had gotten back into the driver\\u2019s seat of his car after pulling away from another officer who was trying to handcuff him. A judge had issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Wright that month after Mr. Wright missed a court date on a gun charge.\", \"In the videos, Ms. Potter is heard shouting that she was going to stun Mr. Wright with her Taser, but she had actually drawn her department-issued Glock. She yelled \\u201cTaser! Taser! Taser!\\u201d and pulled the trigger. Then, realizing that she had shot him instead, Ms. Potter shouted that she had grabbed the wrong weapon, collapsed to the ground and sobbed as she said she was going to go to prison.\", \"At trial, prosecutors conceded that the shooting was an accident, but they argued that Ms. Potter, who resigned two days after the shooting, had been so reckless that she should be imprisoned.\", \"The shooting took place during the trial of Derek Chauvin, the white former Minneapolis police officer who was ultimately convicted of murdering George Floyd, a Black man whose death led to a huge protest movement and heightened scrutiny of police killings.\", \"As the highest-profile trial of a police officer since Mr. Chauvin\\u2019s conviction, the Potter trial has been seen by some as a test of whether juries are more likely to convict police officers of crimes after the outcry over Mr. Floyd\\u2019s death.\", \"It is rare for police officers to be convicted after claiming to mix up their gun and Taser, and jurors heard from several witnesses\\u00a0who testified that Ms. Potter had been right to try to stun Mr. Wright. Several police officers \\u2014 including two who were put on the stand by prosecutors \\u2014 testified that even if Ms. Potter had meant to fire her gun, it would have been justified because another officer was reaching into the passenger side of the car and was at risk of being dragged if Mr. Wright drove off.\", \"The final witness in the trial was Ms. Potter, who sobbed as she described the moments leading up to the shooting and said she was \\u201cso sorry\\u201d it had happened.\", \"She had been riding in a police car with Officer Anthony Luckey, a rookie officer she was training, when Officer Luckey began following Mr. Wright\\u2019s white Buick because he noticed that the car had used the wrong turn signal. Officer Luckey noticed that the car had an air freshener hanging from the rearview window, which is against the law in many states, and also had an expired registration sticker.\", \"When Mr. Wright\\u2019s car was photographed by investigators after the shooting, a black, tree-shaped air freshener was on the driver\\u2019s seat, covered in Mr. Wright\\u2019s blood.\", \"Ms. Potter testified that in the moments before the shooting, she had seen the third officer at the scene, Sgt. Mychal Johnson, leaning into the car and that he had \\u201ca look of fear on his face.\\u201d\", \"In finding Ms. Potter guilty, jurors appeared to find that she had not been justified in using her weapon and that she had knowingly taken a risk of seriously harming Mr. Wright, even if she mistakenly thought she was firing her Taser.\", \"Prosecutors argued that Ms. Potter, in meaning to use her Taser, had consciously risked harming Mr. Wright, because her Police Department\\u2019s policies warned against using a Taser on someone who is driving a car. The prosecutors, who work in the office of the Minnesota attorney general, Keith Ellison, also said that Sergeant Johnson had not been at risk of being dragged because only a small part of his body was in the car when Ms. Potter fired.\", \"\\u201cAccidents can still be crimes,\\u201d a prosecutor, Erin Eldridge, told the jury during closing arguments. She called the killing \\u201ca colossal screw-up\\u201d and \\u201ca blunder of epic proportions.\\u201d\", \"In the defense\\u2019s closing argument, Earl Gray, a lawyer for Ms. Potter, said that Mr. Wright had \\u201ccaused his own death\\u201d by trying to flee from the police. He also said Ms. Potter should not be imprisoned for an accident.\", \"\\u201cThis lady here made a mistake, and my gosh, a mistake is not a crime,\\u201d Mr. Gray said.\", \"Tim Gannon, who was the chief of the Brooklyn Center Police Department until he was forced to resign after the shooting, testified that Ms. Potter had not broken his department\\u2019s rules.\", \"Mr. Gannon, who testified for the defense and said he was pushed out for refusing to fire Ms. Potter, said that when he viewed videos of the shooting, he saw \\u201cno violation \\u2014 of policy, procedure or law.\\u201d\", \"At least two police officers who were called to testify by prosecutors gave similar responses when they were cross-examined by Ms. Potter\\u2019s lawyers, including Sergeant Johnson, who said that he might have been killed if Mr. Wright had driven away and that Ms. Potter had been justified in using her gun.\", \"In their closing arguments, Ms. Eldridge argued that the testimony of the police officers was colored by loyalty to Ms. Potter, saying that \\u201cwhen trouble comes, it\\u2019s family that supports you unconditionally.\\u201d\", \"For a week after the shooting, thousands of people gathered outside of the Brooklyn Center Police Department, grilling and providing groceries to nearby residents by day and throwing water bottles and other objects at a line of police officers come nightfall. The police made hundreds of arrests and fired an array of projectiles, including foam bullets, canisters of smoke and pepper spray that made it difficult to breathe.\", \"During the trial, Ms. Potter\\u2019s husband, a retired police officer, sat in the courtroom for much of the proceedings, as did Mr. Wright\\u2019s mother, Katie Bryant, who often cried quietly in court as videos of her son\\u2019s death were shown to jurors.\", \"On the first day of the trial, Ms. Bryant testified that her son had called her when he was pulled over, but that the line had gone dead seconds before he began to struggle with the police. Ms. Bryant said that she raced to the scene, where she saw a white sheet that covered everything except for her son\\u2019s familiar tennis shoes.\"]","href_hash":"0208459a642811ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0208459a642811ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
