People have also been told to work from home if they can.\", \"Whilst little is known about Omicron as of yet, the CDC has warned of deaths attributed to it and early data has suggested that the variant is extremely transmissible\\u2014more so than Delta\\u2014and more vaccine-resistant even to two shots, hence the booster effort.\", \"But Coetzee has criticized restrictions. She wrote in the Daily Mail that she was \\\"astonished by the extraordinary worldwide reaction\\\" to Omicron, referring to travel and domestic restrictions in the U.K. and Europe.\", \"\\\"To date, some 23.5 million Britons have had all three vaccinations, so it's completely over the top to be talking about Plan Cs or lockdowns,\\\" she added. \\\"Indeed, I am disappointed by such knee-jerk reactions. They bear no relation to what we're seeing in surgeries in South Africa, where people rarely even discuss Omicron.\\\"\", \"\\\"The idea that the Omicron variant, and letting it spread, is in any way a good thing is completely nuts. Data from South Africa has shown more than doubling of hospitalizations each week, and predictably with lags, deaths are also now increasing in both Tshwane and Johannesburg.\", \"\\\"The U.K. government reaction, which is largely very reliant on boosters, is not sufficient. It's an underreaction that will very likely cost lives, rather than an overreaction.\\\"\", \"Jeremy Kamil, associate professor of microbiology and immunology at Louisiana State University Health Shreveport, echoed the point.\", \"Kamil shared Coetzee's concerns over travel bans due to their effect on the scientists in South Africa who helped discover Omicron in the first place\\u2014but disagreed that we know enough about the variant to relax yet.\", \"\\\"For all we know, it could be a little bit more dangerous,\\\" he said. \\\"It's so confounding when you look at a population two years into the pandemic, when so many other people who are the most susceptible died right away.\", \"\\\"In the first wave of the pandemic, it takes off the most susceptible; those people aren't contributing to the death rate anymore. And so you're left with people who already have some level of normal resistance. That doesn't mean the virus is less dangerous.\\\"\", \"Meanwhile, Grant said he expects that Omicron cases \\\"will rise substantially over the next days and weeks\\\" and that even if only a small proportion of these people are hospitalized it could put \\\"huge pressure on hospitals\\\" already dealing with winter backlogs.\", \"\\\"Anything that we can do now to reduce the spread of Omicron will reduce the risk of it placing serious strain on our hospitals over the Christmas period,\\\" he said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1951586/heathrow-airport.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A man walks through Heathrow Airport in the U.K. on November 26, 2021.
