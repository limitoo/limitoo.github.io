Its symptoms present in a spate of two-week notices. Its transmission is visible in real time. And few bosses seem to know how to inoculate their staff against this quitagion.\", \"It catches quickly. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a shock when you see multiple people leaving \\u2014 it\\u2019s like, oh, is there something I\\u2019m not seeing?\\u201d said Tiff Cheng, 27, who left her job in digital marketing in July, along with five of her close friends at the 40-person agency. \\u201cIs it my time to leave as well?\\u201d\", \"Quitting rates were high in August, September and October. Then, according to Labor Department data, they climbed even further: More than 4.5 million people left their jobs voluntarily in November, a record high in two decades of tracking.\", \"Economists explained the numbers by noting that competition for workers led to better pay and benefits, driving some to seek out new opportunities. Psychologists have an additional explanation: Quitting is contagious.\", \"When workers weigh whether to jump jobs, they don\\u2019t just assess their own pay, benefits and career development. They look around and take note of how friends feel about the team culture. When one employee leaves, the departure signals to others that it might be time to take stock of their options, what researchers call \\u201cturnover contagion.\\u201d\", \"So quitting begets more quitting, a challenge that employers can\\u2019t always solve with raises or perks. Even a single resignation notice can breed a \\u201chot spot,\\u201d said Will Felps, who teaches management at the University of New South Wales and was an author of a study of turnover contagion.\", \"Mr. Felps and his team studied staffing at a hospitality company and a selection of bank branches, all in the United States, and found that one worker\\u2019s decision to leave is especially likely to inspire others who don\\u2019t feel strongly embedded at the company. In a recent poll of more than 21,000 LinkedIn members, 59 percent said a colleague\\u2019s departure had led them to consider quitting as well.\", \"The office has long been a petri dish for infectious behavior. Lying, cheating and job satisfaction all tend to spread from desk to desk. Financial advisers, for example, are 37 percent more likely to commit misconduct if they encounter teammates who have done so, what researchers refer to as \\u201cpeer effects,\\u201d noting that one case of misconduct results on average in an additional 0.59 cases. Employees also mimic the nutritional patterns of people they sit with in the cafeteria. Teammates are suggestible to one another in far subtler ways than they realize.\", \"But when it comes to heading for the exit, peer effects are particularly potent.\", \"\\u201cWhen you walk by a restaurant and it\\u2019s full of people, it\\u2019s a clue this restaurant is pretty good,\\u201d Mr. Felps said. \\u201cSimilarly, when the people you know, like and respect are leaving a job, you think maybe the grass is greener somewhere else.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Cheng saw her inbox begin to fill with resignation notes last summer. Every other week she got an email from a colleague who was quitting her company, where hours were long and career advancement options seemed limited. She decided to turn full time to her own coaching business, which she now runs from Vancouver, British Columbia.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s always really scary to make a decision to leave your job, and it was nice to be able to see other people were doing it,\\u201d Ms. Cheng said. \\u201cIt didn\\u2019t feel as lonely, or like I was an outsider.\\u201d\", \"A sense of workplace disaffection and restlessness started growing for many Americans in the early stages of the pandemic. For some, social media became a therapy couch, a space to vent those employment frustrations.\", \"Back in March 2020, Erika Cruz, 31, was working at a Silicon Valley start-up, where she had grown disgruntled with the hallmarks of work life: \\u201cmeetings that could have been an email\\u201d and lack of control over her schedule.\", \"She got the motivation she needed to leave that summer when she watched a friend she had met on Instagram ditch a cushy tech job to open a coaching firm. Then Ms. Cruz, who had about six months of living expenses saved up, moved back to her parents\\u2019 home in the Bay Area and put in her one month\\u2019s notice at work. She sought advice from social media about how to start a business. Ms. Cruz realized, though, that there was no one-size-fits-all approach to upending a career.\", \"\\u201cIf you Google banana breads, there\\u2019s over a million recipes online, and they\\u2019re all going to be good but they\\u2019re all slightly different,\\u201d she said. \\u201cYou have to choose your own recipe.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s the story of the pandemic: When people posted their banana bread photos, they influenced their friends to start baking as well. But like quitting, it was something no two people did the same way.\", \"The friend who inspired Ms. Cruz\\u2019s resignation, Cat Del Carmen, 34, agreed that it was important to develop her own quitting strategy. Ms. Del Carmen was able to leave a job at Adobe by cutting back spending on restaurant meals, vacations and TJ Maxx splurges. The six months after she left her job were high pressure financially. Ms. Del Carmen drew comfort from her correspondence with friends on social media who were also navigating the post-paycheck territory.\", \"That bond forged by resignation, as people look to one another for inspiration and affirmation, is a phenomenon that predates the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a huge decision,\\u201d said Anthony Klotz, an organizational psychologist at Texas A&M University. \\u201cIf you Google how to resign from your job, there\\u2019s lots of conflicting guidance. Those answers are not in a company handbook. It makes sense people reach out for sounding boards from trusted others.\\u201d\", \"Aimee Wells, 53, who works in public relations, had her own quitagion experience years ago. She had been working at a global marketing firm in San Francisco, where she bristled at the time constraints of corporate life. She was never able to drop off her son at kindergarten. She remembered watching the 1996 movie \\u201cOne Fine Day,\\u201d in which Michelle Pfeiffer plays an architect who decides to make her family a priority over high-powered work. It left Ms. Wells grappling with how to reset the balance between her own corporate job and personal life (far as it was from the realities of Ms. Pfeiffer and George Clooney\\u2019s).\", \"One evening, on the train coming home from work at 6, she ran into a neighbor carrying shopping bags full of files, office supplies and photographs. The neighbor told Ms. Wells that she had just quit the role that was burning her out.\", \"\\u201cI went home and starting thinking about it a lot more seriously,\\u201d Ms. Wells said. One month later, she put in her own resignation notice, catalyzed by the run-in with her neighbor. \\u201cShe was like my hero.\\u201d\", \"The payoffs for some pandemic quitters have been significant. Nikissa Granados, 26, was weighing whether to leave her job at an Orange County, Calif., school in 2020 to do freelance social media marketing. She made the leap after seeing two of her teammates resign.\", \"Ms. Granados went from making $2,100 a month, spending days on her feet setting up cots for nap time and begging children to wear their masks, to making as much as $8,000 monthly while dictating her own schedule, she said. She realized something now viscerally clear to many child care providers: In her work at the school, the mismatch between strain and pay had been stark.\", \"For employers, replacing just one quitter is a straightforward task. But replacing several, or even dozens, is far more challenging, and the interim period tends to leave existing staff with a heavier load, while recruiters field awkward questions about what\\u2019s fueling all the departures. With quitting rates soaring, some executives are wondering how to lift morale.\", \"Seth Besmertnik, chief executive of the marketing software company Conductor, had seen his company\\u2019s turnover rates hover in the low single digits for years. He even worried that his retention was too strong, making it hard to scout new talent.\", \"Over the last two years, though, turnover rose into the double digits. Mr. Besmertnik had to get creative in his tactics to keep workers content, including adding new holidays and bringing Broadway actors from \\u201cHamilton\\u201d and \\u201cDear Evan Hansen\\u201d to sing \\u201cBurn\\u201d and \\u201cWaving Through a Window\\u201d (respectively) for staff during all-company video meetings.\", \"Career coaches, meanwhile, worry that some people are being too easily influenced by the behaviors of their roaming colleagues. Kathryn Minshew, chief executive of the Muse, a job search site, warns clients that a single employee\\u2019s desire to leave a company shouldn\\u2019t have too much bearing on the decisions that friends make.\", \"\\u201cWhen one person announces their resignation, there are usually some questions from their colleagues and workplace friends,\\u201d she said. \\u201c\\u2018Where are you going? Why are you leaving?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"That Pied Piper trail won\\u2019t always lead people to better options, and Ms. Minshew advises workers to assess their companies with the hyper-individualized approach they might take to building relationships.\", \"\\u201cThe idea that somebody would publish a list of the 50 best people to marry in New York City is silly,\\u201d she continued. \\u201cSimilarly, I think the best companies to work for is a bit of a silly idea.\\u201d\", \"But logical career advice can\\u2019t always prevent the contagion from catching.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s a little bit of a \\u2018take this job and shove it\\u2019 feeling,\\u201d Ms. Wells said. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re in a company where people all start leaving, you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Why am I the last one sitting here?\\u2019\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"42fbc9027ad311ec901b3dd48e73a81b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"42fbc9027ad311ec901b3dd48e73a81b"}},
