He sees vaccinations as a means of culling the population and believes those who don't actively resist vaccinations are complicit in the killing of millions of people.\", \"\\\"Those of you who are really big supporters of the vaccination program, whether you realize it or not, you are a new Nazi. You are part of a Nazi propaganda operation because this is a global Nazi operation,\\\" Wiles said on Wednesday's episode of TruNews.\", \"Wiles predicted COVID-19 vaccinations could \\\"kill off\\\" up to 2 billion people worldwide and gave those who were vaccinated one to two years to live.\", \"Side effects from the COVID-19 vaccine is a leading cause of vaccine hesitancy, but experts have stood by inoculations at being safe and effective at preventing death from COVID-19.\", \"While some people have had significant adverse reactions to the inoculation, officials continuously note that those instances remain extremely rare. Even though the death rate from COVID-19 is small, a person's chances of getting seriously ill from COVID-19 is still higher than their chances of getting seriously ill from the vaccine.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946038/rick-wiles-vaccines-nazis.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Pastor Rick Wiles called people who support COVID-19 vaccinations \\\"new Nazis\\\" and said we need to \\\"go to war\\\" over vaccine programs. </div>\", \"One of America's leading advocates for COVID-19 vaccinations is Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. He pushed for widespread vaccinations under former President Donald Trump and continued those calls when President Joe Biden took office.\", \"Wiles likened Fauci to Dr. Josef Mengele, a Nazi doctor who conducted deadly experiments on concentration camp prisoners. The pastor called him a \\\"mad man\\\" and said Fauci is \\\"allowed to run around free and killing people.\\\"\", \"Wiles isn't the only person to have made the comparison and Fox Nation host Lara Logan recently told Fox News host Jeanine Pirro that the infectious disease expert \\\"represents Josef Mengele.\\\"\", \"Fauci pushed back on the comparison on Thursday, telling MSNBC host Chris Hayes it was an \\\"absolutely preposterous and disgusting comparison.\\\" He called it an \\\"insult\\\" to everyone who suffered and died under the Nazi regime, adding that it's \\\"unconscionable\\\" to compare him to Mengele.\", \"Wiles has been pushing his \\\"global genocide\\\" theory for months and on Wednesday, said someone needs to \\\"stop these mad men,\\\" in reference to people who are vaccinating others.\", \"\\\"We went to war to stop the Nazis,\\\" Wiles said. \\\"We have to go to war now to stop these Nazis.\\\"\", \"Along with calling people who support vaccinations new Nazis, Wiles accused people who get vaccinated of \\\"committing suicide.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"0813ead056be11ec89f25fdc6b36123c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0813ead056be11ec89f25fdc6b36123c"}},
