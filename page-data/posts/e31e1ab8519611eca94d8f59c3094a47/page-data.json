It began more than five years ago, when the authorities opened an investigation into his activities and subjected him to an open-ended travel ban that he says crippled his career and sent him into depression.\", \"On Monday, Mr. Bahgat was spared jail time and fined about $650 \\u2014 an outcome that experts said appeared calculated to serve two purposes: a guilty verdict that would intimidate government opponents into silence while simultaneously presenting a more reasonable face to the audience abroad by not imprisoning him.\", \"\\u201cIt gets harder, it doesn\\u2019t get easier,\\u201d Mr. Bahgat said as he walked out of the courthouse. \\u201cThey think they can change the rhetoric and leave everything as is. And so far it\\u2019s working.\\u201d\", \"As the host of a major global climate summit next year, COP27, the country\\u2019s president, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, is showing signs of growing increasingly conscious of global opinion when it comes to human rights.\", \"But for all the appearance of a softer tone, the reality on the ground in Egypt remains grim for critics of his rule.\", \"The conviction of Mr. Bahgat, who runs one of the few remaining independent human rights groups in Egypt, followed a series of convictions with harsher penalties than the one imposed on him.\", \"In June, Ahmed Samir Santawy, an Egyptian researcher and graduate student of anthropology in Vienna, who was detained during a visit to Egypt and questioned about anti-government posts he had made on social media, was sentenced to four years in prison on charges of spreading false news.\", \"And this month, five activists and politicians, including a former member of Parliament, were sentenced from three to five years in prison, also on charges of spreading false news and using their social media accounts to undermine national security.\", \"More trials of other researchers, activists and bloggers are expected in coming weeks.\", \"Rights groups estimate that tens of thousands of dissidents who have been incarcerated in the last few years, many without a trial, still languish in Egyptian prisons.\", \"The continuing trials and jailings of activists underscore the increasingly authoritarian direction the country has taken under the leadership of Mr. el-Sisi, who became president in 2014.\", \"\\u201cI see darkness,\\u201d said Mohamed Anwar Sadat, a former head of the human rights committee in Parliament, who has more recently played an informal role mediating between civil society groups and the state. \\u201cWe thought the trial would bring a better end to these cases and serve as a way out of the crisis, but we\\u2019re in shock.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Bahgat, the founder and executive director of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights, was on trial under a cybercrime law for a Twitter post last year accusing a government official who had presided over the elections authority of overseeing a fraudulent parliamentary election. The official was a judge who had died.\", \"Monday\\u2019s conviction came shortly after Mr. Sisi made several announcements that had appeared to suggest the state would ease its stranglehold on political opposition and freedom of expression.\", \"In September, he said that Egypt would honor all \\u201cobligations toward human rights and fundamental freedoms.\\u201d And in October, he declared an end to a four-year-old state of emergency that had given the government and its security forces sweeping powers to crush dissent and detain citizens.\", \"The announcements had led to some hope in Egypt that the country might be adopting a more tolerant approach that would allow civil society groups to operate without police harassment and the continuous threat of detention. Skeptics, however, pointed to the introduction of other laws that strengthened the grip of the authoritarian government, and dismissed Mr. Sisi\\u2019s assurances as hollow, made to fend off criticism from the West.\", \"\\u201cThat discourse seemed to signal an opening, but the reality shows the opposite,\\u201d said Khaled Ali, a former politician and lawyer who represents some of the activists still on trial. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a huge contradiction.\\u201d\", \"Going after Mr. Bahgat, critics said, is the latest evidence of a state that is not willing to let up on its efforts to quash free speech and the political opposition, often in the name of maintaining order and stability in a region rife with conflict.\", \"The American secretary of state, Antony J. Blinken, said there were \\u201cissues of concern\\u201d in Egypt ahead of the bilateral talks that took place earlier this month.\", \"\\u201cMaking tangible and lasting improvements on human rights is also essential to strengthening our bilateral relationship,\\u201d Mr. Blinken said, as he highlighted the issues he planned to cover with his Egyptian counterpart during the meetings. First on the list, and ahead of human rights, was regional stability.\", \"Mr. Bahgat is still embroiled in a separate criminal case against a number of nongovernmental organizations and dozens of their members that the authorities have accused of receiving foreign funding illegally. He came under investigation in 2016 and has since been banned from travel and had his assets frozen.\", \"Ahead of Monday\\u2019s verdict, 46 human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, issued a statement calling on Egypt to \\u201ccease the harassment and persecution\\u201d of Mr. Bahgat.\", \"\\u201cThis represents the unprecedented state of oppression that we\\u2019ve been living under,\\u201d said Nasser Amin, a former member in the National Council for Human Rights. \\u201cThere are no practical or realistic measures that point to any real intention or desire to improve the state of human rights in Egypt.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e31e1ab8519611eca94d8f59c3094a47"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e31e1ab8519611eca94d8f59c3094a47"}},
