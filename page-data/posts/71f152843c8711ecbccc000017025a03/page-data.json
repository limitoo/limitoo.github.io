The band was performing in Manhattan and had noticed from Shirley\\u2019s Instagram posts that he was on the East Coast, too. Would he like to come to the show as a guest?\", \"Yes, he answered, though that meant a three-and-a-half hour drive from Jacob\\u2019s Pillow, the dance center in Massachusetts where he and the group he leads, Indigenous Enterprise, had a rehearsal residency. But he also had another idea: Since it was Indigenous People\\u2019s Day, Oct. 11, would Injury Reserve like his troupe to do a set?\", \"And so, at the Bowery Ballroom that night, an audience expecting rap and maybe a mosh pit opened a circle on the floor so that Shirley and his crew, Native Americans from several tribes, had some space. Decked out in many-colored beads, bells and huge feathered bustles, accompanied by flute, drum and song, they did a Fancy Dance, a Jingle Dance, a Prairie Chicken Dance. Before kaleidoscopically juggling as many as 11 hoops, Shirley\\u2019s colleague Jorge Gonzales-Zuniga Jr., of the Salt River Pima tribe, crowd-surfed from the stage.\", \"\\u201cIt was a rock star moment,\\u201d Shirley said during an interview over pizza a week later, relishing how the audience had erupted. It was the kind of response that he\\u2019s always looking for, the kind he encourages in all his shows by getting on the mic and urging people to \\u201cmake some noise.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been going to concerts our whole lives,\\u201d he said of himself and his group. \\u201cWe love getting the crowd hyped. Like at Coachella, with thousands of people screaming \\u2014 we want that in our shows.\\u201d\", \"This is one way that the members of Indigenous Enterprise, almost all in their early or mid-20s, are updating what a Native American dance troupe can be.\", \"Since its founding six years ago, the group has quickly gained attention: It had a cameo in the 2016 music video \\u201cStand Up/Stand N Rock\\u201d with Taboo of the Black Eyed Peas and performed at the Sydney Opera House in 2019. In the past year, Indigenous Enterprise has appeared on the TV competition \\u201cWorld of Dance,\\u201d in the virtual inauguration parade for President Biden and during the N.B.A. finals. From Tuesday to Nov. 14, the company performs \\u201cIndigenous Liberation,\\u201d a new show, at the Joyce Theater in Manhattan.\", \"But while the troupe and its members are young, its practices are deeply rooted. Most of the dancers were introduced to the traditions at an early age, while attending powwows, multi-tribe gatherings of Native people that occur regularly across North America.\", \"Shirley, who is Navajo, was taken to powwows by his mother, a Fancy Shawl dancer. He chose his specialty, the Fancy Dance \\u2014 an athletic style done in multiple feathered bustles \\u2014 because it was the fastest. He learned by watching dancers like his uncle Daryl Jack, who gave him his first regalia, and by studying videotapes of powwows on repeat. Eventually, he started competing and winning prize money \\u2014 though, he stressed, money isn\\u2019t the point.\", \"\\u201cCompetition powwow dance has become a Native sport,\\u201d the Indigenous Enterprise dancer Acosia Red Elk said. She should know. For 10 years, she traveled the \\u201cpowwow trail,\\u201d which she likens to a rodeo circuit, full time, living in a van and a tepee or a pop-up trailer, hitting a different powwow every weekend. Now 42 \\u2014 and called \\u201cauntie\\u201d by Shirley and the younger members \\u2014 she was and is a champion, winning her category, Jingle Dance, in the biggest powwows year after year.\", \"For that dance, women wear dresses festooned with rows of jingly metal cones. As Red Elk tells the story, the practice began in the time of the 1918 Spanish Flu. A young girl of the Ojibwe tribe in the Great Lakes area was sick, and her father was taken, in a vision, into the Northern Lights and given the gift of their healing sound, the electrical vibration that could be reproduced by the jingle-equipped dresses. The dance healed the girl, and the ceremony spread.\", \"The Jingle Dance has had a different healing effect on Red Elk. As a teenager in the Umatilla tribe in Oregon, she said, she was rebellious and on a downward spiral \\u2014 insecure because of scars from a burning accident, ashamed of being Native. But at 16, when she first danced at a powwow, she thought \\u201cThis is where I\\u2019m supposed to be\\u201d and started crying. \\u201cEveryone said, \\u2018You make us proud,\\u2019 and that made me proud,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt gave me identity.\\u201d\", \"Most of the powwow dances are healing dances. That\\u2019s how the Indigenous Enterprise members think of them \\u2014 whether as what Shirley called \\u201cstress relief\\u201d or in the sense that Tyrenn Lodgepole, who is Navajo, was taught by those who initiated him into the Prairie Chicken Dance: \\u201cto dance for the ones who can\\u2019t dance, with a prayer in mind.\\u201d (Lately, Red Elk has become in-demand as a teacher of powwow yoga, which she said she developed to \\u201chelp my people heal.\\u201d)\", \"Grounded in such traditions, the dances, which have a strong improvisational component, are also evolving. Red Elk\\u2019s precise category is \\u201ccontemporary Jingle,\\u201d with much more elaborate footwork and spatial patterning. This is not without controversy. Red Elk noted how people often post complaints about dancers getting too fancy. \\u201cBut we still pray,\\u201d she said, \\u201cwe still feel the spirit.\\u201d\", \"When Indigenous Enterprise appeared on \\u201cWorld of Dance,\\u201d Shirley described the group\\u2019s style as \\u201cNative American with a little bit of hip-hop.\\u201d And the influence of hip-hop is discernible in footwork and bounce, but most of all in attitude.\", \"The idea for the company came the summer before Shirley\\u2019s first year studying film at Arizona State University, when a friend got him a job dancing in \\u201cSpirit of the Mist,\\u201d a Native dance show near Niagara Falls, N.Y. \\u201cI was blown away by the amount of people we were dancing for and that they were paying me to do it,\\u201d he said.\", \"Back home, he thought, \\u201cWhy not start our own thing?,\\u201d he said. He gathered Lodgepole and some other friends and began doing presentations for local elementary schools and community colleges during Native American Heritage Month in November, posting to social media all the while.\", \"Those posts caught the attention of Taboo, who recruited Indigenous Enterprise for the \\u201cStand Up/Stand N Rock\\u201d video in support of halting the Dakota Access Pipeline. \\u201cKenneth is a young visionary, an entrepreneur, a businessman,\\u201d Taboo said in an interview. \\u201cIt reminds me of me and my crew, starting as teenagers to make music for the world.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThey are educating,\\u201d said Taboo, who identifies as Native American and Mexican, \\u201cerasing misconceptions of what a Native person is today. But it\\u2019s not talking down to you or at you. No, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Why don\\u2019t you rock with us and let\\u2019s learn together?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Increasing Native American representation is an aim. Growing up, Shirley felt the lack of it. \\u201cWe want to be seen and for Native kids to see that they are included,\\u201d he said. Or, from another angle, as Lodgepole phrased it: \\u201cPeople only know Peter Pan and Pocahontas, and it feels good to show some authentic, in-the-flesh Native culture.\\u201d\", \"Shirley and Lodgepole see themselves as part of \\u201ca renaissance of Native creators,\\u201d like the makers of the TV show \\u201cReservation Dogs.\\u201d Taboo \\u2014 who brought Shirley in as a consultant on the new Marvel comic \\u201cGhost Rider: Kushala\\u201d \\u2014 agreed: \\u201cIt\\u2019s a moment that\\u2019s turned into a movement of genuine representation.\\u201d\", \"Performing for non-Native audiences is easy, Shirley said: \\u201cWhen we mess up, they don\\u2019t even know.\\u201d Sometimes gentle corrections are required, as when non-Natives refer to the dancers\\u2019 regalia, usually made by family members, as costumes. (A T-shirt in the Indigenous Enterprise clothing line \\u2014 it\\u2019s not just a dance company \\u2014 pairs pictures of headdresses with the slogan \\u201cNot a costume.\\u201d)\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not Halloween,\\u201d Shirley said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not pretending to be Indigenous. When I\\u2019m in my regalia, I feel more like myself.\\u201d\", \"The dress that Red Elk wears to perform the Buckskin Dance is more than 100 years old; it\\u2019s one of the dresses buried during the times that Native dances, along with other aspects of Indigenous culture, were outlawed and suppressed. \\u201cTo dance in that on a New York City stage gives me goose bumps,\\u201d she said.\", \"The program at the Joyce is not the company\\u2019s first stage show but \\u201cthe first that we\\u2019ve, like, rehearsed and prepared for,\\u201d Shirley said.\", \"\\u201cOur type of dance is freestyle,\\u201d Lodgepole added. \\u201cWe usually hype up the crowd, talk about where the dance comes from, and go.\\u201d\", \"This time, drawing on resources from the Joyce and Jacob\\u2019s Pillow, they\\u2019re trying something a little more elaborate. At the show\\u2019s start, before each champion demonstrates a specialty, that dance\\u2019s origin story is told in voice-over, with animations \\u2014 a sort of technologically advanced throwback to the theatrical mode of older Native troupes like American Indian Dance Theater.\", \"Then Shirley takes the mic and the atmosphere becomes more like that of the Bowery Ballroom than most shows at theaters like the Joyce, but also more like a powwow. The respectful response is to make some noise.\"]","href_hash":"71f152843c8711ecbccc000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"71f152843c8711ecbccc000017025a03"}},
