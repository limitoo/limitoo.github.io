Others are humorous in ways that are a bit harder to grasp, relying on references and layers of meaning that can go over people\\u2019s heads.\", \"\\u201cThe feminine urge to \\u2026\\u201d is a meme of the latter sort \\u2014 the kind journalists often subject to semantic dissection. So, shall we?\", \"The phrase is ostensibly about desire, but it is often followed by a negative personality trait or habit (\\u201cthe feminine urge to re read msgs when you miss someone\\u201d); a gender stereotype (\\u201cthe feminine urge to stay single for life and adopt 40 cats and be that cat lady everybody hates\\u201d); or a position on a social issue (\\u201cThat feminine urge to control your own uterus\\u201d). It may also precede a highly specific fantasy (\\u201cthe feminine urge to quit my job, move into a little cottage in the forest and spend the rest of my days playing animal crossing\\u201d). Meme makers have used the format both satirically and earnestly, but most often to poke fun at their own desires and tendencies.\", \"According to the website Know Your Meme, which tracks viral internet phenomena, the earliest documented usage of \\u201cthe feminine urge to \\u2026\\u201d was a Twitter post from 2009. But an official entry for the phrase was not added to the site until October of this year, when Owen Carry, who wrote the entry, noticed it was becoming a trend.\", \"The meme\\u2019s appeal comes, in part, from its adaptability. It may allow someone to share a personal experience, or help spark conversation about a collective issue.\", \"Steph Panecasio, 27, was helping her partner edit an important email when she noticed a verbal tic that she\\u2019d been leaning on. She decided to post about it on Twitter: \\u201cThe feminine urge to finish every sentence with, \\u2018if that makes sense\\u2019 despite knowing it absolutely makes sense,\\u201d she wrote.\", \"\\u201cI literally edit for a living, so I knew it all made sense, but the words slipped out anyway,\\u201d she said. The overwhelming response to her tweet (more than 196,000 likes) showed her she was not alone in that habit.\", \"\\u201cI think there are a lot of women in particular who\\u2019ve found themselves inadvertently softening their language when giving advice, opinions or direction, because there\\u2019s always a chance you could be perceived as \\u2018aggressive\\u2019 or \\u2018pushy,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Panecasio said. \\u201cThe tweet was essentially making light of the fact that we have a tendency to do this. In a way, that was a reminder for me to stop overusing those disclaimers.\\u201d\", \"As is the case with most memes, people have made their own variations of this one, expanding it to \\u201cthe nonbinary urge,\\u201d \\u201cthe masculine urge\\u201d and versions that have nothing to do with gender and are even more specific to themselves.\", \"\\u201cI was seeing a lot of feminine urge memes, and I thought I\\u2019d think of a joke that could apply more to me,\\u201d said River Stanley, 21, who tweeted \\u201cthe nonbinary urge to dress like legolas.\\u201d\", \"Whitney Phillips, an assistant professor of communication and rhetorical studies at Syracuse University, noted that the main appeal of such memes is their participatory nature and their openness to interpretation. \\u201cThey create this wide open space to articulate the full range of a person\\u2019s experience, whether it\\u2019s the feminine urge or the nonbinary urge or the masculine one,\\u201d she said.\", \"Dr. Phillips added that the meme could be categorized as ambivalent expression. \\u201cThis is the kind of meme where it has the potential for being subversive, ironic and really challenging things like traditional gender roles and binaries,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAt the same time, it can significantly reinscribe and reinforce those gender binaries.\\u201d\", \"When Toni Kelani, 23, tweeted \\u201cWhy hasn\\u2019t anyone felt the masculine urge to send me money?\\u201d she had done so as a joke. But there is a bit of truth behind the sentiment, she said. \\u201cI think the tweet resonated with so many women because this is a feeling they want to experience, and who doesn\\u2019t like receiving gifts?\\u201d she said.\", \"Several people noted that the meme was an example of the ways in which the internet has enabled people to express a wider range of identities.\", \"\\u201cNo matter one\\u2019s gender identity or expression, deploying one or more gender constructs playfully in the meme can be subversive and potentially liberatory as a practice,\\u201d said Heather Woods, a meme researcher and an assistant professor of rhetoric and technology at Kansas State University.\", \"Faith Hewitt, 20, who posted her own take on the meme \\u2014 a tweet with four selfies captioned \\u201cthe nonbinary urge to not smile in pictures\\u201d \\u2014 said that \\u201cbeing nonbinary online is easy, but actually living with that in real life can sometimes be challenging.\\u201d The meme, she said, was meant to articulate an experience that other nonbinary people might relate to.\", \"Dr. Woods echoed that sentiment. \\u201cThis meme claims as collective something that otherwise might feel individual or unique. It finds a shared point of connection to bridge differences and create a community within large, amorphous and flexible boundaries,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThat community, that catharsis, can be welcome in times of division.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"26f53c6656b611eca0dfc581cbd486f4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"26f53c6656b611eca0dfc581cbd486f4"}},
