And what kind of reading do you avoid while writing?\", \"It depends where I am in the process. (I tend to have long processes.) Early on and through the middle, I read anything and lots of it. In the final few months to a year, though, I can\\u2019t risk reading anything I can\\u2019t put down to work, so I tend to read good, but less gripping books \\u2014 or, if gripping, short ones. (Just recently, reading Vol. 1 of the Inspector Maigret Omnibus by Georges Simenon and David Ebershoff\\u2019s \\u201cThe 19th Wife.\\u201d Also \\u201cThe Big Blue Jobbie,\\u201d by Yvonne Vincent. Yes, I do read more than one book at once, unless it\\u2019s really gripping.)\", \"Early on, though, I like to read fiction with a strong poetic feel, because the sense of beautiful language is catching (see \\u201cHow We Fight for Our Lives,\\u201d noted above). Not necessarily literary fiction, as such, but authors who routinely play with language \\u2014 I reread all of Reginald Hill\\u2019s Dalziel and Pascoe novels while writing the most recent book.\", \"Now that said book is finished, though, I have a deal with one of my favorite booksellers, to read \\u201cSwann\\u2019s Way\\u201d together. We haven\\u2019t started yet, but we\\u2019ve both been rather busy.\", \"Do you count any books as guilty pleasures?\", \"Well, now, there\\u2019s a fraught term. I\\u2019ve generally felt mildly miffed when people refer to my books as guilty pleasures, feeling that the implication is that the reader considers them in the same light as cotton candy: delicious and fun to consume, but ultimately fluff. However. I mentioned this briefly somewhere online, and someone replied, \\u201cOh, no! When I say that, I just mean that your books are so addictive I can\\u2019t stop reading them, and end up neglecting all my responsibilities. That\\u2019s what I feel guilty about!\\u201d\", \"Which I suppose just goes to show that one oughtn\\u2019t to leap to conclusions about what people mean, at least not without further conversation. On the other hand, perhaps she was just trying to spare my feelings.\", \"What moves you most in a work of literature?\", \"Honesty. Emotional honesty, in particular. Granted, an author is (more or less by definition) not only taking liberties with reality, he/she/they are deliberately manipulating the feelings and thoughts of the reader. Still, emotion that doesn\\u2019t ring true will kill a book for me.\", \"Do you prefer books that reach you emotionally, or intellectually?\", \"I kind of think a good book should do both. Even the lightest of escape fiction needs to have an intrinsic sense of structure, self-awareness and intelligence. On the other hand, I totally consider laughter to be an important emotion.\", \"Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?\", \"I will honestly read anything, including the label on the Tabasco bottle if there\\u2019s nothing else. You know what\\u2019s in Tabasco? Peppers (pur\\u00e9ed, we assume), vinegar and water. So simple \\u2014 but do people make their own at home? No, so why not? And who are these McIlhennys and how did they get this thing started? (I posted a Thanksgiving photo last year \\u2014 featuring our table set for 10, with clean, empty dishes (as everyone stayed home, isolating during the pandemic) \\u2014 but with a glimpse of the kitchen counter, on which was a Tabasco bottle. Some alert soul noticed this, and the company promptly sent me a nice Tabasco caddy, with six different forms of the sauce. My husband urged me to put a bottle of Krug on the counter this year and see what happens.)\", \"That said, I do avoid books in which terrible things happen to children (not counting autobiographies of people who survived terrible things happening to them when they were children; those are fascinating) \\u2014 and there\\u2019s a very small group of authors whose books I won\\u2019t read because the mind I sense behind them disturbs me. (In all fairness, mine disturbs a few people, too.)\", \"How do you organize your books?\", \"What is this strange term, \\u201corganize\\u201d\\u2026? Basically, it\\u2019s management by piles. The TBR pile (well, one of them) is over there, and has everything in it from sf/f and history to hard-core crime and memoirs \\u2014 to say nothing of \\u201cLove Drunk Cowboy,\\u201d by Carolyn Brown, which I\\u2019m taking with me to Europe on Thursday. In the office bathroom, there\\u2019s a pile of historical (mostly) reference books, including whichever of the Firefox books I\\u2019m finding useful at the moment, plus my brand-new (used) copy of \\u201cThe World Almanac of the American Revolution\\u201d (my original copy broke into several pieces, having been used throughout the writing of the last four or five novels), and an intriguing thing called \\u201cHow to Read Water\\u201d (an excellent skill to have), plus an enormous, deliciously illustrated book called \\u201cLichens.\\u201d Down by the girls\\u2019 wing (all our kids are long since grown, but they come back for visits) is a small bookshelf that\\u2019s stacked (the shelves being full of games like Monopoly and something in a black box with a vulgar name that I don\\u2019t have time to go look at just now) with mostly popular fiction \\u2014 chick-lit, fantasy, murder mysteries, biographies, etc. \\u2014 that somebody in the house has already read but didn\\u2019t want to throw away or donate to the library, so there it is for whoever might be interested. And \\u2026 um \\u2026 well, several more of the same. Piles, I mean. <cough>\", \"What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves?\", \"I\\u2019m fairly sure that people who read my books (let alone those who actually know me) wouldn\\u2019t be even faintly surprised that I have titles like \\u201cMedieval Punishments: An Illustrated History of Torture,\\u201d or \\u201cThe Sex Life of the Foot and Shoe,\\u201d let alone \\u201cBlood and Guts,\\u201d or the \\u201cCarmina Gadelica,\\u201d \\u201cThe Mask of Command\\u201d (that\\u2019s military history/commentary, not BDSM (that\\u2019s on another shelf\\u2026)), and three different books on symbology, plus a couple dozen slang dictionaries.\", \"What\\u2019s the best book you\\u2019ve ever received as a gift?\", \"\\u201cAll About Moths and Butterflies,\\u201d which I got for my ninth birthday. It was the first hardcover book I ever owned.\", \"What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?\", \"Omnivorous and dedicated. The sort of kid who gets in trouble at school for reading a book on the playground instead of risking her neck roller-skating (I was and am Completely Uncoordinated). I liked everything, but was especially fond of series: Trixie Belden, the Hardy Boys (never cared for Nancy Drew, who I thought was a simp), Danny Dunn, the Oz books (especially the Oz books!), and two long series of biographies of famous people, intended for children. Also \\u201cThe Moon-Spinners\\u201d and \\u201cMan-Eater,\\u201d which were certainly not intended for children, but I read both in the sixth grade and enjoyed them immensely.\", \"How have your reading tastes changed over time?\", \"I read a lot more non-American/non-English writers, as technology has given me easy access to things like Scandinavian noir and Latin American fiction, that I simply wouldn\\u2019t have found in my younger, pre-internet years.\", \"What\\u2019s the last book you recommended to a member of your family?\", \"\\u201cThe Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies.\\u201d Also \\u201cHorton Hears a Who!\\u201d (Not to the same family member, I should add.)\", \"Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel as if you were supposed to like, and didn\\u2019t? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?\", \"Oddly enough, I\\u2019ve never really felt I was \\u201csupposed\\u201d to like any book. Reading a book is a unique experience, a personal communication between reader and writer. I don\\u2019t like all the people I meet (though I\\u2019m polite to them), and I don\\u2019t like every book I pick up, but it\\u2019s usually obvious within a few pages whether we\\u2019re past the \\u201clet\\u2019s go out for a drink\\u201d phase or not.\", \"As for disappointing/underwhelmed, though \\u2014 John le Carr\\u00e9\\u2019s last few novels. In all fairness, the geopolitical conditions weren\\u2019t helping him out, and it\\u2019s hard to write his kind of books without an overwhelming and personal sense of specific evil and impending doom. Still, I disliked his falling back on simple-minded political disparagement in lieu of character development (granted, still good characters, but lacking the complexity and subtlety of his earlier books). His autobiographical stuff \\u2014 \\u201cThe Pigeon Tunnel\\u201d and \\u201cA Perfect Spy\\u201d \\u2014 were great, though.\", \"Whom would you want to write your life story?\", \"Frankly, I don\\u2019t want anyone to write my life story, but if anyone ever does, I hope it\\u2019s me.\", \"What books are you embarrassed not to have read yet?\", \"Um. I don\\u2019t really consider books as social accessories. I don\\u2019t care in the slightest what people might think of what I do or don\\u2019t read.\", \"What do you plan to read next?\", \"Well, to be honest \\u2014 \\u201cGo Tell the Bees That I Am Gone.\\u201d \\u201cYou read your own books?\\u201d someone said to me in amazement recently, when I remarked that I was looking forward to getting my author copy of the book so I could read it. \\u201cOf course,\\u201d I replied. \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t a book when it left me; it was this huge cloud of sparkly fragments that I\\u2019ve been juggling inside my head for the last few years. Being able to read it straight through (I don\\u2019t write with an outline and I don\\u2019t write in a straight line) is always a thrill.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a0843c80485811ec885e27dac71e361a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a0843c80485811ec885e27dac71e361a"}},
