About 100 people packed a hearing in Manhattan\\u2019s West Village in the summer, eager to vent about an issue dividing neighborhoods across New York City.\", \"The matter at hand: outdoor dining.\", \"As city officials presented a plan to make it permanent, residents waved matching signs with slogans like \\u201cOutdoor Dining Is Home Invasion.\\u201d They loudly booed an official who called outdoor dining a huge success. When another official said New York\\u2019s sidewalks have become some of the best dining options in the world, the audience screamed, \\u201cRats!\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re just absolutely going out of our minds,\\u201d one resident said, to a roaring applause, \\u201cwith the emotional distress of every kind of quality-of-life issue you can imagine.\\u201d\", \"The fight in the West Village signals the challenges ahead for city officials as they seize on an opportunity to codify one of the most transformative changes to the urban streetscape in recent decades. Starting later this month, officials will host citywide hearings for residents to say what they believe outdoor dining should look like in a post-pandemic world.\", \"Marking a pivotal transition in a return to normalcy, New York now faces the same question as cities like Philadelphia and Atlanta that are weighing proposals to keep outdoor dining: Which emergency innovations borne of the pandemic should remain as permanent legacies?\", \"In New York, the program has turned into a contentious battle over who should have ownership of streets and sidewalks. A group of residents sued the city last month, detailing 108 pages of complaints about outdoor dining. Neighbors have confronted restaurant owners and flooded 311 with calls.\", \"Outdoor dining began as an emergency program in June 2020, after the coronavirus shut down indoor dining. More than 11,000 restaurants participated, and the city estimates that the program saved 100,000 jobs.\", \"Supporters say outdoor dining was a vital reimagining of the streets that salvaged an industry where hundreds of restaurants have shut down for good. The program created more equitable access to an experience that had been almost exclusively available in Manhattan, officials say; the Bronx now has more than 650 sidewalk cafes, compared with 30 before the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cBeing able to think about the curb as far more valuable than an individual car parking space has been massive,\\u201d said Emily Weidenhof, director of public space at the Department of Transportation.\", \"Opponents, however, say that living on a street with outdoor dining means suffering through noise late into the night, rodent infestations and mounting trash. The structures block sidewalks, bike lanes, emergency vehicles and parking spots, which critics see as an unfair land grab that enriches the hospitality industry at the expense of other small businesses.\", \"The Department of Transportation, which is expected to oversee and enforce a permanent outdoor dining program, is negotiating legislation related to its implementation. A permanent program, which would first require the City Council to approve new zoning, would begin in 2023.\", \"City planners say they will look to cities like Barcelona as a model to create larger scale pedestrian-only blocks in neighborhoods, with more enforcement around issues like noise and cleanliness. Officials say they have already stepped up violations against restaurants, including removing unused sheds.\", \"\\u201cWe want enforcement, and we want compliance because we don\\u2019t want bad actors ruining it for all the great restaurants out there that are trying to do the right thing,\\u201d said Andrew Rigie, executive director of the New York City Hospitality Alliance, which is lobbying in favor of outdoor dining.\", \"Eric Adams, the Democrat recently elected as New York City\\u2019s next mayor, has said that he would keep outdoor dining but re-evaluate the safety and spacing of the structures.\", \"Mr. Adams described the restaurant industry \\u2014 which drives foot traffic into central business districts, tourist hubs and residential neighborhoods \\u2014 as a \\u201cbellwether\\u201d for the city\\u2019s economy.\", \"In the decade before the pandemic, restaurant jobs, a particularly important source of employment for immigrants and lower-wage workers, grew at double the rate of private-sector jobs overall, according to the New York State comptroller\\u2019s office.\", \"Among registered New York City voters, 64 percent said outdoor seating for restaurants was an important use of curb space in their neighborhood, including 78 percent of voters in Manhattan, according to a poll in December 2020.\", \"Still, resistance to outdoor dining has grown \\u2014 from car owners in Harlem who say the loss of parking spots disproportionately affects blue-collar workers, to older people in Chinatown who say they struggle to maneuver the obstructed sidewalks.\", \"Some opponents have framed the issue as one of class warfare.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a select group of elite people who can sit outside and eat $40 entrees,\\u201d said Jan Lee, the landlord of two Chinatown restaurants, including one without outdoor seating. \\u201cThey need to rethink their own selfishness in this city.\\u201d\", \"At a recent nine-hour city planning hearing, opponents of outdoor dining testified that restaurants had already benefited from federal grants and no longer needed help, calling them greedy. Megan Rickerson, owner of Someday Bar in Brooklyn\\u2019s Boerum Hill, said that the mocking comments were disheartening to hear.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think people understand the margins in which we run on,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t pay myself for a very long time to ensure the survival of my bar and my staff.\\u201d\", \"Some of the loudest opposition has come from the West Village, a downtown neighborhood famous for its historic buildings, gay bars, left-leaning politics and buzzy restaurants. The neighborhood is part of Manhattan\\u2019s Community Board 2, the district with the highest number of sidewalk cafes in New York City.\", \"Unlike some other residential neighborhoods, West Village streets tend to have restaurants, bars and apartment buildings sandwiched next to each other on narrow blocks, where the noise from outdoor diners is more likely to filter into bedrooms and trigger tensions.\", \"Last month, a group of West Village and other residents recruited a civil rights lawyer to sue the city over outdoor dining, arguing that it violated state law by failing to sufficiently consider the program\\u2019s environmental impact. \", \"One plaintiff, Mary Ann Pizza-Dennis, said she spends up to an hour looking for parking in her neighborhood. (The mayor\\u2019s office has said outdoor dining took away about 8,550 curbside parking spots, or less than 0.3 percent of the total spots citywide.)\", \"Ms. Pizza-Dennis, who works in accounting, believes outdoor dining was the reason she saw a rat in her yard for the first time in 15 years of living in the West Village. She enjoys eating outdoors, but added: \\u201cI don\\u2019t outdoor dine in my neighborhood because I\\u2019m opposed to them.\\u201d\", \"But Jessica Radow, a West Village resident who works at a software company, said outdoor diners made her feel safer at night and were a welcome relief from the barren streets at the height of the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cThere are a lot of folks out there, no matter what the change will be, they\\u2019re not going to like it,\\u201d she said.\", \"Many West Village residents were skeptical of the city\\u2019s promises to step up enforcement, saying their relentless calls to 311, the Police Department and the Department of Transportation were often met with indifference.\", \"Stu Waldman said he initially supported the program, but turned against it after the city announced the permanent plan, which he believes was made hastily without enough public input.\", \"\\u201cA lot of the sleepless nights about this have not just been from the noise, but from the loss of civic engagement,\\u201d said Mr. Waldman, a retired children\\u2019s book publisher.\", \"Mr. Waldman said he purchased a decibel meter and routinely recorded noise levels in his doorway equivalent to the volume of a vacuum cleaner.\", \"The noise was so unbearable one night that Dashiell Kupper, who lives in the West Village home where he grew up, confronted a group of 14 diners from Connecticut outside his window. When asked what he said to them, he replied: \\u201cProbably nothing that can be printed in the paper.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Kupper, a youth basketball coach, said he was bothered that outdoor dining was attracting so many out-of-towners, who he feels are not invested in the neighborhood.\", \"Aaron Hoffman, the owner of Wogies, a sports bar, said he was sympathetic to concerns about the neighborhood becoming too raucous on weekends, but described the opponents as a vocal minority who do not reflect the popularity of outdoor dining.\", \"\\u201cOnly the complainers will show up to these community hearings, so it\\u2019s only one side that is heard,\\u201d said Mr. Hoffman, who has lived on and off in the West Village for 20 years. \\u201cThe people who are happy and content won\\u2019t do that because they have lives. They have other things to worry about.\\u201d\", \"Gabriel Stulman, who owns three restaurants in the West Village, said the up-in-arms residents and restaurateurs actually share many of the same goals.\", \"\\u201cI want clean sidewalks too because who wants to eat in trash?\\u201d he said. \\u201cStop acting like I don\\u2019t care about the neighborhood and you do.\\u201d\", \"The willingness of New Yorkers to dine outdoors will be tested this winter, after the city announced last month that propane heaters could no longer be used to provide warmth for outdoor seating, citing fire safety concerns. Electric heaters, which are less powerful, are still permitted.\", \"The cooling weather worries Sacha Langer, a West Village resident who works at a food start-up and frequently dines outdoors. She said she was unbothered by the crowds, despite living near several restaurants on the third floor of an older building. She described the neighborhood as having \\u201cnormal New York noise.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI feel like it would be totally dead without outdoor dining right now,\\u201d Ms. Langer said.\"]","href_hash":"27bc312c46b711ecbb928ba84f30520a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"27bc312c46b711ecbb928ba84f30520a"}},
