Now her confessional art is on view in “Wearing Masks,” her first American museum retrospective.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-18T16:00:12.000Z","content":"[\"Gillian Wearing, one of the Young British Artists (or Y.B.A.s) of the early 1990s, sailed to success on a tide of provocative confessional work. The confessions weren\\u2019t her own: Using masks, cue cards, and other distancing devices, she has been able to convince a stream of ordinary people to disgorge their most shameful secrets on camera.\", \"Since 1997, when she was awarded the Turner Prize, Wearing, now 57, has covered a lot of ground. She\\u2019s continued to amass confessions in photographs and on video, and she\\u2019s made elaborate self-portraits in which she, too, appears in disguise. She\\u2019s also been commissioned to make public sculptures of average citizens, constructed ingenious lightbox videos that look like still photos till they startle you by moving, and even, during Covid lockdown, run off a smattering of paintings.\", \"Samples of all this work are now installed in an expansive new retrospective at the Guggenheim, her first in the United States. Aptly, if inevitably, the show is called \\u201cWearing Masks.\\u201d Despite its variety, though, everything in it revolves around a single question: Who are you, and can I ever really know you?\", \"It\\u2019s a question she addresses to her family, friends, strangers and herself, and it could, given a chance, lead into rich psychological, philosophical or even theological discoveries. But Wearing is so fascinated by the question that she\\u2019s never willing to let it go that far. She typically strips the stories she amasses of their context and makes sure that when she does appear on camera herself, it\\u2019s never too revealing.\", \"When her approach works, it powerfully destabilizes the way you understand what you\\u2019re looking at, and can even enlarge your sense of what\\u2019s possible in art. When it fails, it feels exploitative and suffocating. Frequently, it\\u2019s all of the above.\", \"Wearing first becomes entranced with the challenge of getting to know strangers \\u2014 a stand-in for empathizing with people in her own life \\u2014 in \\u201cHomage to the woman with the bandaged face who I saw yesterday down Walworth Road,\\u201d a short video from 1995. Seven minutes long and narrated exclusively with subtitles, the video purports to document a memorable London encounter and Wearing\\u2019s own curious reaction to it. Catching sight of a paperwhite face, Wearing realizes it\\u2019s a woman wearing a mask of bandages; later, unable to forget the image, she dons bandages herself and sets out to record strangers\\u2019 reactions to her inhuman new visage.\", \"It looks like a true story of Wearing\\u2019s own, a sincere account put together with hand-held camera work and patchy sound \\u2014 and indeed, she did really see a bandaged woman. But the video is more sophisticated \\u2014 and less trustworthy \\u2014 than it lets on. Is Wearing an actor or a character? And when a subtitle claims, \\u201cI was tormented by adverse reactions to my appearance,\\u201d even as you watch her deliberately provoking responses, the contradiction seems designed to underline the deceptiveness of the medium.\", \"For a striking photo series she made around the same time, titled \\u201cSigns that say what you want them to say and not Signs that say what someone else wants you to say,\\u201d Wearing shot people holding large sheets of paper lettered with a panoply of political slogans, religious messages, fragmentary non sequiturs, and dire disclosures that they chose themselves. (Wearing made more than 100 of these photos; 63 are shown here.)\", \"The images alone are full of information \\u2014 facial expressions, bodily postures, clothing choices, all sorts of handwriting and ways of holding a sign \\u2014 but the written content itself is fascinating, too. \\u201cToday is a wonderful day because Krishna made it,\\u201d one man wants you to know, while another presents the gnomic advice, \\u201cCut off the head and the body will die.\\u201d A confident businessman says simply, \\u201cI\\u2019m desperate,\\u201d and a woman smiles as she presents the sentence, \\u201cI\\u2019m depressed at the moment.\\u201d However suggestive the details, though, they all point to so much more unsaid that in the end you\\u2019re left with the unsettling suspicion that you can never really know what anybody is thinking.\", \"In two large series from the mid-aughts, Wearing meticulously recreates family photos (\\u201cFamily Album\\u201d) and art-historical portraits (\\u201cSpiritual Family\\u201d), using highly realistic silicone prostheses to play every role. As explorations of artistic or genetic ancestry, they\\u2019re not especially compelling. But as meditations on the limits of both photography and empathy, they\\u2019re quite effective.\", \"Walking past Wearing\\u2019s parents and siblings, or her artistic forebears, you might take the images, so to speak, at face value. But once you notice the eyeholes, and realize you\\u2019re looking at masks, you can\\u2019t help searching Wearing\\u2019s gaze for expressions. Are her eyes really colder and more ethereal when she plays the German social portraitist August Sander? Does she manage to make them look warmer in a mask of the New York street photographer Weegee? Or are you just attributing human expressions to plastic faces you happen to recognize?\", \"Still, there\\u2019s a slippery line between exposing epistemological uncertainty and imposing it. In a series of polyptychs, \\u201cA Woman Called Theresa,\\u201d Wearing pairs photos of the woman in bed with seven different lovers, all \\u201cstreet drinkers\\u201d like Theresa, with actual notes the men have written about her, most of them disparaging. Because Wearing lets this information, however partial and edited, speak for itself, the results are heartbreaking.\", \"\\u201cFear and Loathing,\\u201d the latest in a series of videos in which people divulge their secrets while wearing creepy masks, is different. A man with a doll\\u2019s head describing his inexplicable mayonnaise phobia is kind of funny, though the joke may still be on him. A woman recounting horrific sexual abuse she\\u2019s suffered \\u2014 in a similarly off-putting plastic face \\u2014 is simply infuriating, less an exposure of our inability to understand the woman\\u2019s pain than Wearing willfully refusing to let us try.\", \"In her most recent works \\u2014 a vitrine of Polaroid selfies, a wall of computer-aged self-portraits, and a faux-advertising video in which actors wear digital Gillian Wearing masks \\u2014 Wearing dives headlong into self-portrait as conceptual performance, but the sheer number of poses muddy the idea without adding any real substance.\", \"Photographers of the past, like August Sander and Weegee, or like Diane Arbus, had distinct voices because they had particular aesthetic preferences and points of view. You get the sense of who they were as artists from what they chose to shoot, and how they shot it. But they were also genuinely interested in the people they were photographing, and that interest came across. What Wearing does \\u2014 and it\\u2019s both her strength and her weakness \\u2014 is to use people\\u2019s stories, and even her own, as material to illustrate high-concept ideas. What is identity? What is authenticity? What kind of media can you trust? Without answers, these questions are fascinating, and maddening, and eternal.\"]","href_hash":"897c5838488811ecbdb4cdeafeec5b30"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"897c5838488811ecbdb4cdeafeec5b30"}},
