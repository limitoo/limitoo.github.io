We're not forecasting any challenges in that area.\\\"\", \"The Ministry of Health said 6.9 million rapid antigen tests were in the country as of yesterday, and around 14.7m were expected by the end of the month.\", \"Hannant said most people going to testing centres would be offered rapid antigen tests which they would take away and do at home.\", \"\\\"For a few people, where it's clinically indicated, they'll get taken through for a PCR.\\\"\", \"People only needed to get tested if they were symptomatic, close contacts or had been advised to get a test, he said. They should enter their results online online in My Covid Record, or ring a helpline (0800 222 478) for advice.\", \"Yesterday 3297 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in the community in New Zealand.\", \"Pasifika GP network chair and Auckland-based GP Dr Api Talemaitoga said they were ready to give rapid antigen tests.\", \"Talemaitoga said his clinic had a limited supply but were told they could now order more.\", \"\\\"We were lucky, we've snuck in a few orders in January but then we were told we couldn't order any more so we're hanging out for today.\\\"\", \"The government's phase three Omicron response will be easier for those doing the tests and for laboratories which will not have the amount of PCR swabs to process, he said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/138807/three_col_Api_Talemaitoga.jpg?1645646375\\\" alt=\\\"Dr Api Talemaitoga\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nDr Api Talemaitoga. \\nPhoto: Supplied\\n</div>\", \"\\\"We would support them in this self-management phase so they could do the tests at home.\", \"\\\"It might take a bit of time at the beginning as we just show people how it's done at our clinic but it's really straightforward and people should be able to do it on their own.\", \"In general, the clinic's patients who were isolating at home were managing well, and the practice was ringing Covid-19-positive patients they were notified about.\", \"\\\"A lot of it is anxiety. Most, thankfully, have been mild, or managing with fluids, paracetamol, lozenges.\", \"\\\"Out of the maybe 40 positive cases at our small clinic, two have been serious enough to warrant a couple of calls a day - one ended up going to hospital.\\\"\", \"The clinic was telling patients \\\"don't be scared, be prepared\\\" for self-isolation.\", \"\\\"I know that some people will be getting a bit worried, but its better that you get prepared now before someone causes you to be isolating at home.\\\"\", \"The Counties Manukau DHB area has more than 8000 active cases, more than twice the number of the Auckland DHB area, the next highest.\"]","href_hash":"7789e516950711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7789e516950711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
