Calhoun as part of an exhibit on the Confederacy, The Associated Press reported Thursday.\", \"The Charleston Commission on History voted Wednesday to delay their recommendation to the city council until they learn more information.\", \"According to WCSC, a South Carolina news channel, the commission is wary of the exhibit displaying Calhoun and his statue without what they believe to be the right amount of perspective and nuance.\", \"LAXART Director Hamza Walker wrote the letter requesting the statue, saying the exhibit would \\\"encompass the prospect of reparations, healing and a greater reckoning of America's past...\\\" and would include several other monuments to the Confederacy that have been removed from public spaces in the last several years.\", \"Charleston has owned the statue of Calhoun since 1885 when it was given the deed from the Ladies Calhoun Memorial Association. It was removed from Marion Square in Charleston in June 2020 amidst objections over Calhoun's pro-slavery beliefs during nationwide protests after the murder of George Floyd.\", \"Walker wrote in his letter to the commission that although Calhoun died before the Civil War, the statue would be a valuable part of the planned 2022 exhibition because of his role in the \\\"expansion and protection of slavery in the United States\\\" and was in favor of South Carolina seceding from the Union before the war.\", \"Calhoun served as secretary of war under President James Monroe, as well as vice president for John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935972/charleston-john-calhoun-statue-confederacy.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The John C.

He said in several speeches on the U.S. Senate floor in the 1830s that slaves in the South were better off than free Blacks in the North while calling slavery a \\\"positive good.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"c687dc6448e411ec836373c5b6c9508b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c687dc6448e411ec836373c5b6c9508b"}},
