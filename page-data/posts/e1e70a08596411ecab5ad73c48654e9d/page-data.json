However, New York City is the largest city yet to grant non-citizens voting rights.\", \"\\\"It is no secret, we are making history today. Fifty years down the line when our children look back at this moment they will see a diverse coalition of advocates who came together to write a new chapter in New York City's history by giving immigrant New Yorkers the power of the ballot,\\\" said Council Member Ydanis Rodriguez, a main sponsor of the bill, after Thursday's vote in a statement.\", \"The Board of Elections expects to develop an implementation plan by July.

Arizona and North Dakota already had prohibitions on the books.\", \"\\\"The bill we're doing today will have national repercussions,\\\" said the council's majority leader, Laurie Cumbo, a Democrat who opposed the bill. She expressed concern that the measure could diminish the influence of African American voters.\", \"Legally documented, voting-age non-citizens comprise nearly one in nine of the city's 7 million voting-age inhabitants. The measure would allow non-citizens who have been lawful permanent residents of the city for at least 30 days, as well as those authorized to work in the U.S., including so-called \\\"Dreamers,\\\" to help select the city's mayor, city council members, borough presidents, comptroller and public advocate.\", \"Even if de Blasio were to decide to veto the bill, there was enough support to override it. The measure would become law by default if the mayor decides not to act on it.
