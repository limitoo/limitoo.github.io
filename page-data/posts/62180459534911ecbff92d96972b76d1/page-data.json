The city wants to teach fashion and media a lesson.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-02T08:25:54.000Z","content":"[\"In 2017, the French magazine L\\u2019Officiel announced the creation of an American edition, L\\u2019Officiel USA, promising coverage of high fashion, art and travel through an international lens.\", \"Over the next four years, that coverage included a series of video interviews about beauty; dispatches from the men\\u2019s fashion shows in Florence, Italy; articles about a vegan restaurant in SoHo and a national chain of marijuana dispensaries; and profiles of the singer Chaka Khan and the writer Elizabeth Wurtzel.\", \"But this week, those articles were among many cited in a lawsuit filed against L\\u2019Officiel USA Inc. by the City of New York, on behalf of writers, producers, photographers, illustrators and more who said they were not paid for their work, or not paid in a timely manner. Peter Hatch, the commissioner of the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection, described the case as \\u201ccorporate theft from New York City\\u2019s industrious creatives.\\u201d\", \"In combining the experiences of two dozen workers, the suit is the first large so-called pattern-of-practice case in New York, Mr. Hatch said, brought forward under a 2017 law called the Freelance Isn\\u2019t Free Act. One provision of the law allows freelance workers to pursue late payments by filing complaints with the Department of Consumer and Worker Protection.\", \"When the department receives a complaint, it responds by sending a written notice to the company named in the complaint, giving it 20 days to respond with either proof that the freelancer has been fully paid or acknowledgment that the freelancer hasn\\u2019t been paid (and an explanation as to why).\", \"Often this is enough to get freelancers paid the money they are owed, Mr. Hatch said. But when the department began sending notices to L\\u2019Officiel USA in 2018, it \\u201cwent silent on us,\\u201d he said. There are 24 complaints cited in the lawsuit; in all but two of them, the city said, the magazine did not respond to notices sent by the worker protection department.\", \"The magazine\\u2019s top officials \\u2014 the chairman of L\\u2019Officiel USA, the chief executive of L\\u2019Officiel Inc. in France and the chief creative officer for L\\u2019Officiel USA \\u2014 did not respond to several emailed requests for comment for this article.\", \"Freelancers who made complaints against L\\u2019Officiel described feeling ghosted. Many consider late payments to be an upsetting but fairly typical aspect of their working lives. Sometimes, publicly naming a delinquent company can hasten payment. But that wasn\\u2019t the case here, said Natasha Stagg, a writer who said she is owed $1,000 for her article on Ms. Wurtzel.\", \"\\u201cI tweeted about the L\\u2019Officiel thing,\\u201d she said. \\u201cInstead of getting paid, I just got a ton of DMs from people who had also not gotten paid.\\u201d\", \"It has also been demoralizing, Ms. Stagg said, to see the fashion magazine undergo a kind of rebranding in 2020 \\u2014 reportedly boosted with several million dollars from an American investment firm \\u2014 while some freelancers were already fighting L\\u2019Officiel in French courts.\", \"In recent years, the fashion industry has faced scrutiny for its longtime practice of low wages for interns, entry-level workers, and contractors or freelancers. This practice often created conditions that allowed only those with wealth or a strong safety net to enter the field.\", \"\\u201cI think the industry is so full of people who don\\u2019t work for money but for clout, or even the joy of being involved in fashion or publishing, and so not getting paid isn\\u2019t the biggest deal to them,\\u201d Ms. Stagg said. \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to ruffle feathers or make it seem like they need money because that\\u2019s antithetical to the image that they\\u2019re trying to project.\\u201d\", \"Dean Quigley, who worked on contract as an art director for L\\u2019Officiel USA in the fall of 2019, is named in the complaint as being owed $15,320 \\u2014 money, he said, that could have provided more stability at the start of the pandemic or helped him pay off student loan debt or medical expenses.\", \"Now that he has a full-time job at a large retailer, joining the lawsuit was \\u201cless so about getting compensated, which I obviously would love,\\u201d Mr. Quigley said. \\u201cBut more so that I don\\u2019t want companies like this to operate in this fashion.\\u201d\", \"The lawsuit asks that the freelancers be granted double their unpaid wages, in addition to civil penalties paid to New York City and the installment of a court monitor to ensure L\\u2019Officiel changes its practices.\", \"Mr. Hatch, the commissioner, acknowledged that court resolutions can come slowly but that bringing the lawsuit would help put \\u201cthis industry on notice,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cIf such a company has the resources to maintain a luxurious corporate image, it\\u2019s all the more unconscionable for them not to pay the actual creators of the content they sell.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"62180459534911ecbff92d96972b76d1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"62180459534911ecbff92d96972b76d1"}},
