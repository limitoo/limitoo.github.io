Enough! To hurt a woman is to insult God, who from a woman took on our humanity -not through an angel, not directly, but through a woman,\\\" he said, in a reference to Jesus's mother Mary.\", \"During an Italian television programme last month, Francis told a woman who had been beaten by her ex-husband that men who commit violence against women engage in something that is \\\"almost satanic\\\".\", \"Since the COVID-19 pandemic began nearly two years ago, Francis has several times spoken out against domestic violence, which has increased in many countries since lockdowns left many women trapped with their abusers.\", \"Public participation at the Mass was lower than in some past years because of COVID restrictions. Italy, which surrounds Vatican City, reported a record 144,243 coronavirus related cases on Friday and has recently imposed new measures such as an obligation to wear masks outdoors.\", \"In the text of his Message for the World Day of Peace, issued last month, Francis said nations should divert money spent on armaments to invest in education, and decried growing military costs at the expense of social services.\", \"The annual peace message is sent to heads of state and international organisations, and the pope gives a signed copy to leaders who make official visits to him at the Vatican during the upcoming year.\", \"Reuters\\u00a0\", \"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"72337b106b3411ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"72337b106b3411ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
