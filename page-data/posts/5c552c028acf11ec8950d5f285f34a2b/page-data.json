It was the first time for nearly six months that the school was full. We left last August and some came back in November, but not enough so yesterday was a great day for the school,\\\" she said.\", \"Macleans College principal Steve Hargreaves said attendance at his school was in the high 90s this week.\", \"\\\"Attendance is really, really good. We are pleasantly surprised at the rate of student attendance and the mood actually.

We're up round the 80 percent mark at the moment. We want to get that up to the 90s so it's a matter of finding out where students are and what they're up to and persuading them and their families that it's good to be back at school,\\\" he said.\", \"As well as Covid, principals are worried last year's disrupted learning has prompted some teenagers to give up on their schooling prematurely.\", \"Watson said usually all of his Year 12 students come back for Year 13 but this year nearly 10 percent have not returned.\", \"\\\"I think most of them are actually working and [we're] looking at how we can either get back to school so they get the qualifications they need or we make sure they have got good employment,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"To be honest the start of the year is usually a bit like this, we work out who's decided to come back and who hasn't.
