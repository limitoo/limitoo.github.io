But not for herself.\", \"\\u201cI think early on, because Andrew doesn\\u2019t have a relationship history, I wasn\\u2019t sure how he would end up feeling about long-distance dating,\\u201d said Ms. Greenawalt, who left a longtime boyfriend to be with Mr. Katz and wasn\\u2019t kidding when she said that he had no dating history.\", \"\\u201cI was never in a relationship before,\\u201d said Mr. Katz, 34.\", \"The two were colleagues at Time magazine in New York when Mr. Katz accepted the job offer from The Washington Post as a digital editor on its foreign desk. She was living in Brooklyn, he in Manhattan.\", \"\\u201cWe were looking ahead to a lot of time and money spent, and a lot of back and forth trips on Amtrak,\\u201d said Ms. Greenawalt.\", \"\\u201cI was always very big into my professional career,\\u201d Mr. Katz said. \\u201cI put everything into it, and didn\\u2019t do much dating. Looking back, I really wanted that job in Washington, but I wanted Marysa as well.\\u201d\", \"A graduate of the University of Maryland, he received a master\\u2019s degree in journalism from Columbia. Ms. Greenawalt graduated from the University of Missouri.\", \"As it turned out, Mr. Katz lasted only six months at The Post. \\u201cThings just weren\\u2019t right,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI needed to get back to Marysa.\\u201d\", \"Fortunately for Mr. Katz, he was able to return to New York in December 2015 as he was rehired by Time magazine to work in a photo editor capacity on a team that included Ms. Greenawalt. (He is now the deputy director of photography at Time magazine; she is a freelance photo editor at The New York Times.)\", \"\\u201cLooking back, if I could take back the whole long-distance thing, I would,\\u201d said Mr. Katz, who worked as a reporter at Time magazine when he first met Ms. Greenawalt in January 2014 at Houston Hall, a beer garden in Manhattan, during a work friend\\u2019s going-away party.\", \"\\u201cWe worked on separate teams at Time back then,\\u201d Mr. Katz said. \\u201cMarysa was a member of the photography department and I was a reporter who occasionally wrote for the department\\u2019s photography blog.\\u201d\", \"[Click here to binge read this week\\u2019s featured couples.]\", \"They were chatting in mixed company at the going-away party until the conversation belonged to just the two of them.\", \"After the party, Ms. Greenawalt told her roommate that she had met someone special.\", \"In the ensuing months, Ms. Greenawalt and Mr. Katz remained friends, and on a chilly night in Sept. 2014, while the two of them were installing an outdoor photo exhibit at Photoville in Brooklyn, he noticed that she was cold.\", \"Mr. Katz promptly removed his jacket and was about to hand it to Ms. Greenawalt, who refused him several times before accepting his warm offer.\", \"\\u201cI was touched by his sweetness,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand that\\u2019s when sparks started to fly between us.\\u201d\", \"That same night, they went to dinner with friends, then walked, just the two of them, along the Brooklyn waterfront, where Ms. Greenawalt told Mr. Katz that she had feelings for him. She also had a boyfriend.\", \"Mr. Katz surely felt the same way, but as long as Ms. Greenawalt had a boyfriend, all he could do was play the waiting game.\", \"The wait was over in November 2014, when Ms. Greenawalt became single and Mr. Katz officially became a part of her relationship history.\", \"\\u201cIf I have to, I can be a very loud, strong-willed person,\\u201d said Ms. Greenawalt. \\u201cAndrew is the only person I ever dated who I haven\\u2019t clashed with yet.\\u201d\", \"The couple had planned to marry Sept. 26, 2020, in front of 150 guests at the Prospect Park Boathouse in Brooklyn, but their plans were spoiled by the coronavirus.\", \"They were wed Oct. 24 before 90 vaccinated guests at the Wythe Hotel in Brooklyn.
