Still, nearly half of Americans feel they pay more than their fair share in taxes. Those who expect to owe money this year are particularly likely to feel they pay too much \\u2014 60% hold this opinion.\", \"But politics plays an even larger role in how people feel about the amount of money they pay in taxes. Democrats and liberal Americans mostly feel the amount of money they pay in taxes is about right, while Republicans and conservatives tend to feel they pay more than their fair share.

Americans earning between $50,000 and $100,000 a year are more likely to be able to save or invest their refunds, but even more \\u2014 four in 10 \\u2014 will be using it to pay bills or debts. Americans earning over $100,000 a year are most likely to be able to save or invest their refund, and just over a quarter from this group will have to use their refund to pay bills or debts. Hardly any Americans regardless of income will be spending that refund on something special or fun.\", \"This CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,612 U.S. adult residents interviewed between March 29-31, 2022.
