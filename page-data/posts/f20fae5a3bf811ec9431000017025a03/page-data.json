Along with the traditional turkey, Mr. Wyatt will spend days preparing his slow-roasted pork shoulder with Alabama white sauce. His wife, Nancy Wyatt, will cook all of her enticing side dishes, like sour cream mini-muffins and sweet potato casserole with sage butter.\", \"Everyone from their extended family is invited. But Mr. Wyatt has made a request: If you want to come by and eat his signature fall-off-the-bone pork, you have to be vaccinated against the coronavirus.\", \"\\u201cI felt responsible for myself, my wife and anybody else visiting my house that day,\\u201d said Mr. Wyatt, 72, who expects at least 15 guests.\", \"Like Mr. Wyatt, many Americans thinking about hosting or attending a bigger Thanksgiving celebration this year are considering a question that has become sensitive and often polarizing: Will they and other guests be vaccinated?\", \"The age-old wisdom about dinner conversation \\u201cis to avoid sex, death and politics,\\u201d said Noel Brewer, a professor specializing in health behaviors at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \\u201cVaccinations have moved onto that list.\\u201d\", \"Still, they threaten to complicate the holiday planning and the meal itself. \\u201cPeople who get vaccinated can also be self-righteous, and some people who haven\\u2019t been vaccinated can be belligerent,\\u201d Dr. Brewer said, adding, \\u201cThat could really be a combustible mix.\\u201d\", \"In interviews, many people \\u2014 both vaccinated and unvaccinated \\u2014 said they were planning to tiptoe around the subject, in some cases avoiding a meal with those they might disagree with. Others, who are immunocompromised or have children too young to be vaccinated, are grappling with how to decline invitations from unvaccinated relatives. And some hosts, worried about safety, are drawing a line.\", \"Mr. Wyatt was talking on the phone with his sister last month about his Thanksgiving plans when he impulsively told her, \\u201cTell your kids they can\\u2019t come unless they\\u2019re vaccinated.\\u201d Within a week, he received a text message from his sister, with a photo of his nephew at a pharmacy where he was getting his shot.\", \"Mr. Wyatt forwarded the picture to his daughter, Emily Plumlee, 41, of Huntsville, Ala. Her father\\u2019s vaccine mandate put her at ease about the get-together. \\u201cI\\u2019m relieved for a sense of normalcy,\\u201d she said.\", \"Last year, the pre-Thanksgiving concerns centered on social distancing and taking risks with the coronavirus. This year, the focus is inoculation; more than 192 million Americans had been fully vaccinated as of Sunday morning, but that is only about 58 percent of the total population.\", \"Those conversations are already happening as people send out invitations, said Richard M. Carpiano, a public-health scientist who studies vaccine hesitancy at the University of California, Riverside. \\u201cWhile lots of invitation lists are taken for granted every year, this year, it provides the opportunity for people to actually set parameters,\\u201d he said.\", \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\u2019s guidance for the holiday season is that people should protect others ineligible for vaccines, such as young children, by getting inoculated and encouraging guests to be vaccinated. The C.D.C. also advises that people gathering with others from multiple households in different parts of the country consider taking additional precautions, like getting a coronavirus test beforehand.\", \"But many people oppose the vaccines, for various reasons. Some said that stance had alienated them from their families and friends.\", \"In Honolulu, Rasa Fournier, a spokeswoman for the Aloha Freedom Coalition \\u2014 an organization formed in September 2020 to fight against stringent health mandates in the pandemic \\u2014 said she had invited family and friends, both vaccinated and unvaccinated, for a vegan Thanksgiving.\", \"\\u201cAll of that fear and distancing is a really awful way to go,\\u201d said Ms. Fournier, 49, who is unvaccinated against the coronavirus because she believes the vaccines are not safe or effective, despite overwhelming evidence that they are. \\u201cWe just want to live life normally, and with love, and with aloha.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Fournier said the vaccine had been used as a way to divide people. \\u201cThe vaccinated people will uninvite people, and it\\u2019s incredibly hurtful and sad,\\u201d she said, adding that she had lost many friends because of her beliefs.\", \"Alana Newman, 35, who lives near Lake Charles, La., plans to celebrate Thanksgiving at her parents\\u2019 home, just outside Dallas. She is unvaccinated, and said she unsuccessfully tried to persuade her parents not to get vaccines. She said she had co-founded the Health Freedom Summit, a group that disputes mainstream information about vaccines and the coronavirus.\", \"\\u201cI believe this might be my last Thanksgiving to be with my parents,\\u201d said Ms. Newman, who worries about the vaccines\\u2019 side effects. \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to start a fight over the topic. I\\u2019m going to go to Thanksgiving and just love them.\\u201d\", \"She said many unvaccinated people would avoid having a Thanksgiving dinner with vaccinated relatives. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot of people who don\\u2019t want to be demonized and humiliated for their decisions,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s easier to stay home and keep things private.\\u201d\", \"Most Americans probably won\\u2019t argue about vaccines at the Thanksgiving table, because they normally gather with people they\\u2019re politically aligned with, said Yanna Krupnikov, a political science professor at Stony Brook University and co-author of \\u201cIndependent Politics: How American Disdain for Parties Leads to Political Inaction.\\u201d\", \"All the same, Dr. Krupnikov said vaccines were a very personal matter for many people, and could enter the holiday conversation. \\u201cNobody would discuss the election or other political issues,\\u201d she said, but \\u201cthey\\u2019re going to think about the vaccine.\\u201d\", \"Even before the pandemic, Elizabeth Bossert, of Bryan-College Station, Texas, said vaccines were a sore subject for her family.\", \"\\u201cWe just kind of listen and silently disagree,\\u201d said Ms. Bossert, 36, who has been vaccinated and plans to observe the holiday at her adoptive sister\\u2019s home in Houston. \\u201cNo sense in arguing with people and making things unpleasant. We always get along at Thanksgiving.\\u201d\", \"But trying to avoid arguments completely can be foolish, said Abdullah Shihipar, a research associate at Brown University. \\u201cI\\u2019d rather have a conflict with a relative now and reconcile it later than have someone die,\\u201d he said.\", \"Although Ashlye Cox, 37, hasn\\u2019t finalized her Thanksgiving plans yet, she said one thing is certain: She won\\u2019t have someone who opposes vaccines over for dinner.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m very, very pro-vaccine,\\u201d said Ms. Cox, a nurse in Rolesville, N.C. \\u201cI just wouldn\\u2019t even want them in there because I wouldn\\u2019t feel like dealing with it. Not in my house.\\u201d Debating the issue with guests would just make her more adamant. \\u201cI\\u2019ll talk about it until I\\u2019m blue in the face,\\u201d she said.\", \"The message is quieter at Brother Jeff\\u2019s Cultural Center, in Denver, where Thanksgiving meals will be given out free, along with the vaccine information the center continually distributes. The center\\u2019s founder, Jeff S. Fard, said he won\\u2019t browbeat people to get vaccinated.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t push mandates and Covid shaming,\\u201d said Mr. Fard, 55. \\u201cWhen you mandate something in our community, it raises more suspicions than comfort.\\u201d\", \"After remodeling her home in Madison, N.J., during the pandemic, Laurie Erickson, 60, said she was looking forward to having a Thanksgiving feast with about 25 people, including children and grandchildren whom she hadn\\u2019t had over for Thanksgiving in three years. But when the Delta variant contributed to the surge of cases over the summer, she and her husband, David, felt it was necessary to impose a vaccine requirement for those over age 11 this Thanksgiving.\", \"She decided to write a note, but was reluctant to send it for a few weeks because she was concerned about backlash. She finally decided to send it to only a small group of relatives at the end of August. \\u201cWe hope you will reconsider your decision to forego [sic] the vaccination,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cFor your own sake and ours, and mostly because we love you, please vaccinate.\\u201d\", \"The guest list dwindled. At least eight people declined to come, and simply said they had made other plans for the holiday, which is traditionally held in Ms. Erickson\\u2019s home.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t regret sending it,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt was guidelines for what we want at our house. It makes me sad, but I don\\u2019t regret it.\\u201d\", \"The varied viewpoints that family members bring together are a hallmark of Thanksgiving, said Timothy Callaghan, a professor at Texas A&M University who studies vaccine hesitancy and health politics.\", \"When people debate partisan issues, Dr. Callaghan said, each side will marshal reasons it is right. \\u201cWe have a very clear evidence base as to why we need Americans to be vaccinated against Covid-19,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhereas with politics, there are two sides and both sides can be heard. But the big difference is that your choice to vaccinate has a huge impact not on only on yourself, but on society as a whole.\\u201d\", \"Christine Natalie, 35, of Bennington County, Vt., says it is still too risky for her to join a large Thanksgiving gathering because she has undergone immunomodulation therapy, which would make her more vulnerable if she contracted the virus. Instead, she\\u2019ll go to a smaller family celebration where all adults will be vaccinated. Children too young for a vaccine will also attend; the presence of an unvaccinated adult could put them at risk.\", \"\\u201cMy relatives are more concerned of spreading it to me,\\u201d Ms. Natalie said. \\u201cI feel differently toward people who haven\\u2019t taken the steps to protect others. It shows a lot about their character.\\u201d\", \"Billie Jean Van Knight, 43, who has rheumatoid arthritis, doesn\\u2019t allow unvaccinated people in her home in St. Paul, Minn., and minimizes her trips outside. But now that she has her booster shot, she feels more freedom. She\\u2019ll spend the holiday at the home of her husband\\u2019s aunt and uncle, where everyone will have been vaccinated.\", \"\\u201cI wish people would just be kinder to each other and think about each other a little more,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not about your freedoms. It\\u2019s about other people\\u2019s as well.\\u201d\", \"If someone wants to start a Thanksgiving discussion about the importance of getting vaccinated, it\\u2019s important to remember that they won\\u2019t change someone\\u2019s mind during one conversation, said Melody Butler, 35, a nurse from Lindenhurst, N.Y., and the executive director of Nurses Who Vaccinate. People should be prepared to make themselves available to answer questions or continue talking.\", \"\\u201cWhat\\u2019s really important is to let them know that you want them to be vaccinated because you care,\\u201d she said. \\u201cYou want them to be around for next Thanksgiving.\\u201d\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
