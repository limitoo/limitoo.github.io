They're more accurate because they can make millions of copies of the virus' RNA, so even tiny amounts become detectable.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"5cc66bdc688411ec9bdab3d3ca00fdcb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5cc66bdc688411ec9bdab3d3ca00fdcb"}},
