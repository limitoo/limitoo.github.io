That's a given. But to be humiliated, as they were at the Basin Reserve last weekend, was awful.\", \"But you can cop that. Australia are a tremendous side. It's the other losses that really stick in the craw.\", \"Much of the coverage of the team has left a sour taste too.\", \"The White Ferns choked against the West Indies and yet we were treated to stories about a thrilling start to the tournament and New Zealand's admirable effort.\", \"Well, when the cameras panned to White Ferns coach Bob Carter and lip readers were treated to his summation of events, it didn't appear as if he admired that performance too much.\", \"Pre-tournament hopes were pretty high for this White Ferns team, particularly after their nine-wicket warm-up match win over Australia.\", \"I have to say that result made me think of the late cricket writer and broadcaster Peter Roebuck.\", \"The circumstances of Roebuck's death, and some of the allegations swirling around him, have meant he's not a man remembered too fondly.\", \"He knew cricket pretty well, though, and often talked and wrote about teams and players who rose to the small occasion.\", \"Yes, they might look a million bucks in matches of no consequence, but how do they go when it really counts?\", \"That's where we are with this White Ferns team.\", \"It's all very well to chase down over 300 to beat Australia in a warm-up game but, come the tournament proper, they've lost to the West Indies and South Africa from entirely winnable positions.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/288985/eight_col_Bates_PM.jpg?1647151400\\\" alt=\\\"Suzie Bates heads back to the dressing room in the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2022 against Australia in Wellington. \\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nSuzie Bates heads back to the dressing room in the ICC Women's Cricket World Cup 2022 against Australia in Wellington. \\nPhoto: PHOTOSPORT\\n</div>\", \"I've loved watching South Africa over the past couple of weeks. They've not played especially well, which is understandable without their injured captain and best player Dane van Niekerk.\", \"But, as they did against New Zealand, they've found a way to win.\", \"When things have looked desperate and they've appeared destined to lose, someone has risen to the big occasion.\", \"Invariably that's been outstanding allrounder Marizanne Kapp, but a host of others have chipped in as well.\", \"One of the other issues I have with the White Ferns team was that no player fronted to do media after the 141-run defeat to Australia, with assistant coach Jacob Oram sent out instead.\", \"Now, in absolute fairness, that's something we often see in men's test cricket. If a team's had a poor day, then an assistant will be offered up for a few words.\", \"It's just that, come the match's conclusion, the captain and perhaps another player and the head coach will all front.\", \"This might seem a petty point to make but it's important.\", \"If the White Ferns can't send out a player of consequence, or captain Sophie Devine, to pat back a few half-volleys from reporters, then how are they actually going to embrace the pressure of an important match?\", \"I've been in millions of those post-match pressers and the questions are almost always sympathetic ones. You know the person is upset, you know they'd rather be anywhere else but in front of the cameras and tape recorders, and you couch your inquiries appropriately.\", \"The White Ferns are still in this tournament, but they have to beat England on Sunday to retain the chance of qualification for the semifinals. That's well within their grasp from a talent perspective, but do they have the mental strength to win when it matters?\", \"Time will tell.\", \"Overall, though, this has been a tremendous event so far. We've seen some superb cricket, particularly from Australia, but individuals across all the teams have shone.\", \"I hope people are enjoying it. I hope that maybe some prejudices about the female game have been put to bed and that there's a recognition that we're watching some truly elite players.\", \"The fielding could be better, but then that adds a bit to the spectacle. The ball goes up, you think it's a regulation catch, but out it pops.\", \"The batting, though, and the quality of the ball-striking has been remarkable and then there's quick bowlers such as Kapp and the artistry of England spinner Sophie Ecclestone, among others.\", \"Some tournaments need the hosts to excel, but this one will remain a success whether the White Ferns are able to realise their undoubted potential or not.\"]","href_hash":"426ff114a6fe11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"426ff114a6fe11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
