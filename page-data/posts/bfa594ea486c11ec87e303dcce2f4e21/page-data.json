The movie is billed as a three-year collaboration among six abuse survivors, a professional drama therapist and the director and his crew. In an expansive \\u201cfilm by\\u201d credit, Greene gives the victims top billing.\", \"\\u201cProcession\\u201d follows the men as they help one another brainstorm and shoot five scripted scenes based on their experiences. Various elements of the production process (casting, costuming, finding locations the subjects haven\\u2019t visited since youth) become means for coping and reckoning. A sixth survivor, Tom Viviano, says he cannot tell his story because it\\u2019s still before the courts. His contribution is to act \\u2014 playing predator priests, in what must be agonizing feats of impersonation \\u2014 in two segments.\", \"\\u201cProcession\\u201d is exceptionally difficult to watch, as it should be. It\\u2019s also difficult to assess as art, given how it collapses lines between collaboration and co-option and between cinema and supportive treatment. To judge Greene\\u2019s experiment, not least because of its visible salutary effects, feels like intruding on private breakthroughs. But the discomfiting power of \\u201cProcession\\u201d comes from its ability to show and, to all appearances, facilitate them.\"]","href_hash":"bfa594ea486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bfa594ea486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}},
