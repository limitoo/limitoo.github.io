Stock options he was granted in 2012 are “a ticking tax time bomb,” one expert said.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-08T02:22:29.000Z","content":"[\"Elon Musk may have already been compelled to sell a sizable portion of his Tesla shares even if he hadn\\u2019t issued an unusual Twitter pledge over the weekend.\", \"Mr. Musk on Saturday polled Twitter users as to whether he should sell 10 percent of his stake in his company. The poll appeared to be a response to a Democratic proposal to tax the unrealized gains of billionaires. \\u201cMuch is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,\\u201d he tweeted. Mr. Musk said he was raising the question because he does not take a cash salary as Tesla\\u2019s chief executive, and therefore wouldn\\u2019t have any way to pay a large tax bill without selling some of his Tesla shares, which make up the vast majority of his wealth.\", \"Mr. Musk wrote in a follow-up tweet that he would \\u201cabide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes.\\u201d\", \"He closed the poll on Sunday, after nearly 3.5 million votes had been cast, with 58 percent voting for sell. Mr. Musk hasn\\u2019t confirmed what he will do, but after closing the poll, he tweeted, \\u201cI was prepared to accept either outcome.\\u201d\", \"Either way, Mr. Musk may soon have needed to sell a big chuck of his shares. He holds nearly 23 million stock options that were awarded in 2012. Those options have since vested and will expire in August. Most stock grants allow executives to avoid paying taxes for years, and perhaps forever, as long as they don\\u2019t sell the shares they get from converting the option.\", \"But Brian Foley, an executive compensation consultant, says because of the size of Mr. Musk\\u2019s grant and the way it was structured, it\\u2019s likely that much of his 2012 options don\\u2019t qualify for the preferential tax treatment. That means Mr. Musk would owe income taxes when he exercises the grant, which at current prices would be worth just under $30 billion. Mr. Musk\\u2019s tax bill could top $10 billion, depending on what percentage of the options don\\u2019t qualify for the preferential treatment.\", \"\\u201cThey are a ticking tax time bomb,\\u201d Mr. Foley said of Mr. Musk\\u2019s stock options. \\u201cOffhand I can\\u2019t think of any way for him to get around paying the tax.\\u201d\", \"What\\u2019s more, Mr. Musk may need to sell even more shares than what it would take to pay his tax bill. He owns 17 percent of Tesla\\u2019s shares, which at its current stock price would be worth about $200 billion. That means his weekend tweets are a pledge to sell roughly $20 billion worth of Tesla\\u2019s shares.\", \"The potential sale could roil Tesla\\u2019s stock at a time when many analysts say it is already overvalued. The company\\u2019s market value recently crossed $1 trillion, making it only one of five U.S. publicly traded companies to be worth that much.\", \"Nonetheless, James Cox, a professor at Duke University law school and an expert in securities laws, said it might be hard for Mr. Musk to go back on his Twitter pledge. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a no-win situation,\\u201d Mr. Cox said. \\u201cIn the securities law, the problem is this could be seen as a misrepresentation that was meant to mislead if another shareholder sold on Musk\\u2019s tweet.\\u201d\", \"But Mr. Cox said it would be a hard lawsuit to win, because chief executives are allowed to make statements and change their minds, as long as they meant what they said when they said it.\", \"It would not be the first time Mr. Musk has gotten into trouble over his tweets. In late 2018, he and Tesla settled a lawsuit by the Securities and Exchange Commission, without admitting guilt, for tweeting about a potential sale of Tesla that never happened. Mr. Musk was also sued for defamation in 2018 after calling a diver who had helped rescue children stuck in a cave in Thailand a \\u201cpedo guy\\u201d on Twitter. Mr. Musk won the suit.\", \"Daniel Ives, a stock analyst at Wedbush Securities who follows Tesla, called Mr. Musk\\u2019s latest Twitter pledge \\u201cbizarre,\\u201d but said he thought given Tesla\\u2019s prospects and the investor enthusiasm for the company that the stock, which is up 67 percent this year to a recent $1,222, would keep climbing, even with Mr. Musk cashing out a portion of his holdings.\", \"\\u201cMusk was likely to sell some of his Tesla stock before year end, but no one ever imagined there would be a Twitter poll translating into a 10 percent sale of his ownership,\\u201d Mr. Ives said. \\u201cThis weekend\\u2019s Twitter poll was a strange one even for Elon.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9ea7651e407d11eca1cfd1f07a37391c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9ea7651e407d11eca1cfd1f07a37391c"}},
