experienced earthquakes, wildfires and several severe weather events.\", \"Last July, when the Marlborough district was struck by severe rain and flooding, Eade said Omaka Marae was opened within half an hour of State Highway 1 closing, which had left 60 motorists stranded.\", \"\\\"It was warm, they had kai and accommodation ready for them, so marae play an essential part in an emergency response and that's why we've got the containers and the trained teams to be able to respond to these events and that's what we're trying to cover across to Te Tauihu.\\\"\", \"The journey began in 2019 when Te Puni K\\u014dkiri, Civil Defence and Marlborough Emergency Management started planning Emergency Operation Centre training for M\\u0101ori and iwi in Marlborough.\", \"<img

members participating in introductory workshops on the emergency operations centre became the first volunteers for the coronavirus welfare response.\", \"\\\"For all welfare inquiries if wh\\u0101nau identified they were M\\u0101ori, they were automatically transitioned to us and we'd provide the welfare packages, whether it was firewood or accommodation or kai.\\\"\", \"The Te Kotahi o Te Tauihu Trust was established in February 2021 and given the mandate to produce a consistent emergency response across the Te Tauihu rohe (Marlborough, Nelson, Tasman), resulting in the Te Tauihu Emergency Management Strategy.\", \"Eade said the containers were one part of the response - along with ongoing Coordination Incident Management System (CIMS) training.\", \"\\\"What we have found locally as iwi is that we're a bit more ahead of the game in terms of our relationship and our partnership with our emergency management teams on each side of the hill.\\\"\", \"The containers have different contents, based on the needs of the community they are placed in, but both contain generators, first aid supplies, hand sanitiser and other general items.\", \"\\\"So whenever there is a natural disaster, we have these containers with an emergency response team attached to them and so if something happens in Waikawa, they've got a team who can react and respond straight away and link in to the local controller for that incident management response team.\\\"\", \"The trust applied for National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) funding last year to help produce the eight ipu ohotata, or emergency containers, geographically spread across Te Tauihu.\", \"R\\u0101t\\u0101 Foundation supported the project by contributing 50 percent of the costs.\", \"<img
