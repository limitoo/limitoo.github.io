Vaccination cards and a recent negative Covid test were required for entry. The acting categories were stripped of gender binaries. And two sign-language interpreters were stationed to make sure that deaf and hard-of-hearing attendees could celebrate in real time.\", \"But the real meat of the show \\u2014 the schmoozing, the stargazing and the buzz-measuring \\u2014 felt utterly business as usual. And that may have been the night\\u2019s biggest win.\", \"The Gothams, presented by the Gotham Film & Media Institute, have always prided themselves on being the first significant awards show of the season: They fete winners before most groups have even announced their nominees. Last year, that meant the Gothams were the first to attempt a big awards show over Zoom, and like the telecasts that would follow, the ceremony was airless and full of baffled cues. Instead of delivering joyful acceptance speeches, most winners sat motionless in front of a webcam and wondered if it was their time to speak.\", \"This year, the Gothams returned to Cipriani Wall Street, and you\\u2019d have hardly known there was an interruption at all: While last year\\u2019s event was virtual and glitchy, this year\\u2019s was in-person and boozy. Before the show, several attendees remarked on how surreal the reunion felt, but once things got started, the only disrupters acknowledged from the stage were the usual coterie of producers, agents and streaming services.\", \"In 2019, at the last Gothams held in person, Netflix\\u2019s \\u201cMarriage Story\\u201d won so many awards that the director Noah Baumbach appeared sheepish at the end of the night; this year, it was the streamer\\u2019s maternal melodrama \\u201cThe Lost Daughter\\u201d that prevailed to such an extent that one of its stars, Dakota Johnson, called upon to present the best-feature award, remarked, \\u201cBet you guys are real sick of us, huh?\\u201d\", \"But \\u201cThe Lost Daughter\\u201d triumphed in that category, too, in addition to nabbing screenplay and director awards for actress-turned-auteur Maggie Gyllenhaal (adapting an Elena Ferrante work) and a lead-performance trophy for Olivia Colman, which she shared in a tie with Frankie Faison from \\u201cThe Killing of Kenneth Chamberlain.\\u201d\", \"The Gothams have somewhat restrictive eligibility rules: Films made internationally or for more than $35 million can\\u2019t be in the running for the top prizes. The ceremony regularly skirts those rules, however, by handing out special tributes to buzzy films or performances that would otherwise be nudged out of contention. That is how the \\u201cThe Power of the Dog\\u201d director Jane Campion and \\u201cSpencer\\u201d star Kristen Stewart found themselves picking up honorary trophies at the ceremony.\", \"That makes the show a tricky Oscar barometer, as do the five- or six-person juries that vote for each category. Chlo\\u00e9 Zhao\\u2019s \\u201cNomadland\\u201d ran the table at both the Oscars and the Gothams during last year\\u2019s smaller-scaled season, but this year, with star-driven studio films in the mix like \\u201cKing Richard,\\u201d \\u201cDune\\u201d and \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d the Gothams\\u2019 value as a precursor may be harder to predict.\", \"Still, it\\u2019s never bad to be seen winning. Other notable Gotham victors included the animated documentary \\u201cFlee,\\u201d international-film winner \\u201cDrive My Car,\\u201d and two notable breakthrough TV series, the Korean sensation \\u201cSquid Game\\u201d and the acclaimed FX series \\u201cReservation Dogs.\\u201d\", \"For \\u201cCODA,\\u201d a Sundance sensation that had a mild debut on Apple TV+ over the summer, the Gothams provided a valuable renaissance: This dramedy about a deaf family picked up a breakthrough-performer award for its lead, Emilia Jones, and a supporting trophy for Troy Kotsur.\", \"Was Kotsur speechless? Not quite.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m just absolutely handless right now,\\u201d he signed from the stage.\"]","href_hash":"b62f9b5251f611ec83ad15ebd8d2d533"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b62f9b5251f611ec83ad15ebd8d2d533"}},
