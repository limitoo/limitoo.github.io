part of the 4 per cent of NBN users who have a fixed wireless connection, meaning data is transmitted over radio signals.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"When it's cloudy, the internet's terrible.\\\"\", \"The business has 12 staff, who are often sent home when the internet drops out.\", \"Ms Allen said there had also been times where\\u00a0they would hotspot data off a phone or drive into town to the local

well as fixed wireless and satellite.\", \"Labor's original NBN plan was for more than 93 per cent of households to receive FTTP, with others connected via fixed wireless and satellite.\", \"Labor estimated its rollout would cost about $44 billion.\", \"The Coalition proposed a cheaper but ultimately slower NBN\\u00a0with a mix of technologies that would be completed earlier.\\u00a0\", \"The current Communications Minister Paul Fletcher declared the NBN rollout \\\"built and fully operational\\\" last year, at a cost of $51 billion.\", \"Associate Professor at RMIT Mark Gregory has been a

of a $3.5 billion program.\", \"Labor is seeking to make broadband an election issue, with a $2.4 billion promise to upgrade copper connections to fibre for 1.5 million premises who want faster speeds.\", \"When it comes to fixed wireless, NBN Co spends $200 million a year on improvements to that service and satellite services.\", \"There are also reports NBN Co is seeking a billion dollars
