Democrats control the offices of attorney general and secretary of state, as well as both chambers of the Legislature. Registered Democrats outnumber Republican voters more than 2-to-1 in Massachusetts.\", \"Three Democrats have already thrown their hat into the ring in the race for the governor's job: state Senator Sonia Chang-D\\u00edaz, former state Senator Benjamin Downing and Harvard professor Danielle Allen.\", \"Another possible contender is Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey. She hasn't launched a campaign but previously said she was seriously considering running.\", \"On the Republican side, the only candidate who has announced a gubernatorial run so far is former Massachusetts state Representative Geoff Diehl.\", \"Baker's decision not to seek reelection was shocking, Rhodes said, but even more of a blow to the state GOP was Polito deciding she wouldn't try to take his place.\", \"\\\"It's pretty surprising because there's not an obvious Republican with statewide prominence who could step up and fill those shoes at this time,\\\" the professor said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943332/baker-exiting-race-opens-door-democrats.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Massachusetts GOP Governor Charlie Baker has decided not to run for a third term, opening the door for Democrats to seize control of the state's top position.

In the latest UMass Amherst survey, his lowest level of support came from his own party: Just 41 percent of GOP voters approved of him, compared with 65 percent of Democrats.\", \"Baker cemented his position as a moderate Republican during his eight years in office. The governor was frequently at odds with former President Donald Trump, revealing he blanked his ballot for president in 2016 and 2020 in order to not back Trump.\", \"\\\"He represents a species of Republicanism that is pretty rare in our politics today,\\\" Rhodes said of the governor. \\\"That has been pretty critical to his success given how liberal the state is, and he has been able to survive and thrive because of that. So I think you would need to find someone who had a similar stature and a similar style of politics.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"4a139f5452cd11ec9cede12ea1232b67"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4a139f5452cd11ec9cede12ea1232b67"}},
