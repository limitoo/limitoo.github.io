Communist Party biographers have worshipfully chronicled his rise, though he has given no hint of retiring. The party\\u2019s newest official history devotes over a quarter of its 531 pages to his nine years in power.\", \"No Chinese leader in recent times has been more fixated than Mr. Xi on history and his place in it, and as he approaches a crucial juncture in his rule, that preoccupation with the past is now central to his political agenda. A high-level meeting opening in Beijing on Monday will issue a \\u201cresolution\\u201d officially reassessing the party\\u2019s 100-year history that is likely to cement his status as an epoch-making leader alongside Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping.\", \"While ostensibly about historical issues, the Central Committee\\u2019s resolution \\u2014 practically holy writ for officials \\u2014 will shape China\\u2019s politics and society for decades to come.\", \"The touchstone document on the party\\u2019s past, only the third of its kind, is sure to become the focus of an intense indoctrination campaign. It will dictate how the authorities teach China\\u2019s modern history in textbooks, films, television shows and classrooms. It will embolden censors and police officers applying sharpened laws against any who mock, or even question, the communist cause and its \\u201cmartyrs.\\u201d Even in China, where the party\\u2019s power is all but absolute, it will remind officials and citizens that Mr. Xi is defining their times, and demanding their loyalty.\", \"\\u201cThis is about creating a new timescape for China around the Communist Party and Xi in which he is riding the wave of the past towards the future,\\u201d said Geremie R. Barm\\u00e9, a historian of China based in New Zealand. \\u201cIt is not really a resolution about past history, but a resolution about future leadership.\\u201d\", \"By exalting Mr. Xi, the decision will fortify his authority before a party congress late next year, at which he is very likely to win another five-year term as leader. The orchestrated acclaim around the history document, which could be published days after the Central Committee meeting ends on Thursday, will help deter any questioning of Mr. Xi\\u2019s record.\", \"Mr. Xi, 68, is China\\u2019s most powerful leader in decades, and he has won widespread public support for attacking corruption, reducing poverty and projecting Chinese strength to the world. Still, party insiders seeking to blunt Mr. Xi\\u2019s dominance before the congress could take aim at the early mishandling of the Covid pandemic or damaging tensions with the United States.\", \"Especially after the resolution, such criticisms may amount to heresy. In the buildup to this week\\u2019s meeting, articles in People\\u2019s Daily, the party\\u2019s main newspaper, have praised Mr. Xi as the \\u201ccore\\u201d leader defeating the pandemic and other crises. Commentaries have exalted him as the unyielding leader needed for such perilous times, when China\\u2019s ascent could be threatened by domestic economic risks or hostility from the United States and other Western powers.\", \"\\u201cXi Jinping is undoubtedly the core figure mastering the tide of history,\\u201d read an article from Xinhua, the official news agency, about the forthcoming resolution.\", \"The resolution is likely to offer a sweeping account of modern China that will help to justify Mr. Xi\\u2019s policies by giving them the gravitas of historical destiny.\", \"Mao led the country to stand up against oppression, Deng brought prosperity, and now Mr. Xi is propelling the nation into a new era of national strength, says the stage-by-stage description of modern China\\u2019s rise that is laid out in party documents and is likely to be enshrined in the resolution.\", \"In the coming years, Mr. Xi\\u2019s priorities are focused on reducing wealth inequalities through a program of \\u201ccommon prosperity,\\u201d lessening China\\u2019s reliance on imported technology, and continuing to modernize its military to prepare for potential conflict.\", \"Mr. Xi\\u2019s conception of history offers \\u201can ideological framework which justifies greater and greater levels of party intervention in politics, the economy and foreign policy,\\u201d said Kevin Rudd, a former Australian prime minister who speaks Chinese and has had long meetings with Mr. Xi.\", \"For Mr. Xi, defending the Chinese Communist Party\\u2019s revolutionary heritage also appears to be a personal quest. He has repeatedly voiced fears that as China becomes increasingly distant from its revolutionary roots, officials and citizens are at growing risk of losing faith in the party.\", \"\\u201cTo destroy a country, you must first eradicate its history,\\u201d Mr. Xi has said, quoting a Confucian scholar from the 19th century.\", \"Mr. Xi\\u2019s father, Xi Zhongxun, served as a senior official under Mao and Deng, and the family suffered years of persecution after Mao turned against the elder Mr. Xi. Instead of becoming disillusioned with the revolution like quite a few contemporaries, the younger Mr. Xi remained loyal to the party and has argued that defending its \\u201cred\\u201d heritage is essential for its survival.\", \"\\u201cHe has this visceral notion that as the son of a revolutionary, Xi Zhongxun, that he cannot allow the revolution simply to drift away,\\u201d said Mr. Rudd, now president of the Asia Society.\", \"Mr. Xi has also often cited the Soviet Union as a warning for China, arguing that it collapsed in part because its leaders failed to eradicate \\u201chistorical nihilism\\u201d \\u2014 critical accounts of purges, political persecution and missteps that corroded faith in the communist cause.\", \"The new resolution will reflect that defensive pride in the party. While the titles of the two previous history resolutions said they were about \\u201cproblems\\u201d or \\u201cissues,\\u201d Mr. Xi\\u2019s will be about the party\\u2019s \\u201cmajor achievements and historical experiences,\\u201d according to a preparatory meeting last month.\", \"The resolution will present the party\\u2019s 100-year history as a story of heroic sacrifice and success, a drumroll of preliminary articles in party media indicates. Traumatic times like famine and purges will fall further into a soft-focus background \\u2014 acknowledged but not elaborated.\", \"Mr. Xi \\u201csees history as a tool to use against the biggest threats to Chinese Communist Party rule,\\u201d said Joseph Torigian, an assistant professor at American University who has studied Mr. Xi and his father. \\u201cHe\\u2019s also someone who sees that competing narratives of history are dangerous.\\u201d\", \"Plenty of Chinese people embrace the party\\u2019s proud version of its past and credit it with improving their lives. In 2019, there were 1.4 billion visits to revolutionary \\u201cred\\u201d tour museums and memorials, and Mr. Xi makes a point of going to such places during his travels. A village where Mr. Xi labored for seven years has become a site for organized political pilgrimages.\", \"\\u201cInstruction in revolutionary traditions must start with toddlers,\\u201d Mr. Xi said in 2016, according to a recently released compendium of his comments on the theme. \\u201cInfuse red genes into the bloodstream and immerse our hearts in them.\\u201d\", \"In creating a history resolution, Mr. Xi is emulating his two most powerful and officially revered predecessors. Mao oversaw a resolution in 1945 that stamped his authority on the party. Deng oversaw one in 1981 that acknowledged the destruction of Mao\\u2019s later decades while defending his revered status as the founder of the People\\u2019s Republic. And both resolutions put a cap on political strife and uncertainty.\", \"\\u201cThey were creating a common framework, a common vision, of past and future among the party elite,\\u201d said Daniel Leese, a historian at the University of Freiburg in Germany who studies modern China. \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t unify the thinking of people in the circles of power about the past, it\\u2019s very difficult to be on the same page about the future.\\u201d\", \"Throughout this year, Chinese officials have already been undergoing an indoctrination program in Mr. Xi\\u2019s views about history. And the main texts in the campaign appear to be a preview of the forthcoming decision, especially the new 531-page \\u201cbrief\\u201d history of the party.\", \"That history celebrates at length Mr. Xi\\u2019s successes in reducing corruption, cutting poverty and advancing China\\u2019s technological capabilities. His response to the Covid pandemic, which began in China in late 2019, showed \\u201cacute insight and resolute decision-making,\\u201d it says.\", \"The new resolution is likely to praise both Mao and Deng while indicating that only Mr. Xi has the answers for China\\u2019s new era of rising power, said Susanne Weigelin-Schwiedrzik, a retired professor at the University of Vienna who studies the party\\u2019s use of history.\", \"\\u201cHe is like a sponge that can take all the positive things from the past \\u2014 what he thinks is positive about Mao and Deng \\u2014 and he can bring them all together,\\u201d she said of the party\\u2019s depiction of Mr. Xi. In that telling, she said, \\u201che is China\\u2019s own end of history. He has reached a level that cannot be surpassed.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f014caf23fb211ec8e4b8d631d452a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f014caf23fb211ec8e4b8d631d452a2b"}},
