She has pleaded not guilty.\", \"Before Theranos collapsed, it was a Silicon Valley darling that promised to revolutionize health care through cheaper, simpler blood tests that took only a few drops of blood. Ms. Holmes raised nearly $1 billion from investors and was heralded as the next Steve Jobs. But a 2015 investigation from The Wall Street Journal revealed that Theranos\\u2019s blood-testing technology did not work, and the start-up unraveled.\", \"In the first 11 weeks of Ms. Holmes\\u2019s trial, prosecutors called 29 witnesses. They testified that Ms. Holmes and Theranos had falsified reports, concealed the use of third-party blood testing devices, faked technology demonstrations and exaggerated the company\\u2019s marketing claims.\", \"To rebut those arguments, Ms. Holmes, 37, took the stand on Nov. 19. In her first few days of testimony, she blamed others, said she was a true believer of Theranos\\u2019s technology and posited that her decisions were misunderstood. Kevin Downey, Ms. Holmes\\u2019s lawyer, has painted his client as a well-meaning entrepreneur whose actions to protect her company were twisted by prosecutors as fraud.\", \"Here\\u2019s what has happened in Ms. Holmes\\u2019s testimony:\", \"A key moment in the trial happened on the third day of Ms. Holmes\\u2019s testimony, when she said that she had personally added pharmaceutical company logos to Theranos reports, which were then used to persuade investors and partners to work with her start-up.\", \"Prosecutors have held up the reports as evidence that Ms. Holmes lied about Theranos\\u2019s prospects. The reports bore the logos of the drug makers Pfizer and Schering-Plough, even though neither company had a hand in preparing or approving the reports and both recommended against using Theranos\\u2019s technology.\", \"In her testimony, Ms. Holmes said she added the drug makers\\u2019 logos to the reports \\u201cbecause this work was done in partnership with those companies and I was trying to convey that.\\u201d She argued that she had not intended to deceive anyone and would have done things differently if she had known that investors and partners would view the logos as endorsements by the drug makers.\", \"Ms. Holmes has spent much of her testimony arguing that others at Theranos were responsible for the company\\u2019s shortcomings.\", \"She said that Adam Rosendorff, Theranos\\u2019s lab director, was responsible for the clinical lab, and that a vice president, Daniel Young, was in charge of a partnership with the pharmacy chain Walgreens. She also highlighted the experience of her star-studded board of directors, implying that they should have given her better counsel.\", \"Ms. Holmes\\u2019s understanding of Theranos\\u2019s technology was that \\u201cit performed well,\\u201d she said.\", \"When Mr. Downey brought up a study done by scientists at Johns Hopkins University that concluded that Theranos\\u2019s technology was \\u201cnovel and sound,\\u201d Ms. Holmes said, \\u201cOur team was really excited about this. This was some of the best laboratory experts in the world.\\u201d\", \"To convict Ms. Holmes, the prosecution needs to prove that she intended to commit fraud. On the stand, Ms. Holmes has consistently said that she did not intend to deceive anyone.\", \"She said that she concealed Theranos\\u2019s use of third-party devices \\u2014 one of the prosecution\\u2019s major allegations against her \\u2014 because she was worried others would copy modifications that Theranos had made to those devices. She also said her intent was not to hide that Theranos\\u2019s own machines could not do as many tests as she claimed.\", \"\\u201cThis was an invention that we understood from our counsel we had to protect as a trade secret,\\u201d Ms. Holmes said.\", \"She added that Theranos\\u2019s marketing claims were aimed at establishing the start-up\\u2019s brand separate from that of its bigger partners. Ms. Holmes said she made those claims on the advice of the prominent advertising agency TBWA\\\\Chiat\\\\Day and did not approve any materials she thought were inaccurate.\", \"On Monday, Ms. Holmes said she had \\u201cabsolutely not\\u201d told Theranos\\u2019s lab personnel to hide anything about the start-up during a 2013 inspection by regulators.\"]","href_hash":"35f8d81e515a11ec8acd2f3ef0ab59c3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"35f8d81e515a11ec8acd2f3ef0ab59c3"}},
