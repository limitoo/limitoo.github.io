There are countless examples \\u2014 conservatives who finally embrace L.G.B.T.Q. rights when their child or neighbor comes out, or see addiction as a problem when it shows up in their family, and so on.\", \"Good work, Ross, but please keep moving!\", \"Steven CarlsonEaston, Conn.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"I find shocking Ross Douthat\\u2019s conclusion that \\u201cwhatever everyday health insurance coverage is worth to the sick person, a cure for a heretofore-incurable disease is worth more.\\u201d Really? For millions of people, do family security, reduced depression and financial stress, and increased use of health services \\u2014 all findings from the Oregon Medicaid study that Mr. Douthat cites \\u2014 count so little?\", \"Mr. Douthat\\u2019s policy prescriptions are skewed by his personal experience. If his experience had been the anxiety of delayed health care or threatened bankruptcy, that would skew his lens differently.\", \"Moreover, there are many disincentives to innovation that have little to do with universal coverage. The medical establishment is by its nature conservative and unwelcoming to pathfinders; many solutions are not profitable because they\\u2019re cheap or the numbers affected are small; and huge resources are wasted on drug advertising and insurance bureaucracies that are rarely patient-friendly.\", \"A cure for some versus health coverage for all? These are choices we need not make. We can do better.\", \"Lois SalisburySausalito, Calif.The writer is founding chair of Health Access California.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Ross Douthat\\u2019s experience with chronic Lyme disease misguides him to faulty conclusions about health care in America. Chronic Lyme disease is real, but there are no proven treatments. Mr. Douthat received an unorthodox alternative treatment. Does he think that medical insurance should pay for such treatment? I hope not, since there are alternative, unproven treatments for almost every disease. Many are dangerous \\u2014 even deadly.\", \"Moreover, symptoms of chronic Lyme disease are known to get less severe over time and may often disappear altogether. Thus, the \\u201ctreatment\\u201d may have done nothing. A placebo. The tincture of time may have done the same thing.\", \"Mr. Douthat needs to reconsider his thoughts about what\\u2019s wrong with health care in America.\", \"David J.

When the SAT goes completely digital, it will be even less fair to disadvantaged students, who may not have the online access necessary to practice repeatedly for the test.\", \"In contrast, working with paper and pencil is more accessible for low-income students, as well as a skill most are familiar with anyway because of state standardized testing in public schools.\", \"A reader does not need excellent reading comprehension to deduce the main idea of the College Board\\u2019s announcement: An official plainly alludes to the board\\u2019s struggle to remain relevant and says many colleges and universities are making test scores optional, so she wants \\u201cthe SAT to be the best possible option for students.\\u201d\", \"The College Board\\u2019s goal is to perpetuate its hegemony in the testing industry, and it will never be a leader in promoting equity, inclusion or transparency.\", \"Donna GitterNew YorkThe writer is a professor of law at Baruch College\\u2019s Zicklin School of Business, City University of New York.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Here is a scenario that the general public should consider: Two 65-year-old women come to the hospital emergency department needing treatment in the I.C.U.
