So there was little reason to expect any imminent new music from Swift, who had long stuck to a regimen of one studio album every few years.\", \"But 2020 and 2021 have seen a remarkable flurry of recording activity from Swift, and record-breaking chart success. Last year came two quarantine albums, \\u201cFolklore\\u201d and \\u201cEvermore,\\u201d and this year she has been focused on her rerecordings \\u2014 meticulous re-creations of her earlier work, casting the act as empowering business move, retribution against the investors that now control some of her original recordings, and an opportunity to revisit youthful themes with a more mature eye.\", \"\\u201cFearless (Taylor\\u2019s Version)\\u201d came in April, and now \\u201cRed (Taylor\\u2019s Version)\\u201d has become Swift\\u2019s fourth No. 1 album in 16 months, which Billboard says is the fastest run in the 65-year history of its album chart. Since \\u201cFolklore\\u201d came out in July 2020, Swift has held the No. 1 spot on Billboard\\u2019s album chart a total of 15 times.\", \"\\u201cRed (Taylor\\u2019s Version)\\u201d had the equivalent of 605,000 sales in the United States in its first week, according to MRC Data, Billboard\\u2019s tracking arm. That total includes 303 million streams and 369,000 copies sold as a complete package. It sold 114,000 copies on vinyl LP \\u2014 which Swift released as a $50 set of four discs at 45 r.p.m. \\u2014 which is the most that any album has sold on vinyl since at least 1991, when SoundScan, MRC\\u2019s predecessor, began reporting reliable data on record sales.\", \"Among the highlights of the new \\u201cRed\\u201d is a 10-minute version of her song \\u201cAll Too Well,\\u201d with added lyrics that give more depth to the story of a failed romance. Swift made a short film of this long version, performed it on \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d and released two additional recordings of it last week.\", \"The new \\u201cAll Too Well\\u201d also becomes Swift\\u2019s eighth No. 1 on Billboard\\u2019s Hot 100 singles chart, with multiple new recordings of the song \\u2014 but not its 2012 original \\u2014 counting toward its total of 54 million streams, in addition to downloads and radio plays.\", \"Swift now has 10 LPs that have gone to No. 1, tying her with Elvis Presley, Eminem, Drake and Kanye West. The Beatles still rule that list with 19 chart-topping titles, followed by Jay-Z with 14 and Bruce Springsteen and Barbra Streisand with 11 each.\", \"The 605,000 sales of Swift\\u2019s new \\u201cRed\\u201d is the second-biggest opening for any album this year, after 613,000 for Drake\\u2019s \\u201cCertified Lover Boy\\u201d in September. But both are expected to be dwarfed by the arrival of Adele\\u2019s \\u201c30\\u201d on next week\\u2019s chart, a ready-made blockbuster that may reach or even exceed one million sales in its opening week, something that no album has done since Swift\\u2019s \\u201cReputation\\u201d four years ago.\", \"Little official data has been released about the initial success of \\u201c30,\\u201d which came out on Friday. But as a sign of Adele\\u2019s clout in the music industry, she announced over the weekend that, apparently at the singer\\u2019s request, Spotify had removed \\u201cshuffle\\u201d as the default playback mode for albums, making it easier for fans to hear an album from beginning to end, as the artist intended.\", \"\\u201cThank you Spotify for listening,\\u201d Adele tweeted on Saturday, and the service responded: \\u201cAnything for you.\\u201d\", \"Also on this week\\u2019s chart, Silk Sonic, the retro-soul project of Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak, opens at No. 2 with \\u201cAn Evening With Silk Sonic,\\u201d which had the equivalent of 104,000 sales, and the K-pop girl group Twice is at No. 3 with its new \\u201cFormula of Love: O+T=<3.\\u201d Summer Walker\\u2019s \\u201cStill Over It,\\u201d last week\\u2019s top album, falls to No. 4, and \\u201cCertified Lover Boy\\u201d is in fifth place.\"]","href_hash":"83012fcd4bcd11eca55941420da12e23"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"83012fcd4bcd11eca55941420da12e23"}},
