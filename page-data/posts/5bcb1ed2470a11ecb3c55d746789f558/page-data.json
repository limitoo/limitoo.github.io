Instead her emotions are so tightly in check that even a photograph of her laughing can be front page news.\", \"Yet at 95 years old, bearing the grief of her husband's death,\\u00a0family scandal and\\u00a0the pressure of a pandemic, the Queen has continued to work: calm, composed, consistent.\", \"That was until October 19 \\u2014 the last day the Queen was seen in person\\u00a0publicly. If it was any other nonagenarian a little time out may not seem unusual. But the Queen?\", \"Buckingham Palace explained her absence by revealing the monarch had a short stint in hospital for tests but the stay was quickly brushed off as insignificant. A decision to skip the COP26 was accepted.\", \"Then, plans to attend this week's Remembrance Day service were cancelled at the last minute. Of all her public events, Remembrance Day remains one of the most important. As head of the British Armed Forces the event has symbolic significance.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/70b0e43e170aa0d4eb538f24e37a332b\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Queen Elizabeth has only missed the Remembrance Sunday ceremony at the Cenotaph in London six times.\\u00a0(AP Photo: Alastair Grant)</div>\", \"It also holds personal meaning: the Queen is the only living head of state to have served in uniform during WWII. Buckingham Palace was bombed during the Blitz and prompted a key moment\\u00a0in her father's reign when he walked through the devastated streets of London after the bombings. It is no wonder that over her long reign she has missed attending the Cenotaph on November 11 only six times.\", \"It's raised questions royal watchers don't want to contemplate: Will the Queen continue as the monarch? Could she step further away from public life, or even abdicate?\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Who is next in line to the throne?</div>\", \"The Queen holds an inherited title that is passed down according to a strict convention. Next in line for the British throne is, of course, Prince Charles, the Queen's eldest child. This path of succession is set in stone and governed by the Bill of Rights 1689, Act of Settlement 1701 and Acts of Union 1707 and can only be changed by an Act of Parliament.\", \"There is occasional speculation that the monarchy may skip over Prince Charles \\u2013 who is now 72 \\u2013 and be passed directly to Prince William who is generally widely liked by British citizens. But there is no indication that the royal family is considering this as a serious option and indeed it would be unprecedented.\", \"Giselle Bastin, a literature professor and expert in the royals, likens the swirling questions around succession to a Shakespeare play. But she believes it's very unlikely Charles will be bypassed. \\\"He is the successor and he has been groomed his whole life for this job. Why would he suddenly step aside and so 'now I don't actually want to be the face on the stamp\\\".\\\"\", \"Nevertheless, she says, just like one of Shakespeare's plays the Windsors\\u00a0are in the process of reorganising themselves in the face of an aged monarch.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"People are very interested in the jostling for power and what the rules of succession are,\\\" she says.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2247aeec5488245aa04e5f7b146bed04\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Queen Elizabeth, with her husband Prince Phillip, is unlikely to abdicate.</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Would she abdicate?</div>\", \"The Queen has on many occasions publicly outlined a belief that her job is for life. Abdication does not appear to be a serious option.\", \"In one of her earliest public speeches to mark her 21st birthday in 1947 the Queen, then Princess Elizabeth and first in line to inherit the throne from her father King George VI, declared \\\"my whole life, whether it be long or short, shall be devoted to your service\\\".\", \"On her Coronation Day six years later, she reiterated the sentiment: \\\"I have in sincerity pledged myself to your service, as so many of you are pledged to mine. Throughout all my life and with all my heart I shall strive to be worthy of your trust\\\".\", \"Privately, the Queen is said to have told her cousin, Margaret Rhodes, that she would never abdicate \\\"unless I get Alzheimer's or have a stroke\\\" and the former Archbishop of Canterbury George Cary \\\"I'm going to carry on to the end\\\".\", \"As well as her belief that the job requires unwavering service, the Coronation service for a British monarch includes consecration with holy oil that is symbolic of being anointed to the role by God. This aspect of the Coronation ceremony implies the new monarch has been transformed into the divine.\", \"As a religious person raised to embrace her royal duty, it's understood that the Queen takes this symbolism\\u00a0very seriously.\", \"Another reason why abdication is unlikely to be on the cards is that in February next year the Queen marks her Platinum Jubilee, celebrating 70 years on the throne. She is already the longest-serving British monarch, passing Queen Victoria who served for 63 years from 1837 and George III who served for 59 years from 1760. With the celebration deep in the planning stage it doesn't seem likely she would willingly give up the throne now.\\u00a0\", \"The Queen is also, no doubt, mindful of the trauma that her father \\u2013 a shy man with a stutter \\u2014 faced when he was unexpectedly elevated to King following\\u00a0his brother Edward's abdication in 1936 after less than a year on the throne.\", \"\\\"It was a catastrophe,\\\" Bastin says of Edward VIII's abdication. \\\"There is a natural order there and refusing it was a catastrophe for the royal family. They could not believe that (someone) could renounce what was meant to be yours, ordained almost by God.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How was it possible for Edward VIII to abdicate?</div>\", \"Edward VIII \\u2013 the Queen's uncle \\u2013 abdicated to marry his American fiance Wallis\\u00a0Simpson.\", \"This union was not allowed at the time because Simpson\\u00a0was divorced. Divorcees could not be married in the Anglican church and given the British monarch is also head of the church it raised all kinds of ethical conflicts for\\u00a0the time. But times have changed. Prince Charles is divorced and now married to Camilla, also a divorcee.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c448b0b2d08a88a206da61a4b0c405f7\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Prince Edward VIII, pictured here\\u00a0in 1971, abdicated in 1936 so he could marry Wallis Simpson.(Supplied)</div>\", \"Also worth noting is that Edward VIII's abdication was far from straightforward. It caused an uproar in Britain and was only made possible by an Act of Parliament known as His Majesty's Declaration of Abdication Act 1936.\", \"Prior to this, James VII of England (aka James II of Ireland) was the last monarch to be removed from power \\u2013 in 1688 \\u2013 when he fled into exile.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What alternatives to abdication exist?</div>\", \"It is possible for the Queen to increasingly step back from public life while remaining on the throne and this is the most likely path if her age or health impacts the amount of work she can do.\", \"She is already taking this route. Swapping face-to-face addresses for Zoom, as she ultimately did for\\u00a0COP26, may signal the way things will\\u00a0increasingly be done going forward, particularly as attending large gatherings raises the risk of contracting COVID-19.\", \"In 2016 at age 90, the Queen began passing some of her patronages to other family members as a way of lightening her workload and this is also likely to increase.\", \"Prince William and Prince Charles have taken\\u00a0on a lot of these royal duties, as has Prince Edward's wife Sophie Wessex and of course Kate Middleton.\", \"But with the loss of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle to the US, and Prince Andrew to accusations of sexual abuse and a bitter court case, the royal family may have to think more widely about how these duties are shared.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7876dd9ebcebdfe55cb2818b9c137abb\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Prince Charles attended the G20 Summit in October.

This is most likely the \\\"light work\\\" referred to in Palace updates about what she's doing while out of the public eye.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What if the Queen becomes unable to do 'light work'?</div>\", \"Royal history is littered with tales of mad kings using their unbridled power to wreak havoc and no one with the authority to contain them.\", \"So, what happens if the Queen becomes too frail to effectively do her job?\", \"Well, there is a solution to that, too.\", \"Rather than abdication, the British royal family is more likely to use the system of appointing a regent. In this case, Prince Charles would step into the role of Prince Regent to carry out all the Queen's essential duties until the time she passed away and he formally succeeds her as monarch.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ddb7b763d6b8371d5b605d173293703d\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The Queen has been working remotely more often.</div>\", \"The Regency Acts 1937 and 1953 guide how this process takes place. One of three people can make a \\\"declaration of incapacity\\\" triggering the regency period.\", \"A regent was appointed in the case of \\\"mad\\\" King George III who passed away in 1820. With insights from modern medicine it is speculated that rather than being mad he may have suffered from mental illness or his symptoms may have been caused by medications used at the time.\", \"There's no indication, however, that regency is now\\u00a0being considered for the Queen.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What do other royal families do?</div>\", \"The British royal family is unusual in its tradition of keeping monarchs on the throne until death.\", \"There is a very long list of monarchs from other nations who have chosen to abdicate.\", \"Some recent high-profile examples include Japan's Emporer Akihito who abdicated in 2019, Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands who abdicated in 2013\\u00a0and\\u00a0Cambodia's\\u00a0King Norodom Sihanouk who abdicated in 2004.\"]","href_hash":"5bcb1ed2470a11ecb3c55d746789f558"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5bcb1ed2470a11ecb3c55d746789f558"}},
