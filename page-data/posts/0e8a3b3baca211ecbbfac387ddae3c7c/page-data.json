And it hasn't just been me, as people are constantly complaining about dogs on the local Facebook pages.\\\"\", \"Hearn has also found it difficult to get Auckland Council's animal management services to respond quickly to reports of stray or threatening canines in the area.\", \"\\\"The issue I've had with the council is that they've asked me to contain the dog on my property - but I'm not going to go out and catch them all,\\\" she says.\", \"\\\"They've also said to me that they aren't fining or pursuing people because of Covid - I can understand that, but we have regulations in place for a reason, for the safety of kids, and so our streets and parks can be for everyone.\\\"\", \"Concern over the issue has led Hearn to start a petition, calling on Auckland Council to take immediate action before someone is seriously injured.\", \"The petition has reached almost 500 signatures and last week she presented it to the \\u014ctara-Papatoetoe Local Board.\", \"\\u014ctara-Papatoetoe Local Board chair Apulu Reece Autagavaia has welcomed Hearn's presentation and his board will be looking at how it can support any proactive measures like education for dog owners.\", \"\\\"Firstly, given it's a regulatory issue, there's nothing we can do directly, but it is an issue we have raised many times.\", \"\\\"And I think this is an issue a lot of local boards have been raising, and not just around dogs, but also around noise management and consenting.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/140674/eight_col_dogs2.jpg?1648165477\\\" alt=\\\"\\u014ctara-Papatoetoe Local Board chair Apulu Reece Autagavaia - single use only \\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nApulu Reece Autagavaia says his board has raised the stray dogs issue several times.  \\nPhoto: LDR / Supplied / Auckland Council\\n</div>\", \"Autagavaia said council staff have told his board that budget cuts along with high staff turnover have made it increasingly difficult to enforce council bylaws.\", \"\\\"There definitely seems to be a feeling across Auckland for many local boards that we're making all these bylaws but there's no enforcement.\", \"\\\"So while the governing body is trying to cut as much fat as possible out of the budget, we don't think enforcement is an area where there is fat and we should be adding resources, not cutting.\\\"\", \"In a written response to queries, Elly Waitoa, council's manager of animal management, said: \\\"We're seeing the impact of the Omicron outbreak on staffing levels in the council's animal management team, meaning we currently need to prioritise incidents with potential for higher risk and harm, like dog aggression and attacks and stock on roads, over lower risk incidents like unregistered or roaming dogs.\", \"\\\"Whilst we are not actively attending lower risk incidents at present due to staffing levels, owners may still receive an infringement for failing to comply with their obligations under the Dog Control Act 1996.\\\"\", \"But change could be on the horizon, if Auckland's mayoral candidates are to be believed. Of the four contenders The Spinoff spoke to, all were in favour of improving resourcing to council's regulatory and compliance services.\", \"Restaurateur and centre-right candidate Leo Molloy said enforcement of bylaws is a \\\"core council business\\\" and \\\"if they [council] neglect those services, they are simply not doing the role they should be doing\\\".\", \"\\\"There appears to be an element within the council structure at the moment who have more appetite for vanity projects and projects that don't have a good sound fiscal basis,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"But when it comes to dog control, graffiti removal and providing good quality services, I'm a fan of that.
