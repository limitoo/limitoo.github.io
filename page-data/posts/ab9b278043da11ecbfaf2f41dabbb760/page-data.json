He is unproven, unseasoned and unfinished. He could use a few more lines on his r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 and possibly a couple of more pounds on his lanky frame.\", \"But because it has become equally evident in the early days of his career that Pepi possesses in abundant quantity the intangible, invaluable and often ephemeral magic needed to do the one thing valued above all else in soccer \\u2014 because, in other words, he scores goals \\u2014 none of the aforementioned stuff particularly matters.\", \"Pepi, 18, may or may not become the striker of the future for the United States men\\u2019s soccer team. Many have tried to make the position \\u2014 the No. 9, in soccer parlance \\u2014 their own, and most have failed. But questions about Pepi\\u2019s long-term viability, his ceiling as a player, can wait. At the moment, there is a World Cup to qualify for.\", \"And there is no question that Pepi is the American striker of right now.\", \"\\u201cPressure is nothing to him \\u2014 I think he relishes it, more so than his age should allow,\\u201d said Eric Quill, who coached Pepi at North Texas S.C. in 2019 and 2020. \\u201cNo. 9s, when they\\u2019re in great form, it\\u2019s like, \\u2018Look out.\\u2019 And I think he\\u2019s as confident as they come right now.\\u201d\", \"Ready or not, Pepi is being asked to carry a heavy responsibility on his teenage shoulders. After making his debut with the United States senior national team just two months ago, he was the only pure striker that Gregg Berhalter, the team\\u2019s coach, summoned for the team\\u2019s two World Cup qualifiers this month. The first of these is a marquee match on Friday night against Mexico in Cincinnati.\", \"The show of faith, if risky, made sense: Pepi, who plays professionally for F.C. Dallas in Major League Soccer, has collected three goals and two assists in his first four appearances with the United States. He has also been one of the most consistent bright spots in the team\\u2019s somewhat shaky start to the qualifying tournament.\", \"Pepi is the youngest player on a notably young team. (\\u201cLose Yourself\\u201d by Eminem was the top song in the country when he was born in January 2003, and Tom Brady had only one Super Bowl ring back then.) The youth of the American squad has been at once a point of pride (when things go well) and an excuse (when things don\\u2019t go as well). But the team\\u2019s disastrous failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup has helped coaches justify turning over a new leaf \\u2014 track records be damned.\", \"Pepi embodies that desire to start fresh more than anyone. He is all potential, a blank slate personified.\", \"Yet his emergence could not be more timely. In recent years, the United States\\u2019 program has seen promising players sprout up all over the field. (American attacking midfielders, for instance, seem to be multiplying like jack rabbits). But the center forward position has long been something of a barren patch.\", \"Brian McBride, who played from 1993 to 2006, remains the gold standard for American strikers, according to Herculez Gomez, a former national team striker. Jozy Altidore came closest to filling McBride\\u2019s shoes, Gomez said. Countless others have been hyped, but few have followed through.\", \"\\u201cWe could start spouting off a lot names,\\u201d Gomez, now an analyst for ESPN, said about the revolving door of strikers. \\u201cA lot of players have been put in the role, but not a lot of guys have taken the reins.\\u201d\", \"He added with a laugh: \\u201cI was one of them.\\u201d\", \"Gomez said Pepi was raw, but undoubtedly promising, showing a sharp trajectory of improvement in the last year alone.\", \"\\u201cI think his mentality is the strongest trait he has,\\u201d Gomez said. \\u201cHe\\u2019s just so hungry. He\\u2019s got this arrogance about him. Borderline cocky. A swagger to him.\\u201d\", \"That may be the case in the penalty area, but in most other circumstances Pepi is known as an introvert. In conversations with the news media, for example, he has a tendency to meander cautiously through the early beats of a response before settling on phrasing he has used before. (The problem with playing well, for some athletes, is that people want to speak with you.)\", \"This type of shyness might be concerning for a coach, were it not so easily, and so ferociously, shed on the field.\", \"\\u201cIn the dressing room he was always kind of in the corner by himself,\\u201d said Francisco Molina, the former scouting director for F.C. Dallas, who met Pepi when he was playing in the team\\u2019s youth system. \\u201cOn the field, he was a loud, screaming, rebellious kid.\\u201d\", \"The first thing Molina noticed about Pepi was his spindly frame. (\\u201cLike a baby deer, he said.\\u201d) The second was his steady stream of goals: He could score them with his right foot or his left, with his head, with his knees and shoulders and shins. He can find almost any way to nudge the ball into the net.\", \"\\u201cHe has that instinct,\\u201d Molina said. \\u201cHe\\u2019s a pure 9.\\u201d\", \"These skills have drawn interest from the top clubs in Europe. Among those tracking Pepi\\u2019s development, there seems to be agreement that his next step should be a careful, conscientious one \\u2014 a spot on a good team in a medium-profile league, perhaps, or one on a medium-profile team in a top league.\", \"\\u201cYou have to go somewhere where you play right away,\\u201d his U.S. teammate Chris Richards, who made a similar move to Europe from F.C. Dallas at age 18, said in an interview with the website Transfermarkt last week. \\u201cSometimes you get caught up in the big names, but it might not be the perfect situation.\\u201d\", \"There appears to be consensus, too, on the one area where he could improve the most: playing with his back to the goal. In those situations, Pepi prefers laying the ball off quickly to a teammate to get himself moving again. He does not yet look as comfortable holding the ball and withstanding a physical challenge from a defender, the kind of pause that top strikers must master in order to give their teammates time to build an attack around them.\", \"For Pepi, the key may be as simple as putting on some muscle.\", \"\\u201cAt the higher levels, the center backs, most of them are athletic beasts,\\u201d said Quill, Pepi\\u2019s former youth coach. \\u201cHe\\u2019s got a slim frame. He\\u2019s going to have to do a lot of work in the gym.\\u201d\", \"Molina concurred. \\u201cHis body hasn\\u2019t caught up to his brain yet,\\u201d he said.\", \"Pepi\\u2019s soccer brain and body will continue to develop, but his heart was already put to the test this past summer when he was forced to choose between representing the United States, where he was born, or Mexico, the home of his parents.\", \"Pepi grew up in San Elizario, Texas, a working-class town just outside El Paso. He spoke Spanish at home, followed Club Am\\u00e9rica of the Mexican league, rooted for Mexico\\u2019s national team and idolized its stars. Moving seamlessly between cultures was natural for him, the way it can be for countless children of immigrants around the world.\", \"In the end, Pepi chose the United States because of the comfort he had developed with the federation, and because of the opportunities the team offered to help him to thrive.\", \"\\u201cFollow your own path,\\u201d Pepi said when asked what advice he might give to another Mexican American player facing the same choice. \\u201cMake your decision with your heart.\\u201d\", \"Michael Orozco, a fellow Mexican American who played 29 games for the U.S. national team, was happy with Pepi\\u2019s choice. But he warned that Pepi could expect criticism, even vitriol, from Mexican fans moving forward, perhaps as soon as Friday night.\", \"In 2012, Orozco scored for the United States in a friendly at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City, helping to lead the Americans to their first-ever win on Mexican soil. Orozco, who was playing in the Mexican league at the time and now plays for the U.S.L.\\u2019s Orange County S.C., said he was criticized by his club teammates for scoring and, worse, for celebrating. Orozco said he had no regrets, and he hoped Pepi wouldn\\u2019t have any either.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s starting to prove himself,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNow, he has to live up to the potential.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ab9b278043da11ecbfaf2f41dabbb760"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ab9b278043da11ecbfaf2f41dabbb760"}},
