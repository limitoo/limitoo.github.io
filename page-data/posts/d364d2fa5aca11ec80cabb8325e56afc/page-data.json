The weapon was given to Baldwin by Halls, who told the actor that the prop was a \\\"cold gun,\\\" meaning that it did not contain live bullets. Initial investigations have determined that neither Halls nor Baldwin were aware that the gun was actually loaded at the time.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949849/rust-ranch-dave-halls-subpoena.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">'Rust' Assistant Director Dave Halls was issued a subpoena by New Mexico safety officials amid the ongoing investigation into the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins.

The Environment Department has already interviewed nine of the 150 employees working on the Rust set as part of its investigation, according to the New Mexican. \", \"Immediately after the incident, Baldwin said there were \\\"no words to convey my shock and sadness regarding the tragic accident that took the life of Halyna Hutchins, a wife, mother and deeply admired colleague of ours.\\\" In a lengthy interview with ABC last week, the actor gave an emotional interview in which he explained the events that lead to the deadly incident, and denied pulling the trigger of the gun. Instead, Baldwin said the revolver fired as he cocked the gun while practicing a scene.\", \"\\\"I feel someone is responsible for what happened, but I know it isn't me. I might have killed myself if I thought I was responsible, and I don't say that lightly,\\\" Baldwin told ABC television's George Stephanopoulos.\", \"\\\"I've been told by people in the know...that it is highly unlikely I would be charged with anything criminally,\\\" Baldwin added.\"]","href_hash":"d364d2fa5aca11ec80cabb8325e56afc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d364d2fa5aca11ec80cabb8325e56afc"}},
