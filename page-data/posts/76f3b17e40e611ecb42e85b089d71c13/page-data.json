In addition to providing an extra layer of security, they can also be used to monitor children and pets.\", \"US News reported that indoor cameras can be used as baby monitors, as well as pet cameras.\", \"\\\"You'll need a camera capable of recording 24/7 and it will need to be plugged in, but as long as it has two-way audio and will send alerts on sound or motion it will work as a reliable monitor,\\\" the outlet said.\", \"Additionally, indoor cameras can be used to monitor a babysitter, said ADP.\", \"Last month, two parents actually witnessed their babysitter attempting to force-feed their child while they were at work, all thanks to their indoor camera. They quickly drove home and took the footage to the police, who in turn arrested the babysitter and charged her with misdemeanor child abuse.\", \"They shared part of the footage on social media in an attempt to warn other parents to keep a close eye on their babysitters as well.\", \"ADP added that indoor cameras can be used to help settle insurance claims, should a break-in occur.\", \"Jones's indoor camera, however, captured a funny moment for her and millions of viewers to enjoy.\", \"\\\"I would have laughed so hard if they had done this to me,\\\" commented Hannah P.\", \"Margaret Rough added: \\\"I lost it when he said yuck.\\\"\", \"Of course, not everyone found the video funny. Some were offended by the workers' opinions and posted negatively about them.\", \"\\\"They probably only have a mattress on the floor,\\\" said MindYourBusiness.\", \"\\\"Meanwhile he's the type that has lawn chairs instead of couches,\\\" commented Emily Von Lintel.\", \"In response to some of the negativity, Jones wrote: \\\"Hey now, these guys work really hard. They aren't obligated to love pink.\\\"\", \"She also posted a follow-up video in which she encourages people to remove their negative comments from her video.\", \"\\\"Hey friends...kindness is the coolest,\\\" she wrote in the follow-up post's caption. \\\"If you're guilty of leaving hurtful comments somewhere on the internet...I'm challenging you to go delete them. Let's treat people the way we like to be treated mmmk?\\\"\", \"Of course, not everyone was interested in the drama. In fact, thousands of viewers wanted a tour of her apartment.\", \"\\\"You have a pink refrigerated [sic] and washing machine?\\\" asked the top commenter on the original video, \\\"We need a tour.\\\" More than 70,000 TikTokers liked the post in agreement.\", \"So, on October 30, Jones posted her \\\"YUCKY pink apartment tour.\\\" So far, that video has received more than 250,000 views.\", \"In addition to pink couch pillows, a pink desk chair and some pink wall art, she showed viewers that she does, in fact, have a pink refrigerator. However, the appliance itself isn't pink\\u2014she used peel and stick tape to decorate it.\", \"Though Jones's apartment does incorporate a lot of pink decor, it wasn't as overwhelming as viewers were anticipating.\", \"\\\"By their reaction I was expecting a lot more pink than this,\\\" said Jessica Qaos.\", \"\\\"I love how it's subtle,\\\" added Irene. \\\"Not so much pink, it's the perfect amount!
