This is lifetime decision. They should do it while they're in the orphanage. \", \"When we first covered this story more than two decades ago, Nina Kostina said that no information had been withheld from the family. But at the time, \\\"48 Hours\\\" spoke with eight families who adopted through the Frank Foundation, and they all said they had received inaccurate medical information. Their children had been diagnosed with illnesses like fetal alcohol syndrome, hepatitis C, brain tumors and a slew of psychological problems they claim the Frank Foundation didn't prepare them for.
