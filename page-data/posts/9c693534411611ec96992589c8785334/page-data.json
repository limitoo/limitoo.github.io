especially when port activities had intensified since the properties were bought.\", \"\\\"A more effective approach might have been for the port company to acoustically treat the houses before selling them, but it is understood that did not occur,\\\" Chiles said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/133508/eight_col_1012-GH-Upper-Logyard-05.jpg?1636429692\\\" alt=\\\"A large acoustic wall was built around the upper log yard.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nA large acoustic wall was built around the upper log yard. \\nPhoto: LDR/ Gisborne Herald/ Liam Clayton\\n</div>\", \"Eastland Group chief operating officer Andrew Gaddum said the company was constantly striving to find the appropriate balance between port operations to serve the region's economy and being a good neighbour.\", \"\\\"This is not always an easy task but as a working port located alongside residential houses, operating within the legal limits of our resource consents and port zoning is extremely important to us.\", \"\\\"It's equally important that we update our neighbours and the wider community on projects and activities, hear their feedback and continue to look at ideas to help mitigate the impacts of noise and vibrations,\\\" Gaddum said.\", \"A port community liaison group was established in 2008 to ensure regular communication between the port and its immediate neighbours, and was one of several ways residents could raise issues, he said.\", \"Brent Cuthbert, who has lived on Harris Street for a decade, requested the expert acoustic review after witnessing a significant increase in \\\"offensive\\\" noise and vibration from the 24/7 operation. This coincided with a marked increase in port export log activity, Cuthbert said.\", \"Eastland Port shifted a record three million tonnes of cargo in the financial year ending March 2018.\", \"\\\"I had serious concerns with shortcomings evident in the resource consents, district plan, noise complaints process and the night-time noise protection of affected residents,\\\" Cuthbert said.\", \"Chiles echoed his concerns. His review highlighted a \\\"significant issue\\\" in the definition of \\\"essential\\\" and \\\"non-essential\\\" port activity, with different noise controls for each and an \\\"error\\\" in the port boundaries that he said \\\"makes compliance impossible\\\".\", \"He also said the district plan's noise boundaries were based on an outdated forecast of port activity and excluded activity in areas such as the upper log yard. There also didn't appear to be a high level of trust between residents and the port, and residents felt their concerns were \\\"ignored\\\", Chiles said.\", \"He recommended a single, consistent set of noise controls be put in place that covered all port activities and called on Gisborne District Council and Eastland Group to further investigate the issues.\", \"Gaddum said the port had taken actions at the upper log yard, including the installation of a large acoustic wall around the perimeter of the site, a single entry/exit point to reduce traffic near residential properties and consistent hard surfacing.\", \"Some actions the port had taken to reduce noise in the upper log yard included reducing some of the log storage heights to five metres to minimise operational noise above the acoustic wall and not using high stackers between 9pm and 7am. Contractors were instructed on the rules to follow and, if there were any issues, a \\\"robust process\\\" was in place to address and rectify them. The port also established a new environmental manager role to manage resource consents and actively promote, manage and ensure compliance.\", \"The port was continuing to work through further options for mitigating operational impacts, and had started to discuss these with neighbours, with ideas including installing dual noise monitors in and near the upper log yard, extending the acoustic panel fence around the upper log yard entrance and a noise shroud around the hoist unit, Gaddum said.\", \"Council environmental services and protection director Helen Montgomery said the review of the TRMP would look at existing definitions and location of port noise boundaries. If there were any proposed changes to port noise boundaries, and/or definitions, the public and the port would have the opportunity to make submissions.\", \"Members of the public can raise issues by calling the council on 867-2049 or emailing the port at portfeedback@eastland.nz\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/211080/three_col_LDR-HORIZONTAL-FINAL-colour.jpg?1570666591\\\" alt=\\\"no metadata\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"Local Democracy Reporting is a public interest news service supported by RNZ, the News Publishers' Association and NZ On Air.\"]","href_hash":"9c693534411611ec96992589c8785334"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9c693534411611ec96992589c8785334"}},
