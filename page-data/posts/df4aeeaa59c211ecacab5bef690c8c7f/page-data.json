While companies that manufacture products in the United States no longer ship certain goods to China, competitors in Japan, Europe and elsewhere have continued to make sales. That has encouraged some high-tech companies to devote more spending on research and development outside the United States, to maintain access to the lucrative Chinese market.\", \"American-developed technology has also been used by authoritarian governments for more nefarious purposes, like monitoring and censoring their citizens.\", \"In a joint statement issued Friday, Australia, Denmark, Norway and the United States said that \\u201cauthoritarian governments increasingly are using surveillance tools and other related technologies in connection with serious human rights abuses, both within their countries and across international borders, including in acts of transnational repression to censor political opposition and track dissidents.\\u201d\", \"They added, \\u201cSuch use risks defeating the benefits that advanced technologies may bring to the world\\u2019s nations and peoples.\\u201d\", \"The work at this week\\u2019s summit includes exploring how best to strengthen domestic legal frameworks, share information on threats and risks, and share and develop best practices for controlling technology exports, a White House statement said.\", \"In the coming year, the countries are expected to consult with academics and industries on their efforts. Any decisions on controls of specific technologies will be voluntary and left up to individual countries to implement.\", \"The Biden administration has continued a trend, begun in the Trump administration, of leveling export controls at companies engaged in human rights violations, including those that have supported China\\u2019s repression of Muslim minorities.\", \"This week, the Biden administration announced new restrictions on Cambodia to address human rights abuses, corruption and the growing influence of China\\u2019s military in the country. In November, the administration blacklisted the NSO Group, an Israeli technology firm, saying the company knowingly supplied spyware used to target the phones of dissidents, human rights activists and journalists.\", \"The administration has also accelerated discussions of export controls with Europe, through a partnership set up this year called the Trade and Technology Council. But given that there is no legal basis for imposing import bans across the European Union, decisions on those restrictions fall to its member states.\", \"The United States is already part of a multilateral arrangement on export controls called the Wassenaar Arrangement, which was established in 1996. But critics say the grouping, which has more than 40 members, including Russia, has moved too slowly to match the pace of technological development.\"]","href_hash":"df4aeeaa59c211ecacab5bef690c8c7f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"df4aeeaa59c211ecacab5bef690c8c7f"}},
