Visas in hand, migrants have been boarding flights in Istanbul, Moscow and elsewhere to reach Belarus.\", \"On Friday some of those routes were closing after the European Union put pressure on some of the airlines involved. Turkish Civil Aviation and the Belarusian airline, Belavia, both announced Friday morning that Iraqi, Syrian and Yemeni citizens would no longer be allowed to board flights to Belarus.\", \"\\u201cDue to the problem of illegal border crossings between the European Union and Belarus, it has been decided that the citizens of Iraq, Syria and Yemen who want to travel to Belarus from Turkish airports will not be allowed to buy tickets and boarding until further notice,\\u201d the Turkish statement, released on Twitter, said.\", \"Belavia, which operates joint flights with Turkish Airlines from Istanbul, warned in a message on its website that passengers from Iraq, Syria and Yemen would not be allowed to board flights to Belarus from Turkey and offered them a full refund.\", \"Earlier in the week, Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the E.U. would \\u201cexplore how to sanction, including through blacklisting, third country airlines that are active in human trafficking.\\u201d \", \"It is not clear how the E.U. would define \\u201chuman trafficking,\\u201d or how an airline is supposed to distinguish between a tourist and a migrant.
