The agency will count the ballots on March 28.\", \"Workers at an Amazon warehouse near Birmingham, known as BHM1, had voted against forming an union last spring after a highly contentious and public campaign. The labor agency threw out the results after finding Amazon improperly interfered with the election, opening the door for a new vote.\", \"The agency told the workers on Tuesday that in the original vote, Amazon \\u201cinterfered with the employees\\u2019 exercise of a free and reasoned choice\\u201d by having a mailbox installed at the warehouse, \\u201ccreating the appearance of irregularity,\\u201d and polling workers about their opinion. Amazon, which has said the mailbox was intended to make voting easier, has not appealed the decision to rerun the election.\", \"The prominent organizing effort has been run by the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union. It has drawn national attention from politicians and other figures as it aims to form the first union at one of the nation's largest employers.\", \"Barbara Agrait, an Amazon spokeswoman, said in a statement that Amazon\\u2019s \\u201cemployees have always had the choice of whether or not to join a union, and they overwhelmingly chose not to join,\\u201d adding that the company looked forward to the workers \\u201chaving their voices heard again.\\u201d\", \"The union said in a statement that it had asked the agency to provide \\u201ca number of remedies that could have made the process fairer to workers\\u201d in the new election, but that the agency did not approve their requests. \\u201cWe are deeply concerned that the decision fails to adequately prevent Amazon from continuing its objectionable behavior in a new election,\\u201d the union said.\", \"The company, which has vowed to become a \\u201cEarth\\u2019s best employer,\\u201d is facing labor pressure on multiple fronts. It has said it would spend $4 billion in the holiday quarter alone to deal with labor shortages. Workers in Staten Island are also trying to unionize, and last month Amazon and the labor board signed an unusually broad nationwide settlement giving workers more power to organize.\"]","href_hash":"27dc5e88730e11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"27dc5e88730e11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
