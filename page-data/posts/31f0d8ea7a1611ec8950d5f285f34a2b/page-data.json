but there was surge capacity if needed.\", \"Middlemore Hospital acute critical services clinical director Vanessa Thornton said they were trying to keep services running as normal as possible but there would be disruptions, particularly as there were already staff shortages.\", \"\\\"While hospitalisation rates overseas are lower than during the Delta outbreak, we do expect that our hospital system will be under pressure due to the large number of people likely to be infected with the Omicron variant,\\\" she said.\", \"Omicron was very difficult to model, Jackson said.\", \"If the variant was discovered in the community on February 1, hypothetically, daily cases in the Auckland region would reach 1500 to 1800 cases a day by March and April before dropping to 150 to 330 a day from May to September, he said.\", \"Though it was possible case numbers would be higher in reality, he was optimistic people would follow public health measures and the case numbers would stay within his predicted range.\", \"On Thursday, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the country would go to the red setting, the strictest level of the COVID-19 Protection Framework, within a maximum of 48 hours of discovering Omicron in the community.\", \"That meant a limit on gathering numbers and greater restrictions for people who were not vaccinated.\", \"She said an Omicron outbreak would likely look more like the one in South Australia rather than the huge outbreaks in Sydney and Melbourne.\", \"RNZ has asked the Ministry of Health for hospitalisation prediction figures for the rest of the country.\", \"RNZ\"]","href_hash":"31f0d8ea7a1611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"31f0d8ea7a1611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
