informal software applications and personal hardware devices - which in turn increases IT risk even more, creating a never-ending risk cycle that gets worse with every turn.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/123364/eight_col_WaikatoDHB.jpg?1622183482\\\" alt=\\\"Waikato District Health Board IT systems outage after cyber attack.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nSome medical devices had poorly-configured IT security controls that could be compromised by malware, resulting in bad readings and corrupted data. \\nPhoto: RNZ / Andrew McRae\\n</div>\", \"With a limited budget, Waikato DHB was faced with a difficult choice when allocating resources, the report said, and cyber security had not been a priority when the DHB was struggling to meet minimum requirements for IT provision to support the delivery of healthcare.\", \"\\\"This trade-off is a common one at the DHB, even though the consequences of a targeted cyberattack would be catastrophic for patient safety.\\\"\", \"Sources told Local Democracy Reporting the draft strategy was abandoned because of cost but Waikato DHB chief executive Dr Kevin Snee said: \\\"This was a working document that was an input into the broader Digital Health Strategy that subsequently came to the executive on May 13.\\\"\", \"\\\"It proposed substantial investment into digital technology, was supported by the executive, and was due to go to the commissioners on 26 May but was interrupted by the cyberattack.\\\"\", \"A DHB spokesperson said the work had been initiated by the DHB's new digital leadership to address any areas that required attention, and support the migration to new solutions such as cloud-based applications, which would also introduce new cyber security considerations as it moved systems outside the \\\"perimeter security\\\" setting of firewalls, intrusion and malware protections.\", \"\\\"The document had not yet reached final draft, had not been reviewed or qualified and had not been presented to management or governance.\\\"\", \"The broader Digital Health Strategy, which would have involved substantial investment, was presented to the executive and supported on May 13 and was due to go to the Finance Risk and Audit committee on May 26, the spokesperson said.\", \"\\\"The security strategy work would have informed the Digital Health Strategy as one aspect of that wider programme.\\\"\", \"It had not been costed and any associated work programmes not confirmed.\", \"\\\"This work was interrupted by the cyberattack but has now been restarted.\\\"\", \"When asked whether the strategy could have prevented the attack if implemented, the spokesman said elements described in the strategy were under way and in some cases accelerated, such as the migration to the Cloud and organisation-wide adoption of Windows 10.\", \"\\\"...There is no current evidence to indicate whether full implementation of the draft long-term strategy would have impacted the May 18 event.\\\"\", \"The spokesman said Windows 10 was deployed on all compatible machines at the time of the cyber-event.\", \"\\\"It is noted that it is not possible in all instances to run Windows 10 due to specific peripheral hardware or medical compliance needs.
