Most sensible folk are probably done with politics by now.\", \"However, for those who have been paying attention, events over the past week have neatly captured the major trends and political changes of 2021,\\u00a0which \\u2014\\u00a0to varying degrees \\u2014\\u00a0will shape the coming election.\", \"On Friday, Labor delivered a detailed climate policy that\\u00a0won immediate backing from business. Anthony Albanese's level of climate ambition isn't all that different to Bill Shorten's before the last election.\\u00a0\", \"The big shift in 2021 has come from business groups. It would have been previously unthinkable for the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and others to endorse a Labor climate policy.\", \"Their willingness to do so, coupled with even greater ambition from Liberal state governments, is potentially an election game-changer.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/dfbd3510048f543c6166ace69798940d\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Labor Leader Anthony Albanese outlines his party's climate strategy.</div>\", \"On Monday, Annastacia Palaszczuk announced she would bring forward the re-opening of the Queensland border to next week.\", \"South Australia, meanwhile, is holding the line in keeping its border open. This marks another major shift of 2021.\\u00a0\", \"After early supply failures, the vaccination take-up has beaten most expectations. The states \\u2014 most of them, anyway \\u2014\\u00a0are relying on vaccines rather than border closures to manage COVID-19.\", \"It remains to be seen how much credit, if any, flows to Scott Morrison,\\u00a0but it's a far happier place for the Prime Minister to be than earlier in the year \\u2014\\u00a0when too few were vaccinated, major cities were in rolling lockdowns and borders were slammed shut.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Fractures and flirtations within the Nationals</div>\", \"On Tuesday, the National Party was agonising over George Christensen's latest flirtation with the far right. This has been a regular theme throughout the year; National Party MPs at war with each other over their rogue elements and their own identity.\\u00a0\", \"In 2021, Barnaby Joyce returned to the leadership, ostensibly so the Nationals could take a tougher line against any move by the Morrison Government towards adopting a net zero by 2050 emissions target.\", \"After plenty of noise, net zero was ultimately endorsed, and it remains unclear what the Nationals achieved in return.\", \"The party remains fractured over personalities, policies and who it's seeking to represent.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b0928577be4594b961bb0d9b53113b8e\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> In 2021, Barnaby Joyce returned to the leadership and found himself dealing with rogue colleagues and net zero promises.(ABC News: Adam Kennedy)</div>\", \"On Wednesday, the New South Wales\\u00a0Premier took to the stage at the National Press Club and took the leadership mantle on national reform.\", \"State leaders have been thrust into national prominence throughout the pandemic. The notable shift in 2021 has been their willingness to grab the steering wheel on matters beyond COVID-19, particularly climate change.\\u00a0\", \"Dominic Perrottet is now proposing sweeping reform of health, the NDIS, and the \\\"complete dog's breakfast\\\" of overlapping state and federal responsibilities in the skills and education sector.\", \"He wants a proper review of the weaknesses COVID-19 has exposed in our Federation, \\\"a lack of clarity about who is responsible for what, buck-passing, blame-shifting and sometimes, hyper-parochialism\\\".\\u00a0\", \"At a federal level, there's little appetite on either side of politics to even touch these problems.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">The rise of independents</div>\", \"Yesterday, the Prime Minister also confirmed Australia will join a \\\"diplomatic boycott\\\" of next year's Beijing Winter Olympics. Scott Morrison said the decision should come as \\\"no surprise\\\" and he was right.\\u00a0\", \"The downward spiral in relations began before 2021. The shift this year has been an acceptance that rapprochement with Beijing isn't going to happen. Instead, reality has been accepted and the government has gone about putting harder defences and alliances in place to deal with a more dangerous security environment.\\u00a0\", \"This year, the Quad was elevated, AUKUS was born\\u00a0and conventional submarines were ditched in favour of nuclear-powered boats.
