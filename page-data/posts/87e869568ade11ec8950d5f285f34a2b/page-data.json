\"Tropical Cyclone Dovi, which passed over New Caledonia and Vanuatu earlier this week, is set to approach New Zealand from the northwest this Friday.\", \"MetService said heavy rain was expected to start affecting central New Zealand from Friday afternoon, while gales were expected over the weekend for central and northern parts of the country.\", \"A heavy rain warning is place from tonight for Taranaki, Tasman west of Motueka, Horowhenua and Kapiti, Marlborough Sounds, Tararua Range, Wellington and Wairarapa (excluding the Tararua District).\", \"A strong wind watch is in place over the weekend for Northland and Auckland, including Great Barrier Island, Wellington, Marlborough Sounds, Tasman, and Buller.\", \"Dozens of people had to evacuate their homes in the Buller town of Westport yesterday, some for the second time in a week, because of fears swollen rivers would burst their banks as torrential rain continued to pour down.\", \"There were concerns the rain would result in flooding worse than last July when hundreds of homes in Westport were damaged, and some left unliveable.\", \"Although some properties were damaged this time, the water levels have dropped, sparing the town from a major flood.\", \"Civil Defence West Coast group controller Te Aroha Cook told Morning Report that with rain ceasing overnight for a few hours, river levels had receded significantly.\", \"\\\"The Buller [river] peaked at 11.4 [metres] last night and then once that started to drop and recede it meant that we were able to allow the majority of people in the Westport township to return home [last night].\", \"\\\"There are still a few in some of our evacuations, but those remaining are down to single numbers.\\\"\", \"The heavy rain has also caused rubbish from the Reefton Landfill site to run downstream.\", \"Cook said rock protection around the closed landfill, on the west of the town next to the Inangahua River, failed in this week's deluge.\", \"<img

meteorologist Lewis Ferris told Morning Report while it would be dry for most of the West Coast today, the rain would intensify ahead of cyclone Dovi over the weekend.\", \"Ferris said there was a \\\"very good possibility\\\" the rain would fall into the same Inangahua-Reefton catchment area, which has been on the brink since heavy rain started last week.\", \"\\\"It does look like that river rise once again, so it's something we will be monitoring and talking to the regional council on as we get closer to the event.\", \"\\\"Little differences about where that rain is actually going to fall will make quite a big difference on the accumulation off back of what so far has been a very wet month.\\\"\", \"Civil Defence's Te Aroha Cook said they were working on having more emergency plans in place before this upcoming bout of heavy rain hits.\", \"Buller mayor Jamie Cleine told Morning Report that the state of emergency declared yesterday would continue until further notice.\", \"Cleine estimated that homes that may need to be red-stickered as a result would number in the double-digit range.\", \"Assessments will be carried out today to review any damage and repairs required to the water and road network as well as homes.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/137757/eight_col_cape_FW1.jpg?1643952434\\\" alt=\\\"State Highway 67 from Westport to Cape

Highway 67 between Karamea and Mokihinui will remain closed until tomorrow at the earliest, because this week's heavy rain has triggered more than 30 slips along a 23-kilometre stretch of it.\", \"Residents needing hospital treatment are being airlifted out, and helicopters taking tourists out of the region are returning with essential supplies.\", \"Buller District Council said the road was expected to be reopened at 9am tomorrow, depending on final assessments - though full repair work would continue for several months.\", \"Cleine said this bout of heavy rain was much worse than last week.\", \"\\\"Some these slips that have happened have been developed worse by the last couple of days' weather as well.
