His old school coach from 20 years ago reflects on the cricket star's career and just how far he's come from playing for Palmerston North Boys' High School.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/283889/eight_col_Taylor1.jpg?1640916239\\\" alt=\\\"Ross Taylor of New Zealand edges a ball from Tony Palladino of Essex to Jason Gallian.

He took wickets with his off-spin and pouched a couple of smart catches at slip.\", \"Over the next two years, and then the next two decades, Taylor didn't look back.\", \"He was a dominant schoolboy cricketer who quickly made his mark at first-class level for Central Districts, before his New Zealand debut in 2006.\", \"The 37-year-old this week announced this summer would be his last at international level, after more than 400 matches and 40 international centuries. He is currently playing in the Test against Bangladesh in Mount Maunganui.\", \"Gibbs said he couldn't take credit for any of that, but watching former pupils blossom was rewarding for a teacher and schoolboy coach.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/283835/four_col_211230BlackCapsTraining_009.jpg?1640833134\\\" alt=\\\"Ross Taylor announces his retirement\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nRoss Taylor announced his retirement at the end of 2021  \\nPhoto: PhotoSport / Jeremy Ward\\n</div>\", \"He's followed Taylor's achievements closely and the pair speak a few times a year.\", \"\\\"Ross is a pretty humble guy and he'd probably cross the street to see me, which says a hell of a lot about him.\", \"\\\"He's turned cricket into a career. He's from a real humble background.\", \"\\\"[If I saw him today] I'd say to him that I was proud of him, the school was proud of him and the country is proud of him. I don't think there's any better accolade you can have than that.\\\"\", \"Scoring one century is an achievement for a schoolboy. Taylor scored several, including two in one match against Palmerston North's Marist club, which traditionally boasts a powerhouse line-up full of rep and first-class players.\", \"Gibbs said Taylor, who boarded at the Boys' High College House hostel, was exceptional and a standout player at school level.\", \"\\\"All the characteristics you still see today were prevalent when he was playing for the school, the fast hands, the cut shot and the ability to hit big.\", \"\\\"He had an innate ability to dominate. He was thinking boundary off every ball.\\\"\", \"Taylor was a master at pushing the score along, but also taking a single and having a break to reassess.\", \"And, unlike other youngsters, he didn't play in fear of getting out, Gibbs said.\", \"On Saturday Taylor takes the field for his second-to-last test against Mt Maunganui in Bangladesh.\", \"Gibbs can't watch, because he's on holiday in Tolaga Bay and has no internet connection, but will follow as best he can, as he has done for the past 20 years.\"]","href_hash":"499ed06e6cb511ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"499ed06e6cb511ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
