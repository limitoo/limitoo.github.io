\"The warning comes as Treasurer Josh Frydenberg gears up to deliver his Mid-Year Economic Fiscal Outlook (MYEFO) report.\", \"It has already\\u00a0been revealed that the GDP figure would\\u00a0be better than the budget predicted and business investment is up 16 per cent.\", \"Today, Mr Frydenberg said other indicators were also on a better track, including jobs growth.\", \"However,\\u00a0he said, the states' cooperation on border openings would\\u00a0be critical to the economy's momentum.\", \"South Australian Premier Steven Marshall has already made a pledge not to close his state's borders.\", \"\\\"We are very concerned about Omicron still. at the moment, but we've now ruled out complete\\u00a0statewide lockdowns or statewide lockouts, so I think that's going to provide huge relief,\\\" Mr Marshall\\u00a0said.\", \"Queensland and the Northern Territory will soon open their borders as well, but Western Australia is expected to stay closed until into next year.\", \"Shadow Assistant Treasurer Andrew Leigh said the federal government should take a different approach to concerns about state border closures.\", \"\\\"I think \\u2014\\u00a0rather than trying to pick fights with premiers and chief ministers \\u2014\\u00a0they'd be better to work with the states and territories,\\\" Mr Leigh said.\", \"<img

more workers arriving in Australia next year.(ABC News: Marco Catalano)</div>\", \"Mr Frydenberg conceded\\u00a0the states' cooperation was not\\u00a0the only threat.\", \"\\\"Obviously new variants are a risk but the early signs about Omicron are not as concerning as what some people initially thought,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We are still waiting for the data to come through but the early signs are good.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Skilled worker boost\\u00a0expected</div>\", \"And there's also the problem of skilled workers to meet vacancies and jobs growth.\", \"Mr Frydenberg said\\u00a0the government might\\u00a0be able to announce soon when it would lift a pause on entry to Australia for foreign workers.\", \"He said the MYEFO report would\\u00a0include forecasts for more workers to come to Australia\\u00a0in the coming year.\", \"\\\"We will also be announcing, in MYEFO, the expectation we'll be getting an extra 120,000 workers, 120,000\\u00a0people we were not expecting in that timeframe because the borders can more safely reopen earlier,\\\" he said.\", \"Labor is concerned about the plans, saying more details\\u00a0are needed.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We just don't have any detail,\\\" Mr Leigh said.\", \"\\\"All we have today is yet another number, thrown out in an attempt to get a headline or a soundbite.\", \"\\\"We don't have the detail that would allow Australians to judge what the migration settings will look like.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Inflation being monitored\\u00a0</div>\", \"While inflation is causing concern overseas, Mr Frydenberg says Australia is in a better position.\", \"\\\"We are watching inflation very carefully,\\\" Mr Frydenberg\\u00a0said.\", \"\\\"What's driving inflation is supply-side constraints, that's one factor, so higher costs for building materials and timber and steel and the like.\", \"\\\"We've also seen fuel prices go up and that's been a global phenomenon.\", \"\\\"For example, the gas shortages in the UK are quite different to the energy challenges here in Australia.\\\"\", \"The Reserve Bank \\u2014 which kept the nation's official interest rate at 0.1 per cent this week \\u2014 is taking a cautious approach amid surging job ads and signs that inflation pressures are embedding themselves in the economy.\", \"This may force the RBA, at its final meeting of the year, to bring forward plans to slow its money-creation program.\"]","href_hash":"2772d3825a4f11ec8c0a29e3b2b8322e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2772d3825a4f11ec8c0a29e3b2b8322e"}},
