Long distance wasn\\u2019t working, she told him. She had found another man. The relationship was over.\", \"\\u201cI hanged up and put Vicente Fern\\u00e1ndez on,\\u201d said Mr. Castillo, 30. He played \\u201cLa Cruz de Tu Olvido,\\u201d in which Mr. Fern\\u00e1ndez bellows, \\u201cAs I looked at the evil in your eyes, I understood that you have never loved me.\\u201d He played it louder, again and again, until he was done crying.\", \"\\u201cWith his songs,\\u201d Mr. Castillo said, \\u201cyou just feel it inside you.\\u201d\", \"For generations, Mr. Fern\\u00e1ndez\\u2019s often sorrowful songs have served as a balm for the heartbroken. Over a career that spanned six decades, Mr. Fern\\u00e1ndez, the Mexican ranchera superstar who died on Sunday at 81, recorded hundreds of songs and dozens of albums, singing of unrequited love, scornful partners and tarnished romance.\", \"In that time, Mr. Fern\\u00e1ndez, known to millions as Chente, became a beacon for the brokenhearted, a man to listen to when love has gone awry and all you want \\u2014 besides, perhaps, some tequila \\u2014 are plucky guitars, harmonized horns and someone to give voice to your most intimate feelings.\", \"\\u201cFor a lot of people with Mexican descent, his voice is home,\\u201d said Rachel Yvonne Cruz, a professor of Mexican American studies and a music specialist at the University of Texas at San Antonio.\", \"That explains why so many people, mostly Latinos, turn to him when they are down, she said.\", \"\\u201cWhen Vicente Fern\\u00e1ndez sang, he expressed all of those emotions that we keep held inside: that silent cry, that silent scream that\\u2019s happening when you\\u2019re heartbroken, when you just cannot anymore,\\u201d Dr. Cruz said. \\u201cAnd when you listened to him, you were able to have that release that you needed.\\u201d\", \"Who broke Mr. Fern\\u00e1ndez\\u2019s heart? That remains a playful mystery among his fans. He married Mar\\u00eda del Refugio Abarca Villase\\u00f1or when he was in his early 20s, and the two stayed together until his death.\", \"But however and whenever his heartbreak occurred, his fans say, his anguish came through in his lyrics.\", \"\\u201cYour mouth, your eyes and your hair, I carry them in my mind, night and day,\\u201d Mr. Fern\\u00e1ndez sings in \\u201cLas Llaves de Mi Alma.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBecause of your damn love, I can\\u2019t bring an end to so much shame,\\u201d he roars in \\u201cPor Tu Maldito Amor.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIn a frame, I will put your portrait, and in my hand, another glass of wine,\\u201d he croons in \\u201cTu Camino y el M\\u00edo.\\u201d\", \"That was the song that helped Fernanda Aguilera.\", \"\\u201cI had been with someone since, I guess, high school, and then you think, \\u2018Well, this is going to be my person,\\u2019\\u201d said Ms. Aguilera, 27, of San Antonio. But when college came and they went their separate ways, she realized that the relationship \\u201cwas just an illusion in my head.\\u201d\", \"She played \\u201cTu Camino y el M\\u00edo\\u201d (\\u201cYour Road and Mine\\u201d), and recalled thinking: \\u201cThis is exactly how I feel, but I could just never find the words. And it\\u2019s like he put the words together for me.\\u201d\", \"On a cool March night in Oxnard, Calif., a brokenhearted Jaime Tapia grabbed some beers, invited a friend to his house and put on a Vicente Fern\\u00e1ndez playlist. Mr. Tapia was 19. He and his girlfriend of four years had decided to cut off their relationship earlier that night.\", \"Mirroring the way Mr. Fern\\u00e1ndez had dealt with heartache in the movies (mostly with alcohol, a somber stare into the middle distance and buddies who reassure him he will be OK), Mr. Tapia and his friend kept the beers coming as they sat on the hoods of their cars.\", \"\\u201cJust dozing off, looking at the stars,\\u201d he said. He was lonely and drunk for the first time in his life.\", \"\\u201cA lot of the songs that Chente talks about are about breakups, being in a cantina, stuff like that,\\u201d Mr. Tapia said. \\u201cSo even though you feel sad at the time, you felt good that you were bonding with a buddy and that you weren\\u2019t by yourself.\\u201d\", \"Ranchera music \\u201ccan be thought of as a sung exposition of one\\u2019s most honest emotions,\\u201d said M\\u00f3nica Fogelquist, a professor of practice in mariachi and ethnomusicology at the University of Texas at Austin.\", \"\\u201cIn Mexican culture, men are supposed to be strong, valiant, proud and void of any sentiment,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThey don\\u2019t cry, and they don\\u2019t express vulnerability, including heartache. However, through music, all the unexpressed or prohibited emotions are free to come out.\\u201d\", \"People have used Chente\\u2019s romantic tunes to try to win back an estranged partner through serenatas, a musical message of love delivered by a mariachi band in front of a lover\\u2019s window \\u2014 a tradition that Mr. Fern\\u00e1ndez popularized in films.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s pretty popular; we\\u2019ve been hired a couple times to help win that person back,\\u201d said Giovanni Garcia, who manages the band Mariachi Estrellas de Chicago. He added, \\u201cThere\\u2019s been a couple of times where they\\u2019ll tell us, \\u2018Oh, I\\u2019m in the doghouse right now and hoping this will help me.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Sometimes it works, he said. Often, it doesn\\u2019t \\u2014 even if the band plays one of Mr. Fern\\u00e1ndez\\u2019s songs.\", \"Someone tried it on Laura Figueroa once. It did not end well.\", \"A mariachi band knocked on her door in Chicago. Her little brother let them inside, and the musicians marched through the kitchen and into her bedroom. She was 22 at the time.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m sitting there looking down at the floor like, \\u2018Oh my God, there\\u2019s literally a mariachi in my house,\\u2019\\u201d said Ms. Figueroa, now 39. She does not believe the band played Chente, and in any event she did not take her former lover back.\", \"Jesus Gutierrez, 37, of Chicago said his father used to sing \\u201cHermoso Cari\\u00f1o\\u201d (\\u201cBeautiful Darling\\u201d) by Mr. Fern\\u00e1ndez to his mother, Juana, when they were dating in Guanajuato, Mexico. She used to be embarrassed when telling the story, Mr. Gutierrez said, because his father, Nicolas, was \\u201cnot a good singer.\\u201d\", \"But perhaps it worked, he said, because they married, had children and listened to ranchera music together for decades. She saved nearly all of her Chente vinyl records and screamed every word of his heartbreaking songs at his concerts, her son recalled.\", \"In 2019, Juana Gutierrez died, and Chente\\u2019s songs came to represent a new type of heartbreak for Mr. Gutierrez. He said he couldn\\u2019t play some of his mother\\u2019s favorites anymore because \\u201cit\\u2019s too much.\\u201d\", \"But on Sunday, when he heard Mr. Fern\\u00e1ndez had died, he knew right away how he would spend his evening: the same way he and so many others had gotten through their first breakups and final goodbyes.\", \"He scrolled through his playlist until he found \\u201cHermoso Cari\\u00f1o.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cPrecious gift, from heaven it has come,\\u201d Mr. Fern\\u00e1ndez sang. \\u201cAnd that has filled me with happiness and love.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"5f11691c5d1e11eca890bf440dcff6d4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5f11691c5d1e11eca890bf440dcff6d4"}},
