The company never came close to reaching the projections, which Holmes testified was for a variety of reasons.\", \"She said the 2015 projection was that large due to an agreement to expand their testing program into 3,000 Walgreens stores. The deal never came to fruition because the retailer eventually backed out.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939263/elizabeth-holmes-theranos.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Elizabeth Holmes, center, walks into federal court in San Jose, Calif., Monday, Holmes is accused of duping elite financial backers, customers and patients into believing that her startup was about to revolutionize medicine.</div>\", \"Holmes acknowledged making some mistakes as CEO of Theranos, a company she founded in 2003 when she was just 19. But she repeatedly emphasized that she made most of her decisions with the help of other executives and a respected board that included former cabinet members in various presidential administrations.\", \"\\\"It is never smooth,\\\" Holmes testified. \\\"There's always challenges.\\\"\", \"Theranos eventually collapsed after a series of explosive articles in The Wall Street Journal and an audit by federal regulators exposed serious and potentially dangerous flaws in the company's blood tests. The scandal wiped out Holmes' fortune, which was estimated at $4.5 billion in 2014 when she was the subject of a glowing cover story in Fortune magazine.\", \"Holmes addressed several prickly areas that government prosecutors highlighted while presenting their case during the first 10 weeks of the trial.\", \"Balwani's role as an executive at Theranos came up Tuesday for the first time since Holmes took the stand late last week. At one point, Holmes indirectly criticized Balwani for a brusque 2013 email he sent scolding a former Theranos manager, Surekha Gangakhedkar, in the middle of the night. Gangakhedkar, who testified about expressing concerns about problems with Theranos' technology, eventually resigned, citing the stress she felt.\", \"Holmes told the jury she regretted that episode with Gangahedkar. \\\"This is the wrong way to treat people,\\\" she said.\", \"Another moment of contrition came when she took responsibility for adding the logo of Pfizer, a major drug maker, to a report extolling the effectiveness of Theranos' technology. That decision came after an internal Pfizer report that Holmes said she never saw had expressed doubts about the reliability of Theranos' blood tests.\", \"\\\"I wish I had done it differently,\\\" Holmes said. Several investors have testified that seeing Pfizer's logo on the report helped persuade them to invest in Theranos.\", \"Holmes, who raised nearly $1 billion after founding Theranos in 2003, is facing allegations of duping investors, patients and business partners while running the Palo Alto, California, company.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939265/elizabeth-holmes-theranos.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Theranos founder and former CEO Elizabeth Holmes along with her partner Billy Evans (R) depart the Robert F.
