More frequent marine heatwaves primarily driven by the burning of coal and gas means it is not getting this time.\\\"\", \" Australia's conservative government earlier this year announced new funding in the hope of preventing the climate-ravaged reef from being removed from UNESCO's World Heritage list.\", \" When the UN previously threatened to downgrade the reef's World Heritage listing in 2015, Australia created a \\\"Reef 2050\\\" plan and poured billions of dollars into protection.\", \" The measures are believed to have arrested the pace of decline, but much of the world's largest reef system has already been damaged.\", \" A recent study found bleaching had affected 98 percent of the reef since 1998, leaving just a fraction untouched.\", \" The Great Barrier Reef -- the world's largest living structure, visible from space -- was added to the list in 1981 for its \\\"superlative natural beauty\\\" and extensive biodiversity.\", \" But the list is not permanently fixed, and sites can be downgraded or even removed entirely on the U.N. body's recommendation.\", \" While placement on the \\\"in-danger\\\" list is not considered a sanction -- some nations have their sites added to gain international attention to help save them -- others see it as a dinosaur.\"]","href_hash":"edfcedeea6a811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"edfcedeea6a811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
