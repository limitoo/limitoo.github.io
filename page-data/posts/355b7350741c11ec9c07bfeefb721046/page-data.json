On Wednesday, after weeks of speculation and leaks in the music press, the festival announced its complete 2022 lineup, which will also feature performances by Megan Thee Stallion, Lil Baby, Doja Cat, Phoebe Bridgers, the reunited electronic dance group Swedish House Mafia and dozens of others. (West is billed on the official festival poster as simply Ye.)\", \"The event is expected to run at its full capacity of up to 125,000 concertgoers a day.\", \"Coachella has long been the country\\u2019s most influential festival, hosting viral moments like Tupac Shakur\\u2019s hologram in 2012 and Beyonc\\u00e9\\u2019s 2018 tribute to the marching bands of historically Black colleges and universities.\", \"It has usually been the first big festival to announce its lineup each year, ushering in the touring season. But this week Coachella was scooped by the Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival in Manchester, Tenn., which on Tuesday said that it would return in June with Tool, J. Cole, Stevie Nicks, the Chicks, Machine Gun Kelly, Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, and others.\", \"Coachella was one of entertainment\\u2019s first major casualties of the coronavirus. Its 2020 edition \\u2014 which was to have featured Rage Against the Machine, Travis Scott and Frank Ocean \\u2014 was shut down by health officials on March 10 of that year, two days before Broadway and the concert business at large went dark.\", \"Goldenvoice, the promoter that puts on Coachella in partnership with the corporate concert giant AEG Presents, had hoped to bring the festival back that fall, then in spring 2021. But each time the pandemic forced the plans to be kicked further down the road. Bonnaroo, which is presented by Live Nation, AEG\\u2019s corporate rival, had scheduled a full-scale return last September, but it was canceled after heavy rains flooded the festival grounds.\", \"About half of the ticket holders to Coachella\\u2019s 2020 edition requested refunds, Paul Tollett, one of the festival\\u2019s founders, said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in August. Tickets cost $449 and up, not counting fees.\", \"Despite a slew of recent cancellations related to the coronavirus, like Dead & Company\\u2019s Playing in the Sand festival in Canc\\u00fan, Mexico, the music world is viewing Coachella with hope as a bellwether for the full-throttle return of the multibillion-dollar touring industry. Major tours by Dua Lipa, the Weeknd, Elton John, Bon Jovi and Justin Bieber are expected this year.\", \"As recently as last summer, Goldenvoice had hoped to bring back most of the headliners planned for 2020. But while Rage Against the Machine has an extensive tour planned this year \\u2014 with five dates booked at Madison Square Garden in August \\u2014 it is not playing Coachella. Ocean will return to Coachella in 2023.\", \"And since the disaster at Scott\\u2019s Astroworld festival in Houston in November that left 10 people dead, the rapper has largely withdrawn from public appearances, canceling his performance as a headliner at the Day N Vegas festival, which is also presented by Goldenvoice.\"]","href_hash":"355b7350741c11ec9c07bfeefb721046"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"355b7350741c11ec9c07bfeefb721046"}},
