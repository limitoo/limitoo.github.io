But lately Americans have been returning to flight hubs by the millions \\u2014 packed, vaccinated and thirsting for a cure for what the Germans call Fernweh: the yearning for far-off places. Still, you don\\u2019t need a plane to reactivate your curiosity. Seven fascinating and purposeful new books revive the mystery, the history and the possibilities of the reawakened planet.\", \"In THE ART OF PATIENCE: Seeking the Snow Leopard in Tibet (Penguin Press, 195 pp., $26), the French writer Sylvain Tesson chronicles his rapturous journey through Tibet\\u2019s Chantang plateau with the wildlife photographer Vincent Munier. Tesson\\u2019s words, in a ravishing translation by Frank Wynne, paint pictures as vivid as any photograph. Observing Lake Yaniugol, rising high in the steppe, he writes: \\u201cIt settled like a sacred host of jade upon the sand. It appeared to us at twilight, in the hollow of a ledge, flanked to the north by the sharp incisors of the Kunlun peaks soaring to 6,000 meters, and to the south by the Changtang. Behind this shimmering disk, the secret plateau.\\u201d\", \"When Munier invited Tesson to join his expedition to track the panther of the snows, he warned that they might come away \\u201cempty-handed.\\u201d Only about 5,000 snow leopards still exist, and sightings are rare. For several weeks in a frigid February, Tesson camped and climbed, lurking in rough hides on mountain ridges, breathing subzero air that \\u201csmelled of cold stone\\u201d under skies \\u201csteel blue as an anvil.\\u201d\", \"From his perch amid the crags, Tesson imagined a Vernean social hierarchy among the animals below: The yaks were \\u201cburghers, warmly attired\\u201d; wolves were \\u201cknavish princes\\u201d poised for predation; and the herd animals \\u2014 bharal sheep and black-striped kiangs (wild donkeys) \\u2014 were the \\u201cgeneral populace.\\u201d But where was the snow leopard, the elusive \\u201cregent\\u201d? When one finally appears in Tesson\\u2019s telescope, he can\\u2019t make it out. And then he does: \\u201cThe snow leopard lifted its head, sniffed the air. It was garbed in the heraldry of the Tibetan landscape. Its coat, a mosaic of gold and bronze.\\u201d Gazing at the animal until his eye dries out from the biting cold, he startles when the leopard gazes back. \\u201cIts eyes bored into me. Two blazing glacial orbs of scorn.\\u201d Will it pounce? he anxiously wonders. \\u201cIt yawned,\\u201d he writes. \\u201cThis is the effect of man on the snow leopard of Tibet.\\u201d\", \"One country to the west, the conservationist William deBuys paused while trekking Nepal\\u2019s Upper Dolpo to admire the blue waters of the Suli Gad, where \\u201cboulders froth the tumbling river into wet clouds,\\u201d and \\u201cscraps of rainbows wink from the haze.\\u201d Outside the village of Namgung, he listened, rapt, as hundreds of migrating demoiselle cranes passed, filling the sky with \\u201ccreaking, croaking positional calls.\\u201d\", \"But deBuys did not go to Nepal to sightsee. He went to help the sick and to ponder \\u201cthe connection between human behavior and the condition of the planet.\\u201d In THE TRAIL TO KANJIROBA: Rediscovering Earth in an Age of Loss (Seven Stories, 237 pp., $25.95), deBuys chronicles missions he joined with the Nomads Clinic, an international group of doctors, nurses and healers, to deliver care to shepherds and farmers in the Himalayas. Traveling among villages with names that tinkle like wind chimes \\u2014 Ringmo and Shimen \\u2014 the Nomads set up tent clinics, dispensing amoxicillin and ibuprofen, and washing the feet of walk-ins before examining them for more serious maladies. As the Nomads knelt to soap, scrub and rinse neglected toenails with \\u201cblade-like edges and ice-pick points,\\u201d they knew their one-time ministrations could not cure the patients long-term.\", \"Yet deBuys argues for the value of \\u201ccare over cure,\\u201d not only for underserved communities but for the imperiled planet, an approach he calls \\u201cEarthcare.\\u201d Among his close-ups of Nomads and Tibetans, he interleaves portraits of scientists whose discoveries \\u2014 natural selection, continental drift, plate tectonics \\u2014 diagnosed the earth. \\u201cIf we soar to an altitude of 30,000 feet, or higher still, and look at Earth from the emptiness of space, as Darwin implicitly taught us to do, the view changes,\\u201d he writes.\", \"In the village of Shey, deBuys learned that a craze for a profitable local fungus had upset the tranquillity of the gompa. Called yartsa gunbu, it springs from the heads of doomed Tibetan caterpillars, and looks like a tiny brown banana. Cecily Wong and Dylan Thuras, the steel-stomached authors of the travelogue-cum-dining manual GASTRO OBSCURA: A Food Adventurer\\u2019s Guide (Workman, 438 pp., $42.50), not only know about this grotesque foodstuff, they know where you can go in Las Vegas to eat it, sprinkled on soup ($688 a bowl). They write, \\u201cThis tasteless parasitic fungus is one of the priciest substances on earth \\u2014 more than truffles, more than gold.\\u201d\", \"Their lavishly photographed volume, more eye-opening than mouthwatering, slakes (and often quells) the armchair gourmand\\u2019s appetite. Combing 120 nations and all the continents (including Antarctica \\u2014 apparently China\\u2019s base station is worth snowmobiling to), they have produced a cabinet of culinary curiosities. Some plausibly edible trophies include crunchy Iraqi khirret taffy made from cattail pollen, North Dakotan \\u201cpitchfork fondue\\u201d (whole steaks plunged into a bucket of hot oil), a spit-roasted Lithuanian cake that looks like a massive pastry pine cone and a Portuguese pudding made with bacon fat.\", \"\\u201cNot everything in \\u2018Gastro Obscura\\u2019 should be eaten,\\u201d the authors caution. \\u201cSome of the foods in this book are a wonder to learn about, but do harm to partake in.\\u201d Among those, presumably, is the \\u201cLSD nightmare fish,\\u201d otherwise known as salema porgy, which flourishes in the Mediterranean near Cyprus, and contains \\u201ca toxin known to trigger several days of vivid, sometimes frightening hallucinations.\\u201d\", \"Lockdown has forced writers to extraordinary measures to keep wanderlust alive. Last year, David Damrosch, chair of Harvard\\u2019s comparative literature department, set out on a lecture tour inspired by Jules Verne\\u2019s globe-trotting Phileas Fogg. His plan was to drop into cultural capitals across England, Europe, Asia and the Americas, and, in each city, deliver a talk on five classic works of literature, old and new, that shaped its identity \\u2014 80 books in all.\", \"He had made it as far as Muscat when the pandemic hit. Undeterred, he made his home library his flight deck. For 16 weeks, he invited readers to travel with him through distant cities and eras, with books as their boarding passes and Damrosch as their pilot. Those weeks form the chapters of AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 BOOKS (Penguin Press, 412 pp., $30). It\\u2019s a kind of GPS raisonn\\u00e9 that lets readers chart a meaningful path through milestones of literature on multiple continents. Many of the authors in Damrosch\\u2019s carry-on are familiar: Dickens and Dante, Margaret Atwood and Marguerite Duras, James Baldwin and James Joyce, Jhumpa Lahiri and Marjane Satrapi. But some of his most potent souvenirs have no known author, like the ancient Egyptian love poem he chose for Cairo: \\u201cAs Amun lives, I come to you/my loincloth on my shoulder.\\u201d\", \"In August 2018, after his junior year at Princeton, Jordan Salama walked through the hills of La Gloria, a town inland from Colombia\\u2019s Magdalena River, with a schoolteacher named Luis Soriano, who was delivering books to rural children by donkey and teaching them to read. Soriano called his equipage \\u201cBiblioburro.\\u201d When Salama saw a cloud of yellow butterflies fluttering ahead of Soriano, he instantly thought of the butterflies that appear in Garc\\u00eda M\\u00e1rquez\\u2019s \\u201cOne Hundred Years of Solitude,\\u201d heralding the arrival of a character who represents, as Salama puts it, \\u201call that there is to love in a world of struggle.\\u201d This is only one of the stories that gleam like river stones in his richly observed debut, EVERY DAY THE RIVER CHANGES: Four Weeks Down the Magdalena (Catapult, 217 pp., $26).\", \"Garc\\u00eda M\\u00e1rquez eulogized the Magdalena in \\u201cLove in the Time of Cholera\\u201d as \\u201can illusion of memory.\\u201d But Salama knew that 80 percent of Colombians live in the river\\u2019s basin. Was it possible for 38 million people to inhabit an illusion? To find out, he sought to know the people who live beside the river: children, fishermen, canoe-carvers, boat captains, ecologists, managers of defunct hotels and, above all, old people \\u201cwho could look at the river and see all that it once was.\\u201d In Mompox, a faded colonial town, a double for Garc\\u00eda M\\u00e1rquez\\u2019s Macondo, he met Sim\\u00f3n Villanueva, an 89-year-old goldsmith who sat at his porch workbench every day, crafting delicate filigree fish and flowers, though he had no customers. Sim\\u00f3n could remember the 1940s and \\u201950s, when elegant steamboat travelers bought his jewelry after docking at Mompox. But he had no regrets. \\u201cI live in love with my work,\\u201d he said.\", \"For more than half a century, guerrilla and paramilitary warfare, along with drug violence, made many of Colombia\\u2019s jungles, mountains, ports and villages perilous for travelers and residents alike. But two years before Salama\\u2019s journey, a peace agreement was signed between the guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the Colombian government. (Even so, Princeton made him sign waivers clearing the university of responsibility, should he be killed by \\u201cdrug traffickers or paramilitary militias.\\u201d) In the oil town of Barrancabermeja, Salama boarded a rickety high-speed ferry called a chalupa, and took a choppy, six-hour ride past the San Lucas Mountains, where guerrillas still rule over coca plantations and illegal gold mines. In the mid-Magdalena Valley, he hopped a motobalinera \\u2014 a wooden platform on train wheels pulled by motorcycle down a railroad track \\u2014 to reach a town called Estaci\\u00f3n Cocorn\\u00e1. There he took a dawn motorboat ride down a stretch of river clogged with hippopotamuses, descendants of ones Pablo Escobar imported to his hacienda between Medell\\u00edn and Bogot\\u00e1.\", \"In the rising sun, Salama saw \\u201cturtles slipping off logs and red howler monkeys stirring in the guadua trees.\\u201d And then, just as the boat\\u2019s engine stalled, choked by sediment on the river bottom, a hippo emerged, \\u201cits thick teeth dripping with saliva.\\u201d Salama screamed, and the engine roared back to life. Before his journey, Salama writes, \\u201cI envied those travelers who wrote of the Magdalena\\u2019s golden dawns on steamboat mornings, of the cacophony of monkeys and insects in its trees and the cries of manatees in its waters. Because these were things I knew I would never see.\\u201d What he saw instead replaces nostalgia with the still-mythic power of Colombia\\u2019s actual, evolving present.\", \"The great ships that carried passengers between the continents in the first half of the 20th century are wreathed in romance and risk. Think of the oceangoing cardsharp Jean Harrington, who bewitches a na\\u00efve millionaire bachelor in the screwball comedy \\u201cThe Lady Eve.\\u201d \\u201cThey say a moonlit deck is a woman\\u2019s business office,\\u201d she murmurs as he swoons. And you can hardly avoid thinking of the Titanic. But almost nobody thinks of the women who made their careers on those \\u201cfloating palaces.\\u201d They worked as stewardesses, matrons, nurses, lady\\u2019s maids and \\u201cconductresses\\u201d in an age when job opportunities for women on land were typically limited, badly paid and unexciting. In her bracing history MAIDEN VOYAGES: Magnificent Ocean Liners and the Women Who Traveled and Worked Aboard Them (St. Martin\\u2019s, 354 pp., $28.99), Si\\u00e2n Evans relays the adventures of these groundbreakers, who loved their seaborne freedom so much that when their vessels hit icebergs, or were torpedoed in wartime, they didn\\u2019t change jobs, they changed ships.\", \"Violet Jessop worked as a stewardess on the White Star line\\u2019s flagship, the Olympic, then on its sister ship, the Titanic (she survived), and, later, on a hospital ship that sank after being exploded by German ordnance during World War I. Even so, Jessop returned to the waves, sailing on Prohibition-era \\u201cbooze cruises,\\u201d which she looked down on, resenting the duty of assisting passengers to \\u201cconceal their \\u2018hooch\\u2019\\u201d; and, after World War II, on the Andes liner, which ran between Britain and Brazil.\", \"Another heroine, Victoria Drummond, Britain\\u2019s first female marine engineer, saved her ship, the Bonita, when a German warplane bombed it in the mid-Atlantic in 1941. For half an hour, she held down the throttle with one hand, using the other to coax the engines to 12\\u00bd knots. The German plane continued to strafe the deck, but her maneuvers enabled the ship to avoid a direct hit. Drummond had needed similar tenacity just to get her job. Engineering was considered a strictly male preserve, and the British Board of Trade flunked her entry exam 31 times. Undeterred, she took Panama\\u2019s test, which was gender-blind, and passed at once.\", \"Evans intersperses these eventful histories with splashes of color about better-known female passengers who used the sea as a magic carpet to self-invention \\u2014 from Josephine Baker, Tallulah Bankhead and Lady Astor to \\u2026 Mary Anne MacLeod. In 1930, MacLeod, the daughter of a poor Scottish crofter on the Outer Hebrides, sailed from Glasgow to New York on the SS Transylvania, seeking domestic work. Instead, she found a husband, Frederick Christ Trump, and went on to become the mother of an American president. Romance and risk, indeed.\", \"On July 2, 1849, the audacious, idealistic Gen. Giuseppe Garibaldi marched his 4,000-man volunteer army out of Rome. The city had just been taken by the French, but Garibaldi refused to surrender. For the next four weeks, pursued by the forces of France, Austria, Spain, Naples and the pope, he led his ragtag battalions on a zigzagging 400-mile retreat, somehow eluding his foes. In the wee hours of Aug. 2, having reached the Adriatic, he made his escape. He would return in 1860 at the head of another army; and this time, he would win.\", \"In 2019, the great Italophile Tim Parks and his partner, Eleonora Gallitelli, repeated Garibaldi\\u2019s retreat \\u2014 intending to match his route step for step. There was an obstacle, Parks explains in his utterly transporting chronicle THE HERO\\u2019S WAY: Walking With Garibaldi From Rome to Ravenna (Norton, 369 pp., $27.95): \\u201cThough we know where Garibaldi went, we don\\u2019t know how he got there.\\u201d A pioneer of information warfare, the Italian general not only faked out his enemies, but he kept his own officers in the dark, sending them to requisition lodging and food in villages where the troops were not going, in order to mislead enemy spies.\", \"Luckily, many of Garibaldi\\u2019s contemporaries kept journals and correspondence that recorded the army\\u2019s actual trajectory. Parks draws liberally on the diary of the general\\u2019s Bavarian aide-de-camp, Gustav von Hoffstetter, who comes to feel like a voluble third member of Parks\\u2019s time-traveling expedition. Each chapter covers a successive day of the retreat, interweaving the exploits and setbacks of 1849 with ordeals on the same day, in the same places, 170 years later.\", \"Leaving Rome at 4:30 a.m. through the same arch Garibaldi took, Parks and his partner head for Tivoli, 20 miles east. In 1849, Rome was surrounded by inviting countryside; Hoffstetter compared the woods and waterfalls around Tivoli to the \\u201csacred groves of ancient times.\\u201d In 2019, this leg of the journey edged the autostrada, and the hikers had to skirt \\u201cbroken glass, road kill, syringes and plastic\\u201d for hours before they could set foot on the \\u201ctorrid plain\\u201d that led to their destination.\", \"Near Poggio Mirteto, however, where Garibaldi\\u2019s band camped on July 5, 1849, Parks sees orchards of peaches \\u201cglowing luminous red under stormy skies.\\u201d In Torrita di Siena, whose bakers produced rations of bread for the troops two weeks later, he surveys freshly harvested fields of wheat and barley, \\u201cthe lines of the mowing still etched across the soft slopes.\\u201d\", \"In August, the couple completed their itinerary; six months later, Italy went into lockdown for Covid-19. For a year, Parks had thought about political freedom; now he thought of simple freedom of movement. Looking at his photos of crowded streets, packed restaurants and open roads, he felt \\u201ca sense of wonder,\\u201d at how quickly a country can change.\"]","href_hash":"9a0686ed542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9a0686ed542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}},
