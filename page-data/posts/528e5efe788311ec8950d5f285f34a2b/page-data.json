PCR tests have been used for years to diagnose a variety of diseases and uses a molecular testing\\u00a0process\\u00a0in which a nasal or throat swab is mixed with chemical ingredients to needed to create copies of the genetic material that makes up the virus.\\u00a0\", \"In rapid antigen tests, samples from patient swabs are mixed with a\\u00a0buffer, a liquid that helps the virus travel across a strip coated with antibodies that bind to specific proteins \\u2014 known as antigens \\u2014 common to many variants of the virus.\\u00a0Similar to\\u00a0a positive over-the-counter pregnancy test, the strip appears as a colored line if it detects the antigen.\", \"The researchers, which studied 1,000 children and teens under the age of 17, found the rapid antigen test sensitivity rate was 92.7%, meaning it identified cases the PCR test also identified. Its specificity rate was 98%.\", \"All of the children were given the BinaxNOW rapid antigen test manufactured by Abbott Laboratories at Baltimore Convention Center in 2021, when the Delta variant was prevalent, according to the study.\", \"There was only a slight difference in the sensitivity of the test for children with symptoms and without symptoms. The study has not been peer-reviewed, but it suggests that rapid tests can be confidently used.\", \"The study also found that the test's ability to determine a negative, known as a negative predictive value or NPV, was also high \\u2013 99.2% of those who tested negative for COVID-19 were actually negative. \\\"The near 100% NPVs for both symptomatic and asymptomatic children, including some children with recent high-risk exposures, should provide providers and parents with assurance that a negative rapid antigen test with this product can be trusted,\\\" the researchers write.\", \"Because schools can be disrupted by COVID-19 cases and vaccines are not yet available for children 5 and under, \\\"testing may improve the ability for children to remain in in-person activities, minimizing absences from school and extracurriculars,\\\" the researchers say. \\\"Highly accurate rapid antigen tests may be vital to containing future COVID-19 waves while mitigating detrimental effects.\\\"\", \"CBS News has reached out to a researcher in the study for more information and is awaiting response.\\u00a0\", \"Alexander Tin contributed to this report.\", \"Caitlin O'Kane is a digital content producer covering trending stories for CBS News and its good news brand, The Uplift.\"]","href_hash":"528e5efe788311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"528e5efe788311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
