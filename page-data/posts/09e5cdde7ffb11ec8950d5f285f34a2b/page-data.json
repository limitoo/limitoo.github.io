But researchers say something that turns on for a minute is highly unusual.\", \"The team is working to understand more.\", \"The object was first discovered by Curtin University Honours student Tyrone O'Doherty in a region of the Western Australian outback known as the Murchison Widefield Array, using a telescope and a new technique he had developed.\", \"O'Doherty was part of a team led by astrophysicist Dr Natasha Hurley-Walker, from the Curtin University node of the International Centre for Radio Astronomy Research (ICRAR).\", \"\\\"[It] was appearing and disappearing over a few hours during our observations,\\\" she was quoted as saying in a media release from ICRAR that documented the discovery.\", \"\\\"That was completely unexpected.

However, much of the discovery remains a mystery.\", \"\\\"More detections will tell astronomers whether this was a rare one-off event or a vast new population we'd never noticed before,\\\" Dr Hurley-Walker said. \\\"I'm looking forward to understanding this object and then extending the search to find more.\\\"\", \"-BBC\"]","href_hash":"09e5cdde7ffb11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"09e5cdde7ffb11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
