Louise Erdrich spent the time writing a novel. Specifically, she wrote a ghost story, \\u201cThe Sentence,\\u201d and the further you read in this engaging account of what happens after a loyal bookstore patron dies and her ghost refuses to leave the store she loved, the more apt Erdrich\\u2019s choice of genre seems. Set mostly in the year 2020, which itself came to seem haunted as Covid spread and the deaths piled up, this novel restores to us all the messy detail of an almost amnesiac time when, worn down and exhausted, \\u201cwe skied weightlessly through the days as if they were a landscape of repeating features.\\u201d\", \"At first the ghost of Flora, an elderly customer who dropped dead, haunts only Tookie, the narrator, a middle-aged Native American working in a Minneapolis bookstore that specializes in works about Indigenous people. In life, Flora was a pest who with annoying self-righteousness never stopped wanting to be a Native American. Tookie remembers \\u201chow once she had told me I couldn\\u2019t talk about being \\u2018Indian\\u2019 or \\u2018Aboriginal,\\u2019 but should always say \\u2018Indigenous.\\u2019 I\\u2019d told her that I\\u2019d call myself whatever I wanted and to get the hell out of my face.\\u201d\", \"What Tookie calls herself is another matter. Because Flora is not the first of Tookie\\u2019s ghosts. She is haunted by her mother\\u2019s addiction and death, haunted by a misspent youth and her time in prison, and though she is resilient, she is haunted by the idea that there is something flawed about her \\u2014 that if there is a way to screw something up, she\\u2019ll find it.\", \"More than anything, Tookie craves normal. Normal is not her default. Normal is her ideal, where she may \\u201clive as a person with a regular life. A job with regular hours after which I come home to a regular husband.\\u201d All she wants is for her life \\u201cto continue in its precious routine. And so it has. However. Order tends toward disorder. Chaos stalks our feeble efforts. One has ever to be on guard.\\u201d Flora is Tookie\\u2019s first warning that being on guard may not be enough.\", \"Because at first she alone feels the ghost\\u2019s presence, Tookie questions her own sanity. Is she merely projecting? Or if she\\u2019s sane and there is a ghost, then why is the ghost targeting her? Tookie is in the midst of puzzling all this out when the pandemic arrives and the world turns upside down. And then George Floyd is murdered in the same city where Tookie lives and works, and a persistent ghost is suddenly only one of her problems.\", \"By the end of the novel, the idea of ghosts has expanded to include those parts of the past that refuse to die because we have refused to process them. \\u201cLike every state in our country, Minnesota began with blood dispossession and enslavement,\\u201d Tookie says. \\u201cSometimes I think our state\\u2019s beginning years haunt everything: the city\\u2019s attempts to graft progressive ideas onto its racist origins, the fact that we can\\u2019t undo history but are forced to either confront it or repeat it.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe Sentence\\u201d covers a lot of ground, from ghosts to the joys and trials of bookselling to the lives of Native Americans and inmates doing hard time. And that\\u2019s just the first half of the story, before the pandemic, before George Floyd. The novel gets a little baggy after a while, as Erdrich struggles to juggle multiple plotlines. But the virtues here so outweigh the flaws that to complain seems almost like ingratitude.\", \"\\u201cThe Sentence\\u201d is rife with passages that stop you cold, particularly when Erdrich, who won a Pulitzer Prize for her previous novel, \\u201cThe Night Watchman,\\u201d articulates those stray, blindsiding moments that made 2020 not only tragic but also so downright weird and unsettling.\", \"Just as life veers into lockdown, Tookie is riding home with her husband, Chinese takeout perfuming the car as they drive down the dark, \\u201cempty, peaceful streets\\u201d of Minneapolis. \\u201cWhy can\\u2019t it always be this way?\\u201d Tookie asks her husband.\", \"\\u201cHe gave me an odd look. I turned aside. The empty street swished beneath the tires. Perhaps I should have been ashamed. Why was it that I felt this was the world I\\u2019d always waited for?\\u201d\", \"Toward the end, she sums up our collective nightmare as the time when \\u201cwe straggled through a year that sometimes seemed like the beginning of the end. A slow tornado. I want to forget this year, but I\\u2019m also afraid I won\\u2019t remember this year.\\u201d There is something wonderfully comforting in the precise recollection of such furtive memories, like someone quietly opening a door onto a little slice of clarity.\", \"Set in a bookstore, narrated by a bookseller whose former life in prison was turned around when she discovered books and began to read \\u201cwith murderous attention,\\u201d \\u201cThe Sentence\\u201d testifies repeatedly to the power books possess to heal us and, yes, to change our lives. It may be that, as Tookie argues, \\u201cbooks contain everything worth knowing except what ultimately matters.\\u201d But that harsh judgment notwithstanding, there are books, like this one, that while they may not resolve the mysteries of the human heart, go a long way toward shedding light on our predicaments. In the case of \\u201cThe Sentence,\\u201d that\\u2019s plenty.\"]","href_hash":"393944c2414511eca54adbac1943da9b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"393944c2414511eca54adbac1943da9b"}},
