Moehringer.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-15T18:10:02.000Z","content":"[\"Every kid should have an Uncle Charlie. That\\u2019s the sentiment voiced by J.R. Maguire early in \\u201cThe Tender Bar,\\u201d and it\\u2019s hard to disagree. By the end of the movie, directed by George Clooney and adapted from J.R. Moehringer\\u2019s 2005 memoir, it\\u2019s clear that what J.R. means, most simply, is that every child should have an adult who loves them unconditionally: someone who listens, gives good advice and answers hard questions as truthfully as possible.\", \"In movie terms, it doesn\\u2019t hurt if that person is also Ben Affleck. Uncle Charlie, a Long Island bartender who is loyal to his friends and family and devoted to his car (a beautiful blue-green Cadillac convertible), is like an older, 1980s-vintage version of Chuckie Sullivan, Affleck\\u2019s character in \\u201cGood Will Hunting.\\u201d He likes to drink, smoke, crack wise and philosophize, but his calling in life is to be there for a vulnerable, promising young man when no one else will.\", \"Affleck is very good at this. He doesn\\u2019t oversell either Charlie\\u2019s cool or his warmth, and doesn\\u2019t let the audience or J.R. in on all of Charlie\\u2019s secrets. We see him mostly through the boy\\u2019s eyes, as a heroic, benevolent, somewhat mysterious figure, but Affleck\\u2019s weary, stoical demeanor suggests dimensions beyond what a child might comprehend. (The young J.R. is played by Daniel Ranieri; grown-up, retrospective narration is provided by the voice of Ron Livingston.) The nuances of Affleck\\u2019s performance help ground the movie in small, specific emotions. Its understatement, though, can be a limitation as well as a virtue.\", \"The obvious thing to say about Charlie is that he\\u2019s a surrogate father. J.R.\\u2019s real dad (Max Martini) is an unreliable, largely absent, self-absorbed disc jockey. He sometimes calls, rarely shows up and lives mainly as a voice on the radio. (\\u201cThe Voice\\u201d is his professional alias.) \\u201cThe Tender Bar\\u201d begins when J.R. and his mother, Dorothy (Lily Rabe), move into her parents\\u2019 rambling house in Manhasset. Dorothy\\u2019s brother Charlie lives there too, as do a bunch of other cousins and siblings.\", \"We don\\u2019t learn too much about them. The focus is on J.R.\\u2019s relationships with Dorothy and Charlie, and on his search for The Voice. Grandpa, in the splendidly cranky person of Christopher Lloyd, shows up now and again to swear or break wind, and once in a while to show a little tenderness.\", \"J.R.\\u2019s second home is the bar, called the Dickens, where Charlie pours drinks for the regulars and dispenses what he calls \\u201cmale science\\u201d to his nephew. In keeping with the joint\\u2019s literary name (there\\u2019s a fading likeness of Charles Dickens painted on the side of the building), Charlie keeps books as well as bottles on the shelves. He encourages J.R. to read, and then to write.\", \"Dorothy is determined to send her son to Harvard or Yale, and the second half of the movie \\u2014 with Tye Sheridan as an older J.R. \\u2014 follows him to New Haven, where he makes a friend (Rhenzy Feliz) and falls in love (with a classmate played by Briana Middleton). He also puts aside his mother\\u2019s dreams of law school to concentrate on writing. He first envisions a novel about his youth, but everyone tells him that \\u201cthe publishing world is turning toward memoir.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s a nice little joke, though perhaps a bit anachronistic for 1986. The real J.R. Moehringer spent years as a journalist at The Los Angeles Times before writing \\u201cThe Tender Bar,\\u201d but Clooney and the screenwriter, William Monahan, are true to the spirit of the book rather than faithful to the letter. Instead of forcing J.R.\\u2019s messy life into a neat plot, the movie skips across his life like a flat stone on the surface of a pond.\", \"Which is also to say that it doesn\\u2019t go as deep as it might. Potentially dramatic material \\u2014 paternal abandonment, maternal illness, unrequited love, alcoholism \\u2014 is treated with a circumspection that can feel coy and cautious rather than subtle.\", \"But when Affleck is around \\u2014 especially with young Ranieri as his wingman and pupil \\u2014 the laid-back vibe of \\u201cThe Tender Bar\\u201d achieves its full measure of weary, wised-up charm. It\\u2019s not the kind of movie that will knock you out, but it won\\u2019t leave you with a headache and a dry mouth, either. It\\u2019s a generous pour and a mellow buzz.\"]","href_hash":"239340cc5dd211ec84bb43b1a1f665f0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"239340cc5dd211ec84bb43b1a1f665f0"}},
