He was still shooting the stars decades later.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-20T13:47:23.000Z","content":"[\"Mick Rock, whose striking images of David Bowie, Lou Reed, Debbie Harry, as well as more recent stars like Theophilus London and Snoop Dogg, made him one of rock and pop\\u2019s most acclaimed photographers, died on Thursday at a hospital in Staten Island. He was 72.\", \"His family posted news of his death on his website. No cause was given.\", \"Mr. Rock was often called \\u201cthe man who shot the \\u201970s\\u201d because of his photographs that captured the rock stars of that flamboyant decade, both in his native England and in New York. He lived the rock lifestyle as he was photographing it, becoming part of the scene inhabited by Mr. Bowie, Mr. Reed and the rest.\", \"\\u201cI was drawn to the good, the bad and the wicked,\\u201d he said in \\u201cShot! The Psycho-Spiritual Mantra of Rock,\\u201d a 2016 documentary about him directed by Barney Clay.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve lived a very wild life because I\\u2019ve been hanging out with a lot of very wild people,\\u201d he added. \\u201cAnd the camera just kind of led me by the nose.\\u201d\", \"Some of his photographs adorned memorable album covers: the bleached-out shot of Mr. Reed on \\u201cTransformer\\u201d (1972); the eerily dark image of the members of Queen on \\u201cQueen II\\u201d (1974), later recreated in the much-viewed music video for \\u201cBohemian Rhapsody.\\u201d Others captured stars in poses \\u2014 Mr. Bowie looking androgynously enigmatic; Ms. Harry, of the group Blondie, looking like Marilyn Monroe. And still others caught performances or unguarded moments.\", \"\\u201cI am not in the business of documenting or revealing personalities,\\u201d Mr. Rock wrote in a diary early in his career. \\u201cI am in the business of freezing shadows and bottling auras.\\u201d\", \"Befriending the stars of the day, which included taking the same drugs they were often taking, gave him the sort of access that most photographers can only dream of. As Mr. Reed put it in the introduction to one of Mr. Rock\\u2019s books, \\u201cMick Rock was so much a part of things that it was quite natural to have him snapping away and think of him as invisible.\\u201d\", \"But Mr. Rock wasn\\u2019t limited to one era. He continued photographing rockers, rappers and other music personalities for the next 40 years, even after a heart attack in 1996 led him to embrace a quieter lifestyle. (\\u201cAll I am is a retired degenerate,\\u201d he joked in a 2011 interview with The New York Times.) In recent decades he had photographed Snoop Dogg, Lady Gaga, Rufus Wainwright and many others.\", \"\\u201cIt was barely over a year ago I sat with you by the window listening to Bowie stories,\\u201d Miley Cyrus wrote on Twitter after learning of his death. \\u201cIt was my honor.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Rock often said he was fated to have the career he had because of his name: He was born Michael David Rock on Nov. 21, 1948, in London to David and Joan (Gibbs) Rock.\", \"He graduated from Caius College, Cambridge, where he studied modern languages. While a student there, as he put it in the documentary, \\u201cphotography wandered idly into my life.\\u201d He was hanging out in a friend\\u2019s room with a companion, and the friend had left a 35-milimeter camera lying about (which turned out to have no film in it, though Mr. Rock didn\\u2019t realize that).\", \"\\u201cI was with a young lady in a state of \\u2014 I think chemical inebriation is probably the best way of putting it,\\u201d he told The Daily Telegraph of Britain in 2010, \\u201cwhen I started snapping away. I was just playing, but there was something about it that I really liked.\\u201d\", \"So he got himself his own camera, with film, and began taking pictures of friends and friends\\u2019 friends. One friend, whom he had met early in his time at Cambridge, was Syd Barrett of the band Pink Floyd. Through Mr. Barrett he came to know other musicians, and a few not only asked him to photograph them but also paid him.\", \"\\u201cI suddenly realized you could make money from this,\\u201d Mr. Rock wrote in \\u201cClassic Queen,\\u201d his 2007 book about his work with that band. \\u201cThat was terrific: much better than getting a \\u2018real\\u2019 job.\\u201d\", \"He started writing for various publications and illustrating his articles with his own photographs. One musician he came to know was Mr. Bowie, and one particular picture he took, in 1972, was career-making. Onstage at the Oxford Town Hall, Mr. Bowie pantomimed performing fellatio on the guitar of one of his musicians, Mick Ronson, as he played. Mr. Rock\\u2019s photograph of the moment turned up in Melody Maker magazine.\", \"\\u201cThis was that shot that put my name on the map,\\u201d Mr. Rock wrote in the Queen book. \\u201cSuddenly I was in demand, and my camera was clearly speaking louder than my words.\\u201d\", \"Famed shots of Mr. Reed and Iggy Pop came along about the same time.\", \"\\u201cI took those when Lou and Iggy were relatively unknown, unless you were really, really hip,\\u201d he told The Telegraph, \\u201cbut somehow those shots seemed to have defined them forever.\\u201d\", \"Soon his reputation was such that Queen came calling.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t really know their music, but, when they played me their album, I said, \\u2018Wow! Ziggy Stardust meets Led Zeppelin!\\u2019 and that seemed to seal the deal,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Rock moved to New York in 1977 and became immersed in the turbulent scene there that included Blondie, the Ramones and other performers.\\u201cI needed a new edge, and I found it in New York in spades,\\u201d he told The Sunday Herald of Scotland in 1995.\", \"\\u201cOver the years Mick Rock has made history with all the musicians and rock stars that he has immortalized,\\u201d Ms. Harry wrote in the introduction to Mr. Rock\\u2019s book \\u201cDebbie Harry and Blondie: Picture This\\u201d (2019). \\u201cA good photo session is sometimes as good as sex. You leave feeling well massaged, satisfied and a little bit outside yourself.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Rock\\u2019s marriage to the photographer Sheila Rock ended in divorce. He is survived by his wife, Pati Rock, whom he married in 1997; a daughter, Nathalie Rock; and five siblings, Carol, Jacqueline, Don, Angela and Laura.\", \"Mr. Rock\\u2019s work was featured in various exhibitions. In the Blondie book, he lamented that he\\u2019d made such an impact as a rock photographer that it restricted him in some ways.\", \"\\u201cLike a hit record to a rock \\u2019n\\u2019 roller, the downside is that a great image, besides defining the subject, can limit what others call on the photographer to do,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t mind shooting the occasional politician or actor (or even a gangster or two), but that\\u2019s not how art directors or magazines view me.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"516832ec4a0811ecb15d41856fb59c40"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"516832ec4a0811ecb15d41856fb59c40"}},
