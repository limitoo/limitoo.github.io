Zients, the administration\\u2019s pandemic response coordinator, said that the government will deliver several million doses to doctors\\u2019 offices, pharmacies, health clinics and other sites within the next couple of days. But he appeared to dampen expectations that all the pending orders that states have placed for pediatric vaccine would be filled right away.\", \"\\u201cWe are planning on some vaccinations towards the end of this week,\\u201d he said, adding that the government will deliver a total of 15 million doses \\u201cacross the next week or so.\\u201d\", \"There are 28 million children aged 5 to 11 in the United States. Surveys indicate that only about one in three parents will permit their children to be vaccinated immediately.\", \"Mr. Zients, speaking at a White House briefing, said the government began shipping doses within minutes of the Food and Drug Administration\\u2019s authorization Friday afternoon of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine on an emergency basis for young children. \\u201cWe began the process of moving 15 million doses from Pfizer\\u2019s freezers and facilities to distribution centers,\\u201d he said, where they will be shipped to vaccination sites.\", \"\\u201cMore doses will be packed and shipped and delivered each and every day over the next week,\\u201d he said.\", \"The pediatric rollout depends on recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which sets vaccine policy. The agency often follows recommendations from its advisory panel of experts, which is meeting Tuesday on the subject of Pfizer doses for children 5 to 11 years old.\", \"Mr. Zients said setbacks to Moderna\\u2019s hopes to offer its vaccine to adolescents and younger children would not affect the vaccination campaign, because the government was counting only on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for those age groups. \\u201cWe\\u2019re in great shape on supply,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe have more than enough vaccine for every child 5 to 11.\\u201d\", \"Over the weekend, Moderna announced that it would delay asking for regulatory authorization of a half-dose of its vaccine for children in that age group. The company decided to pull back after regulators informed the company that they may not complete their review this year of Moderna\\u2019s earlier request to offer a full dose of its vaccine to adolescents 12 to 17r.\", \"Regulators cited concerns about the risks of myocarditis, a condition involving inflammation of the heart muscle.\"]","href_hash":"ad88407e3b4b11ecbb12000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ad88407e3b4b11ecbb12000017025a03"}},
