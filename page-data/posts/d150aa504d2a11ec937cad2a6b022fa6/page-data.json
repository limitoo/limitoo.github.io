Since then the rumor mills have been spinning. Some saw her accepting a guest lecturer role at an American university, while others hoped she would take on a senior role at the European Union or another international institution.\", \"What was clear from the outset: She wanted to leave office on her own terms, in her own time. \\u201cI want at some point to find the right time to quit politics,\\u201d she told Herlinde Koelbl, a German photographer, in 1998. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to be a half-dead wreck.\\u201d\", \"Two years ago, when she experienced fits of uncontrolled trembling, it appeared as if she would not make it to the end of her term. Yet if Ms. Merkel has fallen short of Bismarck in longevity in office, she shared with him the moniker of \\u201ciron chancellor\\u201d and pulled through.\", \"At 67, Ms. Merkel is still young enough to take on other challenges, but has been characteristically tight-lipped about her retirement plans. When pressed, Ms. Merkel brushed away the idea that she even had the time to think about it, insisting that only when she was out of office would she be able to begin focusing on her next step.\", \"\\u201cI think every government day has to be taken equally seriously and always looked at with the same alert eye,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI believe in governing in the midst of life and as sensibly as possible, and to do so until the last day of my responsibility.\\u201d\", \"With that last day drawing ever closer, she has begun to speak more freely about a need she feels to pause long enough to rest and contemplate what truly interests her. In an interview given this summer after receiving an honorary doctorate \\u2014 her 18th \\u2014 from Johns Hopkins University, the chancellor gave the first real insight into how she envisions her future.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ll try to read something, then my eyes will fall shut because I\\u2019m tired, then I\\u2019ll sleep a little bit, and then we\\u2019ll see,\\u201d she said.\", \"But when Parliament approved a staff of nine full-time employees for her office as former chancellor, many were quick to point out that it was a formidable number for someone with plans to lie on the couch reading books.\", \"\\u201cI would like in this next phase of life to consider very carefully what do I want to do,\\u201d she said in September.\", \"\\u201cDo I want to write? Do I want to speak? Do I want to wander around? Do I want to be at home? Do I want to travel the world?\\u201d Ms. Merkel said. \\u201cFor that reason, I have decided that at first I will do nothing, and I will see what happens.
