There wasn\\u2019t so much a procession as a series of struts down the runway for the television cameras. The broadcast was filmed over three days and edited to give the impression of a seamless three-hour program.\", \"This year, with the city reporting that more than 80 percent of adults are fully vaccinated, the parade is expected to return with all its helium-filled pomp and corporate-branded holiday cheer \\u2014 with an asterisk: children under 12 will not be allowed to participate in the parade itself. They will, however, be allowed as spectators along the two-and-a-half-mile parade route, as well as at the ceremonial inflation of the balloons on Wednesday afternoon around the American Museum of Natural History.\", \"Their absence is slightly strange in an event whose stars include Pikachu, SpongeBob SquarePants and Papa Smurf. Typically, it would be children riding along on a float that looks like it is made of Legos, or accompanying the Green Giant\\u2019s float, dressed as flowers and pumpkins.\", \"But this year, the 95th Macy\\u2019s parade is not quite typical. Macy\\u2019s announced in September that everyone participating in the parade must be vaccinated. It wasn\\u2019t until about three weeks before Thanksgiving that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention formally endorsed Pfizer-BioNTech\\u2019s coronavirus vaccine for children age 5 to 11. Attending the parade as a spectator has no vaccination requirement, and children under 12 years old can view the balloon inflation on the Upper West Side if they go with a fully vaccinated adult.\", \"In order to plan for costumes and other logistics, parade organizers needed to know early on who would be riding on the floats, said Will Coss, the event\\u2019s executive producer.\", \"\\u201cWe had to make some decisions well in advance of our parade day to ensure that the health and safety of all participants was delivered upon,\\u201d Coss said. \\u201cUnfortunately, we weren\\u2019t able to have that specific contingent of young children.\\u201d\", \"In years past, that contingent usually consisted of less than 200 children, some as young as 7, who are connected to Macy\\u2019s employees and parade volunteers, Coss said.\", \"Two years ago, some of those children waved from the back of a bejeweled hot-pink carriage pulled by a Tyrannosaurus rex or danced energetically on a Sour Patch Kids-branded float, while others stared shyly at the crowd as Ciara performed alongside Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.\", \"This year, the young people waving from floats will be vaccinated tweens and teens \\u2014 so viewers can perhaps expect less unadulterated joy and wide-eyed wonder \\u2014 but the parade\\u2019s organizers maintain that the change is minor in a year when the live program and meticulously choreographed fanfare is back.\", \"\\u201cThat same youthful spirit is still very much a part of this year\\u2019s show,\\u201d said Wesley Whatley, the parade\\u2019s creative producer.\", \"After last year, its ranks have been mostly restored.\", \"About 6,500 people will be working on the parade, less than the normal 8,000, but far more than last year\\u2019s 960. The number of giant balloons is back up to 15 and the floats up to 28, roughly what it was two years ago, after a reduction last year. And 10 marching bands, many of which were restricted from traveling from their high schools and colleges located across the country last time, will fill the streets.\", \"It has been a long wait for the musicians, who were told in spring 2019 that they would be performing in Manhattan.\", \"\\u201cWe jumped and screamed and hugged each other,\\u201d said Zoe Huntoon, a mellophonist from Frankfort, Ill., who was a sophomore at the time. \\u201cThen in 2020, it slowly hit us that it wasn\\u2019t going to be possible.\\u201d\", \"But this week, Huntoon, who is now a senior, and about 200 bandmates will board charter buses for the long drive to New York City.\", \"Although the majority of the procession and performances will be live, part of the show will be pretaped, as it is every year, Whatley said.\", \"Thanksgiving morning, Broadway performers will be back on 34th Street to entertain an audience with songs from \\u201cSix,\\u201d \\u201cMoulin Rouge! The Musical\\u201d and \\u201cWicked.\\u201d Last year, these performances were filmed without cheering, bundled-up fans.\", \"The televised parade, starting at 9 a.m. on NBC, Telemundo and Peacock, will feature the Rockettes, Carrie Underwood, Mickey Guyton, Kristin Chenoweth, Jon Batiste and Nelly. (Unless they\\u2019re singing, performers must be masked.)\", \"Ballet Hisp\\u00e1nico\\u2019s School of Dance, the Young People\\u2019s Chorus of NYC and a group of competitive rope jumpers who will make the entire parade route their playground will be among the younger participants.\", \"One contingent of parade volunteers is particularly giddy about the relaxed restrictions: the handlers who shepherd balloons like the 43-foot-long Snoopy down Sixth Avenue. Last year most of that work was done by a formation of utility vehicles.\", \"One balloon volunteer, Teresa Kruszewski, got involved in the parade in 2008, after someone she met on jury duty helped her secure the role. Kruszewski, 60, after missing last year\\u2019s parade, is returning as a pilot of a new balloon, the title character of \\u201cAda Twist, Scientist,\\u201d a Netflix children\\u2019s show. Kruszewski said that at first she worried that her year off had left her rusty, but when she went to the Citi Field parking lot to test the balloon, her muscle memory kicked in.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s like riding a bicycle,\\u201d she said. \\u201cOnce I get behind the balloon and I\\u2019ve got handlers around me and whistles are blowing, it comes back.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"cfb0d22a4bbc11ec8fdeab451454f86b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cfb0d22a4bbc11ec8fdeab451454f86b"}},
