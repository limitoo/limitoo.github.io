The ensuing record of her wide-ranging movement throughout the world \\u2014 at least 140,000 negatives of landscapes, common folk, celebrities, children, animals and garbage \\u2014 has more range and rigor than any influencer\\u2019s. Despite recurring selfies, some in noirish shadow, Maier was in fact the anti-influencer: Her startling compositions were not only largely unshared and unsponsored during her lifetime \\u2014 she made abortive attempts to start a postcard business \\u2014 but almost entirely unseen.\", \"Their posthumous airing, and an ecstatic popular reception that began on the internet, has kept critics, lawyers and scholars busy.\", \"A biography by Pamela Bannos published in 2017 suggested that the ragtag assortment of men who had unearthed and to some extent profited from Maier\\u2019s photographs \\u2014 buying and selling them at auction, organizing popular exhibits and producing books and documentaries about her \\u2014 were presumptuous to frame her story, let alone lay claim to it. (Maier is thought to have been deeply suspicious of men, as a general rule; she warned her young charges against sitting on their laps, and once so forcefully \\u201cdecked\\u201d a guy trying to be helpful that he got a concussion).\", \"A new biography, by Ann Marks, a former corporate executive with a background in analyzing \\u201ceveryday people,\\u201d rejects this idea of exploitation. The book seeks to gently restore credit to those who put the photographer on the map \\u2014 principally John Maloof, a real estate agent-turned-artist whose film \\u201cFinding Vivian Maier\\u201d was nominated for an Oscar. (Maloof seems to have emerged the intellectual-property victor from a nightmarish thicket of international copyright issues and competing advocates.) Marks believes Maier would have been pleased to be on that map, despite a life of obscurity that at times veered into squalor.\", \"The difference of perspective may be moot. Just as you can\\u2019t libel the dead, you can\\u2019t ascribe intent to them; especially if, like Maier, they didn\\u2019t leave a will or outline their wishes to any intimates or have intimates.\", \"Even those who employed Maier as a governess (\\u201cnanny\\u201d seems altogether too soft a term for her) and gave her rooms in their homes considered her strange, if not downright sinister in retrospect. Dodgy with references, occasionally resorting to corporal punishment and dragging minors around as she shot subjects such as naked mannequins and sheep marching to their slaughter in questionable parts of town, Maier would never be hired in our era of background checks, hyperscheduled activities and five-star reviews on care.com. (She was exceptionally loving to three boys in Chicago, the Gensburgs; they reciprocated by helping her in old age, eventually arranging to scatter her ashes in a forest preserve where they\\u2019d once picked wild strawberries. She also babysat briefly for Phil Donahue after his divorce, recording his broadcasts and later framing an article \\u201cfeaturing his proclamation that women were underestimated in television.\\u201d)\", \"Parachuting into families with a spit-spot on-the-double briskness, Maier was inevitably compared to Mary Poppins or, zooming around on her moped, the Wicked Witch of the West. I flashed also on Ole Golly in \\u201cHarriet the Spy,\\u201d with her somewhat mannish affect, militaristic walk in clunky shoes and straight talk. Maier often costumed and characterized herself as a sort of spy.\", \"Marks, with access and permissions that Maloof had denied to Bannos, tells Maier\\u2019s life with the intimacy of a scrapbook \\u2014 and, at various points, the sanctioned intrusiveness of a detective log. Readers see Maier\\u2019s Liberty print blouses arrayed \\u2014 she was an avid and discriminating shopper \\u2014 and one of those big shoes measured. They learn of her odd grooming habits: washing her hair with vinegar and coating her face in Vaseline. And of her collections: Once her stack of newspapers, a major preoccupation, grew so heavy it buckled the floorboards.\", \"Such hoarding, Marks convincingly argues, was a sign of mental illness, a likely solution to the supposed mystery of Maier\\u2019s extreme privacy that should be fully aired and destigmatized, rather than shrugged off as mere eccentricity. \\u201cIf Vivian had battled cancer, or even lesser physical afflictions like tremors, arthritis or lazy eye, these conditions would not have been dismissed as irrelevant to her photography,\\u201d she writes. \\u201cShe would likely have been lauded for her fortitude in moving forward in the face of disability.\\u201d\", \"Eager to follow this theory throughout the Maier bloodline, Marks sometimes displays the indiscrimination of that relative who has gone giddy on ancestry websites, tracing lineage until it blurs beyond recognition. \\u201cFor me, no detail is inconsequential,\\u201d she writes in her introduction. Uh-oh, I thought. There and in multiple appendices describing research methods and roadblocks, she shows her work maybe a little overmuch.\", \"But the bulk of \\u201cVivian Maier Developed\\u201d is a thorough, fascinating overview of an artist working for art\\u2019s sake, and a forceful case for further exposure rather than discretion in the name of kid-gloved pity.\", \"To add my own appendix: Marks\\u2019s selection of photographs, artifacts and documents is judicious and satisfying, but the book\\u2019s format reduces many to small squares. Bring a magnifying glass.\"]","href_hash":"d5b64f9a5dc511ecacdb476e3c46e28b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d5b64f9a5dc511ecacdb476e3c46e28b"}},
