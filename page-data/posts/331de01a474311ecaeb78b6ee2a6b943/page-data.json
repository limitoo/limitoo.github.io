provide reliable power and end energy insecurity.\\u00a0\", \"Karrina Nolan from community group Original Power said the network's goal was to bring clean, reliable and affordable power to communities

communities, even though they were early adopters of solar through the Bushlight program in remote areas of the Northern Territory, Western Australia and Queensland, which ran between 2002 and 2013.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We're not seeing enough involvement in medium to large-scale enterprises, certainly the large-scale export projects at the moment,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"There's really only one of those that's jointly being done with an Aboriginal community.\\\"\", \"\\\"But what we're hoping to see by developing the network is that those companies and businesses get on board and actually do role model best practice on\\u00a0what it could really look like to make sure that benefits are shared by all, and certainly by our communities.\\\"\", \"Nearly a quarter of Australia's energy generation comes from renewable energy, such as\\u00a0solar and wind power, and the country is expected to surpass the target of 50 per cent renewable energy by 2030.\", \"<img

remote and regional Indigenous communities is substandard and overcrowded because of a lack of maintenance by authorities and disputes over funding between governments.\\u00a0\", \"Norman Jupurrurla Frank, a senior Warumungu traditional owner from Tennant Creek, led a pilot project to integrate rooftop solar with pre-payment meters in town camps.\", \"\\\"For too long, our communities have been forced to rely on dirty, expensive and unreliable power that is undermining our people's health and wellbeing,\\\" he said.\", \"Marlinja in the Northern Territory's Barkly Tablelands\\u00a0is home to 60 people and has set up a community solar project which has slashed power costs for the community centre from $150 a week to about $40 a month.\\u00a0\", \"A recent report from the Australian Housing and Urban Research Institute found global warming and inadequate housing were putting Indigenous communities in remote and regional areas at risk.\\u00a0\", \"The report called for the construction of housing that could better withstand climate change and be regularly maintained by authorities.\", \"Ms Nolan said poor housing and unreliable\\u00a0electricity\\u00a0contributed to poor health in remote and regional communities, and having access to cheap and reliable power would improve living standards.\", \"Ms Nolan said\\u00a0temperatures reached more than 40 degrees Celsius in some places in the outback, with diesel often used to power homes.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We're hearing stories where people are choosing\\u00a0to cool one room and then taking it in turns\\u00a0and sleeping in that

the community of Santa Teresa (Ltyentye Apurte), south of Alice Springs, and a solar project at Borroloola, home to more than 1,300 people in the Gulf of Carpentaria.\\u00a0\", \"He said while the potential for clean energy projects in communities was large, there were many barriers to entry.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It is hard,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"There's a lot of potential issues and requirements both on the legislative, regulatory, commercial side of things.\", \"\\\"But by having the right supporters in a coming together as equals to making the project work, we can
