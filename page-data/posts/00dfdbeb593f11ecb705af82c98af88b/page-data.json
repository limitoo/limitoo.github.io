A new home was set to be built on the plot, which is owned by Chris Segroves.\", \"\\\"We are grateful for the individuals who ceased work immediately and contacted us,\\\" said Nez Perce Tribe spokeswoman Kayeloni Scott. \\\"We also appreciate the property owners for doing the right thing by working with us so we can properly handle our ancestors' remains to ensure there is no further disturbance. Surveying and monitoring of the site will continue, to help us learn more about the findings.\\\"\", \"Numerous people have visited the site to examine the remains, including Asotin County police chief Monte Renzelman, Nez Perce Tribal officials, and a Washington state archeologist. After examining the dig site, authorities determined that the land was a tribal burial spot. According to Renzelman, grave sites were placed on hills so deceased relatives will spiritually be reintroduced into nature and water.\", \"Segroves wanted to build his dream home on the property that he purchased for $30,000 almost four years ago. However, he is putting it on hold in order to respect the sacred land.\", \"\\\"At this point, I don't think I'll ever get to build there for two reasons,\\\" he told The Lewiston Tribune. \\\"No. 1, having an archaeologist on site at all times during construction is cost-prohibitive. No. 2, and even more important, I have a moral compass. And morally, I think it's wrong to desecrate that property further, knowing there's an Indian burial site under there.\\\"\", \"The property is currently being secured by Nez Perce tribal members. Due to the 1990 Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, it is likely that the remains and items found at the gravesite will be returned to them. Whether the land itself will be sold to the tribe remains unknown.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948840/asotin-burial-site.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Police vehicles sit overlooking a dig site December 8, 2021, where Native American ancestral human remains were found.</div>\", \"The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act says descendants of those interred must be consulted and have a say in exactly how the graves are handled. Native American cultural items, such as human remains, funerary objects, and sacred objects, are supposed to be returned to their descendants.\", \"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939250/petition-moundville-human-remains-artifacts.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Work was halted at a Washington construction site after diggers realized the land they were working on was a burial site for a nearby Native American tribe.
