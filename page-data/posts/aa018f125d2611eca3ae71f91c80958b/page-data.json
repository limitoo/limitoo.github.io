In the region comprising New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, the percentage of Omicron infections had already reached 13.1 percent.\", \"While early evidence has begun to emerge about Omicron, it remains unclear how often cases lead to hospitalizations or deaths. The variant seems to be able to partially dodge the body\\u2019s immune defenses, but it has yet to be determined to what degree vaccination and prior infection may safeguard individuals from severe disease.\", \"To track variants, the C.D.C. uses a national genomic surveillance system that collects samples, as well as genetic sequences generated by commercial laboratories, academic laboratories, and state and local public health laboratories.\", \"The U.S. system was relatively slow to pick up on cases of the variant, perhaps in part because of travel patterns or restrictive U.S. entrance rules. But the system is also constrained by blind spots and delays.\", \"Last week, the C.D.C. reported that of the 43 known infections detected in the United States in the first eight days of December, 34 of the patients, or 79 percent, had been fully vaccinated when they first started showing symptoms or tested positive. Only about a third of the 43 people had traveled internationally in the two weeks before diagnosis, indicating some level of community spread of the variant.\", \"The fight against Omicron may require the federal government to replenish funding for the response, the secretary of health and human services, Xavier Becerra, suggested on Tuesday. Mr. Becerra told reporters that about $10 billion was left of the $50 billion Congress had allocated for testing.\", \"In Europe, health officials have warned of a spike in Omicron cases. According to estimates on Monday, cases of the variant in Denmark, which is similar to the United States in terms of vaccination rates and average age, were doubling every two days.\", \"Danish researchers expected to see not just an increase in the share of infections caused by Omicron, but an overall jump in cases because of the variant\\u2019s spread. Denmark was recording around 6,000 cases a day, and the researchers estimated that Omicron would increase that number to 10,000 by the end of the week, with cases continuing to rise.\", \"Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the director general of the World Health Organization, said in a news briefing on Tuesday that \\u201cOmicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Tedros and senior W.H.O. officials cautioned against underestimating the variant. \\u201cEven if Omicron causes less severe cases, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cVaccines alone will not get any country out of this crisis,\\u201d he added, emphasizing the need to apply proven measures of wearing masks, practicing social distancing, ventilating rooms and hand hygiene.\", \"Still, the priority must be to vaccinate the unvaccinated, Dr. Tedros said. \\u201cIf we end inequity, we end the pandemic. If we allow inequity to continue, we allow the pandemic to continue.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"aa018f125d2611eca3ae71f91c80958b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"aa018f125d2611eca3ae71f91c80958b"}},
