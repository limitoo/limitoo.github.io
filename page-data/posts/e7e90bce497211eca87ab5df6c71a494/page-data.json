An ex-C.I.A. Plutonium Killer who can peel off his own face! A battalion of kid ninjas! The promise of Dolemite himself, Rudy Ray Moore, as an insult-spewing police detective!\", \"In 1984, audiences had never seen anything like the low-budget epic \\u201cNew York Ninja,\\u201d in which the Taiwanese kung fu performer John Liu directs himself as a high-kicking sound man who avenges his wife\\u2019s death.\", \"And despite lurid \\u201cComing Soon\\u201d ads in the trade magazines (\\u201cWHEN YOU BACK A TIGER INTO A CORNER HE COMES OUT FIGHTING!\\u201d), audiences never got to see it in 1985. Or 1986. Or the ensuing three decades.\", \"\\u201cIt was one of those things that was on my r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 for years, but I never thought it would see the light of day,\\u201d the special effects artist Carl Morano said of \\u201cNew York Ninja,\\u201d which vanished after its distribution company, 21st Century, went bankrupt and sold off its assets.\", \"All that remained was a set of film reels with six to eight hours of footage. No audio. No credits or call sheets. No storyboards. Not even a script to explain who exactly the New York Ninja was fighting and why, let alone how the roller skates came into play.\", \"Those reels eventually ended up in the vaults of the film distribution company Vinegar Syndrome, known for such disreputable titles as \\u201cChristmas Evil\\u201d and \\u201cDon\\u2019t Answer the Phone!\\u201d It took a two-year resuscitation effort for Vinegar Syndrome to bring \\u201cNew York Ninja\\u201d to life. The result came out on Blu-ray earlier this month after a few raucously received appearances at genre film festivals, and a theatrical release is slated for early 2022.\", \"Much of the reconstruction fell to Kurtis M. Spieler, who is credited as the new iteration\\u2019s \\u201cre-director\\u201d and editor. \\u201cWhat I tried to do was make the most coherent thing I could with the footage I had,\\u201d said Spieler, who spent evenings and weekends piecing together a workable edit and then writing a new script to match his cut.\", \"This took some effort given the source material. \\u201cThey had zero resources,\\u201d said Morano, who spent most of his estimated special effects budget of $100 on the Plutonium Killer\\u2019s melting face. \\u201cDifferent people showed up on different days. We\\u2019d meet every morning at the Howard Johnson\\u2019s where John was staying and then take a van to the location.\\u201d\", \"When he arrived in New York, John Liu was already a cult figure in martial arts circles, known for his high kicks and his collaborations with the fight choreographer Yuen Woo-ping, who went on to work on films like \\u201cThe Matrix\\u201d and \\u201cCrouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.\\u201d\", \"The huge popularity of Bruce Lee put a ceiling on just how familiar audiences were with Liu\\u2019s name, according to the film historian Chris Poggiali, a co-author of the new book \\u201cThese Fists Break Bricks: How Kung Fu Movies Swept America and Changed the World.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAt the time, the studios were doing anything they could to tie in with Bruce Lee,\\u201d Poggiali said. This meant changing Liu\\u2019s name on the posters. For example, the poster for the film \\u201cHammerfist\\u201d billed Liu as Marty Lee.\", \"By the time shooting on \\u201cNew York Ninja\\u201d began in late 1984, one actor no longer attached to the project (if he ever really was in the first place) was Rudy Ray Moore. But Morano\\u2019s original shooting script, the only one known to exist, still alluded to \\u201cDetective Dolemite,\\u201d which made Morano wonder just how scrupulously the script was being followed. \\u201cMy feeling is that they just kind of winged it,\\u201d he said.\", \"Poggiali described the final result as \\u201cvery different from a lot of the other ninja movies at the time.\\u201d As Liu\\u2019s character frequently slips away from his co-workers to put on his New York Ninja garb and then returns as if nothing had happened, \\u201cit\\u2019s more like a crime-fighting superhero film, like Clark Kent and Superman.\\u201d\", \"The names of most of the original cast and crew are lost to time, and Spieler said Vinegar Syndrome tried to find Liu but wasn\\u2019t able to. This gave Spieler the chance to start fresh with the audio, commissioning a synth-heavy retro score by the Detroit band Voyag3r and fielding a murderer\\u2019s row of genre-film stalwarts to dub the actors.\", \"Joining the likes of Don Wilson, a.k.a. the Dragon, and Cynthia Rothrock in the recording booth was the 1980s scream queen Linnea Quigley (\\u201cReturn of the Living Dead\\u201d), who here dubs the voice of the frequently imperiled TV reporter Randi Rydell. \\u201cThey said, \\u2018You\\u2019re playing the reporter, do what you want with it,\\u2019\\u201d Quigley said. \\u201cIt seemed like fun \\u2014 which is wild because I think they kind of wanted it to be serious.\\u201d\", \"Or, if not exactly serious, at least not too campy. \\u201cWe\\u2019re playing this straight,\\u201d said Spieler, who compared the final result to \\u201cMiami Connection,\\u201d \\u201cSamurai Cop\\u201d and other so-bad-they\\u2019re-kind-of-extraordinary titles. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not trying to play up the silliness because it already comes through naturally.\\u201d\", \"While it\\u2019s impossible to know for sure, Spieler said he suspects Liu wasn\\u2019t able to complete filming before the production shut down. \\u201cThe ending doesn\\u2019t feel like it was ever finished,\\u201d he said. Vinegar Syndrome originally floated the possibility of filming new scenes, but Spieler was intent on working with what they had.\", \"\\u201cI asked myself, \\u2018If my job was to have been an editor in the 1980s, what would I have done?\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cThis was how I could maintain the spirit of the original.\\u201d (In fact, he didn\\u2019t let himself look at Morano\\u2019s original shooting script until he completed his own version.)\", \"Spieler believes that the intervening decades may actually have done \\u201cNew York Ninja\\u201d some favors. \\u201cWe knew it was campy and silly and over the top,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut we also knew it can be appreciated from a modern-day sensibility in a different way.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s finding its right audience now.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e7e90bce497211eca87ab5df6c71a494"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e7e90bce497211eca87ab5df6c71a494"}},
