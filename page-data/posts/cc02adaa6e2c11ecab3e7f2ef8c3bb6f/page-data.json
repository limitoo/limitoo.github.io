The couple fell in love with Montclair. \\u201cBut it was a little out of our price range,\\u201d said Mr. Peters, 43, who works in the back office of a bank. Then they found Bloomfield, just next door.\", \"In the summer of 2019, the couple, who now have two children, bought a four-bedroom colonial in the northern part of the township for $430,000.

Bloomfield also recently converted a former industrial site into Lion Gate Park, a project that Councilwoman Wartyna L. Davis, the dean of the college of arts, humanities and social sciences at William Paterson University, is especially proud of.\", \"\\u201cIt was a significant undertaking to turn it from brown to green,\\u201d Dr. Davis said of the park, which includes a soccer field, a playground and four acres of wetlands.\", \"Karine Limor, 34, and Rafael Martinez, 43, moved to Bloomfield in the fall of 2018. Ms. Limor, the director of sales for a baby-products company, and Mr. Martinez, a real estate investor, had lived in Manhattan for six years, enjoying the culture, restaurants and convenience of being able to walk nearly everywhere. But when they had their first child, they decided they needed more space and began working with Suburban Jungle, a company that helps urban dwellers find the right fit in suburbia.\", \"The couple paid $540,000 for a three-bedroom colonial near Brookdale Park, the shops and restaurants on Broad Street, and the Watchung Plaza shopping area, in Montclair. They like the blend of suburban green space and urban walkability.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m a big walker,\\u201d Ms. Limor said. \\u201cThere are definitely conveniences in Bloomfield that you can walk to that you might not be able to walk to in a quieter suburb.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Limor and Mr. Martinez, now the parents of two boys, have met other young families who moved to Bloomfield recently. \\u201cWe liked the idea that it was up and coming,\\u201d Ms. Limor said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s been very easy to find other like-minded people to connect with as a family.\\u201d\", \"Bloomfield is roughly rectangular, sandwiched between Montclair and Glen Ridge to the west, Nutley and Belleville to the east, Clifton to the north and East Orange to the south.

Amy Owens, an agent with Keller Williams Realty in Montclair, said that the Brookdale and Oakview neighborhoods are especially popular with young families, because of the highly rated elementary schools.\", \"As in other suburban areas, demand for housing shot up in Bloomfield during the pandemic as buyers looked to leave cities, leading to multiple offers on many homes, said Oneida Mendez-Laws, an agent with Coldwell Banker, in Montclair.\", \"According to the Garden State Multiple Listing Service, in the 12 months ending on Dec. 15, 2021, 516 single-family homes sold at a median price of $440,000; during the previous 12 months, 447 single-family homes sold at a median of $391,000.\", \"A recent check of the multiple listing service found 49 properties on the market, from a studio condominium listed for $110,000 to a renovated three-bedroom colonial listed for $600,000.\", \"The average monthly rent for a one-bedroom in an older building is about $1,500; in a new building, an apartment of a similar size might rent for $2,000 a month, said Michael Sisto, of Sisto Realty in Bloomfield.\", \"Bloomfield has three shopping districts: Bloomfield Center, in the southern part of the township, on Bloomfield Avenue; Broad Street; and upper Broad Street.

The canal allowed for the transport of coal from Pennsylvania and iron ore from northwestern New Jersey, but ultimately it could not compete with the railroads, and was shut down in the early 20th century. In Bloomfield, parts of the Garden State Parkway and John F. Kennedy Drive were built on the bed of the old canal, said Jean Kuras, the president of the township\\u2019s Historical Society.
