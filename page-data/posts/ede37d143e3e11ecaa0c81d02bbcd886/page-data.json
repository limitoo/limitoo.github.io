DeSantis also went to 9-2 from 5-1 for the GOP nomination since those results.\", \"\\\"Both RDS and Trump have been popular with bettors. We've shortened De Santis from +1100 (11-1) to +800 (8-1); and +500 (5-1) to +450 (9-2) for the nomination. Trump stays at +250 (5-2) and -110 (10-11) respectively, although his odds have already shortened considerably in recent weeks, along with Republicans to be the winning party,\\\" Krishnamurty added.\", \"\\\"The evidence from Virginia and elsewhere strongly signaled a change from the Trump era, which would favor a candidate with similar policies, but without his toxicity.\", \"\\\"Trump was a lightning rod, who particularly alienated women. GOP results in Virginia during his era as leader were abysmal. On Tuesday, we saw a big shift back towards the GOP from white women \\u2013 a critical demographic. The message was clear \\u2013 without Trump on the ballot or in office, the Democrat coalition withers and Republican chances across the country improve.\\\"\", \"He added that many white women switched back to voting Republican for the first time since 2016.\", \"BetOnline also saw Glenn Youngkin, who won the governorship in Virginia from Democrat Terry McAuliffe in an upset, enter the White House odds race at 50-1 for the Presidency and 30-1 to get nominated.\", \"Joe Biden went to 4-1 from 7-2 and Kamala Harris went to 6-1 from 11-2. Since the Virginia defeats, the two are now tied at 8-5 for the Democrat nomination for 2024.\", \"\\\"Does it give Republicans a path to win nationally? Sure. But it doesn't \\\"hurt Trump's chances\\\" because DeSantis probably won't challenge Trump if he runs in the primary anyway. If Trump wants the nomination, it's his and nobody can stop him,\\\" Kovler said.\", \"\\\"So no, it doesn't boost DeSantis because DeSantis (or anyone who isn't Trump) always looked better than Trump in a general. But I don't think VA makes it more likely that Trump sits out 2024, and that's the only relevant question.\\\"\", \"Neither Trump nor DeSantis have formally announced a run in 2024, but the former has repeatedly hinted he will, and Florida Representative Matt Gaetz has hinted DeSantis will throw his hat in the ring.\", \"But he agrees with Koyler that DeSantis doesn't have the name, recognition or the same appeal as Trump and does not command the same influence over the GOP.\", \"\\\"DeSantis' presidential ambitions largely depend on what Trump decides to do in 2024,\\\" he added.\", \"\\\"DeSantis' biggest challenge in 2024 is to go through the GOP primaries, he might announce policies and views to prove his credentials among Trump supporters and his legal battles with the Biden administration will definitely help him.\", \"\\\"However, DeSantis might not gain enough traction to beat Trump but he has better chances in the national elections if he passes the Trump's test in the GOP primaries.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926978/ron-desantis-hialeah.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">HIALEAH, FLORIDA - AUGUST 05: Florida Gov.
