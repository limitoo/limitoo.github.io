To Mr. Sorel, then, apologies in advance: I can only assume that seeing this byline will be pretty anticlimactic \\u2014 or perhaps his habitual modesty has rubbed off. But if there\\u2019s one thing I learned from his memoir, it\\u2019s that the guy\\u2019s a mensch, and one with a solid regard for jobbers on a deadline.\", \"Sorel, 92, has indeed had a profusely illustrated life. Over the past six decades, you\\u2019ve probably seen his many New Yorker and Harper\\u2019s Magazine covers, his political satire in The Nation, his cartoons in New York magazine, his caricatures in Vanity Fair. Perhaps you\\u2019re familiar with Ramparts magazine\\u2019s bestiaries, which lampooned the political follies of the 1960s, or \\u201cSorel\\u2019s Unfamiliar Quotations\\u201d in The Atlantic. Maybe one of his many books? And all that\\u2019s to say nothing of the thousands of sketches and commissions and album covers and illustrations that animate the margins of a working artist\\u2019s career. Of course there\\u2019s no question your chances of recognizing his distinctively wavy drawing style are a lot better if you\\u2019re what he\\u2019d call an \\u201cOld Lefty.\\u201d\", \"Sorel came into the world as Edward Schwartz in 1929. He adored his smart and beautiful Romanian-born mother; meanwhile his father, who\\u2019d immigrated from Poland, was \\u201cstupid, insensitive, grouchy, meanspirited, faultfinding, and a racist.\\u201d Their working-class Bronx neighborhood was pretty evenly divided between card-carrying Communists, Communist sympathizers and New Deal Democrats; Aunt Nettie, the self-anointed family intellectual, \\u201cfelt compelled, when there was a band playing at one of her sisters\\u2019 weddings, to use her long scarf to do a solo dance in the manner of Isadora Duncan \\u2014 another fervent supporter of the Communist regime in Russia.\\u201d His world was shtetl-tiny but filled with opportunity; provincial but progressive; jaundiced, but optimistic \\u2014 \\u201ca city where being Jewish, far from setting you apart, was a reminder of just how ordinary you were.\\u201d\", \"This was a depression-era New York of Third Avenue Els, Friday night chicken soup, Saturday matinees and \\u2014 lest we get nostalgic \\u2014 no penicillin. When 7-year-old Edward contracted double pneumonia, it meant an at-home oxygen tent and a year\\u2019s convalescence, during which time he started drawing on shirt cardboards. He attended art classes funded by Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney, before moving to a public arts high school in Harlem and the Cooper Union, both of which emphasized abstraction and modernism with an unrelenting zeal that nearly killed the young man\\u2019s enthusiasm for figurative drawing. After a few lackluster design jobs in an art world still reeling from Cold War paranoia, Sorel \\u2014 who had swapped his despised father\\u2019s common surname for that of a romantic Stendhal protagonist \\u2014 co-founded Push Pin Studios with his art school classmates Milton Glaser and Seymour Chwast.\", \"In Sorel\\u2019s telling, he was the least talented of the three \\u2014 and certainly the least dedicated undergrad \\u2014 but despite his self-deprecation, Sorel\\u2019s success is a testament as much to his multifaceted skill as to his persistence and luck. While he claims he didn\\u2019t pull his full weight at Push Pin \\u2014 and always dreamed of doing political work in the mold of the cartoonist Jules Feiffer \\u2014 in fact his time peddling the studio\\u2019s portfolio serves the reader well; the nuts-and-bolts descriptions of midcentury Madison Avenue are one of the book\\u2019s pleasures.\", \"From the time he went freelance, in 1956, Sorel worked more or less steadily \\u2014 often for financially precarious left-wing publications of the era: The Realist, Monocle, Ramparts. (At a time when, it must be remembered, he could get a Manhattan apartment for $28 a month \\u2014 albeit with a shared bathroom \\u2014 and take dates to the all-night chess parlor in Times Square.) Increasingly, he was developing a reputation as an irreverent \\u2014 and sometimes lacerating \\u2014 satirist of the nation\\u2019s sacred cows.\", \"Indeed, in a sense, \\u201cProfusely Illustrated\\u201d is really an easygoing history of the left at a particular moment, with Sorel moving like a haimish Forrest Gump through print media New York. He was at Bill Golden\\u2019s gray-flannel-suited PBS and the cool-cat Push Pin. When Esquire published Gay Talese\\u2019s \\u201cFrank Sinatra Has a Cold,\\u201d it was Sorel\\u2019s portrait \\u2014 also done without the subject\\u2019s cooperation \\u2014 that graced the cover. An early contributor to The National Lampoon, Sorel would illustrate the iconic Truman Capote cover for Clay Felker\\u2019s New York (Sorel briefly acted as its art director) and be a mainstay of the golden-age Village Voice. Victor Navasky \\u2014 a colleague since the 1950s \\u2014 brought him on board at The Nation. Later, he joined Tina Brown\\u2019s early-90s New Yorker, and then Graydon Carter\\u2019s Vanity Fair. Do I even need to say that he did the mural at the Waverly Inn?\", \"In between, of course, he had a life: four children, and two marriages \\u2014 the second a lasting personal and professional partnership. There was a long stint in the country, a return to the still-uncharted TriBeCa, and many, many lifelong friendships. (While the chapter devoted to Sorel\\u2019s friends is doubtless a labor of love, I\\u2019m not sure how much interest it holds to readers outside of his own circle.) The book\\u2019s not just a who\\u2019s who of liberal luminaries, but of cartoon-world royalty as well. I can pay the author no greater compliment than to say that, through it all, he does not come off as an operator.\", \"As should perhaps be obvious, the memoir is overtly political. Indeed, Sorel makes a point of giving a highly opinionated \\u201cexpos\\u00e9\\u201d of every administration in his lifetime. (A choice he later writes he\\u2019s \\u201cbeginning to regret,\\u201d given the research involved.) But really, nothing provides so vivid a record of the events he lived through as the cartoons, caricatures and drawings that do, yes, profusely illustrate every chapter. He\\u2019s not proud of all of them (\\u201cawfully heavy-handed,\\u201d he writes of a 1970 cartoon of Richard Nixon that got him in hot water; \\u201coverworked,\\u201d he says of another), but together they concisely convey the passions and pieties of their moment.\", \"Despite the deceptive neatness inherent in any retrospective glance backward, Sorel\\u2019s has not been an uncomplicated life. There are personal challenges, professional setbacks, regrets, controversy. There\\u2019s the loss of his beloved wife, Nancy. By his own account, this is a book about the failures of 13 administrations. And yet, the takeaway\\u2019s not a grim one.\", \"In an introductory author\\u2019s note, Sorel states his aim: \\u201cto save a few of my drawings from the oblivion that awaits all protest art, and almost all magazine illustrations.\\u201d He does more than this. Warm, affectionate, often angry but never cruel, cynical but not without a certain faith in people, Sorel gives us a life \\u2014 and a world \\u2014 in pictures. It made me very happy.\"]","href_hash":"169ee1224d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"169ee1224d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}},
