English for not liking George Orwell\\u2019s \\u201c1984.\\u201d I found the prose stilted (I vaguely recall an invective I launched against his similes) and the overall project didactic. Of all things to be didactic about, I said \\u2014 totalitarianism. How original \\u2014 not liking totalitarianism; I mean it just sounds bad. My teacher was aghast (she loved his similes). I had to be transferred to another class.\", \"Born on the other side of the Iron Curtain, the translator Bela Shayevich outright refused to read \\u201c1984\\u201d: \\u201cI had no interest in a book routinely deployed as a vaccine against communism.

Shayevich describes his style as emblematic of a \\u201cjagged and ruthlessly fat-free early Soviet aesthetic.\\u201d Though there have been numerous excellent translations of \\u201cWe,\\u201d Shayevich\\u2019s best preserves the experimental qualities of Zamyatin\\u2019s writing. She subtly conveys from the Russian the jumpy texture that the narrator\\u2019s voice takes on as he becomes a kind of jammed robot, ecstatically malfunctioning as he falls in love with a sleek femme fatale, a rogue individualist with a \\u201cname\\u201d to match: I-330.\", \"Set 1,000 years in the future, \\u201cWe\\u201d transports us to an authoritarian society called the One State that is governed by technological efficiency and an enforced suppression of individual identity. The novel is the diary of D-503 (citizens of the One State have numbers, not names), lead engineer of a spaceship called Integral set to travel into outer space to rescue \\u201cunfamiliar beings on alien planets who may yet live in savage states of freedom.\\u201d The residents of the One State don identical gray uniforms and listen to machine-generated music: \\u201cA musicometer,\\u201d D-503 tells us, \\u201ccan produce three sonatas an hour.\\u201d Monogamy is a vestige of ancient times (a.k.a. our times), and sex is arranged through a bureaucratic system involving pink tickets. \\u201cHe\\u2019s registered to me today,\\u201d interjects D-503\\u2019s girlfriend O-90 when she sees him chatting with another woman.\", \"A mathematician who hates imaginary numbers \\u2014 \\u201cGet \\u221a\\u22121 out of me!\\u201d he shrieks \\u2014 D-503 is the golden boy of the One State. He gazes longingly at the Integral, comparing its machinations to a ballet. \\u201cWhy is this dance beautiful?\\u201d he writes. \\u201cAnswer: because the movements are unfree. The deeper teaching of this dance lies in its absolute aesthetic bondage, its ideal unfreedom.\\u201d But the steely blades of the Integral soon find a romantic rival for D-503\\u2019s affections. One day, during one of the state-sanctioned Personal Hours, he takes a walk and meets I-330, a sharp-toothed woman with angular eyebrows, whose resemblance to a right angle seems to do it for him. He describes her as \\u201cslender, sharp, supple and stubborn, like a whip.\\u201d\", \"Before long, I-330 sneaks him away to the House of Antiquity, a museum of the before-times filled with ephemera of the ancients: books, candleholders, \\u201crows of furnishings in epileptic disarray, impossible to incorporate into any equation.\\u201d Later, she surprises him by wearing something other than the prescribed uniform, \\u201can ancient dress \\u2014 paper thin, saffron yellow: one thousand times more evil than if she\\u2019d been wearing nothing at all.\\u201d Before long it is clear: I-330 is a rebel, part of a secret group looking to topple the One State and bring back the days of alcohol, Scriabin and poetry not sanctioned by the State.\", \"Zamyatin was born in Lebedyan, Russia, in 1884. He joined the Bolshevik Party early on and took part in the Revolution of 1905, for which he was imprisoned and exiled to the provinces. After a stint in England (overseeing the construction of icebreakers), he returned to Russia in 1917 and witnessed the October Revolution unfold up close. Euphoric, he threw himself headlong into party work, sitting on the boards of literary organizations and offering lectures on the craft of fiction. He also became a significant literary critic, and his greatest pet peeve was the influence of Taylorism \\u2014 a 19th-century American philosophy of efficiency \\u2014 on a new movement of worker-writers called Proletkult. Their leading adherent was the writer Alexander Bogdanov, whose novel \\u201cRed Star\\u201d (1908) was about a scientist and revolutionary who travels to Mars and finds a perfect socialist society predicated on technology and ruthless efficiency. The Proletkult writers were also too eager, Zamyatin thought, to play the part of court poets, and for an increasingly censorious court at that. In a 1921 essay titled \\u201cI Am Afraid\\u201d (translated by Mirra Ginsburg), he wrote: \\u201cTrue literature can exist only where it is created, not by diligent and trustworthy officials, but by madmen, hermits, heretics, dreamers, rebels and skeptics.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe\\u201d has the distinction of being the first novel officially banned in the Soviet Union. Glavlit, the Soviet organ responsible for literary censorship, was established in 1922, just a year after Zamyatin completed work on the book. Just before it was outlawed, he sent a copy abroad, and thus \\u201cWe\\u201d was first published not in Russian but in English (in a translation by Gregory Zilboorg), by the U.S. publisher Dutton in 1924. Trouble came when excerpts appeared in Russian in an \\u00e9migr\\u00e9 journal in Prague. To protect Zamyatin, the editor insisted they were retranslations and not \\u2014 importantly \\u2014 from an original version the author might have furnished for circulation abroad after the ban. The Soviets erred on the side of suspicion, as was their wont. Zamyatin quickly fell out of favor and was unable to get any of his new work published. In 1931, he appealed directly to Stalin to let him move abroad, with the condition that he would return \\u201cas soon as it becomes possible in Russia to serve great ideas in literature without cringing before little men.\\u201d It was arranged for Zamyatin and his wife to move to Paris, where he lived until he died of a heart attack in 1937.\", \"In 1946, George Orwell got his hands on the English translation of \\u201cWe\\u201d and reviewed it in The Tribune. \\u201cSo far as I can judge,\\u201d he wrote, \\u201cit is not a book of the first order, but it is certainly an unusual one.\\u201d Orwell\\u2019s enthusiasm led to a timely reissue in 1952. In the aftermath of Nazi Germany and Stalinist Russia, \\u201cWe\\u201d struck readers as eerily prophetic. The same is true now. In a foreword to this new edition, Margaret Atwood writes: \\u201cStalin\\u2019s show trials and mass purges would not take place for a decade \\u2014 yet here is the general plan of later dictatorships and surveillance capitalisms, laid out in \\u2018We\\u2019 as if in a blueprint.\\u201d\", \"It all makes the original context of Zamyatin\\u2019s novel \\u2014 largely a literary scabble about technology and the freedom to experiment \\u2014 feel embarrassingly quaint. Yet, for Shayevich, who describes herself as \\u201ca student of the humanities with a fetish for ambiguity and a translator\\u2019s resigned reverence for the inexact,\\u201d Zamyatin\\u2019s original message feels strikingly relevant. Indeed, translation is one of the realms of literature uniquely vulnerable to this era of techno-mania and our addiction to computerized shortcuts. Zamyatin\\u2019s novel reminds us, she writes, that \\u201cwe are affected by what is human in art, not a \\u2018perfection\\u2019 that can be replicated by a machine.\\u201d Perhaps this is why so many artists, even those outside the genre of science fiction, continue to return to \\u201cWe\\u201d for inspiration (which, incidentally, the One State considers a medical illness) and hope. With its sharp, uneven edges and chaotic originality, Zamyatin\\u2019s novel exposes the notion that human creativity is something that can be quantified, churned into an algorithm and sold as exact science for the fiction that it is.\"]","href_hash":"45fe73c43bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"45fe73c43bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}},
