They include masking mandates, guidance to work from home and the use of vaccine passports, but they fall short of the stricter lockdown measures some opposition lawmakers and scientists had called for.\", \"\\u201cI do think the balance of measures that we have is the right one,\\u201d Mr. Johnson said. He said he believed there was a \\u201cgood chance\\u201d of getting through the wave without further restrictions.\", \"As Mr. Johnson\\u2019s government has pushed for the Britain to remain open in recent weeks, a surge in coronavirus cases driven by the highly transmissible Omicron variant has added to the pressure to shut down. On Tuesday, some 218,000 new coronavirus cases were reported, and hospitalizations have continued to rise.\", \"Absences at hospitals across England have left a number of facilities critically short of staff, field hospitals have been set up to deal with an overflow of patients, and public transportation has been hit with shutdowns as workers have called in sick.\", \"Mr. Johnson acknowledged that the weeks ahead would be challenging. But he pointed to support being given to key industries and said he believed the staff shortages would be far less disruptive than a lockdown. He said the government had identified 100,000 critical workers who would be offered daily virus tests to help keep essential services open.\", \"Schools in England reopened on Tuesday with new measures, including extended masking requirements and testing. Recently retired teachers were being asked to return to cover absences. And as England\\u2019s National Health Service moved to a \\u201cwar footing,\\u201d the government was working to identify hospitals most likely to need military support.\", \"Despite the rise in cases, there were some glimmers of good news.\", \"England\\u2019s chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, said on Tuesday that new data showed that a booster shot gave a person around 88 percent protection against hospitalization, and that protection was likely to be even greater when it came to mortality.\", \"Earlier in the day, Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London, said that he was \\u201ccautiously optimistic\\u201d that coronavirus infection rates in London in the key 18-to-50 age group that has been driving the Omicron outbreak \\u201cmay possibly have plateaued.\\u201d\", \"Professor Ferguson told the BBC that it was too early to say whether new infections were going down, but the growth in some areas had slowed. He cautioned, however, that it could be weeks before the full effect of social mixing over Christmas was known. Holiday socializing may prove especially risky for older populations, he said.\", \"\\u201cHospitalizations are still generally going up across the country, and we may see high levels for some weeks,\\u201d Professor Ferguson said, adding that the numbers were still far below levels seen during a peak last year.\"]","href_hash":"c5fe3f646e2c11ecab3e7f2ef8c3bb6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c5fe3f646e2c11ecab3e7f2ef8c3bb6f"}},
