I was on the couch with headphones, and my daughters, ages 6 and 4, were on the floor, fighting over Legos. At one point my younger daughter hit me on the head with a giant stuffed seal. \\u201cWatch me,\\u201d she yelled. She was going to make soup \\u201cout of blood.\\u201d\", \"It was a distracted form of watching and working, but it is one that after nearly two years of pandemic life feels, if not ideal, habitual. And it was the ideal state to receive a movie like \\u201cThe Lost Daughter,\\u201d which captures with uncanny precision one version of the multitasking mother and arrives on the heels of a year that many women with children will remember as one of the hardest of their lives.\", \"The mother occupies a bewildering place in American society, simultaneously omnipresent and irrelevant. Harried moms are enshrined in paper-towel commercials, while our political institutions show a Teflon-like resistance to addressing their material needs. It would of course be impossible for any one work to show this condition, this cruelty, in all its richness and iterations, but American art about mothers is rarely made or received with the necessary asterisk, one that acknowledges the labor of caregiving, the five-alarm fires that are raging in our personal lives and political spheres.\", \"\\u201cThe Lost Daughter\\u201d is one of a spate of recent films and television shows that attempt to make audible the scream rising in the throat. It tells the story of an English academic named Leda, played by Olivia Colman in the present and by Jessie Buckley in flashbacks to her life as a young mother, and opens with Colman on the seashore at night. Pain shadows her face and she has what looks like blood on her blouse; she sways and paces before collapsing by the lapping waves. The scene strikes an unsettling note that will thrum for the duration of the movie, which in the present follows Leda at age 47, on holiday on a Greek island. We watch her float in the sea, write and read while she sunbathes, eat ice cream, unfurl into an uneasy relaxation. When a chaotic group \\u2014 among them a young woman and child \\u2014 disturbs her idyll on the beach, Leda watches the pair with tenderness and pain on her face.\", \"We learn that the large group is a Greek American family from Queens, including the young woman Nina (Dakota Johnson) and her child Elena. Nina triggers overwhelming memories of Leda\\u2019s own early years of marriage and motherhood. In flashbacks, we see a young Leda radiating love and frustration as she cuddles her two daughters, plays lacklusterly, throws a doll out the window, withholds a kiss, strikes one of the girls, laughs with delight. In these flashbacks, the camera is close on the little girls, capturing both how cute and defenseless they are, and how exasperating they might be to a parent on the edge of patience and sanity. In one scene, young Leda\\u2019s husband, slender and shaggy-haired Jack Farthing, shakes Leda from her focused work under headphones while the girls\\u2019 wailing fills their flat. He gestures to his phone call. \\u201cIt\\u2019s Sunday, you\\u2019re on,\\u201d she whispers furiously. \\u201cI\\u2019m working,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI\\u2019m suffocating,\\u201d she replies. They are both scholars, but his work seems to take precedence. There\\u2019s not much money, and he\\u2019s often away \\u2014 an old story.\", \"In the present, the older Leda\\u2019s relationship with Nina\\u2019s family is close, mutually antagonistic and strange. Nina becomes a kind of double to Leda, turning to the older woman for support, though they appear to have little in common. Leda is aloof, independent; Nina is young, tied to a menacing husband, worn out by her daughter. \\u201cShe won\\u2019t sleep unless I\\u2019m in the bed with her,\\u201d Nina tells Leda. \\u201cI\\u2019m really tired. I\\u2019m like scary tired.\\u201d And then Leda tells Nina, and us, her secret: She left her children for a period of time when they were small. A flashback reveals the inciting incident, a trip to a conference where she felt the erotic thrill of both professional and romantic attention, unencumbered by the girls. The note of menace continues unabated until a surprising moment of grace at the film\\u2019s very end.\", \"As I watched, juggling my own domestic responsibilities with varying amounts of grace, I felt strangely honored by the way the film made space for Leda to make what is undeniably an ugly choice, allowed her to both enjoy her escape and suffer its consequences. Even in my distracted state, it swept in like a stinging breeze off the sea, a cogent, sensuous and provocative work of art that made me reflect on the paucity of realistic representations of motherhood, and the difficulties inherent in creating them.\", \"Cinema loves a monstrous mommy. Leda is often rude and unkind, but Colman\\u2019s and Buckley\\u2019s brilliant performances allow the viewer to inhabit her desperation, rendering judgment irrelevant. And the film\\u2019s timing is transcendent, arriving in a moment when the pandemic has disrupted school, shredded an already frayed child-care infrastructure and forced mothers to cobble together care, work with kids on their lap or drop out of the work force entirely. In this moment, there is something cathartic about a mother who says not only, \\u201cI prefer not to,\\u201d but, \\u201cI cannot,\\u201d momentarily leaving the relentless work of caregiving to someone else. It\\u2019s both a fantasy of walking away and a warning about its costs.\", \"The urge to flee is in the air. \\u201cScenes From a Marriage,\\u201d Hagai Levi\\u2019s remake of Ingmar Bergman\\u2019s iconic mini-series, shows a mother and breadwinner, Mira, played by Jessica Chastain, as she takes a temporary assignment in Israel, along with a lover. She is the mother as philanderer and absentee. Mira tells her husband, Jonathan, played by Oscar Isaac, that she will fly in biweekly to see their young daughter, justifying her plan with a note of hysteria in her voice: \\u201cMen do it all the time and then, you know, it\\u2019s not really a big deal.\\u201d Unlike Gyllenhaal\\u2019s, Levi\\u2019s representation of caregiving is gestural, the child almost always in bed, a suspiciously good sleeper. And unlike Leda, Mira doesn\\u2019t make the clean break. What is interesting about the series, stylish and very sexy, is how Mira does manage to live a bit like a man, primarily because of her co-parent, a man who explicitly loves caregiving, and the fact that there\\u2019s enough money to ease the difficulty. It\\u2019s a fantasy of another kind.\", \"A mother leaves in Mike Mills\\u2019s new film, \\u201cC\\u2019mon C\\u2019mon,\\u201d because her family obligations require it. Mills\\u2019s film focuses on the other side of maternal absence: the child, and the person who cares for the child. Viv, played by Gaby Hoffmann, lives separately from her co-parent, who has bipolar disorder, but is obligated to help him through a psychiatric crisis. Joaquin Phoenix plays her brother Johnny, a \\u201cThis American Life\\u201d-style radio host, who volunteers to watch her 9-year-old son, Jesse, while she is away. This is Uncle Johnny\\u2019s first rodeo, and he receives parenting instructions from Viv over the phone. The film shows us, mostly through these conversations, that Viv is an involved, present and very real mother (\\u201cI [expletive] hate it sometimes,\\u201d she tells Johnny, before telling him that he needs to feed Jesse some protein). Upon the movie\\u2019s release, I read male critics respectively describe Jesse as \\u201ca handful,\\u201d his mother as \\u201cindulgent.\\u201d And yet the movie shows behavior that is fairly standard in terms of child rearing. We see Jesse running away from his uncle in the drugstore and on the street, refusing sleep, rejecting his noodles in favor of ice cream. On the phone with his sister, Johnny laments his inability to control the little boy. \\u201cWelcome to my [expletive] life,\\u201d she tells him. \\u201cNobody knows what they\\u2019re doing with these kids. You just have to keep doing it.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cC\\u2019mon C\\u2019mon,\\u201d black and white and a bit slow compared with the frenetic sensuality of \\u201cThe Lost Daughter,\\u201d mirrors some of its portrayals: It is, in part, about how hard it is to take care of a small person. In contrast to Leda and Mira, Viv represents a perhaps more common version of the absent mother, one who is gone simply because she has to take care of something else. It\\u2019s not quite wish fulfillment \\u2014 Viv has her hands full caring for Jesse\\u2019s dad, and she is still phone-coaching Johnny through his babysitting crises \\u2014 but the day-to-day stuff is, for once, not her problem. I noted with interest Johnny\\u2019s recruitment of another colleague as an on-site babysitter, and Johnny\\u2019s female co-worker needling him about putting off work.\", \"The film gestures at the deeper systemic struggles of parenthood. Johnny\\u2019s adventures with Jesse are interwoven with his work interviewing (real, nonactor) children, whose circumstances are often difficult and remote from his own, including a child who feels responsible for his little sister while their father is incarcerated. The most perverse \\u2014 and oblique \\u2014 object lesson comes only in the final credits. The film is dedicated to Devante Bryant, one of the little boys interviewed. The viewer who searches for Bryant\\u2019s name learns that he was murdered by gunfire near his family\\u2019s house in the Seventh Ward of New Orleans, an area where the average household income is half that of the city\\u2019s as a whole. There are American babies much less likely to survive their childhood, American women less likely to survive their matrescence. There are also mothers whose difficult moments, moments like Leda\\u2019s or Mira\\u2019s or Viv\\u2019s, can lead to children being removed from their care. If class and race cannot inoculate women from the difficulties of motherhood, it insulates them from the worst depredations of a cruel country.\", \"The recent Netflix special \\u201cMaid,\\u201d an adaptation of Stephanie Land\\u2019s memoir, shows how absence can be forced both by economic conditions and by the state. The series follows Alex, a young white mother played by Margaret Qualley, as she escapes an abusive household with her daughter and navigates the circular logic of American welfare. As she fights her way to stability with paltry assistance programs and cleaning jobs, captions show her dwindling funds, an unusually explicit comment on the impossible economics of American life. In one scene, a social worker explains how Alex can qualify for assistance. \\u201cI need a job to prove that I need day care in order to get a job?\\u201d Alex asks, incredulous. \\u201cWhat kind of [expletive] is that?\\u201d\", \"Alex is likable: spunky, funny, scrupulous, beautiful, working on her writing in her rare free time. She is never impatient or unloving with her daughter, a preternaturally placid preschooler. I liked Alex and the show, but was struck by the paradox her character represents, particularly in contrast with Leda and Mira and Viv, who are given the space to be frustrated and miserable, a sort of double privilege of white and comparatively affluent mothers both in reality and onscreen. I imagined how \\u201cMaid\\u201d would be different if it showed Alex, run ragged from cruel bureaucracy and hard, underpaid jobs, losing her temper with her kid, looking ugly, looking mean. It\\u2019s a risk the show doesn\\u2019t take, underscoring the challenge of showing the systemic challenges of parenthood alongside the embodied, chaotic act of caregiving and the individual human frailty of mothers. At one point in \\u201cC\\u2019mon C\\u2019mon,\\u201d Johnny picks up Jacqueline Rose\\u2019s book-length essay \\u201cMothers\\u201d from Viv\\u2019s desk. \\u201cWhy on earth,\\u201d he reads in a thoughtful voice-over, \\u201cshould it fall to them to paint things bright and innocent and safe?\\u201d Why indeed?\", \"Screen portrayals of motherhood that deal explicitly with class are also invariably tied to the raced logic of America. Compare the sunny Alex of \\u201cMaid\\u201d with Paula, the protagonist Chiron\\u2019s mother in the film \\u201cMoonlight\\u201d \\u2014 a Black mother, poor and addicted to drugs, presented to the viewer as she appears to her child: untrustworthy, frightening, possessive and cruel. The director Barry Jenkins has spoken of his concern that her character, taken from the autobiographical play \\u201cIn Moonlight Black Boys Look Blue,\\u201d by Tarell Alvin McCraney, be presented in her full humanity, and she is carefully and empathetically played by Naomie Harris. Yet in the overall context of onscreen representations of Black motherhood, she still falls within what the scholar Nicole Rousseau identifies as a filmic tradition of \\u201csurvival,\\u201d a motif which \\u201cillustrates a child attempting to survive a \\u2018bad\\u2019 Black mother.\\u201d \\u201cMoonlight\\u201d is the child\\u2019s story, not the mother\\u2019s. What might Paula\\u2019s movie look like? The love and terror and difficulty and grief of mothering without a safety net, the vagaries of temperament, chance and opportunity.\", \"\\u201cMaid\\u201d is a show with peculiar racial politics: In an effort to subvert tropes, perhaps, Alex\\u2019s first gig as a house cleaner is in the palatial home of a Black woman named Regina (played by a compelling Anika Noni Rose), who imperiously asks Alex if she can read. She and Alex eventually become friends, and fearful Regina, about to become a mother herself, asks Alex if she likes being a mom. \\u201cI live for my daughter,\\u201d Alex tells her. \\u201cYou can go,\\u201d Regina says coolly, and I laughed out loud, annoyed that Alex didn\\u2019t use the moment to paint a fuller picture of the experience. She is a writer, after all.\", \"While Alex is struggling in temporary housing, a court orders her to temporarily surrender her daughter to her boyfriend\\u2019s custody. To demonstrate her fitness, she attends a parenting class where a condescending man teaches nutrition to a roomful of mothers deemed lacking by the state. The implication of these scenes is that this is an injustice \\u2014 Alex knows how to mother (it is her own mother, given space by the show to fall apart, who never learned). Poor women and women of color in America who are good parents are indeed uniquely vulnerable to having their children taken. And yet, the scenes made me think of the online parenting class I am currently taking through my H.M.O., one I tried for months to get into when the pandemic revealed I needed help \\u2014 an opportunity born of privilege. Mothers around America eagerly scroll digestible TikToks and Instagram memes about how to be better parents. In \\u201cC\\u2019mon C\\u2019mon,\\u201d Johnny reads a script for \\u201cdoing a repair\\u201d that his sister tells him to look up online after yelling at his nephew. Everyone benefits from an acknowledgment that raising children is hard work that does not always come naturally.\", \"When I watched \\u201cThe Lost Daughter,\\u201d I felt seen by its portrayal of the condition of living simultaneously in joy and desperation, nostalgia and impatience. But I also know that Leda is a mother who looks a bit like me, with work a bit like mine \\u2014 the kind of work you can do on the couch, lucky work, fulfilling work. Mothering is work, too \\u2014 lucky and fulfilling, but work nonetheless, made harder at every juncture by a country whose institutions are built around white patriarchy, a country with rampant inequality, no paid leave, no universal child care or health care, no crisis plan beside \\u201cfigure it out.\\u201d We can\\u2019t ask any one movie or show to encompass the entirety of a particular human experience. But we can point out what they show and what they obscure about our culture at a moment when the values and requirements of caregivers are argued in the corridors of power. We need more: more help, but also more art \\u2014 art that is expansive, challenging, fair.\"]","href_hash":"bc0e0dcc574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bc0e0dcc574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}},
