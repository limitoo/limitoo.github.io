Arbery, a Black man, was 25 years old when he was fatally shot, a moment captured on cellphone video that spurred nationwide outrage and calls for racial justice.\", \"Greg McMichael, his adult son Travis McMichael, and their neighbor William \\\"Roddie\\\" Bryan are accused of pursuing Arbery as he ran through their Georgia neighborhood in February 2020. Graphic video of the encounter recorded by Bryan allegedly shows Travis McMichael shooting Arbery three times with a shotgun, the AP reported.\", \"All three men are on trial together, facing murder and other felony charges. Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley planned for the prosecution and the defense to deliver their opening statements Friday after the jury was given initial instruction.\", \"Arbery's name is frequently spoken alongside those of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, whose deaths also sparked calls for justice and change in the criminal justice system. The three defendants were not charged and jailed until two months after Arbery had died, according to the AP.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927044/ahmaud-arbery-trial-begins.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The trial for three white men facing murder charges in the death of Ahmaud Arbery began Friday as the predominantly white jury was sworn in.

Security cameras had recorded him entering a nearby house under construction.\", \"Greg McMichael said his son killed Arbery in self-defense after Arbery attacked with his fists and tried to take Travis McMichael's gun.\", \"Prosecutors say Arbery was merely out jogging, was unarmed and had committed no crimes in the neighborhood. When Bryan's video of the killing leaked online in May 2020, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation took over the case from local police. GBI agents arrested the McMichaels the next day and charged Bryan two weeks later.\", \"The killing of Arbery has dominated news stories and social media feeds in Brunswick and surrounding Glynn County, a coastal community of about 85,000 people.\", \"It took the judge and attorneys two and a half weeks to select a jury. Nearly 200 people summoned to jury duty were questioned extensively about what they knew about the case, how many times they had seen the video and if they had any personal connection to Arbery or the defendants.\", \"Controversy erupted on Wednesday, the final day of jury selection, when prosecutors objected to a final jury consisting of 11 whites and one Black juror. They argued that defense attorneys had cut eight potential jurors from the final panel because they are Black, which the U.S. Supreme Court has declared unconstitutional.\", \"The judge agreed there appeared to be \\\"intentional discrimination,\\\" but said Georgia law limited his authority to intervene because defense attorneys stated non-racial reasons for excluding Black panelists from the jury.\", \"One juror, a white woman, was dismissed Thursday for medical reasons. Fifteen total panelists will hear the trial\\u201412 jurors plus three alternates. The judge has not given the races of the alternate jurors, and they were not asked to state their race in open court.\", \"Court officials have said the trial could last two weeks or more.\", \"If the defendants are acquitted, their legal troubles won't be over. They have also been indicted on federal hate crime charges. A U.S. District Court judge has scheduled that trial to begin February 7.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927049/travis-mcmichael-attends-hearing.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Travis McMichael and his his father, Greg McMichael, and a neighbor, William \\\"Roddie\\\" Bryan, are charged with the February 2020 slaying of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery.
