He's a good, strong, solid man. He's big, he's strong, he's tough, he's game, he's got a good punch on him, he's knocked out a lot of men,\\\" Fury said as he and Whyte faced a packed media audience.\", \"\\\"He's got a lot of experience in the fight game, he was also a kickboxer and an MMA man, so he's definitely a man that needs a lot of respect.\", \"\\\"I've trained as hard for Dillian as I did for (Deontay) Wilder or (Wladimir) Klitschko or anybody.

The man's doing his job, getting paid to do it and so am I. People are in for a real fight.
