It is designed to put the industry on a path toward \\u201cnet zero\\u201d emissions of greenhouse gases, he said, and \\u201cWhat it implies is that the way health care is provided is going to be fundamentally transformed.\\u201d\", \"The governments of 42 countries have said they will lower their emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas that is warming the world, across their health systems. Twelve countries have pledged to reach net zero carbon dioxide emissions before 2050.\", \"The pledges have come from high-income countries including the United States, Britain and Germany, as well as several low- and middle-income countries that are already among the most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, such as the Bahamas, Fiji and the Maldives.\", \"The health care sector accounts for almost five percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. If it were a country, it would be the fifth largest emitter.\", \"Many of the pledges represent initial commitments that will need to be bolstered with more specific details on how the goals might be achieved.\", \"At this week\\u2019s global climate summit in Glasgow, the issue of public health has taken on a higher profile than at any previous United Nations climate conference. For the first time there is a dedicated health pavilion, and a series of panels, speeches, and lectures outlining the effects of climate change on health.\", \"They included emotional pleas by mothers of children suffering from air pollution, including Rosamund Adoo-Kissi-Debrah, who spoke with Alok Sharma, the head of the conference, on Friday and whose daughter\\u2019s death from asthma was attributed to air pollution. There have also been presentations of new technologies, including the introduction of a zero-emissions ambulance.\", \"There is already a sizable body of research showing that climate change is contributing to a wide range of health risks around the world. It is exacerbating heat waves, intensifying wildfires, heightening flood risks and worsening droughts. These are, in turn, increasing heat-related mortality, pregnancy complications and cardiovascular disease. And as with many things climate-related, the risks and harms are particularly severe in places that are the least able to respond.\", \"The United States, which accounts for more than a quarter of health-sector carbon dioxide emissions globally, joined in the commitment to clean up its health sector. Admiral Rachel Levine, the assistant secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, said the government would reduce emissions at federal health facilities, which could include those operated by the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, and would provide incentives, guidance and assistance to privately operated health facilities to make similar reductions.\", \"Nineteen private health care systems in the United States have already committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions.\", \"The Biden Administration has said that by 2030 the United States will aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 50 to 52 percent from 2005 levels across the economy. Health care accounts for 8.5 percent of the country\\u2019s greenhouse gas emissions.\", \"The federal Health and Human Services department said it planned to lay out more details Tuesday morning in a public statement in Glasgow. \", \"Carrying out these commitments will require countries to significantly retool their health care sectors.\", \"For high income countries, that would include making the health care sector more energy efficient and less wasteful, but also would likely require the transformation of overall energy grids to supply clean energy. For low- and middle-income countries, whose populations may not have regular access to health care or where health care facilities don\\u2019t have reliable energy, it will likely require building new and greener facilities at the same time as they are expanding health care coverage.\", \"In a closed-door meeting on Monday, international funders including USAID, the World Bank, and the Green Climate Fund had an initial conversation about how they would support the commitments made by low- and middle- income countries.\", \"\\u201cIn the midst of the pandemic, we had to recover from extreme weather events and manage the resulting health impacts,\\u201d said Ifereimi Waqainabete, Fiji\\u2019s Minister for Health and Medical Services, in a statement. It \\u201chas shown us that health systems and facilities are the main line of defense in protecting populations from emerging threats.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"01ba3afb40ea11ec8cef45e60875df97"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"01ba3afb40ea11ec8cef45e60875df97"}},
