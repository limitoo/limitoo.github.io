He mooned the camera as part of his \\\"bucket list,\\\" a list of things he wanted to do before passing away.\", \"Darrell Meekcom, a 55-year-old man with multiple system atrophy\\u2014a lethal neurological disorder that affects the body's involuntary functions\\u2014mooned the camera on Friday, November 5. The mooning and subsequent arrest occurred in the English town of Kidderminster.\", \"When driving home with his wife, Meekcom stopped at a speed camera van while his wife entered a Tesco grocery store to buy bread, The Shuttle reported.\", \"\\\"I got out the car and flashed my bum,\\\" Meekcom told the publication. \\\"I pulled my trousers up and got back in the car. I didn't think anything of it. It was a good laugh.\\\" He said a few nearby people also laughed.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1929538/terminally-ill-man-moon-traffic-camera-arrest.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A terminally ill man who mooned a traffic camera in order to fulfill an item on his \\\"bucket list\\\" was later subdued by six police officers.

However, 20 minutes after he arrived at home, a police van arrived. An officer began knocking on his window, he said. Within another five minutes, three other police cars arrived.\", \"\\\"I said to my wife, 'There's no way I'm going out there,'\\\" Meekcom said. \\\"I was too scared to go out. It was quite frightening really.\\\"\", \"Police then destroyed his front door and back gate as they stormed into his home to arrest him, he said. Six officers then restrained him and brought him to the ground, arresting him. Someone in his house began shooting video of his arrest, calling it \\\"ridiculous\\\" in response to Meekcom's actions.\", \"Video of the arrest showed the officers holding Meekcom belly down in his muddy backyard as the family dog barked and ran around the police. Two of the officers told Meekcom's wife to get the dog inside while the other officers held Meekcom's hands behind his back in order to cuff them.\", \"The officers told Meekcom that he was being arrested for indecent exposure. He responded by informing the officers of his terminal illness, including Parkinson's and kidney disease.\", \"During the arrest, Meekom suffered a blow to the head, leaving his vision blurred. He said he had a seizure later in the day. He later visited the local hospital to see if he had a brain hemorrhage.\", \"He filed a complaint with the West Mercia Police Department. The department charged him with a public order offense and released him on bail.\"]","href_hash":"d28cc82341cc11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d28cc82341cc11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
