Or the smell. Or the bad rap from veterinarians, pet lovers and newspapers. Whatever the reason, it seems more and more New York dog owners no longer think the city\\u2019s public dog runs are a good place for their pups to play.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s unruly. Dogs knock people over,\\u201d said Rachel Sedor of her visits to the Washington Square Dog Run, a public dog park in the West Village. \\u201cOne urinated on my friend\\u2019s leg. The owner didn\\u2019t say a thing!\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sedor, 52, said that eventually her Australian shepherd mix, Frankie , refused to enter the space, which is used by as many as 100,000 dogs per year. (Eileen Shulock, who is president of the Washington Square Dog Run, said that run use has doubled during the pandemic.)\", \"So instead, Ms. Sedor joined the private Mercer-Houston Dog Run, a few blocks away, for an annual fee of $60.\", \"She is not alone. For yearly fees ranging from free to $2,200, private dog runs offer an alternative to the city\\u2019s 84 public runs which, during the pandemic \\u2014 and the dog boom it incited \\u2014 have become more crowded and chaotic.\", \"In true New York style, there are a range of options, from no-frills to fancy.\", \"Annual fee: $795 for non-guests; free for hotel guests\", \"This tony run, which is attached to the SoHo Grand Hotel, \\u201cwelcomes all dogs, big and small, so long as they are furry and cute \\u2014 or not,\\u201d said Lauren Richards, the hotel\\u2019s manager. She said Leonard Stern is the owner of the hotel as well as the C.E.O. of Hartz Mountain, the large pet supply company, so he \\u201chas a special affinity for dogs.\\u201d\", \"The park is open to non-guests \\u2014 that is, if they are lucky enough to get in off a growing wait list (and want to spent almost $800 annually). The high price tag covers a Zen rock garden, small pond and seasonal flowers. There is also a small fire hydrant that \\u201cmakes the park more interactive, a touch more fun for dogs,\\u201d Ms. Richards said.\", \"The park\\u2019s surfaces \\u2014 which come in AstroTurf and gravel \\u2014 are power washed at least twice a week, and hotel Wi-Fi is available so owners can work while their pets romp.\", \"Eileen Murphy and Crixus, a 4-year-old boxer, make twice-yearly trips to New York City from Boston. Ms. Murphy, 49, said the run attracts \\u201ca lovely crowd of dogs.\\u201d At public parks, she said, people don\\u2019t pay as much attention to their dogs as they should.\", \"Annual fee: $245\", \"The West Village D.O.G. Run, on Little West 12th Street, is as no-frills as a park could possibly be. It looks like a prison yard.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s functional, period,\\u201d said Sabrina Schollmeyer, who frequently visits with Rubin, a Basenji, which is a rare, catlike breed that can climb trees. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a space. It\\u2019s enclosed. It has what it needs: running water to hose down the surface, bowls for dogs to drink, a couple of balls.\\u201d\", \"Bare bones though it is, the spirit of the D.O.G. run attracts hundreds of dogs and owners, some of whom have been coming back \\u2014 with second and third dogs \\u2014 for 30 years.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re a community,\\u201d said Tracey Sides, a writer and photographer who founded the park in 1992 with her late husband, Randy. \\u201cWhen you walk through the gate, it doesn\\u2019t matter who you are or what you do. Small dogs needn\\u2019t be afraid here.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Sides said anyone can join the West Village D.O.G. Run so long as they have proof of vaccination and a friendly dog with good manners.\", \"\\u201cEveryone volunteers, shovels snow in the winter, washes down the surface in summer, empties the garbage.\\u201d The annual dues cover rent, electricity and cleaning supplies. A big plus: W.V.D.O.G., unlike most parks, is open 24 hours a day. There are security cameras, so people feel safe.\", \"\\u201cIt helps,\\u201d said Ms. Schollmeyer, 42, \\u201cthat there\\u2019s a bar next door.\\u201d\", \"Annual fee: $2,200\", \"When she became disillusioned with the public dog parks, Annie Grossman founded the School Yard, which bills itself as \\u201cNew York City\\u2019s only trainer-supervised dog run\\u201d where \\u201cmember dogs can romp with their friends or simply enjoy off-leash time with their favorite person at our indoor/outdoor facility.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cPeople sit on the perimeter in public runs and look at their phones. It\\u2019s like the Wild West,\\u201d Ms. Grossman, 41, said. \\u201cNo one is in charge. It can be quite dangerous.\\u201d\", \"Located inside a Lower East Side townhouse, the School Yard is ideal for dogs who require a lot of attention and maybe a little extra supervision. No more than five dogs \\u2014 carefully matched by size and temperament \\u2014 are allowed in each 45-minute play yard. This is a big advantage for owners like Stephanie Higgs, 50, whose 7-year-old Papillon, Mu, gets overwhelmed in public parks.\", \"Adam Davis, who supervises some of the classes, has 10 years of dog experience and keeps close watch on Mu, Bobby, Tacy, Lola and other Yard regulars, awarding treats when appropriate and firmly calling \\u201cbreak\\u201d when the dogs get scrappy or aggressive.\", \"With its hefty membership fee, which covers five visits per month, the Yard isn\\u2019t for everyone \\u2014 including dogs who like to run: The small outdoor space, covered with \\u201cpet-specific fake grass,\\u201d isn\\u2019t exactly a leafy meadow. But sessions here train dogs and new owners alike to better understand dog play, and, ideally, better navigate other dog runs.\", \"Annual fee: $60; $30 for seniors, 62 and older\", \"Also in the no-frills category: this downtown dog run. A fenced-in concrete area, with an enclosed tree, concrete ramp, bone-shaped plastic pool, and a hose to spray, you know, \\u201cthings\\u201d down, the Mercer-Houston run is sandwiched between two towers, one of which is now under construction. It\\u2019s a membership-only run, open to the public.\", \"It\\u2019s not fancy, but \\u201cit\\u2019s friendly. There aren\\u2019t too many people. It\\u2019s not stinky,\\u201d said Jen Railla, 51, who enjoys the park with her Labrador daily.\", \"Annual fee: $40\", \"Astro\\u2019s may be one of the last, best bargains in New York.\", \"This Hell\\u2019s Kitchen hub is a good example of the way New Yorkers can scratch a little something from nothing, or at least very little. The park sits on a triangle-shaped patch of land between lanes of traffic near the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel; it\\u2019s an area that would otherwise be unusable. Clean, well lighted and pleasantly outfitted with flower pots and tennis balls, Astro\\u2019s is rarely crowded.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s very chill \\u2014 a nice, caring community,\\u201d said Peter Shankman, an entrepreneur who visits at least once a day with his 1-year-old rescue dog, Waffle, a dachshund and pit bull mix.\", \"Astro\\u2019s has a locked entry and a double-gated door and Mr. Shankman, 49, said he felt safe inside during the height of the pandemic when neighborhood hotels closed and the streets were relatively deserted. \\u201cIt\\u2019s wonderful,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOnce you get used to the rumbling of trucks every second.\\u201d\", \"Annual fee: None\", \"Jackson Heights Canine Recreational Wonderland, in Queens, offers what Manhattan parks so often cannot: lots and lots of space. J.H.C.R.E.W., as it\\u2019s known, occupies half a city block on land donated by the New York City Department of Transportation.\", \"Membership is open to all. J.H.C.R.E.W.\\u2019s lead volunteer, Gerald Gold, said the park\\u2019s \\u201caccouterments\\u201d \\u2014 tubes that dogs can run through, benches, solar activated lighting and a rain barrel volunteers fill with fresh water for the dogs \\u2014 are \\u201crudimentary.\\u201d\", \"But the park has separate areas for big and small dogs, a luxury for space-strapped Manhattan parks. Volunteers empty the garbage and make rounds to ensure owners clean up after their dogs.\", \"Green space is scarce in neighborhood of Jackson Heights, and Mr. Gold said that he and his neighbors are proud of the park. After all, in a dog-eat dog world, they joined together and created a place that serves community interests.\"]","href_hash":"9a0f21de47cb11eca958b3ae7ea82e54"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9a0f21de47cb11eca958b3ae7ea82e54"}},
