Mr. Dillingham\\u2019s term had been set to expire in December.\", \"The bureau, which has traditionally played a largely apolitical role as a data collection body, also became a political target because of its role in redistricting. Under President Donald J. Trump, the bureau was ordered to tally undocumented immigrants in what Democratic strategists saw as an effort to strip immigrants from the population count used to allocate House seats.\", \"The Trump administration also tried to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census. That provision was blocked by the Supreme Court in 2019 and abandoned by the Trump administration as time ran short to add the question to survey forms.\", \"Many see the nomination of a Latino to head the bureau as symbolic of a reversal in course under the Biden administration.\", \"\\u201cI think a lot of the controversy in 2020 and ongoing has been about people of color or immigrants, or who\\u2019s counted, who\\u2019s in, who\\u2019s out, and those kinds of issue perennially come up,\\u201d said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond in Virginia. \\u201cSo I think it\\u2019s valuable to have somebody who is a person of color in that position.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Santos is also a prominent statistician who drew support from a number of Republicans in a hearing before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in August, including Senators Mitt Romney of Utah, Rob Portman of Ohio and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. Mr. Romney and Mr. Portman were among the 10 Republican senators who joined 48 Democrats to confirm Mr. Santos.\", \"Mr. Santos currently serves as vice president and chief methodologist at the Urban Institute in Washington and has worked extensively in survey sampling, studying outreach to undocumented immigrants, refugees and other disadvantaged populations.\", \"Mr. Santos will step in to oversee a department that has been severely hampered in its efforts by the pandemic, which forced the 2020 census to be conducted with a host of unfamiliar challenges, including mail delays and novel difficulties reaching people by phone or in person. He will be tasked with managing these challenges through his five-year term, which ends in 2026.\", \"Democrats hailed the vote as a key addition to the Biden administration and one designed to restore the nonpartisan nature of the job.\", \"\\u201cWe need to protect our census from the pressures of partisan politics, and Mr. Santos is a perfect fit,\\u201d Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, said in a statement. \\u201cI am confident that Mr. Santos will restore trust and integrity to one of the most important agencies in government.\\u201d\", \"Though Mr. Santos\\u2019s work will hold deep implications for the political landscape and will produce the reports that inform domestic economic policy, he has stressed that he would not let politics shape his responsibilities.\", \"\\u201cAlthough this is a political appointment, I am no politician,\\u201d he said at his confirmation hearing in July.\"]","href_hash":"2d7b82a23da711ec95f8000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2d7b82a23da711ec95f8000017025a03"}},
