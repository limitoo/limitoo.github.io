He pleaded not guilty to rape and sexual assault charges this month and is scheduled to stand trial in April 2022.\", \"Sharing a person\\u2019s information online without their consent, a practice called doxxing, has often been used against women speaking out about sexual abuse. In May, Colorado made it illegal to share the personal information of public health workers and their families online for the purposes of harassment.\", \"During a two-hour debate in the Idaho Statehouse on Monday, Ms. Giddings said she had not done anything wrong. \\u201cI would not have done anything differently,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI think my intent was pure.\\u201d\", \"There was boisterous clapping and cheering from the public gallery after she spoke.\", \"In an email, Ms. Giddings did not comment directly on the censure. She criticized Representative Scott Bedke, the speaker of the House, the lawmaker oversaw the censure hearing and her opponent in the lieutenant governor primary race. \\u201cStopping this kind of unabashed corruption is exactly why I serve in the legislature, and it\\u2019s exactly why I\\u2019m running,\\u201d she said.\", \"Erika Birch, a lawyer for the intern, said her client watched the debate and was hurt by Ms. Giddings\\u2019s comments and by the other House members who voted against censure, in part because the internship was an opportunity for her to learn from those very people.\", \"Ms. Birch described Ms. Giddings as \\u201ckicking somebody while they\\u2019re down and then refusing to accept any accountability for her action.\\u201d\", \"In September, the former intern and her lawyers filed a tort claim against the Idaho Legislature, which said the intern, referred to as Jane Doe, feared for her and her family\\u2019s safety.\", \"\\u201cMs. Doe suffered and continues to suffer extreme emotional distress including suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety and panic attacks,\\u201d the tort claim said.\", \"The intern, who had been working for another House Republican, told the ethics committee in March that Mr. von Ehlinger had sexually assaulted her after they had dinner at a Boise, Idaho, restaurant that month. Instead of taking her back to her car, Mr. von Ehlinger drove her to his apartment and raped her, she testified.\", \"After the intern filed a police report, Ms. Giddings shared a blog post on her Facebook page and in her newsletter that included a photo of the intern, her full name and other identifying information. She also disparaged the woman in the posts.\", \"In April, Ms. Giddings denied sharing the information in an ethics committee meeting. During the meeting, a member of the committee showed lawmakers that the post was still on the representative\\u2019s Facebook page.\", \"The bipartisan House Ethics and Policy Committee in August found in a unanimous vote that Ms. Giddings engaged in \\u201cconduct unbecoming of a representative.\\u201d\", \"On Monday, the House voted to formally censure Giddings in a 49-to-19 vote that also stripped her of her assignment on the Commerce and Human Resources Committee. She will keep other committee assignments. House members who voted for censure said they did so partly because Ms. Giddings had at one point lied about sharing the intern\\u2019s personal information while under oath.\", \"Several Republican lawmakers defended Giddings during a two-hour debate on Monday.\", \"Representative Heather Scott, a Republican from Blanchard, spoke about Ms. Giddings\\u2019s military service and how it contrasted with the behavior described by the ethics committee.\", \"\\u201cDo you really know what she did wrong to punish her?\\u201d Ms. Scott said.\", \"Toward the end of the debate, after Ms. Giddings spoke, several other Republicans voiced approval of the censure.\", \"Representative Caroline Nilsson Troy, a Republican from Genesee, said she was voting in favor of the punishment because House members had a responsibility to look after student interns.\", \"\\u201cWhen we are sent young men and women of this state to care for in this body,\\u201d Ms. Nilsson Troy said, \\u201cI feel we have the responsibility to care for them to a higher standard \\u2014 that standard we expect of ourselves as representatives.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"07ef973547e411ecb68dedd06570bf48"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"07ef973547e411ecb68dedd06570bf48"}},
