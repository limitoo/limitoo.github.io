But the city council said the hospital had been hit several times.\", \"\\\"The destruction is colossal,\\\" it said in an online post.\", \"President Volodymr Zelensky called it an \\\"atrocity\\\".\", \"\\\"Direct strike of Russian troops at the maternity hospital. People, children are under the wreckage,\\\" he said on Twitter.\", \"Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov, asked by Reuters for comment on the reported bombing, said: \\\"Russian forces do not fire on civilian targets.\\\"\", \"The Ukrainian Foreign Ministry posted video footage of what appeared to be the badly damaged building of what it said was the children's and maternity hospital.\", \"The footage showed holes where windows should have been in a three-storey building at the hospital, and huge piles of rubble, some of it smouldering. Officials said they did not yet know any casualty figures. The reports could not immediately be verified.\", \"Earlier Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said Russia had broken the ceasefire around the southern port, which lies between Russian-backed separatist areas of eastern Ukraine and Crimea, annexed by Moscow from Ukraine in 2014.\", \"\\\"Russia continues holding hostage over 400,000 people in Mariupol, blocks humanitarian aid and evacuation. Indiscriminate shelling continues,\\\" he wrote on Twitter. \\\"Almost 3000 newborn babies lack medicine and food.\\\"\", \"Local officials in other cities said some civilians had left on Wednesday through safe corridors, including out of Sumy in eastern Ukraine and Enerhodar in the south.\", \"However, Russian forces were preventing a convoy of 50 buses from evacuating civilians from the town of Bucha outside Kyiv, local authorities said in an online post, adding that talks continued to allow the convoy to leave.\", \"Both sides have accused each other of violating ceasefires that would allow to evacuate Mariupol, which Russian forces have kept under siege for more than a week.\", \"On Tuesday, the Red Cross called conditions inside the city \\\"apocalyptic\\\", with residents sheltering underground from relentless bombardment, with no access to food, water, power or heat.\", \"More than 2 million people have fled Ukraine since President Vladimir Putin launched the invasion nearly two weeks ago.
