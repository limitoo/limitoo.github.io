Today, I want to look back at the Articles of Confederation, not as a precursor to the Constitution, but as a governing charter in its own right, with defenders as well as critics.\", \"Our Whiggish narratives of American history notwithstanding, there was no guarantee that the United States would supersede the articles with a new constitution. The story behind that process is, I think, worth knowing; it can give us a sense of the conditions a country needs to find itself in to make that kind of fundamental change.\", \"The American confederation began life as a wartime alliance between the 13 former colonies operating through the second Continental Congress which, the historian Robert Middlekauff writes in \\u201cThe Glorious Cause: The American Revolution, 1763-1789,\\u201d \\u201cprovided the center from which the war could be directed.\\u201d The Continental Congress took responsibility for leading the states. It established an army, sent envoys abroad, issued currency and borrowed money. \\u201cIt did all these things and many more without any clear authority except necessity and the tacit approval of the states,\\u201d notes Middlekauff.\", \"Shortly after issuing its Declaration of Independence in July 1776, the Continental Congress began work on a constitution that would define and formalize its authority. In November 1777, the Continental Congress sent its final draft of the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union to the states for ratification. There were holdouts, but by March 1781, all 13 states had joined the compact.\", \"The Articles of Confederation explicitly preserved the \\u201csovereignty, freedom, and independence\\u201d of each state as well as \\u201cevery Power, Jurisdiction, and right\\u201d that had not been \\u201cexpressly delegated\\u201d to \\u201cthe United States, in Congress assembled.\\u201d\", \"Congress, under the articles, could make war, send and receive ambassadors, negotiate treaties and alliances, and regulate trade with Native Americans. It could not tax. If Congress wanted new powers to deal with unforeseen circumstances, it needed unanimous consent from the states. And it could not exercise the powers it had without the consent of nine state delegations.\", \"The extent to which the Confederation Congress lacked sovereign power was not a major problem during the war with Britain, when necessity forced cooperation. It became one at war\\u2019s end, as the new United States struggled to make peace and resolve its own internal conflicts.\", \"It would take more time than I have to give a full account of the challenges that faced the fledgling American government. But all we need, for this story, is a brief summary.\", \"The first problem was debt. The historian Robin L. Einhorn points out in \\u201cAmerican Taxation, American Slavery\\u201d that the United States after the war \\u201cowed over $42 million to foreign lenders and, among Americans, to the army, the public creditors, and people who had \\u2018become creditors in the first instance involuntarily\\u2019 \\u2014 holders of the \\u2018certificates\\u2019 issued by army officers who had \\u2018impressed\\u2019 supplies. The annual interest on this debt amounted to $2.4 million.\\u201d\", \"Worsening the problem of war debt was a lengthy, punishing recession \\u2014 by some accounts as bad or worse than the Great Depression \\u2014 which forced state governments to raise taxes and render them all the more reluctant to pay congressional \\u201crequisitions,\\u201d or voluntarily contributions to the national government.\", \"The economic crisis brought civil unrest. To head off rural discontent, several states passed pro-debtor legislation (including the printing of paper money), intensifying conflict between those who owed and those who were owed. In 1786, in the most famous instance of internal rebellion, a Revolutionary War veteran named Daniel Shays led an armed insurgency through western Massachusetts, targeting tax collectors and other government officials, demanding debt relief. It was Shays\\u2019s Rebellion, in particular, that supercharged elite fears of \\u201cexcess\\u201d democracy.\", \"Here\\u2019s Elbridge Gerry, also of Massachusetts, speaking at the Philadelphia Convention:\", \"The lack of any real commerce power in the Confederation Congress compounded the problems of debt and taxation. \\u201cAfter the Revolutionary War, when Great Britain sought to exclude American ships from the Atlantic carrying trade, and several European nations sought to exclude certain American goods from European markets and from European colonies in the Western Hemisphere, Congress was powerless to respond with retaliatory trade restrictions,\\u201d the legal historian Michael J. Klarman writes in \\u201cThe Framers\\u2019 Coup: The Making of the United States Constitution.\\u201d\", \"The confederation also could not raise the revenue to deal with foreign adversaries. \\u201cCongress had no response when Spain closed the Mississippi River to American navigation in 1784,\\u201d writes Klarman, \\u201cor when Algerian pirates attacked American ships in the Mediterranean Sea in 1785, kidnapping American citizens and holding them for ransom.\\u201d\", \"That Americans settlers continued to move west, in violation of treaties with Native American nations, only worsened the situation. If they provoked war, the government could not protect them.\", \"By 1786, the Confederation Congress was gridlocked on most major issues. It was on the path to insolvency and poised to default on its foreign loans. It faced a hostile Britain, which still held forts on the nation\\u2019s western borders, and was unable to stop or repel attacks from Native tribes. Many Americans, and national elites in particular, thought the republic was doomed to failure. \\u201cOur situation is becoming every day more and more critical,\\u201d wrote a young James Madison. \\u201cNo money is paid into the public treasury; no respect is paid to the federal authority. Not a single state complies with the congressional requisitions, several pass them over in silence, and some positively reject them.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt is not possible that a government can last long under these circumstances,\\u201d Madison concluded.\", \"In her book \\u201cRatification: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787-1788,\\u201d the historian Pauline Maier quotes a nearly despondent George Washington who, in a letter to his former aide-de-camp David Humphreys, wrote that \\u201cI am really mortified beyond expression that in the moment of Acknowledged Independence we should, by our conduct, verify the predictions of our transatlantic foe, & render ourselves ridiculous & contemptible in the eyes of all Europe.\\u201d\", \"The Confederation Congress tried to reform itself. \\u201cIn August 1786, after months of debate, a Grand Committee of Congress proposed a series of confederation reforms,\\u201d writes the historian George William Van Cleve in \\u201cWe Have Not a Government: The Articles of Confederation and the Road to the Constitution,\\u201d \\u201cbut political gridlock prevented any action on them.\\u201d\", \"Despite the obvious problems at hand, many Americans were skeptical of making any major changes to the structure of the national government. You can see some of the substance of that opposition in the anti-Federalist critique of the Constitution.\", \"\\u201cBoth reason and experience prove, that so extensive a territory as that of the United States, including such a variety of climates, productions, interests; and so great difference of manners, habits, and customs; cannot be governed in freedom \\u2014 until formed in states, sovereign, sub modo, and confederated for the common good,\\u201d wrote the Virginia anti-Federalist Richard Henry Lee in a 1788 letter to Samuel Adams, expressing a core sentiment behind the articles.\", \"Beset by overlapping social, political and economic crises, paralyzed by stalemate and unable to reform itself, the United States under the articles was a failure. And yet, the Confederation Congress would endure for another year after 1787 as Americans debated a new constitution. The important point, however, is what it took to get to a place where those elites could agree that something must be done: internal rebellion, state failure and foreign conflict. To agree to something new, the country had to be pushed to a breaking point.\", \"More than a few scholars have written books calling for a new Constitution or at least profound constitutional reform. I have read a few, and they all hit the same notes: that our government is almost hopelessly gridlocked; that Congress has yielded its influence to both a powerful executive and an unaccountable judiciary; and that extreme gerrymandering in the House and gross malapportionment in the Senate makes a mockery of the ideal of political equality.\", \"But if the story of the Articles of Confederation tells us anything, it is that these flaws (assuming one views them as flaws) are not in themselves enough to prompt change. What will bring change \\u2014 or at least, the possibility of change \\u2014 is when those flaws render the country too sclerotic and dysfunctional to tackle its most existential challenges.\", \"As the United States struggles, for example, to do anything serious to prevent climate catastrophe, it\\u2019s fair to say that this moment is somewhere on the horizon. In which case, constitutional change will be here sooner than we think. The real question is whether, in the face of such a crisis, we keep our commitment to self-government. And that, I\\u2019m afraid, is impossible to say.\"]","href_hash":"3de189a63bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3de189a63bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}},
