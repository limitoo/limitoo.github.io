Ms. Akpojotor\\u2019s bright canvases are infused with color and textiles, and Ms. Mlengeya creates stripped-down black-and-white works that are stunning in their simplicity.\", \"\\u201cOne is more minimalist, while the other is loaded with craftsmanship, with skill, with nuance, with maybe a bit more overt messaging but also equally well done,\\u201d said Azu Nwagbogu, the founder and director of the Africa Artists\\u2019 Foundation in Lagos, Nigeria. \\u201cThe key thing is they both work with conviction and competence.\\u201d\", \"But both artists have an eye for capturing the spirit of contemporary African women, exploring female empowerment and the roles of women in African society. And both artists will be making their debuts at Art Basel Miami Beach this year.\", \"Ms. Akpojotor is 32 and from Nigeria, and her work \\u201cOde to Beautiful Memories\\u201d will be presented by Rele Gallery, which has locations in Lagos and Los Angeles. She is currently an artist in residence at Fountainhead in Miami, and her first solo U.S. show, \\u201cDaughter of Esan: The Alpha Generation,\\u201d opened in late October at Rele\\u2019s Los Angeles outpost.\", \"Afriart in Kampala, Uganda, will be presenting four paintings by Ms. Mlengeya, a 30-year-old Tanzanian, in the show \\u201cUnsettled Minds,\\u201d part of the Positions sector of Art Basel. Her work has been featured in the new book \\u201cAfrican Artists: From 1892 to Now\\u201d and in the online exhibition \\u201cDrawn Together\\u201d at Unit London.\", \"Both women said they were drawn to art from an early age. Ms. Akpojotor spent a lot of her childhood shadowing her father, a sign maker in Lagos. As a little girl after school, she said, she would go to her father\\u2019s space and watch him work.\", \"\\u201cThat was where I learned some of those skills that I use now,\\u201d she said during a video call from Nigeria. \\u201cI did not know I was going to be an artist; I just saw it as a hobby, something that I could do in my spare time.\\u201d\", \"But that hobby stuck, and she focused on art and industrial design as a university student. Those artistic and design elements can be seen in her work, where she gathers discarded strips of Ankara fabric that are used to make traditional clothing for weddings and ceremonies. She uses that fabric to create parts of her portraits including eyes, hands and bodies.\", \"The Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie came across Ms. Akpojotor\\u2019s work online and was \\u201cimmediately struck\\u201d by what she saw. \\u201cIt stood out in its confidence and had a certain quality of emotional truth,\\u201d Ms. Adichie wrote in an email, adding that the work she owns hangs on the living room wall in her home in Lagos. \\u201cI\\u2019m drawn to work that seems able to have competing qualities at the same time, which is a sign of true complexity \\u2014 her work is very bold and also very subtle.\\u201d\", \"Those qualities were ones that also inspired Fountainhead to take her on as a resident, said Kathryn Mikesell, who founded the program in 2008. \\u201cHer work is phenomenal,\\u201d she said. \\u201cShe is pushing what painting is through the use of textiles, and she is speaking to the global issue of the waste in the textile and fashion industry.\\u201d\", \"Adenrele Sonariwo, the founder and director of Rele Gallery, also came across Ms. Akpojotor\\u2019s work online and said that \\u201cit was like nothing\\u201d she had seen before. \\u201cI love the story of how these strips would otherwise be discarded, so they already have their own stories.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Mlengeya grew up on the Serengeti and in Arusha, where her parents were wildlife veterinarians. She studied finance at a university in Nairobi and worked in a bank in Arusha for four years. \\u201cI have always loved art,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand I just knew it was something that I would end up doing eventually.\\u201d After quitting her job, she sold her paintings in Arusha but quickly realized that she had exhausted that small market.\", \"After a stint in Nairobi, where she put together a show with a local street artist, Ms. Mlengeya was invited to Kampala to take part in a residency with Afriart. It was in Uganda where she honed her skills with black-and-white portraiture.\", \"\\u201cI wanted my work to be striking and unforgettable,\\u201d she said, referring to her first experiments. \\u201cSo I thought I would work on the subject\\u2019s face and when I finished, the background was white, and I thought, \\u2018You know, that looks good.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Others have also been taken with that background. Koyo Kouoh, the executive director of Zeitz MOCAA in Cape Town, has used the painting \\u201cLirwa 1\\u201d as her Instagram profile picture. Reginald M. Browne, an American collector and vice chairman of the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, has a piece that hangs on a predominant wall in his house.\", \"\\u201cEveryone who walks into my home and sees it, we stop and talk about what draws you to the object,\\u201d Mr. Browne said, \\u201cand that\\u2019s exactly what I wanted.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Nwagbogu said Ms. Mlengeya\\u2019s work was filled with contradiction. \\u201cYou can say it is simple, you can say it is complicated,\\u201d he said, adding that he finds the conflicting messaging reminiscent of the writer Samuel Beckett.\", \"\\u201cYou come in, you engage with the evidence, it feels like you are looking at a very precise document that tells you about a moment in time,\\u201d he said.\", \"Both women contemplate contemporary womanhood in their works. Ms. Mlengeya has examined that through the lens of four women she has focused on as recent subjects. For example, the woman in her painting \\u201cHuru,\\u201d which is Swahili for free, was often conflicted.\", \"\\u201cSometimes she thought it was a burden and that people around her put pressure on her to be a certain way because she is a woman,\\u201d Ms. Mlengeya said. \\u201cBut she chooses not to comply to these expectations, and womanhood for her would mean following the journey of self-discovery, peace and self-awareness.\\u201d She added that she depicted the woman in the work as floating, \\u201cgiving herself the freedom to choose.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Akpojotor said that there had recently been a strong move among female African artists like herself to change the narrative.\", \"\\u201cThe desire to show what was wrong with society in terms of women\\u2019s rights and people are now more aware of these things,\\u201d she said of the modern women\\u2019s arts movement across the continent. \\u201cThey want to tell it, to sing about it, to write about it, to paint about it, because history has mostly been written by men but now women are the ones writing their stories, sharing their pain and observations about the world.\\u201d\", \"Olusanya Ojikutu, a Nigerian collector of African art in suburban Washington, has been following both women\\u2019s work closely over the last few years.\", \"\\u201cThe link between Sungi and Marcellina\\u2019s unique depiction of Black women is incontrovertible,\\u201d he wrote in an email, adding that while he did not yet own any works by either woman he is \\u201ckeenly interested\\u201d to do so soon.\", \"\\u201cI was also drawn to the palpable enthusiasm and energy they seamlessly deploy to amplify the inherent beauty, vivacity and charisma of these everyday Black women,\\u201d he said, \\u201cas well as the depiction of the extraordinary paragon of womanhood in their work.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e4591781503411ecb8ac430814490bde"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e4591781503411ecb8ac430814490bde"}},
