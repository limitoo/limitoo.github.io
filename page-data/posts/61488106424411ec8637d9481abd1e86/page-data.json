Simply, police can't do everything and certainly can't do it in the same timeframe, so a lot of prevention schemes have had to take a back seat, some of the investigations of minor crimes certainly can't be attended to - and that's just the nature of (it) you can only do so much when you are short staffed and the staff are stretched.\", \"\\\"Something has to give.\\\"\", \"Boundary checkpoints were something that could only run for a limited period of time, and police were surprised to hear they would be running through Christmas and New Year.\", \"\\\"It that's the case we certainly don't see just how you could manage\\u00a0checking for vaccination or testing certificates - it just doesn't seem feasible - queues with tens of thousands of cars would just be too great.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/273746/eight_col_MicrosoftTeams-image_%2852%29.png?1630436349\\\" alt=\\\"Police monitoring a checkpoint in Mercer, near Auckland's border with Waikato.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPolice monitoring a checkpoint in Mercer, near Auckland's border with Waikato. \\nPhoto: RNZ/Nick Monro\\n</div>\", \"Police were assessing what priorities \\\"had to give\\\" every day, Cahill said.\", \"The government was aware of the issue and weighing up the demands on police, he said.\", \"\\\"It all comes down to that vaccination rate though, doesn't it.\\\"\", \"He said whether maintaining checkpoints was a top priority for police was \\\"probably a matter for the politics and the (police) commissioner\\\".\", \"\\\"Certainly at the start it was - suppressing the spread of Covid out of Auckland ... but now we're moving to a period where I think we have to have to understand what living with Covid is going to be like.\", \"\\\"So what's policing going to look like when we hit that 90 percent vaccination rate? Because I don't think it can look as it does now with border checkpoints.\\\"\", \"As for mandatory vaccinations for police officers, Cahill said the association's view was that it needed to be a legal question.\", \"\\\"What we say is if the government has the advice it should be mandated, and they pass the law that makes it legal, we will support a mandate.
