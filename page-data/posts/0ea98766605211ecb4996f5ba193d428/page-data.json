The bill, which passed last month, included a total of $3.5 billion for 49 previously unfunded sites across the nation.\", \"One of the first sites in the EPA's crosshairs is the Scovill Industrial Site in Waterbury, Connecticut, which has been on the backlog since 2017 after originally being added to the National Priorities list in 2000.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Cleaning up the Scovill Landfill in Waterbury is long overdue, and it's great to see federal dollars from the bipartisan infrastructure bill fund critical projects that have been stuck in a backlog.

Regan in Friday's press release.\\u00a0\", \"Superfund site cleanup is incredibly important to local health and safety, but it's also time sensitive: At least 60% of Superfund sites\\u00a0are\\u00a0in areas vulnerable to flooding or other worsening disasters of climate change. Since water runoff from Superfund sites can carry poisonous toxins into drinking water, kill wildlife, and contaminate surrounding soil, flooding and storm damage is a significant threat.\\u00a0\", \"Cleaning up Superfund sites \\\"is a critical component of preserving the environment and combating further damage from climate change,\\\" U.S. Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro told the EPA.\", \"The EPA's announcement comes\\u00a0just two years\\u00a0after the Trump administration's government shutdowns suspended federal cleanups of Superfund sites, worrying local residents who already had health problems.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"0ea98766605211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0ea98766605211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
