ceremony, returning nearly 13,000 hectares of land to traditional owners.\\u00a0\", \"The Federal Court of Australia has granted the\\u00a0Yuwaalaraay/Euahlayi people native title rights to the land in the Balonne Shire, including the townships of Dirranbandi and Hebel.\", \"While it was cause for celebration for many, some in the community did not live long enough to see the determination.\", \"Applicant Jason Driese said there was still more work to do, with\\u00a0areas in New South Wales that had yet to be recognised.\", \"\\\"The process is statewide and our traditional lands were obviously here well before a border was constructed through the middle of it,\\\" Mr Driese said.\", \"It has\\u00a0been four years since the first claims of native title were made, but Mr Driese said the process began unofficially about 10 years ago with community meetings.\", \"\\\"Our people are spread all over the country now and around the world so it's good for our people to come back and meet and be recognised as the traditional custodians of this area,\\\" he said.\", \"Traditional owners will have the exclusive use of 97 parcels of land,\\u00a0to carry out activities such as hunting, fishing and conducting ceremonies.\", \"Non-exclusive native title rights have also been granted over several waterways, including stretches of the Narran, Bokhara, Ballandool, Balonne and Culgoa Rivers.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c86dad1d77e4e4068e63737a9fc86483\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The townships of Hebel

chief operating officer Felicity Tyson\\u00a0said\\u00a0it had become increasingly harder for applicants to prove their connections to their traditional lands.\", \"\\\"There's been various decisions by the court, and particularly the High Court\\u00a0... and they've made the benchmark higher and higher for applicants who are pursuing a native title determination application to succeed,\\\" Ms Tyson said.\", \"\\\"The research that's required to mount a claim has become even more in-depth\\u00a0to satisfy the state as the primary respondent.\\\"\", \"Some of the biggest challenges facing groups needing to prove their connection to a region is that governments have done so many things through the country\\u2019s history to sever those links.\", \"\\\"There's been many acts of the state that have sought to ...\\u00a0dispossess people and remove people from country which makes the task of proving connection, a really onerous and often heartbreaking one,\\\" Ms Tyson said.\", \"\\\"[This determination] is a testament to the resilience and strength and unity of Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, that those connections are so strong that they haven't been broken by those acts.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4ecdc8b2046c9644e785633f2e8a89c7\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Federal Court justice

the determination would\\u00a0empower the community and entitle them to occupy, use and enjoy the area.\", \"\\\"Native Title is a very difficult process,\\\" Mr Knox said.\", \"\\\"But we proved to the state and to the Commonwealth that our people were here, we still have continuing connection to this country.\\u00a0\", \"He said the path forward for the Yuwaalaraay/Euahlayi people would be dictated by the desire to be involved in making decisions about the land in question.\", \"\\\"We want to see the protection of some of our cultural assets and sites and burial areas,\\\" Mr Knox said.\", \"\\\"We know plenty of places that have been destroyed and under the Queensland Cultural Heritage Act 2003, no-one\\u2019s been prosecuted out here for destruction of cultural heritage.\", \"\\\"So we want to work with people so that they get a knowledge of cultural heritage because a lot of that has been done out of not knowing that these sites were there.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"8e4b407b4c0e11ec9177517f677eeaaa"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8e4b407b4c0e11ec9177517f677eeaaa"}},
