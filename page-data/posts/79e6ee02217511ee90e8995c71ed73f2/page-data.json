People were urged to stay inside and work from home if possible as the flooding threatened to inundate more of the city, which is home to some 30 million people.\", \"Many rivers across northern India have been swollen over the last week by record monsoon rains\\u00a0hitting the region. The states of Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh have all seen widespread destruction and, as of Thursday, almost 100 deaths were blamed on house collapses, landslides and flash floods unleashed by the monsoon.\", \"Some parts of the Delhi subway system, which is used by 2.5 million people every day, were also shut down, putting more pressure on the waterlogged roads which quickly became choked with massive traffic jams. Several key roads were completely flooded.\", \"Local TV channels showed video from several low-lying areas that had been totally submerged by the waters from the Yamuna river, with people struggling through the flooded streets to reach higher ground.\", \"The city's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who ordered the emergency measures, said the water level was still rising \\\"very fast\\\" Thursday and urged people to stay home \\\"as much as possible.\\\"\", \"His administration said it had prepared more than 2,000 shelters for people displaced by the flooding.

That brought the record water levels in the capital even though it hadn't rained heavily in Delhi for a couple days.\", \"There was concern the sprawling Indian capital could face a drinking water shortage in the coming days as three water treatment plants in the city were flooded. The three plants provide fresh water to about a quarter of the city's population.\", \"Delhi and many other major cities in India grapple with flooding regularly during the rainy season, which runs from June to September.
