The sunshade and the segmented primary mirror must be folded up to fit inside the Ariane 5's nose fairing and then deploy in space like a robotic origami.\", \"Webb was designed to endure the vibrations and acoustics of launch, but it was not immediately known what sort of \\\"loads\\\" the unplanned clamp release might have imparted or what caused the mechanism to release in the first place.\", \"But NASA's blog post, without addressing why the clamp band released, said the engineering review concluded the telescope was not damaged in any way.\", \"\\\"A NASA-led anomaly review board concluded no observatory components were damaged in the incident,\\\" the post said. \\\"A 'consent to fuel' review was held, and NASA gave approval to begin fueling the observatory. Fueling operations will begin Thursday, Nov. 25, and will take about 10 days.\\\"\", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News.
