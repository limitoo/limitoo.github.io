The new testing rules are expected to take effect next week.\", \"That has left would-be travelers nervously calculating whether they will get test results back in time to make their flights or worrying whether there will be more rules imposed while they are away. A lack of certainty keeps people home, said Jean-Pierre Mas, the president of a union representing France\\u2019s major travel agencies.\", \"The U.S. stopped short of imposing a mandatory seven-day quarantine on arrivals. Nor did it upgrade its standard for an acceptable Covid screen from an antigen to a P.C.R. test, which can take significantly longer to produce results.\", \"Biden\\u2019s plan also includes free at-home coronavirus tests, a campaign for boosters for all adults and hundreds of vaccination sites aimed at families.\", \"Quotable: \\u201cThe most frustrating part is that you can never make a plan more than one week in advance because everything can change every day,\\u201d said one traveler.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"The new variant has already curtailed travel, just as the global economy was rebounding from the pandemic. It could knock a fragile recovery off course.\", \"According to one forecasting firm, a virulent, vaccine-resistant strain could send the economy into a tailspin again, while a mild one could leave health care systems unburdened and allow the recovery to get back on track.\", \"As a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development showed, although growth has been uneven, the world economy this year bounced back more quickly and strongly than had been anticipated. The report, compiled largely before the latest coronavirus news, nevertheless warned that growth was projected to slow.\", \"How the latest outbreak will affect unemployment levels and inflation rates is unclear. Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, indicated that concern about stubborn inflation was growing. The O.E.C.D. also warned that inflation could be higher and last longer than originally anticipated.\", \"The mood: People and businesses alike have shifted into a wait-and-see mode. \\u201cA lot of things do seem like they are on hold, like labor market or overall consumption decisions,\\u201d said Nick Bunker, director of economic research for the job site Indeed.\", \"Chinese tennis fans have started to use obscure references online to talk about the tennis player Peng Shuai, who disappeared from public life after posting sexual assault allegations against a former top Chinese official.\", \"Instead of identifying her Chinese name and specifying the details of her allegations, some people have used vague references like \\u201ca tennis player\\u201d and \\u201cthe spat.\\u201d\", \"Even media figures have found themselves challenged by how to discuss Peng without drawing the attention of state censors. Commenting on Twitter, one state news editor referred to Peng\\u2019s accusations as \\u201cthe thing people talked about.\\u201d\", \"The intensity of the censorship has made people hesitant to talk about it online or even in person. \\u201cWe know these kinds of things happen and we care about them,\\u201d said one tennis fan in China. \\u201cBut most of us choose to remain silent.\\u201d\", \"The latest: The International Olympic Committee had its second video call with Peng on Thursday, but officials did not release details of the conversation. The I.O.C. said it was using \\u201cquiet diplomacy\\u201d with Chinese sports organizations to address the matter.\", \"Archaeologists who recently uncovered the remains of a person buried in the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius in 79 A.D. are hopeful that modern technology will help shed light on ancient Rome. \\u201cToday it\\u2019s possible to do some kinds of analysis that 20, 30 years ago it wasn\\u2019t possible to do,\\u201d said one anthropologist who is studying the DNA. \\u201cWe will tell the story of these people.\\u201d\", \"The Swedish streaming service Spotify\\u2019s most beloved \\u2014 and, perhaps, creepiest \\u2014 feature is back: Wrapped.\", \"The colorful year-end synopsis of each user\\u2019s top artists, songs, podcasts and listening habits floods Instagram profiles practically the moment it is released.\", \"My top song this year was Joni Mitchell\\u2019s \\u201cA Case of You,\\u201d and Spotify let me know that I had listened to it exactly 55 times. I apparently had a music-listening aura that was \\u201cbold\\u201d and \\u201cconfident.\\u201d\", \"Spotify knows where we listen to music, what we\\u2019re doing when we listen to it and even what mood we are in, according to Wired, which also reported on steps to turn off that tracking.\", \"\\u201cWhether it\\u2019s a record label or Spotify or people who make washing machines, there is a lot of market pressure to figure out how to have a richer relationship with the consumer,\\u201d Paul Schwartz, a privacy expert and law professor at the University of California, Berkeley, told me.\", \"\\u201cThat kind of personalization can be a plus,\\u201d Schwartz said. It\\u2019s also valuable for companies digging for data to market to us.\", \"The platforms \\u201cconstantly walk a fine line\\u201d between making use of data and disclosing to users \\u201cwhat they have learned\\u201d about them, Ben Zhao, professor of computer science at the University of Chicago, said. \", \"As Kevin Roose, the Times tech columnist, put it: \\u201cA Google Maps year-end wrap would probably not be quite so charming.\\u201d \\u2014 Melina \", \"This soup lets you use whatever is in your fridge.\", \"The scholar Elizabeth D.
