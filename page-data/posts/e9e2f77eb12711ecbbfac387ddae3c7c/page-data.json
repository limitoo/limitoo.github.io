The Detail looks at whether the women's game is finally getting the attention and recognition\\u00a0it deserves.\\u00a0\", \"Cricketer, broadcaster and sports writer Kristy Havill was standing in the scorers' box at Hagley Oval in Christchurch last Sunday, as the\\u00a0crucial match between South Africa and India was flipped on its head in the final over.\\u00a0\", \"India was on the brink of a win to go through to the semi-finals of the World Cup. Then a no ball was called.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Once that no ball was signaled, the free hit and then needing two runs off two balls \\u2026 what just happened?\\\"\\u00a0\", \"It was a moment Havill, who's been working at Hagley Oval during the tournament,\\u00a0won't forget.\\u00a0\", \"But it's just one of many nail-biting finishes during an action-packed month of women's cricket, with the World Cup final still to come this weekend.\\u00a0\", \"Havill reckons it's the best Cricket World Cup - for men or women - in history.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Across the board, every game has been of a high quality,\\\"\\u00a0she says.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Men or women, I don't think we've ever had as many close finishes, either in the last over, or single digit margins, or matches won on the last ball.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I\\u00a0think it just goes to show that things are really looking up for women's cricket.

Restrictions on outdoor gatherings, which were lifted last week, have hit attendance figures for much of the tournament.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"But Havill says the profile of the women's game has been helped by the \\\"exponential increase\\\" in media coverage, with every game televised, as well as huge amounts of digital content produced by the International Cricket Council and television networks from around the world.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Because people can't travel to be here in person, they're having to deliver a lot of content on Twitter or Instagram or TikTok to try and engage with everyone.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Although there's been progress, Havill says the women's game still has a long way to go to be on par with the men. An example of the ongoing imbalance is the fact the women\\u2019s tournament prize money is about half that of the men.\\u00a0\", \"But she points out that the 2022 Cricket World Cup is probably the first that's been played at six high quality grounds.
