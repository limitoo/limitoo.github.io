It never had anything to do with race. It had to do with the right to self-defense,\\\" he told Fox News' Tucker Carlson in an interview that will air partially on Monday evening during Tucker Carlson Tonight.\", \"In a teaser clip from the interview that was shared by Fox News on Sunday, Rittenhouse said: \\\"I'm not a racist person. I support the BLM movement.\\\"\", \"\\\"I support peacefully demonstrating,\\\" the teen added, during his first TV appearance since his acquittal on Friday where he was found not guilty of all five charges against him in his murder trial.\", \"In an extended portion of the interview, obtained by Mediaite, Rittenhouse spoke about the prosecution in his case.\", \"\\\"I believe there needs to be change. I believe there's a lot of prosecutorial misconduct, not just in my case but in other cases. It's just amazing to see how much a prosecutor can take advantage of someone,\\\" he said.\", \"The network said that this documentary will include \\\"additional portions\\\" of the interview and an exclusive behind-the-scenes access to Rittenhouse and his defense team.\", \"One of Rittenhouse's defense attorney's, Mark Richards, told CNN on Friday that he \\\"didn't approve\\\" of the Fox film crew and \\\"threw [them] out of the room several times.\\\"\", \"Rittenhouse was 17 years old when he fatally shot Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, as well as injured Gaige Grosskreutz during a protest in Kenosha, Wisconsin in August 2020.\", \"The now 18-year-old argued throughout the trial that he acted in self-defense, but prosecution attorneys contended that the victims had initially approached him out of fear that he might be an active shooter.\", \"The Friday verdict was publicly criticized by a number of lawmakers and politicians, and sparked protests in different parts of the country including New York, Portland, and California.\", \"Progressive Democratic members of the so-called \\\"The Squad\\\" slammed Rittenhouse's acquittal, including Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, who said that the U.S. justice system is \\\"broken.\\\"\", \"\\\"It protects white supremacy. The two people who were killed deserved justice and so did our communities who continue be targeted with violence like this,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"[The] painful verdict sends a horrifying message that bringing violence to a protest for racial justice is acceptable. It's incitement, not justice,\\\" Talib added.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937297/kyle-rittenhouse-says-he-backs-blm.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">During his first TV appearance since he has been found not guilty on all his charged in his murder trial, Kyle Rittenhouse spoke with Tucker Carlson about the Kenosha shooting and claimed that he supports the Black Lives Matter movement.
