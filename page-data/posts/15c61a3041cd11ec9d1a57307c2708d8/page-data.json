In January, the company acquired Revue, a service that enables people to create newsletters, and said it would take a small percentage of subscription fees from newsletter writers. And in May, Twitter bought Scroll, a subscription company that created ad-free reading services for publishers.\", \"In June, the company announced Twitter Blue and a plan to charge users a small fee in exchange for extra features like the ability to organize bookmarks and undo tweets.
