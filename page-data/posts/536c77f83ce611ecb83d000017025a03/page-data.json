What's been going on today?\\\"\", \"As she continues to pet him, Turkey reaches out and grabs one of Jenkins' fingers with his hands. The two remain seated like that until the video's end.\", \"\\\"Turkey is a rescue squirrel who was released with his sisters about a year ago. They've all stayed close by, have nests and babies,\\\" Jenkins told Storyful. \\\"Turkey is sweet and mellow, and although he's a wild squirrel now he still loves his Momma.\\\"\", \"According to The Humane Society of the United States, young squirrels that continuously approach people have likely been abandoned by their mothers.\", \"In most cases, it's best to call a rehabilitator and let them handle it; however, The Humane Society said that if a baby squirrel falls from a nest, a squirrel nest falls from the tree or a felled tree contains a squirrel nest, an individual can intervene.\", \"\\\"If the baby and/or their nest fell from the tree today, give the mother squirrel a chance to reclaim their young and relocate them to a new nest,\\\" The Humane Society said.\", \"If it's cool outside, The Humane Society recommended that individuals place the baby squirrel in a shoebox with either a heating pad or hot water bottle. To prevent the baby from overheating, the organization said to place a flannel shirt between the baby and the heating device.\", \"In the event that the mother does not come back for her child by dusk, monitor the baby and call a wildlife rehabilitator.
