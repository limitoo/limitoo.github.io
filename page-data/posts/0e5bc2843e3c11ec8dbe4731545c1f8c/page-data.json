Meanwhile, unemployment dipped to 4.6 percent\\u2014down 0.2 percent from last month's 4.8 percent.\", \"Economists surveyed by Bloomberg had expected more modest job growth, predicting the report would show an increase of just 450,000 jobs. The October report was also a sizable improvement over September, when the report showed a gain of just 312,000 jobs.\", \"\\\"The unemployment rate edged down to 4.6 percent in October. The number of unemployed persons, at 7.4 million, continued to trend down. Both measures are down considerably from their highs at the end of the February-April 2020 recession.

Wages and salaries were up 4.2 percent in the third quarter, according to the Employment Cost Index,\\\" Hamrick said. However, he also pointed out that in some instances this means additional costs are being passed along to consumers, causing inflation.\", \"President Joe Biden and his administration will view the better than expected jobs growth as welcome news. Republicans have hammered the president in recent months over the slower than expected economic recovery amid the fallout of the pandemic.\", \"At the same time, the nation's unemployment rate still remains elevated compared with where it stood prior to March 2020.
