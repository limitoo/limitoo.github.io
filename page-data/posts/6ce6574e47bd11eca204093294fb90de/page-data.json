The figure marks the first time the number of overdose deaths in the United States has exceeded 100,000 a year, more than the toll of car accidents and guns combined. Overdose deaths have more than doubled since 2015.\", \"Though recent figures through September suggest the rise in deaths may have slowed, the grim threshold nonetheless signals a public health crisis whose magnitude was both obscured by the Covid pandemic and accelerated by it, experts said.\", \"\\u201cThese are numbers we have never seen before,\\u201d Dr. Nora Volkow, director of the National Institute on Drug Abuse, said of the tally. The fatalities have wide repercussions, since most of them occur among people aged 25 to 55, in the prime of life, she added.\", \"\\u201cThey leave behind friends, family and children, if they have children, so there are a lot of downstream consequences,\\u201d Dr. Volkow said. \\u201cThis is a major challenge to our society.\\u201d\", \"The rise in deaths \\u2014 the vast majority caused by synthetic opioids \\u2014 was fueled by widespread use of fentanyl, a fast-acting drug that is 100 times more powerful than morphine. Increasingly fentanyl is added surreptitiously to other illegally manufactured drugs to enhance their potency.\", \"Overdose deaths related to use of stimulants like methamphetamine, cocaine, and natural and semi-synthetic opioids, such as prescription pain medication, also increased during the 12-month period.\", \"Fentanyl\\u2019s ubiquity, combined with the unique social conditions caused by the pandemic, have combined to create a perfect storm, experts said. While some drug users seek out fentanyl, Dr. Volkow said, others \\u201cmay not have wanted to take it. But that is what is being sold, and the risk of overdose is very high.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMany people are dying without knowing what they are ingesting,\\u201d she added.\", \"People struggling with addiction and those in recovery are prone to relapse. The initial pandemic lockdowns and subsequent fraying of social networks, along with the rise in mental health disorders like anxiety and depression, helped create a health maelstrom.\", \"So, too, did the postponement of treatment for substance abuse disorders, as health care providers nationwide struggled to tend to huge numbers of coronavirus patients and postponed other services.\", \"Dr. Joseph Lee, president and chief executive of the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, said that community and social support that was lost during the pandemic, along with the closing of schools, contributed to rising overdose deaths. \\u201cWe\\u2019re seeing a lot of people who delayed getting help, and who seem to be more sick,\\u201d Dr. Lee said.\", \"The vast majority of these deaths, about 70 percent, were among men between the ages of 25 and 54. And while the opioid crisis has been characterized as one primarily impacting white Americans, a growing number of Black Americans have been affected as well.\", \"There were regional variations in the death counts, with the largest year-over-year increases \\u2014 exceeding 50 percent \\u2014 in California, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi, West Virginia and Kentucky. Vermont\\u2019s toll was small, but increased by 85 percent during the reporting period.\", \"Increases of about 40 percent or greater were seen in Washington State, Oregon, Nevada, Colorado, Minnesota, Alaska, Nebraska, Virginia and the Carolinas. Deaths actually dropped in New Hampshire, New Jersey and South Dakota.\", \"\\u201cIf we had talked a year ago, I would have told you, \\u2018Deaths are skyrocketing.\\u2019 But I would not have guessed it would get to this,\\u201d said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, medical director of the Opioid Policy Research Collaborative at Brandeis University\\u2019s Heller School for Social Policy and Management.\", \"Most of those who died probably already suffered from addiction, or were in recovery and relapsed, an ever-present risk exacerbated during times of stress and isolation, Dr. Kolodny said. And many of those with an addiction to synthetic opioids very likely became addicted after being given prescription opioids by medical providers.\", \"\\u201cTeenagers are routinely being given opioids to this day when their wisdom teeth come out,\\u201d he said.\", \"President Biden\\u2019s American Rescue Plan Act includes $1.5 billion for the prevention and treatment of substance use disorders, and $30 million to fund local services for people struggling with addiction, including syringe exchange programs.\", \"Federal funds can also be used now to buy rapid fentanyl test strips that people can use to check whether drugs have been laced with fentanyl.\", \"But critics say the response has been inadequate given the magnitude of the public health emergency. They have called for new funding streams to provide universal access to treatment, and for treatment centers in every county that offer same-day access to substance abuse treatment.\", \"For example, physicians still need federal permission to prescribe buprenorphine, a first-line treatment for opioid use disorder, which limits the number of providers.\", \"\\u201cIf you really want to see deaths comes down, you have to make it much easier for someone who is addicted to opioids to access treatment, particularly with buprenorphine,\\u201d Dr. Kolodny said.\", \"\\u201cIt has to be easier to get treatment than to buy a bag of dope.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6ce6574e47bd11eca204093294fb90de"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6ce6574e47bd11eca204093294fb90de"}},
