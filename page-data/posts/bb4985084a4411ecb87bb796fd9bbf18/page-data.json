A cartoon character burst into flames after drifting into a high-tension wire. And a 60-foot cat sent a plane and its two passengers plummeting.\", \"These are just some of the fates met by the giant balloons that have glided through the Macy\\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York over the years.\", \"After a shortened, audience-free event in 2020 due to the coronavirus pandemic, thousands of spectators are expected to line Manhattan\\u2019s streets on Thursday to watch this year\\u2019s parade, and millions more will view it on NBC. There will be floats, marching bands and clowns. But the enormous balloons remain one of the biggest draws.\", \"Here is a closer look at the milestones and mishaps involving the helium-filled characters sailing overhead, and the curiosities of a nearly century-old holiday tradition.\", \"The first Macy\\u2019s parade, in 1924, looked very different from today\\u2019s celebration. Animals from the Central Park Zoo, including elephants and tigers, joined the procession. The giant balloons that the parade is now known for did not show up until a few years later.\", \"In the late 1920s, Macy\\u2019s began releasing its balloons into the sky after the festivities, with a monetary reward offered for their return.\", \"The New York Times reported on the various places where the balloons landed. In 1928, a balloon called the Sky Tiger descended on a Long Island neighborhood where \\u201ca tug of war ensued for its possession.\\u201d Another balloon was found broken in half and floating in the East River, \\u201cpursued by two tugboats.\\u201d\", \"In 1931, the balloons included a 287-foot-long dragon that was held by 29 men. Macy\\u2019s released it and about 16,000 other balloons, many of them much smaller. Some carried postcards that could be brought to Macy\\u2019s for a prize.\", \"A blue hippopotamus balloon escaped the New York area, however, and was believed to be \\u201csoaring somewhere over the ocean.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cDescriptions of the cruising beast have been broadcast,\\u201d The Times reported, and \\u201cthe reward for its return has been multiplied by four.\\u201d\", \"Calls streamed in from people who claimed to have found the hippo, but they were simply seeking the reward money.\", \"Felix the Cat, Macy\\u2019s first character balloon, met its demise after floating into a high-tension wire and catching fire.\", \"Despite these difficulties, the balloons were released again in 1932. One hit a plane, sending it on a 5,000-foot plunge. A 22-year-old woman had been piloting the plane over Jamaica, Queens, with her instructor when a 60-foot Tom Cat floated into view \\u201clike a sea serpent out of its native element,\\u201d The Times reported.\", \"\\u201cShe sent the ship hurtling at the goggle-eyed creature,\\u201d the article said. \\u201cThe left wing of the plane smacked against the balloon fabric that was Tom\\u2019s hide.\\u201d\", \"The plane plummeted, and the woman nearly fell out, but catastrophe was avoided when the instructor took control and pieces of the balloon \\u201cfluttered away from the wing.\\u201d\", \"Macy\\u2019s stated that it would not award prize money to aviators who tried to down the balloons with their propeller blades. The company also decided that the tradition of releasing the balloons had to end.\", \"Mickey Mouse made his parade debut in 1934, attracting interest from other countries that, as The Times put it, \\u201chave helium and a desire to stage grotesque parades.\\u201d\", \"The Big Bad Wolf balloon was also a draw, and Macy\\u2019s planned to send them both to the highest bidders.\", \"In 1942, the president of Macy\\u2019s, Jack Straus, announced that the parade would be canceled because of the war. He deflated a green dragon balloon and gave the rubber to the military, Macy\\u2019s recounted on its website; the company eventually donated 650 pounds of balloon rubber. In 1945, when the war ended, the parade returned. Three years later the parade was televised for the first time nationally, on NBC, Macy\\u2019s said.\", \"\\u201cYes, There Is a Popeye,\\u201d The Times announced in its 1958 headline after a helium shortage spurred rumors that balloons would not appear at the parade.\", \"The 56-foot-tall Popeye balloon had made its debut a year earlier, his hat periodically filling with rain during that overcast holiday.\", \"After \\u201ca lot of calls\\u201d with the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company before the 1958 parade, Macy\\u2019s figured out a way to fill three of its giant, traditional balloons with plain air and support them using cranes.\", \"In 1971, for the first time in the parade\\u2019s history, wind gusts up to 40 miles per hour and a severe downpour grounded every balloon, The Times reported.\", \"NBC aired clips of balloons from the 1970 parade instead.\", \"The parade has had its share of accidents over the years, such as the time an M&M balloon struck a light pole and injured two people in 2005.\", \"But one of the most shocking accidents occurred when a Cat in the Hat balloon hit a light pole and severely injured a woman in 1997. She was in a coma for 24 days afterward, and finally reached a settlement with the department store, the city and a city contractor in 2001.\", \"Snoopy is just as popular today as he was in 1968, when he made his debut.\", \"He has appeared in over 40 parades \\u2014 more than any other character \\u2014 as an aviator, astronaut, skater and more.\", \"When Snoopy was absent from the parade in 2016, Mayor Bill de Blasio promised to bring him back. He returned in 2017 aboard his own float, and will appear again this year as well.\", \"Can\\u2019t wait for the parade? You can join tens of thousands of vaccinated and masked spectators to watch the balloons inflate on Wednesday, Nov. 24, to get a sneak peek.\", \"The event begins at noon and ends at 6 p.m. and requires proof of vaccination to attend. No umbrellas, backpacks, large bags, alcoholic beverages, drones or e-cigarettes will be allowed.\"]","href_hash":"bb4985084a4411ecb87bb796fd9bbf18"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bb4985084a4411ecb87bb796fd9bbf18"}},
