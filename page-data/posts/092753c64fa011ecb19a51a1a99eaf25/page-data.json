She had never seen the ocean before she set out on a flimsy boat from France into the English Channel last week.\", \"\\u201cShe knew only small rivers here,\\u201d said her cousin, Iman Hassan, at Ms. Nuri\\u2019s family home in this mountain town in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t even know what big waves are.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Nuri, known to her friends and family as Baran, drowned along with 26 other people Wednesday when a flimsy inflatable boat she was on with other migrants sank in the treacherous and frigid waters of the English Channel.\", \"The 24-year-old woman had been trying to reach Britain to join her fianc\\u00e9, a Kurdish Iraqi who has been living in England for the past 14 years.\", \"On Saturday, Ms. Hassan, her cousin, spoke in the kitchen of the Nuri family home while Ms. Nuri\\u2019s mother, sisters and female relatives sobbed in the living room \\u2014 the same room where Ms. Nuri celebrated her engagement in January. \\u201cShe was supposed to be a new bride,\\u201d one of her seven sisters cried, beating her chest in anguish.\", \"Ms. Hassan and Ms. Nuri were the same age and had been best friends since childhood. When Ms. Nouri and her fianc\\u00e9, Karzan Assad, were dating during one of his trips home, Ms. Hassan was their chaperone.\", \"\\u201cThey would come to my house when they had a date and they would talk,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThey were in love, like Romeo and Juliet.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Assad, 41, is a barber who lives in Portsmouth, England, according to his family, and Ms. Nuri dreamed of joining him there and opening her own hair and nail salon.\", \"Ms. Hassan, an engineering student, works part time in a flower shop in the Kurdish capital Erbil, the city from which Ms. Nuri left by plane to begin her fateful journey, a two-hour drive from her hometown, Soran. On Valentine\\u2019s Day, she said, Mr. Assad visited, and bought an armful of roses to take to Ms. Nuri.\", \"Ms. Nuri finished high school but did not go on to college. In late October, Ms. Nuri called her best friend and told her to come to her house, where she told her she was ready to join Mr. Assad in England and would leave soon.\", \"\\u201cShe told me, \\u2018Don\\u2019t worry, I\\u2019m going the safest way,\\u2019\\u201d and said she would avoid the sea crossing, Ms. Hassan said.\", \"Mr. Assad had procured an Italian-issued tourist visa that allowed Ms. Nuri to travel to the European Union, paying $20,000 to someone on the street outside the Italian consulate, according to Mr. Assad\\u2019s brother, Nihad.\", \"\\u201cSome people in Erbil get visas \\u2014 they are just like smugglers,\\u201d said Nihad Assad, who is a butcher in Erbil, referring to the people selling visas in the city.\", \"The Italian consul could not be reached for comment.\", \"Ms. Nuri\\u2019s uncle, the father of Ms. Hassan, worked at the airport in Erbil and talked her through how to find boarding gates and seat numbers on the plane. Ms. Nuri spoke Turkish but no English, and Ms. Nuri tried to teach her a few words.\", \"She traveled to Turkey, and then to Italy, Germany and France. But she had been twice rejected for a visa to Britain that would allow her to join her fianc\\u00e9, and when she got to France she found herself stuck. Making matters worse, the uncle who took care of her at the airport, died of a heart attack as she transited through Europe.\", \"\\u201cIn my opinion she got tired and she was grieving alone there for her uncle \\u2014 my dad,\\u201d said Ms. Hassan. She said her cousin was desperate to be reunited with her fianc\\u00e9.\", \"She met up in Germany with the wife of an Iraqi friend of her fianc\\u00e9 who was also trying to get to England, her relatives said.

Migrants who made the crossing that same day said the boats were charging more than $3,000 per passenger.\", \"\\u201cWhen she was in Germany I told her: \\u2018Don\\u2019t take the inflatable boat,\\u2019\\u201d said Mr. Assad, her fianc\\u00e9\\u2019s brother, who said he saw her off at the airport in Erbil. \\u201cShe told me: \\u2018Even if I have to swim, I have to reach Karzan.\\u2019 She was very much in love with him.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Assad has a screenshot of a map and location pin Ms. Nuri sent from the boat when it was in the middle of the channel.

She said they were waiting for the coast guard for help.\", \"But the rescue never happened, and Ms. Nuri drowned along with the wife of her fianc\\u00e9\\u2019s friend. Her husband, who was in a second boat that turned back when the first one began sinking, survived to identify both their bodies in hospital.\", \"Ms. Nuri\\u2019s death has devastated her close-knit family of seven sisters and a brother.\", \"\\u201cMy sister was adorable,\\u201d said her brother, Mohammad Nuri, 21. \\u201cAnyone who met her even once never forgot her because she had a very kind heart.\\u201d\", \"In England, a friend who answered Mr. Assad\\u2019s phone said he had been taken to hospital from the shock of losing the woman he loved.\", \"The tragedy is just one of the many hardships faced by Iraqi Kurds after they broke away from Saddam Hussein\\u2019s control in 1991, thanks to the efforts of their Pesh Merga fighters and with the help of U.S.-led air support. For decades, Kurds from Iraq and three surrounding countries have fled persecution and settled in Europe. The 50 million Kurds spread across contiguous territory in the Middle East and Turkey are known as the world\\u2019s biggest ethnic group without a state.\", \"As relatives came to mourn with Ms. Nuri\\u2019s family on Saturday, her father, Nuri Mohammad, 67, a retired Pesh Merga fighter, stood ramrod straight at the entrance of the street to greet them.\", \"\\u201cI want other countries to give a little bit of respect to the Kurds,\\u201d said Mr. Mohammad, in between accepting condolences. \\u201cI ask the world, especially the United States, not to block the path for our young people \\u2014 don\\u2019t leave them to the hands of traitors and killers and mafias.\\u201d\", \"Kurdish officials said the Kurdish and Iraqi government were trying to retrieve all the bodies of Iraqis who died Wednesday to send them back for burial.\", \"\\u201cWe just want her body to come and rest in peace with our family,\\u201d said Ms. Hassan, Ms. Nuri\\u2019s cousin.\"]","href_hash":"092753c64fa011ecb19a51a1a99eaf25"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"092753c64fa011ecb19a51a1a99eaf25"}},
