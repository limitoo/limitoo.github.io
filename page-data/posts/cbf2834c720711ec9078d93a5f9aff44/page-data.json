The Yankees appointed her to that position in their system prior to the 2020 season. She spent last season coaching in the Florida Complex League, but was rewarded with a spot on the Futures Game, an annual staple during MLB's All-Star Game festivities.\", \"\\\"I started thinking about my journey,\\\"\\u00a0Balkovec told MLB.com about that opportunity. \\\"I've been in the game for more than 10 years, so this is something that's been a long time coming. My first reaction was to make sure that this is something I have earned and that I'm getting it for the right reasons, not maybe just because of my gender.\\\"\", \"Prior to joining the Yankees, Balkovec had served as a strength and conditioning coach on the minor-league side for both the St. Louis Cardinals and Houston Astros organizations. She has also worked with the Dutch national team as a skill acquisition coach and has coached in the Australian Baseball League.\", \"Balkovec's promotion caps off a notable weekend for women in baseball.
