But those who have followed Weems over the 40 years of her practice \\u2014 through photography, video, installation, music and text \\u2014 say the artist has always been ahead of her time.\", \"Starting Dec. 2, in a strong indication that the world has caught up to her, Weems is taking over the Park Avenue Armory\\u2019s massive Drill Hall with \\u201cThe Shape of Things,\\u201d billed as \\u201cthe largest, most significant exhibition of her multidisciplinary artistic practice in the last decade.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019s a 21st-century oracle,\\u201d said Sarah Elizabeth Lewis, an associate professor of the history of art and architecture and African and African American studies at Harvard University. \\u201cCarrie has been at the forefront of addressing issues to do with, not just our humanity, but the racial dimensions of it. You want to probe the history of injustice and redemption? You must understand the work of Carrie Mae Weems.\\u201d\", \"In a recent interview \\u2014 one that had to be conducted by telephone because of a Covid exposure scare (she later tested negative) \\u2014 the artist, 68, emphasized her longstanding engagement with social justice.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve been working with these ideas for years,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re not trending for me.\\u201d\", \"The reckoning around race now underway at museums in the wake of George Floyd\\u2019s killing in part represents a \\u201cknee-jerk reaction to what happened in the last two years,\\u201d Weems said, adding that people of color are suddenly being thrust into positions they should have always had access to.\", \"But Weems \\u2014 whose sonorous voice both lilts and lulls \\u2014 said she is also hopeful about this juncture\\u2019s potential for lasting change. \\u201cI am excited by this moment, I\\u2019m also a little terrified by the moment,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019m very much looking forward to seeing how institutions negotiate their futures and what that might mean, because I don\\u2019t think we really know yet. Right now we\\u2019re kind of swimming in the dark, just trying to figure out one day at a time how to move this ball up the hill without completely understanding how steep the hill is.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s a reason her practice \\u2014 as well as the Armory show \\u2014 includes \\u201cconvenings,\\u201d meetings of typically siloed experts talking to each other, which Weems sees as essential to progress. The Armory\\u2019s list of scheduled participants ranges from the painter Torkwase Dyson to the writer and curator Simon Wu.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m interested in how you unite people across certain ideas and platforms,\\u201d Weems said. \\u201cOne of the things that a lot of institutions say is, \\u2018We don\\u2019t know the African American artists, we don\\u2019t know the brown curators, we don\\u2019t know who they are.\\u2019 Well, here are 150 of them for you to choose from.\\u201d\", \"Perhaps best known for her \\u201cKitchen Table Series\\u201d (1989-90), a succession of staged scenes featuring the artist that explore womanhood \\u2014 raising children, negotiating a relationship \\u2014 Weems has been steadily creating projects that critique the culture.\", \"The culture, in turn, has acknowledged her contributions: In 2013, she was the recipient of a \\u201cgenius grant\\u201d from the MacArthur Foundation, and the following year she became the first Black woman to have a retrospective at the Guggenheim.\", \"Her idea for the Armory show was hatched after a daylong convening she organized there in December 2017, a little over a year after President Donald J. Trump\\u2019s election. \\u201cI thought a lot about the circus of politics and the politics of circus and the history of violence and how to bring all of these ideas together,\\u201d she said.\", \"Trump\\u2019s presidency, along with what she saw as a clear backlash against President Barack Obama because of his race, made Weems want to unpack how the country is handling \\u201cthe browning of America.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHow will institutions negotiate this,\\u201d she said, \\u201cwhether they are museums or galleries or institutions like the Armory?\\u201d\", \"Among the new works in the current show, which runs through Dec. 31, Weems has also sought to explore whether the signs of progress prompted by the Black Lives Matter movement will prove to be more than a passing crisis of national conscience. \\u201cTo what extent is that sustainable?\\u201d she said. \\u201cHow we now move forward is a very deep and important question.\\u201d\", \"The show includes a series of large-scale installations, including a Cyclorama (a panoramic image on the inside of a cylindrical platform) of new and existing film footage, and her 2012 \\u201cLincoln, Lonnie, and Me,\\u201d a digital video projection utilizing an optical illusion in which she considers Abraham Lincoln and the Gettysburg Address.\", \"The Armory exhibition also features a performance series, \\u201cLand of Broken Dreams,\\u201d that starts Dec. 9 and includes artist talks, poetry readings, concerts and scholarly discussions.\", \"The current salience of Weems\\u2019s questions \\u201cspeaks to the cyclical nature of our history,\\u201d said Avery Willis Hoffman, the artistic director of the Brown Arts Institute at Brown University, who is participating in the Armory show. \\u201cWe have to keep returning to some of these hard and challenging topics.\\u201d\", \"In 1984, Weems said, she learned that the U.S. population would, over the next 20 years, become dominated by people of color, which prompted a spate of demographic research that she continues to this day \\u2014 in part through public discourse.\", \"\\u201cCarrie is doing some truth-telling when she is able to bring people into the room who she has learned from and who she has taught,\\u201d said Thomas J. Lax, the curator of media and performance at the Museum of Modern Art. \\u201cWith her sense of immediacy and mise en sc\\u00e8ne, she\\u2019s created a mode of participation in which you are required to be present, to participate.\\u201d\", \"Weems often explicitly uses her art as a form of activism. During the pandemic, she created a public art campaign to draw attention to the disproportionate impact of Covid-19 on the Black, Latino and Native American communities. Called \\u201cResist Covid/Take 6!\\u201d \\u2014 a reference to six-foot social distancing \\u2014 the art-focused messages appeared on billboards, shopping bags, buttons and refrigerator magnets.\", \"\\u201cI see myself very much involved in attempting to deal with the issues of my time in the best way I know how,\\u201d she said.\", \"She also tries to use her work as a way to cultivate and promote empathy, Weems said, to understand those she may oppose \\u2014 even the white supremacist groups that marched on Charlottesville, Va., in 2017.\", \"\\u201cWhen I think of these forces on the right, I have sympathy, because I\\u2019m human,\\u201d she said. \\u201cA change is coming that does not necessarily reflect who you thought you were \\u2014 I understand that fear. Then maybe there is space for some dialogue, for some sort of progress.\\u201d\", \"This effort to get to that humanity prompted Weems\\u2019s 2016 project \\u201cGrace Notes: Reflections for Now,\\u201d a theater piece inspired by a white gunman\\u2019s killing of nine people at a historic Black church in downtown Charleston, S.C., the year before, told through the story of a woman trying to bury her brothers.\", \"\\u201cI have this beautiful recorded conversation with my mother talking about the meaning of grace as a deep space of compassion, understanding, charity and love,\\u201d Weems said. \\u201cIt was through her answering that question for me that I was able to come to a certain level of clarity.\\u201d\", \"Weems recalled another formative conversation with her mother, Carrie Polk \\u2014 a former factory and domestic worker who is still living \\u2014 from when she left home to make her way as an artist. \\u201cI was wondering what my mother thought of me, and one day she called while I was living in San Francisco and said, \\u2018I wish I had done with my life what you\\u2019re doing with yours,\\u2019\\u201d Weems said. \\u201cIt gave me such confidence. Even though I was wild and crazy and living alone at a very young age, she encouraged me.\\u201d\", \"Her father, Myrlie Weems, who died in 2002, was similarly inspiring. The owner of a salvage company called Speedy and Son, he also had a creative streak, having sung with his brothers on the same stage as Sam Cooke in the Mississippi Delta. \\u201cHe told me from a very young age that I had a right to be in any room,\\u201d Weems said. \\u201cThat great lesson anchored me in a very profound way.\\u201d\", \"Born in Portland, Ore., in 1953, the second of seven children, Weems became interested in painting and drawing early on. \\u201cI remember rushing to the attic and pretending I was living somewhere else,\\u201d she said, \\u201cdancing around the living room, pretending I was a ballerina.\\u201d\", \"At 16, she had a daughter, Faith C. Weems, who now works with children in California. The following year, she joined Anna Halprin\\u2019s experimental San Francisco Dancers\\u2019 Workshop and later moved to New York, studying photography at the Studio Museum in Harlem.\", \"A boyfriend gave her a camera for her 20th birthday. \\u201cI took to it like a fish to water,\\u201d Weems said. \\u201cI just immediately saw it as a tool that would lead me into my life and through the world.\\u201d\", \"She was also introduced to Black photographers, including Roy DeCarava and his Kamoinge Workshop. \\u201cI thought, \\u2018Oh,\\u2019\\u201d Weems said, \\u201c\\u2018this is where I want to be.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"After earning a bachelor\\u2019s degree from the California Institute of the Arts, Valencia, and an M.F.A. in photography from the University of California, San Diego, Weems studied folklore in the graduate school at the University of California, Berkeley.\", \"In 1985, she married Jeff Hoone, who recently stepped down as director of the photography nonprofit Light Work. Weems described him as \\u201cmy greatest understanding mate in the world.\\u201d They live in Syracuse, N.Y., but also have a home in Fort Greene, Brooklyn.\", \"\\u201cClearly younger artists today are descendants of Carrie Mae Weems, so it\\u2019s a great moment to show a large body of work and to show new work,\\u201d said Tom Eccles, who curated the Armory exhibition. \\u201cSome artists need a change of a moment when suddenly you realize how relevant that work is.\\u201d\", \"Eccles, executive director of the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, said he was surprised that Weems asked him to work on her show. \\u201cI said to her, \\u2018Hey, Carrie, I\\u2019m white,\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cShe said, \\u2018That doesn\\u2019t worry me.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The exhibition would seem to reflect the artist\\u2019s status as an exalted member of the establishment. But Weems said she will never feel that she has arrived or is finished.\", \"\\u201cI see myself as an artist very interested in certain concerns, and those concerns have not yet been met,\\u201d she said.\", \"\\u201cIt is a lifelong struggle and it doesn\\u2019t end with the completion of a body of work,\\u201d she added. \\u201cIt is a life.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c355f11852bf11ecb5162b04b6a4af9e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c355f11852bf11ecb5162b04b6a4af9e"}},
