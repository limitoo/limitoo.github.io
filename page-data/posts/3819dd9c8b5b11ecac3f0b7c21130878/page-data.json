Marinello, a lawyer who specializes in tracking down looted and stolen art, who helped negotiate the statue\\u2019s return. \\u201cCollectors are being criminally charged worldwide and collections are being seized as more and more jurisdictions let it be known that it is unacceptable to possess looted and stolen art.\\u201d\", \"Marinello tracked down the missing Buddha in partnership with Vijay Kumar, founder of the India Pride Project, a nonprofit organization that works with the Indian government to retrieve looted artifacts.\", \"Four years ago, Kumar was searching for the sacred sculpture when it appeared in the sales catalog of a French dealer. He said in an interview this week that regulations in France protecting good-faith buyers of stolen artifacts made it difficult to act quickly. With only two weeks before the sale, Kumar did not formally request an inquiry into its provenance, which he said would have required him to notify Interpol and acquire police reports from when the idol was looted almost 20 years ago. But the statue didn\\u2019t sell and the trail went cold.\", \"Marinello joined the case last year and located the object in an Italian collection. The owner of the Buddha, also known as a Avalokiteshwara Padamapani idol, voluntarily relinquished the object when presented with archival photographs showing it in the Indian temple. As a condition of the handover, officials are not disclosing the owner\\u2019s identity.\", \"The statue depicts Buddha holding the stem of a blossoming lotus in his left hand, the Indian government said in a statement, with two female attendants below his feet. It was sculpted for the temple sometime between the eighth and 12th centuries. The temple is near Kurkihar, a village where a trove of more than 220 bronzes were unearthed in an archaeological dig in 1930. Most of those sculptures are now held in the Patna Museum in Bihar.\", \"When it arrives in India, the sculpture will be sent to the Archaeological Survey of India in New Delhi for study.\", \"Kumar and Marinello are among a growing number of citizen activists hunting for stolen antiquities on behalf of Asian countries. In December, the pair also retrieved a 10th-century goat head yogini statue from a garden in the English countryside.\", \"\\u201cRepatriation of our rightful artifacts continues,\\u201d the Indian culture minister, G. Kishan Reddy, said at the time.\", \"The work never seems to end. \\u201cWe are still scratching the surface,\\u201d said Kumar, who said he knows of thousands more looted Indian artifacts. Nearly 250 artifacts were returned by U.S. officials last year as part of an investigation into a looting ring that authorities say was operated by the antiquities dealer Subhash Kapoor. Kapoor is currently jailed in India on smuggling and theft charges.\", \"\\u201cEach successful return is a deterrent,\\u201d Kumar said. \\u201cNow criminals know that Indian art is no longer fair game.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3819dd9c8b5b11ecac3f0b7c21130878"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3819dd9c8b5b11ecac3f0b7c21130878"}},
