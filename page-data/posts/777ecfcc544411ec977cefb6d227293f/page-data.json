Most people I know have complained about memory problems, provoked by difficult times and traumatic events, and compounded by the redactions and distortions of social media. We know we all remember things a little differently, with reality fracturing into competing narratives the further we get from any given occurrence. But when disaster is near-universal and the gulf of disagreement vast, it\\u2019s easy to question our own recollections as suspect. Here, then, are books full of dueling paradigms, uncertain and chancy remembrance \\u2014 with the past looming both as a resource and as a nightmare, and the future at its mercy.\", \"Adrian Tchaikovsky is the author of over 20 novels, but somehow ELDER RACE (Tordotcom, 201 pp., paper, $14.99) is the first of his I\\u2019ve read. Lynesse is the worthless youngest daughter of a queen \\u2014 an impulsive, too-earnest embarrassment to her family, believing as she does in the legends of sorcerers in their lineage. Nyr, meanwhile, is one such sorcerer \\u2014 actually an anthropologist from a starfaring civilization who is separated from his team by decades and light-years, and is keeping himself isolated in suspended animation from the bronze-age locals until rescue arrives. But when a strange affliction somewhere between demon and disease begins plaguing Lynesse\\u2019s people, she comes knocking at the so-called sorcerer\\u2019s door to wake him up and claim a favor from him as her birthright.\", \"Reading this was pure pleasure. Usually this sort of fantasy-meets-science-fiction story leans hard toward one or the other, allowing that genre\\u2019s rhetoric to contain and digest its counterpart. But \\u201cElder Race\\u201d maintains a knife\\u2019s-edge balance between the two, and Tchaikovsky\\u2019s attention to language as a marker of genre, and to genre as a kind of translation, is elegant and thoughtful. Chapters alternate between Lynesse and Nyr, each of them struggling to understand the other\\u2019s default assumptions and paradigms until a breathtaking moment when everything\\u2019s laid bare between them.\", \"Tchaikovsky\\u2019s prose in both modes is somewhere between smooth river rocks and tooled leather; there\\u2019s an Ursula Le Guin-like grace to his storytelling, to the shifting of cadences. Everything about this book suggests deliberate care in uniting epic fantasy\\u2019s immersive world-building with the sharp, dislocating bursts of high-concept science fiction. I\\u2019ve never been so relieved to learn of an author\\u2019s extensive back catalog. Ten out of 10, no notes.\", \"Jeffrey Cranor and Janina Matthewson\\u2019s YOU FEEL IT JUST BELOW THE RIBS (Harper Perennial, 371 pp., $26.99) embraces genre more straightforwardly, but plays games with form and media. Cranor and Matthewson are the creators of \\u201cWithin the Wires,\\u201d a disquieting anthology-style fiction podcast narrated through relaxation cassettes, museum audio guides, and letters and notes dictated to an administrative assistant. \\u201cYou Feel It Just Below the Ribs\\u201d is set in the world of their podcast: an alternate 20th century shaped by the Great Reckoning, a decades-long world war \\u201cdriven by nationalist identity crises.\\u201d A New Society that strives to be borderless and tribeless emerges, slowly picking away even at subgroups like nuclear families. Presented as a questionable autobiography annotated by the unnamed editors of a potentially seditious small press, \\u201cYou Feel It Just Below the Ribs\\u201d mirrors the methodology of \\u201cWithin the Wires,\\u201d explicitly reminding the audience of its medium while destabilizing the story through insertions and insinuations of what exists beyond it.\", \"The fictional autobiography is of Miriam Gregory, a psychologist who pioneered a technique called the Watercolor Quiet, a blend of meditation and hypnosis designed to treat trauma \\u2014 but eventually adopted by the New Society to erase people\\u2019s memories of strong family attachment. The editors inform us at the outset that Gregory spent the last 20 years of her life in hiding, and warn of her unreliability as a narrator; doing so, of course, calls their own reliability into question. The tension between Gregory\\u2019s authorship and the editors\\u2019 authority \\u2014 fact-checking her claims, scrutinizing her intentions, casting doubt on her beliefs \\u2014 is a subtle, quickening pulse beneath the narrative\\u2019s skin.\", \"The relationship of podcast to novel is a tricky one. On the one hand, the book is perfectly comprehensible as a stand-alone project, and full of moving insight into loss, grief and family; on the other hand, having even a glancing familiarity with the podcast gives moments in the novel more dimension and depth, to the extent that I wonder what I\\u2019m missing by not having listened to more than a few episodes. But the podcast also slackens some of the tension between Miriam and her posthumous editors: \\u201cWithin the Wires\\u201d listeners will have confirmation of certain key plot elements Gregory\\u2019s editors disbelieve. While the back-and-forth between Gregory and the footnotes works to unsettle matters in the text, the podcast \\u2014 ironically \\u2014 settles them. Meanwhile, Gregory\\u2019s story, on its own merits, is a mixed bag; her early years are characterized by aimless meandering in a world that is largely blank and featureless, and the form of the novel works against the kinds of storytelling that would allow a reader purchase in it. Overall, this is a novel probably best enjoyed by people with no experience of the podcast, or a complete experience of it; as the book itself suggests, half-formed remnants of memory are trouble.\", \"Memory and revelation are integral to Freya Marske\\u2019s debut, A MARVELLOUS LIGHT (Tordotcom, 375 pp., $27.99), a lush historical fantasy. In an alternate Edwardian England, magic runs in families like wealth, but is kept secret through stealth and \\u201clethe-mint,\\u201d a memory-erasing potion. Magical ability is latent and variable, but can be developed through education and deployed through contracts and complex hand gestures called \\u201ccradling.\\u201d\", \"Sir Robin Blyth learns all this by accident. Mistakenly installed as an assistant in the Office of Special Domestic Affairs and Complaints when the post\\u2019s previous occupant goes missing, Robin is \\u201cunbusheled\\u201d by Edwin Courcey, a magician of negligible power who has been given the chore of liaising with the mundane British government. Robin is athletic and kind, a recently orphaned scion of wealthy philanthropists; Edwin is a grouchy scholar burdened with a great deal of family. But as they work together to unpack the disappearance of Robin\\u2019s predecessor, they grow to understand, support and enjoy each other.\", \"Despite an unnecessary prologue that had me bracing for an irritating read, this proved to be a delightful book, with richly developed characters rooted in family dynamics and period flavor. It manages the remarkable trick of introducing a trilogy while being satisfying in its own right, leaving plenty to explore in future volumes while completing a complex story in this one. It\\u2019s certain to be well received by fans of C.L. Polk\\u2019s \\u201cWitchmark\\u201d and Everina Maxwell\\u2019s \\u201cWinter\\u2019s Orbit,\\u201d as well as anyone with a weakness for William Morris prints and tender, difficult romances between opposites.\", \"Tade Thompson\\u2019s FAR FROM THE LIGHT OF HEAVEN (Orbit, 370 pp., paper, $17.99) is, among other things, a locked-room murder mystery set on a spaceship light-years from Earth. Michelle Campion, or Shell, has trained for interstellar travel her whole life; her first mission is on Ragtime, a ship powered by artificial intelligence, accompanying 1,000 comatose humans through a wormhole to a planet in another solar system. Shell\\u2019s job is to sleep for 10 years alongside her passengers while Ragtime keeps the ship running, docks at Space Station Lagos for maintenance and proceeds to orbit Bloodroot, the destination planet. Instead, she wakes up to find that the A.I. has been tampered with, multiple passengers have been gruesomely murdered and the culprit is still at large. Bloodroot\\u2019s government sends up a disgraced detective named Rasheed Fin and his artificial friend Salvo to investigate \\u2014 but the more they dig into the mystery, the more hostile the ship\\u2019s environment becomes.\", \"\\u201cFar From the Light of Heaven\\u201d is an intriguing mix of real space science and mystery: It\\u2019s \\u201cGravity\\u201d meets \\u201cThe Murders in the Rue Morgue.\\u201d Its short, choppy chapters are both methodical and kaleidoscopic, introducing new characters in flashes and bursts; there\\u2019s a remote precision to the writing that succeeds in projecting both the stakes and wonder of a spacewalk. That experience is sometimes disorienting and sometimes curt; some abrupt twists of plot are less developments than dismissals, suggesting an authorial impatience with a narrative I found completely engrossing. I would have loved more time spent with space bureaucracy and character histories, but I\\u2019ll keep my fingers crossed for any of the several potential sequel hooks to build into a follow-up.\", \"Bringing questions about artificial intelligence closer to home, AI 2041 (Currency, 448 pp., $30) is a fascinating collaboration between Kai-Fu Lee, the former president of Google China, and Chen Quifan, the current president of the World Chinese Science Fiction Association. Conceived as a project of \\u201cscientific fiction,\\u201d it unites Lee\\u2019s extensive expertise in artificial intelligence with Quifan\\u2019s speculative inquiry: The collection contains 10 of Quifan\\u2019s short stories, all centering on aspects of A.I. development, each with a supplementary essay by Lee placing that story\\u2019s themes in our contemporary technological context.\", \"Set in 2041, and originally written in Chinese, Quifan\\u2019s stories are lucidly translated by Emily Jin, Andy Dudak, Blake Stone-Banks and Benjamin Zhou. They are refreshingly international in scope \\u2014 we visit Nigeria, Sri Lanka, Japan, Korea, China, India and Qatar, among other places \\u2014 and explore topics such as algorithm bias, deepfakes, self-driving vehicles and automation-induced mass unemployment.\", \"Quifan and Lee each have introductions to the volume; Lee puts forth their methodology in his: \\u201cI first created a \\u2018technology map\\u2019 that projected when certain technologies would mature.\\u201d He accounted for \\u201cstory-worthy conflicts and dilemmas that might emerge alongside these technologies. \\u2026 Quifan then flexed his talents.\\u201d\", \"Lee hopes the stories will appeal to people who don\\u2019t read fiction \\u2014 but one wishes the authors had tried harder to appeal to those who do. These pieces are illustrations of concepts first, and stories second; in order to foreground contemporary technologies, Quifan leaves several of fiction\\u2019s tools \\u2014 most notably voice and point of view \\u2014 on the shelf. Some stories transcend the didactic aloofness of the whole: \\u201cTwin Sparrows,\\u201d about orphaned brothers who learn to love each other despite their differences, and \\u201cMy Haunting Idol,\\u201d about the toxic nature of certain kinds of celebrity, are particularly moving.\", \"In several stories, A.I. is used to deceive people \\u2014 in a way that\\u2019s revealed to be for their own good. It\\u2019s an ironic pattern in a project so earnestly concerned with clarity and pedagogy: While the book argues for technology\\u2019s inherent neutrality, the stories themselves push forward and excuse a certain paternalism. The stories and essays both have a tendency to obscure their premises in pursuit of specific outcomes, and the more they speculate about social impacts, the less they stand up to scrutiny. Overall, though, \\u201cAI 2041\\u201d is a worthy addition to the canon of A.I. imaginary, an impressive collaboration and a good book to start arguments with \\u2014 whether on your own or with a friend.\", \"Originally published in Korea in 2006, Un-su Kim\\u2019s THE CABINET (Angry Robot Books, 301 pp., paper, $14.99) is narrated by an administrative worker named Kong Deok-geun who, while navigating the extreme boredom of his office job, discovers Cabinet 13: a filing cabinet filled with extraordinary accounts of \\u201csymptomers,\\u201d people experiencing strange and marvelous occurrences and abilities. Overseen by the crotchety Professor Kwon, symptomers describe sleeping for months (\\u201ctorporers\\u201d), seeing their doubles (\\u201cdoppelg\\u00e4ngers\\u201d) and growing gingko trees from their fingers (\\u201cchimeras\\u201d). It becomes Kong\\u2019s job to interview and console these people, whose symptoms often obstruct their ability to function within society. Kong\\u2019s own life \\u2014 his mundanity and mediocrity \\u2014 gradually becomes a needle threading the Cabinet reports together, as Professor Kwon\\u2019s health declines and a sinister apparatus called the syndicate begins pressing Kong to turn the contents of the Cabinet over to them.\", \"\\u201cThe Cabinet\\u201d is a sly, whimsical satire of life in late-stage capitalism, slippery and surreal, and reads in some respects like historical fiction: It was written and published before the ubiquity of smartphones and social media, and there\\u2019s something almost \\u2014 almost \\u2014 refreshing about the humdrum monotony of office life, away from the polluted water cooler of our current digital landscape. Kong\\u2019s matter-of-fact voice, conveyed in a sprightly and hilarious translation by Sean Lin Halbert, is a pitch-perfect foil to the \\u201csymptoms\\u201d he describes. By grounding them amid joyless, life-leeching work, the assembled files don\\u2019t make up a Wunderkammer so much as a Banalkammer, a cabinet not of curiosities but of mundanities, in which the most astonishing occurrences share space with gray, draining reality.\", \"\\u201cThe Cabinet\\u201d is a kind of echoing chamber in which the comic, heartbreaking and terrifying bounce against, amplify and distort one another. The ending bears down on the reader like teeth, and may seem, at first glance, like a sharp and sudden betrayal of its main affect. But its end is in its beginning, which rewards rereading.\", \"Natashia De\\u00f3n\\u2019s THE PERISHING (Counterpoint, 307 pp., $26) is a supple exploration of life in 1930s Los Angeles as well as a moving meditation on the Black American experience in the 20th century; it draws on patterns and histories of racial solidarity and oppression to tell a loving story of people and their relationships with places. Told mostly through the perspective of Lou Willard, a young Black woman hired to work the death desk at The Los Angeles Times, \\u201cThe Perishing\\u201d weaves in major events such as the building of Route 66 and the failure of the St. Francis Dam, while gesturing toward tragedies in Lou\\u2019s previous and future lives, glimpsed in mixtures of memory and dream.\", \"De\\u00f3n\\u2019s prose is beautiful, and the voice animating \\u201cThe Perishing\\u201d is heartfelt. But this is not a book interested in the structure it proposes at the outset: that of an immortal intelligence, one of several, who moves from life to life doing good. While Lou\\u2019s story is the core of the book, it\\u2019s often interrupted, peeled back, doubled over, in order for her future incarnation, Sarah Shipley \\u2014 standing trial for murder in the year 2102 \\u2014 to comment on or explicate it. This means that we\\u2019re never wondering who Lou is, why she can\\u2019t remember her childhood, or why she heals supernaturally quickly \\u2014 but instead are left to wonder why we\\u2019re seeing haphazardly deployed pieces of previous lives that have little to do with Sarah\\u2019s story, Lou\\u2019s story or the story of the immortals in aggregate.\", \"Overall, \\u201cThe Perishing\\u201d pulses with moments, phrases, passages that are deeply affecting and could have formed an organizing principle for the whole: the wonderful irony of an immortal working at a newspaper\\u2019s death desk; the wrenching instance of a 1930s Black woman grieving the future killing of Latasha Harlins; the notion of a community of immortal spirits being hunted by someone outside of it. The book embraces none of those \\u2014 but while it doesn\\u2019t cohere, or close the framing stories with which it opens, the window it maintains on Lou\\u2019s life shows a vibrant, immersive world that\\u2019s worth spending time in, learning and remembering.\"]","href_hash":"777ecfcc544411ec977cefb6d227293f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"777ecfcc544411ec977cefb6d227293f"}},
