But some said what was most significant about the current moment was its potential to usher in history.\", \"New York has had 109 mayors; Eric Adams, the Democratic nominee, would be only the second Black man to take the city\\u2019s helm if he wins.\", \"To Djene Keita, 30, who is Black, voting for Mr. Adams felt like casting a vote for her young son\\u2019s future. \\u201cJust having someone for him to look up to and be inspired by would be great,\\u201d said Ms. Keita, who is from Harlem.\", \"Mark Godfrey, 65 said Mr. Adams\\u2019s ascendance felt similarly personal, a sign of \\u201csubtle changes that are occurring in the U.S.\\u201d in racial equity and representation.\", \"Mr. Godfrey, a resident of Ozone Park in Queens who said he was an independent, said Mr. Adams\\u2019 identity as a Black man and his experiences as a police officer and a victim of police brutality meant that he \\u201cunderstands what being profiled is like.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Godfrey said he hoped those experiences would give Mr. Adams a unique and valuable perspective if he takes office.\", \"David N. Dinkins, the city\\u2019s first Black mayor, was elected to a single term in 1989 and died in 2020. He has been remembered as a mentor who inspired other Black leaders to run for office.\", \"Some voters like Esmirna Flores, 38, recalled watching Mr. Dinkins as mayor as they cast their ballots on Tuesday. The chance to elect a second Black mayor was \\u201cabsolutely awesome,\\u201d said Ms. Flores, who is Latina and lives in the Kingsbridge area of the Bronx.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s about time that we have more Black representatives, more brown people representing,\\u201d she said.\", \"Still, others like Mable Ivory, 45, a Black voter in Harlem, said they saw Mr. Adams\\u2019s history-making potential as something positive, but noted that it did not play a significant role in shaping their vote or compelling them to head to the polls.\", \"There were also mixed feelings among some voters, who appreciated the possible landmark, but disagreed with aspects of Mr. Adams\\u2019s platform.\", \"Gabriel Knott, 27, called the milestone an \\u201cimportant step forward.\\u201d But he said he remained unsure whether Mr. Adams was the best option for the job among the many Democrats he beat in June\\u2019s primary.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s really key to kind of consider what is he going to do for those communities in New York City,\\u201d said Mr. Knott, who is from the Greenpoint neighborhood of Brooklyn. \\u201cBut I think that it\\u2019s really still significant.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"acc4da443c0911eca356000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"acc4da443c0911eca356000017025a03"}},
