illustrating nothing can grow forever.\", \"\\\"It's not happening quickly but we do expect that to continue throughout the year.\", \"\\\"We know that with the level of prices they are at, increasing interest rates, credit tightening up from the banks, we do think that is going to impact the level of demand.\\\"\", \"Goodall said there are more properties available for sale today than at any time in the last two years which will reduce pressure on prices.\", \"The key question is whether buyers will see prices drop, he said.\", \"\\\"Without a combined increase in unemployment where people are unable to pay their mortgages we're not expecting a drop in prices necessarily but a slower rate of growth, before the end of the year where things might flatten out a bit.\\\"\", \"2021 also left the country with an average value of homes exceeding one million dollars to now sit at $1,006,632.\", \"Auckland is the most expensive place to buy with the average price at $1.42m, closely followed by Tauranga and Wellington which also have six-figure averages: at $1,139,186 and $1,125,729 respectively.\", \"Goodall said in the provincial centres there is still a wide range of property value.\", \"\\\"Within each of these markets there's still going to be properties that are in that $400,000 mark which is still relatively accessible for first home buyers.\", \"\\\"Of course, you need to have a job in those places if you are looking to move there and that is the key question: can you sustain a living in those places if you do choose to go and buy a property.\\\"\", \"Independent economist Tony Alexander said one of the reasons house prices had risen were people doing things backwards - first buying a home, then doing their OE.\", \"He believes one of the biggest changes 2022 will bring is the number of first home buyers moving overseas.\", \"\\\"A lot of them, quite frankly are likely to be looking over to Australia for the strong high level of wages, lower house prices, and lower cost of living and the opportunities available over there.\", \"\\\"That will feed into some extra calming of the housing market this year.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/284062/eight_col_houses_in_Mel.jpg?1641429834\\\" alt=\\\"Melbourne, Australia -
