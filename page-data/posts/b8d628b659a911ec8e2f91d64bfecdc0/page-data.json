She was sentenced in December 2020 to 60 months of probation and ordered to forfeit a Tiffany diamond ring, according to the U.S. Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General.\", \"Mr. Irizarry, who had worked for the D.E.A. in Miami, Cartagena, Colombia, and Washington before he resigned in 2018, was arrested in February 2020 along with Ms. Gomez-Irizarry near their home in San Juan, P.R.\", \"In a 19-count indictment, Mr. Irizarry was accused of engaging in a \\u201ccorrupt scheme\\u201d while he was assigned to investigate money laundering by drug-trafficking organizations. The indictment accused Mr. Irizarry of \\u201cenriching himself by secretly using his position and his special access to information to divert drug proceeds from D.E.A. control to the control of himself and his co-conspirators.\\u201d\", \"One co-conspirator was identified in the indictment as a public official in Colombia, who prosecutors said had used drug money to buy a $329,000 Lamborghini Hurac\\u00e1n Spyder from a Miami car dealership.\", \"Mr. Irizarry was accused of using drug money to buy a Land Rover and a home in Cartagena. Prosecutors said that Mr. Irizarry had admitted that he began exploiting his position as a federal agent to enrich himself and his co-conspirators soon after he filed for bankruptcy in 2010.\", \"The indictment described a sprawling scheme in which Mr. Irizarry filed false reports on investigations, prompting a ripple effect that caused his colleagues at the Drug Enforcement Administration to falsely document the details of wire transfers, unwittingly concealing the source of drug profits that he controlled.\", \"Ms. Gomez-Irizarry was accused of running a shell company out of the couple\\u2019s home in Miramar, Fla., that had no employees and sold no goods but was used to take in and distribute the money her husband collected, the indictment said.\", \"\\u201cFormer Special Agent Irizarry abused the trust of the American people when he repeatedly violated his oath as a federal law enforcement officer,\\u201d Anne Milgram, the D.E.A. administrator, said in a statement on Thursday. \\u201cBringing him to justice reflects the principles of those who faithfully serve and uphold the values of D.E.A.\\u201d\", \"At his sentencing in federal court in Tampa, Mr. Irizarry wept and said that his biggest punishment was not being able to explain to his two young daughters why he would be gone for so long, The Associated Press reported. He said he had been proud when he became a federal agent two decades ago.\", \"\\u201cUnfortunately, there came a time when I made a decision that went against the person who I was, that damaged my wife and embarrassed my country,\\u201d Mr. Irizarry said, according to The A.P. \\u201cI should\\u2019ve known better and I didn\\u2019t. I failed.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Irizarry\\u2019s sentencing came after another former special agent with the D.E.A., Chad Allan Scott, was sentenced in August to more than 13 years in prison after he perjured himself and directed others to commit perjury to obtain a conviction against an accused drug dealer, prosecutors said. Mr. Scott also falsified forms so that he could take possession of a truck that a drug dealer bought for him, prosecutors said.\", \"Mr. Irizarry\\u2019s lawyer, Maria A. Dominguez, blamed the culture at the D.E.A. for encouraging such crimes.\", \"\\u201cJose was not a leader or the author of this conduct,\\u201d she said in an interview on Thursday. \\u201cIt was conduct that he encountered when he first joined the D.E.A. He was corrupted in that sort of environment, which disrupted his moral compass.\\u201d\", \"While sentencing Mr. Irizarry, Judge Charlene Honeywell condemned the D.E.A. for its failings and said other agents corrupted by \\u201cthe allure of easy money\\u201d should be investigated, The A.P. reported.\", \"\\u201cThis has to stop,\\u201d Judge Honeywell said, according to The A.P. \\u201cYou were the one who got caught, but it is apparent to this court that there are others.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b8d628b659a911ec8e2f91d64bfecdc0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b8d628b659a911ec8e2f91d64bfecdc0"}},
