Apple said from late October to mid-November of 2020, the woman emailed Cook approximately 200 times.\", \"In early November 2020, she allegedly sent a series of emails to Cook that contained threats and photos of a gun and ammunition.

She allegedly demanded to speak with Cook and was turned away by security, but returned minutes later.\", \"Local police officers responded to the alleged trespassing call and stopped the woman when she tried to flee the scene. According to court documents, she was driving a Porsche Macan with an expired driver's license and told local police officers who confronted her that she \\\"could get violent.\\\"\", \"Officers searched the vehicle but did not find any weapons.\", \"Apple said the woman continued to email Cook after showing up at his house and in mid-December demanded a payment. According to court documents, she wrote in an email on December 18 that \\\"we do not have to meet. give me 500 millions cash. then I will forget and forgive all better list to me.\\\"\", \"On New Year's Day, the woman allegedly posted on Twitter that \\\"Tim Cook will be suicided in his condo.\\\" She allegedly followed that up with an email to Cook stating \\\"you must empty the condo,\\\" adding, \\\"I will move in next week 2nd warning.\\\"\", \"Apple declined to comment.
