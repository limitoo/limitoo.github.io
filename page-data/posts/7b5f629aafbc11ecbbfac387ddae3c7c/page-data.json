It\\u2019s not particularly political, and our statute book is a relatively high quality statute book as a result of that.\\u201d\", \"He\\u2019s right. Here\\u2019s an example of one way that \\u201cconventional approach\\u201d works. One bill currently being considered by Parliament is the Accident Compensation (Maternal Birth Injury and Other Matters) Amendment Bill.\", \"Yes, bills have long, convoluted names - but there are reasons for that.\", \"This bill ends with the words \\u201cAmendment Bill\\u201d which tells you that it will make changes to a law that already exists.\\u00a0\", \"That suffix also tells you that it isn\\u2019t agreed law yet. A \\u201cBill\\u201d is legislation still under consideration. An agreed law\\u00a0is called an \\u201cAct\\u201d.\\u00a0\", \"The law it will amend is also listed there. That\\u2019s the first part of the name (\\u201cAccident Compensation\\u201d).\\u00a0So the bill will make changes to the Accident Compensation Act 2001. The date at the end of the act\\u2019s name tells you when the underlying legislation was originally passed.\\u00a0\", \"\\u2018But what changes will it make?\\u2019 I hear you cry. (Call it an auditory hallucination if you must).\\u00a0\", \"The planned area of change is described in the brackets after the name of the act it will amend. In this case the Bill plans to make changes to how the ACC act deals with \\u201cMaternal Birth Injury\\u201d as well as a few related \\u201cother matters\\u201d.\\u00a0\", \"And we can be pretty confident that the \\u201cother matters\\u201d in the title are related to that core intent because the rules for New Zealand laws are strict about that. Except in specific and special circumstances bills must have a single, unified policy objective.\", \"New Zealand laws are really very WYSIWYG. They do what it\\u00a0says on the box. That also means that\\u00a0MPs can\\u2019t add unrelated provisions, or pork, or earmarks\\u00a0to law as is common in the US. Nothing extra is allowed. That rule must save a lot of money.\\u00a0\", \"When bills that are titled \\u2018amendment bills\\u2019 get passed and become law\\u2026 they vanish. Fear not, all that effort wasn\\u2019t for nothing.\", \"All the changes that the amendment bill wants to make to the core legislation are made and, job done, the bill melts away like Keyser Soze, or the Wicked Witch of the West.\", \"As a result you will never see the word \\u201camendment\\u201d in the name of an act. The now amended core legislation keeps its name, even if, like Washington\\u2019s Axe it is slowly, over the years, amended utterly.\\u00a0\", \"One more thing to note. If a bill does not say \\u201cAmendment\\u201d in its title it is either:\", \"For example this week Parliament looks likely to approve the\\u00a0Protected Disclosures (Protection of Whistleblowers) Bill.\", \"Feel free to decode the name of that bill from what you now know.\", \"In this case the Bill changes existing whistleblower legislation but rather than tweaking it, it just rewrites it entirely.\\u00a0So it drops the \\u2018amendment\\u2019 suffix.\", \"If you want a description of the Bill you can listen to Chris Hipkins in the audio above.\"]","href_hash":"7b5f629aafbc11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7b5f629aafbc11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
