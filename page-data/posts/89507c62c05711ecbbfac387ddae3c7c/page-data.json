Habba wrote that she informed the attorney general's office that Trump's eponymous company may have the documents being sought, which include personal statements of financial condition, tax audit materials and insurance-related documents.\", \"\\\"While this result may be to the (Attorney General's) dissatisfaction, the fact is that a diligent search was performed and found that (Trump) is not in possession of any of the requested documents,\\\" Habba wrote.\\u00a0\", \"James' office also requested that Trump be fined $10,000 a day until he complies with the ruling. Habba called the proposed fine \\\"excessive\\\" in Tuesday's filing.\", \"In its April 7 filing, James' office also accused the Trump Organization of \\\"restricting\\\" a third-party firm tasked with conducting discovery in the case.\", \"Trump and two of his children, Donald Trump Jr. and Ivanka Trump, were ordered on Feb. 17 to\\u00a0appear for depositions\\u00a0in James'\\u00a0long-running civil fraud probe. They appealed the order to appear, but did not at that time challenge a separate part of that ruling in which Trump was ordered to comply with a subpoena \\\"seeking documents and information.\\\"\", \"The judge ordered Trump to comply with the demand for documents and information by March 3, and later extended that deadline to March 31 \\u2014 a date that was agreed to by both sides at the time, according to a court documents.\\u00a0\", \"James' office did not immediately return a request for comment. On April 7, she said in a statement that, \\\"Instead of obeying a court order, Mr. Trump is trying to evade it.\\\"\", \"James' office claimed in a February press release that its wide-ranging investigation has collected evidence \\\"showing that Donald J. Trump and the Trump Organization used fraudulent and misleading financial statements to obtain economic benefit.\\\" The initial focus of the probe was on whether the Trump Organization inflated the valuations of assets while seeking loans and insurance coverage, and deflated their value to reduce tax liability. \\u00a0\", \"James' investigation was cited by accounting firm Mazars USA in a Feb. 9 letter\\u00a0recanting a decade of financial statements\\u00a0compiled for the Trump Organization. As part of its probe, James' office is also\\u00a0seeking information from a second accounting firm\\u00a0that did work for Trump's company, RSM US LLP.\", \"On April 8, James' office filed a motion to compel the real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield to comply with subpoenas related to appraisal work done on several Trump properties. A company spokesperson said in an April 11 statement to CBS News that \\\"any suggestion that Cushman & Wakefield has not responded in good faith to the Attorney General's investigation is fundamentally untrue.\\\"\", \"Trump and his company have repeatedly denied all allegations of wrongdoing.
