Walsh, had the backing of the city\\u2019s traditional power centers, like its police, its trade unions and its working-class Irish American neighborhoods.\", \"\\u201cFrom every corner of our city, Boston has spoken,\\u201d Ms. Wu said, to a jubilant crowd in the city\\u2019s South End. \\u201cWe are ready to meet the moment. We are ready to be a Boston for everyone.\\u201d\", \"Conceding the race, Ms. Essaibi George said, \\u201cI want to offer a great big congratulations to Michelle Wu.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cShe is the first woman, first person of color, and as an Asian American, the first elected to be mayor of Boston,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI know this is no small feat.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Wu \\u2014 who grew up outside Chicago and moved to the Boston area to attend Harvard \\u2014 was an unusual candidate for this city, and her victory sets a number of precedents. Upon taking office later this month, she will be the only Asian American mayor in a large U.S. city outside California and Texas.\", \"Ms. Wu is the first woman and the first person of color to be elected mayor in Boston, which has been led by an unbroken string of Irish American or Italian American men since the 1930s. Kim Janey, a Black woman, has served as acting mayor since March, when Mr. Walsh was confirmed as the U.S. labor secretary. Ms. Wu will also be the first mayor of Boston not born in the city since 1925.\", \"Malaysia Fuller-Staten, 24, an organizer from Roxbury, was ebullient as returns came in, saying the scale of Ms. Wu\\u2019s victory would shatter the image of Boston as conservative and insular.\", \"\\u201cBoston is so much an old boys\\u2019 club,\\u201d she said. \\u201cFor her to win by that margin, it would be saying to everyone, Boston is not a center-right city. It would be saying, we are a city looking to change.\\u201d\", \"Born shortly after her parents immigrated to the United States from Taiwan, Ms. Wu spent her childhood interpreting for them as they tried to negotiate bureaucracy in the United States. She was deeply shaken in her 20s, when her mother had a mental health crisis, forcing her to step away from her career to care for the family.\", \"Emerging from that experience, she plunged into a career in public service.\", \"She developed a close relationship with Elizabeth Warren, one of her professors at Harvard Law School, who became the state\\u2019s progressive standard-bearer and helped launch her in politics.\", \"As a Boston city councilor, Ms. Wu often attended meetings with her babies, a sight that announced change for a body that, throughout its history, had been dominated by white men.\", \"State Representative Aaron Michlewitz, a longtime friend and supporter, described Ms. Wu\\u2019s victory as the culmination of years of disciplined work on the nitty-gritty of governing.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not always flashy, it\\u2019s not always something that gets a headline,\\u201d he said. \\u201cShe doesn\\u2019t come off as this huge presence when she walks into a room necessarily. But over time she chips away at the issues you care about. You start realizing how dedicated she is to the craft and to the work.\\u201d\", \"Boston has been booming, as jobs in technology, medicine and education attract waves of young professionals. But that success has come at a cost, forcing working-class and middle-class families to leave the city in search of affordable housing.\", \"Ms. Wu has promised to push back against gentrification, with policies tailored to help lower-income residents stay in the city, such as waiving fees for public transport, imposing a form of rent control, and reapportioning city contracts to firms owned by Black Bostonians.\", \"It will not be easy for her to deliver. Rent control, for example, has been illegal in Massachusetts since 1994, so restoring it would require the passage of statewide legislation. The most recent effort to roll back the ban on rent control was rejected resoundingly by legislators last year, by a vote of 23 to 136.\", \"Her plans to restructure the city\\u2019s planning agency have worried many in the real estate and building sectors, which thrived while Mr. Walsh was mayor. And Ms. Wu will have to take control of a sprawling government apparatus whose powerful constituencies can slow or block a new mayor\\u2019s agenda.\", \"Wilnelia Rivera, a political consultant who supported Ms. Wu, said she would face pushback.\", \"\\u201cThe reality about power is that it never wants to give up any, and we\\u2019ll see what that looks like once we cross that bridge,\\u201d she said. \\u201cShe is going to have to recreate that power coalition. It would be nice to have a mayor who isn\\u2019t necessarily in the back pocket of all the power players in the city.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Wu comes in with high expectations for change, and will face pressure to move swiftly. One of the city\\u2019s most popular progressive figures, District Attorney Rachael Rollins of Suffolk County, warned that she ran the risk of disappointing many who have backed her.\", \"\\u201cWhat I won\\u2019t do is allow our community to be sold a bill of goods and then when someone gets into the office, nothing happens,\\u201d she said.\", \"Ms. Wu has responded repeatedly to such concerns throughout her campaign.\", \"\\u201cThe history and legacy of Boston as a city is one of putting forward bold vision to reshape what\\u2019s possible and then fighting for what our residents need,\\u201d she said, listing challenges she took on as a city councilor, like introducing a pilot program for fare-free public transport.\", \"\\u201cTime and again, when people said it would be impossible,\\u201d she said, \\u201cwe got it done.\\u201d\", \"As they left polling places on Tuesday, several voters described the race as a turning point for Boston, which has elected a long line of men from the white, working-class, pro-union wing of the Democratic Party.\", \"\\u201cChange in this city has taken a long time to come,\\u201d said Andrew Conant, 28, a filmmaker. \\u201cThis is a very proud moment for my city.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"1a7725ce3c5511ec8694000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1a7725ce3c5511ec8694000017025a03"}},
