They can send a defendant off to years in prison, or even to death row. Most wield this power honorably. Yet, when prosecutors don\\u2019t, they rarely pay a price, even for repeated and egregious misconduct that puts innocent people behind bars.\", \"Why? Because they are protected by layers of silence and secrecy that are written into local, state and federal policy, shielding them from any real accountability for wrongdoing.\", \"New York City offers a prime example of a problem endemic to the nation. Consider the city\\u2019s official reaction to the barrelful of misconduct in Queens that a group of law professors recently brought to light. As The Times reported last month, the professors filed grievances against 21 prosecutors in the borough \\u2014 for everything from lying in open court to withholding key evidence from the defense \\u2014 and then posted those grievances to a public website.\", \"These weren\\u2019t close calls. In every instance an appeals court had made a finding of prosecutorial misconduct; in many cases the misconduct was so severe that it required overturning a guilty verdict and releasing someone from prison. Three men wrongfully convicted of a 1996 murder were exonerated after 24 years behind bars. But that rectified only the most glaring injustice. To date, none of the prosecutors have faced any public consequences. Some are still working.\", \"How did the city respond to this litany of widespread misconduct by its own agents? It went after the professors who publicized it.\", \"In a letter to the committee that handles misconduct charges, New York City\\u2019s top lawyer, known as the corporation counsel, accused the professors of abusing the grievance process \\u201cto promote a political agenda\\u201d and of violating a state law that requires formal complaints about lawyers\\u2019 conduct to be kept secret unless judicial authorities decide otherwise. (They virtually never do.) The grievance committee agreed to punish the professors by denying them access to any future updates on their complaints \\u2014 even though state law requires that complainants be kept informed throughout the process. The upshot is that the committee could dismiss the complaints tomorrow and no one would know.\", \"For good measure, the corporation counsel then sought to keep secret the letter requesting the professors be punished for violating the secrecy law. This isn\\u2019t just shooting the messenger; it\\u2019s tossing the gun into the East River and threatening anyone who tries to fish it out.\", \"We know about all this because the professors sued the city in federal court, claiming that the secrecy law infringes on the First Amendment. How could it not? If someone tells a Times reporter about a prosecutor\\u2019s misconduct, the reporter is free to write a story addressing those allegations for all the world to see. But if the same person files a formal grievance about the same misconduct with the state, she\\u2019s barred from talking about it. It\\u2019s not even clear what the punishment for violating the law would be \\u2014 as evidenced by the fact that dozens of prominent lawyers, including former New York judges and even prosecutors, went public with grievances they filed against Rudy Giuliani over his role in Donald Trump\\u2019s efforts to subvert the 2020 election and encourage the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. To date, none of these lawyers have faced public sanctions for speaking to the press.\", \"In theory, the secrecy law exists to protect lawyers from being smeared by frivolous complaints, but that rationale makes no sense when applied to prosecutors, who are public officials doing the state\\u2019s work. In the Queens cases, their misconduct is already a matter of public record. Even if it weren\\u2019t, there is no principled reason to prevent the public airing of complaints \\u2014 not to mention public hearings \\u2014 against officials who have the power to send people to prison. Certainly the defendants they face off against in court don\\u2019t enjoy such privileges.\", \"New York shelters its lawyers from disciplinary measures more than most states in the country, even as it ranks near the top in total number of exonerations \\u2014 a majority of which are the result of misconduct by prosecutors.\", \"Meanwhile, the few attempts to increase oversight of New York prosecutors have been stymied. A 2018 law established a commission specifically to deal with prosecutorial misconduct in a more independent and transparent way. But the state district attorneys\\u2019 association challenged it and a court struck it down as unconstitutional. Lawmakers designed a new commission this year, but it appears that no commissioners have yet been appointed to it.\", \"New York\\u2019s prosecutor-protection racket is, alas, far from unique. In Washington, the Justice Department aggressively shields its own prosecutors from outside accountability thanks to a 1988 law that lets the agency essentially police itself. All other federal agencies \\u2014 and even parts of the Justice Department, like the F.B.I. and the Drug Enforcement Administration \\u2014 are subject to oversight by independent inspectors general, who conduct thorough investigations and issue lengthy reports with their findings. Federal prosecutors skate by on an internal review process that is run out of the Office of Professional Responsibility, whose head is appointed by, and reports directly to, the attorney general. The office almost never makes its findings public, and when it does it often provides only a brief summary months after the fact. In the words of one legal-ethics expert, it\\u2019s a \\u201cblack hole.\\u201d (By contrast, the inspector general\\u2019s office of the Justice Department just released its semiannual report, as it is required to do by law, detailing the 52 reports it issued between April and September of this year, as well as the closing of investigations that resulted in 68 convictions or guilty pleas and 66 firings, resignations or disciplinary actions.)\", \"The level of scrutiny that federal prosecutors are subject to matters so much because they are just as prone to misconduct as their state and local counterparts. Take the botched prosecution of former Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska on corruption charges, or the legal green light Justice Department lawyers gave interrogators to torture terrorism suspects, or the more recent revelation that Jeffrey Epstein, the sexual predator, got a sweetheart deal in 2008 from his prosecutor, Alex Acosta, who later became labor secretary in the Trump administration. Yet in the latter two cases, the Office of Professional Responsibility found no misconduct. Mr. Acosta was guilty only of \\u201cpoor judgment,\\u201d the office said. In the Stevens case, the office found misconduct but said it was unintentional, and it let the prosecutors off with a slap on the wrist. Have there been other similarly egregious failures to hold prosecutors to account? Almost certainly. But we don\\u2019t know because the Justice Department doesn\\u2019t tell us.\", \"There is no principled reason for federal prosecutors to avoid the accountability expected of all public servants. Their exemption from the general rule was adopted in 1988 as a favor to Dick Thornburgh, who was then the attorney general and had tried to derail the creation of an inspector general for the Justice Department. Years later, Mr. Thornburgh admitted he had been wrong. \\u201cThis is a highly professional operation that goes where the evidence leads and is not directed by the way the political winds are blowing,\\u201d he said at a gathering marking the law\\u2019s 25th anniversary in 2014. \\u201cI\\u2019ve come to be a true believer.\\u201d\", \"So have large numbers of Republicans and Democrats in Congress, a remarkable fact at a moment when the parties can\\u2019t agree on the time of day. Their fix is straightforward: Eliminate the loophole in the 1988 law and empower the inspector general to review claims against federal prosecutors, just as the office currently does in cases involving other Justice Department employees. A Senate bill co-sponsored by Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, and Dick Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, would do exactly this. Yet Attorney General Merrick Garland is continuing in the tradition of his predecessors by opposing any change to the existing system.\", \"Prosecutors can work in the interests of fairness and justice, but they can also cheat and destroy people\\u2019s lives. They should be held accountable when they do \\u2014 both to vindicate their victims and to help ensure that they can\\u2019t do it again.\"]","href_hash":"bce6548e554011ec9c9dbbbd177f9445"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bce6548e554011ec9c9dbbbd177f9445"}},
