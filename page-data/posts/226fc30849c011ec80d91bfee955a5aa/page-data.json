But the not-guilty verdicts in the trial will not be the final word on those events.\", \"Civil lawsuits are pending in federal court that accuse the authorities of wrongdoing, both during the turbulence in the city and in the police shooting that instigated it. Here is a look at some of the unresolved cases.\", \"The episode that first prompted the angry demonstrations in Kenosha was the shooting of Jacob Blake by a Kenosha police officer, Rusten Sheskey, on Aug. 23, 2020. Mr. Blake was hit by seven shots \\u2014 including several that struck him in the back \\u2014 in an encounter that was captured on video. Acts of arson and vandalism during and after the demonstrations are what drew some armed civilians, including Mr. Rittenhouse, to downtown Kenosha. They have said they intended to guard businesses.\", \"Michael Graveley, the Kenosha County district attorney, announced in January that neither Officer Sheskey nor Mr. Blake, who had a knife when officers were struggling to arrest him on a warrant for a sexual assault charge, would be charged in connection with the encounter.\", \"Mr. Blake sued Officer Sheskey in federal court in March, saying that the officer violated his civil rights by using excessive force. Officer Sheskey\\u2019s lawyers have denied the allegations in court.\", \"The most serious charge in Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s trial, first-degree intentional homicide, concerns Anthony Huber, the second man Mr. Rittenhouse fatally shot on Aug. 25, 2020.\", \"Mr. Huber\\u2019s parents filed suit in federal court in August 2021 against the Kenosha Police Department, the Kenosha County Sheriff\\u2019s Department and others, including Sheriff David Beth and the current and former city police chiefs. The suit accuses the defendants, among other things, of allowing civilians like Mr. Rittenhouse to \\u201cpatrol the streets, armed with deadly weapons, to mete out justice as they saw fit,\\u201d and of actively enabling and conspiring with them.\", \"The suit portrays Mr. Huber as a \\u201chero\\u201d who tried to disarm Mr. Rittenhouse by hitting him with a skateboard after Mr. Rittenhouse had shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum.\", \"The defendants have filed motions asking the court to dismiss the case. A lawyer for the county defendants, Samuel Hall, called the allegations \\u201cdemonstrably false.\\u201d A lawyer for city officials declined to comment.\", \"Mr. Grosskreutz was the third man shot by Mr. Rittenhouse. He was badly wounded but survived, and he testified in Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s trial.\", \"His suit in federal court levels accusations similar to those in the Huber family\\u2019s lawsuit against several of the same defendants. The suit states that Mr. Grosskreutz, who was approaching Mr. Rittenhouse with a handgun when he was shot, lost 90 percent of his right biceps as a result.\", \"As of earlier this month, none of the authorities named as defendants had yet responded in court to Mr. Grosskreutz\\u2019s lawsuit. Mr. Hall, the lawyer for county officials, noted that Mr. Grosskreutz had not sued Mr. Rittenhouse.\", \"Mr. Grosskreutz\\u2019s lawyer, Kimberley Motley, also represents the estate of Mr. Rosenbaum, the first man Mr. Rittenhouse shot. No litigation has been filed so far on behalf of Mr. Rosenbaum\\u2019s survivors.\"]","href_hash":"226fc30849c011ec80d91bfee955a5aa"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"226fc30849c011ec80d91bfee955a5aa"}},
