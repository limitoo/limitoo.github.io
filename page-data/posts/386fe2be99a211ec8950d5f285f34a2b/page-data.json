Many believe their democratic rights at home may ultimately be jeopardised if they do nothing to defend Europe.\", \"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky called on Sunday for the formation of an \\\"international legion.\\\" Some young volunteers travelled straight to Ukraine to enlist.\", \"Others were applying at Ukrainian embassies and consulates before quitting jobs or dropping out of university.\", \"The mobilisation was taking place as Russian artillery bombarded Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, on Monday, the fifth day of conflict.\", \"\\\"I feel guilty to not go,\\\" said Dax, 26, a veteran of the elite US Army 82nd Airborne infantry division, who planned to deploy with other former US military personnel. Like many volunteers, the Alabama native declined to give his full name amid discussion on social media of the need to keep their identities and movements secret for security reasons.\", \"Canadian Bryson Woolsey quit his job as a cook on Sunday after seeing Zelensky's appeal. He has no military training and plans to buy a plane ticket to Poland, cross into Ukraine and volunteer for combat.\", \"\\\"I felt like I had to do something,\\\" said Woolsey, 33, of Powell River, British Columbia, who became restless as he watched images of wounded women and children in Ukraine.\", \"Canada's Foreign Minister Melanie Joly on Sunday told reporters it was up to individual Canadians to decide whether they wanted to join Ukraine's international brigade. A US State Department spokesperson, in an email to Reuters, said US citizens were urged not to travel to Ukraine.\", \"Not all volunteers wanted to fight.\", \"In Quebec, 35-year-old physician Julien Auger was preparing to leave his young family to become a medic with Ukraine's health ministry and provide \\\"neutral\\\" humanitarian aid.\", \"\\\"Global opinion and support is the key right now to solving the conflict,\\\" said Auger, a father of two who provides palliative care at a hospital in Saint-Jerome.\", \"In online groups, military veterans warned volunteers who lacked combat training they were heading into a conflict where inexperience could be a liability for themselves and others.\", \"That did not stop those like Tai B, 23, who studied journalism in New York.\", \"\\\"I'm not looking to be a hero, or a martyr, I just want to finally do something right,\\\" said Tai, who can cook, do basic mechanics and knows how to handle a firearm. He said he has contacted Ukraine's US Embassy staff about enlisting in Zelenskiy's \\\"international legion.\\\"\", \"Hyde, a 28-year-old from the US Midwest, said he was already in Kyiv and expected to start military training on Tuesday.\", \"\\\"I cannot bear the thought of Europe once again being plunged into warfare,\\\" said Hyde, who described himself as a gun enthusiast and avid survivalist with no combat experience. He expects to be given a helmet, body armour, knee pads and eventually a rifle.\", \"In Austin, Texas, a software developer said he would draw on his experience as a US Army cadet to fight for Ukraine.\", \"\\\"If they're willing to defend democracy then I think those that benefit from a democratic society are duty-bound to support them,\\\" said the 25-year-old, who asked that his name not be used.\", \"\\\"I'm not telling my parents until I head to the airport.\\\"\", \"- Reuters\"]","href_hash":"386fe2be99a211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"386fe2be99a211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
