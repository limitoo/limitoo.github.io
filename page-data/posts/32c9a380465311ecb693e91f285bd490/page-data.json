Said to be Tunisian-style and based on a recipe from Mr. Sercarz\\u2019s grandfather, these lemons are notable because they are not just cured in salt, but also steeped in olive oil and bolstered with harissa, for uncommon richness. The slices are excellent on their own as a relish to serve with meats and seafood, and are particularly delicious alongside smoked fish; chop a few tablespoons to fold into sweet potato pur\\u00e9e for Thanksgiving.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.
