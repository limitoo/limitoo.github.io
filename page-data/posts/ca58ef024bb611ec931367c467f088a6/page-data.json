At least five people were killed, including members of the Dancing Grannies club, and more than 40 were injured.\", \"Police apprehended one person, later identified as Brooks, 39, after they opened fire to try to stop the vehicle and the driver. Officials are expected to provide an update at 1 p.m. local time, which is 2 p.m. Eastern.\", \"The city of Waukesha didn't have a livestream set up yet, but it streamed every other press conference on its Facebook page so it's likely it will do so for the Monday update. Several news outlets, including NBC and Fox News, also livestreamed the previous updates, and it's possible Monday's press conference will be available on their social media pages as well.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937722/waukesha-christmas-parade-crash-live-stream-update.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Waukesha, Wisconsin, officials are expected to provide an update Monday afternoon on Sunday's deadly crash during a Christmas parade.

In the most recent case, which was filed November 5, he was accused of resisting or obstructing an officer, reckless homicide, disorderly conduct, bail jumping and battery.\", \"Court records also show a case was opened against Brooks in July 2020. He was charged with second-degree recklessly endangering safety and illegally possessing a firearm.\", \"Officials haven't said Brooks is a suspect in the incident and haven't provided any information about a possible motive. A law enforcement official who spoke to the Associated Press on the condition of anonymity said that he may have been fleeing a crime and that investigators were questioning a person in custody about an earlier crime involving a knife.\", \"In the wake of the tragedy, the Milwaukee Dancing Grannies posted on Facebook that they were \\\"devastated\\\" and that those who died were \\\"extremely passionate Grannies.\\\"\", \"\\\"Their eyes gleamed...joy of being a Grannie. They were the glue...held us together,\\\" the Facebook message said. \\\"Our group was doing what they loved, performing in front of crowds in a parade putting smiles on faces of all ages, filling them with joy and happiness.\\\"\", \"Along with the \\\"Grannies,\\\" the AP reported that a Catholic priest and Waukesha Catholic schoolchildren were among those injured.\", \"\\\"There were small children laying all over the road. There were police officers and EMTs doing CPR on multiple members of the parade,\\\" Chris Germain, co-owner of the Aspire Dance Center studio, told the AP.\"]","href_hash":"ca58ef024bb611ec931367c467f088a6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ca58ef024bb611ec931367c467f088a6"}},
