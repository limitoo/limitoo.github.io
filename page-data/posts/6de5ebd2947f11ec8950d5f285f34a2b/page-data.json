It's just so tough. We're really living in hope that we'll see a refreshment of the Home Start Grant, things like that, to get some good news on the first home buyer's front.

If you owe a million dollars, that's another $20,000 you might have to find. That's going to have a big impact.

It's a sector by sector thing where the hard times are, and that's why we've stepped up with some additional support. I'm sure some people will be looking at the way in which their loans are managed and whether or not interest rates will go up. But in terms of Omicron I'm sure we can get through this quickly and in good shape,\\\" Robertson said.\", \"He said it was one of the core roles of the Reserve Bank to manage inflation.\", \"By using the \\\"lever\\\" of interest rates he said they responded accordingly.\"]","href_hash":"6de5ebd2947f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6de5ebd2947f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
