She has continued to advocate the importance of vaccinations to those who may be hesitant.\", \"Ms. Lindsay said she had no idea that when she got the shot, she would be making history. She simply wanted to get vaccinated early to alleviate her own fears around the virus and to set an example for those in her community.\", \"\\u201cIt was like a huge weight was lifted off my shoulders,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd I felt like it was my civic duty, as well as my professional responsibility, to do my part. I look back now with a lot of pride, knowing that I did my part in helping to put an end to this pandemic.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Lindsay said that while she did receive plenty of critical comments from social media users, who questioned why a Black woman had to go first, the influx of positive messages thanking her for her bravery outweighed them.\", \"She also said she knew that the single act of receiving the vaccine won\\u2019t undo the years of racist and unethical practices people of color have experienced in the medical field, and the fear and mistrust many have developed as a result. But she still hopes to serve as a signal to those who are skeptical that it\\u2019s OK to begin trusting medicine and science.\", \"\\u201cPeople were saying, \\u2018Of course they had to choose a Black woman to be the guinea pig,\\u2019 and they were wondering if I wasn\\u2019t aware of the Tuskegee study,\\u201d she said, referring to trials that began in 1932 and withheld treatment from Black men with syphilis to analyze the effects. \\u201cMy brother just kindly informed people that I was well educated and I was in a doctoral program.\\u201d\", \"More than 200 million people have been fully vaccinated in the United States, or roughly 60 percent of the population, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\", \"But Ms. Lindsay said the numbers should be higher.\", \"\\u201cI was hoping for a faster sprint across the finish line, and we have not seen that,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe have more work to do here in the U.S., although we\\u2019ve made tremendous progress. Sixty percent is progress.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Lindsay, who got her booster shot in October, said she understands the community\\u2019s desire to get back to normal, but she said that would be impossible without more action.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s been a long road and some people have been hit so hard,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd I know it\\u2019s hard to exercise any more patience. We just want this to be done with and gone away.\\u201d\", \"In July, Ms. Lindsay, who was born in Jamaica, was recognized as an Outstanding American by Choice from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services during a ceremony at the White House.\", \"Her legacy was further cemented as Mr. Biden announced that the scrubs and badge she wore on the day she received her first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, along with her vaccination card, would be displayed at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History as part of an exhibit on the coronavirus pandemic.\", \"\\u201cI couldn\\u2019t believe I was at the White House, first of all,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd that me, an immigrant from Jamaica, would be getting this prestigious award \\u2014 it meant everything to me.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f95751fc5cca11ecb30ab15a32afdca2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f95751fc5cca11ecb30ab15a32afdca2"}},
