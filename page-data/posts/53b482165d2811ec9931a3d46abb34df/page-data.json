The 11 \\u2014 nine men and two women \\u2014 face abduction charges along with a string of lesser offenses, including disturbing the peace and violating measures aimed at preventing the spread of disease.

The move came a few weeks after the imposition of new restrictions for the unvaccinated.\", \"Average daily cases have declined slightly after a sharp spike in November, though deaths remain high, near the level they were a year ago. The Greek authorities are concerned about the spread of the Omicron variant, but so far tests suggest that the variant accounts for a small fraction of cases, according to the country\\u2019s National Public Health Organization. \"]","href_hash":"53b482165d2811ec9931a3d46abb34df"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"53b482165d2811ec9931a3d46abb34df"}},
