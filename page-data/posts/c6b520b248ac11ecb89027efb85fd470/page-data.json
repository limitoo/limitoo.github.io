That confidence began cracking this past summer, as she began, with the help of a therapist, to confront her fear of losing a business she regarded as her \\u201cplatform\\u201d for 38 years.\", \"\\u201cI was paralyzed not knowing what I was going to do with the rest of my life,\\u201d said Ms. Clevenger, who is 82.\", \"This month, Ms. Clevenger announced that whatever her future holds, it will not include Upperline. While the restaurant is officially for sale, the retirement of its founder, who embraced her hostess role as a higher calling, marks the end of an era for an establishment whose charisma reflected its owner\\u2019s.\", \"\\u201cI found JoAnn to be an intoxicating character,\\u201d said Gabriel Stafford, 39, who worked at Upperline for 11 years. \\u201cI felt like I was ensconced in New Orleans-ness while working there.\\u201d\", \"The restaurant was also one of a dwindling number of restaurants championing a strain of urban-rural cuisine that helped make New Orleans an internationally respected culinary destination.\", \"While Ms. Clevenger came up with dishes for Upperline\\u2019s traditional menu, including the fried green tomatoes topped with shrimp r\\u00e9moulade that became a New Orleans staple, she was never the chef. The three dining rooms were her domain. Each doubled as a gallery for artwork, most by New Orleans artists. She started acquiring the collection in 1960, when she had a tiny, short-lived gallery in the French Quarter.\", \"\\u201cI did not sell one picture in three months, so I had to give it up,\\u201d she said.\", \"Ms. Clevenger is co-owner with her son, Jason Clevenger, who was the chef when Upperline opened in 1983, and her husband, Alan Greenacre. They plan to sell the building and are open to selling the business, but only if Ms. Clevenger trusts that the buyer \\u201cwill carry on what we built.\\u201d The art is also for sale.\", \"On a tour of Upperline last week, Ms. Clevenger paused beneath the portrait in the front dining room of a domestic worker with a scarf wrapped around her head (above), painted by Jean Flanigen. \\u201cLook at how beautiful she is,\\u201d Ms. Clevenger said of the portrait. \\u201cIt demands respect.\\u201d\", \"Upperline\\u2019s rear dining rooms were filled with late-afternoon light when Ms. Clevenger walked into them. She stopped to pose next to a Noel Rockmore portrait of Sister Gertrude Morgan (below, over Ms. Clevenger\\u2019s left shoulder), a preacher whose artwork was critically praised before her death in New Orleans in 1980. Rockmore, a revered New Orleans artist of his era, was a fixture in the French Quarter bohemian milieu that enchanted Ms. Clevenger when she was a young woman working in the neighborhood\\u2019s bars and restaurants.\", \"\\u201cI knew Rockmore, but was afraid of him,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe was an intense womanizer. He drank a lot.\\u201d\", \"Another nearby Rockmore portrait features the piano player Frank Moliere (below), who was known as Little Daddy \\u2014 musicians were frequently featured in the artist\\u2019s work. It reminded Ms. Clevenger of the night Robert Plant, the lead singer for Led Zeppelin, dined at Upperline.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not very up on popular music,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t know he was a really big deal.\\u201d\", \"This is how it went with Ms. Clevenger all afternoon. Artwork triggered memories from her French Quarter days as a precocious 20-something from north Louisiana, and those memories connected to the more recent history of Upperline. One minute, she was recalling Typpa Hanush, a \\u201cquite spectacular woman\\u201d who sold turtle-liver p\\u00e2t\\u00e9 in the French Market and occasionally babysat for Ms. Clevenger\\u2019s children. Suddenly, noticing the table in front her, she changed subjects.\", \"\\u201cThis is where Jeff Bezos sat,\\u201d she said. She told of the night Mr. Bezos, the Amazon founder and owner of The Washington Post, sat at a table next to relatives of Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The New York Times and a New Orleans native. \\u201cI gave them each a little note, telling them who was at the other table,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about connections.\\u201d\", \"She also gave a printed list of local bookstores she recommends to MacKenzie Scott, who was then Mr. Bezos\\u2019 wife. \\u201cIt felt really good that I could give them a list of these brick-and-mortar stores he\\u2019s on the way to destroying.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Clevenger was performing \\u2014 as cultural ambassador, light gossip, amateur historian \\u2014 in much the same way she did when Upperline was in full flower.\", \"\\u201cShe knew how to tie together great ingredients, both in her dishes and her dining room,\\u201d said Walter Isaacson, the author, Tulane University professor and New Orleans native.\", \"She turned back to the front of the restaurant, passing a Joseph Ayers portrait of Ken Smith (above), the restaurant\\u2019s longest-serving chef, who left to become a Roman Catholic priest in 2010. She stopped in the center dining room (below), with its checkerboard floor. A photo portrait of Jason Clevenger\\u2019s successor as chef, Tom Cowman, hangs in the center of a window. \\u201cTom was really into books and art,\\u201d Ms. Clevenger said. \\u201cHe taught me so much.\\u201d\", \"Back in the restaurant\\u2019s front room, she picked up a framed copy (below left) of the menu from the night Upperline reopened after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Mr. Isaacson said that eating at the restaurant in the days after the storm was \\u201cwhere we regained our faith that the city would rebound.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Clevenger said the gratitude she felt from customers in those unsettling times was one reason she kept Upperline open as long as she did. \\u201cMy family has been bugging me to retire for at least 10 years,\\u201d she said.\", \"She explained what attracted her to hospitality when she worked on Bourbon Street in the 1960s and \\u201970s. \\u201cI remembered things about the customers and the bartenders and the other people that worked on the street,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd they loved that, and that made me feel good that I made them feel good. It\\u2019s a benevolent circle.\\u201d\", \"A few minutes later, Ms. Clevenger was back in those days herself, as she supplied a narrative to a picture of Bourbon House (above right), the French Quarter bar where she met Tennessee Williams. \\u201cHis cousin introduced us,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHer name was Stella.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cTake a look at the pretty sky, JoAnn,\\u201d said Mr. Greenacre, who had wandered unnoticed into the restaurant.\", \"Ms. Clevenger went to the window, laughed at the beauty of the fading light, and opened the shutters wide to pose for one last photo.\", \"\\u201cLet\\u2019s capture it before it goes away,\\u201d she said.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
