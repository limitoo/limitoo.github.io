They think they'll be worse off this year than in 2021 \\u2014 over 90% expect their operating costs will go up by 20% or more this year and anticipate the higher crop prices won't be enough to cushion the blow to their bottom line. \\u00a0  \", \"Marty Marr, President of the Illinois Corn Grower Association, said, \\\"It's amazing how one event can change so much for so many.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Birdsall said he and other farmers in his state are trying to insulate themselves from risk by switching some of their acres away from wheat to less fertilizer-intensive crops like soybeans or peas.\\u00a0 \\u00a0\", \"Justin Knopf, a fifth-generation farmer in Kansas who raises winter wheat and soybeans, purchased his fertilizer quickly after the invasion, assuming prices would climb higher.
