This past spring, local residents decided to change that. By June, our police department had secured voluntary pledges from 35 landscapers to obey the ban. The pledge wasn\\u2019t perfect, but our town was quieter and the air cleaner than it\\u2019s been for years.\", \"When people learn about how these antiquated machines harm people and the planet, there\\u2019s a strong pull to do the right thing.\", \"King PoorWinnetka, Ill.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"As someone who has loathed these obnoxious, deafening, exhaust-spewing machines for years, all I can say \\u2014 loudly, because of the noise \\u2014 is: Yes!\", \"I would add just one thing to Margaret Renkl\\u2019s case for banning these irritants.

I marveled at the ability to hear my own footfalls on the side streets, thinking how much quieter it was in the big city than in my own small town.
