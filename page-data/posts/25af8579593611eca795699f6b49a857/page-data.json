But the show leans more goofy than twisted thanks to energetic performances, especially from Jane Horrocks and Samson Kayo (Kayo is also one of the show\\u2019s creators). There are only six episodes, and they fly by. If you like \\u201cGreen Wing\\u201d or other British workplace comedies, or if you want something less slapstick than \\u201cAngie Tribeca,\\u201d watch this.\", \"\\u2018Craft in America\\u2019When to watch: Now, on the PBS app, the PBS website, the \\u201cCraft in America\\u201d website or on PBS. (Check local listings.)\", \"\\u201cCraft in America\\u201d is one of my favorite documentary series because of its knack for telling big stories in tiny ways. The show profiles artists and craftspeople in a wide variety of disciplines, but it\\u2019s less about specific techniques than about the formation of culture, the purpose of creativity, the idea that the pursuits of beauty and utility are foundational to humanity. The two newest episodes, \\u201cJewelry\\u201d and \\u201cHarmony,\\u201d also highlight the importance of mentorship \\u2014 not just transmission of know-how but also encouragement, support, delight.\", \"\\u2018Doom Patrol\\u2019When to watch: Now, on HBO Max.\", \"Dang, this show is fun \\u2014 arch and imaginative, sometimes cartoonish and sometimes grounded. It\\u2019s based on the DC comics, but it plays differently than most other contemporary superhero adaptations; the show it most reminds me of is \\u201cDead Like Me,\\u201d with its real sense of ache woven through a sort of fantasy procedural. As with many stories in the genre, \\u201cDoom Patrol\\u201d follows a band of misfits with supernatural abilities, and villains and quests and twists abound. It\\u2019s also funny and perceptive, with snappy dialogue, a \\u201cBuffy\\u201d when so many others are \\u201cTwilight.\\u201d If you\\u2019re in the mood to get super into a show, but everything prestige-y sounds like a chore, watch this.\"]","href_hash":"25af8579593611eca795699f6b49a857"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"25af8579593611eca795699f6b49a857"}},
