Second-half is the team that I know that can play. We need to do that for the full 90 minutes, not for 45 and I think the results will start to come.\", \"\\\"The substitutions made an influence on the game.

There were moments in the game where I think we had a little bit of momentum, a little bit more territory and we were trying to stick to the way we wanted to play.\", \"\\\"I'm really proud of them for still pushing, still playing through the 90 and still trying to look for a goal, even at the end.\", \"\\\"A 3-0 result sucks, but at the same time there were moments in that performance we can be happy with.\\\"\", \"The Phoenix men will be back in action on Wednesday night, when they play Melbourne City in the quarter-finals of the FFA Cup.\", \"They'll move on to play Central Coast Mariners - alongside the Phoenix women - in round six of the A-League on December 27.\", \"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"8f99089860f611ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8f99089860f611ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
