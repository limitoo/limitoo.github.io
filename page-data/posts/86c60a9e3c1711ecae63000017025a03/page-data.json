an international pledge to reduce methane emissions.\", \"Methane is considered to be one of the most potent greenhouse gases and second-biggest contributor to global warming behind only carbon dioxide.\", \"Overnight, the US and the European Union announced more than 100 countries have joined their bid to cut methane emissions by 30 per cent by 2030.\", \"\\\"I think we could probably go beyond that,\\\" Mr Biden said during his address at the UN conference in Glasgow.\", \"\\\"We just announced this package at the [UN] General Assembly back in September, at the time [it] was mentioned just nine countries had signed on.\", \"\\\"Today, it's approaching a hundred countries that are signing on,\\\" he said.\", \"Australia joins China, Russia, India and Iran \\u2013 some of the biggest methane emitters \\u2014\\u00a0as those who refused to join the global push.\", \"The US and EU believe reducing methane will be a powerful tool in the fight to tackle climate change, and the goal of ensuring the world does not heat more than 1.5 degrees Celsius.\", \"\\\"Methane is one of the gases we can cut fastest, doing that will immediately slow down climate change,\\\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said.\", \"Methane traps more heat, but breaks down faster in the atmosphere than some other greenhouses gases, meaning reductions will have a more rapid impact on global warming, she said.\", \"Australia's Energy Minister Angus Taylor defended the country's decision not to join the pact.\", \"\\\"Our focus is whole of economy, all gases,\\\" Mr Taylor said at the COP26 conference.\", \"\\\"It's the entirety of gases that matters \\u2026 that's our specific goal.\\\"\", \"<img

problem [climate change] we can push out to the future, this is happening right now,\\\" he said in Glasgow.\", \"Mr Turnbull said even Australia's physical presence at COP 26 \\u2014\\u00a0a stall
