In the 80 years since she gave her final performance, \\u201cI want to be alone\\u201d (a line she spoke in \\u201cGrand Hotel\\u201d) has become the thing for which she is best remembered \\u2014 more than her talent, probably more than her beauty and certainly more than her movies, of which even a lot of cinephiles would have trouble naming five. Her professional legacy is lean: Even the two famous slogans associated with her \\u2014 \\u201cGarbo Talks!\\u201d for her first sound picture, \\u201cAnna Christie,\\u201d and \\u201cGarbo Laughs\\u201d for her most enduring (let\\u2019s just say best), Ernst Lubitsch\\u2019s \\u201cNinotchka\\u201d \\u2014 herald deviations from the norm. This is not the Garbo you know, they say: the silent Garbo, the unsmiling Garbo, the enigmatic Garbo. Impenetrability is an odd quality for a performer to make her signature.\", \"So it\\u2019s fitting that \\u201cGarbo,\\u201d Robert Gottlieb\\u2019s ardent and wise investigative portrait, sometimes reads less as a methodical account of a life than as a biography-mystery, a hunt for a quarry that the author, a veteran editor/writer/obsesser/pursuer who ran (at different times) Knopf and The New Yorker, understands is likely to remain just out of reach.\", \"As he makes clear in his generous citations of the writers who preceded him into this cavern, hers is not an unexamined life. \\u201cI am inclined to think that there is altogether too much discussion of Garbo these days,\\u201d a critic for The New Yorker wrote. That was in 1932. \", \"What, if anything, is left to discover? In the early going, not much. Gottlieb is painstaking in reconstructing her youth (as Greta Gustafsson) in Stockholm and her cultivation by a director who \\u201chad been looking for a beautiful girl whom he could completely mold.\\u201d Upon her arrival in Hollywood in 1925, she did not work her way up; as soon as M-G-M found her, the studio decided she would be their next leading lady. \\u201cGreta Garbo \\u2014 Perfection!\\u201d blared their publicity campaign. \\u201cShe was,\\u201d Gottlieb writes, \\u201cbewildered, unsophisticated,\\u201d a young woman \\u201csuddenly transported to Oz.\\u201d And, as he reminds us right at the start, many of the movies she made were \\u201cclich\\u00e9d or worse,\\u201d and their star was not a goddess, merely \\u201ca Swedish peasant girl, uneducated, na\\u00efve and always on her guard.\\u201d \", \"What is absent from the early part of \\u201cGarbo\\u201d is her personality, and I don\\u2019t mean that as a criticism of Gottlieb, because \\u201cpersonality\\u201d seems to have been absent from Garbo herself. She was shy, a bit dour, could laugh with friends but then turn cold \\u2014 in short, a cipher.\", \"Gottlieb suggests that, given its first glimpse of her, \\u201cthe world simply grasped that she was unique and to be treasured.\\u201d Stardom, even in Hollywood\\u2019s formative years, was rarely that free of machinery, but in Garbo\\u2019s case, one has to credit a certain kind of alchemy; what could seem withholding, blank, even dull in life felt deep, adult and mesmerizing when projected onto a screen. And once Garbo steps in front of the camera, Gottlieb\\u2019s book comes gloriously into its own, a tour through a career offered by a shrewd, deeply perceptive docent, brimming with knowledge and insight.\", \"This seems an apt moment to mention that the author turned 90 this spring, not only because, come on, bravo, but also because the fact that he was born in 1931 proves an invaluable asset to his understanding of his subject. To Gottlieb, the 1930s studio movies in which Garbo made her mark aren\\u2019t relics of history to be discovered in film class or on TCM. They\\u2019re just the stuff he grew up on, made efficiently to be consumed quickly, and he brings to his assessments a fan\\u2019s appreciation, a connoisseur\\u2019s acuity and an amused impatience with the aspects of them that are and always were ridiculous.\", \"Maybe it takes a nonagenarian to be this tartly un-gushy about Garbo\\u2019s \\u201cGrand Hotel\\u201d co-star Lionel Barrymore, \\u201cwhose overacting is unbearable even by Lionel standards. (Lonely, dying old men don\\u2019t have to be hams.)\\u201d Or to contextualize a long-forgotten movie like \\u201cThe Single Standard\\u201d thus: \\u201cHere she\\u2019s natural, happy (when not being noble), fun to watch \\u2014 likable! You see once more what she might have been in talkies if she and M-G-M hadn\\u2019t conspired to keep her in lugubrious romances and high-flown \\u2018classics\\u2019 and historicals.\\u201d His writing about \\u201cCamille\\u201d \\u2014 remembered, and often dismissed, for its over-the-top melodrama and death scene \\u2014 is the first I\\u2019ve read that helped me understand the esteem in which generations of worshipers have held her performance. This is what we want film books to do \\u2014 to send us to the work with sharper eyes and more open minds.\", \"Any attempt at a life of Garbo faces inevitable second-act trouble. She abruptly departed from the screen in 1941 (\\u201cI had made enough faces,\\u201d she told David Niven), and \\u2026 then what? Gottlieb details the mostly uneventful remaining half-century (!) of her life fitfully, which may be the only way to detail an existence seemingly shaped to avoid excitement. She moved into a nice Manhattan apartment on 52nd Street. She bought some Renoirs. She had few close friends, and her relationships with them were fraught with various suspicions and betrayals. She went to dinner parties and Gristedes and the florist and took long walks. She appears not to have said a single interesting thing. And then she died, leaving an estate worth between $32 million and $55 million, and stiffing everyone but her niece. The rest is (even more) silence.\", \"But not, thankfully, in this book. In the last 100 pages of \\u201cGarbo,\\u201d Gottlieb turns from writer to curator, offering old articles, excerpts from memoirs, biographies and novels, and the murmurs and memories of dozens of other voices, from scholars and critics to colleagues and co-stars. It\\u2019s as if he has turned over his clipping files to us and said, \\u201cSee what you make of this\\u201d \\u2014 fair enough, since we\\u2019re all trying to solve the same puzzle. We hear from fans like Katharine Hepburn, who said Garbo had \\u201ca real, real gift for movie acting. \\u2026 Photographically she had something that nobody else had. That\\u2019s what made her. You don\\u2019t become that famous for no reason.\\u201d And from non-fans like Marlene Dietrich: \\u201cShe is the kind of person who counts every cube of sugar to make sure the maid isn\\u2019t stealing, or eating too well.\\u201d \", \"I searched these pages for an observation that might serve as the rug that ties the room together. John Gielgud\\u2019s verdict came closest: \\u201cLovely childlike expression and great sweetness \\u2014 she never stopped talking but absolutely to no purpose \\u2014 said her life was empty, aimless, but the time passed so quickly there was never time to do anything one wanted to do! \\u2026 I couldn\\u2019t make out whether her whole attitude was perhaps a terrific pose.\\u201d Gottlieb is the first to admit that resolving that may be impossible, although his thoughtful contemplation of her should spur many to watch her movies and try. But don\\u2019t say he didn\\u2019t warn you: \\u201cShe offered the world intense emotion and great aesthetic pleasure,\\u201d he writes, \\u201cbut she didn\\u2019t offer herself.\\u201d \"]","href_hash":"9427721e547b11ecae05bfb0b2f7a882"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9427721e547b11ecae05bfb0b2f7a882"}},
