Even as the unemployment rate rose, working mothers lost jobs while an average of 400,000 job openings were added each month.\", \"With the reopening of schools, Powell had predicted that mothers would be more free to return to work, yet that has not been the case.\", \"Indeed Director of Economic Research Nick Bunker said that among mothers of children 13 or younger, the amount who were employed in September was nearly 4 percent below pre-pandemic levels.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928270/will-women-return-th-workplace.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Economists question whether women with children will return to the workplace after the pandemic.

Her research concluded that other factors have also likely depressed women's participation in the workforce.\", \"Since women were overrepresented in such hard-hit service industries as restaurants and retail, many of them may be reluctant to return to those in-person jobs until the pandemic is further under control, the study found.\", \"A new report, Women in the Workplace, by the consulting firm McKinsey & Co. illustrates how the pandemic imposed an especially heavy toll on working women. It found that one in three women over the past year had thought about leaving their jobs or \\\"downshifting\\\" their careers. Early in the pandemic, by contrast, the study's authors said, just one in four women had considered leaving.\", \"\\\"Women are even more burned out now than they were a year ago,\\\" the report said, \\\"and the gap in burnout between women and men has nearly doubled.\\\"\", \"Forty-two percent of women said they felt burned out this year, compared with 32 percent who said so in 2020.
