Castro resigned on Thursday, effective immediately, said the CSU Board of Trustees. \", \" In a statement, Castro called it the most difficult decision of his professional life. \", \" Castro fell under criticism after an investigation by USA TODAY published on Feb. 3 questioned the handling of misconduct complaints against Frank Lamas, former Fresno State vice president of student affairs, while Castro was the university's president.\", \" The article said Lamas was the subject of a series of informal complaints including allegations beginning in 2014 that he improperly touched women, made sexist comments and harassed or retaliated against workers. \", \" No action was taken against Lamas until a formal complaint was filed in 2019, when he was barred from campus and later found to have violated a CSU harassment policy, according to documents cited by the San Francisco Chronicle.\", \"CBS Los Angeles reports the action against Lamas came after a former employee alleged that he offered her a promotion in return for sexual favors.\", \" Lamas denied the allegations and appealed the finding. \", \"He retired in 2020 as part of a settlement agreement the Los Angeles Times says Castro was a central figure in brokering.\", \"Under the agreement, he received a $260,000 payment and while he was barred from ever working at CSU again, Castro agreed to write him a letter of recommendation to help find work elsewhere, the documents indicated.\", \" The revelations sparked a protest by Fresno State students earlier this month.\", \"According to CBS L.A., after news of the 2019 accord broke, Castro sent a letter to the CSU community saying his main goal in the deal was to remove Castro from campus and the community.
