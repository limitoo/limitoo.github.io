now being called quantitative tightening - but has some obstacles.\", \"It cannot sell them directly into the money market but only to the government's borrowing agency - the Debt Management Office (DMO).\", \"\\\"We expect the Bank to say that it intends to be pragmatic and flexible around QT, and be responsive to how the economic outlook and market functioning evolves, rather than pre-committing to, for example, getting the portfolio down to a specific size by a specific date,\\\" said ANZ chief economist Sharon Zollner.\", \"Among the RBNZ's options are to hold the bonds until they mature, which would be a long-term affair, or set out a target and timetable for reducing the amount by selling to the DMO.\", \"Zollner said she did not know what would be achieved by running down the bond portfolio ahead of its natural maturity, but if the RBNZ wanted to do so, it would have be managed so it did not cause the Treasury to have to issue new bonds for ones it was buying from the RBNZ.\", \"Fisher Funds' McLeish said the DMO had about $37bn in cash, which would allow for a quicker sell down if the RBNZ wanted it.\"]","href_hash":"7b47b1f4936011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7b47b1f4936011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
