As CBS2's Carolyn Gusoff reports,  they are grateful for long-sought answers.\", \"It was a 1980 tragedy and mystery. Twenty-year-old Eve Wilkowitz was walking home from the Bay Shore train station after returning from her job as a secretary in Manhattan. She  was abducted and found days later, raped and strangled. Her murder was unsolved until now.\", \"\\\"We solved the 42-year-old homicide case of Eve Wilkowitz\\u00a0  ... The perpetrator of that crime, a Herbert Rice, who is deceased,\\\" Suffolk County District Attorney Ray Tierney announced Wednesday.\", \"Her  sister, Irene Wilkowitz, is overwhelmed with relief.\", \"\\\"I still can't believe I heard those words, 'We have identified the person responsible for the death of Eve,'\\\" she said.\", \"Tierney  calls it  a study in persistence and determination. Police kept DNA from the crime and over the years continued to compare it to criminal databases. Finally, with new technology and access to public DNA databases, they found a relative's match.  They got a sample from a cooperating  relative of Rice  and exhumed Rice's body, confirming a match.\", \"\\\"This is my first time seeing him. I didn't Google him even though I knew his name for a couple of months now. I didn't want to see the last face that Eve saw while she was still alive,\\\" Wilkowitz said.\", \"It's a small measure of closure for a family and relentless detectives.\", \"\\\"A lot of really, really dogged investigators working collaboratively with the assistance of an unbelievable family,\\\" Tierney said.\", \"\\\"Irene ... who  never lost faith in our investigators' dedication,\\\" Suffolk Police Commissioner Rodney Harrison said.\", \"Rice died of cancer in 1991. Prosecutors  believe it was a crime of opportunity. He was living on the block where Eve Wilkowitz was abducted and her body  dumped.\", \"\\\"Mostly she liked being a big sister to me. She never got a chance to fulfill her dreams,\\\" Irene Wilkowitz said. \\\"I've lived these last 42 years afraid all the time that I was going to be killed next.\\\"\", \"This is  first time a DNA match from a public database has solved a Suffolk murder case. The victim's sister is \\u00a0hoping it can help other families. She and prosecutors thank Rice's relatives in helping to  solve this case.\", \"Prosecutors said they do not believe Rice was responsible for any other murders.\", \"Carolyn Gusoff has covered some of the most high profile news stories in the New York City area and is best known as a trusted, tenacious, consistent and caring voice of Long Island's concerns.\"]","href_hash":"7d43faf4b0bf11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7d43faf4b0bf11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
