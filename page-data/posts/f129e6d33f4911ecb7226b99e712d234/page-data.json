El Ni\\u00f1o conditions there was less rainfall and more sunlight penetration of the sea water, excellent conditions for sea grass growth.\", \"\\\"A year or so after a strong El Ni\\u00f1o event, we

the land through the rivers and creeks and eventually out into the bays and along the coast,\\\" he said.\", \"When\\u00a0sea grass was malnourished, so too could\\u00a0turtles be, particularly
