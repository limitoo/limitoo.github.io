The U.S.-based convoy departed California last week and is scheduled to arrive in the Washington, D.C.,-area on March 5.\", \"Another expected convoy, which left Scranton, Pennsylvania, on Wednesday, failed to gain traction, though D.C. officials have warned other groups of truckers could reach Washington by Tuesday when Mr. Biden will deliver his State of the Union address to a joint session of Congress, according to WTOP.\", \"At least two convoys have posted routes online, though it's unclear how many trucks are participating in the demonstrations.\", \"In anticipation of the protests, the Pentagon approved requests from the Capitol Police and D.C. Metropolitan Police Department for assistance from the National Guard. Up to 700 National Guard members, who will not carry firearms or take part in law enforcement activities, will help at designated traffic posts and select Capitol entry points, according to the National Guard.\", \"Fencing was installed around the Capitol complex for weeks after the January 6 assault on the Capitol and remaining inner fencing was fully removed in July. Temporary fencing went back up in September ahead of a rally supporting people who were arrested for their roles in the January 6 attack.\"]","href_hash":"7959703497f811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7959703497f811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
