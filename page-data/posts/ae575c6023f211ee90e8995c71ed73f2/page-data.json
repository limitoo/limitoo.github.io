Multiple people were confirmed dead in flash flooding that hit suburban Pennsylvania on Saturday night, just six days after a woman died while trying to evacuate her upstate New York home amid mass flooding that swept through the region \\u2014 and devastated parts of Vermont.\\u00a0\", \"Three people died on a flooded roadway in eastern Pennsylvania after around 5:30 p.m. ET on Saturday, when the area saw between six and seven inches of rainfall in less than an hour,\\u00a0CBS Philadelphia initially reported, citing the Bucks County Coroner's Office. The victims included two adult women and one adult man, all of whom authorities found outside of their cars in an area where the water level was about five feet above ground, the coroner's office confirmed to CBS News. The flash flooding occured about 30 minutes north of Philadelphia by car and just under a mile from Houghs Creek, a tributary in the Delaware River.\", \"Eleven vehicles were estimated to be on the road when the flash flooding occurred, said Tim Brewer, Chief of the Upper Makefield Fire Company, at a news conference on Sunday morning. Authorities confirmed that three of those cars were swept away in the flood, with eight people rescued from their vehicles and another two rescued from the creek nearby. Four people were still missing when the conference took place, as search teams resumed operations in the area after stopping at dark on Saturday night.\", \"Authorities said three cars belonging to the deceased were found in the creek and recovered, with one car found roughly 1 1/2 miles downstream from where it entered the water. They were treating the search for those four missing people as a rescue, although Brewer said they are fairly sure it will be a recovery effort. The missing people include a 9-month-old and three of the baby's relatives, according to the fire chief, who identified them as three females and one man as 63 years old. He did not provide details about the three victims who were confirmed dead.\", \"Across the northeastern U.S., forecasters warned of potential flash floods and tornadoes on Sunday linked to the latest bout of severe weather.\\u00a0\", \"The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for parts of Connecticut, including Danbury, Shelton and Waterbury, that was set to remain active until at least 11 a.m. ET.
