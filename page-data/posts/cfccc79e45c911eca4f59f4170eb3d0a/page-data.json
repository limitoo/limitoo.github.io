They face competing demands from industry interests that oppose regulation, developing countries that need aid and a vocal citizenship that wants to rein in emissions more quickly.\", \"But even if countries fulfill all the emissions promises they made, they will miss by a wide margin the target of limiting warming by a level that scientists say is necessary to avert the worst consequences of warming.\", \"The key nations: The U.S., China, India, Britain and Brazil are among the countries facing the biggest pressures for fast results.\", \"Other takeaways: Our reporters compiled a list of the six biggest conclusions from the two-week conference.\", \"The last major air route from the Middle East to Belarus was closed in an effort to halt a humanitarian crisis that has left thousands of people stranded at Belarus\\u2019s border with Poland.
