Already, around 60 people have been sent to Penny\\u2019s Bay, a facility of shipping-container-like dormitories on an outlying island.\", \"The revelation came as Hong Kong, which had gone months without any local transmission, prepares for a new outbreak linked to the Omicron variant. And it followed vigorous calls from the government \\u2014 which has imposed some of the harshest quarantine and social distancing measures in the world \\u2014 for residents to avoid public gatherings.\", \"The party, at a Spanish tapas restaurant, was for Witman Hung, a local delegate to the Chinese national legislature, and its guest list was a who\\u2019s who of the city\\u2019s political elite. Attendees included Caspar Tsui, the city\\u2019s home affairs secretary; Raymond Siu, the police commissioner; Au Ka-wang, the immigration director; and 20 lawmakers, who were just sworn in for a new term this week.\", \"At least one of those lawmakers, Junius Ho, also traveled to Shenzhen two days after the party to meet with a top Chinese government official.\", \"At a news conference on Thursday after news of the party emerged, Carrie Lam, the city\\u2019s leader, said she was \\u201cvery disappointed\\u201d in the government officials. Several of them have also issued apologies.\", \"\\u201cI have reflected on this incident and shall be more vigilant in future,\\u201d Mr. Au, the immigration director, said in a statement on Friday. (Earlier, Mrs. Lam had declined to answer questions about whether Mr. Au used a contact tracing app to check in at the party, as required by law; his statement did not address that issue.)\", \"Mr. Au had already been fined last year for breaching social distancing rules at a hot-pot dinner in March.\", \"Earlier on Friday, officials had said only a handful of the lawmakers and officials would be sent to quarantine, as the others had shown that they left before an infected guest arrived around 9:30 p.m. But later in the day, the health authorities said a second guest, who had been present from 6 to 8 p.m., had also tested positive \\u2014 leading every partygoer to be quarantined.\", \"The scandal was likely to dent the already-low public trust in the government, which has been battered by widespread pro-democracy protests in 2019, followed by a sweeping political crackdown in the years since. A poll last month showed that only 25 percent of Hong Kongers surveyed approved of the government\\u2019s performance.\"]","href_hash":"e8e10e726fac11ecb3b51fc87d636aaf"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e8e10e726fac11ecb3b51fc87d636aaf"}},
