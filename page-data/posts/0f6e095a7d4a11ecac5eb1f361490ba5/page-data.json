(which, while low, isn't zero).\", \"Secondly, they help to prevent kids passing the virus onto others, such as their younger siblings and grandparents.\", \"Experts say COVID-19 vaccination is especially important for children with underlying medical conditions \\u2014\\u00a0such as heart or lung disease, diabetes, obesity and severe asthma \\u2014\\u00a0who have an increased risk of severe COVID-19.\", \"Vaccination also has the added benefit of protecting kids against a serious but rare post-COVID-19 condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C.\", \"Recent research

\"In Australia, the Therapeutic Goods Administration approved Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine for all children aged five to 11 after it found the vaccine was safe and effective in this age group, based on international clinical trial data.\", \"The vaccine is exactly the same one that has been rolled out to millions of Australian adults, but is a much smaller dose \\u2014\\u00a0just one third the size.\", \"Children's doses come in a different vial to adult doses, to ensure mistakes are not made.\", \"And while adults receive their vaccine three weeks apart, children are recommended to wait eight weeks between their first and second dose, to ensure maximum protection.\", \"A sore arm is the most reported side-effect in children, although headache and fatigue can also be expected after a jab.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">If my child has COVID, how long do I have to wait to get them vaccinated?</div>\", \"According to ATAGI's advice, children can get the jab once they have recovered from acute infection.\\u00a0\", \"However, in line with the UK's vaccination guidelines, Dr Danchin recommends waiting a minimum of four weeks before the first vaccine dose.\", \"This extended period is useful to ensure a full recovery from the disease and an absence of multisystem inflammatory syndrome (which usually appears three to four weeks post-infection).\", \"While infection from COVID-19 will mean they develop some immunity to the virus, experts still recommend children are vaccinated to ensure they have maximal protection.\", \"If symptoms persist during the month following their infection, Dr Danchin recommends waiting another month before getting them vaccinated.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What will happen\\u00a0if my child is not vaccinated in time for school?</div>\", \"The federal government says\\u00a0there are enough supplies for all eligible children to receive their first COVID-19 vaccine before the term starts.\", \"But the recommended eight-week interval between Pfizer's two-dose paediatric vaccine means most children won't\\u00a0receive their full two doses until at least March.\", \"As Pfizer's clinical trial only reports efficacy data for two doses, it is unclear how much protection children will get from one.\", \"\\\"If we were going to guess it would be 60-70 per cent protection [against symptomatic disease],\\\" Dr\\u00a0Danchin recently told the ABC.\", \"She says even though there's a \\\"decent risk\\\" of children becoming infected, she believes one dose will likely\\u00a0offer protection against severe disease.\", \"With widespread reports of parents struggling to find vaccine appointments for their children, the government has urged parents to try state clinics and pharmacies.\", \"In addition to vaccines, experts stress that other mitigation strategies, such as rapid testing and proper ventilation, are crucial to reducing the risks of COVID-19 transmission in\\u00a0schools.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How do
