Product shortages overseas. Overburdened container ships. Price increases.\", \"For businesses that rely on the global supply chain, this holiday season has become particularly stressful. But at manufacturers like Nanotronics, a science technology company in the Brooklyn Navy Yard that sources most of its components locally, things are going swimmingly.\", \"\\u201cThere is nothing we have right now that is behind schedule,\\u201d said Matthew Putman, the chief executive of the company, which makes items like robotic microscopes. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t rely on ships right now that are stuck at ports in Los Angeles.\\u201d\", \"Nanotronics makes many of its components at its 45,000-square-foot office and factory space in Brooklyn. What it can\\u2019t make, it acquires locally. Sheet metal comes from Ferra Designs, about 20 feet away in the Navy Yard complex, which also houses 3-D printing and finishing services the company uses. Nanotronics buys its cameras in Manhattan\\u2019s Financial District and its plastics and springs in Brooklyn, from businesses in Williamsburg and Sunset Park.\", \"Early in the pandemic, several businesses in the Navy Yard pivoted to produce some 10 million units of personal protective equipment when masks and hospital gowns were scarce. Now companies there like Nanotronics are successfully steering clear of logjams in the supply chain wrought by the pandemic by sourcing and manufacturing hard-to-get items locally.\", \"\\u201cWe just got a call yesterday from a company that does this gene therapy that is really important for vaccines and therapeutics,\\u201d Mr. Putman said. \\u201cThey need a machine that no one else can make for them right now. I know we will be able to get it to them quickly.\\u201d\", \"Businesses that emphasize local production have been rewarded during this tumultuous time. They\\u2019ve been able to fulfill orders quickly for existing clients and have attracted new ones who can\\u2019t get what they need from manufacturers overseas.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve had people reach out to us to start new businesses who thought they would be sourcing abroad,\\u201d said Joanna Reynolds, the associate director of Made in NYC, an initiative of the Pratt Center for Community Development that supports local manufacturers and makers. \\u201cNow they want to make their products in New York City.\\u201d So far, the group has added 171 new members during the pandemic.\", \"City manufacturing hubs have also expanded over the past 18 months. The Brooklyn Navy Yard has leased an additional 300,000 square feet, and Industry City, in Sunset Park, has filled an additional 800,000 square feet. \\u201cMore companies are understanding they want their office, their design, their manufacturing, even their customers right next to their warehouse distribution,\\u201d said Andrew Kimball, the chief executive of Industry City. \\u201cWe can do all those things here.\\u201d\", \"Local companies are leaning on one another more now too, Ms. Reynolds said. For example, accessory businesses in the garment district are using a company in Brooklyn to print their labels and packaging. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a really beautiful network our companies are building,\\u201d she said.\", \"Supply chain problems have given local manufacturers a competitive edge. \\u201cI would say weekly we are offered up various projects that other manufacturers can\\u2019t do because they can\\u2019t get their components,\\u201d said Shakil Ahmad, a vice president at Coronet LED, a lighting company based in Totowa, N.J., which has a showroom in Manhattan. \\u201cThey are coming to us and saying, \\u2018They can\\u2019t deliver for 16 weeks. Can you guys do it?\\u201d\", \"Coronet LED\\u2019s paint supplier is down the street in Totowa; its lens manufacturer is a short drive away. \\u201cOur claim to fame is we have always kept everything as close to us as possible,\\u201d Mr. Ahmad said. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t know this pandemic would happen, but it has worked out so incredibly well. It shows how important it is to manufacture locally.\\u201d\", \"Now, Mr. Ahmad, who lives in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, walks around his neighborhood and imagines what all the empty factory buildings can be. \\u201cIf you go on McGuinness Boulevard you see all these empty warehouses,\\u201d he said. \\u201cA lot of them are being converted into high-end residential properties, but they are removing opportunities for more manufacturing to occur.\\u201d\", \"Gregg Thompson, the executive director of Crye Precision, a Brooklyn Navy Yard company that makes uniforms, body armor, helmets and other military equipment, has been surprised by some of the businesses that have placed recent orders.\", \"\\u201cThe weirdest thing we\\u2019ve seen is the CrossFit market,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople who do CrossFit buy stuff that looks like military equipment, and they couldn\\u2019t get their equipment from other places, so they started calling us.\\u201d\", \"Even companies that don\\u2019t manufacture entirely in New York City have benefited from having part of their supply chain here. Prince Seating, which makes chairs and tables for bars, restaurants and hotels, has factories overseas and across the United States. But its 80,000-square-foot factory in Brooklyn has saved the company during the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cAt our New York City factory, we keep a lot of inventory in stock,\\u201d said Daniel Edell, the president of Prince Seating. \\u201cWe have thousands of frames there, and now we are seeing that inventory get totally depleted.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cA lot of other companies don\\u2019t work that way. They have a few models here but source most things overseas, and now they are stuck because they have no product to sell.\\u201d\", \"At the end of the process, when the final customers are local, manufacturers avoid the worry that shipped goods may not arrive in time. \\u201cI would say most of our businesses have customer bases who are based in New York City,\\u201d said Ms. Reynolds, of Made in NYC.\", \"Of course, manufacturing in and around New York City is not easy. It\\u2019s not surprising that labor, real estate and raw materials are all more expensive here than in China. Mr. Ahmad admitted that spending more on labor and material reduces profit margins and that some items for his products can still be found only abroad, like LED boards.\", \"But some local companies aren\\u2019t focused on getting the cheapest products and labor; they want the best.\", \"\\u201cOther manufacturers make their products overseas, and that is because it\\u2019s very expensive to build things in Brooklyn,\\u201d said Laura Fodera, a co-owner and the chief executive of Fodera, a guitar maker in Industry City. \\u201cBut our customers know we are different. We use the highest quality products, exotic woods, proprietary goods, and all of our labor is done in house in Brooklyn.\\u201d\", \"While customers used to comment on the high prices, in the current climate they appreciate being able to get a Fodera guitar. \\u201cOur wait times are currently between 14 and 18 months, but that is not due to the supply chain issues,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s strictly because of an abundance of sales.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8944819a542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8944819a542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}},
