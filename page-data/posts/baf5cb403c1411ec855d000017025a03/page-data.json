moves to calm anxieties about Australia's nuclear submarine program and bed down a new strategic partnership with peak regional body ASEAN.\", \"Senator Payne is expected to visit Indonesia,\\u00a0Malaysia, Cambodia and Vietnam on the trip.\", \"Cambodia has just taken over the chairmanship of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), while both Malaysia and Indonesia have sharply criticised Australia's\\u00a0plan to build nuclear-powered submarines under the AUKUS technology pact with the United Kingdom and the United States.\", \"The ABC has been told Indonesia's President\\u00a0Joko Widodo\\u00a0\\\"repeatedly and forcefully\\\"\\u00a0raised concerns about the nuclear submarines program when Prime Minister Scott Morrison met virtually with ASEAN leaders last week, reiterating Indonesia's concerns the program could fuel an arms race in South-East Asia.\", \"Australian officials have dismissed that argument in private, pointing out that Australia's nuclear submarines will only be conventionally armed and contrasting the government's defence ambitions with China's massive military build-up.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">China ramping up pressure</div>\", \"Late last week Defence Minister Peter Dutton also suggested some South-East Asian nations were criticising the arrangement largely to placate Beijing, which has lashed the nuclear submarines proposal and accused Australia of trying to undermine the global nuclear non-proliferation regime.\", \"\\\"We need to recognise also that China is a country that has significant economic investments and equities across countries in the region,\\\" Mr Dutton\\u00a0said.\", \"\\\"So there will be nuance in language.\\\"\", \"Chinese ministers and officials have tried to ramp up pressure on Australia by bringing up the nuclear submarines during bilateral meetings with their South-East Asian counterparts.\", \"Last week China's Foreign Ministry said Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi and Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi both \\\"expressed grave concern over the risk of nuclear proliferation\\\"\\u00a0caused by the submarine plan.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/031482edbb2abd3756d634f7acb79f3f\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Indonesian\\u00a0Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi has expressed concerns about nuclear proliferation in the region.\\u00a0(Reuters: Ajeng Dinar Ulfiana)</div>\", \"But Mr Dutton suggested military leaders across the region were overwhelmingly in favour of Australia's nuclear submarine ambitions, in part because they were keen for other countries to maintain a significant naval presence that would\\u00a0help to balance China's growing military might.\", \"\\\"All I can say to you is, in the discussions that I've had with our partners across the region, there has been support for AUKUS and support for a greater presence from the UK, the US, Japan, India and others,\\\"\\u00a0he said.\", \"One South-East Asian government representative also told the ABC the AUKUS debate had exposed some sharp differences between the military and foreign affairs officials in both Indonesia and Malaysia.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">A new partnership in South-East Asia</div>\", \"While AUKUS and nuclear submarines will feature prominently in her discussions, Senator Payne is also expected to discuss the new comprehensive strategic partnership struck between ASEAN and Australia last week.\", \"Australian officials point to the agreement as proof that the controversy over AUKUS and the nuclear submarines has not permanently damaged Australia's ties with the region, despite the public displays of frustration from Malaysia and Indonesia.\", \"Senator Payne is also likely to press South-East Asian nations to continue to maximise pressure on the military junta which has seized power and jailed civilian leaders in Myanmar.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Myanmar excluded from ASEAN</div>\", \"ASEAN has historically put huge weight on consensus and non-interference, and has been unwilling to apply meaningful pressure to member nations which have committed grave human rights abuses.\", \"But last month it decided to exclude Myanmar's military chief Min Aung Hlaing from the ASEAN leaders summit in a concerted effort to ensure the junta could not present itself as the country's legitimate government.\", \"The bloc also appointed a special envoy, Brunei's Second Foreign Minister Erywan Yusof, to try to\\u00a0broker a solution to the bloody political crisis in Myanmar.\", \"Mr Yusof was due to visit Myanmar last month but cancelled his trip after he was blocked from meeting ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.\", \"Senator Payne is also expected to discuss Australia's promise to distribute a further 10\\u00a0million COVID-19 vaccines to countries in the region and its promises to ramp up investment in a series of programs focussed on topics such as\\u00a0energy security, pandemic recovery, transnational crime, and education.\"]","href_hash":"baf5cb403c1411ec855d000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"baf5cb403c1411ec855d000017025a03"}},
