movement\\\".\", \"In preparing for a third term, Xi has been turning towards inequality, seeking to narrow the gap between rich and poor with a push for \\\"common prosperity\\\".\", \"Last year, he has used the term \\\"common prosperity\\\" more than 65 times in his speeches, calling it the \\\"original quintessence\\\" of socialism.\", \"The president has called for \\\"excessive incomes\\\" to be \\\"reasonably adjusted\\\", saying that it was necessary to \\\"encourage high-income earners and enterprises to give back more to society\\\".\", \"This has involved asking big companies to put money into philanthropy, with tech giants, including Alibaba and Tencent, pledging billions of dollars to support the campaign.\", \"While experts say low-income households may welcome the move,

that \\u2026 many big companies are going bankrupt, and many people are losing money,\\\" Professor Xia said.\", \"The plight of debt-stricken real estate company Evergrande has already exposed the risks of the government's regulatory crackdown.\", \"In an attempt to rein in house prices and reduce debt levels, regulators tightened limits on borrowing by China's real estate industry.\", \"This led to the near collapse of the country's largest property developer which has been struggling to make bond payments.\", \"It prompted fear and speculation that the world was facing its next \\\"Lehman Brothers moment\\\".\", \"With Xi's reign came a new ideology and brand of Chinese nationalism, which in 2017 was enshrined into the party constitution.\", \"He is the only leader, other than Mao, to have an eponymous ideology included in the document while in office.\", \"Central to what's been called \\\"Xi Jinping Thought\\\" is China's continued rise as a global power, promoting the party and Xi on top as the guiding force.\", \"The president's philosophies have been introduced into the national curriculum, splashed across the internet and billboards, and exist as an app for party members to read and be quizzed on daily.\", \"In 2021, the government placed a three-hour gaming limit per week on minors, and cracked down on \\\"effeminate\\\" men and celebrity fandom in a bid to steer China's culture industry in a \\\"healthier\\\" direction.\", \"\\\"The Chinese Communist Party has tightened its control over the society and I think this is counterproductive,\\\" Professor Xia said, adding that \\\"many ordinary people are angry\\\".\", \"While leaders before him have opted to keep a low profile, under President Xi China has become more assertive with international diplomacy, ramping up military threats, inflammatory language and economic punishment.\", \"To sustain the country's global rise, Xi has been investing heavily in the $1 trillion international Belt and Road trade and infrastructure initiative, and modernising China's military.\", \"This military presence has been on display with repeated aggressive actions in the contested South China Sea and several instances of planes being flown into Taiwan's Air Defence Identification Zone as Xi vows to \\\"reunify\\\" the island.\", \"This \\\"Wolf-Warrior\\\" approach to diplomacy has been ruffling international feathers, and increasingly straining China's relationships with the US and Australia.\", \"Professor Mahbubani said that alienating the American business community was
