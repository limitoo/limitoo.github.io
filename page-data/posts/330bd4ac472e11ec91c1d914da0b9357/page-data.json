Many voiced their anger on Twitter, using the hashtag #firebobbykotick.\", \"Workers had staged a similar walkout in July after a lawsuit by a California employment agency accused Activision of fostering a culture of pervasive sexual harassment against women.\", \"A Wall Street Journal article published on Tuesday morning said Mr. Kotick, who has led the gaming publisher since 2008, had known for years about complaints of sexual harassment and assault that women had brought against various men at the company, and had not taken action. In one case, the article said, he intervened to retain an accused employee. The article said some women had accused Mr. Kotick himself of mistreatment, in and out of the workplace. Mr. Kotick denied many of the accusations, including one of the mistreatment claims against him; he apologized for another.\", \"As Activision\\u2019s stock price dropped 6 percent on Tuesday, Mr. Kotick released a statement saying that the Journal article \\u201cpresents a misleading view of Activision Blizzard and our C.E.O.\\u201d and that he acted on reports of sexual misconduct.\", \"He also shared a video message with employees, saying that \\u201canyone who doubts my conviction to be the most welcoming, inclusive workplace doesn\\u2019t really appreciate how important this is to me.\\u201d\", \"In the months since the lawsuit, filed by California\\u2019s Department of Fair Employment and Housing, Mr. Kotick has sought to portray Activision as having turned over a new leaf, even as legal actions pile up. They include a pending settlement with a federal employment agency and an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\", \"In an earnings call this month, he hailed new zero-harassment policies and commitments to companywide diversity. Activision has also emphasized that much of the alleged wrongdoing occurred at Blizzard, a subsidiary.\", \"\\u201cWe should have done a better job in ensuring our values were embraced across the company,\\u201d Mr. Kotick said on the call.\", \"Mr. Kotick has also faced difficult questions from investors. This summer, Activision took the rare move of temporarily delaying a vote on a $155 million pay package for the chief executive because the company needed to rouse more investor support, which it narrowly did.\", \"Last month, Mr. Kotick said he was asking Activision\\u2019s board to reduce his total compensation to $62,500 until it decided that the company had met its diversity goals. The board is made up of Mr. Kotick; the chairman, Brian Kelly, a longtime Activision employee; and eight independent members.\", \"\\u201cThe board remains confident that Bobby Kotick appropriately addressed workplace issues brought to his attention,\\u201d it said in a statement Tuesday. \\u201cThe goals we have set for ourselves are both critical and ambitious. The board remains confident in Bobby Kotick\\u2019s leadership, commitment and ability to achieve these goals.\\u201d\", \"Current and former employees said changes made by the company had not been enough.\", \"\\u201cWe have instituted our own Zero Tolerance Policy,\\u201d the ABK Workers Alliance, a group of employees at the Activision, Blizzard and King studios fighting for change, tweeted Tuesday. \\u201cWe will not be silenced until Bobby Kotick has been replaced as CEO.\\u201d\", \"Workers have also called for the creation of a union, a rarity in the North American gaming industry.\", \"Despite employee pressure on Mr. Kotick, analysts said his position seemed secure for now.\", \"\\u201cIt always takes a lot to get rid of a sitting C.E.O.,\\u201d said Doug Creutz, a video game analyst at Cowen. \\u201cA lot of things clearly happened on Bobby\\u2019s watch that shouldn\\u2019t have happened, and he\\u2019s responsible for them, but it doesn\\u2019t seem like there\\u2019s anything that would force the board\\u2019s hand, yet.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"330bd4ac472e11ec91c1d914da0b9357"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"330bd4ac472e11ec91c1d914da0b9357"}},
