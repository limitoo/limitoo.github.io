For a week, she was overjoyed. The paralyzing uncertainty she\\u2019d been living with since March 2020 \\u2014 over how long Australia\\u2019s borders would be shut, how long she was willing to put her life on hold, what she could do at home in India knowing she might have to drop it at any second \\u2014 was coming to an end, she thought.\", \"Then the Australian government pushed the border reopening back at least two weeks because of the new Omicron coronavirus variant.\", \"\\u201cI ended up crying when I got the news,\\u201d Ms. Pandey, 26, said. \\u201cWe finally got a date. We were so relieved. And now suddenly it\\u2019s like: now what?\\u201d\", \"The emergence of the new variant has plunged everyone into another exhausting round of uncertainty. Holiday plans and trips to visit family interstate or overseas are suddenly up in the air as we hold our breath and wait.\", \"Making plans for the future when a new coronavirus variant could come at any moment is difficult.

She\\u2019s already spent months doing research on Australia, choosing the right degree to study, applying for admission and for a visa, on top of the 20 months she\\u2019s been waiting. Her fianc\\u00e9 has already spent years in Australia and started building a life for both of them.\", \"\\u201cShould we just wait and keep waiting? In that case, I lose out on time.
