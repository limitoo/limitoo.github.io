Wake Me When I\\u2019m Free,\\u201d opens on Jan. 21, in a newly built, temporary 20,000-square-foot space in the entertainment complex L.A. Live in downtown Los Angeles.\", \"Shakur, a hip-hop artist, poet, actor and activist who released his first album in 1991 and went on to become one of the top-selling rappers in the 1990s, was killed in Las Vegas in 1996, at age 25. The case was never solved. He also acted in films including John Singleton\\u2019s \\u201cPoetic Justice,\\u201d in which he starred opposite Janet Jackson. In the decades since his death, he has inspired dozens of albums, books, movies, theater productions and even a hologram. In 2017, he was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\", \"The exhibition, named after a Shakur poem included on the album \\u201cThe Rose That Grew From Concrete, Volume 1\\u201d in 2000, features artifacts, contemporary art, music and multisensory elements in telling the story of Shakur\\u2019s life.\", \"\\u201cIt became evident very quickly that this was way bigger than his music,\\u201d Arron Saxe, one of the exhibition\\u2019s co-producers, said in a phone interview on Monday. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t talk about Tupac without talking about Afeni, his mother, and you can\\u2019t talk about Afeni without talking about her involvement in the Panther Party, and you\\u2019re then talking about the connections with the Civil Rights movement.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s \\u201ca story about race in America using Tupac as a proxy,\\u201d he added.\", \"Shakur\\u2019s estate worked for more than six years and has a number of partners, among them Nwaka Onwusa, the chief curator at the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, and Jeremy Hodges, the show\\u2019s creative director and founder of Project Art Collective. Shakur\\u2019s activism and his music will be highlighted, Saxe said. Part of the exhibition\\u2019s aim, he said, will be to demystify the legend.\", \"\\u201cThere will be notebooks, song lyrics, poetry and also everyday stuff like shopping lists, and phone numbers on pieces of paper,\\u201d Saxe said. Humanizing him is a focus \\u201cbecause he and a lot of these other figures are mythical, larger than life.\\u201d\", \"After about six months, the exhibition will travel to other cities in the United States and internationally.\"]","href_hash":"561607ca3c0111ec9cac000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"561607ca3c0111ec9cac000017025a03"}},
