Really, really loves Christmas.\", \"\\u201cI have Santa collections from when I was little,\\u201d said Ms. Schwab, 62, a retired school administrator. Thus, it became a source of annual annoyance that decking the house with boughs of holly (and twinkly lights) was frowned upon in her Joliet, Ill., neighborhood until Thanksgiving had come and gone.\", \"Almost two years ago, Ms. Schwab and her husband, Robert, a retired carpenter and contractor, began to contemplate relocating to a place with a vastly different feel. \\u201cWe started researching, and Santa Claus, Ind., came up,\\u201d Ms. Schwab said of the town in the southern part of the Hoosier state that bills itself as \\u201cAmerica\\u2019s Christmas Hometown.\\u201d\", \"There\\u2019s plenty to back up the boosterism: Yule-themed businesses like Santa\\u2019s Toys, Santa\\u2019s Candy Castle, Santa Claus Haus, the Santa Claus Museum & Village and street names like Silver Bell Circle, Mistletoe Drive, Donder Lane and the main stem, Christmas Boulevard. Statues of St. Nick stand sentry at, among other spots, the post office, the town hall, Santa\\u2019s Lodge, a local hotel, and the Key Associates Signature Realty agency. The 2017 Lifetime movie \\u201cSnowed-Inn Christmas\\u201d was set \\u2014 though not shot \\u2014 in Santa Claus.\", \"In October of 2020, the Schwabs headed to Santa Claus on a reconnaissance vacation, fell in love with what they saw and signed a contract to build their retirement home on a half-acre corner lot in Christmas Lake Village, a gated community that is home to three lakes \\u2014 Holly, Noel and Christmas \\u2014 and home to 90 percent of the burg\\u2019s 3,000 residents. This past June, the couple moved into a custom-designed three-bedroom ranch house.\", \"\\u201cWe looked at other towns near here that had equal value in terms of real estate, but they didn\\u2019t have that extra Santa thing. That was the deciding factor,\\u201d Ms. Schwab said. \\u201cThis is an enchanting, darling place \\u2014 just Christmas all the time.\\u201d\", \"Partly because of the pandemic, partly because of the small-town appeal, partly because of the bang for the buck (comparatively low taxes, lots of services) and partly because of \\u2014 well, let\\u2019s call it ho-ho-ho-cation, ho-ho-ho-cation, ho-ho-ho-cation \\u2014 Santa Claus, Ind., and the similarly Santa-centric Frankenmuth, Mich., are enjoying a vogue.\", \"(Santa-themed communities where real estate isn\\u2019t doing quite as well may feel a Grinch-like envy: Despite attractions like the towering Santa statue outside Santa Claus House, a toy store and sweet shop, there has been no uptick in home sales in North Pole, Alaska, where, according to its motto, \\u201cthe spirit of Christmas lives year-round.\\u201d \\u201cWe wish,\\u201d said Stacy Harvill, the managing broker at Madden Real Estate, in North Pole.)\", \"The Schwabs\\u2019 house is one of 50 built in Christmas Lake Village in the last two years. \\u201cTypically, we average two or three annually,\\u201d said Chris Ambs, the subdivision\\u2019s property manager. And while it\\u2019s also typical to have 20 or 30 houses for sale in the Village at any given time, thanks to the high demand, there were only five available in mid-November, said the town\\u2019s treasurer, Kelly Greulich.\", \"\\u201cWe have a lot of people moving to Santa Claus from California, Illinois and Minnesota,\\u201d said Lisa Gengelbach, a broker at Key Associates. \\u201cA lot of them are retiring here, but there are families coming, too. We have great schools.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Gengelbach added: \\u201cThe name of the community is what brings a lot of people here, and the feel keeps them here. But it\\u2019s not over the top; it\\u2019s not gaudy. It\\u2019s not like everything is red and white.\\u201d\", \"Since the start of the pandemic, Frankenmuth (population: 5,000) has had a similar influx of new residents, chiefly from the Detroit metro area, 80 miles south.\", \"\\u201cEither they had family ties here or they\\u2019d heard good things about it, and because of Covid, they could work from home,\\u201d said Andrew Keller, an owner of JMW Real Estate, which has done more than $15 million in business in Frankenmuth this year, nearly a 50 percent jump over 2019. The price of a house, Mr. Keller said, has increased 12 to 20 percent in the last year and a half.\", \"The local landscape, about three square miles, includes Bronner\\u2019s Christmas Wonderland, which styles itself as the world\\u2019s largest Christmas store; canopies of lights on Main Street; and, from downtown to the north end of the city, 158 light-wrapped trees. The 2019 television film \\u201cA Christmas Movie Christmas\\u201d was shot \\u2014 though not set \\u2014 in Frankenmuth.\", \"This past July, in search of more space, Lewis Kolak moved with his wife, Lauren, and the couple\\u2019s two young children from their home in Rochester, a Detroit suburb, to a 3,500-square-foot Tudor-style house on five acres in Frankenmuth.\", \"\\u201cWe had a quarter of an acre in Rochester, and a 2,400-square-foot house in Rochester. Nothing against that,\\u201d said Mr. Kolak, 43, a lawyer who grew up near Frankenmuth and still has family in the area. \\u201cBut we wanted something different for our post-pandemic life.\\u201d\", \"He continued: \\u201cI now have a dedicated office and study, because my wife and I work remotely, but we still have access to the Detroit market within an hour. When you walk down Main Street, it\\u2019s like a Hallmark movie. Is it a draw to live in a community like that? Absolutely. Is it the reason we moved? No, but it\\u2019s a value added.\\u201d\", \"Young families like the Kolaks are attracted to the school system. Retirees, some of whom have moved into a new condo development in town, \\u201care choosing our community because it\\u2019s fun and festive all the time,\\u201d said Jamie Furbush, the president and chief executive of the Frankenmuth Chamber of Commerce and Convention & Visitors Bureau. \\u201cIf you celebrate Christmas and you want to be in a place where that\\u2019s valued, we celebrate Christmas in a big way.\\u201d\", \"Brian and Penny Wanless lived in Frankenmuth for 40 years and would have happily stayed forever, but four years ago, Mr. Wanless, an insurance specialist, was transferred to the western part of Michigan, and the couple settled in Lowell, a small city near Grand Rapids.\", \"\\u201cThe first Christmas there, I was saying, \\u2018Where are the holiday decorations? Where are they? And then I was thinking, \\u2018Don\\u2019t be negative, Miss Penny.\\u2019 The town did have lights up, but it didn\\u2019t have anything else,\\u201d said Ms. Wanless, 60, a teacher\\u2019s aide.\", \"When her husband began working remotely during Covid, she saw her moment: \\u201cI told him, \\u2018I don\\u2019t want to spend another Christmas in Lowell.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The day after Thanksgiving, the couple closed on a ranch-style house in Frankenmuth, paying $459,000. \\u201cHere I am, 60 years old, and I\\u2019m driving around looking at the new Christmas lights in town,\\u201d Ms. Wanless said.\", \"As for the Schwabs, they recently bought a 600-pound concrete Santa statue; it\\u2019s a permanent addition to their front yard.\", \"\\u201cWe couldn\\u2019t have done that in Illinois,\\u201d said Ms. Schwab, who began decorating for the holidays \\u2014 ropes of lights on the wrought-iron fence, red and green spotlights illuminating the trees on their property \\u2014 in mid-November.\", \"\\u201cOur new neighbors here are saying, \\u2018Do it early,\\u2019\\u201d she added. \\u201cOne of them told me, \\u2018Nancy, you can leave things up all year.\\u2019\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e71bee085ccf11eca4125f5a3a0a8da9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e71bee085ccf11eca4125f5a3a0a8da9"}},
