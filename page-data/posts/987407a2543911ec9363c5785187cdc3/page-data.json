When it comes to the flow of migrants, cartel smuggling rings play a major role.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-03T05:05:27.000Z","content":"[\"United States Border Patrol encountered over 158,500 people in the month of October. Though the U.S.-Mexico border spans almost 2,000 miles and is patrolled by nine individual sectors, almost 29 percent of these people showed up in one sector\\u2014the Rio Grande Valley.\", \"While 29 percent may not seem like a significant figure, the next-busiest sector, Del Rio, encountered 17 percent of the total number of crossings. What makes the Rio Grande different from other sectors is that across U.S. soil, the C\\u00e1rtel del Golfo (CDG) reigns supreme, and that particular cartel stands as one of Mexico's top human smugglers.\", \"Garino, who used to work in law enforcement, regularly deals with border authorities seizing massive amounts of drugs at his port of entry, a product of Sinaloa's focus. However, waves of migrants like those seen in Rio Grande have not been an issue, and he expects that has to do with the preferred interests of Nogales' neighboring cartel.\", \"\\\"Every day, this fentanyl, there's all kinds of drugs, heroin, cocaine, being busted at the border,\\\" Garino said. \\\"These past two years (other border cities) have had issues with migrants, under both the Trump administration and with this administration, but they have not come to Nogales.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944691/topshot-guatemala-mexico-el-salvador-us-migration.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Drug cartels exert a level of control over American ports, watching over which illicit products make it across the border, even if those \\\"products\\\" are people. Here, Salvadoran migrants heading in a caravan to the U.S. cross the Suchiate River to Mexico, as seen from Ciudad Tecun Uman, Guatemala, on November 2, 2018.</div>\", \"A November report published jointly by the Migration Policy Institute (MPI), the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), and the Civic Data Design Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) estimated that 55 percent of migrants hired a smuggler to reach their final destination. And it just so happens that the Border Patrol sectors that have witnessed the most migrant encounters sit across from territories controlled by cartels engaged in smuggling.\", \"Part of the Del Rio sector sits across from territory run by the C\\u00e1rtel de Jalisco Nueva Generaci\\u00f3n (CJNG), which engages in human smuggling. The fourth-most overrun Border Patrol territory, the Tucson Sector, which encountered over 12 percent of October's crossings, is also under CJNG rule. The third-busiest sector, Yuma, which accounts for 14 percent of encounters, is under Sinaloa control. For financial year 2021 as a whole, the Rio Grande and Del Rio sectors were the only two to witness more than 250,000 migrants in 2021, the Pew Research Center reports.\", \"With former U.S. ambassador to Mexico Christopher Landau estimating that drug cartels could control up to 40 percent of Mexico's territory, these multibillion dollar entities hold an extreme amount of power over movement in Mexico. Their tactics to remain in control of their region often invoke violence, particularly in the case of CJNG, and the MPI report states that most migrants view hiring a smuggler as a means of avoiding \\\"serious safety concerns.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944692/mexico-drugs-chapo-guzman-arrest.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Despite the arrest of leader Joaquin Guzman Loera aka \\\"El Chapo\\\" Guzman, the Sinaloa cartel remains Mexico's most powerful.

Furthermore, Russia has bolstered its presence in Latin America, leaving the U.S. with less room to take punitive measures aimed at influencing policy.\", \"These considerations, combined with the regulations placed on the DEA make dealing with Mexico's drug cartels a greater challenge, especially as the country remains under the leadership of Obrador.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944695/lopez-obrador-daily-morning-briefing.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">President of Mexico Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has rejected U.S. help to crack down on cartels.

When critics condemned the visit, Obrador defended his actions, calling her a \\\"respectable old lady.\\\" Furthermore, Obrador ordered the release of El Chapo's son from government detention in 2020 after Mexican military forces faced a barrage of Sinaloa gunmen after making the capture. These actions, Peschard said, show that the president is partial to the Sinaloa cartel.\", \"Reuters reports that former President Donald Trump offered U.S. support in going after the cartels, only for Obrador to rebuff the offer. Obrador's government picked up a victory last month with the apprehension of Rosalinda Gonz\\u00e1lez Valencia, wife of CJNG leader Nemesio \\\"El Mencho\\\" Oseguera, who was said to have been in charge of the group's finances.\", \"When it comes to tackling the cartels, Obrador, who has been critical of President Joe Biden, may be focused on confronting Mexico's cartel issues on his own terms. America may continue to face waves of smuggled migrants while this happens, but Peschard stresses that acting carefully may be the Biden administration's best means of maintaining influence over the region.\"]","href_hash":"987407a2543911ec9363c5785187cdc3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"987407a2543911ec9363c5785187cdc3"}},
