But as he has learned in Washington, charm offensives have their limits.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-02T13:02:05.000Z","content":"[\"GLASGOW \\u2014 President Biden\\u2019s major goal for his second foreign trip since taking office was to reassert America\\u2019s ability to lead the world on climate change before it is too late. But he also wanted to reassert Joe Biden.\", \"From the moment he landed in Rome on Friday for the Group of 20 meeting, and then traveled to the climate summit in Glasgow, Mr. Biden took on the role of a traveling salesman, exulting in the backslapping, personalized politics that he believes makes him a strong negotiator and can translate into substantive deal making.\", \"\\u201cIt never ceases to amaze me when you\\u2019re looking at someone straight in the eye when you\\u2019re trying to get something done,\\u201d Mr. Biden said in a news conference in Rome. \\u201cThey know me. I know them. We can get things done together.\\u201d \", \"Mr. Biden did take some wins back to Washington with him on Tuesday night, including a new global minimum tax for companies, as well as climate agreements to reduce methane emissions \\u2014 a deal he said was \\u201cthe foundational commitment\\u201d of his administration \\u2014 and deforestation. But if those deals were significant, they were largely finalized before his trip. \", \"Confronted with a lack of consensus among world leaders on how to move forward globally, and with his climate agenda hanging in the balance in Congress at home, Mr. Biden\\u2019s time in Glasgow laid bare the reality that the personal style he prefers has not yet helped him close the gulf between his ambition and what he has been able to achieve. \", \"\\u201cHe enjoys the personal side of personal diplomacy,\\u201d said Richard Haass, a former senior State Department and national security official who is now president of the Council on Foreign Relations. \\u201cMy own view is he exaggerates its impact. All the charm in the world is not going to bring Brazil around on the rain forests, or Australia around on coal, or China or Russia around on much of anything. \", \"\\u201cDiplomacy will only get him so far.\\u201d\", \"In Glasgow, China and Russia, two of the world\\u2019s largest producers of greenhouse gas emissions, sent negotiating teams to the conference, known as COP, but not their leaders. Chinese President Xi Jinping sent only a written statement, promising that his country \\u201cwill continue to prioritize ecological conservation and pursue a green and low- carbon path to development.\\u201d \", \"Dozens of other heads of state delivered introductory statements about keeping shared climate goals alive yet offered competing ideas for how to do it. \", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s simply no consensus,\\u201d Mr. Haass added, \\u201cand the United States cannot pound the table and insist on one.\\u201d \", \"At a farewell news conference, Mr. Biden, again seeking to assert American leadership, said that he thought it was a \\u201cbig mistake\\u201d for China not to show up at the conference. \\u201cThey\\u2019ve lost their ability to influence people around the world, and people here at COP,\\u201d Mr. Biden said. \", \"He suggested he was open to playing a long game when it comes to persuading China to come to the table: He said that he and Mr. Xi had at least a nascent relationship from his time as vice president, and said they\\u2019ve spoken \\u201cat least five or six hours\\u201d by telephone since January. \", \"But he was also fundamentally optimistic about the ability of democracies to work together. Mr. Biden spent much of his time in Glasgow telegraphing that he is doing all he can with the power he has, either through executive action or restoring the sort of environmental regulations that were eviscerated during the Trump era. \", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re all on the same team with essentially the same issues,\\u201d he said to allies, including Boris Johnson, Britain\\u2019s prime minister, and Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, during a meeting on a U.S.-sponsored global infrastructure initiative. \\u201cDemocracy is still the best way for delivering results.\\u201d \", \"But the limits of those results could sometimes be starkly evident: In a meeting about the new global pact to limit methane emissions, organizers displayed a map showing the 90 countries who had signed the accord colored in blue. Yet several of the world\\u2019s major emitters, including China, Russia and India, appeared as vast white spaces, since they had not signed on.\", \"Mr. Biden\\u2019s strategy was to treat the absence of Mr. Xi and another rival, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, as an opportunity to prove that the world\\u2019s democracies can deliver. Earlier in the trip, his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, sought to ratchet up the pressure on China, telling reporters on Air Force One en route to Glasgow that China had \\u201can obligation to step up to greater ambition as we go forward.\\u201d \", \"Wang Wenbin, a spokesman for the Chinese ministry, soon fired back, demanding that the United States shoulder more responsibility for reducing greenhouse gas pollution and provide more support to poorer countries hit hardest by the consequences of global warming.\", \"\\u201cIn particular, the climate policies of the United States, a major historical emitter, have constantly flipped and flopped and gone backward, and its own emissions have reached a peak and begun to decline only in recent years,\\u201d Mr. Wang said.\", \"Yet beneath the bluster, the relationship with China remains the most critical going forward. Mr. Biden and Mr. Xi have not met in person since Mr. Biden has been in office, but are expected to hold a virtual meeting later this year that officials have said could help the two men establish ties. \", \"The summit here will continue until Nov. 12 and Mr. Biden\\u2019s is leaving behind a delegation led by John Kerry, who helped secure the Paris climate agreement in 2015 as secretary of state and now serves as the Administration\\u2019s climate envoy. On Tuesday, Mr. Kerry said he expected new financial commitments to fulfill a long-delayed promise to provide $100 billion a year in aid for developing countries to fight and adapt to global warming, though it was unclear if every country would make good on its pledges. \", \"Throughout the trip, Mr. Biden, who faces dreary approval numbers at home, appeared confident that the same measured approach he took abroad would ultimately result in the passage of two key bills that await him back in Washington: a $1.85 trillion social safety net measure that includes provisions for clean energy, and a $1 trillion infrastructure bill. \", \"Representative Ro Khanna, a California Democrat who has been working with the president to refashion his climate agenda, said in an interview that Mr. Biden told him ahead of his trip to Europe that \\u201cAmerican prestige\\u201d was on the line. \", \"The president, Mr. Khanna said, told him that \\u201cwhen he meets with foreign leaders, they tout the benefits of autocracy and authoritarianism. He wants to be able to show that democracies can govern and do big things, and do big things with the appropriate speed.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden is eager to establish himself as a global leader of collective action on climate policy. That\\u2019s a drastically different tack than the approach taken by the Trump administration, which rolled back more than 100 environmental protection rules and, some experts argue, accelerated the effects of climate change. \", \"\\u201cThe first thing to do is to stop the bleeding,\\u201d said Leah Stokes, an associate professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who works on climate and the environment and has been advising Senate Democrats on how to craft the legislation. \\u201cThe next thing to do is make progress, get back to the starting line and start going in the right direction.\\u201d \", \"\", \"The progress Mr. Biden had hoped for has been stalled by Democratic infighting in Congress. The climate-focused measure has been whittled down from its most expansive form, in large part because Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia and one of the party\\u2019s two holdouts on the spending package, said that he would not vote on the package until he knew more about the plan. \", \"But if Mr. Biden can secure passage, the bill \\u2014 which includes $555 billion to fight climate change, largely through tax incentives for low-emission sources of energy \\u2014 would be the most ambitious plan adopted by the United States yet. \", \"Mr. Manchin\\u2019s reluctance has not seemed to temper Mr. Biden\\u2019s optimism about having the votes to pass his agenda in both chambers of Congress, with no Republicans expected to support it. \", \"\", \"\", \"\\u201cI believe that Joe will be there,\\u201d Mr. Biden said, referring to Mr. Manchin. \\u201cI think we\\u2019ll get this done\\u201d\", \" \", \" \"]","href_hash":"0615c43a3c2011ec8d76000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0615c43a3c2011ec8d76000017025a03"}},
