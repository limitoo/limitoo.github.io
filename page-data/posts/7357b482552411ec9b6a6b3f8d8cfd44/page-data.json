The successive waves of disappointing or downright horrifying information have been difficult to absorb: the acceleration toward the dismantling of reproductive rights after oral argument in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\\u2019s Health, which could have a life-threatening impact on women experiencing risky pregnancies; another fatal school shooting, this one in Michigan; and the emergence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus.\", \"At least for the moment, as The Times\\u2019s Andrew Jacobs reported Thursday about the new variant, public health experts note there\\u2019s \\u201cno firm evidence that Omicron is more dangerous than previous variants like Delta.\\u201d We will have more information as research continues in the coming weeks. As always, expert recommendations may be altered if, for example, it turns out that Omicron causes more people to become seriously ill, if it causes reinfections, or if, as Dr. Ashish Jha, the dean of Brown University\\u2019s School of Public Health recently outlined in a Times Opinion essay, it is able to evade vaccines.\", \"I called Sean O\\u2019Leary, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at Children\\u2019s Hospital Colorado, and asked him if what we know about the new variant changes how we should think about protecting our kids, even the ones too young to be vaccinated yet.\", \"O\\u2019Leary said: \\u201cFor me, it\\u2019s not changing that much of what we need to do. The problem is so many people are not doing what they need to do,\\u201d because of exhaustion and because policymakers in some parts of the country wish for the pandemic to be over. What we need to do, especially in places with high community transmission rates, is to continue to wear masks inside when it\\u2019s crowded and to get vaccinated, O\\u2019Leary told me.\", \"Join Jessica Grose and the comedian Michelle Buteau at a virtual event for Times subscribers on Dec. 8. R.S.V.P. here.\", \"My kids, who are 5 and 8, just got their second dose of vaccine. My husband and I are grateful for this, and as a family we\\u2019re planning to fly domestically during Christmas vacation to see relatives. I asked O\\u2019Leary if families like mine should reconsider our plans. He said that based on what we know right now about Omicron, it\\u2019s fine to travel for the holidays within the country, as long as you\\u2019re observing safety protocols. His advice for the near term: Go outside, absorb the sunshine if it\\u2019s available, and try to forget about Covid as much as you can.\", \"Considering the reckoning over Roe v. Wade that\\u2019s in progress at the Supreme Court, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett\\u2019s suggestion that the option of putting babies up for adoption makes the choice between ending a pregnancy and becoming a parent somehow less fraught, I urge you to read what Merritt Tierce wrote for The Times Magazine: \\u201cThe Abortion I Didn\\u2019t Have.\\u201d\", \"She writes about an unintended pregnancy she carried when she was 19. She didn\\u2019t put her son up for adoption because \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t imagine growing a baby inside my body, giving birth to it and then handing it over to someone else.\\u201d She chose to become a parent. But her life was still profoundly impacted by perceiving, at least then, that abortion was not an option. As she puts it:\", \"Finally, if you can bear to read it, The Times\\u2019s Dana Goldstein has a smart look at active shooter drills in American schools, and whether or not they\\u2019re effective. I don\\u2019t know quite how to process the fact that we have to have this conversation, that these are the conditions we\\u2019ve accepted as a society. But I\\u2019m grateful to have this reporting to remind me that these deadly and horrible events are rare, even though they\\u2019ve come to feel routine, and despite being reminded of The Onion\\u2019s macabre joke headline: \\u201c\\u2018No Way to Prevent This,\\u2019 Says Only Nation Where This Regularly Happens.\\u201d\", \"If you want a chance to get your Tiny Victory published, find us on Instagram @NYTparenting and use the hashtag #tinyvictories; email us; or enter your Tiny Victory at the bottom of this page.
