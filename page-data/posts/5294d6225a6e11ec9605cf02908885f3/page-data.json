It’s really a family affair.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-11T10:37:53.000Z","content":"[\"Picture the ideal holiday spread: There are rich foods, festive place settings, twinkling candles. Maybe it includes multiple gravy boats and not one but two sweet potato side dishes. You might find a collection of celebratory beverages, wine and beer of various types, but there is one staple that is nonnegotiable for many households: a bottle of crisp, sparkling Martinelli\\u2019s cider.\", \"Most hosts will tell you it\\u2019s for the kid\\u2019s table. But it\\u2019s also, decidedly, for the dads.\", \"More of an apple juice guy than a beer dude, the Martinelli\\u2019s dad \\u2014 an American archetype, I\\u2019d like to posit \\u2014 embraces tradition and simple luxuries. He (though the Martinelli\\u2019s dad need not be a \\u201che\\u201d or even a \\u201cdad\\u201d) loves the crinkle of foil and the dark green of the glass. He likes to swing by the grocery store to pick up a bottle before a party.\", \"And he is part of a distinct cohort that is responsible for the brand\\u2019s skyrocketing sales this time of year. According to the company, 70 to 75 percent of 25.4-ounce Martinelli\\u2019s sparkling cider bottles sold each year are purchased between Halloween and New Year\\u2019s Eve.\", \"For this particular consumer, if it comes down to Veuve Clicquot or Martinelli\\u2019s, there\\u2019s no contest. Pass the kid champagne, please.\", \"That the sparkling cider is nonalcoholic is a tradition that dates back to Prohibition. The Martinelli family, immigrants from Switzerland, had been making hard cider in Watsonville, Calif., since 1868, but when the sale of alcohol became illegal in 1920, S. Martinelli & Company had to shelve that product. In addition to selling apple juice starting in 1917, the family made money by bottling Coca-Cola at their plant. On the side, they also began making single-serve sparkling juice, said John Martinelli, the chairman of the company, in a recent interview.\", \"Mr. Martinelli, a fourth-generation leader of the business, recently ceded his role as chief executive to Gun Ruder, who introduced himself as the \\u201cfirst nonfamily member to run the family business.\\u201d (Still, by most definitions, he is family; Mr. Martinelli\\u2019s wife is Mr. Ruder\\u2019s sister.)\", \"Both Mr. Martinelli, 64, and Mr. Ruder, 51, are real Martinelli\\u2019s dads, with plenty of stories of keeping their families and friends well stocked in \\u201cbubble juice,\\u201d as Mr. Martinelli\\u2019s kids called the sparkling cider when they were little.\", \"Even after stepping down as chief executive, Mr. Martinelli continues to taste every day\\u2019s production of apple juice and cider so that he can pick up any flavor variations.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s one of those things that is kind of a family tradition that was passed down,\\u201d he said, brightly, adding, \\u201cI do believe I have a very perceptive palate, especially as it relates to apple juice and apple juice flavors.\\u201d\", \"In the late 1950s, about the time Mr. Martinelli was born, his father and grandfather decided to kick up production of their sparkling juice and market it as a \\u201cdelightfully nonalcoholic\\u201d alternative to champagne.\", \"Sales-wise, the beverage had a bit of a slow start. \\u201cBut what happened was people started serving it to their kids,\\u201d Mr. Martinelli said. \\u201cIt was a way the children could be festive with their families.\\u201d\", \"Today, Martinelli\\u2019s sparkling cider comes in eight flavors and three sizes (the 25.4-ounce bottle, which the company refers to as its \\u201ciconic champagne bottle product,\\u201d usually retails for $3 to $6). There is Classic Apple Cider, Blush, Apple-Grape, Apple-Cranberry, and in more limited distribution, Apple-Pomegranate, Apple-Peach, Apple-Mango and Pear Cider. There are also organic editions.\", \"In recent years, the company has considered ways to get \\u201cbeyond the juice aisle,\\u201d Mr. Ruder said. In particular, \\u201cthe whole \\u2018sober curious\\u2019 movement has caught our attention.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere used to be a stigma, to be quite honest, to the nonalcoholic beverage,\\u201d Mr. Ruder said. But now that people are drinking \\u201cnonalcoholic on some nights and alcohol on others, there\\u2019s a real opportunity for us to be part of that,\\u201d he said.\", \"The company, Mr. Ruder said, has no intention of wading into any waters that stray from the vision of a \\u201cpremium fruit forward product.\\u201d (Lest anyone think the company is opposed to alcohol, Martinelli\\u2019s recently released a limited run of hard cider, inspired by the family\\u2019s pre-Prohibition offerings.)\", \"But one area where the company is ready to embrace change is in its marketing. In 2019, the brand tried out a modest Twitter campaign, using the hashtag #nexttimemartinellis, to encourage consumers to take a night off from alcohol. It didn\\u2019t get much traction.\", \"Truthfully, Mr. Ruder said, \\u201cwe\\u2019ve learned a lot from TikTok.\\u201d\", \"Last year, the Martinelli\\u2019s dads at the helm of the brand were surprised by a viral moment on TikTok after some young people in Fresno, Calif., discovered that the sound of biting into the plastic of the Martinelli\\u2019s single-serve apple juice bottle mimicked the sound of biting into an actual apple. (The crunchy auditory effect was not intentional by the company, Mr. Martinelli said.)\", \"Celebrities including Lizzo and David Dobrik posted their own videos trying it out, and the hashtags #Martinelli and #AppleJuiceChallenge received hundreds of millions of views.\", \"Both dads initially heard about the trend from their daughters.\", \"Mr. Ruder\\u2019s youngest daughters are 18 and 20. \\u201cThey were the first people who brought this to my attention,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd I said, \\u2018Well jeez just give me some bullet points.\\u2019\\u201d One of them sent him \\u201ctwo or three pages of data,\\u201d he recalled.\", \"Mr. Martinelli worried that the attention might be a bad thing \\u2014 that perhaps teenagers biting into Martinelli\\u2019s plastic bottles would lead them to bite into their glass bottles next. He recalled asking his daughters: \\u201cHow do I interpret this? Is it a good thing? Do I respond?\\u201d\", \"Don\\u2019t respond, his daughters advised, emphatically. Just let it happen.\", \"The Martinelli\\u2019s dads were further surprised by TikTok\\u2019s ability to lift sales. \\u201cIt didn\\u2019t just sell another bottle of juice,\\u201d Mr. Ruder said. \\u201cIt sold another 40 million bottles of juice in that category.\\u201d The viral trend also translated into sales of other Martinelli\\u2019s items, including its best seller, premium sparkling cider.\", \"Perhaps a new generation of Martinelli\\u2019s dads is in the making?\"]","href_hash":"5294d6225a6e11ec9605cf02908885f3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5294d6225a6e11ec9605cf02908885f3"}},
