After all, these names are far older than the ones we use every day when talking about Adelaide, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth and Sydney and are increasingly more commonly known.\", \"But when FIFA unveiled the tournament's official brand in October, these place names were flashed across the screen in big, bold letters alongside their New Zealand counterparts: T\\u0101maki Makaurau (Auckland), \\u014ctepoti (Dunedin), Kirikiriro (Hamilton), and Te Whanganui-a-Tara (Wellington).\", \"This is, in fact, no small thing.

Bringing those kids that lived five hours away down to somewhere where they've never even seen the sport before \\u2013 and them having the time of their lives \\u2013 it really clicked for me that there's a lot of opportunity lost to people that live outside of capital cities and to people that don't have regular access to the same sports the rest of us sometimes take for granted.\", \"\\\"[Developing] the RAP is a great opportunity for football to start manoeuvring further in this space and ensure that community engagement is at the heart of everything we do; that cultural engagement and competency is fostered.

Sometimes sport is just being in a space that gives you something to look forward to. It's a massive support for a lot of people,\\\" Hagen said.\", \"\\\"I think football is really embedded in culture; it's fast-paced, it's exciting, it's accessible, it's relatable. It's strong in its sense of self and what it represents in every way. I think there's a great narrative to thread through that.\", \"\\\"One example are place names.\\u00a0Yes, while these events are in capital cities, they're also in places that have traditional names and have rich histories that outdate every one of us.\", \"\\\"[The World Cup] is\\u00a0a great way for those stories to come to life in a space like this. So that's what I really hope it looks like, and that's reflected not only in our players but our fans that will be attending, the way we broadcast and talk about it, the way it's written about, the way the commentators speak about it.\", \"\\\"It can't all be encompassed in just a flag; it's telling the stories of the diversity of our people, which hasn't really had the opportunity to be told well. What I really want to see is that storytelling, whether it be football-related or not.\", \"\\\"There's nothing more exciting than being able to share your culture on a world stage\\u00a0and global sporting tournaments provide the opportunity to change a nation and start conversations.
