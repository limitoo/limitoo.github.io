You can sign up here to receive it in your inbox each weekday morning.\", \"A long favorite tradition of mine in Times Opinion had been Nick Kristof\\u2019s annual holiday giving guide. It informed readers and always led to concrete results: Nick was able to raise millions of dollars for important causes, big and small, near and far. Now that Nick has left The Times, I have asked several of our writers to help me continue it. This week we are publishing Times Opinion\\u2019s first annual Holiday Giving Guide.\", \"After my children\\u2019s schools and our church, my personal giving for the past several years has focused on supporting journalism start-ups, especially on the local level. I believe the stories of our communities are important, that justice and accountability depend on journalism, and I don\\u2019t know how democracy in the United States survives without local news organizations.\", \"While I also subscribe to several publications, I am grateful that I can further support the innovation that nonprofits are bringing to the industry. If you too can donate, a few newsrooms I\\u2019d recommend this year are MLK50 in Memphis, Mississippi Today and The 19th.\", \"In 2019, an MLK50 investigation led to at least $11.9 million in medical debt being erased for thousands of people. More recently, it has done notable reporting on vaccine hesitancy. Mississippi Today is an invaluable resource for tracking federal spending in its state. The 19th has uncovered toxic workplaces and explored the ties between mental health and early childhood development.\", \"Of course, there are many other ways to support nonprofit journalism that report on and cover your own community. Or your passion may lie with charities that are focused on curing cancer, feeding the hungry or supplying humanitarian aid across the globe. Another excellent option is to give to The Times\\u2019s Neediest Cases Fund. This year\\u2019s campaign has a focus on nonprofit groups working to support and welcome Afghan refugees.\", \"Wherever you see the most need, to those of you who can give, my colleagues and I hope that this inaugural Times Opinion giving guide can offer you an array of options for where to put your money to good use.\", \"A few disclaimers: There are many worthy organizations deserving of support; the ones we\\u2019re highlighting here are a few that have come to the attention of our writers over the past year. The authors have no direct connection to any organization unless specifically mentioned in what they\\u2019ve written. If you\\u2019re interested in any organization mentioned, please go directly to its website. Neither the authors nor The Times will be able to address queries about the groups or facilitate donations.\", \"We\\u2019ll be adding entries to this collection on a rolling basis this week, so if nothing you see so far is making your wallet twitch, please do check back.\", \"Wishing you and your loved ones a wonderful holiday season, and happy giving!\"]","href_hash":"a5b1c5345bfd11ecb2a93fe36035ae40"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a5b1c5345bfd11ecb2a93fe36035ae40"}},
