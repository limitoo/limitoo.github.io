So when the script arrived for \\u201cNational Champions,\\u201d about a battle between the National Collegiate Athletic Association and student football players demanding fair compensation for their talents, Aduba was fast onboard.\", \"\\u201cI am myself an N.C.A.A. collegiate athlete and recipient of a scholarship and have known, sadly, many people who have been a part of the system and have benefited positively, of course, from the academic element \\u2014 and who have also had longtime needs they\\u2019ve not been able to meet,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSo I understood the complexity of the issue and the conversation.\\u201d\", \"In \\u201cNational Champions,\\u201d Aduba plays Katherine, a fixer hired to use whatever means necessary to get LeMarcus James (Stephan James) \\u2014 a Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback who incites a players\\u2019 strike three days before the national championship \\u2014 back in the game.\", \"But just as nobody is the villain in her own story, Aduba prefers to think of Katherine as a survivor tasked with a thankless job. The same could be said of her title role in the Broadway production of \\u201cClyde\\u2019s,\\u201d about the ex-con proprietor of a truck-stop diner where all the cooks have done time.\", \"Some may call Clyde the devil, but \\u201cI think she is really a reflection of every obstacle and aggression that our society holds for women like her,\\u201d she said. \\u201cShe is a direct reflection of the world.\\u201d\", \"Calling from her dressing room between performances, Aduba discussed her cultural necessities, like getting into character with a playlist, winding down to \\u201cThe Real Housewives\\u201d and curling up in a cozy robe, no matter where she is. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"1. \\u201cThe Real Housewives\\u201d I watch all of them, let me start there. Asking me, \\u201cDo I have a favorite?\\u201d feels like asking me, quite frankly, if I have a favorite child. They all have different tasks, different stories, different energies. It honestly feels like Grecian-level drama, just so over the top. So big, their troubles. All the emotions are huge. They just announced they\\u2019re going to do a \\u201cReal Housewives of Dubai,\\u201d and, sight unseen, I\\u2019m in.\", \"2. Sunglasses I love the personality of them, and what you\\u2019re choosing both to see and let be seen. I have some that are totally a reflector or super dark and nobody can see my eyes, but I can see out. I have some that are super faint, and we both can see each other. I have some that are really fun with a design on the frame. They\\u2019re a subtle way of showing personality. But if I\\u2019m out and about, and somebody wants to stop and talk, I usually wind up putting them up on my head so that we can meet eye-to-eye \\u2014 so that we\\u2019re talking to each other, not just like you\\u2019re talking to me.\", \"3. Live theater I feel like whether you\\u2019re onstage or in the audience, you are a part of the show. I think the audience is a huge character in the production who has their own role as well, whether we know it or not. The actors and the designers and everybody, especially when we\\u2019re in previews, are informing story based on the audience\\u2019s role. That\\u2019s that final critical piece. Here in \\u201cClyde\\u2019s,\\u201d when we were in rehearsal, obviously we could hear the play. But we can\\u2019t really know the play until that final actor-character comes into the space. And that\\u2019s the part of the audience.\", \"4. The New York Times Basic Pesto recipe This was not a New York Times plug. [Laughs] I legit have the screenshot on my phone, and it is a legit household favorite. The only thing that I add to it is a meat because it doesn\\u2019t call for any meat in your recipe. So I\\u2019ll either add grilled chicken that I\\u2019ll cook on the stovetop or a grilled turkey sausage or a vegan sausage. Take your recipe and add meat.\", \"5. Music to get into character When I settled into my dressing room, three of the things I made sure to immediately do was get a Bluetooth speaker, a teakettle and incense and candles. I really love \\u201980s and \\u201990s soft rock. There\\u2019s this app called Radio.com. I have it tuned to 94.7 The Wave, which is a station in Los Angeles that plays a steady stream of Lionel Richie, Stevie Wonder and Bonnie Raitt. I love it, along with like a Wilson Phillips \\u201cHold On.\\u201d Sade is in there. Adele. I just find it to be super calming, chill, and it feels good. I have a playlist for \\u201cClyde\\u2019s.\\u201d I\\u2019m pulling it up right now. The first song is \\u201cHood Bitch\\u201d by Fam0us.Twinsss. N.W.A.\\u2019s \\u201c[Expletive] the Police.\\u201d \\u201cReally From da Hood\\u201d by Plies. \\u201cRespectfully\\u201d by Big Jade. \\u201cGo Bestfriend\\u201d by Shyfromdatre. [Laughs] Yeah, these are very intense songs.\", \"6. Timehop You get Timehop, the app, then you allow it to have access to your photos. So then every day, if you have a picture that you took that day three years ago, two years ago, whatever, it\\u2019ll remind you. It\\u2019s just adorable. It\\u2019s a fun little app that you keep swiping from right to left.\", \"7. Robes Love a robe. I am wearing a robe right now. It is comfortable. It is relaxing. I can stay in one all day if I have nowhere to be and I\\u2019m just resting. When I go to a hotel room it\\u2019s right into that robe. I\\u2019m looking at a photo in my dressing room right now of my cousin, my sister and I, and I think we are either on the Serengeti or Kenya, all three of us in a robe.\", \"8. Continuing education I certainly treat it as a responsibility to make sure that I\\u2019m up to speed on how other people are experiencing the world, if it\\u2019s different from myself. Last year there was a documentary about the disabled called \\u201cCrip Camp,\\u201d and I remember it being really impactful. It\\u2019s important to see the focus of a spotlight put on communities that are often marginalized and seeing, OK, that is a very real thing. What I\\u2019m trying to get to is, what can I do in my world to make other people\\u2019s lives in whatever way I can equal to my own?\", \"9. Clean, white Converse All Stars It\\u2019s a nice, simple sneaker that lets you look polished through the day. You can run around in it. But if you need to go out for a quick dinner or if you find yourself wanting to go to a show, you can be dressed up and comfortable.\", \"10. Apple Watch Changed my life. Never have I felt more pressure to get my steps in. Never have I been more aware of timeliness. It also has reminders that have been great. Take breathing. Sometimes it will vibrate and be like, \\u201cYou should take a breath,\\u201d and it will be one minute of just slowing down and breathing. And I love that message. It\\u2019s so necessary, like a welcomed pause. At first, I was like, \\u201cDismiss, dismiss, dismiss.\\u201d And then it was like, \\u201cUzo, if you do not have one minute in this 24 hours to take a minute to yourself, what are we really saying then?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f7a8b8dc522511eca3c32f2d9f4fcc9f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f7a8b8dc522511eca3c32f2d9f4fcc9f"}},
