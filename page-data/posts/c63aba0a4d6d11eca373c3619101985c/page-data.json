As early as 1859, the Scottish reformer Samuel Smiles advocated in \\u201cSelf-Help\\u201d that \\u201cthe best education of a man is that which he gives himself.\\u201d By 1917, Charles E. Butler of Brentano\\u2019s bookstores told The Times that \\u201cself-improvement is the keynote of the day.\\u201d And in 1919, E. Haldiman-Julius began publishing his series of \\u201cLittle Blue Books,\\u201d cheap, pocket-size stapled editions of classics and new books that, as one of his ads in the Book Review boasted in 1924, were \\u201cdoing more to educate the country than any 10 universities put together.\\u201d\", \"But though Haldiman-Julius promised to bring the worlds of philosophy, poetry, literature and science to the general public, he didn\\u2019t guarantee that his Little Blue Books would help readers impress their dates. That would fall to the Pocket Classical Library, which sold its set of 12 heavily abridged volumes \\u2014 \\u201cNot too much. Just enough of each to give the reader a knowledge and understanding of the great men of literature\\u201d \\u2014 next to a photo of an earnest young businessman sitting alongside an attractive bobbed-hair flapper. \\u201cHe was glad he could tell her that he had read the noteworthy classics. Glad he could discuss with her the masterpieces of Hawthorne, Carlyle, Kipling, Poe.\\u201d\", \"Self-help books only grew in popularity, spurred, at least in part, by the success of Dale Carnegie\\u2019s \\u201cHow to Win Friends and Influence People\\u201d in 1936. Not long after that, The Times ran a story about the rector of Christ Church in Cambridge, Mass. \\u201cAttacking the advice of the current \\u2018self-improvement\\u2019 literature as being \\u2018stupid and inconsequential,\\u2019\\u201d the paper reported, \\u201cthe Rev. Dr. C. Leslie Glenn said yesterday the reason these books had attained such a high circulation was that the majority of Christians had stopped reading the Bible.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c63aba0a4d6d11eca373c3619101985c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c63aba0a4d6d11eca373c3619101985c"}},
