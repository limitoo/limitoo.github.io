The smart ones are readying themselves, finding ways to make their workplace more attractive. The rest are either oblivious or assuming this seismic rebalancing of the employer-employee relationship is just a passing fad.\", \"It was around 12 months after the pandemic really hit in the US that something started to change. In March this year, the so-called \\\"quit rate\\\" began to climb. This rate measures the number of workers voluntarily leaving a job, and by April it had hit a record high.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/715cd0dd3deff3ea75ef7209fee713c9\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> For many employees, working from home during the pandemic has been an eye-opener.(Pexels: Anna Shvets)</div>\", \"In August a new record was set, followed by another in September, with 4.4 American million workers leaving their jobs in just one month.\\u00a0\", \"There are a range of reasons behind the mass movement and exodus. For some, working from home has been an eye-opener. They want more flexibility and freedom. They're re-assessing the priority of work in their lives.\\u00a0\", \"Others have found the work from home experience utterly exhausting, as have those serving at the frontline of COVID in the healthcare sector. They've had enough. Then there are those sick of being underpaid and overworked who are now chasing a better deal.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">It's not just about more money</div>\", \"Dr Anthony Klotz from Texas A&M University, who coined the term \\\"Great Resignation\\\", says there are four trends: a backlog of resignations from those who hung onto positions they would have otherwise left during COVID, heightened levels of burnout, \\\"pandemic epiphanies\\\" leading to lifestyle change, and finally those who simply do not want to return to the office environment.\\u00a0\", \"The unemployment rate has fallen in the US, but the participation rate remains well below its pre-COVID levels. No one can be certain whether this will be a temporary blip or a permanent exodus. In the meantime, employers are scrambling to hold onto good staff and find ways to attract new workers to fill their vacancies.\\u00a0\", \"It's not just about offering more money, although that's part of it. US wages grew by 1.5 per cent in the three months to the end of September, the biggest jump in 20 years.\\u00a0\", \"It's also about offering employees greater flexibility (including the ability to work fewer hours and work from home), work they can value in their lives and a sense of purpose. The power imbalance between the boss and the worker may still exist, but the dial is shifting some.\\u00a0\", \"It's hard to believe these trends and preconditions don't exist in Australia. Indeed, \\\"job hopping\\\" is already on the rise. The Nine Newspapers this week reported a big jump in the number of people shifting employment compared to pre-COVID, based on data from LinkedIn.\\u00a0\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/933105bd6e1aff7b6c5d8120554efd56\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Many American workers have been burnt out serving at the frontline of COVID in the healthcare sector.(ABC News: Brendan Esposito)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Challenges for employers, questions for politicians\\u00a0</div>\", \"Australian workers are at least looking for change, if not an exit from the jobs market.
