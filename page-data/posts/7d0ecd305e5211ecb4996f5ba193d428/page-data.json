He's been bowling heaps, physically good to go with his strength and conditioning.\", \"\\\"He'll be really primed and ready to go for the first test.\\\"\", \"Wagner will almost certainly reunite with fellow Blackcaps seamers Trent Boult, Tim Southee and Kyle Jamieson for that opening test, with Jurgensen conceding he doesn't expect New Zealand to divert from its four-pronged pace attack.\", \"That would almost certainly condemn Patel to a role on the sidelines, despite his historic 10- wicket haul in New Zealand's loss to India at Mumbai.\", \"\\\"At this stage, pace has been the main way that games have been decided in New Zealand in test cricket,\\\" says Jurgenson. \\\"I don't see that potentially changing any time soon, but at the same time, it could.\", \"\\\"At this stage, I look forward to the summer ahead. We're very thankful to have done what we've done and been able to play overseas, thankful to the Government for supporting us.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"MIQ's been great in here for us, [but] we're really looking forward to the home summer.
