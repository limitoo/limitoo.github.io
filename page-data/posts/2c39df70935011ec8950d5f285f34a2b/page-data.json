The official winner is now the second-place horse, Mandaloun.\", \"The news comes more than two months after Medina Spirit\\u00a0collapsed and died\\u00a0following a workout at Santa Anita. His trainer Bob Baffert said the colt suffered a heart attack on December 6 but a necropsy\\u00a0released this month showed no definitive cause of death.\", \"In addition to Monday's ruling on the winner, Baffert was also suspended for 90 days and was issued a $7,500 fine.\", \"That suspension means he is \\\"denied the privileges of all facilities under the jurisdiction of the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission. Entry of all horses owned or trained by Mr. Baffert is denied pending transfer to persons acceptable to the stewards.\\\"\", \"That marks the second time in three years that the first horse to cross the Kentucky Derby finish line is not the winner. In 2019, Maximum Security was disqualified\\u00a0for impeding the path of two horses in the final turn before crossing the line first.\\u00a0\", \"Baffert is allowed to appeal the decision.\", \"Medina Spirit's Kentucky Derby\\u00a0victory last May\\u00a0came under scrutiny after he tested positive for betamethasone, a legal medication that is not allowed on race day in Kentucky.\", \"As a result,\\u00a0Baffert was suspended\\u00a0by Churchill Downs and barred from entering horses in the 2022 and 2023 Kentucky Derbies. He also was banned by the New York Racing Association from entering horses at its Belmont, Saratoga and Aqueduct tracks.\", \"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"2c39df70935011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2c39df70935011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
