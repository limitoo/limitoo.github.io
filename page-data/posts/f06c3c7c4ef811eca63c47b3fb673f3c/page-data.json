Yes, I'm sorry to say, the broadcaster's ego really is that close to the surface.\", \"I was dropping my son off while walking the dog when he stopped to say how much he enjoyed the show. He introduced himself, had a few things to say about programming on my station, told me where he worked and what he did. He was a reasonable and sensible person. It was a perfectly pleasant exchange.\", \"He told me he was going to send me his contact details on social media and said, \\\"then we can meet and have a coffee\\\".\", \"I know there was a solid beat of silence immediately after he said this. It was the total assuredness of the assumption.\", \"It wasn't a request or a polite inquiry. We were going to do this. He was a listener, he worked in an interesting field. He had things to say, and I had to hear them.\", \"I've just come out of what feels like two straight years of lockdowns. I couldn't count how many friends, family members, colleagues, contacts and generally interesting people I both owe a cup of coffee and would love to have a chat with. I've got to be blunt here: this stranger was pretty low down on the list.\", \"The Rolodex of Polite Ways to Extricate Oneself from a Tricky Situation whirled in my head. Card after card rapidly scanned and rejected. There were so many criteria to meet, and quickly: don't be rude; don't hurt his feelings; don't promise something you can't deliver \\u2014 don't lie and say you will! And above all else, don't piss off a listener.\", \"It wasn't perfect but this is what I came up with: \\\"Ah, sure \\u2026 well \\u2014 um, if I have time!\\\" (The cheery note I tried to inject may not translate here)\", \"His face set. \\\"What do you mean if you have time? You have time.\\\"\", \"Two beats of silence. Me, staring.\", \"The Rolodex of Make Nice wasn't going to help me here. In any case it wasn't needed \\u2014 he pressed on.\", \"\\\"You take an afternoon nap, don't you?\\\"\", \"OK \\u2014 we were in strange territory now, and my beloved dog \\u2014 the kind of Lab who would lick a house robber to death \\u2014 was not helping. How I needed her to issue just the mildest little growl \\u2026 \\\"step back, buddy \\u2026\\\"\", \"I took charge. I thanked him for listening and said of course he could send his work details to me and maybe I would be in touch.\", \"\\\"Or not,\\\" he bit back. He was not happy now.\", \"And, heart beating faster than I wanted it to be on a sunny midweek afternoon as I walked away, neither was I.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">It's not just me</div>\", \"No, it was not the end of the world. No, I am not attempting to cancel someone or to opine about fatal wounds from a microaggression. I know this story I am telling you here is a small thing. But you need to know that's it's a common thing. It happens more often than you think, and to a lot of women.\", \"The small things accumulate \\u2014 they become how you experience the world, and sometimes they make the world just a little more unpleasant than it needs to be.\", \"And as anyone who has experienced those ruminating thoughts after such a little encounter \\u2014 the clever one-liners that run around and around in your head afterwards \\u2014 the feeling stays. And it's not a nice one.\", \"There is a Prufrock moment that we all hope to avoid. Am I growing old, growing old? I just hate those grumpy old women TV shows that are everywhere \\u2014 I don't find them funny \\u2014 and I desperately seek to avoid becoming the crank I see so many others turn into. Am I getting grumpy and overreacting? Best to check. So I did.\", \"The young women who work in our team are remarkable: quick, smart, funny, thoughtful and with an infinite capacity for empathy and perspective well beyond their experiences. Great qualities when you take talk-back calls for a living. They challenge my view of the world daily.\", \"I ran the story past them. I wish I could do their reactions justice.\", \"The mouths agape. The shocked guffaws. The wide-eyed slow shakes of the head. It was their suggestion that I tell the story here. Why? \\\"So that some other woman who cops this will know what to say!\\\" they cried.\", \"When I told my editor I had a little incident to reflect on this week I was at pains to say it was no big #MeToo story \\u2014 but she got it: \\\"So, it's just about the uszhe (usual) then, hey?\\\"\", \"Yeah. Just the uszhe.\", \"Maybe he did have a great story to tell, and maybe I've missed it, to what may end up being great regret. But the usual aspect of this unusual story is how common this experience, in one form or another, seems to be to so many women I know \\u2014 so much so that they see universal value in having a bit of a chat about it here.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Are you this man?</div>\", \"So I am having the chat, and I'm asking any bloke who now realises that he may have \\u2014 at work, on the bar on a Friday night, or out on some random Melbourne street \\u2014 taken for granted his significance in the life of someone he's just met to pause for a moment.\", \"It's a deeply socialised instinct we have to try to make nice. But time's coming when we won't want to anymore.\", \"At this point I'm going to hand over to Grace Tame, our outgoing Australian of the Year, and this weekend you can read her most powerful speech yet on the legacy of abuse she has worked so tirelessly to expose. She is magnificent.\", \"Have a safe and happy weekend and have you seen Hamilton yet? Live theatre is back and this show, a turning point for the American musical tradition as important as West Side Story, is soon to close its Sydney run and move to Melbourne. So, get a move on.\", \"And if, like me, you had that thrilling experience at the end of the show's opening number of seeing the breathtaking talent and diversity of the Australian stage lined up before you, then Thursday's ARIA's delivered the same joy.\", \"So many diverse, brilliant young faces finally reflecting the capacity and creativity of this country. Here's breakthrough artist winner, Bundjalung rapper Budjerah \\u2014 you're going to hear a lot more from him.\", \"Virginia Trioli is presenter on Mornings on\\u00a0ABC Radio\\u00a0Melbourne and the former co-host of\\u00a0ABC\\u00a0News Breakfast.\"]","href_hash":"f06c3c7c4ef811eca63c47b3fb673f3c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f06c3c7c4ef811eca63c47b3fb673f3c"}},
