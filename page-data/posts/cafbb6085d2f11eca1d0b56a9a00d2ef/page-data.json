In 2017, her husband kidnapped her, drove her into a forest and chopped off her hands with an ax.\", \"The four women also claimed in their court filing that the Russian police did not respond to their cases in an appropriate manner.\", \"The court found that Russia was in violation of Articles 3 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights prohibiting \\\"inhuman, degrading treatment and discrimination\\\" in its handling of the four women's cases.\", \"Currently, there is little to no legal protection for people who suffer from domestic abuse in Russia. The court ruling said Russia should make \\\"urgent changes\\\" to the way it handles domestic abuse, including establishing a legal definition of domestic violence, criminalizing all domestic violence behavior and allowing the use of protective and restraining orders.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1951901/russia-domestic-violence-protest.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">With a ruling on Tuesday, December 14, a European human rights court urged Russia to tackle the \\\"staggering scale\\\" of domestic violence in the country.

As a result, it was decriminalized in 2017 and downgraded to misdemeanor status, punishable by a $68 fine.\", \"Valentina Matviyenko, the current chairwoman of the country's upper house of parliament, acknowledged in 2019 that domestic violence was a problem in Russia and aimed to have a domestic violence bill before the year's end.\", \"One was drafted by lawmakers and women's rights advocates but faced resistance from conservative groups and the Russian Orthodox Church, which argued that the state should not interfere in domestic matters. As a result, the legislation was watered down and never received a vote.\", \"In Tuesday's ruling, the European Court of Human Rights ordered Russia to pay the four women a total of over 450,000 euros ($507,000).
