The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against the Peachtree, Georgia-based auto repair shop and owner Miles Walker after deciding that the stunt amounted to retaliation.\\u00a0\", \"According to the government's\\u00a0complaint, Walker decided to pay Flaten in pennies within hours of learning that he had contacted regulators over his missing paycheck.\", \"\\\"How can you make this guy realize what a disgusting example of a human being he is...,\\\" Walker stated, the Labor Department alleged in the suit. \\\"[Y]ou know what?

The business also denied putting oil on the coins.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"There were exactly 100,003 pennies, 750 dimes, 2 quarters, a nickel, and his pay stub in the pile,\\\" the post states. \\\"That is a lot more than what we were legally obligated to give him.
