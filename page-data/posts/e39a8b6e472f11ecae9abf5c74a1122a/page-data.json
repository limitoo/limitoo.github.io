But some states aren\\u2019t waiting.\", \"Arkansas, Colorado, California and New Mexico have expanded eligibility to all adults, and the authorities in New York and West Virginia have also encouraged all adults to get the booster. New York City yesterday became one of the first major cities to tell all adults they could get another shot if they wanted one.\", \"States and cities are forging ahead as the country faces an upswing in coronavirus cases and experts warn of a possible surge this winter. The U.S. reported almost 85,000 new cases yesterday, a 14 percent increase from two weeks ago, although deaths and hospitalizations have decreased.\", \"A growing body of research has shown that vaccine effectiveness against infection wanes over time. Still, the consensus in the scientific community is that all the vaccines continue to provide strong protection against severe illness, hospitalization and death from Covid-19. Some experts have even argued that the protection is so good, the vast majority of Americans don\\u2019t need booster shots.\", \"The question of whether you should get one may invite knotty ethical questions, like one from Miriam, in New York, who recently wrote in to Kwame Anthony Appiah, the Ethicist for The New York Times Magazine.\", \"Miriam, 49, a public-school teacher, wanted to know if she should get a booster shot, even though she was on sabbatical and quite healthy. \\u201cI\\u2019m eager to protect myself, as well as those around me, but I am unsure if getting the booster would prevent someone who is needier from getting one,\\u201d she wrote.\", \"Kwame responded: \\u201cGet the booster. There is a reasonable rule in place, and under that rule, you are eligible. Given the widespread availability of the vaccine here, you won\\u2019t be depriving someone in greater need of it. And plenty of people who are less in need than you \\u2014 including young, healthy teachers in their 20s \\u2014 will be getting the booster. I can\\u2019t help adding that your letter presents a painful paradox: While some people may forgo a jab because they care so much about the larger community, others skip getting vaccinated because they don\\u2019t care enough.\\u201d\", \"More resources:\", \"The Biden administration is planning to pay more than $5 billion for a stockpile of Pfizer\\u2019s new Covid pill, enough for about 10 million courses of treatment, after the company gears up production next year, according to people familiar with the agreement.\", \"Pfizer said today that it applied to the F.D.A. to authorize the pill to treat unvaccinated people with Covid-19 who are at high risk of becoming severely ill. The drug, which will be sold under the brand name Paxlovid, could become available within weeks if authorization is granted. It is meant to be dispensed by pharmacies and taken at home.\", \"Pfizer also announced today that it had reached an agreement to allow other manufacturers to make and sell the pill inexpensively for use in 95 developing countries, mostly in Africa and Asia.\", \"In a key clinical trial, Paxlovid was found to sharply reduce the risk of hospitalization or death when given to high-risk unvaccinated volunteers soon after they started showing symptoms. It appears to be more effective than a similar offering from Merck, known as molnupiravir, that could be authorized as soon as early December.\", \"Pfizer\\u2019s drug is designed to stop the coronavirus from replicating by blocking a key enzyme that the coronavirus uses to replicate itself inside cells. Merck\\u2019s pill works differently, by inserting errors into the virus\\u2019s genetic code \\u2014 a mechanism that has raised concerns among some scientists. They worry that Merck\\u2019s drug could trigger genetic mutations that cause reproductive harm. That difference could give Pfizer\\u2019s pill an advantage.\", \"As more companies reopen offices and adjust to hybrid work \\u2014 with people both at home and in the office \\u2014 few are finding it to be a smooth transition.\", \"It seems that some companies used delays in return-to-office plans as an excuse to avoid questions about how to balance the needs of their remote and in-person employees. The result, my colleague Emma Goldberg writes, is a mushy middle ground that calls into question whether hybrid setups are sustainable, even with all the benefits they confer.\", \"Remote workers, for example, may feel undercut, and it\\u2019s not hard to imagine why. They might be muted in a heated discussion or shut out of lunchtime bonding. But in-person employees might feel just as neglected, in some cases being forced to join meetings on their laptops from the office.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s the American-in-Europe rule,\\u201d said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford professor who has surveyed hundreds of hybrid companies. \\u201cWhen an American is traveling abroad, you look around the room and everyone is speaking English for your benefit. If there\\u2019s one person working from home, everyone in the office dials into the meeting.\\u201d\", \"Last year, doctors and politicians across the country urged Americans to skip a big group meal for Thanksgiving. But this year, months after vaccines have become widely available, the guidance from officials and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is more relaxed \\u2014 and families are getting together to celebrate.\", \"As holiday traditions change \\u2014 yet again \\u2014 we\\u2019d love to hear how you and your loved ones are adjusting. We\\u2019re asking readers to tell us their Thanksgiving plans, and how they differ from last year\\u2019s.\", \"If you\\u2019d like to participate, you can tell us your story using the form here. We may feature your response in an upcoming edition of the Coronavirus Briefing newsletter.\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic.
