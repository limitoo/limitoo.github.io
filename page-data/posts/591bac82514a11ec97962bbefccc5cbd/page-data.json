Some of them, roughly 8 percent, have likely been lost forever. To win back the rest, multiplex owners must \\u201curgently\\u201d rethink pricing and customer perks in addition to focusing on coronavirus safety.\", \"Those were some of the takeaways from a new study on the state of the American movie theater business, which was troubled before the pandemic \\u2014 attendance declining, streaming services proliferating \\u2014 and has struggled to rebound from coronavirus-forced closings in 2020. Over the weekend, ticket sales in the United States and Canada stood at roughly $96 million, compared to $181 million over the same period in 2019.\", \"The study, published online on Monday, was self-commissioned by the Quorum, a film research company led by David Herrin, the former head of research for United Talent Agency; Cultique, a consultancy run by the longtime brand strategist Linda Ong; and Fanthropology, a firm that focuses on fan engagement. They intend to run the survey once a quarter.\", \"\\u201cThe research clearly shows that theaters are suffering because the pandemic intensified, accelerated, amplified all of the nascent trends that were already underway,\\u201d Ms. Ong said. \\u201cThat is the definition of a perfect storm \\u2014 not that various problems exist at the same time, but that they have an intensifying effect on each other.\\u201d\", \"The nascent trends? Rising ticket and concession prices. Decreasing \\u201cexperiential value,\\u201d including the perception that moviegoing has become a hassle. The run-down state of shopping malls, which house many theaters. A generational shift toward streaming, gaming and other smartphone-based entertainment. \\u201cBefore, maybe you went every now and again \\u2014 overlooking the drawbacks,\\u201d Mr. Herrin said. \\u201cNow you add safety concerns to that mix, and you suddenly become a former filmgoer.\\u201d\", \"The research companies surveyed 2,528 people who visited a movie theater in 2019. (Some bought a ticket once a week, while others went once a month. Others went \\u201cseveral\\u201d times a year.) About 51 percent of respondents said they had bought tickets in recent months, with some drawn by cinema-chain rewards programs. They are largely white men ages 25 to 45 who live in cities, according to Mr. Herrin. \\u201cOnce you get outside of that demographic, you\\u2019re really starting to lose people,\\u201d he said.\", \"The 49 percent no longer buying tickets were more likely to be in favor of a vaccine mandate for attendees. This group, predominantly female, was also more likely to be concerned about price and value, Mr. Herrin said. Still, he noted that roughly a third were \\u201chopeful\\u201d about returning to theaters at some point. Among the changes most likely to bring them back: lower prices for classic concessions, newer seats, policing the usage of phones during films.\", \"\\u201cThere needs to be a sense of urgency,\\u201d Mr. Herrin said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how large a window there is for exhibition to win these people back,\\u201d he added, using Hollywood jargon for the multiplex business.\", \"The \\u201clikely losts,\\u201d as the study identifies 8 percent of respondents who said they have not bought a ticket during the pandemic and can\\u2019t see themselves returning, are lower-income consumers. The group has a large proportion of Hispanic, Black and Asian women, the researchers noted.\"]","href_hash":"591bac82514a11ec97962bbefccc5cbd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"591bac82514a11ec97962bbefccc5cbd"}},
