Andrew M. Cuomo could be forced to forfeit millions of dollars that he earned from his 2020 pandemic memoir after a state ethics board on Tuesday voted to revoke its authorization for the book.\", \"The Joint Commission on Public Ethics accused Mr. Cuomo of essentially obtaining approval under false pretenses, including breaking his promise not to use state resources toward completion of the memoir.\", \"\\u201cContrary to the representations made on behalf of Governor Cuomo and not disclosed to the commission, state property, resources and personnel, including staff volunteers, were used in connection with the preparation, writing, editing and publication of the book,\\u201d according to a resolution that was approved by a 12-to-1 vote.\", \"The commission also noted several misrepresentations in Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s request for the ethics commission\\u2019s approval, including the nature of the book\\u2019s subject matter and how far along the project was at the time of the request. It also noted that the full financial details of the deal and contract had been withheld from the panel.\", \"Legal experts said that the governor would most likely have the opportunity to reapply to the board for its approval; if the board rejected Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s application, it could order him to surrender book profits or face separate penalties.\", \"In a statement, Mr. Cuomo characterized the decision as \\u201cthe height of hypocrisy\\u201d and \\u201ca political game,\\u201d reiterating that any staff who assisted with the book project did so on their own time.\", \"Punishing him for relying on the board\\u2019s approval was unfair, the statement added, saying \\u201cthe governor cannot be held responsible for internal decisions over recusals and approvals made by JCOPE.\\u201d\", \"A lawyer for Mr. Cuomo, Jim McGuire, said that he was looking \\u201cforward to vigorously contesting in court any efforts JCOPE makes to enforce this baseless and improper decision.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Cuomo had asked the state ethics panel in July 2020 for permission to write a book about his leadership during the crisis, just as New York began to slowly emerge from the brutal first wave of the pandemic. A staff member at the commission reviewed the request and issued an authorization; no vote was taken.\", \"For Mr. Cuomo, who resigned in August, the book was a way to capitalize on the national fame he earned after New York became the epicenter of the pandemic.\", \"For months, Mr. Cuomo refused to divulge how much he had been paid by his publisher, Crown, even as investigators scrutinized whether he had illegally used state resources to write and promote the book.\", \"That changed in May, when his financial disclosures became public, showing he was expected to earn more than $5 million from the book. He received $3.12 million last year and was supposed to be paid another $2 million over the next two years, state officials said at the time.\", \"His spokesman has said that Mr. Cuomo netted about $1.5 million from the payment last year, after taxes and expenses; he donated $500,000 to charity and placed the remainder in a trust for his three daughters.\", \"The state attorney general\\u2019s office is investigating Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s use of state resources for the writing and editing of his book. The New York Times and others have reported that top aides were involved with the production of the manuscript, even attending meetings with the publisher \\u2014 a possible violation of state law that forbids the use of public resources for personal gain.\", \"\\u201cI would think that if he does apply again, he\\u2019s going to have to make a showing that there won\\u2019t be a violation of the use of state resources law, which, since the book is already written, and did violate that provision, should be very hard to do,\\u201d said Evan Davis, a former counsel to Mario Cuomo and former president of the New York City Bar Association.\", \"Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s 320-page memoir has also come under fire because he began to work on it just as his most senior aides rewrote a key report from the state Health Department to obscure the true number of fatalities in nursing homes during the pandemic.\", \"Indeed, a State Assembly investigation is looking at whether there was any link between his administration\\u2019s undercounting of nursing home deaths and his attempt to use the book to burnish his image as a hero during the pandemic.\", \"The book, titled \\u201cAmerican Crisis: Leadership Lessons From the Covid-19 Pandemic,\\u201d turned into a headache for Crown earlier this year as Mr. Cuomo became engulfed in other scandals, including sexual harassment allegations that led to his resignation.\", \"It became a commercial disappointment and, in March, Crown canceled the promotion and any plans for a paperback version, raising questions about whether the publisher would pay out the governor\\u2019s full advance. At the time, Crown cited an ongoing investigation by federal prosecutors into Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s handling of nursing home data as the reason to pause \\u201cactive support\\u201d of the book.\", \"Crown did not respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.\", \"This is the third time that the commission \\u2014 which has been the subject of broad scrutiny, with Gov. Kathy Hochul saying that she\\u2019d like to \\u201cblow [it] up\\u201d and begin anew \\u2014 has attempted to rescind its prior approval of Mr. Cuomo\\u2019s request.\", \"State Senator Liz Krueger, who has been a proponent of ethics reform, cautioned that the decision Tuesday should not be read as a vindication of the board.\", \"\\u201cIn order for it to ever work, first the governor has to step down, you put the right people in place, and then you have to try three times before they get it right?\\u201d Ms. Krueger asked.\", \"\\u201cThis does nothing to convince me that JCOPE doesn\\u2019t need to be scrapped and started again.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"fa16622c472b11ecb075f778d74318da"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fa16622c472b11ecb075f778d74318da"}},
