So far, about 36% have received a booster shot, which experts say is a crucial instrument in reducing the possibility that an infection will necessitate intensive care or be fatal.  \", \"Draghi said the decision to require vaccination for older persons was taken out of concern that they are at more risk for hospitalization and \\\"to reduce the pressure on hospitals and save lives.\\\"  \", \"It was not immediately announced what, if any, penalty non-vaccinated older persons might face. But Health Minister Roberto Speranza also told reporters that anyone 50 or older will be checked to see if they have a \\\"super green pass\\\" before they enter their workplaces. That certification is reserved for those who are fully vaccinated or who have recently recovered from COVID-19.\", \"The workplace requirement for older workers in both the public and private sector takes effect February 15. That date would presumably allow time for workers to become fully vaccinated if they aren't now.\", \"The Cabinet also decreed that anyone working in universities must be vaccinated, regardless of age. Currently, vaccination is required for school teachers, health care workers, members of the military and police forces, regardless of age.\", \"Also adopted was a requirement that anyone working or obtaining services in beauty parlors and similar establishments have a negative virus test if they aren't vaccinated or haven't recently recovered from COVID-19. The same rule will apply to stores in shopping malls and to banks and post offices. Those working or patronizing pharmacies or food stores will be exempt.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"6b722fe86e7b11ec8c304d48ae0afe6e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6b722fe86e7b11ec8c304d48ae0afe6e"}},
