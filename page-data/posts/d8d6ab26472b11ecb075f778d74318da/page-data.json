Though there was a distinct possibility that the smudges could have been dirt or mold, workers with The Landmark Trust decided to reach out to Lincoln Conservation, an organization that restores historic buildings and artifacts, to take a look.\", \"Calverley Old Hall is part of The Landmark Trust organization, which is a group that aims to save historic buildings. After restoring the buildings, they are available to people to stay in for vacations. The Old Hall, in particular, is described as a \\\"solidly romantic place to stay\\\" by the group.\", \"When the team from Lincoln Conservation first came to uncover some plaster around the room, the wall paintings were revealed.\", \"\\\"We were speechless,\\\" Dr. Anna Keay, the director of The Landmark Trust, said in a release. \\\"It was clear at once that these almost certainly dated to the Tudor period.

When Keay returned at the start of the second day, she found that the team uncovered artwork on three full walls.\", \"\\\"Floor to ceiling, wall to wall, a complete, highly decorated Tudor chamber, stripped with black and red and white and ochre,\\\" Keay recalled. \\\"Mythical creatures and twining vines, classical columns and roaring griffins.\\\"\", \"She went on to say that she never experienced this type of discovery throughout her 27 years of experience working in historic buildings.\", \"These paintings are part of the \\\"Grotesque\\\" style, which Caroline Stanford, a historian with The Landmark Trust, explained comes from the Italian word grotteschi. It means \\\"from the grotto,\\\" and stems from the story of a man who fell into what he thought was a grotto and needed to be saved by friends.\", \"\\\"Exploring further by torchlight, they found they had discovered not a cave but the glittering interiors of Emperor Nero's buried Domus Aurea or Golden Villa, built in the 1st century CE,\\\" Stanford explained in a release published by The Landmark Trust.\", \"She said that prints and engravings influenced by Renaissance design made their way to England and likely inspired the unknown creator behind the wall paintings of Calverley Old Hall.\", \"As the organization continues to investigate the history behind the paintings, they are looking into how they can best conserve and display the wall paintings.\"]","href_hash":"d8d6ab26472b11ecb075f778d74318da"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d8d6ab26472b11ecb075f778d74318da"}},
