How did investigators finally find their killer?\", \"Tanya Van Cuylenborg, 18, and her boyfriend, 20-year-old Jay Cook, 20, left British Columbia and were Seattle bound in Cook's parents' van, to pick up furnace parts.\\u00a0 They had planned to spend the night in their van.\", \"Tanya Van Cuylenborg's older brother John was away at college when he got a call from his worried father. Tanya and Jay Cook had not returned home or called. Both families reported them missing.\\u00a0\", \"Tanya Van Cuylenborg's body was found in a ditch in rural Skagit County, Washington, about 80 miles from Seattle. She had been shot in the head and had no pants or underwear on. Zip ties were found near her body. Authorities believed she had been raped.\", \"The day after Tanya Van Cuylenborg's body was found, the keys to the van, Tanya's ID, ammunition matching the bullet that killed Tanya, zip ties and a disposable glove turned up underneath the porch of local tavern in Bellingham, close to the bus station.\", \"Jay Cook's parents' van was found in a parking lot in downtown Bellingham, Washington. The van contained more clues, including zip ties, and what would become the most important piece of evidence in the case\\u2014Tanya's black pants. Cook was still missing.\", \"Jay Cook's body was found in rural Snohomish County, about 70 miles away from where Tanya Van Cuylenborg was found. He had been strangled and a pack of cigarettes was stuffed down his throat. Zip ties were also found near his body.\", \"The month after the murders, an anonymous letter writer began sending menacing letters to Jay and Tanya's families. The writer claimed to be the killer but was ultimately eliminated as a suspect. \\u00a0\", \"In 1995, Snohomish County Detective Jim Scharf helped form a cold case team. The murders of Tanya Van Cuylenborg and Jay Cook was one of the team's first cases.\", \"Semen was found on Tanya Van Cuylenborg's pants that was not a match to Jay Cook. The suspect DNA was dubbed \\\"Individual A.\\\" In 2003, the Washington State Patrol uploaded Individual A's profile to CODIS, the FBI's national offender database, but there were no hits.\", \"Over the years, there would be plenty of theories and false leads. Detective Scharf said over 200 names came across his desk. Some were convicted felons. Jay Cook's body had been found near the Monroe Honor Farm, a prison, but it was another dead end.\", \"In 2015 a woman with no relationship to the victims named Chelsea Rustad uploaded her DNA to a website where users share DNA to help build family trees. Rustad's DNA would help unlock the mystery of who killed Tanya Van Cuylenborg and Jay Cook.\", \"The man responsible for numerous rapes and murders was identified after evading law enforcement for 43 years. His DNA had been uploaded to GEDmatch and investigators found him after building a family tree from people who shared enough DNA to be relatives \\u2014 a practice called genetic genealogy.\", \"Inspired by the breakthrough arrest in the Golden State Killer case, Detective Scharf wanted to utilize the same technology to try and catch Tanya Van Cuylenborg and Jay Cook's killer. Regarding the discovery of the new tool, Scharf said, \\\"This is fantastic.\\u00a0 I need to get on this.\\\"\", \"After speaking with Detective Scharf, Parabon NanoLabs agreed to upload \\\"Individual A's\\\" DNA to GEDmatch and called in genetic genealogist CeCe Moore to work on the case.\", \"CeCe Moore logged on to GEDmatch and found two people who shared enough DNA to be second cousins with Individual A. Within two hours, Moore was able to build a family tree and find a name of the person she believed was the killer of Jay Cook and Tanya Van Cuylenborg. His name: William Earl Talbott II.\\u00a0 \\u00a0\", \"To make an arrest, Det. Scharf needed to confirm that the DNA left at the crime scene matched Talbott's. Investigators tailed Talbott, a trucker, for a few days, until he dropped a cup. They rushed it to the Washington State Patrol lab that same day and eagerly awaited the results.\", \"Forensic scientist Lisa Collins matched the DNA on Talbott's cup to that of \\\"Individual A\\\" and broke the news to Scharf, who got tears in his eyes.\", \"After more than three decades searching for answers, Talbott was arrested and taken into custody. Tanya's older brother John Van Cuylenborg, pictured, was Detective Scharf's first call.\", \"William Talbott II pleaded not guilty to two counts of aggravated murder. In June 2019 his trial began in the Snohomish County Superior Court.\", \"At trial, Talbott's attorney, Rachel Forde argued that the DNA found on Tanya Van Cuylenborg's pants and body was best explained by consensual sex. \", \"Forde's co-counsel Jon Scott said, \\\"William Talbott's defense is that there is insufficient evidence to prove him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\\\"\", \"The prosecution argued that William Talbott murdered Tanya Van Cuylenborg and Jay Cook. They pointed to Talbott's DNA from Tanya's body and her pants, the fact that Talbott had lived just 7 miles from where Jay's body was found, and the zip ties that were found at all four crime scenes. Prosecutor Baldock said this proves the connection between Cook's murder, and Van Cuylenborg's, and the van.\", \"After a two-week trial, the jury found William Earl Talbott II guilty of two counts of aggravated murder. Talbott maintains his innocence and has appealed the verdict.\", \"William Earl Talbott II was sentenced to two life terms.\\u00a0 Jay and Tanya's families were in the courtroom.\\u00a0 So was Chelsea Rustad \\u2013 the only Talbott relative there. Rustad says, \\\"His dad wasn't there, his sisters weren't there. He had a family member in the audience, and I was there supporting the victims.\\\"\", \"Rustad has written a book about her connection to this case, \\\"Inherited Secrets.\\\"\", \"At William Talbott's sentencing, Jay Cook's mother Leona told the judge about her endless search for closure. \\u00a0 \\\"Some of us wanted a shirt or sweater. You could wear them.\\u00a0 You could put them to your nose and smell him. I still have that old sweater in my drawer.\\\"\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"0d7188dc4a7011eca61e93f302fdba14"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0d7188dc4a7011eca61e93f302fdba14"}},
