He has both expressed support for vaccine mandates for city employees, and, in November, also said he would revisit them.\", \"On Monday, Mr. Adams had another chance to clarify his position, after the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, announced his intention to mandate that all private employers require their staff be vaccinated by Dec. 27 \\u2014 five days before he leaves office, and Mr. Adams takes over.\", \"Mr. de Blasio on Monday expressed confidence that Mr. Adams would make similar public health decisions. Yet by day\\u2019s end, it remained unclear if Mr. Adams intended to enforce Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s edict, or defend it from potential legal challenges.\", \"The mayor-elect, who is on vacation in Ghana, intends to \\u201cevaluate this mandate and other Covid strategies when he is in office and make determinations based on science, efficacy and the advice of health professionals,\\u201d Mr. Adams\\u2019s spokesman, Evan Thies, said.\", \"So even as Mr. de Blasio won ample publicity in advance of his likely run for governor, it remained far from clear what would happen to this private-sector mandate \\u2014 or Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s pandemic policies in general \\u2014 once he leaves office.\", \"Mr. Thies declined to answer any further questions. Four members of Mr. Adams\\u2019s transition team\\u2019s health committee did not respond to requests for comment. A committee contributor, the president of the Latino Commission on AIDS, Guillermo Chac\\u00f3n, encouraged the incoming mayor to keep the mandate in place.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s always hard to balance, but as a mayor, I think you have to always think about the majority,\\u201d Mr. Chac\\u00f3n said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a very difficult and painful virus that we\\u2019re facing these days.\\u201d\", \"Over the course of the year, Mr. Adams has taken several, sometimes conflicting positions on the wisdom of vaccine mandates in the fight against the coronavirus.\", \"Two days after saying he would revisit vaccine mandates for city workers, Mr. Adams expressed unequivocal support for Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s requirement that public indoor venues like theaters and restaurants deny entry to unvaccinated adults. The rule prompted the N.B.A. to bar a star for the Brooklyn Nets, Kyrie Irving, from playing in games held in the city. (The Nets have since indefinitely barred him from practicing or playing with the team.)\", \"\\u201cNew York City\\u2019s not going to change their rule,\\u201d Mr. Adams said.\", \"Part of Mr. Adams\\u2019s calculation on whether to support a vaccine mandate for private employers may be shaped by his relationship with business leaders; Mr. Adams has been clear about his desire to run a government that is friendly to business.\", \"In September, he declared that \\u201cNew York will no longer be anti-business,\\u201d in an implicit rebuke of Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s often strained relationship with the business sector.\", \"That business sector is of two minds on this latest mandate, which Mr. de Blasio said was the first of its kind in the nation.\", \"Douglas Durst, a major landlord and developer, said he believes private employers should mandate vaccines for their employees, as he has, but not at the government\\u2019s behest.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s going to take a lot of regulation and a lot of reporting, and it\\u2019s just not necessary,\\u201d Mr. Durst said.\", \"Randy Peers, the president and chief executive of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, said the mandate would just exacerbate existing labor shortages and make it even more difficult for employers to recover from the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cSmall businesses across the board can\\u2019t find workers and now, with this requirement, around the holiday time no less, we\\u2019re going to basically force employers to let people go,\\u201d Mr. Peers said.\", \"But at least one employer took the opposite tack and encouraged Mr. Adams to continue the mandate once he takes office.\", \"Scott Rechler, the chief executive of RXR Realty, touted his own company\\u2019s successful vaccination mandate as evidence that the technique works.\", \"\\u201cThe vaccine has proven to be our biggest line of defense that allows us to safely coexist and move forward without the loss of life and livelihood,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe mandated it for our teams at all of our development sites back in September for that reason. Initially, there were some people that were against it, but they ultimately came around.\\u201d\", \"Whatever Mr. Adams\\u2019s thoughts on the matter, the timing of Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s announcement suggests that the decision will, in the end, be in Mr. Adams\\u2019s hands.\", \"\\u201cThese are decisions, I think, in the last few days of a mayoralty that really, is the responsibility of our incoming mayor,\\u201d said Max Rose, the former congressman who represented Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn and on Monday announced a comeback bid.\"]","href_hash":"6cf8a99456ef11ec8748794293c394fe"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6cf8a99456ef11ec8748794293c394fe"}},
