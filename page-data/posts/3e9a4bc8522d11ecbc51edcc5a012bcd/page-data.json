He was 70.\", \"The cause was congestive heart failure, his wife, Denise Roth, said. Since 2009, he had two strokes \\u2014 the first ended his career \\u2014 and two heart attacks and was in a long-care facility at his death.\", \"Roth was a star of the Professional Bowlers Association in the 1970s and \\u201980s and a mainstay of its P.B.A. Tour. He won 34 titles, a record eight of them in 1978; earned $1.5 million on the tour; and was named the P.B.A.\\u2019s player of the year four times. He was inducted into the association\\u2019s Hall of Fame in 1987 and in 2008 was voted its fifth greatest player.\", \"Roth brought a nearly violent approach to bowling, one that he once compared to \\u201cripping the cover off the ball.\\u201d By turning his wrist severely as he released the ball, he created great speed and spin, causing the ball to hook toward the strike pocket.\", \"\\u201cSometimes I throw rockets,\\u201d Roth told Sports Illustrated in 1978. \\u201cMy ball can even overpower lane conditions at times.\\u201d\", \"Marshall Holman, a longtime rival of Roth\\u2019s, said in a phone interview, \\u201cMark brought power and accuracy together, which made him so dynamic and arguably the best spare shooter the game has seen in the past half century.\\u201d\", \"Roth\\u2019s most famous spare \\u2014 knocking down the remaining pins with the second bowl thrown in a frame \\u2014 was during a tournament in 1980 in Alameda, Calif. He became the first bowler to convert the notoriously difficult 7-10 split \\u2014 knocking down the two pins in the opposite corners of the back row \\u2014 on national television.\", \"\\u201cHe had a little grin on his face,\\u201d said Holman, who was practicing on a lane nearby. \\u201cBut I was going nuts. It was the coolest thing I\\u2019d ever seen.\\u201d\", \"The aggressive torque of Roth\\u2019s release caused his right hand to grow callused and his thumb to bleed. At first he soaked his thumb in foot soap, but he later alleviated the problem somewhat by altering the angle of his ball\\u2019s thumb hole so that he could release the finger more easily.\", \"Mark Stephen Roth was born on April 10, 1951, in Brooklyn. His mother, Hilda (Rocker) Roth, was a legal secretary, and his father, Sidney, was a postal worker. Bowling began to dominate his early life after Rainbow Lanes was built near his home. \", \"At age 13, he was averaging 160; at 17, his average was up to 195 (he often averaged in the 210s as a professional). He also worked at the bowling alley, first as a pin boy and then as a mechanic operating the automatic pin-setting machines. He bowled for Sheepshead Bay High School\\u2019s team and traveled to other bowling centers in addition to Rainbow for doubles matches, sometimes with Johnny Petraglia, who would also be inducted into the P.B.A. Hall of Fame.\", \"\\u201cI got thrown out of lots of places,\\u201d Roth told Sports Illustrated. \\u201cThey got tired of me winning, so they said, \\u2018Get out and don\\u2019t come back.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"After graduating, he bowled in some local tournaments until he earned enough money to go on the P.B.A. Tour in 1970. But his unorthodox, self-taught style had its doubters.\", \"\\u201cBefore I went on tour, people said, \\u2018You\\u2019ll never make it. You won\\u2019t last three years,\\u2019\\u201d he told Bowlers Journal in 2018. \\u201cI was so determined to shut these people up.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe same thing happened on tour,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThey said, \\u2018You\\u2019ve got to throw it straighter,\\u2019 and do this and do that. I was determined to do it my way, and that was it.\\u201d\", \"His success came gradually. In 1970, he earned only about $1,000, and he didn\\u2019t win his first title until 1975, at the King Louie Open in Overland Park, Kan. He won three tournaments in 1976 and four more the next year. After taking eight tournament titles in 1978, he won six more in 1979.\", \"In 1984, one of his four victories, at the Greater Detroit Open, pushed his career earnings above $1 million; with that he joined Earl Anthony as the only other bowler to reach that level at the time. It was a particularly notable achievement for a sport whose prize money is modest compared with that of other sports.\", \"Roth and a partner purchased Rainbow Lanes in 1984, and he remained an owner until the mid-1990s.\", \"He won his final tournament on the P.B.A. Tour in 1995, earning a $45,000 first prize at the IOF Foresters Open in Mississauga, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto. He joined the association\\u2019s senior PBA50 circuit and won one title in 2001 and a second in 2002.\", \"\\u201cWhat Mark did seemed impossible when he did it,\\u201d Tom Clark, the P.B.A. commissioner, said in an interview, referring to Roth\\u2019s power game. \\u201cTechnology has evolved to make balls hook more and hit with more power \\u2014 doing what he did naturally.\\u201d\", \"Roth had a severe stroke in 2009 that partly paralyzed his left side; through physical therapy he was able to walk with a quad cane, bowl occasionally and give lessons at a bowling center in Liverpool, N.Y. He regularly attended the annual Mark Roth-Marshall Holman P.B.A. Doubles Championship, held in various venues.\", \"\\u201cHe should have been bowling on the senior tour the last 12 years,\\u201d Mrs. Roth said in an interview.\", \"He married Denise McKinney in 2003. A previous marriage, to Jacqueline Dente, ended in divorce.\", \"In addition to his wife, Roth is survived by a daughter, Stephanie Roth, from his first marriage; a stepdaughter, Kimberly Gorton-David; a stepson, Mark MacIntyre; three step-grandsons; and one step-granddaughter.\", \"Roth was known for being shy and quiet. But in 1978, Sports Illustrated was on hand to observe his eccentric morning hotel room ritual before he headed out to a tournament: He would shriek, pound his fists on the bed, stomp his feet, repeat the word \\u201cFirp\\u201d over and over and slam a pillow against the wall, letting its feathers fly.\", \"\\u201cI do it because it makes me feel better and it helps my bowling,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt took a while before I tried my routine on the tour. Since I started it, I\\u2019ve bowled better.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3e9a4bc8522d11ecbc51edcc5a012bcd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3e9a4bc8522d11ecbc51edcc5a012bcd"}},
