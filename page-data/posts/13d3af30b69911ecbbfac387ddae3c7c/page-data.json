I said it on Monday that he's not like a lot of us where I've been injured even at age 35 and I go play just to play.\", \"\\\"He's not going to do that. He's won so many times, and he's just not a guy to go do something mediocre. He'll compete, and he'll be ready to roll.\\\"\", \"Woods, 46, arrived at Augusta National on Monday and played the back nine in a bid to help him decide whether he would play in the year's first major this week. He played the front nine on Tuesday with good friends Couples and Thomas.\", \"The 15-times major champion said on Wednesday that not only did he intend to play this week but that he thinks he can win.\", \"Victory for Woods would make him the oldest Masters champion by three weeks over 18-times major winner Jack Nicklaus, who collected his record sixth Green Jacket in 1986.\", \"Woods staged one of the most remarkable comebacks in professional sport when, at 43, he won the Masters in 2019 after enduring years of surgery and personal problems that convinced many the best golfer of his generation was done.\", \"Woods is scheduled to begin his first round on Friday at 2.34am (NZ), which will mark his first competitive round in 508 days, in a group with South African Louis Oosthuizen and Chilean Joaquin Niemann.\", \"- Reuters \"]","href_hash":"13d3af30b69911ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"13d3af30b69911ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
