Ukranians who are in the U.S. without legal permission could also qualify.\", \"Approximately 4,000 Ukranians are facing U.S. deportation proceedings, including nearly 3,000 asylum-seekers, according to immigration court data compiled by researchers at Syracuse University.\", \"Designed for foreigners from countries plagued by war, natural calamities or other crises, TPS does not grant beneficiaries permanent U.S. status. It also only applies to people already in the U.S., not future arrivals from Ukraine, which has seen more than 1 million of its citizens flee to neighboring countries.\", \"Soon after Russia invaded Ukraine late last month, bipartisan groups of lawmakers in Congress and refugee advocates mounted a vocal advocacy campaign to pressure the Biden administration to shield Ukranians in the U.S. from deportation.\", \"\\\"Forcing Ukrainian nationals to return to Ukraine in the midst of the war would be inconsistent with America's values and our national security interest,\\\" 42 senators said in a letter to President Biden last week.\", \"The Trump administration, which argued TPS was extended longer than appropriate for a temporary program, moved to end several country designations, threatening to strip deportation protections from hundreds of thousands of immigrants in the U.S. However, its efforts were stymied by court rulings.\", \"The Biden administration, on the other hand, has shown a willingness to use its TPS authority more broadly, allowing an additional 400,000 immigrants to apply for the program, including Haitian and Venezuelan exiles who fled the political and economic crises in their home countries.\", \"Camilo Montoya-Galvez is the immigration reporter at CBS News.
