For many of us who have been in the health profession for a long time, it's probably the worst we've ever seen.\", \"\\\"There are some maternity units where they can barely roster one or two midwives on for a shift for the entire maternity service. It's pretty terrible.\", \"\\\"One of the other things that came out of the 2018 MERAS settlement with the DHBs was the midwifery accord, which has been producing some good initiatives that will support the recruitment and retention of midwives in the DHBs.\", \"\\\"But it takes four years to train a midwife so you're not going to see changes overnight.\", \"\\\"If we had been doing that work 10 years ago, we wouldn't be in the situation we are in today.\\\"\", \"She said she supported the CCDM because it provided objective data on the number of staff required on wards and units.\", \"The government has also provided funding for wraparound support for Pasifika and M\\u0101ori student midwives and more funding for a general hardship fund for students, she said.\", \"\\\"We just now need to make sure that those careers are seen as attractive options.\\\"\", \"The next report is due later this month.\"]","href_hash":"0552e6b473f111ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0552e6b473f111ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
