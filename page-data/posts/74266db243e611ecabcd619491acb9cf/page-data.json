ToddIllustrated by Christian Robinson\", \"SONG FOR JIMIThe Story of Guitar Legend Jimi HendrixWritten by Charles R. Smith Jr.Illustrated by Edel Rodriguez\", \"Writing children\\u2019s literature about our most celebrated 20th-century Black musicians is a tough needle to thread. The stories of their origins and rise to stardom are so deeply entangled with the forces of systemic racism \\u2014 Jim Crow segregation, socioeconomic inequality and the insult of everyday discrimination \\u2014 that any honest biographical profile for young readers has to walk a fine line between conveying the hardships of Black childhood and celebrating the beauty and wonder of youthful musical genius taking root (sometimes as a response to said hardships). The best in this genre strike a tone that highlights the genuine aspirations and distinctive craft of the budding artist while offering a primer on the specific historical challenges faced by a people fighting for freedom.\", \"Although drastically different books, both Traci N. Todd\\u2019s luminous \\u201cNina\\u201d (with pictures by the award-winning Christian Robinson), which explores the life and career of the civil-rights-era musician Nina Simone, and Charles R. Smith Jr.\\u2019s psychedelic love letter \\u201cSong for Jimi\\u201d (with pictures by the Cuban American illustrator Edel Rodriguez), which follows the pioneering rock \\u2019n\\u2019 roll guitar hero Jimi Hendrix, achieve this difficult balance.\", \"Both are only the second picture books to be published about their singular subjects, and both are visually rapturous productions whose illustrations add striking content to narratives that combine artistic exceptionalism apparent from a young age with complicated relationships to family, mentors, acquaintances and communities.\", \"Robinson imbues \\u201cNina\\u201d with sumptuous colors \\u2014 earthy tones for Simone\\u2019s Tryon, N.C., roots; oceanic blue for an Atlantic City nightclub. His elegantly simple figures recall the work of Ezra Jack Keats and occasionally Charles M. Schulz. Rodriguez works with a dazzling palette of intense colors to convey a mood symphony of the Seattle guitarist\\u2019s evolving experimentations with instrumentality, music genres and sounds. To read either book is to slip into the immersive universe of a Black musical prodigy turned grown performer who, from a young age, pursued sonic curiosities and passions and ended up producing art that changed the course of popular culture.\", \"Todd, however, positions \\u201cNina\\u201d as a story about the legacy of a musician who realized at the height of her career that \\u201can artist\\u2019s duty \\u2026 is to reflect the times,\\u201d a line that\\u2019s been cited by activist pop stars ever since. The book\\u2019s epigraph, quoting a remark Simone made at Morehouse College in 1969, sets the tone early: \\u201cWhen I die \\u2026 I\\u2019m gonna know that I left something for [my people] to build on. That is my reward.\\u201d It\\u2019s a heavy opener for a picture book, but it primes the reader for Simone\\u2019s pivot in the early 1960s toward writing and performing songs of the Black freedom struggle \\u2014 music that would become both her signature and a means to address the racial tyranny that framed her girlhood in the segregated South.\", \"Todd\\u2019s narration doesn\\u2019t shy from this turbulence, frankly recounting how the artist born Eunice Kathleen Waymon navigated her giftedness in such an environment, mentored and encouraged by a white English immigrant piano teacher. (\\u201cBlack folks \\u2026 smiled with pride\\u201d when they saw her, which \\u201cmade her feel warm and good.\\u201d White folks \\u201cpointed and said, \\u2018That\\u2019s Miss Mazzy\\u2019s colored girl\\u2019 which did not feel good at all.\\u201d)\", \"The well-known episode from Simone\\u2019s memoir in which a young Eunice looked on from the stage at the humiliating scene of her parents\\u2019 removal from the front row of her segregated local recital is here rendered as a moment of impactful recognition of injustice; candid rage; and brave defiance. Her refusal to play until they were permitted to return to their seats is the pointed marker in the book between her childhood and her leap to young adulthood as a striving Juilliard student pursuing her classical music dreams (and subsequently experiencing the sting of rejection from Philadelphia\\u2019s Curtis Institute due to what she maintained was a racist admissions process).\", \"Anger, pain, disappointment and confusion, in other words, are given room to breathe (though Todd steers clear of Simone\\u2019s later struggles with mental health), but these are not the only forces that shape her artistry. Simone\\u2019s precocity, which shines through in the image of a diapered toddler reaching up to touch a single key on the piano, is nurtured in intimate moments sitting on her father\\u2019s lap at the keyboard, letting him guide her as they play \\u201cgood-time jazz\\u201d together, and on Sundays when she provides the rhythmic and \\u201crolling\\u201d accompaniment to her minister mother\\u2019s sermons. Todd brings nuance to Simone\\u2019s musicianship in ways that should prove instructive to curious young readers \\u2014 from the details of Miss Mazzy\\u2019s classical pedagogy (she taught Eunice to \\u201ccurl her fingers, straighten her back, and play concertos and fugues\\u201d) to Simone\\u2019s hit cover of \\u201cI Loves You, Porgy,\\u201d a \\u201cdark and deep\\u201d rendition of the Gershwin classic that was markedly distinct from Billie Holiday\\u2019s version.\", \"The journey to merge her astonishing virtuosity and professional achievements with her bold activism is summed up by the arresting portrait of the artist seated at her baby grand and flanked by four little Black girls. A replica of a burning church peeks out from underneath the instrument\\u2019s lid. (Four young Black girls were killed in the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala.)\", \"\\u201cSong for Jimi\\u201d also leans into the triumph of its subject\\u2019s ability to cultivate a diversity of sounds reflecting a multifaceted personal history. Its lyrical title page epigram \\u2014 \\u201ca sonic tactician, / a Picasso with a pick, / painting in the blues tradition\\u201d \\u2014 highlights Smith\\u2019s focus on the intricacies and ambition of Hendrix\\u2019s musicmaking as well as the roots of his artistry. Structured as a song, the book is divided into five \\u201cverses\\u201d plus an \\u201coutro\\u201d and a provocatively titled \\u201cinterlude\\u201d that closes the story of Hendrix\\u2019s life on a Monterey Pop Festival high note rather than with the tragedy of his early death (the narrative makes no mention of the artist\\u2019s substance abuse). Each of these rhyming verse poems is infused, as the author\\u2019s note indicates, with a musical style central to Hendrix\\u2019s repertoire \\u2014 from blues and early R&B to the psychedelic rock he would revolutionize. As in \\u201cNina,\\u201d there\\u2019s an abiding sense of outsiderism and individualism.\", \"The child who went by the name of James (Jimmy) Marshall found relief from poverty and his parents\\u2019 domestic conflicts in drawing, in the spirit of his Indigenous grandmother, in the rock \\u2019n\\u2019 roll sounds on the radio and in the limitlessness of his own imagination. Rodriguez translates this energy into a rich array of blues, purples, yellows and reds that saturate the page and allow Hendrix to appear across the arc of his life in multiple shades and colors. The whimsical bends and sensual curves in some of Rodriguez\\u2019s figures suggest a combination of the work of the Mexican artist Miguel Covarrubias (a figure of the Harlem Renaissance) and that of the theatrical caricaturist Al Hirschfeld.\", \"Though steeped in Black musical traditions nurtured, in part, while performing on the Chitlin\\u2019 Circuit, Hendrix is likened to \\u201ca musical sponge\\u201d who drew from everything around him in order to create \\u201ca new sound \\u2026 an odd sound \\u2026 a rock-folk rhythm-and-blues sound.\\u201d From his tour of duty in the U.S. military, to his time playing down south in Nashville and up north in the Village, to his explosive arrival in Britain, \\u201cSong for Jimi\\u201d emphasizes Hendrix\\u2019s commitment to self-invention, his eccentricity and his penchant for fantastical tropes and proto-Afrofuturist sounds that \\u201cscreeched past the stars, / echoed off the moon, / and earthquaked planet Mars.\\u201d\", \"Smith\\u2019s book includes a timeline of pivotal events in the musician\\u2019s life, a playlist of songs that inspired the author, a discography and references. But absent from the bibilography are works that reflect newer conversations about Hendrix that focus in greater detail on his return to performing with fellow Black musicians, like Billy Cox and Buddy Miles on the \\u201cBand of Gypsys\\u201d live album, shortly before his death \\u2014 a circling back to community not unlike Simone\\u2019s. That story is one that deserves its own picture book treatment.\"]","href_hash":"74266db243e611ecabcd619491acb9cf"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"74266db243e611ecabcd619491acb9cf"}},
