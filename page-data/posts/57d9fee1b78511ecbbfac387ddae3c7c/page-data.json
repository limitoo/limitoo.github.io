Among other things, the company accused the Amazon Labor Union,\\u00a0a group of former and current employees\\u00a0who spearheaded the union drive, of threatening warehouse workers to vote in favor of the organizing effort. Eric Milner, an attorney representing the ALU, said the claims were \\\"patently absurd.\\\"\", \"\\\"The employees have spoken and their voices have been heard,\\\" Milner said in a statement. \\\"Amazon is choosing to ignore that, and instead engage in stalling tactics to avoid the inevitable \\u2014 coming to the bargaining table and negotiating for a contract\\\" on behalf of the warehouse workers on Staten Island.\", \"Warehouse workers on Staten Island cast 2,654 votes \\u2014 or about 55% \\u2014 in favor of a union, giving the fledgling group enough support to pull off a victory Friday. Federal labor officials had said the results of the count won't be verified until they process any objections \\u2014 due by April 8 \\u2014 that both parties may file. Amazon requested a two-week extension, which the labor board has granted. It now has until April 22 to back up its claims.\"]","href_hash":"57d9fee1b78511ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"57d9fee1b78511ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
