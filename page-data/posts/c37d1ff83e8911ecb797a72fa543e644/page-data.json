parliamentary privilege to question alleged conflicts of interest within the very industry that lobbied for the changes.\", \"Mr Mander cited data, compiled by the Fire Protection Association of Australia (FPA Australia), that showed approximately 400 small businesses were beholden to the licensing change, and had to employ\\u00a0licensed plumbers and carpenters and take on nominees for their businesses, in order to stay afloat.\", \"The license change means a young apprentice Mr Carlsen took on three years ago will be senior to him, and the one signing off on Mr Carlsen's work.\",

Construction Council's subcommittee that recommended the licensing changes for the fire industry.\", \"He said that while the stated reason for the licensing change was improving fire safety, he did not believe the changes would lead to a safer industry.\", \"He argued that because so many small businesses were not given enough time to gain the new skills there would be fewer people doing the

appropriateness of the involvement of the only fire protection company to be represented on the subcommittee \\u2013 FVS Services Group.\", \"The company's CEO Andrew Hickman is also a board member of the QBCC and the current president of National Fire Industry Association (NFIA) \\u2014\\u00a0the main group that lobbied for the changes.\", \"Neither the QBCC, NFIA, FVS Services Group or Mr de Brenni answered questions from the ABC on whether Mr Hickman had declared a conflict of interest.\", \"In a statement, Mr de Brenni said: \\\"I have been assured [QBCC] Board members have managed any perceived conflicts in line with community expectations.\\\"\", \"Mr Mander said that following his questions to Mr de Brenni in parliament, he was contacted by dozens of small business owners who were affected by the license change.\", \"\\\"The changes that the Minister has introduced, will not improve fire safety one iota. But it does put hundreds of businesses and thousands of employees at risk of being out of business.\", \"\\\"These people are very reasonable in saying that we're happy to do that, to gain those certificates, but allow us to trade for that period of time that it takes us to upgrade our qualifications, because they'll go broke in that time and they need to earn income.\\\"\", \"The NFIA told the ABC in a statement it believed the license changes were fair and reasonable, and would make the industry safer.\", \"\\\"Due to the need for existing practitioners to upskill as a result of the new regulations, there has been a certain amount of opposition from a minority of contractors to the reforms,\\\" the NFIA said.\", \"\\\"We understand that needing to demonstrate competency by having to obtain a qualification for the work that someone believes they can already do does not sit well with some people,\\\" it said.\", \"The explanatory notes to the legislation that prescribed the change into law stated that consultation had been limited because\\u00a0\\\"it is reasonably clear there will be no significant adverse impacts.\\\"\", \"Mr Mander called for an inquiry into the licensing regime, which was rejected by the government.\"]","href_hash":"c37d1ff83e8911ecb797a72fa543e644"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c37d1ff83e8911ecb797a72fa543e644"}},
