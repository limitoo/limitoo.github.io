That is work that cannot wait, such as on people who have been in a car crash or have become sick suddenly and cannot wait.\", \"The DHB said nursing shortages were a factor in the decision but it \\\"would not be accurate to directly attribute planned care changes to the ... shortage.\\\"\", \"The director of provider services, Mike Shepherd, said with a large number of Covid-19 cases in the community, it was not unexpected to see an increasing number of the hospital's staff off work because of the virus.\", \"The decision had been a long time in the planning and there were daily meetings to discuss how to manage Covid-19 across the Auckland region, Dr Shepherd said.\", \"He urged patients to still come to their appointments unless they were contacted by the DHB to rearrange, saying the most urgent cases would be prioritised.\", \"\\\"We acknowledge and apologise for the disruption and uncertainty this may cause our patients and wh\\u0101nau and thank them for their support and understanding whilst we respond to the on-going Covid-19 outbreak,\\\" Dr Shepherd said.\", \"Planned surgeries, which used to be known as elective surgeries, were regularly delayed or cut through the Covid-19 lockdowns.\", \"Hospitals and health authorities previously said that was how they would cope if hospitals had too many Covid-19 cases to carry out their normal work in this Omicron outbreak.\", \"There were 47 people with Covid-19 in Auckland City Hospital yesterday.\", \"The two hospitals catered for eastern and central Auckland. Greenlane was much smaller and mainly used for outpatient services, and day or short-stay surgeries.\", \"Health Minister Andrew Little said nursing shortages are hampering the sector's response to Covid-19, as surgeries are delayed in Auckland.\", \"A report he saw last week identified 1600 nursing vacancies across 14 DHBs.\", \"However, 1700 graduate nurses have either joined the workforce or are about to this year.\", \"He said a number of hospital staff have had to isolate after being deemed a close contact of a confirmed case, stretching the workforce further.\", \"Little told Morning Report rapid antigen tests are being used to get asymptomatic nurses back to work sooner than they would otherwise.\", \"Of the total number of active cases in Aotearoa currently, around 11,400 are in Auckland, with about 100 people in hospital.\", \"\\\"Even with a large outbreak of Omicron, the numbers going to hospital are reasonably small, but the numbers ... of infected people will get much bigger.\", \"\\\"Therefore, the numbers going to hospital will be much bigger.\", \"\\\"So we do have to make sure there is room in our hospital network for those who are worst infected.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"929b38f4936411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"929b38f4936411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
