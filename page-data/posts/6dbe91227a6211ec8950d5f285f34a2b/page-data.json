It's illegal\\u00a0to possess venomous snakes in Maryland.\", \"\\\"I do want to assure the community, [and] anybody living in this neighborhood, we have not seen that any of the snakes were not properly secured or could have escaped,\\\" she told WUSA. \\\"I know people were worried that there could be some danger to people living nearby, but at this point, we have not uncovered or determined that any of the snakes actually were not secured after this gentleman's death.\\\"\", \"Harris also said this was the biggest collection of snakes the county's animal control chief, Ed Tucker, had ever encountered in his more than 30 years of experience.\", \"Animal control called for assistance from other reptile experts in Virginia and North Carolina and they were continuing to bag snakes on Thursday. They said the largest snake found in the house was a 14-foot Burmese python.\", \"Charles County Sheriff's detectives are conducting an investigation into the man's death. There were no obvious signs of foul play, and the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner in Baltimore will conduct an autopsy, the sheriff's department said.\", \"Stephen Smith is a senior editor for CBSNews.com\"]","href_hash":"6dbe91227a6211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6dbe91227a6211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
