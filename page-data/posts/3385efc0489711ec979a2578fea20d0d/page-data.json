The department adopted Loki to replace its current K9, Niko, who is retiring at the end of the year.\", \"\\\"Loki for us was completely free. We obtained him at no cost, fortunately. The former agency, they weren't out of anything because they were able to basically complete a warranty. They were able to get a replacement dog at no cost as well,\\\" K9 handler Officer Lance Wipf told Fox 4.\", \"Loki will be partnered with Wipf, who is an experienced handler.\", \"Despite being set to have his kidney removed, Loki is still healthy enough to work, said vets, and will be able to continue even after he has healed from the surgery.\", \"Loki is trained to detect drugs including heroin, methamphetamines and cocaine, while he's also able to sniff out and apprehend people. He will be pinned at the city council meeting today, November 18.\", \"\\\"He is always ready to work. He's always bouncing around. He wants to get out. He wants to find something to get his reward, to get his toy and play,\\\" said Wipf.\", \"\\\"Knowing that he was given another opportunity and is getting to do what he was bred and trained to do is extremely rewarding, even though we haven't done a lot of work on the street yet.\", \"\\\"Just the fact that he is able to continue on and live a good life, regardless of whether that's in police work or just being a dog, there is no better feeling.\\\"\", \"Earlier this month, Denver Police Department in Colorado swore in its first ever therapy dog. Shelby was supposed to be a guide dog, but excitement around anyone and anything meant it just didn't work out.\", \"Now, Shelby will help officers be more approachable as she joins downtown Denver's community resource officer, Teresa Gillian, on trips to visit school kids and elderly citizens.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935508/police-dog-officer.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Stock image of a police dog.</div>\"]","href_hash":"3385efc0489711ec979a2578fea20d0d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3385efc0489711ec979a2578fea20d0d"}},
