Walsh, had the backing of the city\\u2019s traditional power centers, like its police, its trade unions and its working-class Irish American neighborhoods.\", \"\\u201cFrom every corner of our city, Boston has spoken,\\u201d Ms. Wu said, to a jubilant crowd in the city\\u2019s South End. \\u201cWe are ready to meet the moment.

Ms. Wu will also be the first mayor of Boston not born in the city since 1925.\", \"Boston has been booming, as jobs in technology, medicine and education attract waves of young professionals.
