Thursday.\", \"One of the new cases \\u2014\\u00a0a 30-year-old female resident of Robinson River \\u2014 is believed to be the first case of COVID-19 in a Northern Territory remote community, which

seven other people, but he also\\u00a0spends time in the\\u00a0Robinson River\\u00a0community.\\u00a0\", \"The man initially tested negative to\\u00a0COVID-19 on\\u00a0November 9, but was re-tested on November 13 and returned a positive result yesterday.\", \"Health authorities say\\u00a0he may have been infectious since November 10.\\u00a0\", \"The other new case is a\\u00a030-year-old Aboriginal woman who is unvaccinated.\", \"She is a Robinson River resident and flew into the community on November 11.\\u00a0\", \"The woman came forward for testing after showing symptoms, and tested positive yesterday.\\u00a0\", \"It's likely she has been\\u00a0infectious in the Robinson River community since November 11.\", \"She is expected to be flown to Darwin for treatment.\", \"<div

linked to the recent Darwin/ Katherine cluster, there is a \\\"small possibility\\\" they are unconnected and there has been seeding in Katherine.\", \"That's because there isn't yet any clear link between the first case detected yesterday \\u2014\\u00a0the 43-year-old man \\u2014\\u00a0and previous cases that were part of the cluster.\", \"Authorities are also unsure if they're related because of the length of time that's passed between last week's cases\\u00a0and these ones, as the early cases\\u00a0were not out in the community after November 4.\", \"Because of this, they can't yet say whether the COVID viral fragments recently detected in Katherine wastewater samples came from the\\u00a0new cases.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What's happening in Katherine?</div>\", \"The Greater

about\\u00a0Borroloola?</div>\", \"Borroloola, a large\\u00a0remote community near Robinson River, is not currently in lockdown nor under any restrictions.\", \"Acting Chief Health Officer Charles
