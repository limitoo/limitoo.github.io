A video that captured part of the incident was posted on Instagram later that evening, and has amassed more than 100,000 views online.\", \"It begins with the man, who identified himself as Troy Lee Billups, telling Officer Christopher Lange: \\\"Don't put your hands on me!\\\"\", \"Lange, who is white, is seen grabbing Billups by the collar and shoving him face down into a nearby counter.\", \"\\\"What are you doing? You're supposed to de-escalate! How the f**k is this de-escalating?\\\" the person filming the video can be heard saying.\", \"Lange then throws Billups to the ground and the pair struggle for more than a minute as the man repeatedly tells the officer not to touch him.\", \"At one point, the officer tells a bystander that Billups is being arrested \\\"because he's obstructing.\\\"\", \"\\\"No, you escalated this situation!\\\" The person filming says. \\\"You escalated this situation and you made this happen.
