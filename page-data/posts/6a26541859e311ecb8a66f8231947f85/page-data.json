There's just so much to do as the holidays approach. Lean on standbys! Order takeout! You\\u2019re busy.\", \"And yet \\u2014 this is surely a procrastination technique \\u2014\\u00a0I\\u2019m in full cooking mode, trying recipes I\\u2019ve never made a few nights a week, feeling jazzed about the new ones on New York Times Cooking when I see their photos in our staff meetings. A few of my recent favorites are below. \", \"One more thing: We\\u2019ve just released our collection of the 50 most popular new recipes of 2021. I think you will like No. 1. Almost everyone likes No. 1. (Unless you are vegan \\u2014\\u00a0in which case, let me direct you to No. 5.) As always, write to me to tell me what you think and what recipes you need. I\\u2019m dearemily@nytimes.com.\", \"I love all Parms, but they\\u2019re usually not fast to make. (Chicken Parmesan, for instance, requires breading and pan-frying before assembling the dish.) That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m particularly excited about this new recipe from Hetty McKinnon \\u2014 a streamlined, vegetarian approach that\\u2019s easy to make and can be done in about 30 minutes. \", \"View this recipe.\", \"Sometimes I just want a simple, savory, one-pot chicken dinner, a package deal with a green vegetable, a starch and a touch of lemon. This delicious recipe from Aaron Hutcherson is exactly that. Orzo is great for soaking up flavor in the pan. \", \"View this recipe.\", \"I reveled in this clever recipe by Kay Chun, which was inspired by chirashi. Instead of making sushi rice and then seasoning it, she cooks the rice in the vinegar, and steams the salmon directly on top. And then there\\u2019s the scallion-ginger dressing and crunchy veg she serves it with. It\\u2019s so incredibly good. \", \"View this recipe.\", \"At some point this year, I got really into bacon\\u00a0as an ingredient in pasta dishes. It\\u2019s a miraculous one. A little goes a long way, and the fat in the pan brings that irresistible smoky flavor and richness to the simplest of sauces, as demonstrated in this Lidey Heuck recipe. This is peak winter pasta. \", \"View this recipe.\", \"I loved this recipe from Priya Krishna and her mom, Ritu Krishna, and it\\u2019s a very good way to cook squash on the stove, rather than in the oven. It\\u2019s typically served with puri, a fried bread, but lacking that I followed Priya\\u2019s suggestion to eat it with flour tortillas. \", \"View this recipe.\", \"Thanks for reading and cooking.
