Earlier this year, as part of the change, Netflix\\u2019s co-chief executive, Reed Hastings, endorsed a new metric by the research firm Nielsen to compare how much people are streaming versus, say, watching cable television.\", \"In the nearly three years that it has been releasing some data, Netflix offered up some viewership data four times a year, around the time of its quarterly earnings, with occasional off-schedule data dumps for unexpected hits.\", \"The new site will be updated 52 weeks a year.
