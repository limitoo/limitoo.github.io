That means no kissing the bride, photos with masks on, masks on for the first dance, masked up celebrants, and masks on when you stand to cut the cake.\\\"\", \"National's COVID-19 spokesperson Chris Bishop followed up with a statement of his own, claiming that \\\"brides will be walking down the aisle wearing a mask this summer because of the Government's nonsensical mask rules that kick in on February 4\\\".\\u00a0\", \"But a spokesperson from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet told Newshub that won't be the case because the rules don't apply to \\\"gatherings where you have the exclusive use of the venue, including weddings, at private gatherings\\\".\\u00a0\", \"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern even said it during her opening remarks on Tuesday when she announced enhanced mask rules aimed at slowing down the spread of Omicron in the community.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"These changes won't apply to non-public facing workplaces, swimming pools, and gatherings where you have the exclusive use of a premises.\\\"\", \"The entire country was shifted into the 'red' traffic light setting last Sunday after officials were unable to determine how a family in the Nelson region had contracted the new COVID-19 variant Omicron.\\u00a0\", \"The red rules mean all gatherings are capped at 100 vaccinated people, hospitality guests must be seated and separated, and in the first phase COVID-19 cases must be isolated for 14 days while household contacts must be isolated for a further 10.\\u00a0\", \"The new mask rules will come into effect next Friday.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Masks must now be worn at food and drink businesses, close proximity businesses, events and gatherings. The existing exception of when you are eating, drinking and exercising still apply,\\\" Ardern said on Tuesday.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"These changes also won't apply to non-public facing workplaces, swimming pools, and gatherings where you have the exclusive use of a premises.\", \"\\\"We really do encourage all workplaces to think, though, about mask use policies that protect your workforce. And I know many businesses are already doing so.\\\"\", \"And it has to be an actual mask.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We're also now requiring that a face covering be an actual mask - that means no more scarves, bandannas, or t-shirts pulled up over the face, for example. This is to ensure that it is a mask designed to cover your nose and mouth properly,\\\" Ardern said.\\u00a0\", \"All workers who are legally mandated to be vaccinated must now also wear a medical grade mask while working in public facing roles. These include the widely available 'blue' medical-grade masks that many are already wearing.\", \"And all primary and secondary school students Year 4 and up now also need to wear a mask on Ministry of Education funded school transport services and public transport.\", \"\\\"I know that some of these adjustments might cause challenges but the science has been updated, and these adjustments will slow the spread of the virus, save lives, and give us time to get more of the eligible population boosted,\\\" Ardern said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We have looked at a lot of overseas data on who is most successfully managing Omicron. Masks play a significant role, when done right. We have made a major shift in New Zealand by adopting their widespread use, now we just need to tighten them up slightly so we get the best out of this measure.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"3caa8f9a7fd611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3caa8f9a7fd611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
