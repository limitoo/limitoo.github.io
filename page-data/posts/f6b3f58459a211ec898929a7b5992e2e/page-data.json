He is also a respected watch collector, with frequent appearances in the country\\u2019s watch-related media and at events organized by Tokyo\\u2019s tight-knit watch community, and has an Instagram account featuring the timepieces he wears each day.\", \"Mr. Kawamura, 51, made his debut with the band when it formed in 1986 in Kanagawa prefecture, just south of Tokyo. It started out as visual kei \\u2014 Japan\\u2019s answer to glam rock, with flamboyant costumes and hairstyles \\u2014 but toned things down in the 1990s and now has turned to an edgy rock style, with the occasional animal print.\", \"Like the band\\u2019s musical style, Mr. Kawamura\\u2019s taste in watches has evolved, too. \\u201cI enjoy all kinds of watches; there are no boundaries,\\u201d he said in a recent interview at Chrono Theory, a Tokyo boutique that features independent watchmakers.\", \"\\u201cAt the beginning I focused on just a small part, just the best and most expensive ones,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cBut gradually, I got interested in the things that could become the best. It\\u2019s like Cinderella turning into a princess in the end; it\\u2019s the things on the trajectory to become the best that I\\u2019m more interested in now.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Kawamura said he had become attracted to watches that could cost as little as 5,000 or 10,000 yen, the equivalent of $44 to $89. \\u201cRecently I bought a Citizen Solar watch,\\u201dhe said. \\u201cIt was only \\u00a55,000, but it\\u2019s such an interesting watch with a good design. It\\u2019s not only about the price.\\u201d\", \"For high-end purchases, Mr. Kawamura often shops at the Hour Glass, a boutique in the Ginza district of Tokyo.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s a superstar here,\\u201d Atsushi Momoi, the store\\u2019s managing director, said, referring to both the singer\\u2019s public profile and his status in the store. \\u201cMr. Kawamura has been a customer here since 2002, when the boutique was first established in Tokyo.\\u201d At the time, Mr. Momoi managed Mr. Kawamura\\u2019s purchases, including a Patek Philippe Minute Repeater, which was difficult for Japanese to obtain then.\", \"\\u201cOver the past 20 years, his passion for watches has only increased,\\u201d Mr. Momoi said. \\u201cBut recently, his taste got wider; he opened his eyes wider.\\u201d\", \"In September, to celebrate its 25th anniversary of doing business in Japan, the boutique released the Ulysse Nardin Classico The Hour Glass Ginza 25th Anniversary edition in a 25-piece limited edition. The timepiece is equipped with a 22-karat gold rotor on the back and a salmon-pink dial finished with a radial guilloch\\u00e9 for a 3-D effect, and with Breguet hands and numerals. Mr. Kawamura purchased one, but had the original crocodile leather band changed to a silver metal bracelet.\", \"Mr. Kawamura began collecting watches about 25 years ago, when he received a 1940s Breitling Navitimer Chronomat Venus from one of his mentors, Hideki Saijo (known for his Japanese rendition of the Village People\\u2019s \\u201cY.M.C.A.\\u201d).\", \"\\u201cThat was the start. That\\u2019s when I began collecting watches,\\u201d the singer said. \\u201cBack then, people around me used to always tell me, \\u2018You need to own one good watch in your life.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"His collection has expanded to more than just one good watch, although he will not reveal how many he has now. (\\u201cI always say that I only keep eight watches total,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf the number is too high, people might say, \\u2018Why do you need so many watches? What do you use them for?\\u2019\\u201d)\", \"Mr. Kawamura brought 11 timepieces to the interview \\u2014 and said he could not name a favorite from the selection, which included a rare platinum A. Lange & S\\u00f6hne Cabaret acquired on a visit to the factory in Dresden, Germany; an Audemars Piguet Royal Oak Jumbo Extra-Thin in pink gold; a Patek Philippe Nautilus Ref. 5711 in rose gold; a platinum Patek Philippe Ref. 5140 Perpetual Calendar and a limited-edition Maurice Lacroix x Label Noir.\", \"\\u201cUsually, people only need one watch to wear, but after I got one, I started thinking about getting more because I want to be able to choose according to my lifestyle,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why I can\\u2019t choose just one.\\u201d\", \"His most treasured pieces include some customized Patek Philippes, such as the Grand Complications Ref. 5160 Perpetual Calendar with Moon Phase. \\u201cOnly the white dial was available, but I asked Patek Philippe to customize it to a black dial,\\u201d he said. The white gold case was engraved by hand with an intricate floral pattern, and the hunter case back opens to reveal the movement. (Again, he customized the strap, changing it to a dark purple leather Jean Rousseau model with a contrasting silver stitch.)\", \"When Mr. Kawamura wears a suit, he sometimes accessorizes it with his Vacheron Constantin Patrimony Skeleton, which he bought in the 1990s. \\u201cWhen I first entered the store, I saw it and loved it immediately,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou can see the movement very clearly.\\u201d He outfitted the watch with a Jean Rousseau gray leather strap lined in red. \\u201cYou can see the red peek out when I wear it. It has a playfulness to it,\\u201d he said.\", \"Recently, Mr. Kawamura actually designed a watch: a Quai des Bergues Verse o\\u2019Clock model by the Geneva-based brand Czapek, a project orchestrated by a fellow collector known only as Chrono Peace for sale at Chrono Theoryin Tokyo.\", \"The 10-piece limited-edition watch (\\u00a52.8 million) was engraved with Mr. Kawamura\\u2019s name on the case back and featured fleur-de-lis white-gold hands and a terra cotta dial. \\u201cThis was the first time I designed a watch, so I was really nervous,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut the result is very good.\\u201d\", \"Xavier de Roquemaurel, chief executive of Czapek, said in an email: \\u201cThis timepiece illustrates Czapek\\u2019s art of creating unique bespoke watches. We deeply listened to Ryuichi\\u2019s ideas and strived to create a watch that represented his very personal style and music.\\u201d\", \"Currently, Mr. Kawamura is on tour in Japan with Luna Sea, which disbanded in 2000 but reunited 10 years later. As he is performing regularly, he said he found the Formex Essence Leggera automatic chronometer, with a case made of carbon fiber and ceramic bezel and crown, fits his needs. \\u201cIt\\u2019s extra light, especially for a mechanical watch; it weighs only 50 grams,\\u201d or almost 1.8 ounces, he said, displaying the model outfitted with a fabric strap.\", \"As for future projects, Mr. Kawamura said he was in no hurry to decide. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about the same as watches: If you take your time and spend a lot of time crafting a watch, you can make a great watch. My music career as well.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f6b3f58459a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f6b3f58459a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}},
