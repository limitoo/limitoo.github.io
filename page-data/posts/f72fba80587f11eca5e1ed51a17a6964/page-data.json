The trial that formed the basis of the therapy's authorization found that it was 83 percent effective in preventing infections among mostly high-risk participants.\", \"Conditions that can lead to inadequate immune response from vaccination include cancer, HIV infections and other diseases that compromise the immune system, being an organ or stem cell transfer recipient and being treated with high-dose corticosteroids. The number of people who would qualify for Evusheld based on severe reactions to COVID-19 vaccines is likely to be far fewer since such reactions have been exceedingly rare, despite anti-vaccine activists sharing contradictory memes based on misinterpreted data.\", \"The FDA stressed that \\\"Evusheld is not a substitute for vaccination in individuals for whom COVID-19 vaccination is recommended,\\\" urging those who are able to be vaccinated to do so as soon as possible. Data recently analyzed amid the emergence of the Omicron variant have indicated that existing vaccines continue to offer protection, although booster shots have been recommended in those who were vaccinated over six months ago.\", \"A separate trial of Evusheld found that the therapy was 88 percent effective as a treatment preventing severe illness or death when given within three days of the onset of COVID-19 symptoms. However, the FDA only authorized the therapy for preventative use in the immunocompromised on Wednesday. An additional trial to test Evusheld as a treatment for hospitalized patients is ongoing.\"]","href_hash":"f72fba80587f11eca5e1ed51a17a6964"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f72fba80587f11eca5e1ed51a17a6964"}},
