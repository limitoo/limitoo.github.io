They have been locked out of their country, many of them have been unable to return, and I want to pay tribute to them for their fortitude and the enormous bravery that many of them have shown at this time of very difficult circumstances.

I can only speak for myself in that regard, but, yes, it's been a very tiring year and I am tired and I am looking forward to some time off. Chris Bishop talked about the extraordinary powers that the Government has. Yes, we do have extraordinary powers and I am the person who has to sign those. That is one of the reasons why I'm tired, because I take that responsibility very, very seriously. If you think that someone in this role should not be tired at the end of the year that we have had, then \\u2026that's not the sort of person that you would want in the job, because I do think a lot at night about the people who are separated by the border restrictions, about the people in Auckland whose businesses have been going to the wall.
