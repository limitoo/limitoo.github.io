Wade.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-01T11:23:45.000Z","content":"[\"Washington \\u2014 The future of abortion rights will face its most consequential test in nearly 30 years when the Supreme Court convenes Wednesday to hear a high-stakes showdown that takes aim at nearly five decades of precedent.\", \"At the heart of the dispute before the high court, now with a 6-3 conservative majority, is a\\u00a0Mississippi law\\u00a0that bans abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. State officials have used the case, known as Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, as a vehicle to ask the justices to overturn Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to an abortion. Pro-abortion rights advocates warn a decision upholding the 2018 law would pave the way for states to ban the procedure entirely.\", \"\\\"There is no middle ground in Dobbs,\\\" said Sherif Girgis, a professor at University of Notre Dame Law School who clerked for Justice Samuel Alito. \\\"It's very hard for me to see how the court could uphold the 15-week law without entirely eliminating the constitutional entitlement to elective abortion in Roe and Casey.\\\"\", \"Under the Supreme Court's decision in Roe, and reaffirmed in the 1992 case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, states cannot ban abortions before viability \\u2014 the point at which the fetus can survive outside of the womb, which is now considered to be between 22 and 24 weeks of pregnancy.\\u00a0\", \"But Mississippi's measure outlaws abortions at 15 weeks, before fetal viability, and a key question before the justices in Wednesday's case is whether to discard the viability line drawn in 1973.\", \"\\\"Many are expecting that Dobbs will either be the moment that the Supreme Court overrules Roe or at least will set us on a path to doing so,\\\" said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at Florida State University who has studied the legal history of Roe. \\\"One of the questions that many of us are going to be interested in is whether it's possible to sever viability from Roe and Casey and have anything left.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Mississippi\\u00a0passed its law,\\u00a0the Gestational Age Act, in 2018. But a federal district court swiftly blocked enforcement of the ban after Jackson Women's Health Organization, the state's sole abortion clinic, challenged its constitutionality. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court's ruling, and Mississippi officials\\u00a0asked the Supreme Court\\u00a0to step in last year.\", \"The Supreme Court's decision to hear the Mississippi abortion case marks a watershed in a decades-long push by anti-abortion advocates to overturn Roe. Those efforts were buoyed by former President Donald Trump's reshaping of the high court through his appointments of Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett, which expanded its conservative majority to 6-3. Mr. Trump\\u00a0pledged to name\\u00a0\\\"pro-life justices\\\" who would overrule the Supreme Court's abortion decisions.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We may well be on the verge of era when the Supreme Court sends Roe v. Wade to the ash heap of history where it belongs,\\\" former Vice President Mike Pence said at an event Tuesday, during which he also called on the high court to \\\"make history.\\\"\", \"While the Supreme Court could uphold the Mississippi law without scraping Roe and Casey, lawyers for Jackson Women's Health Organization warn such a decision would still amount to overturning its landmark abortion rulings by abandoning the viability line, effectively inviting states to ban abortions outright.\", \"A dozen states including Mississippi have already passed so-called\\u00a0\\\"trigger bans,\\\"\\u00a0in which most abortions would be outlawed if and when the Supreme Court overturns Roe. The Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research organization, estimates that if Roe is overturned or weakened, at least 21 states are poised to attempt to ban abortion.\", \"\\\"A decision upholding this ban is tantamount to overruling Roe,\\\" said Julie Rikelman, a lawyer for the Center for Reproductive Rights who will argue against the ban Wednesday, noting the Mississippi law prohibits abortion about two months before viability. \\\"There's just no way that is constitutional under the right recognized in Casey and Roe.\\\"\", \"Mississippi officials, however,\\u00a0told the Supreme Court\\u00a0that Roe and Casey are \\\"unprincipled decisions that have damaged the democratic process, poisoned our national discourse, plagued the law \\u2014 and, in doing so, harmed this court.\\\"\", \"\\\"Roe and Casey are egregiously wrong,\\\" state officials told the high court in a brief. \\\"The conclusion that abortion is a constitutional right has no basis in text, structure, history, or tradition.\\\"\", \"A decision from the Supreme Court is expected by summer 2022.\", \"Adam Brewster contributed to this report.\"]","href_hash":"da1076b6529811eca60a83352e1c844f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"da1076b6529811eca60a83352e1c844f"}},
