Popular culture \\u2014 an important element in his work, whether he embraces or eviscerates it \\u2014 evaded him while he was growing up.\", \"He found the film, inspired by a real-life bank robbery, incredible. And inspiring. \\u201cYou\\u2019re like, Whoa, all of this happened in one night,\\u201d Kelly said in a recent interview. \\u201cIt felt like theater to me. It\\u2019s in one place. There\\u2019s no music. And the movie itself feels like a documentary \\u2014 it feels super real.\\u201d\", \"Before the Covid-19 pandemic, Kelly drew acclaim as an Off Broadway choreographer in plays like \\u201cFairview\\u201d and \\u201cA Strange Loop,\\u201d and was in the process of developing a retelling of \\u201cDog Day Afternoon.\\u201d In the film, Sonny (Al Pacino\\u2019s character) needs money to pay for gender confirmation surgery for his partner, Leon (Chris Sarandon).\", \"Kelly, who grew up in Fort Hood, Texas, before moving to Long Branch, N.J., connected with the character of Leon. His parents were divorced; he didn\\u2019t know his father. He was bullied, and even in his dance universe, he felt separate and stuck as the only boy, once again on the outside. For Kelly, now 34, the film is not only a lesson in storytelling, it\\u2019s also a display of love \\u2014 queer love, at that. What if, he thought, \\u201cDog Day Afternoon\\u201d could be re-created from Leon\\u2019s perspective?\", \"\\u201cI was captivated by the performance and also very upset by it,\\u201d Kelly said, \\u201cbecause what\\u2019s interesting is that it seems that this whole movie is about this character, or hinges on this character\\u2019s need. But Leon is only in the film for four minutes.\\u201d\", \"Leon was based on Elizabeth Debbie Eden, a trans woman who was depicted as a man in the film. For \\u201cWednesday,\\u201d Kelly\\u2019s multilayered, conceptual, sharply funny and visually arresting retelling, he has immersed himself in Eden\\u2019s life. Kelly breaks apart \\u201cDog Day Afternoon\\u201d and puts it back together as a meditation on his connection with Eden, whom he sees as being erased from popular culture. He can relate. The new show functions as a live stage speculative documentary, or, as he said, \\u201ca documentary of our process.\\u201d\", \"The production opens on Wednesday at New York Live Arts, where Kelly was the 2019-20 Randjelovi\\u0107/Stryker resident commissioned artist. Its premiere was postponed by a year because of the pandemic, but Kelly and his group continued working on it. Drama ensued within his company, the feath3r theory \\u2014 Kelly called it a revolt. He started with a cast of seven, which grew to 18; in the end, only seven remained.\", \"The core question in \\u201cWednesday\\u201d is relevant to the turmoil: Who has the right to tell anyone\\u2019s story? There were times during the process when Kelly was told that he didn\\u2019t have the right to tell Eden\\u2019s \\u2014 including by some of his dancers. He said, \\u201cThey\\u2019re like, \\u2018This is a white trans woman and you\\u2019re a queer Black man. It\\u2019s not your story to tell.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"But it\\u2019s Kelly\\u2019s story, too, as well as that of the dancers, in a way. There are moments in \\u201cWednesday\\u201d when the cast interjects confessionals from the performers about what they\\u2019re doing while they\\u2019re doing it. \\u201cI would never rob a bank,\\u201d one says. \\u201cBut I would certainly let someone rob a bank for me.\\u201d The kicker: \\u201cIt\\u2019s very Madonna, Blond Ambition \\u2014 but I\\u2019m just trying to figure out the difference between a 1972 bank robbery and a 2021 GoFundMe.\\u201d\", \"Kelly can be scathing and funny at once. Bill T. Jones, the artistic director of Live Arts, has gotten to know him well; as part of his residency, Kelly requested periodic talks with Jones. \\u201cI ask him, \\u2018Why do you feel you\\u2019re a dance artist?\\u2019\\u201d Jones said. \\u201c\\u2018Do you have loyalty to dance as a form?\\u2019 And he has a way of answering those things as, \\u2018Why not?\\u2019 In a way, it comes out to be something about how all theater has certain things in common and all theater can be used as a certain kind of tool. And that\\u2019s why I find it fascinating to see what his projects are. He is really thinking very freely about them.\\u201d\", \"Ultimately, Kelly said, he knows his attempt to tell Eden\\u2019s story will be a failure. \\u201cThat doesn\\u2019t mean that I shouldn\\u2019t try to do it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat I shouldn\\u2019t experience the humanity that it is to take someone else\\u2019s perspective to mind. And that that idea is bigger than me. And that idea is bigger than Eden. And if we employ that to our process, it\\u2019s bigger than the show.\\u201d\", \"And the show looks impressive, too. Kelly loves to saturate a space with color; \\u201cWednesday,\\u201d with its red columns and hanging silver balls, features a modular set by You-Shin Chen \\u201cthat allows us to be,\\u201d Kelly said, \\u201cin a bank, rehearsal studio, cabaret club, queer fantasia.\\u201d\", \"Janet Wong, the associate artistic director of Live Arts, admires how Kelly\\u2019s work is \\u201cso highly produced in a world of scarcity,\\u201d she said.\", \"And, she noted with something like awe, he even managed to create new work during the pandemic: \\u201cHysteria (Ugly Part 2).\\u201d Performed in the lobby at Live Arts in April, with small crowds watching from the sidewalk, it further explored the effect of pop culture on queer Black identity. \\u201cHe got a seven-city tour out of that,\\u201d Wong said. \\u201cDuring Covid. He even took it to Vienna. Hopefully, \\u2018Wednesday\\u2019 propels him to the next part of his career.\\u201d\", \"Kelly has more plans related to \\u201cWednesday,\\u201d including an actual documentary, called \\u201cAny Given Wednesday,\\u201d which follows the rise, fall and rise again of his company. It will be directed by Kelly and Laura Snow, his video collaborator; they met as students at Connecticut College. Snow, also the director of media at New York City Ballet, has been filming Kelly\\u2019s company since 2012.\", \"During the pandemic, when Kelly and Snow were wondering what the future of the company would be, or if it even had one, they realized Snow had \\u201chard drives and hard drives of footage\\u201d that they could study to find out: \\u201cHow did we wind up in this moment?\\u201d\", \"The process helped Kelly to bring the company together again \\u2014 and \\u201cto be its leader and admit when I\\u2019m wrong,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHow do you ask people to enter a process that is going to hold up a mirror to them, and then ask them to do that to an audience and not have an extreme desire to take care of them as people?\\u201d\", \"Something else revealed itself in the process: what the feath3r theory stands for. While the \\u201c3\\u201d refers to dance, theater and media, \\u201cfeather\\u201d has to do with the idea of \\u201chow people come together and why they fall apart or separate,\\u201d Kelly said, \\u201cwhich is what feathers do.\\u201d\", \"That he was able to mend his feather was crucial. To him, having a company allows his ideas to grow. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that I can do what I do otherwise,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI learn how to be an experimental artist by having a company. And I take risks because of what we build with our company. I don\\u2019t think we would have been able to recover, in terms of the pandemic, in terms of the revolt, in terms of being excited about this story that continues to turn in on itself \\u2014 without it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8fa573e4520511eca64971c456189541"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8fa573e4520511eca64971c456189541"}},
