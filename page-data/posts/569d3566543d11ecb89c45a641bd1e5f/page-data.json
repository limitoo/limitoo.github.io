It can just start with a little kiss even with somebody that you know\\u2014they were exposed and they're not showing symptoms.\\\"\", \"She went on to say that many times doctors had advised her not to worry about her baby being infected with COVID as he would not be affected by the virus.\", \"The three-month-old's father, also named Tyler, added that he advises the parents of children too young to be vaccinated to take steps to protect their children against COVID. The father said: \\\"Our doctor said that he was healthy, and it didn't build his system, it destroyed his system.\\\"\", \"The Centers for Disease Control And Prevention (CDC) recommends everyone ages 5 and older get a COVID-19 vaccine to help protect against the virus. No COVID vaccinations have yet been approved by the CDC for children of four years old and under.\", \"The Mayo Clinic says: \\\"Children of all ages can become ill with Coronavirus, but most kids who are infected typically don't become as sick as adults and some might not show any symptoms at all.\\\"\", \"The nonprofit American academic medical center adds that parents should be aware of the signs and symptoms of COVID in babies and children.\", \"Johns Hopkins listed the symptoms of COVID as: fever or chills, sore throat, diarrhea, headache, nausea or vomiting, and congestion or a runny nose. It adds that difficulty breathing is less common in infants than adults, but children can have pneumonia, with or without obvious symptoms.\", \"Johns Hopkins adds: \\\"However, serious illness in children with COVID-19 is possible, and parents should stay alert if their child is diagnosed with, or shows signs of, the disease.\\\"\", \"An article from the hospital reviewed by Associate Hospital Epidemiologist, and Professor of Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins, Aaron Michael Milstone, stated: \\\"COVID-19 was initially milder in young children than in adults but the Delta variant has led to an increase in the number and severity of pediatric cases.\", \"\\\"Parents and caregivers should understand that children infected with the coronavirus can develop complications requiring hospitalization, and can transmit the virus to others.\\\"\", \"John Hopkins added that, in rare cases, children infected with the coronavirus can develop a serious lung infection and become very sick with COVID-19, and deaths have occurred as a result of this. He added: \\\"That's why it is important to use precautions and prevent infection in children as well as adults.\\\"\", \"According to a recent report by the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children's Hospital Association, as of November 25, nearly 6.9 million children have tested positive for COVID-19 since the onset of the pandemic.\", \"This means that, since the pandemic began, children represented 17 percent of total COVID cases. For the week ending November 25, in which nearly 132,000 child cases were added to totals, during this week the under-18s accounted for almost 25 percent of reported weekly COVID-19 cases.\", \"The report added that for 45 states reporting COVID figures, children represented up to 0.24 percent of COVID mortalities, with six states reporting no deaths in children resulting from the virus.\", \"The Mayo Clinic points out that babies under the age of one year old might be at higher risk of severe illness with COVID-19 than older children.\", \"This is likely a result of the fact they have immature immune systems and smaller airways. The Mayo Clinic says it makes them more likely to develop breathing issues with respiratory virus infections.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944926/covid-mask-infant.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A stock image of a masked woman cradling a child.
