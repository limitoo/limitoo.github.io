The church claims to have 6 million members in 200 countries, with the U.S. center of operations in Van Nuys, Los Angeles. Three Los Angeles-based church officials were also named in the indictment.\", \"The indictment accuses Quiboloy and the others of recruiting women and girls, ranging from 12 to 25 years old, to work for him as \\\"pastorals.\\\" They would cook and clean for him, as well as travel with him.\", \"\\\"Pastorals\\\" who worked \\\"night duty\\\" for him would be coerced into having sex with him under \\\"the threat of physical and verbal abuse and eternal damnation,\\\" the indictment said. Some of the girls who did \\\"night duty\\\" were as young as 15.\", \"Workers who managed to escape told the FBI they had to work year-round and would be physically and psychologically abused if they did not meet daily quotas.\", \"According to AP, Quiboloy is believed to be in the Philippines, ready to face legal issues.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936422/apollo-carreon-quiboloy-church-leader.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Apollo Carreon Quiboloy, the leader of the Philippines-based Kingdom of Jesus Christ church, was charged with having sex with women and underage girls, federal prosecutors announced on Thursday.
