The Treasury Department is also announcing sanctions against the men, their colleagues and the company they worked for.\", \"The defendants are not in custody and are believed still to be in Iran, but officials hope the indictment and accompanying sanctions will restrict their ability to travel.\", \"As part of the cyber campaign, officials say, the hackers attempted to compromise voter websites in 11 states and successfully downloaded voter information of more than 100,000 people in one state. They also sent what officials described as carefully curated messages to Americans of both major political parties.\", \"To Republican officials and people associated with the Trump campaign, the indictment says, the hackers crafted Facebook messages that falsely claimed that Democrats were planning to commit voter fraud. A manufactured video spread through social media platforms purported to show an individual hacking into state voting websites and registering fraudulent absentee ballots. In the case of Democrats, officials say, the hackers sent emails that threatened to \\\"come after\\\" voters who didn't support Trump.\", \"\\\"This indictment details how two Iran-based actors waged a targeted, coordinated campaign to erode confidence in the integrity of the U.S. electoral system and to sow discord among Americans,\\\" Assistant Attorney General Matthew Olsen, the head of the Justice Department's national security division,\\u00a0said in a statement. \\\"The allegations illustrate how foreign disinformation campaigns operate and seek to influence the American public.\\\"\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"0a23a32448c011ec95622502da624544"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0a23a32448c011ec95622502da624544"}},
