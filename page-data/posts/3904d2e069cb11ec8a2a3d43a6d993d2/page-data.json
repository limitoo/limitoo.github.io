We're also looking at transmission sites, so if we see a lot of cases from a particular venue or setting like a\\u00a0church or pub, then that will be called out for close contacts, and then our vulnerable settings where people are at higher risk.\\\"\", \"SA Health took to social media in an attempt to clarify the definitions.\", \"\\\"In South Australia we will continue to include 'close contacts' as those who have been in a setting with significant transmission of COVID-19, and there has been greater than 15 minutes of face-to-face contact,' the post said.\", \"Anyone who has had more than\\u00a015 minutes of face-to-face contact with a COVID-positive person in a high-risk community\\u00a0or workplace will also be classified as a \\\"close contact\\\".\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Restrictions to remain</div>\", \"Professor Spurrier said public health measures and social restrictions would likely remain in place for the whole of January.\", \"\\\"Certainly, January is going to be pretty tough.\\\"\", \"Former World Health Organization epidemiologist Adrian Esterman has projected South Australia's daily\\u00a0COVID-19 numbers could grow to more than 6,000 by the end of January.\", \"Professor Spurrier said official modelling was still being finalised.\", \"\\\"What is difficult to take into account is how the restrictions will work, how compliant people will be, the impact of boosters, and how effective our contact tracing is. They're quite complicated things\\u00a0to put into a model,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"But we need to be doing that modelling because we have to plan for how many people will end up in hospital.\", \"\\\"We are expecting numbers to get quite large, but everything we do as individuals will help reduce that number.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"3904d2e069cb11ec8a2a3d43a6d993d2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3904d2e069cb11ec8a2a3d43a6d993d2"}},
