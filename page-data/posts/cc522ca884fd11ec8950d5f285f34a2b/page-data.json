On Wednesday, before the policy announcement, markets had priced in two 10-basis-point increases in the deposit rate this year. The rate is currently negative 0.5 percent.\", \"Inflation data released on Wednesday surprised economists, showing that the rate of price rises in January in the 19 countries using the common European currency had reached 5.1 percent compared with a year ago. That was only a slight increase from the 5 percent rate in December, but set yet another record for the eurozone.
