The court left a restraining order that protects the officers' anonymity.\", \"According to The Associated Press, six officers filed a lawsuit against several people who filed public records requests trying to learn their identities. The records requests also pursued information about the investigation by the Office of Police Accountability into their actions in the country's capital. A judge had previously ordered the release of the officers' names but they appealed and received a temporary restraining order.\", \"Two of the officers, who are married, had their names revealed after the investigation discovered they violated the law in D.C. The oversight agency said the other four officers did not violate the law or policies. The two officers who behaved illegally, Caitlin and Alexander Everett, were fired. The four others continued to pursue their lawsuit, claiming they would experience harassment if their identities were released.\", \"On Nov. 9, the court heard oral arguments on the case. Some judges asked if the officers should expect to maintain their privacy while attending an event that was highly publicized and attended by the President of the United States.\", \"No explanation as to why the judges decided to send the case to another court instead of making a ruling was given.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935191/seattle-cops-identities-lawsuit.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Washington Supreme Court has refused to rule on a case that looked to release the identities of Seattle police officers who attended a Jan. 6 rally on the day of the capitol riot.
