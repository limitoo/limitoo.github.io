Most of the time, though, I choose to break it up into florets \\u2014 the smaller the better, cooked nice and brown and crisp on the edges.\", \"Melissa Clark\\u2019s cauliflower Parm takes crispness very seriously, which is why I love it. She coats the florets of all sizes in bread crumbs and shallow fries the lot, then layers the pieces with tomato sauce, mozzarella and grated Parmesan, and bakes it. Not in the mood to fry? Sarah DiGregorio\\u2019s delicious farro and cauliflower Parm involves a quick roast instead, and gets a nice crunch from a bread crumb topping.\", \"If I\\u2019d just baked some banana bread, and had some spare peels lying around, I\\u2019d try Nigella Lawson\\u2019s cauliflower and banana peel curry, which cleverly softens the banana skins in a spicy coconut gravy. And Ali Slagle\\u2019s cauliflower adobo sounds like such a cozy, luxurious dinner to me right now. Her recipe involves only a few steps, which is ideal if you\\u2019re still recovering from this last round of holiday hosting, cooking and dishwashing. Cut a whole head into about eight wedges, then sear them in a large pan and add a quick, peppery, vinegary sauce, inspired by Filipino chicken adobo. While the cauliflower is cooking, start a pot of rice. Bonus: Leftover adobo travels and reheats really well.\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"No matter which veggies you\\u2019re cooking this week, I highly recommend making a batch of Samin Nosrat\\u2019s herby, fried shallot bread crumb crunch and just keeping it on hand. If you\\u2019re craving a little texture, it brings it to any dish \\u2014 a tender platter of roast carrots, a bowl of brothy beans, the top of a cauliflower and cheese casserole \\u2014 adding tons of dimension every time.\", \"Another excellent topping to consider with (almost!) any dish you\\u2019re making is a variation on this soft herb salad: tender herbs dressed with a mix of fried nuts, chile and lemon juice.\", \"Thanks so much for reading the Veggie and see you next week!
