some say weaken, by reducing the Children's Commissioner's powers.\", \"It shows:\", \"Most occurred in the actual placement - such as the family or non-family home or youth residence - and a minority away from the placement, for instance, abuse by a stranger.\", \"\\\"Some of the harm was of a serious nature and resulted in children sustaining bruising and welts,\\\" the report said.\", \"\\\"Some of the children disclosed being fearful of the caregiver.\\\"\", \"In 27 cases, staff in residences caused harm to teenagers they were restraining.\", \"Oranga Tamariki's general manager of practice, Nicolette Dixon, said improvements have been made despite the number of children abused in state care rising.\", \"She told Morning Report that was unacceptable and agreed more needed to be done.\", \"But she said the way Oranga Tamariki responds to cases of harm has changed a lot and they are now better at identifying and responding to it.\", \"\\\"We want to know any time harm is occurring to a child in care so that we can act on it and stop it from happening, we obviously don't want any children to be harmed in our care, we are paying really close attention to what the data tells us in terms of these increases.\", \"\\\"But what I would note is that we have social workers who are spending more time talking to children making it easier for them to tell us if something's not right.\\\"\", \"Dixon said the report reflects a broad range of types of abuse but all of it is serious and reflects actions that are unacceptable to children.\", \"She said it includes harsh discipline, harm that children might experiencing from their peers and harm that might be taking place outside of the caregiving arrangement.\", \"Dixon agrees with the Independent Children's Monitor's report that Oranga Tamariki still has a lot of work to do, but said it also notes that the organisation's response when harm is found is more robust than in the past.\", \"She said the report finds that Oranga Tamariki is more accurately recording assessment findings, is more likely to ensure that children know the outcomes of any assessment and is more likely to review caregiver's plans when harm has been found to ensure support is in place to address the harm and to prevent further harm.\", \"Dixon said if there is a finding of harm the caregiver's status is formally reviewed.\", \"\\\"That means understanding the extent to which the concerns can be addressed and resolved, in many cases though those caregivers will not continue to be our caregivers.\\\"\", \"The children's advocacy group, VOYCE -

Social workers then assess the risks and the caregiving arrangement and see to the child's needs. Abusers can be prosecuted in some cases.\", \"The report says harm done by family caregivers decreased significantly; OT noted that last year all new caregivers began being put through a new programme advising them on how to care for children.\", \"Children who remained at their home while under OT's care, or who returned home to the care of parents, \\\"continues to be an area of risk\\\" - reflecting \\\"the adult's escalation to violence in anger\\\".\", \"The pandemic might be in play, and it would take a closer look at this, the agency said. \\\"The lockdown periods experienced by tamariki in the last year may be producing additional stress within care arrangements.\\\"\", \"The Independent Children's Monitor, set up in 2019 to gauge whether OT is meeting new national care standards (NCS), said it was impossible to know if Oranga Tamariki was on target due to the poor quality of its self-monitoring.\", \"\\\"Oranga Tamariki respond well when tamariki enter care; practices weaken during their time in care,\\\" it said.\", \"\\\"In nearly two-thirds of cases, tamariki are not visited as often as outlined in their plan.
