A critic and historian of music, art and so much more for over four decades, he was a singular voice, a fount of bravura essays on the fantastical creativity, determined resilience and wry paradoxes of Black creativity and life.\", \"His writing froze and shattered time, supercharged neurons, unraveled familiar knots and tied up beautiful new ones. It contained uncanny, elevated descriptions of sound and performance, offered grounded philosophical inquisitions and sprinkled in wink-nudge personal asides. It could have the cadence of smack talk, or a conspiratorial whisper. And it was patient, unfurling at exactly the pace of gestation, while somehow containing turns of phrase that appeared to be moving at warp speed.\", \"It doesn\\u2019t matter which page you open to in his crucial 1992 anthology \\u201cFlyboy in the Buttermilk: Essays on Contemporary America\\u201d \\u2014 just open it. Eruptions of style \\u2014 of pure intellectual vigor and unhurried swagger \\u2014 are everywhere.\", \"Page 123, leading into a review of Public Enemy: \\u201cGranted, Charlie Parker died laughing. Choked chicken wing perched over \\u201950s MTV. So? No way in hell did Bird, believing there was no competition in music, will his legacy to some second-generation be-boppers to rattle over the heads of the hip-hop nation like a rusty sabre.\\u201d\", \"Page 221, on Don DeLillo: \\u201cDeLillo\\u2019s books are inward surveys of the white supremacist soul \\u2014 on the run from mounting evidence that its days are (as the latest in Black militant button-wear loves to inform us) numbered.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhen you\\u2019re younger, it\\u2019s all about expressionism, it\\u2019s all about trying to make as much noise as possible,\\u201d Tate said in an interview with the Los Angeles Review of Books in 2018. \\u201cI was trying to literally approximate music on the page.\\u201d\", \"To read Tate was to be awed by a gift that verged on the extraterrestrial. But he was as meaningful and influential for the words he wrote as for the possibilities he made room for. Aspiring critics, this one included, understood: You almost certainly could not do what Tate did, but what a revelation nonetheless to learn about all the available space between the ground where mortals pecked away at keys and wherever he resided. There were whole galaxies of possibility to explore, so many fertile places you might land.\", \"Fearless isn\\u2019t exactly the word for how Tate approached his subjects \\u2014 that would imply that to honor one\\u2019s own intellectual truth was in some way contingent on, or mindful of, the acquiescence of others. Maybe boundless is better. He rightly understood that the scope of criticism extended far beyond the borders of the subject work. The subject was the pretext, the intro, the foyer to a whole house.\", \"Tate began writing in the late 1970s, and began contributing in The Village Voice in 1981. He moved to New York from Washington, D.C., soon after, and sought out the city\\u2019s creative spasms: jazz, art, literature, newly emergent hip-hop.\", \"In that era, the alt-weekly was the medium most comfortable publishing writing with high stakes, open ears, indelible flair, infinite possibility. And in that ecosystem, Tate was the lodestar. Take \\u201cCult-Nats Meet Freaky-Deke,\\u201d a visionary essay which appeared in The Voice in 1986 that called for a \\u201cpopular poststructuralism \\u2014 accessible writing bent on deconstructing the whole of Black culture.\\u201d It was a call to critical arms to rise to the \\u201cpostnationalist\\u201d output of the time \\u2014 in short, Tate wanted peers as ambitious and wild-minded as the culture he was covering.\", \"When he loved something, he was bracing. On Miles Davis: \\u201c\\u2018Bitches Brew\\u2019 is an orchestral marvel because it fuses James Brown\\u2019s antiphonal riffing against a metaphoric bass drone with Sly\\u2019s minimalist polyrhythmic melodies and Jimi\\u2019s concept of painting pictures with ordered successions of electronic sounds.\\u201d\", \"When he was frustrated by something, he was bracing. In a roasting of Michael Jackson\\u2019s \\u201cBad,\\u201d and in a way, of Jackson himself: \\u201cJackson\\u2019s decolorized flesh reads as the buppy version of Dorian Gray, a blaxploitation nightmare that offers this moral: Stop, the face you save may be your own.\\u201d (When Jackson died, in 2009, Tate\\u2019s memorial tribute loudly affirmed Jackson\\u2019s place in the soul pantheon while still agonizing over the personal choices Jackson made, especially in his later years.)\", \"And he planted flags early. Critics before Tate had written about rap music, of course, but his early pieces on Eric B. & Rakim, Public Enemy, De La Soul and others stand as the definitive critical engagements of their day. They also made the case not just for a hip-hop canon but for hip-hop as canon.\", \"Not long after \\u201cFlyboy\\u201d came out in 1992, Tate brought his pen to Vibe magazine, which in its infancy was underpinned by a downtown New York cosmohemian sensibility that he helped shape with his mere presence.\", \"His column, \\u201cBlack-Owned,\\u201d was a staple and a megaphone trumpeting the most progressive creators across disciplines. In the October 1993 issue, one of the magazine\\u2019s first, he wrote a dynamic full-page poem called \\u201cWhat Is Hip-Hop?\\u201d: \\u201cHip-hop is inverse capitalism/Hip-hop is reverse colonialism.\\u201d\", \"In 1995, he sat with Richard Pryor: \\u201cYou literally have to go to Shakespeare, James Joyce, or James Baldwin to find readings of human folly as incisive as Pryor\\u2019s. Yet Pryor has it one up on those masters of the word: He didn\\u2019t need exclamation points \\u2014 his body movement was his punctuation.\\u201d\", \"On D\\u2019Angelo\\u2019s \\u201cVoodoo,\\u201d in 1999: \\u201cThere are times when the music on this disc sounds so raw, so naked and exposed, you\\u2019ll be tempted to throw a blanket over its brittle, shivering bones.\\u201d On TV on the Radio, in 2006: \\u201cLead singer Tunde Adebimpe has a wandering tenor wail that seems undecided between Catholicism\\u2019s four-part chorales, doo-wop\\u2019s street-corner symphonies and New Wave\\u2019s girly-man blues.\\u201d\", \"Full disclosure \\u2014 I assigned the TV on the Radio review, one of my first decisions when I joined the magazine as music editor. The opportunity to bring Tate back into those pages was a gift. (He also was a relentless mentor and connector \\u2014 he introduced me to one of the first people I hired there.) By that point, Tate\\u2019s sui generis brilliance was widely acknowledged in our circles, and still barely touched by others. Showcasing his critical pirouetting was meant to serve as a beacon, and also a simple acknowledgment of the way he affected every writer I cared about and learned from \\u2014 we\\u2019re all Tate\\u2019s children. I still buy \\u201cFlyboy\\u201d every time I see it in a bookstore. I never want to be too far away from it, lest I forget how vast the cosmos is.\"]","href_hash":"35c974f6586311ecaf68df7fe0d8de0c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"35c974f6586311ecaf68df7fe0d8de0c"}},
