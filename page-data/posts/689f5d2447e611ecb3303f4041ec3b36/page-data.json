Peng, who had a previous consensual relationship with Zhang while he was in office, also accused his wife of guarding the door while she was being sexually assaulted. She made the claims on the Chinese social media platform Weibo earlier this month but\\u00a0the post was quickly deleted, raising fears over her safety.\\u00a0\", \"On Wednesday, Chinese-state controlled media published an email it said was from Peng to WTA chairman and CEO Steve Simon, saying she has't been missing.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The news in that release, including the allegation of sexual assault is not true,\\\" the message read. \\\"I'm not missing, nor am I unsafe.

Peng Shuai displayed incredible courage in describing an allegation of sexual assault against a former top official in the Chinese government. The WTA and the rest of the world need independent and verifiable proof that she is safe. I have repeatedly tried to reach her via numerous forms of communication, to no avail.\\\"\", \"Before the purported statement, China's state media had suppressed all reporting on the case. The accusations from Peng marked the first time the #MeToo movement has struck at the top echelons of the ruling Communist Party, the Associated Press reported.\\u00a0\", \"Censorship of the incident has taken the tennis world by storm. Earlier this week, Djokovic, men's tennis No.1-ranked player, said he was \\\"shocked\\\"\\u00a0and wished her safe return.
