If they see a priest or a nun they get triggered by what happened to them.''\", \"A common thread coming from the evidence of survivors is that when they tried to tell someone about the abuse inflicted on them, whether it be to other staff, the police or family, more often than not they were not believed.\", \"''Unfortunately their parents didn't believe them and in some cases the boys got a hiding for saying horrible things about those wonderful men that were looking after them.''\", \"Clearwater related a story to the inquiry about a homeless man who came to him seeking help.\", \"He had been raped as a child while at Marylands.\", \"When Clearwater phoned the head of St John of God, on the man's behalf, he got a sharp response from Brother Timothy Graham.\", \"''After the money is he?, Was the response I got straight away.''\", \"\\\"The person heard it and he looked over at me and said, they never f...... believe me.
