Hawaii has spent more than 600 days under emergency orders, which the governor has noted is unprecedented.\", \"During their last legislative session, state lawmakers tried to limit Ige's emergency powers. However, the measure ultimately failed.\", \"The current restrictions on social gatherings and businesses were due to expire on November 30 after first being put into place in August.\", \"\\\"We feel comfortable at this point in time to relax some of the restrictions,\\\" Ige said at a news conference, adding: \\\"We are at a better place than three months ago, but we are still not finished with the pandemic.\\\"\", \"Approximately 1,002 people in Hawaii have died due to the virus, according to data from the state's health department. Over the course of the pandemic, the state has seen under 5,000 hospitalizations and approximately 86,991 confirmed cases.\", \"\\\"The sacrifices we have all made have prevented even further loss of life,\\\" Ige said on Tuesday. \\\"Hawaii continues to have amongst the lowest rates of infections and fatalities in the nation due to this COVID-19 pandemic.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939821/hawaii-ease-some-covid-restrictions.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Hawaii Governor David Ige announced Tuesday he will be lifting some COVID-19 restrictions.
