Which is why it was refreshing to talk to Claudia Goldin, a Harvard University economics professor and the author of a new book, \\u201cCareer and Family: Women\\u2019s Century-Long Journey toward Equity,\\u201d which traces the ascent of college-educated women in the United States and their ability to combine well-paid work and motherhood.\", \"Considering how far mothers have come in the past 100 years, she is optimistic about mothers at work in the long term, despite pandemic woes. As Goldin explains in \\u201cCareer and Family,\\u201d in the early 20th century, college-educated women frequently had to choose between having a career and having children; she notes that only 50 percent of women who graduated from college from 1900 to 1919 had kids by age 44. Of women who graduated from college from 1980 to 2000, 79 percent had children by 44, which suggests that most college-educated women who wanted kids had them.\", \"Workplaces \\u201care changing because the fundamentals have changed,\\u201d Goldin told me, even though mothers \\u201chave been scarred\\u201d by the pandemic. Remote work has become normalized, and some power is at least temporarily back in the hands of workers, who have a bit of leverage in a tighter labor market.\", \"She\\u2019s not delusional about the challenges ahead. Goldin writes: \\u201cWe\\u2019re often guilty of disregarding the enormous scale and long history of gender disparities. A single company slapped on the wrist, one more woman who makes it to the boardroom, a few progressive tech leaders who go on paternity leave \\u2014 such solutions are the economic equivalent of tossing a box of Band-Aids to someone with bubonic plague.\\u201d\", \"The main reason she is optimistic, though, is that the pandemic, she said, may have \\u201cchanged greedy jobs to be less greedy, and we have changed flexible jobs to be more productive.\\u201d\", \"The new problem with no name is \\u201cgreedy work\\u201d\", \"Goldin dissects the numerous factors that go into the gender wage gap, which is larger for mothers than for women who do not have children, and finds that the biggest problem is what economists call greedy work: \\u201chigh-salary jobs with long, inflexible hours,\\u201d according to one Harvard Business Review article. Highly educated women tend to be married to highly educated men, and when both partners have greedy jobs, it\\u2019s typically women who step back to tend to family, because most \\u201cparents cannot (and do not want to) contract away all care for their children,\\u201d Goldin writes. (Single parents have less room to step back, and same-sex couples can often avoid the normative gender expectations that opposite-sex couples deal with.)\", \"As an example, she focuses on research that compared female M.B.A. graduates and their male counterparts. Right after graduation, women earned close to the same as their male counterparts. But 13 years later, Goldin found, women earned \\u201c64 cents on the male dollar.\\u201d The pay gap can be explained by the parental leave trade-offs that working moms have to make: Often the highest-paying jobs require such long hours that mothers can\\u2019t consider taking those jobs, and the jobs that still require long hours (even if not quite as long) pay less.\", \"Surprisingly, to me at least, was that the occupational sector with the smallest gender earnings gap Goldin studied was for engineers: \\u201cWomen in tech earn 94 cents on the male tech dollar,\\u201d she said. That\\u2019s because many tech workers tend to have fewer time constraints at work and less structured work, with more autonomy to determine their goals and priorities, and their work depends less on interpersonal relationships than it does in, perhaps, chummier sectors of the corporate world. The largest gaps were among M.D.s and J.D.s \\u2014 likely because doctors\\u2019 and lawyers\\u2019 jobs allow less flexible schedules and, especially for doctors, are done in person and in coordination with many other people.\", \"Loss of family time is a loss for everyone, not just mothers.\", \"The silver lining of the otherwise devastating pandemic, Goldin said, is a \\u201cmassively coordinated equilibrium,\\u201d in which we discovered that a lot of work could be done virtually and many people who spent a lot of time traveling for work found out that it wasn\\u2019t quite as necessary. In the Covid era, fathers have been able to spend more time with their children \\u2014 though still less than the time spent by mothers, and mothers in greedy jobs \\u2014 and perhaps realized how much they were losing by working so many hours.\", \"That\\u2019s important: One of my gripes with the way this issue is framed is that we too often say career women are losing when they have to devote more time to parenting. Goldin is hopeful that we can change the conversation to look at how much fathers, too, are losing by spending so much time at work. \\u201cI hear it from my students, who, of course, are the workers of tomorrow, that they don\\u2019t want a life in which they\\u2019re not home for dinner with their kids,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThey want to have a family, and they want to have the type of family that eats together.\\u201d\", \"Pandemic woes have also brought conversations about the challenges of working mothers to the fore. Though paid leave was stripped out of the most recent version of President Biden\\u2019s Build Back Better legislation, universal pre-K and child care provisions are still in play, and if they become law, will be a boon for all families, particularly those with working moms. \\u201cWho ever thought that coming out of this pandemic, we\\u2019d be talking about universal preschool?\\u201d Goldin said.\", \"Good point. As uncertain as things remain for parents across the board, I don\\u2019t want to lose sight of progress, however glacial that progress might seem.\", \"If you want a chance to get your Tiny Victory published, find us on Instagram @NYTparenting and use the hashtag #tinyvictories; email us; or enter your Tiny Victory at the bottom of this page.
