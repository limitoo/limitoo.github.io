But he found inspiration, trained hard and set an Olympic record.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-02-06T20:19:20.000Z","content":"[\"After finishing a disappointing 14th in the 5,000-meter speedskating race at the 2018 Olympics, Nils van der Poel did not skate again for almost two years. He barely even trained, in fact. Instead, he joined the Swedish army and became an ultramarathon runner, among other pursuits.\", \"And then he came back. Van der Poel won the 5,000-meter race Sunday night in 6 minutes 8.84 seconds, an Olympic record. His gold medal-winning performance came a year after he set two world records, and he is a heavy favorite to win gold in the 10,000 meters on Friday.\", \"After his victory, van der Poel spoke at length about his unusual training plan and where he finds the motivation needed to be an elite athlete.\", \"How are you setting world records while also not living, eating, breathing speedskating?\", \"When you are a professional athlete in a sport that sucks as much as speedskating sucks, you\\u2019ve got to find a way to make it suck a little less. And whatever you can get inspired by, you need to find that.\", \"Perhaps the guy who trains the most wins. Perhaps it\\u2019s like that. It is pretty likely. So what do you have to bribe yourself with to train more than the others? If you can find the answer to that, perhaps you can win the Olympics.\", \"What is the answer for you?\", \"So I did like 20 ultras. One thousand sky dives. I served in the army for a year. I did a lot of parties. I went snowboarding a lot. I did a lot of ski mountaineering. I biked the entire Sweden.\", \"All since 2018?\", \"Not all of it, but most of it.\", \"So it was like, I had to make it adventurous, because I knew there would come a time when it wouldn\\u2019t be adventurous no more, when I would lock myself up in Inzell* for two months just going for it. But I knew if I wanted to endure that, I had to, like, build up a mountain of motivation because I\\u2019m going to need that motivation one day.\", \"*Inzell is a German town where many speedskaters train.\", \"You can\\u2019t do speedskating day after day?\", \"I don\\u2019t think so, no. No. It is too monotonous to me.\", \"I love it. I really love this sport. More than most things. But if you\\u2019re going to train as much as it\\u2019s needed, you\\u2019ve got to, you\\u2019ve got to love it, man. And if you want to keep loving it, I mean, you\\u2019ve got to work for it. It is like a relationship. It doesn\\u2019t come to you. It doesn\\u2019t become perfect. You\\u2019ve got to work for it.\", \"I think the mistake I made when I was younger was that I didn\\u2019t work for my motivation. I expected my motivation to be there. It\\u2019s not. It\\u2019s not going to be there. You\\u2019ve got to chase it. A lot harder than you chase your opponents. You\\u2019ve got to chase your motivation.\", \"Because what if you wake up and you want to train? What if that happens every day? Perhaps you will be the one who trains the most.\", \"Is this your last season?\", \"I\\u2019ve been trying to quit two times and I haven\\u2019t succeeded. I don\\u2019t think I\\u2019ll succeed this time either. Maybe.\"]","href_hash":"e0b1b608878911ec8a67cb6c995fb92b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e0b1b608878911ec8a67cb6c995fb92b"}},
