The first Queen Elizabeth contoured from her neck ruff up. Severus Snape with jet-black hair extensions. Sasquatch sporting a smoky eye.\", \"These are just a few of the altered images that have been shared by YassifyBot, a Twitter account that started popping up in people\\u2019s feeds this month.\", \"To \\u201cyassify\\u201d something, in the account\\u2019s parlance, is to apply several beauty filters to a picture using FaceApp, an A.I. photo-editing application, until its subject \\u2014 be that a celebrity, a historical figure, a fictional character or a work of fine art \\u2014 becomes almost unrecognizably made up.\", \"Since YassifyBot\\u2019s account was activated on Nov. 13, it has tweeted hundreds of photographs in which subjects\\u2019 lashes appear thick and spidery; their eyebrows look as though they\\u2019ve seen the business end of a pencil; their hair has been lengthened and, often, colored; and their cheekbones and nose are sharply contoured.\", \"It should be noted that YassifyBot is not actually a bot. Its tweets aren\\u2019t generated by software. The account is run by a 22-year-old college student in Omaha who makes art under the name Denver Adams and asked that The Times not reveal their legal name.\", \"The process for making each image is simple: Take a face, run it through FaceApp until it looks generically or grotesquely sexy, post, repeat. Mr. Adams said in a Zoom interview that each image takes only a few minutes to create.\", \"The timing of the account\\u2019s popularity is a bit puzzling. Easy-to-use photo-retouching apps aren\\u2019t new. FaceApp specifically has been the subject of news articles about privacy issues and its \\u201chot\\u201d filter, which was decried as racist for lightening users\\u2019 skin tones. (In 2017, The Guardian reported that FaceApp\\u2019s founder, Yaroslav Goncharov, apologized for the filter, blaming the skin lightening on bias the A.I. software had picked up in its training.)\", \"The word \\u201cyass\\u201d \\u2014 which can also be spelled \\u201cyas,\\u201d \\u201cyaas\\u201d or with any number of A\\u2019s and S\\u2019s for emphasis \\u2014 has been circulating in L.G.B.T.Q. vernacular for more than a decade. The word was further popularized by a 2013 video of a fan admiring Lady Gaga. The Comedy Central show \\u201cBroad City,\\u201d in which Ilana Glazer\\u2019s character frequently deploys the phrase \\u201cyas queen,\\u201d also helped to bring the word into wider use.\", \"According to KnowYourMeme.com, the word \\u201cyassification\\u201d first appeared on Twitter in 2020. As it spread, so did memes of celebrities being digitally made over, including one that depicted the actress Toni Collette screaming in the horror film \\u201cHereditary,\\u201d her face suddenly settling into an artificial glamorized version of itself.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t create the joke,\\u201d Mr. Adams said, citing the meme of Ms. Collette as inspiration. \\u201cI just ruined it.\\u201d\", \"But what, exactly, is the joke?\", \"Mr. Adams chalks it up to the sheer ridiculousness of the images, saying that the more absurd they appear, the funnier they become. \", \"Like many internet jokes, the line between mocking and celebration is murky.\", \"Rusty Barrett, a professor of linguistics at the University of Kentucky who has researched language in gay subcultures, sees a link between the images disseminated by YassifyBot and the culture of drag.\", \"\\u201cIt evokes drag in that drag queens sometimes look plastic and way overdone,\\u201d Prof. Barrett said in a phone interview.\", \"\\u201cPart of it is that it looks good, but it clearly looks fake,\\u201d Prof. Barrett said. \\u201cThat positive view of artifice is something that is common across gay culture.\\u201d\", \"The \\u201cyassify\\u201d memes also share some DNA with the internet subculture of \\u201cbimbofication,\\u201d which valorizes a vapid and surgically enhanced brand of femininity.\", \"Most bimbofication memes are just internet jokes about gender performativity, but some hard-core devotees have taken to Reddit to document their real-life transformations, including self-hypnosis to become more \\u201csmooth-brained.\\u201d\", \"In the same way, yassifying is funny until it\\u2019s not. It\\u2019s a joy to see Harry Potter\\u2019s Dobby or Bernie Sanders looking like a digital glam squad had gotten them ready for the red carpet. But it\\u2019s a horror to think that we\\u2019re so susceptible to this level of shallowness.\", \"All memes have a shelf life, and yassification fatigue has already set in.
