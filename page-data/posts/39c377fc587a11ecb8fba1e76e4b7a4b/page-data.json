He was 89.\", \"His death, after struggling with vascular dementia, was announced by the Opry. \", \"In the book \\u201cFrom the Bottom Up: The Stonewall Jackson Story as Told in His Own Words\\u201d (1991), Mr. Jackson said his stepfather, a short-tempered sharecropper named James Leviner, had often abused him, once hoisting him high above his head and dashing him against a rock.\", \"Another time, Mr. Jackson wrote, his stepfather beat him and left him lying senseless in a field after the boy accidentally spilled a bucket of water that he had been carrying.\", \"\\u201cThe physical scars and pain of being abused don\\u2019t last long,\\u201d Mr. Jackson said, \\u201cbut the mental part of it goes on and on and on.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Jackson\\u2019s 1962 recording \\u201cA Wound Time Can\\u2019t Erase,\\u201d a Top 10 country hit written by Bill D. Johnson, called to mind this early trauma.\", \"\\u201cIs it power you\\u2019ve won for the things that you\\u2019ve done? What you\\u2019ve gained I guess I\\u2019ll never see,\\u201d Mr. Jackson wonders aloud, his heartache set to the record\\u2019s chugging rhythms and uncluttered production.\", \"\\u201cA Wound Time Can\\u2019t Erase\\u201d was the 11th in a string of 23 consecutive singles that reached the country Top 40 for Mr. Jackson from 1958 to 1965. He later had a run of eight consecutive Top 40 country hits from 1966 to 1968, and ultimately placed 44 singles on the country charts before the hits stopped coming in 1973.\", \"\\u201cWaterloo,\\u201d a catchy ditty written by John D. Loudermilk and Marijohn Wilkin, was his biggest record, occupying the top spot on the country chart for five weeks in 1959 and crossing over to the pop Top 10. \\u201cB.J. the D.J.,\\u201d his other No. 1 country single, began its run up the charts toward the end of 1963.\", \"Most of Mr. Jackson\\u2019s recordings were made in the traditional style known as hard country: a lean, shuffling sound accented by keening fiddle and steel guitar. Eleven of his singles, including \\u201cLife to Go,\\u201d a prisoner\\u2019s lament written by George Jones, and \\u201cI Washed My Hands in Muddy Water,\\u201d a Top 20 pop hit for Johnny Rivers in 1966, reached the country Top 10.\", \"Stonewall Jackson was born on Nov. 6, 1932, in Tabor City, N.C. His biological father, a railroad engineer named Waymond David Jackson, wanted him to be named after Thomas Jonathan \\u201cStonewall\\u201d Jackson, the Confederate general from whom he claimed to have been descended, but he died of complications of a hernia before Stonewall, the third of his three boys, was born.\", \"Mr. Jackson\\u2019s mother, who was born Lulu Loraine Turner, remarried after his father died.\", \"Fearing for their safety, Mr. Jackson\\u2019s mother eventually left her sons\\u2019 abusive stepfather and moved the family to Georgia, where they lived in a shack on the farm of the boys\\u2019 paternal grandmother and her husband. Stonewall was working in the fields and cutting timber there before he reached the age of 10.\", \"Hoping to escape the drudgery of sharecropping, Mr. Jackson, who received only a limited education, lied about his age and joined the Army when he was 16. He was discharged as soon as the deception was discovered.\", \"The next year, he enlisted in the Navy, where he served on the submarine rescue vessel Kittiwake and began honing his skills as a guitar player and songwriter. Four years later, he returned to Georgia to farm a small plot before moving to Nashville to try his luck as a songwriter.\", \"His many hit records notwithstanding, Mr. Jackson\\u2019s biggest claim to fame was his six-decade run on the Grand Ole Opry. He remains the only singer to have been invited to join the Opry cast before releasing a record, much less having a hit.\", \"Mr. Jackson, who lived in Brentwood, Tenn., recalled that in 1956, during his first visit to Nashville, he presented himself unannounced at the offices of Acuff-Rose Music in hopes of securing a songwriting deal. Wesley Rose, the son of Fred Rose, the Acuff-Rose executive who gave Hank Williams his start, invited Mr. Jackson to make a demo recording and was impressed with the results.\", \"\\u201cHe called WSM, the radio station that owns and operates the Grand Ole Opry, and told them about me,\\u201d Mr. Jackson was quoted as saying in the liner notes to the 1972 compilation \\u201cThe World of Stonewall Jackson.\\u201d \\u201cHe asked if they would set up an audition for me the next day and asked if I\\u2019d like to try out for the Opry.\\u201d\", \"In 2007, Mr. Jackson\\u2019s relationship with the show soured when he sued Gaylord Entertainment, the Opry\\u2019s parent company, for age discrimination after his appearances on the program were curtailed to make room for younger artists. The lawsuit was settled, for an undisclosed amount, in October 2008, and Mr. Jackson resumed performing on the show.\", \"His wife, Juanita Wair Jackson, died in 2019. Survivors include a son, Stonewall Jr., and two grandchildren. \"]","href_hash":"39c377fc587a11ecb8fba1e76e4b7a4b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"39c377fc587a11ecb8fba1e76e4b7a4b"}},
