The warning comes on the heels of state Governor Charlie Baker's refusal to issue a new statewide mask mandate for public spaces.\", \"Society President Dr. Carole Allen called the numbers \\\"an alarming upward trend\\\" that is straining the state's medical resources. The group specifically called for face masks in all public spaces, regardless of vaccination status.\", \"Baker, a Republican, declined to issue a new mandate, as states like California and New York have already done.\", \"\\\"There are no plans to bring back the statewide mask mandate,\\\" Baker said on Monday. \\\"Keep in mind that we're in a very different place than we were in before. Five million people are fully vaccinated. A million and a half of those are boosted. Over 6 million people have at least one dose.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952068/massachusetts-masks-charlie-baker.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Massachusetts Medical Society released a recommendation urging residents to mask up as COVID-19 case numbers grow.

We must all work together to take steps to confront and stem what could be a continued rise in cases, hospitalizations, serious illness, and death.\\\"\", \"California's mask mandate goes into effect Wednesday and covers all public spaces. New York's mandate started Monday, but allowed venues the alternative of checking people for proof of vaccination. Hawaii, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington have also announced new mask mandates as the Omicron variant continues to spread in the U.S.\", \"Baker's statement on Monday was accompanied by the announcement that the Massachusetts state government would be sending 2 million free rapid-response COVID tests to low-income areas ahead of the holiday season.\", \"\\\"This massive distribution effort and the long-term bulk purchasing agreement will make a real difference here in the state,\\\" Baker said. \\\"The most important element in this is about making rapid tests available on a broad scale to communities that have, in many cases, a lot of people who aren't going to be able to purchase these on our own, to make these tests available so they can test themselves before they go to gatherings or other large indoor events.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"2e27b27c5d4911ec9cc8496cd7339513"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2e27b27c5d4911ec9cc8496cd7339513"}},
