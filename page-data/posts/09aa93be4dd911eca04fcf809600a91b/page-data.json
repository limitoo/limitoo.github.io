Roosevelt Four Freedoms State Park on Roosevelt Island \\u2014 is predicated on the notion that the four freedoms cited in Roosevelt\\u2019s 1941 speech don\\u2019t apply to everyone equally. How would our most vulnerable citizens interpret them? In a series of workshops leading up to the installation, Leonardo attempted to answer that question. For one, he pointed to the freedom from fear: How can it be considered attainable when children continue to be incarcerated? How can people declare it when for them fear persists in the shadows?\", \"The culmination of these exercises is represented in a series of large vinyl murals of hand gestures (which sometimes speak louder than words) that Leonardo applied to the granite walls at the entrance to the park. Words haven\\u2019t been completely ignored, though. QR codes surrounding the works link to audio recordings of workshop participants discussing what freedom \\u2014 or its lack \\u2014 means to them.MELISSA SMITH\", \"The butterflies are back in town.\", \"That may seem like a puzzling announcement in November, but at least one Manhattan site considers it routine: the American Museum of Natural History. After a yearlong pandemic-induced hiatus, the institution is once again presenting its annual exhibition \\u201cThe Butterfly Conservatory: Tropical Butterflies Alive in Winter,\\u201d on view through May 30.\", \"Mimicking a light-filled 80-degree rainforest, this 1,200-square-foot vivarium provides close encounters with as many as 500 creatures, such as monarch, viceroy, blue morpho and emerald swallowtail butterflies, and atlas and luna moths. (Timed entry is required, and visitors must buy tickets that include special-exhibition access.) For curious children, the thrills of wandering among the show\\u2019s blossoms and greenery include seeing these free-flying international travelers alight on an outstretched hand or emerge from a chrysalis.\", \"Small visitors who prefer to keep insects at a distance can enjoy several exhibits outside the conservatory\\u2019s doors. Among them are a short film about metamorphosis and displays on butterfly habitats and adaptations. Owl butterflies, for instance, have large spots that resemble owl eyes \\u2014 a way to fool predators \\u2014 while monarchs contain foul-tasting toxins. Those bright orange wings are nature\\u2019s own caution sign.LAUREL GRAEBER\", \"Before Paul Verhoeven\\u2019s latest provocation, the 17th-century lesbian-nun drama \\u201cBenedetta,\\u201d opens on Dec. 3, IFC Center invites viewers to revisit his scandals of yore. While his early Dutch outrages aren\\u2019t much represented (other than \\u201cSpetters,\\u201d one of the most phallocentric movies ever made, screening on Saturday), you couldn\\u2019t ask for a more ice-pick-sharp Friday-night selection than \\u201cBasic Instinct\\u201d (also showing Sunday through Tuesday), the subject of protests \\u2014 even during filming \\u2014 for its depiction of Sharon Stone\\u2019s bisexual murder suspect. It stands, along with Verhoeven\\u2019s return to Holland, the gripping World War II drama \\u201cBlack Book\\u201d (on Saturday, Tuesday and Wednesday), as the high point of his mastery of the erotic thriller.\", \"Perhaps less seen, but relevant to \\u201cBenedetta,\\u201d is \\u201cFlesh + Blood,\\u201d screening on 35-millimeter film on Sunday. Rutger Hauer\\u2019s character leads a group of mercenaries who claim a divine mandate, but the encroaching plague proves impervious to superstition. \\u201cBenedetta\\u201d will close the series on Dec. 2.BEN KENIGSBERG\", \"They say the Thanksgiving table is no place for certain subjects, but those are just the kind of scraps D.L. Hughley can turn into a feast.\", \"The comedian, who hosts a nationally syndicated afternoon radio show with a companion series on Pluto TV\\u2019s LOL! Network, has been making waves since the late 1990s, when he starred in his own sitcom on ABC and toured as one of \\u201cThe Original Kings of Comedy\\u201d alongside Steve Harvey, Cedric the Entertainer and Bernie Mac, who died in 2008.\", \"Hughley had the political savvy to host his own CNN show and the mainstream appeal to compete on \\u201cDancing With the Stars.\\u201d In 2012, he created and starred in \\u201cD.L. Hughley: The Endangered List,\\u201d a mockumentary for Comedy Central that won a Peabody Award. This year, he published his fifth book, \\u201cHow to Survive America.\\u201d He\\u2019ll certainly have plenty to talk about when he performs at Carolines on Broadway on Friday and Saturday at 7 and 9:45 p.m. Tickets start at $60, with a two-drink minimum.SEAN L. McCARTHY\", \"Wycliffe Gordon, a trombonist and composer who also dabbles (virtuosically) on the trumpet, tuba and more, has described his childhood this way: \\u201cClassical music at home, gospel music at church and country music on the radio.\\u201d On trombone, he can fit himself so snugly into the music he\\u2019s playing that it\\u2019s tempting to pin him down right there: \\u201cAha, he\\u2019s a hard-bop player.\\u201d \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s the sound of a New Orleans traditionalist.\\u201d Actually, what you\\u2019re hearing is his range, and the coolness of his stride.\", \"A onetime member of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra and a former professor at Juilliard next door, Gordon is no stranger to the stage at Dizzy\\u2019s Club. He returns for his annual run of Thanksgiving-week shows there, with sets at 7:30 and 9:30 each night through Sunday, except Thursday, when he will give a special holiday performance at 7 p.m.\", \"His quintet, the International All-Stars, features the Australian saxophonist and multi-reedist Adrian Cunningham, the Israeli-born pianist Ehud Asherie, the Japanese bassist Yasushi Nakamura, and the drummer Alvin Atkinson \\u2014 like Gordon, a native of the American South. Tickets to the Thanksgiving performance are $178, and include a three-course meal. The shows on Friday and Saturday cost $55; on Sunday, $40.GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO\"]","href_hash":"09aa93be4dd911eca04fcf809600a91b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"09aa93be4dd911eca04fcf809600a91b"}},
