They called for their immediate release and the reinstatement of Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok, who was detained by the military.\", \"The seizure of power by Sudan\\u2019s military threatened to upend a fragile transition to democracy in the country \\u2014 the largest on the African continent behind Algeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo \\u2014 just as it was emerging from decades of harsh autocratic rule and isolation.\", \"The coup followed an uneasy power-sharing arrangement with civilian leaders that had been negotiated after a popular 2019 uprising that toppled Omar Hassan al-Bashir, Sudan\\u2019s longtime dictator, who has been wanted for years on genocide charges by the International Criminal Court.\", \"Gen.
