These factors saw phenomenal mortgage growth off the back of them.\\\"\", \"He said it was likely that the strong growth in the bank finances would flatten out as the heat comes off the housing market through higher rates, tighter lending rules, and the dampening effect of the Credit Contracts and Consumer Finance Act (CCCFA) on applications and approvals for finance.\", \"\\\"What you'll see is fewer loans written and perhaps not continued growth, it might go flat, it might even go backwards a little and it may be a year when the stars don't align and the banks will have to work harder, it won't fall into their lap like it did last year.\\\"\", \"However, even if the volume of business slowed, Kensington said he expected that rising interest rates would likely result in bigger margins for the banks.\", \"He hoped the government would be quick to respond to concerns about the CCCFA's effect on lending, which has resulted in delays in processing and previously good borrowers being refused finance.\", \"Kensington said it could be that with a slowing economy through high inflation, disruptions, and rising interest rates that businesses and household living off their own resources might turn to the banks for finance, which a restrictive CCCFA could deprive them of.\", \"\\\"I'd like to see the banks in a position where they can make judgement calls and continue to lend.\\\"\", \"He expected banks to continue with their investment in new technology and digitisation of services and products.\", \"Bank branch numbers fell by nearly 150 to 706, although staff numbers had risen more than 2100 to 27,864.\", \"The ANZ remained far and away the biggest bank with more than $181b in assets, with ASB in second followed by Westpac and BNZ.
