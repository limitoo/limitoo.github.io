He then appeared at the Auckland District Court via an audiovisual link where he was remanded in custody until January 27.\", \"The Destiny Church leader is facing multiple charges relating to the COVID-19 Protection Public Health Order and breaching bail conditions. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.\", \"After nine days in Mt Eden Corrections Facility, Brian is being released following a successful appeal and he is on a 24-hour curfew, Stuff reports.\", \"His wife Hannah took to Facebook soon after his release was announced.\", \"\\\"That's great news. I'm not sure what time he's coming out but he is coming out today,\\\" she said in a Facebook Live.\", \"\\\"Just so glad that he's able to be free. Eight days away from home, nine days we've been camped out here.\\\"\", \"His supporters camped out near Mt Eden prison while he was remanded there. They were accused by people living nearby that they were revving motorbikes and being noisy until the early hours of the morning.\\u00a0\", \"Hannah says she is a \\\"very happy lady\\\" now that her husband is being released.\", \"\\\"We're tidying up now, we're getting ready to leave Mt Eden Corrections Facility and we're so excited,\\\" she says.\", \"\\\"The other thing I want to say is my husband is on home detention, so now I am the captain - she who must be obeyed.\\\"\", \"After he was taken into custody last week, Brian released a statement through his lawyer saying he denies the breach and would defend any allegations.\", \"\\\"It is not accepted that he should have been remanded in custody and any longer period on remand will be challenged vigorously. He believes in the value of the rule of law and is disappointed the contrary has been suggested by those who seek to silence him and any opposition to their power or policy,\\\" his lawyer Ron Mansfield said.\", \"\\\"It is a sad day for the freedom of all New Zealanders when people cannot gather and be heard in opposition to government policy when they believe it to be wrong and contrary to the good of the people.\", \"\\\"The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act has lost any impact that those who drafted it dreamt it might have. Democracy has taken another hit today and we are all worse off for that.\\\"\", \"Police launched an investigation earlier in the month after Tamaki visited Hagley Park in Christchurch to speak at a protest. But he claims it wasn't a protest but rather a \\\"family funday picnic\\\".\", \"He said he didn't organise the event but was asked to speak because he was in the city to preach at the Destiny Church service in Cranmer Square.\", \"Tamaki appeared before a court three times last year. In November, he spoke at an anti-vaccine mandate protest in Auckland attended by more than 1000 people - despite the city being in alert level 3 and mass gatherings banned.\", \"In October, he was charged with attending and organising a protest in breach of alert level 3 restrictions. He pleaded not guilty and was granted bail on the condition he didn't attend or organise any gathering in breach of the COVID-19 requirements.\\u00a0\", \"Days later, Tamaki attended another event at Auckland Domain and was charged with breaching his bail conditions. He again pleaded not guilty and was given bail.\"]","href_hash":"12642cae7e6011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"12642cae7e6011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
