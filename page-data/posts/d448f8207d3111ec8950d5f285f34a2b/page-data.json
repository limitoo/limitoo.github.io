I feel a little bit more comfortable knowing that I've got the booster.

Now is the perfect time to get that done.\\\"\", \"GP and owner of the Mission Bay Doctors clinic, Vicki Mount, agreed with that message.\", \"She said the same applied for children's doses before the return to school next week.\", \"Although her clinic was booked up 10 days in advance for vaccines, she said fewer people were booking in for other healthcare appointments.\", \"\\\"We do notice that for some people they view coming to see their GP as a risky thing to do when there's a sense that the virus might be around. So we have seen a couple of those regular appointments decrease.\", \"\\\"We understand that people are worried but I would say to anyone in that zone that we're very good at keeping you safe.
