Here are five streaming suggestions for the holiday.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-24T03:22:33.000Z","content":"[\"Face it, the centerpiece of Thanksgiving isn\\u2019t the turkey. It\\u2019s the TV. After dinner gets devoured in a fraction of the time it took to cook, the overstuffed proceed to the couch to distract themselves from a third slice of pie by debating what to watch. Relieve some of their pressure by serving up these five streaming suggestions. From comedy to cartoon, weepie to blood bath, here\\u2019s a film for every craving.\", \"Believe it or not, Jodie Foster\\u2019s relatable dramedy about a family who bickers, sobs and seriously questions why they bother sharing a table is rooted in science fiction. The script is by the \\u201cInvasion of the Body Snatchers\\u201d screenwriter W.D. Richter, and when Foster gave it a read, she was struck by the artificiality of being \\u201casked to make a vow of love to people you don\\u2019t really know and who don\\u2019t really understand you.\\u201d Holly Hunter stars as a single mother who comes home to a household simmering with tension. Her aunt (Geraldine Chaplin) has dementia, her mother (Anne Bancroft) is crying in the pantry and her brother (Robert Downey Jr.) is slinging zingers to deflect from his own big secret. For the film\\u2019s centerpiece Thanksgiving scene, Foster went through 64 roast turkeys whose carcasses were flung into laps or onto the floor, then plopped back on the carving dish so Charles Durning\\u2019s paterfamilias could continue pretending things were fine. Every quip deserves to be memorialized in needlepoint. A personal favorite: \\u201cYou\\u2019re a pain in my ass, you have bad hair, but I like you a lot.\\u201d\", \"There\\u2019s no better film on food, family and empathy than Wayne Wang\\u2019s epic about two generations who reconcile their differences over sesame balls and stuffed crab. Four Chinese-born women living in San Francisco regularly gather over the mahjong table to gossip about their grown daughters who, they fear, have settled for the wrong career or the wrong man. The Americanized daughters are well aware of these concerns, but they don\\u2019t know the full story. Their mothers made painful choices before they crossed the Pacific, enduring traumas the daughters may risk repeating if they can\\u2019t share their secrets (along with several bowls of noodles and a bottle of champagne). The novelist Amy Tan reworked her best seller into this screenplay, a collaboration with Ronald Bass, the \\u201cRain Man\\u201d screenwriter. The film is also a reminder to forgive guests who don\\u2019t yet know their host\\u2019s unspoken customs and taboos, like the mother who pardons her daughter\\u2019s fianc\\u00e9 for pouring soy sauce on her signature dish.\", \"If the game\\u2019s not going well, flip on this forgotten football gem from 1971 that set a record for the most-watched made-for-TV movie ever and became the rare film to leap from an ABC Movie of the Week to a major theatrical release. Billy Dee Williams and James Caan star as the real-life Chicago Bears running backs Gale Sayers and Brian Piccolo. Their friendship was forged on the gridiron, tested by the pressures of becoming the NFL\\u2019s first interracial roommates and beatified after Piccolo was stricken with terminal cancer. The movie is based, in part, on Sayers\\u2019s 1970 autobiography, \\u201cI Am Third.\\u201d Sayers, who died last year at 77 from complications of dementia and Alzheimer\\u2019s disease, continues to hold the league record for most touchdowns in a game. But for most of his life, he was best known for this Emmy winning crowd pleaser that exemplifies the meaning of Friendsgiving. It\\u2019s hard not to mist up watching these two manly men choose to become brothers. Caan was also known to employ some dark humor during the production. He shared on the DVD\\u2019s commentary track that he once said on set, \\u201cHold my cigarette and my can of Coke, I have to go die.\\u201d\", \"Odd that a feast centered on flesh and knives hasn\\u2019t inspired a flood of slasher flicks beyond Eli Roth\\u2019s short parody trailer \\u201cThanksgiving,\\u201d part of the 2007 double feature \\u201cGrindhouse.\\u201d Consider that an amuse-bouche to Marcus Dunstan\\u2019s cheeky home invasion horror flick where costumed Mayflower re-enactors teach a modern family to appreciate their blessings. Out with the electric bulbs and cellphones. In with berry-picking, fishing jokes, saltwater taffy, and, for the rebellious teen daughter Cody (Reign Edwards), an ancient witch-torturing device called the cucking stool which the cultlike re-enactors erect over the swimming pool. \\u201cGratitude is on the menu,\\u201d the leader, Ethan (Peter Giles), intones. So is a human head, along with a tureen of gushing blood and several ominous slow-motion shots of buckled hats and shoes designed to leave viewers giggling into their pumpkin pie.\", \"The traditional Thanksgiving children\\u2019s play fell out of favor around the time Wednesday Addams vowed to scalp those pesky pilgrims in \\u201cAddams Family Values\\u201d (1993). No loss. That simplistic history lesson had already been bested by Don Bluth\\u2019s \\u201cAn American Tail,\\u201d the most unsentimental cartoon to ever star a singing mouse. Make that a family of mice \\u2014 the Russian-Jewish Mousekewitzes \\u2014 who flee the feline persecution of their homeland for 1880s New York, where they\\u2019ve been promised mouse holes in every wall, bread crumbs on every floor, and most importantly, no cats. This, of course, is a lie. Young Fievel Mousekewitz is disillusioned to discover that his new country is a predatory land of rat-owned sweatshops and cat-run gangs. Upon the movie\\u2019s release, critics like Roger Ebert were taken aback to see a kiddie flick with a \\u201cbleak view of a cold and heartless universe.\\u201d But wisecracking cockroaches aside, it\\u2019s a true vision of the American dream that idealistic newcomers like Fievel struggled to attain \\u2014 then and now \\u2014 to make the Statue of Liberty live up to her sales pitch.\"]","href_hash":"afc26d434cd511ecac8569489f71b4af"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"afc26d434cd511ecac8569489f71b4af"}},
