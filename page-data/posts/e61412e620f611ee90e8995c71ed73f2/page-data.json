This means that the high levels of activity previously expected are now considered much less likely.\\\"\", \"NOAA also initially predicted high activity for this week and then downgraded their forecast. Solar wind from coronal holes in the sun flow towards Earth and have a magnetic reaction that causes the northern lights, also called the aurora borealis,\\u00a0according to NASA.\\u00a0\", \"Bryan Brasher, a project manager at NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center told CBS News one coronal hole in particular had previously shown elevated activity, so forecasters expected it to do so again.\", \"\\\"As this particular coronal hole rotated back into view \\u2013 meaning we could see and analyze it \\u2013 it was clear that it had diminished and we adjusted our forecast accordingly,\\\" Brasher told CBS News via email.\", \"The scale for measuring these geomagnetic storms is called \\\"the G scale,\\\" ranging from a minor storm at G1 to an extreme storm at G5. The original forecast that garnered media attention was at a G2, but NOAA recently lowered the forecast to a G1 and then lowered it again below the G scale, Brasher said.\", \"Brasher said a G3 or a G4 storm would be needed to see the Northern Lights from mid-latitude states. \\\"We did - for example - have a G4 storm in late March and again in late April that caused the aurora to be visible as far south as Arizona and Oklahoma,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"The best time to see the lights is when the sky is clear and dark, according to the institute. They are more visible closest to the equinox, or the longest days of sunlight in the year occurring in the spring and fall. Auroras usually occur every 27 days, and they come from solar storms.\\u00a0\", \"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has an\\u00a0animated forecast\\u00a0of the lights' movement and says the\\u00a0best time to see them\\u00a0is within an hour or two of midnight, usually between 10 p.m. and 2 a.m. local time.\", \"During average activity, the lights are usually visible in Alaska, Canada, and Scandinavian countries like Greenland and Iceland during average activity and from late February to early April is usually the best time to view them in Alaska.\\u00a0\", \"Caitlin O'Kane is a digital content producer covering trending stories for CBS News and its good news brand, The Uplift.\"]","href_hash":"e61412e620f611ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e61412e620f611ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
