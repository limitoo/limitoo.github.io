Consumer prices soared 7% in 2021, the biggest increase in nearly 40 years.\", \"Wall Street anticipates the first Fed increase in interest rates as early as March, and investors have grown increasingly concerned the Fed will have to raise rates more quickly and more often than the central bank originally indicated.\", \"The Fed's benchmark short-term interest rate is currently in a range of 0% to 0.25%.
