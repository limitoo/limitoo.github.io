survive and reproduce.\", \"In order for SARS-CoV-2 to replicate, it hijacks the machinery of our cells and makes thousands of copies of itself using its own genetic material.\", \"Occasionally, during this replication process, tiny mistakes are made, causing small mutations to be introduced to the virus's genome.\", \"<img

of about 30,000 bases, or letters.(Pixabay:\\u00a0BlenderTimer)</div>\", \"Most of the time, these mistakes are inconsequential, says Jennifer Juno, a senior research fellow at The Doherty Institute.\", \"\\\"But occasionally, those mutations will have an impact,\\\" Dr Juno said.\", \"\\\"They might make the virus a little bit more likely to be transmitted, a bit easier to replicate, or maybe they will help the virus to evade our immune response.\", \"\\\"Those mutations can be transmitted onward and onward, and eventually they'll spread enough that we'll detect that, and that may become a variant of concern.\\\"\", \"The evolution of new variants is driven by the process of natural selection.\", \"The Delta variant, for example, eventually grew to outcompete other COVID variants because it spreads faster and, research suggests, more effectively.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What makes Omicron different?</div>\", \"Omicron is the latest COVID variant of concern to be identified by the World Health Organization (WHO).\", \"\\\"It's interesting because it carries more mutations than the other variants of concern we've seen so far,\\\" Dr Juno said.\", \"When scientists first looked at Omicron's genetic sequence, they found more than 50 mutations, 32 of which are on the all-important spike protein.\", \"Of particular concern is the fact that several of Omicron's mutations have been seen in other variants and are associated with increased transmissibility and the ability to evade immune protection.\", \"<img

variant?</div>\", \"\\\"It's the same basic virus, the same genetic structure, and it's got mostly the same sequence,\\\" Eddie Holmes, a leading viral evolution expert at the University of Sydney, told the Health Report.\", \"\\\"But the spike protein \\u2014\\u00a0the protein that sits on the surface of the virus that interacts with host cells, the one that we use our vaccines to work against \\u2026 that's very, very different.\", \"Of the more than 30 mutations found on the spike protein, 10 are located in the \\\"receptor-binding domain\\\" \\u2014\\u00a0the part that interacts with the body's ACE-2 receptors and mediates the virus's entry into our cells.\", \"\\\"[Omicron] is certainly novel in that respect,\\\" Professor Holmes said.\", \"\\\"The really key question is how well the vaccines will prevent infection [with Omicron] \\u2026 and more importantly, disease.\\\"\", \"While Omicron's changes warrant concern, it's still too early to say how the variant's unusual combination of mutations will behave in large populations.\", \"It's worth remembering that there have been other COVID variants with concerning mutations that have ultimately faded out of the spotlight.\", \"The Beta variant, for example, evolved a strong ability to evade our immune defences, but it proved to be poor at transmitting, and was eventually overrun by Delta.\", \"\\\"It's actually quite hard to predict how each mutation is going to work because it's interacting with a lot of things,\\\" Professor Holmes said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Clues about where Omicron came

\\u2014\\u00a0so where it is derived from \\u2014\\u00a0appears to have existed probably in 2020, so it has not come from Delta, it's actually a separate branch of its evolution.\\\"\", \"Omicron was

and we haven't detected it for many months \\u2014\\u00a0it has kind of gone on silently and then suddenly appeared,\\\" Professor Holmes said.\", \"Earlier this week, health authorities in Europe reported that the variant was present in the Netherlands as early as November 19.\", \"Dr Juno says Omicron's high number of mutations indicate it may have come from a single immunocompromised patient who struggled to beat the virus.\", \"\\\"We know there are cases where people are chronically infected with SARS-CoV-2, so their immune system isn't able to win against the virus very quickly,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Their infection carries on for a long period of time, and when that happens, the virus \\u2014\\u00a0as it replicates within that person \\u2014\\u00a0can accumulate more mutations.\\\"\", \"Instead of the virus being cleared away quickly and effectively, it lingers, evading antibodies and adapting around the body's immune defences.\", \"When the virus eventually infects its next host, it's clocked up a collection of new and potentially dangerous\\u00a0mutations.\", \"A third theory is that Omicron may have emerged through an animal host, Professor Holmes said.\", \"\\\"Maybe the virus got into an animal somewhere \\u2026 it evolved in an animal \\u2014\\u00a0and that explains some of these strange changes \\u2014\\u00a0and then it re-emerged in
