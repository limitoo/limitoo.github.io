The first half of the city \\u2014 the Pudong district \\u2014 went under restrictions on Monday, and it was meant to last there for five days before being lifted and transferred to the Puxi district for four days. \", \"The idea was to minimize disruption in the global hub for finance and trade, which is China's largest and wealthiest city. But that plan has been abandoned. \", \"As of Friday, most of Shanghai was set to remain shut down, including Puxi and a significant part of Pudong, where the restrictions were meant to be lifting. The timeframe was also changed, casting doubt about when life would be back to normal.\", \"Shanghai's modern streets have been transformed into a post-apocalyptic landscape, with police checkpoints manned by workers in hazmat suits and residents barricaded into their homes, allowed out only to get mandatory COVID tests. Even the city's infants are being screened.\", \" Residents can't even go out to walk their dogs, though in some compounds security guards are picking up and walking pets for residents.

How many people have actually died from this recent surge of COVID? The government has told us zero.\\\"\", \"Wrenching stories of residents dying because they're unable to receive care during the lockdown have come to light.
