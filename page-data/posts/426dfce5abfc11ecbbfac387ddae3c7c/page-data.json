Pacific peoples also made up 43 percent of all hospitalisations in the outbreak, this also peaked above 50 percent earlier in the outbreak.\", \"Dr Old said the number of new Covid-19 cases in Pacific peoples had halved for each of the past two weeks and new Pacific hospitalisations due to Covid-19 had also dropped by about 17 percent week-on-week.\", \"He said Pacific health providers had administered more than 100,000 Covid-19 tests within their communities.\", \"\\\"From the outset, the way Pacific providers have worked together to do what was needed with skill, persistence, humility and positivity has been inspiring.\\\"\", \"The Fono chief executive Tevita Funaki said Covid-19 continued to hit Pacific Peoples hard with one of the highest hospitalisation rates due to a high volume of cases. More than 70,000 Pacific people have contracted Covid-19 since August.\", \"Funaki said the collaborative approach between Auckland health providers had been key to administering suitable care and resources to areas where it was needed most.\", \"Funaki said key concerns around Covid-19 amongst many Pacific families included access to basic supplies and employment security. Health workers were trying to contact affected families within 24 hours of a positive test being reported within a household.\", \"Southpoint Family Doctors' Dr Fiona Shepherd said she was proud of the collective effort put in by Pacific health providers during the Auckland outbreak.\", \"She said Pacific health providers' hard work had been rewarding in a time of significant hardship for many communities.\", \"Yesterday, Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said M\\u0101ori had the highest rate of community cases of Covid-19 and while case numbers were dropping, the number of M\\u0101ori in hospital continued to rise. M\\u0101ori have overtaken Pacific people at 28 people per 1000 infected.\"]","href_hash":"426dfce5abfc11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"426dfce5abfc11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
