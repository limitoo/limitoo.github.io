They are strutting across Harvard Yard. And, yes, they are occasionally fanning their feathers and charging at innocent students.\", \"Across the nation, from the riverbanks of the University of Minnesota to the forests of the University of California, Santa Cruz, wild turkeys have gone to college. And they seem to like it. Maybe too much.\", \"Once rare in most of the United States, turkeys became one of the great conservation success stories of the last half-century. But as efforts to expand the bird\\u2019s range flourished across the countryside, the turkeys also trotted into cities, laying down roosts in alleys, parks, backyards and, increasingly, at institutions of higher learning.\", \"\\u201cCollege campuses are just ideal habitat,\\u201d said David Drake, a professor and extension wildlife specialist at the University of Wisconsin, where a sizable flock likes to hang out near apartments for graduate students. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got that intermixing of forested patches with open grassy areas and things like that. Nobody\\u2019s hunting.\\u201d\", \"It is a good life for a big bird. At Minnesota, turkeys chomped on tiny berries near the student union this month and strolled down the sidewalk, unfazed as undergrads traipsed past them. Tom Ritzer, the university\\u2019s assistant director for landcare, said a flock of turkeys, also known as a rafter, sometimes tore up a planting bed and caused damage. But other times, excessive turkey foraging alerts groundskeepers to a grub infestation.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s sort of a blessing and a curse,\\u201d said Mr. Ritzer, a 22-year veteran of the university who said large numbers of turkeys started showing up in the last several years. \\u201cI guess it\\u2019s probably better than coyotes,\\u201d he added.\", \"At many colleges, the turkeys have become minor celebrities. Instagram accounts celebrating the birds have loyal followings at Wisconsin, where they have been photographed on playgrounds and in parking lots, and at Minnesota, where one bird was captured peering plaintively through the window of a Buffalo Wild Wings restaurant just off campus.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s like our campus pet almost,\\u201d said Amanda Ichel, who along with her classmate Paige Robinson runs the @turkeysofumn Instagram page. Most of the photos they post are submitted by fellow students, but only the best make the cut.\", \"\\u201cWe have dozens of direct messages of pictures and videos that we haven\\u2019t posted yet,\\u201d said Ms. Robinson, a sophomore who said she saw turkeys only in zoos when growing up on Long Island and was entranced when they seemed to be turning up everywhere in Minneapolis.\", \"Coexisting with collegiate poultry is not always easy. At California Polytechnic State University, the campus Police Department is occasionally called about turkeys chasing people. At the University of Michigan, a state wildlife officer killed a well-known turkey two years ago that was said to be harassing bikers and joggers. And at Wisconsin, Dr. Drake said at least a couple of aggressive toms were culled after repeatedly frightening students.\", \"Even for fans of the turkeys, getting chased can be fearsome.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s an element of humor, because, oh, it\\u2019s a turkey,\\u201d said Audrey Evans, a doctoral student at Wisconsin who runs @turkeys_of_uw_madison on Instagram. \\u201cBut your fight-or-flight instinct kicks in.\\u201d\", \"Whether turkeys prefer campus life to other urban settings is a matter of some debate.\", \"Richard Pollack, who keeps an eye on the birds at Harvard, said turkeys regularly held up traffic in the streets around campus and have been known to peck at the hubcaps of cars. Once, he said, a turkey made its way into an academic building through an open door before strutting back out without incident.\", \"But turkeys seem to be everywhere in Cambridge, Mass., home to Harvard, and Dr. Pollack said the birds might be even more ubiquitous off campus.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know if turkeys are necessarily any more abundant or if they frequent campuses more than they do other areas,\\u201d said Dr. Pollack, the university\\u2019s senior environmental public health officer. But because of the wide-open areas and heavy foot traffic, he said, \\u201cpeople are more prone to see them\\u201d on campus.\", \"They certainly do see them. At Sacramento State, an opinion writer at the student newspaper once wrote a column urging acceptance of the birds. At Fairfield University in Connecticut, where a dormant Twitter account once chronicled the campus rafter, the birds are a point of pride. And at Lane Community College in Oregon, there is an official campus policy on turkeys, namely that \\u201cthere shall be no intentional or unintentional feeding\\u201d of them.\", \"There is little formal study of college turkeys, but on campus after campus, there is widespread agreement that their numbers have exploded in the last decade or so.\", \"Alex Jones, who manages the Campus Natural Reserve at California, Santa Cruz, said he never saw a turkey as a student there in the 1990s. Now they are everywhere, sometimes in groups of dozens: outside dining halls, on the branches of redwood trees and, quite often, in streets blocking traffic.\", \"\\u201cThe funniest thing to me is that they\\u2019ll take the crosswalk sometimes,\\u201d Mr. Jones said.\", \"It makes sense that the turkeys feel at home, Mr. Jones said. The Santa Cruz campus includes large wooded areas and grasslands and it borders state forests. The absence of hunters probably also helps.\", \"At Harvard, Dr. Pollack said he, too, understood why the birds kept coming back, even though building managers have been known to complain about the prodigious amount of droppings they leave behind.\", \"\\u201cIf I was a turkey, I\\u2019d probably find the courtyards and the massive Harvard Yard itself to be a really great place,\\u201d Dr. Pollack said. \\u201cLots of food. Lots of things to see.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ee08bc884dc911ec8e560d1fcabea0c4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ee08bc884dc911ec8e560d1fcabea0c4"}},
