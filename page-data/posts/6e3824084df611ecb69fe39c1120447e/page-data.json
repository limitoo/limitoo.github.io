I was one of those people until just recently.\", \"The good news, however, is that a single email changed that and can do the same for you, just in time for what is traditionally one of the biggest giving days of the year.\", \"In late August, I started an online fundraiser for the American Cancer Society, using\\u00a0GoFundMe. I did it in honor of what would've been my late father's 75th birthday. He died in October 2020 after a multiyear battle with cancer, and I couldn't think of a better way to honor him than to raise funds to help wipe cancer off the face of the earth.\", \"Once the fundraiser page was live, I began reaching out to folks: first family and then friends, colleagues, social media connections and even my employer, LendingTree. I wasn't shy about it. \\u00a0\", \"I vaguely remembered hearing something during my three years with the company about LendingTree matching employees' charitable donations, but I wasn't certain, so I sent an email to a colleague.\", \"Later that day, I got a response: Yes, the company matches up to $1,500 in cash donations or volunteer hours per employee, per year.\", \"That was an eye-opener for me.\", \"It made me want to find out more about these programs and share what people needed to know about them. After all, if I didn't know about my company's policy, it seemed likely that most people didn't know about their company's policy either, meaning that lots of money was being left on the table. That is absolutely the case.\", \"Countless companies have donation-matching programs. The idea reportedly dates to 1954, when General Electric created the first matching donations program. Today, these programs are common.\", \"According to DoubleTheDonation, which works with companies to help maximize their programs, 65% of Fortune 500 companies offer matching-donation programs \\u2013 from Disney to Apple to American Express \\u2014 and more than 18 million people work for companies of all sizes that have these programs.\\u00a0\", \"Companies such as DoubleTheDonation or BrightFunds offer tools to help companies streamline the donation process for employees, whether you're looking to create your own fundraiser, set up a recurring donation or request a match for a recent donation you've made.\", \"However, many employees never take advantage of these programs. According to DoubleTheDonation, while $2 billion to $3 billion is donated through matching programs annually, anywhere from $4 billion to $7 billion in matching donation funds goes unclaimed every year.\", \"That is a staggering amount of money being left on the table. An additional $7 billion in the hands of charities around the country could have a seismic impact. It could change the world for the better in incalculable ways.\", \"But how can we change it? How do you unleash those billions of dollars?\", \"Job No. 1 is to increase awareness:\", \"The more people who know about these programs, the more they will be utilized. The more they're utilized, the more money will into the hands of charities. And the more money charities have, the more good they can do.\", \"And ultimately, that's what it's all about.\", \"While it's great to be excited about helping a worthy charity, there are some important things to know before you donate. As with any financial transaction, rushing into a donation without doing your homework can lead to regret.\", \"Here are a few tips for using your company's donation matching program:\", \"Matt Schulz is Chief Credit Analyst at LendingTree.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"6e3824084df611ecb69fe39c1120447e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6e3824084df611ecb69fe39c1120447e"}},
