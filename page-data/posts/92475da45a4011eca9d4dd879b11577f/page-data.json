Mr. Day said that other residential buildings in the area had also been damaged. \\u201cIt\\u2019s just really heartbreaking,\\u201d he said.\", \"Gov. Asa Hutchinson of Arkansas said that reports from emergency management officials indicated that a tornado had also struck in Mississippi County. \\u201cFirst responders are on the scene,\\u201d Mr. Hutchinson wrote on Twitter.\", \"Local news reports showed that the roof of an Amazon warehouse had collapsed in Edwardsville, Ill., drawing police officers and emergency workers.\", \"Herbert Simmons, the director of the St. Clair County Emergency Management Agency, said local officials were responding to an \\u201cactive scene\\u201d at the warehouse. \\u201cRight now, our concern is trying to get people who are trapped,\\u201d he said, adding that he was not sure how many people might be in the building.\", \"The damage in Arkansas came after a severe thunderstorm produced a tornado that was tearing through the region, according to the National Weather Service. As of 9:17 p.m. local time, the storm was near Trumann, Ark., and moving northeast at 55 miles per hour, bringing with it a tornado and quarter-sized hail, the Weather Service said.\", \"On Friday night, the Weather Service had issued a tornado warning for several counties in eastern Arkansas and southeastern Missouri.\", \"\\u201cThis is what we would call a tornado outbreak, where you have a storm system which produces a number of tornadoes over a large geographical area,\\u201d Dan Pydynowski, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather, said on Friday.\", \"But such a large and powerful system in December is highly unusual, and something the region usually sees in May or April.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s certainly not unheard-of,\\u201d he said of tornadoes this late in the year, \\u201cbut to have an outbreak of this magnitude, with this many tornado reports \\u2014 it\\u2019s a little unusual for this time of year.\\u201d\", \"Temperatures in Arkansas and Kansas today were \\u201cspring weather,\\u201d Mr. Pydynowski said. Highs were in the 70s and 80s. \\u201cIt was unusually warm, and there was moisture in place. And you had a strong cold front end. These are the ingredients for big storms in the spring, but not in mid-December,\\u201d he said.\", \"Tornado warnings are in place overnight, as the storm system shifts east.\", \"\\u201cCertainty, we\\u2019ll be dealing with more tornadoes as we move into tomorrow and the whole storm system moves forward into Ohio, Eastern Kentucky and eastern Tennessee,\\u201d Mr. Pydynowski added.\"]","href_hash":"92475da45a4011eca9d4dd879b11577f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"92475da45a4011eca9d4dd879b11577f"}},
