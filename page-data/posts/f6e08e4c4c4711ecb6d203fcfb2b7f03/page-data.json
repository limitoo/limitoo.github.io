Standing properly \\u2014 and improving posture in general \\u2014 can help prevent back pain, which persistently afflicts some 16 million American adults, according to data published by Georgetown University. \\u201cYou might see people, as they grow older, they start to bend over, with the spine collapsing, and they\\u2019re staring at the ground while they\\u2019re walking \\u2014 they can\\u2019t stand upright anymore,\\u201d Murphy says. Plant your feet about hip distance apart; the weight on each foot should feel the same. Establish equilibrium by spreading the pinkie toe as far away from the big toe as possible. \\u201cYou can feel how weight might shift a little bit from the inside of your foot, to the outside, the front to the back,\\u201d says Murphy, who considers standing pose to be central in most of the classes he teaches. Next, bring your feet together so your big toes and heels touch. This action forces your muscles to engage in balancing you.\", \"Press your heels against the floor, and work your way up, tightening the muscles. \\u201cGet some grip coming up to your knees and thighs and buttocks to have a firmness take place in your legs,\\u201d Murphy says. Once the legs are engaged, align the upper half of the body by lifting spine, rib cage and chest. Take a deep breath as you straighten your backbone. \\u201cUse the whole circumference of your chest and around your heart and your lungs \\u2014 use that whole rib cage to lift up,\\u201d Murphy says, \\u201cso that you\\u2019re creating space in your trunk, including the spine and also around the organs.\\u201d\", \"Learning to stand correctly is more than just a physical action. \\u201cWe learn to stand to handle what\\u2019s going to come in life, to stand on our own two feet and face whatever comes in front of us with our head up,\\u201d Murphy says. \\u201cAnd when we\\u2019re depressed, when we\\u2019re down, we get pulled down.\\u201d Once you can stand with mastery, he says, \\u201cthe possibilities are endless because you can go forward, you can go backward. You can go side to side, you can go upside down.\\u201d\", \"\"]","href_hash":"f6e08e4c4c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f6e08e4c4c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}},
