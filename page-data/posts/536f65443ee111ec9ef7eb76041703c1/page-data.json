Or at least when life seemed like it maybe could become good again. It was that halcyon window of summer \\u2014 after vaccine second doses but before \\u201cbreakthrough\\u201d and \\u201cDelta variant\\u201d had fully entered the lexicon.\", \"Remember? When gathering on streets and in warehouses and at bars seemed like it was permissible, maybe even emotionally healthy? When, as this publication put it, \\u201cNew York Felt Alive Again\\u201d? Oh, how young we were 20 weeks ago.\", \"Vaccine optimism led to celebrations; celebrations led to gatherings; and gatherings led to a bunch of us getting summer colds (not to be confused with what later was identified as the Delta variant surge in the United States).\", \"Of course, nobody likes to get a cold.\", \"Well, actually, that\\u2019s not entirely true: I did come across some online forums devoted to coughing and sneezing filled with people who seem to like cold symptoms. Like, they really like them.\", \"Still, I think it\\u2019s fair to say that the vast majority of people don\\u2019t like to get a cold.\", \"It wasn\\u2019t just that we had forgotten what colds felt like. Science supported the fact that some of the colds going around this past summer really were worse.\", \"There was talk of the \\u201cgay cold,\\u201d as some of us in the community called it, following L.G.B.T.Q. Pride celebrations in June. \", \"Dr. Andrew Goodman, the site medical director for Manhattan\\u2019s Callen-Lorde Community Health Center, which specializes in L.G.B.T.Q. health care, said that he did notice an uptick in upper respiratory infections among his patients this summer. Many were returning from gay party destinations like Fire Island and Provincetown, he said.\", \"But he emphasized that, from a medical point of view, this wasn\\u2019t shocking.\", \"\\u201cPeople were getting together and partying, and for 18 months we stayed apart,\\u201d Dr. Goodman said in a Zoom interview. \\u201cAnd so, now, these bugs are getting together and they\\u2019re partying, too.\\u201d\", \"To be fair to all us complainers, having a cold right now is particularly unpleasant. Wearing a mask may help slow the spread of the common cold, but wearing one while sick is, scientifically speaking, gross.\", \"As the comedian Guy Branum joked on Twitter in October: \\u201cI full sneezed in a mask and it did its job, but at what cost?\\u201d\", \"But sometimes worse than stewing in your own juices (sorry) is the reaction cold symptoms can provoke in other people.\", \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that most adults in the United States contract two or three colds each year. But even though the common cold is (again, sorry) common, the coronavirus pandemic has amplified anxieties about communicable diseases.\", \"People with colds right now have experienced a variety of blowback for coughing or sneezing in public. And it\\u2019s not always just dirty looks from strangers on the subway.\", \"Carlie Guadagnolo-Edwards, who works in sales at a television station in Sacramento, was at a doctor\\u2019s appointment on Tuesday for a problem with her wrist. She also had a cold, which did not go over well with the doctor\\u2019s receptionist.\", \"\\u201cThe amount of suspicion that I was treated with when I had the audacity to sneeze, you\\u2019d think I had insulted the receptionist\\u2019s mother to her face,\\u201d Ms. Guadagnolo-Edwards, 27, said in a phone interview.\", \"She explained that she was fully vaccinated and that she was particularly careful about masking and socially distancing since her husband is immunocompromised, but the receptionist still kept her distance, physically and socially. Ultimately, the appointment happened as planned.\", \"According to Luna Dolezal, an associate professor of philosophy who studies the impact of shame in medicine at the University of Exeter in Britain, a situation like the one Ms. Guadagnolo-Edwards experienced is far from uncommon.\", \"Professor Dolezal said in a Zoom interview that there is a power imbalance inherent in a medical appointment that could induce shame, but also \\u201cthe stigma has become just so widespread that coughing signifies something so much more than it used to.\\u201d\", \"Be warned. According to Professor Dolezal\\u2019s research, feeling ashamed about a medical condition can exacerbate health problems and discourage some patients from seeking treatment.\", \"But of course, none of us, including Professor Dolezal, is immune (again, so sorry) to judging or being judged.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve had a cold the last two weeks and every time I cough I feel compelled to say \\u2018Don\\u2019t worry, I\\u2019ve had a P.C.R. test,\\u2019\\u201d she said.\", \"To put it reductively, if you get sick right now, you may feel shame or be shamed. It\\u2019s a grim prognosis.\", \"The good news is, if someone gives you a hard time for a cough or a sneeze, at least you can feel good about kvetching to your friends. There is some research that shows griping and joking can increase bonding and group identification.\", \"Lots of us will get colds and colds feel bad. Lots of us will feel guilty about having those colds \\u2014 indicators we may have socialized without enough distance \\u2014 and that will make us feel worse. But at least we\\u2019ll have lots of people around us who we can feel bad with together.\"]","href_hash":"536f65443ee111ec9ef7eb76041703c1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"536f65443ee111ec9ef7eb76041703c1"}},
