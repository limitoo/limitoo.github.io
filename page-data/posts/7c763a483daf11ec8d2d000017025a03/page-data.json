The decision from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals' three-judge panel upheld a judge's earlier ruling in favor of St. Michael's Media Inc.\", \"Cal Harris, a spokesperson for Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott, voiced disappointment over the court's ruling. He said that city officials \\\"remain concerned about the potential public safety threat to Baltimore City property posed by the rally,\\\" which is scheduled to take place November 16.\", \"\\\"Protecting Baltimore residents and their property is our top priority, however, we will abide by the direction of the courts,\\\" Harris said in a statement.\", \"St. Michael's Media successfully signed a contract with a city vendor Thursday, hours after the appeals court announced its decision, according to the media outlet's attorney, Marc Randazza.\", \"\\\"Baltimore hopefully learned a lesson in First Amendment law that its taxpayers now have to pay for,\\\" Randazza told the AP.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926543/catholic-media-wins-case.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A federal appeals court has upheld a judge\\u2019s ruling that Baltimore city officials cannot ban a conservative Roman Catholic media outlet from holding a rally at a city-owned pavilion during a U.S. bishops\\u2019 meeting.

City attorneys noted that Yiannopoulos' speaking engagements have attracted counterprotesters and led to violence and property damage, while Bannon \\\"regularly calls for violence against government officials.\\\"\", \"The 4th Circuit panel didn't explain its decision to uphold U.S. District Judge Ellen Hollander's October 12 ruling that St. Michael's, also known as Church Militant, is likely to succeed on its claims that the city discriminated against it on the basis of its political views and violated its First Amendment free speech rights.\", \"Hollander said city officials could not prohibit the pavilion's manager from contracting with St. Michael's, but she refused to set any court-ordered contractual terms.\", \"The waterfront pavilion is across from a hotel where the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops is scheduled to hold its national meeting from November 15 to November 18. St. Michael's said it deliberately picked the date and location for its rally to coincide with the bishops' meeting. The group also said it held a peaceful, city-permitted rally at the same site during the bishops' national meeting in 2018.\", \"In 2017, a confidant of Pope Francis specifically mentioned ChurchMilitant.com in an article condemning the way some American evangelicals and Roman Catholics mix religion and politics.
