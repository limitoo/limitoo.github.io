Instead of trying to perfectly imitate meat (a fairly pointless quest, in my opinion), he used a wide range of vegetables and grains for a more complex, satisfying texture \\u2014 different levels of chew, tenderness, and some crisp edges in each bite.\", \"I was thinking about this when I tried Kay Chun\\u2019s Swedish vegetarian meatballs, made with canned chickpeas, mushrooms and bulgur wheat. Straight out of the oven, I simmered them in some mushroom gravy and served them on mashed potatoes, with a little ripe persimmon I\\u2019d cooked with vinegar.\", \"And what\\u2019s really cool about a meatball base is that when you find one you love, you can make it again and again, but season it differently each time, depending on your mood.\", \"But if meatballs sound a little too ambitious today, here are some quicker, one-pot ideas: Hetty McKinnon\\u2019s leek and mushroom pasta technique is super smart \\u2014 the pasta cooks directly in vegetable stock, releasing its starch to form a creamy sauce. And Sarah Copeland\\u2019s soba with sweet and spicy tofu comes together in just half an hour. You can play around with the vegetables, customizing according to your taste and what\\u2019s available right now.\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"Go to the recipe.\", \"If you\\u2019re starting to think about Thanksgiving, I wanted to direct you to some really good vegetarian and vegan recipes, including a stunning mushroom Wellington. There\\u2019s also a recipe for vegan mashed potatoes made with Yukon Golds, which get a silky texture thanks to plenty of olive oil, and some particularly delicious roasted carrots finished with yaji \\u2014 both of which would be just as delicious with some crispy baked meatballs, if you\\u2019re not ready to think about Thanksgiving yet!\", \"Thanks very much for reading The Veggie and see you next week.
