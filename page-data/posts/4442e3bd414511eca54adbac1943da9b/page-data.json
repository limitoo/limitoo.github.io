They were together for decades, but she was never beloved by the three stepchildren, and she never had children of her own. A person she considers a \\u201cnephew\\u201d lives in the same city we do and encouraged her to move to be near him. She couldn\\u2019t stay in her home alone as she was showing mild signs of dementia, and there was evidence, such as unpaid bills, that she was not managing her affairs well. We assisted her in moving across the country, and she is residing in a very nice senior community. We manage her finances and health care and visit a few times a month. The \\u201cnephew\\u201d does visit her, but nothing more, and has asked for financial support a few times since she moved. She is not an easy person in some regards; for example, she broods about perceived slights and then wants to change her will to cut out the person she feels slighted her (this is a chronic issue). My question is, what are our ongoing obligations, if any, to this person? Name Withheld\", \"Our popular lore is filled with unkind stereotypes about mothers-in-law and stepmothers. (Maybe fathers-in-law and stepfathers get an easier ride because they\\u2019re more likely to be seen \\u2014 in this realm of stock characters \\u2014 as simply checked out?) You\\u2019re writing about a person who, with respect to you and your husband, plays both roles. In reality, relationships don\\u2019t reliably adhere to a template. Sometimes things just click; sometimes intimacy develops over time. But life isn\\u2019t always allergic to clich\\u00e9, so here we are.\", \"When you provide people with ongoing assistance, you tend to assume ongoing obligations. In ways I\\u2019ve discussed before, when a helping hand is dependably there, it\\u2019s only reasonable that we come to depend on it. And so your stepmother-in-law now has a legitimate expectation that she can rely on you to manage her finances and her health care arrangements; she probably also expects that you\\u2019ll continue to spend time with her. These are responsibilities that have accrued to you because of what you\\u2019ve done for her; they no longer have much to do with the fact that she was married to your father-in-law.\", \"Your letter suggests that her vexing behavior, perhaps especially recently, has been trying your patience. (Personality changes can develop along with dementia, and her unpleasant responses may be growing more frequent.) You\\u2019re clearly not happy about how she uses her will as an instrument in her relationships, including, I\\u2019m guessing, her relationship with you. And you\\u2019re not happy either that she has favored the \\u201cnephew\\u201d \\u2014 possibly even financially \\u2014 in ways that suggest she doesn\\u2019t appreciate how much more you and your husband do for her than he does. If thankless children are sharper than a serpent\\u2019s tooth, as King Lear thought, our skin can be punctured, too, by ungrateful parents.\", \"Because your existing help for her has created a dependency, though, you can\\u2019t just stop looking after her interests. That includes making sure that the \\u201cnephew\\u201d isn\\u2019t exploiting her. But here you should be attentive to what\\u2019s motivating you. He may, after all, be a genuine source of comfort and interest in her life, and it\\u2019s not unnatural for her to want to express her appreciation of that by helping him out financially. As another Shakespeare character says, \\u201cWhen envy breeds unkind division \\u2014/There comes the ruin, there begins confusion.\\u201d\", \"No doubt plenty of confusion lies ahead, but you can do your best to steer clear of ruin. Dependency is not an irrevocable condition. It\\u2019s just that if you choose to reduce your involvement, you shouldn\\u2019t do so suddenly and without making alternative arrangements. However things work out, you and your husband have plainly been enormously helpful to her, and I hope you\\u2019re able to take some satisfaction in that.\", \"I am currently helping friends with their severely disabled child. The child needs round-the-clock supervision; this is especially challenging during the night, as someone must monitor the child\\u2019s condition at all times. Because of the pandemic and my friends\\u2019 precarious financial situation, they are relying on friends to take a night shift, which used to be covered by a nurse. I am now monitoring the child at night once a week, while other friends or family take other nights.\", \"The night shifts are certainly exhausting, but they are mostly doable for me. I am acutely aware, however, that there is no end in sight. And there is a very limited pool of people prepared to give up a night\\u2019s sleep. But in helping I feel that I have lost a friendship, as our relationship has become so transactional. I feel as if I am no longer seen as a friend but as a health care worker. I want to stop, but how can I when I know the consequences of stopping will be so catastrophic for the family? I know the child is not my responsibility, but I also know there is no one else to fill the void. Name Withheld\", \"Once again, providing ongoing support is a gift you can\\u2019t simply take back. That\\u2019s something to consider when you offer help in circumstances like these. You\\u2019re entering into a commitment, even if you don\\u2019t explicitly make a commitment. You say you know their child is not your responsibility. Yet assisting with the child has now become your responsibility.\", \"It\\u2019s also true that dependency doesn\\u2019t justify ingratitude. Harried as they are, they should be mindful that yours is an act of a devoted friend and respond appropriately. In the meantime, let\\u2019s hope that there is indeed an end in sight; as the pandemic ebbs, they may be able to return to using professional support. If you decide that you don\\u2019t want to see them through this crisis, you should try to help find them an alternative \\u2014 maybe by putting them in touch with organizations, public or private, that could help them look after their child. Most cities have such resources, and your friends may be too preoccupied to do the necessary research.\", \"The rest of us might take a moment to ask ourselves about those whose help we\\u2019ve come to rely upon: Are there people we\\u2019re taking for granted?\", \"I switched medical practices pre-Covid and was assigned to a male practitioner. My first appointment is coming up, and today I learned from a friend who also uses that medical practice that my doctor has transitioned (or is transitioning) from male to female. Since I have not yet met this doctor, I am wondering about what is appropriate and whether there should be any conversation about the transition. Is there any reason that the doctor should speak about it, even if it is to determine whether I, a cis woman, am comfortable seeing a trans physician?\", \"If my friend was not a patient at this practice and had not forewarned me, I would have been confused to see a female enter the exam room, because I would have been expecting a male doctor. Is this transition process such a private thing that it is inappropriate to talk about it? Obviously, I am in uncharted waters.\", \"Name Withheld\", \"Your new doctor is negotiating a difficult phase of a trans life, which is handling changes in relationships with people the trans person knew when presenting as another gender. You\\u2019re someone she hasn\\u2019t yet met, and so you will meet her first as a woman. Indeed, it may not have occurred to her that you signed up with her when she was presenting otherwise. She no doubt has already had to deal with questions from patients she knew when she was presenting as male, and I\\u2019m sure that it hasn\\u2019t always been fun. You can play a small part in our important social transition from transphobia toward trans acceptance by sparing her from having to answer such questions for the umpteenth time. It\\u2019s no more incumbent on her to inquire after your comfort level with her identity than it would be for a physician who is Jewish or gay or Black (or all three) to do so. Her gender expression has no bearing on her capacities as a doctor.\", \"Let her decide if she wants to say something. She has the same professional competence as the doctor you signed up for, because she is the doctor you signed up for. She has simply decided that she\\u2019s ready to live as the woman she really is.\"]","href_hash":"4442e3bd414511eca54adbac1943da9b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4442e3bd414511eca54adbac1943da9b"}},
