The renovation also substituted painted-plaster walls for much of the house\\u2019s original dark polished lava terrazzo, and replaced traditional wood shingles with more durable modern asphalt ones, he said.\", \"Large traditional joglo doors open to the open-plan second story of the main building, where the two pavilions hover just below the ceiling skylights. One pavilion is suspended over the open kitchen; the other is over the living area, where a teal piano is showcased. The custom furniture is included in the asking price, Mr. Hirte said.\", \"Ironwood and teak wood are found throughout the villa, including the reclaimed wood floors and \\u201csome wooden beams from a shipwreck of a Dutch vessel,\\u201d Mr. Hirte said.\", \"The custom kitchen has a large island, teak cabinets and glass shelves. Floors are polished concrete tiles. Also on the second floor are a bathroom, pantry, storage and mechanical room. Stairs descend to the first floor, which has two bedrooms with bathrooms. The bedrooms open to a curved iron wood deck overlooking the creek and jungle.\", \"From the second floor, a staircase ascends to a glass-and-steel \\u201cfloating\\u201d mezzanine level, with a walkway and two sitting areas. The mezzanine opens to the pool deck, which consists of ceramic tiles and volcanic lava stone. The exaggerated eaves of the villa\\u2019s two buildings, which are connected by canvas, shelter much of the deck. The 41-by-10-foot pool is tiled in a type of quartzite called Bali green stone.\", \"The separate building, with a bedroom suite and bathroom, is accessed from the deck. The property also has a large moss-covered brick pizza oven.\", \"Jungle and gardens of palm trees, frangipani, aloe vera, papaya and jackfruit trees surround the villa, which is one of 10 homes in this gated community promoted as the brainchild of \\u201cvisionaries, artists, musicians, surfers, yogis and socially conscious entrepreneurs.\\u201d The community offers communal gardens, parking, security and maintenance services.\", \"Mas, renowned for its traditional wood carvers, is about 12 miles north of Denpasar, Bali\\u2019s capital. Ubud, a collection of inland villages known for its spiritualists and expatriate artists, and which served as the setting for the 2006 best-selling book \\u201cEat, Pray, Love,\\u201d is a few miles north. The closest airport is Ngurah Rai International Airport, about 20 miles southwest.\", \"The Indonesian province of Bali, with roughly 4.3 million residents on a principal island and several smaller islands, has seen its real estate market rally through various international and regional crises in recent decades, but the global pandemic has been a blow, gutting tourism, particularly in areas like Ubud, local agents said.\", \"Indonesia, the world\\u2019s 14th largest country by area, comprising more than 17,000 islands, has an incredibly diverse property market, with limited statistical data, agents said. One oft-used source, the Knight Frank Prime International Residential Index, showed a 1.2 percent dip in luxury residential prices for 2020 in Jakarta, Indonesia\\u2019s capital, on the island of Java, about 720 miles west of Bali.\", \"\\u201cTruth be told, there\\u2019s a real lack of transparency and a deep lack of access to information that would show record-keeping,\\u201d said Jared Collins, a senior adviser and Bali property consultant at Ubud Homes. \\u201cBut I can say it\\u2019s been on a two-year decline in terms of a customer base in this area.\\u201d\", \"Ubud, an administrative district known as the center of Balinese art and culture, has developed rapidly in the past 15 years as an international destination, with spas and resorts for tourists, and multimillion-dollar homes for expatriates and investors. Much of that activity ground to a halt when travel restrictions were imposed in the spring of 2020, Mr. Collins said. According to the Central Statistics Bureau of Bali, only 45 international visitors entered the province during the first 10 months of 2021.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s dire,\\u201d Mr. Collins said. \\u201cSomething has to change, or the hotels are toast, and the restaurants are on life support.\\u201d\", \"Indonesian buyers have been sustaining the housing market in the Ubud area, he said, while the few remaining foreign buyers have gravitated toward other parts of Bali, like Canggu, a beach area west of the capital, and Uluwatu, a surfing destination on the Bukit Peninsula, south of Denpasar.\", \"Canggu and other southern communities were among the areas seeing annual home price increases of 20 to 30 percent or more before the pandemic, and they continue to thrive, though reliable data is sparse, said Amadeus F\\u00f6rster, a co-founder of Bali Real Estate Consultants.\", \"\\u201cWith no surprise, everyone who could afford relocating and working remotely would leave the cities, i.e. Jakarta, and trade the lockdown apartment life with an open Bali villa lifestyle,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPrices in the cities have decreased versus increasing prices in Bali.\\u201d\", \"Terje H. Nilsen, the director of Seven Stones Indonesia, a company that handles market-entry services for expatriates, agreed that some areas of Bali have likely seen home prices increase. \\u201cCanggu and nearby Pererenan have seen prices go up, as these areas are where the largest expat community has been during Covid, as well as therefore attracting those coming in and local buyers as well,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Nilsen said there have been price decreases in longterm leased properties, which are available to foreigners, versus freehold properties, which are largely limited to Indonesian buyers. And while areas like Canggu and Pererenan may have seen prices grow, home prices overall on Bali may have gone down between 10 to 20 percent. \\u201cThere have been a few fire sales due to owners struggling financially, but most are waiting and expect Bali to recover V-shaped once we come out of Covid,\\u201d he said.\", \"Currently, in desirable areas like Canggu, the sweet spot for homes is about $300,000 to $500,000, which can buy an attractive two- to four-bedroom villa, Mr. Nilsen said.\", \"Mr. Collins said the average client in Ubud wants to spend $100,000 to $300,000 for a home, which captures about 75 percent of the market. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t really get a true Western-standard house in a nice area, maximum 10 to 12 minutes outside of Ubud center, for less than about $200,000, and then it goes all the way up to $2 million,\\u201d he said.\", \"Foreigners live in many parts of Indonesia, including Jakarta and the islands of Flores and Lombok, which have grown increasingly popular. But Bali attracts the bulk of the nation\\u2019s tourism, which tends to drive the island\\u2019s housing market, agents said.\", \"Before the pandemic, foreigners accounted for as many as half the transactions in Ubud, Mr. Nilsen said. Most were Australian, followed by British, French and other European buyers. The number of American buyers has continued to grow over the years, he said.\", \"Mr. Collins said he handles mostly American and Canadian buyers; Italian, German, French, Swedish and other European buyers; and Australian, Russian and Japanese buyers.\", \"With a few exceptions, only Indonesian nationals are entitled to an outright land ownership title, known as Hak Milik, also referred to as \\u201cfreehold.\\u201d However, foreign nationals do have some rights pertaining to property, including the right to use (Hak Pakai) and right to build (Hak Guna Bangunan), agents said.\", \"There are two common legal land-use arrangements, Mr. Collins said. The first is done through notarial agreement between a private landowner and a foreigner, and typically involves a 20- to 30-year land lease. In the second, the land title is converted into a government-granted right to use, typically for a 70-year period. Both scenarios have provisions for renewals, Mr. Collins said.\", \"He added that a lawyer is not necessary, as long as buyers have \\u201ca well-vetted agent and an Indonesian notary.\\u201d\", \"The notary fee is usually about 1 percent of the transaction value, Mr. Nilsen said. For a freehold sale, he said, the government tax is 2.5 percent for the seller and 5 percent for the buyer, based on the property\\u2019s tax value.\", \"For a leasehold transaction, the seller is responsible for a 10 percent government tax based on the transaction value, though in some cases the buyer and seller may split the tax, Mr. Collins said.\", \"Foreigners cannot obtain a mortgage from Indonesian banks \\u201cunless they have had a working permit and visa for five consecutive years, residing in Indonesia,\\u201d Mr. F\\u00f6rster said.\", \"Indonesian; Indonesian rupiah (1 rupiah = $0.00007)\", \"Annual property taxes, which typically amount to about 0.5 percent of the estimated land value, are negligible on this property, Mr. Hirte said.\", \"Marc Hirte, Bali Real Estate Consultants, 011-62-877-613-119-41, balirealestateconsultants.com\"]","href_hash":"122480ec68b511ec8c3a497b15f70c70"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"122480ec68b511ec8c3a497b15f70c70"}},
