Gen. Thomas H. Mancino, announced on behalf of the governor, Kevin Stitt, that guardsmen in the state would not be required to get the Covid-19 vaccine, defying a Pentagon directive issued in August that makes\\u00a0vaccinations mandatory\\u00a0for all troops, including the National Guard, by deadlines set by each service branch.\", \"\\u201cThe order I issued came directly from the governor. That is the lawful order to the men and women of the Oklahoma National Guard,\\u201d General Mancino said in an interview, adding that he had been vaccinated.\", \"Pentagon officials said Wednesday that a failure to follow \\u201cvalid medical readiness requirements\\u201d could \\u201cjeopardize\\u201d the status of troops.\", \"The officials insist that Mr. Stitt has no legal standing to obviate the mandate, though experts on the obscure laws governing the Guard disagree. They note that unless federally deployed, National Guard members are under the jurisdiction of the governor of their state and therefore not subject to federal mandates. \\u201cGuard members can only serve one boss at a time,\\u201d said John Goheen, a spokesman for the National Guard Association of the United States.\", \"The Pentagon is not without redress. It could deny funding to state units or impede the promotions of Guard members who refuse to get vaccinated. Officials said Wednesday that Guard members who refused to be vaccinated also could face dismissal, just as with active duty troops.\", \"\\u201cOklahoma may be able to take this step as a legal matter, but there are definitely things the federal government can do in response that might make it a painful Pyrrhic victory,\\u201d said Eugene Fidell, an adjunct professor of law at the New York University Law School. \\u201cThe governor and state adjutant general thus might find themselves commanding some very unhappy personnel.\\u201d\", \"The Pentagon is bracing for other states to follow Oklahoma\\u2019s lead. So far none have, but many are believed to be closely watching the situation, which could become the subject of lawsuits. \\u201cThis could be contagious,\\u201d Mr. Fidell said.\", \"National Guard troops have been caught in the political cross hairs over the years, including in 2018, when several governors said they would withhold or recall their troops from the border with Mexico as the Trump administration separated adults who illegally crossed into the United States from their children. In 1986, several governors balked at sending Guard troops for maneuvers in Honduras ordered by President Ronald Reagan.\", \"But these rare conflicts in the military have never centered on vaccine mandates, which have existed for decades. \", \"The standoff, while so far limited in scope, demonstrates the headaches Mr. Biden faces as he pushes the Jan. 4 deadline for large companies to mandate coronavirus vaccinations or start weekly testing of their workers. The new rule, applying to companies with 100 or more employees, would cover roughly 84 million workers, and is already meeting fierce resistance.\", \"Mr. Stitt is one of several Republican state officials who have been resisting Mr. Biden\\u2019s vaccine mandates covering federal employees and contractors.\", \"Some governors who have been more resistant to mandates have so far declined to join Mr. Stitt.\", \"\\u201cI took an oath, and I intend to do what I promised the country I would do,\\u201d General Thomas Carden, the head of the Georgia National Guard, told a local reporter last week. \\u201cIt\\u2019s cut and dry for us.\\u201d\", \"Spokesmen for the Guards in North Dakota and Florida \\u2014 two other states whose governors oppose vaccine mandates \\u2014 said they were following the Pentagon order, while Texas officials were more vague.\", \"\\u201cThe decision whether or not to receive a vaccination is a personal matter each Soldier and Airman must weigh. The Texas National Guard provides the resources necessary for each Service member to make informed decisions,\\u201d an unidentified spokesperson said in response to an email query.\", \"While the vast majority of active duty troops have been vaccinated, the percentage of those in the Guard has dragged below the averages for the civilian population. In Oklahoma, 89 percent of airmen in the Guard have been vaccinated, while only 40 percent of Army guardsmen have had shots.\", \"General Mancino issued his memo a day after Mr. Stitt dismissed his predecessor, Maj. Gen. Michael C. Thompson, a proponent for vaccines. \"]","href_hash":"5b3b55b747d211ecaf0a052f5143c8d0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5b3b55b747d211ecaf0a052f5143c8d0"}},
