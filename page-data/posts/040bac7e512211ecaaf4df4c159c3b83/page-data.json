Zestworld, a new subscription-based platform that is set to be introduced in early 2022, is hoping to change that.\", \"Zestworld will allow comic book writers and artists to present new work and reap the benefits \\u2014 and help monetize their creations if they are made into collectibles or adapted for TV, movies or other media.
