When she matches with her dream guy on the East Coast, Tag (Darren Barnet), she decides on a whim to surprise him for the holidays.\", \"Things take a turn when Natalie discovers she\\u2019s been catfished by Josh (Jimmy O. Yang), Tag\\u2019s childhood friend. To make it up to her, Josh offers to help set her up with Tag.\", \"The film, streaming on Netflix, explores the pitfalls of online dating and how focusing on physical appearance can backfire. It\\u2019s a message reinforced throughout the movie, including with a derisive comment describing \\u201cLove Actually\\u201d as \\u201ca movie about people falling in love based on how they look.\\u201d\", \"Josh, the catfisher, is a refreshing romantic comedy protagonist. He\\u2019s a Chinese American candle-maker living in his family\\u2019s basement whose passions and traumas viewers get to know throughout the film.

We learn that she has an unhealthy attachment to perfection and is stuck in a narrative reinforced by her day job. It is Josh that propels her story forward, and she ends up serving as a prop for his becoming. In presenting a female character who is attractive, but bereft of substance, the movie subverts its own premise.\", \"It brings to mind the observation by bell hooks, in her seminal book \\u201cAll About Love,\\u201d that while women are often the practitioners of love, men get to theorize about it. This idea is reinforced by an interaction between Natalie and her boss. When she asks to take a break from writing about disaster dates and asks instead to write her New York love story, he responds, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to leave the serious stuff to real journalists, like Steve.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"03b81c343e0911ecbc1f000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"03b81c343e0911ecbc1f000017025a03"}},
