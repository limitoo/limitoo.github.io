This time, he said that his committee wanted the records to assess how well the IRS has conducted its Presidential Audit Program. The IRS has a longstanding policy of auditing every president and vice president, according to Politico, but little is publicly known about how the process works.\", \"In short, the committee said it wanted to know how rigorously the IRS audits presidents, especially since Trump differed from past presidents in having vast international business holdings before taking office. Neal's second request sought Trump's tax returns from 2015 to 2020.\", \"Trump asked the court to block the committee's request, arguing that it served no legitimate congressional purpose. Trump argued that the legislative committee only wanted his returns to try to enforce tax laws, something that the legislative branch isn't constitutionally allowed to do.\", \"McFadden rejected all of Trump's arguments.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952089/donald-trump-appointed-judge-irs-tax-returns.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A judge appointed by former President Donald Trump has denied his attempt to keep his IRS tax returns from a congressional investigative committee.

But it is not for this Court to prescribe the most effective vehicle for congressional inquiries.\\\"\", \"Additionally, Trump argued that the committee's request violates the separation of powers that ensures each of the three branches of government don't infringe on the others' abilities to operate without interference.\", \"McFadden pointed out that Trump is no longer president, so completing the committee's request doesn't threaten the president's office any longer.\", \"While McFadden said that the committee could publicly publish Trump's tax returns, he advised against it.\", \"\\\"If Chairman Neal's true interest in the former President's tax returns is indeed to better understand the Presidential Audit Program, he will doubtless be able to accomplish this objective without publishing the returns,\\\" McFadden wrote.\", \"\\\"Public disclosure of another's tax returns is a grave offense,\\\" the judge's decision continued. \\\"Anyone can see that publishing confidential tax information of a political rival is the type of move that will return to plague the inventor.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"f34b4f8f5d5111ecb8c889627db0b4ea"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f34b4f8f5d5111ecb8c889627db0b4ea"}},
