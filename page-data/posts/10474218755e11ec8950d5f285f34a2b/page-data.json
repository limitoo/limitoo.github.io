That would be a just sentence.\\\"\", \"But Adrian said if he were to rule that the sentencing statute he was bound to follow was unconstitutional, his decision would be overturned and Clinton would be ordered to prison. In order to avoid an appeal he believed would be successful, Adrian said what he could do was determine that prosecutors had failed to \\\"prove their case\\\" and dismiss the sexual assault charge.\", \"Clinton's attorney, Drew Schnack, agreed with the ultimate verdict, saying the prosecution did not prove its case and the evidence was not strong enough to warrant a conviction.\", \"The prosecutor in the case, Anita Rodriguez, said she had never in her 40-year career seen anything like Adrian's ruling, and worried how it might affect the victim. The Quincy Area Network Against Domestic Abuse, which helps victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse, said the ruling sends a dangerous message.\", \"On Wednesday, Adrian, apparently angered by the criticism, told another prosecutor appearing before him in an unrelated case to leave his courtroom because the prosecutor had \\\"liked\\\" a comment on Facebook that was critical of the judge.\", \"\\\"I can't be fair with you,\\\" Adrian told the Adams County prosecutor, the\\u00a0Herald-Whig reported. \\\"Get out.\\\"\", \"On Thursday, Adams County State Attorney Gary L. Farha released a statement, saying \\\"there have been multiple questions about the judge's actions in this case and in removing an attorney from the courtroom for a 'like' of a social media post.\\\"\", \"Farha said his office would have no further comment about the judge's situation.\", \"\\\"The Adams County State's Attorney's office is not, nor should it be, the focus of this story,\\\" Farha said. \\\"Rather, the focus and attention should remain on a 16 year old girl enduring a trauma beyond what should be required of anyone and a system that traumatized her and victimized her again. She did nothing to warrant this attack. She is deserving of our support. She is worthy of our respect.\\\"\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"10474218755e11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"10474218755e11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
