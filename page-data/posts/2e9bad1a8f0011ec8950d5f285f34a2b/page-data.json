But it is of course proving to be very challenging for them to get hold of them as well.\\\"\", \"On the steps required for critical businesses to get hold of the tests, Hipkins said the process was to make sure those with the highest levels of needs had access to tests when they needed them.\", \"\\\"In the case of large businesses, for example, some of those large businesses have been getting their stocks of rapid antigen tests in advance to try and smooth that process.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"2e9bad1a8f0011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2e9bad1a8f0011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
