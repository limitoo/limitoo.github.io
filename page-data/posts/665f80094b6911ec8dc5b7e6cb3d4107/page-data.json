man was arrested and charged with assault occasioning bodily harm in a public place whilst adversely affected by an intoxicating substance and public nuisance.\\\"\", \"The man is due to appear in the Moranbah Magistrates Court on December 9.\", \"The ABC understands the medical worker that was assaulted was a GP who was refusing to give the man a COVID-19 vaccination exemption.\", \"<div

her staff have received.\", \"\\\"We've had emails, we've had letters that have been sent in that have been threatening,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"As a business owner\\u00a0I've got to make sure that my doctors and staff are safe, that they're able to go to their car parks at night.\", \"Dr Higgins said the practice was noting details of threatening phone calls and reporting them to police.\",
