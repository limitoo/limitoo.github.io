But it comes with secret gifts of perception.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-23T10:28:53.000Z","content":"[\"In May of 2020, my 95-year-old grandmother came down with pneumonia. If I wanted to say goodbye, I was told, this would be my only chance. I drove down I-80 to Lorain, Ohio, where my grandparents settled in the 1950s, after emigrating from Puerto Rico, and raised 13 children, my father the eighth in line. Nearby family assembled into a small, masked audience. When my sisters and I arrived, a few people were departing. In the clamor of hellos and farewells, I missed being introduced to the man \\u2014 not much taller than me, gray-haired \\u2014 I assumed was a family friend. Afterward, my sister murmured, \\u201cYou ignored Daddy perfectly.\\u201d\", \"With effort, I could find traces of the man my mind summons at the word \\u201cfather.\\u201d The nose, yes, and the manner of walking. The clearer image was of a stranger in a doorway, half-turned away. It\\u2019s been 12 years since I severed contact with my father, after a long history of his abuse. \\u201cWe are estranged,\\u201d I tell people. But I\\u2019d imagined estrangement as the man who stands arms-out to separate two fighters; I never anticipated seeing my father as a stranger would.\", \"Reflecting on this meeting, which happened only in retrospect, I can\\u2019t help thinking that the two meanings of \\u201cestrangement\\u201d converge. Artistic estrangement \\u2014 originally ostranenie, a word coined by the Russian literary theorist Viktor Shklovsky \\u2014 is sometimes translated as \\u201cdefamiliarization.\\u201d A good writer, for example, makes unfamiliar what they depict \\u2014 jealousy, or a tree, or a siren\\u2019s sound \\u2014 to free it from clich\\u00e9s or preconceptions, forcing us to encounter it as if for the first time, though we have probably been jealous, seen a tree, heard a siren. Estrangement revives perception. For Shklovsky, ostranenie occurs when a writer creates \\u201ca special way of experiencing an object, to make one not \\u2018recognize\\u2019 it but \\u2018see\\u2019 it.\\u201d The stakes are high. Life, otherwise \\u201cautomatized,\\u201d can pass as if we are unconscious \\u2014 even as if we never lived at all.\", \"In the Yale lecture hall where I learned about Shklovsky, it was easy to see estrangement stretching beyond art. I thought about the constant shocks of perception, bouts of disorientation, that I \\u2014 child of a diasporic family, poor in a rich institution \\u2014 had experienced. How automatic could life be if it must be continually decoded? If hardly anything is recognizable? If I did see more accurately than those who instinctively belonged, then I wished I didn\\u2019t. At the freshman holiday dinner, I couldn\\u2019t delight in the cornucopias and ice sculptures paraded before us by predominantly Black workers. We gorged ourselves, then left the wreckage for them to remove. The scene did strike me as art: Who wrote this parody of America? But I was powerless to change the picture, in which I saw myself as both inferior and traitor. Estrangement, necessary in art, seemed painful in life; perception and pain were twins.\", \"In 2016, I moved to Poland to study and write poetry on a Fulbright arts fellowship. Doing so required stripping myself of fluency and the cloak of native understanding. With each failure of action or speech, I squelched around in touristic self-pity. \\u201cI live on Smutna Street,\\u201d I told someone, momentarily forgetting \\u201cSmolna\\u201d was my street\\u2019s actual name; her laughter reminded me that smutna means \\u201csad.\\u201d I was often sad during that first, dark autumn, dealing with a disintegrating marriage and the parched loneliness of the unlanguaged. When I read the weather journals of Gerard Manley Hopkins, full of riverine descriptions of cloud architecture, I envied his ebullient noticing, his passionate benevolence toward everything he saw. I started a weather journal, hoping, I wrote, that it \\u201cmight make me love the world more.\\u201d I remained a melancholic American struggling with Polish grammar, but attention did render the world entrancing. Trips to the post office and supermarket became exhilarating; paying attention to the oddities and ironies of even my dullest routines reminded me that I lived, I perceived and I contained a startling range of feelings: humiliation, pain, self-hatred, yes, but also wonder. Wonder that depended on nothing but my own willingness to find it.\", \"Once, in Warsaw, I saw the facade of an abandoned prewar building fall, cleanly, like drapery slipping from a statue. Dust plumed, but no one was injured. Onlookers gathered to watch the rituals of aftermath: trucks sirening up, the clatter of officialdom. From the sidewalk opposite I studied the ordinary rooms estranged by exposure \\u2014 as we all would be if our interiors could be revealed. I was a stranger in this land, but I no longer minded. \\u201cHelp me create ever-enduring love,\\u201d the great Polish poet Czes\\u0142aw Mi\\u0142osz wrote, \\u201cfrom my persistent dissonance with the world.\\u201d\", \"At a party in Brooklyn, after I say something like the above, a woman challenges me: \\u201cBut what is the value of feeling like a stranger if you could learn to belong?\\u201d I say, \\u201cYou never forget there are other strangers.\\u201d If I\\u2019d had more time to think, or been less tipsy, I\\u2019d have added, \\u201cYou never forget that we are all strangers in the world.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cArt is the means to live through the making of the thing,\\u201d Shklovsky writes, and in the margins of the book I see that I\\u2019ve written, \\u201cEstrangement is the means to live through the making of life.\\u201d My grandmother, against expectations, survived. When I return to that image of my father on the threshold, I feel lucky: At least once in my life, I saw him without fear, and I could love him as much as I love any stranger. The picture I hold in my head I hold like a work of art.\"]","href_hash":"f6e08e4a4c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f6e08e4a4c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}},
