She grew up here. \\u201cI plan to work this land,\\u201d she said.\", \"Scientists agree with her grandfather. Much of Brazil\\u2019s vast northeast is, in effect, turning into a desert \\u2014 a process called desertification that is worsening across the planet.\", \"Climate change is one culprit. But local residents, faced with harsh economic realities, have also made short-term decisions to get by \\u2014 like clearing trees for livestock and extracting clay for the region\\u2019s tile industry \\u2014 that have carried long-term consequences.\", \"Desertification is a natural disaster playing out in slow motion in areas that are home to half a billion people, from northern China and North Africa to remote Russia and the American Southwest.\", \"The process does not generally lead to rolling sand dunes that evoke the Sahara. Instead, higher temperatures and less rain combine with deforestation and overfarming to leave the soil parched, lifeless and nearly devoid of nutrients, unable to support crops or even grass to feed livestock.\", \"That has made it one of the major threats to civilization\\u2019s ability to feed itself.\", \"\\u200b\\u200b\\u201cThere is a huge body of evidence that desertification already affects food production and lowers crop yields,\\u201d said Alisher Mirzabaev, an agricultural economist at the University of Bonn in Germany, who helped write a 2019 United Nations report on the topic. \\u201cAnd with climate change, it\\u2019s going to get even worse.\\u201d\", \"Brazil\\u2019s northeast, the world\\u2019s most densely populated drylands, with roughly 53 million people, is among the most at risk. The region is known for droughts and poverty, inspiring novels about destitute field workers forced to abandon the land, as well as a genre of music, Bai\\u00e3o, in which accordion-backed lyrics tell of the difficult life here.\", \"But things are becoming worse. The region had its longest drought on record from 2012 through 2017, and this year, another drought desiccated much of Brazil.\", \"In August, the United Nations\\u2019 latest major report on climate change said Brazil\\u2019s northeast faces rising temperatures, a sharp decline in groundwater, and more frequent and intense droughts. Satellite images and field tests show that 13 percent of the land has already lost its fertility, while nearly the rest of the region is at risk.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s reaching a tipping point,\\u201d said Humberto Barbosa, a top expert on desertification who has studied the Brazilian northeast for years. \\u201cA point of no return.\\u201d\", \"President Jair Bolsonaro has taken no significant measures to reverse the process. Instead, he has pulled back environmental regulations, while empowering miners and ranchers, and overseen a sharp rise in deforestation in the country. That helps feed the cycles of extreme weather. Government data released last month showed Amazon deforestation is at its worst in 15 years.\", \"Increasing deforestation in Brazil has alarmed officials around the world because it threatens the Amazon rain forest\\u2019s ability to pull carbon from the atmosphere. But it is also a primary cause of desertification, robbing the air of moisture and the soil of shade.\", \"In the Serid\\u00f3 region, a collection of dusty towns, family farms and industrial factories, the residents\\u2019 own impact on the land is most clearly illustrated by the rise of the ceramics industry.\", \"In the early 1980s, local businessmen saw an opportunity in the frequent droughts. When reservoirs and rivers evaporated, they exposed the nutrient-rich clay at the bottom, perfect for manufacturing the red roof tiles popular in much of the country.\", \"Those entrepreneurs began paying landowners for their mud, and in a few years, dozens of ceramics plants employed hundreds of people. Parelhas, population 21,000, built a metal arch over the main road into town, announcing it as the \\u201cTile Capital.\\u201d\", \"Adelson Olivera da Costa was a pioneer of the industry, starting as a manager of one of Parelhas\\u2019s first factories in 1980 and buying it a decade later. At his small plant recently, a few dozen laborers laid out thousands of tiles to dry in the midday sun.\", \"\\u201cFor us, the drought is good news,\\u201d Mr. da Costa said in his cramped office. He said he had 30 employees, and neighboring plants run by a son and a daughter employed dozens more.\", \"For an area long dependent on crops and livestock, ceramics were an economic jump start. But in time, the consequences became clear. Factories make the tiles by mixing water with clay, and then firing the result in a wood-burning oven. All those ingredients \\u2014 water, wood and clay \\u2014 are in short supply here.\", \"Mr. da Costa\\u2019s factory, one of the smaller operations in the area, uses more than 2,500 gallons of water a week, pulled from a nearby well. \\u201cPeople aren\\u2019t sure,\\u201d he said of the water, \\u201cbut we think it will never run out.\\u201d\", \"Recent studies estimate, though, that the region\\u2019s groundwater is dwindling.\", \"The factory\\u2019s oven runs all night, Monday to Friday. Just before 5 a.m. one weekday, two men pulled branches and trunks from large piles and stuffed them into six fireplaces that heated an oven the size of a house. The operation consumes 60 to 75 cubic meters of wood a week, or enough to fill five large dump trucks.\", \"Then there is the tiles\\u2019 main ingredient, clay. Years ago, Mr. da Costa said he bought clay from the dried-up lake beds within a few miles of his operation. With those now depleted, he is hauling in mud from hours away.\", \"Aldrin Perez, a Brazilian government scientist who tracks desertification, said it takes 300 years to deposit one centimeter of soil, while ceramics companies take three to five feet of soil each time they extract clay. \\u201cIn seconds, they destroy meters of depth that were formed over millions of years,\\u201d he said.\", \"That can have a devastating effect. The soil and clay they extract is crucial for retaining a proper balance of nutrients and moisture in the surrounding land.\", \"\\u201cIt kills the area,\\u201d said Dami\\u00e3o Santos Ferreira, the manager of Mr. da Costa\\u2019s factory, explaining why some people were hesitant to sell their clay. \\u201cIt\\u2019s never the same.\\u201d\", \"The factory pays landowners about $10 for 30 tons of clay, he said.\", \"By now, most landowners know the consequences. Yet plenty still get desperate enough to sell. One of them was Mr. Dantas.\", \"In 2010, during another difficult dry season, Mr. Dantas said his family almost ran out of money. To feed themselves and their cattle, they decided to cash in on their mud.\", \"\\u201cEveryone agreed,\\u201d Mr. Dantas said. \\u201cIt was necessary,\\u201d his son, Paulo, said.\", \"The clay came from a reservoir Mr. Dantas\\u2019s great-grandfather built in the 19th century to supply water for their 506-acre land. When it evaporated each dry season, the family had planted beans, corn and cotton in the fertile bed left behind. It was one of their most productive plots of land.\", \"But in 2010, instead of planting, the family watched four men with shovels excavate and haul away the soil. It took them three months. They paid about $3,500 for the clay.\", \"The money helped the family survive through the yearslong drought that followed. But the land around the reservoir was left nearly barren. Paulo Dantas planted corn, beans and watermelon several years later, but the produce was so pitiful, they fed it to the cattle.\", \"Then, last year, it rained much more than usual. The reservoir filled to about six feet. Hellena, Mr. Dantas\\u2019s granddaughter, swam in it. When it dried up, the family planted seeds. Grass for the cattle grew, but the beans and corn wilted.\", \"\\u201cI really regret it,\\u201d Mr. Dantas said of selling the clay. \\u201cI saw it wasn\\u2019t good. But the children needed it.\\u201d\", \"Standing on the reservoir\\u2019s embankment, he looked over the parched land as the sun set. \\u201cI had no choice,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"59c8872b541211eca9d999f4b72daefc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"59c8872b541211eca9d999f4b72daefc"}},
