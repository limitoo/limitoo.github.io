These are people who go out and do this for high profit, and for the thrill,\\\" said Ben Dugan, president of the Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail.\", \"The people recruited to perform the thefts are paid $500 to $1,000 to take as much merchandise as they can or steal specific items, and bring it to certain people who then send it to other parts of the country to be resold, the AP reported.\", \"The robberies in San Francisco started around 8 p.m. Friday, when the Union Square Louis Vuitton, Burberry and Bloomingdale's, among other stores, were invaded by people stealing merchandise and running to nearby cars.\", \"The so-called criminal flash mobs are a growing trend designed to look chaotic, but law enforcement officials say they are quite the opposite and can also hide in and around other events.\", \"During the protests across the country and in San Francisco in the summer of 2020 following the murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police, Dugan said similar thievery took place in multiple cities.\", \"\\\"It was meant to look like looting, but it really wasn't. It's a criminal entity employing other people to steal for them so they can profit by selling it online,\\\" Dugan said.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938318/san-francisco-robberies-louis-vuitton.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Police officers and emergency crews park outside the Louis Vuitton store in San Francisco's Union Square Monday after looters ransacked businesses.

Gavin Newsom said his office met with retailers over the weekend who asked for more police patrols.\", \"\\\"You will see substantially more starting today, in and around areas that are highly trafficked and coming into the holiday season Black Friday in shopping malls,\\\" he told reporters Monday at an event in San Francisco.\", \"He said the California Highway Patrol immediately stepped up patrols along nearby highway corridors following the thefts this weekend and asked local officials how they could help.\", \"In July, Newsom signed a law that allows prosecutors to charge those who work with others to steal merchandise. He said this year's state budget included millions of dollars for local officials to address retail theft and his January budget proposal will include an \\\"exponential increase of support to help cities and counties.\\\"\", \"\\\"My business has been broken into three times this year,\\\" he said. \\\"I have no empathy, no sympathy for these folks, and they must be held to account.\\\" Newsom owns two wine shops in San Francisco.\", \"Most of the flash mob robberies had been happening in stores near highways in suburbs where police response can be slower.\", \"Retailers lose about $65 billion each year to organized theft, the bulk stolen by professional thieves.

They are mostly residents of the Bay Area and some are known to San Francisco police, Scott said, adding that he expects more suspects will be arrested in the coming days.\", \"Car access to the streets in Union Square will soon be limited and the area will be flooded with police officers, Scott said.\", \"\\\"We will do what we need to do to put an end to this madness,\\\" Scott said at a news conference Saturday.\", \"Hours later, about 80 people, some wearing ski masks and wielding crowbars, ransacked a Nordstrom at an outdoor mall in Walnut Creek 20 miles (32 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco, assaulting employees and stealing merchandise before fleeing in waiting cars, police and witnesses said.\", \"Two employees were assaulted and one was hit with pepper spray during what police called a \\\"clearly a planned event\\\" Saturday in the downtown shopping district in the city.
