The final nail in the coffin is the message we have been sent that we are not as important or as valuable as the other professions in the health system.\\\"\", \"Fellow member Nichola said the mental health workforce was also streteched from before the pandemic, and now they were \\\"close to burn out\\\".\", \"\\\"We feel disappointed and frustrated by the offer. We are being left behind while other health professions progress.\", \"\\\"We now have teammates working alongside one another earning significantly different amounts.
