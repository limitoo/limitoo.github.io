Among the biggest questions facing regulators is whether the drug, in the course of wreaking havoc on the virus\\u2019s genes, also has the potential to cause mutations in human DNA.\", \"Scientists are especially worried about pregnant women, they said, because the drug could affect a fetus\\u2019s dividing cells, theoretically causing birth defects. Members of the F.D.A. expert committee expressed those same concerns during a public meeting on Nov. 30.\", \"\\u201cDo we want to reduce the risk for the mother by 30 percent while exposing the embryo and the fetus to a much higher risk of harm by this drug?\\u201d Dr. James Hildreth, the president of Meharry Medical College in Tennessee, said at the meeting. \\u201cMy answer is no, and there is no circumstance in which I would advise a pregnant woman to take this drug.\\u201d\", \"The F.D.A. advisers also noted that the risks could extend to other patients, including men wanting to become fathers, though those risks remain poorly understood and Merck said its own studies had turned up no evidence that the drug causes DNA mutations.\", \"Crucially, molnupiravir is expected to work against Omicron. But it has drawn concern from some scientists and regulators in Europe for being less effective than certain other treatments: It has been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization and death by 30 percent if given within five days of symptoms emerging.\", \"Here\\u2019s what scientists know about how the drug works and its potential risks.\", \"When the drug is processed in the body, it creates compounds that closely resemble one of the building blocks of RNA, the genetic material inside the coronavirus.\", \"That causes problems for the coronavirus as it makes copies of itself: Once the virus enters a cell and starts replicating, the drug compound can slip into the virus\\u2019s RNA and insert enough errors that the virus cannot survive.\", \"\\u201cWhat molnupiravir does is it disguises itself,\\u201d Elizabeth Campbell, an expert in structural biology at the Rockefeller University who studies coronavirus antivirals, said in an interview. \\u201cIt can propagate errors that are going to be sprinkled all over the genome.\\u201d\", \"Making more and more mistakes, the virus eventually grinds to a stop, Dr. Campbell said. That helps the body fight off the infection and potentially saves the patient\\u2019s life.\", \"The problem is that the same compound that interferes in the replication of the virus\\u2019s genetic material can also be transformed into one that resembles a building block of DNA. Some scientists are concerned that could cause errors in a patient\\u2019s own DNA, or in that of a developing fetus.\", \"\\u201cIf cells are replicating, it means they\\u2019re uptaking a version of one of the DNA building blocks derived from molnupiravir and incorporating it,\\u201d Dr. Campbell said.\", \"A team of researchers at the University of North Carolina studied the use of molnupiravir in isolated hamster cells over 32 days and found that the drug did induce mutations in DNA.\", \"Those mutations could \\u201ccontribute to the development of cancer, or cause birth defects either in a developing fetus or through incorporation into sperm precursor cells,\\u201d the authors of that study wrote.\", \"The drug targets only dividing cells, which are relatively sparse in an adult. That poses a narrower risk than other so-called mutagens, like radiation, which can damage DNA in all types of cells.\", \"Still, Ronald Swanstrom, an H.I.V. researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill who helped lead the hamster cell study, said that adults had enough dividing cells \\u2014 in bones, for example, and in the lining of the gut \\u2014 to cause concern. He also noted that men were constantly making dividing sperm cells that could carry potential mutations.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think anybody knows what this dose means in terms of human outcomes,\\u201d Dr. Swanstrom said. \\u201cI hope it\\u2019s trivial, but I don\\u2019t think anybody knows.\\u201d\", \"In a letter objecting to Dr. Swanstrom\\u2019s conclusions, Merck scientists said that hamster cells were exposed to the drug for considerably longer than Covid patients would be. The company said that it tested the drug in rodents and found no signs of DNA mutations (also known as mutagenicity).\", \"\\u201cWe see this molecule as having a very low risk for mutagenicity,\\u201d Dr. Roy Baynes, Merck\\u2019s chief medical officer, said in an interview. \\u201cThis drug is used for five days, and the goal is to eradicate the virus quickly, and this is not a long-term treatment.\\u201d\", \"Brianne Barker, a biologist at Drew University, said that Merck should publish its rodent data, but that the short course of treatment lowered the risks. She said that the isolated hamster cells were also \\u201ca bit different from cells you\\u2019d actually find in an organism,\\u201d making it difficult to know how serious the dangers would be in people.\", \"Cells in a fetus are dividing all the time, heightening the risk of mutations. As a result, Merck excluded pregnant and breastfeeding women, as well as women likely to become pregnant, from its clinical trial.\", \"\\u201cHuman development in utero is an absolutely astounding sequence of events,\\u201d said Dr. John Mellors, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. \\u201cYou start tinkering with that in any way, you can end up with a disaster.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Mellors noted that Merck had reported that high doses of the drug in pregnant rats could cause developmental abnormalities or the death of a fetus.\", \"In Britain, health authorities have said that Merck\\u2019s pill should not be given to pregnant or breastfeeding women. Women who could become pregnant, they advised, should use contraception while taking the drug and for four days after.\", \"\\u201cIf I was pregnant, I wouldn\\u2019t take this,\\u201d Dr. Campbell said. \\u201cI probably would go so far as to say I wouldn\\u2019t give it to a child, a teenager, anyone whose cells are still dividing and differentiating at higher rates.\\u201d\", \"Scientists said that older antiviral pills offered lessons for safely prescribing molnupiravir. Before powerful hepatitis C drugs arrived in recent years, doctors frequently used a pill known as ribavirin as part of combination therapy to treat hepatitis C patients.\", \"The F.D.A. warns that ribavirin should not be given to pregnant women or to their male partners, and that pregnancy should be avoided during treatment and for months afterward.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s no doubt that if you read the label, you pause,\\u201d said Dr. Ashwin Balagopal, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University who has treated hepatitis C patients with ribavirin and is now leading a study of molnupiravir. \\u201cWe were careful about how we did it, but we didn\\u2019t avoid using it because we thought, let\\u2019s wait for something better.\\u201d\", \"Within weeks, Pfizer is expected to receive the government\\u2019s green light for its own Covid pill, which appears to be more effective than Merck\\u2019s \\u2014 and doesn\\u2019t carry the risk of mutations in human DNA.\", \"But molnupiravir is expected to be more readily available than Pfizer\\u2019s drug in the coming months, when the country may be facing a new surge in cases caused by the Omicron variant.\", \"\\u201cWe have to do what we can with what we have right now,\\u201d Dr. Balagopal said.\", \"As people age or develop conditions that put them at higher risk of getting severely sick from a coronavirus infection, the benefits of the drug could outweigh the risks, scientists said. Dr. Barker noted that adults readily accept an increased risk of mutations from being in the sunlight, for example.\", \"\\u201cIn those individuals who might have a particularly high risk of Covid disease, that risk might outweigh the risk of mutagenesis,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWhereas in a younger individual who is planning to have kids, or a younger individual who\\u2019s pregnant, they might want to take a different drug.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Swanstrom, the University of North Carolina researcher, said he had wrestled with whether to speak up about concerns that remain largely theoretical, given the drug\\u2019s potential to save lives.\", \"\\u201cIs it better to subvert this concern and hope for the best?\\u201d he said. \\u201cOr is it better to be open about the concerns and try to figure out what the path forward should be and have some kind of consensus around that?\\u201d\", \"He added, \\u201cIf the risk is really trivial, then it would be a bad mistake not to give it.\\u201d\", \"Scientists have urged Merck to publish the full findings of its rodent studies examining the risk of DNA mutations.\", \"Several experts also urged that researchers be allowed to study the long-term health outcomes of people who receive molnupiravir. That data could indicate whether people who take the drug develop cancer or have children with birth defects at higher rates than would be expected.\", \"Merck executives told the F.D.A. advisory committee that the company would enact a surveillance program to monitor women who take molnupiravir during pregnancy. (Even if the drug is not formally authorized for this group, women may take the drug before they know they are pregnant.)\", \"Scientists said that while vaccination is the safest, most effective way of reducing Covid risks, antiviral pills will remain an important tool for addressing later stages of the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cThe entire population will never be completely vaccinated, immune responses will fade with time and people will get infected \\u2014 if not here, then in other countries,\\u201d said Matthias G\\u00f6tte, a professor at the University of Alberta in Canada who has studied molnupiravir.\", \"The stakes are high for future epidemics, too. Molnupiravir has potential to work against a number of other viruses, like SARS and influenza. But scientists said that there were some signs the drug would need to be used at higher doses against other viruses, making it all the more urgent to understand the risks.\", \"\\u201cWe could use this against the next epidemic on Day 2,\\u201d Dr. Swanstrom said. \\u201cWe should at least put ourselves in a position to find out what it means to use this drug long term.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e68de25c5c2a11eca6ad53cf99416032"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e68de25c5c2a11eca6ad53cf99416032"}},
