I think we start making a mistake when we take options off the table. So I would hope the president keeps that option on the table.\\\"\", \"Wicker later specified military action could mean anything from an increased number of uniformed troops on the ground in Ukraine to even the possibility of threatening nuclear action as a potential deterrent.\", \"Inhofe, of Oklahoma, advocated for sanctions against Russia for the actions it has already committed, as well as providing more military support to the Ukrainian army than what was provided in 2014 when Russia occupied Crimea, which Inhofe said happened because of what the U.S. didn't do, in a press release.\", \"\\\"This should include anti-air, anti-tank and counter-artillery weapons, as well as cyber capabilities, information operations, and more intelligence sharing with our allies and partners so they can contribute as well,\\\" the statement said. \\\"President Biden is about three months too late on sending this aid, and we cannot afford to wait any longer.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947311/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-russia-us-ukraine.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">U.S. President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a two-hour video call Tuesday over Russia's gathering of troops along its border with Ukraine, and economic and military steps that the U.S. and NATO allies are prepared to take against Russia if it continues.

He told President Putin directly that if Russia further invades Ukraine, the United States and our European allies would respond with strong economic measures,\\\" Sullivan said. \\\"We would provide additional defensive material to the Ukrainians above and beyond that which we are already providing, and we would fortify our NATO allies on the eastern flank with additional capabilities in response to such an escalation.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947312/joe-biden-vladimir-putin-ukraine-jake-sullivan.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan calls on reporters while taking questions about President Joe Biden's conversation with Russian President Vladimir Putin in the Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House Tuesday.
