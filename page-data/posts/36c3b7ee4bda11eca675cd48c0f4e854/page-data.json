Eventually the days improved to finish with fine, sunny weather and the need to use irrigation on young, recently planted vegetable seedlings.\", \"The skies opened over Waikato on Saturday - near Hamilton between 40 and 53 millimetres fell.\\u00a0 Since, there've been good warm temperatures so the grass is growing well. Milk production's holding but is a tad behind the same time last year.\\u00a0 Maize crops are going in - an ag consultant says they've a lot to contend with this year. He's heard farmers are having problems with cut worm - a little grub that lives in the soil and eats maize seed. He also knows of one farm that has had several patches of maize cleared out by pukeko, and if that's not enough one farm has had four paddocks of maize cleared out by rats - they live in the drains and come out at night. The farmer's shot 66 of them and has called in pest control.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/280640/eight_col_IMG_3761.JPG?1637284963\\\" alt=\\\"No caption\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPhoto: RNZ/Carol Stiles\\n</div>\", \"Unfortunately not much has improved for avocado growers - a Bay of Plenty packhouse owner says the Australian market continues to be difficult and boats are still not arriving on time to take avocados to Asia - some fruit has had to be withdrawn from the market because it was too ripe when it arrived.\\u00a0 If you can get fruit safely to market there - prices are reasonable.\\u00a0 There's also a higher reject rate of fruit going through packhouses this year - there's a lot of 'ridging'\\u00a0 which is a cosmetic problem cause by cool winds - the fruit's absolutely fine on the inside but markets don't want it. We're told the picking season will be extended this year probably until March - there's not point in picking it if there's little market demand and it can sit quite happily on the trees until its needed.\\u00a0 As for kiwifruit - it's the peak pollination period for green fruit\\u00a0 - and there's been enough warm dry weather between showers for the bees to do their job.\", \"King Country's had some good rain - but could do with more sunshine to give clover and the lambs a boost.\\u00a0 Sheep and beef farmers are upbeat\\u00a0 - they're receiving good prices for their animals.\", \"Waitara in Taranaki has had some much needed rain this week as well as warm sunny days - it's been a bit of a slow old season for growth.\\u00a0\\u00a0 The farmer we called had been to a discussion group about feral cats - she says farmers often don't have the heart to shoot them and those who live near more populated areas are loath to get rid of them because they are not sure if they are someone's pet. She says feral cats are crafty - they quickly learn about traps and teach their kittens to avoid them too.\\u00a0 She says the message was that everyone should micro-chip their pets.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/245694/eight_col_gizzzy.jpg?1602806843\\\" alt=\\\"The port at Gisborne\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nGisborne \\nPhoto: RNZ/Carol Stiles\\n</div>\", \"Across the island and 'she's been warm' in Gisborne.

Log prices have dropped but the trucks just keep rolling to the port and ships are still lining up off the beach....\", \"The farmer we called in Hawkes Bay was puffing when we rang\\u00a0 - he was putting in a post hole for a strainer. He says the region's had hot, windy weather\\u00a0 which is very drying\\u00a0 but\\u00a0 some spots were lucky to have had thunderstorms. Prices from the works are still north of $9 a kilogramme for lambs and a couple of weeks ago he was paid\\u00a0 $1847 for a 285 kilogramme prime angus heifer - he was very pleased.\\u00a0 \\u00a0\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/280457/eight_col_20211116_171627.jpg?1637185519\\\" alt=\\\"Regional wrap\\r\\n\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nRegional wrap\\r\\n \\nPhoto: Susan Murray/RNZ\\n</div>\", \"Friday had the 'feel good factor' in Rangitikei - it was a stunner.\\u00a0 It had been a bit wet and windy.

Sheep are being shorn and grapevine canopies are looking lush.\", \"In the Nelson Motueka region it's been bright, sunny and warm - that's despite a fresh dusting of snow around the hills on Tuesday night.\\u00a0 Hop training is going well and apples and kiwifruit are looking good - the bees have been taken out of gold kiwifruit blocks and are now in with the green - which are flowering a few days earlier than usual.\\u00a0 Last year it was horribly wet over the gold pollination period and a lot of flowers were missed by the bees...this year growers are hugely relived the bees are able to fly about and work in sunshine. There are still a lot of jobs going on orchards.\\u00a0 The region could now do with a bit of rain - after enjoying the chance to dry out - it had had a very wet winter and 30 to 40 percent more rain year-to-date than last year. Farms are looking lush.\", \"Marlbourough farmer in the Wairau valley have been busy in windy conditions culling ewes and sending drafting lambs to the works or to the sales.\\u00a0 it's the time of year when they like to get a few mouths off the farm to take the pressure off feed.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The wind's made it difficult to spray in vineyards. Bud rubbing and wire lifting are the jobs this week - vineyard managers are having to very well organised as they're working with fewer staff that they'd like.\\u00a0 Irrigators have been turned on and farmers and growers would like 30 mils of rain in one dump please...\", \"Friday was a cracker of a day at Runanga on the West Coast\\u00a0 - it'd been very wet earlier in the week but the rain was welcome. A farmer there has made his first cut of silage, he's finished weaning calved and is busy with mating. He's excited to have bought a second-hand EV - he lives 35 km from town and can buzz in and out twice without having to re-charge.

It's really taken the pressure off as soil conditions were rapidly drying out and pasture on the very light soils was browning off. Lamb growth is behind normal following the cold spring. Farmers have their fingers crossed the schedule will hold up.\", \"Things are looking a picture in south Otago and our contact tells us everyone is well up to date with their jobs. Crops are going in the ground, most of the tailings been done, our farmer's given his lambs their first drench and he's looking forward to a good season. Farmers have had problems getting staff so that'll be an issue for farm back-up plans if Covid does get into the community here.\", \"It was a wet start to the week in Southland. The dump of rain was needed as some crops have had trouble getting away. Plenty of baleage has been made and stock are in good nick, despite variable feed levels. A norwester had blown up on Friday morning and the farmer we called was doing a bit of tractor work, spreading fert ahead of possible more rain.
