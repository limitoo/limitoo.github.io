Jurors convicted only Travis McMichael of the malice murder charge, which means they concluded that he intended to kill Mr. Arbery. They acquitted the other two men on that charge but found them both guilty of felony murder, which applies when someone commits a felony and causes someone\\u2019s death.\", \"Both types of murder charges carry the same penalty, which requires a judge to issue a life sentence but allows the judge to decide whether a defendant should have an opportunity for parole. Even if the judge grants the possibility of parole, the defendants would not be eligible under Georgia\\u2019s laws until they have been in prison for 30 years. Both charges can also result in the death penalty, but prosecutors did not seek it in this case.\", \"Judge Timothy R. Walmsley, who oversaw the trial, will decide the men\\u2019s sentences after a hearing, which has not been scheduled. At the hearing, prosecutors and lawyers for the men will be able to argue for their preferred sentence, and relatives of Mr. Arbery may also deliver a victim impact statement to the court.\", \"\\u201cThe judge has seen the whole case,\\u201d said Sarah Gerwig-Moore, a professor at the Mercer University School of Law, in Macon, Ga. \\u201cThere\\u2019s evidence that the jury never heard about that the judge did, and he could take that into account in the sentencing.\\u201d\", \"In sentencing the men, the judge will consider a range of aggravating and mitigating factors. Experts said it was unlikely that the jury\\u2019s decision to acquit Gregory McMichael and Mr. Bryan on malice murder would have a serious effect, though the judge might take into account that it was Travis McMichael, and not the other two men, who pulled the trigger.\", \"\\u201cThe fact that they didn\\u2019t actually shoot could be considered,\\u201d said Melissa D. Redmon, a former prosecutor in Fulton County, Ga., who is now an assistant professor at the University of Georgia School of Law. \\u201cStill, under the law, they have the same culpability.\\u201d\", \"Even if the judge allows any of the men to seek parole after 30 years, Ms. Redmon said, it is rare for people serving life sentences to be granted parole as soon as they become eligible. At that point, people serving those sentences are considered for parole at least every eight years.\", \"The three men, all of whom are white, are also facing federal hate crime charges after Justice Department prosecutors charged them with interfering with the right of Mr. Arbery, who is Black, to use a public street because of his race. They also charged all three men with attempted kidnapping, and they charged Travis and Gregory McMichael with using, carrying and brandishing a firearm. That trial has been scheduled for February.\"]","href_hash":"c3a6660c4d8811ecbad39fb10fce0347"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c3a6660c4d8811ecbad39fb10fce0347"}},
