Hopefully, they're all eligible and have got their booster now, so that's number one,\\\" he told Morning Report.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Number two is to reduce your contact with people outside your family unit, perhaps during this period when the outbreak is peaking\\u2026 and masks really do make a difference.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Baker said the red setting is time to reign back interactions and large events or gatherings for everyone.\\u00a0\", \"He also called for children as young as two to wear masks because they are unable to be vaccinated.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I think it would be challenging but\\u2026 the big problem is because we can't vaccinate preschool children, we have to have some way of limiting transmission,\\\" he told the Project.\\u00a0\", \"Additionally, Baker warned the Omicron outbreak is likely to be short but \\\"very intense\\\".\", \"\\\"Unfortunately the virus will keep evolving so it may not be over for the foreseeable future.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"But this big pandemic wave the world is seeing at the moment with Omicron will be short but very intense.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"And there could be some good news on the horizon.
