Word spread, and soon he was getting calls from people who were about to be evicted or were escaping domestic violence.\", \"Fast forward, and Mr. Williams has gone from working solo out of a Dodge Caravan to managing a regular crew of movers and driving a 20-foot truck.\", \"He has been in the business for so long, he\\u2019s started to track major milestones of repeat clients. \\u201cParents will say to me, \\u2018Move my son into the dorms,\\u2019\\u201d said Mr. Williams. \\u201cI\\u2019ll move that person out of college and, a few years later, into their own apartment. A few years after that, into their girlfriend\\u2019s apartment, and then a bigger apartment, because they now have kids.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Williams, 50, lives in St. Albans, Queens, with his cat, Frisky.\", \"MEOW I wake up at 7. Even on days off, my cat will jump on my chest once she sees me not getting up \\u2014 she doesn\\u2019t realize I don\\u2019t have to work, but she knows she has to eat. On work days, I leave my house at 8 religiously, even if the job is five blocks from me. If I\\u2019m early, I\\u2019ll sit outside reading emails.\", \"MILITARY MISSION The only time I eat breakfast are the days I\\u2019m off. When I wake up on a workday, I\\u2019m going over the details of the job like it\\u2019s a military mission: I\\u2019m working out my route to the job, I\\u2019m reading emails, and checking for last-minute stuff.\", \"TRUCKIN\\u2019 My sister meets the movers and drives them to the job. I\\u2019m driving in the truck alone, alone, alone. I love it. The truck is always parked in front of my house. I walk to the truck, fire it up, plug in the GPS and send a link to the client so they can see the truck in real time like an Uber.\", \"There\\u2019s a lot of stuff you realize over the years that keeps your customers friendly. They\\u2019re stressed about the move \\u2014 most people can\\u2019t tell the landlord, \\u201cI\\u2019m not going to be out because the movers didn\\u2019t show up\\u201d \\u2014 so once you send them that link, they send you a smiley face. A lot of times they\\u2019ll ask me, what do you guys want for breakfast? You can gauge how people are feeling about the move based on how they treat you. If they don\\u2019t like the job you\\u2019re doing, they don\\u2019t feed you. If you\\u2019re doing a great job, they come with Gatorades and water.\", \"WORTH THE TICKET You can\\u2019t plan parking beforehand because you don\\u2019t know which cars are going to be where. Even when you know there is a designated unloading spot, you\\u2019ll get some guy with a plaque parked there. If you have a fire hydrant on the block, that\\u2019s my parking spot. Now granted, the parking spot is going to cost me because I\\u2019m going to get a ticket, but I do the math and it works out.\", \"BOUNDARIES I used to do stuff like, if a mattress wouldn\\u2019t fit through the stairs, I\\u2019d get a rope and pull the mattress and box spring from the first floor all the way up through the window. There was a review where a guy was like, \\u201cI hired Adonis movers, and I ended up getting the A-Team!\\u201d We were all pulling this rope, and it was a windy day. In the beginning I didn\\u2019t know the consequences.\", \"Or it could be a sofa that doesn\\u2019t fit in that elevator. \\u201cWell, sir, you\\u2019re on the 22nd floor \\u2014 how did it fit the first time?\\u201d What happened is that they called a sofa doctor, he took the couch apart and put it together upstairs, but they don\\u2019t want to pay that extra fee. How do I tell my guys, with a straight face, you are carrying a couch down 22 flights? I used to try and do it, and somebody was always mad at me. Now, I\\u2019ll simply say, \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t fit. The same way it got up into this apartment is the same way it has to come down, so you\\u2019ve got to call the sofa doctor dude.\\u201d\", \"SOFT SKILLS People have a short memory. They\\u2019ll say, \\u201cDon\\u2019t leave the door open.\\u201d And I\\u2019m like, \\u201cMa\\u2019am, when the movers moved you in, do you think they had a box, put it down, and closed the door each time?\\u201d\", \"I treat everyone nicely, though. I\\u2019ll say, \\u201cMa\\u2019am, I understand your concerns about your packages in the lobby being left alone. I\\u2019m going to be here the whole time. If someone comes in and looks suspicious, I\\u2019m going to jump right on them, I\\u2019m going to be the UPS cop.\\u201d Once you put a little humor in there, you can usually deflate the situation.\", \"COFFEE BREAK A typical move will be 10 a.m. to noon to get the stuff out of the apartment, then an hour for the drive and one hour to get everything in. By 2, I\\u2019m done. I can go to my local Dunkin\\u2019 Donuts. I get a medium iced coffee, four milks, four sugars. I can\\u2019t take cream, and I don\\u2019t want that almond milk or that oat milk \\u2014 I can\\u2019t trust it. Coffee costs too much to be experimenting. I\\u2019m a guy of habits. When they see me come through the door, my coffee is ready.\", \"BRUISED APPLES I go to Key Foods. They are pretty friendly with me; I like to go where people know me. I\\u2019m not a complain-y kind of guy. Someone might say to me, \\u201cHey, sir, the apple or tomato you have there has a bruise.\\u201d I keep the bruised apples so someone else doesn\\u2019t get them. I know I could just cut that bruise right off.\", \"NARROW COOKING LANE If I finish a move at 2, I\\u2019m home by 3 and can cook dinner. Now, with the internet, you can really get down and cook anything. But mostly I stay in my lane. I can fry some chicken, I can cook a steak, I can make pork chops, I like making pasta.\", \"NEWS AND THE COMPETITION At night, I watch the news: CNN until 8 and then MSNBC. I\\u2019ll read emails and reviews \\u2014 I don\\u2019t just read my reviews. If a company has one star, I\\u2019m trying to find out what the hell they did: The mover goes up on the price, shows up late, breaks stuff and refuses to pay, or doesn\\u2019t come with any tools. That\\u2019s why I have a truck full of tools, come on time and never complain.\", \"WHITE NOISE Every night is a struggle, because I have work on my mind \\u2014 even stuff like: \\u201cOh my gosh, now I remember where those screws are! They\\u2019re in the back of the TV!\\u201d I say, \\u201cOK Google, good night,\\u201d and Google Home plays these cricket sounds, or it will play soothing music, or tell me a story, or rain. That rain on a tin roof, let me tell you.\"]","href_hash":"e40ae19c59a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e40ae19c59a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}},
