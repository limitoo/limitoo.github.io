We have offered her wide-ranging support, will stay in regular touch with her, and have already agreed on a personal meeting in January.\\u201d\", \"As with an earlier call with Peng on Nov. 21, the I.O.C. did not release video or a transcript of the call, nor did it say how Wednesday\\u2019s call was arranged or who took part.
