China denies those allegations.\", \"Global Olympic sponsors were grilled by a bipartisan congressional panel in July, which accused the companies of putting profits ahead of accusations of genocide in China.\", \"\\u201cThe halo is tarnished,\\u201d said Mark DiMassimo, founder of New York-based ad agency DiMassimo Goldstein, which represents brands that are not official sponsors but plan to air commercials during the Olympics.\", \"He said his clients decided to strip from their campaigns mentions of traditional Olympic themes - friendly competition, global unity and good sportsmanship - shortly after the Biden administration announced a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics last month.\", \"Bridgestone Corp, an official sponsor of the International Olympic Committee, this month began airing a commercial featuring U.S figure skater Nathan Chen, an Asian American, who advocates for authentic representation in skating, \\\"no matter who you are or where you come from.\\\"\", \"Delta Air Lines Inc, the official airline of Team USA, is airing two commercials spotlighting skiers, snowboarders and figure skaters who defy gravity in their events.\", \"German financial services firm Allianz will have a film featuring winter athletes that will play on social media in the United States, a spokesperson said. Last year, Allianz filmed a short video about U.S. Paralympic athlete Matt Stutzman.\", \"When Reuters asked the global and Team USA sponsors about marketing plans for the Olympics, only two responded, one of which declined to comment.\", \"BIG DEPARTURE\", \"This year\\u2019s response is a big departure from Olympics past, when advertisers crafted ads that embraced the spirit of the Games and honored the culture of the host country.\", \"Microsoft Corp last year aired a commercial for the Tokyo Olympics in which Japanese citizens showed famous parts of the city such as the Shibuya Crossing over a Teams call, sharing a piece of Tokyo for people who could not be there due to the pandemic.\", \"A Coca-Cola Co ad for the 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics featured animated birds stealing straws from Coke drinks to build a replica of the famed Bird\\u2019s Nest stadium. But that was then.\", \"With the political controversy and the pandemic once again preventing spectators from travelling to the Games, viewers this time around can expect to see fewer mentions of the host city, said Jeremy Carey, managing director of ad agency Optimum Sports, a unit of Omnicom Media Group.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a challenge, quite frankly,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe connection isn\\u2019t as prevalent as it would normally be.\\u201d\", \"Focusing on the athletes competing on the global stage is considered the safest strategy for brands, experts said.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re trying to steer clear of the geopolitical implications around (the Olympics),\\u201d said Chris Brandt, chief marketing officer at Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. Chipotle will run ads during the Olympics promoting \\u201creal food for real athletes,\\u201d and feature the preferred orders of competitors like U.S. ice hockey player Hilary Knight.\", \"Any attempt for a brand to associate themselves with the Beijing Olympics could backfire, DiMassimo said. \\u201cYou just don\\u2019t know. You put (the commercial) on, and it might explode.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"7feb10ec7fa211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7feb10ec7fa211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
