A \\\"harmless error\\\" is not enough to overturn a conviction, according to Bennett Gershman, a professor at Pace Law School.\", \"\\\"It's a very heavy burden,\\\" Gershman said, adding that federal appellate courts tend to defer to trial judges.\", \"An avenue of appeal for the defense might be to argue that the testimony of Kate, one of the accusers, was improperly admitted.\", \"While described in the indictment as a victim, Nathan instructed the jury that Kate was actually over the age of consent at the time of her alleged encounters with Epstein. However, Nathan said the jury could still consider her testimony if they found it useful.\", \"\\\"While the court limited that testimony, and gave the jury an appropriate limiting instruction, the defense may continue to argue that Kate's testimony should have been excluded,\\\" said Sarah Krissoff, a partner at the Day Pitney law firm and a former federal prosecutor.\", \"The defense also objected to Nathan's instruction to the jury that they could find Maxwell guilty if she deliberately ignored evidence of Epstein's wrongdoing, a legal concept known as \\\"conscious avoidance.\\\"\", \"Maxwell's lawyers argued that prosecutors' theory of the case was that Maxwell was an active participant, not a mere bystander, and accused prosecutors of trying to \\\"have it both ways.\\\"\", \"Nathan ultimately allowed the instruction after noting that the defense itself had sought to show during opening statements and cross-examination of witnesses that Maxwell was unaware of Epstein's behavior.\", \"\\\"Maxwell will have an uphill battle challenging the conscious avoidance charge, as the government presented a factual basis for such a charge,\\\" Krissoff said.\", \"Maxwell's lawyers may also raise on appeal Nathan's ruling preventing three defense witnesses from testifying anonymously.\", \"Three of Maxwell's four accusers testified under pseudonyms or used only their first names to protect their privacy as victims of sexual abuse.\", \"But Nathan said privacy concerns did not apply to the defense witnesses because none of them intended to testify about sensitive personal topics or sexual conduct.\", \"Gershman said that any appeal would be hampered by the fact that Maxwell's lawyers waited until near the end of the trial to ask for anonymity.\", \"\\\"If they felt this was a serious concern, they should have raised this before the trial,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"e449030869a611ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e449030869a611ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
