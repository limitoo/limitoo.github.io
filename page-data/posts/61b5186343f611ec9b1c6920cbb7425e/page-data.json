Palacio, Sharon M. Draper and J. Anderson Coats","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-12T12:23:59.000Z","content":"[\"PONYBy R. J. Palacio\", \"OUT OF MY HEARTBy Sharon M. Draper\", \"THE NIGHT RIDEBy J. Anderson Coats\", \"A truly good horse book, whether read late into the night under covers, clasped to the chest on the school bus or nestled dog-eared in a knapsack, can bring horses whinnying and galloping through a childhood bedroom, a school cafeteria, a soul.\", \"\\u201cBlack Beauty,\\u201d \\u201cThe Black Stallion\\u201d and \\u201cMisty of Chincoteague\\u201d are the paradigms of this genre, each gripping in a different way. Beauty\\u2019s story haunts because the gelding tells it through his own eyes; the Black\\u2019s tale grips because he and his boy face epic adventure; Misty is unforgettable because the story is almost true. What makes these seminal horse books so compelling, so nearly as good as the real fur-covered thing, is that they not only get at the bond between horse and human, but they also look deeply into the soul of the animal itself.\", \"So it is surprising that \\u201cPony,\\u201d the eagerly anticipated new novel by R. J. Palacio (\\u201cWonder,\\u201d \\u201cWhite Bird\\u201d), does little justice to the animal it is named for, whose white-splashed face peers off the cover. \\u201cWonder,\\u201d a quiet masterwork about a boy with extreme facial anomalies, confines its drama to the quotidian halls of Auggie Pullman\\u2019s middle school. The action of \\u201cPony\\u201d takes place on a grander scale, with higher stakes, following its young protagonist, Silas, as he makes a harrowing trek across a haunted forest and dangerous ravines. He is searching for his father, recently kidnapped by counterfeiters because of a case \\u2014 so Silas believes \\u2014 of mistaken identity.\", \"Silas is afflicted by whatever it is that ails the child in \\u201cThe Sixth Sense\\u201d: He\\u2019s followed by ghosts, including a shoeless guardian spirit called Mittenwool, some of whom ask for help with their problems. But aggression and unkindness sour the enjoyment of several relationships in \\u201cPony,\\u201d from the U.S. marshal who links up with Silas and spends most of the time berating him, to a reunion with an estranged grandmother that is full of bitterness.\", \"As Silas closes in on his father\\u2019s whereabouts, the action is gripping, and the spooky hum of the paranormal tracing through the story, combined with daguerreotypes and ambrotypes featuring old-timey people that front the chapters, will stir young readers. The book shines when it digs into the motivations of its many characters. There is a ghost stuck in purgatory because she feels guilty about stealing her brother\\u2019s plum pudding, a kindly war hero who lost the man he loves, and the star-crossed tale of Silas\\u2019s parents. Mittenwool\\u2019s back story is movingly revealed, but the book\\u2019s tenderness is juxtaposed throughout with a fair amount of gore, both human and horse.\", \"Speaking of horses, it is inexplicable to me why a whole book is named after a four-legged character, Pony, who feels like an afterthought. Other than a few pats from Silas, there is no elucidation of a bond with this renegade animal whom he rides to find his father. (He couldn\\u2019t even come up with a real name for him.) So when Pony miraculously saves Silas, by becoming a phantasmagoric fighting machine, the boy-horse loyalty feels unearned.\", \"A better title might have been \\u201cCamera.\\u201d As explained in an author\\u2019s note \\u2014 one of the best moments in the book \\u2014 the novel grew out of Palacio\\u2019s obsession with the wet collodion photographic printing process. Silas\\u2019s father\\u2019s expertise in this area is the motive for his kidnapping by the counterfeiters.\", \"Like \\u201cWonder,\\u201d \\u201cOut of My Heart,\\u201d by Sharon M. Draper (a follow-up to her best-selling \\u201cOut of My Mind\\u201d), is told from the perspective of a physically disabled child. Melody Brooks uses a wheelchair and a digital voice, as a result of debilitating cerebral palsy. \\u201cOut of My Mind\\u201d movingly chronicled her struggle to communicate \\u2014 few realized she was a blinding intellect, trapped in her own body. In this stand-alone sequel, Melody has mastered her \\u201cspeaking board,\\u201d a device she calls Elvira, and is taking on a new challenge: summer camp.\", \"Nearly the entire book takes place during one week at Camp Green Glades, which specializes in campers like Melody. She describes each day in her quippy, hip voice. The details of her meals are striking, immersing readers in her reality: Because she can\\u2019t chew well, her \\u201cpizza\\u201d is served as a bowl of melted cheese and her hot dogs are ground to mush.\", \"Given this vividly imagined world, it is disappointing that Draper does not flesh out Melody\\u2019s bunkmates, each of whom has a different disability. Save one who speaks words in threes, they seem interchangeable. Any tween who has attended camp will tell you that housing four girls in one bunk creates all sorts of palace intrigue, but Melody\\u2019s new pals are almost always cheerful foils.\", \"A horseback riding excursion that goes horribly wrong provides the main drama of Melody\\u2019s experience at Green Glades. Melody\\u2019s uncontrollable kicking, a symptom of her disorder, sends her and the placid therapy horse to which she is strapped bolting into a forest in a storm. (This enormous inaccuracy regarding therapeutic riding mars the story: Buckling a rider to a horse is forbidden, according to the Professional Association of Therapeutic Horsemanship International.)\", \"But it is another trek into the woods that I find most arresting: Melody and her bunkmates escape their well-meaning counselors, who wash them and dress them as well as feed them, to do what girls testing the bounds of childhood (in wheelchairs or no) always do: break some rules.\", \"When they are discovered and scolded, Melody cranks up Elvira\\u2019s volume to yell out an explanation of the 12-year-old girls\\u2019 behavior: \\u201cWe\\u2019re almost teenagers!\\u201d A moving reminder, to their counselors and the reader, to define these humans not by their disabilities but by who they are.\", \"J. Anderson Coats\\u2019s \\u201cThe Night Ride,\\u201d set in a medieval-ish city called Mael Dunn, takes its lead from the classic horse book formula: Girl meets horse, girl falls in love with horse, girl\\u2019s mettle is tested when beloved horse is taken from her.\", \"The adored steed is Ricochet, one of the king\\u2019s horses whom young Sonnia cares for. When he is brought to the racetrack to babysit a flighty golden racehorse, she follows, snagging a job as a stablehand. Swiftly, she finds out that her colleagues have a dangerous pastime: sneaking away to race the animals in their care at night, for a pot of cash. Sonnia must choose \\u2014 put the creatures she worships at risk in a dangerous race, in hopes of a win that would allow her to buy Ricochet, or sit it out and lose him forever.\", \"There are splashes of insight. When she meets the only other female stablehand, Astrid, Sonnia realizes she can\\u2019t hate her, even if the girl is snotty. \\u201cShe\\u2019s done the hard work of making it easier for girls to be stablehands here. Astrid has made a path that all I have to do is follow.\\u201d Things get interesting when Sonnia makes the morally dubious choice to join the Night Ride, and finds out just how expendable the animals she loves are, in the eyes of the world.\", \"Horses here are given identities richer than even the cadre of stablehands in the barn \\u2014 and names.\"]","href_hash":"61b5186343f611ec9b1c6920cbb7425e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"61b5186343f611ec9b1c6920cbb7425e"}},
