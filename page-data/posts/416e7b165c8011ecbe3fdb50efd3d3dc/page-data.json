Trump, played a far more substantial role in plans to try to overturn the 2020 election than was previously known, and he was involved in failed efforts to get Mr. Trump to order the mob invading the Capitol in his name to stand down on Jan. 6, investigators for the House committee scrutinizing the Capitol attack have learned.\", \"From a trove of about 9,000 documents that Mr. Meadows turned over before halting his cooperation with the inquiry, a clearer picture has emerged about the extent of his involvement in Mr. Trump\\u2019s attempts to use the government to invalidate the election results.\", \"The documents also shed light on his knowledge and guidance of a plan by right-wing lawmakers to try to use Congress to overturn the election, and on how he coordinated with organizers of the rally in Washington that culminated in the deadly riot at the Capitol.\", \"Then, according to text messages that members of the panel read aloud on Monday, Mr. Meadows fielded dozens of requests from terrified lawmakers, administration officials and even members of Mr. Trump\\u2019s family on Jan. 6 begging for the president to call off the throngs of his supporters storming the Capitol. Mr. Meadows told people that day that he was trying to persuade Mr. Trump to do so.\", \"The committee voted 9 to 0 on Monday evening to recommend that Mr. Meadows be charged with criminal contempt of Congress for defying its subpoena. The panel acted after he shifted from partially participating in the inquiry to waging a full-blown legal fight against the committee, in line with Mr. Trump\\u2019s directive to stonewall the investigation.\", \"As the committee prepared to vote, Representative Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming and the panel\\u2019s vice chairwoman, read aloud text messages sent to Mr. Meadows by the president\\u2019s son Donald Trump Jr., lawmakers and prominent Fox News hosts beseeching him to ask Mr. Trump to put an end to the mob attack.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s got to condemn this\\u201d as soon as possible, the younger Mr. Trump texted Mr. Meadows, referring to the president.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m pushing hard,\\u201d Mr. Meadows responded. \\u201cI agree.\\u201d\", \"In another, the younger Mr. Trump implored Mr. Meadows: \\u201cWe need an Oval address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far and gotten out of hand.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Cheney also quoted panicked texts from several unnamed lawmakers, including one who told Mr. Meadows, \\u201cWe are under siege up here at the Capitol.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThese texts leave no doubt,\\u201d Ms. Cheney said. \\u201cThe White House knew exactly what was happening at the Capitol.\\u201d\", \"A contempt of Congress charge carries a penalty of up to a year in jail. The panel\\u2019s recommendation sends the matter to the full House, which could vote as early as Tuesday to refer the charge to the Justice Department.\", \"The committee found that Mr. Meadows, a former congressman from North Carolina who led the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, essentially served as Mr. Trump\\u2019s right-hand man throughout various steps of the effort to undermine the 2020 election. Mr. Meadows encouraged members of Congress to object to Joseph R. Biden Jr.\\u2019s victory, and he pursued baseless allegations of voter fraud in several states, according to the panel.\", \"In addition, Mr. Meadows personally coordinated with rally planners who brought throngs of Mr. Trump\\u2019s supporters to Washington on Jan. 6 to protest the president\\u2019s election loss, and Mr. Meadows said he would line up the National Guard to protect them, according to documents he provided to the panel.\", \"At one point, an organizer of the rally turned to Mr. Meadows for help, telling him that things \\u201chave gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction. Please.\\u201d\", \"It is not clear how he responded. The exchanges suggest that Mr. Meadows \\u2014 who at times expressed personal skepticism about the claims of election fraud and theft pushed by Mr. Trump and his allies \\u2014 catered to Mr. Trump by seeking evidence to support the president\\u2019s allegations. Mr. Meadows was in contact with a broad collection of obscure characters whose sometimes zany plans and theories made their way into the White House at a critical time.\", \"Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the chairman of the committee investigating the Capitol attack, called it \\u201cjarring\\u201d that Mr. Meadows would stop cooperating with the panel, given that he served in Congress for more than seven years.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not hard to locate records of his time in the House and find a Mr. Meadows full of indignation because, at the time, a prior administration wasn\\u2019t cooperating with a congressional investigation to his satisfaction,\\u201d Mr. Thompson said.\", \"Before the committee\\u2019s vote, George J. Terwilliger III, Mr. Meadows\\u2019s lawyer, called on the panel to change course, arguing that it was trampling over his client\\u2019s constitutional rights and over presidential prerogatives. Mr. Terwilliger wrote in a letter to the panel that Mr. Meadows had made a \\u201cgood-faith invocation of executive privilege and testimonial immunity by a former senior executive official.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt would ill serve the country to rush to judgment on the matter,\\u201d Mr. Terwilliger wrote.\", \"The committee has heard testimony from more than 300 witnesses, and additional ones are scheduled to appear this week. On three occasions, the panel has moved to hold allies of Mr. Trump in criminal contempt for refusing to comply with its subpoenas.\", \"\\u201cIt comes down to this: Mr. Meadows started by doing the right thing \\u2014 cooperating,\\u201d Mr. Thompson said. \\u201cWhen it was time for him to follow the law, come in and testify on those questions, he changed his mind and told us to pound sand. He didn\\u2019t even show up.\\u201d\", \"Before he stopped cooperating, Mr. Meadows turned over documents that he said were not privileged, but which shed considerable light on his activities in the wake of Mr. Trump\\u2019s election defeat.\", \"As supporters of Mr. Trump strategized about ways to keep him in power, Mr. Meadows encouraged and guided members of Congress on steps they could take to try to overturn the election, the documents show.\", \"\\u201cYes,\\u201d he wrote in one message about appointing a slate of pro-Trump electors and refusing to certify Mr. Biden\\u2019s victory. \\u201cHave a team on it.\\u201d\", \"When Mr. Trump needed someone to inspect an audit of the vote counting in Georgia or to encourage an investigation into the election in Arizona, he dispatched Mr. Meadows, who dutifully tried to carry out the president\\u2019s plans to try to undermine the election.\", \"Mr. Meadows\\u2019s refusal to sit for an interview with the committee comes as he is promoting his new book, \\u201cThe Chief\\u2019s Chief,\\u201d on television. The book contains details of White House conversations and interactions with the president.\", \"\\u201cMr. Meadows has shown his willingness to talk about issues related to the select committee\\u2019s investigation across a variety of media platforms \\u2014 anywhere, it seems, except to the select committee,\\u201d the panel wrote in a report released on Sunday night.\", \"The panel said it also had questions about Mr. Meadows\\u2019s use of a personal cellphone, a Signal account and two personal Gmail accounts for government business, and whether he had properly turned over records from those accounts to the National Archives.\", \"The emails that Mr. Meadows provided to the committee showed that he discussed encouraging state legislators to appoint slates of pro-Trump electors instead of the Biden electors chosen by the voters. They also show that he encouraged Justice Department investigations of unfounded claims of voter fraud, and that he promised the National Guard would be present at the Capitol on Jan. 6 to \\u201cprotect pro Trump people.\\u201d\", \"The committee is also scrutinizing a 38-page PowerPoint document containing plans to overturn Mr. Biden\\u2019s victory. That document, which Mr. Meadows provided to the committee, included a call for Mr. Trump to declare a national emergency, and it promoted an unsupported claim that China and Venezuela had obtained control over the voting infrastructure in a majority of states.\", \"Mr. Meadows\\u2019s lawyer has said that his client had nothing to do with the document.\", \"Mr. Meadows could now find himself facing a criminal charge similar to another of Mr. Trump\\u2019s associates, Stephen K. Bannon, who was indicted by a federal grand jury after the House voted to recommend that he be found in contempt for refusing to cooperate with the committee. His trial is scheduled for next summer.\", \"One by one on Monday, members of the committee assailed Mr. Meadows for refusing to share what he knew about what unfolded on Jan. 6. They said the text messages he provided made it clear that he could shed light on what Mr. Trump was doing and saying at critical times that day.\", \"Fox News hosts were among those who contacted Mr. Meadows on Jan. 6.\", \"\\u201cHey Mark, the president needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home,\\u201d Laura Ingraham wrote. \\u201cHe is destroying his legacy.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cCan he make a statement?\\u201d Sean Hannity wrote to Mr. Meadows. \\u201cAsk people to leave the Capitol.\\u201d\", \"On Jan. 7, Mr. Meadows received a text from an unnamed lawmaker who apologized for failing to overturn Mr. Trump\\u2019s loss.\", \"\\u201cYesterday was a terrible day,\\u201d the lawmaker wrote. \\u201cWe tried everything we could in our objection to the 6 states. I\\u2019m sorry nothing worked.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"416e7b165c8011ecbe3fdb50efd3d3dc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"416e7b165c8011ecbe3fdb50efd3d3dc"}},
