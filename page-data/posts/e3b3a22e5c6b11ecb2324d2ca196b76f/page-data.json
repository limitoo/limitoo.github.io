Two, \\u201cJane\\u201d and \\u201cKate,\\u201d used pseudonyms, while a third, \\u201cCarolyn,\\u201d used only her first name.\", \"Now, three of the defense\\u2019s witnesses have also asked to testify without revealing their identities, Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers say.\", \"The unusual request, which prosecutors oppose, according to a letter to the judge from one of Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s attorneys, Bobbi C. Sternheim, came as Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s defense team prepared to present its case in the closely watched trial. Ms. Maxwell is accused of helping Jeffrey Epstein recruit, groom and in some cases sexually abuse underage girls. She has pleaded not guilty.\", \"The government rested its case against Ms. Maxwell on Friday after two weeks of testimony from four accusers (one of whom testified under her true name) and former employees of Mr. Epstein and other witnesses.\", \"It is not yet clear what sort of defense Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers might mount or whether she might testify in her own defense, but in the letter to Judge Alison J. Nathan, Ms. Sternheim suggested that some potential defense witnesses might not be willing to testify if they had to do so using their real names.\", \"\\u201cThe court\\u2019s ruling on this issue may impact the willingness of these witnesses to testify,\\u201d Ms. Sternheim wrote on Sunday, \\u201cthereby compromising Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s right to present her defense.\\u201d\", \"It is not unheard of for prosecutors to seek anonymity for witnesses in cases like Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s, which involve alleged sexual assault victims, or in trials with testimony from undercover officers or agents or vulnerable informants.\", \"But legal experts interviewed on Monday said they were not aware of trials in which defense witnesses had appeared under a pseudonym or a partial name, as Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s witnesses are requesting to do.\", \"Ms. Sternheim\\u2019s letter did not identify the three witnesses or explain why they were requesting anonymity.\", \"The three were among 35 witness names the defense provided to the government \\u2014 but did not release publicly \\u2014 on Friday evening, according to a government court filing on Sunday. On Friday, another of Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers said in court that the defense was paring its witness list, given that the prosecution had rested its case earlier than expected and had not called \\u201ca significant number of witnesses.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe have a larger list that we\\u2019ve needed to winnow down,\\u201d the lawyer, Jeffrey S. Pagliuca, said. \", \"Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s trial is moving much more quickly than expected. Before the trial began, the prosecution estimated in court papers that it would rest within four weeks, but that it could rest as early as the third week. On Friday, the prosecution rested after a presentation of only two weeks.\", \"Mr. Pagliuca told the judge on Friday that the defense case would last no longer than four days and was likely to be even shorter \\u2014 underscoring that many of the witnesses on its list will not be called to testify.\", \"He did not address whether Ms. Maxwell would testify, but his estimate that the defense would need less than a week for its presentation suggested that she would not take the stand.\", \"The defense request for privacy for witnesses surfaced in court on Friday, when another of Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers, Christian R. Everdell, cited the need for anonymity because of the publicity surrounding Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s case.\", \"\\u201cWe are already getting what I think are valid requests that these witnesses testify anonymously or under some sort of protection, name protection,\\u201d Mr. Everdell said.\", \"Noting the protections that the prosecution\\u2019s witnesses had received, he added, \\u201cPeople who are testifying here might get a lot of unwanted attention, especially if they are testifying on behalf of Ms. Maxwell.\\u201d\", \"Rebecca Roiphe, a professor at New York Law School and a former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said she did not believe Judge Nathan would grant a defense request for anonymity even in a high-profile case without a showing of exceptional circumstances.\", \"\\u201cThere are lots of cases where witnesses would prefer not to be entangled in something,\\u201d she said, \\u201cand I just don\\u2019t think that that\\u2019s an adequate reason for anonymity.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt has to be something more,\\u201d she added, like a legitimate fear of retribution or a witness who was an underage victim of a crime.\", \"Daniel C. Richman, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Manhattan who now teaches at Columbia Law School, said the defense might be seeking to level the playing field before the jury, \\u201cto send the message that, yeah, we know the government needed to put on some witnesses anonymously, but we got the same thing going on, too. It\\u2019s really no big deal.\\u201d\", \"On Friday, Judge Nathan told Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers to confer with the government on the issue. She said that in affording privacy to the three accusers, she had broken no new ground legally \\u2014 \\u201cthat\\u2019s well-tread territory,\\u201d she said.\", \"But she cautioned that even if the parties reached an agreement, she would need more before she approved any such grant of anonymity to defense witnesses.\", \"\\u201cEven if there\\u2019s agreement,\\u201d she said, \\u201cI would look for authority to make sure that it's permissible.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e3b3a22e5c6b11ecb2324d2ca196b76f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e3b3a22e5c6b11ecb2324d2ca196b76f"}},
