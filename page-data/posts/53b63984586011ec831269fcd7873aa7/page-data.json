From the outset, some NATO nations questioned whether the offer of membership was a wise move, and it is not clear that the promise will ever be kept, but predictably, it has fed a lasting conflict with President Vladimir V. Putin.\", \"With Ukraine a NATO partner but not a member, it does not benefit from NATO\\u2019s core principle, the commitment to collective defense, though Ukraine has sent troops to fight in NATO missions in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\", \"So, as thousands of Russian troops mass on Ukraine\\u2019s borders, NATO is not bound by treaty to protect Ukraine militarily, nor is it likely to try, but it has a compelling interest in trying both to deter Russia and avoid provoking an invasion.\", \"\\u201cIt is important to distinguish between NATO allies and partner Ukraine,\\u201d Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary-general, said last week. \\u201cNATO allies, there we provide collective defense guarantees,\\u2019\\u2019 while \\u201cUkraine is a partner, a highly valued partner.\\u201d\", \"But what does NATO owe such a highly valued partner?\", \"\\u201cThe question that NATO faces at its core is how it maintains the credibility of the alliance,\\u201d said Ivo Daalder, a former U.S. ambassador to NATO and president of the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. For all its closeness to NATO, he said, Ukraine is not a member, so \\u201chow do you still guarantee its independence and sovereignty?\\u201d\", \"Marta Dassu, a former Italian deputy foreign minister and adviser on Europe to the Aspen Institute said, \\u201cYou can\\u2019t explicitly accept Putin\\u2019s proposal to rule out membership in NATO, so in the end you try to build up Ukraine\\u2019s military deterrence but can resort only to more economic sanctions, and that\\u2019s probably not enough.\\u201d\", \"The Biden administration has sounded alarms recently about a possible Russian invasion of Ukraine and has warned Moscow that serious economic penalties would follow. On Wednesday, President Biden and Mr. Putin held a two-hour video conference on the situation.\", \"After the meeting, Mr. Putin repeated his contention that NATO expansion to Ukraine would pose a grave threat to Russia, and that \\u201cit would be criminal negligence on our part\\u201d not to seek to stop it.\", \"\\u201cRussia carries out a peace-loving foreign policy, but it has the right to assure its own security,\\u201d Mr. Putin said at a news conference in Sochi. \\u201cWe assume that this time, at least, our concerns will be heard.\\u201d\", \"He spoke about discussion, not invasion. Russia would present proposals to Washington about a security dialogue in the next week, he said, adding: \\u201cWe have the chance to continue this dialogue. I believe that this is the most important thing.\\u201d\", \"Over the past generation, a dozen countries that were once part of the Soviet bloc have joined NATO, moving its boundaries hundreds of miles eastward \\u2014 expansions that Moscow has taken as aggressive moves by a potential enemy.\", \"Given the promise of membership, Mr. Putin sees \\u201cencirclement\\u201d and a still-expansionist NATO that is committed to ripping Ukraine away from the Russian zone of influence. That is a particularly difficult blow for a man who saw the breakup of the Soviet Union as \\u201cthe greatest geopolitical catastrophe\\u2019\\u2019 of the last century, and has focused on rebuilding and reasserting Russian power.\", \"Mr. Putin regards Ukraine, where the medieval Russian state was born, as a fake country and an \\u201cinalienable part of Russia.\\u201d He laid out his views in a long essay in July, \\u201cOn the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians.\\u201d\", \"Rightly or wrongly, he \\u201cincreasingly views Ukraine as a Western aircraft carrier parked just across from Rostov Oblast in southern Russia,\\u201d wrote Eugene Rumer and Andrew S. Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment, noting that Ukraine is now one of the largest recipients of American military aid.\", \"So far, Mr. Putin\\u2019s attempts to restore Russian control over Ukraine have backfired. In 2014, after a Ukrainian revolt that caused its pro-Russian president, Viktor F. Yanukovych, to flee, Mr. Putin invaded and annexed Crimea and aided a separatist war in eastern Ukraine that continues to this day.\", \"\\u201cPutin is not being provoked by NATO, he\\u2019s provoked by the independence of Ukraine,\\u201d Mr. Daalder said. \\u201cBut he\\u2019s made it less likely that Ukraine will ever do what he wants because of his actions. Ukraine is more pro-Western and more Ukrainian, and less Russian, as a result of what Putin did in 2014.\\u201d\", \"In Ukraine\\u2019s 2019 elections, pro-Russian candidates were crushed. Mr. Putin runs the risk that invading Ukraine, rather than producing the submissive neighbor he wants, would, as many believe, simply reinforce Ukraine\\u2019s desire to remain independent.\", \"After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, some in the West suggested NATO disband as well. Instead, it expanded, and once it began, \\u201cit was hard to know when to stop,\\u201d said Lawrence Freedman, emeritus professor of war studies at King\\u2019s College London and author of \\u201cUkraine and the Art of Strategy.\\u201d Of course, he noted, the expansion was in response to the desires of the countries of the former Soviet bloc.\", \"It would have been better, Mr. Freedman suggested, if NATO had \\u201cfound other ways to support Georgia and Ukraine\\u201d and not promised membership. Most likely Ukraine will never be integrated into NATO, he said, \\u201cbut we can\\u2019t put that into a treaty,\\u201d as Mr. Putin demands.\", \"Still, it may be easier to grant Mr. Putin the discussion he says he wants on the future of European security if it eases Russian fears, Mr. Freedman said. \\u201cFine, let\\u2019s have a big conference, it could go on for years. Talking to Putin is not a concession.\\u2019\\u2019\", \"But NATO\\u2019s \\u201ccardinal sin,\\u201d as Mr. Daalder put it, was the undefined promise made to Ukraine and Georgia in Bucharest in April 2008, the result of a late-night compromise reached by former President George W. Bush when other NATO members, like Germany and France, rejected his proposal to offer the two countries a concrete and immediate road map to membership.\", \"\\u201cThe Bucharest compromise was the worst of both worlds,\\u2019\\u2019 said Carl Bildt, the former Swedish prime minister and foreign minister. \\u201cIt created expectations that were not fulfilled and fears that are grossly exaggerated. It was short-term expediency with long-term consequences that we have seen since then\\u2019\\u2019 \\u2014 in Georgia, which lost a quick and nasty war to Russia four months later in 2008, and in the Russian effort to destabilize and even reassert control over Ukraine.\", \"Fiona Hill, a Russian expert at the Brookings Institution, was at the Bucharest summit as an American national intelligence officer, but the recommendation of the intelligence community against offering a membership road map to Ukraine and Georgia, because much of NATO opposed it, was overridden by Mr. Bush, who had promised both leaders that he would push for one, she said.\", \"The compromise was brokered by the British, she said, but \\u201cit was the worst of all possible outcomes.\\u201d Mr. Putin, she said, \\u201chas been trying to shut that door ever since.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"53b63984586011ec831269fcd7873aa7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"53b63984586011ec831269fcd7873aa7"}},
