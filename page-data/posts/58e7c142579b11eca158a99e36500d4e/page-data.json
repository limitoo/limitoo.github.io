The American livestream on the World Curling Federation website could not be accessed due to \\\"an ongoing sponsor rights issue.\\\" Despite no products being on the ice and having a non-explicit logo, local organizers were told that the company's sponsorship would be inappropriate for American audiences.\", \"On Sunday, USA Curling tweeted that \\\"an unforeseen sponsorship conflict with the local organizing committee\\\" caused the broadcast to be suspended. It is unclear who was responsible for the ultimate pulling; NBC, the network contracted to air the upcoming Olympics, was not available to comment, according to the AP.\", \"EasyToys, which bills itself as \\\"the market leader\\\" of sex toys in the Netherlands and Belgium, was already determined as a sponsor weeks before the broadcast was pulled, said promotor Dagmar van Stiphout.

This section of the surface is critical due to the fact that it says where players are supposed to let go of their stone.\", \"While this setback might be disappointing for American curling fans, van Stiphout said that the show will go on.\", \"\\\"Of course it's a pity that it's happening now,\\\" he said. \\\"We will go on with the tournament.
