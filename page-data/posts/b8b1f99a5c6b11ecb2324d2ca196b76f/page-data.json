Cloobeck, the commission's chairman, dubbed the rule \\\"Nathan's Law.\\\" He said the rule is \\\"warranted and necessary.\\\"\", \"The rule would require medical personnel at any fights of this nature, as well as give the commission authority over aspects such as referee requirements, insurance, promotion, permits and weigh-ins.\", \"\\\"We are the leader. We're setting the standard,\\\" Cloobeck said. \\\"Hopefully everyone will follow.\\\"\", \"The original commission ruling against unarmed combat did not cover events involving students from schools, universities, colleges and organizations associated with them. Now, the rule would require written permission for a charity fight.\", \"Commissioner Anthony Marnell said this rule is important to \\\"push this message ... out there.\\\"\", \"\\\"It's disturbing and heartbreaking that different entities find unarmed combat to be something of fun and ... entertainment,\\\" Marnell said. \\\"I don't think people realize what this is, how dangerous this is, and it's not appropriate in any way without major oversight, regulation and approval from people who know what they are doing.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950880/unarmed-combat-fist-fight.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Nevada Athletic Commission voted to expand its oversight of unarmed combat to charity fights following the death of college student Nathan Valencia.
