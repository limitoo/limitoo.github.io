Five thieves steal $20,000 in products from an Ulta Beauty store in Pennsylvania in just 40 seconds. A security guard is fatally shot in Oakland, Calif., while working with a local television news crew reporting about a recent retail robbery by a group of thieves.\", \"Theft is an ever-present issue for retailers. As much as $68.9 billion of products were stolen from retailers in 2019, according to one industry group. But it has become more visible, brazen and violent in recent months, forcing an industry already buffeted by pandemic lockdowns and fights over mask requirements to deal with a new problem.\", \"\\u201cThis level of violence has taken it to a whole new level,\\u201d said Rachel Michelin, president of the California Retailers Association. \\u201cNo one has seen this before.\\u201d\", \"Luxury retailers in Union Square in San Francisco \\u2014 the site of several high-profile robberies this year \\u2014 have boarded up windows to prevent more mayhem. Best Buy warned last week that theft was lowering profit margins and said it was using QR codes for checkout in some areas so employees did not need to unlock items right away. Home Depot has \\u201chardened\\u201d its stores, putting power tools and other valuables out of reach and advising employees not to film robberies with their phones because it could escalate the situation.\", \"\\u201cIt has become second nature to take out your phone and record something when it happens,\\u201d said Scott Glenn, vice president of asset protection at Home Depot. \\u201cBut these people are getting violent.\\u201d\", \"Retail executives and security experts link the thefts to a confluence of factors, but primarily the ease with which thieves have been able to resell stolen goods on internet marketplaces like Amazon and Facebook.\", \"But even industry veterans, who have been tracking generations of shoplifters, have been stunned by the methods and mind-set of the thieves, saying they reflect a sense of impunity.\", \"Some recent robberies \\u2014 in which large groups rush into a store, overwhelm employees and flee in cars before the police can respond \\u2014 recall the looting that occurred across the country amid protests after the murder of George Floyd in May 2020. At that time, people took advantage of police departments stretched by the protests and ransacked hundreds of stores, including the Macy\\u2019s in Herald Square and many smaller retailers, causing millions of dollars in damage.\", \"As tensions flared across the nation, major retailers like Nordstrom and Target would not discuss the extent of damage to their stores or how many they had to close during protests, instead focusing on their empathy for the demonstrators. The designer Marc Jacobs wrote on Instagram: \\u201cNEVER let them convince you that broken glass or property is violence,\\u201d adding, \\u201cProperty can be replaced, human lives CANNOT.\\u201d\", \"With the unrest subsided, retailers are less reluctant to talk publicly about theft. \\u201cLooting in general started during civil unrest, and it has now evolved,\\u201d said Ben Dugan, president of the Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail, a trade group focused on crime at retailers. \\u201cCriminal organizations saw during civil unrest that they were able to get their hands on millions of dollars of stolen product very quickly.\\u201d\", \"The rise in thefts comes as punishments for retail theft have been broadly eased over the past decade.\", \"Since 2005, 30 states have increased the dollar threshold for theft offenses, which effectively means that fewer people are going to jail for smaller thefts, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. More than half the states now have a felony theft threshold of $1,000 or more.\", \"The theft laws were changed to help reduce incarceration rates across the country, and some studies have found that the lower penalties have not led to more crime. And many of the most brazen crimes committed around Thanksgiving far exceeded the $1,000 threshold.\", \"Still, the thefts are being politicized, with some leaders saying they show the failure of decriminalization efforts. Others worry that the recent crimes could be used as a pretext to ratchet up penalties and incarceration rates again.\", \"Some industry experts say the problem is not necessarily the laws but the lack of enforcement by the police and prosecutors, which emboldens enterprising thieves. A big priority, they say, should be breaking up the criminal organizations directing and profiting the most from the thefts.\", \"Ms. Michelin, the head of the California retail trade group, has been meeting with local prosecutors and the governor\\u2019s office, which has established a task force on organized retail crime, trying to raise the urgency of prosecuting these cases.\", \"\\u201cThe level of organized retail theft we are seeing is simply unacceptable,\\u201d Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said in a statement. \\u201cBusinesses and customers should feel safe while doing their holiday shopping.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Dugan, who has worked with a slew of major retailers and pharmacy chains like Walgreens, said that often, the people snatching items are paid small fees like $500 for each robbery, which then feed larger enterprises that resell the goods online. Typically, these robberies don\\u2019t involve large groups looting stores but, instead, are smaller thefts that build over time.\", \"In one recent case, a 70-year-old man in Atlanta paid recovering drug addicts to steal razors and health products from stores like Target, CVS and Publix and take them to his warehouse, according to court documents.\", \"The man, Robert Whitley, then sold the items online through businesses called Closeout Express and Essential Daily Discounts. He sold more than 140,000 items on Amazon\\u2019s marketplace, totaling $3.5 million, according to federal prosecutors.\", \"Mr. Whitley\\u2019s lawyer said the thefts never involved violence. He said Mr. Whitley, who had struggled with drug addiction himself, ran support groups and provided shelter for others struggling with substance abuse.\", \"Mr. Whitley, who pleaded guilty to one count of interstate transportation of stolen property, was sentenced in October to nearly six years in federal prison. His daughter, Noni Whitley, who was accused of being part of the illegal operation, was sentenced to five years.\", \"Similar cases have occurred from Katy, Texas, to Charlotte, N.C., and help explain why, in many big-box chains and drugstores around the country, items like teeth-whitening strips and razor blades are increasingly being put behind lock and key.\", \"Stolen goods used to show up at flea markets and pawnshops, but that has changed in recent years. One of the biggest issues that brick-and-mortar retailers have been grappling with is the rapid growth of online marketplaces where anyone can easily sell goods, often anonymously.\", \"\\u201cAmazon, eBay, Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, Etsy \\u2014 all of those are utilized by illicit online sellers, and they\\u2019re allowed to get away with it because the illicit sellers are allowed to operate with anonymity on the internet,\\u201d Mr. Dugan said. \\u201cThey don\\u2019t have to list their real name or real address or location or their real banking information. So no one is concerned about being caught if they\\u2019re not even using their real name.\\u201d\", \"Consumers are often unaware of the provenance of items they\\u2019re buying, but issues can emerge with products like baby formula, which can be expired or otherwise compromised when stolen.\", \"The anonymity reflects yet another instance in which criminals stymied by rules in the physical world can operate freely on the internet \\u2014 an issue that has surfaced in problems involving misinformation, questionable advertisements and merchandise glorifying crimes.\", \"Pawnshops, for example, are regulated in almost every state, said Richard Rossman, a sergeant with the Broward County Sheriff\\u2019s Office in Florida who is also part of the Coalition of Law Enforcement and Retail.\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re going to sell an item to a pawnshop, the seller has to pledge that property is his or hers, it is not stolen, and the pawnshop documents the item appropriately on a state-regulated form and we can hold the seller accountable and the pawnshop accountable,\\u201d Sergeant Rossman said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no mechanism in place right now that requires the collection of that data on the online marketplaces.\\u201d\", \"The coalition has gotten support from industry groups and retailers, including pharmacy chains, Home Depot and Ulta Beauty, on bipartisan legislation known as the INFORM Consumers Act. The bill would require online marketplaces to authenticate the identity of \\u201chigh-volume third-party sellers,\\u201d including their bank account information and tax identification, and allow consumers to see basic identification and contact information for those sellers. The rule would apply to vendors who made 200 or more discrete sales in a year amounting to $5,000 or more.\", \"Etsy, OfferUp and eBay said they supported the legislation after opposing a draft that raised privacy and safety concerns for sellers, especially people selling small-scale items like a couch or people with craft businesses at home. Etsy noted that mass-produced items were not usually allowed on its marketplace, even if they were being sold legitimately. Meta, which owns Facebook Marketplace, and the RealReal, which sells high-end secondhand goods, declined to comment on the legislation.\", \"Meta said that Facebook Marketplace users could report items they thought were stolen and that law enforcement could contact the company regarding suspicious items.\", \"Amazon said in a statement that \\u201cwe regularly request invoices, purchase orders or other proofs of sourcing when we have concerns about how a seller may have obtained particular products that they want to sell.\\u201d It added that it employed 10,000 people working to prevent fraud and abuse on its site, and supported the INFORM Consumers Act.\", \"Several marketplaces said they shared product information with LeadsOnline, a database that law enforcement can use to search for specific items on their sites. Nathan Garnett, general counsel of OfferUp, said that the site had methods for proactively identifying suspicious items but that catching lawbreakers could be challenging.\", \"\\u201cWhether or not we catch it is going to be somewhat dependent on how smart they are, because one account that posts dozens or hundreds of, say, brand-new power tools, we\\u2019re going to flag that as being pretty suspicious and action that pretty quickly,\\u201d Mr. Garnett said. \\u201cBut if you only post one or two things, that could be anybody.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"92dbc65e542011ec8c12353a0c15982c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"92dbc65e542011ec8c12353a0c15982c"}},
