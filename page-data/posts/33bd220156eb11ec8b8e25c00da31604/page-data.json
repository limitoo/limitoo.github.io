As of Monday, Hochul said no new cases of the COVID-19 Omicron variant had been detected in New York since the eighth positive case of the variant was confirmed in New York last week. Even so, the governor noted that reporting delays can occur over weekends and said officials were awaiting additional information about the variant from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other health officials.\", \"A couple of hours after the press conference, Hochul said on Twitter that four additional COVID-19 cases of the Omicron variant had been detected in New York.\", \"The Omicron variant was first reported to the World Health Organization on November 24 and identified as a \\\"variant of concern\\\" two days later.\", \"The first Omicron variant case in the U.S. was identified in California last week.
