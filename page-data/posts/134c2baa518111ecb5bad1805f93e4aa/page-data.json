Wade could be overturned, the American right has become obsessed with bodily autonomy and has adopted the slogan \\u201cMy body, my choice\\u201d about Covid vaccines and mask mandates.\", \"Feminists have always known that if men \\u2014 or at any rate cis men \\u2014 could get pregnant, abortion would be a nonissue. The furious conservative reaction to Covid mitigation measures demonstrates this more than any hypothetical ever could. Many on the right, we can now see, believe it\\u2019s tyranny to be told to put something they don\\u2019t want on or in their bodies in order to save lives.\", \"There is, to be fair, at least one prominent illiberal conservative, Harvard\\u2019s Adrian Vermeule, who has defended vaccine mandates, writing, \\u201cEven our physical liberties are rightly ordered to the common good of the community when necessary.\\u201d More typical on the right, however, is a paranoid sense that the vaccines are tied up with occult forces of social control.\", \"In \\u201cWhy I Didn\\u2019t Get the Covid Vaccine,\\u201d an essay in the Catholic anti-abortion journal First Things, the theologian Peter Leithart quotes a book called \\u201cThe Great Covid Panic\\u201d: \\u201cA very effective way to dominate people is to convince them they are sinful unless they obey.\\u201d He invokes totalitarian \\u201cbiopolitical regimes\\u201d that seek to exercise power over the body: \\u201cOnce upon a time, the ruler bore a sword; now, a syringe,\\u201d he writes.\", \"Of course, many American women will soon be faced with an infinitely more invasive form of biopolitical control, courtesy of First Things\\u2019 allies. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear oral arguments in Dobbs v. Jackson Women\\u2019s Health Organization, a case dealing with Mississippi\\u2019s ban on abortions after 15 weeks. It\\u2019s possible that the justices could gut Roe without overturning it outright, but after they let Texas\\u2019 abortion bounty law stand, at least for the time being, I\\u2019m expecting the worst. If Roe is tossed out, most abortions will instantly become illegal in at least 12 states, and they will be severely restricted in others.\", \"We are seeing a preview of what this world will look like in Texas, whose six-week abortion ban remains in effect. There are no exceptions for rape and incest. Women with wanted pregnancies that go tragically wrong have to either cross state lines for treatment or wait until their lives are in immediate danger. \\u201cMany doctors say they are unable to discuss the procedure as an option until the patient\\u2019s condition deteriorates and her life is at risk,\\u201d The New York Times reports.\", \"It\\u2019s striking, the gap between the bodily impositions people on the right will accept in their own lives and those they would impose on others. When it comes to themselves, many conservatives find any encroachment on their physical sovereignty intolerable, and arguments about the common good irrelevant. Yet their movement is dragging us into a future where many women will be stripped of self-determination the moment they get pregnant. Choices, it seems, aren\\u2019t for everybody.\", \"As the feminist Ellen Willis once put it, the central question in the abortion debate is not whether a fetus is a person, but whether a woman is. People, in our society, generally do not have their bodies appropriated by the state. It\\u2019s unimaginable that they would be forced to, say, donate blood. As we\\u2019ve seen, even mask and vaccine requirements elicit mass umbrage. Americans tend to believe that their bodies are inviolate.\", \"\\u201cYou can\\u2019t make a case against abortion by applying a general principle about everybody\\u2019s human rights; you have to show exactly the opposite \\u2014 that the relationship between fetus and pregnant woman is an exception, one that justifies depriving women of their right to bodily integrity,\\u201d Willis wrote in 1985. To ban abortion is to say that pregnant women are not entitled to the authority over their physical selves that other adults expect and demand.\", \"Mississippi\\u2019s attorney general, Lynn Fitch, who will defend her state\\u2019s ban before the Supreme Court on Wednesday, has also filed three lawsuits against President Biden\\u2019s vaccine mandates. On Nov. 12, a federal appeals court stayed one of them, the mandate dealing with companies that have over 100 employees. Judge Kurt D. Engelhardt, a Trump appointee, wrote that the public interest is \\u201cserved by maintaining our constitutional structure and maintaining the liberty of individuals to make intensely personal decisions according to their own convictions \\u2014 even, or perhaps particularly, when those decisions frustrate government officials.\\u201d\", \"Engelhardt, a former member of Louisiana Lawyers for Life, obviously doesn\\u2019t believe that all individuals should have the liberty to make \\u201cintensely personal decisions according to their own convictions.\\u201d But that doesn\\u2019t mean he\\u2019s a hypocrite. He simply appears to believe, as much of the modern right does, that there are some people who should be subject to total physical coercion, and some who should be subject to none at all.\"]","href_hash":"134c2baa518111ecb5bad1805f93e4aa"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"134c2baa518111ecb5bad1805f93e4aa"}},
