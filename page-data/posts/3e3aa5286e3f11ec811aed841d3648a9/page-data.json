Rudely, this used to be called a \\u201cgeriatric pregnancy,\\u201d but that term is thankfully now out of fashion. In my head, my 35th birthday was some kind of Cinderella clock, but instead of my coach turning back into a pumpkin, it had me imagining that my eggs would shrivel up and die.\", \"I had my first kid at 30, and I was anxious to have my second before that 35-year-old deadline. I was concerned that it would be more difficult to get pregnant after that and my pregnancy would be much riskier. I had a miscarriage at 32 and had a not-insignificant amount of stress about getting pregnant again as soon as possible. It would take about a year before I conceived, and I had my second child at 34 and precisely 4 months.\", \"Considering how much stock I put in 35 as a marker, I was intrigued reading a new study from researchers at Harvard that suggests that women who are just over 35 may have slightly better pregnancy outcomes than women just under 35.\", \"As Jessica Cohen, an associate professor of global health at Harvard\\u2019s T.H. Chan School of Public Health and a co-author of the study, told me, the choice of 35 as the cutoff for advanced maternal age was somewhat arbitrary in the first place. \\u201cAge 35 became a guideline in the \\u201970s for when to offer invasive genetic testing for Down syndrome,\\u201d she explained. After that, \\u201cage 35 became a guideline for a bunch of other things, and not really necessarily based on anything. Your risk of Down, your risk of stillbirth, pre-eclampsia \\u2014 none of those change abruptly at 35,\\u201d she said.\", \"Cohen noticed that she received subtly different treatment for the pregnancy she had before 35 and the one she had after that age. For example, during both her pregnancies, her blood pressure started creeping up above normal toward the end. When she was under 35, her health care providers just checked her blood pressure more regularly, but when she was over 35, she got an ultrasound, an amniotic fluid check and a nonstress test.\", \"While Cohen noted that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists does not explicitly say to do a certain set of tests once a woman is over 35, \\u201cthe age influences what the provider recommends,\\u201d and it affects what kinds of testing insurance companies might pay for.\", \"Because she\\u2019s an economist, Cohen said, she looks for natural experiments, and so with her colleagues she looked at over 50,000 pregnancies by using data from a large commercial insurer. About half of the women included in the study were 34.7 to 34.9 years old, and about half were 35.0 to 35.3 years old at the expected date of delivery.\", \"The study found that women over 35 received more maternal-fetal medicine visits, more ultrasounds and more antepartum surveillance. There was also a 0.39 percentage point decline in perinatal mortality (defined in this study as a fetal death at or after 28 weeks\\u2019 gestation or an infant death up to a week postpartum). But the study found no significant difference in maternal mortality, preterm birth or low birth weight.\", \"The takeaway isn\\u2019t that every pregnant person who\\u2019s just under 35 also needs more ultrasounds or more doctor visits, Cohen said. And it certainly isn\\u2019t that age doesn\\u2019t matter at all; fertility does decline over time, and maternal age may be a factor for certain conditions. Rather, the takeaway is that there\\u2019s nothing magical about age 35. \\u201cA lot of our prenatal care management is relics and risk aversions,\\u201d she said, and it should be based on more precise evidence.\", \"Just as age 35 was somewhat arbitrarily designated as \\u201cadvanced maternal age,\\u201d the number of prenatal visits that women received up until the Covid pandemic began was based on a schedule that was established in 1930 \\u201cwithout supporting evidence,\\u201d according to a 2020 paper published in The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The pandemic turned out to be another natural experiment in prenatal care, with experts reassessing whether all pregnant people need the 12 to 14 in-person office visits they may have been getting prepandemic.\", \"What we should be aiming for is what experts call right-sized prenatal care, which means the right amount of care for each person. Right-sized care incorporates medical as well as psychological wellness and also the need for additional social supports. Neel Shah, an assistant professor at Harvard Medical School and the chief medical officer of Maven Clinic, has researched right-sized maternity care and told me, \\u201cWe need to improve the precision in the way we manage people, which is the thing that medicine, surprisingly, has not invested in.\\u201d\", \"According to a study co-written by Shah, \\u201cBy our back-of-the-envelope calculation, for a patient participating in routine prenatal care, the full complement of 12 to 14 visits \\u2014 including travel time, parking and additional laboratory testing and imaging \\u2014 equates to almost one full week of missed work or child care, before integrating additional psychosocial support. This may be too much care for some, not enough for others and the wrong kind of care for patients with diverse support needs.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s unclear if a specific aspect of care is leading to better outcomes for women just over 35, Cohen said, and her study doesn\\u2019t drill down on that. It was primarily concerned with what was happening for mothers around age 35 and babies, rather than why. \\u201cIt may have to do with taking women\\u2019s concerns more seriously at the end of pregnancy, if you\\u2019re feeling something\\u2019s not right,\\u201d she speculated. Which seems like the kind of right-sized care every mother, and child, deserves, no matter her age.\", \"If you want a chance to get your Tiny Victory published, find us on Instagram @NYTparenting and use the hashtag #tinyvictories; email us; or enter your Tiny Victory at the bottom of this page.
