Finally, these same government officials flooded the ... states with millions of ballots.\\\"\", \"The complaint asked the Supreme Court to extend the deadline for the electoral college's meeting, set by law for December 14. A letter signed by 126 members of Congress supported the filing.\", \"President Trump called it \\\"the Big One.\\\" He again tweeted: \\\"... It is much easier for the Supreme Court of the United States to follow the Constitution and do what everybody knows has to be done. They must show great Courage & Wisdom. Save the USA!!!\\\"\", \"In Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and Georgia, the Attorneys General issued statements denouncing the Texas filing, the Democrats calling the filing an attempt to \\\"mislead the public and tear at the fabric of our Constitution.\\\" The Republican Attorney General for Georgia called the filing \\\"constitutionally, legally and factually wrong.\\\"\", \"Three days later, the Supreme Court again perfunctorily dismissed the Texas lawsuit. One state could not object to how another state conducted its elections.\", \"The unsigned order said. \\\"The State of Texas's motion for leave to fill a bill of complaint is denied for lack of standing under Article III of the Constitution.\\\"\", \"President Trump tweeted: \\\"It is a legal disgrace, an embarrassment to the USA!!!\\\"\", \"Trump had personally appointed three of the nine members of the Court and now he was mad that none of them paid him back.

But maybe Trump's own representatives didn't actually believe the legal argument and were operating only out of self-interest. \\\"It was necessary and productive to support Trump's asinine and hopeless suit because Trump had mustered so much support among so many voters with no interest in or capacity for empirical reasoning, or, at least, who were preoccupied with other issues.\\\"\", \"Whatever their motivation, more than 100 members of Congress and numerous state officials supported Donald Trump's crusade. Election denial was spreading, even if the transition itself was limping forward.\", \"On December 8, Republicans voted to reject a motion offered by House Majority Leader Steny H. Hoyer (D-MD) that the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies move forward with the assumption that the January 20 inauguration was for President-elect Joe Biden. Sen.
