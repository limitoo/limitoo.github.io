Can a new, more nuanced version make a comedy of middle-aged ones?","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-03T02:35:26.000Z","content":"[\"When we last left the ladies of \\u201cSex and the City,\\u201d the pathbreaking, cupcake-inspiring HBO series and film franchise, Miranda had joined a new law firm, Samantha had achieved orgasm atop a Mercedes G-Class SUV, Charlotte was hosting a child\\u2019s birthday party, and Carrie and Big were snuggling on the sofa as a black-and-white movie played, a happily ever after for everyone.\", \"This was the peaceable close of \\u201cSex and the City 2,\\u201d the strained 2010 movie that sent its characters into the Middle East and critics into ecstasies of disdain. (Here is A.O. Scott\\u2019s comparatively mild pan in The Times: \\u201cYour watch will tell you that a shade less than two and a half hours have elapsed, but you may be shocked at just how much older you feel when the whole thing is over.\\u201d) Still, another movie was planned, only to fall apart, largely on Twitter, in 2017. Like a Fendi baguette, the series seemed to have gone out of style.\", \"But the \\u201990s are extremely on trend right now, and the women of \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d (well, most of them) have returned for another strut down the premium cable runway. \\u201cAnd Just Like That,\\u201d a 10-episode limited series, premieres on HBO Max on Dec. 9. Don\\u2019t call it a reboot! The characters so rarely wore boots!\", \"Like the original, this new version follows the author Carrie (Sarah Jessica Parker), the lawyer Miranda (Cynthia Nixon) and the former gallerista and current homemaker Charlotte (Kristin Davis). But in the place of Kim Cattrall\\u2019s libertine Samantha are four new actors: Sarita Choudhury, Nicole Ari Parker, Karen Pittman and Sara Ram\\u00edrez. Their presence remedies the original\\u2019s blinding whiteness, though if the promotional materials are any indication, not its appetitive glamour and unacknowledged privilege.\", \"So here\\u2019s a question for Carrie: Can a show adapt to changed characters and changing times while still supplying what fans loved about the original?\", \"On break from a shoot at Brooklyn\\u2019s Steiner Studios, Michael Patrick King, a \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d executive producer and the showrunner of \\u201cAnd Just Like That,\\u201d had an enthusiastic answer. \\u201cIt\\u2019s dangerous. It\\u2019s exciting. It\\u2019s a challenge,\\u201d he said, bent forward on the sofa in his office. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not a cash cow. It\\u2019s not a cash in.\\u201d Besides how else could he get a show about middle-aged women greenlighted?\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think that anybody would take on new women characters at 55 without proof that people will watch,\\u201d he said. Which means that ladies might have some new paths to break, if they can walk them in heels.\", \"The original \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d was always two shows. One was a fidgety, philosophical comedy about single, successful women who didn\\u2019t need a man to complete them. Or maybe they did? And really, what is completion anyway? The other was the show as fans received it \\u2014 and the show that it arguably became \\u2014 a high-gloss romantic comedy and a fashion romp. What, you think it was the existential crises that motivated the bus tours?\", \"That latter show had long ago reached its conclusion. Because in a romantic comedy, once the girl gets the guy \\u2014 or as in Samantha\\u2019s case, the many guys \\u2014 where can the story really go? This structural roadblock explains why the second movie spun its wheels. (Those wheels were camels, which King now somewhat regrets.) So it seemed destined to live on only in reruns, rewatches and Instagram accounts devoted to its outfits.\", \"But early into New York City\\u2019s pandemic lockdown, King and Parker began to chat about making a behind-the-scenes podcast. At some point, those chats turned more imaginative, speculating about what the lives of the characters might look like now. As Parker, speaking by telephone from the set of another sequel, \\u201cHocus Pocus 2,\\u201d put it, they began to ask themselves, \\u201cWhy are we not thinking about the thing that we\\u2019ve touched on many times, which is, are there more stories to tell?\\u201d\", \"Having already resolved the characters\\u2019 questions about marriage, partnership and children during the original series \\u2014 King maintains these weren\\u2019t the relevant questions, but few plot lines centered on anything else \\u2014 the new show claims to look elsewhere and largely inward, just as the first series did in its early seasons. Parker ran down a few of the current interrogations: \\u201cWho am I? What will change do to me? Can I change? How do I react to big change?\\u201d\", \"The show has undergone changes big and small \\u2014 some thematic, some aesthetic, many structural. King recalled that during the first series, he felt as though he had to tie up each episode with a little bow, a concession to an audience that might not view them sequentially.\", \"\\u201cStreaming is like, untie the bow,\\u201d he said. \\u201cUntie it.\\u201d\", \"That doesn\\u2019t mean that \\u201cAnd Just Like That\\u201d encompasses much mess. During my visit to Steiner Studios, where I felt extremely underdressed, King took me around the various sets, each immaculate. Miranda\\u2019s Brooklyn brownstone and Charlotte\\u2019s Park Avenue palace have each received glow-ups. Carrie\\u2019s old apartment has lilac paint and statement wallpaper now. Her closet? Sublime.\", \"So Carrie still has two apartments, but \\u201cAnd Just Like That\\u201dno longer centers her experience. The show has mostly done away with her voice-over, making way for dialogue for its four new main characters: Choudhury\\u2019s high-end real estate agent, Parker\\u2019s documentarian, Pittman\\u2019s professor and Ramirez\\u2019s podcast host.\", \"Why didn\\u2019t the show have more characters of color before? \\u201cIt was a show that was based on material that was very much of its time,\\u201d Sarah Jessica Parker said diplomatically, referring to Candace Bushnell\\u2019s New York Observer columns.\", \"Though Nixon has stuck with the franchise, she said she had been \\u201chorrified\\u201d by the lack of racial diversity during the show\\u2019s original run. Like Parker and Davis, she said that she insisted that the characters in this new version couldn\\u2019t function as trendy accessories for the original cast.\", \"\\u201cIn order to get great actors to do these parts, they would have to be not supporting us,\\u201d Nixon said. That meant also insuring that the writers\\u2019 room was staffed with several women of color and that their story lines followed these new characters even when Carrie, Miranda and Charlotte headed offscreen.\", \"\\u201cEach of the episodes, at this point, they\\u2019re all around 43 minutes,\\u201d King said. \\u201cBecause there\\u2019s seven fully realized people in it.\\u201d\", \"On the day I visited the set, I watched one of Nicole Ari Parker\\u2019s scenes. Dressed to the nines or maybe the tens, she performed a marital spat with her series husband, played by Christopher Jackson. A few days later on the phone, I asked her if she had seen the original series \\u2014 she had \\u2014 and if its overwhelming whiteness had bothered her.\", \"\\u201cA little bit,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut I wasn\\u2019t expecting \\u2018Sex and the City\\u2019 to be realistic.\\u201d She was talking to me while she shopped for shoes at Nordstrom, which seemed nicely on brand.\", \"\\u201cI mean, every now and then I felt sorry for them,\\u201d she said. \\u201cLike, if they had a Black girlfriend, they wouldn\\u2019t be having these problems.\\u201d But she appreciated how complex a character the show had created for her and that she wasn\\u2019t the only character of color.\", \"\\u201cThey understand that one Black friend is not going to cut it,\\u201d she said.\", \"Still, this new series shouldn\\u2019t be seen as a repudiation of the old one or even as a corrective to its oversights \\u2014 well, some its oversights. Sarah Jessica Parker knows that not everyone liked the original characters, Carrie in particular. This new show doesn\\u2019t aim to fix them.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t try to make a point of: \\u2018Look, they\\u2019re mature, they\\u2019re better, they\\u2019re smarter. See, they\\u2019re sorry for the things you didn\\u2019t like,\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s our best approach.\\u201d\", \"The occasional tutu aside, \\u201cAnd Just Like That\\u201d isn\\u2019t intended as fan service either. The series doesn\\u2019t pretend that the women haven\\u2019t moved on with their lives in the intervening years; it doesn\\u2019t deny that they have aged. When some first-look pictures and a teaser trailer emerged, social media briefly blew up with comments about the women\\u2019s looks and the cosmetic interventions they had or hadn\\u2019t undergone.\", \"\\u201cAnd Just Like That\\u201d has several scenes that discuss these issues directly. King mimed a bit involving Nixon\\u2019s Miranda and her neck. Generally, it aims for stories about women in their 50s as rich and bright and complicated, if not as raunchy, as the ones the original told about women in their 30s. (Same city. Less sex.) Which is to say that it\\u2019s trying for just a little more nuance than \\u201cThe Golden Girls.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI am a woman in my 50s, so I am well aware that your life does not end whether you find a guy or a girl or not, whether you have kids or not, right?\\u201d Davis said. \\u201cWe can testify to the fact that it\\u2019s not over, and it\\u2019s not boring. So I was never in doubt that we could tell interesting stories.\\u201d\", \"What those stories were, no one would spoil. Eager fans have analyzed that 30-second teaser clip with the exegetical rigor typically reserved for ancient hieroglyphs. So here is what I did learn: Big (Chris Noth) is not dead. Samantha is not dead, though Cattrall\\u2019s absence means that she doesn\\u2019t appear onscreen.\", \"\\u201cNobody\\u2019s dead,\\u201d King said. Nobody? \\u201cNobody.\\u201d\", \"And yet, Willie Garson, who played Carrie\\u2019s gay best friend, Stanford Blatch, died during the filming of \\u201cAnd Just Like That,\\u201d a sad reminder of time\\u2019s passage and the grief it can bring. His death wasn\\u2019t written into the show.\", \"\\u201cBecause it wasn\\u2019t charming,\\u201d King said. \\u201cAnd I knew that the audience would know.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAnd Just Like That\\u201d wants to charm. It isn\\u2019t the first comedy about middle-aged women. Since \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d ended, television has offered \\u201cCougartown,\\u201d \\u201cHot in Cleveland,\\u201d \\u201cYounger.\\u201d September brought Julie Delpy\\u2019s \\u201cOn the Verge.\\u201d But a few statement necklaces aside, none of those shows had quite the glamour of \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d and none were quite as revolutionary \\u2014 in the frankness of the sex talk, in the insistence on female subjectivity, in the championing of single women, even if it did pair just about all of them off.\", \"Will \\u201cAnd Just Like That\\u201d exert the same cultural, fashion-forward influence, even in a culture obsessed with youth, even in a world glutted with content? King, predictably but not unreasonably, argues that it might.\", \"\\u201cIf it was aspirational \\u2014 aspirational apartments, aspirational clothing, aspirational people \\u2014 it\\u2019s still aspirational,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"96ad5231542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"96ad5231542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}},
