This has been a true Australian national effort.\\\"\", \"While vaccinations remain voluntary on the federal level, Australia's states and territories introduced mandatory measures for many occupations and workers. The unvaccinated are barred from many activities, such as dining out or concerts.\", \"On Monday, Australia eased international border curbs for the first time during the pandemic, but only for vaccinated people from highly inoculated states.\", \"Media said about 3000 people gathered for a peaceful protest against vaccine mandate protests in Melbourne, the capital of the southeastern state of Victoria, which spent nearly nine months in six lockdowns through the pandemic.\", \"Australia has seen frequent, occasionally violent anti-vaccine rallies during the past few months, but the movement remains small, with polls showing the numbers of those who oppose vaccinations are in the single digits across the nation.\", \"The nationwide vaccination figure incorporates some uneven levels, however.\", \"Nearly 90 percent of eligible people have been fully vaccinated in the most populous state of New South Wales, and almost 95 percent in the capital Canberra, but this figure drops to just 65 percent in the sparsely populated Northern Territory and Western Australia.\", \"The country recorded 1558 infections and 10 deaths on Saturday, with the majority of infections in Victoria. Some parts of the Northern Territory are in a snap, three-day lockdown after an outbreak grew to three cases.\", \"Despite the Delta outbreaks that led to months of lockdown in the two largest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, the national tally of fewer than 179,000 infections and 1587 deaths is far lower than that of many developed nations.\"]","href_hash":"052f5e9641f911ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"052f5e9641f911ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
