But, she said, \\u201call three of these defendants did everything they did based on assumptions. Not on facts, not on evidence \\u2014 on assumptions. And they made decisions in their driveways based on those assumptions that took a young man\\u2019s life. And that is why we\\u2019re here.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Dunikoski walked the jurors through the details of the afternoon of Feb. 23, 2020.\", \"She said that Mr. Arbery, an avid runner, had gone into a house under construction in the Satilla Shores subdivision, outside of Brunswick, Ga., and noted that he had been recorded on video cameras inside the house numerous times before. But there was no evidence that he ever took anything.\", \"The owner of the house, Larry English, had had some belongings stolen out of his boat, which was sometimes on the property. But Ms. Dunikoski said that Mr. English ended up suspecting a different man and woman \\u2014 who were also captured on video \\u2014 of those thefts.\", \"The three defendants had been concerned about neighborhood break-ins. On Jan. 1, she noted, Travis McMichael\\u2019s handgun was stolen from his truck.\", \"Ms. Dunikoski argued to the jury that Gregory McMichael, Travis\\u2019s father and a fellow defendant, had merely seen Mr. Arbery running down the street after leaving Mr. English\\u2019s house. When asked by police later if Mr. Arbery had broken into the house, Mr. McMichael said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know.\\u201d He added, \\u201cMy intention was to stop this guy so that he could be arrested or be identified at the very least.\\u201d\", \"The prosecution\\u2019s assertion that none of the men had immediate knowledge that a crime was committed appears to be in anticipation of the likelihood that the defense will argue that the men were making a legal arrest under Georgia\\u2019s citizen\\u2019s arrest law, which was largely repealed by the state legislature after widespread outcry over Mr. Arbery\\u2019s killing. That law previously stated that a private person may arrest someone \\u201cif the offense is committed in his presence or within his immediate knowledge.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Dunikoski also described in detail how the two McMichaels and the third defendant, their neighbor William Bryan, chased Mr. Arbery for five minutes as he ran through their neighborhood, trying to evade them \\u2014 the McMichaels in one pickup truck and Mr. Bryan in another. She said that in the midst of the chase, Travis McMichael stopped and asked Mr. Arbery, \\u201cWhere you running from? What are you doing?\\u201d Mr. Arbery ignored him.\", \"At some point during the pursuit, she said, Gregory McMichael, who was armed with a handgun, said to Mr. Arbery, \\u201cStop or I\\u2019ll blow your fucking head off,\\u201d language, she said, that indicated an intent to harm Mr. Arbery, not simply talk to him.\", \"She said that Mr. Bryan tried to hit Mr. Arbery four times with his pickup truck, at one point forcing him into a ditch.\", \"And Ms. Dunikoski played the video that Mr. Bryan recorded on his cellphone, showing the moments when the two trucks had pinned Mr. Arbery in. She said that Gregory McMichael later claimed that Mr. Arbery had been \\u201ctrapped like a rat.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Dunikoski said the video showed Travis McMichael pointing the shotgun at Mr. Arbery as he ran toward the McMichaels\\u2019 truck. She noted that Travis McMichael had stepped out of the truck in one lane of the two-lane street, by the driver\\u2019s side door, with truck was blocking the second lane. The video shows Mr. Arbery running to the passenger side of the truck in attempt to evade him. The two men appear to meet head on in front of the truck. \", \"\\u201cWhat did McMichael do with that shotgun?\\u201d Ms. Dunikoski said. \\u201cHe stepped around that open door and moved toward Mr. Arbery. He\\u2019s got a shotgun and he\\u2019s moving toward him to intercept him.\\u201d\", \"Several shots are fired as the men struggle. Mr. Arbery falls to the ground after the last. \", \"Ms. Dunikoski said that in interviews with police, Travis McMichael said that Mr. Arbery attacked him and that he was acting in self-defense. But she also said that when police asked him if Mr. Arbery grabbed his shotgun, he said, \\u201cI want to say he did, but I honestly cannot remember.\\u201d\", \"The prosecutor asked the jury to find the men guilty on all of the counts on which they were indicted \\u2014 including malice murder, felony murder, aggravated assault and false imprisonment. \"]","href_hash":"d60892aa3e5d11ec8083837808427722"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d60892aa3e5d11ec8083837808427722"}},
