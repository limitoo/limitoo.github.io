Now suddenly the 17-year-old was training with top class players.\", \"\\\"The Blaze has a lot of White Ferns so it meant I had to be on point really all the time at training, you know bowling to the likes of Rachel Priest, Sophie Devine and Liz Perry.\\\"\", \"The timing was crucial - Kerr may well have given up cricket once she left college.\", \"\\\"It could have looked that way, who knows because my calves were pretty bad too. I'm just grateful that it happened when it did, even though I didn't play that first season the determination to play the year after for the Blaze was there.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/138030/eight_col_220129_SSmashFinalWomen_73.JPG?1644482924\\\" alt=\\\"Amelia and Jess Kerr have had a lot of success together with the Wellington Blaze.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nAmelia and Jess Kerr have had a lot of success together with the Wellington Blaze. \\nPhoto: \\u00a9 Copyright Andrew Cornaga 2022 / www.photosport.nz / Photosport Ltd\\n</div>\", \"When Kerr looks back, she's thankful she played more than just one sport growing up.\", \"\\\"As a kid I didn't absolutely love cricket but I enjoyed it enough to never fully give up and I had some really good role models around me with Dad [Robbie Kerr played for Wellington] and my Grandad [Bruce Murray] playing for New Zealand and also my sister.\", \"\\\"So I was always playing, whether it was backyard cricket or indoor or for my college. It meant I could keep my skills up and when I randomly made the Blaze squad that was just the little push I needed to then take it more seriously.\\\"\", \"Kerr hasn't looked back. She made her White Ferns debut in early 2020 and has become a key part of the bowling attack with her ability to swing the ball.\", \"It almost feels like Kerr burst onto the scene but there's more to it than that.\", \"She didn't go full throttle with cricket until she was older, because her early passion was running and injury kept putting her out of action.\", \"She believes the discipline she got from competing in running set her up well.\", \"\\\"I think that base of hard work and training every day with running has really helped with now being a contracted White Fern and the last two years I've been teaching full-time so I have to be really organised.\", \"\\\"The motivation is even higher now being surrounded by all these professional athletes is just really inspiring.\\\"\", \"To say Kerr has had her share of medical issues is an under-statement.\", \"When she was nine she was diagnosed with Bell's-palsy, a rare condition that results in one half of the face drooping.\", \"Kerr couldn't blink, couldn't drink out of a cup, and her smile wouldn't go up on one side.\", \"Her main concern was whether she could play sport that weekend.\", \"\\\"Half of my face was paralysed, I had an eye-patch on, and I still played football that weekend and ended up scoring the most goals I ever had.\\\"\", \"Most people make a full recovery within a year, but not Kerr.\", \"There were improvements and she was able to drop the eye patch but she still finds it hard to fall asleep some nights trying to get her eyes closed.\", \"Kerr said she's not insecure about having Bell's palsy, but does feel a little self conscious when she has her photo taken with people who don't know about her condition.\", \"Kerr said her family never made her feel any different and she was lucky to have friendships with people who liked her for who she was.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/138031/eight_col_200103BlazevSpirit_38.JPG?1644483088\\\" alt=\\\"White Ferns' captain Sophie Devine (left) and Jess Kerr.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nWhite Ferns' captain Sophie Devine (left) and Jess Kerr. \\nPhoto: \\u00c2\\u00a9 www.Photosport.nz 2020\\n</div>\", \"When Kerr was 13 she lost an alarming amount of weight and would get up five times in the night to go to the bathroom.\", \"After a few tests she was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes.\", \"By now running was her life and she burst into tears on hearing those words. The year before she had won the 800m and 1500m in her age group at the South Island Colgate Games.\", \"Kerr had to take a whole term off school, and ended up losing her vision for about a week. It threw her out of sport for a long time.\", \"Once she got the diabetes under control, Kerr started running again. She had to inject herself with insulin about seven times a day.\", \"Kerr learnt how to manage the diabetes and the following year she ran a Wellington age-group 3km track record.\", \"It's a bit easier for Kerr to manage her condition these days.\", \"\\\"Now I've got an insulin pump, which is attached on me essentially all the time, except when I am training. Now I only do one injection a day.\", \"\\\"You still need to try and make sure your levels are right constantly. Prior to and straight after training I'll be looking at my levels and there's days where it's not perfect.\\\"\", \"She said it helped that her White Ferns' captain Sophie Devine had the same condition.\", \"\\\"It's nice having someone else who just gets the lingo of it and understands what it feels like when you are low. You know you're not just being soft and needing a break.\", \"\\\"Hopefully young kids who are diagnosed with diabetes can see that you can still play sport and they won't give up on what they love doing, if that is sport.\\\"\", \"Kerr was 16 when her calves started hurting every time she ran.\", \"At that point she was doing middle distance running and her training included runs as long as 90 minutes.\", \"She was eventually diagnosed with compartment syndrome in her legs and had surgery.\", \"After months of rest and rehab she tried returning to the track but the surgery hadn't worked.\", \"\\\"I'm not one to give up on things easily so I would keep training and try my best and often sessions would end with me in agony or me being in tears.\", \"\\\"By then I was playing a bit more cricket and I saw the opportunities coming for cricket and I realised the pain and heartache of what I was going through with running just wasn't worth it anymore.\\\"\", \"She made the Blaze squad for a second year but ended up getting diagnosed with Popliteal Artery Entrapment Syndrome.\", \"\\\"The compartment syndrome is at the front of my legs and they say it's like shin splints but in the muscle.
