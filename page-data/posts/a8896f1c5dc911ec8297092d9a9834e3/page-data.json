This is the most uplifting post-apocalyptic show you’re likely to see.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-15T09:09:19.000Z","content":"[\"Things could always be worse, and in \\u201cStation Eleven,\\u201d they are. A powerful flu virus rips across the globe almost overnight, killing most of humanity. Twenty years later, the survivors are eking out a preindustrial life amid the ruins.\", \"But would you believe me if I told you that, somehow, things are also better? Or if not \\u201cbetter\\u201d exactly, then far more hopeful than TV\\u2019s other apocalypses, from \\u201cThe Walking Dead\\u201d to \\u201cY: The Last Man,\\u201d would have led you to expect.\", \"Based on the 2014 novel by Emily St. John Mandel, \\u201cStation Eleven,\\u201d whose first three episodes arrive Thursday on HBO Max, focuses less on survival (a preoccupation of even the sitcom \\u201cThe Last Man on Earth\\u201d and Netflix\\u2019s fanciful \\u201cSweet Tooth\\u201d) than on how the human spirit, as expressed through art, insists on thriving. At times dark and heartbreaking, it\\u2019s also luminous, wondrous, even funny \\u2014 the most uplifting show about life after the end of the world that you are likely to see.\", \"It begins with a play: On a wintry night in Chicago, the movie star Arthur Leander (Gael Garc\\u00eda Bernal) collapses and dies onstage while playing King Lear. The ensuing chaos brings together Jeevan Chaudhary (Himesh Patel), an underemployed writer in the audience, with Kirsten Raymonde (Matilda Lawler), an 8-year-old actress playing one of Lear\\u2019s daughters as a child.\", \"Kirsten\\u2019s parents are unreachable, the reasons for which dawn chillingly that night as patients begin to crowd the hospitals. After a detour to buy about $10,000 in groceries, the pair seal themselves up in a high-rise apartment with Jeevan\\u2019s brother, Frank (Nabhaan Rizwan), where they watch an errant airliner crash into the Chicago skyline.\", \"The 10-episode limited series jumps between the early days of the plague and two decades later, when Kirsten (Mackenzie Davis, \\u201cHalt and Catch Fire\\u201d) has somehow managed to continue her acting career after the apocalypse. She\\u2019s playing Hamlet with the Traveling Symphony, a ragtag theater and music troupe in the Great Lakes. Their life seems almost idyllic, if not for the reminders of the danger that could result if they stray from \\u201cThe Wheel,\\u201d their rigid tour loop.\", \"Governments have collapsed, but civilization has, in small pockets, regrouped. There\\u2019s a generation gap between \\u201cprepans,\\u201d who survived the plague, and \\u201cpostpans,\\u201d born after, who lack the same attachment to the past. (iPhones, to them, are like magical totems from mythology.)\", \"In a way, \\u201cStation Eleven\\u201d shares as much with frontier stories as with apocalypse stories, in that it is partly about how you start a community from scratch.\", \"The Traveling Symphony, led by the cantankerous Conductor (Lori Petty), is one such group. Another has settled in a regional airport, where its members try to preserve the memories and creature comforts of the past. In one episode, the Symphony members share a dinner of vacuum-sealed M.R.E.s with an old colleague (David Cross), who\\u2019s living on a landmine-strewn golf course and writing a giant history he calls \\u201cThe Book of Joy and Despair.\\u201d\", \"The theme, as it emerges, is memory as balm vs. prison. What\\u2019s the line between keeping a link to the past and being chained to it?\", \"Patrick Somerville, who adapted Mandel\\u2019s novel for television, previously worked on HBO\\u2019s \\u201cThe Leftovers,\\u201d which took place after the unexplained disappearance of 2 percent of the world\\u2019s population. \\u201cStation Eleven\\u201d involves a bigger loss but it has a similar sensibility: wistful, sardonic and focused on life after catastrophe rather than the catastrophe itself.\", \"So the series conveys the anguish of the pandemic with a few well-chosen scenes, rather than letting them accumulate to the point of numbness. \\u201cStation Eleven\\u201d wants to you feel everything \\u2014 joy and despair, tragedy and comedy. As the elder Kirsten, Davis bursts with expression; as the precocious but vulnerable young Kirsten, Lawler gives one of the best child performances I\\u2019ve seen on TV since Kiernan Shipka in \\u201cMad Men.\\u201d\", \"The imagery is equally fulsome. The first episode, directed by Hiro Murai (\\u201cAtlanta\\u201d), renders the apocalypse as both epic and intimate. Its most striking device cuts between scenes from before the plague and the same settings decades later, overgrown with cruelly beautiful vegetation, as if to hold up the skull of civilization and say alas, we knew it well.\", \"There is something graphic-novel-like in how \\u201cStation Eleven\\u201d juxtaposes images and events across time: Kirsten and Jeevan\\u2019s buddy-comedy journey; the Traveling Symphony\\u2019s circuit; the prepandemic life of Miranda Carroll (Danielle Deadwyler), a budding cartoonist. The series in fact takes its name from Miranda\\u2019s passion-project comic book, about an astronaut trapped on a broken space station. (The metaphor for the state of humanity can be seen from orbit.)\", \"One of the few surviving copies finds its way to Kirsten, who later recalls, \\u201cWhen I read it, I didn\\u2019t care that the world was ending, because it was the world.\\u201d Another reader, who terms himself The Prophet (Daniel Zovatto), is moved to found a cult, whose mysterious aims drive the shaggy plot.\", \"I can imagine a viewer for whom the pandemic premise hits too close to home. An early image of masked, parentless children in a hospital waiting area socked me straight in the gut. I can also imagine a viewer who sees the quirky, thespian\\u2019s-eye treatment of the subject as twee and art for art\\u2019s sake. (Some reviews of Mandel\\u2019s novel criticized it for not being sufficiently dire.)\", \"But that\\u2019s just it: This is art for art\\u2019s sake. That is, it\\u2019s a work that celebrates humanity by celebrating humanity\\u2019s drive to create. Art, in \\u201cStation Eleven,\\u201d is the human soul conserved in M.R.E. form for future consumption. It\\u2019s the way we speak to one another across generations and beyond death. \\u201cStation Eleven\\u201d finds this power not just in Shakespeare but in comics, in a hip-hop anthem, in a long-ago child\\u2019s voice recorded on an electronic keyboard \\u2014 even in an episode of \\u201cStar Trek: Voyager,\\u201d which gives the series a repeating mantra, \\u201cSurvival is insufficient.\\u201d\", \"Not everyone agrees on what art is for, of course, and if you want it to help you forget your troubles, \\u201cStation Eleven\\u201d is not for you. I don\\u2019t blame you; it\\u2019s been a rough couple of years.\", \"But if you want catharsis and a surprising laugh, I\\u2019m not sure I know a better show to go into the next year with. At a time of both sudden and slow-motion catastrophes, \\u201cStation Eleven\\u201d is a reminder that we never know what life will bring. But the show must go on.\"]","href_hash":"a8896f1c5dc911ec8297092d9a9834e3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a8896f1c5dc911ec8297092d9a9834e3"}},
