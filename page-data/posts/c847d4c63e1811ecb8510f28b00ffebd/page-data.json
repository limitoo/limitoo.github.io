He laughed, delighted by her \\u201ccutting\\u201d sense of humor.\", \"\\u201cI thought it was hilarious,\\u201d he said, adding that he was also enthralled by her background as a nightclub impresario. \\u201cWe had a very interesting conversation. I clearly wanted to see her again.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Rosenblum, 55, is an interior designer. But in the \\u201980s and \\u201990s, she was a fixture in the world of hip-hop who worked as an event producer, party promoter and D.J. manager. Before dropping out to pursue a career in \\u201cthe scene,\\u201d she spent a couple of years at Barnard College.\", \"Mr. Young, 62, had a somewhat more conventional trajectory. From Cincinnati, he graduated and received a master\\u2019s degree in international relations from the University of Miami in Ohio, and studied law at George Washington University. He is now the global head of litigation for EY, the accounting firm.\", \"On a second date, which both described as unspectacular, she made it clear that she was more interested in fixing up his West Village loft than she was in starting something up with its owner. But Mr. Young wasn\\u2019t put off.\", \"\\u201cI really liked spending time with her, so I\\u2019m like, OK fine, maybe I\\u2019ll get lucky and my decorator will turn into my girlfriend,\\u201d he said.\", \"Then, just a few weeks after they met, the pandemic changed everything.\", \"He had left for a weekend in Los Angeles in March, and was stuck there for six weeks. Just as he departed, Ms. Rosenblum fell ill with what she was pretty sure was the coronavirus. Both were isolated and alone, and their telephone conversations, initially about Mr. Young\\u2019s loft, became increasingly personal.\", \"\\u201cWe just ended up on the phone every day for an hour or two,\\u201d Ms. Rosenblum said.\", \"[Click here to binge read this week\\u2019s featured couples.]\", \"Eventually, they told each other their hopes and dreams, Mr. Young said.\", \"When he returned to a desolate New York in May, he asked if she\\u2019d find him a temporary spot in Woodstock, N.Y., which she had retreated to after recovering sufficiently from her illness.\", \"\\u201cIt didn\\u2019t really cross my mind that he was just really trying to be near me,\\u201d said Ms. Rosenblum, who grew up in Woodstock and ended up finding Mr. Young a place not far from where she was staying.\", \"The pair hiked the Catskills, took long drives, ate takeout food and drank wine. When his rental there ended, he moved into another, and in August 2020, the two rented a house in Montauk.\", \"\\u201cWe just were inseparable, but it still wasn\\u2019t romantic,\\u201d Ms. Rosenblum said, \\u201calthough he made it clear that he wanted it that way, and I made it clear that I didn\\u2019t.\\u201d\", \"When they finally returned to New York City, in September, Mr. Young told Ms. Rosenblum that it was time for him to recalibrate.\", \"\\u201cWe played house and it worked out wonderfully and we really enjoyed it,\\u201d Mr. Young said. \\u201cBut if you don\\u2019t want to take it to the next step, I basically said, I have to move on.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Rosenblum had a long conversation with herself and the next night, she said, \\u201cI think I\\u2019m the one who needs to recalibrate. And it was just \\u2018on\\u2019 from that minute.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe treat each other with a kindness that I\\u2019ve never really felt for someone before, and we bring that out in each other,\\u201d Ms. Rosenblum said. \\u201cThat is pretty special.\\u201d\", \"The couple married Oct. 17 at Cipriani Wall Street, with 30 guests vaccinated against the coronavirus attending.
