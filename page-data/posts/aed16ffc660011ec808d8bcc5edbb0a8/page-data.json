Jeff Murphy was searching in Yellowstone National Park. \", \"Sacha Dent: Very tragically, just misstepped and ended up falling off of a cliff and passing away.\", \"Around the same time, writer Dan Barbarisi went on his first search with his treasure hunting partner, Jay Raynor.\", \"Tony Dokoupil: What was it like going from four months of research on a computer to being out there in the wilderness?\", \"Jay Raynor: So, I think \\u2026 the first thing that stood out to me \\u2026 was how much bigger \\u2026 a point on a map is in real life. Like, you know, you look on a map, you look on Google Earth and you go, \\\"Oh this isn't that big \\u2026 I can cross this area with just my finger alone.\\\" \", \"Dan Barbarisi: Once you're actually out in the wild, you see how big those distances are and how much land there actually is out there pretty quickly. \\u2026 it really hits you in the face pretty fast.\", \"Reality wasn't the only thing hitting Dan and Jay in the face.\", \"Dan Barbarisi: We're out there thinking that we're, you know, adventurers and explorers \\u2026 And all of a sudden it starts hailing \\u2026 and we very quickly realize that we had absolutely no idea what we were doing.\", \"Days later, in that same exact area, a Colorado pastor named Paris Wallace set off to search the Rio Grande near the Taos Junction Bridge. \", \"PASTOR PARIS WALLACE'S FINAL SERMON: As you move through life, there are those points where you have to seek God to find out what he wants you to do. \", \"Katya Luce: And he crossed the river by himself. And it was high waters then. \", \"Paris' body was recovered four days later, a few miles downriver. His death spurred the New Mexico State Police chief to ask Forrest Fenn to call off the hunt. Fenn refused.\", \"Dan Barbarisi: There was a huge amount of anger at Fenn over this. \\u2026 And you can understand why. I mean, this is a treasure hunt. It doesn't need to exist, and yet he wouldn't stop it even after multiple people had died. That's a pretty hard stance to take.\", \"Fenn justified continuing the hunt by pointing out that any outdoor activity came with risks. \", \"Forrest Fenn [2016]: In the summertime, we jump in a swimming pool. But if someone drowns in a swimming pool, should we drain the pool, or should we teach people to swim? That's the way I feel about it.\", \"And the treasure community rallied around Fenn in support of the hunt. \", \"Sacha Dent: 99.9% of people who go out looking for his treasure make it home safely with tons of memories and new experiences to treasure.\", \"And Fenn did keep warning searchers to be safe.\\u00a0 \", \"Katya Luce: Be more careful. Be more mindful.\", \"Sacha Dent: He constantly reminded everyone to not go anywhere a 79- or 80-year-old man couldn't go.\", \"Many searchers, Dan says, set off on the treasure trail with great excitement but sometimes were unprepared for how wild the wilderness can be. \", \"Dan Barbarisi: \\u2026 it can get you in multiple ways. It can get you emotionally. It can get you physically and, you know, mortally \\u2026 I think that is actually part of what drew so many people in is the reality that this thing was real. \\u2026 this treasure chest was real. The fortune was real that was there to be had. But the danger was real, too \\u2026 this was a true adventure.\", \"Searchers, like Eric Ashby, understood the risks, and were willing to take them. \", \"Paul Ashby: Fear was not part of his game. He didn't know how to be afraid. \", \"Paul Ashby raised his son Eric as a single father in the mountains of Tennessee. Eric grew up playing sports, riding motorcycles and was taken by the quest at the center of \\\"The Lord of the Rings\\\" trilogy.\", \"Paul Ashby: Eric was a great kid. Everybody who knew him loved him.\", \"In 2016, Eric moved to Colorado. He told his Dad he was headed west to take part in his own quest \\u2014 Fenn's \\\"Thrill of the Chase.\\\"\", \"Paul Ashby: He became obsessed. \\\"Dad, I can do this.\\\"\", \"Tony Dokoupil: Was he motivated by the money the treasure represented or by the recognition of solving it when no one else could \\u2013\", \"Paul Ashby: Oh, sincerely the recognition. The money, to him, was totally irrelevant. \", \"Eric told his father he was going out to search the Arkansas River outside Ca\\u00f1on City, Colorado. More than a week later, Paul got a phone call from a woman who said her name was Becca. \", \"Paul Ashby: she told me on the phone, \\\"Mr. Ashby, your son has drowned\\\" \\u2026 She says, \\\"I'm sorry, Mr. Ashby, your son is dead,\\\" and she hung up.Becca turned out to be Rebecca Nies, who had worked with Eric. She and three men were with Eric at the river. They had drawn up a contract outlining exactly how they'd split the treasure. She later told police what happened that day: \", \"BECCA NIES [police interview]: He said he'd swam the river 10 times before \\u2026 We figured he'd be fine. \", \"Becca said they'd bought a two-person raft, but Eric got in alone and had no life preserver.\", \"BECCA NIES [police interview]: He just jumped out \\u2026\\u00a0 It looked like he made it to the rock, but then we didn't see him anymore and that was right where the rapids would have taken him. \", \"Becca told police two of the men went downriver to look for Eric, where they saw a photographer who told them he'd called 911. The photographer also captured this photo of Eric's empty raft. \", \"Hearing someone had called police, Becca and the others went back to their car and went home \\u2013 a decision Becca tried to explain:\", \"OFFICER: I want to know why no one stayed there to tell us this information. \", \"BECCA NIES: We were scared. \\u2026 It's easy in hindsight to see what we should have done but in the moment. We'd never been involved with anything like that. \", \"Paul Ashby: Eric stepped in a situation that was impossible. Nobody coulda done it. The thing that makes it worse is that nobody stopped him. \\u2026 it was just a case of, \\\"Oh well.\\\" Eric was worth so much more to me than, \\\"Oh well.\\\" [crying]\", \"After Eric's body was recovered, Paul traveled to the river to see where his son had died.\", \"Paul Ashby: I took the excursion train that comes down the gorge \\u2026 And one of the company managers was on the train \\u2026 he went into \\u2026 the lounge car and come back with a beer. He says, \\\"This is for you and your son.\\\" And we shared our last beer right there.\", \"Paul says he never heard from Forrest Fenn. \", \"Tony Dokoupil: If you had been able to reach Forrest Fenn \\u2026 what would you say to him?\", \"Paul Ashby: I'd say, \\\"Mr. Fenn \\u2026 Is this something one day you're gonna have to go to whoever our maker is and say, 'Yes, these people were drowning or dying,' falling off cliffs, whatever, 'And I coulda stopped it, and I chose not to.'\\\"\", \"Dan Barbarisi: I was honestly surprised that it didn't end in that summer of 2017. \", \"But the hunt did not end.

It became dry.\", \"They left even more supplies on the snowmobiles and set off on foot with a sled to carry home the treasure, which Mike believed was close. \", \"Steven Inlow: We had some \\u2026 candy bars, a couple of energy bars and maybe a gallon-and-a-half of water between the two of us. \\u2026\\u00a0 It didn't look that far away \\u2026 but it proved to be ridge over ridge over ridge that took a lot longer than I thought it was going to take. \", \"Beth Van Oss: By 6:00 on Wednesday, I was kind of nervous I hadn't heard from him.\", \"When the men hadn't returned the snowmobiles Wednesday night, the rental company called the police, who called Beth and Steven's wife.\", \"Beth Van Oss: Not knowing was just the worst. Just the most awful thing.\", \"Mike tried to hike to higher ground to get a cell signal, but hours later he returned unsuccessful. At that point, both men were so exhausted.

We need help.\", \"Desperate for hydration, Steven began drinking his own urine and felt warmth spread throughout his body.\", \"Steven Inlow: And I could just feel that was a moment that I'm going to live.

I cannot believe this has actually happened.\\\"\", \"Katya Luce: Did somebody really find it? \\u2026 and if so, who?\", \"The news broke on June 6, 2020 when Forrest Fenn made the stunning announcement in a brief post he sent to a blog used by the searcher community:\", \"TONY DOKOUPIL [reading aloud:] \\\"The treasure has been found \\u2026 and had not moved from the spot where I hid it more than 10 years ago. I do not know the person who found it, but the poem in my book led him to the precise spot.\\\"\", \"Overnight the gold rush that had sustained the searchers was over, and many were left feeling a bit cheated. \", \"Toby Younis: We didn't have a name. We didn't have where it had been found. We didn't have \\u2026 any other information, other than it had been found where he had left it.\", \"Katya Luce: \\u2026 is it really, really, really true that they found it? I wanna see. You know, so the guy did send pictures. \", \"For the first time, searchers could see Fenn poring over the contents of his famous treasure chest. \\u00a0\", \"Katya Luce: \\u2026. it looked pretty authentic to me. You know, very authentic.\", \"But like everyone else, Katya yearned to know the finder's solve. How had he deciphered those clues in the poem? The finder would not say, but a month later, Fenn revealed the treasure had been found in Wyoming. \", \"Then, two months later, on September 7, 2020, Forrest Fenn died at his home. He had just turned 90 years old.\", \"Sacha Dent: I find myself thinking of Forrest often \\u2026 I miss our conversations very much.\", \"The finder may have remained anonymous forever except for a lawsuit that required the Fenn family to reveal his name. The finder knew it was only a matter of time, so he came out to Dan Barbarisi who wrote an article for Outside Magazine.\\u00a0\", \"Tony Dokoupil: Who did find the treasure?\", \"Dan Barbarisi: A man named Jack Stuef found the treasure. And he was \\u2026 a medical student who had gotten obsessed with this chase \\u2014 around 2018. \\u2026 He, you know, was very, very committed to his solve.\", \"\\u00a0In his online message to other searchers, Jack Stuef had shared his approach to cracking Fenn's poem.\\u00a0\", \"JACK STUEF [audio]: \\u2026 our challenge is to try not to make guesses\\u2026 It is simple and clear and straightforward \\u2026 You need simplicity in your solve.\", \"Dan says Jack had been searching for at least two years. Then, one day, in a Wyoming forest, Jack says he uncovered the chest. It had almost been covered by leaves and debris, but Jack said the lid was still visible. \\u00a0\", \"Dan Barbarisi: He became very paranoid that somebody was gonna stumble upon him in that moment.\", \"Jack says he hightailed it to Santa Fe where photos of Jack and Fenn with the treasure chest were taken. They seem to back up Jack's story, but Fenn watcher Toby Younis was skeptical. Toby Younis: Here is my theory \\u2026 The hunt was moving forward. Forrest was aging \\u2026 Forrest's family \\u2026 was frustrated with the state of the search \\u2026 Their houses had been broken into, their children had been threatened with kidnapping. They were never lovers of the Forrest Fenn treasure hunt.\", \"Toby has no evidence, but believes Fenn, knowing he had only months to live, looked around for someone who was close to finding the treasure. Toby believes Fenn reached out to Jack.\", \"Toby Younis: I imagine this is how it went \\u2026\\\"I want you to know that I'm dying. I want you to know that I don't wanna leave this treasure hunt to my family. And I'm going to ask you for a favor.\\\"\", \"Toby Younis: Forrest had a saying he used often.\", \"Forrest Fenn [2015]: There's an old saying. Two people can keep a secret if one of them is dead.\", \"Jack refused \\\"48 Hours\\\"' request for an interview, but denied he had any help from Fenn. As he wrote online:\", \"TONY DOKOUPLI [reading aloud]: \\\"I am not and was never employed by Forrest, nor did he 'pick' me in any way to 'retrieve' the treasure. I was a stranger to him and found the treasure as he designed it to be found.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Dan Barbarisi: I do not believe it is part of a conspiracy engineered by Fenn to give Jack the treasure or anything of that sort.\", \"Dan is in a unique position because he's the only journalist who has interviewed Jack.\\u00a0 Jack even allowed Dan to examine the treasure. The photos have rarely been seen. \", \"Tony Dokoupil: You were able to actually hold the treasure, to touch it, to see it in person.\", \"Dan Barbarisi: Yes \\u2026 I have seen and touched and felt and gone through the chest \\u2026 it was kind of an incredible moment, honestly \\u2026\\u00a0\", \"Jack told Dan he will not reveal the exact spot where he found the chest because he fears it would become a tourist attraction that would ruin the area's serenity and natural beauty.\", \"Sacha Dent: I think we will never find out truly where it was found.\", \"And there could be another reason: Fenn's original intent to lay down and die at the very spot where he hid his treasure.\", \"Forrest Fenn [2015]: I don't wanna be buried. If I had my way, I'd lay down under the tree \\u2026 just like a big, 'ole buffalo lays down and dies. Go back to nature \\u2026 become part of the Earth again.\", \"Jack says he's offered to put Fenn's ashes in that special spot but will not say if the family accepted his offer.\\u00a0 \", \"Dan says he doesn't know what Jack intends to do with the treasure \\u2014 whether he will sell it piecemeal or as one or perhaps lease it for display.\", \"Tony Dokoupil: What is, in the end, the legacy of Forrest Fenn?\", \"Dan Barbarisi: I think the legacy of Forrest Fenn is extremely complicated. \\u2026 I think there were a lot of good things that happened because of it, there were also some really bad things that happened because of it. \", \"But if you're Paul Ashby, who lost his only son Eric to the hunt\\u2014one of the five men to die chasing the thrill\\u2014Fenn's legacy is not complicated at all.\", \"Paul Ashby: He was reckless. He was willing to ignore the fact that people were dying because all these other people worshiped him.\", \"A lot of people still do look up to Forrest Fenn and maybe that's not so surprising.\\u00a0\", \"\\u00a0Katya Luce: \\u2026 when you feel a dream \\u2026 live your dream out \\u2026\\u00a0 Follow your heart. And, OK, so I didn't find the treasure. But I found many treasures.\", \"Katya Luce: So many magical, wonderful things I could never replace without that treasure hunt. \\u2026 I'm so grateful for Forrest \\u2026 thank you, thank you Forrest.\", \"To this day, searchers continue to look for the spot where Jack Stuef found the treasure \\u2014 still hoping to solve the clues in Fenn's poem.\", \"Produced by Paul La Rosa and Dena Goldstein.
