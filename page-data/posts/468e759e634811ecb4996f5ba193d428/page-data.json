The steps he presented \\u2014 such as beseeching the unvaccinated to become vaccinated and relying on our depleted postal system to distribute test kits \\u2014 are not enough. \", \"We must take these steps:\", \"1) We need to drop the term \\u201cbooster.\\u201d Full vaccination for Pfizer and Moderna is three doses.\", \"2) The federal government should institute vaccination mandates where it has jurisdiction.\", \"3) Proof of vaccination must be required on all public transportation and in all public gatherings and restaurants.\", \"4) Health care workers, teachers and students must be required to be vaccinated.\", \"5) Masks must be worn in all public spaces.\", \"6) Test kits must be readily available for all.\", \"Not taking all these actions will only lengthen our war with Covid.\", \"Sidney WeissmanChicagoThe writer is a clinical professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine\\u200b.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cMost Covid Infections May Soon Be Breakthroughs,\\u201d by Eleanor Cummins (Opinion guest essay, Dec. 20):\", \"The use of the term \\u201cbreakthrough infection\\u201d for Covid infections among the vaccinated is problematic. Rendering the vaccinated completely free from future infection was never the goal of the vaccine development effort, and would have been an unrealistic one. The goal was to prevent severe disease and death, and to that end the effort has been successful to an unpredictably great extent.\", \"Immunity is complex. With many viruses, it is the natural progression that after initial infection convalescents enjoy a period of relative protection from reinfection. A similar period of relative protection often follows vaccination. While such protection is not as persistent as we would like \\u2014 or, in the case of Covid vaccines, as initial data may have led us to expect it would be \\u2014 protection against severe disease and death remains robust.\", \"Covid infections among the vaccinated are not some unforeseen and unfortunate setback, as the term \\u201cbreakthrough\\u201d suggests. They are a natural and expected phenomenon, and, as your essay says, \\u201coutside of the Covid pandemic, no one really speaks of breakthrough infections, though the term may still apply.\\u201d Its use provokes uncertainty and stokes fear in the general public. We are all tired and anxious, and we do not need additional reasons to feel hopeless.\", \"Sam RobinsonQueensThe writer is chief resident in the department of internal medicine at Elmhurst Hospital Center.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cTo Measure Covid\\u2019s Impact, Focus on Hospitalizations,\\u201d by Monica Gandhi and Leslie Bienen (Opinion guest essay, Dec. 13):\", \"What seems to be missing from this analysis is the existence of long Covid. If we use hospitalizations as the key indicator of Covid\\u2019s impact we neglect those who have been ill and may not fully recover for some time, if ever.\", \"As we lack a full understanding of long Covid, it\\u2019s essential to prevent as many infections as possible, not just those resulting in hospitalizations. It\\u2019s easy to forget that those infected don\\u2019t just die or get better. For many of us living with the long effects of what seemed to be a mild case, it\\u2019s difficult to read these type of recommendations.\", \"Julie RienhardtMissoula, Mont.\", \" To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cThe Hardest School Year,\\u201d by Michelle Goldberg (column, Sunday Review, Dec. 19):\", \"Ms. Goldberg writes about a meeting of parents and Randi Weingarten, who hasn\\u2019t been a full-time teacher in over 20 years. As the leader of the American Federation of Teachers, Ms. Weingarten exemplifies the root failure in America\\u2019s public schools: Education leaders are far removed from the classroom.\", \"Public education privileges the most affluent. In March 2020, I began spending afternoons, evenings and weekends visiting students\\u2019 homes to make sure they were OK. It was devastating to see the correlation between the size and location of a student\\u2019s home and the student\\u2019s performance in school. Covid has only exacerbated these inequalities.\", \"We must find ways for teachers\\u2019 knowledge and experience to be heard and valued. We must rethink our schools so they do not replicate the inequities our students face. We must amplify the voices of students and families who need public education the most. We must install leaders at all levels who have the knowledge, experience and love for teaching to serve our students in the ways they deserve.\", \"Melissa McMullanPort Jefferson Station, N.Y.The writer is a sixth-grade teacher in a public school. \", \"To the Editor: \", \"Re \\u201cEverybody Wants to Be Your Email Buddy,\\u201d by Gail Collins (column, Dec. 9):\", \"Ms. Collins\\u2019s lament about too many emails asking for donations does not mention several possible avenues that could lessen such unwanted solicitations.\", \"For example, she could tie her donation to a guaranteed ambassadorship or judgeship if Donald Trump wins in 2024. And, if he doesn\\u2019t win, then a guaranteed automatic (not tossed into \\u201cforever litigation\\u201d) refund with interest of whatever amount she contributed.\", \"She could agree to a donation if the solicitors are willing to donate an equal amount to any cause or project she would name.\", \"Best, though, would be their support of a law requiring all candidates to compete for office based on their own intelligence, character, experience, education, morals, charms \\u2014 and understandable, lucid, solid, well-formulated ideas and plans for their constituents, without PAC, Citizens United-sanctioned donations or other outside-the-district sources.
