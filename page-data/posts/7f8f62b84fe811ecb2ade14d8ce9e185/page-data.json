It will take several weeks or over a month until results determine any necessary changes to vaccines.\", \"Fauci said it's also unclear whether the severity of the variant's symptoms in infected patients are any worse than the symptoms caused by previous variants.\", \"When the Delta variant first emerged, doctors said that people who caught it experienced more severe symptoms, required more mechanical ventilation, stayed in the ICU longer and died more frequently.\", \"The White House has restricted travel from South Africa and seven other countries where the variant has been most detected. Fauci said Friday that the travel restrictions were imposed to give researchers more time to understand the variant before it spreads domestically.\", \"The variant was first reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) on Wednesday. WHO designated it as a \\\"variant of concern\\\" on Friday.\", \"Researchers believe that new variant may have 32 mutations in its spike protein, more than double the number found in the Delta variant. The spike proteins determine the ability of a virus to attach onto and replicate within human cells.\", \"As a result, the Omicron variant may be 500 percent more infectious than the Delta variant, according to Dr. Eric Feigl-Ding, an epidemiologist and senior fellow at the Federation of American Scientists.\", \"Despite this, Fauci encouraged people not to panic. He suggested that people get fully vaccinated or a vaccination booster shot to \\\"dramatically increase\\\" the level of protection against new variants. He also urged people to continue wearing masks, especially in crowded areas.\", \"\\\"Our fate is in our own hands,\\\" he said.\"]","href_hash":"7f8f62b84fe811ecb2ade14d8ce9e185"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7f8f62b84fe811ecb2ade14d8ce9e185"}},
