Both schools have temporarily closed while close contacts are identified.\", \"Two new cases in Northland include one in Kaitaia and one in Kawakawa and both are close contacts of known cases.\", \"There was also an unexpected wastewater detection in a sample from Ahipara taken on 25 November. The ministry said while this may be connected to cases isolating in the area, people living in the area are urged to get tested if they have even mild symptoms.\", \"The 15 new cases in Waikato include six in Kawhia, three in Te K\\u016biti, two in Hamilton, two in Ng\\u0101ruaw\\u0101hia, one in Huntly, and one is under investigation.\", \"The one new case in the Western Bay of Plenty is a household contact of a previously reported case and was already self-isolating at home when they tested positive.\", \"There are no further cases to report today associated with Te Akau ki Papamoa School, but further cases associated with the school are \\\"likely\\\".\", \"The ministry said 117 of today's new cases are yet to be linked.\", \"There are 86 cases in hospital, including nine in intensive care.

More than 3 million people have downloaded the My Vaccine Pass.\", \"Earlier today, Northland District Health Board chair Harry Burkhardt said the region needed more time to boost low vaccination rates before unvaccinated travellers were allowed in, as the traffic light settings are set to kick in tomorrow.\", \"Meanwhile, a Nelson school, which closed after a staff member tested positive for Covid-19 yesterday, anticipates up to 40 students and staff may be close contacts.\", \"Some are urging officials to move faster on vaccinating children, but Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said there were no plans at this stage to bring the timeframe forward. Although it was still under advice, he said.\"]","href_hash":"fa52477b532311ec9737a5b4991d72f7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fa52477b532311ec9737a5b4991d72f7"}},
