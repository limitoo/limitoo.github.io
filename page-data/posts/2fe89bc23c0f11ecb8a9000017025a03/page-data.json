The notice comes a month after a pipeline leaked at least 25,000 gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean.\", \"The pipeline, owned by Houston-based company Amplify Energy, resulted in the Huntington Beach shoreline being closed for a week due to blobs of oil washing ashore, although damage has been minimal.\", \"\\\"It is not lawful for [the U.S. government] to just continue on with these really old development and production plans,\\\" Center for Biological Diversity Oceans Director Miyoko Sakashita said in a statement.\", \"She said the law that requires the government to review development and production water leases rarely occurs. As a result, she said that much of the infrastructure used in these leases is aging.\", \"\\\"It's particularly notable in this instance where we've now had this oil spill,\\\" she said. \\\"The infrastructure is aging and things need to be done differently.\\\"\", \"Spokespeople for the Interior Department's Bureau of Ocean Energy Management have not commented on Sakashita's claims or the lawsuit.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1924668/huntington-beach-work.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Workers in protective suits continue to clean the contaminated beach with an oil platform in the background in Huntington Beach, California, on October 11, 2021.
