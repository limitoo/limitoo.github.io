They have now set up tents on the footpath blocking access,\\\" the Mt Eden resident says.\", \"Photos and videos he sent to Newshub show Tamaki's supporters riding motorbikes up and down the street, chanting and shouting, performing a haka, and pitching tents on the footpath.\", \"The resident says people are shutting themselves in their apartments because they're so scared.\", \"\\\"So just for the record: It is deemed OK to create noise above 90 decibels in a residential area until the early hours of the morning and not be held accountable,\\\" he says.\", \"\\\"It is OK to piss and shit in the bushes around the protest area.\", \"\\\"It is OK to create a fire hazard by blocking access to our road frontage units by protesters pitching tents.\", \"\\\"It is OK for protesters to hamper access by parking their vehicles in an area of roadway normally blocked off to parking due to Rail Link already having blocked off the other side of the roadway.\\\"\", \"A police spokesperson told Newshub they've been monitoring behaviour at the gathering.\", \"\\\"We are aware of some concerns raised from local residents in relation to the level of noise by those present and we have been liaising with the Auckland Council and Corrections as well as the organisers,\\\" they said.\", \"\\\"Police are not aware of any concerns in relation to criminal behaviour or offences from individuals present at the gathering and we will continue to monitor the situation in case of any issues.\\\"\", \"Newshub has contacted Destiny Church for comment.\", \"Tamaki was arrested on Monday for allegedly breaching his bail conditions.\\u00a0\", \"Police launched an investigation earlier in the month after Tamaki visited Hagley Park in Christchurch to speak at a protest. But he claims it wasn't a protest but rather a \\\"family funday picnic\\\".\", \"He said he didn't organise the event but was asked to speak because he was in the city to preach at the Destiny Church service in Cranmer Square.\", \"His bail conditions mean he's banned from organising, attending, supporting, or speaking at any gathering that's in breach of COVID-19 rules. Under the orange traffic light setting, there are no capacity limits on gatherings should COVID-19 vaccine passes be used. If passes are not used, gatherings are limited to 50 people \\\"based on 1m physical distancing in a single defined space at the venue at any time\\\".\", \"In a statement released via his lawyer Ron Mansfield on Monday afternoon following his hearing, Tamaki says he \\\"denies the breach and will defend what is alleged when permitted\\\" next Thursday in court.\", \"\\\"It is not accepted that he should have been remanded in custody and any longer period on remand will be challenged vigorously. He believes in the value of the rule of law and is disappointed the contrary has been suggested by those who seek to silence him and any opposition to their power or policy,\\\" he says.\", \"\\\"It is a sad day for the freedom of all New Zealanders when people cannot gather and be heard in opposition to government policy when they believe it to be wrong and contrary to the good of the people.\", \"\\\"The New Zealand Bill of Rights Act has lost any impact that those who drafted it dreamt it might have. Democracy has taken another hit today and we are all worse off for that.\\\"\", \"Tamaki appeared before a court three times last year. In November, he spoke at an anti-vaccine mandate protest in Auckland attended by more than 1000 people - despite the city being in alert level 3 and mass gatherings banned.\", \"In October, he was charged with attending and organising a protest in breach of alert level 3 restrictions. He pleaded not guilty and was granted bail on the condition he didn't attend or organise any gathering in breach of the COVID-19 requirements.\\u00a0\", \"Days later, Tamaki attended another event at Auckland Domain and was charged with breaching his bail conditions.
