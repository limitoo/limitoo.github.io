They share two hind legs and parts of their shells.\", \"They also have a single digestive system, according to Eyup Ba\\u015fkale from Pamukkale University's department of biology.\", \"The conjoined turtles came into the biology department's care earlier this month. They were initially handed in to the General Directorate of Nature Conservation and National Parks, according to the Daily Sabah newspaper and the Anadolu news agency.\", \"Ba\\u015fkale and colleagues are aiming to keep the animals alive because he does not believe they would survive in the wild.\", \"\\\"They can feed on their own and move actively. Progress of measurement and weighing are being evaluated by researchers.\\\"\", \"Ba\\u015fkale added that the turtles, of the Testudo graeca species, have put on weight.\", \"According to the Encyclopedia of Life, the species is classed as vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\", \"This is not the first time that a pair of conjoined turtles has been found.\", \"In October this year, conjoined turtles with two heads and one body were reported by the Birdsey Cape Wildlife Center, in Barnstable, Massachusetts. X-rays revealed that the turtles had two separate spines that fused together further down the body.\", \"The center wrote in a Facebook post: \\\"Animals with this rare condition don't always survive very long or live a good quality of life, but these two have given us reason to be optimistic!\", \"\\\"It is impossible to get inside the heads of these two, but it appears that they work together to navigate their environment.\\\"\", \"The center added that the turtles seemed to be bright and active and were eating, swimming and gaining weight.\", \"In 2016, marine biologists in Italy were able to separate two conjoined twin loggerhead turtles.
