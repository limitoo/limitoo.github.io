The new chancellor, who will be sworn in next month, succeeded in his campaign by convincing voters that he would be very much like Merkel, but rarely has a German leader come into office amid so many crises.\", \"His to-do list: Scholz\\u2019s government faces a pandemic that is spiraling quickly upward and border conflicts in Belarus and Ukraine. His two more hawkish coalition partners might force the new chancellor to rethink some past policies.\", \"Changes ahead: Germany\\u2019s new government wants to legalize marijuana, a measure that Merkel\\u2019s party blocked for years.\", \"The case ignited an uproar over racism in the U.S., after the killing of George Floyd. A jury on Wednesday found three white men guilty of murder for pursuing and fatally shooting Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, last year. Here\\u2019s our live blog.\", \"The three defendants \\u2014 Travis McMichael, 35; his father, Gregory McMichael, 65; and their neighbor William Bryan, 52 \\u2014 face sentences of up to life in prison. \", \"What happened: Arbery was chased through a Georgia neighborhood by three white men in February 2020 and shot at close range. The defense lawyers argued that the men were trying to make a citizen\\u2019s arrest. The neighbor who filmed the attack was also charged. Here\\u2019s the full timeline.\", \"The trial: Over the 10 days of testimony, prosecutors challenged the defense\\u2019s claim that Arbery, who was unarmed and never spoke to his pursuers, could be considered a threat to armed men. The case touched on some of the most combustible themes in American criminal justice, including vigilantism, self-defense laws, the effects of widespread gun ownership and the role of race in jury selection.\", \"As Britain records more than 40,000 new coronavirus cases a day, a top scientific adviser has revived the debate over herd immunity, claiming that the country has reached the elusive threshold at which most of the population is protected against Covid-19. It comes as Europe is reimposing restrictions and facing a winter surge.\", \"The comments by Neil Ferguson, an epidemiologist at Imperial College in London, are likely to raise new questions about Britain\\u2019s status as a Covid outlier: a country willing to tolerate a widely circulating virus and a steady death toll as the price of a return to economic normalcy.\", \"Ferguson said he expected Britain to mostly avoid the sharp increase in cases seen on the continent in recent weeks, and suggested further restrictions like lockdowns were unnecessary. This is in part, he said, because so many Britons have already been infected.\", \"But critics say there are too many wild cards, like virus variants and waning vaccine immunity. The risks are increasing as masks are rare in public in England.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"At 80, Hayao Miyazaki is coming out of retirement with a new movie. Miyazaki has long preferred not to speak to the press, but T Magazine sat down with him for an hour. \\u201cI am making this movie because I do not have the answer,\\u201d he said of his next film.\", \"Teams, leagues and athletes have jumped at the chance to reach Chinese consumers in recent years. But now some wonder if the risks are too high.\", \"The sports world last week received a hint of a changing dynamic when the Women\\u2019s Tennis Association threatened to stop doing business in China if the government failed to confirm the safety of Peng Shuai, who disappeared from public view recently after accusing a powerful former vice premier of sexual assault.\", \"For most organizations, the W.T.A.\\u2019s position remains an outlier. Sports organizations with multimillion-dollar partnerships in China \\u2014 whether the N.B.A., the Premier League in England, Formula One auto racing or the International Olympic Committee \\u2014 have mostly brushed aside concerns. Some have even acquiesced at times to China\\u2019s various demands. A few have issued humbling apologies.\", \"But public opinion is changing. A Pew Research Center study this year found that 67 percent of Americans had negative feelings toward China, up from 46 percent in 2018. Similar shifts have occurred in other Western democracies.\", \"Mark Dreyer, a sports analyst for China Sports Insider, based in Beijing, said the W.T.A.\\u2019s standoff with China represented an escalation in the \\u201cthem or us\\u201d mentality that appeared to be forming between China and its Western rivals.\", \"The threat from the W.T.A., then, could serve as a sign of showdowns to come, in which case, Dreyer said, China could be the one losing out.\", \"This instant pot khichdi is a version of the comforting South Asian stew typically made with lentils and rice.\", \"Exercise affects your appetite in unexpected ways.\", \"Here are eight new books to look for in December.\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: Rudely overlook (four letters).\", \"And here is today\\u2019s Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.
