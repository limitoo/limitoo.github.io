If you don\\u2019t already receive the daily newsletter, sign up here.\", \"At the start of 2020, a Bitcoin was worth just over $7,000. Today, it\\u2019s trading at about $50,000, and the value of all cryptocurrencies, of which Bitcoin is one among many, is some $2.3 trillion. This rise has led many to envision a radically different future for finance and to question long-held beliefs about value.\", \"Bitcoin, the original established cryptocurrency, was devised as electronic money for direct exchange between people who need not trust each other, or anyone else, and instead put their faith in the blockchain \\u2014 a public ledger maintained by decentralized, open-source networks of computers. There are now thousands of different blockchain-based tokens, circulating continuously on venues with varying degrees of regulation and oversight. This is what is known as \\u201cweb3,\\u201d the name adopted for a decentralized internet run on crypto tokens. Supporters say it will democratize everything, reshaping art, commerce and technology; displacing intermediaries; and putting people more directly in control of their destinies.\", \"If that sounds far-fetched, consider that venture capitalists have invested more than $27 billion in crypto and related projects this year, more than the previous 10 years combined, according to PitchBook. The biggest investors and industry players are also lobbying in Washington to influence rules that would favor their futuristic view of tokenomics, which can already be seen in some burgeoning communities where web3 is not some abstract concept but a feature of daily life.\", \"Take nonfungible tokens, or NFTs, which are unique bits of code on a blockchain associated with an image, a video, audio or some other thing. In October, Cam Rackam, an artist, sold 10,000 NFTs linked to images based on memes from Reddit\\u2019s Wall Street Bets message board, making $2.5 million.\", \"As a \\u201crelatively successful\\u201d painter over an 18-year career, Mr. Rackam was \\u201cnever welcomed\\u201d at the Art Basel fair in Miami Beach, he said. But this past week he was there, saying NFTs created a lot of buzz and traditional artists were \\u201cfeeling a little left out.\\u201d\", \"So far in 2021, about $27 billion worth of crypto has been spent on major NFT platforms, according to Chainalysis. That\\u2019s up from $114 million in all of last year.\", \"What are people getting? The NFT confers public proof of ownership and authenticity of an item, which may or may not include copyright \\u2014 just as in the physical world an artist may sell a work but retain the intellectual property, said Frank Gerratana of Mintz, a law firm.\", \"Last month, Miramax sued the director Quentin Tarantino over his proposed auction of \\u201cPulp Fiction\\u201d NFTs, which were linked to high-resolution scans from his original handwritten script. The company said using the film\\u2019s branding and imagery violated its rights.\", \"This is one of the first cases associated with NFTs, Mr. Gerratana said, and how it plays out may prove significant. He said his corporate clients were still trying to figure out what an NFT was and why people were buying them: \\u201cThey are wondering, \\u2018Is this the future? Are we going to have to do this?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"For Mr. Rackam, the revolution has already arrived. \\u201cThe joke is always on the boomers who don\\u2019t get it,\\u201d he said, referring not to the older generation but a dated mind-set that rejects new ideas about art and value. He noted that people had struggled with Andy Warhol\\u2019s prints of common commercial imagery like Campbell\\u2019s Soup cans, too.\", \"Another web3 concept that challenges conventions is decentralized social media, where users earn and trade crypto.\", \"On DeSo, a network for blockchain-based apps, users are paid for popularity, participation, posts and work. Its founder, Nader Al-Naji, a former Google engineer, believes that internet users will want to bypass the likes of Twitter and TikTok, which make money by serving them ads, and capture this worth directly for themselves instead.\", \"Mr. Al-Naji\\u2019s first crypto project was Basis, a \\u201cdecentralized Bitcoin\\u201d endeavor that he halted on regulatory concerns, returning funds it had raised from major venture capital firms like Andreessen Horowitz and Sequoia Capital.\", \"Mr. Al-Naji\\u2019s next project, BitClout, is an app where people trade personalized tokens linked to likenesses of one another and pop culture figures, whose values rise and fall based on use. It generated controversy when it was launched in March, with some calling it a \\u201cdystopian social network.\\u201d\", \"But the developer of the app, and the wider network it belongs to, said there was a \\u201crenaissance\\u201d in money afoot. Any users can be rewarded for their musings, music or mere presence via tokens or \\u201cfrictionless tipping,\\u201d with a diamond button that allows others to send a bit of crypto their way in appreciation of whatever they do or say.\", \"\\u201cThe vast majority of the benefits go to the smaller creators who people have always wanted to support,\\u201d Mr. Al-Naji said. \\u201cHere you just throw them some diamonds, you know, or buy their coin, which is an investment.\\u201d\", \"At the Securities and Exchange Commission, it\\u2019s Gary Gensler\\u2019s job is to ensure that crypto companies operate within a regulatory framework. To the chagrin of many web3 supporters, Mr. Gensler, who is the chair of the agency, believes that the old rules still apply to new tools. That implies that many, if not most, crypto assets are securities and must be registered with the S.E.C. to ensure adequate disclosures and investor protections, with all the costs and scrutiny this entails.\", \"And regardless of their legal status, the utility of some blockchain-based systems is up for debate. \\u201cUsually there\\u2019s a reason people want to have a central ledger,\\u201d Mr. Gensler told DealBook in an interview, noting that distributed ledgers maintained by thousands of computers have \\u201ccosts.\\u201d\", \"On currency, generally, \\u201cI associate myself more with Plato\\u2019s view of money than Aristotle\\u2019s,\\u201d he told DealBook. Aristotle, he said, believed money had four features \\u2014 portability, durability, divisibility and intrinsic value. Plato accepted the first three, Mr. Gensler said, but thought it had no inherent worth and was \\u201cjust a symbol.\\u201d\", \"When he taught courses on crypto finance at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology just before leading the S.E.C., Mr. Gensler told his students to ask, \\u201cWhere is the value proposition?\\u201d Are all of the crypto tokens that are competing with the dollar, or forming the basis of an app, valuable?\", \"\\u201cThe answer might be maybe,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut is there room for 6,000 of them? Highly unlikely.\\u201d\", \"What do you think? Let us know: dealbook@nytimes.com.\"]","href_hash":"3dacbc1455cf11ec89ae57f7668c2a75"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3dacbc1455cf11ec89ae57f7668c2a75"}},
