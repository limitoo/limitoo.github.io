And not just because of Covid-19.\", \"Today, there is just one woman for every 10 men in parliament, while fewer than 15% of senior private sector roles are held by women - half the original 2020 goal. \", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1673D/production/_120256919_gettyimages-1269272911.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe</div>\", \"Former prime minister Mr Abe still claims the policy was a success: there are now more women than ever working. But what kind of work are these highly-educated women doing?\", \"Critics believe his policy had little to do with creating social change - allowing women to flourish at work - and more to do with an acute need for workers. Japan's working-age population has been rapidly shrinking since the 1990s.\", \"For decades, about 60% of women quit paid work after their first child. A mother looking after her kids full time - because her husband's income could support the entire family - was traditionally seen as a privilege.   \", \"But as the Womenomics policy was brought in, mothers were already starting to return to work as their family incomes dwindled. \", \"Just 42.1% quit in 2019, pushing up labour market participation rates to 70.9% for women aged 15-64, rising to 77.7% in the 25-44 age category, government figures show. \", \"To support this shift the government launched campaigns to eliminate childcare waiting lists. It also pressured large companies to have at least one female executive.
