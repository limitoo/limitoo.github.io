I would expect in January, perhaps by the middle of January, we might be able to say with some confidence whether or not this variant is milder or more severe.\\\"\", \"In the UK hospitalisations are slowly going up, with most of the Omicron cases in London, he said. \\\"But we're not yet seeing that translate into any more severity of SARS-CoV-2 disease.\", \"\\\"You'd expect to see those people may be ending up in [the] hospital and I think the data is just too limited and they can't say much about the link with this variant and hospitalisation or severity of [the] disease.\\\"\", \"As the number of Omicron cases around the world rises, the New Zealand Government has agreed to a \\\"suite of precautionary measures\\\".\", \"McLean said New Zealand has a huge advantage, a strong border and can watch what is happening around the world.\", \"\\\"When it does get there it will spread because it spreads faster than Delta.\\\"\", \"There are currently no community cases of Omicron in New Zealand, with cases confined to managed isolation.\", \"\\\"Public health advice suggests that soon every case coming into our border, into our managed isolation facilities, will be the Omicron variant,\\\" COVID-19 Response Minister Hipkins said.\", \"We can say \\\"without a doubt\\\" people who have had two doses of a vaccine are still pretty likely to get Omicron, McLean said.\", \"\\\"Two doses of the existing vaccine is clearly not good enough, lab tests have shown that antibodies are significantly impaired even T cell immunity is reduced, although not as badly as the antibody response.\\\"\", \"The booster shot gives immunity a chance to combat the variant, he said.\", \"\\\"It's the booster programme that's going to be super important over the next little while.\\\"\", \"Cabinet has agreed to reduce the interval between the second Pfizer dose and booster shot from six to four months.\", \"Epidemiologist Rod Jackson said New Zealand is in a prime position against Omicron before winter settles - if we get our booster shots as soon as possible.\", \"\\\"Boosters are clearly going to be needed for all of those who are eligible and already vaccinated,\\\" Dr Jackson said.\", \"\\\"Kids is the other big issue because 5 - 11-year-olds, while they're at school that's a super spreader setting and we need to keep a lid on that as well.\\\"\", \"The good news is, New Zealand has things in its favour - it is one of the most recently vaccinated countries, meaning the level of immunity from two doses is still high, it's summer and school is out.\", \"\\\"We've got a whole lot of things in our favour, it just depends on whether Omicron gets loose and goes crazy,\\\" said Dr Jackson.\", \"\\\"The trouble with Omicron is there are so many unknowns, the only thing we know for sure is it's incredibly contagious. We don't know if it's any less severe or the same severity as Delta, we just don't know.\\\"\", \"We need to be cautious, he said.\", \"\\\"Every decision by Government is attempting to balance the risk to health and the risk to the economy.\\\"\", \"RNZ / Reuters\"]","href_hash":"4c0e48fe62e011ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4c0e48fe62e011ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
