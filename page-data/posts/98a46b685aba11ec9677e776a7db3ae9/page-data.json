Defence spending is increasing.\", \"Foreign affairs typically don't factor all that much into domestic politics, but not this time.\", \"There is already talk of a khaki campaign built around who can be tougher on China.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Our missed opportunity</div>\", \"In 1989, we thought we had entered a new epoch. The Berlin Wall came down. A\\u00a0couple of years later the Soviet Union collapsed.\", \"International politics professor Jonathan Holslag has revisited that time in a new book, World Politics Since 1989. Back then, he writes:\\u00a0\\\"The high tide of globalisation appeared to hold opportunities for all.\\\"\", \"Fast forward and it now appears a missed opportunity. Nationalism and authoritarianism, he says, \\\"are on the offence\\\". Resentment is rising and there are disputes everywhere over territory.\", \"And COVID-19\\u00a0has added fuel to the flames. Holslag points out: \\\"Coronavirus did not cause the decay of the political order. It rather took hold of a political body that was in bad shape.\\\"\", \"It has been a slow burn. Many did not notice as the temperature continued to rise.\", \"Holslag says that, in the past decade, \\\"economic globalisation stagnated and democratisation receded\\\".\", \"\\\"At the same time global military spending passed the Cold War record. The number of armed conflicts increased,\\\" he writes.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/03d6bb6c226f411d7e5300ddd30745a5\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Prime Minister Scott Morrison says it should come as \\\"no surprise\\\" Australia will not send officials to the Beijing Winter Olympics.</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Weakening of the West</div>\", \"What went wrong? Numerous things according to Holslag:\\u00a0Western hubris, growing inequality, shifts in global power and economics. Grievance piled on grievance: Outside the West, he says, countries began to push back, \\\"the West had bullied and belittled them long enough\\\".\", \"In the rich West, too, many people grew poor while the rich got richer.\", \"Set against this was the rise of China. But\\u00a0Holslag warns against the current tendency to see China as the sole great threat. We need to look inward.\", \"He says \\\"the focus on China's rise ignores the weakening of the West\\\".\", \"Two words stand out for Holslag: disregard and decadence. It is his most interesting chapter. As the West basked in post-Cold War triumphalism, it lost sight of its values and ethics. It wallowed in consumerism. As, he says, in countries such as\\u00a0the US and UK, \\\"the share of household consumption in the total economy surpassed 60 per cent\\\".\", \"While we thought we could buy our way to happiness, a gulf opened between morals and materialism. Inequality grew like a cancer. Between 2000 and 2009, he says, disposable income of the poorest dropped by 10 per cent. Unemployment grew.\", \"Holslag writes: \\\"By the end of the decade, one fifth of Americans lived in poverty.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ebe5f23ecb29e9d1ecce49fc355afe91\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> US announces it will stage a diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics.</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">New battle emerges</div>\", \"People felt disregarded and discarded. Holslag says a battle emerged \\\"between those who favoured openness and those who promised protection\\\".\", \"Openness became the preserve of the privileged: The progressive elite who benefited from globalisation, free movement and open borders.\", \"The \\\"pragmatic politician\\\" who talked-up openness, he says, often ignored those left behind while defending \\\"the moral high ground of democracy\\\".\\u00a0Holslag calls this politician \\\"the polite coward\\\".\", \"On the other hand, the \\\"patriotic politician\\\" \\u2014 promising protection \\\"against migration, against different cultures\\\" \\u2014 exploited fear and anxiety while \\\"failing to confront his followers with the inconvenient fact that identity and prosperity were undermined by their own behaviour\\\".\", \"Holslag says this politician \\\"vowed to defend Western civilisation against new barbarians, yet their rude style was sometimes no less barbaric\\\".\", \"This new political battleground has damaged democracy marked by a decline, Holslag says, \\\"of civic engagement and civic education\\\".\", \"\\\"By ignoring the importance of values such as virtue, civic participation and social justice, the foundation of democracy was becoming shaky,\\\" he writes.\", \"This malaise has infected both the US and the European Union, the two pillars of the West.\", \"\\\"Despite calls for civic renewal, civic engagement continued to recede, the turnout of youngsters in elections to drop, and time spent with families and friends to shrink,\\\" he writes.\", \"About a third of 14-year-old students in Europe, he says, \\\"were found to be unable to interpret a simple election leaflet\\\".\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Alienation and decadence</div>\", \"Disengagement from community, faith, family and an apathy towards to democracy has marked the Western decline. The politics of identity has turned fellow citizens into enemies. Alienation and decadence has set in.\", \"Between 2000 and 2009, Holslag points out, \\\"from crisis to crisis, the Western world lost more of its power\\\". That has gone, hand in hand, with a shrinking share of global economic production.\", \"The centre of political and economic gravity is shifting and we find ourselves back where we started: Talk of Cold War, troop build-ups and Olympic boycotts.\", \"This time, the\\u00a0difference is that the West is not just facing an enemy without, but also an enemy within.
