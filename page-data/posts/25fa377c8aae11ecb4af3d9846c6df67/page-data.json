On Thursday, the activist investment firm Macellum Advisors, which has been fighting for changes at the company for more than a year, sought to take over the retailer\\u2019s board as part of its push to persuade the company to sell itself.\", \"Kohl\\u2019s has recently received takeover approaches but rejected them as too low. Last week, it said that it has hired the investment bank PJT Partners and Goldman Sachs to field any further interest. It also put in a place a \\u201cpoison pill\\u201d provision that makes it harder for an acquirer to put a bid directly to Kohl\\u2019s shareholders. It made an exception for \\u201cqualified\\u201d offers, which requires the bids to be fully financed, among other conditions.\", \"In its push for a sale, Macellum said that it was convinced \\u201cmore than ever\\u201d that the retailer\\u2019s board needed to be refreshed \\u2014 it has proposed a slate of 10 candidates. Macellum, which owns about 5 percent of Kohl\\u2019s shares, struck a settlement with the retailer last April that included the addition of three new directors to its 14-seat board. All members of Kohl\\u2019s board, aside from its chief executive, Frank Sica, are independent. Mr. Sica is not standing for re-election to the board.\", \"Kohl\\u2019s called Macellum\\u2019s effort to take control of its board \\u201cunjustified and counterproductive.\\u201d\", \"Several potential suitors for Kohl\\u2019s have recently emerged:\", \"Like most department stores, Kohl\\u2019s has struggled to fend off competition from online retailers and brands themselves, which are increasingly sidestepping department stores all together. It has worked to carve out a place for itself by focusing in part on athleisure wear, which now makes up more than a quarter of its sales. Analysts have lauded Kohl\\u2019s for creative use of its real estate, like partnerships with Amazon and Sephora, to rethink profitability of its more than 1,000 stores. But they have also warned about the potential impact of supply chain challenges on sales.\", \"Kohl\\u2019s in November reported a 16 percent jump in quarterly revenue. Its shares are up more than 20 percent this year, fueled by the takeover interest.\"]","href_hash":"25fa377c8aae11ecb4af3d9846c6df67"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"25fa377c8aae11ecb4af3d9846c6df67"}},
