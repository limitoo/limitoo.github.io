Clubs have to make their own decisions about other people on club premises who aren't lifeguards, including non-patrolling members.\", \"Most clubs have made vaccines mandatory for everyone.\", \"\\\"For other people involved in Surf Life Saving that's largely on a club-by-club basis, managing who is entering the premises, who's engaging in various club activity, those sort of thing,\\\" Dalton said.\", \"\\\"Most clubs are going down the path of having all activities having to be undertaken by [only] vaccinated people.
