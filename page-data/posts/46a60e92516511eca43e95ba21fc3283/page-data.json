He\\u00a0beat Bayern Munich's Robert Lewandowski and Chelsea's Jorginho.\", \"Messi broke Pele's record of most goals for one club (672 at Barcelona), and went past Gerd Muller's record of scoring at least 30 goals in 12 consecutive seasons.\", \"The superstar striker also had a breakthrough title at international level, leading Argentina to beat Brazil in the Copa America final.\", \"That\\u00a0award \\u2014 which was announced at a ceremony in Paris \\u2014\\u00a0was not held last year due to COVID-19 restrictions.\", \"Lewandowski had the consolation of winning the new category of Striker of the Year, while Barcelona's Pedri\\u00a0took out the Kopa award for best young player.\", \"In the women's Ballon d'Or, Matildas striker Sam Kerr \\u2014\\u00a0who plays for Chelsea in the Women's Super League \\u2014\\u00a0came third in the voting, behind Barcelona's Jennifer Hermoso and her teammate and award winner Alexia Putellas.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/8d5c8dd8325a14f07c41db541120f62e\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Sam Kerr had an excellent year for the Matildas and Chelsea, coming third in the women's Ballon d'Or award.(AAP: Darren Pateman/File)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Australia's Ballon d'Or voting</div>\", \"By Daniel Garb\", \"For the third time since being first asked to do it in 2018, it was a huge privilege to again cast Australia's vote for the prestigious men's Ballon d'Or award in what was a welcome return for football's highest individual honour after it went unawarded last year for obvious reasons.\", \"Yet again, it was an incredibly hard decision to structure the 1-5 votes for the calendar year of 2021 \\u2014 up to October 24\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0based on the criteria set by France Football magazine, who established the award back in 1956.\", \"Those criteria are:\", \"1. Individual and team performance\", \"2. Talent and sportsmanship of the player\", \"3. The player's overall career.\", \"With the European Championships and Copa America both held during the transpiring 12 months, those international tournaments were always going to carry a large\\u00a0amount of weight, as they always do, along with the monitoring of performances in close detail over the year.\", \"It was a comforting feeling selecting four of the eventual top five, although I missed the eventual winner in what was a tough call.\", \"For Lionel Messi to win a seventh Ballon d'Or is quite possibly, a never to be repeated achievement.\", \"To give some insight into how Australia's vote was constructed, this is how I came to my decisions:\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">First choice \\u2013 6 points \\u2013 Robert Lewandowski (Bayern\\u00a0Munich /Poland)</div>\",

may not have won the Ballon d'Or, but he took home the trophy for striker of the year.(AP: Christophe Ena)</div>\", \"Like, I imagine, many judges did, I wrestled with the call of Lewandowski or Messi for first choice and changed my mind several times during the voting process.\", \"At the time that the nominations were sent out, the Polish goal machine had netted a remarkable 40 times in 50 games in 2021, which included the second half of the Bundesliga season, whereby he broke Gerd Muller's long-standing single-season goal record with 41 strikes and claimed his first-ever European Golden Boot gong.\", \"Yes, he is assisted by playing in the dominant Bayern Munich outfit but that should not dilute his status as, arguably, the finest pure striker and finisher the world has seen in the past decade, which was on show as much as ever in 2021.\", \"He still did his bit for his country at the Euros too, netting an impressive three goals in two games for a Poland side that was always going to battle to make it out of the group stage.\", \"Helping sway what was a close call and opt for \\\"Bobby\\\"\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0in addition to yet another remarkable domestic campaign where he won a seventh straight league title with Bayern Munich \\u2014\\u00a0was his 2020 season, where he was likely to claim the Ballon d'Or in a canter if not for the COVID-19 disruptions.\", \"Considering a player's career is part of the criteria \\u2014 despite Messi obviously having a far better one all up \\u2014\\u00a0I felt this was a fair call, along with the other factors outlined for both players, to edge the vote his way, along with another extraordinary year.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Second choice \\u2013 4 points \\u2013 Lionel Messi (Barcelona/PSG/Argentina)</div>\", \"In the quest for a seventh Ballon d'Or all up, the immortal Argentine was irrepressible yet again in a year highlighted by his first major tournament win with Argentina,\\u00a0the Copa America, where he claimed joint golden boot: four goals\\u00a0and player of the tournament honours.\", \"There was the La Liga Golden Boot as well for Messi, who still mesmerises like no other in the footballing world at his best, but that's where the major honours ended, without a league title and a Champions League campaign that ended in the round of 16 as things started to unravel at Barcelona.\", \"He would still finish fourth in the Champions League forward of the season award, one spot behind Lewandowski.\", \"All that considered, it was a marginal call for top honours between the two but a slow start to life at PSG for the 34-year-old, after 17 first team seasons at Barca, also had an impact in swaying the six votes to Lewandowski and placing Leo in second.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Third choice \\u2013 3 points \\u2014 Jorginho (Chelsea/Italy)</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b9e71f8b456246999751a3d54a01ec00\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

Jorginho played a critical role for both Italy and Chelsea in winning the two biggest trophies a player could collect in 2021 \\u2013 the European Championships and the Champions League.\", \"Of course, simply claiming them is not enough to figure prominently in Ballon d'Or voting, the individual performances must be of an exceedingly high standard as well.\", \"That was certainly the case for the remarkably talented midfielder who demonstrated his all-encompassing engine room game as a tempo-setter, playmaker, defensive shield and elite penalty converter, en route to the two major achievements for club and country.\", \"This\\u00a0was highlighted by being named UEFA men's player of the year, in the Euros team of the tournament and the Champions League squad of the season.\",

feature more prominently in the votes.\", \"However, as France faltered and Kante's start to the 2021\\u201322 season was a tad off\\u00a0his mind-blowing standards, he slid down the polling sheet a touch.\", \"Still, to be fourth on anyone's list \\u2014\\u00a0and, quite possibly, higher in some \\u2014\\u00a0as an out-and-out defensive midfielder, albeit one who\\u00a0possesses a creative passing game, is a sensational mark to reach and just reward for an incredible career to date that deserved a high-placed finish after another stunning year.\", \"Few defensive midfielders can take your breath away.
