Riders who use OMNY now pay the regular $2.75 fare for every trip, but under the proposed change, users would get unlimited rides once they hit a $33 threshold during a seven-day period \\u2014 equivalent to the cost of a weekly unlimited MetroCard. \", \"The plan would start as a four-month pilot and discounts would end on June 30, though Janno Lieber, the acting chairman and chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which runs the subway, said he hoped it would become permanent based, in part, on how popular it proves and how it affects the M.T.A.\\u2019s budget. \", \"The proposal is being announced Monday and will be voted on by the M.T.A.\\u2019s board at its meeting on Wednesday. Mr. Lieber said he expected the board to approve the fare plan.\", \"\\u201cWe want to make sure that somebody who is standing in front of the turnstile for their first commute on Monday morning who might not have the 33 bucks to outlay for a weekly ticket doesn\\u2019t have to worry about that,\\u201d Mr. Lieber said. \\u201cA lot of people don\\u2019t know when they get on their first ride of the week whether they\\u2019re going to be using it 10 times or 11 times or 20 times.\\u201d\", \"The seven-day period would begin at 12 a.m. on Monday and end at 11:59 p.m. on Sunday, M.T.A. officials said.\", \"Ridership trends, Mr. Lieber added, have been upended by the pandemic, which has made what were once everyday habits unpredictable.\", \"Transit advocates said the change would save many New Yorkers money at a time when the subway is trying to lure back riders who abandoned the system at the start of the pandemic early last year. Public transit agencies across the country and in other parts of the world are still struggling to find ways to bring riders back.\", \"Although the numbers in New York are climbing, subway ridership in recent weeks has only been hovering at about 58 percent of prepandemic levels, when over five million people packed the trains every weekday. \", \"The M.T.A. has been stabilized by billions of dollars in federal pandemic assistance, but its long-term financial outlook depends heavily on the return of riders and their fares, which make up the agency\\u2019s largest funding source. Nearly 40 percent of the agency\\u2019s operating revenue comes from fares, a higher percentage than most other major public transit systems in the country.\", \"\\u201cFare capping is absolutely a program whose time has come, and it\\u2019s going to benefit so many riders,\\u201d said Lisa Daglian, the executive director of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the M.T.A., a watchdog group. \\u201cIt levels the playing field.\\u201d\", \"With OMNY \\u2014 short for One Metro New York \\u2014 riders can tap a credit card, smartphone or OMNY card on an electronic reader to access the subway, a more modern fare system that many other public transit systems around the world have already adopted. OMNY readers are available at all 472 subway stations and on all 5,800 buses, and fare capping would apply to both modes of transportation.\", \"\\u201cIf I do happen to ride enough in a week tapping my card and I get a free ride out of it, I wouldn\\u2019t turn that down,\\u201d said Amy Kowell, 32, who lives in Brooklyn and works in the financial district in Lower Manhattan. \\u201cIt\\u2019s definitely appealing.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Kowell, who was entering the Parkside Avenue station in Brooklyn on her way to go shopping on Saturday, said the subway is the main way she gets around the city and that she likes OMNY because it spares her the trouble of making sure she has a MetroCard with enough of a balance. Depending on her schedule, she said, she typically takes about 10 to 15 trips per week.\", \"The M.T.A. introduced the system in May 2019 on a handful of subway and bus routes. Today, Mr. Lieber said, more than 25 percent of all fare payments are made using the OMNY system.\", \"By 2023, it will fully replace the transit system\\u2019s floppy yellow-and-blue MetroCards.\", \"While capping the fare would add convenience and could save money for commuters who rely on single-fare rides, advocates caution that there are still drawbacks, pointing out that many low-income people do not have bank accounts or smartphones. \", \"An OMNY card is also more expensive than a MetroCard \\u2014 $5 compared with $1. It was unclear how fare capping would work with the city\\u2019s Fair Fares program, which provides certain low-income New Yorkers a 50 percent discount on public transit rides.\", \"\\u201cSome of the broader issues around OMNY haven\\u2019t been discussed enough with regard to low-income New Yorkers,\\u201d said Emerita Torres, the vice president of policy, research and advocacy at the Community Service Society of New York, an antipoverty group. \\u201cThat\\u2019s something that we have to study and really look at.\\u201d\", \"Rosalino Tlatelpa said even if the fares were capped he would not use OMNY because he finds it too confusing. Mr. Tlatelpa, 76, and his wife, Rosa, are retired and receive about $1,100 per month in government aid.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t like it,\\u201d Mr. Tlatelpa said in Spanish as he and his wife entered the Parkside Avenue station to travel to a Covid-19 vaccine appointment.\", \"Implementing the fare capping plan on a trial basis might result in a loss of fare revenue of $3 million to $5 million per month, Mr. Lieber said, but that could be offset with higher subway ridership. \", \"People might be less hesitant about using the subway if they don\\u2019t have to do any math to figure out how much they are spending, Mr. Lieber said. \", \"\\u201cIt becomes more routine,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAs you make the fare payment system easier and more rational and fairer, people tend to use it a little bit more rather than looking at every nickel and dime.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a15420df5bfd11ecb2a93fe36035ae40"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a15420df5bfd11ecb2a93fe36035ae40"}},
