Election experts said the changes would confuse voters and create more potential for fraud.\", \"Under Texas law, county parties are allowed to run their own primary elections, but the vast majority have contracted with local boards of election for decades. The decision, which was reported by Votebeat, an election news website, comes as Republicans nationally have continued to push baseless claims of fraud in the 2020 election and sow doubts about the reliability of election machinery.\", \"Daniel L. Rogers, the chairman of the Potter County Republicans, said that he made the decision this week because \\u201ca lot of voters have concerns\\u201d with the electronic counters and \\u201cdon\\u2019t feel comfortable with them.\\u201d He did not cite evidence of any problems arising under the current system, and studies have shown that hand counting leads to more inaccuracies. He argued that paper ballots would be more secure.\", \"\\u201cThe parties have become lazy and complacent, but the primaries are actually the party\\u2019s responsibility,\\u201d said Mr. Rogers, a real estate broker whose office was decorated with red Make America Great Again hats when a New York Times reporter interviewed him last year. \\u201cThe counties are spending millions of dollars on electronic systems, but this way it\\u2019s a true secret ballot.\\u201d\", \"He said that \\u201cthe voters are smarter than our elected officials, than administrators \\u2014 they don\\u2019t trust the voters. I do.\\u201d\", \"Mark P. Jones, a professor of political science at Rice University in Houston, said the move \\u201cremoves the Republican Party one more step away from the standard electoral procedure.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cThe integrity of our electoral system depends on institutionalizing and professionalizing election boards. There will be more doubts about the overall outcome, or it will lead to more slip-ups and more potential flaws and problems than if the professionals ran it.\\u201d\", \"Potter County has about 57,000 registered voters, and they are overwhelmingly Republican: Roughly 70 percent cast their ballots for Donald J. Trump in 2020.\", \"Mr. Rogers, when asked if the election results nationally were valid, responded, \\u201cI don\\u2019t have any idea and that\\u2019s the problem \\u2014 I don\\u2019t know if it was accurate or not.\\u201d\", \"Under state law, the county elections board will still be responsible for absentee and early voting, which a majority of voters in Texas use to cast their ballots. But the two systems, experts said, could complicate the process and make it easier for voters to cast ballots twice.\", \"\\u201cIt opens the door wide to fraud,\\u201d Dr. Jones said. \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t close the door to fraud.\\u201d\", \"The legal office of the Texas secretary of state, who oversees elections in the state and who was appointed by Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, raised several concerns about the move.\", \"\\u201cAny time that a party conducts their own election rather than contracting with a county, it is more confusing to voters,\\u201d said Sam Taylor, the assistant secretary of state for communications. Still, he added that \\u201cultimately it\\u2019s their decision to go at it alone.\\u201d\", \"One risk, Mr. Taylor said, is that candidates in contested races could file election challenges to prompt a court to order a new primary election. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not unprecedented,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut county parties usually do not invite that opportunity upon themselves.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThey have every legal right to do so,\\u201d he added. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t really intervene.\\u201d\", \"Melynn Huntley, the Potter County elections administrator, said that she had been taken aback by Mr. Rogers\\u2019s decision and that she was most worried about the potential to make it easier to vote twice.\", \"\\u201cThe biggest worry I have is that those two systems will not talk with each other,\\u201d Ms. Huntley said. \\u201cHis desire is to eliminate fraud, but there is a vulnerability in the plan. I am concerned whether this can function with high integrity.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Huntley, who has served as elections administrator for eight years, said that when she took on the job, she pledged not to vote in either party\\u2019s primary so that she could maintain her role as a nonpartisan overseer.\", \"\\u201cI am truly trying to figure out how this is going to work,\\u201d she said.\"]","href_hash":"66e5a0805a2711ecacc9dff1e4b39180"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"66e5a0805a2711ecacc9dff1e4b39180"}},
