Her findings showed that they were actually from central Nevada.\", \"How the Sierra Nevada mountain range formed has long been the subject of scientific research. As new evidence is unearthed, the geological history of the region has changed multiple times. Some of the oldest rocks can be traced back over 450 million years, while the granite dates to around 220 million years.\", \"Around 100 million years ago there was a chain of volcanoes, some of which reached 20,000 feet. This is what Miller and colleagues refer to as the ancestral Sierra range.\", \"The team has now published two chapters in a Geological Society of America Special Paper that looks at the formation of the modern-day Sierra Nevada, saying the ancestral range and the mountains we see today were born at different times.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1933078/sierra-nevada.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Stock photo of the Sierra Nevada mountain range.

Activity in this region lasted for around 20 million years, and saw parts of western U.S. covered in thousands of feet of lava.\", \"These events saw the Great Basin rise up, making it the highest point in the U.S. for a period. The Sierra Nevada mountain range acted as a \\\"ramp\\\" to this high country in Nevada.\", \"This upheaval led to a new system of rivers that carried sediment southwards and deposited it in Death Valley for Miller and her team to analyze millions of years later.\", \"\\\"The material from those volcanoes made it all the way out to the Pacific side of the Sierra Nevada\\u2014that's how we know the region in central Nevada where the eruptions occurred was higher than everything else,\\\" Miller said in a statement.\", \"The land remained at a high elevation, they say, until around 10 million years ago. At this time, the western U.S. was pulled apart by basin and range faulting. This broke up the Nevada plateau and Sierra Nevada became the mountain range we see today.\", \"\\\"You need to know when things happened and how long it took things to happen to truly understand them in the geologic context,\\\" Miller said. \\\"It's an evolving story, and as we pick up more pieces, the story begins to get tighter and tighter.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"0c2e061046da11ecbc562189a82ed26e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0c2e061046da11ecbc562189a82ed26e"}},
