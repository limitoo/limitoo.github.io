Two male victims died at the hospital, police said, and eight more people were being treated for gunshot wounds. A police release initially said nine others were injured, but Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert revised the numbers at a noon press conference.\", \"Others were injured attempting to flee, with at least two people suffering broken bones by jumping out of the building's windows, authorities said. Shots were still being fired in the area as officers arrived at the scene, with young people fleeing,\\u00a0CBS Pittsburgh reported.\\u00a0\", \"Police said as many as 50 rounds were fired inside and several more were fired outside.

The house has been rented for bachelorette parties or other events before, or for families of baseball players due to its proximity to the stadium, but no problems have occurred, he said.\", \"Airbnb spokesperson Ben Breit confirmed the house was rented through the company. He said that the booker, who would have had to be 18 or older per Airbnb rules, has received a lifetime ban.
