Both the U.S. and Russia have openly begun testing such platforms, and recent reports in the Financial Times have suggested China has also conducted at least two tests this year.\", \"Among the top three powers, however, China has a unique nuclear policy. Beijing is the only one to have committed to a \\\"no-first-use\\\" policy, a pledge to not be the first to use nuclear weapons in the event of a conflict, and China has also traditionally not maintained a nuclear triad, or a combination of aerial, ground and naval warhead-equipped assets.\", \"But the latest Pentagon report saw potential changes in these realms, as Beijing and the ruling Chinese Communist Party continue their global rise.\", \"As for the no-first-use policy, the U.S. military observed \\\"some ambiguity,\\\" stating that \\\"there has also been no indication that national leaders are willing to publicly attach such additions, nuances, or caveats.\\\"\", \"\\\"The PRC's lack of transparency regarding the scope and scale of its nuclear modernization program, however, raises questions regarding its future intent as it fields larger, more capable nuclear forces,\\\" the report found. \\\"Some PLA officers have discussed the PRC using nuclear weapons first in cases like when a conventional attack threatens the survival of the PLA's nuclear force or the CCP itself.\\\"\", \"The report also found that China \\\"has possibly already established a nascent 'nuclear triad' with the development of a nuclear capable air-launched ballistic missile (ALBM) and improvement of its ground and sea-based nuclear capabilities.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926417/china-military-parade-df-21-icbm.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Military vehicles carry China's DF-41 nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missiles in a military parade at Tiananmen Square in Beijing on October 1, 2019, to mark the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.</div>\", \"At a time when U.S.-China relations continue to teeter on the brink of crisis over flashpoints such as Taiwan and the South China Sea, however, Beijing saw the latest report as an unhelpful addition to their dynamic.\", \"\\\"The Defense Department report, just like similar reports in the past, disregards facts and is filled with bias,\\\" Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin told a press conference on Thursday. \\\"The U.S. is using this report to hype up the 'China nuclear threat' theory.
