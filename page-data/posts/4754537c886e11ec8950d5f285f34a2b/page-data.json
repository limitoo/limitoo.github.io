On the first day alone, 77 extractions were performed and 43 fillings put in.\", \"\\\"Yeah, we used to be full,\\\" said Dental Health Wairoa co-owner Samarth Khanna, speaking from Auckland and reflecting on the more-than-2000 patients his surgery has on its books.\", \"\\\"That practice used to be booked out at least a month or two in advance.\\\"\", \"Samarth owns Dental Health Wairoa along with his father Sanjay and brother Samar.
