They are not.\\\"\", \"Tukaki also criticises anti-vaxxers who have threatened to attack vaccination centres, calling them \\\"irresponsible idiots\\\".\", \"\\\"The second message needs to be one of the right information - of the vaccination and its health or otherwise impacts on children and so on,\\\" Tukaki says.\", \"\\\"Informed parents create informed consent and that is what we need to aim for.\", \"\\\"To all of those irresponsible idiots out there who are saying they are going to attack vaccination centres - exactly where will you be if New Zealand children start losing their lives? I bet your bottom dollar they will move on to the next campaign slogan. Campaign slogans do not save lives - action does.\\\"\", \"Tukaki also has a message for those targeting retail and hospitality staff and those small businesses openly flouting the rules.\", \"\\\"Grow up and stop acting as if you are some sort of hero,\\\" he says.\", \"\\\"You're not heroes. People on our front lines including hospitality and retail, our health workforce and emergency services are the heroes. They have kept Aotearoa ticking.
