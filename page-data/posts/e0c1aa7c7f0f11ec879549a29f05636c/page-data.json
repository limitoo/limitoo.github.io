That would seem to make common sense.\", \"\\\"It would be hugely expensive and you've got to look at the cost-benefit argument. You could argue that Corteva pay for it to be pay for it to be completely remediated, but it has been an industrial site and that's what happens when you have an industrial site in an area there will be some contamination.\", \"\\\"But are the levels of contamination going to be harmful if its going to be used as an industrial site? Probably not.\\\"\", \"McBride, who has previously raised concerns about the land being rezoned residential, said disturbing the soil was not ideal.\", \"\\\"Well it does present more problems. If it was going to be used for industrial use -- in other words people weren't going to grow vegetables in it or use it recreationally -- there shouldn't be any problem at all.\\\"\", \"He could see some merit in combining the Paritutu site with the nearby reserve.\", \"\\\"Absolutely, and in which case target high risk areas and see if they are contaminated and that's they way to deal with it.\", \"\\\"The land should be returned to it's original state as nearly as possible, but the risk assessment needs to be done first and then there could be further discussion ... the local iwi [and council] needs to be assured that the levels of contamination there at present are safe if the land is to be used for recreational purposes.\\\"\", \"Environment Minister David Park replied to Holdom's letter saying that it was up to the district and regional council to make sure the Corteva property was safe and he expected the company to cooperate with any further investigations required to do so.\", \"The Taranaki Regional Council said it was not aware of any soil contamination at the Paritutu site at present, but it has previously acknowledge there are no records for soil contamination under the building where 2,4,5-T was made.\", \"It said any chance of land use for the site trigger a requirement for further investigation.\", \"\\\"Any future development or subdivision would need to meet the requirements of the National Environmental Standards for Assessing and Managing Contaminants to Soil to Protect Human Health, with site investigations by suitably qualified environmental professionals required to demonstrate suitability for that purpose.\\\"\", \"Under the Resource Management Act, the New Plymouth District Council would be responsible for ensuring that the site was suitable for the proposed new land use.\"]","href_hash":"e0c1aa7c7f0f11ec879549a29f05636c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e0c1aa7c7f0f11ec879549a29f05636c"}},
