Wade ruling, and for policymakers to protect access to abortions and those who perform them.\", \"In an open letter, organized by the Committee to Protect Health Care, they said abortions \\\"are an essential element of medical care.\\\"\", \"It comes as the high court prepares to hear historic arguments on Wednesday in a case that poses the biggest threat to abortion rights since the landmark 1973 ruling that declared a nationwide right to terminate a pregnancy.\", \"In Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, Mississippi is asking the court\\u2014which has a 6-3 conservative majority\\u2014to uphold a law that bans abortions after 15 weeks.\", \"Ahead of Wednesday's arguments, the open letter said patients needed abortions for a variety of reasons and \\\"as physicians who have a duty to care for our patients, we must protect the pregnant person's immediate or long term health and well-being.\\\"\", \"It read: \\\"Restrictive laws against abortions, such as the Texas and Mississippi laws currently being argued in the U.S. Supreme Court, effectively block individuals from a medical procedure that may be necessary for their health, safety, and general well-being.\\\"\", \"A month ago, justices heard arguments over a restrictive Texas law that got around Roe, as well as the 1992 ruling in Planned Parenthood v. Casey that reaffirmed Roe, and banned abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943043/activists-outside-supreme-court.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Activists hold light brigade at the Supreme Court on November 30, 2021 in Washington, DC.</div>\", \"The letter continued: \\\"These laws prevent doctors and health professionals from helping our patients who are seeking our counsel, regardless of the reason they may seek an abortion, be it that they have a pregnancy complication, a health or mental health condition, or that they just do not want to be pregnant now.\", \"\\\"Like every other medical decision, this decision must remain protected between health professionals and our patients.\\\"\", \"Forcing people who have chronic illnesses, have had a miscarriage or have been diagnosed with a serious medical condition to carry a pregnancy to term against their will could have life-threatening consequences, the letter warns.\", \"The letter also states that restrictive abortion laws would have a disproportionate impact on Black, Latino/Hispanic and Indigenous people, \\\"who already face significant health inequities and suffer profound health disparities, higher maternal mortality rates and more chronic conditions.\\\"\", \"It goes on to say that such laws could see entire communities lose access to a range of lifesaving services, such as cancer screening and prenatal care, if health centers that provide those services as well as abortions close.\", \"\\\"Doctors nationwide are deeply concerned about what will happen to the health and well-being of our patients should the Supreme Court overturn Roe v.
