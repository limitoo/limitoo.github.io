In the series of videos that followed, rescuers\\u2019 radios beep in the distance and the co-workers he had huddled together with could be heard gasping. \\u201cThey\\u2019re trying to get us,\\u201d Mr. Holt, 32, said, pausing to spit out dust that had gotten in his mouth. Still, he feared he would not make it.\", \"\\u201cI love y\\u2019all,\\u201d he said as he held his cellphone\\u2019s camera up to his face. \\u201cEvery one of y\\u2019all, I love y\\u2019all. I\\u2019m sorry.\\u201d\", \"Hours later, he was in a hospital room in Nashville. One of his lungs was bruised. Ribs were broken. But he was alive, and for that, he was grateful. \\u201cI\\u2019ve seen better days,\\u201d he said in a telephone interview, as a nurse checked his vital signs and brought him apple juice. \\u201cI\\u2019m not missing any limbs and I\\u2019m not dead.\\u201d\", \"He questioned whether he should have gone in for that night shift. He also questioned if the company, Mayfield Consumer Products, should have even stayed open in light of the bad weather. Still, he reported for his evening shift at 5 p.m. on Friday at the plant where he works in the wax and fragrance department, where he mixes the chemicals to pour into kettles to make candles. He had gotten the job two months ago through a temporary worker service. \\u201cThey paid well. They gave a lot of leeway to people,\\u201d he said.\", \"As the warnings grew increasingly dire, he said, some of his co-workers were still joking around. \\u201cEverybody is looking at their phones,\\u201d he said. \\u201cMy phone\\u2019s saying there\\u2019s a tornado, they\\u2019ve seen one. People were still taking it lightly.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHey, man,\\u201d he told one co-worker, \\u201cget underneath this and ball up.\\u201d He heard the wind and rain come and then it all seemed to happen in a flash.\", \"He shoved his older brother, who also works at the factory, to the ground and grabbed a few others who were trying to run away. They sought cover behind the towering racks holding the buckets of chemicals used to give the candles their scents. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been deployed, done tours,\\u201d Mr. Holt said, noting that he had served in the U.S. Army and was a door gunner on a Chinook helicopter. \\u201cThis is the scariest thing I\\u2019ve been through in my life because there\\u2019s nothing you can do. You\\u2019re at the mercy of somebody else and you hope they care enough to get you out. That was the scariest moment in my life.\\u201d\", \"He believes his military training saved him. \\u201cI went into that mode of \\u2018I might be losing a leg, I might be losing an arm, but I will survive,\\u2019\\u201d he recalled.\", \"He was grateful to emerge intact, pulled from the rubble at around 2 a.m. on Saturday. Still, he worried. His brother had been taken to a hospital in Paducah, their hometown, almost 30 miles from the factory. Bricks had fallen on his neck and he\\u2019d had trouble breathing. \\u201cI still don\\u2019t know all the severity of all that,\\u201d Mr. Holt said from his own hospital bed.\", \"He was waiting for a cousin who was driving to Nashville to see him and fill him in on his brother\\u2019s condition. \\u201cI\\u2019m pretty sure he\\u2019s messed up real bad.\\u201d\", \"Finally, by Saturday evening, his phone\\u2019s battery was recharged. He had been bombarded by messages. \\u201cNow that I look, everybody is like, \\u2018you made me cry, I thought you was dead for real,\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cI thought I was dead. That\\u2019s why I made the video.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"1b544a805b7c11ecb769bfef29b52f3c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1b544a805b7c11ecb769bfef29b52f3c"}},
