It seems to be from all sorts of ages including, sadly, many elderly victims,\\\" she says.\", \"The government denies having a hard-line 'no eviction' policy, despite not evicting any K\\u0101inga Ora tenants in the past three years.\", \"Associate Minister of Housing Poto Williams has said evictions do happen in \\\"very rare circumstances\\\" but has not been able to say what would warrant such action.\", \"Instead, Williams says a 'sustainable tenancies' approach had seen 159 households transferred for anti-social behaviour in the last 12 months.\", \"Thorn said not only was this \\\"unquestionably\\\" breaking the law but K\\u0101inga Ora was also fighting cases through the Tenancy Tribunal on taxpayer dollars.\", \"\\\"I personally find it just astounding that this Government agency is making these poor people go to Housing New Zealand.
