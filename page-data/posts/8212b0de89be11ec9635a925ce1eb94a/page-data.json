It\\u2019s going to be 90 percent rejection with many \\u2018casualties\\u2019 along the way, and you must constantly shift your strategy to find new ways forward.\\u201d\", \"Hopkins, 70, who joined the organization as a 29-year-old development officer in 1979, became its president in 1999, and discovered early on she had \\u201cthe fund-raising gene.\\u201d During a long tenure (she retired in 2015), her tenacity and ability to raise money for ambitious experimental projects was a vital element in establishing the academy as a cultural force and a hub for must-see work by artists like Peter Brook, Laurie Anderson, Ivo van Hove and Pina Bausch.\", \"Her memoir, which will be published by powerHouse Books on March 1, combines personal history, fund-raising strategies and an informal account of some of the academy\\u2019s most memorable stagings and artists. It will have its official book launch on Feb. 17 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where Hopkins will discuss her career with Oskar Eustis, the Public Theater\\u2019s artistic director.\", \"Hopkins recounts her early years spent working with the visionary arts programmer Harvey Lichtenstein and \\u2014 after he retired \\u2014 her extensive tenure as president alongside Joseph V. Melillo, the academy\\u2019s executive producer.\", \"\\u201cKaren was the person standing right behind Harvey, who took up a lot of space, quietly doing a lot of very crucial things,\\u201d Anderson said in a phone interview. \\u201cNot just with presenting work, but in the initiatives with the neighborhood and the audience.\\u201d\", \"Together, Melillo and Hopkins extended Lichtenstein\\u2019s uncompromising legacy.\", \"\\u201cWe had a shared vision for BAM,\\u201d Melillo wrote in an email. \\u201cI had the confidence as I curated the artists and their works for the three stages that she would identify the financial resources.\\u201d\", \"During their tenure (Melillo retired from the position in 2018), the academy\\u2019s artistic budget grew from $21 million to $52 million; Hopkins established an endowment that now stands at $100 million; and the BAM campus expanded to include a new theater, the Richard B. Fisher Building, and a new building project, BAM Strong, to link three of its spaces.\", \"Hopkins, who has an MFA in directing, said her theater background meant that she had always remained profoundly connected to the work onstage and to the priority of an artistic vision.\", \"\\u201cI have been so lucky to have these great artistic partners, Harvey and Joe,\\u201d she said in a recent video interview. \\u201cWe were all in it together. For us, BAM wasn\\u2019t a job, it was a crusade.\\u201d\", \"Over a two-hour anecdote-filled conversation, Hopkins \\u2014 now a senior adviser to the Onassis Foundation \\u2014 picked out some highlights of her time at the academy. \\u201cI love talking about BAM,\\u201d she said.\", \"Lichtenstein \\u201cwould do anything,\\u201d Hopkins said, for the British born, France-based director Peter Brook. So when Brook, in 1986, suggested a nine-hour adaptation of an ancient Hindu epic, which he had developed with Jean-Claude Carri\\u00e8re, the answer, naturally, was an immediate yes. \\u201cThe Mahabharata\\u201d was produced by the academy the following year.\", \"\\u201cWe created a new theater just for that show,\\u201d she recounted, describing the renovation of the dilapidated Majestic Theater into what is now called the BAM Harvey, a block away from the main theater, which Brook felt was too formal a space for the work.\", \"\\u201cIt was like moving a small country to New York and having them live here for a month,\\u201d Hopkins said. \\u201cAnd we had no money to do it.\\u201d But after she heard Brook describe the genesis of the work she decided \\u201cthis was the greatest fund-raising story of all time.\\u201d She took the director and a group of donors to see the play in Paris, where it had been staged at Brook\\u2019s home theater, the Bouffes du Nord, raising the money in a relatively short time.\", \"\\u201cIn the world of Brook, there is no real separation between spectator and performer, between the past and the present; they exist side by side in the theater and in life,\\u201d Hopkins said. \\u201cWhat you saw was the most profound combination of theatricality and the human condition finding an expression that was mind-blowing.\\u201d\", \"The pioneering, avant-garde work of the composer Laurie Anderson came to the academy soon after Lichtenstein started the Next Wave Series (which became the Next Wave Festival in 1983). \\u201cIn 1982, we did \\u2018United States,\\u2019 Hopkins recounted. \\u201cIt was risky to put an artist who wasn\\u2019t that well-known in a 2,000-seat opera house, but the work was a masterpiece. She held the stage for hours as a musician, a storyteller and a visual artist, and the entire show, a remarkable comment on America, was her conception. You felt you were watching an artist really come into her own.\\u201d\", \"Anderson\\u2019s work was everything Lichtenstein wanted: \\u201cgenre-bending, breaking forms, offering new ways of bringing shows to the stage,\\u201d Hopkins said.\", \"Many South African plays were presented at the academy over the years, but one that resonated most forcefully for Hopkins was \\u201cThe Island,\\u201d in 2003, starring John Kani and Winston Ntshona, who wrote the play with Athol Fugard.\", \"\\u201c\\u2018The Island\\u2019 was a piece that was like an arrow to your heart,\\u201d Hopkins said, \\u201clike the most intense short story you ever read.\\u201d She added: \\u201cIt was simple, dark and profound. You were on the island with them, and in an hour you understood what they had been through for so long. Of course, it was really about Mandela, and you understood that when people are confined in an utterly inhospitable place, yet find each other and are committed to the same cause, there is a beauty and purity to the friendship that is a life bond.\\u201d\", \"Kani and Ntshona were \\u201ca partnership, a chemistry made in heaven,\\u201d she said.\", \"Watching a post-apartheid play by Nicholas Wright, \\u201cA Human Being Died That Night,\\u201d at BAM in 2015, offered \\u201ca remarkable historical trajectory told by theater,\\u201d she added. \\u201cWhen you stay in a place for 36 years, you realize it\\u2019s not about one season, even 10 seasons. It\\u2019s about generations of artists, and about history.\\u201d\", \"When Lichtenstein, who was a dancer before becoming an arts administrator, saw the work of the German choreographer Pina Bausch, \\u201che absolutely went berserk,\\u201d Hopkins said.\", \"\\u201cCaf\\u00e9 M\\u00fcller,\\u201d one of the first shows Bausch and her Tanztheater Wuppertal ensemble presented at the academy in 1984, was a revelation, Hopkins said. \\u201cEach artist had a distinctive personality and role, and you knew them like you knew actors.\\u201d\", \"The works were often \\u201ccrazily difficult\\u201d to stage, she added. \\u201cFor \\u2018Arien,\\u2019 we needed tons of water to rain on the stage, and by mistake toxic waste was delivered and had to be removed from our parking lot by guys in hazmat suits.\\u201d In \\u201cPalermo Palermo,\\u201d a wall stretching across the stage had to fall; in \\u201cNelken\\u201d thousands of carnations had to be installed over the whole stage.\", \"\\u201cOne year we did \\u2018Bluebeard,\\u2019 which had a million dead leaves onstage,\\u201d Hopkins added. \\u201cIt was June, 90 degrees and we had no air conditioning. One critic said it smelled like a compost heap.\\u201d\", \"The Tanztheater Wuppertal was a huge audience draw for the academy. \\u201cPina was a discovery who became a blockbuster,\\u201d Hopkins said.\", \"Samuel Beckett\\u2019s experimental, difficult and poetic work was a natural fit for the academy, Hopkins said, and Melillo was particularly keen on finding new productions of his work. Two in particular, stand out for her.\", \"In \\u201cHappy Days,\\u201d directed by Deborah Warner, \\u201cthe great Fiona Shaw found the yin and yang of that role in a way I had never seen,\\u201d Hopkins said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not every actress who can be buried up to her neck, and communicate both the desperation of her circumstances and an optimism despite them. You were laughing and crying at the same time.\\u201d\", \"The other enduring memory, she said, was of John Turturro playing Hamm in a wheelchair, with Max Casella as Clov, in the \\u201cunrelenting and unforgiving\\u201d play \\u201cEndgame.\\u201d\", \"One night, she recalled, the wheelchair collapsed, sending Turturro flying through the air. \\u201cHe never broke character, even when the stagehands came on to pick him and the wheelchair off the floor,\\u201d Hopkins said. \\u201cThe audience went nuts that night.\\u201d\", \"Lichtenstein discovered the work of the American director Robert Wilson, who was making a name for himself in Europe, around the time he took over at the Academy in 1967. \\u201cHarvey, in his most avant-garde heart, loved Robert Wilson, and felt he was on a divine mission to make sure that Bob\\u2019s large-scale work was seen in the U.S.,\\u201d Hopkins said. \\u201cThere was almost no one in the audience for early pieces like \\u2018Deafman Glance,\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cOr they would go home, do some laundry, come back; the pieces went on for hours!\\u201d\", \"In 1984, Lichtenstein told his team that they needed to raise $300,000 to present a Wilson collaboration with the composer Philip Glass, called \\u201cEinstein on the Beach.\\u201d Hopkins agreed. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how, but we\\u2019ll do it,\\u201d she said.\", \"\\u201cEinstein\\u201d was a success. \\u201cAfter that the legend just grew and grew,\\u201d she said; the show returned to the Academy in 1992 and in 2012. \\u201cBob works in a very inside-out way, not traditionally theatrical and very stylized,\\u201d Hopkins said. \\u201cBut it comes from the gut and although the pieces can look cold, they are not. The heat comes from the ice around it; it\\u2019s an artistic trip.\\u201d\", \"She added that she particularly loved his 2014 adaptation of the Soviet writer Daniil Kharms\\u2019s \\u201cThe Old Woman\\u201d with Mikhail Baryshnikov and Willem Dafoe. \\u201cIt was devastating, about someone starving to death, and you felt it,\\u201d she said.\"]","href_hash":"8212b0de89be11ec9635a925ce1eb94a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8212b0de89be11ec9635a925ce1eb94a"}},
