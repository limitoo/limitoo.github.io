He was 83.\", \"His death was confirmed by his wife, Donna, who said he had lived with chronic heart problems.\", \"Mr. Tutt was singing jingles and drumming in local bands in Dallas when, in his early 30s, he was hired to play drums in Presley\\u2019s TCB (Taking Care of Business) band for a series of historic engagements at the International Hotel outside Las Vegas in 1969.\", \"Presley\\u2019s four-week residency there marked his triumphant return to the stage after an eight-year hiatus, reviving a career hampered by uninspired movie roles and an image that had lost relevance in the face of the \\u201960s counterculture.\", \"The comeback \\u2014 a transformation that also invigorated Las Vegas\\u2019s nightclub scene \\u2014 was due in no small part to the strength of Presley\\u2019s rhythm section, a dozen of whose performances were documented on the live portion of the 1969 album \\u201cFrom Memphis to Vegas/From Vegas to Memphis.\\u201d Foremost among them was a racing take, nearly eight minutes long, of \\u201cSuspicious Minds\\u201d featuring Mr. Tutt\\u2019s hyperkinetic, barely controlled drumming.\", \"Mr. Tutt\\u2019s powerful yet nuanced style enlivened many of Presley\\u2019s studio recordings from this period as well, including \\u201cBurning Love,\\u201d a Top 10 pop hit in 1972 that lives up to its incendiary title. Admired for his use of cymbals, Mr. Tutt was known for his ability to anticipate Presley\\u2019s moves onstage and accentuate them on the drums.\", \"\\u201cElvis always bragged how you intuitively could keep up with his stage moves, even when he tried to trick you,\\u201d Presley\\u2019s ex-wife, Priscilla Presley, wrote in a tribute addressed to Mr. Tutt on Instagram.\", \"Mr. Tutt did studio work for other artists while in Presley\\u2019s employ. He provided empathetic support to Billy Joel\\u2019s 1974 Top 40 hit \\u201cPiano Man.\\u201d He contributed propulsive cymbal and snare rhythms to Gram Parsons\\u2019s \\u201cOoh Las Vegas,\\u201d a 1974 recording that featured Emmylou Harris on vocals. In the 1970s, Mr. Tutt played in both Ms. Harris\\u2019s Hot Band and the Jerry Garcia Band.\", \"Working concurrently with Presley and Garcia, the Grateful Dead founder and lead guitarist, proved a study in contrasts, Mr. Tutt said: His work with Presley was meticulously rehearsed, his sessions with Garcia more impromptu and improvisational, akin to jazz.\", \"\\u201cElvis\\u2019s music was a lot more in your face; you could never play enough,\\u201d he recalled in a 2017 interview with Rolling Stone. \\u201cWith Jerry we never talked about it, but I just knew that my role with that band, no matter what configuration it was, was to help keep it together. We weren\\u2019t there to do flashy solos.\\u201d\", \"Ronald Ellis Tutt was born on March 12, 1938, in Dallas, the only child of Frank and Gladys Tutt. His father owned a dry-cleaning business; his mother was a homemaker.\", \"Young Ronnie took dance lessons at an early age. His first instrument was ukulele, followed by guitar, violin and trumpet. He did not begin playing the drums until his senior year in high school.\", \"\\u201cWhen I was 3, I started dancing, so the rhythm of everything was more important to me than the melodic,\\u201d Mr. Tutt said, discussing his affinity for the drums in a 2016 interview with the website Elvis Australia. \\u201cI was frustrated with playing trumpet and guitar because I wanted to express myself rhythmically. It was a very easy transition.\\u201d\", \"He worked as a drummer with Presley until Presley\\u2019s death in 1977. He then played on recordings by the Carpenters, Mink DeVille and others before joining Mr. Diamond\\u2019s band, as a drummer and background singer, in 1981. Onstage, Mr. Tutt routinely drew ovations for his drum crescendos during performances of Mr. Diamond\\u2019s 1969 pop hit \\u201cHolly Holy.\\u201d\", \"He remained with Mr. Diamond until 2018, while continuing to do studio work on projects like Mr. Costello\\u2019s \\u201cKing of America\\u201d (1986) and Los Lobos\\u2019 \\u201cBy the Light of the Moon\\u201d (1987). From 1997 to the mid-2010s he also appeared in \\u201cElvis: The Concert,\\u201d a touring extravaganza that featured video footage of Presley performing, with new live backing by members of the TCB band and other musicians.\", \"In addition to his wife, Mr. Tutt is survived by seven daughters, Cindy Rutter, Tina Dempsey, Christine Edson, Terie Tutt, Rhonda Henderson, Elisia Notermann and Rachael Dodson; two sons, Ron Jr. and Jared; 16 grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren. Another son, Nathan, died 10 years ago.\", \"Though he was not known as a producer, Mr. Tutt served in that role, albeit uncredited, on \\u201cBurning Love\\u201d while Felton Jarvis, Presley\\u2019s regular producer, was recovering from a kidney transplant.\", \"\\u201cHe was lying on his back in the control room at RCA,\\u201d Mr. Tutt said of Mr. Jarvis in his interview with Elvis Australia. \\u201cEmery Gordy came up with the bass line, and I produced the record for Felton \\u2014 you know, the whole session.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt more described the kind of music that we were trying to get Elvis to do at the time,\\u201d he said of \\u201cBurning Love\\u201d and the aspirations that he and other members of Presley\\u2019s Nashville rhythm section had for the session. \\u201cSo I take a little pride in that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"edf6ba443b4811ec94b1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"edf6ba443b4811ec94b1000017025a03"}},
