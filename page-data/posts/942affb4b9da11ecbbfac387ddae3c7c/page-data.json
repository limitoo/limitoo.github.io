The health agency encouraged\\u00a0men who are gay, bisexual and have sex with men and live in the state to get vaccinated against the disease.\\u00a0\", \"It also said men who are visiting the state should speak to their healthcare provider about the MenACWY vaccine, which prevents the disease. The vaccine comes in a one dose series, or two doses for those who live with HIV. People who are traveling to Florida should get vaccinated at least two weeks before their trip.\", \"The disease can be transmitted during extended close contact or direct contact, like sharing drinks or kissing, according to the CDC. It is not as transmissible as something like the cold or the flu.\\u00a0\", \"Meningococcal disease usually presents as an infection of meningitis or a bloodstream infection about three to seven days after exposure, the CDC said. Both are serious and can be deadly.\\u00a0\", \"Meningococcal disease is treatable with antibiotics, but they must begin soon after symptoms begin, the CDC said, as one to two in every 10 people who contract the disease die.\", \"Additionally, the CDC said outbreaks have been reported on college campuses in Florida. It encouraged preteens between the ages of 11 and 12 to get one dose of the vaccine. Then, teenagers can get a booster shot at the age of 16.\"]","href_hash":"942affb4b9da11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"942affb4b9da11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
