You get the idea. Jessica More lampooned it on her TikTok account, Zillowtastrophes, telling her 331,000 followers, \\u201cDon\\u2019t ever let anyone tell you that you can\\u2019t find a paying job as a mediocre artist.\\u201d Over on It\\u2019s That Real Estate Chick, Lauren Matera, a TikToker and real estate broker, mocked a listing for a $15 million mansion in California, asking \\u201cWhat in the Barbie Dream House is this?\\u201d when she happened across photos of a purple glass chandelier that looked like \\u201ca gigantic upside-down Christmas tree.\\u201d And at Zillow Gone Wild, on Instagram, Samir Mezrahi lamented that his 1.3 million followers had missed their chance to bid on a burned-out house in Melrose, Mass., listed for $399,000. \\u201cThis home is already pending, so it may be too late to buy,\\u201d he wrote in the caption alongside the blackened facade.\", \"Where Zillow offers us a window into what is possible, the social media accounts that troll it provide us the chance to scoff at what never should have been. With absurdist humor, this small band of influencers sifts through hundreds of listings so we don\\u2019t have to, delivering the gems \\u2014 the faux Texas castle with a requisite faux drawbridge; the Florida house of infinite closets that looks like someone\\u2019s personal Manhattan Mini Storage, and an entire house outfitted like a shrine to Coca-Cola.\", \"Sure, people do use Zillow to actually try to buy homes. But in a market where listings are scarce and prices are stratospheric, even serious shopping can feel more aspirational than educational. Lose enough bidding wars, and eventually you realize you\\u2019re just clicking through images of a fantasy life that will never be yours. Or, as a \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d sketch from last February put it, \\u201cThe pleasure you once got from sex now comes from looking at other people\\u2019s houses.\\u201d\", \"Since there\\u2019s only so much real estate envy a person can take, these social media critics remind us that we might not actually want what we can\\u2019t have.\", \"\\u201cWhat a lot of people get out of it is: Money doesn\\u2019t buy taste. There is definitely a demographic of people out there that see this as a justification that wealthy people are too wealthy,\\u201d said Parker Sullivan, a 20-year-old college student who lives with his parents in Colorado and created The Best of Zillow on Twitter in November 2020. \\u201cThere have been plenty of guillotine jokes.\\u201d\", \"The influencers insist it\\u2019s not all meanspirited. It may be fun to poke fun at someone\\u2019s carnival-slash-disco-themed Jersey Shore beach house, but there are also the homes that are time capsules, preserved relics reminding us that there was a moment in recent history (I\\u2019m talking to you, the \\u201990s) when ivy vines were completely acceptable kitchen d\\u00e9cor.\", \"\\u201cPeople do love carpet, like a \\u201970s home that hasn\\u2019t been touched. Those are like gold. I get really excited when I see one of those,\\u201d said Mr. Mezrahi, 39, the deputy director of social media at Buzzfeed, who launched Zillow Gone Wild in December 2020.\", \"If Instagram aims to convince homeowners that every kitchen in America must be a quartz wonderland entirely devoid of color, these accounts show us that plenty of people did not get the memo. Instead, more people than you might think are all in on the 1980s gilded ballroom theme. If brokers insist that homeowners strip their houses of all personality before they put them on the market, painting the walls greige and stuffing the rooms with midcentury modern furnishings, these homes beg to tell a different story.\", \"And that different story is surprisingly alluring.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not the houses themselves, it\\u2019s who lives there. What made somebody make that decision?\\u201d said Ms. More, 34, who lives in Philadelphia, works in communications and started Zillowtastrophes last December. \\u201cThere is something celebratory in the weirdness or awfulness.\\u201d\", \"She finds most of her examples by sifting through listings around the country, narrowing her searches with keywords like \\u201cindoor pool,\\u201d \\u201ccastle\\u201d or \\u201cunique.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cEvery listing that is truly crazy uses the word \\u2018unique,\\u2019\\u201d she said.\", \"As baffled as she is by the sheer volume of poor design choices out there, Ms. More also admires the subjects of her videos for their commitment to kitsch. \\u201cIt\\u2019s probably their life\\u2019s dream to build a house that looks like a castle, because, honestly, a lot of money went into making your house look like a very mediocre Medieval Times castle,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd so I\\u2019m not going to totally tear it down and say it\\u2019s a piece of garbage.\\u201d\", \"Madeleine Stearn, 27, who works in digital marketing for a home-renovation company, likens the experience of doom-watching listings to listening to a murder podcast \\u2014 the deeper you delve into all the pictures, the harder it is too look away. \\u201cYou might start the tour, things look fairly normal and not outdated, and then there is this turning point where things get very weird,\\u201d said Ms. Stearn, who is a fan of several accounts. \\u201cWith all of these posts, you come away with far more questions than answers, and just these unanswerable questions.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Matera, of It\\u2019s That Real Estate Chick, sees her role as more of an educator than entertainer for her 350,000 followers. In her day job, Ms. Matera, 34, is a Coldwell Banker Realty saleswoman in Annapolis, Md., and hopes that maybe her video commentary will school a few clueless sellers.\", \"\\u201cWhen you\\u2019re living in the house, do what makes you happy,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut when it comes time to sell, you have to understand that those things are highly distracting to the buyer. When you have a cow kitchen, they\\u2019re not focused on how beautiful your woodwork is, how high-quality your cabinets are. They\\u2019re going, \\u2018Holy moly, that\\u2019s a lot of cows.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"And what\\u2019s more fun than scrolling through a whole bunch of cows?\"]","href_hash":"2ca0dffc493d11ecb7e06b0872d4d9c2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2ca0dffc493d11ecb7e06b0872d4d9c2"}},
