Rowling\\u2019s later novels in the series came in twice as thick, or more, as the first. The lengths of the film versions peaked with the adaptation of that final volume, \\u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows,\\u201d split into two parts running a combined four and a half hours. In 2018, \\u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\\u201d \\u2014 an original play by Jack Thorne, based on a story by Thorne, Rowling and John Tiffany \\u2014 opened on Broadway at the lavishly remodeled Lyric Theater. Also split in two, the total experience clocked in at more than five hours.\", \"But now Harry seems to have shrunk. After a pandemic closure (and reported problems with production costs), \\u201cCursed Child\\u201d has returned, shorter and more streamlined, its two parts collapsed into a single one and its length reduced by a third. The creators have kept quiet on the mechanics of this revision; call it \\u201cHarry Potter and the Mysterious Abridgment.\\u201d I assume someone pointed a wand at the published script and shouted, \\u201cBrevioso!\\u201d\", \"The new version, which opened on Tuesday, does feel smaller \\u2014 its themes starker, its concession to fandom more blatant. But as directed by Tiffany and choreographed by Steven Hoggett, with an essential score from Imogen Heap, it remains diamond-sharp in its staging and dazzling in its visual imagination, as magical as any spell or potion.\", \"The essence of the plot hasn\\u2019t changed. \\u201cCursed Child\\u201d still opens where the epilogue of \\u201cDeathly Hallows\\u201d leaves off, 19 years after the book\\u2019s climactic Battle of Hogwarts. On their way to that school of witchcraft and wizardry are Albus Potter (James Romney) \\u2014 the second son of Harry Potter (Steve Haggard, in for James Snyder at the performance I attended) and Ginny Potter (Diane Davis) \\u2014 and Rose Granger-Weasley (Nadia Brown), the daughter of Hermione Granger (Jenny Jules) and Ron Weasley (David Abeles).\", \"Aboard the Hogwarts Express, Albus meets Scorpius Malfoy (Brady Dalton Richards), the son of Harry\\u2019s former nemesis Draco Malfoy (Aaron Bartz), who offers him sweets. Albus and Scorpius\\u2019s burgeoning friendship upsets both of their fathers, complicating already fraught relationships and imperiling the entire wizarding world. Because what is Harry Potter without a threatened apocalypse and the occasional chocolate frog?\", \"The audience experience begins long before the lights go down, through the sumptuous lobby and into the auditorium. Every carpet, curtain, light fixture and wallpaper strip helps to immerse you into the Potterverse. It\\u2019s a marvel of imagination, and more shows should think about extending design beyond the stage. Even the reminder to wear a mask is presented as a boarding announcement for the Hogwarts Express.\", \"In the opening moments, that train seems to have been refitted as a high-speed rail. Everyone moved and spoke so fast \\u2014 Jules and Richards were almost unintelligible \\u2014 I was briefly worried that this new version was simply the old one played at 1.5 times speed. I once counted two consecutive seconds in which nothing happened onstage. Once only.\", \"Yet there are excisions, most of them so surgical you would never notice, though I did slightly miss the beloved Hogwarts groundskeeper Hagrid. Other changes are more pointed, like the rendering of Albus and Scorpius\\u2019s relationship as explicitly romantic, which has a knock-on effect of flattening the father-son conflict. Gone too are the dream sequences that bolstered the play\\u2019s mournful tenor and provided much of its exposition.\", \"With a lot of that context missing, the show is now more difficult to recommend to anyone not already versed in Potteralia. (Surely there must be someone left?) The most audible reaction I heard came when a character announced herself as Dolores Umbridge, a revelation that means nothing without knowledge of the books and films. Luckily, I had brought along my daughter, an 8-year-old who has made her own butterbeer and strongly identifies as a Gryffindor.\", \"At intermission, she turned to me, eyes bright and round as golden snitches. \\u201cThis movie has great special effects!\\u201d she said. She often calls plays movies, a beautiful way to troll her theater critic mother. Still, I couldn\\u2019t entirely disagree. The original \\u201cCursed Child,\\u201d with its luxuriant running time and hyperfocus \\u2014 for better and worse \\u2014 on the emotional lives of its characters, felt explicitly theatrical, the wresting of a real work of dramatic art from a massively popular franchise. This new version remains ravishingly entertaining, but is also, like the movie adaptations, a more obvious attempt to cash in on Pottermania.\", \"Yet there are loads of films \\u2014 even those with the extravagant C.G.I. budgets of the \\u201cHarry Potter\\u201d movies \\u2014 that come nowhere near approaching the magic of Tiffany\\u2019s staging, enhanced by Christine Jones\\u2019s set, Katrina Lindsay\\u2019s costumes, Neil Austin\\u2019s lighting and Gareth Fry\\u2019s sound. Jamie Harrison\\u2019s illusions, the stuff of phoenix feather and unicorn horn, are an absolute astonishment. (Were fire marshals ensorcelled into approving this show\\u2019s pyrotechnics?) During the sped-up beginning, I wondered, darkly, if the show could now exist as just another theme park attraction. It\\u2019s more than that. Besides, three and a half hours of enchantment is still a hell of a ride.\"]","href_hash":"94db93a857cc11ecafe56bcdc6dd784d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"94db93a857cc11ecafe56bcdc6dd784d"}},
