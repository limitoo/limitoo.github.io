Five percent of those polled said they wouldn't cast their ballot at all.\", \"The findings come after a significant red wave in the 2021 elections. Republicans swept top offices in Virginia, including governor and attorney general, just one year after President Joe Biden won the state by double digits.\", \"The GOP also made gains in local races in New York, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. One of the most shocking upsets of the election cycle was in New Jersey, where Republican Edward Durr defeated longtime Democratic state senator Stephen Sweeney. Durr is a furniture truck driver who only spent a few thousand dollars on the race.\", \"Following the party's strong showing on November 2 contests, bookmakers said the odds of Republicans winning control of Congress got better.\", \"The latest The Economist/YouGov poll showed the GOP has also improved its standing among U.S. adults. At the beginning of the month, Democrats held a 7-point advantage over Republican candidates in a generic congressional matchup.\", \"Democrats currently enjoy majority control of the House of Representatives and Senate but by narrow margins. Historical precedent is on the Republican Party's side heading into next year's races, as midterm elections tend to be a referendum on the party in charge.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939752/republicans-democrats-locked-dead-heat-poll.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Less than a year from the 2022 midterm elections, a new poll found Democrats and Republicans are tied for support among Americans.

Thirty-eight percent of respondents said they \\\"strongly disapprove\\\" of the way he's handled his responsibilities as president.\", \"Biden addressed his sinking approval numbers last month, stating he's \\\"not running because of the polls.\\\"\", \"\\\"The polls are going to go up and down and down,\\\" Biden said at a press conference during an international trip to Rome. \\\"They were high early, then they got medium, then they went back up, now they're low. Well look, look at every other president. The same thing has happened.\\\"\", \"The new The Economist/YouGov surveyed 1,500 Americans between November 20 and November 23.
