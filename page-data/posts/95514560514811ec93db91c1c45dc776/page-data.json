Still, comparing its mutations with those of other \\u201cvariants of concern\\u201d identified by the World Health Organization suggests that Omicron can be expected to have enhanced transmissibility and some level of immune escape, Mr. Karim said.\", \"The concern in South Africa was prompted in part by a sudden increase in the country\\u2019s test positivity rate, which rose to nearly 10 percent from 1 percent, according to data released by South Africa\\u2019s National Institute for Communicable Diseases.\", \"The increase largely stems from cases in Gauteng Province, a densely populated economic hub that is home to Johannesburg, said Michelle Groome, head of public health surveillance and response at the institute. But based on the data, the number of new recorded cases is still lower in South Africa, relative to its population, than in many European countries.\", \"The country\\u2019s administrative capital, Pretoria, where 219 people are hospitalized with Covid, is at the center of the new wave, according to data from the institute. But scientists do not yet know how many of these hospitalizations were a direct result of Omicron.\", \"While new hospital admissions are still relatively low, there has been a \\u201csteep rise\\u201d over the past two weeks, said Waasila Jassat, a public health specialist at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases.\", \"The rate of fatalities has not increased, Ms. Jassat said. While new cases were highest among people under 35, hospitalizations were more common among people over 65 and very young children.\", \"Existing coronavirus treatments seemed to be effective against Omicron, Mr. Karim said, though there was not enough data yet on the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies, which are rarely used to treat Covid-19 in South Africa. \", \"It is also still too early to know whether the potency of the variant warrants tightened precautions like travel bans, scientists said.\", \"In a separate briefing on Sunday, Botswana\\u2019s health minister, Edwin Dikoloti, said that most of the 19 Omicron cases that have been detected in his country were \\u201cimported,\\u201d and that the first four were diplomats who had already left the country.\", \"He criticized early references to Omicron as the \\u201cBotswana variant,\\u201d saying that \\u201cdetection was treated as origination.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Dikoloti said that new coronavirus cases had been declining in Botswana, and that \\u201cthe emergence of this variant\\u201d threatened \\u201cto reverse all gains that we have made over the months.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"95514560514811ec93db91c1c45dc776"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"95514560514811ec93db91c1c45dc776"}},
