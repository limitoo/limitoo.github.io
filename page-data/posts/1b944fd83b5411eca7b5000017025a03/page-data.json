His breakout season helped power Atlantaâ€™s surge to the World Series.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-01T20:42:04.000Z","content":"[\"ATLANTA \\u2014 When Atlanta seized a three-games-to-one lead over Houston, the team had plenty of hang time while attempting to win its first World Series since 1995. So it makes sense that the team\\u2019s newest star was an all-state punter in high school.\", \"In the regular-season stretch and again in October, Austin Riley heard plenty of \\u201cM.V.P.! M.V.P.!\\u201d chants at Truist Park. It\\u2019s no wonder: In just his third major league season \\u2014 and his first in which he was an everyday player for a full, 162-game year \\u2014 Riley ranked second in the National League in R.B.I. (107) and total bases (313), third in hits (179), sixth in batting average (.303) and 10th in homers (33). He drove home the winning run with a single in the bottom of the ninth in Game 1 of the National League Championship Series against Los Angeles and was batting .294 with three R.B.I. in the first four games of the World Series.\", \"But in Southeastern Conference country, Atlanta baseball fans starved for a title can thank the demands of high school football for pushing Riley, a slugging third baseman, toward the diamond.\", \"Riley, 24, was a quarterback as a freshman and sophomore at DeSoto Central High School in Southaven, Miss. He was also a budding baseball star. Those two paths collided when his football coach told him that he could not miss seven-on-seven summer drills after his sophomore year.\", \"\\u201cHe told me, \\u2018We\\u2019ve got another guy here, and he\\u2019s really dedicated,\\u2019\\u201d Riley said while standing in the Atlanta dugout on Saturday. \\u201cIt\\u2019s one of those things where I wanted to play quarterback but at the same time I knew I loved baseball and I wanted to pursue that.\\u201d\", \"When Riley decided not to play football, the coach invited him to stay on the team as a kicker.\", \"Sure, Riley said, why not?\", \"\\u201cI punted, did field goals, which I was terrible at,\\u201d Riley said. \\u201cI hit the upright more than I made field goals. It was kind of funny.\\u201d\", \"But, wow, could he punt. And to those who knew the family, it did not come as a surprise. His father, Mike, was a punter at Mississippi State from 1987 to 1991 and attended training camp with the Detroit Lions in 1992 and 1993.\", \"\\u201cI was in preseason camp, and both years I was there I made it to the very last cut,\\u201d Mike Riley said.\", \"Austin Riley estimated that he averaged 45 or so yards a punt in high school, and his father said the high end of his range was 75 to 80 yards. While Austin\\u2019s estimate may be generous (the MaxPreps website said he averaged 41.6 yards a punt), his father\\u2019s was spot on: His son\\u2019s longest punt was recorded as 77 yards.\", \"Father and son bonded over one of football\\u2019s more specialized skills.\", \"\\u201cWe lived on some acreage,\\u201d Austin Riley said. \\u201cWe had plenty of room, and there were afternoons we\\u2019d get back there and he could still spiral and turn a ball over. That\\u2019s kind of how I learned. It all started in the backyard kicking it, and I got pretty good at it.\\u201d\", \"Joining them in the yard was a cousin, Keegan James, who is now a relief pitcher in the Colorado Rockies\\u2019 organization.\", \"\\u201cAll he did was long snap,\\u201d Austin Riley said. \\u201cSo we\\u2019d come in, get our stuff on, do 30 minutes of practice and then bounce. \\u2018We\\u2019ve got to go to baseball practice.\\u2019 It was cool.\\u201d\", \"James ended up playing three years of baseball at Mississippi State. Riley committed to Mississippi State as well, with the Bulldogs offering to give him a chance to punt for the football team in addition to playing baseball. He signed with Atlanta instead, after being taken with the 41st pick in the 2015 draft.\", \"There were times when he wondered if he did the right thing. Riley struggled at the start of his professional baseball career. He reported to Atlanta\\u2019s affiliate in the Gulf Coast League, where, he said, \\u201cI think I went 0 for 21 with 14 strikeouts before I got my first hit.\\u201d\", \"His father remembered it as 0 for 24 with 17 strikeouts. Regardless, he was only 18 and it was every bit as rough as it sounds.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m a homebody,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe were doing all these workouts and I was like: \\u2018Man, I don\\u2019t even know if this is for me. Should I just go to Mississippi State and pursue professional baseball after that?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"He laughed as he remembered it: \\u201cI was getting tweeted at, \\u2018Austin\\u2019s going to be a pitcher by September.\\u2019 I was getting hammered. But once that first hit came, it was a domino effect.\\u201d\", \"He was called up by Atlanta in 2019, and initially played left field because the club wanted his bat in the lineup. In the pandemic-shortened 2020 season, he primarily played third base. While he flashed power as a rookie, with 18 homers in 80 games, he also hit just .226. In 2020, his homer output dropped to eight in 51 games and he hit .239. It wasn\\u2019t until this summer that Riley settled in as Atlanta\\u2019s cleanup hitter.\", \"\\u201cHe came up and had such a big splash and then kind of had to learn his way through the big leagues,\\u201d Atlanta shortstop Dansby Swanson said this month. \\u201cAnd then I feel like, in this day and age, as soon as we come up, we all have a comp, right? And we have a comp to someone of what our ceiling could be and what they were in their prime, and then when you\\u2019re not that immediately, it\\u2019s kind of like, OK, well, this person\\u2019s not any good. I feel like that happens so often in any sport nowadays.\\u201d\", \"During the N.L.C.S., Dodgers Manager Dave Roberts said Riley\\u2019s maturation was really noticeable.\", \"\\u201cYou see the confidence,\\u201d Roberts said. \\u201cJust at the plate, he\\u2019s handling velocity, spin. He can beat the shift, so he can control the barrel. He\\u2019s just a really good hitter. And defensively he\\u2019s gotten a couple of grades better, too.\\u201d\", \"Riley said he still talks with his mother and father at least twice a day. He married his high school girlfriend, Anna. Their support helped pull him through his rough early days in the Gulf Coast League, and now they sit in the stands at Truist Park listening to those \\u201cM.V.P.!\\u201d chants.\", \"It was just a few years ago that he was punting in the Mississippi-Alabama high school all-star game. Now he\\u2019s playing in the World Series.\", \"\\u201cThis has been unreal,\\u201d Riley said, mentioning the tough, losing seasons that Atlanta institutions such as Freddie Freeman and Manager Brian Snitker worked through before his arrival. \\u201cTo me, I feel like I\\u2019ve been spoiled because I\\u2019ve been in the league three years and I\\u2019m already in the World Series. A lot of people have been in the league a long time and have never been here.\\u201d\", \"There are times during the season when he will see the relievers tossing a football around in the outfield before batting practice and wonder whether he can still turn a high spiral over with a swift kick. \\u201cBut I resist it because it takes just one kick and something pulls if I\\u2019m not stretched right,\\u201d Riley said.\", \"What once was an agonizing decision to give up one sport has turned out well.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m a people pleaser, and I loved football,\\u201d Riley said. \\u201cFriday nights, that\\u2019s what I miss most about high school. You\\u2019ve got the pregame, your little downtime. But I loved baseball more.\\u201d\", \"He said telling the football coach he was going to pursue baseball and asking Anna\\u2019s father for his blessing to marry his daughter were the two times he had been most nervous.\", \"Now?\", \"\\u201cOh yeah,\\u201d Riley said. \\u201cI would certainly take the World Series in the misty rain to a Friday night high school football game. For sure.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"1b944fd83b5411eca7b5000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1b944fd83b5411eca7b5000017025a03"}},
