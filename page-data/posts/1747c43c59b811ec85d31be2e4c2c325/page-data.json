Americans began to reject the Federal style with its British influences and sought an American style with bona fide democratic roots.\\\"\", \"The Italianate style houses, popular from 1840 to 1885, wouldn't look out of place in a European village.\", \"AHS stated they evoked the feel of a \\\"medieval villa rustica in the Italian countryside,\\\" although they grew in popularity owing not to their design, but low building costs and durability.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949093/how-much-american-architecture-has-changed.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">How much American architecture has changed over the centuries.
