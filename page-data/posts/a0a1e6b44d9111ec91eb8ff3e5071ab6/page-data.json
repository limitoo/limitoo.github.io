TRCS appreciates all of the contributions of our staff and will continue to comply with its Board policies.\\u00a0 As we move forward, we are committed to providing a safe learning environment for all students and staff of TRCS.\\\"\", \"Three Rivers Community Schools alumnus Andrew George told CBS affiliate WWMT that he was concerned about what the decision to remove the flags would say to LGBTQ+ students.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I fear for the wellbeing of LGBTQ students,\\\" George told WWMT. \\\"It is of the utmost importance that we show them that they are accepted. This is how we prevent further depression and suicide rates among LGBTQ teens.\\\"\", \"Former teacher Russell Ball told WOOD-TV that teachers believe one or several parents complained about the flags being displayed in the classroom. Ball, a member of the LGBTQ+ community, resigned after being asked to remove a flag from his classroom.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"To me, the flag represents love and inclusion for everybody, not just whoever is of the LGBTQIA+ community,\\\" Ball told WOOD-TV. \\\"I felt very disheartened and saddened. The students losing that representation throughout the classrooms really hurt, losing my own representation in the classroom really hurt. It was just something I was not prepared to do.\\\"\", \"The next board meeting is set for December 6, where George has scheduled a \\\"100 Allies For Acceptance\\\" protest against the policy.\", \"\\\"The goal is to have 100 people show up and show that Three Rivers does support the LGBTQ community, and that love and sexual orientation is not political,\\\" Ball told WOOD-TV. \\\"It is an identity, just the way you're born.\\\"\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"a0a1e6b44d9111ec91eb8ff3e5071ab6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a0a1e6b44d9111ec91eb8ff3e5071ab6"}},
