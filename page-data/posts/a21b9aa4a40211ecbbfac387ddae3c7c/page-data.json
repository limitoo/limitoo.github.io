The family members had filed a lawsuit seeking to stop the release of any records from the local medical examiner's office and the Orange County Sheriff's Office involving the investigation into Saget's death.\", \"Saget, 65, was found dead January 9 in a room at the Ritz Carlton in Orlando. He had performed in the area the previous night as part of a stand-up tour.\", \"Saget died from an accidental blow to the head, likely from a fall backward, according to the medical examiner. An autopsy report showed that Saget had an abrasion on his scalp, a fracture at the base of his skull, fractures around his eye sockets, bruises to the brain, and bleeding between the brain and tissue covering the brain. A toxicology analysis didn't show any illicit drugs or toxins in Saget's body.\", \"During the course of the autopsy and death investigation, the medical examiner's office and sheriff's office created graphic videos and photos of Saget's body, as well as audio recordings. Such records are prohibited by state law from being released publicly, but some media outlets had already filed requests for them, according to the family's lawsuit.\"]","href_hash":"a21b9aa4a40211ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a21b9aa4a40211ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
