Masks must now be worn in all food and drink venues, close-proximity businesses, events and gatherings.\\u00a0The mask exception for eating, drinking and exercising still stands.\", \"Hipkins told Checkpoint the most important point was that they were encouraging people to wear proper masks that covered their mouth and nose, as opposed to people just pulling their T-shirts over their face.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The best masks for most people are going to be the medical mask that you can buy from the supermarket, you can buy them in packs of 50 from the supermarket, these are the ones we are recommending people use. You can still use a cloth covering, but there are some cloth coverings of course that are better than others.\", \"\\\"The paper face coverings are more effective than the fabric face coverings, there are some fabric face coverings that are very good, however, the ones that have several layers and then often have a filter, those are still good masks.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/137114/eight_col_177479192_l.jpg?1642986071\\\" alt=\\\"Disposable KN-95 mask vs thin surgical mask.

[and we know] with those medical masks, they're readily available from the supermarket and other places so people can actually use them.\\\"\", \"While he said there was enough N95 mask supply for frontline workers, \\\"if we were to extend that to the wider public, we do know that for example the supermarkets can source medical masks relatively easily, [but it] would be more difficult for them to be sourcing N95 masks.\", \"\\\"There are international supply constraints around that. And also if you are looking at the proportion of benefit to risk, the most important thing we can do at the moment is encourage people to wear masks properly, whatever type of masks they are wearing.\\\"\", \"Hipkins said he was also having discussions with the Ministry of Education around supply of masks in school settings.\", \"\\\"We're also making sure we're working with community organisations, food banks and others to make sure that masks are available to those who might not otherwise be able to access them.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"136a74c27dad11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"136a74c27dad11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
