Schulz\\u2019s newspaper strips and cartoons, and will be presented at Ala Moana Center, an open-air mall, starting in March.\", \"\\u201cThe beauty of \\u2018Peanuts\\u2019 is that there are 17,500-and-some-odd strips that Sparky \\u2014 Charles Schulz \\u2014 created over the 50 years of \\u2018Peanuts\\u2019 in syndication,\\u201d which provided many stories, themes and locations to mine, Craig Herman, a Peanuts Worldwide vice president, said in a conference call with the show\\u2019s producer.
