However, he doesn't wear a mask during weekly news conferences and he attended a Halloween party maskless with others. Both are violations of the NFL's protocols.\", \"Since contracting COVID-19, Rodgers has said that he has been taking the anti-malaria medication hydroxychloroquine and the anti-parasite medication ivermectin to treat his symptoms.
