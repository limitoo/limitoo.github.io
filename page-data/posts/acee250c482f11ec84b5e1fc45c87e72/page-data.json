During the reign of Louis XVI, the building was the royal repository for furniture, tapestries and even the crown jewels (which were stolen one September night in 1792).\", \"It occasionally was opened to the public to show off royal splendors, making it the French capital\\u2019s first museum, predating the Louvre by more than a decade. After the French Revolution, it became the official headquarters of the French Navy for 266 years. And this past summer it emerged from extensive renovations as a monument to the French art of living. Features include a richly embellished suite of 19th-century reception rooms and a loggia overlooking the plaza\\u2019s Luxor Obelisk and, inside the main courtyard, the Caf\\u00e9 Lap\\u00e9rouse and Mimosa, a restaurant run by the Michelin-starred chef Jean-Fran\\u00e7ois Pi\\u00e8ge.\", \"Now the H\\u00f4tel de la Marine is once again a showcase for princely treasures.\", \"\\u201cGiven my family\\u2019s affection for France and its cultural heritage, presenting the Al Thani Collection in the heart of Paris has a special meaning for me,\\u201d Sheikh Hamad bin Abdullah Al Thani wrote in an email. A member of Qatar\\u2019s ruling family, Sheikh Hamad, 40, is a first cousin of the emir of Qatar and a distant cousin of Sheikh Saud bin Mohammed Al Thani, another celebrated collector, who died in 2014.\", \"The 120 works in the new exhibition, called \\u201cTreasures of the Al Thani Collection,\\u201d span more than 5,000 years, from the simplicity of a gold pendant \\u2014 identified as one of the earliest known examples of goldsmithing, dating at least to 3,500 B.C. and possibly earlier \\u2014 to a large and ornate Mughal decorative bird in gold, lacquer, rubies and emeralds.\", \"In addition to jewelry in precious metals, gemstones and enamel work from the Mughal dynasty, rare pieces on display include the Mahin Banu \\u201cGrape\\u201d dish, a porcelain platter of royal provenance from China\\u2019s Ming era (1368 to 1644); a bear-shaped gilded bronze carpet weight dating to China\\u2019s Han dynasty (202 B.C. to A.D. 220); ornate sabers; Byzantine coins; textiles; and illuminated manuscripts of the Quran.\", \"The exhibition\\u2019s poster features a bust of Hadrian with a carved chalcedony head dating from the Roman emperor\\u2019s reign (117 to 138). Its beard was added during the 13th century era of Frederick II of the Holy Roman Empire, and a vermeil and enamel mantle was embellished in Venice during the Renaissance.\", \"A collector since the age of 18, Sheikh Hamad first introduced his assemblage of more than 6,000 objects with exhibitions that focused heavily on jeweled pieces. \\u201cTreasures from India,\\u201d which opened in 2014 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, was followed by \\u201cBejewelled Treasures\\u201d at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London and the \\u201cJoyaux\\u201d exhibition, sponsored by Cartier, at the Grand Palais in Paris in 2017.\", \"Yet in 2018, when the nonprofit Al Thani Collection Foundation signed an agreement with the Centre des Monuments Nationaux of France to occupy an upstairs gallery in the H\\u00f4tel de la Marine, its ambition was to show that the scope of the collection surpasses the jewels for which it has become famous. (Only 11 objects in the new exhibition were part of the earlier shows.)\", \"\\u201cThis exhibition reflects my interests in works of art made across civilizations, irrespective of geography or period, material or technique,\\u201d Sheikh Hamad wrote in his recent email. \\u201cAbove all, I appreciate human creativity and refinement more than any other attribute.\\u201d\", \"Tickets to visit the H\\u00f4tel de la Marine are sold in an inner courtyard with a jewel-inspired glass roof designed by the British architect Hugh Dutton. The entry price (13 or 17 euros) grants access to the Al Thani exhibition as well as the historic salons; reservations are recommended.\", \"Philippe Belaval, the president of the Centre des Monuments Nationaux, which oversees almost 100 state-owned monuments such as Notre Dame Cathedral and Mont-St.-Michel, said making the private collection accessible to the public would give the French cultural landscape an added sense of openness.\", \"\\u201cWhile the Al Thani collection fits with the image of a gallery of treasures, our main preoccupation was to show its richness and diversity, with a decorative element that differs from what you see in the rest of the building,\\u201d Mr. Belaval said. \\u201cSeeing rare things you couldn\\u2019t see anywhere else in the world is something that justifies a visit all on its own.\\u201d\", \"Paris is a prime location for the long-term exhibition. One of the most visited cities in the world, it attracted a record 38 million tourists in 2019 \\u2014 and 17.5 million in 2020, despite international travel restrictions and lockdowns.\", \"While the terms of the partnership between the foundation and the monuments administration remain confidential, an official statement mentioned an \\u201cextremely generous gift\\u201d \\u2014 reported in the French newspaper Le Monde as \\u20ac20 million ($23 million) \\u2014 made to the state in return for a 20-year concession at the H\\u00f4tel de la Marine. The foundation also paid to renovate its exhibition space, an amount that has not been disclosed, but French media reported it as a multimillion-euro expense. (Mr. Belaval described the rooms, once used for storing tapestries, as \\u201ccompletely bare\\u201d before work began.)\", \"Sheikh Hamad hired Tsuyoshi Tane of Atelier Tsuyoshi Tane Architects, based in Paris, to reconfigure the space into what the sheikh\\u2019s email described as a \\u201c21st century museum.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Tane\\u2019s designs, he wrote, \\u201chave an avant-garde modesty and minimalism that don\\u2019t distract from the pieces exhibited, while also giving an abstract inspiration of the history of the place.\\u201d\", \"The result is as striking as some of the objects displayed. Just inside the entrance, a selection of eight masterpieces that include depictions of deities or animals \\u2014 chosen to represent the sheikh\\u2019s taste \\u2014 are framed by thousands of gilded brass elements that, strung on nearly invisible wires, look like falling snowflakes. Mr. Tane said the effect was inspired by the gilded flourishes in 18th-century French d\\u00e9cor, but abstracted to create a bridge to works in the collection.\", \"Similarly, the flooring recreates the formal wood parquet found at Versailles, but was made of panels of dark stone.\", \"\\u201cIn a way, each element shows that we are looking at the past in an almost archaeological way, to take what was there, what is here and trying to push it into the future seamlessly,\\u201d Mr. Tane said.\", \"\\u201cThere is no one way to see the world,\\u201d he added. \\u201cI think that a 21st-century museum should let you discover your own journey, not limit how you discover things.\\u201d\", \"In an adjacent room, heads from different civilizations and periods \\u2014 a Mesopotamian king, a man from Egypt\\u2019s Ptolemaic period, an Amarna princess \\u2014 are protected in capsules made by the Italian company Goppion, which in 2019 updated its display case for the Mona Lisa.\", \"Having a home at the H\\u00f4tel de la Marine will make it possible to change displays and expand programming, said Amin Jaffer, senior curator of the Al Thani Collection.\", \"And while parts of the collection will continue to travel the world \\u2014 for example, to the State Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the Kunsthistorisches Museum in Vienna in fall 2022 \\u2014 Dr. Jaffer said he and his team would be exploring possibilities with other institutions, such as the Calouste Gulbenkian Museum in Lisbon.\", \"\\u201cSheikh Al Thani has said from the beginning that there\\u2019s no point in reproducing a museum experience that\\u2019s already been done,\\u201d Dr. Jaffer said. \\u201cHe has a definite vision, a sure taste and a love of certain art forms, but he also has universal interests.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve never heard him say he wasn\\u2019t interested in something.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"acee250c482f11ec84b5e1fc45c87e72"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"acee250c482f11ec84b5e1fc45c87e72"}},
