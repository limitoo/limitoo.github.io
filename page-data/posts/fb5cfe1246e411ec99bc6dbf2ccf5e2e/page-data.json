The national average price for a gallon of regular gasoline was $3.41 on Tuesday, according to the American Automobile Association (AAA).\", \"On November 10, the president said lowering consumer prices was his \\\"top priority.\\\" But experts say he has few options when it comes to curbing the price of gas.\", \"On Monday night, Noah said gas prices were \\\"all people care about.\\\"\", \"\\\"The big question is, what can be done to lower gas prices? Well, the bad news for President Biden is not much,\\\" Noah said.\", \"\\\"What's tough for Biden is that it doesn't matter what else he does. If the price of gas stays high, that's that. He could sign all the infrastructure bills he wants, he could get everyone to agree on abortion but all people care about is, how much is the black goo from the ground? Higher than before? Then get the f**k out of here.

They suggested the president consider releasing barrels from the emergency stockpile known as the Strategic Petroleum Reserve or take the more drastic step of banning crude oil exports.\", \"At a press briefing on Friday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that the Biden administration was \\\"looking at every tool in our arsenal\\\" on gas prices.\", \"\\\"The message to Americans is that we're not just closely and directly monitoring the situation\\u2014which, of course, we've been doing\\u2014but we're looking at every tool in our arsenal,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"We have taken a range of actions.
