Have we entered a new Cold War? Will it turn into outright conflict?\", \"The G2 matters. Whether it is climate change, international trade, or the future of world peace, the US and China are pivotal. The two superpowers have greater sway than the G8, the G20, AUKUS, the Quad, ASEAN, APEC or any other multilateral acronym we may think of.\", \"Not to ignore the importance of those bodies and alliances, nor diminish the power of individual states \\u2014 especially the likes of Russia, India, Japan, France, Germany, and the UK \\u2014 but we are all pulled along in the wake of Beijing and Washington.\", \"In recent years the geopolitical temperature has risen. Rhetoric is more heated; threat and counter-threat; military build-up \\u2014 and increasingly there is talk of war.\", \"How do we understand this age? For many, the answers lie in the deep past.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Looking backwards to go forwards</div>\", \"In Ancient Greece,\\u00a0the two great powers, Athens and Sparta, went to war \\u2014 why?\", \"The common belief is that Sparta feared Athens' rising\\u00a0power. Certainly, the Athenians had grown strong since the time when Athens and Sparta united to defeat the Persians.\", \"The Greek historian of the Peloponnesian War, Thucydides, popularised the idea of the shifting balance of power lighting the fuse for conflict. He gave us what has become known in international relations as the Thucydides Trap: when a rising power meets a waning power, war becomes inevitable.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/a6799333b144e55c824a93927b8e5202\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Ancient historian Thucydides popularised the idea of the shifting balance of power lighting the fuse for conflict.(Wikimedia:\\u00a0Alinari)</div>\", \"The Peloponnesian War echoes today. Harvard University historian, Graham Allison, has posed the question: can the US and China avoid the Thucydides Trap?\", \"Once again we are hearing warnings of the drumbeat of war, as rising China faces down waning America. China hawks in the US and Australia talking up conflict often drown out more cautious, nuanced voices.\", \"But power transition doesn't explain the complexities of this age any more than it did in Ancient Greece. Thucydides himself said it was unclear what were the immediate causes of the war between Sparta and Athens.\", \"Then, as now, it was about the economy and politics and as much about identity as power: who represented the soul and future of Greece?\", \"Sparta had self-interest too. It worried that the spread of Athenian style democracy would spark a slave revolt. There had already been some slave uprising.\", \"Some historians argue that if Sparta truly feared a more powerful Athens it would have invaded sooner. It was certainly strong enough. As political scientist Richard Lebow has said, Sparta believed \\\"it could overwhelm the Athenians in a single battle\\\".\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">A different perspective</div>\", \"As in Ancient Greece, simple answers today are misleading. This is more complicated than a contest for power. We are not destined for war. But it is possible we may talk ourselves into one.\", \"So how else can we see this moment beyond the prism of inevitable conflict? Does Ancient China offer us a different view of the world than Ancient Greece?\", \"Lebow has joined forces with Chinese International relations analyst\\u00a0Feng Zhang to find another way through this critical moment of history. In their book, Taming the Sino-American Rivalry, they look beyond big power rivalry.\", \"The West, they argue, is locked in a mindset of power transition; it has become \\\"the dominant frame of reference\\\".\\u00a0We hear it all the time, China has grown powerful and belligerent, it is threatening the global order.\", \"Just like Sparta and Athens, America and China are on a collision course.\", \"Lebow and Feng draw on Chinese thinkers who they say are \\\"unimpressed by Allison's thesis of the Thucydides Trap\\\".\\u00a0In China, they say the emphasis is less on power transition and more on political strategy.\", \"The authors talk about the Chinese concept of Wangdao \\u2014 not power, but influence. Wangdao is about \\\"humane authority\\\". Imperial China didn't seek to impose its vision on the world but demanded subservient nations paid tribute to Chinese power.\", \"Lebow and Feng say it worked to mutual advantage: \\\"The strong gained honour, while the weak gained protection and trade advantages.\\\"\", \"It gets close to another Chinese concept: Tianxia or \\\"all under heaven\\\". Political philosopher Zhao Tingyang has revisited this old idea to redefine political order today.\", \"Zhao says he takes no sides. Tianxia, he says, is based on a \\\"world order that is both of and for all the world's peoples\\\".\\u00a0He says we need to think less of individual states and more as one world.\", \"Hostile strategies, he says, of \\\"deterrence, sanction, interference, the balancing of powers, cold wars and even war itself \\u2026 make the world worse off than it was\\\". Tianxia, he says, turns a world of hostility into hospitality.\", \"There is no foreigner. There is no enemy. It eschews competition \\u2014 which leads to disorder \\u2014 for coexistence. It is a concept not far removed from Enlightenment thinker\\u00a0Immanuel Kant's notion of \\\"perpetual peace\\\" built on a shared humanity, a cosmopolitan order.\", \"Zhao says it is an ancient Chinese order that puts the 'we'\\u00a0above the 'I'. It is, he says, why ancient China \\\"never produced political liberalism and individual rights as political issues\\\".\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">No easy answers</div>\", \"This talk of Wangdao and Tianxia can sound hopelessly romantic, even deluded, at a time when Xi Jinping warns of war against Taiwan and escalates military exercises, all the while increasing his country's firepower and nuclear arsenal.\", \"Where is a peaceful world under heaven in threatening and intimidating countries and entities that challenge or push back against Chinese malign interference or influence? Where is humane authority in locking up Uyghur Muslims and crushing democracy protests in Hong Kong?\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/73d588f72cfbbddcb2c9cc40dec52767\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Xi has repeatedly warned that China is rising, while the West is declining.(Reuters: Thomas Peter/File photo)</div>\", \"Indeed, Xi has contributed as much as anyone to the threat of the Thucydides Trap when he warns the China is rising, and the West is declining.\", \"And yet officially at least, Chinese policy is deeply influenced by coexistence and seeking influence but not power. China's Defence White Paper in 2019\\u00a0restated a commitment to \\\"peaceful development\\\". China's development, it said, \\\"is an opportunity for the world\\\".\", \"The White Paper said China \\\"will never follow the beaten track of big powers in seeking hegemony.\\\" Xi himself has talked about \\\"a new type of great power relations\\\". He has called himself a champion of globalisation and outlined a \\\"win-win\\\" model of cooperation between China and America.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Who should we listen to?</div>\", \"This week Xi and Joe Biden spoke of the need to avoid conflict and talked down a new Cold War. China and the US are cooperating on climate change and some have seen that as a window for an even greater rapprochement.\", \"Political scientist Zhiqun Xu\\u00a0captures the complexity of Chinese strategy when he says China seeks to \\\"fight but not break\\\" the world order. It wants recognition not revolution. He warns we \\\"should not see US-China competition as a zero-sum game\\\".\\u00a0\", \"Yun Jiang, a China scholar from the Australian National University,\\u00a0recently bemoaned the lack of diversity of opinion on China on\\u00a0ABC's Q+A.

We don't hear from them enough.\", \"But of course,\\u00a0we are all captured by our own biases and our own histories.\", \"It is worth recalling the worlds of Thucydides from his own time of great power war: \\\"Most people, in fact, will not take the trouble in finding out the truth, but are much more inclined to accept the first story they hear.\\\"\", \"Stan Grant presents China Tonight on Monday at 9.35pm on ABC TV, and Tuesday at 8pm on\\u00a0 ABC News Channel.\"]","href_hash":"233c6e9a4a3211ec928453f3f2fc5ace"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"233c6e9a4a3211ec928453f3f2fc5ace"}},
