She added that it was \\u201cquite well made.\\u201d His goal, she said, was to obtain a vaccination certificate, enabling him to go to work without actually getting the shot.\", \"The stratagem was the latest and perhaps most original episode of vaccine evasion in the struggle between Italy\\u2019s government and the country\\u2019s anti-vaccine faction. Italy appears to have fewer vaccine skeptics than other European countries do, but, apparently, some in that camp are very determined.\", \"About 13 percent of Italy\\u2019s adult population have not had a single shot, and cases have been rising since mid-October.\", \"The country has adopted several measures to push skeptics to get a vaccine. It became the first in Europe to mandate vaccinations for health care workers, then broadly required people to obtain a health certificate, or Green Pass, to participate in many social activities and to go to work.\", \"Last week, Italy announced that people would need proof of vaccination to sit inside bars and restaurants, and required the same proof from all hospital staff, teachers and law enforcement officers.\", \"But those fighting vaccination became more creative. Reports emerged about a trade in fake health passes on Telegram groups and of anti-vaccinations doctors who injected their patients with saline instead of vaccine in order for them to get a certificate.\", \"The attempt to get vaccinated in a fake arm, however, is perhaps the most audacious scheme to have emerged.\", \"Ms. Bua said that following the extension of the vaccination requirements, more patients have shown up for their first shots, albeit mostly dragging their feet. Some urged her to inject them quickly, some cried and some cursed the government or their children for forcing them to the vaccination line.\", \"The foam-armed man, on the contrary, was pleasant and serene, she said, though her own reaction was anything but.\", \"\\u201cIt was so humiliating,\\u201d Ms. Bua said, \\u201cthinking that a nurse cannot tell the difference between rubber foam and skin.\\u201d\", \"The health authorities reported the episode to the police. Alberto Cirio, the president of the Piedmont region where Biella is located, said that the episode was \\u201cof enormous gravity, unacceptable given the sacrifice our community is enduring because of the pandemic.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8c99e2ec547711ec8059f7d26a552daa"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8c99e2ec547711ec8059f7d26a552daa"}},
