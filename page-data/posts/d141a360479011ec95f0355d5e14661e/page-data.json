Then they transferred the money to a trust account that they controlled.\", \"Within days, the sons \\u2014 who came from Marvin\\u2019s second marriage \\u2014 helped him change his will to make them the only beneficiaries. Two months later, twin sisters from Marvin\\u2019s wife\\u2019s family, his grandnieces-in-law, petitioned the court to declare him legally incapacitated, and to appoint a guardian to manage both his person and his finances. And, they argued, they were the right people for the job. They were 23.\", \"Here is where things become more contentious.\", \"On a recent afternoon, Todd Stein, 56, the younger of Marvin\\u2019s two sons, showed a photograph of his father, taken shortly after that Thanksgiving, that he said revealed Marvin\\u2019s condition at the time. Shot from behind, Marvin, then 88, appears shirtless, his skin mottled and loose on his frame.\", \"Is this just the body of a man in late life? Or is it, as his son maintains, evidence of potentially life-threatening neglect that Marvin, a lifelong fitness buff, had suffered at the hands of his wife\\u2019s younger relatives?\", \"Had Todd and his brother saved their father? Or had they, as the twins claimed in court papers, taken advantage of his frail state to kidnap him and siphon off his life savings?\", \"In the months after the bank tour, police officers, a judge, a court evaluator, a dozen or so lawyers and two very assertive families would all throw themselves at these questions, setting the trajectory of Marvin Stein\\u2019s late years and consuming hundreds of thousands of dollars.\", \"Now Todd Stein, who runs a management company for actors, is trying to make a documentary series about the battle between the two families.\", \"He proposed calling the series, \\u201cFight of His Life: The Marvin Stein Story.\\u201d The production company that bought the rights preferred something juicier: \\u201cA Mafia Marriage.\\u201d\", \"Marvin Stein, who was born in 1930, grew up poor in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, where he said he was the only Jewish kid boxing at the Flatbush Boys Club. His father was an alcoholic who left the family before Marvin was 10. Marvin was small but tough, fighting his way to Golden Gloves lightweight championship titles in 1946 and 1947. Boxing brought his first contact with organized crime figures.\", \"\\u201cThese underworld characters, they wanted to take advantage of me, so they drove me to Philadelphia, and I fought in Philadelphia, and they drove me back home again,\\u201d Marvin, 91, said in late September, in the Upper East Side apartment where he lives with Todd and Todd\\u2019s mother. His managers had chosen Philadelphia because the betting was \\u201cvery loosey-loosey,\\u201d Marvin said. His voice was soft but even in his clipped phrasing, the grit of the episode seemed still fresh. \\u201cReal characters,\\u201d he said.\", \"It was not his last encounter with gangsters.\", \"\\u201cNo,\\u201d Marvin said.\", \"Marvin sat low in a wheelchair at one end of a table piled with shrimp, grapes and other noshes. Felicia Stein \\u2014 Todd\\u2019s mother \\u2014 sat in a wheelchair in a leopard-print blouse at the other end.\", \"Marvin and Felicia, who divorced in 1986, sleep in separate bedrooms, each with a second bed for a home attendant. Todd, who had moved back to New York from Los Angeles to help care for his mother, created a third bedroom for himself from a section of the living room.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s been wonderful, helping us,\\u201d Felicia said.\", \"\\u201cWhat do I do for you?\\u201d Todd asked.\", \"\\u201cYou put up with me.\\u201d\", \"The conversation, like others over a span of several weeks, moved like a river, winding here and there, occasionally stagnating in eddies. A few years ago, Marvin had two transient ischemic attacks \\u2014 like very brief strokes \\u2014 and he now has memory lapses that disrupt his narrative flow.\", \"Todd addressed him deliberately, enunciating each word: \\u201cDo you remember the guardianship case?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI know you were involved in that,\\u201d Marvin said.\", \"To steer Marvin\\u2019s memory, Todd brought out a thick album of family photos. In the early pictures, Marvin appears as a handsome, athletic man, prosperous through middle age. But later pictures, taken when he was in his 80s, show an emaciated figure living in a Brooklyn basement.\", \"No court ever found that Marvin had been abused or neglected. But as he looked at the images, he tried to make sense of the change.\", \"\\u201cAs I look back, yes, I was taken advantage of,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAt the time, I wasn\\u2019t aware of being exploited. I guess I was a sucker.\\u201d\", \"Some memories were beyond recall, even with the photos. After high school, Marvin spent a year in a psychiatric institution to avoid prison. He could not remember why.\", \"Todd asked his father, \\u201cHow\\u2019s your memory today?\\u201d\", \"Marvin thought about it. \\u201cI look back, it\\u2019s a movie,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m very fortunate I\\u2019m hooked up with Todd and this apartment. When I leave here, where am I going?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cTo heaven, I hope,\\u201d Todd said.\", \"\\u201cYeah.\\u201d\", \"In Todd\\u2019s mind \\u2014 or in his patter \\u2014 the documentary series is a sure smash. A production company, Fremantle, the makers of \\u201cAmerican Idol\\u201d and \\u201cAmerica\\u2019s Got Talent,\\u201d bought the rights. The powerful Creative Artists Agency was already pitching it to streaming services like Netflix and Peacock. Probably there would be a bidding war for the rights, Todd said. The pitch included a \\u201csizzle reel\\u201d showing stacks of money and dramatized scenes of elder abuse. It had a story with real-life gangsters and celebrities, a health club \\u2014 owned by Marvin \\u2014 with a vault where members checked their guns and a \\u201csleep room\\u201d where closeted gay men met. And it had a guardianship battle \\u2014 just like Britney Spears, almost.\", \"\\u201cYou couldn\\u2019t write this stuff,\\u201d Todd said.\", \"Boxing never developed into a professional career for Marvin, but it began his affinity for the gym. He married and became a father just out of high school, working in a fruit store for his first wife\\u2019s father. Customers included Barbra Streisand\\u2019s mother, who liked to haggle, Marvin said. \\u201cShe was a cheapskate,\\u201d he recalled.\", \"Memory is a strange and wondrous thing.\", \"Marvin rode the fitness wave of the 1960s and 1970s. After divorcing his first wife, he married his second, Felicia Ann Selvi, a former dressmaker\\u2019s model, in 1961. He managed the health club at the Shelton Towers hotel in Midtown Manhattan, where celebrities like Ms. Streisand and Burt Reynolds were V.I.P.s, and George Hamilton tanned on the sun deck. Marvin started his own Shelton clubs in Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens. He bought property in Amagansett, in the Hamptons \\u2014 $27,000 in 1969 \\u2014 and built a house.\", \"The club in Brooklyn became a hangout for wiseguys and judges from the nearby courthouse. \\u201cThey would meet in the steam room and have contacts because it couldn\\u2019t be taped,\\u201d Marvin said.\", \"Todd, who was born in 1965, attended Manhattan private schools, including the elite Professional Children\\u2019s School for young working performers. Schoolmates included Sarah Jessica Parker, Christian Slater and Phoebe Cates. At 13, he started to land roles in commercials, soap operas and Off Broadway plays.\", \"Marvin lavished his children with money, especially after he and Felicia separated, when Todd was 16. It was how Marvin showed love, Todd said. They\\u2019d go shopping at Barney\\u2019s, and Todd could pick out whatever he wanted. But Marvin also warned his son, \\u201cDon\\u2019t let people know what you have.\\u201d That was the old Brooklyn talking.\", \"Todd, who also goes by T.J., moved to California after college, eventually starting a management company for young actors, which was written up in The Los Angeles Times in 2000. In court papers, Marvin\\u2019s future guardians said that Todd and his father had little contact after Todd moved west, except when Todd wanted money, which Marvin resented. Todd and Marvin denied this. But when Marvin married a woman he met at the Brooklyn exercise club in 1991, he did not tell his children or invite them to the wedding.\", \"The woman was Anita Montemarano, who worked for New York City in social services. She was also, the Steins learned, the sister of a high-ranking mafia captain.\", \"Marvin\\u2019s new wife was the older sister of Dominic Montemarano, who was known as Donny Shacks and at the time of the wedding was serving what would be a decade in prison for racketeering and extortion. The federal indictment described him as a capo, or captain, in the Colombo crime family.\", \"Mr. Montemarano, whose record also included arrests for assault, bribery, loan sharking, illegal gun possession and bookmaking, had a yen for the Hollywood life. When he got out of prison in 1997, he moved to California and started hanging out with celebrities like Pamela Anderson and Elizabeth Hurley, as well as Steve Bing, a mercurial movie producer who leapt to his death from his high-rise apartment in Century City in July 2020.\", \"Mr. Montemarano also tried acting, starring as an aging criminal in the 2002 bomb \\u201cNight at the Golden Eagle,\\u201d produced by Mr. Bing, which took in less than $18,000 at the box office. Reviewing the movie in The Times, A.O. Scott wrote, approvingly, that \\u201cthe smell of sweat, urine and cheap liquor seems to emanate from the screen.\\u201d\", \"Marvin Stein said he had few dealings with his brother-in-law, by choice. \\u201cHe used to come to my house to meet with my wife, and there was money going back and forth,\\u201d Marvin said, declining to elaborate. \\u201cI sort of excused myself and got busy with something. I didn\\u2019t want any part of it, because sooner or later it was going to catch up with me.\\u201d\", \"Relations between the in-laws were fraught. Members of Ms. Montemarano\\u2019s family and their lawyer declined to be interviewed for this article, but in 2013, Anita Montemarano wrote a scathing two-page letter to Todd and his brother and their stepsister from Marvin\\u2019s first marriage, a champion powerlifter living in Brooklyn. In it, Anita called them \\u201ca self-centered, self-absorbed, ungrateful group of adults\\u201d who enjoyed \\u201cfree rides financially and emotionally\\u201d from their father.\", \"In court documents, Anita\\u2019s niece Donna claimed that Marvin\\u2019s sons ignored him for long stretches, \\u201cemerging only to make financial demands of their father and his wife.\\u201d\", \"Todd and Marvin say it was Anita who tried to keep them apart.\", \"\\u201cAnita would make sarcastic remarks: Is that Todd calling again?\\u201d Marvin said.\", \"When Anita got a diagnosis of kidney cancer in late 2016, the conflicts between the two families \\u2014 over money, over control \\u2014 escalated. Despite the tension, Marvin said he had loved Anita, and that she had been very brave during her decline.\", \"Just before Thanksgiving 2018, Todd was on a business trip to Chicago when he called his father. He thought Marvin did not sound right. He flew to New York, he said, and found his father living in the basement of his home in the Dyker Heights section of Brooklyn, unwashed and in poor condition.\", \"At this point, Anita was in the terminal stages of cancer, with a hospice nurse visiting three times a week and her niece and twin grandnieces caring for her and Marvin. The twins called Todd\\u2019s arrival that Thanksgiving \\u201ca rare appearance at a family gathering.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMy dad was just skin and bones,\\u201d Todd said. \\u201cHe was in delirium. He had had too many strokes. He had been moving six figures out of his bank accounts over the past 20 months. He was not eating, he was not drinking or taking his proper medicine.\\u201d\", \"In their petition to be appointed Marvin\\u2019s guardians, the grandnieces described him as incapacitated, having dementia and unable to maintain a conversation or remember information told to him.\", \"Marvin said it had been his choice to live in the basement. He had a television and exercise equipment there, and a futon frame piled with mattresses. But when Todd showed him the photo of himself taken shortly afterward, shirtless, Marvin was distressed to see how thin he was. \\u201cWhen I look at it, it indicates that I wasn\\u2019t getting food,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbecause my bones are showing.\\u201d\", \"There were also financial questions. Four months earlier, in July 2018, with cancer ravaging Anita\\u2019s body, someone had helped Marvin change his will to leave the Dyker Heights house, worth more than $1.2 million, entirely to the grandnieces, rather than to be shared among the two families, as it had been before. Other accounts were also changed to favor Anita\\u2019s family, including the beneficiaries of Anita\\u2019s will and $368,000 in life insurance policies, Todd said.\", \"That Friday, a few days after Todd\\u2019s initial visit, Todd and his older brother, Ralph, who lived in New York City, showed up at the Dyker Heights house and announced they were taking their father to lunch. Instead, they began the tour of Marvin\\u2019s banks to remove his assets.\", \"Police officers, notified by Anita\\u2019s family, sent Todd text messages telling him to bring Marvin to a police precinct. They reported to a precinct in Manhattan, then to one in Brooklyn, and then to a hospital, because Marvin\\u2019s blood pressure was \\u201coff the charts,\\u201d Todd said. Finally, sometime around 2 a.m. and without warning his mother, Todd took his father to the apartment he was sharing with Felicia, in the Upper East Side building where Todd grew up.\", \"It was the first time Marvin and Felicia had seen each other in at least a decade.\", \"Todd said he was only protecting his father\\u2019s assets. In their guardianship petition, the grandnieces accused Todd and his brother of \\u201cexercising undue influence and duress\\u201d over Marvin to get hold of his money, saying he \\u201ccannot maintain a conversation of any length because he cannot remember the information shared with him and consequently loses the thread of the discussion.\\u201d\", \"Marvin saw Anita only once more, when he returned to the house a few days after Thanksgiving to get his medications. In a very short video recorded on Todd\\u2019s cellphone, Marvin stands over her bed, apparently having told her he was leaving. \\u201cIf you think I\\u2019m going to beg you,\\u201d she can be heard saying, \\u201cI\\u2019m not.\\u201d\", \"With so much acrimony, both families got protective orders against one another.\", \"When Anita died, on Dec. 10, 2018, her family did not notify Todd and Marvin. The brothers went to the Dyker Heights house around Christmas and found it had been largely cleared out. This was how they learned of her death.\", \"About a month after that, in late January 2019, the grandnieces petitioned to have Marvin declared incapacitated, and to be appointed guardians of his person and property. They tallied his known assets at close to $2 million, in addition to the house.\", \"Without meeting with Marvin, a judge in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn granted their petition.\", \"Todd hired a team of lawyers for himself and for his father, and petitioned the court to release Marvin from guardianship, or appoint Todd as the guardian instead of the twins.\", \"The legal fees began to mount, at up to $650 per hour. The court replaced the twins with an experienced, temporary guardian, but gave him authority only over Marvin\\u2019s property, not his person. The guardian\\u2019s fee, too, was billed to Marvin.\", \"Living with Todd and Felicia, Marvin regained weight; his therapist and doctor submitted letters attesting that he was lucid and able to care for himself, with help.\", \"But Marvin was still not in charge of his finances. If he needed money for a shave, he said, he had to ask the guardian. And the legal bills were adding up: $100,000, then $200,000 and rising \\u2014 some of it a result of Todd\\u2019s constant emails to the various lawyers.\", \"The two families fought over everything. Todd demanded that Anita\\u2019s family remove her cremated remains from a niche at Green-Wood Cemetery that Marvin had bought. That battle went on for months before the remains were moved.\", \"Finally, in June 2019, the two families agreed to a settlement, and together asked the court to end the guardianship. Marvin regained control of his life.\", \"On a recent afternoon in the Steins\\u2019 apartment, Todd estimated that the cost of getting his father out of guardianship ran to about $300,000. He did not know how much the process cost Anita\\u2019s family.\", \"Marvin and Felicia sat facing each other across a table. Felicia, who is now 87, wore a sash from a beauty contest she won in her youth.\", \"Living together has been an adjustment for the three of them. Todd has just started dating after the breakup of a long-term relationship and surgery from a severe bicycle accident \\u2014 all while running his business and caring for two very old parents.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a 24-hour job,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI plan the meals, take care of the medicines. It\\u2019s a lot.\\u201d\", \"And there is the recognition that his parents, who are working out a new relationship after a long and acrimonious time apart, are getting frailer.\", \"As he prepared to pitch the documentary series, Todd said, he worried that people might accuse him of exploiting his father.\", \"\\u201cWould it look badly that I\\u2019m involved in a documentary that\\u2019s watching his decline?\\u201d Todd said. \\u201cBecause it is something that could be judged.\\u201d\", \"Felicia said that when Todd first brought Marvin to her apartment, she was \\u201capprehensive.\\u201d But a kind of rhythm had emerged. \\u201cI\\u2019m used to him,\\u201d she said. Still, she added, all the talk of gangsters and police made her feel uneasy \\u2014 though in the end, there is little evidence that criminal elements played a role other than as mood music for the documentary.\", \"Todd asked his father whether he liked living with Felicia.\", \"Marvin gave it some thought. \\u201cDoesn\\u2019t harm me in any way,\\u201d he said.\", \"Todd pressed: \\u201cIt\\u2019s nice to have someone you can talk to?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYes,\\u201d Marvin said.\", \"Their challenge now is to imagine their remaining lives together. Marvin and Felicia exercise in the gym downstairs; Todd takes them for meals at the corner restaurant. The couple\\u2019s combined incomes cover their living expenses.\", \"\\u201cLuckily, my father is considered a success story,\\u201d Todd said, acknowledging that many people never get out of guardianship. \\u201cHe lived. Imagine if they didn\\u2019t have the money to fight it.\\u201d\", \"He paused and then corrected himself. \\u201cIf they didn\\u2019t have money,\\u201d he said, \\u201cthis never would have happened.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"d141a360479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d141a360479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}},
