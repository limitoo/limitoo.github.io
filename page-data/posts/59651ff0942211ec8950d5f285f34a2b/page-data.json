But the Geo40 programme involves recovering the mineral from mineral-rich brine leftover from geothermal energy production, and returning the water to the geothermal field.\", \"By 2030 more than half of new car sales in the Northern Hemisphere were expected to be electric vehicles, he said.\", \"\\\"This is a game-changing programme of work. If we can successfully build up Geo40's green technology to commercial scale, New Zealand could become an international leader in technology for the sustainable supply of lithium, and help to build lasting action on climate change.\", \"\\\"It could also help meet New Zealand's 2050 carbon neutral target and create jobs to support the economic recovery.
