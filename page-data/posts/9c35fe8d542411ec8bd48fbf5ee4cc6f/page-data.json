Ms. Abrams said the decision left her \\u201cheartbroken\\u201d and that, aside from him sending her a few Instagram posts, there \\u201cwasn\\u2019t much communication\\u201d after the split.\", \"Then, in 2018, she saw a sign that sparked them to reconnect.\", \"That fall, Ms. Abrams, 32, noticed that the letter board sign outside of El Arroyo, a restaurant in Austin known for featuring witty phrases on its sign, read \\u201cI hope my ex\\u2019s dog is doing well.\\u201d She took a photograph and posted it on Instagram.\", \"Mr. Moss, 35, saw it and sent her a direct message on the app in response. It read, \\u201cHe\\u2019s doing great. But, how are you?\\u201d The message, he added, \\u201cwas enough for us to reopen a dialogue and once we started talking again, we quickly realized there was still a deep connection between us.\\u201d\", \"They then began a year of long-distance dating, which culminated with Ms. Abrams moving to Memphis in November 2019. She arrived to find that Mr. Moss had created his own sign, in the style of El Arroyo, and put it in his front yard. \\u201cThanks, El Arroyo. She posted your sign and it led her to mine.
