It just added two new shows with fan-favorite veteran couples, and let's just say many fans are thrilled. Both Loren and Alexei Brovarnik and David Toborowsky and Annie Suwan Toborowsky will be getting their own couple series. Fans were recently treated to trailers for each show, and the situation is viral among fans.\", \"Loren and Alexei's special called Loren & Alexei: After the 90 Days, will premiere on January 10 at 9:30 p.m. EST on TLC. David and Annie's show is called David & Annie: After the 90 Days, and it premieres just before Loren and Alexei's special at 9 p.m. EST.\", \"Loren and Alexei, who were first introduced to fans in season 3 of 90 Day Fianc\\u00e9, have been the favorites of viewers ever since. Their little family, which now includes 1-year-old Shai Josef and his brother Asher Noah, who was born on August 16 this year, have all become household names.\", \"In the new series, fans will watch as a very pregnant Loren and her husband prepare for Asher's arrival. The trailer shares a glimpse of what's to come from Alexei in Israel to family drama. The idea of moving is even going to come up from their home in South Florida. The stress will be palpable, especially when the news is revealed that the new baby will be premature and have to spend time in the hospital.\", \"The trailer was released on the 90 Day Fianc\\u00e9 Instagram page and has garnered over 110,000 views and many fans are \\\"excited\\\" and \\\"can't wait\\\" to see the spinoff of their favorite 90 Day family.
