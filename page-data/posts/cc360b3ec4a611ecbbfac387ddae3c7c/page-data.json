The tanker carrying a cargo of more than 105,000 tons of fuel had left St. Petersburg.\", \"Esso spokeswoman Anne Fougner told Norwegian newspaper Dagbladet that the oil had been purchased before Russia invaded Ukraine. She added that Esso Norway \\\"does not have other contracts for the purchase of products from Russia.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Oil is not only at the root of the climate crisis, but also of wars and conflicts.
