In the video, Lauren Rowe \\u2014 their child's nanny \\u2014 can be seen using physical force on the toddler in an attempt to force-feed him.\", \"As Declan screams for his parents, Rowe pins his arms behind his back and forces a spoonful of food into his mouth. She then covers his mouth with her hand, forcing him to swallow his food.\", \"When Declan finally manages to stand up in his high chair, he reaches for Rowe. But she forces his arms back down and eventually pushes Declan back down into his seat.\", \"Declan continues to cry as Rowe stands over him, yelling at him to \\\"take a bite\\\" of his food.\", \"When the Oglesbys saw what was happening, they rushed home, said WITN. They also contacted Max's mother \\u2014 Declan's grandmother \\u2014 to relieve the nanny and watch their children until they arrived.\", \"According to the New York Post, Laura Oglesby sent Rowe a clip of the footage along with a message that read: \\\"You are no longer needed to nanny for us, and my suggestion is that you don't nanny at all until you learn how to patiently handle children.\\\"\", \"\\\"You broke a mother's heart tonight,\\\" the message continued.\", \"They also took the video to New Bern police, who arrested Rowe and charged her with misdemeanor child abuse, The Post continued.
