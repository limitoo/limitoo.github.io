Roy Cooper of North Carolina on Friday granted a pardon to a man who spent more than 24 years in prison for murder before a judge vacated his conviction in 2019, finding that a key witness had \\u201centirely made up\\u201d her testimony.\", \"The pardon for the man, Montoyae Dontae Sharpe, clears the way for him to seek compensation from the state and comes after prominent pastors and others had demonstrated outside the governor\\u2019s mansion in support of Mr. Sharpe.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s been a long time coming,\\u201d Mr. Sharpe, 46, of Charlotte, said in an interview on Friday. \\u201cMy name has been cleared, and me and my family can move on. And I can go on with the next stage of my life, which is to still help other guys behind me.\\u201d\", \"In 1995, Mr. Sharpe was convicted and sentenced to life in prison for the murder of George Radcliffe, who was found fatally shot in his pickup truck in Greenville, N.C., on Feb. 11, 1994.\", \"During the trial, Charlene Johnson, who was 15, testified that she saw Mr. Sharpe, who is Black, shoot Mr. Radcliffe, who was white, in a face-to-face altercation over a drug deal, according to one of Mr. Sharpe\\u2019s lawyers, Theresa A. Newman, who was a co-director of the Wrongful Convictions Clinic at Duke University School of Law.\", \"Ms. Johnson testified that Mr. Sharpe and another man then put Mr. Radcliffe into the truck, crashed it into a vacant lot and threw away the key, Ms. Newman said.\", \"Ms. Johnson recanted her testimony weeks later, and Mr. Sharpe\\u2019s efforts to overturn his conviction worked their way through the courts until 2019, when a Superior Court judge in Pitt County, N.C., held two evidentiary hearings that destroyed the case.\", \"After the second hearing, on Aug. 22, 2019, the judge, G.
