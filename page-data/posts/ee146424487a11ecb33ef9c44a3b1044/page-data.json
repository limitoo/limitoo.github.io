Division I women\\u2019s basketball tournament will expand its field to 68 teams beginning this season, the association announced on Wednesday, about three months after investigators concluded that college sports executives had long prioritized the men\\u2019s competition.\", \"The decision represents the association\\u2019s latest effort to atone for \\u2014 and move beyond \\u2014 a self-inflicted debacle this year, when the N.C.A.A. faced condemnation for disparities in amenities between its Division I men\\u2019s and women\\u2019s basketball tournaments.\", \"Although the N.C.A.A. had agreed to make some changes in recent months, such as using its March Madness branding for the women\\u2019s tournament, the expansion of the women\\u2019s tournament will directly affect the course of competition and the experiences of players and coaches.\", \"The women\\u2019s tournament had used a 64-team bracket since 1994; the men\\u2019s tournament expanded to 68 teams in 2011.\", \"\\u201cThis action corrects an inequity that has existed between the men\\u2019s and women\\u2019s championships for a decade and provides equitable postseason participation opportunities for Division I men\\u2019s and women\\u2019s basketball student-athletes,\\u201d Danielle Donehew, the executive director of the Women\\u2019s Basketball Coaches Association, said in a statement released by the N.C.A.A. \\u201cWe are making progress in our efforts to address gender inequities in our sport, but much remains to be done.\\u201d\", \"The N.C.A.A. said that it would hold the new opening-round games in the women\\u2019s tournament on college campuses in 2022 but that it would move them to a neutral site starting in 2023, much as the men\\u2019s tournament\\u2019s \\u201cFirst Four\\u201d showdowns have been played in Dayton, Ohio. The women\\u2019s opening-round games will feature teams seeded 65th through 68th and the last four at-large teams.\", \"In a report in August, an outside law firm hired by the N.C.A.A. partly attributed the lack of expansion in the women\\u2019s tournament to the association\\u2019s organizational structure. But it also said that the growth of the men\\u2019s tournament had been partly intended \\u201cto maximize the value of the men\\u2019s broadcasting rights,\\u201d dollars that are the association\\u2019s financial lifeblood.\", \"The television rights for the men\\u2019s tournament were worth more than $850 million this year and accounted for the vast majority of the association\\u2019s anticipated revenue. Although media consultants believe the women\\u2019s tournament could fetch more than $100 million annually in the coming years, the competition is currently part of a $500 million, 14-year package that includes many other N.C.A.A. events.\", \"There had also been, the report noted, \\u201cno historical consensus\\u201d about whether expansion would benefit the women\\u2019s game, largely because of the longtime lack of parity. But the report urged the association to enlarge the tournament swiftly and said that investigators believed most people around the sport had come to support a bigger competition.\", \"\\u201cIn light of the approximately equal number of men\\u2019s and women\\u2019s basketball teams in Division I, there is no justification for the disparity in tournament participation opportunities,\\u201d the report said.\", \"The 2022 women\\u2019s tournament is scheduled to begin on March 16, three days after the selection show.
