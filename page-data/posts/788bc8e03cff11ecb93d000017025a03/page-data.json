While New Jersey voters donated thousands to Durr over the course of his low-key campaign, the candidate said that he spent only spent $153 to secure the GOP nomination during the primary, including $66 on donuts and drinks.\", \"While Democrats across the country suffered major losses during the off-year election, few were as improbable as Sweeney's likely defeat. Most political observers expected the long-serving Sweeney to easily win re-election and possibly run for governor in 2025. Durr, 58, had never held office and did not appear to believe that his victory was likely before the votes were counted.\", \"\\\"I joked with people and I said, 'I'm going to shock the world, I'm going to beat this man,'\\\" Durr told NJ.com on Wednesday afternoon. \\\"I was saying it, but really kind of joking. Because what chance did a person like me really stand against this man?

Because who in their right mind would take on a person with that kind of power and clout?\\\" he added. \\\"But his power, his clout, did not scare me.\\\"\", \"Despite his solid lead, Durr has not yet declared victory. Sweeney has also not conceded defeat, reportedly postponing a New Jersey Senate leadership caucus meeting that had been set for Thursday \\\"due to the closeness of several State Senate elections.\\\"\", \"Durr previously ran a failed campaign for a New Jersey General Assembly seat in 2019, finishing in last place in a four-candidate race. During an August YouTube interview with conservative commentator Elizabeth Nader, Durr said that his decision to run against Sweeney was motivated by anger over being denied a concealed carry gun permit.\", \"\\\"I guess what motivated me more than anything was I went for my concealed carry,\\\" Durr said. \\\"And I was told flat-out by the local sheriff, 'don't even bother.' And that kind of angered me...I've never been arrested and I couldn't get a concealed carry?\\\"\", \"\\\"That really angered me, so I looked into what can you do to get into politics,\\\" he added. \\\"I still don't consider myself a politician.
