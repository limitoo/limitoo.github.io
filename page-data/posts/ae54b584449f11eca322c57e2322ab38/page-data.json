A popular Change.org petition calling for $2,000 monthly payments has now garnered nearly 3 million signatures. As of the time of writing, more than 2,956,000 people had back the demand.\", \"\\\"I'm calling on Congress to support families with a $2,000 payment for adults and a $1,000 payment for kids immediately, and continuing regular checks for the duration of the crisis.

Nearly 390,000 people have signed another Change.org campaign calling for Biden to \\\"endorse giving everyone\\\" $2,000 per month in universal basic income (UBI) until the COVID-19 pandemic is over.\", \"A separate petition makes a similar demand. \\\"Supplying Americans with monthly support ( $2,000 minimum per person) until they can get back on their feet can save our communities from financial ruin,\\\" it said. Over 225,000 people have backed that online effort.\", \"Nearly 183,000 people have signed another petition urging the government to provide most Americans with $2,000 per month.

Hundreds of thousands of those payments, which were approved in the summer, continue to be sent out to Californians. Nearly 800,000 more stimulus checks were direct deposited or mailed out starting Friday in the West Coast state, according to the state's Franchise Tax Board.\", \"When the payments were approved earlier this year, California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom's administration said that about two-thirds of Californians would be eligible for payments of $600. Additionally, the state's residents can receive another $500 for dependents.\", \"The latest disbursement of California stimulus checks will bring the total of payments mailed out to more than 6 million in total. Earlier this year, the state provided another one-time $600 payment to lower-income California residents as well.\", \"While there is no current plan on the federal level to send out additional stimulus checks, many lawmakers have publicly supported the idea. More than 80 members of the House and Senate have signed onto letters or proposals backing further direct payments or reoccurring monthly stimulus checks for the duration of the pandemic.\"]","href_hash":"ae54b584449f11eca322c57e2322ab38"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ae54b584449f11eca322c57e2322ab38"}},
