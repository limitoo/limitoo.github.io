Glenn Youngkin on Monday, objecting to his executive order overruling their mask policies and making the wearing of masks optional in public schools.\", \"The school districts include the Fairfax County Public Schools, the state\\u2019s largest with more than 178,000 students, as well as the school systems in Prince William County, Alexandria, Arlington, Falls Church, Hampton, and Richmond. Together, the districts serve more than 350,000 students.\", \"The school districts said in a statement on Monday that the lawsuit, filed in Arlington District Court, \\u201cdefends the right of school boards to enact policy at the local level, including policies that protect the health and well-being of all students and staff,.\\u201d\", \"The school officials questioned whether an executive order \\u201ccan unilaterally override\\u201d the authority given to local boards by the state constitution. The suit also disputes whether the governor\\u2019s order can override legislative action taken in 2021 that allowed students to attend classes in person while local school boards follow recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\", \"\\u201cWithout today\\u2019s action, school boards are placed in a legally untenable position \\u2014 faced with an executive order that is in conflict with the constitution and state law,\\u201d the lawsuit says.\", \"A spokeswoman for the governor, Macaulay Porter, said in a statement that the governor\\u2019s office was \\u201cdisappointed that these school boards are ignoring parent\\u2019s rights.\\u201d She said Mr. Youngkin and the state attorney general were committed to fighting the lawsuit.\", \"Mr. Youngkin issued an executive order on Jan. 15, the day he took office, that said parents could decide for themselves whether to follow school mask mandates. The order aimed to end a mandate imposed by Mr. Youngkin\\u2019s predecessor, Ralph Northam.\", \"Mr. Youngkin ordered that the parents of any child enrolled in a school or a school-based early child care and educational program \\u201cmay elect for their children not to be subject to any mask mandate in effect\\u201d at the facility.\", \"\\u201cParents should have the ability to decide whether their child should wear masks for the duration of the school day,\\u201d it reads.\", \"The schools\\u2019 lawsuit said, in part, that the plaintiff\\u2019s schools \\u201chave students and staff members who are particularly vulnerable to the effects of Covid-19, and for whom an infection with the virus could lead to serious illness or death\\u201d and that masks were among the mitigation measures the schools have taken for the 2021-22 school year.\"]","href_hash":"3daa11dc7d2d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3daa11dc7d2d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
