The country's COVID-19 death toll is expected to pass 100,000 this week.\", \"Spahn urged all eligible Germans to get vaccinated, including booster shots for those who had their last dose more than six months ago.\", \"\\\"By the end of this winter pretty much everyone in Germany...will have been vaccinated, recovered or died,\\\" Spahn told reporters in Berlin.\", \"He said the view might be cynical, but it is still true. \\\"With the highly contagious Delta variant this is very, very likely and that's why we are recommending vaccination so urgently,\\\" Spahn said.\", \"About 68 perent of Germany's population is fully vaccinated. The German government said they want that figure to reach above 75 percent to most effectively curb the spread.\", \"In the AP report, Spahn said approximately 50 million doses of the Moderna and BioNtech-Pfizer vaccines will be available to Germans for the rest of the year. However, to reach this amount, Germany is holding back tens of millions of doses originally intended to be given to poor countries. He said those doses would be replaced at a later date.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937696/germany-covid-19-vaccine.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">About 68 percent of Germans are fully vaccinated, but government officials would like that number to be above 75 percent.

The doctors' association there said Saxony needs to prepare for a system of triage to manage the few remaining ICU beds in the state.\", \"Gernot Marx, the head of Germany's intensive care association DIVI, said many hospitals in hard-hit regions have begun postponing scheduled surgery.\", \"He noted that the country has about 4,000 fewer ICU beds available than a year ago because large numbers of medical staff quit their jobs because of the intense strain of working during the pandemic.\", \"A senior doctor at Berlin's Charite hospital, Steffen Weber-Carstens, said the city of 3.6 million had only 89 free ICU beds left Monday.\", \"Despite high infection rates among children, schools remain open in Germany.\", \"Spahn, the health minister, said he expects the European Union to approve vaccines against COVID-19 for children aged 5-11 at the end of the week.\", \"The EU will begin shipping vaccines adjusted for younger children on December 20, with Germany initially getting 2.4 million doses, he said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937703/jens-spahn-german-health-minister.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">German Health Minister Jens Spahn said the country's unvaccinated can expect to contract COVID-19 by the end of winter.
