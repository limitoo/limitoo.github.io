According to reports, the day before the shooting, the school contacted his parents after a teacher saw Crumbley looking at pictures of bullets on his phone during class. His mother\\u2019s response? \\u201cLOL I\\u2019m not mad at you,\\u201d she allegedly texted, \\u201cYou have to learn not to get caught.\\u201d Apparently, the morning of the shooting, Crumbley was observed drawing disturbing and violent images, which he claimed were for a video game he was designing. He was taken out of class, and after a meeting with school officials, his parents were told they had to look for counseling for him within 48 hours. The school tried get his parents to take him home, but they wouldn\\u2019t and Crumbley was sent back to class. The unthinkable happened and now four teenagers are dead and several others are hurt.\", \"Reporting in The Washington Post and The Times suggests that experts don\\u2019t agree about whether the school should have known that there was a credible threat to other students. Oxford\\u2019s superintendent said that Crumbley\\u2019s demeanor, his parents\\u2019 responses to \\u201cspecific probing questions\\u201d and his lack of prior infractions led school authorities to believe that Crumbley wasn\\u2019t dangerous.\", \"The parents of two sisters who survived the shooting filed a federal lawsuit this week against the school district, \\u201cincluding the superintendent, principal, dean of students, two guidance counselors and two teachers,\\u201d Dana Goldstein, a Times education reporter, writes. The lawsuit claims the school had \\u201creckless disregard\\u201d for student safety, stating that \\u201cCrumbley posted countdowns and threats of bodily harm\\u201d on social media.\", \"As a parent who sends her children into a public school every day, assuming that they\\u2019ll be safe, I wanted to know: How do school administrators and staff assess whether a student is dangerous? Teenagers are expert at pushing boundaries. So, how do professionals untangle adolescent bravado from threats of violence?\", \"Unfortunately, \\u201cthere is no profile of a school shooter that is reliable,\\u201d said Stephen Brock, a school psychologist and former president of the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP). However, \\u201cThere is absolutely a difference between making a threat and posing a threat.\\u201d He added, \\u201cjust because a student made a threat, doesn\\u2019t mean they\\u2019re a danger to themselves or others. There are risk factors and warning signs that would elevate one\\u2019s concerns and the probability they may act out.\\u201d\", \"While it\\u2019s impossible to predict human behavior, Brock said, the best predictor is past behavior. According to NASP\\u2019s \\u201cBrief Facts and Tips\\u201d on threat assessment at school, \\u201cMost students who pose a substantive threat indicate their intentions in some way. Examples include statements to friends, ideas in written work, drawings, and postings on social media that threaten harm.\\u201d\", \"In the event of an alarming behavioral incident, schools are supposed to have a plan in place to address it, which ideally would include convening a group of qualified adults to assess the child. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t want any one person dealing with this on their own. The stakes are too high,\\u201d Brock said. NASP\\u2019s guidance suggests the involvement of \\u201cThe appropriate school administrator, the school crisis team leader, the school-employed mental health professional and/or local law enforcement immediately.\\u201d\", \"Brock said that school psychologists don\\u2019t always want to contact law enforcement. \\u201cWe\\u2019re really sensitive to the school to prison pipeline. We don\\u2019t want to involve law enforcement reflexively,\\u201d he said. But schools should have established relationships with the local police, he added, and ideally those officers will have some special training to work in schools.\", \"Josh McKivigan, a behavioral health therapist who works with middle and high school students, said that the majority of threats that he has encountered do not turn into violence. \\u201cIt\\u2019s usually students acting out, needing some sort of mental health treatment,\\u201d McKivigan said. And he said that students are getting better and better at identifying and sounding the alarm to teachers and counselors when their friends are exhibiting worrying behaviors \\u2014 like not sleeping, not bathing, isolating from people or saying bizarre things.\", \"Still, he said that as a school therapist, he found the Michigan incident chilling because it seemed, based on reports, like the accused student\\u2019s parents weren\\u2019t willing to work with the school to help monitor their child. McKivigan also said that with Covid, he\\u2019s seeing a baseline level of irritability, anger and mistrust among parents and students alike, which he finds worrisome. \\u201cIt feels like a perfect storm for a crisis happening,\\u201d he said.\", \"Despite the absolute terror that mass shootings inspire in just about everyone, it\\u2019s worth pointing out that these types of events are relatively rare, and schools remain among the safest places for children. According to the national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS), which monitors youth behaviors every two years, 11.8 percent of students carried a weapon on school property in 1993 in the 30 days before the survey and only 2.8 percent did in 2019. Brock also pointed out to me that violence in schools is prevented all the time; we just don\\u2019t often hear about those cases. The Post just ran a story about a grandmother who did contact authorities, potentially averting a tragedy.\", \"Just because students may be relatively physically safe does not mean they feel psychologically safe. There is evidence that they don\\u2019t. According to YRBS data, almost twice the percentage of students missed at least one day school because of safety concerns in the 30 days before the survey than was the case years ago \\u2014 8.7 percent in 2019, up from 4.4 percent in 1993. Lauren Koong, who won a Times Learning Network essay contest, wrote about how every time she hears the lunch bell ring at her Houston high school, she is reminded of a gang-related shooting that happened her freshman year.\", \"For too many of our kids, we can\\u2019t erase these awful memories, and I confess that after reporting this out, I don\\u2019t feel optimistic. Not because I don\\u2019t think teachers and school counselors aren\\u2019t prepared to address potential violence. On the contrary, I think most of them are doing their best to keep students safe. But they aren\\u2019t psychic, and in a country where there are, according to one study, 120.5 firearms for every 100 residents, there will always be the potential for a worst-case scenario.\", \"If you want a chance to get your Tiny Victory published, find us on Instagram @NYTparenting and use the hashtag #tinyvictories; email us; or enter your Tiny Victory at the bottom of this page.
