But parents looking for a bigger screen or better picture quality may not recognize the tip-over risk for TVs, a hazard that can be dangerous \\u2014 and sometimes deadly \\u2014 for children. The good news? There's a relatively simple and inexpensive fix.\", \"Every year, hospital emergency rooms treat an estimated 22,500 people injured by televisions, furniture and appliances tipping over, according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission. Between 2000 and 2020, there were 581 tip-over deaths, most of them kids. Of the 472 child fatalities, 71% involved a television, the CPSC said in a report last week.\\u00a0\", \"The peril is greatest when a\\u00a0 TV is sitting on furniture that can also fall over. Children have been known to pull out a dresser's drawers to use as steps to climb, which can cause a dresser and TV to topple over.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Kids climb everything, even when you're in the room \\u2014 it can happen in an instant,\\\" CPSC Chair Alex Hoehn-Saric told CBS MoneyWatch in a recent interview. \\\"We have had too many furniture units and other products tipping over and killing and injuring children.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Many parents and caregivers do not anchor furniture and TVs to the wall because they view it as unnecessary so long as they keep watch over their kids, according to a 2020 CPSC\\u00a0survey.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"People either don't know about the risks, or they think it can't happen when an adult is nearby,\\\" Hoehn-Saric said last week in a\\u00a0statement.\", \"That's not always the case, with potentially tragic consequences. A year ago, a 23-month-old named Kaesyn Williams died in Atlanta after a dresser tipped on him.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Anything can happen under a second, anything can happen,\\\" Sa'Mya Williams told the\\u00a0local CBS affiliate. \\\"I loved being his mom,\\\" she added.\", \"The CPSC's report and the NFL's biggest game coincide with steep retailer sales this time of year, with current models typically discounted ahead of new sets hitting the market in March or April.\\u00a0\", \"Americans bought nearly 45 million TVs last year. Kits to prevent tip-overs cost less than $20 and can be installed in 20 minutes or less, according to the CPSC. For instance, BestBuy\\u00a0offers an anti-tip kit for furniture for $9.99. \\u00a0\", \"Child safety groups say anchoring a TV is advised, but not enough of a solution, arguing that many renters can't anchor furniture because their leases won't allow them, or they don't understand the risk.\\u00a0\", \"As things stand, there are voluntary standards for furniture, but legislation passed the U.S. House in June and has been introduced in the U.S. Senate that would require mandatory rules for furniture stability.\\u00a0\", \"Meantime, the CPSC has posted a slew of recalls related to the hazard, the most recent last week. One high-profile recall came in March 2020 by Ikea for 820,000 chests sold nationwide. That recall came after the Swedish furniture retailer\\u00a0agreed to pay $46 million\\u00a0to the parents of a California toddler killed by one of its dressers in 2017.\", \"The CPSC outlines a number of steps for reducing tip-over risks, including\\u00a0how\\u00a0to anchor furniture:\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"7edbae1688ce11ec9b7da14944af787a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7edbae1688ce11ec9b7da14944af787a"}},
