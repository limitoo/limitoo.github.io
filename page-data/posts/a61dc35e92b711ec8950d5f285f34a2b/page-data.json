And as expected she has gone outstandingly. The players have really warmed to her, and the players really look up to her.\\\"\", \"\\\"Her greatest strengths are that she is really humble, she relates to everyone around her at their level, which is fantastic to see. She is cool and calm under pressure, which I love about her. When things get difficult, she stays calm and sticks with process.\\\"\", \"\\\"She is physically and mentally extremely tough herself, so she always leads from the front. And she is highly intelligent, which helps. She picks up things really quickly, not only in game-plan but in what's happening in around her in the environment as well.\\\"\", \"\\\"Lastly, she has the respect of the players already.\\\"\", \"The Hurricanes Poua kick-off their Sky Super Rugby Aupiki campaign against Matat\\u016b on March 6 in Christchurch.\"]","href_hash":"a61dc35e92b711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a61dc35e92b711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
