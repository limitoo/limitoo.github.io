slowly, you're giving producers and consumers the gift of time.\", \"If people come to believe that prices are only going to be rising\\u00a0gently, they won't feel rushed to make\\u00a0investment and

will avoid\\u00a0some damaging fits and starts in activity.\", \"It's why so\\u00a0many countries have adopted inflation targeting regimes since the 1990s.\", \"See below.\", \"<img

so?\", \"After the pain of \\\"stagflation\\\" in the 1970s, policymakers restructured Australia's economy in the 1980s and 1990s.\", \"The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA)\\u00a0adopted\\u00a0an official inflation target in 1993, aiming\\u00a0to keep inflation within a range of 2 to 3 per cent, on average, over the cycle.\", \"Many economists think it helped\\u00a0Australia's\\u00a0economy to

come\\u00a0from?</div>\", \"Our inflation-targeting regime sits inside a larger framework.\", \"Think about economic growth\\u00a0itself.\", \"Have you ever wondered where it comes from?\", \"For hundreds of years, economists have known that the building blocks of economic activity are land, labour and capital.\", \"Those building blocks are the inputs we use\\u00a0to produce goods and

more comfortably?\", \"If so, it means your economy hasn't been producing at its\\u00a0potential level.\", \"The potential level of output is the theoretical frontier of your economy's productive capacity.\", \"It's the maximum level of\\u00a0goods and services your economy should be able to produce without creating destabilising inflationary pressures.\", \"You can visualise it this

its capacity.\", \"In the 1970s, when\\u00a0Australia's economy was hit by stagflation,\\u00a0the economy's actual output ended up running well above its potential output, according to the theory.\",
