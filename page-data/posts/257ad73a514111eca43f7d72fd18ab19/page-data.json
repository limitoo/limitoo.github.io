No region will move to green before 17 January.\", \"Bay of Islands festival organiser Jackie Saunders said her concert - headlined by Salmonella Dub and scheduled for 29 January - was prepped and ready to go.\", \"But Northland will have to move from red to orange for that to happen.\", \"\\\"Red traffic light means that we can't operate the festival, the restrictions to outdoor capacities make the event unviable and that will be a shame, because it's a huge drawcard for locals, for tourists, and for the region.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/34972/eight_col_Salmonella_Dub_Web.jpg?1496111784\\\" alt=\\\"Salmonella Dub\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\n\\u00a0 Salmonella Dub \\nPhoto: Supplied\\n</div>\", \"The festival usually attracts between 4000-5000 people and Sanders was hopeful that by early next year Northland's vaccination rates could improve.\", \"\\\"We'd hold on as long as we could but probably a couple of weeks out, we'd have to make a decision.\\\"\", \"She was\\u00a0not the only one keeping a close eye on the settings.\", \"New Zealand Promoters Association president Brent Eccles said there could be a lot of shows that could not go ahead because of the vaccination situation and regions being in the red zones. That includes Northern Bass near Mangawhai and Rhythm and Vines in Gisborne.\", \"But he said he did not expect red zones would stay red forever and believed concerts could go ahead safely.\", \"\\\"What are those kids going to do - I mean they're not going to sit at home watching TV with mum and dad.
