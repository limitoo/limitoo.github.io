Even our city\\u2019s anthem, Randy Newman\\u2019s \\u201cI Love L.A.,\\u201d is unmistakably tongue-in-cheek.\", \"But for many Angelenos, myself included, the open secret about living here is that it\\u2019s pretty incredible. The vastness and heterogeneity of Los Angeles often make it feel like a land of endless wonders, difficult to translate for people who come for only a few days.\", \"\\u201cVisiting Los Angeles and living in Los Angeles are very different experiences. I don\\u2019t really recommend the former but I find the latter enriching,\\u201d Rosecrans Baldwin, a writer in Los Angeles, told me. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a lot of room in Los Angeles, especially for people who might not fit somewhere else, and I think that gives the city a tremendous amount of life.\\u201d\", \"Baldwin interviewed dozens of Angelenos for his recent book, \\u201cEverything Now: Lessons from the City-State of Los Angeles.\\u201d And true to form, many seemed hesitant to proclaim their love for the city.\", \"Baldwin chalked it up to tired comparisons of Los Angeles and New York that have long framed our city as an underdog. Even the popular \\u201cS.N.L.\\u201d sketch \\u201cThe Californians\\u201d portrays us as little more than drawling, driving idiots.\", \"When I moved to Los Angeles in 2013, I too wasn\\u2019t expecting much. I had been living in the Bay Area, where a feeling of intellectual and cultural superiority to Los Angeles ran rampant.\", \"But within a year or so, the city had won me over. I could hike to Griffith Observatory any day of the year, find every food I dreamed of (and more) and see my family as often as I chose. Nowadays, nothing compares to watching from a window seat of a plane as we descend into this twinkling metropolis and knowing I\\u2019m almost home.\", \"Baldwin moved to Los Angeles six years ago and quickly fell for the region\\u2019s unruliness, he said. While other cities can feel as if you\\u2019re walking around a tidy outdoor shopping mall, Los Angeles surprises him daily.\", \"He also has a connection to the city: his first name, shared by the famous street mentioned in 2Pac\\u2019s \\u201cCalifornia Love.\\u201d Both Baldwin and the street are named after William Rosecrans, a congressman from the late 1800s who\\u2019s an ancestor of Baldwin\\u2019s.\", \"Baldwin told me he was hopeful that unabashedly loving Los Angeles was becoming less taboo. Most people he interviewed revealed they were happy here.\", \"\\u201cEven people who were in the most struggling of circumstances that I talked to, they had their Los Angeles,\\u201d Baldwin said. \\u201cThere was some sense of like, the ground has shifted a little bit, that perhaps it\\u2019s not as clich\\u00e9 as it might\\u2019ve been to be up front, \\u2018Yeah, I love L.A.,\\u2019 and cue the Randy Newman song.\\u201d\", \"Cue it indeed: I\\u2019ve long wondered whether the songwriter behind the wry \\u201cI Love L.A.,\\u201d the unofficial theme song of the 1984 Summer Olympics, actually loves Los Angeles.\", \"You may remember that the song\\u2019s narrator drives in a convertible, takes in the city\\u2019s sights \\u2014 \\u201cLook at that bum over there\\u201d \\u2014 and listens to the Beach Boys, all beside \\u201ca big nasty redhead\\u201d in the passenger seat.\", \"When I called Newman on a recent morning (he was in his home in the Pacific Palisades), he told me that while his song might not be \\u201ca Chamber of Commerce tune,\\u201d that didn\\u2019t mean the Angeleno in his lyrics enjoyed his life any less.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s sort of an aggressive ignorance to it that I like. You know, he likes the redhead. I do too \\u2014 and the Beach Boys and riding in an open car,\\u201d he said. \\u201cMaybe people in L.A. have to apologize for those kinds of basic joys in life, but I don\\u2019t know why.\\u201d\", \"Plus, Newman noted, no matter the original intention, when \\u201cI Love L.A.\\u201d is played now, like at Dodger Stadium after the home team wins, \\u201cpeople are unabashedly happy.\\u201d\", \"So, I asked Newman, \\u201cDo you love L.A.?\\u201d He took a long pause.\", \"\\u201cI think I\\u2019ve come to,\\u201d he said. \\u201cMaybe the song had something to do with it.
