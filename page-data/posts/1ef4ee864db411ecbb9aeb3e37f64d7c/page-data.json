international borders being closed and the horticulture industry pleading for more workers, a study has found.\", \"Research released today found\\u00a0the number of workers employed on fruit and vegetable farms dropped by\\u00a0eight per cent last year, but\\u00a0output remained relatively unchanged.\", \"The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) found the number of workers dropped by 11,000 in 2020-21 compared to the year before.\", \"\\\"Despite this, overall horticulture output levels are estimated to have remained relatively steady, partly due to an improvement in seasonal conditions,\\\" ABARES executive director Jared Greenville said.\", \"\\\"Output has also been maintained through a range of adaptations that many horticulture producers made in response to the reduced availability of overseas workers.\\\"\", \"The research, based on farmers surveys, found that horticulture farms employed around 135,000 workers across 2020-21, including family, permanent and contract employees.\", \"ABARES also found that retail prices for fruit and vegetables had remained relatively stable, increasing by just 5 per cent at the check out, despite exceptional growing conditions which can typically drive oversupply and reduced retail prices.\", \"In September last year, an industry commissioned report suggested the farm sector would be 26,000 workers short for the summer harvest because Australia had closed its borders, in response to COVID-19.\", \"<img

said the ABARES report showed a missed opportunity for the industry to capitalise on positive seasonal conditions.\", \"\\\"Had the industry been able to source the workforce it needed, or even had pre-pandemic worker numbers, it is likely we would have seen significant growth in the horticulture sector,\\\" the statement said.\", \"\\\"Unfortunately because we were not able to access the workforce the industry needed to capitalise on the high yields, it resulted in many crops not being picked.\\\"\", \"The Horticulture Council said last year's modelling suggested industry could be short up to 26,000 workers was based on the worst case scenario, but the government had restarted the Seasonal Worker Program (SWP), which brought more than 11,000\\u00a0workers from the Pacific into Australia during the pandemic.\", \"\\\"ABARES indicated the sector was short about 11,000 workers in the end, and that is largely as a result of the restart of the SWP as well as the various incentive based programmes to attract Australians onto farms,\\\" the Horticultural Council said in a\\u00a0statement.\", \"ABARES said that in\\u00a02020-21 the number of backpackers employed on
