It was so disruptive to the wh\\u0101nau, to their schooling at the end of the year and their ability to socialise and take part in wh\\u0101nau and other community events.\", \"\\\"We're getting a sense that wh\\u0101nau want this.\\\"\", \"Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said the vaccine would not be mandatory for children and they would not need vaccine passes.\", \"The dose is a third of the strength of the adult one and children aged 5 to 11 will need two shots eight weeks apart.\", \"Paediatrician Dr Jin Russell said this gap between doses added to its efficacy and safety.\", \"\\\"I think it's a very smart move because evidence suggests that this will reduce the likelihood of any adverse events after vaccine or any side effects, even lower from what is already showing to be a very safe vaccine.\\\"\", \"More than seven million doses have so far been administered to children in the United States. Russell said results showed the vaccine was safe, and that serious side effects were extremely rare - less than one in a million for myocarditis.\", \"The government is not introducing a target to reach for immunising children - something she said may need to change.\", \"\\\"Parents are just getting used to the idea of vaccinating their children, however if circumstances change and if we had a high level of community transmission it may be reasonable to set targets just so that we are able to measure and hold the government and its systems accountable for how the vaccine rollout is going.\", \"\\\"If that were to happen, then I would strongly advocate for there to be targets for M\\u0101ori tamariki.\\\"\", \"The government said it will resource M\\u0101ori health services and iwi to get the message out and vaccinate wh\\u0101nau.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/131868/eight_col_Rod_Jackson.png?1634023626\\\" alt=\\\"Epidemiologist Professor Rod Jackson.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nEpidemiologist Rod Jackson says stragglers will be hard to reach. \\nPhoto: RNZ / Nick Monro\\n</div>\", \"Epidemiologist Rod Jackson said good systems were already in place and it was the stragglers who would remain hard to reach.\", \"\\\"It is a bit deal but we know how to do it. To me the biggest problem is to get those last five percent vaccinated, that's the hard work. Organising a booster dose for those people who've already had two doses, I think that's much more straightforward.\\\"\", \"If the uptake is good for both the booster and children's vaccine, he said the country would be well placed to weather winter.\", \"\\\"It makes total sense, we just have to be prepared for Omicron and this is the only way to prepare. We'll be better prepared than anyone else in the world for Omicron in winter.\\\"\", \"And vaccination centres are already planning for a busy start to the new year.\", \"Harwood said Auckland vaccination centres are preparing to make their drive-throughs child-friendly.\", \"\\\"The drive through ones for example are going to offer places where the wh\\u0101nau can come out of the car, the child can sit in mum, dad's, koro, nana's lap while they're having the vaccination rather than having to have it in the car, but then go back to the car and have a treat like an ice block.\\\"\", \"She said there's some reassurance for children - their dose is smaller, and so is the needle.\"]","href_hash":"9aa6cf9e62a011ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9aa6cf9e62a011ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
