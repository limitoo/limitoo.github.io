Freddie Freeman, the Atlanta Braves\\u2019 slugger known for smiles, small talk and soft-serve ice cream, hit the last home run of the season and caught the throw from shortstop for the final out of the World Series. Nice guys finish first.\", \"This is the life Freeman wanted \\u2014 the baseball career, yes, but also the reputation he has earned along the way. He owed that much to his mother, Rosemary, who died of melanoma in 2000.\", \"\\u201cHe felt like, to honor his mom, he had to be a great kid,\\u201d his father, Fred Freeman, said on the Minute Maid Park infield late Tuesday night, after Atlanta finished off the Houston Astros, 7-0, in Game 6. \\u201cThat was it. When he was 10, that\\u2019s what he decided he was going to be. He always said, \\u2018I know mom\\u2019s watching.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The roof was open on a warm night here Tuesday, perfect viewing for Hank Aaron, Phil Niekro, Rosemary Freeman and so many more. Maybe you believe in that imagery, maybe you don\\u2019t. But the soul of the Braves does, and for now, he is the one atop the baseball world.\", \"\\u201cBelieve me, I wish I was able to hug my mom on that field,\\u201d Freeman said. \\u201cBut I know she\\u2019s up with my grandma right now, jumping up and down.\\u201d\", \"Freeman said his wife, Chelsea, texted him two hours before Game 6 to tell him his mother would be proud of him. It was not a message Freeman thought he needed then, he said, because it made him emotional before the biggest game of his life.\", \"But it was appropriate, he added, and it worked. It was comforting, said Freddie\\u2019s older brother, Andrew, to think of how their mother would have celebrated.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019d be the first one on that field, running out to bearhug him right now,\\u201d Andrew said. \\u201cShe did everything for us. She didn\\u2019t know baseball, so she bought \\u2018Baseball For Dummies\\u2019 to know how to do this thing. She would always wear our buttons \\u2014 she was the \\u2018Button Mom\\u2019 in Little League \\u2014 and to think that if she was here today, oh my gosh. It would be absolutely amazing.\\u201d\", \"Rosemary might have known that her son was bound for stardom. In tee ball at age 6, Freddie hit the ball so hard that he was deemed too dangerous for that division of the North Sunrise Little League in Orange, Calif. He practiced with the 12-year-olds instead.\", \"At age 7, Freeman played with the 9-year-olds. At 9, he played with the 12-year-olds. As a senior at El Modena High School, he was chosen by Atlanta in the second round of the 2007 draft. Fred had to sign the contract \\u2014 for a $409,500 bonus \\u2014 because Freddie was only 17, and when Freddie grew homesick in the Gulf Coast League, Fred flew to Orlando for two weeks of ballgames on back fields and dinners at Applebee\\u2019s.\", \"A pattern was established: Freeman would struggle, call dad and find his way.\", \"\\u201cEven in Triple-A, when he was 20, he\\u2019d call me after two weeks and he was batting under .100,\\u201d Fred Freeman said. \\u201cHe said, \\u2018Dad, I made a mistake, I need to come home, I\\u2019m not good enough.\\u2019\", \"\\u201cSo I flew out to Charlotte, because they were playing there, and I watched one game and he struck out four times. And I said, \\u2018Freddie, you\\u2019re so excited, there wasn\\u2019t one strike that you swung at.\\u2019 He said, \\u2018Really?\\u2019 I said, \\u2018Freddie, they\\u2019re bouncing up there. Tomorrow, don\\u2019t swing. You can\\u2019t do any worse.\\u2019 So he walked the first two times on eight pitches, and then the third time up he hit one off the center field fence on the first pitch.\\u201d\", \"Freeman was in the majors by the end of that 2010 season, playing for a Hall of Fame manager, Bobby Cox, and hitting his first home run off a Hall of Fame pitcher, Roy Halladay. In 11 full seasons in the majors, Freeman has never had a down year.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what I\\u2019d do without him, quite honestly,\\u201d said Braves Manager Brian Snitker. \\u201cHe\\u2019s my rock. I go to him with things. I\\u2019ve been with him since the first day he came here in the big leagues. He\\u2019s everything that the Braves stand for.\\u201d\", \"The ball from the final out \\u2014 thrown by Will Smith, hit by Yuli Gurriel, fielded by Dansby Swanson, caught by Freeman \\u2014 belongs to Snitker, Freeman said. It was a typical gesture from Freeman, who also turned down General Manager Alex Anthopoulos\\u2019s offer to buy him an ice-cream machine for his home as a gift for winning the division.\", \"That decision, Freeman conceded, had more to do with upkeep than humility. But he feels a strong bond to the Braves, who rebuilt around him while trading star teammates like Jason Heyward, Craig Kimbrel, Andrelton Simmons and Justin Upton. The team endured four losing seasons in a row during Freeman\\u2019s prime, and he never complained.\", \"\\u201cThey didn\\u2019t really owe me anything,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI owed everything to them because they gave me the opportunity to live out a childhood dream. So in my mind, I wanted to do everything I possibly could to help get this team back to winning, because I came up when we were winning.\\u201d\", \"This was Freeman\\u2019s sixth trip to the postseason, and the most unlikely. Atlanta had the fewest victories (88) of any team in the playoff field, and did not nudge their record above .500 for good until Aug. 8.\", \"In a doubleheader sweep by the lowly Arizona Diamondbacks in April, Atlanta managed one hit in the first game (by Freeman) and none in the second against Madison Bumgarner. Freeman finished that game with a .205 average.\", \"\\u201cAfter that game, I was sitting there with him going, \\u2018My gosh, this could be a very long year,\\u2019\\u201d Andrew Freeman said. \\u201cAnd you know what? He\\u2019s like, \\u2018We\\u2019re a good team.\\u2019 He believed it. He believed this was a good team. He believed they had what it took to win a championship.\\u201d\", \"A barrage of injuries, most significantly to outfielder Ronald Acu\\u00f1a Jr., could have challenged that belief. But, then, it is hard to pierce Freeman\\u2019s aura of positivity.\", \"\\u201cFreddie was a believer all the way,\\u201d said Terry McGuirk, Atlanta\\u2019s chairman. \\u201cFreddie\\u2019s never had a day where he took off and didn\\u2019t play hard. That\\u2019s the makeup that enabled this team to build around him and create what we have today.\\u201d\", \"McGuirk added: \\u201cYou don\\u2019t get here without the veteran leaders, and he\\u2019s the leader of the veterans.\\u201d\", \"The end of the World Series also brought an end to Freeman\\u2019s eight-year, $135 million contract. He won the National League\\u2019s Most Valuable Player Award in 2020, thrived in this postseason (a .304 average with five homers and a 1.045 on-base plus slugging percentage) and will command a rich contract in free agency.\", \"Freeman has been open about his wishes \\u2014 \\u201cI think everyone in this room knows I want to stay here,\\u201d he said in a news conference during the World Series \\u2014 and while McGuirk was coy about the future after Game 6, he did say, \\u201cHey, I love him.\\u201d\", \"McGuirk also said Freeman deserves a spot in the Hall of Fame, and he\\u2019s probably right. According to Baseball Reference, the most similar player to Freeman at every age, from 21 through 31, is Eddie Murray, a first-ballot inductee to Cooperstown.\", \"If Freeman gets there, the 2021 championship will be etched on his plaque. It is the fulfillment of a wish Freeman shared at his locker in Atlanta one day in 2017, another lost season, when a night like Tuesday seemed as distant as a star above the Texas sky.\", \"\\u201cEverybody talks about legacies and all that,\\u201d Freeman said then. \\u201cWhat\\u2019s a legacy without a championship? What\\u2019s the point of that? I want to win, and that\\u2019s all I care about.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"fce07ca43d5811ecb8de000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fce07ca43d5811ecb8de000017025a03"}},
