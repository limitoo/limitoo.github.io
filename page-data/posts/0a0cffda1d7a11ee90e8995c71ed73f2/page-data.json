In 1880, Thomas Edison received a historic patent embodying the principles of his incandescent lamp.\", \"When the book was last in New Bedford, the nation was preparing for its second modern World Series, incumbent Republican President Theodore Roosevelt was on track to win another term, Wilbur and Orville Wright had conducted their first airplane flight just a year before and New York City was celebrating its first subway line.\", \"The discovery and return of the book is a testament to the durability of the printed word, especially in a time of computerization and instant access to unfathomable amounts of information, Melo said. \", \"\\\"The value of the printed book is it's not digital, it's not going to disappear. Just holding it, you get the sense of someone having this book 120 years ago and reading it, and here it is in my hands,\\\" she said. \\\"It is still going to be here a hundred years from now. The printed book is always going to be valuable.\\\"\", \"The New Bedford library has a 5-cent-per-day late fee. At that rate, someone returning a book overdue by 119 years would face a hefty fee of more than $2,100. The good news is the library's late fee limit maxes out at $2.\", \"Another lesson of the find, according to Melo? It's never too late to return a library book.\"]","href_hash":"0a0cffda1d7a11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0a0cffda1d7a11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
