Protracted conflicts grind on, and instability has worsened in several parts of the world, notably Ethiopia, Myanmar and Afghanistan,\\\" said Griffiths.\", \"With the pandemic ongoing, Griffiths said they were able to vaccinate millions of people in Myanmar but that \\\"The pandemic is not over, and poor countries are deprived of vaccines.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944437/directorate-disaster-office-afghanistan.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The United Nations is predicting that 274 million people will require emergency humanitarian aid next year in countries including Afghanistan and Ethiopia.

This year, donors provided over $17 billion for projects in last year's Global Humanitarian Overview from OCHA, but funding has been less than half of the U.N. request for 2021.\", \"The overview lays out country-specific plans for 30 countries, half of them in Africa, and most of the rest in the Middle East or Latin America.\", \"Griffiths cited estimates by the U.N.'s Food and Agricultural Organization that 45 million people are at risk of famine, in dozens of countries.\", \"\\\"Humanitarian aid matters,\\\" said Griffiths. \\\"We were able to stop famine affecting half a million people in southern Sudan...we delivered health care to 10 million people in Yemen.\\\"\", \"OCHA says more than 24 million people require life-saving assistance in Afghanistan, driven by conflict, political turmoil, the coronavirus, economic shocks and the worst drought in more than a generation.\", \"\\\"We never left Afghanistan.
