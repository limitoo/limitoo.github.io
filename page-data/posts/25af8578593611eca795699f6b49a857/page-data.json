But what the 100 or so live spectators (and those who tuned in online) did get was a sprawling, impassioned but overwhelmingly civil conversation among four prominent writers about art, identity, appropriation and the state of free expression.\", \"Those are subjects that have roiled literary circles, including PEN itself, which has increasingly balanced its defense of free speech with consideration of the ways marginalized people may be constrained from raising their voices to begin with.But the playwright and novelist Ayad Akhtar, PEN\\u2019s president, introduced the event by affirming the \\u201cbedrock principle\\u201d of free speech against those on the left who dismiss it as a mask for power and those on the right who wield it as a cudgel.\", \"\\u201cA widespread and punitive stridency descending on us from every quarter,\\u201d he said. And writers, he said, are \\u201ccaught in the middle.\\u201d\", \"The event was about that middle. There were points of tension, but little overt disagreement. Which isn\\u2019t to say there was much overt agreement either, including on whether there is a problem, and if so, what it is.\", \"John McWhorter, a linguist at Columbia University and author of the new book \\u201cWoke Racism: How a New Religion Has Betrayed Black America,\\u201d opened the discussion, which was moderated by Suzanne Nossel, PEN\\u2019s executive director, on a blunt note. \\u201cTo be a writer today, in the current climate, is to be someone who certainly probably censors themselves in some way,\\u201d he said.\", \"McWhorter, who also writes a newsletter for the Opinion section of The New York Times, noted his public identity as \\u201ca contrarian\\u201d on race issues. But does he hold his tongue on some subjects? Absolutely.\", \"He recalled an academic talk he gave in the mid-1990s, about Creole languages and women, which \\u201csome in the audience chose to interpret as offensive and sexist.\\u201d\", \"Listening to their criticisms, he said, \\u201cI thought, \\u2018I don\\u2019t deserve this.\\u2019 And I decided I would never again say or write anything about issues having to do with women or sexism.\\u201d\", \"Wajahat Ali, the author of the forthcoming book \\u201cGo Back to Where You Came From: And Other Helpful Recommendations on How to Become American,\\u201d said the outcry over \\u201ccancel culture\\u201d was a sideshow compared with legislation across the country aimed at prohibiting the teaching of critical race theory or \\u201cdivisive concepts,\\u201d or efforts in Texas to ban hundreds of books from school libraries.\", \"\\u201cLet\\u2019s take stock of what\\u2019s really happening, and what are the forces that are really attacking freedom of speech,\\u201d he said.\", \"As for self-censorship, Ali said that it\\u2019s something writers of color always had to engage in, to avoid offending gatekeepers.\", \"\\u201cWe were not allowed to make mistakes,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t get to fail up, and write endlessly about cancel culture from prestigious outlets.\\u201d\", \"If that might have seemed like a dig at McWhorter (Ali\\u2019s former professor, he noted), it wasn\\u2019t. Social media tends to \\u201cflatten us,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cSo John becomes his last Op-Ed, and then I have to hate him, and he has to hate me,\\u201d Ali said, \\u201cbecause I disagree with his concept of \\u2018wokeness,\\u2019 and we have to fight to the death.\\u201d\", \"The two other panelists offered a more literary approach to the question of who should be allowed, or allow themselves, to say what. Jennifer Finney Boylan, a memoirist and transgender activist, took on the issue of cultural appropriation, a subject on which she said she had \\u201ctwo brains.\\u201d\", \"Boylan, a contributing Opinion writer for The New York Times, cited the recent furor over the novel \\u201cAmerican Dirt,\\u201d and whether its white author had the right to tell a story (badly, some argued) about Mexican migrants to the United States.\", \"\\u201cSurely if freedom of expression means anything, it means the right to tell the stories we want to tell, to answer the demands of our own imaginations, period,\\u201d she said. \\u201cYou can accuse writers of not writing well. But erasing artists because we do not like their art is despicable.\\u201d\", \"But at the same time, she said, as a transgender person, she understood the frustration at works that misrepresent your experience. \\u201cMaybe a single movie or book doesn\\u2019t matter that much,\\u201d she said. But \\u201cif you think defending freedom of expression is really all that important, then you have to think it does matter. A single movie or book can really shape the way people see the world.\\u201d\", \"Carmen Maria Machado, a memoirist and fiction writer, said she was worried about the impact of recent fierce online debates over the ethics of using another person\\u2019s real-life experiences in fiction.\", \"Fiction, she said, is a \\u201cmagpie\\u201d art, that necessarily involves taking bits and pieces not just from imagination or direct experience, but from the our observations of others.\", \"\\u201cNot every story is mine to tell,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s so weird to create blanket statements, of who can do what.\\u201d\", \"She added, \\u201cI\\u2019m worried that fiction writers, especially those forming now, will be stymied and self-censored.\\u201d\", \"Not that everyone agreed that self-restraint was always negative. At one point, McWhorter aired what he suggested was a semi-forbidden thought: that the intensity of the racial justice protests to the police killing of George Floyd was in part about a desire after months of pandemic isolation \\u201cto coalesce,\\u201d \\u201cto go outside,\\u201d \\u201cto belong to each other,\\u201d which was then weaponized by an ideological faction.\", \"\\u201cIn May 2020, a certain ideology used social media to become especially dominant, and scare certain people out of their wits,\\u201d he said.\", \"Boylan protested, gently. \\u2018You say self-censorship like it\\u2019s a bad thing,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBy another name, maybe it\\u2019s a sense of awareness that our words affect other people? You can\\u2019t and maybe shouldn\\u2019t say any damned thing you want.\\u201d\", \"But if there was a point of broad agreement, it was that Twitter was mostly bad. Machado said she had deleted her account several months ago. \\u201cSocial media just creates these incredibly fast, bad conversations that go sideways so quickly, there\\u2019s no recovering from them,\\u201d she said.\", \"McWhorter, who said he checked Twitter \\u201csix or seven times a day,\\u201d said it got in the way of reading \\u2014 let alone writing \\u2014 books.\", \"In a recent essay in The Atlantic, adapted from a lecture, Akhtar lamented how the incentives of online discourse led us to form opposing \\u201cagglomerations of outrage\\u201d affirmed by \\u201cslogans of belonging.\\u201d\", \"Boylan, with a wry smile, made the point a bit more simply. \\u201cOne of the reasons I became a writer,\\u201d she said, \\u201cis because I wanted people to like me.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"25af8578593611eca795699f6b49a857"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"25af8578593611eca795699f6b49a857"}},
