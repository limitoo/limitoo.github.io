However, his movements after getting off the bus are unknown, despite extensive efforts by police.\", \"Police understand Finau, who they say lives in Otahuhu, drove to Laingholm on November 15, the day before his disappearance, where he left his car, a black Nissan Murano SUV/wagon.\", \"Footage released publicly on Friday morning shows Finau getting onto a bus with what appears to be a water bottle. He shows the driver a card, before the footage changes to Finau speaking to the driver at the New Lynn stop. The pair speak, with Finau patting the driver on the shoulder and shaking his hand before exiting.\\u00a0\", \"Police say that due to the length of time since Finau was last seen, they hold \\\"serious concerns for his safety and wellbeing\\\". A son who lives overseas is \\\"understandably very distressed\\\", according to Det Sgt Rob Kerr.\", \"\\\"We are doing everything we can to work out what has happened to Atonio Finau to give his family answers,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"There is nothing to indicate that foul play is involved, however given that there has been no confirmed sightings of Atonio after he was at the New Lynn bus depot, he could have travelled anywhere and we aren\\u2019t able to focus on one particular area.\\\"\", \"In a statement, Finau's son says that his family are \\\"extremely distressed\\\" they don't know where the man is.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It has been a nightmare this past month not knowing what has happened to him,\\\" the unnamed son writes.\", \"\\\"We just want to know he\\u2019s safe and that he knows his family loves and miss him dearly. I urge to anyone who knows any information at all to please come forward to the police to aid their investigation.\\\"\", \"Kerr says the investigation has been made difficult by the length of time between Finau disappearing and the matter being reported to the police, which happened in early December. Additional CCTV enquiries have been unsuccessful.\", \"Police are still hopeful they will find Finau and are asking anyone who spoke with the man or recalls seeing him in New Lynn or in surrounding areas on November 16 or afterwards to get in touch via 105, quoting file number 211203/4366.\"]","href_hash":"1e0ecade643211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1e0ecade643211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
