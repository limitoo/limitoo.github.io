We have been told that his marriage to an older woman was an unhappy one, that Shakespeare\\u2019s bequest to his wife of a \\u201csecond-best bed\\u201d confirms how \\u201clittle he esteemed her,\\u201d and that the \\u201cBirthplace,\\u201d his house on Henley Street, a mecca for literary pilgrims, has remained virtually unchanged since Shakespeare\\u2019s infancy. Over the past 200 years these and similar claims have hardened into fact and have become enshrined in popular biographies.\", \"In \\u201cThe Private Life of William Shakespeare,\\u201d Lena Cowen Orlin has re-examined all of the documentary evidence. She reads it afresh, along with thousands of contemporary wills and local records that provide context for those in which Shakespeare is mentioned. Anyone who has ever struggled to decipher Elizabethan \\u201csecretary hand\\u201d will know how daunting this task has been. The great and lasting result of her labors is how punishingly she demolishes shoddy claims and biased inferences that have distorted our understanding of Shakespeare\\u2019s life.\", \"Shakespeare was born and raised in Stratford-upon-Avon, where he married Anne Hathaway at the age of 18, had three children with her and left town \\u2014 only returning for good late in life. He spent the intervening years, roughly half his lifetime, in London, where he acted and wrote plays. He didn\\u2019t travel back and forth much, reportedly once a year, and was unlikely, Orlin writes, to have attended the funeral in Stratford of his son, Hamnet, or of either of his parents.\", \"Biographers confronted with the mystery of \\u201cHow did Shakespeare become Shakespeare?\\u201d split into two groups: those who see his early years in his hometown as formative, and those (myself included) who place greater weight on his experiences in London. Orlin, whose Shakespeare had a \\u201cpersistent allegiance to his hometown,\\u201d and whose choices there, she argues, determined the trajectory of his life, belongs to the Stratford camp. Her title is somewhat misleading: \\u201cBy \\u2018private life,\\u2019\\u201d she writes, \\u201cI mean Shakespeare\\u2019s family life in Stratford.\\u201d Readers eager for revelations about who were Shakespeare\\u2019s friends and lovers, or what were his religious and political convictions (what we ordinarily mean when we speak of someone\\u2019s private life), will not find answers here.\", \"\\u201cNeither a literary biography nor a full biography,\\u201d this book looks more narrowly at what surviving documents tell us, and, when their trail runs dry, what documents about his neighbors might reveal about events that defined Shakespeare\\u2019s Stratford life: his father\\u2019s financial collapse, his marriage, his homes (including the \\u201cBirthplace,\\u201d likely damaged by fire in the 1590s, then rebuilt), his will and his memorial. Though most of it consists of dense scholarly analysis, it reads like a detective story in which a skilled investigator returns to a cold case.\", \"It amounts to a revisionist portrait of the artist. The transgressive image of Shakespeare circulating in recent years \\u2014 cosmopolitan, perhaps secretly Catholic, most likely gay or bisexual, eager to flee Stratford \\u2014 is replaced here by a Shakespeare who is \\u201ca family man\\u201d in a close economic partnership with his wife. He is especially devoted to his father, whose fall from the height of Stratford\\u2019s leadership to a man who was afraid to leave his house for fear of arrest for debt was, for Orlin, \\u201cthe defining event\\u201d of Shakespeare\\u2019s private life, from which \\u201call else followed.\\u201d She interprets Shakespeare\\u2019s marriage at a young age (which would have brought to an end any apprenticeship and precluded as well a university education) as an act that helped restore his family\\u2019s fortunes. Most scholars have read Shakespeare\\u2019s last will and testament as at best chilly, especially when it came to his family. But Orlin sees it otherwise. While it was not, like many Jacobean wills, an \\u201cexpressive\\u201d one, she shows how each gift that Shakespeare specifies, including apparel, sword, bowl and that notorious bed, shares \\u201cthe imprint of an unnamed grief.\\u201d\", \"She also shows that much of what we take as fact about Shakespeare\\u2019s life hangs by the slenderest of archival threads. Anne Hathaway\\u2019s baptismal record does not survive, and the only reason for believing she was eight years older than Shakespeare is the number that appears on her memorial brass \\u2014 often enough, Orlin shows, imprecisely remembered or rendered. In her assiduous research Orlin came upon a baptismal record from 1566 for a Johanna Hathaway, daughter (as Shakespeare\\u2019s wife was) to a Richard Hathaway of Shottery. Orlin doesn\\u2019t push this possibility too hard, but if this was the woman Shakespeare married \\u2014 her first name inaccurately transcribed \\u2014 Anne might have been two years younger than her husband.\", \"Three contemporary images of Shakespeare are widely accepted as authoritative. One is the awkwardly executed woodcut that appears in the 1623 First Folio. Another is the romantic Chandos portrait now in the National Portrait Gallery. These two are endlessly reproduced. Not the third, an effigy in painted limestone in Stratford\\u2019s Holy Trinity Church, in which Shakespeare looks like \\u2014 as the scholar John Dover Wilson put it \\u2014 a \\u201cself-satisfied pork butcher.\\u201d Orlin\\u2019s account of this monument is definitive. She sends packing the \\u201cauthorship skeptics\\u201d for whom a conspiratorial cover-up accounts for the differences between 17th-century sketches of this memorial and the frequently repaired and looted effigy (from which the actor David Garrick reputedly stole the \\u201cright forefinger\\u201d). She goes on to suggest that Shakespeare likely commissioned the effigy and had met Nicholas Johnson, the artist who made it. If so, like it or not, this is how Shakespeare wanted to be remembered. Her account, detailed and dazzling, also left me melancholy, for all too soon, given cutbacks in funding and training, this kind of scholarship may no longer be possible.\", \"Shakespeare biography is often marked by overreach, and Orlin is not immune. An academic herself, she can\\u2019t help recasting Shakespeare as one, urging us to \\u201cpicture Shakespeare participating in the intellectual culture of Oxford\\u201d and asserting that \\u201cShakespeare is nearly certain to have taken in lectures and sermons in college chapels.\\u201d There is no hard evidence given for these claims. And having argued that Shakespeare had a study in New Place, the large house he purchased in Stratford, she can\\u2019t resist fantasizing that this is where he wrote his late plays: \\u201cHow many of his characters and episodes developed out of the scenes that unfolded on the streets below him as he wrote in the western light of the study window?\\u201d Her source? The gossip-hunting vicar of Stratford from the early 1660s, John Ward. Orlin\\u2019s meticulous handling of archival material fails her here, as her eagerness to encroach upon the London Shakespeare upends her usual accuracy. Ward never wrote that Shakespeare \\u201cin his elder days lived at Stratford, and supplied the stage with two plays every year.\\u201d He in fact jotted down two separate anecdotes, which Orlin then combines, linking them with a comma (those who are curious can consult a facsimile at the Folger Shakespeare Library\\u2019s site, \\u201cShakespeare Documented\\u201d). Orlin knows that late in his career Shakespeare collaborated with other dramatists, working with John Fletcher on his last three: \\u201cHenry VIII,\\u201d \\u201cThe Two Noble Kinsmen\\u201d and the lost \\u201cCardenio.\\u201d You don\\u2019t write plays with co-authors who live a three days\\u2019 ride away. These are unfortunate missteps in an otherwise impressive and valuable book, a biography that will lead many to revise their classroom lectures.\"]","href_hash":"ecd2dbc84c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ecd2dbc84c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}},
