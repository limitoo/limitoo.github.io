Ombudsman Deborah Glass finds the state's COVID border exemption scheme resulted in \"unjust outcomes\" for many people stranded outside the

\"The investigation by Ombudsman Deborah Glass, tabled in parliament on Tuesday, into decisions made under the Victorian Border Crossing Permit Directions, recommends the government publicly acknowledge the distress caused to affected people.\", \"Ms Glass launched an investigation in September\\u00a0into the Department of Health's handling of border restrictions, following a raft of complaints.\", \"Victoria closed its border with New South Wales on July 9, following Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton declaring all of New South Wales an \\\"extreme risk zone\\\".\", \"The closure\\u00a0left Victorians stranded across border lines, many of them denied exemptions despite being fully vaccinated and returning negative COVID tests.\", \"They included Castlemaine resident Marianne Allan, who was repeatedly denied an exemption to return to Victoria, despite multiple letters from her doctors stating she required medical treatment for her advanced pancreatic cancer at home.\", \"The investigation revealed that of the 33,252 exemption applications the Department of Health received between July 9\\u00a0and September 14, when the investigation started, only 8 per cent were granted.\", \"People complained to the Ombudsman after being refused exemptions to travel to Victoria to farewell loved ones at funerals, attend vital medical appointments, care for sick family members, return home to care for animals, or to start jobs.\", \"Some found themselves facing effective homelessness because they lived in Victoria and could not return.\", \"<img

felt caught up in a bureaucratic nightmare.(ABC News: Billy Draper)</div>\", \"Ms Glass said she did not criticise the decision to close the border,\\u00a0which was based on public health advice, but the narrow exercise of discretion.\", \"\\\"I recognise that the Department of Health's intentions were to protect people in Victoria from a dangerous virus that had already seeded through cross-border incursion and that the department was under enormous pressure dealing with the exigencies of the public health emergency.\", \"\\\"While we did not review all decisions and I do not suggest that all were unfair, the overwhelming majority of applications did not get to a decision-maker at all, and the guidance did not change even as case numbers in Victoria grew and the risks evolved.\\\"\", \"She said the\\u00a0consequences of that were \\\"vast\\u00a0and unfair\\\" for many thousands of people stuck across the border.\", \"\\\"There is no doubt the government provided explicit warnings to Victorian residents interstate.\", \"\\\"But people still reasonably relied on a traffic light system which previously would have seen them come home under strict conditions.\\\"\", \"She said even in a global health emergency, some people needed to cross state borders, and too many found themselves bereft.\", \"\\\"The effect of a complex and constrained bureaucracy meant some outcomes were downright unjust, even inhumane,\\\" Ms Glass said.\", \"\\\"People felt caught up in a bureaucratic nightmare.\", \"\\\"It appeared to me that the department put significant resources into keeping people out rather than helping them find safe ways to get home.\\\"\", \"The investigation found the team responsible for border exemptions was scaled up from 20 staff in early July to 285 by early September.\", \"However, those responsible for categorising and prioritising applications were expected to complete 50 per hour \\u2014 an average of almost one every 30 seconds.\", \"The evidence required to be granted an exemption was extensive, ranging from statutory declarations, proof of residence or ownership of animals, letters from doctors, and statements of relationship to people who were dying.\", \"The Ombudsman has also recommended the state government improve policy and guidance for such schemes and consider ex gratia payments on application to help cover the financial cost of not being able to travel home.\"]","href_hash":"27e4b9aa56eb11ec8b8e25c00da31604"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"27e4b9aa56eb11ec8b8e25c00da31604"}},
