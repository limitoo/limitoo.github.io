Attenborough says that to succeed, the bee \\\"must do whatever it takes.\\\" The bee picks up the scent of a female and starts digging.\", \"But very shortly after, other males join in and when the female appears, they crowd around in an attempt to steal her. \\\"As yet more join in, he risks being trapped at the center of the ball and cooked alive by their body heat,\\\" Attenborough says in the film.\", \"For this male, the competition proves too much and he leaves in search of another mate with fewer rivals. Eventually, he picks up a scent and he digs around trying to find her. They mate and he passes his sperm to her.\", \"To prevent other males attempting to mate with her, he starts his courtship and \\\"seduces her with a rasping call,\\\" Attenborough says. He also \\\"anoints her with his own scent.\\\"\", \"Wilson said it can take up to six months to film a sequence like this, including four weeks in the field. \\\"You need that time to allow for the things you can't control\\u2014weather/light /nuances in timings of the behavior, and it always takes a few weeks to get to understand our animal well enough to predict their behaviors.\", \"\\\"We work closely with scientific teams and use highly specialized camera operators in these macro situations, so it is through experience that we know where and when to target the behaviors\\u2014but there is a lot of failure on our part in order to get a good five-minute sequence.
