I was stunned. I heard someone moaning and I turned around and my director was falling backward and holding his upper body.\\u201d\", \"Then, she said, she turned and saw the film\\u2019s cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, sink down to the ground. Law enforcement officials have said that Ms. Hutchins, 42, was shot and killed, and the film\\u2019s director, Joel Souza, 48, was wounded, when the gun that Mr. Baldwin had been practicing with, which he had been told did not contain any live ammunition, discharged, firing a real bullet that struck them both.\", \"Ms. Mitchell, who said that she ran out of the wooden church set and used the phone in her hand to call 911, announced Wednesday that she had filed a lawsuit against the producers on the film, including Mr. Baldwin, and several members of its crew.\", \"\\u201cAlec Baldwin intentionally, without just cause or excuse, cocked and fired the loaded gun even though the upcoming scene to be filmed did not call for the cocking and firing of a firearm,\\u201d the lawsuit, which was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, said.\", \"\\u201cThe fact that live ammunition was allowed on a movie set, that guns and ammunition were left unattended, that the gun in question was handed to Mr. Baldwin by the assistant director who had no business doing so, the fact that safety bulletins were not promulgated or ignored, coupled with the fact that the scene in question did not call for a gun to be fired at all, makes this a case where injury or death was much more than just a possibility \\u2014 it was a likely result,\\u201d the lawsuit said.\", \"A lawyer for Mr. Baldwin did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\", \"The lawsuit was announced at a news conference with Ms. Mitchell\\u2019s lawyer, Gloria Allred.\", \"It claims assault, intentional infliction of emotional distress, and deliberate infliction of harm, and requested unspecified damages. It said Ms. Mitchell, who was standing less than four feet from Mr. Baldwin when the revolver discharged, \\u201csustained serious physical trauma and shock and injury to her nervous system and person\\u201d and \\u201cwill in the future be prevented from attending to her usual occupation as a script supervisor.\\u201d\", \"The shooting took place Oct. 21 on the set of the film on Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe County, N.M., as Mr. Baldwin prepared to film a close-up of him drawing a .45 revolver from a shoulder holster. According to Ms. Mitchell\\u2019s lawsuit, Mr. Baldwin failed to check the gun himself to see if it was loaded before handling it.\", \"They were preparing for three tight camera shots, according to the lawsuit: one of Mr. Baldwin\\u2019s eyes, one of a blood stain on his shoulder, and one of his \\u201ctorso as he reached his hand down to his holster and removed the gun.\\u201d\", \"According to court papers filed by the Santa Fe County Sheriff\\u2019s Department, the movie\\u2019s first assistant director, Dave Halls, had called out \\u201ccold gun\\u201d before handing the revolver to Mr. Baldwin, using a term indicating that the gun did not contain live ammunition. A lawyer for the movie\\u2019s armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, said that Ms. Gutierrez-Reed had loaded the revolver with what she believed to have been dummy rounds, which do not contain gunpowder and cannot be fired.\", \"The lawsuit charges that Mr. Baldwin knew that it was typical protocol for an armorer or prop master to hand a gun to the actor after demonstrating that it is empty \\u2014 not for the first assistant director to do so \\u2014 and that Mr. Baldwin failed to follow those rules. It also charges that Ms. Gutierrez-Reed allowed guns and ammunition to be left unattended on the set that day.

Ms. Zachry and a lawyer for Mr. Halls did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Mr. Bowles said he had not yet reviewed the lawsuit.\", \"Last week, Serge Svetnoy, the film\\u2019s gaffer, or chief lighting technician, filed a lawsuit accusing the movie\\u2019s producers, Mr. Baldwin and several other crew members of failing to follow appropriate firearm safety protocols that would have prevented the fatal shooting. Mr. Svetnoy said he was standing just six or seven feet away from Mr. Baldwin and said that he was injured by discharge materials from the gun and traumatized by seeing his friend die, trauma that had left him unable to work.\"]","href_hash":"293cac6a47f311ecbaa9b5742217f882"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"293cac6a47f311ecbaa9b5742217f882"}},
