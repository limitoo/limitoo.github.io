The video then shows Benbow crouching over the squealing pig while its body is pinned under the vehicle's front wheel, before making multiple attempts to stab the pig, piercing the skin, but not killing the animal immediately.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The way in which the pig was run over and stabbed several times is repulsive and inhumane,\\\" says SPCA chief executive Andrea Midgen. \\\"In the video, the animal can be heard squealing in pain while it's trapped under the vehicle, which would almost certainly have resulted in broken bones and would have caused a lot of unnecessary pain and distress.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We need everyone to understand that all animals are sentient beings - this means that they feel fear, pain and distress - and deliberately causing this is neither lawful or acceptable.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Benbow said the pig was a pest and it was damaging the paddocks when asked if he believed his actions were an acceptable method of hunting pigs.\", \"A veterinarian who viewed the video said the pig would likely have suffered broken bones and internal organ rupture due to being hit by the vehicle, resulting in major distress and pain. The multiple stab wounds would have also caused the animal significant suffering until its death. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"Whilst it isn't an offence under the Animal Welfare Act 1999 to hunt or kill a wild animal, it must be done humanely, and in line with generally accepted practice,\\\" Midgen said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"This method of hunting and killing was far from that, and this type of ill-treatment of animals - regardless of whether they're considered pests - will not be tolerated.\\\"\", \"The SPCA said they've noticed an increasing trend of animal abuse being filmed and posted on social media.\\u00a0\", \"They said such behaviour is unacceptable and where SPCA has evidence of a crime, prosecution will always be a consideration.\\u00a0 \\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"e9d5796a7ca611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e9d5796a7ca611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
