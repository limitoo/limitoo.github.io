parliament that will\\u00a0require\\u00a0social media companies to collect the details of all users.\", \"Courts will be allowed to force companies to hand over the identities of users to aid defamation cases, bringing\\u00a0order to the online \\\"Wild West\\\", the Prime Minister said on Sunday.\", \"But experts say\\u00a0the premise of the legislation\\u00a0is deeply flawed and won't curb rates of online bullying.\", \"So what evidence is there that stripping users of their\\u00a0anonymity makes them less\\u00a0aggressive to others online?\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Are anonymous accounts more aggressive?</div>\", \"Monash University's\\u00a0Emily van der Nagel is one of\\u00a0Australia's pre-eminent experts on online anonymity.\", \"When she heard the weekend's news about the\\u00a0proposed\\u00a0legislation, her first thought was, \\\"Not again\\\".\", \"\\\"We often hear these kinds of calls \\u2026\\u00a0equating anonymity with anti-social behaviour and harassment,\\\" she said.\", \"Earlier\\u00a0this year,\\u00a0England's footballers were subjected to sustained online abuse after losing the Euro final to Italy in a penalty shootout.\", \"<img

and Kalvin Phillips after missing a penalty against Italy.(Getty Images: Paul Ellis)</div>\", \"If anonymity was a factor in aggressive online behaviour, you would expect that abuse to have come from anonymous accounts.\", \"But research conducted by Twitter found this was not the case.\", \"Ninety-nine per cent of the accounts that were banned, for more than 1,600 tweets of abuse, were not anonymous.\", \"Blaming online anonymity for aggressive\\u00a0behaviour is \\\"a really fundamental\\u00a0misunderstanding of the dynamics of these systems,\\\" Dr van der Nagel said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">So why are people so aggressive online?</div>\", \"In 2018, the\\u00a0Queensland government\\u00a0engaged Dr van der Nagel\\u00a0to compile a research paper on the efficacy of\\u00a0requiring social media companies to implement identity verification.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/09f7f7af234601518bc9590a852ace75\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The government's plan to unmask online trolls</div>\", \"In her subsequent paper, Dr van der Nagel referred to a 2016 German laboratory experiment testing the effect of two variables, social norms and anonymity, on the online behaviour of 62 participants.\", \"The researchers\\u00a0found that\\u00a0aggressive social norms led to more aggressive language, but user anonymity\\u00a0had\\u00a0no direct effect.\", \"Social norms are set by many factors, including what's done or said by public figures, Dr Nagel said.\", \"Another factor is the design and history of the platform itself.\", \"What's popular on 4chan, for instance, is very different to what trends on Twitter, even though users on either\\u00a0can be anonymous.\", \"\\\"The way people join these spaces, they come in and the first thing they do is listen,\\\" Dr van der Nagel said.\", \"\\\"They get a sense of what the audience\\u00a0is and what other people are saying and what\\u00a0gets traction.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Is online anonymity ever helpful?</div>\", \"Daniel Angus, a professor of digital communication at Queensland University of Technology, was also sceptical of the proposed new rules.\", \"\\\"Many of us here at the Digital Media Research Centre research online harm every day of the week,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"In August, for instance, Facebook removed Coalition MP George Christensen's anti-lockdown speech for breaching its COVID misinformation policy.\", \"Australia would\\u00a0be going it alone with online identity verification, Professor Angus\\u00a0added.\", \"The only other country with comparable rules is China, which has the strictest controls on social media\\u00a0in the world.\", \"South Korea implemented a real-name verification system for popular internet platforms in 2007, but it was later ruled unconstitutional and a threat to liberties and\\u00a0political and social expression.\", \"So if the experts say the news rules won't help with online abuse, why is the government proposing them?\", \"\\\"They're putting it out there as a distraction,\\\" Professor Angus said.\", \"Few will rush to defend\\u00a0anonymous trolls and big tech corporations, even if the legislation is no good, he said.\", \"Dr van der Nagel suggested governments could be more helpful by pressuring platforms to improve the standard of online behaviour, including moderating hateful speech\\u00a0and adjusting\\u00a0algorithms to shape what types of posts are popular or what appears to trend.\", \"Governments could also make it easier for people to report online harassment and involve law enforcement, she said.\", \"A\\u00a0draft version of the online identity verification legislation will be released this week, and is expected to be introduced to parliament early next year.\", \"\\\"They can make these laws, but will they stick? Maybe not,\\\" Dr van der Nagel said.\", \"\\\"Are they trying to make the right laws? I don't think so.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"62121bf3514811ec93db91c1c45dc776"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"62121bf3514811ec93db91c1c45dc776"}},
