And that a number of factors affecting the market have occurred at the same time as the CCCFA changes, including increases to the OCR, LVR changes and an increase in house prices and local government rates.\\\"\", \"A broader review of the CCCFA is still under way.\", \"Auckland mortgage broker Bruce Patten from Loan Market said the changes were sensible and needed.\", \"\\\"It's good they've moved on it because it's been the biggest credit crunch since the GFC (global financial crisis) essentially .\\\"\", \"Patten said the changes were common sense such as not trawling through bank accounts looking at daily spending.\", \"\\\"They just need to take an average cost of living, look at what you're spending on your fixed expenses we don't need to know about your Netflix, we don't need to know that you go the cafe every morning for your morning tea we just need to look at your fixed expenses, everything else is adjustable.\\\"\", \"Lenders will be able to process applications more quickly, he said.\", \"\\\"The time it's taking us on average, and the banks, is probably six times as long as it was previously to go through three months worth of bank statements, itemise every item, decide whether it's a regular or a non-regular payment, then go back to the client to clarify it. It'll certainly get things moving.\\\"\", \"The rules had not only resulted in more applications being declined, but a huge number of people being able to borrow significantly less than previously, he said.\", \"Proposed initial changes to regulations and Responsible Lending Code agreed by Cabinet:\"]","href_hash":"cb55e2f0a17611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cb55e2f0a17611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
