He had pleaded guilty in 2019 to third-degree rape, attempted fist-degree sexual abuse and two counts of second degree sexual abuse, and faced a jail sentence of eight years.\", \"\\\"Incarceration [...] isn't appropriate,\\\" the judge ruled this week.\", \"\\\"I agonized. I'm not ashamed to say that I actually prayed over what is the appropriate sentence in this case because there was great pain. There was great harm. There were multiple crimes committed in the case,\\\" said the judge.\", \"Murphy told Belter that his sentence would be \\\"a sword hanging over your head for the next eight years.\\\" He didn't elaborate on why he didn't hand him jail time.\", \"One of the four victims, referred to as MM in court filings, told CBS News after the ruling that the judge's decision left her \\\"shaking with anger and disgust,\\\" and that she felt \\\"sick to her stomach.\\\"\", \"\\\"I completely broke down. It was as if I was being victimized all over again,\\\" the woman said, adding that she ran out of the courtroom to throw up after she heard Belter's sentence.\", \"MM warned that Belter could pose a threat to other women.\", \"\\\"It's just going to make him more comfortable doing this in the future,\\\" she added. \\\"This is a pattern. He will offend again.\\\"\", \"The 20-year-old's attorneys told the court that he is \\\"tremendously remorseful\\\" for his actions.\", \"MM was 16 when her rapist sexually abused her and three other teenage girls between February 2017 and August 2018 at his parents' home in an affluent neighborhood in Lewiston. Belter was also 16 when the assaults began.\", \"\\\"I don't believe it for one second,\\\" MM told CBS News. \\\"He was saying whatever it takes for him to get his best outcome and it worked. [...] I will have to live with this for the rest of my life, knowing that he's walking the streets and that another girl can be a victim of his any day now. It's terrifying.\\\"\", \"Steven M. Cohen, an attorney for one of Belter's victims, denounced Murphy's decision to hand the 20-year-old a probationary sentence.\", \"\\\"Justice was not done here,\\\" he told reporters on Tuesday.\", \"He told The Washington Post that his client was \\\"deeply disappointed\\\" in the outcome.\", \"\\\"My client threw up in the ladies room following the sentencing,\\\" Cohen said. \\\"If Chris Belter was not a White defendant from a rich and influential family, in my experience [...] he would surely have been sentenced to prison.\\\"\", \"MM added that the judge is putting her and Belter's other victims \\\"through hell.\\\"\", \"\\\"I don't think that any of the victims or myself will find that closure until we know that he's locked up, and the judge failed us there. He victimized us all over again,\\\" she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936210/christpher-belter-mug-shot.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Mug shot of Christopher Belter.
