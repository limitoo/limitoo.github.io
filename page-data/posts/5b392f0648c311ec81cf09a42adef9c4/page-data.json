Washington), named simply Man, arriving home and stripping off the smile he wears, of necessity, in the hostile world outside.\", \"It\\u2019s the expression he calculates, as a Black man, to signal that he\\u2019s both nonthreatening and educated enough not to be messed with. \\u201cThe Obama Deluxe,\\u201d he calls it.\", \"That little slam gets a big laugh. Only a few minutes in, humor is already a tension release in a show that will talk of suicide, slavery and the lethal force of racism in Black men\\u2019s lives throughout United States history. And Ra, like this show\\u2019s excellent cast of five, proves adept at lightning-quick switches between the crushing and the comical.\", \"Tormented by anxiety, depression and panic attacks, the isolated Man is struggling to carry on. Submission to the unseen, ever-present noose that hangs over him \\u2014 \\u201cEvery Black man\\u2019s boogeyman,\\u201d he calls it \\u2014 has begun to seem like a comfort.\", \"\\u201cSometimes it beckons me,\\u201d he says toward the end of that first scene, which, hearkening back to Baraka\\u2019s poem, Ra titles Volume 19. Volume 20 is this play\\u2019s other bookend. The longest of the three scenes \\u2014 the surreal and moving center, in which Man does not appear \\u2014 is Volume 1.\", \"In a handsome production by Christopher D. Betts, all of it takes place on a grassy expanse stretching into the distance, with a spiritual, \\u201cFare Ye Well,\\u201d as a solacing aural motif. (The set is by Emmie Finckel, the lighting by Emma Deane, the costumes by Jahise LeBouef and the sound by Kathy Ruvuna.)\", \"As the play shifts into Volume 1, the wary, eager Madison (Charles Browning) enters, looking for the caravan that will take him north to meet his wife. It is 1780, as far as he knows, and he is running from slavery, barefoot.\", \"But the first person he encounters is Lazarus (Victor Williams), a Tennessee sharecropper from 1892. Then a 1970s Black Panther named Hue (Biko Eisen-Martin) stumbles in, followed shortly after by Tony (Travis Raeburn), a young AIDS activist from the early 1990s. It takes most of them a while to figure out why they\\u2019re all gathered there, under that unseen noose, and how many eras have collided.\", \"\\u201cHold the phone,\\u201d an incredulous Hue says to Madison. \\u201cYou really a slave?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHold the what?\\u201d a baffled Madison replies.\", \"\\u201cIn the Southern Breeze\\u201d pays tender tribute to previous generations of Black Americans and bears unblinking witness to the white violence that has marred and menaced them. Hearkening back to that quote by Dr. King, it also acknowledges the progress toward justice through the ages.\", \"This play is a more formally ambitious, far-reaching work than \\u201cToo Heavy for Your Pocket,\\u201d with which Ra made his New York debut in 2017, when he was known as Jir\\u00e9h Breon Holder.\", \"What stumps him here, in Volume 20, is how to let his unnamed 21st-century Man reject existential exhaustion in a way that doesn\\u2019t seem pat. Like Antoinette Chinonye Nwandu\\u2019s \\u201cPass Over,\\u201d rewritten for its recent Broadway run to allow more space for joy, this play wants to illuminate an uplifting path out of pain. But its final section turns muddled and didactic, its poeticism forced.\", \"Finding hope, it turns out, is the tricky part.\"]","href_hash":"5b392f0648c311ec81cf09a42adef9c4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5b392f0648c311ec81cf09a42adef9c4"}},
