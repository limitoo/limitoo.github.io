scientists from the Australian National University\\u00a0and King's College in London, are based on a clinical trial that used heparin to treat 98 patients diagnosed with COVID-19.\", \"The trial\\u00a0found that breathing and oxygen levels improved in 70 per cent of the patients after they inhaled a course of heparin, and their symptoms improved.\", \"\\\"What we found was that this drug also works against COVID-19 by stopping the virus from entering the cells in the lungs,\\\" study co-author Professor\\u00a0Frank van Haren from the ANU said.\", \"The drug is now being rolled out to patients in hospital in 13 different countries, as part of a controlled trial.\", \"In Australia, as\\u00a0hospitals report record-breaking numbers of COVID-19 patients\\u00a0and some states

magic bullet,\\\" Professor Van Haren said.\", \"\\\"There is still an urgent need for an effective treatment of COVID-19 and the early results of our trials show inhaled heparin is safe and effective.\\\"\", \"Heparin has long been used as a blood-thinner to treat diseases of the heart, lungs and certain blood vessels.\", \"It is typically administered intravenously, but researchers have developed a way for it to be inhaled as a nebuliser to treat COVID-19.\", \"It also acts as a coagulant, giving it the added benefit of preventing blood clots \\u2014\\u00a0a known lung complication

from infecting cells \\u2014 essentially, stopping patients from getting sick.\", \"\\\"Inhaled heparin has antiviral properties which work by binding to the spike proteins the coronavirus uses to enter the cells of the body,\\\" Professor Page said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">A 'breakthrough' for low-income countries</div>\", \"As a relatively cheap drug that is already in use in hospitals,

already available in hospitals all over the world and it is a very inexpensive drug,\\\" Professor Van Haren said.\", \"\\\"Some of the treatments that have been developed for COVID are very
