Maybe just going to the Westfield mall or something, do a bit of window shopping again, that definitely hasn't been around for a while.\\\"\", \"Others were worried about easing restrictions given the rising case numbers - the city reached a new daily record of 200 cases on Saturday.\", \"Jackie Hokai was dealing with lockdown fatigue but understood the need for it.\", \"\\\"Pretty mixed, I'm happy because people will be able to go out shopping and it's good for business but on the other hand it could be just making things worse.\\\"\", \"A healthcare worker, she works with disabled people, and will continue to shop online if the malls re-open.\", \"\\\"I won't go out shopping, not to places where I don't need to go.
