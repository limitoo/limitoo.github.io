An awkward correction was required.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">A split Coalition</div>\", \"After spending last week declaring it was \\\"time for government to get out of our lives\\\", the Prime Minister could hardly complain about the five Coalition senators who crossed the floor to vote in favour of a One Nation move aimed at putting an end to vaccine mandates.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/2433c651c271cfe9a11e2bcc9575927b\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Pauline Hanson, appearing via video link, put forward a bill that prompted Coalition senators to break ranks.(ABC News: Tamara Penniket)</div>\", \"Of more concern was the threat from two\\u00a0of the renegade five to withhold their votes for all government legislation until the mandates were gone. The two senators \\u2014 Alex Antic and Gerard Rennick \\u2014 are both, notably, in their first term of parliament. Some of their colleagues suspect they haven't yet fully appreciated the importance of working as a team.\", \"Still, the threats have already worked to some degree. The Prime Minister gave ground yesterday on Rennick's demand to extend access to its COVID-19 vaccine injury compensation scheme for the few people who suffer adverse impacts from the jab.\", \"It prompted Labor taunts that government policy was now hostage to a vaccine sceptic. In return, Rennick has now promised to support the government on procedural votes, but he's making no guarantees on legislation.\", \"Plans to require voter ID at the coming election could bite the dust as a result.

Both moderates and conservatives have various concerns and noticed most of those who spoke in favour of the legislation during the meeting were Morrison supporters from the centre-right faction. It all looked a \\\"bit staged\\\", they suggested.\", \"The bill will go to a Senate inquiry. Few expect the differences over religious discrimination laws that have lingered for four years since the same-sex marriage debate will be resolved over the summer.\", \"Not that Labor has been highlighting the Coalition's internal woes on this one.
