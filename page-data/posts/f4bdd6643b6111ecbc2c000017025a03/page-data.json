Pepper Distillery, said. \\\"There are some obstacles and problems that we will need to deal with, as will everybody. But that's business.\\\"\", \"For Kentucky bourbon producers, sales to the EU plummeted by nearly 50 percent in 2020 alone, the Kentucky Distillers' Association said. The EU accounted for 56 percent of all Kentucky whiskey exports in 2017 \\u2014 the year before the tariffs hit \\u2014 but its share shrank to about 40 percent by 2020.\", \"In touting the agreement by President Joe Biden's administration to settle the trade dispute, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said \\\"this deal is good for Kentucky's workers and the iconic Kentucky bourbon industry.\\\"\", \"Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday that Raimondo \\\"went to bat\\\" for the state, pointing to their multiple conversations about how hard the EU tariff was hitting Kentucky's distilling sector.\", \"Tariffs amount to a tax, which producers could either absorb in reduced profits, or pass along to customers through higher prices \\u2014 and risk losing market share in competitive markets.\", \"Distillers will have to decide how much of their finite whiskey supplies will ship to Europe. They can't simply crank up production for immediate inventory bumps. Most bourbons typically age four to eight years before reaching market, getting their flavor and golden brown color during aging.\", \"That patience will be necessary for American distillers in winning back space on EU liquor shelves, Peay said. His Kentucky distillery's signature bourbon and rye brand is James E. Pepper 1776.\", \"\\\"It's not easy to repair the damage that's been done,\\\" he said, adding recovery will be complicated further by supply chain woes brought on by the pandemic. And there's still a lingering United Kingdom tariff on American whiskey owing to a separate trade dispute.\", \"Nonetheless, he predicted a European comeback for U.S. spirits in the next few years, adding, \\\"we are going to start seeing some serious mojo come back into Europe from the American whiskey space.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"f4bdd6643b6111ecbc2c000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f4bdd6643b6111ecbc2c000017025a03"}},
