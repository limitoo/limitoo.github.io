Tourism makes up around 40 per cent of Fiji's GDP.\", \"Prior to the pandemic, Mr Hill says, about 150,000 people were directly employed by the country's tourism industry.\", \"Post-pandemic, he says, that number was more like 20\\u201330,000.\", \"\\\"Unfortunately \\u2026 we don't have the sort of level of government support that Australia does,\\\" he says.\", \"\\\"A lot of people just had to

change as an \\\"existential threat\\\", with 70 per cent of the country's population living within 5 kilometres of the shoreline.\", \"Mr Hill says many of Fiji's resorts are working to reduce their carbon footprint, with some going entirely off-grid.\", \"\\\"Tourists are increasingly asking more questions of operators and wanting to find out, you know, what their credentials are in that space,\\\" he says.\", \"Mr Hill says tourists don't only want to know that they're not contributing to the problem \\u2014 they want to feel like they're a part of the solution.\", \"\\\"One of the things I think is fantastic with tourism is that you can absolutely involve tourists in that sustainability push,\\\" he says.\", \"He says the local tourism sector is undertaking programs in coral farming and marine life conservation.\", \"\\\"People coming to Fiji can participate in those kinds of activities and just help leave it a better place for generations to come, which I think is a really critical thing.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/8a63b4ccc99abb7801c7d372a7b5b943\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Emma

tourism operators doing \\\"exceptional things\\\".\", \"\\\"[There's] a lot of great work happening, for example, in protected ecosystems such as the Great Barrier Reef where they're engaging

generating 918 million metric tons of CO2 per year \\u2014 more than 2 per cent of global CO2 emissions.\", \"Passenger transport made up 85 per cent of that total.\", \"\\\"Transport is by far the biggest component of the emissions footprint for tourism,\\\" says Dr Whittlesea.\", \"But, she says, the industry is working to change that, with airlines and airports making \\\"ambitious\\\" attempts to reduce emissions.\", \"These include researching sustainable aviation fuels, as well as developing electric- and hydrogen-electric-powered aircraft.\", \"\\\"These are some of the really big things that could make really big changes to the emissions footprint,\\\" Dr Whittlesea says.\", \"However, she says, these programs are mostly industry-led.\", \"\\\"Without increasing regulatory and government support to help them transition, it's going to be a slow move.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Using tourism to drive wider change</div>\", \"Dr Whittlesea says there is already

as well as the economy\\\".\", \"\\\"I think there's a really big opportunity for the sector and the industry to really embrace some of the other emerging challenges and existing challenges that we have \\u2014 such as climate \\u2014 and actually start to embed those in plans and policies and really maximize the benefits of tourism,\\\" she says.\", \"Dr Whittlesea says tourism has a \\\"strong potential to be a vehicle for change\\\".\", \"She says the pandemic is not only an opportunity to transform tourism, but also a chance to \\\"think about how we can really utilise tourism as a vehicle to make changes in lots of other parts of our society\\\".\", \"But at the moment, while she is hopeful for such a transformation, she's not seeing much evidence of it.\", \"\\\"At the moment, the focus seems to be just getting back on track,\\\" she says.\", \"\\\"It would be good to see us getting back on track differently \\u2014 and better.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"bb3459003c1411ec855d000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bb3459003c1411ec855d000017025a03"}},
