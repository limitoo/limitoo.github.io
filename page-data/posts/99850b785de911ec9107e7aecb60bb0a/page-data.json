Upon searching his home in connection with the murders, police discovered millions of images and video recordings depicting his sexual abuse of bodies over the course of 12 years at two hospitals in southeast England.\", \"Fuller filmed his attacks of at least 102 bodies in mortuaries from the now-closed Kent and Sussex Hospital and the Tunbridge Wells Hospital. His stints as an electrician in both hospitals gave him access to the bodies while he evaded justice for the murders for decades.\", \"Some of the identified victims were children, while others were older than 85. Prosecutors said that Fuller also sexually assaulted the two women he killed, Wendy Knell and Caroline Pierce.\", \"He confessed last month during his trial to carrying out the murders.\", \"Katrina Frost, Caroline Pierce's mother, described her daughter's murder as \\\"truly horrific\\\" and something that continues to affect her now in an impact statement read to the court by a prosecutor, the BBC reported. She characterized Fuller as \\\"an animal\\\" who was able to go back to \\\"a normal life with his family\\\" after the killing, but her own family was \\\"never the same.\\\"\", \"\\\"I can never forget having to identify the badly-damaged body of my own daughter,\\\" Frost said in the statement. \\\"The images of seeing my daughter in that way, repeat over and over in my mind.
