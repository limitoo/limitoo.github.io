A proposal came on March 12, 2020, while the couple was vacationing in Paris.\", \"\\u201cWe spent the morning at the Louvre. After stopping by a boulangerie to pick up a very typical lunch of bread, cheese, and ros\\u00e9, we walked around the Tuileries Garden,\\u201d said Mr. Huck, who got down on one knee and told Mr. Atkins how much he loved him before popping the question. \\u201cThe wine gives you a little courage.
