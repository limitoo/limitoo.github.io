The manufacturer\\u2019s troubles have also hurt its customers who cannot easily buy planes from another producer. Boeing has just one main rival, Airbus, and that company has a long backlog of orders.\", \"American was expecting 13 new Dreamliners this winter, but Boeing has delayed deliveries of all of those planes. The manufacturer has said that the disruption to the production of 787 planes will cost it about $1 billion.\", \"Boeing had paused deliveries of the plane briefly last year and again in May as it worked with the Federal Aviation Administration to address the quality concerns. The company slowed production of the plane over the summer and suffered another setback in October, when a supplier to Boeing said that it had provided parts that were made with the wrong titanium alloy.\", \"\\u201cWe deeply regret the impact to our customers as we work through the process to resume deliveries of new 787s,\\u201d Boeing said in a statement.\", \"The Dreamliner is a wide-body plane with two aisles in the cabin, allowing the airlines to fly more passengers on longer flights. The delays have forced American to cancel plans\\u00a0to bring back flights to Edinburgh and Shannon, Ireland and seasonal flights to other destinations such as Dubrovnik, Croatia, and Prague, the airline said. American also said it would significantly reduce service to cities in Asia and Australia and delay plans to start nonstop flights from Seattle to Bangalore, India.\", \"\\u201cWithout these widebodies, we simply won\\u2019t be able to fly as much internationally as we had planned next summer or as we did in summer 2019,\\u201d Vasu Raja, the airline\\u2019s chief revenue officer, said in note to staff American that was made public in the securities filing.\", \"American said it also planned to redeploy all wide-body airplanes in its fleet to long-haul service, by not using them on shorter routes. The company has been using larger planes for popular shorter flights to the Caribbean, Mexico and South America. Over the summer, those planes will instead fly to destinations across the Atlantic Ocean, such as Barcelona, Spain, Lisbon, Portugal and Venice.\", \"Despite the delays, Mr. Raja said American was standing by the Boeing plane.\", \"\\u201cOur 787 aircraft are an important part of our fleet,\\u201d he said. \\u201cDespite this delay, we still have great confidence in the Dreamliner and continue to work with Boeing on when these planes can be ultimately delivered to us. In addition, Boeing has advised us that they will compensate American for their inability to deliver the aircraft.\\u201d\", \"While the Dreamliner has been dogged by delays, Boeing has been able to get the 737 Max back in the air, starting last November. That plane was grounded for nearly two years after two fatal crashes. Boeing has delivered about 200 Max planes since the regulators allowed it to fly again and new orders for the popular narrow-body jet, which has just one aisle, have been strong. On Tuesday, Boeing announced that 777 Partners, an investment firm, will increase an existing Max order by 30 jets.\"]","href_hash":"74e92d73591f11eca11b5db6e1401761"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"74e92d73591f11eca11b5db6e1401761"}},
