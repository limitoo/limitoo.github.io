Brnovich himself certified the state's election results in November 2020.\", \"Former Maricopa County Recorder Adrian Fontes said that Brnovich questioned him in early November, according to Arizona NPR station KNAU.

The report found no evidence that voter fraud affected the election's outcome.\", \"The audit's nearly $5.7 million in expenses were paid by five groups headed by Trump supporters seeking to delegitimize the election's results. The state Senate hired a group called Cyber Ninjas to conduct the audit even though the company had never conducted such an audit.
