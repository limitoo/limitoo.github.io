It was the first game James played following his one-game\\u00a0suspension\\u00a0over the altercation with Isaiah Stewart on Sunday.\\u00a0\", \"Both James and Stewart tried securing a position for a rebound \\u2014 but as Stewart pushed James, the Lakers player swung his arm, striking Stewart and bloodying his eye. James reached out his arm, but Stewart attempted to confront him, causing security, players and coaches to break up a potential fight.\\u00a0\", \"Both players were ejected from the game. Stewart was suspended for two games and James for one. The suspension was the first in James' 19-year career, CBS Sports reports.\\u00a0\", \"James later told reporters the altercation was an accident and called his suspension \\\"some bull****.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I hate to see that, what escalated after that,\\\" James told reporters on Wednesday, according to\\u00a0CBS Sports. \\\"I didn't think it warranted [a suspension].
