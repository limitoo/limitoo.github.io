companies that\\u00a0paid nil tax in 2019\\u201320, with service industries, transport and financial asset investing sectors badly impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns.\", \"The data comes as the ATO continues to battle large companies over unpaid taxes, with ATO deputy commissioner Rebecca Saint telling ABC News that 122 companies had assessments raised against them during the 2021 financial year, to the value of $3 billion.\", \"Of that, $2.5 billion is being disputed by 15 companies.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/4b12b3d5536c4f8169fa11d85f9cfa0f\\\"

said\\u00a0there was a slight increase in tax paid by large companies in 2019-20.\", \"Large companies paid a combined total of $57.2 billion, or about 65 per cent of all corporate income tax in 2019-20.\", \"Compared to 2018\\u201319, this represented a net increase of 59 entities (2.6 per cent) and an increase in tax payable of about $1.1 billion (2 per cent), driven largely by higher

Australian copper mine and its Swiss trader parent to calculate the price at which the mine sold its entire copper concentrate production were within an \\\"arm's length\\\" range.\", \"Earlier this year, the High Court dismissed a request for special leave by the ATO (to appeal the decision) in the Glencore case. It was a landmark victory for the commodity giant in its long-running battle with the ATO.\", \"Ms Saint said legal cases are costly for the ATO, noting the agency spent $10 million on the Chevron case alone.
