It is a cult of hate,\\\" Durr tweeted.\", \"In 2017 and 2018, Durr was found to have also described Democratic senator Robert Menendez as a \\\"pedophile\\\" and frequently downplayed the January 6 attack at the Capitol.\", \"\\\"Did anyone see video of cops opening doors and allowing 'so called Trumpers' to walk in? Also camera man already inside taking photos? Hmm? Setup? Durr posted on Facebook on January 9.\", \"In one Facebook post from September, Durr shared an image comparing the atrocities suffered by the Jewish people at the hands of the Nazis during World War II to mandates imposed during the pandemic with the caption: \\\"With every step toward tyranny, the further we are from freedom!\\\"\", \"Another post from January criticized Vice President Kamala Harris and suggested she was only sworn into office because of her race and gender.\", \"Neither Durr nor Sweeney has commented on the social media posts. Both candidates have been contacted for comment.\", \"Durr's victory was the latest troubling sign for the Democrats following Election Day results which saw Glenn Youngkin beat Terry McAuliffe in Virginia and New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy only just avoiding defeat to Republican challenger Jack Ciattarelli despite being the overwhelming polls favorite just a few weeks ago.\", \"Speaking to reporters after he was declared the winner, Durr claimed that his shock victory \\\"didn't happen because of me\\\" but voters' frustrations regarding COVID restrictions.\", \"He added: \\\"I'm nobody. I'm absolutely nobody. I'm just a simple guy. It was the people. It was a repudiation of the policies that have been forced down their throats.\\\"\", \"Incoming Republican Senate Leader Steve Oroho also said that Durr's election was more due to COVID-19 backlash than any real preference for either candidate.\", \"\\\"I don't really think it was Steve Sweeney,\\\" Oroho told the AP. \\\"I think it had to do with the message coming from people who were just annoyed at all the executive orders and all the mandates and being sick and tired of being told what they can and can't do.\\\"\", \"In a statement, Sweeney said he will not declare until all votes have been counted.\", \"\\\"The results from Tuesday's election continue to come in,\\\" Sweeney said.\", \"\\\"For instance, there were 12,000 ballots recently found in one county. While I am currently trailing in the race, we want to make sure every vote is counted. Our voters deserve that, and we will wait for the final results.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926795/edward-durr-social-media.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Edward Durr defeated Stephen Sweeney in New Jersey\\u2019s 3rd Legislative District in what was a major upset. </div>\"]","href_hash":"fd3f87673e1c11ec96873b80ac2763df"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fd3f87673e1c11ec96873b80ac2763df"}},
