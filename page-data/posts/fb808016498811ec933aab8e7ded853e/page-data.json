Six firefighters entered the house to search for casualties but when they entered, all they found was the cat unconscious inside.\", \"Once they were sure the residence was fully evacuated, the crews began working to save the feline. Although the cat was unconscious he was still breathing, according to a press release.\", \"Firefighter Joanne Grout was able to use specialist animal resuscitation equipment that was donated by the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA). The equipment used to save the cat's life was a specialist medical device that delivered oxygen to the cat with the use of a mask.\", \"Grout also administered oxygen to the animal for five minutes so that it would have a chance of survival.\", \"The crew at the scene decided to name the cat \\\"Lucky\\\" and he was transported to a local vet to receive immediate medical attention. He has since recovered and has been reunited with his family, the fire department said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936718/firefighters-rescue-cat.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A cat was rescued by firefighters after he was found unconscious in a house fire but was able to be resuscitated using equipment donated to the firefighters from the animal shelter. Not the actual cat that was rescued. </div>\", \"\\\"We were delighted to hand back one of the nine lives to the cat and ultimately that was made possible thanks to the kit donated by the RSPCA,\\\" Station Manager Trevor Sturrock, of Hebburn and South Shields Community Fire Stations said in a statement.\", \"\\\"Ultimately they are a charity and you can continue to help their vital work in saving the lives of animals by donating through their website. But for now, let's put our hands together and say a huge well done to our crews and FF Grout,\\\" Sturrock said.\", \"Earlier this week, an anonymous jogger was publicly thanked after he alerted a family about a house fire while they were out of town. The jogger utilized the family's Ring doorbell to tell them that there was a fire and they were able to give him the door code.\", \"The jogger quickly ran into the house and was able to save the family's two dachshunds, cat, and pet rabbit from the fire.\", \"Although all the animals were saved, the family's home suffered significant damage from the fire, including smoke damage as well as damage to their SUV, Christmas presents, and kitchen cabinets.\", \"Despite saving their pets, the family was never able to meet the anonymous hero because he left the scene. But they are hoping they find out who he was so they can tell him how thankful they are.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936891/cat-saved-specialty-equipment.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The equipment that was used to resuscitate the unconscious cat was donated by the RSPCA.
