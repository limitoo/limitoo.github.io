Newly restored, it is screening at Anthology Film Archives in Manhattan along with its precursor and a seldom-seen sequel \\u201cPictures From Life\\u2019s Other Side.\\u201d\", \"A counterculture love story cum screwball comedy, \\u201cMy Girlfriend\\u2019s Wedding\\u201d is mainly a portrait of McBride\\u2019s inamorata, a young Englishwoman named Clarissa Dalrymple(nee Ainley) with whom he shares an East Village pad. McBride shoots most of the movie on the day Clarissa secures her green card by marrying someone who is not McBride (his divorce isn\\u2019t yet final). The bridegroom, whom Clarissa has only just met, is a self-identified Yippie, happy to confound the system.\", \"Life imitates art. \\u201cMy Girlfriend\\u2019s Wedding\\u201d often seems to satirize McBride\\u2019s original satire, as when, interviewing Clarissa, he directs her to hold up a mirror, thus revealing the camera that is recording her. The difference between the two movies is that, unlike David Holzman\\u2019s girlfriend, who was alienated by filming process, Clarissa is cheerfully complicit in her objectification. She first appears wrapped in a bedcover.\", \"Although \\u201cMy Girlfriend\\u2019s Wedding\\u201d was dismissed as tedious when it opened in New York at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1973, Clarissa is anything but boring. Later becoming an influential art curator, she is less garrulous than one of Andy Warhol\\u2019s superstars or the subject of Shirley Clarke\\u2019s \\u201cPortrait of Jason.\\u201d Even so, she seems quite comfortable living the movie of her life, discussing the two children she had out of wedlock, cursing her father (and reading a letter he sent her), and obscurely ruminating on \\u201cthe revolution.\\u201d\", \"Adding an extra complication, Clarissa, who recently had an abortion, may or may not be pregnant again. She is, however, perfectly composed, appearing in a demure white minidress to be married in the Manhattan Municipal Building. After the ceremony, the newlyweds have lunch where Clarissa obsesses about being late for a new job (waiting tables at Caf\\u00e9 Figaro), as her husband questions the whole notion of work and holds forth even less coherently on revolutionary politics.\", \"\\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t seem to be a movie I\\u2019m making anymore,\\u201d McBride complains that evening. \\u201cLet\\u2019s not film.\\u201d Just when it seems that \\u201cMy Girlfriend\\u2019s Wedding\\u201d might end, like \\u201cDavid Holzman\\u2019s Diary\\u201d with an on-camera breakdown, the movie cuts to a title: \\u201cFour Days Later We Leave for San Francisco.\\u201d What follows is a hyperkinetic road movie accompanied by Al Kooper\\u2019s strident declaration \\u201cI Can\\u2019t Quit Her.\\u201d\", \"If not exactly a happy ending, it\\u2019s a good deal happier than the \\u201cDiary\\u201d denouement. As much as anything, \\u201cMy Girlfriend\\u2019s Wedding\\u201d globalizes a quotation attributed to the screenwriter Bob Schneider: Love is when two people who care for each other get confused.\"]","href_hash":"16efbe825def11ecae720b11cf4e2e1f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"16efbe825def11ecae720b11cf4e2e1f"}},
