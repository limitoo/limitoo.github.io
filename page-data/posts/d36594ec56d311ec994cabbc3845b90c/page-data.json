Dozens of counties and cities, including New York City, have also imposed vaccine requirements on those kinds of workers. But these mandates have largely left private-sector employers untouched.\", \"Under New York City\\u2019s new mandate for private employers, employees who work in-person at private companies must have one dose of the vaccine by Dec. 27. Remote workers will not be required to get the vaccine. There is no testing option as an alternative.\", \"At the federal level, the Biden administration\\u2019s mandates for government employees and the military are in effect, but those covering private employers are tied up in court.\", \"The Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued an \\u201cemergency\\u201d rule in November requiring vaccination or weekly testing for most employees of companies with at least 100 workers, but the rule was stayed last month by a federal court, putting enforcement on hold. Similarly, a nationwide mandate covering most health care workers was recently blocked when a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction.\", \"In general, under federal law, private employers can act on their own to require their workers to be vaccinated, and some major companies have done so, with apparent success. United Airlines, which requires its 67,000 U.S. employees to be vaccinated, said in September that more than 99 percent had complied. Tyson Foods said in October that more than 96 percent of its workers had their shots, up from less than half before the company announced its mandate in August.\", \"A survey of employers last month found that more than half of respondents either already required employees to be vaccinated or planned to do so. The survey, conducted by Willis Towers Watson, a consulting firm, found that just three percent of respondents with vaccine mandates had seen a spike in staff resignations.\", \"Some state governments, though, have adopted laws or issued orders forbidding employers from requiring workers to show proof of vaccination against the coronavirus.\", \"Even so, labor experts say that workplace vaccination requirements are crucial, both to stop the spread of the virus and to encourage more people to return to the labor force.\", \"\\u201cEmployers are having a hard time getting workers, because workers don\\u2019t want to jeopardize their safety and their health,\\u201d said Debbie Berkowitz, a former chief of staff at OSHA.\", \"Still, many businesses are reluctant to enforce their own vaccine requirements.\", \"\\u201cEmployers are hesitant to mandate vaccines, particularly in areas where there is a lot of hesitancy and where vaccines have been politicized,\\u201d Ms. Gee said.\", \"With employers worried about alienating customers or workers, and federal efforts tied up in litigation, she said, it is up to local governments to step in with vaccine mandates for private workplaces.\", \"\\u201cIt is in cities\\u2019 self-interest to do this,\\u201d Ms. Gee said.\"]","href_hash":"d36594ec56d311ec994cabbc3845b90c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d36594ec56d311ec994cabbc3845b90c"}},
