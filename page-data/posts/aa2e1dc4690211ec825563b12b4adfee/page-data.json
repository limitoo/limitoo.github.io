He's also served as captain in each.\", \"He'll carry his bat as New Zealand's leading run-scorer in tests (currently 7584 runs) and ODIs (8581 runs), where he's currently ranked fourth on international cricket's all-time list.\", \"Just the second Blackcaps player of Samoan descent, Taylor scored a test career-best 290 against Australia at Perth in 2015, then added a third double century to his tally with 200 against Bangladesh in 2019.\\n\", \"Taylor was widely expected to step away from the game after his match-winning hand in the Blackcaps' World Test Championship final win over India in June, where his unbeaten 47 in a 97-run stand with captain Kane Williamson steered New Zealand to victory.\", \"He missed out on selection for the Twenty20 World Cup in the UAE in October, then struggled for form during the two-test series against India which followed, scoring a total of 20 runs in his four innings. He's only passed 50 three times in his past 24 innings, which is the longest century-less stretch of his career.\", \"Earlier this month, coach Gary Stead hinted Taylor's time may be nearing an end, with the burgeoning talents of the likes of Devon Conway and Will Young waiting in the wings.\", \"The first stop on Taylor's farewell tour will be the first test against Bangladesh in Tauranga, which starts on January 1.\", \"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"aa2e1dc4690211ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"aa2e1dc4690211ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
