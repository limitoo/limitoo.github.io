He found the encounter eye-opening. \\u201cIt made me realize that not everybody skis 20 or 30 days a year, but they are no less passionate about the sport,\\u201d he said in a recent video chat. \\u201cThey\\u2019re the silent majority of skiers who aren\\u2019t being served by any pass, and they pay through the nose for day tickets.\\u201d\", \"At lunch with Red Lodge\\u2019s general manager, he made a proposal. A new, inexpensive pass targeted at people like his chairlift mates.\", \"Mr. Fish\\u2019s Indy Pass launched in September 2019. A mere $199 bought you two days at each of 34 participating resorts \\u2014 and yes, Red Lodge was one of them. The pass now has 80 ski hill members. True to the pass\\u2019s umbrella name, they are small to midsize, and many are owner-operated. There are impressive clusters in the Northeast and the Midwest, with Michigan, for example, boasting six Indy mountains. There are none, so far, in Colorado. The cost has increased, too, but at a slower pace: The 2021-22 preseason price, valid until Nov. 30, is $299 with some blackout days or $399 without. That\\u2019s still far cheaper than either the Epic or Ikon passes, which run more than $800.\", \"Andy Brown, 50, was an early Indy adopter from Rockland County, in New York, and for him savings were a big incentive. \\u201cI knew a few of the hills on the pass, like Catamount, so I knew I would like skiing there,\\u201d he said in a telephone interview, referring to a Berkshires resort. \\u201cAnd I ski with my kids, so having something affordable makes a big difference when you have to buy passes for multiple people.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Brown does mostly day trips, visiting resorts within a three-hour drive from his home. He is exactly the type of skier Mr. Fish had in mind when he created Indy. \\u201cOur model is, if you can get two to four days and sleep in your own bed, plus a weekend getaway or two, the pass is a great value,\\u201d Mr. Fish said.\", \"Mr. Fish won\\u2019t reveal how many passes have been sold, but there were 8,500 lift-ticket redemptions across the Indy system during the inaugural 2019-20 season, and they grew to 96,000 last year. He projects between 300,000 and 400,000 redemptions for 2021-22.\", \"The growth can be explained in part by last season\\u2019s Covid-19 restrictions making travel harder and forcing many skiers to patronize mountains near home.\", \"In any given market, the Indy resorts are likely to be the smaller, scrappier alternative, and most are not as big as their fancier brethren (though Utah\\u2019s Powder Mountain does spread to a whopping 8,464 acres). In Idaho, Sun Valley (18 lifts and refined amenities) is part of the Epic pass system, while Brundage Mountain (6 lifts and a reputation for great snow) is part of Indy. \\u201cI think a lot of the Indy Pass resorts have that cool, laid-back skiing vibe that you remember from when you were a kid,\\u201d said Ken Rider, Brundage\\u2019s general manager.\", \"Unless you are a local, you may not have heard of the three California resorts on the Indy Pass (China Peak, Mt. Shasta and Snow Valley) or the six in Vermont (including Jay Peak and Magic Mountain). But that\\u2019s exactly how Indy folks like it, happy to avoid the weekend lines frequent at Vermont crowd-pleasers like Killington (Ikon) and Stowe (Epic).\", \"The same applies to the six New York resorts on the Indy Pass \\u2014 Catamount, Greek Peak, Snow Ridge, Swain, Titus and West Mountain \\u2014 which do not come close to Hunter (Epic) or Windham (Ikon) when it comes to the number of skier visits.\", \"But many Indy Pass buyers are seeking the joys of intimate resorts, especially as crowds and sticker shock for everything from gear rental to parking to food have grown at the more famous properties.\", \"\\u201cMy husband and I love Indy resorts because we just want to ski,\\u201d said Mary Nitschke, 32, from Norfolk, Mass., in an email. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t care about fancy lodges and perfect grooming, and really dislike long lift lines and crowded trails. It feels great to support the smaller mountains where a lot of people are able to start skiing for a more affordable cost.\\u201d\", \"Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.
