They are very strict: for example, a single person working full-time on minimum wage earns significantly more than the cut-off for receiving legal aid. \\u00a0\", \"Fewer than one in ten people in Aotearoa qualify for legal aid, according to an RNZ analysis. \\u00a0\", \"If you earn more than this amount and need legal services, you\\u2019ll have to pay for it. Even a relatively common case, such as an employment dispute, can cost thousands of dollars \\u2013 money which simply isn\\u2019t available to many people. \\u00a0\", \"If you\\u2019re in desperate need of legal services, pro bono is sometimes the only option available without going into debt. \\u00a0\", \"The rules are set out in section 9 of the Lawyers and Conveyancers\\u00a0Act 2006. \\u00a0\", \"While any lawyer can\\u00a0do pro bono work, it comes with restrictions: you can only volunteer your pro bono services at Community Law Centres or the Citizens\\u2019 Advice Bureau. If you\\u2019re employed by a law firm, or in-house at a company or public sector entity, you can\\u2019t take on pro bono work unless it\\u2019s through one of those organisations. \\u00a0\", \"On the other hand, if you\\u2019re self-employed \\u2013 a barrister, for example, or a partner at a law firm \\u2013 you can take on any pro bono case you choose. \\u00a0\", \"To protect the public. All legal services come with risk: your lawyer might offer you bad advice, and if this happens, you might have the right to recourse. \\u00a0\", \"Law firms have indemnity insurance to cover these situations, and lawyers who are self-employed have to gain qualifications to show they\\u2019re sufficiently skilled and experienced to practice on their own.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cThe idea is that, to safeguard the public and the reputation of the profession, you need a certain level of experience, and you need to demonstrate to the regulator that you\\u2019re an appropriate person to be taking on legal work essentially independently,\\u201d Darryn Aitchison says. \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Chris Bishop\\u2019s proposed amendment would mean lawyers who are employed could carry out pro bono work of their choice, with their employer\\u2019s agreement. \\u00a0\", \"Some submitters felt the bill didn\\u2019t define \\u2018pro bono\\u2019 tightly enough and wanted it to be refined to focus on people or cases which clearly demonstrated unmet legal need.\\u00a0\", \"There were also concerns around quality controls: some submitters feared situations where junior lawyers gave clients bad advice, but weren\\u2019t covered by professional indemnity insurance.\\u00a0\", \"The final select committee report said while the bill addressed a serious shortcoming in access to justice, and was grateful to Bishop for raising the issue, further policy work would be needed to establish the scope of the problem. It said while the bill itself had the potential to increase access to justice, some of its shortcomings and the amount of policy work required to get it up to scratch would outweigh the potential benefits.\\u00a0\", \"\\u00a0\", \"Follow\\u00a0The Detail\\u00a0on\\u00a0Apple Podcasts\\u00a0,\\u00a0Spotify,\\u00a0Stitcher,\\u00a0iHeart,\\u00a0Google Podcasts\\u00a0or wherever you listen to your podcasts.\\u00a0\", \"You can also stay up-to-date by liking us on\\u00a0Facebook\\u00a0or following us on\\u00a0Twitter.\\u00a0\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/271518/eight_col_high_RNZ-PIJ-LOGO-Footer.jpg?1629074696\\\" alt=\\\"PIJF\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPIJF \\nPhoto: .\\n</div>\"]","href_hash":"1873fb2faae311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1873fb2faae311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
