It's not clear how the FBI reached this conclusion since all the hijackers died in the attack.\", \"The documents were the latest materials to be released under an executive order from President Joe Biden aimed at making public long-classified investigative reports related to the attacks. A separate investigative document was released on the 20th anniversary of the attacks in September.

In its final summary of the investigation, the FBI described al-Jarrah as a \\\"controlling, guiding, and directing influence on all aspects of Sunni extremist activity in Southern California.\\\"\", \"Maloney, the plaintiffs' lawyer, said those allegations are significant.\", \"\\\"Here we now have for the first time the FBI telling the world that Jarrah was an extremist, and he was bringing in Sunni extremist imams into the United States and then supervising them,\\\" he said.\", \"But authorities had insufficient evidence that al-Jarrah, al-Bayoumi and a third man \\u2014 Fahad al-Thumairy, who was an accredited diplomat at the Saudi Consulate in Los Angeles and who investigators say led an extremist faction at his mosque \\u2014 had conspired wittingly to assist the hijackers.\", \"None of the three was charged, and all have since left the country.\", \"The Trump administration fought to keep al-Jarrah's identity private before the Justice Department accidentally released it last year in a court filing.\", \"In a Sept. 8, 2021, memo, the FBI corrected a previous assertion it made and said there was no evidence to prove that al-Jarrah had any personal contact directly with the two hijackers who were the focus of the investigation.\", \"The documents also show that investigators repeatedly re-interviewed Mohdar Abdullah, a Yemeni student who befriended hijackers al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar when they settled in San Diego.
