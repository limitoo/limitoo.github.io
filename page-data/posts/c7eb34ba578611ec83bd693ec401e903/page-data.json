The verdict, after months of skepticism about the team\\u2019s viability and questions from the ice hockey federation\\u2019s head about the value of having it in the Olympic field, allows China to sidestep a blow to its pride but will have little effect on the chase for medals in Beijing.\", \"The Chinese team, which is ranked 32nd in the world, will meet Canada, Germany and the United States in group play, making it exceedingly unlikely that it will advance. But host countries regularly enjoy the privilege of participating in every sport, and China\\u2019s potential exclusion from one of the most popular events of the Winter Games had threatened to blemish the athletic r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 that the country has been painstakingly building.\", \"Although China has transformed itself into a power at the Summer Games \\u2014 it finished second in the medal count at the Tokyo Olympics this year \\u2014 its proficiency in winter team sports is less sterling. And whatever limited ambitions China might have had in men\\u2019s hockey dimmed in September, when the N.H.L. said it would allow its players to participate in Beijing, clearing the way for China\\u2019s group-stage opponents to stock their rosters with much of the world\\u2019s finest talent.\", \"Tuesday\\u2019s announcement also extinguished any remaining prospects that Norway, ranked No. 11 in the world, would enter the tournament as China\\u2019s replacement.\", \"It might also, at last, end months of waffling by hockey leaders, who said in November that China would compete in the Olympics \\u2014 and then almost immediately signaled that the team\\u2019s standing was still tenuous.\", \"Luc Tardif, the ice hockey governing body\\u2019s new president, had repeatedly voiced concerns about whether China would be able to keep pace with its opponents in Beijing.\", \"\\u201cWatching a team being beaten, 15-0, is not good for anyone, not for China or for ice hockey,\\u201d Tardif told Agence France-Presse in September.\", \"But Tardif appeared to back off in November, releasing a statement that said, \\u201cTo be clear, the I.I.H.F. is not going to remove the Chinese team from the Olympic Games.\\u201d At the time, Tardif said the federation would work alongside Chinese officials as \\u201cthey work towards preparing their team.\\u201d\", \"He also said that \\u201ca joint effort to evaluate the status of the team\\u2019s preparations\\u201d would take place during two games of Kunlun Red Star, a Chinese team in Russia\\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League stocked with many of the players who were expected to compete for China at the Games.\", \"Kunlun Red Star lost the first game, 5-4, in overtime and then dropped the second, 4-1. By then, Tardif had started reviving worries about the Chinese team\\u2019s prospects.\", \"The federation did not detail how, or why, it reached its conclusion this week that China would be allowed to compete, saying little more than that officials had \\u201cdiscussed the status of the Chinese men\\u2019s ice hockey team.\\u201d\", \"Much of China\\u2019s trouble can be traced to its strict rules on dual nationality, which other countries use to bolster their teams in hockey and other sports. China\\u2019s refusal to recognize dual citizenship and its requirements for naturalized athletes born abroad to compete under its flag have long limited its ability to construct rosters.\", \"China\\u2019s women\\u2019s hockey team also remains on course to compete in the Beijing Games. That team is ranked 20th in the world.\"]","href_hash":"c7eb34ba578611ec83bd693ec401e903"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c7eb34ba578611ec83bd693ec401e903"}},
