The case was taken under advisement by the high court and will be ruled upon at a later date.\", \"Officers' attorneys argue that the cops had a First Amendment right to attend a political rally. Releasing their names could subject them to potential violence and harassment, the officers' lawyers said.\", \"However, Sam Sueoka, who filed a public records act request for the city's Office of Police Accountability investigation into the officer's activities on Jan. 6, has lawyers that said the public has a right to know who the officers are.\", \"Chief Justice Steven Gonzalez and Justice Raquel Montoya-Lewis asked the lawyers if maintaining privacy rights should be expected after attending the highly publicized rally.\", \"\\\"The question is if you go to a public event where there's press and the president is there and there is widespread national discussion about this event, how is participation in that event an intimate aspect of life?\\\" Montoya-Lewis asked.\", \"Six Seattle officers attended former President Donald Trump's \\\"Stop the Steal\\\" rally in Washington, D.C.
