Companies of 100 or more employees have until Jan. 4 to ensure all their workers are either fully vaccinated or submit to weekly testing and mandatory masking. The measure was announced by President Biden in September, and details were released on Nov. 4 by the Labor Department\\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Some employers have already stepped forward to establish their own vaccine mandates, but many had been waiting for federal guidance. OSHA\\u2019s rule will affect some 84 million private sector workers across the country, including some 31 million who were believed to be unvaccinated.\", \"Here are answers to some of the most commonly asked questions about what OSHA\\u2019s rule means for American workers and their employers.\", \"Private companies of 100 or more employees must require their workers to be fully vaccinated by Jan. 4 or submit to weekly coronavirus testing and mask-wearing while in the workplace. The deadline for employers to enforce the mask mandate is Dec. 5.\", \"OSHA is expecting that the vast majority of workplaces will comply with its rule, but it will investigate complaints that workers raise. The agency has a whistle-blower system that allows workers to report any possible violations at their workplaces. The agency has tended to be short-staffed on inspectors, labor lawyers said, but it is likely to make enforcement of the rule a high priority.\", \"Companies that fail to comply with the rule may be subject to fines, according to an administration official. OSHA\\u2019s penalties are up to $13,653 per serious violation.\", \"Any employer with 100 or more workers will be required to adhere to the rule. Some smaller businesses have voluntarily issued their own mandates for either coronavirus vaccines or weekly testing. A Gallagher survey of more than 500 businesses released in early November found that the number of employers requiring vaccinations had doubled since August, to 17 percent from 8 percent of its survey respondents.\", \"OSHA is currently considering whether to extend the rule to employers with fewer than 100 workers.\", \"All employees, including those working part time, count toward the threshold. Independent contractors do not.\", \"Tele-workers and people who work exclusively outdoors will not be required to be vaccinated or submit to weekly testing because OSHA\\u2019s rule is focused specifically on ensuring people\\u2019s protection against the coronavirus in the workplace. Employees who work part of the time in the office and the rest of the time remotely are required to follow the rule.\", \"Workers can get any vaccine listed for emergency use by the World Health Organization, which includes two doses of Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech and one dose of Johnson & Johnson.\", \"Employers are required to give two kinds of exemptions to the vaccine mandates: medical and religious. Exemptions for people with certain medical conditions are protected under the Americans with Disabilities Act. Many employers require people to present a doctor\\u2019s note to qualify for this exemption. Exemptions for people with sincerely held religious beliefs are protected under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. So far, no major religion has banned its members from taking the coronavirus vaccine.\", \"It will be up to employers to determine whether workers can opt out of getting vaccinated by submitting to coronavirus testing. If workers opt to be tested weekly instead of being vaccinated, they must also be masked in the workplace. OSHA does not require employers to pay for or provide tests, given that the vaccine is free and highly effective, but businesses may be required to pay under collective bargaining agreements or local laws.\", \"Employers have to provide paid time off for their workers to get vaccinated, up to four hours, as well as sick leave for them to recover from side effects. They\\u2019re required to provide this leave starting Dec. 5.\", \"Employers are expected to keep documentation of their workers\\u2019 vaccination status, such as a copy of their vaccination cards or a signed and dated employee attestation.\", \"The religious and medical exemptions will come into play here \\u2014 but when it comes to people who do not have exemptions, employers are generally free to discipline people who don\\u2019t follow their rules. They may face pushback, though, under collective bargaining agreements.\", \"Employers need to act quickly: The deadline for workers to be fully vaccinated is Jan. 4. With many retail and logistics companies understaffed and overburdened, the January deadline will make it easier for them to face the holiday season.\", \"The Occupational Safety and Health Act gives OSHA authority to respond quickly to emergency situations when workers are confronted with grave threats. Because of the serious threat posed by the pandemic, the agency has issued an emergency temporary standard allowing it to put in place this new rule. Labor lawyers say this is within OSHA\\u2019s legal authority. Still, the rule is likely to face challenges, and dozens of attorneys general have already threatened to sue.\", \"\\u201cThe pushback is going to be on the question of, \\u2018Is this an occupational hazard?\\u2019\\u201d said Doug Brayley, an employment lawyer at the law firm Ropes & Gray. \\u201cWhen you\\u2019ve got a virus circulating everywhere, is it within OSHA\\u2019s authority to regulate it as an occupational health matter? I think OSHA will prevail, but I\\u2019m not certain.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"09da1c463d8e11eca20e000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"09da1c463d8e11eca20e000017025a03"}},
