They also tried to sideline the team captain, Kim Eun-jung, after learning of her plans to start a family.\", \"\\u201cTo be honest, I\\u2019m not completely sure if we\\u2019re over this yet,\\u201d Kim Kyeong-ae, a team member, wrote in an email to The New York Times as she prepared for the Beijing Winter Olympics this month.\", \"While some of South Korea\\u2019s top athletes have grown used to decades of harsh training and abuse, a younger generation has started to push back, inspired at least in part by the Garlic Girls.\", \"Their news conference helped revive painful discussions about the mistreatment of athletes in South Korea, where nepotism, exploitation and misconduct have been common for decades. Elite sports in the country are notoriously hierarchical, with men often on top and athletes told not to question orders.\", \"In 2008, the government\\u2019s National Human Rights Commission said nearly 80 percent of student athletes in middle and high schools had been subjected to physical and verbal abuse from their coaches and older teammates.\", \"After the Garlic Girls spoke out, there was an outpouring of other accounts of abuse, including from Shim Suk-hee, a member of South Korea\\u2019s national short-track speedskating team and a two-time Olympic gold medalist, who said she had been repeatedly raped by her former coach. (Last year he was sentenced to 10 years in prison.)\", \"Several female athletes in judo, taekwondo and wrestling also came forward to accuse their male coaches of sexual abuse.\", \"In February 2019, after an investigation, the government said that most of the allegations made by the Garlic Girls were true. The two coaches and Kim Kyung-doo, the curling official, were banned from the sport for life.\", \"And for the first time ever, South Korea appointed three foreign coaches to lead the women\\u2019s, men\\u2019s and mixed double curling teams at the Olympics. The Garlic Girls are set to compete against Canada in Beijing on Thursday in a round-robin match.\", \"\\u201cAlthough we can\\u2019t know of and change all the corruption in the sporting world, at least in this sport we can reveal what has been going on in the hopes that it won\\u2019t happen again,\\u201d wrote Kim Kyeong-ae, 28, in her email.\", \"But those who speak out risk being sidelined or criticized. Coaches have immense control over their athletes, who are recruited at a young age and live in dormitories. Many of them are taken out of school and feel they have no career options if they fail.\", \"Oh Ji-hoon, a former speedskater who has trained in both the United States and South Korea, said that Korean athletes typically don\\u2019t question their coaches\\u2019 methods of discipline and training because they get used to it from a young age.\", \"\\u201cIn Korea, training programs are way more intense than those of the U.S.,\\u201d Mr. Oh said. \\u201cThere is less leeway, much less flexibility and, candidly, it\\u2019s fairly common for coaches to yell at skaters.\\u201d\", \"After the curling team went public with their accusations, Peter Gallant, a Canadian coach who guided them to their silver medal at the 2018 Winter Olympics, publicly backed the players.\", \"Mr. Gallant is now the team\\u2019s head coach, and curling experts say his experience is likely to propel the Garlic Girls to greater heights. The team adores him, referring to him as \\u201cAppa,\\u201d or father in Korean. In an email, Mr. Gallant noted that the level of respect the curlers have for those who are older than them is so high that \\u201cnothing is really questioned\\u201d during practice.\", \"That is not necessarily good. \\u201cA coach wants his athletes to ask questions,\\u201d he added.\", \"Four of the five Garlic Girls come from Uiseong, a farming community and a seemingly unlikely site for a sporting revolution. The rural town of 53,000 people uses a cartoon garlic bulb as the county mascot.\", \"The Garlic Girls have said their previous coaches often made them feel ashamed for not coming from a major city. \\u201cIt\\u2019s useless training people from the countryside,\\u201d they recalled being told.\", \"Uiseong, however, is home to one of South Korea\\u2019s first curling facilities, built in 2006 after a former government official saw the sport on a trip to Canada.\", \"Kim Eun-jung, the captain, and currently ranked seventh in the world, fell in love with the sport after trying it during gym class in middle school. She encouraged her classmate Kim Yeong-mi to join, who was followed by her younger sister, Kim Kyeong-ae.\", \"Kim Cho-hi, the only team member not from Uiseong, also started curling in middle school, but in Gyeonggi Province, just outside of Seoul.\", \"Because they all have the same surname, the Garlic Girls are also known as Team Kim. To differentiate themselves, each chose a nickname honoring their favorite breakfast food. Ms. Kim Eun-jung is \\u201cAnnie,\\u201d the name of a yogurt brand. Kim Yeong-mi is \\u201cPancake,\\u201d while her sister, Kyeong-ae, is \\u201cSteak.\\u201d Kim Cho-hi is \\u201cChoCho,\\u201d a nod to chocolate cookies, which she loves to eat for breakfast. Kim Seon-yeong is \\u201cSunny,\\u201d for sunny-side-up eggs.\", \"The team was an underdog going into the 2018 Winter Olympics, but pulled off upsets against Canada and Switzerland, two curling powerhouses. Almost overnight, the Garlic Girls became a sensation in a country that knew little about curling.\", \"In the past two years, the pandemic has made practice challenging. Several competitions were canceled. And unlike teams from countries where curling has long been popular, the Garlic Girls often must travel abroad for competitions and training, which has meant dealing with quarantines and spending more time away from home.\", \"But Mr. Gallant said the team\\u2019s experience with their previous coaches prepared them for the future, even with the pandemic. In an interview with Rocks Across the Pond, a curling podcast, he said there was no question that \\u201cit created a kind of toughness in them.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cTo do what they did, to make everything public, took a lot of courage and effort,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNo matter what they face now, it\\u2019s not going to be as bad as that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6952d4d8898d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6952d4d8898d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
