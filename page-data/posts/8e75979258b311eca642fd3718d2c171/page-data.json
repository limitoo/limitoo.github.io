Those who had received only two doses had much lower antibody levels against the variant compared with an earlier version of the virus.\", \"The laboratory tests cannot determine for sure how the vaccines will perform in the real world, but the results seem to underscore the importance of booster shots. Pfizer\\u2019s chairman said that the company started developing a version of its vaccine targeting Omicron last month, and that it could be produced within 95 days. Moderna is on a similar path.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"Ukraine, a former Soviet republic, is a partner \\u2014 but not a member \\u2014 of NATO, an American-led alliance explicitly created to counter the Soviet Union. Through that partnership, Ukraine has sent troops to fight in NATO missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, even as it does not benefit from actual membership and from NATO\\u2019s commitment to collective defense.\", \"True membership has been pending since 2008, when NATO promised membership to Ukraine and to Georgia without specifying when or how. (That promise may never be fulfilled.) Russia lashed out against the offer, seeing it as a potential threat on its borders and a serious encroachment into the heart of its sphere of influence.\", \"As thousands of Russian troops mass on Ukraine\\u2019s borders, NATO is, therefore, not bound by treaty to protect Ukraine militarily, nor is it likely to try. Asked on Wednesday about the possibility of dispatching U.S. forces to Ukraine, President Biden flatly ruled it out, telling reporters at the White House, \\u201cThat is not on the table.\\u201d\", \"Russian perspective: Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, regards Ukraine as a fake country and an \\u201cinalienable part of Russia.\\u201d The promise of membership is to him a sign of a still-expansionist NATO that is committed to ripping Ukraine away from the Russian zone of influence.\", \"Angela Merkel handed over the chancellery of Germany to Olaf Scholz yesterday, beginning a new chapter for Europe\\u2019s largest democracy. Scholz will lead the first center-left government in 16 years while trying to live up to the high expectations set by Merkel.\", \"At the swearing-in, Scholz omitted the \\u201cso help me God\\u201d phrase in the traditional oath. The transition was harmonious, with kind words from Merkel and Scholz to each other. In her farewell remarks, Merkel called the chancellorship \\u201cone of the most beautiful duties there are.\\u201d\", \"Several crises demand Scholz\\u2019s immediate attention, chief among them the coronavirus pandemic and a possible Russian military invasion of Ukraine. He will also have to maintain European cohesion in the continuing wake of Britain\\u2019s departure from the E.U. and contend with Washington, an ally that has become less dependable in recent years.\", \"End of an era: Under Merkel, Germany became Europe\\u2019s leading power for the first time in modern history. Look back at her tenure in photos.\", \"When inconvenient news erupts on the Chinese internet, the censors jump into action. They took just 20 minutes to mobilize after Peng Shuai, the Chinese tennis star, accused Zhang Gaoli, a former vice premier, of sexual assault.\", \"But after her subsequent disappearance caught the world\\u2019s attention, China has scrambled to control the narrative, leaning on the state news media, friendly foreigners and an army of bots.\", \"At the Natural History Museum in London, the enormous, ferocious-looking replica T. rex often startles visitors with its animatronic moves and roaring sound effects. On Monday, that predatory edge was somewhat softened by a giant blue, red and green holiday sweater, Maria Cramer reports for The Times.\", \"The turtleneck, which was made by the British knitwear company Jack Masters, fits snugly around the T. rex\\u2019s wide upper body and neck, then is tapered into sleeves short enough to encircle the dinosaur\\u2019s diminutive arms.\", \"The process of making the sweater included around 100 hours of knitting time, fittings involving large step ladders and extra-long measuring tape, and a redesign after the sweater proved impossible to get over the dinosaur\\u2019s head. The final item measures nearly four feet around the neck, nine and a half feet around the shoulders and just over 10 feet around the body.\", \"\\u201cThere is nothing more funny than a jumper fitted for a dinosaur that has the tiniest arms in the world,\\u201d said Carla Treasure, a buyer at the museum. \\u201cI think it makes it slightly less scary.\\u201d (That said, a few children were still surprised into tears.)\", \"Read more about the Christmas sweater.\", \"Find inspiration among The Times\\u2019s most popular recipes, including this vibrant one-pot soup.\", \"This year is the 50th anniversary of the publication of the first book in the \\u201cMr. Men Little Miss\\u201d series, which now includes nearly 100 silly, messy, topsy-turvy characters.\", \"How to use your phone\\u2019s privacy protection tools.\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: \\u201cBut soft!
