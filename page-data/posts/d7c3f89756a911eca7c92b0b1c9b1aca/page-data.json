Despite a DVD release of the production coming out this month, it was, Neuwirth said, \\u201cnot on my brain anymore.\\u201d\", \"The work \\u2014 a subversive blurring of genre, time and politics reflecting on how little has changed over the centuries, yet how much change is possible \\u2014 jolted the generally conservative Vienna State Opera. It is also something of a milestone for the Grawemeyer, which since its inaugural award in 1985 has been given to only three other women before Neuwirth (an issue Andrew Norman called attention to when he won the 2017 prize).\", \"\\u201c\\u2018Orlando\\u2019 is an enormous, supremely ambitious work,\\u201d Marc Satterwhite, the award\\u2019s director, said in a statement. \\u201cThe libretto and multifaceted score challenge our preconceptions of gender and sexual roles and test our ideas of what opera is and is not.\\u201d\", \"Woolf\\u2019s novel, a fantastical parody of biographies, follows its forever-young protagonist through the centuries: from Orlando\\u2019s years as a favorite of Elizabeth I to the book\\u2019s publication in 1928. Appearing first as a titled man, the character suddenly becomes a woman \\u2014 who later faces a comparatively frustrating life on the other side of gender politics. Sally Potter adapted the story into a wry and dreamy 1992 film, starring Tilda Swinton, that carried Orlando\\u2019s story into the late 20th century.\", \"Neuwirth\\u2019s opera goes another step further, taking the plot to the present \\u2014 a world facing climate crisis, the rise of nationalism and the persistence of the patriarchy \\u2014 and looking toward a better future. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not kitschy, but in a way it\\u2019s hopeful,\\u201d she said in the interview. \\u201cAnd we need to keep that in our hearts. Otherwise hate will fill it up more and more. We are all different, but just by listening to each other we can try to create a different world.\\u201d\", \"Her \\u201cOrlando\\u201d covers several hundred years over three hours, with a score of smoothly fleeting stylistic shifts and disorientingly fuzzy instrumental distinctions \\u2014 what Neuwirth has described as a kind of androgyny in sound. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s really my grand piece,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019m in this business now for 35 years, and this brought everything together.\\u201d\", \"Neuwirth studied at the University of Music and Performing Arts in Vienna, then at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and the San Francisco Art Institute. She described her time in the United States as formative; amid open-minded artistic friends and casual acquaintance with the chess legend Bobby Fischer, she thought about music in a more inclusive, genre-embracing way.\", \"\\u201cOrlando\\u201d followed other stage works, including a harrowing 2003 adaptation of David Lynch\\u2019s film \\u201cLost Highway.\\u201d It starred the mezzo-soprano Kate Lindsey and featured artists from outside opera \\u2014 among them the cabaret legend Justin Vivian Bond as Orlando\\u2019s child and the fashion designer Rei Kawakubo, who did the costumes.\", \"Yet in bringing the production to life at the Vienna State Opera, Neuwirth said, \\u201cI had a lot of fights.\\u201d The company gave it a run of only five performances, and a revival is currently not expected. \\u201cOrlando\\u201d may have been a breakthrough for the house, but the fact that it came and went, she added, \\u201cis a sign that the system has not changed.\\u201d\", \"Neuwirth has recently faced other setbacks. Her next opera, \\u201cManga for Lovers\\u201d \\u2014 whose team includes the \\u201cLost Highway\\u201d screenwriter Barry Gifford, the innovative director Yuval Sharon and the soprano Julia Bullock \\u2014 had been planned for the Th\\u00e9\\u00e2tre du Ch\\u00e2telet in Paris next fall, but was canceled, with no new opening in sight. \\u201cKeyframes for a Hippogriff,\\u201d her commission for the New York Philharmonic\\u2019s Project 19 series to commemorate the 19th Amendment, was meant to premiere in June 2020 but remains delayed by the pandemic because the piece calls for a children\\u2019s choir. (It was instead first presented by the Berlin Philharmonic in September.)\", \"\\u201cI still think there are so many gifted composers out there, it feels like Russian roulette, in a positive way,\\u201d Neuwirth said of the Grawemeyer news, which follows her winning the Wolf Prize in Music earlier this year. \\u201cBut after everything, and the whole story with \\u2018Orlando,\\u2019 it is a really wonderful sign to keep going.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"d7c3f89756a911eca7c92b0b1c9b1aca"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d7c3f89756a911eca7c92b0b1c9b1aca"}},
