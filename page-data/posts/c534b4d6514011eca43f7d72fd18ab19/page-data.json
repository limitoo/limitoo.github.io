Investors are pouring billions of dollars into funds to buy up song copyrights. Licensing clearinghouses like ASCAP and BMI process trillions of plays each year to collect and pay royalties.\", \"But one number increasingly looks lost to time: selling a million albums in a week.\", \"This week, Adele tops the Billboard album chart with the equivalent of 839,000 sales in the United States of her latest release, \\u201c30,\\u201d according to the tracking service MRC Data. Of those, 692,000 were sold as complete packages \\u2014 as CDs or vinyl LPs, for example \\u2014 and its songs racked up 185 million streams.\", \"These days, that counts as an unqualified blockbuster. \\u201c30\\u201d had by far the biggest opening of any album this year, beating both Drake\\u2019s \\u201cCertified Lover Boy\\u201d and Taylor Swift\\u2019s \\u201cRed (Taylor\\u2019s Version)\\u201d by more than 200,000.\", \"But it was a far cry from Adele\\u2019s last album, \\u201c25,\\u201d which six years ago caused jaws to drop throughout the industry by selling nearly 3.4 million copies in its first week alone. This time around, the eyes of the music industry have been firmly on Adele\\u2019s numbers.\", \"If Adele could not sell more than a million albums in a single week, could any artist? That has always been a special feat, but at the peak of the CD market it happened with some regularity. In 2000, for example, six titles \\u2014 by \\u2019N Sync, Eminem, the Backstreet Boys, Britney Spears, the Beatles and Limp Bizkit \\u2014 each had seven-digit opening weeks.\", \"Even as the industry\\u2019s traditional sales model was collapsing throughout the 2000s, giant hits still broke through, stoked by fan demand, smart marketing and, sometimes, sales gimmicks. Lil Wayne moved just over one million of \\u201cTha Carter III\\u201d in 2008. Lady Gaga\\u2019s \\u201cBorn This Way\\u201d sold 1.1 million in 2011, though many were for heavily discounted downloads from Amazon. (In response, Billboard adjusted its chart rules to prevent a repeat.)\", \"And Swift crossed the million mark four times, from \\u201cSpeak Now\\u201d in 2010 through \\u201cReputation\\u201d in 2017, which was the last album by any artist to do so.\", \"Streaming is a major factor in the change. Why would any fan buy an album, the thinking goes, when they can stream it free or as part of an all-you-can-eat monthly subscription? When Adele released \\u201c25,\\u201d she kept it from services for seven months; now, with streaming dominating the marketplace, \\u201c30\\u201d was widely available on services like Spotify and Apple Music on the day it was released.\", \"Another tweak to Billboard\\u2019s chart rules last year made it harder to score big opening-week numbers. In recent years, it became common for artists to \\u201cbundle\\u201d their album, often in download form, with the sale of merchandise or concert tickets. Last year, in acknowledgment that these practices distorted the charts\\u2019 \\u201cintended goal of accurately reflecting consumer intent,\\u201d Billboard stopped counting sales from those deals on its chart.\", \"Adele\\u2019s \\u201c30\\u201d has been intensely anticipated by fans since at least early last year, when Adele said at a party that her album could be expected that fall. And the rollout of the album has been as high-profile as any artist could want, with a prime-time television special; special editions of the album sold by Target and Walmart; and a radio single, \\u201cEasy on Me,\\u201d that was No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for four weeks straight.\", \"Of the 692,000 copies of \\u201c30\\u201d that were sold as complete packages \\u2014 albums, in other words \\u2014 205,000 were digital downloads and 487,000 were on physical formats, including 378,000 CDs, 108,000 vinyl LPs and fewer than 2,000 cassettes. The vinyl sales for \\u201c30\\u201d were the second-most recorded in a single week since at least 1991, when SoundScan, the predecessor of MRC, began keeping accurate count of record sales. The top seller? Swift\\u2019s new \\u201cRed (Taylor\\u2019s Version),\\u201d which sold 114,000 copies on vinyl just a week before, when it opened at No. 1.\", \"This week, that version of \\u201cRed\\u201d falls to second place on the chart. \\u201cCertified Lover Boy\\u201d is No. 3, \\u201cAn Evening With Silk Sonic,\\u201d the new project by Silk Sonic \\u2014 a.k.a. Bruno Mars and Anderson .Paak \\u2014 is No. 4, and Morgan Wallen\\u2019s \\u201cDangerous: The Double Album\\u201d is in fifth place.\", \"Summer Walker\\u2019s \\u201cStill Over It\\u201d is in sixth place, and Robert Plant and Alison Krauss\\u2019s \\u201cRaise the Roof\\u201d opens at No. 7.\"]","href_hash":"c534b4d6514011eca43f7d72fd18ab19"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c534b4d6514011eca43f7d72fd18ab19"}},
