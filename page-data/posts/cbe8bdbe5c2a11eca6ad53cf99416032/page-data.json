Such a strict policy regarding vaccine mandates has not yet been seen elsewhere in the United States.\", \"Tapper asked: \\\"Should all businesses in New York City fire workers in the middle of the holidays if they don't choose to get vaccinated?\", \"De Blasio responded: \\\"We chose the 27th, mindful of course of Christmas and the holiday season, Jake, and the bottom line is, what we found with all the mandates, we did this with the private sector already with restaurants, indoor entertainment, fitness. And what we found is in fact, employees overwhelmingly agreed and followed through.\", \"\\\"They may not have thought they would like it originally, but they ultimately chose to get that shot, and in fact realize that everyone was safe in those settings. The customers have loved to have heard this consistently from restaurant owners, they're full now. People go in confident they'll be safe, so it's been very good for business.\\\"\", \"He said that the threat of potential lockdowns and restrictions was \\\"bad for business.\\\"\", \"\\\"I've got business owners terrified that we're going to go back where we were. Look at Germany right now. Look at England right now. They are going backwards fast.\\\"\", \"New York City has administered more than 12.5 million vaccination doses so far, with 89 percent of adults having had at least one dose. More than 125,000 children aged 5-11 have also had at least one dose.\", \"De Blasio, a Democrat whose term ends on January 1, said that high vaccination rates allowed New York's schools to be \\\"safe\\\" and its restaurants to thrive.\", \"Hutchison disagreed, and said that education was a more effective way to increase vaccinations, and that it doesn't impose strict restrictions on the private sector.\", \"However, both men agreed that COVID-19 vaccines were safe and effective. Tapper pointed out that mandates likely work because only half of Arkansas' population is fully-vaccinated.\", \"On December 7, de Blasio's COVID-19 vaccine mandate for New York City employees, including the NYPD, was blocked by a Manhattan court.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950154/nyc-mayor-de-blasio.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 24: New York City Mayor, Bill de Blasio, speaks to members of the media at the 95th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade Balloon Inflation on the Upper West Side on November 24, 2021 in New York City.
