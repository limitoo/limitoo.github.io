A polar orbit is one that passes over polar regions, especially one whose plane contains the polar axis.\", \"Scotland contains sites with the best access to polar and SSO orbits without flying over land inhabited by humans.\", \"Three key areas emerged when the government was looking into this - Scolpaig in North Uist, the Moine Peninsula in Sutherland and Saxa Vord in Shetland. \", \"Scolpaig and Moine set out business cases to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) to argue why they would be the best home for the UK Space Agency's new vertical launch pad.\", \"Saxa Vord missed out on the bidding process, but US aerospace company Lockheed Martin has approval from the UK Space Agency to push ahead with plans for site in Shetland.\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/B0CB/production/_120095254_hangar.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Illustration of space port hangar</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">So the further north the better?</div>\", \"Well, not quite. Members of the British Interplanetary Society concluded it would be feasible to launch from Scotland by means of an SSO or polar orbit.\", \"The most efficient method would be a direct ascent route - one where the trajectory does not fly over, or close to, an inhabited area of land as potential falling debris could be a risk to life.\", \"Spacecrafts would need to perform a dog-leg manoeuvre to avoid inhabited regions, such as the Faroes or Iceland.\", \"They would also need to avoid any \\\"active oil and gas exploration area\\\" - which includes the dozens of oil rigs stationed in the North Sea.\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/1645A/production/_110862219_launchpadcomplex.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Space Hub Sutherland</div>\", \"In July 2018, the UK government decided that the Moine peninsula bid was the best option.\", \"The \\u00a317.5m facility - called Space Hub Sutherland - is expected to be used for launching small satellites and was initially granted \\u00a32.5m from the UK Space Agency.\", \"In August last year, Highland Council granted HIE planning permission for the site and for up to 12 satellite launches a year.\", \"The Scottish government did not call-in the local authority's decision for further consideration, clearing the way for the project to complete its journey through the planning process.\", \"But it later hit a problem. \", \"It faced a legal challenge from billionaires Anders and Anne Holch Povlsen, who own land near the proposed space port and are among more than 400 objectors to the plans.\", \"They had concerns about its impact on vulnerable protected areas.
