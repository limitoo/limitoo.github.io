For the story the song tells? For the way it reflects your own experiences and memories? On \\u201c30,\\u201d her fourth album, Adele Adkins pushes for all of those at once, counting on her untrammeled musicality to pull together the empathy of pop with personal sympathy for a performer who\\u2019s grappling with motherhood, fame and changes of heart.\", \"It\\u2019s an album, Adele has said on Instagram and in her Nov. 14 concert-and-interview TV special with Oprah Winfrey, about her divorce from Simon Konecki, the father of their child, Angelo. It\\u2019s also about the aftermath: guilt, drinking, depression, loneliness, self-doubt and, eventually, moving on. The split is apparently amicable; Konecki shares custody and lives across the street from Adele in Beverly Hills.\", \"Adele chose to divorce because, she told Rolling Stone, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t like who I was.\\u201d She addresses it most directly in \\u201cI Drink Wine,\\u201d a crescendo of confession and self-help underpinned by churchy piano and organ: \\u201cHow can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?\\u201d she sings. \\u201cHow come we\\u2019ve both become a version of a person we don\\u2019t even like?\\u201d\", \"In her six years between albums \\u2014 a gap extended by the pandemic \\u2014 Adele has largely stood aside from the miniaturization and gimmickiness of current pop hitmaking. She can; she\\u2019s one of the few remaining stars with ardent fans across multiple generations, and she keeps her ear on pop\\u2019s history more than on fleeting trends.\", \"Adele ended her televised concert extolling \\u201creal music,\\u201d \\u201clive music\\u201d and \\u201creal artistry,\\u201d virtues of the vanished analog era. While many current streaming hits are just two minutes long, half of the songs on \\u201c30\\u201d run longer than five minutes, including extended stretches of piano and voice alone, taking their time and savoring dynamic, non-metronomic ups and downs. Adele doesn\\u2019t rule out electronics, but she makes clear that she doesn\\u2019t have to rely on them.\", \"Her voice \\u2014 cooing, declaiming, arguing, teasing, imploring, quivering, breaking, shouting \\u2014 is rightfully at the center. Even as she sings about desperation and uncertainty, on \\u201c30\\u201d Adele\\u2019s voice is more supple and purposeful than ever, articulating every consonant and constantly ornamenting her melodies without distracting from them. Details are fastidious; in \\u201cI Drink Wine,\\u201d she sings \\u201cI\\u2019m trying to keep climbing up\\u201d while her voice rises in an upward arpeggio. Her emotion is always matched by her concentration.\", \"The songs on \\u201c30\\u201d can be extravagantly theatrical. The album begins with \\u201cStrangers by Nature\\u201d and ends with \\u201cLove Is a Game\\u201d: leisurely, string-laden ballads that evoke bygone Hollywood opulence. Yet their lyrics frame the other songs on \\u201c30\\u201d with a new, grown-up skepticism and ambivalence about love itself: In \\u201cLove Is a Game,\\u201d Adele belts, \\u201cWhat a cruel thing to self-inflict that pain.\\u201d\", \"In \\u201cCry Your Heart Out,\\u201d the chorus is delivered mockingly \\u2014 \\u201cCry your heart out, clean your face\\u201d \\u2014 from a computer-tuned girl group, over a beat that evolves imperceptibly from vintage Motown to reggae. But in the verses, even as Adele sings with a cheerful lilt, her lyrics hit a depressive nadir \\u2014 \\u201cI have nothing to feel no more/I can\\u2019t even cry\\u201d \\u2014 and face her own culpability: \\u201cI created this storm/It\\u2019s only fair I have to sit in its rain.\\u201d As she does throughout \\u201c30,\\u201d Adele combats misery with virtuosity.\", \"Most of the songs are produced, co-written and largely played by the supremely flexible Greg Kurstin, who abets tracks as varied as the bare-bones piano ballad \\u201cEasy on Me\\u201d \\u2014 a plea and a self-justification \\u2014 and \\u201cOh My God,\\u201d a foot-stomper that has Adele wondering whether it\\u2019s too soon, or she\\u2019s too bruised, to flirt again. Adele enlisted the mathematically minded Swedish pop experts Max Martin and Shellback for \\u201cCan I Get It,\\u201d which provides a mid-album lift with an upbeat rhythm guitar and a whistled hook as she returns to dating: \\u201cI\\u2019m counting on you/to put the pieces of me back together,\\u201d she sings.\", \"Another computer confection is \\u201cAll Night Parking,\\u201d a time warp of old and new, which juxtaposes florid, speed-fingered, cascading samples from the jazz pianist Erroll Garner with a trap-like drum-machine beat, while Adele shows off jazzy syncopations as she sings about 21st-century lust: \\u201cEvery time that you text/I want to get on the next flight home.\\u201d\", \"But the album is also, at times, candidly and unsettlingly documentary. Adele sings to her son in \\u201cMy Little Love,\\u201d offering reassurances and apologies: \\u201cI\\u2019m so sorry if what I\\u2019ve done makes you feel sad,\\u201d she offers in a low R&B croon. The track interrupts \\u2014 and nearly derails \\u2014 its moody, undulating, Marvin Gaye-ish groove with digital voice notes that Adele recorded at tearful low points and in conversations with her son. \\u201cMommy\\u2019s been having a lot of big feelings recently,\\u201d she tells him. \\u201cI feel a little trapped, like, um, I feel a bit confused, and I feel like I don\\u2019t really know what I\\u2019m doing.\\u201d\", \"The discomfort is part of the point. On \\u201c30,\\u201d Adele complicates the clear pop roles of lover, heroine, victim or fighter. One thing that\\u2019s absent from \\u201c30\\u201d is the kind of righteous revenge song, like \\u201cChasing Pavements\\u201d and \\u201cRolling in the Deep,\\u201d that the younger Adele would hurl at exes. On \\u201c30,\\u201d Adele more calmly extricates herself from a romance in \\u201cWoman Like Me,\\u201d a low-fi bossa nova produced by Inflo (Dean Josiah Cover) from the British collective Sault, wondering how a suitor could be so lazy and complacent when a little more consistency could win her over.\", \"But more often, Adele\\u2019s songs present her as her own target and her own unfinished self-improvement project. The album\\u2019s core style is secular gospel, with Adele\\u2019s voice gathering itself over hymnlike piano chords, seeking faith not in a higher power but in herself. In \\u201cHold On,\\u201d another collaboration with Inflo, she sings, \\u201cI am my own worst enemy/Right now I truly hate being me\\u201d as a faraway choir urges her to hold on, and her voice rises to a kind of prayer: \\u201cMay time be patient/Let pain be gracious.\\u201d\", \"The album\\u2019s longest track, \\u201cTo Be Loved,\\u201d is also its most minimal, exposed production: just a live-sounding duet with Adele\\u2019s co-writer, Tobias Jesso Jr., on an echoey piano. Slowly, almost hesitantly, and then with growing solidity and vehemence, Adele grapples with what it means to share her life, trying to work out where trust and dependence turn into self-erasure: \\u201cTo be loved and love at the highest count/Means to lose all the things I can\\u2019t live without,\\u201d she sings, then vows, \\u201cI can\\u2019t live a lie.\\u201d\", \"Her phrases swell, tremble and spill over into melismas, and her verses crest with two different peaks. \\u201cLet it be known that I cried,\\u201d she sings, but later she trumpets, so loud it overloads the microphone, \\u201cLet it be known that I tried.\\u201d It\\u2019s awash in regrets, but decisive; it\\u2019s high drama and a musical tour de force. And it\\u2019s clearly not the end of the story.\"]","href_hash":"4b52d21647fd11ec9783d7539ad3328a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4b52d21647fd11ec9783d7539ad3328a"}},
