She called out “Taser! Taser! Taser!” before firing her gun during a traffic stop.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-30T14:51:28.000Z","content":"[\"The trial of Kimberly Potter, a former police officer facing manslaughter charges after she appeared to mistake her gun for her Taser and fatally shot Daunte Wright, is set to begin with jury selection on Tuesday.\", \"Ms. Potter, 49, was arrested in April, several days after she shot Mr. Wright, 20, during a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb after Mr. Wright broke free from another officer who was trying to handcuff him. As Mr. Wright got back into the driver\\u2019s seat of his car, Ms. Potter called out a warning, suggesting that she was using her Taser, and fired a single shot, killing Mr. Wright.\", \"The shooting took place on a Sunday afternoon in Brooklyn Center, Minn., amid the trial of Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis police officer who was ultimately convicted of murdering George Floyd.\", \"The killing of Mr. Wright, who was Black, by Ms. Potter, who is white, drew thousands of demonstrators to the Brooklyn Center Police Department for a week. At night, people threw water bottles, rocks and other items at a line of police officers stationed in front of the building; the police fired tear gas, foam bullets and other projectiles at demonstrators and arrested hundreds of people that week.\", \"Starting this week, both defense lawyers for the former police officer and prosecutors were expected to interview potential jurors for Ms. Potter\\u2019s trial, which is to start in earnest on Dec. 8 with opening statements.\", \"Ms. Potter, who resigned from the Brooklyn Center Police Department shortly after the shooting, had been training another officer, Anthony Luckey, on April 11 when they pulled over Mr. Wright.\", \"Prosecutors have said that Officer Luckey told Mr. Wright that he was being pulled over because the registration of the Buick he was driving had expired, as indicated by an outdated sticker tab on the car\\u2019s license plate, and because of an air freshener that was dangling from his rearview mirror, which is a traffic violation.\", \"The officers ran Mr. Wright\\u2019s name in their computer system and found that a judge had issued a warrant for his arrest after he missed a court date over two misdemeanor charges. Those charges, of carrying a pistol without a permit and running away from the police, stemmed from an encounter with Minneapolis police officers in June 2020.\", \"Ms. Potter and Officer Luckey returned to Mr. Wright\\u2019s car and asked him to step out, body camera footage showed. When the officers told Mr. Wright that there was an outstanding warrant and Officer Luckey began to handcuff him, Mr. Wright twisted out of the officer\\u2019s grip and got back into the driver\\u2019s seat.\", \"The body cam footage showed Officer Luckey attempting to pull Mr. Wright from the car as Ms. Potter drew a weapon and aimed it at Mr. Wright. She shouted, \\u201cI\\u2019ll Tase you!\\u201d and then \\u201cTaser! Taser! Taser!\\u201d before firing a bullet into Mr. Wright\\u2019s chest.\", \"After Ms. Potter fired the gun, the video shows, she cursed and said, \\u201cI just shot him.\\u201d Officer Luckey and a sergeant who had arrived at the scene appeared stunned. After the shot was fired, Mr. Wright\\u2019s car moved down the street, coming to a stop when it struck another car.\", \"In the criminal complaint filed against Ms. Potter, a special agent with the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension described additional body camera footage that has not been released publicly. The agent, Charles Phill, wrote that Ms. Potter, moments after the shooting, had used an expletive, lamenting that she had \\u201cgrabbed the wrong gun\\u201d and, a minute later, had said, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to go to prison.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Wright was pronounced dead at the scene at 2:18 p.m., 16 minutes after he was shot.\", \"Prosecutors in the Minnesota Attorney General\\u2019s Office have filed two felony charges against Ms. Potter: first-degree manslaughter and second-degree manslaughter.\", \"To convict Ms. Potter of first-degree manslaughter, jurors would need to find that Ms. Potter had caused Mr. Wright\\u2019s death while recklessly handling her gun with \\u201csuch force and violence\\u201d that it was \\u201creasonably foreseeable\\u201d that someone would be killed or suffer great bodily harm.\", \"To convict her of the lesser charge of second-degree manslaughter, jurors would need to find that Ms. Potter had caused Mr. Wright\\u2019s death through negligence, had created \\u201can unreasonable risk\\u201d and had consciously taken the chance of killing someone or inflicting great bodily harm.\", \"Neither charge suggests that she intended to kill Mr. Wright.\", \"The standard sentence for a conviction first-degree manslaughter is about seven years, though the maximum sentence is 15 years. For second-degree manslaughter, the standard sentence is four years in prison and the maximum is 10 years.\", \"If Ms. Potter is convicted, the exact sentence would be up to a judge, though prosecutors have said they plan to seek a sentence that is harsher than the standard sentence. They have also indicated that state law would require Ms. Potter to serve at least three years in prison if she is convicted of either charge.\", \"When Ms. Potter was first arrested, she was charged only with second-degree manslaughter. But after Keith Ellison, Minnesota\\u2019s attorney general, took over the case, prosecutors with his office added the more serious manslaughter charge.\", \"After 12 jurors are selected for the trial, prosecutors and Ms. Potter\\u2019s lawyers will make opening statements and call witnesses.\", \"Among the witnesses who could be essential to the case are the two officers who were with Ms. Potter during the traffic stop. Other potential witnesses may be supervisors who worked with Ms. Potter as well as Mr. Wright\\u2019s father, Arbuey Wright. \", \"Ms. Potter\\u2019s defense lawyers have filed a list of 18 potential witnesses with the court, including Timothy Gannon, who resigned as chief of the Brooklyn Center Police Department after the shooting.\", \"Representing Ms. Potter are Paul Engh and Earl Gray, lawyers who are part of the legal defense fund of the Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, a group that represents thousands of law enforcement officers in the state. \", \"The lead prosecutor is Matthew Frank, an assistant attorney general who was also the lead prosecutor in Mr. Chauvin\\u2019s trial. \", \"The judge overseeing the case is Regina M. Chu, who was appointed in 2002 when Jesse Ventura was governor. \", \"Mr. Wright was remembered by friends as an upbeat character who loved to play basketball and was a supportive father to his son, Daunte Jr., who was a year old when Mr. Wright was killed.\", \"\\u201cHe always said he couldn\\u2019t wait to make his son proud,\\u201d Katie Wright, Mr. Wright\\u2019s mother, said at his funeral in April. \\u201cJunior was the joy of his life, and he lived for him every single day, and now he\\u2019s not going to be able to see him.\\u201d\", \"In the days and weeks after Mr. Wright\\u2019s death, it emerged that he had several pending criminal charges and had been accused of being involved in two violent encounters.\", \"A little over a month after Mr. Wright\\u2019s death, a mother sued his estate, claiming that Mr. Wright had shot her son in the head in Minneapolis in May 2019, leaving him disabled. The mother\\u2019s lawsuit says that her son had been childhood friends with Mr. Wright but that they had fallen out and that her son had \\u201cbeat up\\u201d Mr. Wright in May 2019, possibly motivating Mr. Wright to seek revenge.\", \"The lawsuit offers no direct evidence tying Mr. Wright to the shooting, and the Minneapolis police have not made any arrests or commented on the claims in the lawsuit.\", \"A lawyer for Mr. Wright\\u2019s estate has asked a judge to dismiss the lawsuit, and Ms. Wright has said the claims are hurtful.\", \"\\u201cTo run with allegations like that is pretty bad, whether they are true or not true,\\u201d she said in an interview with The Star Tribune.\", \"In addition to the pending gun possession charge that led to the warrant, Mr. Wright was also facing charges of robbing a woman at gunpoint in December 2019.\", \"Many who knew Mr. Wright have said he was a man who had made mistakes but had been improving his life.\", \"A friend, Emajay Driver, said that Mr. Wright had \\u201cloved to make people laugh.\\u201d As a freshman in high school in Minneapolis, Mr. Wright had been voted a class clown. \\u201cThere was never a dull moment,\\u201d Mr. Driver said.\", \"In the eulogy at Mr. Wright\\u2019s funeral, the Rev. Al Sharpton called Mr. Wright the \\u201cprince of Brooklyn Center\\u201d and said the police had not known how many lives Mr. Wright brightened.\", \"Ms. Potter had been an officer with the Brooklyn Center Police Department for 26 years before she resigned after the shooting.\", \"She served as a field training officer and was training a less experienced colleague, Officer Luckey, when she shot Mr. Wright. She had also served as the president of the police union in recent years, prosecutors have said. \", \"Her husband was also a police officer for 28 years in Fridley, Minn., which is just across the Mississippi River from Brooklyn Center. Before he retired, her husband had been an instructor in the department, training officers in things including using Tasers and how and when to use force, according to a city newsletter.\", \"While not common, there have been several instances in which police officers mistakenly fired their guns when they meant to draw their Tasers.\", \"In 2018, a rookie Kansas police officer mistakenly shot a man who was fighting with a fellow officer. In 2019, a police officer in Pennsylvania shouted \\u201cTaser!\\u201d before shooting an unarmed man in the torso. And in one of the most publicized cases, a white police officer with the Bay Area Rapid Transit agency said he had meant to fire his Taser when he fatally shot Oscar Grant III, who was Black, as Mr. Grant was lying facedown on the train platform on New Year\\u2019s Day in 2009.\", \"In April, The New York Times reported that of 15 cases of so-called weapon confusion in the last two decades, a third of the officers were indicted and three \\u2014 including the only two cases in which people were killed \\u2014 were found guilty.\"]","href_hash":"dc6079d651ec11ecb31e41f5844cf8f4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dc6079d651ec11ecb31e41f5844cf8f4"}},
