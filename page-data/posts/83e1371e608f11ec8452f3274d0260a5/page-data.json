But prosecutors say when Nice filled out that questionnaire she didn't lie, she just didn't think her past experiences were relevant to the questions and didn't see herself as a victim.

Yeah.\", \"And Scott's sister-in-law Janey Peterson has been at war for almost 20 years now.

I'm talking about evidence. Everything on this board is a fact.\\u00a0 \\u2026 there's no scenario of guilt for Scott. \", \"Much of the case for Scott, she says, comes down to the timeline \\u2013 what happened the morning Laci disappeared.\", \"Janey Peterson:\\u00a0 If Scott Peterson is guilty, what time did he commit this crime? \\u2026 He's on death row for the murder of his wife and child.

It was the mailman.\\u00a0 \", \"Janey Peterson: What the mailman said is that, when I went by the Peterson house the morning of December 24th, I went by there between 10:30 and 10:50. \\u2026 the gate was open, and McKenzie was not on the property.\", \"Janey says that's because Laci was out walking McKenzie.

To prove it, they point to what they call the \\\"Aponte tip.\\\"\", \"Janey Peterson [pointing at evidence board]:\\u00a0 This is the Aponte tip ... that was the call that was overheard by Lieutenant Aponte at Norco Prison.\", \"Lieutenant Xavier Aponte was a corrections officer. He called in a tip about a phone recording he had heard about a month after Laci disappeared.\", \"Janey Peterson: And he said he had an inmate who was on the phone with his brother in Modesto discussing the fact that Laci had encountered the burglars across the street from her house.\", \"Janey Peterson: When we heard this, we all thought, \\\"Wow, maybe \\u2013 maybe this'll give us some answers as to what happened to Laci.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"But remember, police dismissed the burglary early on:\", \"DOUG RIDENOUR | MODESTO P.D. [at press conference]: We do not believe at this time that there's any connection with the missing of Laci.\", \"Here's why:\", \"Pat Harris: The police figured out who did it. \\u2026 They asked the culprits, \\\"Well, when did you do this?\\\" And the two gentlemen that were arrested said, \\\"Oh, it was \\u2013 December 26th, the day after Christmas.\\\"\", \"Not on December 24, when Laci went missing, but two days later.\\u00a0 Peterson's defense isn't buying it.\", \"Pat Harris: On December 26th, there was a line of media \\u2026 reporters standing outside the Peterson home up and down that street. There is no way in hell you could burglarize a house with all those people standing out there.\", \"But police say the burglars broke in through a back door on the 26th, out of sight of the street and any reporters who may have been there.\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\", \"As for the tip about an inmate phone call from prison, prosecutors say the phone call is just hearsay. Still, Peterson's attorney says if Scott gets a chance at a new trial, that burglary will be front and center. And so will their theory of the crime: that Scott Peterson was actually framed for his wife's murder.\", \"Janey Peterson: What better way to get out of trouble than go put the body where the husband was?\", \"In a 2017 A&E documentary, Scott Peterson spoke about the moment he heard the word \\\"guilty.\\\"\", \"SCOTT PETERSON [phone recording]:\\u00a0 I was staggered by it. \\u00a0I had no idea it was coming.\", \"SCOTT PETERSON [phone recording]: \\u00a0 \\u2026 and I just had this weird sensation that I was falling forward. \", \"Those thoughts seem starkly different from courtroom reports that describe Peterson as \\\"emotionless.\\\"\\u00a0 \", \"JUROR [at press conference]: Scott had no emotion on his face, Scott was being Scott.\", \"And according to his lawyer, that lack of outward emotion hurt Scott from day one.\", \"Pat Harris: I think the biggest problem I have is \\u2026 what I call the \\\"he didn't act right\\\" evidence. There is no such thing as how to act. There's no playbook on how to act when your wife has been murdered. \\u2026 No matter what you do, when you've built the narrative in your mind that he's guilty, whatever Scott did was gonna be interpreted through the lens of he's guilty \\u2026\", \"Pat Harris: It was a terrible investigation from the first minute.\", \"Harris says authorities had tunnel vision. He claims they never looked at other possibilities, or even the logic of their own theories. \", \"Pat Harris: We did an experiment which we filmed.\\u00a0\", \"The defense team loaded weights into a boat.\", \"Pat Harris: We took the exact weight \\u2013 We had the boat, similar \\u2026 \\u00a0We recreated it, did a video. And sure enough, when the body was dumped over, the boat flipped. We had a video of this. The judge refused to let it in.\", \"But the Supreme Court said that the judge was correct not to let it in. They said the defense had used a different boat, a different motor, in different weather, and one of their own employees who stepped on the side of the boat to let in water and allow the boat to swamp. They even pointed out that the original judge offered the defense a chance to redo the experiment with the original boat and someone who was not a defense employee. But the defense declined. Still, Janey says if given a chance, the defense will present other exonerating evidence.    \", \"Janey Peterson: We have an ongoing investigation that we don't discuss publicly. But I guarantee you that Scott will never be convicted of capital murder again in a court of law.\", \"Jonathan Vigliotti: Some of the most damning evidence is where Laci and her unborn child were found. They washed up very close to an area where Scott Peterson was fishing. Are you saying that's just coincidence?\", \"Janey Peterson: I'm not saying it's a coincidence. I'm \\u2013 I would argue it was on purpose.\", \"Jonathan Vigliotti: On purpose?\", \"Janey Peterson: On purpose.\", \"They claim that Peterson was actually framed for the murder, and the real killer or killers held on to Laci's body, eventually dumping it into the San Francisco Bay.\", \"Janey Peterson: Her body wasn't taken to the bay December 24th. The bay wasn't sealed off as a crime scene. \\u2026There are multiple points of access directly to the water, 24 hours a day.

Det. Jon Buehler: The two burglars that were involved in that both told consistent stories that were backed up by other independent witnesses.\\u00a0\", \"Detective Jon Buehler, one of the original investigators, says burglars had nothing to do with Laci's murder. And the idea that Laci was kidnapped in broad daylight in that neighborhood just doesn't make sense.\", \"Ret. Det. Jon Buehler: Well, how come nobody saw Laci get abducted? \\u2026 nobody saw an abduction in broad daylight where a girl had a dog, and the dog would be barking, and a girl would be screaming. Tell me how that is going to happen because I don't see it.\", \"As for the idea that Scott was framed \\u2026\", \"Ret. Det. Jon Buehler: What is the likelihood that somebody is going to abduct Laci, and then all of a sudden, the media has intense scrutiny and attention to it. And then they're going to take her 90 miles to San Francisco Bay, and they're going to put her in the exact same area that Scott said he was fishing in? All the while we're doing searches up there, all the while that the media is camped out over there, that you've got cops and deputies and other agencies over there looking into this.\", \"Ret. Det. Jon Buehler: You want to try and make that stretch with me that somebody is going to drive from Modesto to Berkeley to take a body out there in the midst of that? Well, I guess possible. But you know, there's still people that believe the earth is flat, too.\", \"The District Attorney is not commenting on the defense's theories, but at Peterson's trial, contrary to what the defense argued, prosecutors laid out their relatively clear theory of the crime: that Laci had been murdered in the home either the night before or the morning she disappeared. And they focused on all the falsehoods Peterson had told.\", \"Ret. Det. Jon Buehler: We knew that he was able to lie fairly easily.\", \"Everything from the big lies he told to Amber Frey \\u2026\", \"SCOTT PETERSON [phone recording]:\\u00a0 It's pretty awesome, fireworks there at the Eiffel Tower.\", \"SCOTT PETERSON [phone recording]: I have \\u2013 I've lied to you that I've been traveling.\", \"\\u2026 to the little lies prosecutors say he told about the morning Laci vanished.\\u00a0 Remember he said he left home around 9:30 a.m.:\", \"POLICE INTERVIEW: OK, so then about 9:30 you left?\", \"SCOTT PETERSON:\\u00a0 Mm-hmm [affirms].\", \"But that Martha Stewart segment on meringues he talked about watching with Laci?\\u00a0 \", \"SCOTT PETERSON: We were watching her favorite show, \\\"Martha Stewart.\\\"\", \"That didn't come on until 9:48 a.m.\", \"Ret.
