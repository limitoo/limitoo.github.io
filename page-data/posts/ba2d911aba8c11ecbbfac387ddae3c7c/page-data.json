The former PM and most of his party's MPs resigned from their seats ahead of the vote.\", \"Shehbaz Sharif submitted his candidacy for the top post on Sunday, before winning 174 votes in parliament the following day - two more than a simple majority of lawmakers.\", \"In a speech after the vote, Sharif accused Imran Khan's outgoing government of mismanaging the economy and said putting it back on track would be a huge challenge for his new government.\", \"However, Imran Khan, whose supporters protested across major cities after he was dismissed, is still blaming a \\\"foreign conspiracy\\\" for his removal as prime minister.\", \"He has claimed that his rivals colluded with the US to remove him because of his foreign policy stance on Afghanistan, Russia and China.

After a four-day hearing, it ruled that Khan's government had acted illegally, in breach of the constitution.\", \"Even then, Khan and his party tried to prevent the vote in parliament for hours - with officials quitting, lawmakers filibustering and other disruptions.\", \"But eventually, in the early hours of Sunday, his opponents secured his removal, with 174 lawmakers voting against him in the 342-member house.\", \"By Secunder Kermani, BBC Pakistan correspondent\", \"Shehbaz Sharif, 70, served as chief minister of Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province, prior to Imran Khan coming to power in 2018. Sharif, who leads the Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMLN), had a reputation for efficiency and being hardworking, and is credited with making significant infrastructure improvements.\", \"Many ruefully contrasted him with his successor, Usman Buzdar, who was widely ridiculed as under-qualified and incompetent. Anger at Imran Khan's refusal to replace Mr Buzdar is one reason cited by numerous analysts for the emergence of a rift between Mr Khan and his previously close ally, the Pakistani military.\", \"Shehbaz Sharif has always been in the shadow of his older brother, Nawaz Sharif, who served as PM on three occasions. Whereas Nawaz openly criticised the army following his removal from power, however, Shehbaz has favoured a reconciliation with the \\\"establishment\\\".\", \"Like his brother, Shehbaz has also faced corruption allegations and has spent periods of time in jail during Mr Khan's tenure. He has not been convicted of an offence and maintains the allegations are politically motivated. Shehbaz Sharif's son, Hamza, is hoping to follow in his father's footsteps and become the next chief minister of Punjab.\", \"Imran Khan's supporters regard the Sharif clan as part of the dynastic, \\\"old Pakistan\\\" that they want to relegate to history.\", \"- BBC\"]","href_hash":"ba2d911aba8c11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ba2d911aba8c11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
