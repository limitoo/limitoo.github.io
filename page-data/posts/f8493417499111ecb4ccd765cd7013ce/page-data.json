Murdaugh was indicted Friday, Nov. 19, on 27 additional charges involving financial crimes. Prosecutors say Murdaugh stole nearly $5 million in settlement money he had obtained for his dead housekeeper, an injured state trooper and other people as well as fees meant for his law firm. </div>\", \"Murdaugh, 53, remains in jail without bond after two previous arrests\\u2014a stunning fall for a lawyer whose father, grandfather and great-grandfather were elected prosecutors in tiny Hampton County and whose family founded and grew a private law firm that takes up an entire block in the county of 20,000 people.\", \"Friday's charges were laid out in five indictments, describing five separate schemes in five different counties where Murdaugh's firm operated. Some are several years old and some took place in the months before his wife and son were killed. All 27 counts are felonies, and if convicted of all the charges in just one of the plots, he would face more than 100 years in prison, prosecutors said.\", \"The 27 counts include seven of money laundering; four of breach of trust; seven of obtaining signature or property by false pretenses; eight of computer crimes; and one of forgery.\", \"All the charges involve a fraudulent bank account Murdaugh created with a name similar to a company that handles legal settlements, investigators said.\", \"Murdaugh used the money to pay bank overdraft fees, credit card payments, checks written to friends and family and other items, the indictments say.\", \"Murdaugh stole a $125,000 settlement from a state trooper injured on duty and about $450,000 from two other clients who hired them to handle their personal injury cases, indictments say.\", \"Another indictment said Murdaugh had a fellow lawyer write checks for $792,000 in fees directly to him, instead of his PMPED Law Firm, saying the firm gave its blessing for the arrangement and \\\"because of possible civil liability in a case involving a boat crash in which a young woman died.\\\"\", \"When the firm started asking questions, Murdaugh only paid them $600,000, leaving the other lawyer to make up the remaining $192,000, prosecutors said.\", \"The PMPED Law Firm has said Murdaugh stole millions of dollars.
