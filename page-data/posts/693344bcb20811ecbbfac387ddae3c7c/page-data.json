Typically, what (adversaries are) looking for is timing and sequencing data, flow rates, temperatures, how long it takes to do certain tasks.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"That's considered to be important information by other countries, and so we have to be very careful when we share data, particularly for the first time,\\\" Whitmeyer added.\\u00a0\", \"Whitmeyer declined to say what might make an SLS countdown any different from that of a space shuttle, which was carried out in the open, using virtually identical engines, the same propellants and similar tanks.\", \"In any case, NASA provided an approved countdown overview with general guidance on major events.\", \"The initial hours of the countdown called for battery charging, engine preps, ground power system configuration, sound suppression water system loading and other tasks familiar from shuttle operations.\", \"The Orion crew capsule will be powered up, followed by the first and second stages. Then, during a 90-minute hold starting at 6 a.m. Sunday, NASA's mission management team and Blackwell-Thompson will meet to assess the weather and readiness to press on with propellant loading.\", \"If all goes well, the countdown will resume around 7:30 a.m. with a \\\"go\\\" for fueling. Just after 8 a.m., 196,000 gallons of liquid oxygen, at minus 297 degrees Fahrenheit, will begin flowing into the core stage, followed by 537,000 gallons of liquid hydrogen at minus 423 degrees.\", \"About two hours later, the team will begin filling the SLS rocket's Interim Cryogenic Propulsion Stage, or ICPS, with another 22,000 gallons of cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen fuel. The ICPS is a modified upper stage originally developed for United Launch Alliance's Delta 4 Heavy rocket.\", \"As the countdown continues, engineers will review data, carry out leak tests and other checks to make sure they can control the flow of propellants as required.\", \"The SLS terminal countdown begins after a final 30-minute hold ends at the launch-minus 10-minute mark. In an actual launch, the countdown would proceed through main engine start, booster ignition and liftoff, but for the dress rehearsal, two test runs are planned.\", \"In the first run, the countdown will proceed from the 10-minute mark to the 33-second mark when a cutoff command will be issued by the ground launch sequencer computer. The countdown then will be recycled back to L-minus 10 minutes and after a one-hour hold, it will resume, ticking down to just inside 10 seconds before another cutoff command.\", \"At that point, engineers will begin \\\"safing\\\" the rocket, draining the propellant tanks and beginning work to ready the SLS and its mobile launch stand for rollback to the Vehicle Assembly Building.\", \"Engineers then will address any problems that might have developed or been identified during the countdown test.\", \"NASA has not yet set a target launch date. While a May launch is possible in theory, it appears more likely launch will slip into the June timeframe. But that will depend on the results of the countdown test.\", \"\\\"I could kind of give you some guesses right now, but I don't think it really makes much sense,\\\" Whitmeyer said. \\\"We're literally going to have a wet dress rehearsal on Sunday. We'll come back and talk to you Monday, and I think we'll be in a much better position to give you some good information about what the path looks (like) at that point.\\\"\", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News.
