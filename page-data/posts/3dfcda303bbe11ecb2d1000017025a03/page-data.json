We tend to design, debate and measure our economic policies with regard to income alone, which blinds us to the ways prosperity and precarity tangibly function in people\\u2019s lives. And that blind spot can ultimately prevent us from addressing social inequality at its roots.\", \"[You can listen to this episode of \\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\\u201d on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]\", \"Take the debate over student loan cancellation. Cancellation is often framed as an economically regressive policy \\u2014 an elite giveaway of sorts \\u2014 with the majority of benefits going to individuals toward the top end of the income distribution. But that distributive picture flips when you look at wealth instead of income. One recent paper found that if the federal government decided to forgive up to $50,000 in student loan debt, the average person in the 20th to 40th percentiles for household assets would receive more than four times as much debt cancellation as the average person in the top 10 percent.\", \"Louise Seamster is a sociologist at the University of Iowa whose work focuses on the intersection of wealth, race, education and inequality. She\\u2019s one of the sharpest minds studying the way systems of wealth creation and depletion shape everything from the benefits of higher education to the barriers to racial equality to the nature of democratic citizenship. And her cutting-edge research on the student debt crisis and the racial wealth gap served as a major source of inspiration for Senator Elizabeth Warren\\u2019s $50,000 loan forgiveness plan.\", \"This conversation begins with a discussion of the student debt crisis in particular: what it\\u2019s like to live with crushing levels of debt, the debate over whether cancellation is fair to those who have paid off their loans, why you can\\u2019t truly understand the student debt crisis without understanding the wealth dynamics that undergird it, how loan forgiveness would alter the racial wealth gap, what an entirely different model for funding higher education would look like and more.\", \"But this discussion is also more broadly about what it means to think in terms of wealth \\u2014 and its inverse, debt \\u2014 and what a radically different picture that reveals about the American economy and society.\", \"You can listen to the whole conversation by following \\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\\u201d on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.
