The  people said the situation was fluid and fast-moving.\", \"Twitter  had enacted an anti-takeover measure known as a poison pill that could  make a takeover attempt prohibitively expensive. But the board decided  to negotiate after Musk updated his proposal to show he had secured  financing, according to The Wall Street Journal, which was first to  report the negotiations were underway.\", \"On  April 14, Musk announced an offer to buy the social media platform for  $54.20 per share, or about $43 billion. Last  week, he said in documents filed with U.S. securities regulators that  the money would come from Morgan Stanley and other banks, some of it  secured by his huge stake in the electric car maker.\", \"Twitter has not commented.\", \"Musk has said he wants to buy Twitter because he feels the company isn't living up to its potential as a platform for free speech.\", \"In  recent weeks, he has voiced a number of proposed changes for the  social networking site, from relaxing its content restrictions \\u2014 such as the rules that  suspended former President Donald Trump's account \\u2014 to ridding the  platform of its problems with fake and automated accounts.\", \"Musk  is the world's wealthiest person, according to Forbes, with a nearly  $279 billion fortune. But much of his money is tied up in Tesla stock:  he owns about 17% of the company, according to FactSet, which is valued  at more than $1 trillion. He also owns SpaceX, his privately held space company.  It's unclear how much cash Musk has.\"]","href_hash":"cb0fa54ac4a011ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cb0fa54ac4a011ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
