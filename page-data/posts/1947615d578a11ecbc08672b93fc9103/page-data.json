But before that, when the Coalition was swept to office in 2013, he became Tony Abbott's environment minister, charged with destroying Labor's\\u00a0carbon tax.\", \"(I'm calling it a \\\"carbon tax\\\" here to distinguish it from the mechanism Greg Hunt quietly slipped in to replace it, and also because the Bureau of Statistics decided it\\u00a0was a tax\\u00a0when it recorded it as a tax in the national accounts.)\", \"Labor's scheme taxed (or \\\"charged\\\" if you must) each big emitter in the industries covered A$23 for each tonne of carbon dioxide or equivalent they pumped into the atmosphere.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e1ceb3edb68b2b77df19344ff9744582\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Greg Hun was, for a time, Tony Abbott's\\u00a0environment minister, charged with destroying Labor's carbon tax.(AAP: Lukas Coch)</div>\", \"There were all sorts of problems with Labor's scheme, problems Hunt was keenly aware of, having co-authored a prize-winning\\u00a0research paper\\u00a0on carbon taxes at university and having been immersed in the topic when Labor was last in power, as the Coalition's environment spokesman under leaders Nelson, Turnbull and Abbott.\", \"One big problem was that Australian exporters (of products such as steel and aluminum) would be placed at a disadvantage by having to pay the tax, while their overseas competitors would not.\", \"Steel and aluminium would still be sold to the eventual customers but from a country other than Australia that didn't charge the tax, a phenomenon known as\\u00a0carbon leakage.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Labor's carbon tax had problems</div>\", \"And not only exporters. Australian producers of products for local consumption stood to suffer in the same way, losing sales to foreign suppliers who weren't charged the tax, a problem the European Union is trying to fix at the moment by imposing a so-called\\u00a0Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, or \\\"carbon tariff\\\".\", \"Labor's solution was to grant firms in \\\"emissions-intensive trade-exposed\\\" sectors\\u00a0free permits\\u00a0to the tune of 94.5 per cent\\u00a0of industry average carbon costs in the first year (and less exposed firms free permits to cover 66 per cent\\u00a0of costs), a gift that would be wound back 1.3 per cent\\u00a0each year.\", \"Another solution, being pursued by Hunt as he took soundings while in opposition, was to limit Australian facilities to emitting no more than they are now.\", \"Over time the entitlement could be wound back.
