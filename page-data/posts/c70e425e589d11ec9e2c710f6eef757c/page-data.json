Rather, it\\u2019s between a tuba-playing, Elvish-speaking high school \\u00fcber-nerd and a girl who looks like his grandmother.\", \"That\\u2019s because the girl, Kimberly Levaco, born with a genetic aging disorder akin to progeria, appears to be in her 60s even though she\\u2019s just turning 16. In the funny and moving new musical \\u201cKimberly Akimbo,\\u201d which opened on Wednesday in an Atlantic Theater Company production at the Linda Gross Theater, Victoria Clark brings her to life so believably and gorgeously that you find yourself rooting for a kiss you might otherwise find creepy.\", \"That\\u2019s no surprise; Clark, 62, is one of our great singing actors, situating herself exactly where the two impossible arts intersect. In role after role \\u2014 particularly as an anxious mother in \\u201cThe Light in the Piazza,\\u201d for which she won a Tony Award in 2005 \\u2014 she makes music not an afterthought to character, but the thought itself.\", \"What is surprising is that \\u201cKimberly Akimbo,\\u201d based on the 2000 play of the same name by David Lindsay-Abaire, manages a similar feat. Unlike adaptations that do little more than nail vocal Sheetrock onto bare studs of borrowed story, and have approximately the same elegance, this one \\u2014 with music by Jeanine Tesori and a book and lyrics by Lindsay-Abaire \\u2014 remakes the original on new terms, with songs that beautifully tell us new things.\", \"This is done without undue violence to the ingenious original premise, which makes comedy, as we all must, of tragedy. Kimberly is burdened not only by a disease for which the average life expectancy is 16 (\\u201cIt\\u2019s just an average though,\\u201d she says brightly) but also by a family that has not handled it nearly as well as she has.\", \"Her mother, Pattie (Alli Mauzey), is ludicrously hypochondriacal, as if atoning for the chromosomal accident that produced her quick-aging child. Her father, Buddy (Steven Boyer), is floridly irresponsible, reneging on promises and drinking himself into stupors. Her aunt Debra (Bonnie Milligan) is a cheerful, amoral tornado of bad ideas who squats in the Levaco basement to further a check-forging scheme. In a household filled with impulsive, appetitive childishness, Kimberly, who has to feed Pattie her morning cereal because both her arms are in casts, is the adult by default.\", \"It\\u2019s that quality, more than her appearance, that makes Kimberly something of an outcast at school. The upside is that it draws her to the \\u00fcber-nerd, Seth, played in a terrific New York debut by the 18-year-old Justin Cooley. Seth is plenty familiar with premature adulthood syndrome: His widowed father barely notices him, leaving him to figure out how to be a \\u201cgood kid\\u201d (as one of his songs is titled) on his own. Recognizing that trait in each other, Seth and Kimberly bond over their parallel irregularities: his obsession with anagrams and her genetically scrambled codons.\", \"Each of these subjects produces a wonderfully unexpected song that forwards the plot while deepening the characterizations. In the first, as Seth struggles to make an anagram of \\u201cKimberly Levaco,\\u201d his strange stabs at solutions (\\u201cMy blacker olive! My crablike love!\\u201d) form a kind of descant to her rapturous discovery of his \\u201caskew\\u201d point of view: \\u201cI like the way you look at life and think outside the box,\\u201d she sings. \\u201cA little odd. A little off. A bit unorthodox.\\u201d\", \"And when students present science projects on ailments of their choosing in a hilarious ensemble number called \\u201cOur Disease,\\u201d Kimberly veers from the script she and Seth wrote about hers. Their classmates may have chosen scurvy and fasciolosis, but what they really suffer from is \\u201ca bad case of adolescence,\\u201d she sings. \\u201cGetting older is my affliction. / Getting older is your cure.\\u201d\", \"Those classmates (charmingly played by Olivia Elease Hardy, Fernell Hogan II, Nina White and Michael Iskander) are the most obvious addition to the musical, having been invented to provide social context, a singing ensemble and broader humor. Less convincingly, Lindsay-Abaire ties them into the story as accomplices in Aunt Debra\\u2019s check-forging scheme; they hope to raise enough cash to buy spangly costumes for a show choir competition. Still, as this allows them to provide backup for Milligan\\u2019s barn-burning numbers, I won\\u2019t complain.\", \"That Tesori can write any kind of music is old news. (For further proof, see \\u201cCaroline, or Change,\\u201d now on Broadway.) What\\u2019s apparent in \\u201cKimberly Akimbo\\u201d is that she can also write inerrantly for any kind of show. It can\\u2019t have been easy to find the right moments and tone for songs in a double-sided story like this, where each joke is also a memento mori, and vice versa. (One number is called \\u201cThe Inevitable Turn.\\u201d) Its sound world \\u2014 including ukulele tunes, surprise double-melodies and genial pastiche \\u2014 most resembles that of the stage musical \\u201cShrek,\\u201d another collaboration with Lindsay-Abaire, but it takes its own inevitable turn, becoming richer and more yearning as the material demands.\", \"As its star demands, too. I wish Clark had a bigger solo in the penultimate scene; we have by that time earned the right to a major statement from a performer capable of delivering it.\", \"As long as we\\u2019re picking at excellence, I\\u2019ll add that \\u201cKimberly Akimbo\\u201d isn\\u2019t yet all it might be. The New Jersey setting is clearly and wickedly characterized but the era, supposedly 1999, is not; the father\\u2019s arc is not sharply inscribed; and the use of the high school students to fill out songs they don\\u2019t otherwise belong in feels unmotivated. Though acute in its emotional detail, Jessica Stone\\u2019s staging, on a vague set by David Zinn and with choreography by Danny Mefford, is physically underpowered. Scenes in an ice-skating rink might as well be set in an empty mall, for all the action they deliver.\", \"But these are really minor complaints about a show that gets so many major things so right. \\u201cKimberly Akimbo\\u201d is already the rare example of a good play that has become an even better musical. It warms up the zaniness of the original without overshooting and making it \\u201cnormal.\\u201d Instead of cowering as if embarrassed by the dimension music can bring to drama, it embraces the ability of song, even in tragicomedy, to extend emotion into bigger realms.\", \"And don\\u2019t let its pure enjoyability mislead you into thinking it\\u2019s not a tragicomedy. To see an old hand like Clark make sparks with a newcomer like Cooley is to feel how quickly the world spins forward. \\u201cNo one gets a second time around,\\u201d they sing in the finale (though \\u201cKimberly Akimbo\\u201d fortunately did). It may be an old-style \\u201ccarpe diem\\u201d message \\u2014 or a \\u201cmad recipe,\\u201d as Seth might have it \\u2014 but in this case, leavened by exceptional craft, it makes a totally satisfying meal.\"]","href_hash":"c70e425e589d11ec9e2c710f6eef757c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c70e425e589d11ec9e2c710f6eef757c"}},
