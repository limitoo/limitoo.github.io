Neither the sport's national governing body,\\u00a0Scottish Rugby, nor Cattigan's club,\\u00a0Stirling County, cited a cause in statements announcing her death.\", \"Anti-vaccine social media users, however, quickly and incorrectly linked the tragedy to COVID-19 vaccines.\", \"In Australia, the Facebook page of Rod Culleton's Great Australian Party posted an article about Cattigan's passing alongside comments implying that the rugby player was \\\"another sportsman\\u2026 or sportswoman\\\" to die in a \\\"pandemic of the vaccinated\\\".\", \"Such claims have prompted Scottish Rugby to\\u00a0confirm\\u00a0to the UK Telegraph that Cattigan's death \\\"had nothing to do with COVID-19 nor the vaccine\\\", with the governing body reportedly working to have what it described as \\\"despicable\\\" posts removed from social media.\", \"Meanwhile, in Australia, Melbourne AFL player Jake Lever was\\u00a0reported\\u00a0to have fainted at a training session on Monday during a \\\"tough running drill\\\".\", \"On social media, posts about Lever's collapse were flooded with comments linking the incident to vaccines.\", \"\\\"Nothing to see here, just another super fit sports

pandemic's wrongest man\\\"\\u00a0\\u2014 and published on a website\\u00a0known\\u00a0to produce \\\"misleading\\\", \\\"inaccurate\\\" and \\\"unsupported\\\" claims, the article points to discrepancies between data released by Pfizer and that of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).\", \"According to the article, while Pfizer had reported 15 deaths among vaccine recipients and 14 among those given a placebo during a clinical trial, data later released by the FDA put the figures at 21 and 17 for the data collection period of November 2020 to March 2021.\", \"\\\"Pfizer somehow miscounted \\u2014 or publicly misreported, or both \\u2014 the number of deaths in one of the most important clinical trials in the history of medicine,\\\" Berenson's article states.\", \"But as the\\u00a0CSIRO's Rob Grenfell\\u00a0explained, while the Pfizer results cited in the article referred to a trial undertaken in the US, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Germany and Turkey, the FDA report included a second trial conducted in Germany.\", \"\\\"It appears that the death data comes from the combination of the two submitted studies,\\\" Dr Grenfell said, adding that data may have also been collected past the March cut-off date.\", \"\\\"Either way, it doesn't demonstrate irregularities, and the figures are pretty similar [between those who received the vaccine and those who received the placebo].\\\"Elsewhere online, anti-vaxxers have seized on\\u00a0an article\\u00a0published by the British Medical Journal investigating a whistleblower's complaints that \\\"poor practices\\\" were undertaken by a contractor during Pfizer clinical trials.However, as\\u00a0fact checkers at Lead Stories found, while both Pfizer and the FDA were made aware of allegations surrounding poor clinical practices undertaken by the contractor in 2020, experts said the claims weren't \\\"serious enough to discredit data from the clinical trials\\\".\", \"Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Therapeutic Goods Administration told Fact Check they were aware of the claims made by the Pfizer whistleblower, but noted:\", \"\\\"The Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials were conducted in over 150 sites in multiple countries. The allegations raised in the BMJ article pertain to three sites only (approximately 2 per cent of the trial population) in the United States and there is no suggestion that other sites may be implicated. The overall results are therefore not expected to be impacted.\\\"\", \"The spokesperson added that \\\"the safety and efficacy [of the Pfizer vaccine] demonstrated in clinical trials has been thoroughly substantiated in real world use\\\".\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">In other news: Scott Morrison says there are only four countries in the G20 with a better emissions record than Australia's.

Excluding LULUCF from the calculations or changing the starting year to 1990, when the data begins, would put Australia further behind the pack.\", \"Also, the chosen dataset, though authoritative, didn't include several countries of the G20 listed as developing nations when the convention was signed. Using alternative datasets that include these countries would place Australia behind up to nine G20 countries for emissions reductions.\", \"More problematic was the Prime Minister's use in his comparison of a 2020 figure (\\\"more than 20 per cent\\\") for Australia's emissions record, when data was only available to 2019 for other countries.\", \"The 2020 figure includes the effect of the pandemic, which experts told Fact Check contributed to a large drop in emissions worldwide.\", \"If a like-for-like comparison were able to be made using 2020 data for all countries, it is\\u00a0possible Australia's ranking could have slipped further.\", \"Edited by Ellen McCutchan, with thanks to Olivia Thomson and Matt Harvey\", \"Got a fact that needs checking?
