Yes, it assembled a winning national majority in the 2020 presidential election, but it has struggled to sustain itself at every other level of government.\", \"The Republican Party controls the majority of states and state legislatures, holds a modest advantage in the fight for control of the House ahead of the 2022 midterm elections and holds a substantial advantage in the fight for control of the Senate on account of the chamber\\u2019s rural bias. It also has a 6-3 majority on the Supreme Court and can more easily win the Electoral College \\u2014 and thus the presidency \\u2014 without winning the majority of votes, as it did in 2000 and 2016.\", \"Everyone, within the Democratic Party, can see the problem. The question is who, or what, is to blame. For the last year, the answer from many moderate Democrats \\u2014 and a sympathetic coterie of journalists, commentators and strategists \\u2014 is that progressives have sailed the ship aground with their views on race, crime, immigration and education, which alienate potential swing voters, including working-class and blue-collar Hispanics.\", \"Writing on this problem for The Atlantic, Ron Brownstein quotes the demographer and election analyst Ruy Teixeira, who argues that \\u201cThe more working class voters see their values as being at variance with the Democratic Party brand, the less likely it is that Democrats will see due credit for even their measures that do provide benefits to working class voters.\\u201d\", \"In a similar piece, my colleague Tom Edsall quotes William Galston of Brookings, who also argues that progressives threaten to limit efforts to win blue-collar support and that \\u201cSome progressives, I fear, would rather be the majority in a minority party than the minority in a majority party.\\u201d\", \"It is true that some progressives \\u2014 either Democratic lawmakers or affiliated activists \\u2014 hold unpopular views or use unpopular language. It is also true that Republicans have amplified this to some electoral success. But missing in this conversation is one inconvenient fact.\", \"Progressives are not actually in the driver\\u2019s seat of the Democratic Party.\", \"It\\u2019s easy to think otherwise. Even the most sober version of this critique makes it sound as if the Democratic Party is in the grip of its most left-wing officials and constituents. But it isn\\u2019t \\u2014 to the dismay and frustration of those officials and constituents.\", \"The president of the United States, and leader of the Democratic Party, is Joe Biden, the standard-bearer for a bygone era of centrist governance and aisle-crossing compromise, who made his mark in domestic politics as a drug warrior in the 1980s and a \\u201claw and order\\u201d Democrat in the 1990s.\", \"The speaker of the House is Nancy Pelosi, a long-serving liberal establishmentarian. Her leadership team \\u2014 the majority leader, Steny Hoyer; the majority whip, James Clyburn; the assistant speaker, Katherine Clark; and the Democratic caucus chairman, Hakeem Jeffries \\u2014 are similarly positioned in the center-left of the Democratic Party. The same is true of Chuck Schumer, the majority leader in the Senate, as well as the people who run the various organizations of the institutional Democratic Party.\", \"Although the share of progressives within the Democratic Party is much larger than the share of progressives writ large (12 percent of the party versus 6 percent nationally, according to the most recent political typology survey from the Pew Research Center), the large majority of Democrats are moderate to moderately liberal on most issues. That\\u2019s why \\u2014 and how \\u2014 Joe Biden won the nomination for president in the first place, easily beating his more left-wing opponents in the South Carolina primary and rallying much of the rest of the party behind him on Super Tuesday and beyond.\", \"In office, Biden has led from the center of the Democratic Party. His main legislative achievement so far, Covid relief notwithstanding, is a bipartisan infrastructure bill. The next phase of his agenda, the Build Back Better plan, now rests in the hands of the most conservative Democrats in Congress. He does not celebrate violent protests; he denounces them. He supports law enforcement and the criminal justice system \\u2014 see his comments on the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict \\u2014 and avoids most cultural battles. This is true, as well, of most elected Democrats in Washington.\", \"There was a battle for control of the Democratic Party, and the moderates won. They hold the power and they direct the message. But despite this victory, moderate Democrats and their allies can\\u2019t seem to take responsibility for the party\\u2019s fortunes. When faced with defeats \\u2014 as they were, last month, when Terry McAuliffe fell to Glenn Youngkin in the race to succeed Ralph Northam as governor of Virginia \\u2014 they blame the left. It\\u2019s the same song, each time. If progressives would just stop alienating the public, then they could make gains and put power back in Democratic hands. Somehow, the people in the passenger\\u2019s seat of the Democratic Party are always and forever responsible for the driver\\u2019s failure to reach their shared destination.\", \"Writing for his newsletter, the journalist Osita Nwanevu made a version of this point earlier in the year. Progressive politicians and activists may be occasionally off-message but in the main, \\u201cThe simple truth is that most of the things moderate liberals tend to argue Democrats should be doing and saying are, in fact, being done and said by the Biden administration, Democratic leaders in Congress, and the vast majority of Democratic elected officials.\\u201d\", \"If, despite their influence, moderate Democrats are not satisfied with the state of their party, then they might want to turn their critical eye on themselves. What they\\u2019ll find are a few fundamental problems that may help explain the party\\u2019s current predicament.\", \"After all, 2020 was not the first year that Democrats fell short of their expectations. They did so in 2010, when moderates had an even stronger grip on the party, as well as in 2014 and 2016. Here, again, I\\u2019ll echo Nwanevu. Despite pitching his administration to the moderate middle \\u2014 despite his vocal critiques of \\u201cidentity politics,\\u201d his enthusiastic patriotism and his embrace of the most popular Democratic policies on offer \\u2014 Barack Obama could not arrest the Democratic Party\\u2019s slide with blue-collar voters. For the last decade, in other words, the \\u201cthe Democratic Party\\u2019s electoral prospects have been in decline for reasons unattributable to progressive figures and ideas that arrived on the political scene practically yesterday.\\u201d\", \"Perhaps the problem, then, lies less with the rhetoric (or existence) of progressive Democrats and more with any number of transformations in the material circumstances of American life and the response \\u2014 or lack thereof \\u2014 from the Democrats with the power to do something. What was the Democratic Party\\u2019s response to a generation of neoliberal economic restructuring? What was its response to the near-total collapse of private-sector unions? What was its response to the declining fortunes of American workers and the upward redistribution of American wealth?\", \"The answer, for most of the last 30 years, is that the moderate Democrats who led the party have either acquiesced in these trends or, as in the case of the Clinton administration, actively pushed them along. And to the extent that these Democrats offered policies targeted to working Americans, they very often failed to deliver on their promises.\", \"The result, as David Dayen of The American Prospect notes in \\u201cThe Case for Deliverism,\\u201d is that \\u201ccynicism finds a breeding ground. People tune out the Democratic message as pretty words in a speech. Eventually, Democratic support gets ground down to a nub, surfacing only in major metropolitan areas that have a cultural affinity for liberalism.\\u201d These Democrats, in their failure to deliver, lend credence to the view that Washington is more a hindrance than a help. We can see this right now, as moderate and conservative Democratic resistance to the most ambitious parts of Biden\\u2019s agenda has bogged down the entire party and hurt its overall standing.\", \"Read in this light, the frequent focus on progressives as the cause of Democratic woes looks less like hard-nosed analysis and more like excuse-making. And my sense is that this excuse-making will only get worse as Republicans weaponize the institutions of American politics to entrench their power and lay the conditions for durable minority rule.\", \"Right now, the moderate Democrats who run the party have a narrow and slipping hold on Congress against an opposition that relies on structural advantages, which could be mitigated, or at least undermined, with federal power. They have failed to act, and there\\u2019s no sign, so far, that anything will change.\", \"If and when Democrats lose one or both chambers of Congress \\u2014 and when we all face the consequences of their failure \\u2014 I am confident that we\\u2019ll hear, once again, how it\\u2019s everyone\\u2019s fault but their own.\"]","href_hash":"e9194b9a59a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e9194b9a59a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}},
