It will require at least $1.5 million to make their plan happen.\", \"Critical's unique recycling technology allows it to process any used plastic product, even if it's been contaminated. Then it can upcycle that waste into beautifully designed products such as furniture, large interior wall panels and building materials which can be used in retail or hospitality fitouts.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/285896/eight_col_recycling-south-side-start-up.jpg?1644110471\\\" alt=\\\"Critical plastic recycling startup co-founders Adam Ransfield and Rui Peng.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nCritical plastic recycling startup co-founders Adam Ransfield and Rui Peng, with some of their products. \\nPhoto: Supplied/ Local Democracy Reporting - Justin Latif\\n</div>\", \"Critical is already contracted to take some waste from Auckland Council's recycling centres as well as from the soft plastics collection bins you see outside Countdown supermarkets.\", \"But as the company increases its capacity, Ransfield said not only will it stop single-use plastic wrappings and bottles going into landfill, it will also process more of the commercial waste which makes up 83 percent of plastic rubbish.\", \"\\\"In Aotearoa there are 24 different types of plastic waste and the current infrastructure is only able to take about three of those types, whereas we're able to process all 24 types,\\\" he explained.\", \"\\\"With the right commercial partners, we'll be capturing all types of waste streams that are not recyclable in the current infrastructure to create our products and deliver that at a scalable, national level.\\\"\", \"The next step is convincing a group of investors to come on board. Peng said the 12-week Startmate programme, which ends in April, will be crucial to this aim.\", \"\\\"We're aiming to raise $1.5 million by the end of it, but the accelerator programme significantly increases our chance of doing this as they can help us by tapping into their network of more than 1000 alumni businesses, as well as a range of other corporate partners.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/268234/eight_col_Critical4.jpg?1625443240\\\" alt=\\\"Rui Peng with the plastic waste that gets recycled, and a table and chair after its been recycled and turned into furniture. \\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nRui Peng with the plastic waste that gets recycled, and a table and chair after its been recycled and turned into furniture. \\nPhoto: Justin Latif / Supplied\\n</div>\", \"As they sit on the cusp of becoming a significant player in the recycling market, Ransfield admits he thought \\\"it was over\\\" when the tornado hit.\", \"But Peng said his parents came to New Zealand looking for a better life after living in relative poverty in China, and seeing how his parents straggled so hard for many years to establish themselves was a source of inspiration in his own challenges.\", \"\\\"When the storm hit, I think we had invested close to $250,000, which we had raised over the years from grants and government funding,\\\" Peng said.\", \"\\\"So it was pretty emotionally devastating.
