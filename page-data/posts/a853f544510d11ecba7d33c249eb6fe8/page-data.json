And what does that freedom look like for a contemporary Black artist? Amanda Williams has recently been asking herself these very questions. A Chicago-based visual artist who trained as an architect, Williams, 47, is known for her pieces exploring the nuances of color, both racial and aesthetic. Her breakout work was \\u201cColor(ed) Theory,\\u201d a 2014-16 series in which she painted eight condemned houses on Chicago\\u2019s South Side in vivid, culturally coded shades, such as \\u201cUltrasheen,\\u201d a dark turquoise that matches the hue of a Black hair-care product, and \\u201cCrown Royal Bag,\\u201d a purplish pigment that mirrors the packaging of a popular whisky.\", \"In a 2018 TED Talk, Williams discussed how we perceive color \\u2014 specifically, how our perceptions are determined by context. One example, she said, was redlining \\u2014 federal housing maps from the 1930s marked neighborhoods inhabited by Black Chicagoans as red, contributing to policies that prevented many residents from securing loans \\u2014 which weaponized color and resulted in underinvestment. When the actress Joaquina Kalukango, 32, heard the speech, she was awe-struck. Kalukango is no stranger to powerful works of art: Last year, she received a Tony nomination for best leading actress in a play for her work in Jeremy O. Harris\\u2019s searing, passionately debated drama \\u201cSlave Play,\\u201d which is set on a plantation and follows a trio of modern-day interracial couples whose relationships are stymied by conflicting views on race.\", \"One rainy morning in October, Kalukango met Williams at the latter\\u2019s studio in Chicago\\u2019s Pilsen neighborhood. Kalukango was days away from starting a Chicago run of \\u201cParadise Square,\\u201d a musical about the 1863 Manhattan draft riots, in which Irish immigrants turned on the Black neighbors with whom they\\u2019d previously peacefully coexisted. (It\\u2019s headed to Broadway early next year.) Meanwhile, Williams is expanding on \\u201cWhat Black Is This, You Say?,\\u201d an ongoing, multiplatform series of abstract paintings inspired by cultural touchstones and observations related to the Black experience that she showed at Art Basel in Miami Beach this month.\", \"Amid laughter, Williams and Kalukango talked generational differences, the desire to be \\u201cregular\\u201d and the blurry line between artistic genius and madness.\", \"AMANDA WILLIAMS: Twenty twenty was a mess. I was contemplating Kool-Aid [the subject of one of her latest paintings] and laughing about it, and then the whole world was like, \\u201cHow are you feeling about being Black, segregation and systemic racism?\\u201d People were like, \\u201cI want to help, right this minute.\\u201d I thought, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know how I feel right now. I was actually doing something else, and now I\\u2019m going to cry.\\u201d It\\u2019s a little easier now. We\\u2019re farther away from it. How did that feel for you?\", \"JOAQUINA KALUKANGO: It\\u2019s interesting, because \\u201cSlave Play\\u201d opened [on Broadway in October 2019] before the country had its racial awakening. There was a lot of aggression toward our production. There was a lot of pushback, specifically within the Black community. [Some who had seen the play, and many others who hadn\\u2019t, found it offensive in its use of antebellum role play and inappropriately sexually graphic; one online petition calling for the show\\u2019s shutdown referred to it as \\u201canti-Black sentiment disguised as art.\\u201d] But after audiences saw the show, there was so much conversation. On the streets, people would come up to me and talk about it. That was affirming. It was also exhausting. The greatest thing that helped me was when we had a \\u201cBlack Out\\u201d night \\u2014 the audience was all Black. I heard the show in a different way: It was funny. There was this release of Black people finally being able to feel like this show was for them, as opposed to sitting next to someone and wondering, \\u201cWhy are you laughing at this?\\u201d How can we get Black people to feel free regardless of who\\u2019s sitting next to them? How can we fully enjoy ourselves in situations and experience art without feeling like other people are watching us? It\\u2019s always a struggle.\", \"A.W.: I\\u2019ve thought a lot about the freedom question. Take Kanye West. He\\u2019s obviously experiencing some mental health issues. But also, he has a level of mastery and talent that borders on complete freedom. He says inappropriate things, and maybe he doesn\\u2019t even understand what freedom is. But if you\\u2019ve ascended beyond practically any other brown human you\\u2019ve ever met, and you can buy Wyoming, isn\\u2019t that free? [West has purchased two huge ranches there.] He just does what he wants. [For the listening party for \\u201cDonda,\\u201d his recent album named after his mother, who died in 2007,] Kanye was like, \\u201cI\\u2019m going to recreate my mom\\u2019s house in [the Chicago Bears stadium] Soldier Field.\\u201d Everybody was confused. But I thought, \\u201cThis could be a mental moment, but it\\u2019s also pure creativity.\\u201d Every artist who you might say is the most free, in terms of pushing their craft to the edge, is always called crazy.\", \"J.K.: Did anyone tell you, early in your career, that you had to work within certain boundaries? Did you feel pressure to be a certain type of artist?\", \"A.W.: I trained as an architect [at Cornell University]. My parents were in a panic that I might be an artist. They were like, \\u201cArtists who make money are called architects.\\u201d In a sense, that was a boundary. Then, I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area right at the height of the dot-com boom. The economy was great. Projects were bountiful; jobs were plentiful. I was able to live out this architectural career that I thought would take 30 years in five or six. Then I had a boss who said, \\u201cIf you could be doing anything in the world right now, what would it be?\\u201d She thought I was going to say, \\u201cTaking over your company.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cPainting.\\u201d She encouraged me to try it. And the Bay Area lent itself to that. Everybody had an idea. Google was born when I lived in the Bay. That kind of environment helped me take the leap.If I had to do it again, I wouldn\\u2019t. I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cWhat if it doesn\\u2019t work? How am I going to eat?\\u201d But back then, I was just like, \\u201cOh, I\\u2019ll eat some avocados, it\\u2019s California.\\u201d There\\u2019s no moment I remember when somebody said I couldn\\u2019t do it. Well, I\\u2019m sure there was, but I blocked it out. My friend and I were just talking about how our generation tended to dismiss racist comments or sexual advances. We just kept moving. Your generation does not tolerate nonsense. Is that how it feels?\", \"J.K.: Definitely. The new show I\\u2019m in, \\u201cParadise Square,\\u201d is a musical that has been in development for a long time. There was always a struggle to figure out whose lens the story should be told through. Now, it finally centers around this free Black woman in New York who owned a bar in 1863 [Nelly Freeman, the role Kalukango is playing]. We have an E.D.I. [equity, diversity and inclusion] person who talks about terminology. One day in rehearsal, an assistant said, \\u201cJoaquina, we\\u2019re not going to say the L-word in this sentence.\\u201d I was like, \\u201c\\u2009\\u2018Let\\u2019? \\u2018Listen\\u2019?\\u2009\\u201d\", \"A.W.: Which \\u201cL\\u201d?\", \"J.K.: It was \\u201clynch.\\u201d I said, \\u201cWhat? We\\u2019re just not going to say this?\\u201d But the idea was, we don\\u2019t have to say that word until it\\u2019s absolutely necessary. I thought, \\u201cWell, this is a whole new way of being, even for me. That word doesn\\u2019t bother my spirit, but it\\u2019s bothering other people\\u2019s spirits.\\u201d It\\u2019s a different world from when I was growing up in Atlanta.\", \"A.W.: How does that impact your craft? Does it trip you up to have to be mindful of words in a way that maybe you hadn\\u2019t been before?\", \"J.K.: We\\u2019re all more careful. Everyone\\u2019s fragile. We\\u2019re still in the midst of a pandemic, and so many issues have come up for so many people. We\\u2019re all giving each other a lot of care and grace in this new era that we\\u2019re trying to build, this new era of theater we\\u2019re trying to make. But it\\u2019s a bit of a struggle, I\\u2019ll be honest. When you do work that\\u2019s specifically about a very troublesome time \\u2014 and if you look at the Jan. 6 riot [at the U.S. Capitol], it\\u2019s similar to the draft riots \\u2014 you can\\u2019t sugarcoat it. You can\\u2019t run away from it. It\\u2019s always a balance of, how do you tell a story without traumatizing our community?\", \"T: When did you first encounter each other\\u2019s work?\", \"J.K.: I first saw Amanda\\u2019s work in her TED Talk.\", \"A.W.: Oh my God. I had wondered, how did you find out about me? How do you know who I am?\", \"J.K.: I had such a visceral reaction to \\u201cColor(ed) Theory.\\u201d All of it was so much a part of my life, my childhood. Plus, I just love colors. How did you get that concept? What inspired you?\", \"A.W.: I grew up on Chicago\\u2019s South Side and crossed town every day to go to school. Chicago segregation, coupled with the city\\u2019s grid, is perfect for systemic oppression because it sets boundaries, and then we mentally reinforce them. I was hyperaware of color all the time, as in race, thinking, \\u201cThat\\u2019s a Mexican neighborhood.\\u201d \\u201cChinese people are there.\\u201d \\u201cWhite folks do this.\\u201d Things like that. And I\\u2019ve loved [chromatic] color since birth. Then I learned about color in an academic setting.\", \"One summer, while [I was] teaching color theory, a friend joked, \\u201cThey pay you money to teach people what? Red and blue is green?\\u201d I said, \\u201cNo, color theory is a whole science.\\u201d She said, \\u201cYou know colored theory.\\u201d We laughed and I left it alone. A week or two later, I thought, \\u201cI do know colored theory.\\u201d I spent another few years making sense of it. It seemed so juicy. I started to think, \\u201cWhat things make you think of the color first?\\u201d There\\u2019s a story I told in the TED Talk: I met a gentleman who grew up near the \\u201cCrown Royal Bag\\u201d house. He thought the purple house meant Prince was coming. Even after I told him about my art, he said, \\u201cYou wait and see. Prince might show up and perform right here.\\u201d Suddenly, he had hope for that vacant lot, in a way that maybe he didn\\u2019t before. To me, that was success.\", \"J.K.: It was brilliant.\", \"A.W.: At first, I wasn\\u2019t as familiar with your work, but when I started to look into it, I was like, \\u201cHow could I have missed all of this? These are the exact same things I\\u2019m thinking and talking about.\\u201d I\\u2019m excited about how we translate these thoughts across mediums \\u2014 theater, performance, music, architecture, sculpture, writing.\", \"T: You both have long been working artists, but your breakout pieces \\u2014 \\u201cSlave Play\\u201d and \\u201cColor(ed) Theory\\u201d \\u2014 made you famous. Has that affected your work? Do you feel an added responsibility now?\", \"J.K.: An actor starts off auditioning for nearly everything. We\\u2019re told \\u201cno\\u201d 99 out of 100 times. Initially, the roles I took were just what ended up coming to me. But I also believe that what\\u2019s for you is for you. When you\\u2019re on a path that you\\u2019re aligned with, more things start coming your way. Now I am adamant that Black women see many facets of ourselves, that we are depicted with a wide gamut of emotions: the unflattering and unraveling parts but also joyful and loving, peaceful and gentle. I want it all for us, at every possible moment. I\\u2019m trying to ensure I show Black women as full human beings \\u2014 not stereotypes, not archetypes. We\\u2019re not strong all the time. Yes, our ancestors had to survive, but there was always joy in the midst of all that pain.\", \"A.W.: You also have to give yourself permission to be an artist. That\\u2019s hard because there is a burden. You know how few people have the same opportunities, so you always want to make sure you\\u2019ve done justice. At the same time, you have to take the pressure off. Our society thinks about the home run, the slam dunk \\u2014 the idea that each thing you do must be better than the last. But if you look at any creative being\\u2019s full oeuvre, there are ups and downs. Artists have to continue to understand themselves and improve their craft for themselves. It makes me think of this great artist Raymond Saunders, who lives in the Bay Area. He taught an advanced painting class, and I was teaching at the same school, so he invited me to his class. I went \\u2014 and the students were eating handmade pastries from this beautiful boutique in Berkeley or something. I\\u2019m like, \\u201cWhat is this?\\u201d And they\\u2019re like, \\u201cHe told us he can\\u2019t teach us how to paint, he can teach us how to live.\\u201d It was mind-blowing. Maybe we don\\u2019t have to nail it every single week of every year. Maybe we just nail it every five years. Maybe we can sleep one of those years.\", \"J.K.: I always think, \\u201cDo we ever have the space to be mediocre and figure things out?\\u201d I don\\u2019t want to be Black girl magic every day. Sometimes I want to be regular. Just regular Black. [All laugh]\", \"A.W.: Regular Black. I\\u2019m going to make a painting based on that.\", \"T: How do you two define success right now?\", \"A.W.: Just being the best me. I don\\u2019t worry so much if my work is well received or if it garners accolades. That sounds so cheesy. My husband jokes, \\u201cWell, that\\u2019s nice to say after you\\u2019ve gotten the accolades.\\u201d [All laugh]\", \"J.K.: I love originating and creating new roles. For me, success is knowing that there are girls coming up who can use work I\\u2019ve done as audition pieces for colleges. In \\u201cSlave Play,\\u201d my character, Kaneisha, has a 10- or 15-minute monologue. She takes up space for almost the entire last act. I\\u2019d never seen anything like it onstage before. For a long time, it was hard to find material or scene work that included multiple Black characters. It was hard finding those plays [when I studied at the Juilliard School]. It\\u2019s all about the next generation for me. If at any point I can make someone feel more free, more confident in their abilities, that\\u2019s the win.\", \"This interview has been edited and condensed.\"]","href_hash":"a853f544510d11ecba7d33c249eb6fe8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a853f544510d11ecba7d33c249eb6fe8"}},
