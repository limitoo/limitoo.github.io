Edgar Hoover, during the investigation of the murder.\", \"A motion to vacate the convictions, filed by the Manhattan district attorney\\u2019s office, said numerous F.B.I. reports were never disclosed to the defense, including some that discussed federal informants who were present in the ballroom where Malcolm X was killed.\", \"The documents suggest the bureau, on Mr. Hoover\\u2019s orders, purposely kept information about its informants secret from the local authorities.\", \"\\u201cWe now have reports revealing that on orders from director J. Edgar Hoover himself, the F.B.I. ordered multiple witnesses not to tell police or prosecutors that they were in fact F.B.I. informants,\\u201d Mr. Vance said in court on Thursday.\", \"The roles of the F.B.I. and Mr. Hoover in Malcolm X\\u2019s killing have come under scrutiny before. In 1964, one year before the civil rights leader was killed, Mr. Hoover wrote to the agency\\u2019s office in New York, asking it to \\u201cdo something about Malcolm X,\\u201d according to one F.B.I. document released years ago.\", \"The documents unearthed during the Manhattan district attorney\\u2019s review of the trial offered other new details. Four of the F.B.I. reports summarize interviews with a witness to the murder who had been a federal informant and testified at the trial, the motion said. It did not name the witness.\", \"Another document, dated Feb. 25, 1965, said the bureau had ordered its local offices not to disclose to the New York police the fact that any witnesses were federal informants, the motion to vacate the convictions said.\", \"Mr. Vance\\u2019s review found no evidence that the killing was orchestrated by the government. But it also did not answer broader questions about the role of the federal government and the police in the assassination.\", \"An F.B.I. spokesman said on Wednesday that the agency cooperated with the Manhattan district attorney\\u2019s investigation but declined to comment on its outcome. Mr. Hoover died in 1972.\", \"Still, the inability of investigators to resolve questions about the roles the F.B.I. and New York police played added to demands for a broader investigation into Malcolm X\\u2019s assassination, as the co-founder of the Innocence Project, which participated in the review, called for on Thursday.\", \"The co-founder, Barry Scheck, said that the exoneration represented an official acknowledgment that the F.B.I. and police had \\u201csuppressed exculpatory evidence,\\u201d and that if they had not done so, \\u201cthe history of the Civil Rights Movement in this country\\u201d would have changed.\"]","href_hash":"7bfbba4848bd11ecaddded3101c0aae9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7bfbba4848bd11ecaddded3101c0aae9"}},
