It said its ongoing investigation indicated the accounts originated in Russia and were attempting to disrupt the public conversation around the conflict in Ukraine.\", \"In a blog post on Monday, Meta attributed the hacking efforts to a group known as Ghostwriter, which it said successfully gained access to the targets' social media accounts. Meta said the hackers attempted to post YouTube videos from the accounts portraying Ukrainian troops as weakened, including one video which claimed to show Ukrainian soldiers coming out of a forest and flying a white flag of surrender.\", \"Ukrainian cybersecurity officials said on Friday that hackers from neighboring Belarus were targeting the private email addresses of Ukrainian military personnel \\\"and related individuals,\\\" blaming a group code-named \\\"UNC1151.\\\" The US cybersecurity firm FireEye has previously connected the group with Ghostwriter activities.\", \"Meta's security team said it had taken steps to secure targeted accounts and had blocked the phishing domains used by the hackers. It declined to give the names of any of the targets but said it had alerted users where possible.\", \"Meta said the separate influence campaign, which used a number of fictitious personas, claimed to be based in Kyiv and ran a small number of websites masquerading as independent news outlets. These outlets published claims about the West betraying Ukraine and Ukraine being a failed state.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/139073/eight_col_075_zawrzel-peoplecr220225_npORZ.jpg?1645940344\\\" alt=\\\"Refugees from Ukraine are seen after crossing Ukrainian-Polish border due to Russian military attack on Ukraine.

Neither NewsFront nor SouthFront immediately responded to requests for comment.\", \"Meta declined to give a number of impressions or views for the influence campaign's content but said it had seen a \\\"very low level\\\" of shares, posts or reactions. It said the campaign had fewer than 4000 Facebook accounts following one or more of its pages and fewer than 500 accounts following one or more of its Instagram accounts. It did not say how long the campaigns had been active on its platforms.\", \"It said the campaign had also used Alphabet Inc's (Google-owner) YouTube, Telegram and Russian social media sites Odnoklassniki and VK. YouTube, Telegram and VK, which also owns Odnoklassniki, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\", \"The crisis in Ukraine has seen escalating clashes between Moscow and major tech companies. On Friday, Russia said it would partially restrict access to Facebook, a move Meta said came after it refused a government request to stop the independent fact-checking of several Russian state media outlets. On Saturday, Twitter also said its service was being restricted for some Russian users.\", \"According to an Al Jazeera report, Ukraine's Health Ministry stated on Sunday that at least 352 civilians, including 14 children, have been killed since the Russian invasion began.\", \"Russia calls its actions in Ukraine a \\\"special operation.\\\"\", \"Ukraine has been buffeted by digital intrusions and denial-of-service actions both in the run-up to and during the Russian invasion. Several big tech companies have announced measures to bolster the security and privacy of their users in the country.\", \"Meta, which has in recent days made changes like removing the ability to view and search the friends lists of Facebook accounts in Ukraine, said on Monday it was also making this change in Russia in response to public reports of civil society and protesters being targeted.\", \"- Reuters\"]","href_hash":"d239634498cf11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d239634498cf11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
