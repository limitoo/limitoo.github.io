It also comes amid a greater awareness about racial bias seeping into the criminal justice system.\", \"Mr. Gilbert, 56, who was arrested in 2018, and his lawyer argued that having both the grand jury and the trial jury deliberate in the \\u201cinherently prejudicial\\u201d room \\u2014 which had been named after the United Daughters of the Confederacy \\u2014 violated his right to a fair trial, an impartial jury, due process and equal protection, according to court documents.\", \"The three-judge appeals court agreed and reversed a 2020 lower court ruling that denied Mr. Gilbert\\u2019s request for a new trial. The 31-page appeals court ruling discussed the power of symbols, flags in particular, to communicate messages about a government\\u2019s identity and values.\", \"\\u201cThe flag displayed in the jury room is no different,\\u201d the court ruled. \\u201cIts original purpose was to \\u2018knit the loyalty\\u2019 of those in the Confederate states \\u2018to a flag\\u2019 that conveyed the political ideals of the Confederacy.\\u201d\", \"The ruling explored the ideals of the Confederacy by examining documents created at the time of the rebel government\\u2019s founding. Articles of secession identified the reasons behind the decision of the Confederate states to leave the union, the ruling said, and considered the right to hold Black people in chattel slavery as central to Southern life.\", \"\\u201cThese documents not only defended slavery, but endorsed it fully using dehumanizing and racist language,\\u201d the court wrote, adding that slavery and the subjugation of Black people \\u201care inextricably intertwined with the Confederacy and the symbols thereof.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSuch ideals, however, are antithetical to the American system of jurisprudence and cannot be tolerated,\\u201d it said.\", \"Valena Beety, a law professor and deputy director of the Academy for Justice at Arizona State University, said that courts were now more aware about how bias could be introduced into the criminal justice system and were more eager to try to stamp it out.\", \"\\u201cOne way of going about that is making sure you have more diverse juries,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut this seems like another way, where you\\u2019re really looking at the influence of this memorabilia that you\\u2019re surrounded by the whole time you\\u2019re deliberating on this case.\\u201d\", \"She added, \\u201cSymbols can allow us to be complacent or at ease with our own bias instead of challenging it, recognizing it and actually thinking about it.\\u201d\", \"It was unclear on Saturday whether prosecutors would appeal the ruling to the Tennessee Supreme Court. They did not immediately respond to messages.\", \"A lawyer for Mr. Gilbert, Evan Baddour, declined an interview request. He said in a text that he was pleased with the ruling, but that \\u201cthere\\u2019s still a lot of work to be done, and we will continue to fight.\\u201d\", \"The appeals court ruling mostly focused on the Confederate memorabilia in the jury room. Prosecutors said that Mr. Gilbert waived his right to object by not raising the issue before the trial, but the appeals court said in its ruling that \\u201cthe location of jury deliberations is not one of the issues that must be raised prior to trial.\\u201d\", \"Arguing that the items in the room did not improperly influence jurors, prosecutors also said that another jury in an unrelated case had deliberated in the same room and had acquitted Mr. Gilbert.\", \"\\u201cThat the defendant was acquitted by a different jury on unrelated charges has no bearing at all on the question whether the jury in this case was exposed to extraneous prejudicial information or improper outside influence,\\u201d the appellate ruling said.\", \"Michael Working, who was president of the Tennessee Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers when the group filed a brief in support of Mr. Gilbert\\u2019s position, said the ruling put the onus on the government to prove that the deliberation room was free of coercion and influence, not on the defendant to prove that it wasn\\u2019t.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s a big step,\\u201d he said.\", \"He said the implications of this ruling could extend beyond jury deliberation rooms. He wondered about the Confederate statues that greet visitors at Tennessee\\u2019s courthouses and the messages they conveyed.\", \"\\u201cNow the issue may turn to, how far is that sphere of influence?\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"d2ed6d34553711ec90cb29d9477ce482"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d2ed6d34553711ec90cb29d9477ce482"}},
