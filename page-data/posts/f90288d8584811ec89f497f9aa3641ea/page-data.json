If you encourage vaccination refusal, you are adding to the danger.\", \"New Covid cases are much higher among the unvaccinated, and new variants are fostered by anyone who gets sick. Hey, we\\u2019re up to Omicron.\", \"Politicians and public figures who discourage responsible behavior \\u2014 getting vaccinated \\u2014 are deluded or self-serving, pandering to a significant minority that stands in the way of the human community. We should blame them. We should reject them.\", \"Please, get vaccinated.\", \"Michael BuchmanHighland Park, N.J.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Bret Stephens\\u2019s assessment of the \\u201cCovid blame games\\u201d is both accurate and timely. With over 5.2 million deaths worldwide due to Covid, including more than 790,000 deaths in the United States, this virus has proved that it does not differentiate between Democrats and Republicans, blue states and red states. It is an equal opportunity virus. People are losing their lives and families are tragically losing loved ones, regardless of their political ideologies.\", \"As the pandemic continues wreaking havoc on a global scale, it behooves us to work collaboratively to combat this dangerous virus. Impugning others for its rapid proliferation is misguided and does a tremendous disservice to the countless individuals who have been adversely affected. We are all in this together.\", \"N. Aaron TroodlerBala Cynwyd, Pa.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Bret Stephens cherry-picks his way through a blizzard of factoids in an attempt to paper over who is principally responsible for our continuing deluge of Covid deaths. More than a thousand people in the United States have been dying of Covid-related causes on most days in recent months, at least 90 percent of whom are unvaccinated.\", \"Astonishingly, Republicans have successfully used the vaccination issue as a political cudgel, with the result that, according to a Gallup survey, 92 percent of Democrats are vaccinated whereas only 56 percent of Republicans have been protected.\", \"One might reasonably question the political wisdom of a strategy that seems to remove hundreds of supporters per day from your party.\", \"Carl MezoffStamford, Conn.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Thanks to Bret Stephens for speaking against the blaming and politicization of Covid. Would that the pundits and commentators apply the same logic and moral good sense to all the important topics such as climate, health, child poverty, infrastructure, enhancing democracy, etc.\", \"All too often the pundits present these as oversimplified red or blue issues. As readers we all need to reject the simplicity, hyperbolic outrage, and single-sided and often even mendacious arguments that flood the media. Let\\u2019s leave the cheering and booing to the football stadium.\", \"Donald StoverPoland, Maine\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cOpioids Feel Like Love. That\\u2019s Why They\\u2019re Deadly in Tough Times,\\u201d by Maia Szalavitz (Opinion guest essay, Dec. 8):\", \"Regarding Ms. Szalavitz\\u2019s point that we will not arrest our way out of the opioid epidemic, the good news is that we may yet find innovative ways to reduce harm and minimize overdose deaths. Apps like \\u201cbSafe\\u201d allow people to stay connected while using opioids, so someone can call 911 in case of an emergency.\", \"Fentanyl test strips and naloxone are now available free of charge or at low cost without a prescription, so anyone who uses opioids or lives with someone who has a substance use disorder can save their own or another person\\u2019s life.\", \"University of Washington researchers have even developed a wearable device to detect and reverse opioid overdoses. The device, worn on the stomach, senses when a person stops breathing and injects naloxone.\", \"All these innovations will help reduce deaths. However, to keep people in long-term \\u201cactive recovery,\\u201d as opposed to active addiction, we need more support for programs that foster social connections, promote the many pathways of recovery, and improve life skills and resiliency so that people in recovery \\u2014 particularly youths and young adults \\u2014 can lead lives of meaning and purpose.\", \"Ann HerbstDenverThe writer is executive director of Young People in Recovery.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"There have been many thoughtful analyses of abortion before the Supreme Court, but I haven\\u2019t seen any that address the significant burden placed on women who have inadequate access to good birth control. Certainly, there are many cases where birth control was not an issue \\u2014 rape, birth control failure, severe fetal malformations \\u2014 but way too many abortions happen because the woman didn\\u2019t have consistent, affordable access to reliable birth control.\", \"I think abortion should be an option, but only a last resort. Let\\u2019s also try to address availability of birth control.\", \"Christine DottererSunbury, Pa.The writer is a retired family doctor.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"If only the anti-abortion movement invested one iota of its energy to fight gun violence as it did to end abortions, we would have many fewer grieving parents today who have lost children they loved and cherished.\", \"Larry S.
