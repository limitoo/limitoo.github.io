Lukashenko. \", \"The Belarusian authorities certainly have helped stoke the crisis, offering easy tourist visas to thousands of Iraqis and easing their way to the border with Poland. \", \"But social media, particularly Facebook, also have given Mr. Lukashenko a vital assist, as an unpredictable accelerant to the hopes and illusions of people who have fallen prey to the empty promises of profiteers and charlatans on the internet. \", \"Some were in it for money, promising to smuggle migrants across borders for hefty fees; some appeared to bask in the attention they received as online \\u201cinfluencers\\u201d for sharing information; others seemed motivated by a genuine desire to help people suffering. There has been no evidence to suggest a coordinated campaign by Mr. Lukashenko to target migrants with fake information online.\", \"Fake news on Facebook, said Mr. Faraj, who last week was moved from the border encampment along with 2,000 other denizens of \\u201cthe jungle,\\u201d to a giant nearby warehouse converted into a migrant holding center, \\u201cpoured mud on our heads and destroyed our lives.\\u201d\", \"Since July, activity on Facebook in Arabic and Kurdish related to migration to the E.U. through Belarus has been \\u201cskyrocketing,\\u201d said Monika Richter, head of research and analysis for Semantic Visions, an intelligence firm that tracked social media activity related to the crisis.\", \"\\u201cFacebook exacerbated this humanitarian crisis and now you have all these people who were brought over and explicitly misled and ripped off,\\u201d said Ms. Richter.\", \"Researchers said smugglers openly shared their phone numbers and advertised their services on Facebook, including video testimonials from people said to have reached Germany successfully via Belarus and Poland. In one post, a smuggler advertised \\u201cdaily trips from Minsk to Germany with only a 20 km walking distance.\\u201d The journey, a writer warned in another post on Oct. 19, is \\u201cnot suitable for children due to the cold.\\u201d Another smuggler with the Facebook user name \\u201cVisa Visa\\u201d pitched trips to Germany from Belarus through Poland. The smuggler said the trip would take 8 to 15 hours but added a warning: \\u201cDon\\u2019t call if you are afraid.\\u201d\", \"Last Friday, despite the bitter experience of so many promises on Facebook that turned out to be false, a ripple of excitement swept across despondent people huddled in the warehouse after reports on social media that it was still possible to get into Europe \\u2014 for anyone willing to pay $7,000 to a guide who claimed to know any easy route across the Belarus-Poland frontier and through massed ranks of Polish soldiers and border guards on the other side.\", \"Rekar Hamid, a former math teacher in Iraqi Kurdistan who had already paid around $10,000 to travel agents in Iraq for a \\u201cpackage tour\\u201d that was supposed to get himself, his wife and young child to Europe but only got them locked up in a warehouse, scoffed at the latest offer as yet another scam. \\u201cThey keep saying the door is opening but look where we all are now,\\u201d he said, gesturing toward a mass of people huddled on the concrete floor.\", \"Musa Hama, another Kurd from Iraq confined to the warehouse, lamented that no amount of fact-checking would prevent people grasping at straws of hope provided by Facebook. \\u201cPeople are desperate so they believe anything,\\u201d he said.\", \"The stampede by migrants to Belarus in the hope of getting into the European Union began earlier this year when the authoritarian former Soviet republic relaxed tightfisted visa policies for certain countries, notably Iraq. The relaxation was ostensibly an effort to boost tourism at a time when most Westerners were staying away following a brutal crackdown by Mr. Lukashenko in response a contested presidential election.\", \"Sensing a lucrative business opportunity, travel companies in Iraq\\u2019s semiautonomous Kurdistan Region started advertising on Facebook and other platforms about the availability of visas to Belarus. Smugglers used social media to pitch Belarus as an easy back door to Europe.\", \"Since July, Semantic Visions has identified dozens of Facebook groups created to share information about migration routes and used by smugglers to advertise their services. A private group titled \\u201cMigration of the powerful from Belarus to Europe\\u201d exploded from 13,600 members in early September to roughly 30,000 currently, according to Semantic Visions. Another group, \\u201cBelarus Online,\\u201d grew from 7,700 members to 23,700 during the same period. On Telegram, a messaging and chat room platform, channels devoted to Belarus as a route to Europe have also attracted thousands of members.\", \"\\u201cSocial media platforms \\u2014 especially Facebook \\u2014 have been used as a de facto market for smuggling into the E.U.,\\u201d Semantic Visions concluded in a recent report that has been circulated among European Union officials.\", \"Facebook, now officially known as Meta after a corporate name change, said it prohibited material that facilitates or promotes human smuggling and has dedicated teams to monitor and detect material related to the crisis. It added that the company was working with law enforcement agencies and nongovernmental organizations to counter the flood of fake news relating to migration.\", \"\\u201cPeople smuggling across international borders is illegal and ads, posts, pages or groups that provide, facilitate or coordinate this activity are not allowed on Facebook,\\u201d the company said in an emailed statement. \\u201cWe remove this content as soon as we become aware of it.\\u201d\", \"But the events in Belarus have exposed how, even after Facebook experienced a similar abuse of its services during the European migration crisis in 2015, the company still struggles to keep banned material off its platform, especially in non-English languages.\", \"\\u201cFacebook is not taking their responsibility seriously and as a direct consequence of that we see desperate people in the cold, in the mud, in the forest in Belarus, in a desperate situation, all because they believe the misinformation that was provided to them through Facebook,\\u201d said Jeroen Lenaers, a member of the European Parliament from the Netherlands who is a leader on the legislature\\u2019s committee that handles migration issues.\", \"Untouched by whatever steps Facebook has taken to expunge misleading and potentially dangerous information are people like the Kurdish-German influencer widely known online as Karwan Rawanduzy. Mr. Rawanduzy is a popular figure among would-be migrants to Europe, but his online videos and other reports frequently promote bogus stories, like the claim that Poland would open its border in early November. \", \"Mr. Rawanduzy\\u2019s live posts on a Facebook page named Kurdisch News had more than 100,000 followers before it was disabled in November after the Kurdish-German influencer said a Polish politician had publicly accused him of helping to fuel the crisis. The page also featured videos sent by hungry and cold migrants trapped along the border.\", \"Reached by phone in Hamburg, Germany, Mr. Rawanduzy said he was repeating information about pressure on Poland to open the border that he said had been reported by German media. He blamed smugglers and countries including Poland for the misery faced by migrants and that he was simply trying to help the asylum-seekers.\", \"Mr. Rawanduzy, 42, describes himself as an immigration activist and a former refugee who left Iraq in 2009, two years after a suicide bombing in Erbil wounded him. \", \"Mr. Faraj is still furious that he followed the advice of Mr. Rawanduzy, widely known by his first name, Karwan, by rushing from Minsk back to the border. \\u201cEveryone knows him and everyone follows him,\\u201d he said. He added: \\u201cKarwan tricked us all on Facebook.\\u201d \", \"Mr. Rawanduzy, who also owns a restaurant, said it was \\u201cnot for me to feel bad or guilty\\u201d about people persuaded by his posts. \\u201cIt is up to the Iraqi and Kurdish government to feel bad for all the reasons people want to escape.\\u201d\", \"\"]","href_hash":"f13cb1e64bd211ec83296d2986973fbb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f13cb1e64bd211ec83296d2986973fbb"}},
