Leonard, an astronomer and research specialist at the University of Arizona.\", \"In the months that followed, researchers noted that Leonard was on a trajectory that would take it relatively near to the Earth on its journey towards the sun, and that people may be able to see it with the naked eye by December.\", \"As it happens, comet Leonard is not quite visible to the eye alone, according to EarthSky\\u2014though some keen observers might be able to catch it with clear, dark skies. It is a good comet to spot with telescopes and 10x50 binoculars, though.\", \"The below photos of the comet were captured by photographers based in the U.K. and in Texas, followed by a timelapse from Christopher Becke in Virginia.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948560/comet-leonard.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Comet Leonard, photographed by Will Leverett from Llano County, Texas. (Twitter: @312Will)</div>\", \"From North America and similar latitudes, people should be able to spot Leonard by facing east about 45 minutes before sunrise somewhere below the Big Dipper constellation and the star Arcturus, according to an Eddie Irizarry illustration posted on EarthSky.\", \"That's up to December 12. After that, the best time to spot the comet will be in the early evening after sunset, when the comet might be visible in the southwest as it moves past Venus and Mercury and onwards towards Saturn and Jupiter, according to the Astronomy magazine website.\", \"Comet Leonard has a reported orbital period of around 80,000 years, Astronomy states, meaning it takes that long to pass around the sun. This is because its orbit is highly eccentric, or oval-shaped rather than circular. For us, that means we won't see the comet again for a long time once it disappears back into deep space.\", \"That is, if it survives that long. Observers have noticed that while Comet Leonard appears to have gotten brighter than usual because it's now relatively near to Earth, in reality it's actually fading.\", \"Quanzhi Ye, an astronomer at the University of Maryland, told Space.com that there are a number of guesses as to why the comet is fading, but the most obvious one is that it is splitting up or is likely to do so soon.\", \"Comets are balls of ice, gas and rock that orbit the sun. As they got closer to our star, they heat up and spew material out into space behind them, leaving their trademark tails that can stretch for millions of miles.\", \"Eventually, a comet will evaporate more or less completely. It's still unclear if this is what is happening to Comet Leonard at the moment.\", \"According to NASA, the number of known comets is 3,743, but it's thought there are billions orbiting the sun in total.\"]","href_hash":"7eedc3ea591611eca7182171015f22c1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7eedc3ea591611eca7182171015f22c1"}},
