Mr Bazzi\\u2019s blue Twitter check mark, Mr. Dutton also argued, implied recognition by the social media giant and had led the minister to believe that the post was not just the \\u201crant of somebody randomly on Twitter.\\u201d\", \"A spokeswoman for Twitter did not immediately respond to an email on Wednesday seeking comment.\", \"Justice Richard White ruled in a judgment handed down on Wednesday that the tweet had, indeed, been defamatory. Justice White also rejected Mr. Bazzi\\u2019s defense that he had expressed his honest opinion, saying that neither the article about Mr. Dutton nor the \\u201cshe said, he said\\u201d statement supported the conclusion that Mr. Dutton excused rape.\", \"\\u201cMr. Bazzi may have used the word \\u2018apologist\\u2019 without an understanding of the meaning he was, in fact, conveying,\\u201d Justice White said. \\u201cIf, as I think likely, Mr. Bazzi did not appreciate the effect of his words, it would follow that he did not hold the opinion actually conveyed by the words.\\u201d\", \"The court ordered Mr. Bazzi to pay Mr. Dutton 35,000 Australian dollars (about $25,000) in damages.\", \"Mr. Bazzi said on Twitter that he was \\u201cvery disappointed\\u201d with the ruling and would be taking time to consider his options. Mr. Dutton did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment; nor did Mr. Bazzi\\u2019s lawyer.\", \"The case\\u2019s outcome was not unheard-of in a country with notoriously strict defamation laws, but it was unusual that the defendant was not another politician or a high-profile journalist, said Michael Douglas, a senior lecturer in private law at the University of Western Australia.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s consistent with the theme that this government is content in taking a very heavy-handed approach to online speech that it doesn\\u2019t like,\\u201d he said. He added, \\u201cCases like these are a warning that, unless something changes, we\\u2019re going to see more and more cases like this, and every Australian should tread carefully before they do a quote retweet and call a politician a name.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Dutton has been open about his intent to crack down on misleading or defamatory social media content. In March, he told a local radio station, \\u201cSome of these people who are trending on Twitter or have the anonymity of different Twitter accounts, they\\u2019re out there putting out all these statements and tweets that are frankly defamatory \\u2014 I\\u2019m going to start to pick out some of them to sue.\\u201d\", \"Prime Minister Scott Morrison echoed that sentiment in October, when he vowed that the government would do more to hold social media giants accountable.\", \"\\u201cSocial media has become a coward\\u2019s palace, where people can just go on there, not say who they are, destroy people\\u2019s lives and say the most foul and offensive things to people and do so with impunity,\\u201d Mr. Morrison said.\", \"In May, John Barilaro, then the deputy premier of New South Wales, sued an Australian YouTuber, Jordan Shanks, for defamation, claiming that two videos Mr. Shanks had uploaded incorrectly suggested he was corrupt, had committed perjury and engaged in blackmail. He also said Mr. Shanks had been racist by attacking his Italian heritage, including calling him a \\u201ccon man to the core, powered by spaghetti.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Shanks\\u2019s channel, FriendlyJordies, which has 600,000 subscribers, is known for its comedy and political commentary.\", \"The case was settled out of court this month, according to local news reports. Mr. Shanks apologized to Mr. Barilaro, paid $100,000 in court costs and edited the two videos.\", \"In October and November, Andrew Laming, a Liberal member of Parliament, sent a series of defamation warnings to organizations and individuals \\u2014 including an advocacy organization for older women and a social policy professor \\u2014 over their social media posts about him. In March, the local news media reported allegations that Mr. Laming had taken \\u201cupskirting\\u201d photos of a woman. It later emerged that the woman had been wearing shorts with her underwear visible, not a skirt, and the police concluded no crime had been committed, though he apologized for taking the photos without the woman\\u2019s consent.\", \"Nina Funnell, a journalist, said the government\\u2019s approach \\u201csets a very unhealthy tone for our democracy if people can\\u2019t criticize elected officials without risk of serious financial repercussions.\\u201d Ms. Funnell started a legal-defense fund for those who had received defamation notices, which has raised more than $200,000.\", \"She said the discrepancy in resources and power between the politicians and people they were suing amounted to \\u201casymmetric warfare.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"26ca64de4d1811ecb1429fac13be8edc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"26ca64de4d1811ecb1429fac13be8edc"}},
