The organized crime ring took advantage of the H-2A visa program that allows workers from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras to enter the U.S.\", \"Authorities said the defendants earned $200 million by bringing migrants into the U.S. to work as agricultural workers in horrendous conditions. The federal program requires they be paid fairly, often $10 to $12 an hour, but instead, were paid little to no money.\", \"According to prosecutors, the defendants kept the remaining cash and bought items such as a nightclub and dozens of vehicles. They also laundered millions of dollars through a casino, according to the indictment.\", \"According to federal authorities, migrants had their documents taken away leaving them unable to leave and get help.
