Steve Oroho.\", \"Last week, about a dozen Republican Assembly members arrived for the first voting session since the requirements were put in place. The group tried to enter without showing proof of vaccination or taking a COVID test and were stopped by state troopers, but after a few minutes of conversation, the group was allowed to enter.\", \"State police and Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy sidestepped questions about why the legislators were allowed to avoid the requirements, as Murphy called the move a display of \\\"idiocy\\\" by the group.\", \"During the ensuing session, Democratic Assembly Speaker Craig Coughlin said it represented a \\\"colossal failure of security,\\\" and said Republicans were avoiding measures similar to what everyday Americans are going through to work or do certain activities in public.\", \"\\\"Twenty-eight members of the minority caucus could not be bothered to exhibit common decency and humanity all because they would rather have a couple of minutes on TV news,\\\" Coughlin said.\", \"Appellate Division Judge Allison Accurso set a hearing date in April to hear arguments on the mandate, which has been more strictly enforced following the first incident with Republican lawmakers.\", \"The next test for how the mandate will be enforced are committee meetings that are scheduled to take place Monday.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949738/new-jersey-statehouse-vaccine-requirement-republicans.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Signs requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination are shown posted outside committee rooms at the statehouse, Dec. 3, 2021, in Trenton, N.J.

Republicans had hailed it as a victory at the time, though the new ruling amounts to a setback.\", \"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949740/new-jersey-statehouse-vaccine-requirement-republicans.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">New Jersey Gov.
