But some do not expect a  rebound until next year.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-23T09:11:17.000Z","content":"[\"It\\u2019s Tuesday. We\\u2019ll look at tourism in New York, an essential segment of the city\\u2019s economy that is picking up after a dispiriting year and a half. We\\u2019ll also look at a State Assembly report that reinforced findings that Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed several women.\", \"The advice was for New Yorkers. It was: \\u201cBe nice to tourists.\\u201d\", \"It came from Chris Heywood, a vice president of New York City\\u2019s tourism agency, NYC & Company. It was almost enough to make a New Yorker say, as politely as possible: Oh, please. And what\\u2019s next, etiquette tips?\", \"But Heywood was serious. Now that the United States is allowing vaccinated international travelers into the country, Heywood was explaining to my colleague Matt Stevens how important they are to arts institutions that had lost revenue and cut jobs during the pandemic. \\u201cIt\\u2019s crucial that we recover this segment,\\u201d Heywood said. \\u201cArts and culture are going to lead our recovery. That is the backbone.\\u201d\", \"International visitors typically make up about a fifth of the city\\u2019s visitors, but they tend to stay longer and spend more than domestic travelers. And three of my colleagues \\u2014 Nicole Hong, Patrick McGeehan and Chelsia Rose Marcius \\u2014 write that the early indications are that they are trickling back.\", \"The lines are longer at the Halal Guys food cart in Midtown Manhattan \\u2014 business was up about 20 percent during the first weekend under the new travel policy. The number of international visitors buying Statue of Liberty tickets has jumped more than 50 percent. The Metropolitan Museum of Art had 40,000 visitors from Nov. 12 to Nov. 14, the most in three days over a weekend since the pandemic began. And a few thousand more people are walking through Times Square.\", \"\\u201cIn the last week, it felt like I woke up from a coma and everything was just normal,\\u201d said Andrew Martinez, the owner of BO\\u2019s Bagels in Harlem, a popular stop for European visitors on tours that take in Harlem churches. He said a flood of visitors who did not speak English had come in, enough to make him feel he had hired two new employees just in time.\", \"Tourism had become increasingly important to the city\\u2019s economy in the years before the pandemic, and international visitors represent 20 percent of the city\\u2019s tourists but roughly half of the dollars from tourism. This year\\u2019s total is projected to be about $24 billion, roughly half the 2019 total.\", \"And they go to museums, Broadway shows and concerts. About 70 percent of the tickets at the TKTS booth in Times Square are bought by tourists, and roughly half of them are foreign travelers. The Metropolitan Opera says that international ticket sales accounted for about 20 percent of total box office revenue over the last five seasons.\", \"For the Metropolitan Museum, attracting foreign tourists is such a priority that the Met ran a full-page advertisement in newspapers in Hong Kong, London, Paris and Toronto. \\u201cWe reopened in August 2020, but have been missing one critical thing \\u2014 you, our international visitors,\\u201d the ad says. \\u201cThe Met is only The Met when it is being enjoyed daily by visitors around the world.\\u201d\", \"For their part, tour operators and ticket vendors overseas say they have started to see their New York business bounce back. And many New York businesses that depend on foreign travelers expect bigger numbers as the end-of-the-year holidays approach.\", \"Bookings at Q4 \\u2014 a hostel in a former bank building in Long Island City, Queens \\u2014 are nearly sold out this week and around the holidays next month, said Aaron Lajara, a manager. The rest of December is picking up, he said.\", \"It is a happy change for Lajara, who survived on unemployment benefits and federal stimulus checks during the 19 months when the hotel was closed.\", \"\\u201cFinancially, it was a struggle,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI was excited mentally to come back to work.\\u201d\", \"In a mostly sunny day in the low 40s, expect some wind gusts. The evening is clear, with temps in the 30s.\", \"In effect until Thursday (Thanksgiving Day).\", \"\\u201cWe conclude that there is overwhelming evidence that the former governor engaged in sexual harassment.\\u201d\", \"That sentence, in a 46-page report released on Monday, summarized one element of the New York State Assembly\\u2019s investigation of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo. It reinforced the findings of a separate investigation by the state attorney general that found that Cuomo had sexually harassed 11 women.\", \"My colleagues Grace Ashford and Luis Ferr\\u00e9-Sadurn\\u00ed write that the Assembly report went beyond the sexual harassment allegations, finding that Cuomo abused his power to produce a memoir for which he received a $5.1 million advance. Investigators hired by the Assembly Judiciary Committee said that Cuomo had \\u201cutilized the time of multiple state employees, as well as his own, to further his personal gain\\u201d with the book. The investigators said that \\u201ccertain senior state officials worked extensively on the book\\u201d and that one senior state official had explained that \\u201cthe work was not voluntary.\\u201d\", \"The Assembly report also faulted Cuomo as \\u201cnot fully transparent\\u201d about nursing home deaths during the pandemic. His administration was caught up in a controversy over its handling of data following reports that the state was undercounting coronavirus deaths in nursing homes.\", \"[Read the Assembly report on Cuomo.]\", \"The Assembly inquiry was commissioned to lay the foundation for potential impeachment proceedings against Cuomo, a possibility that he pre-empted when he resigned in August. He has repeatedly attacked the investigation that ultimately prompted his departure \\u2014 conducted by outside lawyers hired by the state attorney general, Letitia James \\u2014 as politically motivated. James, a Democrat, is now running for governor.\", \"Rita Glavin, Cuomo\\u2019s lawyer, said the Assembly report \\u201csimply parrots the attorney general\\u2019s flawed report.\\u201d Glavin also said the Assembly had \\u201crefused to provide the former governor with access to all the evidence, again denying the governor due process and a meaningful ability to respond.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis is disappointing,\\u201d she said, \\u201cbut hardly surprising.\\u201d\", \"You know the end of the year is approaching when lists of the best this or that appear. The editors of The New York Times Book Review published \\u201c100 Notable Books of 2021\\u201d on Monday. The New York Public Library\\u2019s best-books list is out today \\u2014 295 books in four categories (children, teens, adults and for children in Spanish). One book, \\u201cHow the Word Is Passed: A Reckoning with the History of Slavery Across America,\\u201d by Clint Smith, was one of the library\\u2019s top 10 books for adults and was among The Times\\u2019s 100 notable books. The Times called it \\u201ctimely and profound, an eloquent view of a history we have yet fully to confront.\\u201d\", \"The library\\u2019s list was chosen by committees of librarians who read voraciously \\u2014 the panel that chose the 100 titles on the \\u201cbest books for kids\\u201d list read 1,665 books in total. \\u201cThe committees are made up of librarians who deal with real readers every day,\\u201d said Lynn Lobash, the library\\u2019s associate director of reader services. \\u201cThey understand what readers really want. Not everyone wants to read literary fiction. Some people want to read paranormal romance. Other people want to read poetry. The list reflects that. There\\u2019s something for every reader there.\\u201d\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"I used to stop at the deli near my apartment almost daily to pick up a few things.\", \"One day, I was short a couple of dollars and asked the cashier if I could make up the difference the next time I was there. She said that was fine.\", \"I stopped in the next day.\", \"\\u201cI owe you some money,\\u201d I said.\", \"She checked a note taped to the register with four or five amounts, with handwritten Korean-language characters next to each.\", \"\\u201c$2.59,\\u201d she said.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s correct,\\u201d I said. \\u201cBut you don\\u2019t know my name.
