Fitzsimmons, dean of admissions and financial aid, in a statement. \", \"He added, \\\"Their applications will be considered on the basis of what  they have presented, and they are encouraged to send whatever materials  they believe would convey their accomplishments in secondary school and  their promise for the future.\\\"\", \"The move comes amid a debate about the fairness of the tests, given that Black and Latino students on average score lower than White students, an issue that experts say reflects generational gaps in education, income and other standards of well-being. But experts also note that SAT or ACT scores don't actually predict how a student will perform in college \\u2014 instead, grades are much more predictive of college success.\", \"At the same time, some students have struggled to take standardized tests during the pandemic, and Harvard cited the ongoing health crisis as one reason it is moving to a test-optional policy through 2026. Many colleges switched to a test-optional policy last year, when many SAT testing dates were canceled during the onset of the pandemic.\", \"Other colleges and universities are also moving to test-optional policies temporarily or permanently. Among them are fellow Ivy League institutions Columbia University and Cornell University, which have both gone test optional for applicants entering in the fall of 2024.\", \"Interestingly, the switch to a test-optional policy boosted the numbers of applications to many of the nation's most prestigious schools. Without feeling that they needed a top SAT or ACT score to apply, more students threw their applications into the pool \\u2014 and as a result of the surge in applications, Ivy League schools like Harvard had record-low acceptance rates last year.\\u00a0\", \"Last year, Harvard accepted\\u00a03.4% of applicants\\u00a0compared with 4.9% the previous year, while Columbia's rate\\u00a0dropped\\u00a0to 3.7%, from 6.1% \\u2014 a record low for both institutions. Other Ivies also reported reduced admission compared with a year ago, when COVID-19 first shuttered the U.S. economy.\", \"On Thursday, Harvard said that it accepted 740 students via early action out of a poll of 9,406 applicants, or an acceptance rate of 7.8%. Early action decisions typically have a higher acceptance rate than the regular admissions round.\", \"Harvard will send acceptances for its regular-decision applicants in late March.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"496630885f4a11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"496630885f4a11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
