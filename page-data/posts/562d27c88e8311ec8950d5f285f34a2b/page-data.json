For a couple of minutes, she put behind the controversy over her eligibility after judges ruled Monday that she could continue to compete in the Olympics. The skater tested positive for a banned heart medication, trimetazidine, in Russia in December, but her test result only came to light last week.\\u00a0\", \"The court said the investigation into the doping offense would take months to resolve and it gave a favorable decision for her in part because she was a minor or \\\"protected person,\\\" making her subject to different rules from an adult athlete. The decision drew condemnation from USOPC president Sarah Hirshland and accusations of racial bias from American sprinter Sha'Carri Richardson, who wasn't allowed to run in the Tokyo Olympics because she tested positive for THC \\u2013 an ingredient found in marijuana.\\u00a0\", \"An Olympic official shed more light on the ruling Tuesday, saying there was a mix-up with her grandfather's heart medication.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"She presented elements which brought some doubts about her guilt, and also she was in a very special situation that the Olympic Games take place only every four years and if she would miss the competition at this Games, the damage could not be repaired,\\\" said Denis Oswald, the permanent chair of the International Olympic Committee's disciplinary commission.\\u00a0\", \"A post shared by CBS News (@cbsnews)\", \"The issue made headlines after a medal ceremony delay in the women's team figure skating competition, where Russia\\u00a0finished in first \\u2013 in part because of Valieva's strong performance.
