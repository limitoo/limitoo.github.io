It's nothing to fear.\\\"\", \"Robertson, who was standing in for Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, told Morning Report he agreed that the nature of democracy has changed and said the country could be proud of how it had evolved.\", \"He said it had allowed the M\\u0101ori voice to be heard and their voices and aspirations can be taken into account.\", \"Regarding power-sharing for M\\u0101ori he used health as an example and said there had been decades of inequities and poor health outcomes within a system that had failed M\\u0101ori.\", \"\\\"There are issues in our society which we can resolve better if we adopt arrangements that are appropriate for that sector.
