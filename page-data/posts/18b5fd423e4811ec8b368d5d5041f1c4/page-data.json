But law enforcement officials in Plymouth, Minnesota had to deal with an altogether more unusual incident on Wednesday afternoon\\u2014two dueling bald eagles.\", \"Local residents spotted two eagles battling on the ground in the middle of an intersection in the city and called the police. One officer, Mitch Martinson, eventually responded to the scene to in an attempt to break them up as a small crowd gathered.\", \"The Plymouth Police Department said in a Facebook post: \\\"For Plymouth police officers, there's no telling what call could come in next. Yesterday, police responded to a report of two bald eagles stuck together on a Plymouth roadway.\\\"\", \"\\\"With a little assistance, the eagles were able to untangle themselves and flew away.\\\"\", \"Martinson was doing traffic enforcement outside a high school when he received the call about the birds.\", \"\\\"We do have de-escalation tactics, but I've never applied them to eagles or other animals,\\\" the officer told local CBS-affiliate WCCO.\", \"When Martinson arrived at the scene, he was unsure about how to tackle the situation but managed to capture body cam footage of the birds.\", \"\\\"I was trying to go through my head what to do next. And who to call,\\\" Martinson said.\", \"In the end, he decided to contact the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and the Raptor Center at the University of Minnesota, who said the birds were likely fighting over territory.\", \"\\\"I've never been up that close to eagles and their talons are much bigger than I thought. So they could injure someone pretty severely if you get too close,\\\" Martinson told CCX Media.\", \"\\\"It's definitely a call that I've never had before. We don't train on it. So yeah, I was definitely thinking outside of the box. I first wanted to make sure there weren't any injuries with their wings or beaks.\\\"\", \"The officer said he had seen on an Animal Planet program that if you cover a bird's eyes it can help to calm them down. He attempted to try this tactic with the help of a local resident but the birds eventually flew away.\", \"The officer said one of the perks of his job was that he had the chance to respond to different incidents every day.\", \"\\\"It's definitely one of the most memorable calls I've been on, and probably once in a career, once in a lifetime incident to be on scene for and see firsthand,\\\" Martinson told CCX.\", \"In this case, the bald eagles did not appear to be injured when they flew away. But according to the Raptor Center, these fights can result in serious injuries and even death.\", \"One local resident who saw the incident, Todd Burroughs, told WCCO: \\\"It's just crazy. It's hard to believe it happened right here in the street.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927004/two-fighting-bald-eagles.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The two bald eagles that were found battling in Plymouth, Minnesota, on Wednesday.</div>\"]","href_hash":"18b5fd423e4811ec8b368d5d5041f1c4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"18b5fd423e4811ec8b368d5d5041f1c4"}},
