There is a mountain of evidence supporting this.\", \"Pediatric hospitals are overrun with mental health cases. There is a lot of hand-wringing but little more. A thorough analysis of our cultural flaws is seriously lacking.\", \"These children and adolescents are bombarded with a toxic mix of vicious social media and harmful violent video games, television shows and films. In addition, this is the only advanced nation in the world where going to school has turned into a form of Russian roulette.\", \"The discordant state of politics guarantees that nothing will change for these unfortunate youth. Our culture, which emphasizes winning at sports, egotism and accumulation of wealth, creates a weakened society unable to comprehend and deal with its most serious problems. The Covid pandemic is exhibit A.\", \"The mental health crisis of American youth is a function of a culture that promotes ignorance, self-indulgence and self-aggrandizement with little sense of decency, mutual respect or self-reflection. How do you repair a defective culture? I am not sure, but it needs to start with a serious examination of its substantial flaws.\", \"Arnold R.

The lack of a significant national response is stunning.\", \"Not only do we need to shift our collective focus, but we also need to shift the culture of our schools if we are to meaningfully address this mental health crisis that is exhausting and overstretching entire school communities.\", \"That means putting an end to toxic school stressors that have long caused anxiety and depression in young people, and starting to create environments that are humane for students, teachers and families. Instead of being driven by a narrow vision of achievement and success, our schools must prioritize the experiences that support health \\u2014 like connection, agency and meaningful learning.\", \"If we finally bring humanity to our schools, maybe then not only will our kids be healthier, but also we as a society can start to heal together.\", \"Vicki AbelesLafayette, Calif.The writer is the author of \\u201cBeyond Measure: Rescuing an Overscheduled, Overtested, Underestimated Generation,\\u201d and director of the documentaries \\u201cRace to Nowhere\\u201d and \\u201cBeyond Measure.\\u201d\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cDemocrats\\u2019 Dangerous Appetite for Eating Their Own,\\u201d by Frank Bruni (newsletter, nytimes.com, Dec. 9):\", \"I have an Emergency Alert for Democrats. Our nation\\u2019s democratic form of government is in the cross hairs. The political moment is grave. It is not clear if our remarkable democracy will survive the vicious and organized assault from the right, nor is it clear if the Dems have the clarity and stamina to save it.\", \"Remember that you are politicians, elected to meet the political moment, equipped and focused on what is now the greatest threat to our country since the Civil War.
