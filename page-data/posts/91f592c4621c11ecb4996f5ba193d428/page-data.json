In many cases we're actually having to rebuild the entire fish stocks,\\\" McLeod said.\", \"\\\"There are parts of the system that are under significant pressure and are in a pretty sorry state.\\\"\", \"The advice was delivered by the group to Minister for Oceans and Fisheries David Parker last month, and the guardians said he was receptive to their recommendations.\", \"McLeod said scallops were a good example of the issue at hand.\", \"Once plentiful in and around Fiordland anchorages, reports were now coming back that it was hard to find a single one, she said.\", \"\\\"It's made us realise that if we just keep trying to do the same thing to fix this problem, we're not going to manage to fix it.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/136068/eight_col_Fiordland-Marine-Guardians-at-Beehive.jpeg?1640058232\\\" alt=\\\"The guardians made their submission to government last month at the Beehive.
