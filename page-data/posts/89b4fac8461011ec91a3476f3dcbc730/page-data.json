They often involved cash payments or lotteries, sometimes to win items like customized pickup trucks or rifles, and free tickets to baseball games, drinks and even joints.\", \"The rewards announced for children so far are mostly cash and scholarships, but in some areas, local attractions are also being dangled.\", \"Visa gift cards worth $100 are available to children in Louisiana and Chicago. In New York City, $100 prepaid debit cards are also available, as are tickets to the Statue of Liberty and Brooklyn Cyclones baseball games.\", \"In San Antonio, parents who have their children vaccinated at city clinics are eligible for a $100 gift card to H-E-B, the grocery store chain that is an institution in Texas.

Jim Justice and Babydog, his English bulldog. One hundred lifetime hunting and fishing licenses are also up for grabs.\", \"In a similar vein, children aged 5 to 17 in Maine are being asked to be creative to encourage their peers to get vaccinated. The state is soliciting 30-second videos from them on the benefits of getting a Covid shot, with an emphasis on \\u201coriginal music or humor,\\u201d information on the vaccines\\u2019 safety and efficacy, and the dangers of being unvaccinated. The prizes, which will be donated to the filmmakers\\u2019 schools, are $50,000 for first place, $25,000 for second place and $10,000 for third place.\"]","href_hash":"89b4fac8461011ec91a3476f3dcbc730"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"89b4fac8461011ec91a3476f3dcbc730"}},
