One TikToker has taken that sentiment above and beyond with their flashy display that viewers can't seem to get enough of.\", \"TikToker @htown_frankie has been sharing magical light displays on TikTok that have given him quite the following since he started posting the videos last year. With lights paired to music\\u2014from dance music to hip hop, some of the videos even feature people dancing along in the driveway to the music.\", \"But if you don't know how to have Christmas lights like these installed, get ready to pay a pretty penny. Just to have regular Christmas lights installed can set you back. According to Home Advisor, the average cost is $421 for installation from a professional. However, the range can vary from $218 to $662. Plus, add in the cost of the light strands themselves, and you could pay $300 or even more depending on your setup. But something like what this TikToker has set up goes far beyond that by the looks of it.\", \"The lights outline the house, which also has a Christmas tree light display in the front yard accompanied by lit candy canes and trees in the yard.
