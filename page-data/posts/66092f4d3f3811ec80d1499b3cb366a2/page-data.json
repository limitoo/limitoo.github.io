dispute.\", \"But what has really transfixed most of them are the choices made by the two principals dealing with its radioactive fallout, and the way those choices are re-shaping the relationship between their two countries.\", \"Some of these choices were made in the moment.\", \"When Mr Macron was asked by reporters at the G20 in Rome if he thought Mr Morrison had lied to him over the submarine deal, he paused for just a second before quite deliberately uttering five words which set off a fresh media storm in Australia and infuriated the federal government.\", \"It's impossible to know exactly what sort of calculus flashed through the President's mind in that moment, but it set off yet another round of diplomatic recriminations in both capitals.\", \"There was also, presumably, a moment when Mr Morrison and his lieutenants, after weighing up how he should respond, decided they should also go nuclear.\", \"Within hours they took the extraordinary step of breaking an ironclad diplomatic convention and leaking to Australian media outlets private messages from Mr Macron, which they believed would fatally undermine his accusation that Mr Morrison lied.\", \"The newspapers

approaching presidential election in April next year.\", \"Mr Thebault spent much of the address trying to make the case that Paris was deadly serious\\u00a0and utterly sincere.\", \"The cancelled submarine deal was not just a commercial contract, he said.\", \"\\\"As an unprecedented act of trust, it was bringing our relationship with Australia to a level never reached before, politically and technologically.\\\"\", \"There are good reasons why the speech was closely watched by so many in Canberra.\", \"France \\u2014 with its sprawling territories and substantial military presence in the Pacific \\u2014\\u00a0is an Indo-Pacific power, and the bitter dispute between Australia and France will feed into some key regional dynamics.\", \"Some European countries also sympathise deeply with
