Her final moments in \\u2018She Used to Be Mine\\u2019 are some of my favorite of all time. She digs down deep and does not come up for air, connecting the musical phrases as her character finds her strength.\\u201d\", \"Seeing Nettles thrive on Broadway may surprise those who only know the singer-songwriter from Sugarland or her thriving solo career. But \\u201cWaitress\\u201d wasn\\u2019t Nettles\\u2019s first show-tune rodeo. She played Roxie Hart in \\u201cChicago\\u201d in 2015 and Donna Sheridan in \\u201cMamma Mia!\\u201d at the Hollywood Bowl two years later. In June she released a collection of musical-theater numbers titled \\u201cAlways Like New.\\u201d\", \"She also has a burgeoning screen career with roles in the movie \\u201cHarriet\\u201d and as the matriarch of a televangelist family in the HBO comedy \\u201cThe Righteous Gemstones.\\u201d\", \"The effervescent Nettles spoke about becoming a mom, sensible shoes and, er, poison from her dressing room at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, shortly before one of her last performances in \\u201cWaitress.\\u201d These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"You\\u2019ve loved musicals since you were a kid. Why did you end up choosing country music?\", \"All the way through high school and college I was able to do both because there were programs and community theater. I started having traction in music in college and had that fork-in-the-road moment, and I thought, \\u201cMusic has some momentum, I\\u2019m going to go over here.\\u201d But I always longed to be able to do both, and I was just one person [laughs].\", \"When did you start planting the seeds for a turn to musical theater?\", \"Around 12 years ago, I was going to do Elphaba in \\u201cWicked\\u201d on tour and then make my way to Broadway. But I was dealing with a ton of acid reflux at the time, before we really knew that was such a thing for singers. I was really, really stressed and I pulled out because I didn\\u2019t know what was going on with my instrument. The right thing always happens at the right time, you know, and in 2015 I was able to enjoy going right to the Broadway stage in \\u201cChicago.\\u201d\", \"Between the new album and Broadway reopening, did it feel like musical-theater serendipity for you?\", \"I had been recording \\u201cAlways Like New\\u201d over the course of 2019 and we recorded the last note of the last song on March 12, 2020. I walked out of the vocal booth and our phones started lighting up, saying Broadway was closing. I put the record out in June and that felt sort of like waving this flag of, \\u201cOK, we\\u2019re coming back,\\u201d because we knew of the plans of hopeful September reopening. So to move from an album I\\u2019ve always wanted to make to stepping on to the very stages that inspired it \\u2014 artistically that felt like this is how it\\u2019s supposed to be.\", \"What\\u2019s your take on Jenna?\", \"The journey of motherhood, for me as it is for some women, was such a confluence \\u2014 I have jokingly called it a bludgeoning of identity. I was never one of those women who thought she always wanted to have kids. I was open to it and I love children, but I already had another purpose. The loss that happens to everybody but specifically to mothers who have a pre-existing job purpose outside of family \\u2014 the loss was extreme. The gains were beautiful, too, don\\u2019t get me wrong, but both of your hands are full in motherhood: There is sacrifice and loss and death, and there is birth and beauty and fullness. I relate to Jenna as a woman, as being Southern, but that transformation where she\\u2019s just like, \\u201cWow, what is happening to my life? Who am I? What do I want?\\u201d is so accessible to me.\", \"You have done Jenna\\u2019s showstopper, \\u201cShe Used to Be Mine,\\u201d in concert. What was it like singing it in the show?\", \"It\\u2019s so different. In concert you\\u2019re just doing it as a piece of music. To do it within the character and within the arc, and that being her 11 o\\u2019clock moment. Performing while crying is its own animal.\", \"Did you look forward to the number or did you dread it?\", \"Once I figured out how to sing it and act it and cry it and scream it all at the same time, I actually did look forward to it. So much tension has been building for her this whole time that to allow for that release is very cathartic every time I do it.\", \"At least you got to do it in sensible shoes.\", \"Thank you, Lord! I\\u2019m glad she is a waitress and able to wear those shoes, that\\u2019s for sure.\", \"What\\u2019s going through your mind as you are wrapping up with the show?\", \"I wish it could have been longer but in some ways it\\u2019s just the right-size bite, you know? I would rather leave still a little bit hungry than over-full and like, \\u201cGet me out of here!\\u201d\", \"You\\u2019re writing the score for a new musical inspired by Giulia Tofana. What can you tell us about her?\", \"She was a slow poisoner in the 17th century. She\\u2019s attributed with what they call the first Italian divorce, where she helped women get out of their marriages by killing their husbands [laughs]. Which just makes it fun.\", \"It\\u2019s definitely a different career path from pie or country music.\", \"And to be able to tell a story of a woman who isn\\u2019t this 20-year-old ing\\u00e9nue! I have gone into way darker transformative caves as a woman in my 40s than I ever did in my 20s. The stakes are higher. This isn\\u2019t some budding hero\\u2019s journey \\u2014 this is a blossoming warrior\\u2019s journey. Very different. It is also a warning that we still have very far to go where women are concerned. Sexism has been so delicately woven in that, oftentimes, we don\\u2019t see it and we think, like, \\u201cOh, we\\u2019ve come so far.\\u201d Have we? So I am excited to tell this story \\u2014 to celebrate her, to offer conversation, provocation.\"]","href_hash":"af6655aa508311ec9e3ba3947a67e2f7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"af6655aa508311ec9e3ba3947a67e2f7"}},
