Pandemic lockdowns kept uncountable millions of people working from home over the past two years, but Portugal is the rare country to enact laws seeking to formally protect workers\\u2019 off-clock hours and contain their work-related costs.\", \"The legislation was presented by Portugal\\u2019s labor minister, Ana Mendes Godinho, as a way not only to protect domestic workers but to encourage more foreigners to select Portugal as a location for working remotely. Portugal has become a major destination for so-called digital nomads, in part because it is offering them special temporary resident visas to work from Portugal.\", \"\\u201cWe consider Portugal one of the best places in the world for these digital nomads and remote workers to choose to live in, we want to attract them to Portugal,\\u201d Ms. Godinho said at a conference in Lisbon this month.\", \"Under the new law, employers can be fined for contacting staff outside regular hours except in an emergency situation. The law also requires companies to ensure that people who work remotely go to their workplace at least once every two months, to meet with their supervisors and fellow employees, in an effort to avert excessive isolation.\", \" It also gives young parents the right to work from home without preliminary approval from their bosses, as long as their child is less than 8 years old.\"]","href_hash":"de22ce24449811ec941693bf5fa47ff2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"de22ce24449811ec941693bf5fa47ff2"}},
