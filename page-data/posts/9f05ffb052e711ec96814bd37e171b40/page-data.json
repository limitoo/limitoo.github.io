According to a 2019 report from Bankrate, the average divorce in America costs around $15,000. Typically, these expenses include everything from court filing costs to litigation or mediation. However, if the divorce process is prolonged, or if custody is involved, costs can increase significantly.\", \"The average cost of a divorce is a small price to pay compared to the fees accumulated by TikToker Brittany Jade and her husband amid their divorce proceedings. The thing is\\u2014they never actually got divorced.\", \"In her video, Jade stands beside her husband, facing the camera.
