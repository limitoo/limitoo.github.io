In the report, Bickeboeller alleges that over three years after two MAX model 737 planes crashed, the company still will not admit to lapses in compliance with federal safety standards, according to The Seattle Times.\", \"Bickeboeller reached out to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) with his complaints in October. He alleged that Boeing's unwillingness to admit mistakes has resulted in \\\"a dangerous culture not conducive to the proper safety of aerospace products.\\\"\", \"Bickeboeller noted that the way Boeing oversees manufacturing at its various suppliers is still inadequate in the years since the MAX crafts were first grounded. He has reportedly flagged this issue to the company multiple times, as well as in a previous complaint submitted to the FAA.\", \"Jessica Kowal, a spokesperson for Boeing, told The Seattle Times that the company took the issues raised by Bickeboeller into consideration but ultimately disagreed with his assessments. She also added that Boeing takes such matters flagged by employees \\\"very seriously.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950837/boeing-max-whistleblower.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A U.S. Senate report released on Sunday features allegations against Boeing by a named whistleblower over its unwillingness to admit to safety oversights.

Flights resumed with MAX crafts in the U.S. in December of 2020, and the model was recertified in Canada and Europe the following month.\", \"Alongside Bickeboeller, the Senate's report also cited interviews with another engineer and a production manager from Boeing, three FAA safety engineers and an engineer at General Electric.
