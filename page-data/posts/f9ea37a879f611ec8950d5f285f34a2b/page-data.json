After waving to the jubilant crowds, she embraced her parents and draped herself both in the Union Jack and Belgian tricolor flag.\", \"\\\"Winter in Europe poses a lot of challenges,\\\" she said as she was held back for days on the last few legs of the trip. Then again, she had had to deal with -31 degrees Fahrenheit in Siberia and 90 degrees Fahrenheit in Indonesia. Fog, smoke from wildfires and even typhoons also held her back.\", \"In her trek of more than 28,000 nautical miles, she stopped over in five continents and visited 41 nations. \", \" \\\"The people were incredible, everywhere,\\\" she said. \", \" Rutherford's flight saw her steer clear of wildfires in California, deal with biting cold over Russia and narrowly avoid North Korean airspace. She flew by Visual Flight Rules, basically going on sight only, often slowing down progress when more sophisticated systems could have led her through clouds and fog.\", \"Sometimes she feared for her life, and at other times she simply yearned for the simple comforts of home. Flying runs in her blood, since both her parents are pilots and she has been traveling in small planes since she was 6. At 14, she started flying herself. \", \" With the final touchdown, the teenager wants to infuse young women and girls worldwide with the spirit of aviation - and an enthusiasm for studies in the exact sciences, mathematics, engineering and technology.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"f9ea37a879f611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f9ea37a879f611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
