And she is somebody who has taken on incredibly important assignments, whether it is addressing the root causes of migration at the Northern Triangle or taking on a core cause of democracy in voting rights,\\\" Psaki said.\", \"Those difficult assignments, in particular migration relating to the southern border, have made Harris the subject of strong criticism. Her dismissive answer to a question in June about why she hadn't yet visited the border became a particular focus of her messaging missteps.\", \"She also angered Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) - a key Democratic vote in the Senate - with a TV appearance in West Virginia in January to promote the American Rescue Plan, while Harris' office was reportedly left frustrated with ABC's The View after two hosts tested positive for COVID just before she was due to appear on the show.\", \"Harris' office hired two experienced communications aides in September - former Hillary Clinton and Al Gore strategist Lorraine Voles and former Barack Obama speechwriter Adam Frankel.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943813/kamala-harris-delivers-remarks.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Vice President Kamala Harris delivers remarks to the National Congress of American Indians 78th Annual Convention, in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building on October 12, 2021 in Washington, DC.
