Her testimony capped off the second week of the trial. The 59-year-old Maxwell is charged with grooming and trafficking underage girls to have sex with Epstein.\", \"Farmer told the court she met Epstein on a 1996 trip to New York City to visit her sister, who was working for the billionaire. After meeting him, the two went to a movie together, where she recounted feeling sick to her stomach as he caressed her leg and held her hand.\", \"Later that year, Farmer accepted a plane ticket from Epstein to travel to his New Mexico ranch, being under the impression that he and Maxwell were going to help her with her academic goals.\", \"Farmer didn't want to be alone with Epstein after the movie theater incident. She said she felt more comfortable having Maxwell there until Maxwell insisted on giving her a \\\"massage,\\\" which, she said, ended up being an excuse to fondle her breasts.\", \"\\\"It didn't make sense to me that would happen,\\\" Farmer said. \\\"I so badly wanted to get off the table and have the massage be done.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949500/ghislaine-maxwell-trial-sketch.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Annie Farmer testified Friday that Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein inappropriately touched her when she was 16.

Two said they were just 14 when the abuse started and that Maxwell sometimes participated in the encounters.\", \"Maxwell has denied charges she groomed underage girls for Epstein, who killed himself in jail in 2019. Her lawyers say the government is making her a scapegoat for alleged sex crimes committed by her onetime boyfriend.\", \"Farmer said after she arrived at the ranch, Maxwell and Epstein took her to the movies, and Epstein \\\"right away began to hold my hand\\\" and rub her foot and arm throughout the film.\", \"Once home, Maxwell insisted on giving Farmer a massage and told her to take off her clothes, Farmer testified. Maxwell \\\"pulled down the sheet and exposed my breasts and starting rubbing on my breasts,\\\" Farmer said.\", \"The next morning, she said, Epstein came into her bedroom and told her he wanted to cuddle. After he climbed into bed, she froze, thinking: I just have to get through this.\", \"He pressed his body against her, she said.\", \"She finally made up an excuse to go to the bathroom: \\\"I wanted to be in there long enough that this situation would be over,\\\" she said.\", \"The Associated Press does not identify people who say they were victims of sexual abuse unless they come forward publicly. Although Farmer was not identified by name in court documents, she has been outspoken in describing her experiences in interviews with ABC and The New York Times. When Maxwell sought bail, Farmer asked the judge to deny it, calling her a \\\"psychopath.\\\"\", \"Maxwell has been jailed since she was arrested in New Hampshire in July of the following year.\", \"Farmer's testimony caps the trial's second week. It's unclear whether the government will finish presenting its case Friday, as expected.\", \"The judge has suggested that closing arguments\\u2014originally thought to span six weeks\\u2014might occur as soon as December 20 if the defense presentation next week only lasts a day or two.\", \"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949502/ghislaine-maxwell-jury-sketch.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Annie Farmer, one of the four key accusers at Ghislaine Maxwell's sex abuse trial, capped off the second week of the trial with her testimony.
