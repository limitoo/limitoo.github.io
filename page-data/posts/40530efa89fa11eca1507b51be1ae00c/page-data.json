But the company\\u2019s latest deployment of 49 new satellites after a Feb. 3 launch did not go as planned.\", \"As a consequence of a geomagnetic storm triggered by a recent outburst of the sun, up to 40 of 49 newly launched Starlink satellites have been knocked out of commission. They are in the process of re-entering Earth\\u2019s atmosphere, where they will be incinerated.\", \"The incident highlights the hazards faced by numerous companies planning to put tens of thousands of small satellites in orbit to provide internet service from space. And it\\u2019s possible that more solar outbursts will knock some of these newly deployed orbital transmitters out of the sky. The sun has an 11-year-long cycle in which it oscillates between hyperactive and quiescent states. Presently, it is ramping up to its peak, which has been forecast to arrive around 2025.\", \"This recent solar paroxysm was relatively moderate by the sun\\u2019s standards. \\u201cI have every confidence that we\\u2019re going to see an extreme event in the next cycle, because that typically is what happens during a solar maximum,\\u201d said Hugh Lewis, a space debris expert at the University of Southampton in England. If a milquetoast outburst can knock out 40 Starlink satellites hanging out at low orbital altitudes, a more potent solar scream has the potential to inflict greater harm on the mega-constellations of SpaceX and other companies.\", \"SpaceX announced the looming destruction of as many as 40 of its satellites in a company blog post on Tuesday night. The company said that after the launch, the satellites were released to their intended orbit, about 130 miles above Earth.\", \"This altitude was chosen partly to prevent potential collisions in the future with other satellites. If the satellites malfunction after being deployed at that altitude, and are unable to raise their orbits to more secure heights, \\u201cthe atmosphere kind of reclaims the failed technology very rapidly,\\u201d Dr. Lewis said. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s a very good safety measure.\\u201d\", \"But on Jan. 29, before these satellites launched a violent eruption from the sun of highly energetic particles and magnetism known as a coronal mass ejection was detected. That ejection arrived at Earth sometime around Feb. 2, creating a geomagnetic storm in Earth\\u2019s magnetic bubble.\", \"The powerful storm added kinetic energy to particles in Earth\\u2019s atmosphere. \\u201cThe atmosphere kind of puffs up, expands, as a result,\\u201d Dr. Lewis said. That expansion causes an increase in the atmosphere\\u2019s density, which in turn increases the drag experienced by objects moving through it, including satellites. This drag shrinks the size of their orbits, which draws them closer to the thick, lower atmosphere in which they burn up.\", \"According to SpaceX, during the recent Starlink deployment, \\u201cthe escalation speed and severity of the storm caused atmospheric drag to increase up to 50 percent higher than during previous launches.\\u201d This ensured that as many as 40 of the 49 satellites would eventually succumb to the forces of gravity and perish.\", \"There are currently a total of 1,915 Starlink satellites in orbit, so for SpaceX, a loss of up to 40 \\u201cis not a big deal from their point of view,\\u201d said Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Harvard and Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. who also catalogs and tracks artificial space objects.\", \"But Dr. Lewis said \\u201cthat probably accounts for potentially up to $100 million of hardware, if you include the cost of the launch.\\u201d\", \"The dangers that solar outbursts and geomagnetic storms pose to objects in low-Earth orbit, from electrical damage to communications disruptions, are well known. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ranks geomagnetic storms on a scale from minor to extreme. The latest, a \\u201cmoderate\\u201d storm, is noted by the agency as possibly causing changes in atmospheric drag that can alter orbits.\", \"With these risks being known, did SpaceX take this hazard into account during this Starlink deployment?\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m just kind of dumbfounded. said Samantha Lawler, an astronomer at the University of Regina in Canada. \\u201cReally? They did not think of this?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a bit of a surprise,\\u201d said Dr. McDowell. \\u201cThey should have been ready for this, one would have thought.\\u201d\", \"When contacted by email, a SpaceX media representative said that no one was available to answer questions, noting that \\u201cit\\u2019s an incredibly demanding time for the team.\\u201d\", \"That these satellites seem to be quickly entering the atmosphere, rather than lingering in low-Earth orbit, is a good thing. They also pose no threat to anyone on the ground. \\u201cFrom a safety perspective, the system functioned exactly as it should have,\\u201d Dr. Lewis said. \\u201cThe satellites de-orbited, and nothing else was put at risk.\\u201d\", \"Most satellites orbit at higher altitudes and can avoid the hazards posed by atmospheric expansion. But the threat to satellites orbiting at lower altitudes is far from over, and it leads to the question of whether SpaceX can continue deploying spacecraft at this low altitude.\", \"\\u201cAs the sun gets more active, it releases an increasing amount of extreme ultraviolet, which gets absorbed into our atmosphere,\\u201d Dr. Lewis said. That atmosphere will expand significantly, and \\u201cthe expectation is that the atmospheric density is going to increase by one or two orders of magnitude. That\\u2019s a way bigger change compared to what we\\u2019ve just seen with this particular event.\\u201d\", \"Many astronomers have been critical of Starlink and other satellite constellations, which reflect sunlight and will potentially interfere with telescope research on Earth. And some see this incident as emblematic of SpaceX\\u2019s attitude toward problems occurring in low-Earth orbit.\", \"\\u201cIf things fail, they fix them and do things better next time,\\u201d Dr. Lewis said. \\u201cThis is another example of that\\u201d \\u2014 a policy of adherence to hindsight, not foresight.\", \"The death of these satellites is \\u201ca harsh lesson for SpaceX,\\u201d Dr. Lewis said. What happens next is up to them.\", \"Dr. Lawler added, \\u201cI hope this will knock a little bit of sense into them.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"40530efa89fa11eca1507b51be1ae00c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"40530efa89fa11eca1507b51be1ae00c"}},
