Trump about the aftermath of the 2020 election and new disclosures about his actions in trying to forestall its result \\u2014 including discussing the use of the national security apparatus to seize voting machines \\u2014 have stripped away any pretense that the events of Jan. 6, 2021, were anything but the culmination of the former president\\u2019s single-minded pursuit of retaining power.\", \"Mr. Trump said on Sunday that Mike Pence \\u201ccould have overturned the election,\\u201d acknowledging for the first time that the aim of the pressure campaign he focused on his vice president had simply been to change the election\\u2019s result, not just to buy time to root out supposed fraud, as he had long insisted. Those efforts ended at the Capitol with a violent riot of Trump supporters demanding that Mr. Pence block the Electoral College vote.\", \"Over the weekend, Mr. Trump also dangled, for the first time, that he could issue pardons to anyone facing charges for participating in the Jan. 6 attack if he is elected president again \\u2014 the latest example of a yearslong flirtation with political violence.\", \"And, ignoring what happened the last time he encouraged a mass demonstration, Mr. Trump urged his supporters to gather \\u201cin the biggest protests we have ever had\\u201d if prosecutors in New York and Atlanta moved further against him. The prosecutor examining Mr. Trump\\u2019s efforts to overturn the election in Georgia immediately asked the F.B.I. to conduct a \\u201crisk assessment\\u201d of her building\\u2019s security.\", \"The events of Jan. 6 played out so publicly and so brutally \\u2014 the instigating speech by Mr. Trump, the flag-waving march to the Capitol, the violent clashes with the police, the defiling of the seat of democracy \\u2014 and have since been so extensively re-examined that at times it can seem as if there were little more to be discovered about what led up to that day.\", \"Then, The New York Times reported this week that Mr. Trump himself had directed his lawyer, Rudolph W. Giuliani, to ask the Department of Homeland Security whether it could legally seize voting machines in three key swing states. Mr. Trump also raised, in an Oval Office meeting with Attorney General William P. Barr, the possibility of the Justice Department\\u2019s seizing the machines.\", \"Both ideas quickly fizzled.\", \"But historians say the episodes and Mr. Trump\\u2019s new comments acknowledging his determination to stay in power \\u2014 and his effective embrace of the rioters who stormed the Capitol, whom he said must be treated \\u201cfairly\\u201d \\u2014 have newly underscored the fragility of the nation\\u2019s democratic systems.\", \"Jeffrey Engel, director of the Center for Presidential History at Southern Methodist University, said voters were understandably desensitized, if not numb, after a year in which Mr. Trump methodically sought to undermine faith in the electoral process.\", \"\\u201cI actually think the American public is dramatically underplaying how significant and dangerous this is,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbecause we cannot process the basic truth of what we are learning about President Trump\\u2019s efforts \\u2014 which is we\\u2019ve never had a president before who fundamentally placed his own personal interests above the nation\\u2019s.\\u201d\", \"Already, Mr. Trump is gearing up for a potential third run for the White House, announcing on Monday that his political accounts had banked $122 million \\u2014 a show of financial force as some polls show his support softening among Republicans.\", \"In the year since he left office, he has systematically tried to remove those who were obstacles to him in 2020 and its aftermath: seeking to drive out of office the Republicans who voted to impeach him on charges of inciting the riot, recruiting challengers to Republican officials who certified the 2020 vote, and backing new candidates to serve as election administrators and legislators in key states.\", \"Mr. Trump has made clear he is not necessarily seeking more Republican officials. He wants more election-denying Republican officials.\", \"On Tuesday, Mr. Trump appeared in a new television ad attacking Gov. Brian Kemp, Republican of Georgia, with whom he has feuded for refusing to overturn the result there. He also hosted a fund-raiser at Mar-a-Lago for Joe Kent, a Republican in Washington who is challenging one of the House Republicans who voted to impeach him.\", \"And on Wednesday, Tudor Dixon, a Republican candidate for governor of Michigan, where Mr. Trump lost and sought to undermine the results, is holding a Mar-a-Lago fund-raiser of her own.\", \"Meanwhile, congressional investigators with the Democratic-led Jan. 6 commission are busily examining what took place inside the White House in the weeks and months leading up to that day, interviewing senior administration officials and issuing subpoenas. A central focus of their inquiry is the attempt by Mr. Trump\\u2019s legal team and advisers to persuade him to use his presidential powers to deploy national security agencies to seize voting machines.\", \"It has been known for months that some advisers, including the lawyer Sidney Powell and Mr. Trump\\u2019s former national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, pitched Mr. Trump in December 2020 on using the military to seize the machines in order to check the validity of their tallies. But new accounts suggest that Mr. Trump was more receptive to this \\u2014 even taking steps to act on some ideas \\u2014 than previously understood.\", \"\\u201cDonald Trump\\u2019s a constitutional wrecking ball,\\u201d said Representative Jake Auchincloss, a freshman Democrat from Massachusetts, who saw the mob overrun his workplace in his first days on Capitol Hill. \\u201cTo borrow a term from the financial markets, that\\u2019s priced in. So his revelations and his rhetoric are important. They are a clear and present threat to our democracy. But they\\u2019re also priced in.\\u201d\", \"The real question is for congressional Republicans, Mr. Auchincloss said: \\u201cThey know as well as we do what threat he poses to our constitutional order. Are they going to stand up to him?\\u201d\", \"Mr. Trump\\u2019s discussion of pardons and of Mr. Pence\\u2019s potential to overturn the election, as well as his encouragement of another mass rally \\u2014 against law-enforcement officials \\u2014 were met mostly with a shrug among Capitol Hill Republicans.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m just glad that there were people in the right places and that the system worked \\u2014 I mean, obviously, people who had positions of responsibility held their ground even when being asked to do things that they knew they shouldn\\u2019t do,\\u201d said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the No. 2 Republican, who has occasionally clashed with Mr. Trump. \\u201cThings may have been bent a little bit, but they didn\\u2019t break.\\u201d\", \"Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, said that \\u201cat the end of the day, as contentious as Jan. 6 was, as confrontational as that whole process was, the process worked.\\u201d\", \"A rare voice of dissent was Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of the few outspoken Republican critics of Mr. Trump and the top Republican on the Jan. 6 committee.\", \"\\u201cHe has acknowledged he was trying to overturn the election,\\u201d Ms. Cheney wrote on Twitter on Tuesday. \\u201cHe is making clear he would do this all again if given the chance.\\u201d\", \"Long before the Capitol riot, Mr. Trump spoke approvingly of political violence among his supporters.\", \"In 2015, he said of a protester at one of his rallies, \\u201cMaybe he should have been roughed up.\\u201d In 2016, he floated the idea of paying the legal fees of supporters who turned violent.\", \"While president, he said on Twitter, \\u201cWhen the looting starts, the shooting starts,\\u201d in a warning to demonstrators after the police killing of George Floyd. And in the first 2020 presidential debate, Mr. Trump famously declined to condemn white supremacist groups like the Proud Boys for their role in creating violence.\", \"\\u201cStand back and stand by,\\u201d Mr. Trump urged the Proud Boys. Members of the far-fight group cheered for what they took as encouragement from the commander in chief.\", \"\\u201cHe is using his supporters as his own kind of militia,\\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, a professor of history at Rice University. Mr. Trump, he said, was essentially telling his followers to \\u201cbe ready because this could end up being the new civil war.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe is just wanting to have people angry and ready to take up arms if need be,\\u201d Mr. Brinkley added. \\u201cAnd that feeds into the fantasy-scape of every militia group in the country.\\u201d\", \"The district attorney in Fulton County, Ga., Fani T. Willis, took Mr. Trump\\u2019s rally comments seriously, she wrote to the F.B.I., because \\u201chis statements were undoubtedly watched by millions.\\u201d She added that she had already taken extra security precautions because of people \\u201cunhappy with our commitment to fulfill our duties.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Willis vowed to press ahead: \\u201cMy staff and I will not be influenced or intimidated by anyone.\\u201d\", \"Oren Segal, vice president of the Anti-Defamation League\\u2019s Center on Extremism, said that far-right groups had reacted eagerly \\u2014 and sometimes threateningly \\u2014 to similar calls by Mr. Trump in the past.\", \"In April 2020, for example, Mr. Trump tweeted \\u201cLiberate Michigan!\\u201d \\u2014 a reference to early coronavirus restrictions put in place in the state. Within a month, heavily-armed protesters started gathering at the statehouse in Lansing to denounce the governor\\u2019s stay-at-home order.\", \"\\u201cExtremists, in Trump\\u2019s case, found a champion for their cause in the highest office,\\u201d Mr. Segal said, because Mr. Trump mirrored their sense of grievance, anger and rage. \\u201cHe sounds like them,\\u201d he added. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why they react.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3c0b2b4683c611ecb395119b836d2659"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3c0b2b4683c611ecb395119b836d2659"}},
