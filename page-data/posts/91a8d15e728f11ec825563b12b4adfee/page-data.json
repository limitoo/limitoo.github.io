But scientists warn that time is fast running out.\", \"The environmental, human and economic costs of hotter temperatures are already being seen globally.\", \"Europe lived through its warmest summer, and temperature records in western US and Canada were broken by several degrees. Extreme wildfires in July and August burnt almost entire towns to the ground and killed hundreds.\", \"\\\"These events are a stark reminder of the need to change our ways, take decisive and effective steps toward a sustainable society and work towards reducing net carbon emissions,\\\" Carlo Buontempo, director of the Copernicus Climate Change Service, explains.\", \"The Copernicus data comes from a constellation of Sentinel satellites that monitor the Earth from orbit, as well as measurements taken at ground level.\", \"Copernicus data showed that 2021 was the fifth-hottest on record, marginally warmer than 2015 and 2018. Taken together, the past seven years were the hottest seven years on record by a clear margin, the agency explained.\", \"The 2021 average temperature was 1.1-1.2C above the pre-industrial level around 150 years ago.\", \"The agency said that the start of the year saw relatively low temperatures compared to recent years, but that by June monthly temperatures were at least among the warmest four recorded.\", \"Places with above average temperatures included the west coast of US and Canada, north-east Canada and Greenland, large parts of north and central Africa, and the Middle East.\", \"The weather phenomenon known as La Ni\\u00f1a - when surface sea temperatures are cooler - contributed to below-average temperatures in western and eastern Siberia, Alaska, and the central and eastern Pacific during the start and end of 2021.\", \"Niwa meteorologist Chris Brandolino told Morning Report its 2021 annual climate summary for New Zealand will be unveiled this morning.\", \"\\\"If you just look at the seasons, we had the warmest winter on record, we had the second warmest spring on record, we had the 10th warmest autumn on record, the warmest November on records.\", \"\\\"We had the flooding events in Canterbury, flooding events in Westport, we had drought earlier [last] year across much of the motu, some flooding in Gisborne as well, so a lot of extreme events have happened here in Aotearoa/ New Zealand.\", \"\\\"Continuation of the warmth, that's a theme we can't get away from.

The growth rate of methane was also higher than in 2020 - Copernicus said both rates were very high compared to the past two decades of satellite data.\", \"Scientists say it is important to reduce methane levels because it is more potent than CO2, however it lasts much less time in the Earth's atmosphere.\", \"The increasing concentrations of these gases showed no signs of slowing down, concluded Vincent-Henri Peuch, Director of the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service.\", \"More data about 2021's temperatures will be released in the coming days from other agencies including from Nasa and the UK's Met Office.\", \"- BBC / RNZ\"]","href_hash":"91a8d15e728f11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"91a8d15e728f11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
