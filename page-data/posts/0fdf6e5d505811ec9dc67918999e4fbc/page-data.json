Tighter testing rules for travelers arriving from abroad would also go into effect that day.\", \"But the government has rejected the idea of ordering people to work from home where possible, introducing vaccine passports in England or requiring masks in restaurants. \\u201cThis is about taking proportionate action against the risks we face,\\u201d Mr. Javid told the BBC on Sunday.\", \"Still, he admitted that the two cases of the variant were unlikely to be the only ones. \\u201cThere may well be more cases, and that is why when we confirmed these two cases yesterday \\u2014 one in Essex and one in Nottingham \\u2014 we immediately went about making sure we had properly traced all their contacts,\\u201d he said.\", \"Britain began suspending flights from six southern African nations on Friday, but some travelers had already arrived in London by the time the measure took effect.\", \"Passengers landing in London on Friday were not tested at the airport and were able to leave as usual, including by public transport. Mr. Javid said that all travelers who had arrived from southern Africa within the past 10 days were being contacted and asked to take tests.\", \"\\u201cWe could not have acted more swiftly,\\u201d he said.\", \"By contrast, in Amsterdam, Dutch health officials tested more than 500 passengers who arrived on Friday on two flights from South Africa. Those who were negative were allowed to leave the airport and quarantine at home, or to continue their journeys.\", \"Mr. Javid also urged Britons to quickly get booster shots and said he expected advice \\u201cimminently\\u201d from scientific experts on expanding the scope of the country\\u2019s vaccine program, especially with regard to boosters.\", \"Such measures would, he added, help to \\u201cprotect the progress we have made so we can continue to look forward to Christmas with family and friends.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"0fdf6e5d505811ec9dc67918999e4fbc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0fdf6e5d505811ec9dc67918999e4fbc"}},
