Some people may still experience more severe illness with Omicron.\", \"\\\"It may be milder, but the case numbers ... will be larger.\\\"\", \"She said every booster that a New Zealander received would help reduce the spread of Omicron.\", \"Ardern said there's no reason to think New Zealand would necessarily be an exception to the rapid spread of Omicron we've seen overseas, unless we do everything we can.\", \"One of the main changes under the phased plan includes an increased focus on providing care for people at home.

She said part of it is tied to oil prices.\", \"Ardern said what's important to note is that it's likely Omicron would not be the last variant New Zealanders dealt with.\", \"She said the rapid antigen tests held by the Ministry of Health were those it has ordered.
