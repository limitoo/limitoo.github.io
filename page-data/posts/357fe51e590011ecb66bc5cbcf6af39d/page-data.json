She was 93.\", \"The culture minister, Dario Franceschini, said in a statement that Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller\\u2019s \\u201cclass and unmistakable style\\u201d had left its mark on Italian and world cinema, The Associated Press reported. \\u201cGrazie, Lina,\\u201d he said.\", \"She was the first woman to receive an Academy Award nomination for best director, for \\u201cSeven Beauties\\u201d (1975).\", \"Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller, an Italian despite the German-sounding last name, burst onto the cinematic scene with a series of idiosyncratic films that propelled her to the front rank of European directors. All had screenplays written by her, and most relied on the talents of her two favorite actors: Giancarlo Giannini, usually cast as a hapless male chauvinist victimized by the injustices of Italian society and baffled by women, and Mariangela Melato as the always difficult and complicated love interest.\", \"In the broad sense, Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller was a political filmmaker, but no one could ever quite figure out what the politics were. A lively sense of human limitations tempered her natural bent toward anarchy. Struggle was noble and the social structure rotten, but the outcome was always in doubt.\", \"Antiquated codes of honor undo the title character in \\u201cThe Seduction of Mimi,\\u201d a dimwitted Sicilian laborer, played by Mr. Giannini, whose neglected wife stages a sexual revolt. In \\u201cSwept Away\\u201d (1974), Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller upended the Italian power structure by giving the humble deckhand Gennarino (Mr. Giannini again) absolute power over the rich and arrogant Raffaella (Ms. Mercato) after a shipwreck.\", \"After being dominated and abused, Gennarino turns the tables, and Raffaella becomes his adoring slave \\u2014 until the two are rescued, and the old order reasserts itself. Feminists objected. With a characteristic bit of obfuscation, Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller explained that since Raffaella embodies bourgeois society, \\u201ctherefore she represents the man.\\u201d\", \"In \\u201cSeven Beauties\\u201d (1975), Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller again courted outrage by using a German concentration camp as the setting for a grim comedy, with farcical overtones. This time, Mr. Giannini played Pasqualino Farfuso, a craven Neapolitan deserter and two-bit charmer who, determined to survive at all costs, seduces the camp\\u2019s sadistic female commandant and, directed by her, murders other prisoners. Critics were divided over the merits of the film, but it earned Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller the Oscar nomination. Not until 1994, when Jane Campion was nominated for \\u201cThe Piano,\\u201d would another woman be nominated.\", \"Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller\\u2019s reputation, always more elevated in the United States than in Europe, remained uncertain. With \\u201cSeven Beauties,\\u201d the critic John Simon wrote, Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller ascended \\u201cinto the highest regions of cinematic art, into the company of the major directors.\\u201d The critic David Thomson, on the other hand, ascribed her American popularity in the 1970s as \\u201cprobably inevitable in a country ravenous for a female purveyor of smart cultural artifacts.\\u201d\", \"And her brand of sexual politics encountered hostility from critics like Pauline Kael, Molly Haskell and Ellen Willis, who called her \\u201ca woman-hater who pretends to be a feminist.\\u201d\", \"Tiny and voluble, with a fierce smile and instantly recognizable white-framed eyeglasses, Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller disarmed criticism by unleashing verbal torrents of explanation in a gravelly alto. Vincent Canby, after listening to her hold forth during a publicity tour for her first English-language film, \\u201cThe End of the World in Our Usual Bed on a Night Full of Rain\\u201d (1978), wrote in The New York Times that she spoke \\u201cwith enthusiasm and at such length and so articulately that (to vary an old Hollywood joke) it seems Warner Brothers might do better to scrap the film and distribute the director.\\u201d\", \"Arcangela Felice Assunta Wertm\\u00fcller von Elgg Spa\\u00f1ol von Braueich was born in Rome on Aug. 14, 1928, to a family of noble Swiss ancestry. Her mother was the former Maria Santamaria-Maurizio; her father, Federico, was a successful lawyer and a domestic tyrant with whom she quarreled constantly. After obtaining a teaching certificate she hedged her bets by enrolling simultaneously in law school and a Stanislavskian drama academy in Rome. Theater won out.\", \"During the 1950s, Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller toured with a puppet theater, wrote musical comedies for television and worked as an actress and stage manager. Her best friend, married to Marcello Mastroianni, introduced her to Federico Fellini, who hired her as an assistant director on \\u201c8\\u00bd,\\u201d a life-changing experience that opened the world of film to her.\", \"In 1963 she directed her own film, \\u201cThe Lizards,\\u201d a study of provincial life in the vein of Fellini\\u2019s \\u201cI Vitelloni.\\u201d It was followed by the quirky \\u201cLet\\u2019s Talk About Men\\u201d (1965), a study of sexual politics that foreshadowed her later explorations of the subject.\", \"Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller\\u2019s long collaboration with Mr. Giannini began in television, when she directed him in the musical \\u201cRita the Mosquito\\u201d (1966) and its sequel \\u201cDon\\u2019t Sting the Mosquito\\u201d (1967), whose art director, Enrico Job, she married in 1968.\", \"Mr. Job died in 2008. Information on survivors was not immediately available. \", \"The 1970s presented Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller with two of her richest subjects: the changing sexual politics brought about by feminism, and increasing political turbulence in Italy, as old social structures and attitudes buckled under the pressures of modernity. \\u201cThe Seduction of Mimi,\\u201d chosen as an official entry at the Cannes festival in 1972, immediately established her as an important new filmmaker. \\u201cLove and Anarchy\\u201d (1973), with Mr. Giannini playing a bumbling country boy who tries to assassinate Mussolini, and the social satire \\u201cAll Screwed Up\\u201d (1974), solidified her reputation for idiosyncratic political films blending tragedy and farce.\", \"Somewhat paradoxically her career went into steep decline after the Academy nomination, although in 2019 she received an honorary Oscar for her work, and in 2016 she was the subject of a documentary, \\u201cBehind the White Glasses.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe bubble seemed to burst,\\u201d the British critic Derek Malcolm told The Guardian, adding that \\u201cshe could do nothing right.\\u201d\", \"The titles of the films grew even longer, and the critical response more uniformly hostile. \\u201cThe End of the World,\\u201d with Candice Bergen as an American photographer and feminist engaged in marital struggle with an Italian communist played by Mr. Giannini, was roundly dismissed as raucous and incoherent. Each succeeding film seemed to bear out Michael Wood\\u2019s observation, in The New York Review of Books, that Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller\\u2019s work displayed \\u201ca stunning visual intelligence accompanied by a great confusion of mind.\\u201d\", \"By the early 1990s she had qualified for inclusion in Variety\\u2019s \\u201cMissing Persons\\u201d column. \\u201cCiao, Professore\\u201d (1994), about a schoolteacher from northern Italy mistakenly transferred to a poor school near Naples, suggested a return to form, but on a small scale, and with an unexpected sweetness. For perhaps the first time in her career, Ms. Wertm\\u00fcller faced the charge of sentimentality.\", \"To this, as to all criticism, she responded by invoking the ultimate authority: herself. Her films, she liked to say, were made to please an audience of one, and her methods were intuitive.\", \"\\u201cI am sure of things only because I love them,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI am born first. Only then do I discover.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"357fe51e590011ecb66bc5cbcf6af39d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"357fe51e590011ecb66bc5cbcf6af39d"}},
