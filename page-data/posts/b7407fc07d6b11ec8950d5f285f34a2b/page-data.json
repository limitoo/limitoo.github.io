And then we're just trying to finish the animals through various different feeds to provide that marbling and fat colour.\", \"\\\"So we're really not focusing on the traditional grain feed segment. We're really trying to do things a little bit differently.\\\"\", \"Drury said farmer interest in the programme had been high.\", \"\\\"A big part of it is actually educating the farmers about what the programs mean, what they'll need to do on the farm that's different and how they can create the right animals that will give them the best results. So, we're in our early days yet but it's certainly a really interesting opportunity for farmers to participate in the value added part of the business.\\\"\", \"Farmers who start the programme now will have fully grown wagyu ready for processing in about three years, Drury said.\"]","href_hash":"b7407fc07d6b11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b7407fc07d6b11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
