Even during a two-year hiatus from the series in 2010-11 after leaving Ferrari, he never switched off from motorsports.\", \"Raikkonen competed in the World Rally Championship and raced in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series and the NASCAR Nationwide Series, now the NASCAR Xfinity Series.\", \"But since 2001, Formula 1 has dominated. After what will be his 349th start in the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on Sunday, Raikkonen bows out. This time maybe for good.\", \"\\u201cI was two years away, but over the years I\\u2019ve thought about stopping many times,\\u201d Raikkonen, 42, said in an interview. \\u201cNow I want to have more time at home with the kids; they grow up quickly.\", \"\\u201cI want to do more things with the family. We\\u2019ve not really had the opportunity to live as a family because of my schedule. That changed everything.\\u201d\", \"Raikkonen has two children, Robin, 6, and Rianna, 4. They have changed his perspective on life.\", \"\\u201cYou know kids, from when they\\u2019re 2 years old they start doing a lot of things,\\u201d Raikkonen said. \\u201cRobin is in the first class in school, so it\\u2019s all different now. It doesn\\u2019t feel like six years ago when he was born.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s been hard to be away a lot, and it\\u2019s not the nicest thing for them, but on the other hand, it\\u2019s all they\\u2019ve known.\\u201d\", \"Raikkonen started racing in Formula 1 in 2001 with Sauber, joining McLaren the following year for five seasons before moving to Ferrari in 2007 when he won his only world title.\", \"He joined Lotus in 2012 and then did a second spell with Ferrari for five seasons from 2014.\", \"For the last three years, he has driven for Alfa Romeo, where he has struggled to score points. \\u201cI\\u2019ve enjoyed the racing, the driving, solving the issues that we come across,\\u201d Raikkonen said. \\u201cThe rest, I never enjoyed it, but that\\u2019s part of F1. Obviously, there have been good days and bad days, but it\\u2019s the same in normal life.\\u201d\", \"He has played to his Iceman nickname over the years \\u2014 cool on the track under pressure, cold in interviews off it, although he has thawed over time and become more personable.\", \"Sebastian Vettel, a four-time champion who was Raikkonen\\u2019s teammate for four years with Ferrari from 2015-18, said he would be missed.\", \"\\u201cHe is a true character, and I enjoyed the time that I had with him as a teammate,\\u201d Vettel said. \\u201cI got to know him before then, and he is probably one of the very few drivers I have met that from Day 1 until the present day hasn\\u2019t changed.\", \"\\u201cHe has always been very open. I don\\u2019t think you can have an argument or a problem with Kimi. If you do, the problem is not him, the problem is you. He is a great person.\\u201d\", \"Fernando Alonso, who started in Formula 1 the same year as Raikkonen, said his honesty was an appealing part of his character.\", \"\\u201cHe maybe has this mask of being cold, of being the Iceman, but there is a very good person inside that you meet from time to time outside of the circuits,\\u201d Alonso, a two-time champion, said.\", \"\\u201cWe have met in airports, restaurants, and Kimi is a different person. He has been outstanding for Formula 1, and he will be missed because he has his own character, and he was different.\\u201d\", \"So what next for Raikkonen? At this stage, he does not know, and he likes it that way.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t have any plans,\\u201d Raikkonen said. \\u201cI\\u2019ll do normal things and see what comes up. If it\\u2019s something interesting then maybe I\\u2019ll do something.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to make plans because right now I have the freedom to do things with the family.\\u201d\", \"But have we seen the last of him on a track? Maybe not. He said, \\u201cI\\u2019m always open to listen if it\\u2019s something that makes sense.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c3e3bce158d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c3e3bce158d811ec961d7d3ec266172e"}},
