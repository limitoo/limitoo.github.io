it was back to \\\"into the unknown\\\".\", \"It's a key song used in the children's movie series that captures that awful dread one feels when they stare into a situation or scenario they cannot see through.\", \"At some point on Friday afternoon, news flashed up on trading terminals across the globe, indicating the new strain of COVID-19 found in South Africa may be resistant to the vaccine that's just been rolled out around\\u00a0the world.\", \"It created a sense of panic, and some markets on Wall Street went into free fall.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">One bitten, twice shy</div>\", \"The World Health Organization (WHO) called a special meeting to discuss the new COVID-19 variant.\", \"However, the comment that struck fear into the hearts of those moving money was that the

hundreds of stocks that all have a measurable value.\", \"So, when news hits trading terminals across the country, investors have to work out how that information changes the value, and therefore price, of the stocks they own.\", \"It's no surprise then that stocks like Flight Centre (-7pc), Qantas (-5pc) and Corporate Travel Management (-5pc) all fell sharply.\", \"Analysts, in a short space of time, re-entered lower future revenue numbers for these businesses, effectively pricing in more travel uncertainty and potential international border closures.\", \"<div
