Or at least: Some literary biography is modifying its field of play and, without deviating from the highest standards of scholarship, stretching toward essay and even life writing. Recent examples include Charlotte Gordon\\u2019s \\u201cRomantic Outlaws\\u201d (2015), which juxtaposes the lived experiences of Mary Wollstonecraft and her daughter Mary Shelley; and Mark Doty\\u2019s \\u201cWhat Is the Grass: Walt Whitman in My Life\\u201d (2020), a memoir of poetic and personal influence. These works don\\u2019t attempt to replace the compendious authority of traditional biography but, rather, enter into dialogue with it by reflecting more on some facts in a life and its work than on others.\", \"Joe Moshenska\\u2019s \\u201cMaking Darkness Light: A Life of John Milton\\u201d is among the latest contributions to this shift. Arguably it could not be otherwise, since Milton, usually considered Britain\\u2019s greatest poet after William Shakespeare, has been the subject of numerous authoritative studies, including, most recently, biographies by Nicholas McDowell (2020) and by Gordon Campbell and Thomas Corns (2008). Moshenska is a scholar of 16th- and 17th-century literature, who teaches at the University of Oxford, facts he alludes to more than once. In this context, an engagement with Milton might be considered a professional necessity.\", \"No sense of the merely dutiful constrains \\u201cMaking Darkness Light,\\u201d however. Moshenska takes as his chapter headings significant dates in the poet\\u2019s life, along with titles of his poems and phrases from his verse. They structure Moshenska\\u2019s account, which unfolds as a series of set pieces or freeze frames. In Part I, these include Milton\\u2019s birth on Dec. 9, 1608, in Bread Street, London, just east of St. Paul\\u2019s Cathedral; family music-making (Milton\\u2019s father was a serious amateur musician); and the language-based classical education, mixed with corporal punishment, of his days at St. Paul\\u2019s School. A fourth chapter evokes Milton\\u2019s studies at Christ\\u2019s College, Cambridge, including a Christmas holiday in 1629 during which he wrote the \\u201cNativity Ode\\u201d that opens his \\u201cPoems\\u201d of 1645.\", \"In Parts II and III, which deal with the poet\\u2019s maturity, the absence of much surviving documentation of Milton\\u2019s private life means the chapters are largely arranged around key compositions or public activities, including travel in Europe. For Milton was not only a poet; he became a writer of influential political and theological tracts and, until Oliver Cromwell\\u2019s death in 1658, served as a civil servant for the Commonwealth, despite having lost his sight entirely a few years earlier. The failure of the Puritan revolution and the restoration of King Charles II in 1660 forced him to withdraw from public life until his death in 1674, creating a period of retirement in which he was able once more to concentrate on poetry.\", \"Bridging Milton\\u2019s double trajectory \\u2014 as both a poet and a political and religious thinker \\u2014 is one of the challenges a biographer must address. Moshenska does so in two ways. His first and less successful strategy, initiated in his introduction, is to pursue the idea that poor sight could have encouraged his subject to see through or beyond the quotidian. By Chapter 4, focused on Milton\\u2019s productive 1629 Christmas holiday, Moshenska has arrived at the image of a pair of eyes looking in different directions: \\u201cOne eye flits over the familiar sights and textures of home. \\u2026 The other eye scours a landscape: follows its paths and byways \\u2026 winds through its valleys and hills.\\u201d\", \"The question of sight is of undoubted significance for a visionary poet such as Milton became, and not only because he was blind for roughly half his adult life. His sonnet \\u201cWhen I consider how my light is spent\\u201d is among the best-known and earliest surviving poems of disabled experience. But there is no suggestion that Milton suffered from strabismus (the disorder in which one\\u2019s eyes do not line up in the same direction), and Moshenska\\u2019s decision to extend this metaphor over several pages of poetic prose is unfortunate.\", \"More interesting is the way he brings both aspects of his subject\\u2019s life together under the rubric of writing. This is a Milton who, while still at Cambridge, has \\u201ca deep and durable conviction that he was destined to write,\\u201d although it seems almost anachronistic to have professed such a belief at the time. But he was, after all, a member of an emergent middle class, with the means to entertain such plans. His father was a moneylender as well as a musician, and Milton too would become both a moneylender and a landlord.\", \"In 1637 the death by shipwreck of a Christ\\u2019s College contemporary, Edward King, inspired Milton\\u2019s pastoral elegy \\u201cLycidas,\\u201d of which Moshenska gleefully inquires, \\u201cIs there a more gruesomely satisfying set of five words to say aloud in all of English poetry than \\u2018slits the thin-spun life\\u2019?\\u201d Having left Cambridge around 1632, Milton was now living with his parents on the outskirts of London, during a post-university interlude in which he also composed the major poems \\u201cL\\u2019Allegro\\u201d and \\u201cIl Penseroso,\\u201d and, in 1634, the masque \\u201cComus,\\u201d commissioned by the Earl of Bridgewater for a performance at Ludlow Castle on the Welsh border.\", \"In 1638, equipped with a letter of introduction to the ambassador in Paris, Milton left England for more than a year of European travel. Here Moshenska takes the opportunity to invent a dinner in Paris in which he seats the poet next to Sir Kenelm Digby, a polymath and contemporary of Milton\\u2019s \\u2014 though there is no evidence the two ever met \\u2014 who was the subject of one of Moshenska\\u2019s earlier books. The dinner is one of several fictional passages that replace close readings of supporting evidence \\u2014 from correspondence to household bills \\u2014 as to what kind of man Milton may have been, and serve only to make us feel that the book is not so much a distillation of research as a self-portrait of the don as creative writer. We do know that the trip\\u2019s subsequent Italian leg would furnish Milton with material for his later condemnation of Roman Catholicism, both in an unpublished theological work, \\u201cDe Doctrina Christiana,\\u201d and in \\u201cParadise Regained,\\u201d where Satan praises the \\u201cpillars and roofs / Carved work, the hand of famed artificers\\u201d of \\u201cgreat and glorious Rome.\\u201d\", \"Milton married three times, and the three daughters of his first unhappy marriage survived into adulthood. It was this marriage \\u2014 to Mary Powell, a woman less than half his age who within weeks left him to return to her family (though she eventually rejoined him) \\u2014 that, as Moshenska notes, may have inspired his arguments in support of divorce, made in several pamphlets published between 1643 and 1645.\", \"These were among a series of prose tracts he issued during this decade, arguing against the episcopacy and press censorship and in favor of Puritan, parliamentary principles. In 1642, the first of the three English civil wars had broken out, and as a result, in March 1649, following the execution of King Charles I, Milton was appointed secretary for foreign tongues. After he lost his sight, much of the job was executed by assistants. When Cromwell died, Milton was slow to relinquish the republican cause, continuing to publish tracts in its favor until the restoration of Charles II caused him to go briefly into hiding, and, also briefly, to prison \\u2014 dramatic interludes alas not covered in detail here.\", \"For the last 14 years of his life, Milton lived quietly, working as a writer with amanuenses, including his apparently not always eager daughters. It was in this final, impoverished period that he produced not only textbooks (a Latin grammar, a history of Britain) but also the pair of Christian epic poems, \\u201cParadise Lost\\u201d and \\u201cParadise Regained\\u201d (the latter was published together with the closet drama \\u201cSamson Agonistes\\u201d), that are central to his literary legacy.\", \"\\u201cMaking Darkness Light\\u201d chooses the ground it highlights, and comes alive in its alert close readings. However, Moshenska\\u2019s use of fictional elements in his discussion of Milton\\u2019s life is less effective. Surely the goal of more creative approaches to literary biography is to interpret facts and texts in new ways without eroding traditional standards of scholarship. Of course, it may be easier to flesh out actual occurrence without resorting to invention when dealing with more recent lives, for which greater detail, in the form of letters, journals, newspapers and other sources, survives. But literary biography should be based on a scrupulous, trustworthy close reading of evidence both literary and biographical.\"]","href_hash":"ce4d18005d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ce4d18005d9111ecbe9957922c1f758d"}},
