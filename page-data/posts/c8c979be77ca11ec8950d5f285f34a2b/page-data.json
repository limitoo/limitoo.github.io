It's more transmissible [and] the vaccine isn't as effective in terms of transmission, so it's important we do look at those settings.\\\"\", \"It comes after vaccinations started for children aged 5 to 11 on Monday, meaning about 476,000 kids are now eligible to be immunised against the virus.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"c8c979be77ca11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c8c979be77ca11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
