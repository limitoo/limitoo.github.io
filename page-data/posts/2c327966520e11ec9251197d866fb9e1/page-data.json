Gone are the icy, sparkling boughs and the imagery of a woman isolated in a winter wonderland (or a horror story, depending on your point of view).\", \"In their place: red-and-white striped knit stockings with green heels dangling brightly from a hearth, family photos, handwritten thank-you notes and an arch of presents in bright red boxes.\", \"The Biden White House Christmas d\\u00e9cor, unveiled on Monday, isn\\u2019t nearly as stylized or surreal as the Trump-endorsed looks that preceded them. Oh, it\\u2019s plenty cheerful and sparkly, but in the context of recent White House holiday styles, it\\u2019s positively \\u2026 accessible.\", \"In this, it is fully in line with the tactile, unpretentious image that the current first couple likes to project. The president and first lady: Just like us! Their home is your home, only a little more so. It did, after all, require 6,000 feet of ribbon, over 300 candles, more than 10,000 ornaments and about 78,750 holiday lights to dress the White House for the holidays, according to the office of the first lady.\", \"That may sound extravagant, but like Dr. Jill Biden herself, whose (unofficial) job it is to oversee the decoration, the effect was rather homey \\u2014 social media categorized it as \\u201cnormal.\\u201d Whether the response was complimentary or pejorative, it nodded to part of her husband\\u2019s campaign sell: a return to normalcy, after the turbulence and extremes of the Trump years. Since his election, it\\u2019s been an underlying theme, a foundational element of \\u201cBuild Back Better.\\u201d For the holidays, it\\u2019s \\u201cGifts From the Heart.\\u201d\", \"That\\u2019s why Christmas at the White House is such a useful moment of pageantry, especially at a time when the usual communicative ceremonies of office \\u2014 state dinners, White House tours \\u2014 are on hold. Indeed, Dr. Biden\\u2019s office said she had been working on the decorations since late May. Decking the halls is one of the few widely shared, or at least widely recognized, rituals we have. That\\u2019s useful. Most people can relate.\", \"It\\u2019s why Melania Trump\\u2019s choices caused so much controversy. Some \\u2014 especially late-night TV hosts \\u2014 found her alley of unnatural trees alienating; others saw them as aspirational, if unachievable (and all the more desirable for being so out of reach). And it\\u2019s why the fact that the Biden look is so unremarkable is, itself, worth remarking on. It\\u2019s a hard balancing act to pull off: walking the fine line between fancy and folksy; between representing the republic to the most polished degree, and relating to the republic. Not just politically, but visually.\", \"Yet it\\u2019s a look that has come to define Dr. Biden\\u2019s style, which can pretty much be summed up in the dress she wore to do her Christmas hostess duties: a short-sleeved, full-skirted forest green Oscar de la Renta number splashed with white magnolias. Oscar de la Renta is, of course, a New York-based luxury brand, founded by a Dominican, now designed by Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia; a similar style, albeit pink and sleeveless, is available at Saks for $3,990. That\\u2019s a lot for a dress, even one worn for an occasion that will be documented in photos for posterity.\", \"But what about two occasions? Or three? Because the workaround Dr. Biden has devised and made her own is not to do what Rosalynn Carter did, when she was attempting to be relatable during the stagflation of the late 1970s, and wear seemingly homespun clothes (that got Mrs. Carter criticized for being frumpy), but rather to wear very expensive, high-end clothes \\u2014 to represent both the American fashion industry and the ambitions of the country \\u2014 and then to re-wear them.\", \"She did it during her first international trip, during the G7 in June, and when she represented the president at the Tokyo Olympics. And she did it again with her Christmas dress, which she wore only a month before \\u2014 in Italy for a lunch with spouses at the G20. This week she wore it to read to a class of second graders and to thank a group of volunteers who helped with the decorations, but chances are it will get another airing sometime soon.\", \"It may seem absurd to laud someone for re-wearing an expensive dress, or to see it as anything other than normal behavior, but then, that\\u2019s the point. Because for the last few administrations \\u2014 and for many people in the public eye, even if it\\u2019s only the eye of Instagram \\u2014 the pressure to promote new stuff was an accepted part of the job. It\\u2019s extremely rare to see a celebrity wear the same thing twice (most of them don\\u2019t even want to wear a dress once it\\u2019s arrived in stores); such was also the case for Michelle Obama and Melania Trump during their times as first ladies.\", \"Like them, Dr. Biden understands that decoration \\u2014 of her house, of her person \\u2014 is a tool at her disposal, but unlike them she is using it to normalize what is by any account an abnormal role. Just like the way she is using tinsel and turtledoves. They are secular expressions of the \\u201cfaith, family and friendship\\u201d described in the welcome letter of the commemorative 2021 White House Holiday Guide: everyday examples of the things \\u2014 sometimes as simple as favorite shirtdresses and poinsettias \\u2014 that \\u201cunite us.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"2c327966520e11ec9251197d866fb9e1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2c327966520e11ec9251197d866fb9e1"}},
