As the temperature dips amid India\\u2019s most important festival season, people are crowding markets and hosting unmasked friends and family indoors. And the government is telling vaccination campaign volunteers like Namanjaya Khobragade that they are no longer needed.\", \"\\u201cNow is not the time to let our guard down,\\u201d said Ms. Khobragade, a coordinator for a health nonprofit in the eastern state of Jharkhand. \\u201cMany people have taken just the first vaccine. We cannot leave them like this. We need to increase the intensity.\\u201d\", \"India\\u2019s progress represents a significant step toward ending the crisis globally and stands as an important political win for Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose government came under heavy criticism for failing to prepare for a devastating second wave that struck earlier this year. After the virus killed tens of thousands of people, India\\u2019s government threw money at boosting vaccine production, stopped vaccine exports and tossed out cumbersome rules that had made it hard for state governments to get doses and for people to sign up for shots.\", \"By official figures, daily infections have plunged to about 12,000 per day, from about 42,000 four months ago. Deaths, too, have fallen by half, to about 400 per day.\", \"Experts consider India\\u2019s statistics on infections and deaths to be a gross undercount. Still, normal life has returned in many parts of the country. Shopping malls are crowded, roads are full of traffic, and children who have been out of school since March 2020 finally returned to classrooms this month.\", \"But with only one-quarter of its vast population fully vaccinated, India remains deeply vulnerable. The possibility that a dangerous variant will emerge remains a concern.\", \"The central government appears to acknowledge that India has lost a step. Shortly after returning from the climate conference in Scotland, Mr. Modi led a meeting focused on parts of the country where fewer than half the residents are fully vaccinated.\", \"\\u201cNow we are preparing to take the vaccination campaign to each household,\\u201d he said in a statement, adding that officials would take a \\u201cknock on every door\\u201d approach toward \\u201cevery household lacking the security net of a double dose of vaccine.\\u201d\", \"Complacency contributed to the devastation of the second wave. In January, with India reporting case numbers comparable to this fall\\u2019s, Mr. Modi declared victory over the coronavirus. The government, encouraged by a flawed mathematical model that showed the pandemic had all but ended in India, prioritized vaccines for health care workers and older people with conditions that made them more likely to die from Covid-19.\", \"For everybody else, the government moved more slowly. The Serum Institute of India, the world\\u2019s largest vaccine maker, set aside 100 million doses of the AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine for its home country in January. That month, Mr. Modi\\u2019s government bought just 11 million doses. It exported more than five times that number as far afield as the Caribbean.\", \"\\u201cThere was an unfortunate sense of overconfidence that the pandemic had ended with India,\\u201d said Dr. K. Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India.\", \"Then the second wave hit. At its peak in May, India was reporting more than 400,000 new cases each day. Demand for vaccines skyrocketed. To cope, Mr. Modi\\u2019s government introduced a vaccine pricing system intended to direct doses to those with the greatest need. Instead, cities fought over limited supplies and corporations stockpiled, worsening the shortages.\", \"By June, five months into the national vaccination campaign, just over 3 percent of the population had been inoculated.\", \"As criticism from opposition parties grew, Mr. Modi centralized the procurement and distribution of vaccines. India\\u2019s inoculation program hit its stride, making use of the systems and know-how that had made vaccine campaigns against polio and other diseases such a success.\", \"He shelled out billions of dollars \\u2014 the government has not disclosed the precise amount \\u2014 from India\\u2019s budget for an advance payment deal that allowed the Serum Institute to ramp up production to 220 million doses per month. It struck a similar deal with another Indian vaccine maker, Bharat Biotech.\", \"With supplies shored up, Mr. Modi\\u2019s government enlisted an army of volunteers, including paramilitary forces, teachers and religious leaders, to help get shots into arms.\", \"Nonprofit aid groups and charities with long histories of supporting public health campaigns were brought in to help organize the push. Priests and clerics were dispatched to reassure hesitant villagers.\", \"In one village in the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, residents agreed to be vaccinated only after officials trekked hours up a mountain to consult local deities. Elsewhere, in India\\u2019s remote northeast, villagers received vaccine doses by drone.\", \"The Serum Institute now says the government has cumulatively purchased one billion doses. More than three out of four adults have received at least one shot. Mr. Modi\\u2019s government is now so confident that it will fully vaccinate all adults, some 900 million people, by the end of the year that it has lifted its eight-month ban on vaccine exports.\", \"At a meeting of the world\\u2019s largest economies in Rome last month, Mr. Modi said that India would be able to supply five billion doses toward the global vaccination effort next year.\", \"That may be good news for the world, but at home, health experts warn that the government needs to stay vigilant. Health workers are struggling to persuade millions of people to return for a second dose.\", \"The vaccination rate has fallen sharply from its peak on Mr. Modi\\u2019s birthday in September, when 25 million doses were administered, and now totals about three million per day. India still has to administer more than 700 million shots to reach its year-end goal, which at current rates looks increasingly unlikely unless India can repeat Mr. Modi\\u2019s birthday feat a few more times.\", \"\\u201cThere is hesitancy for going for the second dose because the community thinks, \\u2018Do we really need it now?\\u2019\\u201d said Dr. Jacob John, a public health physician in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The makeshift groups the government tapped to drive the vaccine push, he added, weren\\u2019t built for a sustained campaign.\", \"Delays could open opportunities for a new variant to strike or for immunity to ebb. Recent serological prevalence surveys, which measure antibodies that form in response to infection or a vaccine, show that some of India\\u2019s largest cities, including the capital of New Delhi, are reporting upward of 90 percent with antibodies.\", \"\\u201cBut it\\u2019s not a uniform distribution across the country,\\u201d Dr. Reddy said. \\u201cYou have pockets of vulnerability.\\u201d\", \"The Indian government seems to know that it has a long way to go. India recently applied for a $2 billion loan with the Asian Development Bank and Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank to buy doses for some 300 million more people.\", \"Administering a billion doses \\u201cis an important milestone,\\u201d N.K. Arora, the head of India\\u2019s National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration, wrote in a newspaper op-ed, \\u201cbut the fact is that there is still a long road to effectively control Covid.\\u201d\", \"In Jharkhand, Ms. Khobragade, the health worker, said myths remain rampant among some villagers that the vaccine is deadlier than the coronavirus, makes men impotent or \\u2014 among Muslim and Christian worriers \\u2014 converts people to Hinduism.\", \"Ms. Khobragade plunged into the vaccine campaign in April, when entire villages were coming down with Covid, and the constant smoke from funeral pyres blackened the skies of New Delhi.\", \"Now, with a major milestone reached, the state government is saying Ms. Khobragade can return to her work on maternal and infant health. It has withdrawn funding and the extra vaccine vans and nursing staff Ms. Khobragade relied upon to reach hesitant villagers.\", \"\\u201cThere is still huge vaccine hesitancy,\\u201d she said. \\u201cNow is no time to rest.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"227430c5414511eca54adbac1943da9b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"227430c5414511eca54adbac1943da9b"}},
