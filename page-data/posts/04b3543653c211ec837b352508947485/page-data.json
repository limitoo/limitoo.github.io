According to comments made in the video, it appears as though the TikToker pulled out her phone and began recording after the barista dropped her change onto the ground.\", \"\\\"Excuse me,\\\" said Sikeitsme7 to the barista.\", \"Upon noticing that the TikToker is recording the conversation, the barista responds: \\\"I'm not gonna be recorded and be harassed.\\\"\", \"As the barista begins to close the drive-thru window, the TikToker said: \\\"I'm asking you for my change.\\\"\", \"The barista opens the window, points to the ground and said, \\\"it's down there\\u2014it dropped.\\\"\", \"She closes the window again, and viewers can see her walk away from the drive-thru.\", \"Many restaurant workers have quit their jobs within the past year, according to Insider.
