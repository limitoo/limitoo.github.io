City officials are reported to be looking into moving some of the containers into vacant lots in Wilmington in order to help prevent further thefts.\", \"Officials have struggled to clear the backlogs of cargo at the ports, which have disrupted supply chains. At the start of the week, there were 77 container ships anchored off shore waiting to come to port to unload their cargo.\", \"\\\"The more that the supply chain in general is backed up, the more cargo you're going to have sitting. And that creates a bigger opportunity for thefts,\\\" Scott Cornell, a crime and theft specialist at insurance giant Travelers, told CBS MoneyWatch.\", \"In October, President Joe Biden said the Port of Los Angeles would begin operating 24 hours a day in order to help clear the supply chain issues, following on from a similar commitment made by the Port of Long Beach a few weeks ago.\", \"However, the ports say they can't operate 24/7 until trucking companies and warehouses also increase their operations.\", \"\\\"Twenty-four/seven system \\u2014 what most of the leading countries in the world already operate on now, except us, until now,\\\" Biden said.\", \"\\\"By staying open seven days a week, through the night and on the weekends, the Port of Los Angeles [will be open] 60 extra hours a week.\", \"\\\"In total, that will almost double the number of hours that the port is open for business from earlier this year. That means an increase in the hours for workers to be moving cargo off ships and onto trucks and railcars to get to their destination.\\\"\", \"A port official told NBC that all cargo containers were in safe locations on Monday.\", \"Around 40 percent of all shipping containers imported into the country come via the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.\", \"Union Pacific has been contacted for further comment.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1925213/port-thefts.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A cargo ship unloads its containers in the Port of Long Beach on October 28, 2021.
