His new book, \\u201cAuthority and Freedom,\\u201d begins and ends with a cri de coeur on behalf of the arts, the independence of which he believes is gravely endangered by the current imperative of social utility. His tone is urgent: \\u201cI want us to release art from the stranglehold of relevance \\u2014 from the insistence that works of art, whether classic or contemporary, are validated \\u2026 by the extent to which they line up with (or fail to line up with) our current social and political concerns.\\u201d\", \"This is emphatic language, promising a passionate j\\u2019accuse of those who he believes are bent on repurposing art to serve those social and political goals, in other words, to change the world. One expects that he\\u2019ll name names and cite specific examples of what he perceives as a dangerous drift that threatens the autonomy and integrity of the artist. But \\u2026 spoiler alert \\u2026 he never does.\", \"Perl\\u2019s thesis, most succinctly framed in his concluding chapter, is that the arts, rather than being obliged to convey utilitarian messaging, must instead remain \\u201cthe products of a process that stands apart from so much of our social, economic and political life.\\u201d And because they stand apart from it, \\u201cthey move us and excite us unlike anything else in our lives.\\u201d By making the mistake, no matter how well intentioned, of chaining works of art to politics or demanding that they address issues of social justice, we have \\u201cfailed to account for their free-standing value.\\u201d As Flannery O\\u2019Connor said of a popular novel of her time, the premise of which offended her own sense of artistic freedom, the book \\u201cis just propaganda and its being propaganda for the side of the angels only makes it worse. The novel is an art form and when you use it for anything other than art, you pervert it.\\u201d\", \"The Authority and Freedom of the book\\u2019s daunting title are the two poles of the artist\\u2019s way of being in the world. By embracing \\u201cauthority\\u201d you absorb the lessons and models of the past, its knowledge of traditions and conventions. But by asserting \\u201cfreedom\\u201d you engage in the act of breaking with those same traditions and conventions in order to \\u201cmake it new.\\u201d\", \"Perl\\u2019s use of the term \\u201cauthority\\u201d owes much to Hannah Arendt, whose two essays \\u201cWhat Is Authority?\\u201d and \\u201cWhat Is Freedom?\\u201d very likely prompted him to apply her meditations on power and totalitarianism to the enigma of how the arts should function in a free society. \\u201cAuthority\\u201d for Arendt is a positive value. She notes that the term derives from the Latin augere, \\u201cto augment.\\u201d By acknowledging authority we augment, literally \\u201cadd to,\\u201d the foundations upon which we maintain our social order. It is, in Perl\\u2019s words, the \\u201cancient tradition that the living embrace.\\u201d It follows that authority in the best sense of the word is conservative. It is rule-based, conventional (again, in the positive sense). For Perl it\\u2019s \\u201ca hierarchy of values about which a group of people agree.\\u201d It is the familiar, the canonical, the historical. It implies collectively acknowledged values by which we judge something, a kind of experiential grid through which we, either consciously or unconsciously, encounter and evaluate our impressions, whether they be familiar or strange, comforting or disturbing. Thus one speaks of the \\u201cauthority\\u201d of the rectangle that frames a painting, the \\u201cauthority\\u201d of the sonnet that organizes the poet\\u2019s utterance, the \\u201cauthority\\u201d of the sonata form that gives structure and meaning to the melodic and harmonic events of the musical discourse.\", \"In Perl\\u2019s lexicon \\u201cfreedom\\u201d is both the opposite of authority as well as its complement: It is everything that is intuitive, inventive, rule-breaking, fanciful, risk-taking, genre-defying, revolutionary \\u2014 in short, it comprises all those impulses that challenge convention and that, if rightly cultivated, keep the arts alive and in a state of constant evolution. The popular archetype of the creative artist, the radical, uncompromising, groundbreaking \\u201cgenius,\\u201d represents the more glamorous \\u201cfreedom\\u201d side of Perl\\u2019s equation. But whether it was Beethoven or van Gogh or Emily Dickinson or Jackson Pollock, each of them \\u201cuncompromising\\u201d and \\u201cradical\\u201d in the public\\u2019s imagination, all had a firm grounding in convention, and all had supreme command of the tools of their art. \\u201cArtistic freedom,\\u201d Perl writes, \\u201calways involves engaging with some idea of order, which becomes an authority that the artist understands and acknowledges but to which the artist doesn\\u2019t necessarily entirely submit.\\u201d\", \"Despite the anxious concerns about enforced relevance that inspired the book, \\u201cAuthority and Freedom\\u201d more often than not reads like a free-range cornucopia of revelatory encounters Perl has had with books, poetry, music, painting, sculpture, architecture, film and dance. He radiates sheer pleasure with his very personal responses to art of all kinds, writing with warmth and a sense of gratitude for the many peak experiences he\\u2019s had from a lifetime of engagement. Although he\\u2019s best known for his critical essays on painting and sculpture \\u2014 Perl was for years art columnist for The New Republic \\u2014 he is an omnivore of all media. At times his penchant for name-checking across centuries can become head-spinning: A single paragraph can bounce us from Homer to Michelangelo to Mallarm\\u00e9, Duchamp, Gertrude Stein and John Cage. He\\u2019ll see affinities everywhere \\u2014 between Picasso and Aretha Franklin, Mozart and Jane Austen, or among Balthus, Borges and Balanchine. But these points of reference are all at the service of his main leitmotif: that the art that endures, that transcends the time and place of its conception, is the product of an alchemical union of technical command, knowledge of precedent and a concomitant determination to break with that precedent.\", \"\\u201cOnly when artists have felt free enough to absorb the patterns and purposes of a particular art form can they begin to assert their own freedom,\\u201d he writes. It\\u2019s another way of reiterating the old saw, \\u201cYou need to know the rules in order to break them.\\u201d\", \"So it is baffling why, after Perl\\u2019s repeated alarms about the threat of \\u201crelevance,\\u201d he gives no examples of what exactly he sees that troubles him so. Who does he feel is exerting this pressure to be relevant? Is he addressing museums, dance and theater companies, symphony orchestras, all the cultural heavy hitters who, particularly in the wake of Black Lives Matter, are redirecting energy toward projects keyed to social justice? Is it the foundations, many of which are now targeting their funding to social causes? Would he approve or disapprove of a recent grant of $300,000 by the Hewlett Foundation to the California Shakespeare Theater, which \\u201credefines classical theater through the lenses of equity, diversity and inclusion\\u201d? Is pressure coming from critics who choose which art to discuss? Or is it the consumers of art themselves, audiences, gallery-goers, readers and listeners? We are left to connect the dots. One wonders whether the real reason for his silence here is the by now familiar threat of being canceled. As a result, the book tends to remain on the \\u201cmeta\\u201d plane much of the time \\u2014 earnest and thoughtful, but absent the cranky brio, the piss and vinegar of his art columns, as when for example he once wrote about Sigmar Polke as \\u201ca cross between a slob-provocateur and a brutish aesthete\\u201d who mingles \\u201cgadabout hedonism and ostentatious disaffection.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s unlikely that \\u201cAuthority and Freedom\\u201d will change many artists\\u2019 minds about how they view their work. They will do what they want, and many, if not most, today are ablaze with an intensity not seen since the 1930s to make their art speak truth to power, to heal what they deem the rent in our social fabric. If you ask them, they will tell you that art that doesn\\u2019t address this sense of urgency is not just out of touch with the times, it is irrelevant.\"]","href_hash":"cffe01ae738e11ecb916d918f9c2f0e8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cffe01ae738e11ecb916d918f9c2f0e8"}},
