These eukaryotic organisms, which include mushrooms, yeasts and moulds, fall under their own kingdom, and have more in common with animals, Sheldrake says.\", \"\\\"Unlike plants which make their own food by eating light and carbon dioxide \\u2026 fungi have to find food\\u00a0in the world ready-made and digest it as we do too,\\\" he explains.\", \"One\\u00a0fungus\\u00a0he is particularly interested in is the honey fungus. It's a group of fungi that can grow expansively beneath the soil's surface and it's known to kill and devour trees by cutting off the flow of their sap.\", \"They can be vast \\u2014 a honey fungus in Oregon is one of the largest known organisms in the world.\", \"\\\"That [honey fungus] spills over nearly 10 square kilometres and is somewhere between 2,000\\u20138,000 years old,\\\" he says.\", \"And there are probably many other larger specimens that remain undescribed, he adds.\", \"Another fungus he's interested in is mushrooms, and he's not the only one. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's funny you see in different cultures around the world a tendency to celebrate mushrooms or to fear them,\\\" Sheldrake says.\", \"\\\"Eastern European cultures tend to be really fond of them, and in Russia there are several common surnames which are the names of different species of mushroom, which is not something you find in English.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Zombie cicadas</div>\", \"Fungi can do a lot of things \\u2014 different types of fungi\\u00a0eat\\u00a0rock, make\\u00a0soil and digest\\u00a0pollutants.
