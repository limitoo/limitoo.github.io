The document is likely to exalt the leader as a peer of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping before his expected re-election at a party congress late next year.\", \"The summation is sure to become the focus of an intense indoctrination campaign \\u2014 in schools, films and television shows and via censorship laws \\u2014 that will shape China\\u2019s politics and society for decades. It will also insulate Xi from criticism and give his policies the gravitas of destiny.\", \"Mao led the country to stand up against oppression, Deng brought prosperity, and now Xi is propelling the nation into a new era of national strength, the epoch-defining summary reads. It devotes over a quarter of its 531 pages to his nine years in power, just a fraction of the party\\u2019s 100-year history. No Chinese leader in recent times has been more fixated than Xi on history and legacy.\", \"Quotable: \\u201cThis is about creating a new timescape for China around the Communist Party and Xi in which he is riding the wave of the past toward the future,\\u201d said Geremie Barm\\u00e9, a historian of China. \\u201cIt is not really a resolution about past history, but a resolution about future leadership.\\u201d\", \"Airports across the U.S. today are anticipating being filled with people reuniting with loved ones who have been prohibited from traveling directly to the country for more than a year and half.\", \"Travelers from 33 countries, including E.U. member states, were barred from the U.S. early in the pandemic. Under the new rules, travelers must show proof of full vaccination against the coronavirus and a negative test taken within three calendar days of travel. Unvaccinated Americans and children must test negative within 24 hours of travel.\", \"Within the U.S., many Americans seem stuck in a pandemic hangover of pessimism. More than 60 percent of voters in opinion surveys say that the country is heading in the wrong direction. The Biden administration\\u2019s sweeping new coronavirus vaccine mandates face new legal challenges, with opponents arguing that the requirements are unconstitutional.\", \"From Opinion: Why do more men die of Covid-19?\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"A devastating church-ordered report issued by an independent commission on sexual abuse inside the French Catholic Church found that the sacrament of confession itself, in rare instances, had been used to cover up abuse cases.\", \"The absolute secrecy of confession is central to the Roman Catholic faith. What is said in confession is between a penitent and God, with the priest a mediator. Any priest who breaks that seal can face excommunication under church laws that the Vatican places above all others. The issue has vexed attempts to address the sexual abuse cases that have roiled the church.\", \"Some victims in France wishing to report past abuses or expose active abusive priests were told to speak about it during confession, effectively suppressing their revelations and turning the sacrament into a \\u201cweapon of silence,\\u201d said La\\u00ebtitia Atlani-Duault, a member of the Independent Commission on Sexual Abuse in the Church.\", \"Response: After the release of the report, \\u00c9ric de Moulins-Beaufort, the archbishop of Reims, reaffirmed the Vatican\\u2019s position, declaring church law \\u201csuperior\\u201d to the laws of the country. The comment drew a sharp rebuke from the French government, resulting in an apology from the archbishop for his \\u201cclumsy\\u201d wording.\", \"The story of how sushi was popularized in the U.S. involves a round-faced messiah, a controversial religion and millions of kilograms of Japanese fish.\", \"Nothing says \\u201cNew York\\u201d like a shabby shop that sells lox and bagels. But as the city\\u2019s delicatessens were threatened with extinction, a new species of simulacra has been unleashed, Karrie Jacobs reports for The Times.\", \"New York was once a checkerboard of Jewish neighborhoods, each with at least one kosher deli faithfully upholding Orthodox dietary strictures. In the 1930s, there were upward of 1,500 of these delis; in recent decades, demographic changes and a focus on healthier eating saw their number dwindle to the 10s.\", \"The last of the authentic places \\u2014 including Katz\\u2019s Delicatessen and Russ & Daughters, above \\u2014 have been joined by modern homages, offering \\u201cgreatest hits\\u201d versions of deli food, Jewish and otherwise. The bagels are hand-rolled, but you can get them with bacon.\", \"What is the source of Jewish deli cuisine\\u2019s new allure? One historian points at the Amazon show \\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\\u201d whose engaging fantasy about Jewish New York may offer a substitute for the now-tarnished Woody Allen version. For others, the delis are an opportunity to celebrate the cranky, cerebral, irreverent Jewish culture that was once a dominant feature of the city\\u2019s character \\u2014 albeit through deft branding.\", \"Read more about revisionist delis.\", \"This is the ultimate sweet-and-salty squash recipe.\", \"From \\u201cHouse of Gucci\\u201d to franchise updates like \\u201cThe Matrix Resurrections,\\u201d here\\u2019s a guide to the upcoming movie season.\", \"A new biography of Angela Merkel and a pandemic-era novel are among the 13 new books we recommend this week.\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: Like the morning after an all-night party (five letters).\", \"And here is the Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.
