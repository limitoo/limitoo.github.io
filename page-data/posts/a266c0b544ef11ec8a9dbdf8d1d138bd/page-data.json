Such a world would be literally unlivable for billions of people around the world. It was a path towards planetary collapse.\", \"Through commitments made under the Paris Agreement, the world came to COP26 with 2030 commitments that would see the world warm by about 2.7C by the end of the century.\", \"Still catastrophic, but it was a pathway that bought us time to take stronger action.\", \"Through the COP26 process, 140 countries strengthened their 2030 targets, although Australia was not one of them.\", \"If nations come good on those commitments, then warming may only reach about 2.4C by the end of the century, according to leading analysts, Climate Analytics.\", \"Still not enough, but there are other reasons for optimism, and maybe even some relief.\", \"\\\"Glasgow has not closed the emissions gap in 2030, which is vital to keeping 1.5C alive, but it has set up an urgent process to address this gap, inviting countries to submit more ambitious national climate targets by the end of 2022,\\\" Bill Hare, senior scientist\\u00a0and chief executive at Climate Analytics, said.\", \"That \\\"urgent process\\\" is one of the most important outcomes of the meeting.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Acceleration of the Paris Agreement</div>\", \"Another piece of analysis during COP26 gave people around the world a rare shot of hope: Assuming nations' less concrete longer-term commitments, including Australia's net-zero by 2050 target and India's similar target for 2070, warming could peak at 1.9C and drop to about 1.8C at the end of the century, according to researchers at The University of Melbourne.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ef7a90a29705be66a0116c815ff194fd\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The developing world is in need of climate finance.(AP:\\u00a0Andrew Milligan/PA)</div>\", \"\\\"We would have to do more in 2030 to limit warming to 1.5C,\\\" said the University of Melbourne's Malte Meinshausen, who led the research.\", \"But finally there's a projection that sees warming stay under 2C.\", \"However, that assumes a lot of work will be done to implement those long-term targets, which for some countries so far seem barely consistent with their plans for 2030.\", \"That won't happen without a lot more work on increasing and then implementing 2030 targets.\", \"So\\u00a0that's where one crucial aspect of the Glasgow Climate Pact comes to life.\", \"The Glasgow Climate Pact, agreed to by every nation including Australia, requests countries strengthen their 2030 targets to align with the 1.5C goal next year.\", \"\\\"There is now clearly a consensus that this is not something that can be left.
