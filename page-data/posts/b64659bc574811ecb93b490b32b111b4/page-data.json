But when you\\u2019re expecting visitors, it\\u2019s time to clear out the clutter and add a few thoughtful touches.\", \"As Mr. Anderson said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s the details that really do make the difference.\\u201d\", \"For help creating a guest room that visitors will never want to leave (be careful: it\\u2019s a blessing and a curse), we asked interior designers for advice.\", \"There are two schools of thought when it comes to designing a guest room. Because it\\u2019s a room that typically doesn\\u2019t get a lot of use, some designers recommend going all out with color and pattern, to make a big statement \\u2014 similar to the way they treat powder rooms.\", \"\\u201cFor me, a guest bedroom is a place to have a little fun and maybe do something a bit unexpected,\\u201d said Heidi Caillier, a designer based in Seattle. \\u201cI find people are more open to a wallpaper or print, and making them interesting,\\u201d she added, \\u201cversus a primary bedroom, where they want it more relaxing.\\u201d\", \"In a bedroom in one Connecticut house she designed, Ms. Caillier covered the walls in Fruit wallpaper from Morris & Co., which has a lively pattern of leaves, flowers, pomegranates, peaches and citrus fruit.\", \"Other designers prefer to keep things simple. \\u201cI want it to have personality and style that ties into the aesthetic of the rest of the home, but not be so extreme or specific that some people love it and some people hate it,\\u201d said Mel Bean, a designer in Tulsa, Okla.\", \"Ms. Bean suggested choosing colors and patterns that are likely to be universally appealing. \\u201cIt should be a place everyone would want to sleep in,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThat can lead to neutrals or it can lead to lots of color, but in a way that\\u2019s not too busy or stimulating.\\u201d\", \"The choice is a personal one, and depends on the people you envision using the space \\u2014 your fashionable friends, say, or your conservative grandparents \\u2014 and what you want to communicate about your own sense of style.\", \"A guest room should not be a repository for lumpy old mattresses that would be better left at the curb. At the very least, it should provide the basics of a decent hotel room, said Roman Alonso, a principal of the Los Angeles-based design firm Commune. In other words: \\u201ca really comfortable mattress and high-end bedding,\\u201d as well as night stands, lamps for reading, and rugs if the room has hardwood, stone or ceramic floors.\", \"Although storage might not be top of mind, every overnight guest will have luggage, so you\\u2019ll need to accommodate that, too. \\u201cI\\u2019m one of those people who, when I check into a hotel or stay as a guest in someone\\u2019s house, have to unpack everything,\\u201d Mr. Anderson said.\", \"So in designing a guest room, he said, \\u201cI think about having somewhere to place luggage, be it on a rack or in a closet,\\u201d as well as providing a dresser, armoire or closet with hangers where people can properly store their things.\", \"Even with inexpensive furniture, it\\u2019s possible to give a room a luxurious feeling using textiles. Start by focusing on the bed.\", \"Fresh, clean sheets are essential. But on top of them, said Nicole Fisher, the founder of BNR Interiors in Hudson, N.Y., think about offering several different options for warmth: \\u201cSome people run hot, some people run cold, so you never know how they\\u2019re going to want to sleep.\\u201d\", \"When Ms. Fisher prepares a guest room, she said, \\u201cthere will always be a quilt, a duvet and a blanket,\\u201d so that people can adjust their layers.\", \"Pillow preference is another unknown, so it\\u2019s helpful to provide multiple sleeping pillows with various levels of firmness \\u2014 Ms. Caillier typically makes a bed with four \\u2014 as well as throw pillows that can serve as back support for sitting up in bed.\", \"Whether the bathroom is en suite or down the hall, Ms. Fisher said, it should be well stocked with fresh towels and washcloths. And if the bathroom is shared, guests should have designated towel bars, racks or hooks to keep their bath linens separate \\u2014 especially with heightened concerns about germs in the midst of the pandemic.\", \"Finally, make sure your guest room has appropriate window coverings. Rooms that get a lot of sunlight in the morning should have blackout shades or drapery, perhaps with a second layer of sheer curtains, so guests can control the light, Mr. Alonso said. In rooms that don\\u2019t get blasted by the sun, or by streetlights, an all-purpose light-filtering shade may suffice.\", \"Even the most sociable guests will eventually want a little time to themselves. To give them a place to go, try to include a seating area in the guest room, if there\\u2019s enough space.\", \"It could be as simple as placing a single lounge chair, small side table and floor lamp in the corner of the room. \\u201cOftentimes, I place those by a window, so you can just experience sitting in the sun,\\u201d Ms. Bean said. Other times, when space allows, she positions a small sofa at the foot of the bed.\", \"Also consider whether there\\u2019s room to squeeze in a desk. \\u201cWe\\u2019re definitely getting that request more now, since Covid,\\u201d Ms. Caillier said, as the pandemic has made remote work a possibility for many. \\u201cPeople want a work space, for their guests or for themselves, in that room.\\u201d\", \"It doesn\\u2019t have to be big. A compact free-standing desk or even a wall-mounted one with a chair that tucks out of the way is usually enough space for working on a laptop.\", \"Adding a few thoughtful touches can make a room feel extra special. Mr. Alonso and Ms. Bean like to have a coffee-and-tea station, as well as bottles of water, in guest rooms.\", \"\\u201cI like to have a bar cart in the closet with an espresso machine and glass bottles of water,\\u201d Ms. Bean said. \\u201cYou can even put a mini fridge in the closet, depending on the size.\\u201d\", \"If you don\\u2019t have room for small appliances, place a carafe with a cup-shaped lid on the night stand, so guests won\\u2019t have to walk to the kitchen for a middle-of-the-night drink of water.\", \"You should provide some reading material, as well, Ms. Bean said, including coffee-table books and magazines that reflect your interests: \\u201cThat\\u2019s a way to share a little bit of your personality.\\u201d\", \"For a decorative exclamation point, Ms. Fisher likes to add a vase of fresh flowers. For olfactory appeal, Mr. Anderson sometimes provides a scented candle and matches.\", \"You might also consider providing the new constants of the pandemic \\u2014 hand sanitizer and sanitizing wipes \\u2014 tucked into the drawer of a night stand or in a basket. \\u201cThese are not glamorous things,\\u201d Ms. Bean said, \\u201cbut it\\u2019s something that can add a mental layer of safety and security.\\u201d\", \"In the end, the goal is to make your guest\\u2019s visit feel \\u201csimilar to staying in a luxury hotel,\\u201d Ms. Bean said, \\u201cwhere you\\u2019re thinking about and anticipating their needs.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b64659bc574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b64659bc574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}},
