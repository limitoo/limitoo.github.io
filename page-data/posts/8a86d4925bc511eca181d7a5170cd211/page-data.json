In life, they can give us something to strive for; in drama, they\\u2019re a useful way to illustrate a character\\u2019s hopes and fears.\", \"In this episode, Issa has a series of dreams \\u2014 or possibly nightmares \\u2014 and they all come up Lawrence. \\u201cChoices, Okay!?\\u201d is more about the dreams that Issa has not chased down and brought to life than about the ones that she has managed to reach.\", \"This episode starts with Issa and Nathan splayed around Issa\\u2019s loved-in bedroom. Issa is thinking about squirrels until she remembers that her friend Tiffany might be moving away. She does a lot of daydreaming in this episode. After a quip or two, Nathan gets up and heads to the bathroom to take what appears to be medication, a welcome sign that he is staying dedicated to his health and well-being.\", \"The couple is clearly getting along \\u2014 it seems Nathan was able to show up for Issa in the way she wanted. She\\u2019s wearing his T-shirt around her house and he says he loves making her coffee, and then he asks Issa if they should move in together.\", \"\\u201cWow, do you think we\\u2019re ready for that?\\u201d she replies, looking somewhat stunned.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know, maybe,\\u201d he responds with a shrug. \\u201cIt will save us some money.\\u201d\", \"Then they put a pin in the conversation and move on.\", \"Initially, Issa\\u2019s professional life appears to be blossoming along with her romantic one. In a dreamlike sequence, she is offered what seems like a high number to partner with MBW. She puts on a show at the Miracle Theater in Los Angeles and expertly walks her sponsors through the process \\u2014 she is in charge, she knows her talking points and has her bases covered and then some. Then it appears we move forward in the timeline and she is on a panel being interviewed by Elaine Welteroth; it looks like our girl has professionally leveled up.\", \"Suddenly, she\\u2019s wearing a fly suit in first-class, sitting next to Ty Dollar $ign, who is on his way to Los Angeles to work with Crenshawn. Then Issa arrives at home. Nathan is at the house and the house is beautiful, that\\u2019s when I knew she was daydreaming. It might be when she figured it out, too \\u2014 she kind of snaps out of it and asks Nathan when they moved to that apartment.\", \"At this point, the episode dedicated some time to Kelli, who was helping Molly\\u2019s parents with their estate planning, so I want to do the same. What would \\u201cInsecure\\u201d be without her? She is always on time, unabashed, constantly pushing the girls to take better care of themselves. She will DM Daniel Kaluuya and then say he DM\\u2019d her first, because why not? She is like a human confetti popper of joy and hilarious rage. (This week she told Issa\\u2019s brother, Ahmal, that she was going to write a TV show about him just so she could kill him off.) When she is helping Molly\\u2019s parents, she eases the tension with her on-point witticism and jokes. We all need a Kelli.\", \"Issa\\u2019s second daydream of the episode was both more aspirational and more fraught. In this one, she partners up with Crenshawn, who apologizes for his behavior on social media, and opens up two locations with him. She is known and loved in the community and plays spades with the ice cream man on Sundays. (Glad to hear that she finally learned how.) Ty Dollar $ign partners up with MBW instead, and promotes water on bus ads.\", \"Issa, on the other hand, receives the key to Inglewood from Tyra Banks \\u2014 we all want to receive something from Tyra after watching her pass out headshots on \\u201cAmerica\\u2019s Next Top Model\\u201d for years, I get it \\u2014 and has a day named after her. At the end of this dream, she goes home and Nathan walks out to greet her. But then when he walks into a different room, Lawrence is who comes back out.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m proud of you,\\u201d he says to her. \\u201cYou had a lot of options but you made a choice that made you happy, and now you\\u2019re being rewarded for it.\\u201d\", \"He goes in for a kiss and Issa screams.\", \"Issa has it bad \\u2014 even when she\\u2019s daydreaming about what her life could become, Lawrence is still in play. Toward the end of the episode, she\\u2019s having dinner with Nathan at her place and he goes in the next room. When he says that he wants her to be happy, Issa hears Lawrence\\u2019s voice and braces herself for him to walk out of the room, but Nathan walks out instead. Did she look a little disappointed?\", \"In Issa\\u2019s real life, Nathan is her boyfriend and that\\u2019s who is in her house. Her dreams are turning into nightmares; is that what happens to dreams deferred? Will Issa try to turn her dream \\u2014 ending up with Lawrence, it seems \\u2014 into reality, no matter how misguided that move might be? Or will her actual reality be enough for her?\"]","href_hash":"8a86d4925bc511eca181d7a5170cd211"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8a86d4925bc511eca181d7a5170cd211"}},
