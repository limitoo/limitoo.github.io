Putin of Russia is increasingly staking his legacy on reversing Ukraine\\u2019s pro-Western shift. Even if he does not order an invasion this winter, he is making clear that he will keep the pressure on, backed by the threat of force, for as long as it takes to get his way.\", \"But Ukraine\\u2019s leaders have so far refused to compromise on Mr. Putin\\u2019s terms, and the West sees the Kremlin\\u2019s demand for a Russian sphere of influence in Eastern Europe as a nonstarter. That leaves the best-case scenario as a long and dangerous diplomatic slog toward a difficult settlement \\u2014 a process that could consume Western resources and attention for many months.\", \"President Emmanuel Macron of France, shuttling from Moscow to Kyiv to Berlin on Monday and Tuesday, described the coming days as crucial in the West\\u2019s bid to avert war. Mr. Putin countered with a pledge to keep the \\u201cdialogue\\u201d going. It was a message that implied he would be deliberate in using his levers of influence and coercion to deal with the longstanding Russian grievances that the Kremlin appears newly determined to address.\", \"\\u201cI expect we\\u2019ll have this crisis with us, in various forms, for all of 2022, at least,\\u201d said Andrei Sushentsov, dean of the school of international relations at MGIMO, the elite Moscow university run by the Russian Foreign Ministry.\", \"He described the current standoff as only the first step in a drawn-out Russian effort to force the West to agree to a new security architecture for Eastern Europe. It was a characterization of the start of a more high-stakes phase in Russia\\u2019s yearslong conflict with the West that is gaining currency in Moscow\\u2019s foreign-policy circles.\", \"Russia\\u2019s aim, according to Mr. Sushentsov: keep the threat of war ever-present, and thus compel negotiations that Western officials have avoided until now.\", \"For too long, he said in an interview, people in Western Europe have been lulled into thinking that a new war on the continent was impossible. For Mr. Putin, that point of view needs to be changed, Mr. Sushentsov said, to compel the West to accept Russia\\u2019s demands.\", \"\\u201cWhat\\u2019s important is this suspense, this feeling of a prewar situation,\\u201d Mr. Sushentsov said. \\u201cPeople are spoiled by an overly long peace. They think of security as a given, as something that is attained for free, rather than something that must be negotiated. This is a mistake.\\u201d\", \"For the West, that approach could mean being drawn in to a new sort of \\u201cforever war\\u201d \\u2014 a conflict consuming ever more time and treasure, with no clear exit strategy. President Biden on Monday characterized a Russian invasion of Ukraine as \\u201ctanks or troops crossing the border.\\u201d But American officials say that there remain numerous lower-grade options that Mr. Putin is considering that could touch off a less deadly but still costly conflict.\", \"Even if Mr. Macron, working with Mr. Biden and other Western leaders, were to help secure a temporary relaxation of tensions, Mr. Putin\\u2019s demands are so expansive \\u2014 and his disdain of Ukraine\\u2019s pro-Western leaders so great \\u2014 that analysts struggle to imagine a grand bargain being struck.\", \"Ruslan Pukhov, a Russian military analyst, said that even if the West and Ukraine were to make sufficient concessions in the coming weeks to avert an armed conflict, they would be unlikely to satisfy Russia in the longer term, adding that a renewed threat of war could come next year.\", \"\\u201cThe West just doesn\\u2019t understand how much this is a question of life or death for us,\\u201d said Mr. Pukhov, who runs the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a privately owned think tank in Moscow. \\u201cUkraine in NATO, from my point of view or Russia\\u2019s, would be the equivalent of nuclear war.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Putin made the threat of war over Ukraine between nuclear superpowers explicit twice in recent days: in news conferences after his meetings with Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary last week and with Mr. Macron on Monday. Both times, Mr. Putin described a scenario in which Ukraine would join NATO and then try to recapture Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula that Russia annexed in 2014, with the Western alliance\\u2019s backing.\", \"Dmitri Kiselyov, one of Russian state television\\u2019s leading anchors, on Sunday detailed what would happen next: a nuclear war in which Russia, faced with its own destruction, would take the West with it.\", \"\\u201cLet\\u2019s remember that Russia doesn\\u2019t need a world without Russia,\\u201d Mr. Kiselyov intoned at the beginning of his weekly prime-time show, paraphrasing a 2018 line by Mr. Putin. \\u201cAnd then not just America, but also Europe, will turn into radioactive ash.\\u201d\", \"Western officials describe NATO membership for Ukraine as unrealistic anytime in the near future, but the Kremlin insists that even the possibility poses an existential threat. On the ground, analysts see preparations gaining pace for a possible military solution to preventing Ukraine from ever joining NATO.\", \"Researchers monitoring satellite imagery and footage of troop movements posted to social media say that Russia is deploying personnel and equipment to within miles of the border with Ukraine. The forces have been filmed setting up tents in the mud and snow, adding to fears that Mr. Putin could order an attack as early as this month.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s safe to say that this is not a force posture that Russia is going to maintain for an extended period of time,\\u201d said Michael Kofman, the director of Russia studies at CNA, a research institute based in Arlington, Va. \\u201cThey are entering a go/no-go posture, and they\\u2019re going to make that decision in the coming weeks.\\u201d\", \"But even if an attack were to happen, touching off what would most likely be enormous human suffering in Ukraine, the diplomatic scramble would continue \\u2014 with Russia exercising even more leverage, Mr. Kofman argues.\", \"\\u201cDiplomacy continues throughout war,\\u201d he said. \\u201cUltimately, there would need to be some sort of agreement.\\u201d\", \"Despite the worrying troop movements, many analysts inside Russia continue to doubt that Mr. Putin will actually order a full invasion. The risks would far exceed any of Mr. Putin\\u2019s prior military pushes, like the five-day war against Georgia in 2008 or the still-simmering proxy war in eastern Ukraine that he started in 2014. Russian missiles could miss their targets, causing civilian casualties; Ukraine could respond by attacking Russian targets across the border.\", \"\\u201cI think most military officials understand that any operation would be rife with great difficulties,\\u201d Mr. Pukhov, the Russian military analyst, said. \\u201cOne has to understand that even in the event of limited military action, you won\\u2019t be able to avoid a major escalation and it won\\u2019t conclude in five days.\\u201d\", \"The Kremlin said on Tuesday that Russia would withdraw the thousands of troops it had sent to Belarus, Ukraine\\u2019s northern neighbor, after large-scale joint exercises concluded there on Feb. 20. Whether the Russian troops indeed leave will be one closely watched signal of Mr. Putin\\u2019s military intentions. Even if they do, Russia\\u2019s newfound appetite for attention-grabbing military pressure against Ukraine and the West is likely to remain.\", \"\\u201cRussia has departed from the tactic of simply asking to be listened to,\\u201d Mr. Sushentsov, the university dean, said. \\u201cRussian leaders have seen that this does not work and that it is necessary to make clear the risks of the Russian position being ignored.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c4a6351688e611ec819171794d5be311"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c4a6351688e611ec819171794d5be311"}},
