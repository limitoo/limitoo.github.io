But he recovered and made music for another three decades.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-02T23:02:00.000Z","content":"[\"Pat Martino, whose trailblazing career as a jazz guitarist seemed to end prematurely in 1980 when brain surgery left him with no memory, but who then painstakingly relearned the instrument, and his own past, and went on to three more decades of innovative musicianship, died on Monday at his home in South Philadelphia. He was 77.\", \"Joseph Donofrio, his longtime manager, said the cause was chronic respiratory disorder, which had forced Mr. Martino to stop performing after a tour of Italy in November 2018.\", \"Mr. Martino\\u2019s playing began drawing attention when he was still a teenager. Having been expelled from a Roman Catholic high school in 10th grade (\\u201cSomething took place between me and one of the priests there,\\u201d he wrote years later. \\u201cIf I remember correctly, it had something to do with bubble gum.\\u201d), he became a professional musician, joining the singer Lloyd Price\\u2019s big band and then, in 1962, the saxophonist Willis Jackson\\u2019s combo.\", \"In 1967, when he was in his early 20s, he released his first album, \\u201cEl Hombre,\\u201d on the Prestige label, and a series of well-regarded records followed. At the start of his career he often drew comparisons to earlier jazz guitarists like Wes Montgomery, but by the 1970s he was forging his own sound. \\u201cPat Martino: Breaking Barriers Between Rock & Jazz,\\u201d a 1975 headline in The San Francisco Examiner read.\", \"On a tour supporting his first albums for Warner Bros., \\u201cStarbright\\u201d (1976) and \\u201cJoyous Lake\\u201d (1977), Mr. Martino began experiencing frequent headaches and seizures, something he had dealt with occasionally since childhood. One seizure came while he was onstage in France in 1976.\", \"\\u201cI stopped playing and stood there for about 30 seconds,\\u201d he wrote in his autobiography, \\u201cHere and Now!\\u201d (2011, with Bill Milkowski). \\u201cDuring these moments of seizure, it feels like you\\u2019re falling through a black hole; it\\u2019s like everything just escapes at the moment.\\u201d\", \"In the book, he described going through a series of misdiagnoses and ill-advised treatment, including electroshock. He retired from performing and turned to teaching at the Guitar Institute of Technology in Hollywood, but his problems worsened; at one point, he wrote, a doctor told him he had two hours to live.\", \"A condition called arteriovenous malformation, a tangling of arteries and veins, was diagnosed. An aneurysm resulted in emergency surgery to remove a large tumor; when he awoke, he had no memory.\", \"\\u201cWhen you don\\u2019t remember something, you have no idea of its existence,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cAnd upon awakening after the surgery, I remembered nothing.\", \"\\u201cBut it wasn\\u2019t a disorienting feeling,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cIf I had known I was a guitarist, if I had known those two people standing by my bedside in the hospital were in fact my parents, I then would\\u2019ve felt the feelings that went along with the events. What they went through and why they were standing there looking at me then would\\u2019ve been very painful for me. But it wasn\\u2019t painful because to me they were just strangers.\\u201d\", \"His parents helped him relearn his past, showing him family photographs and playing him his own albums. Picking up the guitar again was another form of memory recovery.\", \"\\u201cI had to start from Square 1,\\u201d he told The Edmonton Journal of Alberta, Canada, in 2004. \\u201cBut once I made the decision to try, it activated inner intuitive familiarities, like a child who hasn\\u2019t ridden their bicycle for many years and tries to do so again to reach a destination. There are moments of imbalance, but it\\u2019s subliminal, and it emerges after some mistakes, and then it strengthens.\\u201d\", \"By the mid-1980s he was performing again. Jon Pareles, reviewing one performance, at Fat Tuesday\\u2019s in Manhattan in 1986, found Mr. Martino as virtuosic and unpredictable as ever.\", \"\\u201cHe can play chorus after chorus of bebop lines, zigzagging through the chromatic harmonies of his own tunes,\\u201d Mr. Pareles wrote. \\u201cBut more often than not, he turns bebop conventions sideways. He starts a line on an unexpected beat, breaks his runs up to insist on a single note or riff, inserts odd-length leaps into standard licks and shifts accents around the beat. His playing is articulately wayward, approaching tunes from odd angles and taking rewarding tangents; he makes song forms seem slippery and mysterious.\\u201d\", \"In 1987, Mr. Martino released a new album. It was called \\u201cThe Return.\\u201d\", \"Patrick Azzara (he took Martino, which his father had also used, as a stage name) was born on Aug. 25, 1944, in Philadelphia to Carmen and Jean (Orlando) Azzara. His father, known as Mickey, was a tailor who also worked as a guitarist and singer. He would hide his guitar from young Pat, though in the autobiography Mr. Martino suggests that this \\u201cwas a bit of reverse psychology on his part\\u201d \\u2014 once the boy took up the instrument, his father encouraged his career and introduced him to various musicians.\", \"Mr. Martino was in bands as a boy, including one with the future pop star Bobby Rydell, who lived nearby. One of the guitar greats Mr. Martino\\u2019s father took him to meet, backstage after a concert in Atlantic City, was Les Paul, who asked young Pat to play a little something.\", \"\\u201cWhat came out of that guitar was unbelievable,\\u201d Mr. Paul wrote in the liner notes to Mr. Martino\\u2019s 1970 album, \\u201cDesperado.\\u201d \\u201cHis dexterity and his picking style were absolutely unique. He held his pick as one would hold a demitasse \\u2026 pinkie extended, very polite. The politeness disappeared when pick met string.\\u201d\", \"As Mr. Martino grew more experienced, his view of jazz evolved, largely shaped by Eastern philosophies; he did not, he told The Examiner in 1975, consider himself a jazz musician.\", \"\\u201cJazz is a way of life,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not an idiom of music. Jazz is spontaneous improvisation. If you ever leave your house with nowhere to go, and just walk for pleasure, observing and looking around, you\\u2019ll find that you improvise.\\u201d\", \"And he did not consider himself a \\u201cguitar player,\\u201d he said, though he once did.\", \"\\u201cI no longer view myself that way because I don\\u2019t want to be depersonalized by my instrument,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI\\u2019m an observer of my environment, including the guitar; I see the guitar in everything.\\u201d\", \"In his autobiography, he described the process of recovering the ability to play.\", \"\\u201cAs I continued to work out things on the instrument,\\u201d he wrote, \\u201cflashes of memory and muscle memory would gradually come flooding back to me \\u2014 shapes on the fingerboard, different stairways to different rooms in the house. There are secret doorways that only you know about in the house, and you go there because it\\u2019s pleasurable to do so.\\u201d\", \"The records he made after his surgery included \\u201cAll Sides Now\\u201d (1997), on the Blue Note label, an album on which he shared tracks with other famed guitarists, including Mr. Paul. Two of his albums, also on Blue Note, were nominated for Grammy Awards, \\u201cLive at Yoshi\\u2019s\\u201d (2001) and \\u201cThink Tank\\u201d (2003).\", \"His surgery and the recovery period, Mr. Martino said, changed what he was after in his music.\", \"\\u201cIt used to be to do everything I possibly could to become more successful in my craft and my career,\\u201d he told the Edmonton paper. \\u201cToday, my intention is to completely enjoy the moment and everything it contains.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Martino is survived by his wife of 26 years, Ayako Asahi.\", \"Mr. Martino had other health issues over the years, but Mr. Donofrio, his longtime manager, said his resilience was remarkable.\", \"\\u201cEvery time I thought he was going to be down and out,\\u201d he said, \\u201che came back stronger than before.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"d3f1a0e43c3011ec8312000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d3f1a0e43c3011ec8312000017025a03"}},
