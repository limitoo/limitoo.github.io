Six were undertaken as part of the TBfree programme to target possums, which can pass on bovine tuberculosis to farmed cattle and deer.\", \"More details on the confirmed incidents in which non-target species were harmed were published in the report.\", \"Six kea were killed during one operation and three during another. The report said DOC had further activities planned to reduce risk to kea in the future - including encouraging people not to feed kea, which can promote scrounging behaviour and put them at risk when 1080 bait is dropped in their habitats.\", \"In the other confirmed case, a dog died after it escaped into a treatment area after an operation. It was found that the operator had taken all appropriate measures to reduce the risk.\", \"Intelligence and reporting manager Brian Ruiterman said the poison was still the most viable pest management tool.\", \"\\\"It is essential to ensure that risks to non-target species are managed and mitigated effectively and steps should continue to be taken to avoid any incidents of non-target impacts\\\", he said\", \"Ruiterman said there were advances in planning and technology that should better enable 1080 risk management.\"]","href_hash":"e74d78315aed11ec84d0e5fe28c671fc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e74d78315aed11ec84d0e5fe28c671fc"}},
