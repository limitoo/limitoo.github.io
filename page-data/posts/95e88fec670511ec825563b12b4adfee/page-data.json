Following the end of apartheid in 1994, when South Africa became a democracy, Tutu chaired the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that documented atrocities and sought to promote national reconciliation. Tutu also became one of the world's most prominent religious leaders to champion LGBTQ rights.\", \"\\u00a0Several events in South Africa are planned to honor Tutu's life.\", \" Tutu's body will lie in state at the cathedral in Cape Town on Friday before a requiem mass is held Saturday, Makgoba said. In addition, an ecumenical service will be held for Tutu on Wednesday in South Africa's capital, Pretoria.\", \" South Africans are laying flowers at the cathedral, in front of Tutu's home in Cape Town's Milnerton area, and in front of his former home in Soweto.\", \" \\\"He knew in his soul that good would triumph over evil, that justice would prevail over iniquity, and that reconciliation would prevail over revenge and recrimination. He knew that apartheid would end, that democracy would come,\\\" South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said of Tutu, in a nationally broadcast address Sunday night.\", \"\\\"He knew that our people would be free. By the same measure, he was convinced, even to the end of his life, that poverty, hunger and misery can be defeated; that all people can live together in peace, security and comfort,\\\" said Ramaphosa, who added that South Africa's flags will be flown at half-staff this week.\", \" Ramaphosa urged all South Africans to \\\"pay respects to the departed and to celebrate life with the exuberance and the purpose of our beloved Archbishop. May we follow in his footsteps. May we too be worthy inheritors of the mantle of service, of selflessness, of courage, and of principled solidarity with the poor and marginalized.\\\"\", \"Tributes poured in from around the world. \", \"Among them was a statement from President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden, who said they're heartbroken but \\\"were blessed to spend time with him on several occasions over the past many years. His courage and moral clarity helped inspire our commitment to change American policy toward the repressive Apartheid regime in South Africa.\\\"\", \"Former President Barack Obama tweeted\\u00a0that Tutu never lost his \\\"willingness to find humanity in his adversaries\\\" and that he will be missed.\", \"Archbishop Desmond Tutu was a mentor, a friend, and a moral compass for me and so many others. A universal spirit, Archbishop Tutu was grounded in the struggle for liberation and justice in his own country, but also concerned with injustice everywhere. pic.twitter.com/qiiwtw8a5B\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"95e88fec670511ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"95e88fec670511ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
