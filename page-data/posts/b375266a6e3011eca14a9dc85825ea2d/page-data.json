The trade show kicks off on Wednesday, with an estimated 2,200 exhibitors set to show up in person.\", \"But with the highly contagious Omicron variant of the coronavirus surging, scores of major tech companies are still presenting mostly virtually.\", \"It\\u2019s a sign that decisions to hold big in-person events at this phase of the pandemic remain far from clear-cut, the DealBook newsletter reports. Yet the organizers of CES \\u2014 like those of the Winter Olympics and the Australian Open, which are set to begin soon \\u2014 have decided it\\u2019s time to gather in person again.\", \"Canceling the show would \\u201churt thousands of smaller companies, entrepreneurs and innovators\\u201d who depend on the show to introduce their products, Gary Shapiro, the chief executive of the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that organizes CES, wrote in an opinion column in The Las Vegas Review-Journal. (The conference is also important for Las Vegas, which reaped an estimated $291 million from spending tied to it in 2020.) Mr. Shapiro noted that the conference had embraced pandemic protections like requiring attendees to be fully vaccinated and masked while on the show floor, and that testing was readily available.\", \"But many large companies have chosen to attend remotely, including Amazon, AMD, AT&T, General Motors, Google, Intel, Lenovo, Meta, Nvidia, Pinterest, T-Mobile and Twitter. That will leave \\u201cbig gaps on the show floor,\\u201d Mr. Shapiro said. And CES will end a day early, in what the organizers said was a concession to safety.\", \"Other big events are delaying their return to in-person gatherings. Organizers of the Grammys are reportedly considering delaying this month\\u2019s music awards show, while the World Economic Forum postponed its annual confab in Davos, Switzerland, which was set to take place this month.\", \"So is it safe to hold live in-person events again? Omicron cases appear to be less severe than cases from previous variants, and vaccines and new treatments are becoming available. More governments are also edging toward managing, not containing, the coronavirus, and are increasingly reluctant to reimpose restrictions. That could mean that a return to regular mass gatherings in some places may not be far-off.\"]","href_hash":"b375266a6e3011eca14a9dc85825ea2d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b375266a6e3011eca14a9dc85825ea2d"}},
