His data shows the likelihood of the combined infection is higher among patients who have been hospitalised with the virus than those who aren't.\", \"The sequences of the 25 Deltacron cases have been sent to GISAID, the international database that tracks and gives access to genomic data of COVID-19.\", \"\\\"We will see in the future if this strain is more pathological or more contagious or if it will prevail,\\\" Kostrikis says.\", \"But he adds that his personal view is that this strain will be displaced by the highly contagious Omicron variant.\", \"Omicron has become the dominant variant in some countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and France.\", \"The variant is more infectious but appears to be less severe than Delta, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Thursday.
