cluster.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"The new cases are in a\\u00a0man in his 40s from Katherine, a woman in her 20s from Robinson River and a boy\\u00a0under 10 years old from Robinson River.\", \"It brings the total number of cases linked to the\\u00a0local cluster to 56.\", \"Chief Minister Michael Gunner said all three people are\\u00a0household contacts and had\\u00a0been in the Howard Springs quarantine facility for the whole of their infectious periods.\\u00a0\", \"A fourth case recorded in the NT overnight was in a flight crew member who arrived from London on a repatriation flight.\", \"Mr Gunner said because the three local cases had tested positive late in their 14-day quarantine periods, there was a chance they had caught the virus while in Howard Springs\\u00a0as a result of \\\"family mingling\\\".\", \"He said the rules around mingling in Howard Springs had since been tightened.\", \"Some people staying in the facility will have their quarantine periods lengthened as a result.\", \"Yesterday,\\u00a0the Greater Katherine area, including Rockhole,\\u00a0moved from a lockdown to a lockout, which is due to end on December 7.\", \"The community of Binjari remains in a hard lockdown pending the results of more testing.\", \"So far 537 close contacts have been identified as part of the Katherine cluster.\", \"All except one have been contacted and isolated.\", \"Mr Gunner noted\\u00a0it\\u00a0had now been 30 days since the cluster's source case, in an interstate traveller who allegedly lied on her border entry form, arrived in the NT.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Lajamanu community in lockdown</div>\", \"The remote community of Lajamanu, about 560 kilometres south-west of Katherine, was sent into lockdown last night after wastewater samples tested positive for COVID.\", \"Mr Gunner said a rapid assessment team had arrived\\u00a0in Lajamanu late last night\\u00a0to test, vaccinate and otherwise support the community, and Katherine West Health Board staff were\\u00a0also assisting.\\u00a0\", \"He said authorities\\u00a0were aiming to test\\u00a0everyone in Lajamanu over the next 48 hours.\", \"\\\"When you get a positive wastewater sample like this, it's similar to the Katherine East experience at [the] Bicentennial [Road] catchment and there's a case in the community,\\\" he said.\", \"No\\u00a0Lajamanu residents have reported symptoms so far.\\u00a0\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d527794b3c95fbd7d92500608c08f897\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> COVID viral fragments have been detected in Lajamanu wastewater samples.(ABC News: Stephanie Zillman)</div>\", \"Mr Gunner also said getting more residents vaccinated would be a focus.\", \"Lajamanu currently has a first dose vaccination rate of about 60 per cent and a second dose rate of just 35 per cent, according to NT government figures.\", \"Mr Gunner said more resources were also\\u00a0being sent to the nearby remote communities of Yuendumu and Kalkarindji to boost vaccination rates, and that daily wastewater testing was\\u00a0being done in a number of surrounding communities.\", \"NT Police Commissioner Jamie Chalker urged anyone who had left Lajamanu in the past week to get tested for COVID immediately.\", \"And he asked Territorians living in remote communities to \\\"stay where you are\\\" to help contain the virus's spread.\", \"\\\"If you don't need to travel, simply stay where you are,\\\" he said.\", \"<img

traveller</div>\", \"Acting Chief Health Officer Charles Pain said authorities were still waiting on the test results of a COVID-positive\\u00a0repatriation flight traveller from South Africa who arrived in the NT on Thursday, to see if the man was carrying the new Omicron variant of concern.\", \"\\\"We are doing the genomic testing at the moment so we might have a result tomorrow if we're lucky, or maybe the day after,\\\" he said.\", \"Dr Pain said the testing was taking a bit longer than usual because the man had returned a \\\"slightly low positive result\\\".\", \"\\\"We are doing some extra testing, so gathering more virus from the individual so we don't\\u2026 have that confirmation yet,\\\" he said.\", \"Dr Pain said it was still too early to tell if the new Omicron variant was \\\"actually a more lethal virus\\\".\", \"\\\"We don't know whether it's actually going to be cause more serious illness, and we don't know the other key things as to whether or not the vaccine would have a lesser effect, or treatments,\\\" he said.\", \"He said alarm bells were initially raised about the new variant because its discovery had coincided with a surge in cases in South Africa, and it displayed about 30 mutations in the spike protein, which is the part of the virus that latches onto human cells and infects people.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Family mingling, man's escape raises security questions</div>\", \"Authorities said there had been a change to procedures at Howard Springs to reduce the risk of COVID transmission\\u00a0through family mingling.\", \"They said some mingling had only happened within family groups, rather than\\u00a0between different family groups or domestic and international travellers, and generally compliance at the facility was good.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"These are quite different circumstances\\u00a0to those that we've experienced\\u00a0before,\\\" Dr\\u00a0Pain said.\", \"\\\"Cohorting families together \\u2013 we've tried to do that, but, as you can imagine, we're trying to keep people separate to prevent that transmission, while at the same time keeping conditions\\u00a0habitable and civilised for people.\", \"\\\"We will adjust our systems so that we prevent any further transmission.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/22e214301ad2eafbb9f7fd053ae6bd3e\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\",

four hours later.\", \"Yesterday, Health Minister Natasha Fyles said the government would conduct a review of the facility to determine what had happened.\\u00a0\", \"Asked what was being done at Howard Springs to prevent bad behaviour, Commissioner Chalker said he wanted to be clear that \\\"we're not operating a prison\\\", and people staying at the faculty needed to heed the health risks\\u00a0and work with authorities.\", \"But he admitted there was some room for improvement.\", \"\\\"We have learnt from\\u00a0that,\\\" he said of the escape.\", \"\\\"We've been working with
