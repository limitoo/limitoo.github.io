Meanwhile, the woman's lawyer said she was locked in a room and separated from her children for months.\", \"Brandon Lee Toseland's public defender, Scott Coffee, told reporters following Toseland's brief court appearance on a murder charge that although his client intends to plead not guilty, the allegations in the case invited a competency review.\", \"BACKGROUND OF ABUSE: The Las Vegas man accused of killing a child and concealing his body in a freezer for several months previously faced domestic violence charges and was ordered to attend counseling, records obtained by the 8 News Now I-Team say https://t.co/b6fFNjSQlX #8NN\", \"\\\"That's the first thing we will look into, to see if he's able to go forward\\\" with court proceedings, Coffee said. He added that he had not yet reviewed evidence collected by police.\", \"Toseland, 35, stood silently, staring down at his handcuffed hands, as a Las Vegas judge ordered him to remain jailed pending another court hearing Monday. Toseland previously faced domestic violence charges and was ordered to attend counseling, according to records obtained by CBS affiliate KLAS-TV.\", \"Prosecutor Richard Scow told the judge that the kidnapping and murder case against Toseland will be consolidated at that time.\", \"Police arrested Toseland on Tuesday, after the girl delivered a handful of sticky notes to her elementary school teacher that said the mother was being held captive at Toseland's house and thought the girl's brother was dead, authorities said Wednesday.\", \"A lawyer speaking for the woman and her family said in a statement that she endured months of physical, sexual and emotional abuse by Toseland, who told her he would kill her children if she left him.\", \"The attorney, Stephen Stubbs, said the woman does not want her name made public.\", \"Stubbs said the mother, in her 20s, knew Toseland as an acquaintance of her husband, the father of her children, who died in January 2021 of a respiratory illness at age 29. Stubbs said the girl is 7.\", \"After the three moved into Toseland's house in March 2021, Stubbs said Toseland covered windows, used video surveillance, took the mother's cellphone, cut her ties to her family and handled her social media. It was not immediately clear if Toseland was employed.\", \"\\\"For the majority of the time, the mother was handcuffed, bound and/or locked up,\\\" Stubbs said.\", \"Police said they found handcuffs in the car in which Toseland was stopped and arrested after the daughter delivered the notes to school.
