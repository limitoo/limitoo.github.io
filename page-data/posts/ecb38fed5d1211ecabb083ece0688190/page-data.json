border policies soften slightly.\", \"After more than 18 months, rules strictly limiting the arrival of both students and skilled migrants have been relaxed.\", \"All will still have to self-isolate for 72 hours upon arrival \\u2014\\u00a0just like Australian citizens, permanent residents and their immediate family members \\u2014\\u00a0and they will only be allowed into states and territories that are already taking international arrivals.\", \"However, while universities are keen to warmly welcome their first major intake of international students in two years, some students are warning this nation's tough border policies have left lukewarm attitudes to Australian study abroad.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Students felt 'more respected'\\u00a0elsewhere</div>\", \"Among those arriving on Wednesday will be Deepesh Batra, due to arrive in Melbourne this evening from Delhi before taking up study at the University of Wollongong in February.\", \"Mr Batra said that, after so much time wondering when Australia would open its doors, he was excited to be on campus \\u2014 and to see Australian-based family too.\", \"\\\"It's kind of magical, to be honest, and I just can't wait to be there,\\\" he said.\", \"But Mr Batra warned that,\\u00a0after a frustrating year and a half for international students stuck abroad, many have simply given up on studying in Australia.\", \"He said Australia could have done far better communicating its plans and intentions to the tens of thousands of students around the globe, wondering when they could finally pack their bags.\", \"\\\"Throughout these months, all we were asking for was clear communication between the government and students,\\\" he said, \\\"not just fear-mongering, so we would have had some clarity.\\\"\", \"He said he had\\u00a0two friends who had planned to study in Australia but wound up travelling to Canada instead, saying they felt \\\"more respected\\\"\\u00a0there.\", \"\\\"If they have chosen Canada or Australia, the purpose still remains the same, which is to gather knowledge and a high-quality education,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"If there is no clear messaging [from Australia], that creates a dilemma.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Some fear borders will close again, either locking them in or out</div>\", \"Gargi Bakshi will also land in Australia on Wednesday night before heading to Deakin University, where she will study biomedical science.\", \"It is Ms Bakshi's\\u00a0first trip outside India and it has taken two years of planning.\", \"Ms Bakshi finished school in 2019 and was accepted into university, but deferred for two years until she knew she could travel to Australia.\", \"Now she is on her way, she said she is incredibly keen to arrive.\", \"\\\"It's very exciting, very nervous\\u00a0and scared,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"I'm going to be missing Mum's cooking a lot.\", \"Ms Bakshi said her farewells with parents and grandparents were tough, as she felt she could not confidently tell them when she would be back.\", \"She said many students were nervous travelling to Australia, concerned borders may close again and they will not be able to easily return home.\", \"\\\"Once you do land, you still want to go back to your family at least once a year,\\\" Ms Bakshi\\u00a0said.\", \"\\\"And, if the borders get shut down and you go back, you can't return.\", \"\\\"So I would definitely say that there is a lot of hesitancy.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Universities hope students flood back</div>\", \"Australia's university sector estimates it lost $1.8 billion last year, partly due to a significant shortfall of international students.\", \"Catriona Jackson from Universities Australia said it would\\u00a0take years for numbers to recover.\", \"\\\"It's hard to recover the way you might in other sectors, because the student you don't have in first year, you don't have in second year, third year or fourth year,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"So there'll be a nasty tail.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/db8975d6a26e48b12f2472d957489c2f\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Catriona

borders were in place.\", \"\\\"What we'd say to them is, 'We've taken a particular approach and a very successful approach to controlling the virus in Australia',\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"And they will
