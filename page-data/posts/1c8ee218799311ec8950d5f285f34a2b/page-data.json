I understand humanitarian flights are coming in,\\\" Setoya told RNZ by satellite phone.\", \"A New Zealand Defence Force C-130 Hercules is on standby and will be able to to take off once the all clear has been given, bringing supplies of water, hygiene kits and other goods. Two Australian Air Force Hercules are also ready to depart.\", \"One of Tonga's main communications providers, Digicel, said it had restored international calls to Tonga via satellite.\", \"But until the undersea communications cable is restored its network services will not be fully operational, it said.\", \"It is expected to take at least a month to complete repairs on the cable that carries the bulk of internet and phone communications to Tonga.\", \"Digicel Tonga is giving out free sim cards from Thursday morning, with the company saying it knows how desperate family and friends overseas are to connect with relatives.\", \"Three people are confirmed to have died after Saturday's massive volcanic eruption and tsunami.
