It wakes me up in the early mornings: Nocturnal terror breaks through the surface of sleep like a whale breaching for air. My ambition and fear kick in together until I get up, pour myself some water and look out the window at the squid-ink sky and the string of lights along my neighbors\\u2019 houses. I lie down again after finding firmer mental ground, dry land.\", \"So when a guy that my friend was seeing evangelized about \\u201ctime slips\\u201d \\u2014 a genre of urban legend in which people claim that, while walking in particular places, they accidentally traveled back, and sometimes forward, in time \\u2014 I was a ripe target. Curious and increasingly existential, I Googled these supposed time slips. I found a global community of believers building an archive of temporal dislocations from the present. These congregants gathered in corners of the internet to testify about how, in the right conditions, the dusting of alienation that settles over the world as we age can crystallize into collective fiction.\", \"I was initially skeptical of the vague language that time-slip writers employed to convey experiences I already found dubious: too many uses of foggy words like \\u201cblunder\\u201d and \\u201csporting\\u201d; detail lavished on varieties of hats encountered. But I was drawn in by their secretive tone \\u2014 I sensed that sharing these anecdotes was compromising, even shameful (\\u201cPeople would laugh at you,\\u201d one poster wrote). Disapproval became attraction, and I returned to the message boards throughout the summer.\", \"Here\\u2019s a classic that, like the best of these stories, was related secondhand on a paranormal blog: In a Liverpudlian street in 1996, an off-duty policeman named Frank was going to meet his wife, Carol, in a bookshop called Dillons when \\u201csuddenly, a small box van that looked like something out of the 1950s sped across his path, honking its horn as it narrowly missed him.\\u201d More disorienting still, Frank \\u201csaw that Dillons book store now had \\u2018Cripps\\u2019 over its entrance\\u201d and that there were stands of shoes and handbags in the window instead of new fiction. The only other person not wearing midcentury dress was a girl in a lime green sleeveless top. As Frank followed her into the old women\\u2019s wear boutique, \\u201cthe interior of the building completely changed in a flash\\u201d; it was once again a bookshop.\", \"As with a spell of d\\u00e9j\\u00e0 vu, the experience was short-lived, and time was regained. According to the blogger\\u2019s detective-like report, Cripps \\u201cwas later determined\\u201d to have been a business in the 1950s. In response to Frank\\u2019s slip, posters have told their own or related accounts they\\u2019ve heard from others: \\u201cThis happened to my ex-boss, Glyn Jackson in London, England,\\u201d one begins. \\u201cGlyn\\u2019s story is Highly believable as Glyn is person who lacks imagination on such a scale that he could not put together a grade one story for English to save his life.\\u201d And on it goes.\", \"I have never appreciated stories about the passage of time. I resent that I won\\u2019t ever get back the hours of my life that Richard Linklater stole with \\u201cBoyhood\\u201d \\u2014 his two-and-three-quarter-hour film, shot over a 12-year period in which time is the force that overwhelms everything, not least the idea that our own actions drive our life stories. There\\u2019s a whole lot of unwelcome profundity there.\", \"Time-slip anecdotes, though fashioned out of the ambient dread of living with the ticking clock, are childlike in their sense of wonder. They are light, playful and irrational, as frivolous and folky as a ghost story if it were narrated by the confused ghost instead of the people it haunts. One poster, as a girl, used to see a woman in a blue bathrobe in her room: \\u201cHer hair was long and messy, a reddish brown. I didn\\u2019t see her face because she was usually turned away. I used to mistake her for my mom.\\u201d Years later, grown up, the poster\\u2019s daughter slept in her former bedroom. \\u201cOne day I realized ... I was wearing the same blue bathrobe,\\u201d the mother writes. Paranormal trappings aside, this story speaks to the feeling of whiplash brought on by time\\u2019s passing.\", \"Slipping can be significant, as any Freudian will tell you, and these narratives are riddles whose answers might tell us about our relationship to time. I have begun considering the message boards on which they are exchanged to be narrow but important release valves, allowing posters to talk about the feelings that arise from being time-bound: depression, midlife crises, the dysmorphia of living in a human body. What ailed Miss Smith, whose car slid into a ditch after a cocktail party, and who witnessed \\u201cgroups of Pictish warriors of the late seventh century, ca. 685 AD,\\u201d if not an understanding of her smallness in history\\u2019s vast expanse? Why did two academics, famous in the time-slip community for writing a book about spotting Marie Antoinette in the Versailles grounds, encounter trees that looked lifeless, \\u201clike wood worked in tapestry\\u201d? Perhaps in that instant, like the last queen of France\\u2019s Ancien R\\u00e9gime, they felt radically out of joint with their present moment.\", \"If you suspend disbelief, you\\u2019ll find these threads constitute a philosophical inquiry about the place of the spirit in our physical beings. They debate the merits of subjectivity and objectivity and question the idea that time is a one-lane highway to death. These writers argue that our past and future can suffuse our present, unveiling an epic dimension of our quotidian existences in moments when we slip and, like Frank, feel eternity.\"]","href_hash":"4ab3c45846c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4ab3c45846c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
