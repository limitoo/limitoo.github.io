There have always been dissension and clashes between the two political parties, but there has rarely been anything as utterly ugly as what is going on today.\", \"That a young man at a rally can ask when can we start killing Democrats and get a round of applause is a travesty. Threats of violence have become the norm in the Republican Party, fueled by the unscrupulous twice-impeached promoter of the Big Lie.\", \"Representative Paul Gosar should be ousted for the video in which he portrays slaying Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene should be ousted as well for promoting vile conspiracy theories and listing as traitors the 13 Republicans who voted to pass the infrastructure bill.\", \"Because of her they are getting death threats. Their biggest crime was daring to vote for a bill that would benefit all Americans, instead of toeing the party line. The Republicans who stand by and do nothing and say nothing are equally guilty in their silence.\", \"There is a war on our democracy. Violence is taking over our government. Our elected officials should do the job they were elected to do, uphold the Constitution and govern for the good of the people.\", \"Milena CornickNew York\", \"To the Editor:\", \"So Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona tweeted an anime video altered to show him killing Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and swinging two swords at President Biden. When questioned, Mr. Gosar\\u2019s office offered this response: \\u201cIt is a symbolic cartoon. It is not real life.\\u201d Well, duh!\", \"While we all understand that this is not \\u201creal life,\\u201d we also understand that this type of political violence porn contributes to the actions of unhinged people that we saw in the Jan. 6 assault on Congress. Revving up the nutballs who are just waiting to create more havoc in our public life should not be the task of elected officials, if they are acting like adults. Paul Gosar should be ashamed of himself.\", \"Judith Koll HealeyMinneapolis\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Your report gives grudging acknowledgment that \\u201celements of the left have contributed to the confrontational tenor of the country\\u2019s current politics,\\u201d but then proceeds to document only statements by Republicans.\", \"I am thinking of a statement by a Democratic representative, Maxine Waters, during the trial of Derek Chauvin over George Floyd\\u2019s death: \\u201cWe\\u2019ve got to get more confrontational. We\\u2019ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business.\\u201d This pales in comparison with recent comments by a Black Lives Matter leader, Hawk Newsome, about possible changes in policing: \\u201cThere will be riots, there will be fire and there will be bloodshed.\\u201d\", \"It isn\\u2019t only talk. The looting and fires in New York City in June 2020 were not by Republicans. And let\\u2019s not forget Kenosha, Portland and Minneapolis.\", \"Alexander GoldsteinBrooklyn\", \"To the Editor:\", \"The biggest threat to our democracy is not an outside threat, but politicians and their followers who are willing to threaten their opponents over the results of free and fair elections.\", \"If Republican leaders felt that this violence was unwarranted and harmful to their political brand, they would immediately denounce these assaults against democracy. Why are so many so complacent about attacks that would be considered existential if they came from foreign actors?\", \"Edwin AndrewsMalden, Mass.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Senators Kyrsten Sinema and Joe Manchin are facing criticism from Democrats for not toeing the party line. As a bisexual Democrat, I find it horrifying to watch the criticism of Ms. Sinema devolve into sly biphobic attacks that are increasing in frequency and ferocity.\", \"Recent articles about Senator Sinema, including in The New York Times, focus on her person, not her politics. Democrats are attacking her because she is not voting the way they want her to vote, and the attacks are using her bisexuality as a weapon against her.\", \"One article, for example, refers to Ms. Sinema\\u2019s style choices viewed as \\u201ca type of pinkwashing: leveraging positive associations with gay culture and identity to distract from one\\u2019s negative actions.\\u201d\", \"Meanwhile, without federal anti-discrimination legislation, bisexuals face discrimination across the United States. One of the places making strides to eliminate L.G.B.T. discrimination is Arizona, Ms. Sinema\\u2019s state.\", \"Whether or not one agrees with all of Ms. Sinema\\u2019s policy positions, and I often don\\u2019t, as an American who cherishes democracy I believe that it is her right (and, as an elected official, her duty) to determine her own political positions, free from attacks on her identity.\", \"(Rev.)

After all, the stain of the past was often directed at specific races.\", \"Our lawmakers must decide how many people can immigrate to our country each year. Open borders are disruptive, expensive and harmful to Americans who need assistance. Money used for undocumented immigrants is money that could be used to subsidize poor Americans, including the aid being proposed in Congress today.\", \"Many Americans who are not xenophobic want the crisis on our southern border to end, not because they hate one group of people or another, but because millions of people are entering the country illegally.\", \"The essay suggests that the United States accept the unprecedented illegal immigration on our southern border because of actions that took place long before most of us were born.\", \"Salvatore J.

In the Somaliland Republic, which broke away from the south as a self-declared country, there have been democratic elections and peaceful transitions between administrations, and it, too, has contained Al Shabab.\", \"If so many Somalis reject the central government, why should the United States support it? Continuing to back what your article calls the \\u201cfractious political elite\\u201d in Mogadishu is a prescription for a mini-Afghanistan on the Horn of Africa.\", \"Martin R.
