The shortages are expected to hit African countries the hardest.\", \"\\u201cThat will be truly disappointing,\\u201d said Prashant Yadav \\u2014 a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, a Washington research organization, and an expert on health care supply chains \\u2014 \\u201cthat after having waited for over a year to get a reasonable quantity of vaccines, when they do obtain the vaccines, they don\\u2019t have syringes to administer them.\\u201d\", \"Although India is a small player in overall global exports, it is a major producer of the type of syringe that is being used globally for coronavirus vaccinations. The syringes break on second use to prevent the spreading of disease through reuse.\", \"Covax, the vaccine-sharing initiative, is seeking the syringes from manufacturers around the world, and India was expected to meet at least 15 percent of the global demand for use with Covid vaccines and other inoculations.\", \"The situation became so acute last month that the World Health Organization and PAHO asked India to allow Mr. Nath\\u2019s company, Hindustan Syringes and Medical Devices, one of the world\\u2019s largest syringe makers, to ship the orders it had agreed to before the restrictions were announced. Prime Minister Narendra Modi\\u2019s government subsequently increased the export quota for the health organizations but did not allow a blanket exemption.\", \"The World Health Organization and UNICEF have warned that the syringe shortage could have \\u201cdire consequences\\u201d for the global vaccination effort.\", \"In India, more than half of the 1.4 billion-strong population has received at least one shot of a Covid vaccine, but only 27 percent of people are fully vaccinated, according to a New York Times database. And new inoculations have slowed recently.\", \"Unlike vaccine doses, syringes are bulky and are typically transported by sea. The shortage comes amid large disruptions in the global supply chain of shipped goods, and experts say that a Covax-like initiative is needed, with nations coming together to better supply syringes to poorer countries.\", \"UNICEF, a major buyer of syringes for Covax, said in a statement on Wednesday that \\u201csyringe nationalism\\u201d could be addressed if big producers and wealthy countries \\u201cinfluence global markets in a way that unlocks access for other countries in the global south.\\u201d\", \"The agency also said it was considering expanding use of another type of syringe approved by the W.H.O. that also prevents reuse.\", \"Dozens of Indian syringe makers spent millions of dollars to scale up manufacturing last year, but buyers are increasingly relying on manufacturers in China.\", \"ProcureNet, a Hong Kong-based supplier of pharmaceutical products, said this week that it would invest $20 million in Anhui Tiankang Medical, a Chinese manufacturer, to produce 750 million syringes for P.A.H.O. and other buyers.\", \"\\u201cWe continue to spend billions on the vaccine,\\u201d said Gurbaksh Chahal, ProcureNet\\u2019s chief executive, \\u201cbut what good is the vaccine if we don\\u2019t have the tools to deliver the vaccine to the people?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8ae159a6485811ec885e27dac71e361a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8ae159a6485811ec885e27dac71e361a"}},
