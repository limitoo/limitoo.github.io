Newcomers to the sport appreciated the fresh air and exercise, not to mention the relatively low cost when compared to Alpine skiing. And they likely discovered what has long drawn devotees: the carefree pleasure of gliding along a snow-muffled trail, whether in solitude or with a group of like-minded companions, and the understated beauty of a winter landscape.\", \"In Sun Valley, Idaho, revenue at the ski area\\u2019s cross-country center increased 25 to 30 percent last winter compared to the previous one, according to the Nordic director, Steve Haims. He doubled his purchase of apparel, accessories like hats and gloves, and equipment for the center\\u2019s shop this winter.\", \"In Jackson, N. H., more people than usual took cross-country ski lessons last winter. \\u201cIt felt good to be able to offer people an outdoor experience,\\u201d said Ellen Chandler, the executive director of the Jackson Ski Touring Foundation, which oversees the area\\u2019s Nordic trails. \\u201cI think skiers were surprised sometimes,\\u201d said Ms. Chandler. \\u201cThey expected it to be harder.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cCross-country skiing is an activity that\\u2019s easy to do for a half-hour or an hour \\u2014 you can pretty much park right at the ski-area trailhead and, for the most part, there\\u2019s low impact on the body,\\u201d said Reese Brown, the executive director of the nonprofit Cross Country Ski Areas Association. Plus, Mr. Brown points out, the gear has advanced, with recreational skiers \\u2014 who don\\u2019t have the same equipment-weight concerns as elite racers \\u2014 able to opt for wider, shorter skis and warmer boots. (With global supply-chain issues affecting gear shipments, skiers should book rentals in advance.)\", \"During the pandemic, cross-country skiers have avoided many of the restrictions faced by Alpine skiers. Last winter and this, the primary guidelines involve masking up inside day lodges. Some Nordic centers only offered private lessons last year and continue to do so, finding that many guests preferred them.\", \"Ready to give cross-country a try? The sampling of centers here all offer a seamless introduction to the sport, through regularly scheduled lessons, meticulously groomed trails, on-site rentals and other activities nearby for when you need a break. But they are only a few options among many: Visit the Cross Country Ski Areas Association website for many more ideas.\", \"(Note that in a holdover from the sports\\u2019 European roots, Nordic centers refer to the length of their trails in kilometers, rather than miles.)\", \"For a ski trip with an agricultural bent, visit this 5,000-acre parcel 30 miles from Portland, which includes a working farm, an equestrian center and 30 kilometers of Nordic trails designed by John Morton, an Olympic biathlete and noted trail builder. After learning the basics in a wide-open space by the day lodge (Nordic centers often refer to this area as the stadium), skiers can ply novice-friendly trails like the River Loop, which meanders for 7 kilometers along the Royal River, and several routes on Oak Hill, where the namesake trees shelter skiers from wind, and the north-facing aspect caches snow. The Holstein Loop pays tribute to the farm\\u2019s cows, one of the oldest registered herds of its breed in the country. Cross-country skiing burns a lot of calories, but you won\\u2019t go hungry here. Upstairs in the lodge, a market and cafe sell provisions and to-go meals sourced from Pineland and other local farms, including fresh cheese curds from Pineland\\u2019s own dairy company. On weekends, two warming cabins along the trails serve soup, sandwiches and snacks. The property includes four large rental houses for lodging.\", \"Details: Adult day pass, $20; private lessons, from $50, group lessons, $30 per person; daily rentals, $20 to $24.\", \"It\\u2019s hard to talk about cross-country skiing without mentioning Trapp\\u2019s, as it\\u2019s familiarly known. When Johannes von Trapp (of \\u201cSound of Music\\u201d fame) added Nordic trails to his hotel\\u2019s amenities in 1968, along with rentals and a ski school, he created North America\\u2019s first full-service, cross-country center. Now 65 kilometers of trails wind through a classic Vermont landscape straight out of a snow globe, and other Nordic centers have opened around Stowe, making the area a cross-country hub. At Trapp\\u2019s Practice Meadow, beginners learn the mechanics of kick and glide before heading out on routes like the wide and gentle Sugar Road, and then, perhaps, skiing Lager Lane right to the lodge\\u2019s own brewery and beer hall for apr\\u00e8s ski. Goals to aim for this visit or next: Ascending (and later descending) 800 vertical feet over 5 kilometers to the trailside Cabin, where soup, mulled cider and a welcoming stone fireplace await, or skiing from Trapp\\u2019s to Stowe Mountain Resort\\u2019s Cross Country Center, which offers another 45 kilometers of trails adjacent to the downhill ski area on Mount Mansfield.\", \"Details: Adult day pass, $26 midweek, $29 weekends; private lessons, from $80, group lessons, $35 per person; rentals, $30 to $50.\", \"Situated on a high plateau just east of the Green Mountains, Craftsbury doesn\\u2019t have as much hilly terrain as some other Vermont Nordic centers \\u2014 good news for beginners. Yet the 105 kilometers of trails provide ample variety for skiers of all levels, and many post-collegiate athletes train here. A novel method ensures early-season snow coverage: making snow the winter before when temperatures allow for optimum efficiency, then storing it under layers of special blankets and damp wood chips. Among the center\\u2019s beginner-friendly routes, the Great and Little Hosmer Pond trails circumnavigate solidly frozen lakes, which means suitably flat terrain. Access the network\\u2019s farthest reaches \\u2014 the Greensboro Trails \\u2014 by driving or riding a shuttle ($5) to the trailheads. Up for another challenge? Thanks to a competition-caliber range installed a few years ago, Craftsbury also gives lessons in biathlon, which combines skiing with rifle shooting (from $50, ages 10 and up). Once a private boys\\u2019 school, the Outdoor Center\\u2019s campus offers lodging \\u2014 from dorm-style rooms to trailside cabins \\u2014 with three meals a day sourced from local farms (guests 5 and over must show proof of vaccination this winter).\", \"Details: Adult day pass, $10 (trail fee included with lodging); private lessons from $45; daily rentals, $15.\", \"For a European-style skiing experience, look to this 100-kilometer trail network that winds throughout the town of Jackson, past the base of Black Mountain downhill ski area and into the surrounding White Mountain National Forest. The iconic red covered bridges, however, clearly ground it in New England \\u2014 you can actually kick and glide through one of those bridges, across the Ellis River. The nonprofit Jackson Ski Touring Foundation, which celebrates its 50th anniversary in 2022 maintains and grooms the trails, which run right by many of Jackson\\u2019s hotels and restaurants. Lessons (and rentals) are based at a snow-covered golf course, which provides gentle learning terrain and a few small hills to practice on. Then head out through the woods for a long ski on the mellow Ellis River Trail, taking time to detour onto the Riverbank Loop, where a \\u201cstory trail\\u201d features pages from a kids\\u2019 book; by the time you ski by the last page, you\\u2019ll have neared the Cocoa Cabin for a hot drink. When snow is sparser in town, the trails at Prospect Farm, a thousand feet higher in elevation, usually have ample coverage, sometimes into early May.\", \"Details: Adult day pass, $21; private lessons from $60; beginners\\u2019 package including lesson, rental and trail pass, $65; daily rentals, $20.\", \"What better place to learn to cross-country ski in an Olympics winter than at a venue created for the 1980 Winter Games? Especially since Mount Van Hoevenberg\\u2019s skiing and sliding facilities just received an $80 million investment in advance of the 2023 Winter World University Games, a biannual event that\\u2019s second only to the Olympics and Paralympics in size and stature. The Nordic upgrades, in particular, include a huge new day lodge with a cafe, a snow-making system, additional ski trails and a new biathlon range. On any given day, the skier who passes you on the trail could be a past or maybe future Olympian, but it\\u2019s not all elite-level competitors here. The center offers a two-hour introductory lesson that includes rentals and a trail pass ($65), and even novice biathlon lessons ($65, ages 14 and up). While gliding through the woods on beginner-friendly trails like Flatlander and Zig Zag, stop in at Josie\\u2019s Cabin for a waffle topped with maple syrup from nearby trees, then warm up by the bonfire outside.\", \"Details: Adult day pass, $32; private lessons, $100, group lessons, $40 per person; daily rentals, $25.\", \"An hour-and-a-half drive from Denver, this 5,000-acre ranch run by the YMCA of the Rockies offers a slew of family-oriented winter activities, but cross-country skiing is the main draw. Now, with the Olympic silver medalist Todd Lodwick as the new Nordic center director, the 120-kilometer network received a face-lift to ensure even better skiing: Trails were widened, errant rocks and stumps removed, and abrupt transitions, like tricky turns, smoothed out. A new, flatter teaching area makes it easier for beginners to work on balance. In addition to regular instruction, the ranch now offers skijoring lessons with pups from the ranch\\u2019s sled dog teams; the dog, on a flexible lead, runs in front of the skier. What hasn\\u2019t changed: the variety of terrain (with something for every skier), the relaxed vibe and the magnificent views of the Continental Divide. The ranch offers hotel rooms or cabins, as well as a few dining options. For even more skiing, the upscale Devil\\u2019s Thumb Ranch Resort and Spa, with another 120 kilometers of trails, is just 10 miles away.\", \"Details: Adult day pass, $25 (included with lodging); private lessons from $50, group lessons, $40 per person; daily rentals, $22 to $35.\", \"Soldier Hollow (known locally as SoHo) provides an Olympic-inspired experience \\u2014 many of the trails were created for the 2002 Winter Games hosted by nearby Salt Lake City \\u2014 amid a very different landscape than the wooded trails at Lake Placid. Set among former sheep-grazing meadows within Wasatch Mountain State Park, Soldier Hollow\\u2019s wide, undulating trails, 22.5 kilometers in all, range from race-ready to novice-friendly. After the Olympics, in fact, several flatter, gentler trails were added to the system, and the Nordic center has taught many local kids to ski through its comprehensive development program. All that\\u2019s to say that Soldier Hollow takes its instruction seriously. And with the two-time Olympian Luke Bodensteiner as manager, the venue\\u2019s grooming and trail maintenance are top notch, too. Even though Utah gets plenty of natural snow, Soldier Hollow\\u2019s extensive snow-making system guarantees good early-season coverage, as well as prime conditions for the competitions still regularly held here (like the Biathlon Youth and Junior World Championships from Feb. 21 to Mar 3, 2022). The surrounding Heber Valley offers various lodging options.\", \"Details: Adult day pass, $15; private lessons from $70, group lessons, $50 per person, daily rentals, $25.\", \"Sun Valley may be renowned for its downhill ski area, but excellent, and extensive, Nordic trail systems make this a first-class cross-country ski destination, too. Start at the ski area\\u2019s Nordic center, where a teaching area and a series of unintimidating practice loops adjoin the center\\u2019s lavish clubhouse. From there, 40 kilometers of trails meander through two golf courses and into the adjacent forest. Another 200 kilometers of groomed track scribble the Wood River Valley, which extends northwest and south from Ketchum. The Wood River Trail itself, a gentle former railroad grade, provides perfect novice terrain. Plan a day at the Galena Lodge, encircled by 50 kilometers of rolling trails within the Sawtooth National Recreation Area, a region of craggy peaks and grand vistas. The rustic venue, 23 miles from Ketchum on the site of a former mining town, offers ski lessons and lunch, fueling skiers with soups and sandwiches on house-baked bread. Free shuttles run from Ketchum to the lodge on weekends through the end of February; the buses also stop at several points along the way that offer access to groomed loops within the North Valley Trails system.\", \"Details: At Sun Valley Nordic, adult day pass, $32, private lessons from $135, daily rentals, $32\\u00ad to 38; adult day pass for North Valley Trails, $18; at Galena Lodge, private lessons from $70, beginner\\u2019s lesson with rental and ski pass, $85; daily rentals, $30 to $40.\", \"Seattle skiers regularly drive four or five hours to this valley in the North Cascades for some of the best cross-country skiing anywhere, with reliable snow, high-mountain scenery \\u2014 and sun. (Skiers from out of state could also fly into Spokane, a three and-a-half hour drive.) Two hundred kilometers of groomed track \\u2014 North America\\u2019s largest continuous trail system \\u2014 connect the five small towns strung along the valley, anchored by the 32-kilometer Community Trail. Get started with lessons at the Methow Valley Ski School in Mazama or at Sun Mountain Lodge outside Winthrop. Then explore gentler routes like the Big Valley Inner and Outer Loops or head out on the flatter parts of the Community Trail from Mazama or from Winthrop (the middle section is hillier). A highlight: skiing across the Methow River on a 280-foot-long suspension bridge. Sun Mountain Lodge, overlooking Patterson Lake, has trails out its door. A few of them remain closed this winter following last summer\\u2019s wildfires, but the lodge itself has been thoroughly restored from smoke damage.\", \"Details: Adult day pass, $25; private lessons, from $65; daily rentals, $25.\", \"Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.
