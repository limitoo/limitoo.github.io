Robert E. Lee towered over Richmond for more than a century believe they've found a time capsule that was buried there in 1887.

The box appears to be the copper time capsule, said Devon Henry, owner of the construction company that is working to remove the pedestal.\", \"Clark Mercer, Governor Northam's chief of staff, confirmed the discovery, but said crews still need to dislodge the box from a large granite block to be sure it is the time capsule.\", \"\\\"It looks like it is (the time capsule),\\\" Mercer said. \\\"We're hoping it hasn't been damaged by water over the last 100-plus years.\\\"\", \"A newspaper article from 1887 suggests the capsule contains Civil War memorabilia and a \\\"picture of Lincoln lying in his coffin,\\\" although historians believe it's doubtful the picture is an actual photograph, which would be rare and valuable.\", \"WTVR reports that\\u00a0 records from the Library of Virginia suggest that 37 Richmond residents, organizations and businesses contributed about 60 objects to the capsule, many of which are believed to be related to the Confederacy.\", \"The station reported officials created a\\u00a0new time capsule\\u00a0to replace the one from 1887, even though it had not been found at the time.
