The police initially investigated the incident as a possible hate crime, then accused Mr. Smollett of staging the attack himself. Charges were filed against Mr. Smollett, then dropped. A special prosecutor was appointed and charges were filed again, leading to his trial on charges of disorderly conduct for making a false report to the police.\", \"Here\\u2019s a timeline of how we got here.\", \"Jan. 29, 2019: Mr. Smollett, who is Black and gay, tells the police that at about 2 a.m., two masked men, one of whom he believed to be white, attacked him on the 300 block of East Lower North Water Street in downtown Chicago. The assailants, according to Mr. Smollett, hurled homophobic and racial slurs at him, put a rope around his neck and poured a chemical substance on him.\", \"Mr. Smollett says he went home and a close associate of his reported the incident to the police 40 minutes after it happened. Anthony Guglielmi, the chief spokesman for the Chicago Police Department, later told The Chicago Sun-Times that Mr. Smollett had been hesitant to call the police because of his status as a public figure.\", \"Law enforcement officials say they are treating the incident \\u201cas a possible hate crime.\\u201d At a follow-up visit by investigators, Mr. Smollett says the attackers mentioned \\u201cMAGA country,\\u201d a reference to the campaign slogan of former President Donald J. Trump.\", \"Celebrities, politicians and advocacy groups offer their support to Mr. Smollett. Fox, the network on which \\u201cEmpire\\u201d airs, issues a statement saying the \\u201centire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate.\\u201d\", \"Detectives comb through surveillance camera recordings but say they can\\u2019t find images of the attack.\", \"Jan. 30: Investigators announce the first possible break in the case: A surveillance image shows \\u201cpotential persons of interest wanted for questioning\\u201d in connection to the case. The images are of two men with their backs to the camera.\", \"At this point, the F.B.I. is already investigating a threatening letter sent to Mr. Smollett at the \\u201cEmpire\\u201d production offices in Chicago the week before.\", \"Jan. 31: Mr. Trump is asked about the incident in the Oval Office. He refers to it as \\u201chorrible\\u201d and added that it \\u201cdoesn\\u2019t get worse.\\u201d\", \"The Smollett family releases a statement: \\u201cJussie was the victim of a violent and unprovoked attack. We want to be clear, this was a racial and homophobic hate crime. Jussie has told the police everything from the very beginning. His story has never changed, and we are hopeful they will find these men and bring them to justice.\\u201d\", \"Feb. 1: Mr. Smollett releases his first public statement through his publicist. It says: \\u201cLet me start by saying that I\\u2019m OK. My body is strong but my soul is stronger. More importantly, I want to say thank you. The outpouring of love and support from my village has meant more than I will ever be able to truly put into words.\\u201d\", \"Acknowledging some skepticism about his story on social media, Mr. Smollett adds, \\u201cI am working with authorities and have been 100 percent factual and consistent on every level. Despite my frustrations and deep concern with certain inaccuracies and misrepresentations that have been spread, I still believe that justice will be served.\\u201d\", \"The Chicago police superintendent, Eddie T. Johnson, says in an interview with a local television station: \\u201cWe have to remember, he\\u2019s a victim. You know, so we have to treat it like he\\u2019s a victim. We have no reason to think that he\\u2019s not being genuine with us.\\u201d\", \"Feb. 2: Mr. Smollett appears in public for the first time since he reported the attack, performing a concert in West Hollywood.\", \"\\u201cI have so many words on my heart that I want to say, but the most important thing I can say is, thank you so much, and that I\\u2019m OK,\\u201d Mr. Smollett tells the crowd.\", \"Feb. 4: The Chicago police say the people of interest have not been identified yet but they are continuing to follow up on leads.\", \"Feb. 11: The department reacts to phone records that Mr. Smollett turned over to investigators. The police had asked Mr. Smollett for access to his phone because he had been in conversation with his manager when the incident occurred. Mr. Smollett provides the police with redacted records that they say \\u201cdo not meet the burden for a criminal investigation.\\u201d\", \"Feb. 13: Two brothers of Nigerian descent, Olabinjo and Abimbola Osundairo, are detained by the authorities after a flight back home to Chicago from Nigeria. Police officers raid their home and, according to CBS Chicago, remove items including an \\u201cEmpire\\u201d script and two hats.\", \"Feb. 14: Mr. Smollett gives his first interview about the incident to \\u201cGood Morning America,\\u201d where he is adamant that he is telling the truth.\", \"\\u201cIt feels like if I had said it was a Muslim, or a Mexican, or someone Black, I feel like the doubters would have supported me much more,\\u201d Mr. Smollett tells ABC\\u2019s Robin Roberts. \\u201cA lot more.\\u201d\", \"He also says he is convinced that the men in the surveillance images were his attackers.\", \"\\u201cBecause I was there,\\u201d Mr. Smollett says. \\u201cFor me, when that was released, I was like, \\u2018OK, we\\u2019re getting somewhere.\\u2019 I don\\u2019t have any doubt in my mind that that\\u2019s them. Never did.\\u201d\", \"The Chicago police reveal publicly that at least one of the men detained has appeared as an extra on \\u201cEmpire.\\u201d The department also says they \\u201care not yet suspects.\\u201d Their lawyer, Gloria Schmidt, tells CBS Chicago: \\u201cThey\\u2019re really baffled why they are people of interest. They really don\\u2019t understand how they even got information that linked them to this horrific crime. But they\\u2019re not guilty of it. They know that the evidence is going to prove them innocent. They send their best to Jussie.\\u201d\", \"The local news media releases its first reports that investigators are beginning to look at the possibility that this is a hoax, something the Chicago police dispute publicly.\", \"Feb. 15: In a whirlwind day, the detained brothers are identified as potential suspects by police, but that night are released without being charged. Investigators announce they are no longer considered suspects but do not say why.\", \"Feb. 16: The police say they are seeking to speak with Mr. Smollett again. Media outlets, including CNN, report that the two men have told investigators they were paid to take part in a hoax. Mr. Guglielmi says in a statement, \\u201cWe can confirm that the information received from the individuals questioned by police earlier in the \\u2018Empire\\u2019 case has in fact shifted the trajectory of the investigation.\\u201d\", \"Lawyers for Mr. Smollett release a statement saying, \\u201cAs a victim of a hate crime who has cooperated with the police investigation, Jussie Smollett is angered and devastated by recent reports that the perpetrators are individuals he is familiar with.\\u201d\", \"It added: \\u201cOne of these purported suspects was Jussie\\u2019s personal trainer who he hired to ready him physically for a music video. It is impossible to believe that this person could have played a role in the crime against Jussie or would falsely claim Jussie\\u2019s complicity.\\u201d\", \"The lawyers say that Mr. Smollett will \\u201ccontinue to cooperate\\u201d and that they \\u201chave no inclination to respond to \\u2018unnamed\\u2019 sources inside of the investigation.\\u201d\", \"Feb. 20: Fox releases a statement in support of Mr. Smollett amid reports that his role was being reduced on \\u201cEmpire.\\u201d Later in the day, the Chicago police announce that they consider Mr. Smollett a suspect in the filing of a false report.\", \"Mr. Smollett is charged by the Cook County State\\u2019s Attorney\\u2019s Office with a felony disorderly conduct charge in connection with the police report he filed. His lawyers issue a statement, saying: \\u201cLike any other citizen, Mr. Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked. Given these circumstances, we intend to conduct a thorough investigation and to mount an aggressive defense.\\u201d\", \"Fox later declines to comment on the criminal charge.\", \"Feb. 21: Mr. Smollett is arrested in the morning by the Chicago police, who say the actor staged his own assault because he was upset over his salary on \\u201cEmpire.\\u201d Mr. Smollett posts bail and is released.\", \"Mr. Smollett\\u2019s legal team releases a statement saying the court system had trampled \\u201cthe presumption of innocence\\u201d in a \\u201claw enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system.\\u201d\", \"Support for the actor flags as some celebrities who had initially supported him take down their social media posts.

Toomin of the Circuit Court of Cook County orders that a special prosecutor be appointed to independently investigate charges that Mr. Smollett staged the attack, as well as the prosecutors\\u2019 decision to drop the felony counts against him.
