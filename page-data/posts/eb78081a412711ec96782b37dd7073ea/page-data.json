political transformation\\u00a0he's undergone.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I know my constituents will be enthusiastically embracing electric vehicles,\\\" first term Liberal MP Katie Allen offered.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I myself have bought an electric vehicle.\\\"\", \"It was an unfathomable sight compared to the 2019 election campaign, when the Prime Minister insisted Labor's embrace of electric vehicles (EV) was the declaration of war against the weekend.\\u00a0\", \"So here stood Morrison in 2021, in a state that some in the Coalition dub as enemy territory, offering a full throated endorsement of EVs.\", \"This isn't a climate conversion for Morrison but rather an awakening to public sentiment that could threaten the political careers on urban Liberal MPs and ultimately\\u00a0his time as PM.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/53c2f42786d8ff5307d3331d6fdb08ed\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Scott Morrison made his first trip to Melbourne in six months to announce his new electric vehicles policy.(ABC News: Danielle Bonica)</div>\", \"It's not unusual for backbenchers to introduce the Prime Minister when he visits electorates.\", \"But in this case,\\u00a0Allen was a long way from home \\u2014 literally standing on the opposite side of Melbourne to those constituents she was talking about.\", \"The PM's trip to Melbourne was complete with enough photo opportunities that you could be forgiven for thinking the election campaign was already under way.\\u00a0\", \"And if this is a shadow campaign, it's no wonder Allen was on the frontline of people the PM wants re-elected.\", \"Allen, Melburnian frontbenchers Josh Frydenberg, Greg Hunt and Tim Wilson and Sydney Liberals Trent Zimmeran, Dave Sharma and Jason Falinski are all in the sights of well funded and organised independent campaigns keen to campaign on climate change and government integrity.\", \"It's why Allen, Sharma, Zimmerman and Fallinski were keen to speak out in support of the Coalition adopting a net zero carbon by 2050 pledge as the PM battled to get the National Party on board with the policy.\", \"For these Liberals, every concession the PM makes for rural Nats\\u00a0risk coming at the expense of their own electoral fortunes.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Culture wars aplenty in 2019 campaign</div>\", \"\\\"Bill Shorten wants to end the weekend when it comes to his policy on electric vehicles,\\\" Morrison decried in the last campaign.\", \"\\\"He wants to say 'see you later to the SUV,'\\\" he would go on to say.\", \"You can forget towing a boat or going off road, the PM insisted, as he sought to win over his so-called quiet Australians.\", \"These are your salt-of-the-earth Australians,\\u00a0mum and dads with a couple of kids quietly going about their lives in the suburbs, maybe with a 4x4 and love of camping and fishing.\\u00a0\", \"These are the people Morrison attributes to delivering him what many believed was an unwinnable election in 2019.\", \"It's all code for \\\"urban elites\\\" are coming for your way of life in the outer suburbs and regions.\", \"It was a culture war the PM was again keen to tap into\\u00a0earlier this year when he used a\\u00a0speech to business leaders in Sydney to appear to mock inner-city voters, saying, \\\"we will not achieve net zero in the cafes, dinner parties and wine bars of our inner cities\\\".\", \"The electoral problem for Morrison is that these cafes are also dotted throughout the once safe urban Liberal seats now at threat from independents.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d3d611f0c8faa1f958dbe4df9fad5258\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Bill Shorten and Anthony Albanese campaigned on the need for\\u00a0greater electric vehicle uptake during the last federal election.(ABC News: Marco Catalano)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Landscape changing ahead of looming election</div>\", \"At the last election, Shorten and Labor\\u00a0made fuel efficient vehicles a key part of the failed\\u00a02019 campaign, promising half of all new cars sold in Australia by 2030 would be electric.\", \"There were no obligations, just aims to transition\\u00a0the nation's vehicles.\", \"Morrison insists he was never against electric vehicles.\", \"When asked if he regretted comparing electric vehicles to weekend destroying, Morrison said he was \\\"against Bill Shorten's mandate policy, trying to tell people\\u00a0what to do with their lives, what cars they were supposed to drive and where they could drive\\\".\", \"The suggestion that there was a mandate or that people would be forced to buy or drive certain cars is a misrepresentation of Labor's 2019 policy.\\u00a0\", \"The Coalition's 2021 EV policy is to boost the number of\\u00a0charging stations across the country.\", \"But the government won't be seeking to reduce the prices of EVs, something Labor has pledged by making these cars exempt from certain tariffs and taxes.\\u00a0\", \"When presented with the new Coalition policy, Shorten, no longer Labor leader, insisted the\\u00a0charging station proposal had come straight from Labor.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Mr Morrison must read my policy book at night time for ideas,\\\" he told Channel Nine.\", \"<img

picking up Chisholm, the Liberal-held seat neighbouring Allen's.\", \"She, like her fellow moderate Liberals, will be sweating on fewer weekend-ending declarations and greater Coalition support for climate change action if she's to keep her seat in the Liberal tally on election night.\", \"The trouble for Morrison, as Shorten learned the hard way, is if he's found saying one thing in northern Nationals seats and different messages in urban Liberal seats, that road to electoral victory becomes even bumpier.\", \"<img
