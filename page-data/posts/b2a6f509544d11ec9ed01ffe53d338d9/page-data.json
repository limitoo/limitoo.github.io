To which those familiar with such Verhoeven classics as \\u201cBasic Instinct,\\u201d \\u201cShowgirls\\u201d and \\u201cStarship Troopers\\u201d may well respond: Duh.\", \"Naturally, the Dutch director\\u2019s latest, set in a 17th century convent, was not going to be suited to the History Channel. \\u201cBenedetta,\\u201d which is based on Judith C. Brown\\u2019s nonfiction book \\u201cImmodest Acts: The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy,\\u201d follows the rise of the title character (Virginie Efira) from young novice to abbess of her convent, her affair with a fellow nun, Bartolomea (Daphn\\u00e9 Patakia), and what happens when their relationship is discovered by the church.\", \"Efira, a French-Belgian actress, is a longtime Verhoeven fan and knows his career inside out, from his early 1970s taboo-flouting movies to his Hollywood work. She also had a supporting role alongside Isabelle Huppert in his \\u201cElle,\\u201d from 2016, which The Times described as \\u201ca masterpiece of perversity.\\u201d\", \"So when Verhoeven wanted to discuss giving her the lead role in \\u201cBenedetta\\u201d (in theaters Stateside on Friday), Efira knew what to expect \\u2014 up to a point, because they were chatting in English, a second language for both, and she ran into a vocabulary problem.\", \"\\u201cHe said, \\u2018There is a lot of sex scenes,\\u2019\\u201d Efira recalled in a video conversation, switching from French to English to re-enact the conversation. \\u201cI said, \\u2018No problem.\\u2019 \\u2018With girls.\\u2019 \\u2018No problem.\\u2019 Then he said something about a dildo and I pretended to know what he was talking about: \\u2018Dildo \\u2026 yes?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Of course she signed up for what turned out to be a Verhoeven film through and through, vividly displaying the many contradictions that make his work fascinating.\", \"He has been accused of sacrilege and gratuitous provocation; he has also written a book about Jesus that focuses on him as a historical and political figure rather than a spiritual one, and has long dreamed of making a movie along the same lines. The director has a taste for glossy spectacle and an eye for delirious mise-en-sc\\u00e8ne, matched with a darkly subversive bent and a taste for ambiguity.\", \"Speaking by phone from The Hague in the Netherlands, Verhoeven, 83, charmingly leapfrogged from subject to subject as he quoted from Brown\\u2019s book and illustrated points with examples from his earlier movies, including the 1990 \\u201cTotal Recall.\\u201d This is a man with opinions who delights in sharing them. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"What drew you to Judith C. Brown\\u2019s book?\", \"There are the two aspects: a woman trying to gather power at a time when it was very difficult for women to achieve, but also how the Catholic Church looked at lesbianism. To build a movie on something that really happened \\u2014 I did it with \\u201cSoldier of Orange\\u201d [1977] a long time ago, but the American movies I did, of course, were not based on any real events. \\u201cShowgirls\\u201d [1995] to a certain degree. [Laughs.]\", \"Benedetta has stigmata, but it\\u2019s unclear whether she is a visionary or a fraud, or both.\", \"I felt that I should not decide for the audience. In \\u201cTotal Recall,\\u201d there are two narratives and they\\u2019re both believable: One is that he is basically in a dream and he will be lobotomized at the end of the movie; in the other one, he is the savior of Mars. You can also compare it a little bit with \\u201cBasic Instinct\\u201d [1992]: At the end of the movie, it\\u2019s not completely clear if Sharon Stone really did it or if it was Jeanne Tripplehorn. There was something interesting for me to accept multiple realities.\", \"Benedetta certainly pursues what she wants, not unlike Sharon Stone\\u2019s character in \\u201cBasic Instinct\\u201d or Nomi in \\u201cShowgirls.\\u201d\", \"Nomi is very much taking her life in her hands, and she goes wherever she wants to go. You could say Benedetta is a little bit the same. If you look at the scene when she pretends that Jesus has given her a new heart and she tells Bartolomea, \\u201cFeel how big my heart is, feel, feel,\\u201d and Bartolomea says, \\u201cYes, it\\u2019s very big and it is going up and up and up\\u201d \\u2014 it\\u2019s very effective because what she\\u2019s doing is touching the breasts of Benedetta. So this whole story of Jesus brought me a new heart turns out to be: Could you possibly touch my breasts? [Laughs.] That\\u2019s the reality, isn\\u2019t it? That\\u2019s what it\\u2019s all about.\", \"Benedetta is both pious and shrewd.\", \"When she got the stigmata, they were so impressed \\u2014 as they say in the movie, Jesus has chosen you because of the wounds he gave you, and therefore we believe that you should become the new abbess. So it\\u2019s clear that the use of stigmata was to get to the position of abbess. And when she becomes an abbess, she gets her own room instead of being in the dormitory, where you can\\u2019t be shy or have an orgasm with somebody else. I interpret her approach as trying to find a location where she could be unobserved with Bartolomea. She is extremely pragmatic. She has this kind of, Yes, I\\u2019m with Jesus and I\\u2019m his bride, and this and that, but she has not lost her view of realism.\", \"You have often been accused of being a provocateur. What are you trying to achieve when making movies?\", \"I see these things and I write, or co-write, and direct them because I think they\\u2019re interesting. But even if I felt that it is provocative, then I would say, especially in the case of \\u201cBenedetta,\\u201d that, yes, perhaps it is provocative, but it\\u2019s the truth, it really happened. I refuse to be afraid of provocation. All that stuff has to do with sexuality, which is at the moment under stress, isn\\u2019t it? I feel, also because of the reactions to the movie, that people are kind of really irritated if there is an emphasis on sexuality.\", \"What do you think of those who question whether sex scenes are even necessary in movies?\", \"Nothing is necessary in movies. [Laughs.] The most important, perhaps the two or three most important things in life, is sexuality. We all do it. The question of why it\\u2019s necessary to show it \\u2014 well, you show life, don\\u2019t you? If the question is: Why show it? The counter question is: Why not show it?\", \"Are you still working on a movie about Jesus?\", \"I am. For a long time I made mistakes and tried to invent too much stuff that was not in the Gospels. I feel that I should be closer to the Gospels but look at them in a different way. I\\u2019m also working with Ed Neumeier, who [co-wrote] \\u201cRoboCop\\u201d and [wrote] \\u201cStarship Troopers,\\u201d on a Washington thriller called \\u201cYoung Sinners.\\u201d The protagonist is a young woman. It\\u2019s a little bit pushed in the future, but not science fiction. It\\u2019s something that is dear to my heart.\", \"That would be your first American film since the science-fiction-ish thriller \\u201cHollow Man\\u201d in 2000. Are you excited at the idea of working here again?\", \"I\\u2019ve been following the politics of the United States so precisely the past 20 years that I feel I know enough to do that movie. I wouldn\\u2019t have dared 20 years ago, but now I think I have as much insight as necessary.\", \"It feels that American politics have caught up to the ruthlessness of the Verhoeven world.\", \"[Laughs.] That might be the attraction.\"]","href_hash":"b2a6f509544d11ec9ed01ffe53d338d9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b2a6f509544d11ec9ed01ffe53d338d9"}},
