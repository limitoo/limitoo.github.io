We\\u2019ll look at the New York City Marathon, which will celebrate its 50th running this weekend with an expected 30,000 people on the starting line. We\\u2019ll also look at the continuing fallout from Election Day in New York and New Jersey.\", \"The New York Marathon started as four laps in Central Park, which in 1970 was \\u201chardly the pastoral jewel that New Yorkers now know and love,\\u201d recalls George Hirsch, a founder of the five-borough marathon and the chairman of New York Road Runners. He remembers that the park \\u201cwas marred by rampant vandalism, drugs were sold openly at Bethesda Fountain and graffiti defaced most of its buildings.\\u201d He says the 127 original starters established an important theme, revival and resilience.\", \"Revival and resilience will be on the runners\\u2019 minds on Sunday, according to my colleague Michael Gold, one of the 30,000 entrants. No matter what happens along the way, it is already clear that the marathon will be an important moment in the city\\u2019s long recovery from the pandemic, with officials eager to prove that New York remains vibrant and ready to welcome back guests \\u2014 and their dollars.\", \"This year\\u2019s field is smaller, with only 30,000 competitors, down from roughly 55,000 in the past. To cut down on crowding in the early minutes on the way to the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge and elsewhere along the 26.2-mile course, the runners will be grouped in five waves. The intervals separating their starts will be longer than before.\", \"The city\\u2019s Landmarks Preservation Commission celebrated the 50th running of the marathon by creating an interactive map of landmarks the runners will see, but don\\u2019t look for some big-name competitors in the race. Some of the top distance runners went elsewhere after three major spring marathons were postponed until fall, packing six major races into six weeks. (One, in Tokyo, was ultimately called off.)\", \"One result? Joyciline Jepkosgei chose London over New York, where she would have defended the championship she won in 2019. She won in London.\", \"As for Michael, he ran a lot during the pandemic, when the gyms were closed. \\u201cI had been running smaller races, and I was supposed to run my second-ever half-marathon on March 15, 2020,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou can guess how that went.\\u201d\", \"The race on Sunday will be his first marathon. I kidded him about whether he runs faster than he writes or writes faster than he runs. We\\u2019ll find out on Sunday, won\\u2019t we? \\u201cI\\u2019m hoping to finish this thing in four hours,\\u201d he told me, though he modestly called that \\u201coptimistic.\\u201d\", \"Prepare to welcome the weekend with a sunny day in the 50s. At night, temps will drop to the high 30s.\", \"In effect until Nov. 11 (Veterans Day).\", \"Before Election Day, the expectation was that women would outnumber men on the next New York City Council.\", \"That was not expected to be the only first. It was also widely thought that Council seats would go to the first Korean American members, the first Muslim woman and the first out L.G.B.T.Q. Black women on Election Day.\", \"Most of that happened on Tuesday, but not exactly as anticipated.\", \"At least two of the women newly elected to the Council were Republicans \\u2014 part of a trend that saw the G.O.P. gain seats for the first time since 2009. Though Democrats cruised to victories in the vast majority of races, Republicans retained the three City Council seats they had held, including one that Democrats had hoped to flip. They also picked up a fourth.\", \"[N.Y. City Council Sees Historic Changes, and Republicans Gain Ground]\", \"And in two races where incumbent Democrats ran cross-party support, they received more votes on the Republican line than on the Democratic one.\", \"Strategists from both parties said that where Council races were competitive, voters were concerned about public safety, a centerpiece of Mayor-elect Eric Adams\\u2019s campaign as the Democratic candidate. Frustration over pandemic guidelines and vaccine mandates also figured in voters\\u2019 choices in Council races, strategists said. So did alienation from the Democratic Party among voters who feel progressives have left them out.\", \"\\u201cThere is a lack of a clear message of what the Democratic Party stands for,\\u201d said Kenneth Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College.\", \"The Council will have a new speaker. The current speaker, Corey Johnson, could not seek another term representing his Manhattan district because of term limits.\", \"One potential contender to succeed him \\u2014 Councilman Justin Brannan, pictured above, a Democrat whose Brooklyn district covers Bath Beach, Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst and Dyker Heights \\u2014 is in a race that had not been called by late Thursday. On election night he was 255 votes behind Brian Fox, a Republican who opposed vaccine mandates. Some 1,456 absentee ballots remain to be counted, about 1,000 from registered Democrats.\", \"Stephen Sweeney has been the second most powerful lawmaker in New Jersey.\", \"His status will change in January. He will no longer be the president of the State Senate \\u2014 or even a senator.\", \"Sweeney, a Democrat, lost his re-election campaign to Edward Durr, a Republican who is a truck driver for the Raymour & Flanagan furniture chain. Durr, who ran for the Assembly in 2017 and 2019 and lost both times, led by 2,298 votes when The Associated Press called the race on Thursday.\", \"[Stephen Sweeney, N.J. Senate President, Loses to Republican Truck Driver]\", \"The outcome in Sweeney\\u2019s race \\u2014 coupled with Gov. Philip Murphy\\u2019s surprisingly narrow win \\u2014 set off a political upheaval in Trenton. Sweeney\\u2019s defeat created a vacuum in the State Legislature, where Sweeney had held the agenda-setting post of senate president for nearly 12 years.\", \"He and Durr could hardly have been more different as candidates. Durr\\u2019s campaign video was shot on a smartphone. He told news outlets that he had spent $153 on the race, although financial disclosure reports put his total at roughly $2,200. And he had to defer celebrating his surprise win because when his victory was announced he was out driving his truck.\", \"Sweeney had unyielding support from the influential building trade unions. But running as an incumbent Democrat when voters were angry about coronavirus restrictions and dysfunction in Washington was enough to erode his once solid standing.\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"My husband and I were on the 14th floor of a building at York Avenue and East 74th Street waiting for a medical appointment.\", \"The place was beautifully furnished and had drop-dead views of the East River. We took a pair of comfy chairs at the south-facing window, looking down onto the F.D.R. Drive and the esplanade.\", \"The river was surging and traffic on the drive was humming, but the esplanade seemed strangely quiet for a summer afternoon. There was not a runner or a cyclist to be seen, only two figures lingering in the shade of a clump of trees. One was in a wheelchair; the other was on a nearby bench. They looked very still, like toy figures.\", \"As we watched, they began to come to life. The person in the wheelchair rolled forward. The person on the bench stood up, then bent down to adjust something.\", \"Was it a hoverboard? It was a hoverboard!\", \"The person on the hoverboard began to push the person in the wheelchair. They headed off down the esplanade together, gathering steam.\", \"We watched them glide away, then sat back down.\", \"\\u2014 Jane Scott\", \"Illustrated by Agnes Lee.
