To an extent, that came true in the 20th century, but orchestras tended to overlook composers of color in favor of white, male ones \\u2014 some of whom would come to be seen as national heroes, while their lesser-known compatriots would rely (and continue to rely) on passionate champions.\", \"And Europeans still haunted concert programming \\u2014 a product, the historian Joseph Horowitz has asserted, of a cultural shift in American classical music from a focus on composers to performers that, fueled by the rise of radio broadcasts and recordings, calcified the repertoire of our largest cultural institutions.\", \"I\\u2019m being reductive, but the broad truth of this is that the myopic approach of much orchestral programming today \\u2014 Eurocentric, with living composers rarely given the same pride of place as a Beethoven or Mahler \\u2014 is nothing new.\", \"Then there are artists like Leon Botstein, an indispensable advocate of the unfairly ignored, who brought his ensemble The Orchestra Now to Carnegie Hall on Thursday for an evening of works that, despite covering a range of nearly 150 years, felt as fresh as a batch of premieres.\", \"Botstein belongs to a class of conductors and artistic directors \\u2014 including Horowitz, as well as Gil Rose of the Boston Modern Orchestra Project, Ashleigh Gordon and Anthony R. Green of Castle of Our Skins, and more \\u2014 who bring an endlessly curious and almost archaeological mind to their programming. They operate on such a small scale, they can hardly reverse the course of American classical music history; but each concert, each recording, is an essential step in a better direction.\", \"On Thursday, Botstein and The Orchestra Now, a capable and game group of young musicians, took the latest of those steps with Julia Perry\\u2019s \\u201cStabat Mater,\\u201d written in 1951, early in that composer\\u2019s short life; Scott Wheeler\\u2019s new violin concerto, \\u201cBirds of America,\\u201d featuring Gil Shaham; and George Frederick Bristow\\u2019s Fourth Symphony, \\u201cArcadian,\\u201d from 1872.\", \"Perry\\u2019s work, an episodic setting of the classic Latin text that has inspired composers for centuries, seems to rise from the depths, awakening slowly with the sounds of gravelly cellos that eventually give away to the brightness of a solo violin and the entrance of the vocalist: here, the mezzo-soprano Briana Hunter, who navigated her part\\u2019s surprising turns and plunges with smooth and characterful ease.\", \"The score, like many American works from the mid-20th century, strikes a balance of dissonance and tonality. With a brief running time and modest scale, it is nonetheless dense, with thick textures emerging from its all-string ensemble and an affecting ambivalence in the final section of instrumental darkness and vocal ecstasy.\", \"Wheeler\\u2019s likable concerto, which the orchestra premiered last weekend at the Fisher Center at Bard College, has elements of timelessness \\u2014 its lyricism akin to that of Barber and Korngold\\u2019s famous violin concertos \\u2014 but also postmodernism, with snippets of classics like Vivaldi\\u2019s \\u201cThe Four Seasons.\\u201d\", \"Despite the avian title, Wheeler doesn\\u2019t emulate birdsong as Messiaen famously did, but he does take inspiration from the calls of distinct voices, with brief, repeated phrases attached to specific instruments \\u2014 such as the whistling runs from a piccolo and flute that open the piece.\", \"Shaham, one of our sunniest violinists, entered accordingly with a singing melody on his highest string, and brought abundant warmth throughout. But he was also grippingly virtuosic in tricky, Sarasate-like passages of lyrical double-stops and left-hand pizzicato. In the finale, he engaged in a musical Simon Says, knocking on the back of his instrument and cuing the second violins to do the same, then setting up col legno tapping in the violas and high-pitched bird calls in the first violins. By the end, the winds joined in to evoke a wondrously bustling aviary.\", \"Without an intermission, Botstein continued with Bristow\\u2019s burly symphony, one of those works that is more heard about than actually heard. But when it premiered, in the midst of 19th-century debates about the direction of American classical music \\u2014 documented, with an analysis of the \\u201cArcadian,\\u201d in the musicologist Douglas W. Shadle\\u2019s revelatory 2015 book \\u201cOrchestrating the Nation\\u201d \\u2014 it enjoyed the rare success of repeated programming.\", \"And on Thursday, you could hear why. With late-Romantic grandeur and American inspiration, the \\u201cArcadian,\\u201d played at Carnegie in a new edition by Kyle Gann, charts an imagined journey westward with a changing musical landscape; a serene pause that conjures communal entertainment with a quote from Tallis\\u2019s \\u201cEvening Hymn\\u201d; a troublingly na\\u00efve and chauvinistic \\u201cIndian War Dance\\u201d that\\u2019s more of a European danse macabre; and a festive celebration upon arrival.\", \"As a document of history, it is an embodiment, ripe for interrogation, of Manifest Destiny\\u2019s sins. But as music, Bristow\\u2019s score holds its own alongside European Romanticism while transparently aiming for a new, more distinct path. He was hardly alone in this effort. There was a moment when New York\\u2019s concert halls resounded with 19th-century American symphonies. It\\u2019s time they did again.\"]","href_hash":"9e5b4280496611ec93b0c5554538cf99"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9e5b4280496611ec93b0c5554538cf99"}},
