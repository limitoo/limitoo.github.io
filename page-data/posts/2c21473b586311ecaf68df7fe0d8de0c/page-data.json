And yes, the group passed the audition.\", \"More than a half-century after the Beatles\\u2019 breakup in 1970, the director Peter Jackson has stitched pieces of dozens of hours of previously unseen footage into a profound, multidimensional creative statement of its own.\", \"One part of the genius of \\u201cGet Back\\u201d is rooted in its depiction of the collaborative creative process, the emergence of a four-of-us road map for innovating on the fly. We see this not only via classic Beatles songs such as \\u201cLet It Be\\u201d and \\u201cThe Long and Winding Road\\u201d coming to life before our eyes and ears, but also in what amounts to a master class in the fragile and fraught art of making magic under intense pressure.\", \"There are many ways to watch Mr. Jackson\\u2019s opus \\u2014 as an intimate glimpse at the dissolution of the greatest rock band of all time; as an epic psychodrama of friendships collapsing; as the settling of the perennial \\u201cbreakup\\u201d debate among hard-core Beatles fans; or as The Guardian put it, as \\u201ceight hours of TV so aimless it threatens your sanity.\\u201d\", \"I chose to watch it as a series of valuable creativity lessons, set to a Beatles soundtrack. Here they are.\", \"Early on in the film, Mr. McCartney struggles to get enthusiastic group buy-in on the quest to come up with 14 new songs within two weeks and record them live for a TV show. Tension among the members and the pressure to achieve this seemingly impossible goal temporarily drive George Harrison from the band.\", \"But thinking big and expansively opens up new creative possibilities. Brainstorming possible venues for the concert, they consider a children\\u2019s hospital, a cruise ship, an amphitheater in Tripoli. None of these ideas stick, but the freewheeling, anything-goes thinking plants the seeds for the epic rooftop performance to come.\", \"Even while bickering in the cavernous Twickenham movie studio before Mr. Harrison\\u2019s departure, the Beatles huddle in the corner as if they\\u2019re back on the tiny stage of the Cavern Club in Liverpool, where they played together before hitting it big.\", \"The longtime friends and bandmates are barely talking, but they\\u2019re playing and singing and riffing off one another\\u2019s ideas. Among the multiple cases in point: \\u201cI\\u2019ve Got a Feeling,\\u201d perhaps the last true Lennon-McCartney composition. As John Lennon later puts it, \\u201cAll we\\u2019ve got is us.\\u201d\", \"When Mr. McCartney comes in hard with the ambitious show goal and tries to step up as the band\\u2019s de facto leader, Mr. Harrison and Mr. Lennon bristle \\u2014 not only over the shifting power dynamic but also because it disrupts that duo\\u2019s evolving free-form way of working.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to carry on until you get there,\\u201d Mr. Harrison tells Mr. McCartney as they struggle through early tries of \\u201cTwo of Us.\\u201d Mr. Lennon becomes a blunt cheerleader: \\u201cI\\u2019d say improvise it, man.\\u201d\", \"Mr. McCartney, tired of being the uptight taskmaster, briefly relaxes and sees the song start to take shape through a jam.\", \"After Mr. Harrison\\u2019s return to the band, the four gather in the cramped basement of Apple Records, having agreed to at least temporarily shelve the TV special idea. There, they jam, joke and loosen up as the numbers they\\u2019ve been working on get tighter.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re working so well together,\\u201d the record producer George Martin remarks to Mr. Harrison. \\u201cYou\\u2019re looking at each other, you\\u2019re seeing each other. It\\u2019s happening, isn\\u2019t it?\\u201d\", \"The arrival of the master keyboardist Billy Preston improves the vibe, the playing and the behavior of the Beatles as a unit. The creative spirit revived by Mr. Preston radiates beyond the band \\u2014 to Yoko Ono\\u2019s impromptu vocalizing and Linda Eastman\\u2019s capturing the sessions in photos, each offering their own brand of inspiration. Ringo Starr goes from behind the drums to the piano to write \\u201cOctopus\\u2019s Garden.\\u201d\", \"The guest appearance is so successful that Mr. Lennon suggests that Mr. Preston be made a Beatle, and Mr. Harrison calls for adding Bob Dylan. Mr. McCartney chooses humor over exasperation in his response: \\u201cIt\\u2019s bad enough with four.\\u201d\", \"Despite their varying levels of engagement during the sessions, the Beatles generally arrive to the studios ready to work, and the sessions are remarkably fertile \\u2014 especially for Mr. McCartney, who turns out \\u201cGet Back\\u201d and \\u201cOh! Darling,\\u201d among other songs. Mr. Harrison brings in \\u201cAll Things Must Pass\\u201d and muses that he\\u2019s written enough songs for a solo album.\", \"Even as wine, beer and more flows, the Beatles stay disciplined, working and reworking lyrics and arrangements until they get them right. \\u201cTo wander aimlessly is very un-swinging,\\u201d Mr. McCartney says. \\u201cUnhip.\\u201d\", \"Watching the umpteenth run-through of \\u201cDon\\u2019t Let Me Down\\u201d may not be everyone\\u2019s cup of English tea. But it\\u2019s the repetition and exhaustive honing of lyrics and musical arrangements that delivered the songs embedded in the musical DNA of generations of fans.\", \"And it\\u2019s the repetition that gives the band the confidence it needs to bring the show to the rooftop. Up there, they gave it their all for 42 minutes, until the police ended a performance for the ages.\", \"One thing is clear from \\u201cGet Back\\u201d: The Beatles didn\\u2019t want all that they\\u2019d built to end. But they knew things would have to change to move forward. The documentary allows us to watch the struggle of four men, all still in their 20s, trying to grow up, yet not grow apart, creatively and otherwise.\", \"In a moment when it\\u2019s unclear whether Mr. Harrison will return, Mr. McCartney comforts himself with a daydream about the four friends coming together again, many years from now. \\u201cProbably when we\\u2019re all very old, we\\u2019ll all agree with each other and we\\u2019ll all sing together,\\u201d he tells Mr. Lennon.\", \"That, sadly, didn\\u2019t come to pass. But thanks to Mr. Jackson\\u2019s masterpiece, we can watch the band play together again, offering an inspirational peek into what made the Beatles the greatest pop-culture creative force of them all.\"]","href_hash":"2c21473b586311ecaf68df7fe0d8de0c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2c21473b586311ecaf68df7fe0d8de0c"}},
