that he interrogated the missing boy's foster-parents and placed a listening device in their car before they were ruled out as suspects.\", \"During an interview with 2GB radio, the former detective said he had interrogated, formally interviewed and released the foster-parents, with a \\\"covert operation running\\\" which involved placing a bug in their car to listen in on\\u00a0their conversations.\", \"\\\"Based on the answers to those questions and also the information that we gathered during the covert operation, they were again eliminated,\\\" he said.\", \"Mr Jubelin headed the William Tyrrell investigation from early 2015 until he was removed from the case in March, 2019.\", \"He resigned from the police force shortly afterwards.\", \"<img

the handover that the foster-parents had been ruled out of any involvement.\", \"About 18 months into the investigation, some members of the police strike force suggested there was evidence that needed to be clarified with the foster-parents.\", \"Mr Jubelin said he wasn't \\\"overly concerned\\\" but wanted to make sure every angle was covered.\", \"That was when he formally interviewed the couple.\", \"\\\"I went hard on them,\\\" he said.\", \"One line of questioning was the foster-mother's account that William had been wearing shoes at the time of his disappearance when photographs taken shortly before showed him barefoot.\", \"\\\"The answer was that the shoes weren't on William at the time of the photo but William was capable of putting his shoes on,\\\" he said.\", \"Mr Jubelin said the conclusion reached by police\\u00a0was that the foster-parents were not involved in the disappearance.\", \"\\\"At the time\\u00a0I was taken off the investigation, there was
