Citing geospatial intelligence company AllSource Analysis, it said that the region has previously been used for ballistic missile testing.\", \"\\\"The mockups of several probable U.S. warships, along with other warships (mounted on rails and mobile), could simulate targets related to seeking/target acquisition testing,\\\" the U.S. Naval Institute said.\", \"\\\"This, and the extensive detail of the mockups, including the placement of multiple sensors on and around the vessel targets, it is probable that this area is intended for multiple uses over time,\\\" it added.\", \"Responding to the matter during a press conference on Monday, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said that he is \\\"not aware of the situation,\\\" The Associated Press reported.\", \"It comes amid growing tensions between Washington and Beijing, particularly as President Joe Biden makes the Indo-Pacific a focus of his administration. In July, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned China against engaging in \\\"provocative behaviour\\\" in the South China Sea.\", \"The status of Taiwan has also been a major point of growing contention between the two nations. The Chinese communist regime claims Taiwan as a province of China, although the self-ruled island has its own constitution, democratically-elected government and military.\", \"In recent weeks, Beijing has ramped up military harassment against Taiwan, including flying its military over the island's air defense zone.
