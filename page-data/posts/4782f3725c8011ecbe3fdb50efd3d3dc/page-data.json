Morris, a former government official, banker and self-taught historian of economics who as a prolific, iconoclastic author challenged conventional political and economic pieties, died on Monday in Hampton, N.H. He was 82.\", \"The cause was complications of dementia, his daughter, Kathleen Morris, said.\", \"Mr. Morris wrote his signature first book, \\u201cThe Cost of Good Intentions: New York City and the Liberal Experiment\\u201d (1980), after serving as director of welfare programs under Mayor John V. Lindsay and as secretary of social and health services in Washington State.\", \"The book was a trenchant Emperor\\u2019s New Clothes analysis of how the Lindsay administration\\u2019s unfettered investment in social welfare programs to ward off civil unrest had delivered the city to the brink of bankruptcy, and it pigeonholed Mr. Morris as a neoconservative.\", \"But as a law school graduate with no formal training in economics, he defied facile labeling.\", \"While his 15 nonfiction books often revisited well-trodden topics \\u2014 including the Great Depression, the nation\\u2019s tycoons, the cost of health care, the Cold War arms race and the political evolution of the Roman Catholic church \\u2014 he injected them with revealing details, provocative insights and fluid narratives.\", \"\\u201cThe Cost of Good Intentions\\u201d (1981) was less a screed about liberal profligacy as it was an expression of disappointment that benevolent officials had become wedded to programs that didn\\u2019t work. He concluded that the best and the brightest in the government, as well as complicit players on the outside, had figured that if a day of reckoning ever came, it would not be on their watch.\", \"Steven R. Weisman wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Mr. Morris, as a former city budget official and, at the time, as a vice president for international finance at Chase Manhattan Bank, was more intent on adding perspective than affixing blame.\", \"\\u201cHe exonerates neither his current nor his former employer,\\u201d Mr. Weisman wrote.\", \"In the book, Mr. Morris quoted Peter Goldmark Jr., then the state budget director, as saying: \\u201cRemember the 14th century and the advent of the plague? Was it possible for those people to stand on the docks in Genoa or Venice, watch the rats pouring off the ships, and not understand?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYes,\\u201d Mr. Morris wrote dubiously, \\u201cit was possible.\\u201d\", \"He would also belie Thomas Carlyle\\u2019s characterization of economics as \\u201cthe dismal science\\u201d by injecting tantalizing nuggets.\", \"Reviewing Mr. Morris\\u2019s \\u201cA Time of Passion: America 1960-1980\\u201d (1984) for The Times Book Review, Michael Kinsley wrote that \\u201csome of the most vivid moments in this book come when he stops the rush of history to describe incidents from his own time as a poverty-program and prison administrator.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe truly has been \\u2018mugged by reality,\\u2019 in Irving Kristol\\u2019s famous definition of a neoconservative,\\u201d Mr. Kinsley added, but concluded, \\u201cOverall, his book radiates a generosity and good will that set it apart from the typically sour neoconservative creed.\\u201d\", \"Charles Richard Morris was born on Oct. 23, 1939, in Oakland, Calif., to Charles B. and Mildred (Reid) Morris. His father was a technician for a printing ink manufacturer; his mother was a homemaker.\", \"After attending Mother of the Savior Seminary in Blackwood, N.J., Mr. Morris graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a degree in journalism in 1963. He was director of the New Jersey Office of Economic Opportunity from 1965 to 1969.\", \"He earned a degree from the university\\u2019s law school in 1972 while working for New York City government. He was recruited by Washington State on the basis of his reputation as the city\\u2019s assistant budget director and welfare director.\", \"Praising Mr. Morris\\u2019s service to the city and his proficiency as an author, Edward K. Hamilton, first deputy mayor during the Lindsay administration, said that he nonetheless differed with some of the conclusions and recommendations in \\u201cThe Cost of Good Intentions.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMany of its stated or implied remedial nostrums, even if desirable in theory, were simply infeasible in the real-world circumstances,\\u201d Mr. Hamilton said, \\u201cgiven the complex web of intersecting state, local and federal authorities and the politics overshadowing all of it.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Morris later served as director of the Vera Institute of Justice in London.\", \"He is survived by his wife, Beverly Gilligan Morris, along with their sons, Michael and Matthew; their daughter, Kathleen Morris; and four grandchildren. A sister, Marianne Donovan, also died on Monday. Mr. Morris lived in Hampton.\", \"Among his other books were \\u201cA Rabble of Dead Money: The Great Crash and the Global Depression: 1929-1939 (2017); \\u201cComeback: America's New Economic Boom\\u201d (2013); \\u201cThe Sages: Warren Buffett, George Soros, Paul Volcker, and the Maelstrom of Markets\\u201d (2009); \\u201cThe Trillion Dollar Meltdown\\u201d (2008); \\u201cThe Surgeons: Life and Death in a Top Heart Center (2007),\\u201d which dissects the cost of care to the public and to practitioners; \\u201cAmerican Catholic: The Saints and Sinners Who Built America's Most Powerful Church\\u201d (1997); and \\u201cThe Tycoons: How Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Jay Gould, and J.P. Morgan Invented the American Supereconomy\\u201d (2005).\", \"Assessing \\u201cThe Tycoons\\u201d in The Times Book Review, Todd G. Buchholz, a former economics adviser to President George H.W. Bush, wrote of Mr. Morris, \\u201cI admired his drive to delve into competing theories of the Great Depression, sleeves rolled up, digging evenhandedly into the muck of academic research and the tumbleweed of the Dust Bowl.\\u201d\", \"Rarely allowing himself to be typecast, Mr. Morris would debunk what he called the conservative conventional wisdom that raising the minimum wage costs jobs. He complained in the Jesuit magazine America that the nation\\u2019s existing health care system benefits the wealthiest Americans. In an interview on the business blog bobmorris.biz in 2012, he criticized graduate schools of business.\", \"\\u201cBusiness schools tend to focus on topics that are suitable to blackboards, so they overemphasize organization and finance,\\u201d Mr. Morris said. \\u201cUntil very recently, they virtually ignored manufacturing. I think a lot of the troubles of the 1970s and 1980s, and now more recently the 2000s, can be traced pretty directly to the biases of the business schools.\\u201d\", \"In \\u201cThe Trillion Dollar Meltdown: Easy Money, High Rollers and the Great Credit Crash\\u201d (2008), which won the Gerald Loeb Award for business reporting, Mr. Morris precisely predicted the collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns and the ensuing global recession.\", \"He wrote the book in 2007, when most experts were still expressing optimism about the economy. He also appeared in the Oscar-winning documentary \\u201cInside Job\\u201d (2010) about the 2008 financial crisis.\", \"\\u201cI think we\\u2019re heading for the mother of all crashes,\\u201d Mr. Morris wrote his publisher, Peter Osnos, the founder of Public Affairs books, early in 2007, adding, \\u201cIt will happen in summer of 2008, I think.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Osnos recalled that after the book was published, \\u201cGeorge Soros and Paul Volcker called me and asked, \\u2018Who is this Morris, and how did he get this so right, so early?\\u2019\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4782f3725c8011ecbe3fdb50efd3d3dc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4782f3725c8011ecbe3fdb50efd3d3dc"}},
