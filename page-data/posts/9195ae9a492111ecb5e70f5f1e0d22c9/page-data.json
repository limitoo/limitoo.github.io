So upbeat that it apparently is cool with the fact that in three Senate races \\u2014 Georgia, Missouri and Pennsylvania \\u2014 it has leading candidates who have been accused of harassing, abusing, threatening or otherwise mistreating women.\", \"Once upon a time, this situation likely would have provoked a major display of concern, or at least an attempt at damage control, by the Republican establishment. Instead many party officials are brushing off related questions like pesky bits of dryer fluff.\", \"While the particulars of these cases vary \\u2014 the allegations, the candidates\\u2019 responses, the warmth of the party\\u2019s embrace \\u2014 the creeping not-so-casual misogyny is indicative of the dark path down which former President Donald Trump continues to lead the G.O.P.\", \"It is not simply that Mr. Trump has long worn his shabby treatment of women like a perverse merit badge \\u2014 a symbol of how the rules of decent society do not apply to him. He also has made the Republican Party a welcoming place for other like-minded men. As president, rarely did he confront a harassment or abuse scandal in which he didn\\u2019t make clear his sympathies for the accused and his skepticism of the accusers. Pity the poor harasser. So misunderstood. So persecuted by humorless prigs. It almost takes the fun out of groping random chicks.\", \"In Georgia, Herschel Walker, the former N.F.L. star, has been accused of a host of erratic and frightening behavior, including threatening his ex-wife\\u2019s life while pointing a gun to her head. Some episodes he has denied. Others he has chalked up to his struggle with mental illness, about which he wrote a book in 2008. (He credits therapy and Christianity with saving him.) In September, Mr. Trump endorsed Mr. Walker. Party leaders, including Mitch McConnell, are probably hoping that Mr. Walker\\u2019s violent history won\\u2019t much bother voters, or better yet, that it will play as an inspiring redemption story.\", \"In Missouri, Eric Greitens is hoping for political vindication after stepping down as governor in 2018 amid a swirl of scandal. His bad behavior allegedly included threatening a woman with whom he\\u2019d had an affair to keep her trap shut about it or else he\\u2019d make public an explicit photo of her that he\\u2019d snapped without her permission.\", \"Mr. Greitens is still in hot pursuit of Mr. Trump\\u2019s endorsement, but he already has a number of Trumpworld stars in his corner. The Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio has signed on with the campaign, and Kimberly Guilfoyle, a former Trump campaign aide and Don Jr.\\u2019s girlfriend, is its national chair. Bernard Kerik, the former New York City police commissioner, and Rudy Giuliani, who at this point defies meaningful description, have stumped in the state for Mr. Greitens. Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump\\u2019s disgraced national security adviser, has given his endorsement.\", \"Finally, in Pennsylvania, Sean Parnell is neck-deep in a custody battle with his estranged wife, who has testified that he verbally and physically abused her and their children. He has flatly denied all accusations.\", \"Mr. Parnell was endorsed by Mr. Trump shortly before the controversy erupted. Other party leaders have been loath to comment on the unfolding drama. Asked recently whether, in light of the hubbub, Mr. Parnell was the right man to be the nominee, Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, insisted it was inappropriate for him to take sides in a primary. \\u201cWe have Republican and Democrat primaries across the country and in Pennsylvania, we have \\u2014 both Republicans and Democrats have primaries, and so we\\u2019ll see who comes out of the primary,\\u201d he told CNN.\", \"Impressive moral leadership.\", \"Republican officials are in a tough spot. Accusations of sexual misconduct or domestic violence are not necessarily disqualifying in the party of Trump. In some cases, they can be dismissed as lies \\u2014 Mr. Trump\\u2019s preferred approach \\u2014 a nefarious attack by haters. Bad behavior that is indisputable can always be pooh-poohed as unfortunate but of secondary importance within the larger battle against radical leftists.\", \"For devout Trumpists, accusations of toxic masculinity can even be a comfort of sorts, a kind of corrective to a #MeToo movement that many in the MAGAverse consider excessive and anti-man. Remember when two White House aides resigned over accusations of domestic violence in early 2018? Mr. Trump popped up on Twitter to whine, \\u201cPeoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation.\\u201d Later, during the Brett Kavanaugh hubbub, Mr. Trump bemoaned what a \\u201cscary\\u201d and \\u201cdifficult\\u201d time it was to be a young man in America.\", \"The rot goes beyond the disrespect and mistreatment of women. Under Mr. Trump, the Republican Party has undergone a fundamental shift, swapping a fixation on character and morality and so-called Family Values for a celebration of belligerence, violence, and, yes, toxic masculinity. Greg Gianforte won his 2017 House race after \\u201cbody slamming\\u201d a reporter who asked an unwelcome question. Charged with assault and sentenced to anger management classes and community service, Mr. Gianforte was praised by Mr. Trump as \\u201cmy kind of guy\\u201d for his violent display. Last year, Montanans elected him governor.\", \"This tendency is not restricted to the G.O.P.\\u2019s men. Just look at the way MAGA extremists like Representatives Lauren Boebert and Marjorie Taylor Greene play up their swaggering, gun-toting images to the delight of the base. Before arriving in Congress, Ms. Greene got her kicks indulging social media fantasies about killing Democratic leaders.\", \"Speaking of that, just this week, Representative Paul Gosar of Arizona, a 62-year-old former dentist desperate to be known as a MAGA butt-kicker, got himself censured and stripped of committee assignments for posting an animated video depicting him slashing the throat of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York progressive. All but two of his Republican colleagues stuck by him. Ms. Boebert took to the House floor to deliver a barn-burning defense.\", \"Whatever the misconduct of individual Republicans, the larger scandal is in the party\\u2019s collective group shrug.\", \"When a party prizes thuggishness, it becomes harder and harder to figure out where to draw the line. The slope is not merely getting slipperier. It\\u2019s getting steeper.\"]","href_hash":"9195ae9a492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9195ae9a492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}},
