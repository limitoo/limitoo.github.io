That means, that whichever of these things prove to be true, the discovery is an important one for astrophysics.\", \"\\\"Theoretical knowledge about galaxy formation means we'd expect to see many more little galaxies orbiting the Triangulum galaxy, M33. However, so far it only has one known satellite,\\\" University of Surrey Ph.D. student, Emily Charles, who worked on the investigation, said. \\\"If this newly identified galaxy does belong to M33, it might imply that there are many more that haven't been uncovered yet as they are too faint to show up in previous surveys of the system.\", \"\\\"M33 currently challenges astrophysicists' assumptions, but this new finding starts reassuring us that our theories are correct.\\\"\", \"The team, whose findings are published in the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, will now attempt to accurately measure the distance to Pisces VII/ Tri III, to assess if how it is moving in relation to M33.\", \"This investigation, which will require further imaging with other telescopes, will tell them if the new dwarf galaxy is a field galaxy or a satellite of M33. Settling this will also help settle on which name the dwarf galaxy keeps, Pisces VII if it wanders the Universe alone, Tri III if it forms part of the larger M33/Triangulum galaxy.\", \"M33 is itself a satellite galaxy, the largest belonging to the Andromeda galaxy. A spiral galaxy like the Milky Way, M33 is also one of the most massive galaxies in the local group also containing our galaxy. With a diameter of around 52,000 light-years, M33 is still only around half the size of the Milky Way, however.\", \"\\\"Deep imaging from Hubble would allow us to reach fainter stars which act as more robust distance estimators, as they have a standard brightness,\\\" team member and University of Surrey Ph.D. student Noushin Karim, said. \\\"To confirm the new galaxy's movement, we need imaging from an 8m or 10m telescope, like Keck or Gemini.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936264/messier-33-triangulum-galaxy.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Triangulum galaxy Messier 33(M33).
