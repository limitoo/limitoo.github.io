He called the Supreme Court's decision to not block the law \\\"an unprecedented assault\\\" on women's rights. \", \"Earlier this week, the justice department announced it would protect Texas clinics that performed abortions.\", \"SB8 bans abortions following the detection of what anti-abortion activists call a foetal heartbeat. \", \"The American College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists has said the term is misleading and what is being detected at such an early stage of pregnancy is a portion of foetal tissue \\\"that will become the heart as the embryo develops\\\".\", \"The law also gives individuals the right to sue anyone who provides or facilitates access to an abortion past the six-week point. It does not allow the women who get the procedure to be sued. \", \"People who successfully sue under the law will be awarded at least $10,000 (\\u00a37,200), in addition to any legal fees incurred. \", \"Critics, like the American Civil Liberties Union, have said that this leaves the responsibility for enforcing it on individuals, rather than local or state officials, and could give rise to abortion \\\"bounty hunters\\\".\", \"Texas' Republican Governor Greg Abbott has defended the law, vowing that his state will \\\"always defend the right to life\\\".\", \"Officials in several other US states have said they are considering similar laws. \", \"In Florida, state Senate leader Wilton Simpson told reporters that the ban has \\\"encouraged\\\" local politicians, who are \\\"already working\\\" on a similar bill.
