She'll have to travel about an hour to an Amarillo hospital 60 miles away to deliver her baby.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We had a close call with my son, so it is a little nerve-racking thinking about the next one,\\\" she told CBS News.\\u00a0\", \"More than 2 million women in the U.S. live in counties with no access to prenatal care or obstetricians, what's known as maternity care deserts, according to the March of Dimes. Millions more live in areas where medical support is extremely limited.\\u00a0\", \"Fewer than half of rural Texas hospitals deliver babies. A shortage of nurses heightened by the COVID pandemic has been one of the biggest factors in the decline of maternity wards, though cost is also an issue.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"A lot of rural hospitals are getting out of delivering babies.
