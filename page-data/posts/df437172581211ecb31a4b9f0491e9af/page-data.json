They\\u2019re organized only by the order in which I read them.\", \"There\\u2019s so much vast, sprawling, protean wonder between its covers that \\u201cThe Absolute Book\\u201d could be a fantasy object in and of itself. What begins as domestic realism, exploring Taryn Cornick\\u2019s grief at the sudden, violent loss of her sister, spirals into thriller territory before tumbling into epic fantasy. Spanning the geographies of Canada, Britain and New Zealand and the cosmologies of fairies, demons and angels, the novel more than lives up to its name.\", \"A tremendous and devastating work of witness, stunning and perfect. Firuzeh and Nour are siblings fleeing Afghanistan for Australia, enduring the hazards of crossing borders and oceans with only their parents\\u2019 love and folk tales to protect them. But when those stories wither in the misery of Nauru\\u2019s Regional Processing Center, the ghost of a drowned girl becomes Firuzeh\\u2019s closest companion, for better or for worse.\", \"A slender, extraordinary jewel of a book, like a scrimshawed murder ballad tucked into a timepiece. Dora and Thistle are siblings by choice and circumstance, trapped in a viciously cruel fairyland where immortal creatures torture stolen children for sport. But when an antique watch finds its way into their hidden wood, distorting the fairy world with the arrival of time, the children seize their chance to escape into even stranger stories.\", \"A magnificent love song shouted to queer lineage, found family, Brooklyn and one\\u2019s early 20s. August Landry is an angry, cynical loner, raised in New Orleans by a bereaved mother to trust no one and keep to herself. She moves to New York for college, but just as she\\u2019s figuring out the city\\u2019s rhythms, she meets Jane Su: gorgeous, badass, amnesiac \\u2014 and trapped on the Q train since 1976.\", \"Solomon\\u2019s most powerful work yet. Vern, a pregnant Black teenager, escapes the secretive compound of the cult she was raised in and gives birth to twins in the woods. Thriving there despite a sinister presence she calls \\u201cthe fiend,\\u201d Vern becomes aware of something else growing in her body, unsettling its rhythms and forcing her to take her children on a long, difficult journey in search of support. Like its heroine, \\u201cSorrowland\\u201d refuses comforting half-truths in favor of furious integrity.\", \"Dr. Elsa Park spent years being told that the women of her family are trapped in the patterns of tragic Korean folk tales in which girls are stolen, sacrificed, haunted or haunting. As an adult, Elsa chooses science over superstition \\u2014 but while researching neutrinos in Antarctica, she succumbs to an old hallucination of ringing bells and sees a lovely woman with red ribbons in her hair out on the ice. Haunted now herself, Elsa struggles to find a way into \\u2014 and more crucially, a way out of \\u2014 her family\\u2019s tales.\", \"A staggering, action-packed marvel set on a doomed generation ship the size of Switzerland. There\\u2019s a crack in the hull, widening, irreparable and kept secret; Myrra Dal, an indentured nanny, finds this out when her employers kill themselves, and does the only thing that makes sense to her: She takes the baby and runs.\", \"Timeless and original, blending noir, cyberpunk and sports. Though set in a disturbingly near future of extreme climate change and runaway medical debt occasioned by the gene therapies and cybernetic enhancements required to live, \\u201cThe Body Scout\\u201d is mostly about baseball, family and doing the right thing even when it hurts (or risks getting your body parts repossessed).\", \"Intimate and intricate, full of charismatic monsters and the dueling secret societies to which they belong. A pack of werewolves transform on camera, prompting hidden powers to rally for or against revealing the supernatural world of gods and monsters to the public. Mysteriously narrated and utterly riveting.\", \"Lynesse is the fourth daughter of a queen: a minor royal with no purpose or prospects, living in a world of magic, demons, sorcery. Nyr is a scientist from another planet, isolated and alone, part of an abandoned anthropological survey gone wrong hundreds of years ago. Together, they\\u2019ll fight crime. An utter delight from start to finish, beautifully written and perfectly paced.\"]","href_hash":"df437172581211ecb31a4b9f0491e9af"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"df437172581211ecb31a4b9f0491e9af"}},
