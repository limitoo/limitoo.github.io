In this case, people who filed early in the tax season \\u2014 which began January 24 \\u2014 and claimed either of the tax credits are likely to receive their refund checks on March 1, the IRS said last week.\", \"But the agency noted that only goes for taxpayers who also meet three other requirements \\u2014 those who file electronically, choose to get their refund by direct deposit and are not identified by the IRS as having a problem on their returns.\", \"Taxpayers claiming one or both of the tax credits but who ask for paper checks, even if they filed electronically, may have to wait an additional several days for the money to show up in the mail. Even with direct deposit, a check can take an additional day or two to clear and land in a personal bank account.\\u00a0\", \"More than 30 million families claim the Child Tax Credit (CTC), and about 25 million people claim the Earned Income Tax Credit.\\u00a0\", \"With three in four taxpayers typically receiving refund checks every year, the money represents an important windfall that households rely on to pay bills, save or whittle down debt. This year, consumers are worried about the timing and size of the refunds, given a massive backlog of returns at the IRS and challenges in handling last year's tax returns, as well as changes to the tax code that could impact refunds.\\u00a0\", \"Taxpayers can check the status of their tax return, as well as their refund, at the IRS site \\\"Where's My Refund?\\\" To use the tool, people must provide their Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, their filing status (such as married filing jointly) and their exact refund amount.\", \"The IRS says people can start checking on their refund within 24 hours after an electronically filed return is received by the agency, or four weeks after mailing a paper return.

One reason is due to the CTC, which was expanded in 2021 and which advanced half of the credit through monthly checks last year. As a result, families will claim a smaller amount for the child credit on their tax returns, which could lower their tax refund.\", \"The size of the typical refund is increasing as the tax season progresses, according to IRS data. As of February 11, the average refund was about $2,300, but that has jumped to almost $3,600 for the week ended February 18.\\u00a0\", \"Last year, the average refund was about $2,800.
