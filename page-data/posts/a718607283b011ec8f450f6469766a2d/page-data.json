She also vomited over the weekend, she said, possibly because of the antiviral medication.\", \"She said her eye was much improved and that she was \\u201cfeeling better,\\u201d though she still felt \\u201cqueasy.\\u201d\", \"She said she was awaiting the results of a blood test for monkey-borne diseases and was grateful for advice she had been receiving from Dr. Lisa Jones-Engel, a primate scientist who works with People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, which has long opposed primate research and has asked two federal agencies to investigate the crash.\", \"Ms. Fallon said she was driving home on Jan. 21 in Montour County, about 150 miles northwest of Philadelphia, when she saw the crash, in which a dump truck hit a pickup truck that was hauling a trailer with the macaques. The monkeys had arrived at Kennedy International Airport in New York and were on their way to a quarantine facility.\", \"Ms. Fallon stopped to see if anyone was hurt and found crates strewn across the roadway.\", \"Told by a bystander that cats might be inside, she stuck her finger in one and saw brown fur. When the animal made a \\u201cweird noise,\\u201d she put her face closer to get a better look. That\\u2019s when, she said, she noticed that it wasn\\u2019t a cat but a monkey, which \\u201chissed\\u201d at her. She said she felt a mist.\", \"She also stepped in monkey feces, she said.\", \"That night, she went to a party with people who later tested positive for the coronavirus, she said. Ms. Fallon said that while she herself had tested negative, the series of events added up to \\u201cthe worst day of my life.\\u201d\", \"Three of the monkeys escaped after the crash, but were quickly found and \\u201chumanely euthanized,\\u201d the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said, without offering further details.\", \"The C.D.C. referred questions about Ms. Fallon\\u2019s condition to the Pennsylvania Department of Health and her doctor, saying it does \\u201cnot provide clinical care for individuals.\\u201d\", \"Barry Ciccocioppo, a spokesman for the Department of Health, said in an email: \\u201cIt is not known if that individual\\u2019s medical condition is related.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe take any report of exposure to these nonhuman primates very seriously,\\u201d Mr. Ciccocioppo said. \\u201cThe Department of Health recommends that anyone who thinks they may have been exposed to a nonhuman primate to contact their health care provider.\\u201d The doctor can then consult with the department about the risks and best course of treatment, he said.\", \"Ms. Fallon\\u2019s doctor\\u2019s office referred questions to the Geisinger health system, which did not immediately respond to an email and phone call.\", \"In a letter issued to the authorities after the crash, the C.DC. said that anyone who was within five feet of the monkeys\\u2019 crates without respiratory and eye protection should monitor themselves for signs of illness such as fever, fatigue, cough, diarrhea and vomiting.\", \"The letter noted that monkeys and humans are naturally susceptible to many of the same diseases. It said the surviving monkeys would be quarantined and monitored for infectious diseases for at least 31 days.\", \"Mr. Ciccocioppo described the letter as \\u201cprecautionary and a form letter used in such incidents.\\u201d\", \"Michael L. Kull, the chief of the Valley Township Fire Department, said that he and other emergency personnel who responded to the crash did not get close enough to the monkeys to risk any kind of infection.\", \"\\u201cOut of an abundance of caution, we will be careful,\\u201d he said, but added he was unconcerned. \\u201cI have lost no sleep.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Christine Petersen, director of the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases at the University of Iowa, said serious diseases like monkey pox and Ebola are rare in cynomolgus macaques, but that \\u201cprecaution should be taken\\u201d by anyone who may have come into contact with one.\", \"\\u201cA cornered monkey is not the kindest of creatures,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIf they did get bitten or spit on, that\\u2019s worrisome.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBut what are the odds that any three random monkeys could somehow spread something dastardly to a first responder?\\u201d Dr. Petersen added. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not high.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Suresh V. Kuchipudi, a clinical professor in the department of veterinary and biomedical sciences at Pennsylvania State University, said that so long as someone who has been too close to a wild animal like a macaque is receiving treatment for any infection, the risk of it spreading to other people is low.\", \"Public health concerns were not the only fallout from the crash.\", \"After PETA contacted Kenya Airways, the company said last week that it would not renew its contract for the transportation of macaques when it expires this month. In doing so, it joined several airlines, including major American carriers, that have refused to transport animals used in medical research.\", \"PETA claimed victory in a news release. It has also asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Transportation to investigate the crash, warning of a dangerous lack of oversight for the transportation of primates.\", \"\\u201cU.S. laboratories haven\\u2019t been able to prevent tuberculosis, cholera, campylobacteriosis, Chagas\\u2019 disease or other deadly pathogens from infecting the monkeys they cage and experiment on,\\u201d Dr. Jones-Engel said in a statement, \\u201cand they still put these monkeys on trucks that travel our highways nationwide.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a718607283b011ec8f450f6469766a2d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a718607283b011ec8f450f6469766a2d"}},
