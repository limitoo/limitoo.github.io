However, in September a grand jury indicted the officers along with two paramedics on manslaughter and other charges after Governor Jared Polis ordered Attorney General Phil Weiser to conduct an investigation into the incident.\", \"Tuesday, Weiser and Aurora officials announced a set of reforms after an investigation by Weiser's office uncovered a pattern of racially biased policing, including the use of excessive force. A monitor to oversee whether the reforms are followed and milestones are met over the next five years is still yet to be hired.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937036/elijah-mcclain-aurora-colorado-police-brutality.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Denver suburb of Aurora has agreed to pay $15 million to settle a lawsuit brought by the parents of Elijah McClain.

It found there was no evidence justifying officers' decision to stop McClain, who had been reported as suspicious because he was wearing a ski mask as he walked down the street waving his hands. He had not been accused of breaking any law.\", \"One of the three officers who arrested McClain was fired last year, but not for stopping him. Jason Rosenblatt lost his job for responding \\\"ha ha\\\" to a photo taken by other former officers reenacting the neckhold at a memorial to McClain.\", \"Aurora police have been plagued by other allegations of misconduct against people of color.\", \"Last year, the department came under fire for handcuffing four Black girls who were held face down in a parking lot in a mix-up over a stolen car. Prosecutors said officers committed no crime.\", \"This summer, an officer shown on body camera footage beating a Black man with his gun was charged with assault and resigned. Police Chief Vanessa Wilson, who took over the department last year amid the increased attention on McClain's death, quickly denounced the officer's actions, calling it a \\\"very despicable act.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937037/elijah-mcclain-aurora-colorado-police-brutality.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A judge in Aurora, Colorado announced Friday the city will pay a $15 million settlement to the family of Elijah McClain, who was killed by police in 2019.
