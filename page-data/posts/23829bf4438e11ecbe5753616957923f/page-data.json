\"This year's 11.11 global shopping festival, known as the Singles' Day event in China, generated $115.8 billion\\u00a0in sales during Chinese technology-giant\\u00a0Alibaba's\\u00a011-day campaign.\", \"But year-on-year sales growth\\u00a0fell to 8.5 per cent \\u2014 its slowest since the festival began in 2009.\", \"Millions of Chinese consumers, who had piled up products in their digital carts across almost\\u00a0500\\u00a0online shopping platforms, rushed to check out their orders as the clock ticked past\\u00a0midnight into\\u00a0Thursday,\\u00a0the main day of the event.\", \"\\\"This year\\u2019s festival is one of the largest opportunities for Australian businesses to reach consumers in China,\\u201d says Maggie Zhou, managing director of Alibaba Group, Australia and New Zealand.\", \"\\\"With the festival now in its 13th year \\u2026\\u00a0more than 900 million consumers across China and more than 290,000 merchants and brands join in the campaign.\\\"\", \"Despite the huge number of shoppers, there were none of the usual\\u00a0rolling tallies or triumphant comments by executives from major platforms as the e-commerce sector continues to maintain\\u00a0a lower profile amid a government crackdown on platforms like\\u00a0Alibaba.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Australian\\u00a0products as popular as ever</div>\", \"<img

product categories sought by Chinese consumers.\", \"But even before Singles' Day, Australian products were already the most popular among foreign brands on Alibaba's e-commerce platforms in September.\", \"It was\\u00a0followed by the United States, Japan, Germany and Canada.\", \"The Common Good Group (TCGG), a company that helps Australian brands\\u00a0reach Chinese consumers via China's cross border e-commerce\\u00a0platforms, said\\u00a0vitamins and minerals made up\\u00a0a major chunk of Alibaba's sales figures during Singles' Day.\", \"Similarly, Australian beauty supplements, probiotics and products for gut and immune health were also extremely popular\\u00a0in China.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"There's obvious\\u00a0issues with Australia and China from a political perspective,\\\"\\u00a0Jeremy Hunt, TCGG's CEO and daigou expert, told the ABC.\", \"\\\"But at a person-to-person level, Chinese consumers don't care where their\\u00a0[products] come from, because

seen a huge shift in their sales channels\\u00a0due to\\u00a0the very limited number of\\u00a0planes and ships going into China during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"What that meant was brands had to change how they targeted and sold their products,\\\" Mr Hunt said.\", \"\\\"Instead of going through the retail channel or daigou channel, they had to go direct to China.\\\"\", \"Daigou shoppers, who buy domestic products in Australia on behalf of their customers in China, had created\\u00a0a multi-billion-dollar economic backchannel\\u00a0over recent years, integrating retail, marketing, and logistics services across Australia.\", \"The\\u00a0controversial practice created huge awareness of Australian brands\\u00a0in China, which Mr Hunt said had led to many Australian\\u00a0companies opting to open official stores on Chinese e-commerce platforms.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/bc20e313301fbfedc3868c251623ed53\\\"

daigou, such as customers waiting months for their parcels\\u00a0after they had been sent from Australia.\", \"With the delay in parcels clearing Chinese ports, even many of her regular customers have lost confidence.\", \"\\\"And the media in China is really promoting the concept that Chinese people should buy Chinese products,\\u00a0instead of buying imported goods.\\\"\", \"She also said at least 50 per cent of her customers had cancelled their regular orders and turned to domestic brands in China, because of fears of contracting COVID-19 from parcels.\", \"China has urged its ports to minimise the risk of coronavirus transmission after it reportedly found cases linked to contaminated frozen food packaging from overseas, which has hampered\\u00a0public\\u00a0confidence in foreign products.\", \"Even though there was still demand\\u00a0from Chinese consumers, the lockdowns in Melbourne and Sydney, as well as Australia's border restrictions that blocked tourists and
