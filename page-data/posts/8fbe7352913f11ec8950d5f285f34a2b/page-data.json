Both former officers are white.\", \"Daunte Wright's mother Katie Wright expressed anger that Chu was emotional in delivering the sentence but not during Wright's victim-impact statement in court on Friday. She blasted the two-year punishment as too lenient and questioned the sincerity of Potter's tearful testimony at trial.\", \"\\\"Kim Potter murdered my son, and he died April 11. Today the justice system murdered him all over again,\\\" Wright said outside the courthouse. \\\"White woman tears trumped justice.\\\"\", \"Prosecutors had sought a sentence of seven years and two months, in line with state guidelines for first-degree manslaughter. Under state law, defendants facing multiple charges for the same act are sentenced only for the most serious count.\", \"But Judge Chu appeared to side with the arguments for leniency put forward by Potter's lawyers, who cited her lack of a prior criminal record and her complaint-free 26 years on the police force. One of her attorneys, Paul Engh, said on Friday that Wright had been an \\\"aggressor\\\" in resisting arrest.\", \"Chu also said she believed that Potter, who broke down in giving brief remarks on Friday, had shown deep remorse.\", \"\\\"I am so sorry that I hurt you so badly,\\\" Potter said in court on Friday in comments directed at Wright's family. \\\"My heart is broken and devastated for all of you.\\\"\", \"Potter has not appealed her conviction, and has not indicated she plans to appeal.\", \"Potter and a second officer pulled Wright over because there was an air freshener illegally hanging from his mirror and his vehicle registration tab had expired. They then learned of a warrant for his arrest on a misdemeanour weapons charge and tried to detain him. Wright resisted, breaking free from the second officer.\", \"Potter then shouted, \\\"Taser, Taser, Taser!\\\" and fired at Wright with her handgun, video from her body-worn camera showed. Potter testified that she feared for the life of a third officer who had entered the car through the passenger side.\", \"-Reuters\"]","href_hash":"8fbe7352913f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8fbe7352913f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
