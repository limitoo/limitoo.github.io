Furthermore, materials would not be marked or identified to show approval or disapproval of their content, the policy said.\", \"Webster turned to young adult novel Into the River by Ted Dawe as an example.\", \"The award-winning book was briefly banned in New Zealand in 2015, following a complaint. The interim ban made it a crime to supply, display, or distribute the book.\", \"The novel, aimed at a teenage audience, was about a M\\u0101ori boy from the rural East Coast who wins a scholarship to attend an exclusive boys' school in Auckland where he is bullied. The book contains sexual activities, drug taking and offensive language.\", \"The ban was later lifted, with the president of the New Zealand Film and Literature Board saying they felt the actions of the censor were \\\"illegal\\\".\", \"The ban was appealed because it was felt the book had value as a teaching resource, Webster said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/141139/eight_col_glenn1.jpg?1648780115\\\" alt=\\\"Marlborough District libraries manager Glenn Webster\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPhoto: LDR / Stuff / Scott Hammond\\n</div>\", \"Speaking after last week's meeting, Webster said people always had their own \\\"sense\\\" about what content was appropriate for the library.\", \"\\\"I once had a pre-school teacher that came to me about a picture book, and she thought we should withdraw it because the driver of a car wasn't wearing a seatbelt,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"That was really interesting.

They're ultimately responsible for the books that their child takes home.\\\"\", \"He said the library reviewed the collection almost on a daily basis, and consistently looked at reports to make sure some of its 120,000 items were actually being taken out.\", \"\\\"Often we find that stock when it first comes in, obviously moves fairly quickly, so it's in and out and in and out. It gets to a certain stage that actually it's only going out once or twice a year, or eventually, it's not going out at all,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"That's where we assess the collection on how relevant it is, and how current it is. Maybe the reason it's not going out is that it's in really poor condition, or it's outdated - and we've got new material on that sort of subject.\\\"\", \"He did not anticipate the size of Blenheim's collection would grow, even with the new library expected to open later this year.\", \"\\\"The library is more than collections of books.
