After the call, Mr. Manchin, who represents West Virginia, did not rule out the possibility of supporting the measure this month. He said that \\u201canything is possible here\\u201d when asked about a vote before Christmas, and that he was still \\u201cengaged\\u201d in conversations with the White House.\", \"But in a 50-50 Senate where Democrats would need all of their party\\u2019s votes to push through the legislation over unanimous Republican opposition, Mr. Manchin\\u2019s reluctance to embrace it has helped freeze the measure in place.\", \"\\u201cPeople have been in a hurry for a long time to do something, but I think, basically, we\\u2019re seeing things unfold that allows us to prepare better,\\u201d Mr. Manchin told reporters outside his Capitol Hill office on Monday, before the conversation with Mr. Biden. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s what we should do.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden and Mr. Manchin spoke by phone on Monday afternoon, in what Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, described as \\u201ca conversation between two people who have been in public life for some time and have had good-faith discussions directly.\\u201d Few details were offered about the conversation, though a spokeswoman for Mr. Manchin declared it \\u201cproductive\\u201d and said talks would continue.\", \"The conversation came after data released on Friday showed that prices were rising at the fastest pace in nearly 40 years amid persisting inflation. Mr. Manchin called the current trend \\u201calarming\\u201d and cautioned that \\u201cwhatever we\\u2019re considering doing, or whatever Congress is considering doing, they should do it within the limits of what we can afford.\\u201d\", \"His trepidation stands in contrast to the impatience of his Democratic colleagues, who are eager to end the year with a legislative triumph. That ambitious timeline, according to lawmakers and aides, would also ensure that an expanded monthly payment to most families with children would be extended and would not lapse at the end of the year.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing more to be gained from more talk,\\u201d said Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts. \\u201cWe have talked and talked and talked. It\\u2019s time to make some final decisions and vote.\\u201d\", \"In a speech on the Senate floor on Monday, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, said he still intended to push the bill through before Christmas, which would send it back to the House for final approval.\", \"\\u201cThis remains a laborious process, requiring a lot of precision and a lot of pieces moving together,\\u201d Mr. Schumer said. But, he added, \\u201cwe\\u2019re working hard to put the Senate in a position to get the legislation across the finish line before Christmas.\\u201d\", \"Regardless of whether Democrats have secured a commitment from Mr. Manchin, the legislation itself is far from complete.\", \"The Senate Finance Committee, for example, released updated text over the weekend for its component of the legislation but left unfinished a proposal to lift the cap on how much can be deducted in state and local taxes, which senators are still negotiating.\", \"Democrats are also still waiting for guidance about which parts of the bill may have to be removed because they violate Senate rules, including immigration provisions that many of them regard as a top priority. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the chairman of the Finance Committee, said his panel alone was litigating more than 20 issues.\", \"The measure is moving through Congress under a fast-track process known as budget reconciliation, which shields fiscal legislation from a filibuster but is subject to stringent restrictions. Republicans can challenge any component of the bill, and the Senate parliamentarian, the chamber\\u2019s top rules enforcer, is still considering which are valid.\", \"But much of the public focus has fallen on Mr. Manchin, whose sign-off is needed to move forward.\", \"Republicans are working to validate his concerns about the bill\\u2019s budgetary and economic impacts. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, has repeatedly said he prays for both Mr. Manchin and Senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, another key Democratic holdout.\", \"That has extended to painting elaborate pictures of what Republicans consider a worst-case fiscal future if the bill passes. They have pointed to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office that found that the proposals in the package would add about $3 trillion to the nation\\u2019s deficit if extended indefinitely. (Many of the bill\\u2019s provisions, like universal prekindergarten and an expanded tax credit for parents, expire before the end of the decade.)\", \"\\u201cThe one-two punch of the C.B.O. score, showing the bill to be much more expensive, and record high inflation after 40 years, I think will give Senator Manchin great pause,\\u201d said Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, the top Republican on the Budget Committee, adding that he had personally spoken to Mr. Manchin about the analysis.\", \"Mr. Manchin called the report \\u201cvery sobering\\u201d and said he would discuss it with Mr. Biden.\"]","href_hash":"8ee627c25c7611ecaf31ffba7c6777e4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8ee627c25c7611ecaf31ffba7c6777e4"}},
