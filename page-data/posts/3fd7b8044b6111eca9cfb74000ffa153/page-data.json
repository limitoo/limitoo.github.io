So you know, a good indication is if you've hit 90 percent first dose is a good indication of where you're heading.\\\"\", \"Cabinet decided on the 3 December date (the first full day of the traffic light system) today, which allowed for the legal requirements in getting the system set up, Ardern said.\", \"Legislation will be introduced and passed this week to enable that, Ardern said.\", \"She disagreed with the idea that the traffic light system legislation was being rushed through under urgency.\", \"\\\"The Covid protection framework has been publicly available and able to be discussed, debated and considered since October. The very opposition who are choosing to criticise us also have been asking us of course to just move arbitrarily. And of course we've got a process here where there's able to debate on the framework but ultimately decisions about when we move have been based on the health situation.\\\"\", \"The government will provide extra guidance for businesses to prepare.
