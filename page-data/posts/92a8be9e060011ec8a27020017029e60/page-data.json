It is protected by high mountain peaks - rising 9,800ft (3,000m) above the valley floor. They are an imposing natural barrier - protection for the people living there. \", \"There is only one narrow road in, which winds its way between large rocky outcrops and the meandering Panjshir River. \", \"\\\"There is a mythical aspect to the entire area. It's not just one valley. Once you get into it there are at least another 21 sub valleys connected,\\\" says Shakib Sharifi, who lived there as a child, but left Afghanistan after the Taliban took control.\", \"At the far end of the main valley, a trail leads up to the 4,430m (14,534ft) Anjoman Pass and heads further east into the Hindu Kush mountains. The armies of Alexander the Great and Tamerlane - the last of the great nomadic conquerors of Central Asia - both passed this way.\", \"\\\"Historically, the Panjshir Valley was also known for mining - including semi-precious jewels,\\\" says Elisabeth Leake, associate professor of international history at the University of Leeds.\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">1px transparent line</div>\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/EE26/production/_120266906_panjshir_valley_afghan_whole_2x_640-nc.png' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Map of Panjshir Valley in Afghanistan</div>\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/4BEB/production/_112953491__108802839_624_transparent-nc.png' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">1px transparent line</div>\", \"Today, the valley has hydroelectric dams and a wind farm.

It's one of Afghanistan's smallest.\", \"\\\"The decision to make it a province in its own right was controversial,\\\" says Dr Antonio Giustozzi, a senior research fellow at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). Panjshiri fighters had a lot of power in the early 2000s, he explains. They had helped recapture Kabul and became \\\"number one stakeholders\\\". \", \"Panjshiri leaders were given prominent positions in the government and military. The valley became autonomous and was the only province in Afghanistan where local governors - rather than people from outside of the area - were appointed. \", \"\\\"Normally, governors had to be seen to be more loyal to the government than the local population,\\\" says Dr Giustozzi. \\\"Panjshir was a special case.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Strategically significant</div>\", \"According to Dr Giustozzi, there are \\\"probably hundreds\\\" of similar valleys in Afghanistan.

It's all of them. Individually, these factors could apply to many places across Afghanistan.\\\"\", \"In this latest standoff, the valley is believed to also be home to large stockpiles of weapons. Fighters based in the valley were meant to have disbanded over the past 20 years and hand over their arms. \\\"But there are still stockpiles there,\\\" says Dr Giustozzi. \", \"\\\"Afghan officials with connections to Panjshir also moved more guns there because they were worried about presidents' Karzai and Ghani, but in the end it was the Taliban they needed to be worried about.\\\"\", \"The man heading the anti-Taliban force in the valley is 32-year-old Ahmad Massoud - son of revered resistance leader from the 1980s and '90s, Ahmad Shah Massoud.\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/14536/production/_120245238_gettyimages-1179604090.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A portrait of Ahmad Massoud, Panjshir Valley, Afghanistan, September 5, 2019</div>\", \"Massoud has said his fighters have military support from members of the Afghan army and special forces. \", \"\\\"We have stores of ammunition and arms that we have patiently collected since my father's time, because we knew this day might come,\\\" he wrote in a recent opinion piece for the Washington Post.\", \"His father, nicknamed the \\\"Lion of Panjshir\\\", was a mujahideen commander who thwarted both Soviet and Taliban forces. Panjshir itself means \\\"five lions\\\".  \", \"The son of an Afghan army general, Ahmad Shah Massoud was born in the valley. His portrait can still be found in many places throughout Panjshir Province and in Kabul - from monuments to billboards and shop windows.\", \"Because of him, the Panjshir valley become a centre of anti-Communist resistance, after the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA) won power in 1978 - and the Soviet Union moved in forces a year later.\", \"\\\"He became the public face of resistance in the Soviet-Afghan war,\\\" says Prof Elisabeth Leake from the University of Leeds. \\\"He had charisma and actively engaged with Western media.

Russian fighters had little experience of the terrain and were often left exposed to ambushes.\", \"The Soviets \\\"received a thousand wounds\\\" from the left, right and centre - says Mr Sharifi. One man - known as Mr DHsK after the Soviet machine gun he touted - used to hide under a rock and shoot at them, but they could never find him \\\"and that drove them crazy\\\".\", \"He says some of the current commanders were around at the end of that era. \\\"They were trained to stand alone at outposts without proper communication from headquarters.
