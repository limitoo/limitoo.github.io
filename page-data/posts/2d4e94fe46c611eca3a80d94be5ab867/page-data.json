They farm with wooden plows in patches of the rainforest, gather medicinal plants and set traps to catch snakes and wild boar.\", \"The land they occupy on Biak island is everything to them: their identity, the source of their livelihood and the link to their forebears. But now the tiny clan fears it will lose its place in the world as Indonesia pursues its longstanding quest to join the space age.\", \"The Indonesian government claims to have acquired 250 acres of the clan\\u2019s ancestral land decades ago and has planned since 2017 to build a small-scale spaceport there to launch rockets. Clan leaders say the project would force them from their homes.\", \"Indonesia\\u2019s president, Joko Widodo, personally pitched SpaceX\\u2019s founder, Elon Musk, last year on the idea of launching rockets from Indonesia, without mentioning a site. Mr. Musk has yet to commit to a deal or comment on it publicly. But the possibility of his involvement has spurred a flurry of activity by Biak officials to promote the location, as well as renewed opposition from the island\\u2019s Indigenous people.\", \"Building a spaceport is part of Mr. Joko\\u2019s push to modernize the Southeast Asian island nation with new airports, power plants and highways, often with little regard for environmental consequences. It is also part of the country\\u2019s checkered history of using questionable methods to acquire land from Indigenous people, leaving some groups destitute while benefiting influential Indonesians and international companies.\", \"Leaders of the Biak tribe say building a spaceport on the site would mean cutting trees in a protected forest, disturbing the habitat of endangered birds and evicting the Abrauw.\", \"\\u201cThe position of the Indigenous people is clear: We reject the plan,\\u201d said Apolos Sroyer, chief of the Biak Customary Council, an assembly of clan chiefs. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t want to lose our farms because of this spaceport. We don\\u2019t eat satellites. We eat taro, and fish from the sea. That is our way of life for generations. Tell Elon Musk that\\u2019s our stance.\\u201d\", \"Biak, nearly the size of Maui, sits just north of the island of New Guinea and is part of Indonesia\\u2019s Papua Province. During World War II, American forces defeated the Japanese there in a key battle as Gen. Douglas MacArthur fought to retake the Pacific. Biak became part of Indonesia in the 1960s after the United Nations handed over the former Dutch territory of West Papua on the condition that Indonesia hold a popular vote.\", \"Instead, in a 1969 vote regarded by many Papuans as rigged, Indonesia rounded up a thousand tribal leaders \\u2014 including chiefs from Biak \\u2014 and held them until they voted to join Indonesia in what paradoxically became known as \\u201cThe Act of Free Choice.\\u201d\", \"The dwindling Abrauw clan, one of 360 clans on Biak, now has about 90 members. Most live in the village of Warbon, on the island\\u2019s northeastern side, about a mile and a half from the proposed spaceport site.\", \"The center of clan life is a flowering heliotrope tree by the ocean.\", \"Waves lap gently on the white sand nearby, and black, brown and white butterflies flit among its branches. Clan members consider the tree sacred and say it marks the origin of the Abrauw. They often visit the tree to make offerings and pray to their ancestors. On occasion, they gather there and camp for days. If the spaceport was built, the tree would be off limits, as would the beach where the Abrauw often fish, and the forest where they farm.\", \"\\u201cFor Papuans, land is identity,\\u201d said Marthen Abrauw, the clan chief, as he sat in the shade of the sacred tree on a recent afternoon. \\u201cWe will lose our identity, and no other clan will accept us on their land. Where will our children and grandchildren go?\\u201d\", \"Some clan members have found work in other parts of Indonesia, but those who remain in Warbon largely subsist on the fish they catch and the taro, cassava and sweet potatoes they grow. The clan practices nomadic farming, clearing trees in the forest for crops in a new location every two years.\", \"Some walk or ride motorbikes to the nearby village of Korem to worship at the Pniel Evangelical Christian Church. Warbon, home to more than 1,000 people, includes members of numerous other clans who have married into the Abrauw but retain the clan identity of their male ancestors. The church also opposes the spaceport.\", \"The Indonesian officials who support the project say Biak, just 70 miles south of the Equator and facing the Pacific, would be ideal for launching rockets. SpaceX has plans to put tens of thousands of communications satellites into orbit in the coming years.\", \"\\u201cThis is our wealth,\\u201d said Biak\\u2019s regent, Herry Ario Naap, who is pushing for the spaceport. \\u201cOther regions may have oil or gold. We are given a strategic geographical location.\\u201d\", \"In wooing Mr. Musk, Mr. Joko suggested that his car company, Tesla, could also collaborate with Indonesia to make electric vehicle batteries, as Indonesia is the world\\u2019s largest producer of nickel, a key component. A team from SpaceX visited Indonesia early this year to discuss possible cooperation, officials said.\", \"Tesla submitted a battery production proposal to Indonesia in February, but the government declined to disclose details. Mr. Musk and his companies did not respond to requests for comment. In September, Mr. Joko bolstered the space program by increasing its budget twentyfold and placing it under the new National Research and Innovation Agency, which reports directly to him.\", \"Laksana Tri Handoko, the agency chairman, who personally inspected the Biak site last month, said that the island remained a viable choice but that building the large spaceport he envisioned would require 10 times as much land. Controversy over the Biak site could prompt him to select an alternate location, such as Morotai island, about 550 miles northwest of Biak.\", \"A key factor, he said, will be making sure the government has \\u201cclear and clean\\u201d title to the land. \\u201cBiak is not the one and only place,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe have many options.\\u201d\", \"Government maps show that nearly all the Abrauw clan\\u2019s ancestral lands, including some homes, are within a proposed buffer zone that would be cleared of people should the small spaceport be built. The maps also show that the original project site is almost entirely within a protected forest.\", \"The space agency has long said it bought the 250-acre site from the Abrauw clan in 1980. But the clan says it never sold the land. Four men who signed a document giving the agency title were not clan members and had no right to sell, according to clan leaders.\", \"The older generation was too intimidated to object, they said, because the Indonesian army was conducting military operations on Biak and anyone who criticized the government could be jailed as a separatist.\", \"\\u201cSilence was the only choice,\\u201d said Gerson Abrauw, a Protestant pastor and cousin of the clan chief. He dismissed government assurances that a spaceport would provide employment.\", \"\\u201cThey say the spaceport project will create jobs, but there is no space expert in our clan and in our villages,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhat they mean is three years of cutting down trees, removing roots and digging foundations. After that, there will be a feast to say goodbye to us and then only those with an access card can enter the area.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"2d4e94fe46c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2d4e94fe46c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
