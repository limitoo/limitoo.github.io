And he wanted to play in the big leagues.\\u201d\", \"These days, Soler, now 29, isn\\u2019t simply playing in the big leagues; he is using his towering stature to blast balls entirely of stadiums, guide teams to championships and earn trophies.\", \"On Tuesday, in Atlanta\\u2019s 7-0 win over the Houston Astros in Game 6 of the World Series that sealed the Braves\\u2019 first title since 1995, Soler smashed a mammoth three-run home run that left Minute Maid Park and left his teammates in awe.\", \"It was Soler\\u2019s third home run of the Series \\u2014 each of which had given Atlanta the lead in a game. His efforts earned him the World Series Most Valuable Player Award, joining pitcher Livan Hern\\u00e1ndez of the Florida Marlins in 1997 as the only Cuban-born players to earn the distinction.\", \"\\u201cThis means a lot to me,\\u201d Soler said in Spanish, with a Cuban flag draped over his shoulders while holding his daughter as he stood on the confetti-covered infield.\", \"\\u201cThis is the biggest thing that\\u2019s happened to me in my career, especially from where I come from, Cuba. It\\u2019s harder to reach here and reach the big leagues and have these results. It\\u2019s incredible.\\u201d\", \"In 2011, Soler, at 18, left Cuba on a boat with his father to pursue his baseball dreams, his father said. A year later, he signed a contract with the Chicago Cubs for nine years and $30 million. In 2014, he was called up to the major leagues at 22.\", \"Over the next two seasons, Soler flashed his tantalizing but still raw talent. During the Cubs\\u2019 World Series-winning season in 2016, he hit .238 with 12 home runs over 86 games but was largely relegated to coming off the bench during the postseason.\", \"Traded to the Kansas City Royals that winter, Soler battled injuries, demotions and inconsistency. In 2019, his talent re-emerged: He hit an American League-leading 48 home runs, drove in 117 runs and played in all 162 games. But then his performance slipped over the next two seasons.\", \"On July 29 of this season, Soler was hitting .192 with 13 home runs over 94 games with the Royals. Desperate to reinvigorate a team that was floundering and had lost key outfielders such as Ronald Acu\\u00f1a Jr., Atlanta traded the next day for Soler \\u2014 one of four outfielders the Braves acquired at the trade deadline.\", \"\\u201cIt was challenging at first,\\u201d Soler said through an interpreter. \\u201cI felt a little out of my comfort zone. I didn\\u2019t really know people. It was kind of tough to go to a new place and start making those acquaintances and everything. Within a week, I felt right at home.\\u201d\", \"Soler blossomed with Atlanta, helping the team reach the postseason. But during the National League division series against the Milwaukee Brewers, Soler, who was unvaccinated, tested positive for the coronavirus and missed 10 days. He returned for the final two games of the N.L. Championship Series, felt bad about not being there for his teammates and vowed to get vaccinated as soon as possible. He then went on a tear during the World Series.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve known what he can do for so long,\\u201d Atlanta first baseman Freddie Freeman said. \\u201cI mean, two years ago he\\u2019s hitting 50 homers. It\\u2019s actually pretty incredible what he did in the World Series, getting Covid and missing 10 days and then coming back and not missing a beat. That\\u2019s hard to do in this game.\\u201d\", \"In the first at-bat of the World Series, Soler clobbered a home run. In Game 4, his solo homer put Atlanta on top in a seventh-inning comeback. And in Game 6, he put Atlanta up for good when he connected on a hanging off-speed pitch from the Astros pitcher Luis Garcia and silenced a loud home crowd in Houston.\", \"It was Soler\\u2019s third go-ahead home run of the World Series. Only Oakland Athletics catcher Gene Tenace in the 1972 World Series hit more such home runs (four).\", \"\\u201cOff the bat, I was saying, \\u2018I think it\\u2019s got a chance,\\u2019\\u201d reliever Luke Jackson said. \\u201cThen I realized it might never be found again.\\u201d\", \"The home run\\u2019s distance was estimated at 446 feet but felt longer. Because the Minute Maid Park retractable roof was open, the ball flew over the train tracks in left field and, according to security guards, landed in a courtyard.\", \"\\u201cOh my God, that was an absolute bomb,\\u201d Atlanta reliever Tyler Matzek said of Soler, who is listed at 6-foot-4 and 235 pounds. \\u201cHe\\u2019s one of the most physically gifted people I\\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life. He\\u2019s like an N.F.L. tight end out there swinging the bat. It\\u2019s unbelievable.\\u201d\", \"After the game, Soler\\u2019s father admitted that he thought about their escape from Cuba often because it was a harrowing experience and it is what landed them here, standing on the field after another World Series title, this time with a series M.V.P. trophy.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m really proud of what I did and how all of my teammates played as a group,\\u201d Jorge Soler said in Spanish, adding later, \\u201cI\\u2019m really proud of myself and I thank God for the opportunity and the talent.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"fcfc657c3d5811ecb8de000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fcfc657c3d5811ecb8de000017025a03"}},
