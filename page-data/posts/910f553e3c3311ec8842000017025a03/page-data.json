Put another way: Are censures, which are formal reprimands and a kind of punishment, a form of free speech or a threat to it?\", \"The answer to that question, several justices said, did not seem difficult.\", \"\\u201cUnless there\\u2019s something special about the word \\u2018censure,\\u2019 and maybe there is, this is a very easy case,\\u201d said Justice Samuel A. Alito Jr. \\u201cOne person says something derogatory about another person, and then the other person responds by saying something derogatory about the first person. Nobody\\u2019s free speech rights are violated there.\\u201d\", \"The case was brought by David Wilson, a former elected trustee of the Houston Community College System and an energetic critic of its work. In addition to airing his concerns in interviews and on a website, Mr. Wilson sued the system\\u2019s board, orchestrated robocalls and hired private investigators to look into whether another trustee had lied about where she lived.\", \"He was, a federal appeals court judge wrote in a dissent, a \\u201cgadfly legislator.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Wilson said there was plenty to criticize about the college system. In a Supreme Court brief, his lawyers said the board had been investigated for \\u201crampant political graft.\\u201d In 2018, a former trustee was convicted of accepting bribes from people seeking contracts with the college.\", \"That same year, Mr. Wilson\\u2019s fellow board members censured him. \\u201cThe board finds that Mr. Wilson\\u2019s conduct was not only inappropriate, but reprehensible, and such conduct warrants disciplinary action,\\u201d the resolution said.\", \"Mr. Wilson sued, saying the censure had violated the First Amendment.\", \"A unanimous three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, allowed the case to proceed, ruling last year that punishing an elected official for his speech can run afoul of the Constitution.\", \"\\u201cThe Supreme Court has long stressed the importance of allowing elected officials to speak on matters of public concern,\\u201d Judge W. Eugene Davis wrote for the panel. \\u201cA reprimand against an elected official for speech addressing a matter of public concern is an actionable First Amendment claim.\\u201d\", \"At Tuesday\\u2019s argument, Michael B. Kimberly, a lawyer for Mr. Wilson, drew distinctions that appeared to frustrate some of the justices. He said, for instance, that elected bodies can punish their members for what they say during the lawmaking process but cannot issue formal reprimands for speech in other settings.\", \"Justice Amy Coney Barrett seemed to find that distinction surprising. \\u201cLet\\u2019s imagine that a member engages in really offensive speech full of racial slurs that he said on the floor, let\\u2019s say, in the debate about some civil rights legislation,\\u201d she said. Under Mr. Kimberly\\u2019s theory, she said, that speech could be the subject of a censure resolution.\", \"But, Justice Barrett added, if the same member \\u201cwalks out onto the steps and gives a press conference and repeats those exact same racial slurs, that is not subject to censure ever?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s correct,\\u201d Mr. Kimberly said.\", \"Other justices expressed concerns about ruling on clashes between politicians.\", \"Justice Clarence Thomas, for instance, appeared wary of having courts become \\u201cinvolved in the rough and tumble of politics.\\u201d Justice Stephen G. Breyer echoed that point, saying that \\u201cif we get into the business of starting to really oversee this, then we\\u2019ve changed the government structure significantly.\\u201d\", \"Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh said the court should consider a narrow ruling. \\u201cDo we have to get into any of this in this case?\\u201d he asked. \\u201cI thought the issue, all we had to decide, was a mere censure does not trigger a retaliation claim.\\u201d\", \"Sopan Joshi, a lawyer for the federal government arguing in support of the system\\u2019s board, said there were ample historical examples to establish that \\u201ca censure resolution adopted by an elected body against one of its members does not abridge that member\\u2019s freedom of speech.\\u201d\", \"Richard A. Morris, a lawyer for the system\\u2019s board in the case, Houston Community College System v. Wilson, No. 20-804, said the power to censure was essential in the current political climate.\", \"\\u201cElected officials these days can be their own independent misinformation machines,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand they can do great damage to institutions, all on social media.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"910f553e3c3311ec8842000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"910f553e3c3311ec8842000017025a03"}},
