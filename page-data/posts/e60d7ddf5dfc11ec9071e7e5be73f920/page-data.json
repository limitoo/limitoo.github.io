However, her ousting comes after the affiliate's board heard differing opinions on her handling of a racist encounter.

Charbonneau claims that she told the donor that she should not have used the word. However, board members Jeff Sprung and Colleen Foster said that they had proof that Charbonneau did not admonish the donor like she said she did.\", \"\\\"If I had to do it over again, I would not have used that actual term,\\\" the former CEO told The Seattle Times in an interview.
