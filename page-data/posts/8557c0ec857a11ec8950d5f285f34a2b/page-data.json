Let's respect this for a period of time until we see the regeneration and when it does regenerate, let's work with our mana whenua until we have sustainable fisheries.\\\"\", \"The r\\u0101hui would remain in place until the time Tangaroa showed that his children had recovered, MacDonald said.\", \"\\\"When we see the shellfish beds no longer racked up by the machinery of commercial dredges and we see the tipa (scallops) growing and in full maturity, we will know our r\\u0101hui has done its job. Then we know it's the time to turn it over to the care and protection of kaitiaki and for all our community groups to look after it.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"8557c0ec857a11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8557c0ec857a11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
