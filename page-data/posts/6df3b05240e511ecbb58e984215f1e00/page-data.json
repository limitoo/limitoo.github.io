There are still around 66 million unvaccinated adults in the U.S., a figure President Biden called \\\"unacceptable.\\\"\", \"Buttigieg said a large portion of the shortage can be blamed on digital and online shopping. Demand for goods has reportedly increased heavily as the pandemic continues, with more Americans choosing to shop from their couch than physically going to stores.\", \"\\\"Literally anywhere in our economy there is a relationship between a manufacturer, a shipper, and a retailer...there are a thousand points in that [supply] chain where something could go wrong,\\\" Buttigieg said.\", \"\\\"We're seeing a lot of those points reveal themselves because of the enormous demand, the constraints on supply, [and] the outdated infrastructure it all runs across,\\\" he added.\", \"The supply chain crisis began to manifest this summer, and soon, many ports of call across the globe were facing bottlenecks. This was especially true in Asian countries like Singapore and China, according to Bloomberg, which besides being major manufacturing hubs, have also dealt with recent COVID outbreaks.\", \"The crisis received significant coverage in the United States, with images of barren grocery store shelves and lines of container ships backed up into the ocean circulating across social media.\", \"While the eventual stoppage of the pandemic will begin to get global supply chains moving again, it will likely be a slow burn.\", \"\\\"Even amid signs of slowing [pandemic] growth, the pipeline of international commerce has never been so clogged,\\\" according to Bloomberg. \\\"A longer-term fix means getting COVID-19 under control, building new infrastructure such as more efficient ports, and improving technology for digital transactions and faster communication.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"6df3b05240e511ecbb58e984215f1e00"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6df3b05240e511ecbb58e984215f1e00"}},
