Existing blood tests generally require a needle in the arm to extract a vial of blood for each test.\", \"Jurors have heard recordings of Holmes boasting to investors about purported breakthroughs in a blood-testing technology that proved to be untrue.\", \"Holmes' lawyers must present a case that persuades jurors that the government has not met its burden to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. They probably will go beyond that threshold, predicted Jessica Roth, a law professor at Yeshiva University in New York,\", \"\\\"What the defense will do is present witnesses and documentary evidence, much as the prosecution would, to support its claim that Elizabeth Holmes did not have an intent to deceive anybody,\\\" Roth said.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936866/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-silicon-valley.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Elizabeth Holmes, founder and CEO of Theranos leaves the Robert F. Peckham Federal Building in downtown San Jose, California, on May 4, 2021. The U.S. government rested its case in Holmes' trial on November 19, 2021, after spending more than two months trying to prove she bamboozled investors, patients and business partners into believing that her startup was about to reshape health care by using just a few drops for blood for tests that usually require vials.</div>\", \"In the prelude to the trial, Holmes' lawyers filed papers stating she may testify about being manipulated by her former boyfriend\\u2014and Theranos' chief operating officer\\u2014Sunny Balwani, who faces similar charges in another criminal trial scheduled to begin early next year. In their cross-examination of government witnesses, Holmes' lawyers have repeatedly tried to vilify Balwani.\", \"Those flaws didn't become public knowledge, though, until The Wall Street Journal published the first in a series of explosive articles in October 2015 and the results of an audit by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services were released the next year.\", \"By then, Holmes and Balwani had raised hundreds of millions of dollars from billionaire investors such as media mogul Rupert Murdoch and the Walton family of Walmart and struck deals with Walgreens and Safeway to conduct blood tests in their stores. Those investments at one point valued Theranos at $9 billion, giving Holmes a $4.5 billion fortune\\u2014on paper\\u2014in 2014.\", \"Evidence presented at the trial also revealed that Holmes had distributed financial projections calling for privately held Theranos to generate $140 million in revenue in 2014 and $990 million in revenue in 2015 while also turning a profit. A copy of Theranos' 2015 tax return presented as part of the trial evidence showed the company had revenues of less than $500,000 that year while reporting accumulated losses of $585 million.\", \"Ellen Kreitzberg, a Santa Clara University law professor who has been attending the trial, said she thought the government had made a strong case.\", \"\\\"There's nothing sort of fancy or sexy about this testimony,\\\" she said. \\\"The witnesses were very careful in their testimony. None of the witnesses seemed to harbor anger or a grudge against her. And so because of that, they were very powerful witnesses.\\\"\", \"The 29 witnesses called by the government included former two Theranos lab directors who repeatedly warned Holmes that the blood-testing technology was wildly unreliable. Prosecutors also questioned two part-time lab directors, including Balwani's dermatologist, who spent only a few hours scrutinizing Theranos' blood-testing technology during late 2014 and most of 2015. As Holmes' lawyers noted, the part-time lab directors were allowed under government regulations.\", \"Other key witnesses included former employees of Pfizer, former Safeway CEO Steve Burd and a litany of Theranos investors, including a representative for the family investment firm of Betsy DeVos, the former education secretary under President Donald Trump. The DeVos family wound up investing $100 million.\", \"It was perhaps just as notable whom the government didn't summon to the stand from the list of nearly 200 potential witnesses that it submitted before the trial began. That list included two former Theranos board members who were part of Presidential cabinets\\u2014Henry Kissinger, secretary of state during the Nixon administration, and William Perry, secretary of defense during the Clinton administration.\", \"Witness testimony and other evidence presented in the trial strongly suggests that Holmes misrepresented purported deals with major pharmaceutical firms such Pfizer and the U.S. military while also concealing recurring problems with the Edison.\", \"For the past three months, the former entrepreneur has sat stoically to the right of the jury that will determine her fate. Typically bolt upright in her chair and staring straight ahead, Holmes has remained impassive as even one-time supporters testified to their misgivings about her actions while leading Theranos.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936872/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-fortune-global-forum.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Elizabeth Holmes' lawyers aren't saying whether or not the former Theranos CEO will take the stand in her own defense after the government rested its case Friday.
