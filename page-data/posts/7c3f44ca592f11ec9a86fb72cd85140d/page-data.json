Art is made by all sorts of people, everywhere, all the time, along many different paths, some of which are illuminated by these intriguing publications chosen by our critics.\", \"The maverick American artist Ray Johnson (1927-1995), who managed to be nowhere and everywhere in the art world through his invention of Mail Art, was lucky in his longtime friend William S. Wilson, to whom, over 60 years, he gave thousands of letters, collages, drawings and clippings. Wilson saved every last scrap, and a jampacked sampling of them makes up this gold mine of a book, edited and curated by Caitlin Haskell with Jordan Carter. Funny, biting, morbid, it\\u2019s a page-turner for sure, and accompanies a show at the Art Institute of Chicago through March 22). (Art Institute of Chicago, distributed by Yale University Press)\", \"Edited by the curator Valerie Cassel Oliver, this catalog for one of the outstanding exhibitions of the season \\u2014 originating at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, it\\u2019s now in Houston \\u2014 proposes that the culture of the African American South, as defined by music and vernacular art, is the bedrock of American culture itself, with a strong influence on new art today. The book vividly illustrates and deepens the show\\u2019s powerful argument. (Virginia Museum of Fine Arts, distributed by Duke University Press)\", \"This book lovingly excavates the career of a Greek modernist painter who designed sets for Maria Callas and kept a Greek Classical figurative tradition alive in paintings of homoerotic nudes. Tsarouchis (1910-1989) was both too radical and too conservative for the art world of his time and fell into oblivion outside of Greece. Edited by Niki Gripari and Adam Szymczyk (and including a selection of the artist\\u2019s writings, this tender tribute brings him back. (Sternberg Press)\", \"The London exhibition by this name reunited six major mythological paintings that Titian produced for the Spanish court. One of them, \\u201cThe Rape of Europa,\\u201d belongs to the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, where the show, now called\\u201cTitian: Women, Myth & Power\\u201d is making its final stop (through Jan. 2.) A slender Gardner-issued publication devoted to that picture is an indispensable companion volume to the handsome London catalog. (National Gallery, London; published by Yale University Press)\", \"Edited by Christine Macel and Karolina Ziebinska-Lewandowska and produced for a major show at the Centre Pompidou, Paris, this book documents the contributions of more than 100 female painters, sculptors, photographers and performers to the history of modernist abstraction and, by including artists from Asia and South America, demonstrates that abstraction itself has always been a global phenomenon. That many worthy figures aren\\u2019t included only makes the case for a continuing corrective art history stronger. (Thames and Hudson)\", \"Edited by Howie Chen, this compendium brings together archival documents related to the formation, in New York City in 1990, of Godzilla, a collective of artists and curators intent on pointing out the exclusion of Asian American artists from the contemporary art world and pushing for their presence in that world. The book includes protest letters, news releases, and the minutes of group meetings. The result is a how-to in advocacy politics, a study in the complexities of identity politics, and a chorale of treasurable voices. (Primary Information)\", \"Following the Guggenheim\\u2019s 2018 reveal of the mystical abstractions of Hilma af Klint, the Museum of Modern Art, Kunstmuseum Basel and Tate Modern further expand the mostly male ranks of European modernism to include Sophie Taeuber-Arp, one of its greatest polymaths (and colorists), whose egalitarian view of art and craft proved that abstractions in woven wool can trounce the oil on canvas kind. Edited by Anne Umland and Walburga Krupp. (Museum of Modern Art/Kunstmuseum Basel)\", \"The painting on the cover of this exceedingly large volume recently set an auction record for the artist, but don\\u2019t let that spoil it for you. This lavish book, edited by Luis-Mart\\u00edn Lozano, contains many rarely seen paintings bolstered by numerous drawings, extensive photographs from her life and reproductions of related works by other artists. (Taschen)\", \"This catalog, with a leading essay by the curator Katherine Jentleson, accompanies the largest show of the great visionary Nellie Mae Rowe (1900-1982), painter, sculptor, doll-maker, environment-builder and Christian, at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta (through Jan. 9). Some of her drawings announce \\u201cGod is Not Dead,\\u201d in bold colorful cursive writing. Rowe is the fourth great American outsider artist to receive a major catalog since 2007, after Martin Ram\\u00edrez, Bill Traylor and Joseph Yoakum. May the trend continue. (DelMonico Books \\u2014 D.A.P., New York)\", \"This small cornucopia of a book, edited by Alison M. Gingeras, accompanies the first American exhibition of the formidable Polish artist and activist Erna Rosenstein (1913-2004) at Hauser & Wirth (through Dec. 23). It shows the stunning variety of her work, not just its many shades of Surrealism and biomorphic abstraction, but also its affinities with Fluxus, Nouveau Realism and Art Povera. Her life and work are detailed against the vivid tapestry of postwar Eastern European history \\u2014 itself an education. (Hauser & Wirth Publications)\", \"Doris Lee (1905-1983) worked simultaneously as a fine and a commercial artist, illustrating \\u201cThe Rodgers and Hart Songbook,\\u201d while exhibiting paintings with the still-extant AAA Galleries in Manhattan. The paintings, which combined Grandma Moses with the textured color fields of Milton Avery cheerfully reflect this duality. This catalog, by Melissa Wolfe, and a traveling show at the Westmoreland Museum of American Art in Greensburg, Pa., (through Jan. 9) should begin to end her obscurity. (Westmoreland Museum of Art and Giles Ltd., London)\", \"This year\\u2019s unhappy Tokyo Olympics at least leave an architectural legacy: the lean, low-impact New National Stadium, made of the unfinished cedar that Kengo Kuma has made his authorial and ecological signature. This immense architectural tome \\u2014 spanning three decades, weighing in at 11 pounds \\u2014 establishes once and for all that sustainability and style need not be set at odds. New photography highlights his serene Nezu Museum and brawny V & A Dundee; temporary experiments in New York and Milan; and a Fukuoka storefront whose 2,000 intersecting cedar struts frame the world\\u2019s most elegant Starbucks. (Taschen)\", \"He first declared a bicycle wheel to be a work of art in 1913, but it took nearly half a century \\u2014 with the 1959 publication of Robert Lebel\\u2019s catalogue raisonn\\u00e9 of his early painting, his ready-mades and his cryptic notes \\u2014 for the New York art world to crown the discreet and debonair Duchamp as King Marcel. Long out of print, it\\u2019s now been re-editioned and bundled with a supplement that maps the influence of Lebel\\u2019s book over the decades, all housed in a handsome slipcase. (Hauser & Wirth Publishers)\", \"Few photobooks have the mythic status of \\u201cChizu\\u201d (\\u201cThe Map\\u201d), first published in Tokyo in 1965, for which the Japanese photographer Kikuji Kawada shot worn flags, dented Lucky Strike boxes and the walls of the Atomic Bomb Dome in Hiroshima as haunted abstractions in blown-out, high-contrast black-and-white. The 1965 edition is a single volume with gatefolds \\u2014 but a maquette in the New York Public Library shows that Kawada initially conceived \\u201cChizu\\u201d as a two-volume project. The N.Y.P.L. curator Joshua Chuang and the historian Miyuki Hinton have overseen this painstaking reproduction, while a new bilingual supplement offers further perspectives on this rarest and most mysterious artistic response to the nightmare of World War II. (Mack)\", \"Statues also die; some get a second life. The year\\u2019s most beautiful exhibition, at the Capitoline Museums in Rome, brought to public view the world\\u2019s finest privately owned Greek and Roman sculptures \\u2014 and its catalog, edited by the archaeologists Salvatore Settis and Carlo Gasparri, is as handsome as it is learned. But if it\\u2019s Roman grandeur you\\u2019re after, get the lush coffee table book \\u201cVilla Albani Torlonia,\\u201d for which Massimo Listri photographed the aristocratic family\\u2019s Neoclassical mansion, its chipped goddesses and rusting heroes standing against acres of trompe l\\u2019oeil marble and gold leaf. (Both, Rizzoli)\", \"The Impressionists were gripped by social life at the opera, the cafe, the seaside; the Nabis, two decades later, saw just as much modernity at home. This catalog of an exhibition at the Cleveland Museum of Art and Portland Art Museum (through Jan. 23) presents the sometimes tender, sometimes stifling domestic imagery of Maurice Denis, F\\u00e9lix Vallotton, Pierre Bonnard and \\u2014 above all \\u2014 \\u00c9douard Vuillard, whose dense, crosshatched scenes in the boudoir or at the kitchen table captured what one critic called \\u201cthe daily tragedy and mystery of ordinary existence, and the latent poetry of things.\\u201d The curators Mary Weaver Chapin, Heather Lemonedes Brown and other contributors offer insight into domestic music performances, home garden design, and even pet ownership in fin-de-si\\u00e8cle Paris. (Yale University Press)\", \"The seventh continent is not frozen but in constant flux \\u2014 and changing faster than ever thanks to us. Probe the 1,000 engrossing pages of this landmark publication, edited by Giulia Foscari and UNLESS and inaugurated at this year\\u2019s Venice Architecture Biennale, and you will learn everything you never knew you needed to know about human society on an uninhabited landmass: Antarctic law enforcement, Antarctic communication technology, Antarctic water management. Terra Australis stands here as a nearly utopian built environment, and the book concludes with an indispensable \\u201cArchive of Antarctic Architecture,\\u201d with site plans and photography of more than a century\\u2019s efforts to inhabit the most extreme of environments. (Lars M\\u00fcller Publishers)\", \"Kara Walker offers an extraordinary tome: some 650 drawings, sketches and texts from her archive since the 1990s. It\\u2019s all here \\u2014 Trump, Obama, the plantation, sexual demand and degradation, all the American phantasmagoria of her famous silhouette works and monumental installations; but also clippings, notecards, dream diaries, the artist wrangling with the fetters of prominence and racial expectations. In an essay, Walker wonders why she kept all this stuff; there must have been \\u201csome urge to talk about it later, an urge toward radical openness that any proper and studied artist would prefer to keep in check.\\u201d It\\u2019s a treasure. (JRP Editions)\", \"This volume showcases 17 photographers from nine countries, graduates of a 2008-18 mentorship program founded by Simon Njami, a respected curator (and co-editor of this book, with Sean O\\u2019Toole). A few have become recognized \\u2014 Sammy Baloji, Lebohang Kganye \\u2014 while others, like Gosette Lubondo, are emerging just now into the continent\\u2019s photo vanguard, with a full spectrum of documentary and conceptual approaches. Here, 13 essays by critics approach the subject by theme \\u2014 \\u201cKnowledge,\\u201d \\u201cFiction,\\u201d \\u201cDesire\\u201d\\u2014 and broaden their discussion to other emerging photographers as well as the archive. It\\u2019s a generous approach that proposes African photography as a fertile and expansive field of collective inquiry. (Kerber)\", \"In an exhibition this year at MoMA, Black architects and designers imagined interventions in 10 American cities that would not only make visible but repair the effects of anti-Black planning, policy and spatial violence. It was an important show, if dense and all-too-brief. Fortunately, the catalog (edited by Sean Anderson and Mabel O. Wilson) supplements these propositions with texts by prominent scholars and critics that give the project an open feel and cross-disciplinary weave. In preparing for the exhibition, the architects and designers formed the Black Reconstruction Collective, modeling the self-determination and liberation values they insist are necessary. (MoMA)\", \"Shahzia Sikander is known for disruptions of the Indo-Persian miniature painting tradition, which she expanded compositionally and infused with feminist and political themes. Rich with essays and conversations (edited by Sadia Abbas and Jan Howard), this catalog accompanies an exquisite exhibition on her early career (1987-2003). It follows her training in Pakistan, move to the United States in 1993, and navigation of U.S. social and racial realities; it leaves off in the frenzy of the War on Terror. It proves instructive to re-examine those years through Sikander\\u2019s keen grasp and artistic choices.
