In his appearance on MSNBC, he told host Ari Melber that they had lined up \\\"over 100\\\" congressmen and senators to help challenge the election results in six battleground states that had been won by Joe Biden.\", \"\\\"These were the places where we believed that if the votes were sent back to those battleground states and looked at again, that there would be enough concern amongst the legislatures that most or all of those states would decertify the election. That would throw the election to the House of Representatives,\\\" Navarro said, arguing the plan was legal.\", \"In a statement to CBS News at the time of the subpoena, Navarro accused the January 6 committee of being \\\"domestic terrorists\\\" and called their efforts a \\\"partisan witch hunt.\\\" He said that since Trump has invoked executive privilege, the committee should \\\"negotiate any waiver of the privilege with the president and his attorneys directly, not through me.\\\"\", \"Scavino, the former White House communications director, was subpoenaed for documents and testimony in September, along with former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, former Senior Counselor Steve Bannon, and former Pentagon Chief of Staff Kashyap Patel.\", \"The committee sought his testimony about Mr. Trump's activities and communications in the days leading up to the attack on the Capitol, citing both his presence in the White House that day as well as his more than a decade of work for the former president.\", \"Scavino sued Verizon late last year in an attempt to block the company from handing over his phone records in response to a separate subpoena from the committee.\\u00a0\", \"The House has already voted to hold Bannon and Meadows in contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas from the committee. The Justice Department has yet to take action in Meadows' case after the House vote in December. Bannon was indicted for contempt in November and has pleaded not guilty.\", \"The committee has issued more than 90 subpoenas, including ones to Trump's allies, former White House officials, campaign aides and individuals involved in the planning of the rally outside the White House before the Capitol building came under siege.\\u00a0\", \"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi created the House select committee last year to investigate the January 6 attack, when thousands of Trump supporters descended on the Capitol as Congress counted the electoral votes, a largely ceremonial final step affirming Mr. Biden's victory. Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \\\"walk over\\\" to the Capitol during the rally at the Ellipse before the electoral vote count, was impeached by the House one week later for inciting the riot but was later acquitted by the Senate.\\u00a0\", \"Ellis Kim and Caroline Linton contributed to this report\", \"Rebecca Kaplan covers Congress for CBS News.\"]","href_hash":"0b0f9bc6aba811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0b0f9bc6aba811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
