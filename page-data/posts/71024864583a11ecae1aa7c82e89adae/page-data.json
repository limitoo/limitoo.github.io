She stole scenes in her first acting gig as an ebulliently inept assistant to a talent agent on HBO Max\\u2019s \\u201cHacks.\\u201d\", \"Now she is laying the worst of 2021 to rest. On Dec. 23 she\\u2019ll bid farewell to \\u201chot vaxx summer\\u201d in a flirty-girl get-up, in the second edition of the Amazon annual special \\u201cYearly Departed.\\u201d\", \"The hyperchatty Stalter was star-struck by a lineup of fellow comics that included Yvonne Orji, Chelsea Peretti and Dulc\\u00e9 Sloan. Then Jane Fonda walked onto the set to shoot her segment.\", \"\\u201cNo one could talk,\\u201d she said. \\u201cWe were all drooling and I think she thought we were weird because at first we couldn\\u2019t speak. And she was like, \\u2018Is everything OK?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"In a word, very.\", \"But after paying her dues in comedy for eight years, Stalter sees her ascent during the pandemic as bittersweet.\", \"\\u201cEverything is starting to happen now and it\\u2019s really strange to be so worried about other people \\u2014 we\\u2019ve experienced so much devastation \\u2014 and also to stop and be like, \\u2018How lucky am I to be living my dream right now?\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cI guess that\\u2019s what life is. You have to just embrace the good parts, even when it\\u2019s scary and hard.\\u201d\", \"Calling from London, where she was making her British stand-up debut at the Soho Theater, Stalter did an impromptu riff on her own Top 10 of 2021, from Dolly Parton\\u2019s inclusiveness to the joy of private karaoke rooms. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"1. Dolly Parton\", \"I\\u2019ve listened to her every year, but especially this last year. She is the best celebrity because she feels, to me at least, that she just supports everyone. She\\u2019s the true meaning of a Christian because she loves God, and then she loves people, and she accepts everyone for who they are \\u2014 which is what we should have all learned this year, just to love each other and take care of each other.\", \"I\\u2019m somebody who grew up in church and doesn\\u2019t go now. I\\u2019m this bisexual person who still believes in God. Dolly doesn\\u2019t have any judgment on anyone else\\u2019s life, but still keeps some of the beliefs that she grew up with.\", \"2. The \\u201cFree Britney\\u201d Movement\", \"My friends and I are so happy for her. Everyone always knew that she didn\\u2019t have control over her life, so it was really powerful and exciting to see her now get control. We\\u2019re celebrating \\u2014 and it\\u2019s her birthday today! I bet she\\u2019s somewhere strange with her boyfriend, like dancing on a boat.\", \"3. Takeout\", \"I\\u2019d love to cook more, but I am addicted to ordering takeout or Grubhub or Postmates. In London, I haven\\u2019t been able to figure out their ordering food apps. It\\u2019s like moving to a different planet.\", \"4. Instagram Live\", \"When the pandemic started, I did a bunch. Every night I would do a different crazy-themed one. I\\u2019d be like, \\u201cOK, we\\u2019re going to Paris tonight.\\u201d And then I\\u2019d decorate my apartment with stuff that I could find that made it look like Paris. It was a way for me to connect to other people. I was in New York alone, really scared, and I felt like the only thing keeping me sane was doing that at night.\", \"5. High-Waisted Jeans\", \"There\\u2019s something really classic about wearing a good pair of high-waisted jeans. I like a plain shirt and jeans during the day, and then wearing this beautiful gown at night for a show. That\\u2019s really appealing to me. I think both are a little bit of structure that we didn\\u2019t have during quarantine, because we were wearing sweatpants.\", \"6. Time With Family\", \"My family is truly everything to me. When would we ever have spent this much time in the same house as when we quarantined together? It was really lifesaving to be laughing in the same house again.\", \"7. \\u201cThe Office\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s one of my comfort shows. I watched it a lot this year. It still holds up. The dinner party episode is my favorite. The boss invites people to come to dinner at his house and he\\u2019s being very passive-aggressive with his girlfriend. Either people think it\\u2019s the funniest episode of TV or they\\u2019re like, \\u201cI can\\u2019t even watch it.\\u201d It\\u2019s kind of my sense of humor.\", \"8. Dining in Restaurants Again\", \"Something I really was missing in quarantine was the feeling of being at a table with all of your friends and everyone\\u2019s laughing and you don\\u2019t even remember why and everyone\\u2019s talking over each other. It\\u2019s exciting that we are experiencing that again slowly. Every hangout feels precious and thrilling.\", \"9. Private Karaoke Rooms\", \"Last night I did a private karaoke room with a couple of friends, and we had the best time. It felt safe. We just sang for hours. It makes sense for it to be more popular now than it was. My friend was on a trip and he did a solo karaoke room. I don\\u2019t know if I would like that or not. I like to be in front of an audience, even if it\\u2019s three friends.\", \"10. Quarantine Animals\", \"I feel like everyone should have a pet now. I think it\\u2019s lifesaving. I have a Chihuahua who\\u2019s 15 years old. She was a family dog, but she came to live with me during quarantine and I am attached to her. Animals are so empathetic and they can tell when you\\u2019re sad and they just really calm you down. I\\u2019m afraid of when she passes because she\\u2019s so old. My sister is begging me to get another animal, but I feel like my dog doesn\\u2019t want me to get another dog. She likes to be alone with me.\"]","href_hash":"71024864583a11ecae1aa7c82e89adae"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"71024864583a11ecae1aa7c82e89adae"}},
