We are overwhelmed at the sheer thought of the day.\\\"\", \"So whether you're a lover or a hater of the Christmas shopping season, we've got five gift-giving ideas that should appeal to anyone.\", \"And many of them won't break your budget.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">You could buy\\u00a0local</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/80dcc48859fc46630a3edd3e2da58f12\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Shopping local is a win for you and the person you're buying for.(Pexels)</div>\", \"Small businesses struggled big time through the pandemic.\", \"So it's a no-brainer to put your money where your community is, and buy something special (and often unique) from a business near you.\", \"\\\"The benefits to the consumer is just feeling good about what they're buying. It can be a really well thought out and personal gift,\\\" says Eloise, who is also a principal consultant at the Australian Consumer and Retails Studies research centre.\", \"\\\"You've taken the time to go to a smaller store and think about what you're buying. You can actually slow down and put thought into that gift.\", \"\\\"Seeing someone open a gift they're not getting from anyone else is a great feeling as well.\\\"\", \"And another bonus? It'll often save you time and effort driving into the bigger centres or waiting for packages to arrive in the mail.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">You could make\\u00a0something yourself</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7485ca280d01fe4969a23ef0815acd3c\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Yes, it does take time and effort to make a gift yourself.\\u00a0(Pexels)</div>\", \"Now this one has the potential to divide us all.\", \"Is it a bit cheap to skip the shops and put something together yourself?\", \"No way, according to Eloise.\", \"\\\"I think it's really thoughtful and meaningful, particularly baking something this year,\\\" she says.\", \"\\\"Maybe it's a family recipe, or a recipe that the gift-giver will really enjoy.\", \"\\\"I think having that personal touch would be really lovely for Christmas this year. It adds real meaning.\\\"\", \"Jana also has a few good ideas for us all.\", \"\\\"Even repurposing something, regifting something or buying second-hand and recycling or upcycling are on-trend gift ideas for the 2021 festive season,\\\" she explains.\", \"The important thing to consider is what it is that you would enjoy making or regifting, and what the recipient would actually want to receive.\", \"Remember: a kiln-fired ashtray or a hand-knitted teapot cosy isn't for everyone.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What about cash, vouchers and experiences?</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/6cdca26b3aa2aacd03d21eb25e1b3ab8\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Experiences as gifts can be really unique and\\u00a0adventurous.(Supplied: Hannah Jessup)</div>\", \"This one's always been a great option for the person with everything.
