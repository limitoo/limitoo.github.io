The announcement comes as MLB and the players' union continue negotiations on a new collective bargaining agreement (CBA).\", \"\\\"On the key economic issues that have posed stumbling blocks, the Clubs proposed ways to bridge gaps to preserve a full schedule,\\\" Manfred said in a statement Wednesday. \\\"Regrettably, after our second late-night bargaining session in a week, we remain without a deal.\\\"\", \"The cancelations have now pushed the 2022 MLB season, which was originally scheduled to begin March 31, back at least two full weeks.\", \"While progress has been made in some areas, a key issue is now the creation of an international draft, CBS Sports reports. The league has been pushing for one while the Major League Baseball Players Association is adamantly opposed.\", \"The owners on December 2, 2021, locked out the players following the expiration of the last CBA. Negotiations on a new contract have been ongoing, but on March 1, Manfred announced the first six games of the season for each team would be canceled.\\u00a0\", \"After negotiations resumed, the owners initially set a soft deadline for Tuesday before more games would be canceled.
