But the young American team, which has had mixed success in building an identity through the first half of the 14-game qualifying tournament for the 2022 World Cup, seemed happy to run with them anyway, to use them as extra fuel.\", \"First came an unprompted response from Berhalter in his news conference the day before the game. He quipped that the Americans\\u2019 two wins over Mexico earlier this year had not done enough to win Mexico\\u2019s respect. His team would have to do more on Friday, he said. (The American fans had their say, too, booing Ochoa every time he touched the ball on Friday night.)\", \"Then came the players\\u2019 response on the field. The teams battled through a nervy first half, with goalkeeper Zack Steffen making two athletic saves to keep the Americans even. Then everything \\u2014 the teams\\u2019 attacks, the players\\u2019 emotions \\u2014 bubbled over in the second.\", \"In the latter of two on-field kerfuffles in the game, Mexico defender Luis Rodriguez menacingly grabbed wing Brendan Aaronson\\u2019s face from behind, prompting a long, ugly sequence of arguing among players from both teams. As the teams pushed and shoved, and as three yellow cards were shown, Pulisic was preparing to enter the field as a substitute. When he did, the rough gave way to the sublime.\", \"In the 74th minute, forward Timothy Weah received the ball on the right wing and calculated a sequence of dribbles down the edge of the penalty area, measuring out a pocket of space. Upon creating it, he thwacked an inch-perfect cross toward the mouth of the goal, where Pulisic flew in to head it past Ochoa to give the United States a 1-0 lead.\", \"It was Pulisic\\u2019s first touch of the ball in a competitive match for the United States since September, when he sustained a high ankle sprain during a qualifier in Honduras. As the sellout crowd of 26,000 roared, Pulisic paused to display his \\u201cMan in the Mirror\\u201d shirt before being mobbed by his teammates.\", \"Afterward, he sheepishly batted aside questions about his shirt, framing the episode as a little joke.\", \"\\u201cI think you guys know the message,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI don\\u2019t need to speak on it too much. It\\u2019s not a big thing.\\u201d\", \"Weah was much happier to elucidate. The night before the game, he said, he and defender DeAndre Yedlin asked one of the team\\u2019s staff members to draw the shirt for Pulisic to wear during the match.\", \"He painted the prank as a matter of pride.\", \"\\u201cBefore the game Mexico was talking a lot of smack, and beating them shuts them up,\\u201d Weah said. \\u201cWe have to continue to win games and continue to beat them, and that\\u2019s the only way we\\u2019re going to earn their respect.\\u201d\", \"After Pulisic\\u2019s goal, the Americans pressed for a second. When Weston McKennie delivered it in the 85th minute he prompted chants of \\u201cDos a Cero!\\u201d \\u2014 a reference to a famously recurring score line between the teams \\u2014 from the stands.\", \"And after the final whistle, the team\\u2019s staff conspired to play \\u201cMan in the Mirror\\u201d over the loudspeakers to accompany the team\\u2019s postgame celebrations as a final, cheeky send-off.\", \"It was a comprehensive win for the Americans, who outshot Mexico by 18-8, and it pulled the United States into a tie on points with their archrival at the top of the standings with seven matches to go. The top three finishers in the group qualify automatically for the World Cup next year in Qatar.\", \"But more than the points, the young and inexperienced American players may cull more intangible benefits from the experience: a petty slight, a few impish inside jokes, a night of joy and perceived revenge \\u2014 sports teams have bonded together over far less.\", \"\\u201cWe talked about how we thought they didn\\u2019t think they gave us enough respect, and we had to go out and earn it,\\u201d Berhalter said. \\u201cAnd I think we went out and earned it today.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"fee4140a46dd11eca853b312e00877a4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fee4140a46dd11eca853b312e00877a4"}},
