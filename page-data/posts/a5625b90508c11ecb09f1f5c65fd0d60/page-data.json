While the variant has yet to be detected in the United States, maintaining vigilance and safeguarding public health through inoculations, masking indoors and distancing, remains critical, he said.\", \"\\u201cI know, America, you\\u2019re really tired about hearing those things, but the virus is not tired of us,\\u201d Dr. Collins said. \\u201cAnd it\\u2019s shape-shifting itself.\\u201d\", \"Currently, much remains unknown about the Omicron variant, which has a concerning number of mutations not seen before. It is unclear whether it causes severe illness or is more transmissible than previous variants. There are also questions around whether Omicron limits vaccine\\u2019s effectiveness.\", \"Still, Dr. Collins stressed that inoculation remain the first line of defense, saying that there are \\u201cgood reasons\\u201d to believe, based on previous variants, that current vaccines will provide sufficient protection.\", \"\\u201cPlease, Americans, if you\\u2019re one of those folks who\\u2019s sort of waiting to see, this would be a great time to sign up, get your booster,\\u201d Dr. Collins said on Fox. \\u201cOr if you haven\\u2019t been vaccinated already, get started.\\u201d\", \"He also underlined other critical mitigation efforts, including indoor masking when around unvaccinated individuals and maintaining social distance, in slowing the spread.\", \"Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\\u2019s top infectious disease expert, delivered a similar message, sending a \\u201cclarion call\\u201d for vaccinations and boosters. It is inevitable that the variant, which has already been detected in several countries, will surface in the United States, Dr. Fauci said.\", \"\\u201cThe question is, will we be prepared for it?\\u201d Dr. Fauci said on ABC\\u2019s \\u201cThis Week\\u201d on Sunday morning. \\u201cAnd the preparation that we have ongoing for what we\\u2019re doing now with the Delta variant just needs to be revved up.\\u201d\", \"The discovery of the Omicron variant stoked widespread fear and alarm, and governments around the world announced border closures to travelers from South Africa and several related countries. \"]","href_hash":"a5625b90508c11ecb09f1f5c65fd0d60"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a5625b90508c11ecb09f1f5c65fd0d60"}},
