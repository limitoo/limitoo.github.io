Mexican officials have said that the emergence of the new variant emphasizes the need to supply more vaccines to poorer countries.\", \"\\\"It's not that the new variant is terrible,\\\" L\\u00f3pez Obrador said. \\\"It's that the poor countries of the world have been abandoned.\", \"However, while Mexican officials were previously against administering booster shots, they said they are developing a plan to give third shots to people over 60 in an announcement Tuesday, the Associated Press reported.\", \"\\\"It won't be long, we have the vaccines,\\\" L\\u00f3pez Obrador said, noting that plans for the boosters are still being made.\", \"The move for booster shots is unlike the measures L\\u00f3pez Obrador's administration has refused to employ, such as mask mandates, mass testing and travel restrictions.\", \"In August, Assistant Health Secretary Hugo L\\u00f3pez-Gatell said there was no scientific evidence to corroborate the need for booster shots, and they could be a ploy to increase sales for vaccine manufacturers.\", \"\\\"This proposal is being strongly pushed by the pharmaceutical companies, but it has been rejected by international organizations...because there is no scientific evidence indicating the need for booster shots,\\\" L\\u00f3pez-Gatell said at the time.\", \"Currently, only about half of the country's population, 126 million, is fully vaccinated. The death toll from COVID in Mexico is nearly 450,000.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942748/mexico-booster-omicron-elderly.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Mexican officials announced on Tuesday that they have reversed their previous position against giving coronavirus booster shots and are studying a plan to administer third doses to people over age 60. Above, people over 60 wait in observation after receiving their second dose of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine at the University Olympic Stadium in Mexico City on April 12, 2021. </div>\", \"The government also long resisted vaccinating minors, but recently relented and began administering shots to youths between 15 and 17 years old.\", \"Of special concern are the nation's teachers, almost all of whom got the CanSino Chinese vaccine in the spring. There have been suggestions that the single-dose vaccine's protection begins to wane.\", \"Mexico's test-confirmed coronavirus death toll stood at 293,950 on Tuesday, but because the country does so little testing, many people have died without tests. The government's own analysis of death certificates indicates the real toll is about 448,658.\", \"True to form, L\\u00f3pez Obrador said there would be dance music at a massive gathering he is planning in Mexico City's vast main plaza Wednesday to celebrate his first three years in office.
