I feel and fight them myself. I want to know when I can make travel plans without first making intricate assessments of risk, when I can stop ordering masks in bulk, when I can rip off the one through which I strain to be heard by the students I teach, when I can breathe free.\", \"And my initial reaction to the coverage last weekend of Omicron \\u2014 another new strain, another head-scratching and soul-abrading expansion of our medical vocabularies \\u2014 was a quiet version of the louder rage that I heard in comments from people all around me: How dare we be warned that there\\u2019s a potentially grave new threat without being told just how grave it is? What kind of epidemiological sadism is that? And what the hell are we supposed to do with it?\", \"We\\u2019re supposed to live in ambiguity, that\\u2019s what. We should have learned how by now. But we haven\\u2019t. We\\u2019ve let many key lessons of this pandemic go to waste. And for me, that\\u2019s sometimes the most frustrating part of all.\", \"There are teachable moments and teachable epochs, and since the beginning of 2020, we\\u2019ve been slogging and teetering through the latter. This historic pandemic came with urgent reminders and remonstrations about our individual and communal lives, but we haven\\u2019t heeded them to the degree that we should have, grown from them to the extent that we might have, wrung the fullest possible good from all the bad.\", \"At the outset and ever since, the coronavirus pandemic has demonstrated our interconnectedness, in terms of not just how much each of us needs from others but also how much our actions affect everybody else. One person\\u2019s recklessness is a dozen people\\u2019s possible sickness. One town\\u2019s irresponsibility is an entire state\\u2019s economy.\", \"And yet I\\u2019ve heard as much crowing and ranting about individualism as at any other point in my American life. And Republican leaders have gone from indulging to encouraging that mind-set, which is often just selfishness costumed as liberty.\", \"Some Republicans in Congress have threatened a government shutdown to prevent any federal funding of President Biden\\u2019s vaccine-and-testing mandate for large employers. Some Republican governors are just about venerating the unvaccinated. As Catherine Rampell noted this week in a column in The Washington Post: \\u201cAt least four states \\u2014 Florida, Iowa, Kansas and Tennessee \\u2014 have recently extended benefits to workers who are fired or quit over their employers\\u2019 vaccine requirements. For context, workers who are fired for cause or who quit voluntarily are usually not eligible to receive unemployment benefits. With limited exceptions, only those laid off through no fault of their own have been able to receive such aid.\\u201d\", \"Also for context, Republicans have generally blasted Democrats as being too generous with relief for the jobless. But if the cash is flowing to the inoculation-averse, great!\", \"The Americans resisting the jab aren\\u2019t the only stubborn ones. Many of the rest of us still refuse to accept what the pandemic has insisted we must. While the complaints are loudest on the right, I notice grousing across the political spectrum about some of the miscalculations that scientists have made or about their inability at various junctures, including the current one, to tell us exactly what we\\u2019re in for, precisely how to respond to it and what the timeline of the danger and its dissipation will be.\", \"An article last week in a generally liberal publication took a we-really-botched-it tone in asserting that the first two jabs of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines should have been spaced farther apart and advertised as links in a longer chain, so that we weren\\u2019t tossing this misleading \\u201cbooster\\u201d language around now. What a screw-up!\", \"No. What an inevitability. Science doesn\\u2019t usually figure everything out all at once; it\\u2019s a steadily growing body of knowledge, and its application, especially in the face of new circumstances, can amount to an educated guess, imperfect but invaluable. In the case of Covid, there was no awful screw-up. There was, instead, astonishing speed: These vaccines, powerfully effective, were developed and distributed in record time.\", \"So why aren\\u2019t we saved? Why isn\\u2019t this over? Americans press these questions, which assume a precise beginning and a definite end to things. But we\\u2019ve been told and we can see that the Covid story may not have an emphatic last page, after which we close the book and tuck it back into the shelf forevermore. It demands patience. It calls for sustained caution, in waxing and waning measures. It contains lingering uncertainty.\", \"But then much of life is caution and uncertainty. Much of life is lockdowns \\u2014 tiny ones, big ones, metaphoric ones. Much of life is educated guesses, and setbacks for which there\\u2019s no one to blame. Blame: That word more than any other ricochets around my brain, because the pandemic has so vividly underscored our quickness to pin our hardships on a limited cast of villains and list of decisions. It has also exposed the folly of that.\", \"There are indeed better actors and worse actors, but there is also muddle. That\\u2019s not epidemiological sadism. That\\u2019s just reality.\", \"It has been two weeks since our last prose-a-palooza, and that means a surfeit of nominations (and an extra-long segment this week). Even so, I\\u2019m compelled to include more than one snippet from A.O. Scott\\u2019s delectable review of the new movie \\u201cHouse of Gucci,\\u201d from which I could easily have plucked half a dozen.\", \"He writes that casting Jeremy Irons and Al Pacino as siblings \\u201cis a witty move,\\u201d because the actors \\u201cexist at opposite ends of the thermal spectrum. If Irons were any chillier, he would crystallize. If Pacino ran any hotter, he\\u2019d burst into flame.\\u201d (Thanks to Charles Whaley of Louisville, Ky., and Kay Birdwell of Austin, Texas, among others for nominating this.)\", \"And he has this to say about an especially vivid supporting player: \\u201cTo complicate the kinship network, and to prevent a potentially dangerous outbreak of understatement, Aldo has a son, Paolo, who fancies himself a fashion genius and who is played by Jared Leto. You\\u2019ve heard of ham? Leto goes full mortadella.\\u201d (Bob Rappaport, Arlington, Va.) Having seen \\u201cGucci,\\u201d I can assure you that \\u201cmortadella\\u201d is kind. Leto goes full soppressata and culatello as well. It\\u2019s an entire antipasti spread in one singularly grating performance.\", \"A separate review (of \\u201cDiana, the Musical\\u201d) by another Times critic (Jesse Green) also generated many nominations and, at one point, took a similarly meaty tack: \\u201cMusicals, like laws, are often compared to sausages: You don\\u2019t want to know what goes into them. In this case, you don\\u2019t want to know what comes out, either.\\u201d (Lester Raff, Riverwoods, Ill.)\", \"Sticking with Times culture coverage, here\\u2019s Kyle Buchanan on the actor Jamie Dornan, made famous by the \\u201cFifty Shades of Grey\\u201d franchise but poised to be seen differently, and maybe even pick up an accolade or two, after his work in the new movie \\u201cBelfast\\u201d: \\u201cThe last time Dornan went to the Oscars, as a presenter in 2017, his very presence was a sop to the viewing audience: Here was the handsome, frequently naked guy from an S&M blockbuster that most Oscar voters wouldn\\u2019t touch with a 10-foot whip.\\u201d (Peggy Sweeney, Sarasota, Fla., and Valerie Hoffmann, Montauk, N.Y.)\", \"Here\\u2019s Lisa Birnbach on the little-known fact that Clare Boothe Luce was an early and avid consumer of LSD: \\u201cThe discordancy is so intriguing \\u2014 like learning that Katharine Graham went to nude encounter sessions at Esalen, or Alan Greenspan was once in a Lynyrd Skynyrd cover band.\\u201d (Dan Weiller, White Plains, N.Y.)\", \"Here\\u2019s Alex Witchel, reviewing \\u201cThese Precious Days,\\u201d a new book of essays by Ann Patchett: \\u201cI considered the absence of paragraphs freighted with adjectives to be a mercy. I don\\u2019t care about the hue of the sky or the shade of the couch. That\\u2019s not writing; it\\u2019s decorating. Or hiding.\\u201d (Chris Warsaw, Carefree, Ariz.)\", \"And here\\u2019s Elisabeth Egan, reviewing the children\\u2019s book \\u201cLong Road to the Circus,\\u201d by Betsy Bird: \\u201cProps to our aptly named author, a librarian who pur\\u00e9es factual information into her story without a hint of spinach aftertaste.\\u201d (Sharon Haupt, San Luis Obispo, Calif.)\", \"In The Atlantic, Graeme Wood wrote an impassioned protest against \\u201cland acknowledgment,\\u201d which is the practice of \\u201cpreceding a fancy event by naming the Indigenous groups whose slaughter and dispossession cleared the land on which the audience\\u2019s canap\\u00e9s are about to be served.\\u201d It is \\u201cwhat you give when you have no intention of giving land,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cIt is like a receipt provided by a highway robber, noting all the jewels and gold coins he has stolen. Maybe it will be useful for an insurance claim?\\u201d Wood later added: \\u201cIf you enjoy moral exhibitionism, to say nothing of moral onanism, land acknowledgments in their current form will leave you pleasured for years to come.\\u201d (Brian Harral, Crofton, Md.)\", \"In The New Yorker, David Remnick sized up the reputation-cleansing new book \\u201cRepublican Rescue,\\u201d by Chris Christie, this way: \\u201cChristie is going to the literary laundromat because he may want to run for president in 2024. It\\u2019s hard to see how he has enough detergent.\\u201d (Michael Lavine, Durham, N.C., and Sherman Hesselgrave, Vancouver, Wash., among others)\", \"Also in The New Yorker, Paul Rudnick, writing as his movie-critic alter ego, Libby Gelman-Waxner, takes the measure of the \\u201cDune\\u201d star Timoth\\u00e9e Chalamet: \\u201cTimoth\\u00e9e\\u2019s been created from the most secret journals of tween girls everywhere \\u2014 he\\u2019s beautiful without any sexual threat, with his soulful hair (tween heroin), yearning eyes and the body mass of a poet action figure made from pipe cleaners.\\u201d (Cathy Kruchko, San Miguel de Allende, Mexico)\", \"In The Boston Globe, the book publisher David Godine told his interviewer, Mark Shanahan: \\u201cPublishing poetry is like dropping a rose petal off the rim of the Grand Canyon and anticipating the echo. It\\u2019s Dante-esque in the purity of its hopelessness.\\u201d (John O\\u2019Brien, Waterford, Maine.)\", \"And in The Washington Post, Kathleen Parker had this to say about Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, an intensely ambitious Republican: \\u201cWhy is it that the guys who look as though they\\u2019ve never so much as pushed a lawn mower are always the ones who want to saddle up and save the womenfolk?\\u201d (Hugh Ellis, Baltimore, and Tom Morman, Leipsic, Ohio)\", \"To nominate favorite bits of recent writing from The Times or other publications to be mentioned in \\u201cFor the Love of Sentences,\\u201d please email me here, and please include your name and place of residence.\", \"Out on the lawn there arose such a clatter.\", \"I mean the lawn across the street. This was on Sunday. I heard banging and thumping and rustling and huffing. Sure enough, it was St. Nicholas \\u2014 or, rather, work being done in his name. My neighbors were getting ready for Christmas. Mom, Dad and the kids were in a merry flutter, stringing lights, positioning decorations.\", \"\\u201cSorry,\\u201d one of them said when I went out to investigate. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be kind of bright around here.\\u201d\", \"Sorry? No need for that. They\\u2019re putting color into the neighborhood. They\\u2019re adding sparkle to it.\", \"\\u201cActually, I should Venmo you money for the electric bill,\\u201d I responded, sincerely. \\u201cI get the benefit with none of the investment.\\u201d\", \"Every year around this time, there\\u2019s a frenzied adornment of private homes and public squares, and every year there\\u2019s discussion of whether that adornment is sufficiently ecumenical and sensitive. It\\u2019s a fair conversation. It\\u2019s an important one.\", \"But amid the back-and-forth, something gets lost: the beauty and big-heartedness of the impulse \\u2014 the effort \\u2014 to embroider the world. To fashion enchantment for the sake of enchantment. To declare a special moment in time. To make that moment glow.\", \"I have long been a sucker for it: the tree at Rockefeller Center, both before and when I was a Manhattanite; the arches and tendrils of white lights over the cobbled byways of Rome, where I lived in my late 30s; the incandescent plastic reindeer on the roof of a house in the New York City suburbs that my mother would drive me and my siblings past when I was a child. Initially she insisted on it; then we did. Visiting and revisiting that house became a ritual as surely as opening presents did. I wish I could remember its address and figure out who owned it back then. I\\u2019d send them a thank-you note, for never letting us down.\", \"This newsletter is my thank-you note to my neighbors across the street here in Chapel Hill, N.C., and to my neighbor next door, whose enormous wreath, bejeweled with illuminated bulbs, hangs over her garage door, squarely facing the cul-de-sac. It\\u2019s there for her but also for the rest of us.\", \"Up the street and around the corner there are more lights, in more colors, and that surely won\\u2019t be the end of it. Some people get to decorating early, some a little later.\", \"And some not at all. I never rise to the occasion. So this is an apology as well as a thank-you. Right now I\\u2019m taking more from my little corner of the world than I\\u2019m putting into it. But I get the sense that no one around me is keeping score. That\\u2019s the big-heartedness I\\u2019m talking about.\"]","href_hash":"2c4af782539611ecbd3d811438073cbf"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2c4af782539611ecbd3d811438073cbf"}},
