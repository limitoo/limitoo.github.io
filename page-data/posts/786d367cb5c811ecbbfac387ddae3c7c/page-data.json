So I thought, 'There's no point, just leave it.'\\\" \", \"Hodge then had a second encounter with Maradona, according to Sotheby's. \", \"\\\"After the interview, I went down, behind the goal, to the changing rooms,\\\" Hodge said. \\\"As I went down, Maradona was walking with two of his teammates. I looked him in the eye, tugged on my shirt as if to say 'any chance of swapping?', and he came straight across, motioned a prayer, and we exchanged shirts. And that was it. It was just as simple as that.\\\"\", \"The blue shirt with stripes of lighter blue was a one-off, hastily assembled because the tops Argentina's team planned to wear were judged too heavy for the Mexico City heat.
