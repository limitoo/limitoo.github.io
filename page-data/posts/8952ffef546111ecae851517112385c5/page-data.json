That\\u2019s what happened at the Metropolitan Opera on Thursday, when Puccini\\u2019s \\u201cTosca\\u201d returned.\", \"In a fall at the Met that\\u2019s been full of momentous new works, intriguing repertory firsts and six-hour epics, this seemed on paper just an ordinary revival of David McVicar\\u2019s production. The soprano Sondra Radvanovsky was returning in the title role; the tenor Brian Jagde was appearing at the Met for the second time, singing Cavaradossi; the veteran baritone George Gagnidze (a late replacement for Evgeny Nikitin) was Scarpia; and Yannick N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin, the Met\\u2019s music director, was in the pit.\", \"Yet starting with the opening measures, chilling orchestral chords that represent the villainous Scarpia, this performance abounded in crackling energy, sure-paced suspense, romantic reverie and thrilling singing from Radvanovsky and Jagde.\", \"It was N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin who seemed to be inspiring these formidable singers and the orchestra. On Monday, the Met announced that he was withdrawing from a January run of Mozart\\u2019s \\u201cLe Nozze di Figaro\\u201d and taking a nearly four-week sabbatical from his conducting duties, including his directorship of the Philadelphia Orchestra.\", \"N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin has been maintaining a busy schedule this fall, including Met runs of two demanding contemporary works, \\u201cFire Shut Up in My Bones\\u201d and \\u201cEurydice\\u201d; in the announcement he said he needed some time to \\u201cre-energize.\\u201d Though it was a concerning decision, and it's disappointing to lose him for \\u201cFigaro,\\u201d if taking a short break will allow him to keep summoning the kind of energy he had for \\u201cTosca,\\u201d then so be it.\", \"He didn\\u2019t bring an unusual interpretive approach to Puccini\\u2019s familiar score. He simply led a splendid performance: rhythmically crisp, transparent, textured and colorful. While giving singers expressive leeway, he maintained shape and direction and favored slightly brisker than usual pacing. When, in Act I, Cavaradossi, trying to calm his jealous lover\\u2019s suspicions, turns to Tosca with a lyrical outpouring that begins their duet, Jagde and Radvanovsky sang with plenty of melting lyricism. Still, what a pleasure it was to hear the music \\u2014 thanks to N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin\\u2019s subtle control \\u2014 performed with a clear pulse, in a tempo that did not allow for any indulgences.\", \"Radvanovsky was extraordinary. Like Maria Callas, perhaps the 20th century\\u2019s defining Tosca, she uses the slightly grainy quality of her sound to exciting dramatic purpose. Her account of the great aria \\u201cVissi d\\u2019arte\\u201d was at once intensely anguished and surpassingly beautiful. The ovation went on so long it seemed Radvanovsky might be forced to break character and acknowledge it. But not this Tosca. One of the best actresses in opera, she made the character her own with affecting touches \\u2014 flirtatious and playful one moment, fearful and anguished the next.\", \"In Jagde she had a tenor who could match her soaring power. It\\u2019s hard to believe that he spent almost 10 years early in his career as a baritone. On Thursday his enormous, vibrant voice was capped by exciting top notes. Now and then I wanted a little more subtlety and elegance. But it\\u2019s hard to complain when you have a singer with such a big, beefy instrument.\", \"Gagnidze held his own as Scarpia, conveying the character\\u2019s malevolence but also his aristocratic disdain. Patrick Carfizzi as the Sacristan, Kevin Short as Angelotti and Tony Stevenson as Spoletta were all excellent.\", \"There are just four more performances this month with Radvanovsky, Jagde and N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin. When word gets out, tickets may be scarce.\"]","href_hash":"8952ffef546111ecae851517112385c5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8952ffef546111ecae851517112385c5"}},
