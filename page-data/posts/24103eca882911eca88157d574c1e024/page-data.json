The spokesman said that no injuries had been reported.\", \"The lot at 394 Gates Avenue was a construction site, the spokesman said. It was not immediately clear what kind of building was being built, or who owns the property. The spokesman described the construction site, several blocks north of the busy artery of Atlantic Avenue, as vacant.\", \"At least 25 units and 106 firefighters were on the scene, he said.\", \"Video of the fire on Twitter showed smoke rising far above nearby buildings and across the intersection, which appeared to be blocked off.\", \"It was unclear whether residents in the area were required to evacuate.\", \"At least 17 people, including eight children, were killed last month when a fire broke out at a 19-story apartment building in the Bronx. Officials described that fire as one of the worst in recent memory and said that the fire had been contained to one apartment and the hallway.
