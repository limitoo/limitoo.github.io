A production at the Royal Opera House in London in the 1990s made it to the end, but Jones\\u2019s irreverent staging bombed. Audiences booed, and the critics were savage.\", \"\\u201cIt was very turbulent,\\u201d Jones, 68, said recently. \\u201cThe whole thing. And I couldn\\u2019t live through it. I sort of gave up opera.\\u201d\", \"Crushed, the British director crossed the Atlantic and tried a musical. That show, \\u201cTitanic,\\u201d was plagued by technical glitches, but overcame them to become an unlikely Broadway hit, winning five Tony Awards in 1997. Now, nearly a quarter-century later, Jones is ready to try on the \\u201cRing\\u201d again. And if all goes according to plan, this time New Yorkers can judge whether he\\u2019s succeeded.\", \"The Metropolitan Opera says it will roll out Jones\\u2019s new \\u201cRing\\u201d starting in 2025, and will present full cycles by the end of the 2026-27 season. \\u201cThe crazy thing about opera is how far ahead we have to plan,\\u201d Peter Gelb, the Met\\u2019s general manager, said in an interview.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m a big fan of Richard Jones,\\u201d Gelb added. \\u201cHe is a director who is very attuned to the narrative of the operas that he\\u2019s doing. And his work as a theater director is very impressive. He brings all that work to the opera.\\u201d\", \"The stakes could hardly be higher for the Met, which spent $16 million on its last \\u201cRing,\\u201d directed by Robert Lepage. The New Yorker critic Alex Ross called that staging, which returned most recently in 2019, \\u201cthe most witless and wasteful production in modern operatic history.\\u201d\", \"Lepage\\u2019s central draw was a 45-ton machine that remained onstage throughout the cycle, with huge, rotating planks that were overlaid with video projections to conjure the world of the \\u201cRing,\\u201d from the depths of the river Rhine to the heavens. The glitch-prone contraption creaked, groaned and whirred, when it moved at all. At one point, the projections cut out, and, in place of rolling mountains, the Windows logo appeared. Particularly when the staging was new, about 10 years ago, the characters seemed secondary to the technical aspects.\", \"The Lepage \\u201cRing\\u201d was \\u201call about visual spectacle,\\u201d Gelb said; this time, the focus would be on \\u201cintimate, internal storytelling.\\u201d\", \"In an interview during a rehearsal break in October, Jones, who was born in London and worked his way up from a theater stagehand, said he focuses on the characters\\u2019 psychology and motivation.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m shamelessly Stanislavskian,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI do a lot of work on back story.\\u201d\", \"He conceded that his earlier London \\u201cRing\\u201d \\u2014 in which the Rhinemaidens, who possess the powerful gold around which the action revolves, wore latex fat suits and Wotan, the king of the gods, carried a \\u201cone way\\u201d road sign \\u2014 had been heavy-handed.\", \"\\u201cIt would read as rather bludgeoning now,\\u201d he said. His new \\u201cRing\\u201d will be more straightforward and \\u201cnarratively clear to a first-time buyer.\\u201d\", \"Yet spectators shouldn\\u2019t expect any \\u201cdumbing down,\\u201d Jones added. The \\u201cRing\\u201d is \\u201ca monstrous, pulsating, ambiguous, big, queer thing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd if anyone says, \\u2018Come into the tent, we\\u2019ll make it easy and explicable,\\u2019 well, that\\u2019s not for me.\\u201d\", \"David Benedict, a columnist for The Stage, a British theater trade newspaper, who has followed Jones\\u2019s career since the 1980s, said that Jones engages deeply and seriously with the works he takes on, but doesn\\u2019t stint entertainment.\", \"\\u201cHe is an extremely witty man,\\u201d Benedict said. \\u201cThe \\u2018Ring\\u2019 cycle isn\\u2019t a laugh a minute, but there is humor in there, and Richard will find it.\\u201d\", \"A sense of fun and a taste for the bizarre have been features of the two Jones opera productions that have been seen in New York, including a darkly amusing, morbidly campy staging of Humperdinck\\u2019s \\u201cH\\u00e4nsel und Gretel\\u201d that opened at the Met in 2007, and which has spent several seasons as the company\\u2019s family holiday offering. When Mark-Anthony Turnage\\u2019s \\u201cAnna Nicole,\\u201d which elevates the former Playboy Playmate Anna-Nicole Smith to a tragic heroine, played at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2013, Anthony Tommasini wrote in The New York Times that it was \\u201caudacious, entertaining, and, in its strange way, wrenching.\\u201d\", \"How much mirth Jones can wring from Wagner\\u2019s epic remains to be seen, and it will be some time before the full picture is clear. Natasha Haddad, a spokeswoman for English National Opera, said that company would roll out his \\u201cRing\\u201d as individual operas over five seasons, concluding in 2025; no cycles of the full work are planned for London. (The Met and English National Opera both declined to say how much Jones\\u2019s \\u201cRing\\u201d would cost.)\", \"To make matters a bit more complicated, the company is starting with the second part, \\u201cDie Walk\\u00fcre,\\u201d which had been commissioned as a stand-alone staging before there was a commitment to a full \\u201cRing.\\u201d Performed in English as \\u201cThe Valkyrie,\\u201d as is the tradition at English National Opera, the production, which runs through Dec. 10, will feature some elements familiar to Wagner traditionalists: breastplates, a spear and flames of magic fire at the end. (But, sorry, no horned helmets.)\", \"The staging is no 19th-century throwback, however; the action will unfold against stark, modern sets by Jones\\u2019s longtime collaborator, Stewart Laing. Jones was reluctant to characterize his overall vision for the production \\u2014 \\u201ca perilous thing to say to a journalist,\\u201d he said. But, he added, of his take on a work that has been variously seen as a parable of industrial capitalism, a feminist fable, an absurdist fantasia and much more: \\u201cIt\\u2019s not a politics-free zone.\\u201d\", \"Rachel Nicholls, the soprano who will sing Br\\u00fcnnhilde in \\u201cThe Valkyrie,\\u201d said that her character was loosely based on Greta Thunberg, the Swedish climate activist, and will be dressed in sneakers, shorts and a T-shirt, with a breastplate over the top.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019s a teenage girl, and things are either right or they are wrong,\\u201d Nicholls said of this Br\\u00fcnnhilde. \\u201cIf somebody tries to introduce her to shades of gray, she finds that very difficult.\\u201d\", \"In London, the cast \\u2014 conducted by Martyn Brabbins, English National Opera\\u2019s music director \\u2014 also includes Matthew Rose, Nicky Spence, Emma Bell, Brindley Sherratt and Susan Bickley. There will be other singers when the production reaches the Met, including the rising star soprano Lise Davidsen as Sieglinde. Gelb declined to give further information about casting, but said the \\u201cRing\\u201d would be a showcase for Yannick N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin, the company\\u2019s music director, who will be leading the work in a full staging for the first time.\", \"\\u201cOne of the hallmarks of the range of any new music director in a major opera house is, at some point, having a \\u2018Ring\\u2019 cycle to call your own,\\u201d Gelb said. \\u201cAnd I wanted Yannick to have a \\u2018Ring.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"A production currently unfurling at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin and directed by the avant-garde darling Stefan Herheim had been rumored for transfer to New York, and industry watchers were surprised by an announcement from English National Opera in February that its \\u201cRing,\\u201d and not the Berlin staging, would play at the Met.\", \"At a June news conference at the Deutsche Oper, the company\\u2019s artistic director, Dietmar Schwarz, told reporters that a transfer deal with the Met was never \\u201ccontract-ready.\\u201d Officials from New York traveled to Germany to inspect the production last year, he said, but the Met found it unsuitable.\", \"The Met will be hoping that Jones\\u2019s vision is a better match, especially after all the problems with Lepage\\u2019s \\u201cRing.\\u201d Like the ill-fated ship in Jones\\u2019s Broadway \\u201cTitanic,\\u201d which failed to sink at the first preview after the hydraulic set failed, Lepage\\u2019s machine also gave up the ghost at a key moment in the drama. At the end of \\u201cDas Rheingold\\u201d on opening night in 2010, as the orchestra\\u2019s brasses thundered and the strings shimmered, the device was meant to form the rainbow bridge that would lead the gods to Valhalla. But the set jammed in place, and the cast wandered forlornly into the wings.\", \"Stuff can go wrong with any show. In opera, with its dizzying ambitions, epic lead-times and viperish politics, the stakes are celestial \\u2014 and the scale and complexity of the \\u201cRing\\u201d ratchets everything up even further.\", \"\\u201cYou really have to bullet-dodge in opera,\\u201d said Jones. \\u201cYou have to check out the conductor. You have to check out the cast. You have to check out that the cast will be there, that they\\u2019re not going off to do \\u2018Traviata\\u2019 in Berlin for three days, or whatever.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYou have to do that yourself,\\u201d Jones said. But somehow, he added, sounding a note of hopefulness as he embarked on opera\\u2019s greatest saga: \\u201cYou pull it off.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4c51ffe843a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4c51ffe843a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}},
