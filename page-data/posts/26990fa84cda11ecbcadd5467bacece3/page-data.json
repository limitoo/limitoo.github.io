But at 160m in diameter, its size is typical among the known asteroids - rubble-like remnants left over from formation of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago.\", \"The mission targeted the moonlet rather than the asteroid itself because it was easier to measure the nudge to the system by targeting the smaller rock, NASA proximity working group and DART science operations lead Dr Olivier Barnouin said. The asteroid is about 1km across, he said.\", \"In a 20,000 year cycle it was possible an object the size of the moonlet would hit earth, he Olivier Barnouin told RNZ's Morning Report.\", \"\\\"It's not going to hit us any time soon, we'd have no risks in the next few thousand years.\\\"\", \"It was a \\\"little bit\\\" like the basic idea in the 1998 Hollywood blockbuster Armageddon but a totally different technique.\", \"\\\"Armageddon I believe was blowing it up which is not what we want to do, because blowing up an asteroid leaves you with lots of fragments that then you have a much bigger problem to deal with.\", \"The interior structure of asteroids is not well understood and the impact will give scientists information, he said.\", \"Scientists chose the Didymos system because its relative proximity to Earth and dual-asteroid configuration make it ideal to observe the results of the impact.\", \"The key to avoiding a killer asteroid is to detect it well in advance and be ready with the means of changing its course, NASA planetary defence officer Lindley Johnson told a media briefing this month.\", \"\\\"We don't want to be in a situation where an asteroid is headed toward Earth and then have to be testing this kind of capability,\\\" he said.\", \"The team behind DART, short for Double Asteroid Redirection Test, has determined that slamming a car-sized projectile into a Dimorphos-sized asteroid at 24,000 km/h should do the trick.\", \"The DART spacecraft, a cube-shaped box with two rectangular solar arrays, is due to rendezvous with the Didymos-Dimorphos pair in late September 2022.\", \"Cameras mounted on the impactor and on a briefcase-sized mini-spacecraft released from DART about 10 days beforehand will record the collision.\", \"Observations from ground-based telescopes and radar will then measure how much the moonlet's orbit around Didymos changes.\", \"The DART team is expecting to shorten the orbital track by about 10 minutes but would consider at least 73 seconds a success.\", \"The entire cost of the DART project will run about $US330 million, according to Lindley, well below that of many of NASA's most ambitious science missions.\", \"- Reuters / RNZ\"]","href_hash":"26990fa84cda11ecbcadd5467bacece3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"26990fa84cda11ecbcadd5467bacece3"}},
