Santos used the vouchers so that he could feed his family, as he was not eligible for government support.\", \"The Green Party's immigration spokesperson Ricardo Men\\u00e9ndez March, who has been advocating for the family, said he is delighted that Santos has just been granted a 12-month work visa after public pressure on the government.\", \"He said it seemed to be wrong when they found out that Santos and his family would be deported on Christmas Day.\", \"\\\"It does feel like a bit of a Christmas miracle when we were already preparing to visit Jeffrey at the airport on the day of his deportation which would have been heart-wrenching.\", \"\\\"At the same time, I also feel a deep sense of injustice that it took so much public pressure and continuous pleas for a situation that shouldn't have happened.\\\"\", \"Men\\u00e9ndez March said there needs to be more government support for migrants.\", \"Auckland Action Against Poverty has also been advocating for the family.
