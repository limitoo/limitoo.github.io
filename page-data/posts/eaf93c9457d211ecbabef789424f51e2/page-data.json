Bush administration.\", \"Criticism of Omarova centered around her birth in the Soviet Union, a paper she wrote while a student at Moscow State University on Karl Marx, and a paper published in 2020 suggesting a revamping of America's banking system.\", \"Her opposition was led by Republican lawmakers, as well as parts of the banking industry fearful she would promote stricter regulations on the nation's banks if she was confirmed.\", \"It also led to moments in Senate committee hearings like Pennsylvania Republican Senator Pat Toomey calling her ideas on banking a \\\"socialist manifesto,\\\" and Louisiana Senator John Kennedy saying he didn't know \\\"whether to call you professor or comrade.\\\"\", \"In the announcement accepting Omarova's request to be withdrawn from consideration, Biden maintained that she would have excelled in the position.\", \"\\\"As a strong advocate for consumers and a staunch defender of the safety and soundness of our financial system, Saule would have brought invaluable insight and perspective to our important work on behalf of the American people,\\\" Biden said. \\\"But unfortunately, from the very beginning of her nomination, Saule was subjected to inappropriate personal attacks that were far beyond the pale.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947350/joe-biden-saule-omarova-treasury.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden mark the 80th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor with a visit to the World War II Memorial, Tuesday in Washington.

Jon Tester of Montana said he had \\\"significant concerns\\\" about Omarova's nomination, including some of her opposition to a bipartisan law that eased some of the restrictions placed on banks after the 2008 financial crisis.\", \"Last year, Omarova published a paper arguing for an overhaul of the nation's banking system that would expand the Federal Reserve's role by allowing the central bank to hold consumer deposits.
