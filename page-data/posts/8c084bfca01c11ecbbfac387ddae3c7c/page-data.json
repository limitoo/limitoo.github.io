There was also \\\"no explanation\\\" for how the investigator, who no longer worked for ACC, even knew Kate had a sensitive claim in the first place.\", \"It directed ACC to issue a written apology to Kate, which she has received, and recommended the agency \\\"review and consider its safeguards for staff to access sensitive claims\\\".\", \"\\\"Surely accessing a sensitive claim, given its subject matter, should only be allowed in the rarest of circumstances and clearest of cases,\\\" it said.\", \"\\\"Unfortunately, there is no indication of why [Kate's] claim was accessed, which could have been avoided if a system was implemented that required ACC to input a clear explanation before accessing sensitive claims.\\\"\", \"An independent review by lawyer Linda Clark into how ACC staff access client information was announced in November after RNZ revealed a group of call centre staff shared, and laughed at, clients' injuries and personal information in a private Snapchat group.
