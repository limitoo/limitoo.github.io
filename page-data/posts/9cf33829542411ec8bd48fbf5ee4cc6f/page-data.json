But when Mr. Lewis had occasion to glance at the other Zack\\u2019s Visa card, he knew something momentous was about to happen.\", \"\\u201cI thought, this is going to be either destiny or disaster,\\u201d Mr. Lewis said of discovering that he had just met Zack Clark.\", \"Mr. Clark, 36, a children\\u2019s book author and editor at Scholastic, had offered Mr. Lewis, 35, his card before excusing himself to the bathroom at the Phoenix Bar. \\u201cYou\\u2019re not going to believe this,\\u201d Mr. Lewis said to Mr. Clark when he returned from that expedition.\", \"Disbelief soon gave way to romance. A second date at Santos Anne, a restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where Mr. Clark then lived, ended with a kiss. Mr. Lewis, an architect with Richard H. Lewis Architect, a firm founded by his father, met Mr. Clark\\u2019s pit bull mix, Zoey, soon after. That led Mr. Clark to have the same destiny-or-disaster feeling Mr. Lewis had experienced at Phoenix Bar.\", \"Except disaster was seeming way less likely by then.\", \"\\u201cI had adopted Zoey in my previous relationship, and my ex had not taken to the dog,\\u201d said Mr. Clark, who grew up in Jacksonville, Fla. But Mr. Lewis, a native New Yorker, couldn\\u2019t get enough of Zoey. \\u201cI thought, not only do we have this insane name thing, but he and Zoey really love each other,\\u201d Mr. Clark added.\", \"The pair took a turn toward the serious on Nov. 21, 2015, when Mr. Clark, hoping for a commitment, asked Mr. Lewis how he was feeling about the relationship. Mr. Lewis, who described himself as the less emotionally in touch of the two, was game. \\u201cWe had met each other\\u2019s friends at that point, and everything seemed to be meshing pretty well,\\u201d he said.\", \"[Click here to binge read this week\\u2019s featured couples.]\", \"At the start of 2016, Mr. Clark gave up his place in Williamsburg and moved into Mr. Lewis\\u2019s East Village apartment. A year later, Mr. Lewis was designing what Mr. Clark called their \\u201cdream house\\u201d in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where they now live. But before they moved in, the dream of a happily ever after started to feel shaky to Mr. Clark when Mr. Lewis woke up one morning in a fog of depression. \\u201cI just had this moment where I felt like, everything\\u2019s wrong,\\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \\u201cI can\\u2019t believe I\\u2019m still in this relationship.\\u201d\", \"Instead of breaking up, they administered their own version of talk therapy, acting on some advice a friend of Mr. Lewis\\u2019s had given him. \\u201cHe said, \\u2018You have to keep choosing your person,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Lewis said. \\u201c\\u2018As long as you wake up every day wanting to choose Zack again, I say stick it out.\\u2019\\u201d \\u201cWe did a lot of talking. I realized I did wake up every day wanting to be with Zack.\\u201d\", \"While Mr. Clark writes fantasy books for young readers by profession, he and Mr. Lewis both share a passion for adult fantasy fiction. \\u201cThe extent of my nerdiness extends to voraciously reading every bit of pulp fantasy out there,\\u201d Mr. Lewis said. Mr. Clark said he takes his self-described nerdiness to another level by regularly playing Dungeons and Dragons.\", \"In March 2020, Mr. Clark came home from a Dungeons and Dragons meet up and got a call that night about a fellow player who felt ill. Two days later, he and Mr. Lewis were sick. \\u201cWe started the pandemic as two Covid carriers,\\u201d Mr. Clark said. Their recovery led to a fruitful quarantine: On Nov. 21, 2020, Mr. Lewis proposed with a handmade card threaded with string. The message inside: \\u201cLet\\u2019s tie this knot.\\u201d\", \"When the two went to get their marriage license at the City Clerk\\u2019s office in Manhattan this fall, the question of whether they wanted to change their names came with guffaws. \\u201cThe person helping us cracked up,\\u201d Mr. Lewis said.
