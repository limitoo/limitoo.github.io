The day's headlines\\u2014real and fake\\u2014were written on blackboards in the pavilion and residents were tested on them each evening. Punishment for failing the test multiple times meant being assigned to the \\\"Learning Crew\\\" to do hard labor.\", \"Audio courtesy of the Jonestown Institute\", \"While residents worked in the fields or animal pens or scraped together meager meals in the kitchens, or taught and studied in the school tents, Jones slept in, recovering from drug- or alcohol-induced hangovers. Meanwhile, his aides played pre-recorded tapes of him talking over the loudspeakers to make residents believe he was awake. His ramblings veered from his thoughts on guerilla warfare to reading from textbooks on the structure of the United States government. Whenever his voice came over the P.A. system, residents were expected to stop talking and listen. His voice droned on in the background for much of the day, making it nearly impossible for residents to discuss their miserable situation or orchestrate those feelings into concrete actions, such as planning an escape.\", \"One of his top lieutenants, Harriet Tropp\\u2014who grew up in New York City and had a law degree from Berkeley\\u2014had criticized Jones about the constant blare of his voice. \\\"I have entertained the thought that you were deliberately using a known psychological technique of interrupting peoples' thought processes with specific information, so as to keep them in a kind of disjointed state \\u2014 a state that makes them both more receptive to information fed to them, and less able to do concentrated, (and often treasonous) things... whatever your reasons, it is driving me nuts.\\\" But her complaint had no impact; instead Jones upped the ante, announcing residents would be tested on the content of his disjointed \\\"lectures\\\" as well as the news.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931564/harriet-tropp-jonestown.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Harriet Tropp (left) with Jim Jones (center) in Jonestown, Guyana.

It requires much sacrifice. I'm preparing to make a great sacrifice. I know what it requires.\\\"\", \"Those ominous words were followed by his standard sign-off: \\\"I love you, very, very much.\\\"\", \"Julia Scheeres is an award-winning journalist and author.
