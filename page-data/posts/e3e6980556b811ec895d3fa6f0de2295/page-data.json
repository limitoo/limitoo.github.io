The prosecution rested their case on December 2 with the testimonies of Abimbola and Olabinjo Osundairo. The brothers are accusing Smollett of hiring them to help him orchestrate a false hate crime in Chicago in 2019. However, attorney Shay Allen claimed that the attack was real and was motivated by the brothers' dislike of the actor.\", \"According to the AP, the testimonies of the Osundairo brothers are the only ones to be heard by the jury thus far. A white person who allegedly helped carry a rope in the surrounding area has also not been located or identified. Legal experts predict that Smollett's only chance of overturning his allegations is to take the stand with his side of the story.\", \"\\\"The jurors might be thinking, 'Who does this guy think he is, not getting up and telling his story?'\\\" said local defense attorney Terry Ekl. He and other attorneys not affiliated with the case say that his testimony could help sway the jury's decision, as it is now his word against the Osundairo brothers'.\", \"However, former state appellate judge David Erickson told the AP that his testimony could be a double-edged sword. He warns that if Smollett says anything suspicious on the stand, major problems could be posed.\", \"\\\"You can't be penalized (by a judge) for not testifying,\\\" explained Erickson, \\\"but if he takes the stand and the judge believes he perjured himself, he can add (jail or prison) time.\\\"\", \"Smollett is charged with six counts of felony disorderly conduct for the false police report filed after the alleged attack. The counts derived from the six times he gave reports to three different officers.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946022/smollett-december-6.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Jussie Smollett arrives with his mother Janet Smollett (L) at the Leighton Criminal Court Building for his trial on disorderly conduct charges on December 6, 2021, in Chicago, Illinois.</div>\", \"The defense has begun calling witnesses.\", \"During the trial that started November 29, what emerged was the story of a television star who cast two brothers as his attackers, gave them dialogue to recite, and paid for the rope he told them to fashion into a noose and loop around his neck.\", \"The class 4 felony carries a prison sentence of up to three years, but experts have said if Smollett is convicted he likely would be placed on probation and ordered to perform community service.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946027/osundairo-brothers.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Attorney Gloria Schmidt Rodriguez, center, walks with her clients Abimbola Osundairo, left, and Olabinjo Osundairo, as they arrive at the Leighton Criminal Courthouse to testify in the trial of actor Jussie Smollett on December 2, 2021, in Chicago.
