Now the newly reopened dining room of the lavish restaurant chain\\u2019s New York branch also offers the glistening duck licked with blue fire tableside. More than mere floor show, the duck is seasoned with a chile-forward marinade. The flaming is said to impart extra crispness to the skin. Regardless, it is delicious, a whole well-burnished duck expertly carved, presented with accouterments, including sauces other than hoisin, and enough to serve four, $116. A second course is made with the meat left after slicing, minced with vegetables in a lettuce wrap, for a dish that\\u2019s more Cantonese than Beijing. As of now only five flaming ducks are available a night Monday through Thursday evenings to book in advance. The fireworks will be coming to the restaurant chain\\u2019s Miami location soon.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.
