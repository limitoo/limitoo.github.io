And at the Rainbow Room, a post-punk after party.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-26T10:17:36.000Z","content":"[\"It was a scene that would have shocked Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, a longtime patron of the Carlyle: a security team had been posted inside the hotel\\u2019s corridor to manage the crowds lining up for its elegant bar, Bemelmans. It was early Friday afternoon; way before cocktail hour.\", \"The security is a new development for the handsome, distinguished bar, named for the author of the \\u201cMadeline\\u201d children\\u2019s book series, Ludwig Bemelmans, who also painted its walls when it first opened in the 1940s. Known for its purist martinis, dark leather banquettes and live piano music (standards, jazz), Bemelmans has never had nightclub-level energy like this, said Dimitrios Michalopoulos, the manager. \\u201cThe line is a new phenomenon for us, something that started after Covid,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI tell people to come back later when we are less busy, but they don\\u2019t want to leave. They would rather wait.\\u201d\", \"Sometimes the line forms as early as 2 p.m. It\\u2019s a mix of regulars \\u2014 older Upper East Siders in tailored clothes or couples quietly celebrating an anniversary or a birthday \\u2014 and throngs of curious young people, dressed in jeans, beanies and leather jackets.\", \"\\u201cThe other day a group of young girls asked me what cocktail I was drinking,\\u201d said Jennifer Cooke, who runs communications for the Carlyle. \\u201cIt was a martini.\\u201d\", \"The young customers take selfies (no flashes allowed) underneath the gold ceiling or in front of the Steinway. They ask the servers where Meghan Markle and Prince Harry sat when they visited this fall.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a new crowd, and we have to adjust to meet everyone\\u2019s needs,\\u201d Mr. Michalopoulos said.\", \"Bemelmans is not the only old-school venue in New York City experiencing a surge in young patrons. The Palm Court at the Plaza Hotel is almost completely booked on the weekends for its afternoon tea, and many of the groups making those reservations are 20-somethings, said Leo Capispisan, a manager. A few blocks away, young customers are ordering Red Snappers (its signature Bloody Mary) in droves at the King Cole Bar, and earlier this month the 87-year-old Rainbow Room welcomed hundreds of alternative music fans for an album of the year party, featuring the English post-punk band Dry Cleaning. It was thrown by Rockefeller Center and Rough Trade, an independent label, which had recently relocated its New York City store from Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to 30 Rockefeller Plaza in Midtown.\", \"Not everyone is impressed with this newfound youth nostalgia for midcentury Manhattan. Daniel Kramer, a music fan who usually frequents venues like Elsewhere or Brooklyn Steel, was at last week\\u2019s Rainbow Room event. While fun, it didn\\u2019t have the grungy, cool feel of other evenings, he said, comparing the show to a wedding or a bar mitzvah. \\u201cI am always happy to check out a new music venue but this felt weird,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s, like, next to a Levain Bakery and F.A.O. Schwarz.\\u201d\", \"But for many young people, the traditional institutions of the city that survived the pandemic now symbolize a rich history and resilient spirit. Before the coronavirus, Julia Berry, of San Antonio, Texas, would frequent trendy cocktail lounges downtown and sports bars on the Upper East Side when she came to the city on business.\", \"Now she\\u2019s making it a point to visit more time-tested spots she\\u2019s learned about in New York-centric documentary films and movies. \\u201cWhen you look around, so many places are closing, and all these modern places are popping up,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt made me want to experience something special while I still can.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Michalopoulos, the Bemelmans manager, now spends much of his day making sure his regulars can get a table and the newer, younger customers are dressed appropriately. \\u201cThey can\\u2019t be in ripped jeans and tank tops,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe have very high established guests who expect some level of dress-code enforcement.\\u201d He\\u2019s gotten used to turning away large groups. \\u201cWe are a small bar,\\u201d he said.\", \"Still, Mr. Michalopoulos makes an effort to welcome the newcomers. After all, the reason bars like Bemelmans and King Cole have survived for so long is they appeal to generation after generation. \\u201cWe want young people to come to this old bar,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI meet them when it is their first time, and I\\u2019ve already seen many come back again.\\u201d\", \"Cassandra De La Eumenia will probably visit Bemelmans soon. After attending the Dry Cleaning show at the Rainbow Room, she said she had expanded her bucket list to include visiting as many retro bars as possible. Being on the 65th floor of 30 Rock \\u2014 with its Art Deco flourishes and skyline views, was a welcome change of pace from the trendy bars of Bushwick, Brooklyn, Ms. De La Eumenia said. \\u201cIt made me feel like, \\u2018Oh, this is why I live in New York City.\\u2019\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ea77afb24ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ea77afb24ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}},
