These are people that until just a few days ago had a perfectly normal life and in a matter of hours, everything is thrown apart,\\\" he said, adding \\\"that trauma and anguish is the most defining feature at the moment.\\\"\", \"\\\"We need this to stop because without the war stopping, people will just continue to pour out of the country,\\\" Grandi said. \\\"One-and-a-half million is difficult enough to manage even for relatively stable and prosperous countries in Europe.

But the effort collapsed\\u00a0twice after Russian forces intensified their attack, Ukrainian officials said, complicating the ability of more to escape the fighting, which is in its 11th day.\", \"Grandi said the U.N. and Red Cross, while inside Ukraine, are working to negotiate safe passage to the most affected places, such as Mariupol, but have not yet succeeded in getting the necessary guarantees and respect for the cease-fire.\", \"\\\"This is an extremely messy situation, all over Ukraine,\\\" he said, adding Russian forces are firing on civilians trying to flee. \\\"People are so afraid they just leave their homes.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"3f695fa49d7711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3f695fa49d7711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
