Despite not having seen or heard from one another since 2012, they immediately recognized each other.\", \"\\u201cWow, she was gorgeous,\\u201d said Mr. Han, 30, now a senior analyst at Tensile Capital, an investment firm based in Larkspur, Calif.\", \"\\u201cHe was even more handsome than I remembered,\\u201d Ms. Han said. But \\u201cthere was one problem. Early on Frank was asking me very long and sometimes personal questions, which made me a bit uncomfortable.\\u201d\", \"His queries did not stop her from continuing to talk to him, though. They began texting each other and, in July, 2017, arranged for a first date, which took place the following month at a bar in San Francisco.\", \"\\u201cWe were having a great time and then suddenly, Frank started asking me all kinds of questions again, as if he was interviewing me,\\u201d Ms. Han said. \\u201cHe asked me everything from the kind of ice cream I liked to what my favorite animals were to whether or not I wanted to have children.\\u201d\", \"Again, his questions did not deter her. Three days later, Mr. Han took Ms. Han to what is known in San Francisco as an ice-cream social, where ice cream lovers can enjoy samples of their favorite ice cream offered by vendors out of their trucks (Ms. Han prefers vanilla).\", \"As they were leaving, Mr. Han asked Ms. Han if she would be able to spend the rest of her afternoon with him, and when she wondered why he was asking, Mr. Han reached into his pocket and pulled out two passes to the San Francisco Zoo.\", \"\\u201cSo you could enjoy seeing all of your favorite animals,\\u201d he said.\", \"Ms. Han was stunned. \\u201cIt dawned on me as to why he asked me all of those questions,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe wasn\\u2019t interrogating me, all he was doing was asking me about some of the things I liked most in life so that he could get them for me. I was in awe.\\u201d\", \"The two were engaged Dec. 12, 2020, on a seaside cliff in Big Sur. He popped the question just after a heavy fog dissipated.\", \"\\u201cI proposed and she said yes,\\u201d said Mr. Han, \\u201cand that became the greatest moment of my life \\u2014 so far.\\u201d\", \"Perhaps an even greater moment came on Oct. 23, when Mr. Han and Ms. Han were married by Carol Ann Ross, a Universal Life minister, at the Four Seasons Hotel at the Surf Club in Surfside, Fla., before 100 vaccinated guests.\", \"\\u201cI just enjoy every single day with him,\\u201d the bride said of the groom two days after their wedding. \\u201cEveryday is a little different from the day before. It never gets old.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"51bff6fe43a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"51bff6fe43a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}},
