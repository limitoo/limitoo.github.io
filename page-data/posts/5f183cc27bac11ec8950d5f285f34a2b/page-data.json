I even want to say he played ... better than in US Open but maybe served a little bit worse, and that's where I took my chances. Almost like every game where I could break him I managed to do it.\", \"\\\"Pretty happy about my level. Served well. Didn't get broken, even if he had opportunities.

Every January you are here ... so I do think it's much more ups than downs with Australian crowd.\\\"\", \"Against Van de Zandschulp, the Russian saved all three break points he faced.
