If successful, the vaccine would be given to young healthy women at higher risk for breast cancer, which is known as a triple-negative.\", \"\\\"It's prophylactic, and it targets six different pathogens,\\\" Tuohy said when asked how this vaccine differs from previously seen treatments. \\\"We need a 21st-century vaccine program to develop the immune defenses and primary immune defenses against diseases we confront with age like breast cancer and ovarian cancer.\\\"\", \"These types of studies offer hope to women touched by cancer. \\\"I was 35 years old,\\\" Kristi Blair said when asked when she was diagnosed with cancer. \\\"My youngest was three at the time.\\\"\", \"Blair was diagnosed with stage two breast cancer just four years after her own mother died from the disease. She hopes that her four daughters will benefit from advances in science, like the potential vaccine.\", \"\\\"I'm just really grateful and feel hopeful. It's tangible hope,\\\" said Blair, who participated in another trial at the University of Washington. \\\"You are participating and advancing the research that does ultimately affect patients in the future and if not right now.\\\"\", \"The medical achievement \\u2014 that was unimaginable 50 years ago \\u2014 is now a possibility.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"f3e31bc0638711ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f3e31bc0638711ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
