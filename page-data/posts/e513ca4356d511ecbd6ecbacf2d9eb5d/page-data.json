While working on that \\u201cLast Supper\\u201d series, for the past three years, she was creating a companion piece, \\u201cFirst Meals,\\u201d requests by exonerated prisoners for what they wanted to eat when freed. She collaborated with the Innocence Project and the Center on Wrongful Convictions at the Pritzker School of Law at Northwestern University for this series. Now some of the \\u201cFirst Meals\\u201d done in various media will be displayed in her first gallery show in New York, in an exhibit, \\u201cAt Home with Family,\\u201d opening Wednesday. It will be on view until Jan. 22.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.
