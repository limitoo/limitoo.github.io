However, these orders will need to be approved by the court.\", \"The bank's list of wrongdoing includes charging fees to its dead customers, double-charging insurance policies and failing to adequately disclose its fees to financial advice customers.\", \"\\\"It is unprecedented for ASIC to file multiple proceedings against the same respondent at the same time,\\\"\\u00a0ASIC deputy chair Sarah Court said.\", \"\\\"However, these were exceptional circumstances. ASIC had numerous Westpac-related matters under investigation through the course of 2021, and we decided to expedite those matters for consideration by the court at the earliest opportunity.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Charging dead people and other breaches</div>\", \"The bank admitted that, over a decade, it had charged in excess of\\u00a0$10 million worth of advice fees to more than\\u00a011,000 customers for financial advice, even though they had already died.\", \"Another failure was Westpac sending \\\"duplicate insurance policies\\\" to more than\\u00a07,000 customers for the same property at the same time. This resulted in some customers paying for two or more policies unnecessarily.\", \"Westpac was also accused of seeking payments from 329 customers for premiums, even though they had not consented to\\u00a0entering into insurance policies.\", \"The regulator also took issue with the bank's\\u00a0subsidiary, BT Funds Management, charging its\\u00a0members insurance premiums that included commission payments.\", \"That was\\u00a0despite the fact commissions were\\u00a0banned under the Future of Financial Advice legislation.\", \"BT Funds is remediating in excess of\\u00a0$12 million to more then 8,000 affected members who were wrongly charged.\", \"Furthermore, ASIC claims that at least 25,000 customers of BT Financial Advice, Magnitude and Securitor \\u2014 Westpac licensees that\\u00a0are no longer operating \\u2014\\u00a0were ripped off by more than $7 million. This amount relates to \\\"contribution fees for financial advice\\\"\\u00a0that were not adequately disclosed.\", \"The corporate watchdog also accused Westpac of allowing\\u00a0around 21,000 deregistered company accounts to remain open.\", \"An\\u00a0alleged problem was that Westpac continued to charge fees on those accounts and allowed funds to be withdrawn from these accounts. However, those fees should have been transferred to ASIC or the Commonwealth.\", \"ASIC also alleges that Westpac sold consumer credit card and flexi-loan debt to debt purchasers with the wrong interest rates.\", \"These debt onsale rates were higher than what Westpac was contractually allowed to charge, which led to\\u00a0more than 16,000\\u00a0customers, who were \\\"likely to be in financial distress\\\", being overcharged.\", \"All up, ASIC is taking action against Westpac and its following divisions:\\u00a0Advance Asset Management, Asgard Capital Management,\\u00a0BT Funds Management,\\u00a0BT Funds Management No. 2, BT Portfolio Services,\\u00a0Securitor Financial Group and\\u00a0Magnitude Group.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Poor compliance culture' at Westpac</div>\", \"\\\"The conduct and breaches alleged in these proceedings caused widespread consumer harm and ranged across Westpac\\u2019s everyday banking, financial advice, superannuation and insurance businesses,\\\" Ms Court said.\", \"A \\\"common aspect\\\" of these matters has been \\\"poor systems, poor processes and poor governance\\\", which suggests as \\\"overall poor compliance culture within Westpac at the relevant time\\\",\\u00a0the deputy chair said.\", \"\\\"Customers are entitled to have trust and confidence in Westpac being able to deliver what it promises, without suffering financial harm. Westpac must urgently improve its systems and culture to ensure these systemic failures do not continue.\\\"\", \"Westpac's chief executive\\u00a0Peter King\\u00a0said his bank had \\\"fallen\\u00a0short of our standards and the standards our customers expect of us\\\".\", \"\\\"The issues raised in these matters should not have occurred, and our processes, systems and monitoring should have been better.
