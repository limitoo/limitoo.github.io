That's the message health authorities have been delivering to Tasmanians for weeks.\\u00a0\", \"It's now less than a month until Tasmania opens its border on December 15.\", \"\\\"COVID will enter Tasmania, we know that for a fact,\\\" Health Department secretary Kathrine Morgan-Wicks told ABC Radio Hobart this week.\\u00a0\", \"Modelling from the Kirby Institute shows that in the first 200 days after reopening there will be around 52,000 cases of COVID-19 and 87 COVID-related deaths in Tasmania.\", \"But where and when are the first outbreaks likely to occur and who is most a risk?\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Here's what we know</div>\", \"Despite having higher vaccination rates than the state's regional areas, Tasmania's cities and urban areas will likely experience the first outbreaks of the virus.\", \"Launceston, Newstead, Sandy Bay, Lower Sandy Bay, Dynnyrne, Burnie, Devonport and Spreyton have been identified as areas that\\u00a0have large pockets of unvaccinated

high number of unvaccinated people in Hobart's wealthier suburbs is a concern.(ABC News: Luke Bowden)</div>\", \"According to Epidemiologist Dr Katherine Gibney from the Doherty Institute, most major outbreaks on the mainland have been concentrated in cities.\", \"\\\"In New South Wales and Victoria, the big outbreaks that have happened have started in Sydney and Melbourne and then spilled over into regional areas,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It really just takes one infectious person to slip through the net to set off an outbreak.\", \"\\\"If you have a concentration of unvaccinated people and they are exposed to the virus then it will spread really quickly through that group.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"<img

border reopening plan.</div>\", \"The latest federal data shows the north-west city of Burnie, host of one of Australia's first major outbreaks of the pandemic, has one of the lowest vaccination rates in the state.\", \"Just over 74 per cent of its\\u00a015-and-older population is fully vaccinated.\", \"Ms Morgan-Wicks said health authorities were looking closely at those areas with a higher population density and which have large groups of unvaccinated people.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/84decbf7a05fe65f78965def03bc0503\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\",

Local Government Area (LGA), which includes the suburbs of Sandy Bay, Lower Sandy Bay and Dynnyrne, has the highest vaccination rate in the state, with more than 92 per cent fully vaccinated.\", \"Despite that, Ms Morgan-Wicks said around 1,800 people in those suburbs were yet to receive their first dose.\", \"\\\"That's a lot of houses, a lot of units that have unvaccinated people,\\\" she

major outbreaks.(ABC News: Damian McIntyre)</div>\", \"For Tasmania's population aged over 16, just under 92 per cent have had at least one dose, with 83 per cent fully vaccinated.\\u00a0\", \"By the time the border opens, Premier Peter Gutwein wants 90 per cent of the population aged 12 and over to be fully vaccinated.\", \"It's a target he's confident we'll still be able to meet, but regional

\\u2014\\u00a0has the lowest rate in terms of both first and second doses.\\u00a0\", \"Just under 70 per cent of its 5,300 residents aged over 15 are fully vaccinated.\", \"It means it's almost certain Kentish, along with a number of other LGAs, will be well below the 90 per cent target when the state as a whole reaches the milestone.\", \"But infectious diseases expert Professor Robert Booy from the University of Sydney said outbreaks of concern in regional areas could take months to develop.\", \"\\\"Areas with low vaccination uptake against COVID will be at greater risk but it will take time,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"In rural areas the level of human contact is less frequent and less intense so it may take some months.\", \"\\\"It's likely the build up of infection in the cities will eventually lead to problems in the country areas.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Are certain age groups at higher risk?</div>\", \"Health authorities say there are some age brackets where low vaccination rates are of a concern.\\u00a0\", \"For Tasmanians aged 16 to 24, only 67 per cent are fully vaccinated. For the 12 to 15 age group, less than 50 per cent have had both doses.\", \"As the vaccination rollout in Australia has progressed, Dr Gibney says young people have driven the spread of the virus.\", \"\\\"As older age groups have been vaccinated, their contribution to overall COVID numbers has really decreased.\", \"\\\"It is very much children through to young adults who are the bulk of cases on the mainland.\\\"\", \"Professor Booy said young people in Tasmania could become the \\\"drivers\\\" and \\\"engine\\\" of the spread of the virus.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"If you have a large proportion of your teenagers and young adults unvaccinated, they can catch infection and they can spread it easily,\\\" he said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">When will the first outbreak happen?</div>\", \"Both Professor Booy and Dr Gibney agree COVID will arrive in Tasmania soon after the border reopens, but it is too hard to predict when a major outbreak could hit.\", \"Millions of dollars worth of bookings have been made for the Spirit of Tasmania since the announcement of the border reopening date, and Hobart Airport is expecting its busiest December and January yet.\", \"\\\"Tasmania being safe from the virus will come to a partial end because of the border opening up,\\\" Professor Booy said.\", \"\\\"It will come at a low level to begin with. The seeding of the virus will be slow but steady.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What can Tasmanians do to prepare?</div>\", \"Along with vaccination, social distancing, hand washing and the use of QR check-in codes will offer some level of protection to Tasmanians when borders reopen, according to Professor Booy.\", \"\\\"All those common sense measures that keeps your exposure to other humans at a distance do work,\\\" he said.\", \"Dr Gibney said a high vaccination rate was the state's best level of protection.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"One of the main advantages of having high vaccination rates is that when COVID arrives and people catch it, the hospital system and ICU beds will be protected and won't be overwhelmed as they have been elsewhere,\\\" she said.\", \"Unions and health groups have raised concerns about extra pressures on an already stretched health system.\", \"The state government has said the health system was in good shape to deal with COVID-19 cases, with around 400 hospital beds, 114 ICU beds and 300 ventilators available.\\u00a0\", \"Perhaps testing times ahead in more ways than one.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/64a3f02329fb5b1ca96f4b9a262542a3\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> WA's COVID-19 reopening roadmap</div>\"]","href_hash":"d609dc7c47dc11ecac0dd79e000c080c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d609dc7c47dc11ecac0dd79e000c080c"}},
