(He\\u2019s only in second grade, after all.) So when his grandmother took him to the Lake Hazel branch of the Ada Community Library in Boise at the end of December, he slipped the sole copy of his book onto a shelf containing fiction titles.\", \"\\u201cI had to sneak past the librarians,\\u201d said Dillon, who says \\u201cli-berry\\u201d instead of \\u201clibrary.\\u201d\", \"Over the next month, a series of circumstances made the book one of the library\\u2019s most sought-after titles and also inspired children in Boise to write their own stories.\", \"The book, \\u201cThe Adventures of Dillon Helbig\\u2019s Crismis\\u201d by the author \\u201cDillon His Self,\\u201d had drawn so much attention by the end of January that 56 people were on the waiting list to check it out, said Alex Hartman, the manager of the library branch.\", \"If every person kept the book for four weeks, the maximum borrowing time, the last person on the list would have to wait more than four years to read Dillon\\u2019s tale.\", \"Here\\u2019s how it happened:\", \"The night after Dillon surreptitiously left his book on that library shelf, he came clean to his parents, his mother, Susan Helbig, said. They called the library, thinking they could pick it up from the lost and found. But the librarians were so charmed by the book that they played along with Dillon\\u2019s stunt.\", \"\\u201cIt deserves a spot on our library shelves,\\u201d Mr. Hartman said on Monday. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a good story.\\u201d\", \"The librarians entered the book in their catalog system, but left the publisher category blank, he said. They also moved it out of the fiction section and set it alongside the graphic novels, since it has so many page-length illustrations.\", \"As for the amount of spelling and grammar errors in the book, \\u201cI would say those would be numerous,\\u201d he said.\", \"For example, in \\u201cChaptr 1,\\u201d Dillon writes, \\u201cONe Day in wintr it wus Crismis!\\u201d\", \"In his \\u201cCrismis\\u201d tale, Dillon, the protagonist and the author, goes on a time-traveling adventure after the star on the tree explodes.\", \"\\u201cSanta comes,\\u201d he said, explaining the next part of the plot. After that, Dillon comes across five trees, and one of them \\u201cwas like a tree portal.\\u201d\", \"The portal takes him back in time to the \\u201cfirst Thanksgiving\\u201d in 1621, a date that he had to confirm with his mother, Ms. Helbig said.\", \"\\u201cHis imagination is just incredible,\\u201d she said.\", \"Dillon has been writing \\u201ccomic-style books\\u201d since he was 5, his mother said, but this one is certainly his most successful. The library gave him its first-ever \\u201cWhoodini Award\\u201d for best young novelist, an award they created for him.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s been quite the whirlwind,\\u201d Ms. Helbig said.\", \"After news of Dillon\\u2019s literary triumph was reported in January by The Idaho Press and KTVB, a television station in Boise, his classmates told him that he had inspired them to write their own books.\", \"\\u201cThey said, \\u2018It was really cool; I wish I was you,\\u2019\\u201d he said.\", \"Children have also told Mr. Hartman, the library manager, that they, too, want to write books for the library. A local author, Cristianne Lane, has offered to work with Dillon to create a children\\u2019s writing workshop at the branch.\", \"In addition to the workshop, other big things could be ahead for the young author: Publishers have contacted the library about officially publishing the book, Mr. Hartman said. The librarians are also planning to make extra copies of the book.\", \"\\u201cWe hope that others kids are inspired by Dillon to share their stories,\\u201d Mr. Hartman said.\", \"Ms. Helbig said that, amid of all the attention her son has received, he has decided he wants to become an author.\", \"But he has other plans, too.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m going to stop writing when I\\u2019m 40,\\u201d Dillon said.\", \"And then what?\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m going to make games,\\u201d he said.\", \"Before he reaches middle age, Dillon has exciting plans for a sequel: \\u201cMy next book,\\u2019\\u2019 he said, \\u201cis going to be called \\u2018The Jacket-Eating Closet,\\u2019 based on actual events.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"80269cce834a11eca1e3bb5fc15ebb3f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"80269cce834a11eca1e3bb5fc15ebb3f"}},
