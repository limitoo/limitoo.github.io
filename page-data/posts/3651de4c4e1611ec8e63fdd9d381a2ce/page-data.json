The boat sank soon after setting off from the coast of northern France, packed with people hoping to make the short, but very dangerous 21-mile crossing to England. It's a gamble that has claimed dozens of lives this year \\u2013 and one that\\u00a0more people have taken and continue to take\\u00a0in 2021 than ever before.\", \"The capsize on Wednesday was the biggest single loss of migrant life in the Channel, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, since record keeping began in 2014, according to the International Organization for Migration.\", \"As CBS News correspondent Imtiaz Tyab reports, it is a journey that only the most desperate people would even consider making on a tiny, overloaded boat.\", \"Images taken on Wednesday, before the capsize was discovered by a French fishing crew, show at least one boat being pushed out to sea as French police look on.\", \"Men, women and children board inflatable dinghies every day to attempt to cross the English Channel before the bitterness of winter sets in.\", \"Five women and a little girl were among those killed in Wednesday's disaster.\", \"\\\"There were bodies floating in the water, it was very shocking to see,\\\" said French lifeboat rescuer Charles Devos. \\\"We recovered six people.

But British-French relations have been difficult since the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, and there's a trust deficit.\", \"Migrant rights groups, meanwhile, say it's the French and British governments who helped create this crisis \\u2013 France, with the brutal conditions in its migrant camps, and Britain by\\u00a0limiting the legal routes for asylum seekers\\u00a0to enter the U.K.\", \"Combined, they are circumstances that push the most vulnerable people, fleeing war, poverty and famine, to risk it all.\", \"More migrant boats were seen leaving the French coast on Thursday morning.\", \"Five suspected traffickers have been arrested in France in connection with the sinking on Wednesday, but until Britain and France can come up with meaningful solutions to the crisis, the grim reality is that more people will likely lose their lives trying to cross the Channel for what they hope is a better life.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"3651de4c4e1611ec8e63fdd9d381a2ce"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3651de4c4e1611ec8e63fdd9d381a2ce"}},
