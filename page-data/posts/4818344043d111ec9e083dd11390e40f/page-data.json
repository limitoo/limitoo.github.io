With slices of lemon to soothe her throat.\", \"Bushnell, 62, broke out in the mid \\u201990s as a sex and relationship columnist for The New York Observer, centering her columns on a character named Carrie Bradshaw, a chic stand-in for Bushnell herself. She collected those pieces into a spiky 1996 book, \\u201cSex and the City,\\u201d autofiction before it was cool. HBO premiered a series adaptation two years later. It ran for six seasons. Two movies followed, as did licensed fragrances, bus tours and candy.\", \"Bushnell\\u2019s life diverged from Carrie\\u2019s. She turned her talents to fiction. Her marriage to the ballet dancer Charles Askegard, whom she nicknamed Mr. Bigger, ended in divorce. After fleeing Manhattan for the Hamptons and despaired of dating, she wrote another novel, \\u201cIs There Still Sex in the City?\\u201d\", \"I couldn\\u2019t help but wonder: Has Bushnell adapted that novel into a one-woman show? She has. In \\u201cIs There Still Sex in the City?,\\u201d which begins previews at the Daryl Roth Theater on Saturday, Bushnell makes her stage debut, tracing her life \\u2014 like a fever chart plotted in tasteful pink lipstick \\u2014 from her Connecticut childhood to her party girl pinnacle to marriage, divorce and beyond. Is this fiction, autofiction, memoir?\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not trying to play a character,\\u201d she told me. \\u201cBut I have a feeling that maybe I am a character. Like kind of naturally.\\u201d\", \"Bushnell arrived at the Carlyle, a few blocks from her Upper East Side apartment, in a sensible gray sweater dress and a fresh pair of absolutely senseless shoes \\u2014 red satin Manolo Blahniks with diamant\\u00e9 buckles \\u2014 that she walked in with impossible ease. (A line I\\u2019d heard during the rehearsal for the show earlier that day: \\u201cDo I have a shoe obsession like Carrie Bradshaw? No. Carrie Bradshaw has a shoe obsession because of me.\\u201d) In person, she has the wide-set eyes and porcelain poise of a Meissen figurine and conversation as polished as the Carlyle\\u2019s silverware.\", \"As a child in Glastonbury, Conn., Bushnell acted sporadically, though she spent most of her free time scribbling short stories and riding her horses. When she moved to New York at 19 \\u2014 \\u201cwild and full of philosophies,\\u201d she said \\u2014 she flirted with acting (that\\u2019s her frisky verb), studying at HB Studio.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t think I was really very good at it, which I probably shouldn\\u2019t say,\\u201d she said.\", \"Besides, she never loved it the way that she loved writing. \\u201cI really felt like, I\\u2019ve got to be a writer, or I\\u2019m going to die,\\u201d she said. So she wrote, signing away the theatrical rights to each new book. But a few years ago, when apportioning the rights to \\u201cIs There Still Sex in the City?,\\u201d she decided to hold onto the theatrical rights for herself.\", \"She wasn\\u2019t sure what to do with them. But then she met a talent manager, Marc Johnstone, at the Carlyle, which Bushnell seems to treat as a bonus living room. He had helped to create a touring show for his client, the composer and accidental reality TV star David Foster. He thought that he could do the same for her.\", \"So again she wrote, this time in monologue form, repurposing stories from her books, her life, her lecture tours. That first draft ran about 200 pages. To shape up the script, Johnstone and his fellow producer, Robyn Goodman, introduced Bushnell to the director and choreographer Lorin Latarro.\", \"In June, the show had a tryout at Bucks County Playhouse in New Hope, Penn. Set in a near-replica of Bushnell\\u2019s apartment, which includes her actual sofa, her actual carpet and her actual poodles, it unfurls as a chatty girl\\u2019s night.\", \"And though Bushnell is a practiced hostess, those first performances were unnerving. \\u201cIt was like, Oh, God, this is really acting,\\u201d Bushnell said. Gradually the script shortened and Bushnell relaxed and improved.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019s really miraculous,\\u201d Goodman told me in a phone interview. \\u201cShe was determined to understand acting and she\\u2019s done it.\\u201d\", \"Understanding meant hiring an acting coach and a voice coach, and committing to Pilates three times a week to build up her core strength for the show. Which is to say that Bushnell takes the work of rehearsal and performance seriously \\u2014 hence the afternoon Earl Grey \\u2014 comparing it to the dressage drills she practiced as a girl, repeating the same small moves over and over until she gets them right.\", \"\\u201cI have that aspect of my personality where I\\u2019ll put in hours and hours and hours into something just to try to make it better,\\u201d she said.\", \"I joked that this made her seem not entirely like a Carrie. \\u201cI don\\u2019t even know what a Carrie is,\\u201d she said.\", \"HBO is busy reviving Carrie with a new series, \\u201cAnd Just Like That\\u2026,\\u201d which follows most of the original \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d characters into their 50s, but Bushnell is not involved. In several places, her stage show emphasizes differences between Bushnell and Carrie, but those differences pertain to matters of men and fashion, not ideology or temperament. Carrie is flighty; Bushnell has her feet, if not her heels, firmly on the ground. While Carrie\\u2019s story ultimately became a romance, Bushnell maintains extreme ambivalence about romantic relationships.\", \"Her feminism, which lurks at the margins of her books, emerges cogently and unashamedly in conversation. She speaks persuasively about the deforming effects of patriarchal power and the need for, as she put it, an equality of \\u201cmind, body and earning potential\\u201d \\u2014 a nice surprise from a woman once known for table dancing at Da Silvano.\", \"A Page Six darling, Bushnell has rarely received much credit for her politics, her obvious intelligence, her psychological acuity. (Let\\u2019s just say that when I read her most recent book I found a few pages that described my foundered marriage so entirely that I had to text them to half a dozen friends and then lie down for a while.) And this is just ever so slightly on purpose.\", \"She recalled that as a child, angry about the inequities of gender, her father sat her down and told her that while she had ideas that people would need to hear, no one would listen if she yelled them. \\u201cSo I learned very early on to coat everything in a candy-colored, sugarcoated message. Because that\\u2019s how you move society,\\u201d she said.\", \"Latarro, during a pre-rehearsal chat, agreed. \\u201cShe writes feminism in a way that makes it palatable for a lot of women who have internalized misogyny and a lot of men who think everybody looks great in their sexy dresses.\\u201d\", \"The stage show, rich in quip and pop song snippet, is candy-colored, too \\u2014 a chocolate martini with a sugared rim. Bushnell is recognizably herself, at least in the hour of rehearsal I saw, but buffed and glossed: a person repurposed as a fun and fabulous character. I asked her why she hadn\\u2019t attempted something sharper, more bitter. Earlier drafts had darker elements, she said. But those were cut.\", \"\\u201cThe message that I\\u2019m delivering is probably risky enough as it is. I sit there and say, \\u2018I\\u2019m not married, I don\\u2019t have kids. And I\\u2019m grateful.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Not that she wants to bother her audience with too many messages, which is probably why the producers have created a post-show nightspot, the Candi Bar, in the basement of the Daryl Roth.\", \"\\u201cCosmos all night!\\u201d Johnstone had enthused in a phone interview.\", \"Bushnell, as she drank her tea, put it more practically. \\u201cPeople just want to feel good,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd I want to give them a good time.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4818344043d111ec9e083dd11390e40f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4818344043d111ec9e083dd11390e40f"}},
