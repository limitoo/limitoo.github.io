The company's new coverage comes as more state pass laws that effectively ban legal abortions.\", \"Yelp's health insurance already covered abortion care, but next month the company will also provide travel benefits for U.S. employees and their dependents who need to travel out of state to access these services.\", \"\\\"We've long been a strong advocate for equality in the workplace, and believe that gender equality cannot be achieved if women's healthcare rights are restricted,\\\" Yelp's Chief Diversity Officer Miriam Warren said in a statement. \\\"As a remote-first company with a distributed workforce, this new benefit allows our U.S. employees and their dependents to have equitable access to reproductive care, regardless of where they live.\\\"\", \"Yelp's announcement on Tuesday came on the same day Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt signed a bill into law that makes it a felony to perform an abortion, punishable by up to 10 years in prison, with exceptions only for abortions performed to save the life of the mother.\", \"Oklahoma is just the latest Republican-led state to pass such a law, as the U.S. Supreme Court considers a Mississippi case that could sharply curtail or overturn Roe v.
