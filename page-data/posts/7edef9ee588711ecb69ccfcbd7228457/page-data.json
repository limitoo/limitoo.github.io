given Medsafe approve the Pfizer vaccine for children.\", \"\\\"At this point, we're still awaiting their confirmation that they've got all the evidence and that they're comfortable approving the paediatric dose and that is a critical factor and we don't want them to unduly rush that.\\\"\", \"New government research shows a third of caregivers are hesitant about getting their young children vaccinated.\", \"Meanwhile, figures show just over half of the M\\u0101ori population would be happy to get their children to be vaccinated.\", \"Hipkins said it was critical the technical advisory group completed thorough analysis of the paediatric vaccine to ensure all parents are confident getting their children vaccinated.\", \"\\\"It needs to be very robust, it needs to be evidence based so I know that Medsafe are doing a very thorough job of reviewing all of the evidence being presented by Pfizer including the international evidence.\", \"\\\"It's really important that we go into this eyes wide open and people know exactly what the evidence is that has been behind our decision to use [the paediatric vaccine] assuming that's where all of the evidence lands up,\\\" he said.\", \"He expected a shipment of the Pfizer vaccine would arrive shortly after the approval of the vaccine for children.\", \"Hipkins said with the current level of supply there would be less of a need to prioritise certain areas or populations, as was seen in the adult vaccine rollout.\", \"\\\"We're expecting to get quite big deliveries [of vaccine] relative to the size of the population that we're trying to vaccinate, we're expecting to get them quite early.\\\"\", \"\\\"That means we won't have to do the prioritisation that we had to with the adult rollout, what that does also mean is that we can target our extra energy ... to lean into those areas where we know it will be harder and it will take longer.\\\"\", \"On mini-MIQs, Hipkins said District Health Boards had been planning throughout the year to ensure they were able to safely isolate Covid-19 cases in their communities over summer.\", \"Yesterday, Queenstown mayor Jim Boult raised concerns that just two motel units have been set aside in Queenstown for people who might need help to isolate with Covid despite tens of thousands of Aucklanders about to hit town.\", \"Boult worried there would not be sufficient capacity to isolate people holidaying in town.\", \"\\\"I think there's more capacity than that that they have identified that they could use in the event they need to draw on it,\\\" Hipkins said.\", \"He said the ministry did have the capacity to relocate self-isolating travellers to a managed isolation facility if necessary.\"]","href_hash":"7edef9ee588711ecb69ccfcbd7228457"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7edef9ee588711ecb69ccfcbd7228457"}},
