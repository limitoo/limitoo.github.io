On Sunday, the country\\u2019s president tested positive for the virus. For an update on South Africa, I spoke to Lynsey Chutel, who covers southern Africa for The Times.\", \"What does the latest science out of South Africa tell us about Omicron?\", \"There have been two big developments in the last few days.\", \"In the last week, thanks to a study by the Africa Health Research Institute in Durban, we now have some sense how the Pfizer vaccine performs against the Omicron variant. Lab experiments showed that, unfortunately, antibodies produced in people who are vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine were less effective in preventing the spread of Omicron than other variants. On the plus side, the vaccine still seemed to show some protection against severe illness from Covid-19.\", \"That seems to be a recurring theme in covering the new variant\\u2019s development in South Africa: There has been a complex mix of alarming trends, like the hospitalization of children, and then some really hopeful developments. For a few days, it seemed as though we\\u2019d reached the peak of the fourth wave and \\u2014 as is the nature of a pandemic in the 21st century \\u2014 there was a lot of optimistic tweeting. However, the National Institute of Communicable Diseases explained this was likely because of a lag in reporting. It\\u2019s a lesson in drawing hasty conclusions from daily data, and a reminder of the constant refrain since the detection of the Omicron variant. It\\u2019s still too soon to draw any concrete conclusions.\", \"What do hospitalizations in the country tell us about the severity of disease caused by Omicron?\", \"Hospitalizations have brought in a little bit of hopeful data, in that they have not kept up with infections. In fact, Dr. Michelle Groome, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of Communicable Diseases, said that she was seeing what she called a \\u201cdisconnect\\u201d in the two curves. So the infection curve is continuing to go up, and the hospital admissions curve is not increasing at the same speed. But again, the caveat is that it\\u2019s still very early in the fourth wave.\", \"What\\u2019s the government doing?\", \"The National Coronavirus Command Council in South Africa is meeting this week to discuss the best response to the increasing infections and whether the country needs to go into some sort of lockdown. Will we go back to a stricter curfew? Will we ban interprovincial travel? Will restaurants have to close early? Soon, we\\u2019re going to find out what kind of a Christmas we\\u2019ll have this year.\", \"Another question is what to do about vaccine mandates. Vaccines are still not compulsory, but we\\u2019re seeing some businesses, like Africa\\u2019s biggest telecom company, beginning to introduce vaccine mandates at its Johannesburg headquarters. A big question is whether vaccine mandates will be instituted for large public areas, like shopping malls and beaches.\", \"What\\u2019s the atmosphere like?\", \"I ventured to an outdoor market Saturday afternoon, and for the most part people are going on with their lives because it\\u2019s sunny and it\\u2019s hard to stay indoors. When I was at the market, I noticed every couple of minutes there was a notice over loudspeakers: \\u201cMasks are mandatory. Keep your masks on.\\u201d Lots of people had sanitizer in their bags, and people were constantly giving out hand sanitizer. But I don\\u2019t think we\\u2019re seeing a push by people to stay home.\", \"Why is that?\", \"Because of a sense of pandemic fatigue. And because the last time the restrictions were eased we held an election. So it\\u2019s very difficult for officials to tell South Africans that they campaigned and held rallies, but now we need to go back into lockdown. I just can\\u2019t see South Africans taking that very quietly.\", \"There\\u2019s also a real economic concern about restrictions. Perhaps more than in the past, I think, people are going to weigh whether they\\u2019re going to follow any new restrictions. After two years of the pandemic, our economy is ailing and unemployment is high. I think the question going forward is, Will people follow the restrictions for their health, or disobey them for the sake of their pockets?\", \"When will companies require employees to return to the office? After innumerable delays and setbacks, the new answer seems to be: We\\u2019ll get back to you.\", \"\\u201cReturn-to-office dates used to be like talismans,\\u201d my colleague Emma Goldberg writes. \\u201cThe chief executives who set them seemed to wield some power over the shape of the months to come. Then the dates were postponed, and postponed again. At some point the spell was broken.\\u201d\", \"As visions for full-scale reopenings and mandatory returns have gone unrealized, R.T.O. dates have become more wishful thinking than a reliable commitment.\", \"\\u201cThe only companies being dishonest are the ones giving employees certainty,\\u201d said Nicholas Bloom, a Stanford professor who advises dozens of chief executives. \\u201cAs a parent you can hide stuff from your kids, but as a C.E.O. you can\\u2019t do that to adult employees who read the news.\\u201d\", \"A survey of 238 executives, conducted in late August by the research company Gartner, found that two-thirds of organizations had delayed their return-to-office plans because of news about coronavirus variants. Apple, Ford, CNN and Google are just a few of the employers that announced postponements, and Lyft said the earliest that workers would be required to return to the office was 2023.\", \"New workplace vernacular. Bookcase credibility. Polywork. Zoombie. Emma also explored the new language of work life.\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic. Send us a response here, and we may feature it in an upcoming newsletter.\", \"Sign up here to get the briefing by email.\"]","href_hash":"29181a565c6811ec94bf05539ff878b7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"29181a565c6811ec94bf05539ff878b7"}},
