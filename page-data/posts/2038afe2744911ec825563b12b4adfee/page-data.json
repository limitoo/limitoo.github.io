Hubble has operated primarily at optical and ultraviolet wavelengths.\", \"Webb is about 100 times more powerful than Hubble, enabling it to observe objects at greater distances, thus farther back in time, than Hubble or any other telescope.\", \"Astronomers say this will bring into view a glimpse of the cosmos never previously seen - dating to just 100 million years after the Big Bang, the theoretical flashpoint that set in motion the expansion of the observable universe an estimated 13.8 billion years ago.\", \"The telescope is an international collaboration led by NASA in partnership with the European and Canadian space agencies. Northrop Grumman Corp was the primary contractor.\", \"- Reuters\"]","href_hash":"2038afe2744911ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2038afe2744911ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
