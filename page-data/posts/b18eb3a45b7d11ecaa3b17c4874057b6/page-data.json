a cosmetic surgeon, after\\u00a0a Four Corners investigation in conjunction with the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.\", \"They are also proposing to crackdown on advertising and social media abuses by increasing fines tenfold.\", \"Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt asked state health ministers to make new laws a priority after the joint investigation uncovered a litany of disturbing practices at a network of clinics run by celebrity cosmetic surgeon Daniel Lanzer, including allegations of serious hygiene and safety breaches and botched surgeries that left some patients in extreme pain.\", \"Dr Lanzer last week surrendered his registration and retired, amid an investigation by the Australian Health Practitioner Agency.\", \"His senior associate, Dr Daniel Aronov \\u2014\\u00a0who was until recently the most-followed cosmetic surgeon in the world on TikTok, with more than 13 million followers \\u2014\\u00a0was banned from practising cosmetic surgery last month and ordered to remove his social media posts.\", \"The government has now released a 108-page Regulation Impact Statement (RIS) into the use of the titles \\\"surgeon\\\" and \\\"cosmetic surgeon\\\" and is calling on the public to anonymously provide feedback about their experiences and submissions.\", \"It will be opened up for public consultation between mid-December and April 1, 2022.\", \"The move comes less than two weeks after the national medical regulator AHPRA announced its first-ever review into cosmetic surgery patient safety and acknowledged that a profit-driven culture in cosmetic surgery had led to dangerous practices.\", \"AHPRA chief executive\\u00a0Martin Fletcher said the inquiry was triggered by the Four Corners investigation with the Sydney Morning Herald and The Age.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Titles may cause confusion for patients</div>\", \"Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley \\u2014\\u00a0who has been leading the policy response by the states and the Commonwealth into cosmetic surgery for the past few years \\u2014\\u00a0said the concern was that the title \\\"surgeon\\\" and \\\"cosmetic surgeon\\\" could\\u00a0cause confusion that can led to bad outcomes for patients.\", \"Under the current law, anyone with a basic medical degree can call themselves a cosmetic surgeon, even though they are not\\u00a0registered specialist surgeons.\", \"Such specialist plastic and reconstructive surgeons receive between\\u00a0eight and\\u00a012 years of postgraduate surgical training.\", \"The problems with the cosmetic surgery industry have been well-known by authorities for decades, with a series of reviews and parliamentary inquiries conducted as far back as 1999, all of which went nowhere.\", \"<img

unregulated world of cosmetic surgery.</div>\", \"The 108-page consulting document canvasses a series of options, including restricting the title \\\"surgeon\\\" under National Law, strengthening the existing framework, and undertaking major public information campaigns.\", \"A fourth option is\\u00a0to maintain the status quo, but sources close to state and federal governments said this was unlikely.\", \"The consulting document said ministers were \\\"particularly\\\" concerned that the practice of cosmetic surgery and widespread use of the informal title cosmetic surgeon\\u00a0may be strongly and disproportionately associated with risks and harm.\", \"It said there was an information and power asymmetry between patients and practitioners, which was contributing to the risk of consumer harm.\", \"\\\"It can be difficult for the public to obtain information from neutral and informed sources, particularly as most cosmetic surgery consumers obtain information about prospective procedures from the practitioners that perform those procedures and from social media,\\\" the report says.\", \"\\\"This RIS is interested to discover how widespread cosmetic surgery resulting in significant harm and complications [might]\\u00a0be, and whether medical practitioners' qualifications are contributing to potential harm.\\\"\", \"It said advertising and marketing material must comply with a series of laws. Breaches of the law for advertising offences can incur financial penalties of $5,000 for each advertising offence for an individual and $10,000 for a body corporate.\", \"There are plans to increase those fines to $60,000 for an individual and $120,000 for a body corporate.\", \"It said health ministers were proposing to ban testimonials that were false, misleading or deceptive, ones that offer a gift or inducement without stating the terms and conditions, or ones that create an unreasonable expectation of beneficial treatment or encourage the unnecessary use of health services.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Calls to tame 'Wild West' of cosmetic surgery</div>\", \"Former president of the Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons Professor Mark Ashton \\u2014\\u00a0who spoke out as part of the joint media investigation \\u2014\\u00a0said he welcomed the inquiry.\", \"\\\"Hopefully, it will, for the first time, allow transparency of surgical training and qualifications against a national benchmark, and allow patients to accurately determine how much training and surgery the person intending to operate upon them has actually done,\\\" he said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f711fe6c7fe6876d67b853e5979f9b0a\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Health regulation consultant Margaret Faux says protecting the title of surgeon was not sufficient.(Four Corners)</div>\", \"Health regulation consultant Dr Margaret Faux \\u2014\\u00a0who has worked in the sector for 40 years, and describes the cosmetic treatments industry as like \\\"the Wild West, but without the sheriffs\\\" \\u2014 said it was a welcome start to protect patients.\", \"\\\"The law that regulates health practitioners in this country is littered with imprecise language and poorly defined terms,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Legislation is only ever as good as its ability to be enforced and, currently, investigations and enforcement of health practitioners is indiscriminate, often targeting good doctors through 'robodebt' like processes, leaving rogue doctors untouched.\", \"\\\"The consultation process should be broadened to include submissions on how to swiftly and decisively enforce breaches of any new laws.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"b18eb3a45b7d11ecaa3b17c4874057b6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b18eb3a45b7d11ecaa3b17c4874057b6"}},
