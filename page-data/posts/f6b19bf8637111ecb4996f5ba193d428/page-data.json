It can cause pneumonia, seizures, brain damage, deafness, blindness and even death, particularly in infants. The cough can persists for months after the initial infection is cleared. Half of all babies under one year old need hospital treatment, according to Health Navigator, and of those one or two will die.\\u00a0\", \"Each person who's infected spreads it to between five and 17 others on average. There is a vaccine, delivered in five doses through childhood - three in infancy and two boosters, at ages four and 11. Adult boosters are also available at ages 45 and 65, as well as for pregnant mothers - all are free.\\u00a0\", \"But Dr Petousis-Harris says health officials have \\\"seen declines in vaccine uptake which could compound the problem\\\".\\u00a0\", \"The last whooping cough outbreak started in 2017 and saw more than 4600 Kiwis infected over the course of a couple of years. Thankfully none died. The previous outbreak started in 2012, leaving three dead - two babies under six weeks old, so too young for vaccinations, and an unimmunised pre-schooler.\", \"Dr Petousis-Harris is currently leading a study into whooping cough's effects on adults, who usually suffer a milder illness than children and can sometimes go unreported. She says the research will help protect the wider population against outbreaks.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Developing national epidemiological data creates better understanding, raises awareness and allows for the creation of targeted health interventions - helping us protect our most vulnerable from this potentially devastating disease\\u2026 My suggestion is that Kiwis check the vaccine status of their whole family, it is easy to let this slip in the middle of a pandemic.\\\"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"f6b19bf8637111ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f6b19bf8637111ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
