South Island depict the majestic bird known as\\u00a0Te Pou\\u0101kai,\\u00a0or Te H\\u014dkioi.\", \"According to M\\u0101ori\\u00a0legend, the\\u00a0bird, thought to be Haast's eagle (Hieraaetus moorei),\\u00a0could swoop down and carry off adults and children.\", \"Weighing up to 18\\u00a0kilograms, or around three times as much as the wedge-tailed eagle, and\\u00a0with a 3-metre wingspan, it was the largest eagle that has ever lived.\", \"While it had the talons and beak of an eagle, it had the head of a vulture, leading some people\\u00a0to speculate\\u00a0it might have been more of a scavenger than a hunter.\", \"But either way, the bird was worthy of\\u00a0its fearsome reputation, according to a new study.\", \"While it used its tiger-claw-sized talons to kill, it had the table manners of a vulture, with a skull designed\\u00a0to dive deep into the juicer parts of its catch, the analysis published in\\u00a0Proceedings of the Royal Society B found.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"This was undoubtedly the biggest, baddest eagle ever,\\\" said zoologist and study co-author Steve Wroe of the University of New England.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">A quirk of rapid evolution on

Australian little eagle\\u00a0(Hieraaetus morphnoides).\", \"\\\"[Haast's eagle]\\u00a0evidently blew in from Australia sometime within the last 1 to 2 million years, then very rapidly evolved to be a giant,\\\" Professor Wroe said.\", \"\\\"It's probably the most extreme example of rapid evolution in size that we know of in any vertebrate.\", \"\\\"It's basically gone from being a 1-kilo bird to an 18kg bird.\\\"\", \"Landing on an island with no predators, it quickly evolved features and behaviours that allowed it to rule the roost.\", \"Until humans arrived in Aotearoa in the 13th century,\\u00a0the giant eagle\\u00a0feasted on\\u00a0moa, a hefty flightless bird that weighed up to 200 kilograms.\\u00a0\", \"<img

eagle's\\u00a0skull and talons and simulated feeding and killing behaviours to compare its performance with that of living eagles and vultures.\", \"The analysis showed the bird's\\u00a0talons could easily withstand high loads and take down prey much bigger than itself.\", \"\\\"Any time you get in there and wrestle with anything bigger than yourself, you risk breaking a wing, which is almost invariably fatal for a bird.\\\"\", \"Taking down a moa would have been risky.\", \"\\\"A 200kg bird\\u00a0would have had a hell of a kick on it,\\\"\\u00a0 Professor Wroe said.\", \"But it was a risk that could have paid\\u00a0off without any competitors, except for other eagles,\\u00a0to steal its food.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"If it took out a moa, it's got food for itself and its family for days.\\\"\", \"Rather\\u00a0than tearing\\u00a0flesh by gripping it with its beak and shaking it side to side\\u00a0like an eagle, the\\u00a0bird's skull was designed to rip and pull flesh from deep inside a carcass like a vulture.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/13e48f08c70b290aa43b202ca4ca9f33\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Haast's eagle is

South Island\\u00a0also tied in with the hypothesis that the eagle had a vulture-like head.\", \"\\\"It's\\u00a0a very dark body but ... the head appears to be bald,\\\" Professor Wroe said.\", \"\\\"Vultures almost universally have bald heads, and it's almost certainly so they don't accumulate too much blood and guts in the feathers on their head, which are very hard to clean.\\\"\", \"Despite its appearance though, Professor Wroe said the bird was\\u00a0still very much an eagle.\", \"\\\"It's an\\u00a0example of convergence, which is where two unrelated animals converge with respect to morphology because they've got similar habits.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Battle of the big birds</div>\", \"Haast's eagle was probably both a killer\\u00a0and a scavenger, said palaeontologist Trevor Worthy of Flinders University, who was not involved in the study.\", \"\\\"Like most other birds of New Zealand, they became generalists and not very specialised, so they were able\\u00a0to take on multiple roles,\\\" Dr Worthy said.\", \"\\\"It could quite happily dispense with a very large animal, but it could fly around and look for a dead one\\u00a0and eat that.\\\"\", \"There is no doubt it took down moa with its talons, he said.\", \"\\\"Those claws were powerful to cut through the feathers and skin, then 5 centimetres\\u00a0of flesh, then 5 millimetres\\u00a0of the pelvis.\", \"\\\"Under that pelvis is the kidney, so once you start ripping that up, you die pretty quickly,\\\" he said.\", \"But, Dr Worthy said, adult moa was unlikely to be the eagle's primary source of food.\", \"\\\"The moas we've seen that have been killed were already mired in a swamp, so they couldn't actually run anywhere.\", \"\\\"If\\u00a0a young moa was walking across a clearing, then the eagle could swoop down and get it, but it probably wouldn't tackle an adult moa.\", \"\\\"In reality, eagles are in the swamps too, which means they actually got killed\\u00a0in the process of dealing with a moa.\\\"\", \"In the end, neither the eagle nor the moa were a match for humans.\", \"Both birds became extinct around 500 years ago.\"]","href_hash":"cdc14045523d11ec8d4eb5b47dc0b52e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cdc14045523d11ec8d4eb5b47dc0b52e"}},
