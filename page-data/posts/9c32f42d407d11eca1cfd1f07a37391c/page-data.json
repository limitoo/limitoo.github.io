When he turned and knelt down to give the musicians the spotlight, he thought to himself vaguely that the violist had cool hair.\", \"Two days later, he received a message from that violist, Andrew Griffin, who had been in the band since the show opened in 2019.\", \"\\u201cSo\\u2026I think we\\u2019re cousins\\u2026?\\u201d Griffin wrote to Manuel in an Instagram message.\", \"Manuel responded with the requisite number of exclamation points for such a discovery: \\u201cOmg yes we are cousins!!!!!!!!\\u201d\", \"In fact, they\\u2019re second cousins once removed, according to the family tree recently drawn by Griffin\\u2019s mother. (She\\u2019s enthusiastic about genealogy.) Manuel\\u2019s great-grandmother is Griffin\\u2019s grandfather\\u2019s older sister, with 14 years separating the two siblings.\", \"The realization was a delight and a comfort to Manuel, 29, who, in January 2020, arrived in New York from Detroit after he had been cast as Ruffin, replacing Ephraim Sykes. It was a daunting move across the country: He left quickly with only two suitcases \\u2014 the rest of his stuff remained in his parents\\u2019 garage \\u2014 and it was his first time living independently, away from his family.\", \"He had always heard that Griffin\\u2019s side of the family eagerly supported their relatives however they could.\", \"\\u201cWherever you\\u2019re at, they will take you up in a heartbeat,\\u201d said Manuel, whose professional acting debut was playing Marvin Gaye on tour in \\u201cMotown: The Musical.\\u201d \\u201cIf you\\u2019ve got family, you\\u2019ve got everything that you need.\\u201d\", \"Griffin, 35, who grew up in Pittsburgh and moved to New York about six years ago to advance his music career, was shocked to learn that a new leading member in \\u201cAin\\u2019t Too Proud\\u201d was a blood relative.\", \"\\u201cI knew nothing of him \\u2014 absolutely nothing,\\u201d Griffin said. \\u201cI saw him onstage whenever they turn around and the musicians wave. That\\u2019s about it.\\u201d\", \"If it wasn\\u2019t for a video of the curtain call on Feb. 28, they might never have realized it. Manuel and his family had missed an earlier reunion, and the one scheduled for 2020 was canceled because of the pandemic.\", \"In February 2020, Manuel\\u2019s mother, Amiesha Williams, traveled to New York City to see his debut, and the day after, she posted a YouTube video of the curtain call on a family Facebook page used to plan reunions.\", \"\\u201cYou know how proud moms are,\\u201d Manuel said, \\u201cthey just brag.\\u201d\", \"The post garnered clapping emojis, encouraging remarks and then a comment from Griffin\\u2019s mother, Linda, pointing out that her son was in the center of the video playing the viola. She didn\\u2019t realize who Matt Manuel was and why Williams had posted the video of him in the first place.\", \"\\u201cHow do you know him?\\u201d Linda Griffin wrote in the comments section.\", \"Williams replied the next day: \\u201cI\\u2019m sorry I fell asleep so I\\u2019m just seeing this. Matthew is my son.\\u201d\", \"As comments flew back and forth about the specifics of their genealogy, Manuel was onstage crooning into the microphone as Ruffin, the original lead voice of \\u201cMy Girl.\\u201d Griffin was not far away, playing his viola beneath the stage. When Manuel returned to his dressing room, he saw a text from his mother: He had a cousin in the band and he should go meet him.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m like, \\u2018What does he look like?\\u2019\\u201d Manuel said. \\u201cAnd she\\u2019s just like, \\u2018His name is Drew and he plays the viola.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Outside the stage door, Manuel signed autographs for a throng of giddy Broadway fans, glancing back every so often to look for the viola player. When Griffin walked out, the two introduced themselves tentatively. \\u201cI think we\\u2019re cousins,\\u201d Griffin said. Two fans holding a poster stared at them blankly, Manuel recalled.\", \"The pair did the natural thing to do when you discover a family member: schedule a lunch date. They made plans for the following week, but soon, the airborne virus that had been spreading across the world had producers worrying. Then, on March 12, less than two weeks after Manuel\\u2019s debut, the industry shut down.\", \"\\u201cMaybe we should postpone,\\u201d Griffin remembered saying.\", \"During the lockdown, Griffin fled to North Carolina to hunker down with his girlfriend and her family; Manuel went back to Detroit, thinking the pause in the production would be a good opportunity to drive back the rest of his stuff in a U-Haul.\", \"The shutdown stretched on and on, keeping performers like Griffin and Manuel out of a regular job and perpetually wondering when they would get a return date. Griffin spent time composing, something he didn\\u2019t always have time to do with a full performance schedule. Manuel grieved the loss of a relative, spent time with family and tried to reconnect with the part of himself that wasn\\u2019t a performer, always eager to entertain those around him.\", \"The cousins fell out of touch, their discovery outside of the stage door seeming like another era, where fans mingled freely with actors after exiting a tightly packed theater.\", \"But last month, the show took back its place at the Imperial Theater. The initial days were all work: Manuel, who lives in Harlem, tried to get his body accustomed to doing back flips, splits and microphone tricks for seven shows a week. Griffin, who lives in Williamsburg, had four days to sit back in front of his music stand with the rest of the band and get songs like \\u201cYou\\u2019re My Everything\\u201d and \\u201cGet Ready\\u201d back into their muscle memory.\", \"\\u201cGoing down the street for the first day of work, I started to well up a little bit,\\u201d Griffin said. \\u201cIt was like nothing had really changed \\u2014 there were still jokes and stuff written on our stands.\\u201d\", \"They hadn\\u2019t gotten a moment to spend time together until late last month, when a member of the show\\u2019s production staff had a birthday party and they were both invited.\", \"\\u201cNow let\\u2019s pick up where we left of,\\u201d Manuel said. \\u201cActually go eat a meal and talk and, you know, gossip.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9c32f42d407d11eca1cfd1f07a37391c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9c32f42d407d11eca1cfd1f07a37391c"}},
