The two largest players in the industry, ExxonMobil and Chevron, have doubled their net income since 2019, he wrote, while announcing billions of dollars in plans to issue dividends and buy back stock.\", \"The average gallon of gas was nearly $3.40 in the United States on Monday, according to the Energy Information Agency, its highest price in seven years.\", \"If the gap between refined fuel costs and gasoline prices at the pump were to return to normal prepandemic levels, drivers would be paying as much as 25 cents less per gallon, White House officials estimate.\", \"Earlier this year, Mr. Biden asked the commission to monitor the gasoline market for any illegal conduct. The commission responded by increasing scrutiny of mergers in the oil and gas industry.\", \"Soaring gas prices, driven by an OPEC choke on production and renewed driving as commuters and travelers return from a pandemic hiatus, have dented Americans\\u2019 views of the economy and helped fuel an acceleration of inflation that has jeopardized part of Mr. Biden\\u2019s economic agenda in Congress.\", \"The increase has pinned Mr. Biden between his goals of reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that drive climate change and keeping costs low for middle-class consumers. Though economists agree that higher gas prices discourage gasoline use, Mr. Biden refused to include an increase in the federal gasoline tax as an offset for the spending in his infrastructure negotiations with Republicans.\", \"On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Biden will fly to Detroit to visit a General Motors factor that manufactures electric vehicles, highlighting a transition to lower-emission cars and trucks that the president hopes his newly signed $1.1 trillion infrastructure law will accelerate.\"]","href_hash":"6eb3e20847bd11eca204093294fb90de"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6eb3e20847bd11eca204093294fb90de"}},
