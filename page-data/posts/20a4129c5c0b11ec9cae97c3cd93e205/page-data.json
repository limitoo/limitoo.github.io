Everybody knew these kids, they went to school with them, you know,\\\" Sides told CBS affiliate WTTV. \\\"Half the police officers went to school with these guys, they were friends with them. It was a very great feeling to bring so much closure and answers to so many people at once. It meant a lot to me and I know it meant a lot to all of them too.\\\"\", \"Another group of YouTubers, Chaos Divers, said they have located the remains of seven missing people in the past two months in an intense push that has seen them travel some 8,000 miles in the United States.\", \"The work unleashes intense emotions, especially breaking the news to families who lived in the limbo of not knowing what happened to their sons, wives or brothers.\", \"\\\"It's a heartbreaking, gut-wrenching feeling that you never want to give up. Because you are telling them and you're watching the tears roll down their face, but you're watching this weight lift off their shoulders,\\\" said 38-year-old Lindsay Bussick, who is Chaos Divers founder Jacob Grubbs' partner in the operation.\", \"Illinois-residents Bussick and Grubbs said their work was not simply an effort to get the clicks on YouTube that determine how much of a financial return a video may generate.\", \"\\\"I'm sorry that I have to bring this content like this to be able to help defend the next family,\\\" said Grubbs, a 38-year-old former coal miner.\", \"\\\"But this is a way that we have figured out to be able to fund the help for another family,\\\" he added.\", \"Adam Scott Wandt, an assistant professor of public policy at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, said untrained \\\"true-crime armchair sleuths\\\" and their efforts have become a cultural phenomenon in the past decade.\", \"But the results have varied greatly.
