I thought it was an insult. Then I learned it was a great thing. I identify as mahu \\u2014 he/she.\\u201d\", \"Downing a large bottle of water on a brisk December afternoon, Raven O \\u2014 he prefers to always be called by his full show-business moniker, which retains only the first letter of his given last name \\u2014 exuded a relaxed charisma that defied all gender stereotypes. Turning up at the East Village alt-cabaret spot Pangea, where he has frequently performed, Raven O, 59, sported vinyl pants and a turtleneck sweater, both black, his naturally silver-white hair cascading down to his shoulders. His jacket was designed by the glam rocker Patrick Briggs, one of numerous collaborators and friends whose projects he would plug. An anarchy sign was stitched on one sleeve, the Japanese translation for a profane command on the other.\", \"Neither adornment matched Raven O\\u2019s vibe, which was warm and wistful as he traversed a range of subjects, among them his apparently imminent retirement from live performance.\", \"Since the \\u201980s, he has choreographed, directed, hosted, danced and sung \\u2014 in a warmly dusky, rangy voice that eventually became his primary asset \\u2014 in storied venues such as Boy Bar, the Box, Bar d\\u2019O and Joe\\u2019s Pub. After spending the Covid-19 shutdown in Hawaii with his husband, John Deutzman, a retired investigative television reporter whom he proudly called \\u201ca badass,\\u201d Raven O had hoped to resume appearances on a regular basis.\", \"But Deutzman worried about his spouse\\u2019s increasing struggles with severe osteoarthritis \\u2014 a condition that plagued Raven O\\u2019s father and grandfather and currently affects his older brother. An athlete and fitness trainer in his youth, he also suffers from spinal stenosis and bone spurs. \\u201cJohn said, \\u2018You can\\u2019t work. You can\\u2019t even walk,\\u2019\\u201d Raven O said. \\u201cI told him I could do this another 10 years, but coming back into the colder weather taught me that, no, I can\\u2019t.\\u201d\", \"Three farewell shows are now scheduled before Raven O returns to Oahu, where he plans to begin stem cell therapy. He\\u2019ll appear at Pangea for two sets on Saturday; on Sunday, he\\u2019ll join fellow nightlife stalwarts Joey Arias and Sherry Vine at Indochine, for the latest and likely last anniversary of their Bar d\\u2019O collaborations in the \\u201990s, which fused bawdy and elegant drag \\u2014 or \\u201cshowing my female mahu side,\\u201d for Raven O \\u2014 with soulful singing and spicy banter.\", \"Arias, who worked with and championed Raven O for years before that decade-long stint, said Raven O\\u2019s last chapter is far from written. \\u201cI think Raven\\u2019s going to reinvent himself without even knowing it. The body may retire, but his mind won\\u2019t, or his love of music and art and dance and people,\\u201d Arias said. \\u201cI think his legacy is in being honest \\u2014 not wasting time with trivial questions, being very direct, being able to shock people with his use of language.\\u201d\", \"As a fledgling performer, Raven O had two roommates undergoing gender transitions, and considered following their lead. \\u201cWe had a band called FDR Drive, and one day at rehearsals I realized I was standing to use the bathroom, and trans women don\\u2019t do that. I had a moment of clarity: I was doing this for the wrong reason \\u2014 because I got more positive attention as a woman than as a male.\\u201d\", \"One can expect similar candor in an upcoming memoir about Raven O\\u2019s New York adventures. \\u201cKate Rigg, one of my hanai sisters, is writing it with me,\\u201d he said, using the Hawaiian term for friends essentially adopted as siblings; he has a bunch of them. Raven O arrived in New York at 18 and, by his account, spent most of the \\u201980s and early \\u201990s homeless.\", \"\\u201cWhen it got cold, I\\u2019d find a place to sleep, usually by picking up a guy,\\u201d Raven O said, with a matter-of-fact smile. \\u201cI was a hooker, too; I sang for my supper, but if I needed money I did what I had to do. Usually it was, I\\u2019ll have sex if you let me sleep at your house and feed me and maybe give me some money.\\u201d Then drugs became a factor \\u2014 crack and crystal meth. He gradually began partying less; he and Deutzman even swore off alcohol two years ago. \\u201cWe just decided, we\\u2019re done,\\u201d Raven O said. \\u201cMy big weakness now is sugar. And I do have a fried chicken fetish.\\u201d\", \"There will likely be fewer personal revelations on an album Raven O recently recorded with the bassist Ben Allison, another longtime collaborator. It will be titled \\u201cPiece of Sky,\\u201d he said, after one of two original songs; the other tracks include standards and \\u201csome surprises, contemporary songs we made into jazz songs.\\u201d Painting, an old hobby that Raven O picked up again while hosting the Cirque du Soleil show \\u201cZumanity\\u201d in Las Vegas, will provide another creative outlet. Arias had originated the Cirque part, \\u201cand Joey said, \\u2018If you ever give up performing, you should paint.\\u2019 I said I would never give up performing, but here we are.\\u201d\", \"Should the stem cell therapy work well enough, Raven O wouldn\\u2019t rule out a return to the stage. \\u201cBut I\\u2019d never do it as intensely,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIn Hawaii, I can let nature take care of me. My older brother told me, you have to come home and let the aina \\u2014 the island \\u2014 heal you. And he\\u2019s a badass, too.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"de62ba735dcd11ec87d345d49f11332b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"de62ba735dcd11ec87d345d49f11332b"}},
