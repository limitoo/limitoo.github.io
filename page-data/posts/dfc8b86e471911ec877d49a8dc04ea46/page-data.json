In works that erode the boundaries between fiction, memoir and essay, Wideman explores the impulses that drive storytelling itself, returning to some enduring themes and formal devices. Those who have read the Homewood trilogy, \\u201cPhiladelphia Fire\\u201d or \\u201cBrothers and Keepers\\u201d will find that those books\\u2019 ideas continue to haunt Wideman\\u2019s work, though he approaches them with a verve only a master of language can command. Can art help us withstand inexplicable tragedy? Or build usable histories out of the absences gouged out by racial violence?\", \"Wideman turns forgotten historical figures into memorable characters, reanimating and giving voice to the past to make sense of the present. \\u201cWhose Teeth/Whose Story\\u201d is told from the perspective of a writer struggling with a project about the African American missionary and anti-colonialist writer William Henry Sheppard (1865-1927), who worked among the colonial subjects of the Congo Free State. It\\u2019s an act of necromancy that recalls earlier stories like \\u201cNat Turner Confesses,\\u201d from Wideman\\u2019s 2018 story collection \\u201cAmerican Histories.\\u201d For the narrator, Sheppard\\u2019s time in Congo both evokes and complicates the pith-helmet narratives of the era, namely \\u201cHeart of Darkness\\u201d (a text he insists is still \\u201cworthy of reading and studying\\u201d despite Chinua Achebe\\u2019s famously scorching takedown of it). He can\\u2019t help identifying somewhat with Sheppard in his tricky position as a Black man trying to operate with dignity under the watchful eye of white authority.\", \"\\u201cI grew up in the North, not the South like S, but his manner of coping with oppression feels quite familiar,\\u201d the narrator explains, observing that Sheppard seemed to have \\u201cquietly accommodated himself to the strict segregation by color enforced in his region \\u2026 undamaged by the fact that law and custom categorized him as an inferior kind of human.\\u201d It\\u2019s a sneakily devastating statement, condensing multiple histories of emotional erosion in the name of survival.\", \"An anxiety over what language can \\u2014 or cannot \\u2014 contribute to one\\u2019s survival stalks these stories. \\u201cArizona\\u201d takes the shape of a letter to the singer Freddie Jackson in which the narrator wonders what compulsions motivate artists to produce work. \\u201cLet imagination work between the lines, speaking a story for which there are no words, speaking for what\\u2019s missing always,\\u201d he writes. In the letter writer\\u2019s case, what\\u2019s missing is his son, imprisoned decades ago for the murder of a classmate during a camping trip to Arizona. Are there any words to salve the damage cascading down through history?\", \"In confounding tales that flit between Philadelphia and ancient Sumer, from a conversation between two doomed chickens to James Baldwin\\u2019s coverage of the Atlanta child murders, Wideman suggests there are not. \\u201cI mess with the rules of their language because I don\\u2019t trust language,\\u201d one of his chickens spit. \\u201cLanguage not substantial evidence of anything. Ain\\u2019t never been one of the faithful who believe it is.\\u201d Defiant before the carving knife, though, the chicken gets up from its plate, \\u201cclucking and cock-a-doodle-dooing loud enough to wake up every sleeping soul in Atlanta.\\u201d If language can\\u2019t destroy the slaughterhouse, it can at least help us put up a fight.\"]","href_hash":"dfc8b86e471911ec877d49a8dc04ea46"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dfc8b86e471911ec877d49a8dc04ea46"}},
