Jane, first took the stand for the government on Tuesday at Maxwell's sex-abuse trial in Manhattan Federal Court.\", \"She is the first of four women expected to testify that Ms Maxwell \\\"groomed\\\" them for abuse by Epstein when they were teenagers.\", \"Jane said on Tuesday that she had sexual encounters with Epstein at his Palm Beach home multiple times per month when she was 14, 15 and 16\\u00a0 years old.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ae119691ab3eb56b4192da3291445d53\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">

Ms Maxwell, who touched her breasts, Jane testified.\", \"Under cross-examination on Wednesday, Ms Maxwell's attorney, Laura Menninger, asked Jane about apparent discrepancies between her descriptions of Ms Maxwell's role on Tuesday and earlier conversations with prosecutors before Ms Maxwell's July 2020 arrest.\", \"\\\"When you spoke with the government in December 2019, with your lawyers there, you told the government, at that time, you were not sure whether Maxwell ever touched you during these encounters, correct?\\\" Ms Menninger asked.\", \"\\\"I don't recall,\\\" Jane replied.\", \"<div

now in her early 40s, said she\\u00a0recalled certain events that she did not recall in the past.\", \"She testified on Tuesday that Ms Maxwell sometimes called her house while she was a teenager to
