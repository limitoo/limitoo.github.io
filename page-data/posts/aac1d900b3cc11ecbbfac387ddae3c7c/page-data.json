Many of the others are simply passed back to police to investigate themselves.\", \"Defence Lawyers Association\\u00a0co-founder Christopher Stevenson\\u00a0says that fuels a perception the IPCA is not genuinely independent - and a lack of transparency doesn't help.\", \"Despite being a Crown Entity, the IPCA is not subject to the Official Information Act (OIA), which closes down a vital accountability mechanism for proper scrutiny.\", \"Stevenson says open justice is essential to a free and democratic society.\", \"\\\"The important point is that the public are able to have confidence in the investigations undertaken by the IPCA and the outcomes. How can that possibly be when they're cloaked in secrecy,\\\" he asks. \\\"It's really difficult to see any rational reasoning for such an important public process being cloaked in secrecy.\\\"\", \"But Judge Doherty says the secrecy is vital and legislated for.\", \"\\\"That is designed so that people will be free and frank. We cannot divulge anything that comes in here,\\\" he says.\", \"\\\"We have police officers telling us things they don't tell police in the criminal investigations against them. The reason for that is that they are able to tell us and what they do tell us cannot ever be used against them. That's in the legislation.\\\"\", \"When the IPCA does find fault with police actions it is limited to making recommendations for changes to police policy.\", \"Judge Doherty denies the IPCA is toothless.\", \"\\\"We're gummy. I wouldn't say we're toothless,\\\" Judge Doherty says. \\\"We do have quite a bit of influence on police but we are toothless, legislatively, in the sense that we are not the organisation who can make decisions about prosecution, nor can we bring a prosecution.\\\"\", \"But Judge Doherty says that should change. He wants the IPCA to have prosecutorial powers, as other similar bodies overseas do. Currently it is left to the police to determine whether criminal charges should be laid and police have never charged an officer with homicide in any of the 39 police shootings since 1990.\", \"In today's Focus on Politics podcast, investigative journalist Guyon Espiner talks to a leading defence lawyer, the chair of the IPCA and the commissioner of police about whether the police watchdog is fit for purpose.\", \"Listen free to\\u00a0Focus on Politics\\u00a0on\\u00a0Apple Podcasts, on\\u00a0\\u00a0Spotify, on\\u00a0iHeart Radio\\u00a0or wherever you get your podcasts.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"aac1d900b3cc11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"aac1d900b3cc11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
