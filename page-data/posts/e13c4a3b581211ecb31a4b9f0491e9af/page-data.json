At the time, F.I.T. was already dealing with criticisms of racial insensitivity, particularly after a runway show in March 2020 in which models wore oversize lips and blown-up \\u201cmonkey\\u201d ears.\", \"\\u201cThere was a lot of rhetoric, a lot of talk, a lot of concern, a lot of guilt,\\u201d said Dr. Brown, who in 1998 became the college\\u2019s first African American and its first female president. \\u201cBut to really take advantage, if you will, of all that concern, and try and create something that would make a meaningful and systemic difference \\u2014 it really felt like an obligation to try and figure out what that might look like.\\u201d\", \"The objective F.I.T. ultimately landed on: increasing the number of people of color who choose and advance in careers in fashion and adjacent fields (like advertising, communications and beauty).\", \"Several specifics are still being finalized, the school said, but the center will include efforts to educate young students about career paths and prepare them for college admissions (through seminars or workshops with professors, students and professionals, for example).\", \"At the college level, there will be scholarships for students of color provided by Ralph Lauren, Prada, Carolina Herrera and Capri Holdings (owner of Versace, Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo), and also paid internships for the students with these companies.\", \"Dr. Brown acknowledged that the first reaction of many companies to the racial reckoning, back in June 2020, was to \\u201cthrow money\\u201d at the problem. They donated money to schools for scholarships but did not provide further opportunities for those students. Nor were they \\u201creally looking internally to see what they ought to be doing in their own companies,\\u201d she said.\", \"F.I.T. also plans to offer career guidance after college, with programs for mentorship and management skill building, and to advocate promotion opportunities and develop executive training. Additionally, F.I.T. has promised \\u201congoing accountability\\u201d to track progress in the industry, an effort that has remained challenging in the aftermath of the fashion industry\\u2019s reckoning, as most companies still don\\u2019t disclose much diversity data.\", \"According to the school, the Social Justice Center has received nearly $4 million in funding, including $1 million each from PVH Corp (the parent company of Calvin Klein, whose namesake is an F.I.T. alumnus, and Tommy Hilfiger), Tapestry, Inc. (Coach, Kate Spade) and Capri.\", \"Jeffrey Tweedy, the former president and chief executive of Sean John and an adviser to the Social Justice Center, said he hopes a stronger link between F.I.T. and the corporate world will lead to \\u201cdrastic changes.\\u201d\", \"As an F.I.T. alumnus who studied men\\u2019s wear design and marketing, Mr. Tweedy said he rarely saw other students or faculty of color and has over the years seen firsthand fashion\\u2019s tendency to treat racial progress as a trend.\", \"\\u201cI want to make this a permanent movement and not fall back to the patterns that we\\u2019ve succumbed to in the past,\\u201d Mr. Tweedy said. For him, such a program \\u201ccould have opened the doors quicker.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e13c4a3b581211ecb31a4b9f0491e9af"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e13c4a3b581211ecb31a4b9f0491e9af"}},
