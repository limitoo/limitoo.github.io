As disruptive as this hack was, it pales in comparison to what would happen if America's critical financial infrastructure were to be taken offline.\\\"\", \"\\\"This bill will help deter, deny, and track down hackers who threaten the financial institutions that make day-to-day economic activity possible. The legislation will also provide long-overdue clarity for financial institutions that look to Congress for rules of the road as ransomware hacks intensify,\\\" he added.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932434/patrick-mchenry-ransomware-bill.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Representative Patrick McHenry (R-NC) introduced a bill last week that would bar certain financial entities from paying over $100,000 in ransom.

That would virtually make all ransom payments outlawed without authorization, as hackers rarely demand payments below that figure, according to CoinGeek. Last year, the average ransomware transaction was $847,000.\", \"The bill comes after an uptick in ransomware attacks in the U.S. on critical infrastructure such as the Colonial Pipeline and groups, including the meat producer JBS USA. The latter accounts for nearly a fifth of American beef production and was forced to pay hackers $11 million this year to unlock their system after an attack.\", \"On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security also launched a new program to prioritize hiring cyber security experts as the U.S. works to address the recent rise of major hacking incidents.\", \"Last year, the White House reported 30,819 information security incidents across the federal government in 2020, an 8 percent increase from 2019.\", \"\\\"As our nation continues to face an evolving threat landscape, we cannot rely only on traditional hiring tools to fill mission-critical vacancies,\\\" DHS Secretary Mayorkas said in a statement. \\\"This new system will enable our Department to better compete for cybersecurity professionals and remain agile enough to meet the demands of our critical cybersecurity mission.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"455a2a41463a11ecb5054d6928f9466b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"455a2a41463a11ecb5054d6928f9466b"}},
