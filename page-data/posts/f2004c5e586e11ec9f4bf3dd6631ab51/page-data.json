To help support himself and his drug addiction, Simon sold Trump hats at various locations in Huntington Beach.\", \"In a letter to Judge Amy Berman Jackson ahead of his sentencing, Simon acknowledged he struggled with addiction, calling it \\\"unfortunate\\\" that he was under the influence on January 6.
