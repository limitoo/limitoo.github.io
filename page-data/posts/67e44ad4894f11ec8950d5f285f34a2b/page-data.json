The United States has yet to win any golds, earning only one bronze and four silver medals so far.\", \"What gives?\", \"Only twice before has the United States reached at least the fifth day of a Winter Games before picking up a gold medal, said Bill Mallon, a leading authority on Olympic history. The first time was the 1984 Games in Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, when the skier Debbie Armstrong won gold in the women\\u2019s slalom.\", \"The second time the United States had not won a gold medal by the fifth day was at the 1988 Calgary Games. It wasn\\u2019t until the figure skater Brian Boitano placed first in the men\\u2019s competition, defeating the world champion Brian Orser of Canada, that the United States won gold that year.\", \"The United States is not a powerhouse in winter sports, Mallon said, a field in which Norway, Germany and Russia, which is competing in Beijing under the neutral banner of the Russian Olympic Committee, often dominate. The United States also tends to perform better in Europe and North America than in Asia, Mallon added.\", \"\\u201cI guess we would have expected possibly one gold by now, but we haven\\u2019t had a lot of strong events,\\u201d Mallon said, adding that the American skier Mikaela Shiffrin was the strongest gold medal contender to date in Beijing.\", \"But on Monday, Shiffrin fell and was disqualified from the giant slalom event.\", \"The most likely gold medalist remaining is Chloe Kim, the snowboarder and defending champion in the women\\u2019s halfpipe competition, which starts Wednesday.\", \"According to Mallon, at virtually every Olympics, the United States has won at least one of each of the three types of medal, with two exceptions: It failed to win a bronze medal at the 1984 Sarajevo Games and did not capture a silver at the 1936 Games in Garmisch-Partenkirchen, Germany.\"]","href_hash":"67e44ad4894f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"67e44ad4894f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
