Last weekend I went to a party where I reunited with several friends I hadn\\u2019t seen since early 2020 or before. I greeted each with The New Hug.\", \"The New Hug is a highly choreographed affair, beginning with an eager approach, the natural inclination to gather someone you\\u2019re happy to see in joyful embrace. Then there\\u2019s the pause just before contact, wherein you consider protocol, make eye contact, is this OK, is touching OK?\", \"The pause is typically followed by both parties flinging wide their arms. The wingspan of The New Hug is infinite, a theatrical \\u201cBring it in!\\u201d gesture so exaggerated it could be seen from space. Then comes actual embrace \\u2014 really more of a dramatic air kiss over one another\\u2019s shoulders. One person might give the other a little squeeze, but it\\u2019s over quickly in peals of awkward laughter. Then we beat a rapid retreat back to our personal space behind our invisible fences.\", \"This is my New Hug. Yours may differ, if you\\u2019re giving hugs at all. \\u201cIt feels good to shake hands,\\u201d a person I met for the first time at the party said to me. Early on in the pandemic, we focused so hard on our hands: Scrub them for the length of two \\u201cHappy Birthday\\u201ds, disinfect them after every door opened, keep them away from our faces. Definitely keep them away from other people.\", \"Every touch now carries with it a history of not touching, of careful ministrations and the assessment of risk. Will our gestures always be this overdetermined? Over time, perhaps, The New Hug will evolve or fade away. But this new appreciation for each fleeting moment of contact, the meaning in every casual touch \\u2014 I hope that won\\u2019t ever going away.\", \"Michael Tucker in Bath, Maine, is going deep on Nick Cave.\", \"How have you been greeting others these days?
