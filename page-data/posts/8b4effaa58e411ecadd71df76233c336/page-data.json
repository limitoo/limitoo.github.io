A last-minute appeal with the U.S. Supreme Court remains pending.\", \"Oklahoma's Pardon and Parole Board last month voted against executing Stouffer, with some board members voicing concerns about the state's ability to humanely execute people, but Oklahoma's Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt rejected the board's recommendation.\", \"Protesters are expected to gather outside the penitentiary and Stitt's mansion on Thursday morning in a final bid to urge the governor to grant Stouffer clemency.\", \"Stitt did grant clemency to Julius Jones just hours before his scheduled execution last month, commuting his sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole, after an international outcry.\", \"Stouffer was convicted in 2003 and sentenced to death after his first conviction and death sentence was overturned.\", \"Prosecutors said Stouffer went to the Oklahoma City home of Doug Ivens, whose ex-wife he was dating, on January 24, 1985, to borrow a gun. They say he fatally shot Reaves and wounded Ivens to get access to Ivens' $2 million life insurance policy.\", \"But Stouffer's attorneys have argued that he had accumulated assets of approximately $2.5 million before his arrest.\", \"Stouffer told a parole board hearing that Reaves was dead when he arrived and that Ivens, who testified against him, was shot during a struggle over a gun.\", \"\\\"I was not present when Linda Reaves was shot,\\\" Stouffer told the board. \\\"I am totally innocent of the murder of Linda Reaves and my heart goes out to the family of Linda Reaves that have suffered as a result of her murder.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948288/oklahoma-execution-chamber.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">This Oct. 9, 2014, file photo shows the gurney in the the execution chamber at the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma.</div>\"]","href_hash":"8b4effaa58e411ecadd71df76233c336"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8b4effaa58e411ecadd71df76233c336"}},
