Brooks could face five counts of intentional homicide.\", \"Minutes before the horrific scene unfolded at the holiday parade, police say, Brooks left the scene of a domestic dispute. They say he wasn't being chased when he drove into the parade.\", \"\\\"We actually had a squad and barricades up and he drove right through,\\\" said Waukesha Police Chief Daniel Thompson. \\\"When an officer tried to engage and stop the threat, he still continued through the crowd for some distance.\\\"\", \"Brooks has a long criminal history.
