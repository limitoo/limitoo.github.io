We\\u2019ll look at financial entanglements involving two operators of homeless shelters. We\\u2019ll also meet Devashish Basnet, who immigrated from Nepal when he was 6, speaking not a word of English. He just became a Rhodes scholar.\", \"One development involving shelter operators had to do with CORE Services Group. A New York Times investigation published last month found that CORE, a nonprofit, had channeled contracts worth at least $32 million into for-profit companies tied to its chief executive, Jack Brown III, allowing him to earn more than $1 million a year. Brown (pictured) also hired at least five family members, including his brother, who took home a six-figure salary.\", \"On Monday, in response to questions from The Times, the city said it was severing ties with CORE.\", \"[N.Y.C. Severs Ties With Housing Boss Who Earned $1 Million a Year]\", \"My colleague Amy Julia Harris writes that the city ordered Brown to close the for-profit companies and fold their services into the charity following questions from The Times in September. City officials said they had instructed Brown to step aside and had ordered CORE to repay the city more than $2.3 million for \\u201cexcessive executive salaries.\\u201d\", \"The nonprofit refused, according to a letter the city sent to CORE last week.\", \"Isaac McGinn, a spokesman for the Department of Social Services, the agency that oversees the operation of homeless shelters, said the city planned to phase out CORE as a shelter provider by March. The city has already closed one CORE site.\", \"The other shelter operator, Ethel Denise Perry, admitted using money from the city to cover shopping sprees at Bergdorf Goodman, Ferragamo, Neiman Marcus and Manolo Blahnik and other personal expenses, including car payments and a gym membership. Letitia James, New York\\u2019s attorney general, called the thefts \\u201cimmoral.\\u201d\", \"The city had paid the nonprofit she ran, Millennium Care, $10 million to run a 100-room homeless shelter in the Bronx. Perry admitted taking nearly $2.4 million beyond her official salary. She also put her brother and nephew on the Millennium Care payroll.\", \"[She Ran a Bronx Homeless Shelter. Here\\u2019s What She Spent Millions On.]\", \"My colleague Andy Newman writes that Perry used the nonprofit as a personal piggy bank in part because it had no board of directors. It also failed to file required financial reports with the state and the Internal Revenue Service, and, according to a plea agreement she signed, \\u201ccarried out its business in a persistently illegal manner.\\u201d\", \"In the plea bargain, reached in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, Perry pleaded guilty to tax fraud and Millennium Care pleaded guilty to grand larceny. Perry was sentenced to five years\\u2019 probation and ordered to pay $1.1 million in taxes and penalties. Millennium Care will pay a fine of $2,394,169 \\u2014 the exact amount that Perry overpaid herself \\u2014 and will be dissolved. Millennium Care\\u2019s 100-room shelter is now run by one of the city\\u2019s biggest shelter providers, Acacia Network.\", \"Perry\\u2019s lawyer, Frank Perrone Jr., said that she had already paid more than $200,000 that she owed in back taxes. He noted that notwithstanding James\\u2019s comments, only Millennium Care, not Ms. Perry, had pleaded guilty to larceny. Perrone is also Millennium Care\\u2019s lawyer.\", \"It\\u2019s a sunny day in the mid-40s, but bundle up. The wind chill will make it feel colder. Then expect a partly cloudy evening with temps in the high 30s.\", \"In effect until tomorrow (Thanksgiving Day).\", \"New York is moving to allow 800,000 noncitizens to cast ballots in local elections \\u2014 New Yorkers who have green cards or the legal right to work in the United States. The City Council is expected to approve the move next month. This comes as the nation is wrestling with new, Republican-supported restrictions on voting rights.\", \"Malikah Shabazz, a daughter of Malcolm X, was found dead in her living room in Brooklyn. The police do not suspect foul play; accidental food poisoning might have played a role. She was 56.\", \"Devashish Basnet did not think he aced the interview.\", \"\\u201cThey intentionally try to throw you off and ask really jarring questions,\\u201d said Basnet, a 21-year-old senior at Hunter College who was talking about being interviewed by the committee that chooses Rhodes scholars.\", \"He was also well aware that he came from Hunter, part of the City University of New York system. Rhodes scholarships, which finance two or three years of graduate study at the University of Oxford, often go to students from Ivy League schools. \\u201cI was the only public university student\\u201d among the New York-area students who were interviewed, he said. \\u201cI felt like the odd person out.\\u201d\", \"And there was the legacy of Cecil Rhodes, the diamond mogul who endowed the scholarships at the beginning of the 20th century. Rhodes\\u2019s white supremacist views have been attacked as harbingers of apartheid.\", \"Basnet was born in Kathmandu, Nepal. He came to the United States with his parents when he was 6. They arrived seeking political asylum in 2006. He was later accepted into the Obama administration\\u2019s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. At Hunter, where he is a political science major as well as the president of the Undergraduate Student Government, he won a fellowship that sent him to the border with Mexico, where he assisted families that had crossed into Arizona.\", \"Jennifer J. Raab, the president of Hunter, said the school had used a $1.5 million gift to \\u201cdo what the best of the privates do, identify the students and nurture their talent, helping to make them competitive candidates for Rhodes and other scholarships.\\u201d She called Basnet \\u201can all-around extraordinary person\\u201d with a long list of accomplishments during his college career.\", \"The Rhodes interviews were conducted by videoconference over two days last week. On the second day, Basnet said, the applicants were told to log on, talk to each other and wait while the committee deliberated. It would call back anyone it wanted for another interview.\", \"\\u201cI was in the middle of talking about my Zodiac sign with the other finalists,\\u201d said Basnet, a Virgo. \\u201cI blinked and there I was, facing the scholarship committee. They don\\u2019t give you a warning before they re-interview you.\\u201d\", \"After some questions, there was the inevitable request: Sing something, please.\", \"It was inevitable because Basnet is a baritone. He is appearing in Hunter\\u2019s production of \\u201cThe Marriage of Figaro.\\u201d But he decided not to sing Mozart. He chose an arrangement of a Mexican folk song, \\u201cMi Sue\\u00f1o\\u201d (\\u201cMy Dream\\u201d).\", \"The announcement that he was one of two winners in the district that covers the New York metro area came a short time later. The other winner in that district, Liam Elkind, attends Yale.\", \"\\u201cI felt really, really proud to be in that Zoom room with every single flavor of Ivy League student that\\u2019s out there,\\u201d Basnet said, \\u201cand it felt really, really good to bring it home for Hunter.\\u201d\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"I was on a B train in Brooklyn one Monday morning, and there were no empty seats.\", \"I saw a passenger stand when the train got to DeKalb Avenue and was moving over to take his spot when a woman nearby spoke up.\", \"\\u201cMay I please have that seat, miss?\\u201d she said. \\u201cI have a pinched nerve in my back and it\\u2019s killing me.\\u201d\", \"I said it was no problem and stood back so that she could sit.\", \"\\u201cThank you so much,\\u201d she said.\", \"That evening, I met a friend for dinner on Grove Street and afterward we went to Marie\\u2019s Crisis for a bit.\", \"As I sat on a stool near the piano, I noticed the woman from the B train sitting at the other end and I decided to approach her.\", \"\\u201cExcuse me,\\u201d I said. \\u201cDidn\\u2019t we ride the B together this morning?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYes!\\u201d she said. \\u201cOh my God, thank you again for letting me have that seat.\\u201d\", \"The piano player started into \\u201cLet\\u2019s Go Fly a Kite,\\u201d and we began to sing.\", \"\\u2014 Erica Buchman\", \"Illustrated by Agnes Lee.
