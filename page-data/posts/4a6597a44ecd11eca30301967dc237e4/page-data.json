Now, Rasmussen has told his story through the award-winning film “Flee.”","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-26T15:27:35.000Z","content":"[\"COPENHAGEN \\u2014 Midway through Jonas Poher Rasmussen\\u2019s latest documentary, a decrepit boat crowded with Afghans fleeing violence crosses paths with a gleaming Norwegian cruise ship somewhere in the Baltic Sea.\", \"The passage for the migrants so far has been harrowing, and most of them greet the ocean liner with joyous relief, convinced their salvation has arrived. But the film\\u2019s protagonist, Amin, takes in the well-groomed passengers on the ship\\u2019s deck, snapping photographs of the refugees below and only feels \\u201cembarrassed and ashamed at our situation.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cFlee\\u201d tells, in animated form, the true story of how Amin, Rasmussen\\u2019s close friend since high school, fled Kabul as a child in the \\u201980s with his family, before heading to the Soviet Union and trying to reach asylum in Scandinavia. For the subsequent 20 years, Amin kept the specifics of this perilous five-year journey a secret, and in this emotionally nuanced documentary, we discover the story\\u2019s twists and turns much as Rasmussen did.\", \"When Amin told him about the cruise ship incident, the director was initially surprised by the weight and impact of his friend\\u2019s shame. \\u201cAnd then, I had to say, \\u2018but, you know, I\\u2019m the cruise ship now,\\u2019\\u201d Rasmussen said in an interview at his home in Copenhagen. \\u201cI\\u2019m the one standing up there looking at your story.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Rasmussen, whose other documentaries include 2012\\u2019s \\u201cSearching for Bill,\\u201d is acutely aware of the responsibility that comes with telling another person\\u2019s story. Amin is not his protagonist\\u2019s real name; at his friend\\u2019s request, \\u201cFlee\\u201d keeps Amin\\u2019s true identity hidden, even as the film tells a deeply intimate story in arresting detail.\", \"Over the last year, the documentary has garnered a slew of awards, including at Sundance Film Festival, and now looks like it might be an Oscar contender. Opening in theaters in New York and Los Angeles on Dec. 3, the film has had so much positive attention in its native Denmark \\u2014 a European country that has taken a comparatively hard line on refugees in recent years \\u2014 that there are hopes that it may change the debate on migration.\", \"Rasmussen, now 40, has known he wanted to tell the story of Amin\\u2019s flight from Afghanistan for nearly two decades, even though he only vaguely knew what his friend went through. The two met when they were both 15, and Rasmussen noticed Amin on the train to school. As he recounts in the film, Rasmussen was drawn to the Afghan\\u2019s stylish clothing (\\u201cIn rural Denmark,\\u201d he said, \\u201cpeople did not commit to fashion,\\u201d) and from there the two struck up a friendship.\", \"One of Rasmussen\\u2019s grandmothers was the daughter of Russian-Jewish refugees and had to flee Nazi Germany, which may also explain why the two 15-year-olds recognized something in each other.\", \"When they were both in their 20s, Rasmussen asked Amin if he could make an audio documentary about his story, but the latter said he wasn\\u2019t ready. By 2014, he was. Even then, their arrangement was tentative, and they explored whether Amin felt safe recounting his history for the first time and, if so, whether Rasmussen could find an effective way of telling it. To start, he drew upon a technique he had learned in radio, asking Amin, with his eyes closed, to recount a story in the present tense.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re asking them to paint an image for you,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhat does the house look like? What are the colors on the wall? That gives you a lot of information that we could use in the animation, but it also brings him back, so he kind of relives things instead of just retelling them. It\\u2019s really about making the past come back to life.\\u201d\", \"This became the structure for the film\\u2019s interviews, which took place over four years, at the same time as the refugee crisis erupted in Europe. With a center-right government newly in power, Denmark took a much harder line than other Northern European countries, drastically limiting the number of asylum seekers it accepted and the benefits they received, as well as passing legislation that required them to hand over valuables. Although the crisis heightened the project\\u2019s relevancy, it also pushed Rasmussen to make the film feel even more personal.\", \"\\u201cIn the beginning, of course I wanted to tell my friend\\u2019s story, but there was a political aspect to it,\\u201d Rasmussen said of his determination to remind his fellow Danes of the human beings behind the label of \\u201crefugee.\\u201d \\u201cThat became less so because the debate here was so harsh and so polarized,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t want to be a part of that.\\u201d\", \"That polarization continues in Denmark, with school lunches as well as laws around the processing of asylum seekers becoming cultural flash points. The stridency of the debate makes \\u201cFlee,\\u201d with its intimate tone and complex lead character, stand out all the more.\", \"\\u201cA lot of Danish documentary filmmakers have made films on refugee topics,\\u201d said Kim Skotte, the film editor for the Danish newspaper Politiken. \\u201cThose show the suffering of thousands of people, but after a point you kind of block it out. This is a much easier film to watch in some ways because you\\u2019re drawn into one person\\u2019s story.\\u201d\", \"Animating the documentary, with actors voicing the dialogue Amin remembered, helped emphasize this focus on one individual\\u2019s story, while the anonymity made it easier for Amin to recount his past. \\u201cThis is life trauma, and it\\u2019s not easy for him to talk about,\\u201d Rasmussen said, who hadn\\u2019t worked with animation before \\u201cFlee.\\u201d The fact that Amin isn\\u2019t now a public figure, \\u201cthat he wouldn\\u2019t meet people who would know his intimate secrets and traumas, was key for him to feel safe.\\u201d\", \"Rasmussen was also drawn to the creative possibilities that animation offers. While he conducted the interviews, the director noticed changes in Amin\\u2019s voice. \\u201cWhen he came to things it was difficult for him to talk about, you could feel that he was in another place. I thought we should see that visually,\\u201d he said.\", \"Working with the animation director Kenneth Ladekjaer and the art director Jess Nicholls, he developed a fluid, darkly impressionistic style to convey moments of emotional trauma, such as a terrifying scene when Amin\\u2019s sisters are locked in a suffocating container on a ship headed across the Baltic.\", \"Like in the 2008 film \\u201cWaltz with Bashir,\\u201d which tracks the Israeli filmmaker Ari Folman\\u2019s attempts to recover memories of his own participation in the Lebanon War, animation allowed Rasmussen to recreate a specific past. Rather than relying, as in typical documentary style, on talking heads\\u2019s descriptions, Rasmussen could put Amin visibly back in his own \\u201980s Kabul.\", \"Achieving that kind of narrative authenticity required a precise attention to detail, Nicholls said. Each element in every frame had to be accurate to the time and location: the brand of pot on the stove, the quality of a sunset, even the height of the street curb. Some of that research was conducted by Rasmussen on scouting trips, but Nicholls and her team also spent a lot of time combing archives and libraries. \\u201cFinding pre-Taliban footage of Kabul was really difficult,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI read a lot of books by Russian spies.\\u201d\", \"The film\\u2019s commitment to emotional truth extends, most effectively, to its main character\\u2019s complex interior life. After so many years telling a false version of his family\\u2019s story, Amin initially lies to Rasmussen, and he is not always kind or forthcoming to his partner, a Danish man, who is eager to get married and buy a home. Rasmussen\\u2019s questioning prompts Amin to recognize that he needs to confront his past before he can commit to his relationship, but the realization and Amin\\u2019s sexuality itself \\u2014 explored through a funny boyhood crush on Jean-Claude Van Damme and an introduction to gay bars that doesn\\u2019t go as expected \\u2014 are handled with a light touch.\", \"The film received rave reviews when it debuted in theaters here this summer, even from newspapers that have taken a hard stance against refugees. And the international attention it\\u2019s receiving leads Skotte, the film editor, to believe it will influence the discourse surrounding migration in Denmark. \\u201cFor Danes now it\\u2019s becoming the kind of film that you have to see if you want to know what\\u2019s going on,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s very, very different from being oh, another heavy documentary about refugees.\\u201d\", \"Rasmussen hopes the film will have a broader impact when it is released on Danish television next year. Earlier this month it won the Nordic Council Prize for Film, a prestigious annual award given by the region\\u2019s parliamentary body, and in his acceptance speech the director laid out his aspirations.\", \"\\u201cWhen we talk about refugees today, it soon becomes a discussion about who is for and against refugees,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut I hope \\u2018Flee\\u2019 will remind people how important it is that we continue to turn to each other.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4a6597a44ecd11eca30301967dc237e4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4a6597a44ecd11eca30301967dc237e4"}},
