And the film's early sequences have an appropriately pulpy, new age look that conjures the spiritualism of the era: shapeshifting astral bodies, galactic beams of light, a colourful hint of camp to the costumes.\", \"Arriving to Earth in 7000 BC via pan-dimensional spacecraft, the Eternals themselves cut a striking figure. Maternal leader Ajak (Salma Hayek) is all flamboyant headdresses and capes; flaxen-haired Thena (Angelina Jolie) pirouettes with translucent, elvish weapons; and an androgynous, Bowie-esque teenager, Sprite (Lia McHugh), can bend reality into illusion.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/12d372f0f73032d67fdcf15489934196\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> \\\"You get the sensation that you're making almost like an independent film\\u00a0\\u2026 in the way independent films tell very personal stories,\\\" said Hayek in press notes.(Supplied: Disney)</div>\", \"There's also tech whiz inventor Phastos (Brian Tyree Henry); mischievous mind-manipulator Druig (Barry Keoghan); strongman Gilgamesh (Don Lee); super-fast Makkari (Lauren Ridloff); and Kingo (Kumali Nanjiani), who can project energy beams and sitcom jokes in equal measure.\", \"Zhao reserves most of the dramatic focus, however, for the transmutational Sersi (Gemma Chan), whose relationship with fellow Eternal Ikaris (Richard Madden) and subsequent love for a human (Kit Harington) has given her a deep sense of connection with the Earth. (The way it's pronounced here, \\\"Sersi\\\" frequently sounds like \\\"seriously\\\", resulting in an inadvertent, Flying High!-style running gag.)\", \"Their abilities might be a grab bag, but collectively the Eternals have one formidable superpower: namely, overthinking everything.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5c57d2ffc5650333ae94037824b2e2e0\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> \\u201cI have been a fan of the MCU for the last decade. So, I put the word out there I wanted to make a Marvel movie,\\\"\\u00a0Zhao said to Variety.(Supplied: Disney/Sophie Mutevelian)</div>\", \"That's understandable, given they've been waiting around Earth in limbo for thousands of years, during which time the Avengers \\u2013 a far less cerebral, much more crowd-friendly bunch \\u2013 have come along and stolen their thunder in the battle between good and evil. It's hard to be a god.\", \"But with Thanos vanquished and the world apparently back in order, the Eternals' old foes \\u2013 the beastly, Pok\\u00e9mon-on-steroids Deviants \\u2013 have been roused to villainy, and the astral humanoids are once again called upon to set the world right.\", \"The premise feels like a real diversion, at least at first, from the familiar action-plus-wisecracks formula that drives so much of the MCU \\u2013 a chance to refresh this overextended franchise and introduce a more contemplative, emotionally nuanced perspective.\", \"It's also a plus to see one of Marvel's most varied international casts up on screen, and the inclusion, however belated, of an unambiguously queer superhero in Phastos, and a deaf superhero, Makkari (played by deaf actor Ridloff).\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/fec91772561405b930f8bb986eb20cb5\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> \\u201cI am incredibly, incredibly grateful to Marvel for allowing me to play a character who reflects me back to me,\\\" said Brian Tyree Henry\\u00a0on The Kelly Clarkson Show.\\u00a0(Supplied: Disney)</div>\", \"How unfortunate, then, that they've been handed one of the most ponderous, enervating storylines in the franchise to date.\", \"\\\"At last, my boredom is ending,\\\" Makkari signs, as a battle finally stirs. For many viewers, theirs will only be getting started.\", \"With the world once again (sigh) under threat, Marvel's standard business of getting the team together kicks back in, and the film reverts to yet another extended set-up for future installments.

Zhao's storytelling is similarly choppy. There's little dramatic rhythm, and the characters barely resonate.\", \"As usual, the acclaimed filmmaker hasn't met a magic hour she couldn't film a scene against \\u2013 including a tacky visit to the still-smouldering ruins of Hiroshima \\u2013 but without the space for her natural docu-fiction tendencies she seems adrift, wrong-footed by Marvel's routine, action-heavy narrative.\", \"It's an awkward mix of unconvincing, pinball-machine Marvel action and earnest \\u2013 often confused \\u2013 sentiment.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c410d4fb230964d0ee5f40f9979d1d4d\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Ridloff\\u00a0told The Hollywood Reporter: \\u201cWe need a superhero that represents us [the deaf community].\\\"(Supplied: Disney/Sophie Mutevelian)</div>\", \"The film wants its audience to regard the Celestials as cold, emotionless architects to be challenged, but their overarching plans seem closer to the natural ebb and flow of the universe than the Eternals' \\u2013 and humanity's \\u2013 self-absorbed instinct for survival.\", \"In one particularly laughable scene, Sersi \\u2013 seriously \\u2013 gives a would-be moving speech about how she admires the humans' ability to live, laugh, love, despite the fact that there's nary a heaving mass of humanity to be seen in the film's airless void.\", \"Plenty of Marvel movies have induced tedium in non-believers, but this might be the first with a plot to literally send one of its antagonists into deep slumber.
