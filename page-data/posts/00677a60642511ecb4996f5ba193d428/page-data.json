It included samples from 41 people given three doses of Vaxzevria.\", \"Scientists and governments are scrambling to bolster defences against Omicron with shots and therapies, as the variant threatens to become dominant globally and has prompted renewed curbs ahead of the holidays to contain infections.\", \"Britain earlier this month backed the use of boosters after it found that a third dose significantly restored protection against mild disease caused by Omicron, in part reversing an otherwise steep drop in vaccine effectiveness.\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"00677a60642511ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"00677a60642511ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
