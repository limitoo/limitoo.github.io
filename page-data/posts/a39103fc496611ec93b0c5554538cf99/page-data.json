We have easy recipes. And here are a few of my personal favorites that I\\u2019ve made over the years: Melissa Clark\\u2019s simple roast turkey; the hashed brussels sprouts with lemon from Union Square Cafe in New York; Millie Peartree\\u2019s Southern mac and cheese; J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\u2019s cheesy Hasselback potato gratin; the mango pie Samin Nosrat adapted from Hrishikesh Hirway\\u2019s family; Samin\\u2019s squash and green curry soup; Yotam Ottolenghi\\u2019s roasted squash and red onions; Dorie Greenspan\\u2019s tall and creamy cheesecake; Jerrelle Guy\\u2019s sheet-pan pancakes; and, if you\\u2019re looking for a Hanukkah-Thanksgiving mashup, this potato kugel, which Francis Lam adapted from the cookbook \\u201cSpice and Spirit.\\u201d\", \"I\\u2019ve got weeknight recipes for you covered below, as always, and I\\u2019m also here for Thanksgiving recipe recommendations.

Happy Thanksgiving to you. \", \"Vallery Lomas\\u2019s spicy shrimp Creole, a southern Louisiana classic, is the type of stew that gives you weekend depth of flavor on a weeknight timetable. Keep a close eye on the roux as it cooks \\u2014\\u00a0as Vallery notes in the recipe headnote, a burned roux can\\u2019t be saved.\", \"View this recipe.\", \"I was sick this week, but not so sick that I couldn\\u2019t make chicken soup. Alexa Weibel\\u2019s clever recipe lets you do it quickly, and with a lot more flavor than other fast versions. I like to use egg noodles, but alphabet pasta would be cute. If you have more time, I highly recommend Julia Moskin\\u2019s ultra-classic chicken soup recipe.\", \"View this recipe.\", \"Eric Kim\\u2019s mother cooked this on weeknights all the time when he was a child, and the other day he told me he\\u2019d just made a vegetarian version for breakfast, using tofu. This is the kind of stew that people always describe as \\u201cbubbling,\\u201d which of course refers to its temperature, but I think also speaks to its ferocious flavor. \", \"View this recipe.\", \"Ali Slagle gives us a great way to use up sage, rosemary, thyme and oregano: Steep the herbs in cream for an easy pasta sauce.
