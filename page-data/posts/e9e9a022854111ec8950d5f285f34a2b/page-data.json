Amazon drew a profit of $14.3 billion for the three-month period ended December 31, 2021 on sales of $137.4 billion. It's the company's fifth consecutive quarter in which revenue topped $100 billion as Americans engaged in online retail therapy during the pandemic.\", \"The earnings beat Wall Street's expectations, and Amazon's stock soared 13% in after hours trading.\", \"The price of an annual membership to Amazon Prime is increasing to $139 from its current $119. Prime members who pay month-to-month will see their cost rise by $2 a month, to about $15.\\u00a0\", \"The $20 price hike for an annual Prime membership represents a 17% price increase \\u2014 or roughly three times the current rate of inflation.\", \"Those signing up for Prime for the first time will be charged the higher price starting February 18, while current members will see the new higher price after March 25, or whenever their membership renews, Amazon said.\\u00a0\", \"Amazon last increased its Prime membership price in 2018, and before that in 2014.

It is  also the case that, unlike Netflix, Amazon has not regularly increased  prices,\\\" Saunders wrote.\", \"Seattle-based Amazon was one of the few retailers that prospered during the  COVID-19 outbreak: As physical stores selling non-essential goods  temporarily or permanently closed, homebound people turned to Amazon for  everything from groceries to cleaning supplies.\", \"But growth has slowed as newly vaccinated Americans have felt more comfortable  going out. And the company, like many others, are dealing with global  supply chain issues and shortages of workers.\", \"\\\"Like  all retailers, Amazon has faced inflationary pressures right across its  supply chain and logistics operations and, even with its extensive  volume, scale and characteristic efficiency it has not been able to  mitigate the pressure.
