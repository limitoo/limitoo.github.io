She welcomed the two men\\u2019s exonerations, but added: \\u201cFull justice will not be served until all parties involved in the orchestrated killing of our father are identified and brought to justice.\\u201d\", \"The remarkable court hearing exonerating the two men, Khalil Islam and Muhammad A. Aziz, who had steadfastly maintained their innocence, clears up one corner of the historical record.\", \"But the Manhattan district attorney\\u2019s 22-month re-investigation of the case, conducted with lawyers for Mr. Islam and Mr. Aziz, was never meant to resolve the larger mysteries surrounding the crime, the lawyers said.\", \"\\u201cThere are many questions that are going to be asked about the culpability of the N.Y.P.D., about the culpability of the F.B.I.,\\u201d David B. Shanies, one of the lawyers for the two men, said. \\u201cI can say, as a general matter, our clients support any effort to get to the truth.\\u201d\", \"Among the more intriguing details from the district attorney\\u2019s exoneration motion: The shotgun that killed Malcolm X and was recovered at the scene can no longer be found.\", \"Official records that might shed light on what happened that day are also lost or have been heavily redacted.\", \"\\u201cThis brings us closer to understanding the mishandling of the prosecution, but there still remains the question of why those responsible were not investigated and prosecuted,\\u201d said Tamara Payne, who with her father, Les Payne, wrote the most detailed account yet of the murder, \\u201cThe Dead Are Arising: The Life of Malcolm X,\\u201d which won the 2021 Pulitzer Prize for biography.\", \"Doubts began before the 1966 trial of Mr. Islam and Mr. Aziz was even decided. The third man on trial, Mujahid Abdul Halim \\u2014 who at the time went by Talmadge Hayer or Thomas Hagan \\u2014 confessed to the killing, but he said that Mr. Aziz and Mr. Islam had nothing to do with it. With no evidence connecting Mr. Halim to the others, and no physical evidence at the crime scene, why the push to convict the two men?\", \"Scholars, including the Paynes, have focused on three areas of the case that remain unresolved: the role, if any, of Nation of Islam leaders in prompting or planning the assassination; the role of the New York Police Department, which had an undercover agent inside Malcolm X\\u2019s security team at the Audubon Ballroom, where the killing occurred; and the role of the F.B.I., which had blanket surveillance on the Nation of Islam and Malcolm X\\u2019s organization, and had fomented hostility between Malcolm X and Nation of Islam leaders at the sect\\u2019s Chicago headquarters.\", \"The Paynes\\u2019 book includes a tantalizing interview with a man the authors called Talib, who said he had witnessed the planning and aftermath of the killing firsthand at the Newark mosque to which most scholars believe the killers belonged.\", \"The re-investigation team was not able to identify the man.\", \"The district attorney\\u2019s motion also says the investigators \\u201cdid not uncover any evidence\\u201d to support theories that the murder had been \\u201corchestrated by the F.B.I. and/or the N.Y.P.D.\\u201d\", \"But many of the F.B.I. records related to the case remain heavily redacted, said David J. Garrow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian. Speculation about what lies behind the black bars on the documents that have been released so far \\u2014 and in any files that may still be buried in the bureau\\u2019s archives \\u2014 has flourished.\", \"\\u201cWhat remains murky is exactly what the chain of command was from Chicago to Newark and New York that brought the killers to the Audubon that day,\\u201d Mr. Garrow said.\", \"Interest in the case has waxed and waned over the years. In 1993, Mr. Garrow asked in The New York Times, \\u201cDoes Anyone Care Who Killed Malcolm X?\\u201d\", \"Since then, a steady drip of revelations has rekindled interest and incited speculation \\u2014 some well supported, some less so. More of the F.B.I. files have been made public under the Freedom of Information Act, along with a better understanding of how the bureau declined to share information with the police or prosecutors.\", \"Such information, the district attorney\\u2019s motion said, might have led to an acquittal for Mr. Aziz and Mr. Islam in 1966. It also might have sent investigators in search of wholly different suspects and a different theory of the crime.\", \"Ms. Payne said that in the decades that she and her father worked on their book, they hoped the revelations would lead prosecutors to indict the real killers. But even without that happening, she said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s important to know what happened to understand history.\\u201d\", \"After so long, the people Mr. Halim and scholars have named as the other killers are all believed to be dead. Ms. Payne declined to say whether there were any leads that she and her father had uncovered but been unable to resolve.\", \"Those questions still need to be asked and answered, she said. \\u201cIf it can be nailed down,\\u201d she said, \\u201cI think it should be.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"28b9bc8a4a0d11ecaa8d89ae3916858e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"28b9bc8a4a0d11ecaa8d89ae3916858e"}},
