Her first feature, \\u201cAll Is Forgiven,\\u201d from 2007, is getting its U.S. debut this week, and it confirms that the writer-director\\u2019s beguiling (and to some, confounding) cinematic voice was all but fully mature from the start.\", \"For its first two-thirds, \\u201cAll Is Forgiven\\u201d commits to an impartial portrayal of Victor (Paul Blain, rock-star charismatic), a would-be writer and feckless recreational drug user. Bouncing between Vienna and Paris with his Austrian partner, Annette (Marie-Christine Friedrich), and their precious 6-year-old daughter, Pamela, Victor finds that descending into full-time junkiedom is like falling off a log. His love for his wife and daughter is sincere, but in the face of his need for heroin, it ceases to matter. His dishonesty is unblinking and his violence unthinking. Hansen-Love depicts it all without a flinch.\", \"The movie then jumps 10 years ahead. As with her film \\u201cEden\\u201d (2015), the director does nothing to visibly age her adult actors; the space they inhabit is a circumscribed cinematic one, not a simulation of a realistic timeline. But Pamela has grown into a teenager (played by Constance Rousseau, the older sister of Victoire Rousseau, who plays the character as a child), and a now-cleaned-up Victor is eager to reconnect with her. Intrigued but cautious, Pamela agrees to meet, over her mother\\u2019s objections.\", \"Those familiar with Hansen-Love\\u2019s other films will not be too surprised that her scenario withholds certain story components that other directors might consider essential. Her movies have a delicacy of style that can make them seem gossamer-thin at first. But the atmosphere the director creates, once fully breathed in, has an emotional gravity that becomes devastating as it settles.\"]","href_hash":"61810f043d6111ec8344000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"61810f043d6111ec8344000017025a03"}},
