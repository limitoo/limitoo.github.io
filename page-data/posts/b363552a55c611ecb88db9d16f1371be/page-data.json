Her finishing time was the fourth fastest marathon debut for an American woman.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-05T04:28:00.000Z","content":"[\"MINNEAPOLIS \\u2014 There\\u2019s an adage among running coaches: Run your own race. Don\\u2019t focus on things you can\\u2019t control, including your competitors\\u2019 tactics.\", \"Last month Chris Lundstrom, the coach of Minnesota Distance Elite, watched as one of his athletes, Annie Frisbie, did just that in the New York City Marathon.\", \"Frisbie\\u2019s version of running her own race \\u2014 her debut marathon, at that \\u2014 involved her leading the field for the first half, ahead of Peres Jepchirchir of Kenya, the gold medalist in the marathon at the Tokyo Olympics, and Molly Seidel, the bronze medalist from the United States.\", \"Lundstrom, a Minnesotan through and through, might as well have reacted by saying, \\u201cOh, geez.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOn the one hand, you\\u2019re like, \\u2018Maybe don\\u2019t lead,\\u2019\\u201d he said gingerly, remembering seeing Frisbie for the first time along the marathon course in Brooklyn. He had given her a pretty simple race plan. Stay relaxed in the first half, and compete in the second half to the best of her ability.\", \"\\u201cIt was cool, but I also didn\\u2019t really let myself think about it too much,\\u201d Frisbie, 24, said of leading the stacked race. \\u201cI was mostly just focusing on checking in on myself and how I was feeling.\\u201d\", \"When Lundstrom saw her half-marathon split \\u2014 1 hour 12 minutes 43 seconds, a pace of 5 minutes 32 seconds per mile \\u2014 he said he reacted hesitantly again, thinking, \\u201cWell, OK, that\\u2019s aggressive, a little bit aggressive.\\u201d\", \"Frisbie would finish in an impressive 2 hours 26 minutes 18 seconds \\u2014 a time good enough for seventh place, and one that made her the third American overall. The results are still sinking in. She ran the fourth-fastest marathon debut for an American woman and became the fourth-fastest American woman ever to run the New York City Marathon.\", \"Frisbie is another female American distance runner who has carved out her own path in the sport and exceeded expectations, but who is uninterested in focusing on running and running alone. She\\u2019s in good company: Sarah Sellers famously took second place in the 2018 Boston Marathon while working as a nurse anesthetist. Keira D\\u2019Amato works as a real estate agent and finished fourth place in this year\\u2019s Chicago Marathon.\", \"Frisbie\\u2019s journey started in middle school in River Falls, Wis., when her mother told her to try volleyball or cross country. She didn\\u2019t really like volleyball, so she joined the cross-country team. She hadn\\u2019t considered running in college until recruiters expressed interest, and she realized the opportunity could help her pay for a higher education. So she ran track and cross country at Iowa State.\", \"She hadn\\u2019t really considered running professionally either. Frisbie wanted to be close to home and had already accepted an internship in the Twin Cities when a current teammate of hers told her about the Minnesota Distance Elite, a small group that meets three times a week to train athletes who range from 1,500-meter runners to marathoners.\", \"It\\u2019s a different type of team: one in which the runners \\u2014 and the coach \\u2014 have their occupations listed next to their personal-best times. Lundstrom is on the teaching faculty at the University of Minnesota school of kinesiology. He coaches teachers, an accountant, a data scientist and a software developer, among others.\", \"Frisbie said it was an easy decision to join. She accepted a job as a graphic designer for a health care start-up and began training with the group. Her colleagues were shocked to see their \\u201ccolleague who runs\\u201d on ESPN leading a major marathon.\", \"\\u201cHaving a more well-rounded life makes you a happier person and in turn a faster runner,\\u201d she said over a cider in Minneapolis, a city she intends to keep as her home base. And, she added, \\u201cIt would stress me out if I just ran and it wasn\\u2019t making me any money.\\u201d\", \"When asked about the reality of training as a professional running in Minnesota \\u2014 where weeks can go by without the temperature rising above zero and thin layers of ice and several feet of snow can cover the ground \\u2014 both Frisbie and Lundstrom said little more than \\u201cmeh.\\u201d Most cities that attract professional runners and teams have more temperate climates: Think Eugene, Ore.; Boulder, Colo.; or Flagstaff, Ariz.\", \"Sure, Frisbie and Lundstrom say, some speed workouts are done inside when it\\u2019s really icy. But long runs in the cold? Eh, no problem.\", \"After her breakout race, Frisbie has been inundated with messages from potential sponsors and agents. Suddenly races want her name on their lineups. It wouldn\\u2019t be unheard-of for an athlete in her position to quit her job, move to a more temperate climate and live and train with sponsorship dollars.\", \"It\\u2019s also tempting to look at a runner like Frisbie and slap a label next to her name. She could be one of the next great American distance runners, the next Sara Hall or Des Linden \\u2014 the rising athlete who could continue to shatter expectations.\", \"Frisbie and Lundstrom are holding back on all of the above. Frisbie is happy, healthy and at home in her current environment. Lundstrom is not looking to name a floor or ceiling for what\\u2019s next for the young marathoner.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not worth spending a ton of energy on dreaming about what\\u2019s possible when you just need to do all the things, and the athlete needs to stay healthy and make progress,\\u201d Lundstrom said.\", \"The \\u201cwork hard and be nice\\u201d Minnesota mentality was seeping through his every word: Don\\u2019t get a big ego. Don\\u2019t get ahead of yourself. Think about each workout as a steppingstone.\", \"Frisbie is talking to agents and former professional runners about their forays into the high-profile world of the sport, and she\\u2019s excited for all that\\u2019s to come. But at 24, she has the maturity of an athlete who has seen what can go wrong when a great race, and the pressure that follows, gets to your head.\", \"\\u201cIf you aren\\u2019t loving it at the moment, and you\\u2019re just forcing yourself to go through training and go through life, your chances of burning out are pretty high,\\u201d she said. \\u201cYou\\u2019re probably not going to make it for a 10- or 15-year career, which is what I hope to do. So I think you have to take each day in stride.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b363552a55c611ecb88db9d16f1371be"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b363552a55c611ecb88db9d16f1371be"}},
