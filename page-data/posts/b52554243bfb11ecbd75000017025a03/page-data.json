Now, he has another restaurant ready to make its debut next door. Called Four, it\\u2019s in a historic Victorian cottage. (The two restaurants connect by a glass-covered pavilion that functions as an expanded dining room for 2 Spring.) Four has just 10 upholstered seats at a marble counter surrounding a demonstration kitchen done in simple Scandinavian style with blond wood set within the cottage\\u2019s white brick and siding. A painting of Anthony Bourdain is a centerpiece on one wall, and a huge Bonnet range equipped with a Japanese charcoal grill helms the kitchen. There, Mr. Schenker will be onstage so to speak, preparing and serving a 10- to 12-course tasting menu, $245, for one of the more elevated dining experiences available on Long Island. Mr. Schenker said he missed the ad hoc menus he used to prepare on Mondays at Recette. \\u201cI am thrilled for the opportunity to cook in a similar intimate style for my guests,\\u201d he said. Among the dishes he\\u2019s planning are an oyster tartlet, langoustine with Champagne essence, rigatoni with giant clam and chiles, foie gras with a duck fat croissant, Mishima Wagyu with wasabi and onion, and chocolate pot de cr\\u00e8me. Mr. Schenker\\u2019s attention to detail will extend beyond the food and the list for 500 wines (from an underground cellar) to the tableware, with no pieces repeated throughout the dinner. Soon, he will open Provisions, a retail food shop, in a building around the corner. (Opens Thursday)\", \"This third location of Mermaid Inn, in the former Red Cat space in Chelsea, was open for just six days before lockdown in March 2020. It has reopened. The owners, Danny Abrams and Cindy Smith, have also announced that with a new partner, Jeff Bank, the chief executive of Alicart, which owns Carmine\\u2019s and Virgil\\u2019s, they will be opening a vast new Mermaid Inn next spring. It will be in the 15,000-square-foot space that housed Heartland Brewery at 127 West 43rd Street. \", \"Because indoor seating is very limited at its home base on Nassau Avenue, the restaurant arm of this fish market is taking up residence at Threes Brewing a few blocks away. (For now, there will be no restaurant service at the market.) From Friday through April 30, their oysters, salads, smoked fish p\\u00e2t\\u00e9, chowder, tacos, fried calamari and sandwiches will be on the menu for indoor and outdoor dining and takeaway. (Friday) \", \"This Greek steakhouse known for its spit-roasted lamb for two has reopened with a new consulting chef, Jean Charles M\\u00e9tayer, who has restaurants in Athens. The restaurateur James Paloumbis is now the managing partner. \", \"Montclair, N.J., is becoming a magnet for Daniel Boulud alumni. Dominique Paulin and Olivier Muller opened a brasserie, Faubourg, over two years ago. Now, Jayce Baudry, a native of Bordeaux who was a pastry chef at Daniel and \\u00c9picerie Boulud, has opened this classic p\\u00e2tisserie with a few cafe tables for instant gratification. His wife, Rebecca Baudry, also a pastry chef, is his partner in the business. \", \"Here\\u2019s an original restaurant name for sure. The chef, Joel Reiss, says it\\u2019d meant to convey a sense of mystery. Mr. Reiss, who worked at the Odeon, Orsay and Artisanal, has joined Frank and Pietro Pecora, the owners of Delizia 73, for the first restaurant he\\u2019s calling his own. (Mr. Reiss and the Pecoras are partners.) The food leans toward comfort with some original touches like Nashville-hot frog legs, vegetable fried rice with a marinated skirt steak, and chicken \\u201cParmanese,\\u201d a hybrid of Parm and Milanese made with fontina cheese. The 75-seat room has a tavern feel with exposed brick and some neon lights. (Wednesday) \", \"Patrick O\\u2019Connell, the owner and chef of the much-lauded Inn at Little Washington, has opened this cafe and bakery as a new addition to the hotel, cottages and formal dining room in this village west of Washington, D.C. It has a more casual dining room serving a seasonal menu, a sidewalk cafe, and a retail shop for baked goods, pastries and other items. Devin Bozkaya is the head chef, and Christian Capo is the head baker. Both have worked at the Inn. Lindsey Fern, the Inn\\u2019s wine director, is overseeing the wine here as well. The cafe and bakery were designed by Pierre-Yves Rochon, who is known for L\\u2019Atelier de Jo\\u00ebl Robuchon in New York and the Savoy in London, among many other projects. \", \"Daniel Boulud, who took over Augustine, the French restaurant that Keith McNally opened in the Beekman Hotel five years ago, said he didn\\u2019t plan to keep its name when he reopens it in the spring. But he does plan to retain much of the d\\u00e9cor. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll work with it; the charm will remain,\\u201d he said. He plans a bistro serving mostly classics, \\u201cmore classic than I have done,\\u201d he said, \\u201cwith a more chef-driven approach.\\u201d \", \"The Michelin guides will be expanding their reach in the United States next year. They are adding a guide to several parts of Florida: Miami and Dade County, Orlando and Orange County, and Tampa and Hillsborough County. In a statement, Gwendal Poullennec, the international director for the guides, said, \\u201cThe inspectors look forward to discovering the world-class culinary landscape in Miami, Orlando and Tampa.\\u201d The guide will not include destinations just north of Miami, like Fort Lauderdale or Palm Beach, nor will it include St. Petersburg for the Tampa region. The guide, Michelin\\u2019s fifth destination in the United States, is a partnership with the tourism agency Visit Florida. \", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
