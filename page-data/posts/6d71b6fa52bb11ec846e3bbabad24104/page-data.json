Boebert's hateful, anti-Muslim statements pose real-life dangers,\\\" the two groups wrote. \\\"When elected officials attack religious minorities, they can lay the groundwork for real violence against those communities.\\\"\", \"Boebert has been under fire since making anti-Muslim comments about Omar to an audience over the Thanksgiving holiday. The Republican congresswoman referred to Omar, a practicing Muslim, as a member of the \\\"Jihad Squad.\\\"\", \"A video also surfaced showing Boebert talking about being in an elevator with Omar and suggesting she was a terrorist.\", \"\\\"You know, we're leaving the Capitol and we're going back to my office and we get an elevator and I see a Capitol police officer running to the elevator. I see fret all over his face, and he's reaching, and the door's shutting, like I can't open it, like what's happening. I look to my left, and there she is. Ilhan Omar,\\\" Boebert said. \\\"And I said, 'Well, she doesn't have a backpack, we should be fine.\\\"\", \"Boebert later apologized on Twitter \\\"to anyone in the Muslim community I offended with my comment about Rep.
