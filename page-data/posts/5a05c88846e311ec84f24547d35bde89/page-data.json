And given the severity of our state\\u2019s ongoing drought, the amount of rain we get this winter couldn\\u2019t be of more importance.\", \"A recent outlook from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration suggests that the northern and southern halves of the state may experience diverging water fortunes this winter because of something you may already be familiar with: La Ni\\u00f1a.\", \"Like its climatological cousin El Ni\\u00f1o, La Ni\\u00f1a is a weather phenomenon that originates in the Pacific Ocean but can affect the whole world. La Ni\\u00f1a generally means drier, warmer conditions in the southern half of the United States and wetter weather in the northern half.\", \"Scientists predict that La Ni\\u00f1a this winter will lead to below average precipitation in a large swath of California, stretching from the Bay Area to the state\\u2019s southern border. They expect warmer than average temperatures for Southern California and eastern parts of Central California.\", \"These hot, dry conditions are obviously bad news after our warmest summer on record and before we\\u2019ve seen the end of fire season.\", \"But north of the Bay Area, where the drought is most extreme, things look more promising.\", \"The region falls in a \\u201cno man\\u2019s zone\\u201d where past La Ni\\u00f1as have brought a wide variety of fates \\u2014 warmer, drier, colder, hotter and average winters \\u2014 Jon Gottschalck, chief of the operational prediction branch of NOAA\\u2019s Climate Prediction Center, told me. So it\\u2019s difficult to know how this year will play out.\", \"Yet even with that uncertainty, the climate center predicts that the drought will probably improve north of the Bay Area this winter. The rest of the state is expected to see worsening drought conditions.\", \"These forecasts are based on analyses of what has happened in the past as well as climate models. The important thing to remember is that there are no guarantees.\", \"In the winter of 2016-17, as California grappled with a severe drought, La Ni\\u00f1a conditions emerged. Unexpectedly, California got so much rain that, after six years, the state declared the drought over.\", \"Can San Francisco get people to return to the theater?\", \"Across California, $1.8 million homes.\", \"How to make your Thanksgiving dinner less boring.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from Ahna Heller, a reader who lives in Davis.
