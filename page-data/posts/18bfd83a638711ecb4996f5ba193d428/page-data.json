Our platform and approach will equip people to be prepared for that.\\\"\", \"The secret to SpFN's wide effectiveness is down to its \\\"soccer ball-shaped protein with 24 faces\\\", Defense One reports. The faces allowed researchers to attach the spikes of multiple COVID-19 strains on different faces of the protein.\", \"Dr Modjarrad told Defense One the vaccine was a \\\"very exciting\\\" breakthrough.\", \"The vaccine has already exhibited promising results, both in animal trials and the first phase of its human trials.\", \"Walter Reed expects to announce that trials show it's had success fighting off Omicron - good news in the battle against a strain spreading like wildfire and prompting tighter restrictions across the globe.\", \"A review of the phase 1 trial is still needed, as are phase 2 and 3 trials, before the vaccine is ready to be administered more widely.\", \"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"18bfd83a638711ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"18bfd83a638711ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
