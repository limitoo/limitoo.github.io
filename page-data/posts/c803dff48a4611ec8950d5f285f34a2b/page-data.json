Looking ahead, there are additional challenges posed by Omicron.\", \"\\\"These challenges will likely be operational, where the last two years have been defined by suppressed demand. Now demand is recovering in many of our markets, but we are preparing for further disruption in local supply chains and for labour issues in a tight labour market.\\\"\", \"Reidie said Sanford was focusing on challenges it could control, which included having a fully vaccinated workforce, operating teams in bubbles and putting in plans to manage absenteeism due to Covid-19.\", \"The company also acknowledged other challenges, such as rising ocean temperatures, which could impact aquaculture operations.\", \"\\\"We have seen warmer than usual waters in our Big Glory Bay salmon farm for January. This has had some impact on salmon mortalities, although these were not outside the previous three year's average for this month.\", \"\\\"We are managing this carefully with lower stocking densities and additional aeration in all our salmon pens. However, the period ahead from March to May is traditionally a critical one for oxygen levels and algae, so we will continue to monitor and manage carefully.\\\"\", \"Sanford said it was looking at options for its crayfish quota, which it fished and managed through third parties, and could result in its sale.\", \"The company said it planned to reach a decision before the April start of the quota year for crayfish.\"]","href_hash":"c803dff48a4611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c803dff48a4611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
