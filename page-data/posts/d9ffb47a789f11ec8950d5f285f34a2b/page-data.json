There were no offers at the minimum bidding price, according to the notary overseeing the sale.\", \"Aside from Caravaggio\\u2019s fresco \\u2014 \\u201cJupiter, Neptune and Pluto,\\u201d which he painted for the villa\\u2019s first owner, Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte, in 1597 \\u2014 the villa has ceiling frescoes by other Baroque masters, including Giovanni Francesco Barbieri, better known as Guercino. His fresco in the main hall of the Roman goddess of dawn, \\u201cAurora,\\u201d gave the villa its name.\", \"The villa has been the property of the Boncompagni Ludovisi family for 400 years. But an inheritance dispute between the widow of Prince Nicol\\u00f2 Boncompagni Ludovisi, who died in 2018 at age 77, and his three sons from his first marriage prompted a judicial order to sell it.\", \"Any buyers would need very deep pockets because the villa requires at least \\u20ac10 million for restoration work, said Alessandro Zuccari, a professor at the University of Rome who was tasked by the Rome court overseeing the inheritance dispute to establish the villa\\u2019s monetary value. \\u201cI told the magistrate it was priceless, from a cultural point of view; she told me I had to come up with a number,\\u201d he said.\", \"Most of the villa\\u2019s value rests in the Caravaggio fresco \\u2014 valued at \\u20ac310 million. Professor Zuccari said the overall price was justified because of the villa\\u2019s \\u201cimmense cultural value.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhat building in the world has a wall painting by Caravaggio near a wall painting by Guercino?\\u201d he asked. The villa also includes works by other well-known 17th-century artists and antique Roman statuary.\", \"Thousands of people visited the auction website, where a video provides an exhaustive gallery of images of the property\\u2019s art.\", \"Meanwhile, an online petition signed by nearly 39,000 people called on Dario Franceschini, Italy\\u2019s culture minister, to use European Union funds to buy the villa at the asking price. The ministry also has the right to match any offers for the villa, should a buyer emerge.\", \"Princess Rita Boncompani Ludovisi, the American-born third wife of the deceased Prince Nicol\\u00f2 Boncompagni Ludovisi, who has lived in the villa for the better part of two decades, said she had mixed feelings about the failed auction. \\u201cI had hoped for some kind of resolution today,\\u201d she said, adding that she had come to terms with leaving.\", \"As the villa\\u2019s guardian, she made it available to scholars, and gave personalized tours and dinners to help pay for its upkeep. She and her late husband \\u201cput everything into Villa Aurora,\\u201d she said.\", \"T. Corey Brennan, a classics professor at Rutgers University who has been working on the Boncompagni Ludovisi archives for over a decade, said that much remained to be discovered in the villa.\", \"In recent years, frescoes have been detected behind false and dropped ceilings in the villa, and have yet to be fully uncovered and restored, Professor Brennan said.\", \"And a \\u201cfull subterranean underground survey of the villa,\\u201d carried out with noninvasive ground-penetrating radar and other techniques, show that it is sitting on massive remains that dwarf the size of the villa.\", \"\\u201cIf you were able to start digging, you would immediately hit Roman remains,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not just what\\u2019s there but what is certainly there that excites me.\\u201d\", \"The villa will return to the block on April 7, its cost slashed by 20 percent to a mere \\u20ac377 million.\", \"\\u201cWe go onward,\\u201d Princess Rita said in a telephone interview. \\u201cHere we are.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"d9ffb47a789f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d9ffb47a789f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
