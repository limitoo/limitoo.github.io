the\\u00a0world's fastest-moving predatory plant, which survives\\u00a0by sucking animals into a trap and eating them alive.\", \"Although the hunting tactics sound messy, they are in fact so covert that no one has managed to identify exactly what species of animals the plants are ingesting.\", \"Mr Krueger, a PhD student at Curtin University, hopes to change that.\", \"<img

\"The\\u00a0plant has an underwater bladder attached to its stem, which is surrounded by small hairs that act as trip-wires.\", \"When an animal moves past the trip-wire, it triggers the bladder to open and\\u00a0suck\\u00a0the prey inside.\", \"This happens in a fraction of a millisecond;\\u00a0more than 100 times more quickly than a Venus fly trap.\\u00a0\", \"The animal is then digested within the bladder structure.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What are the plants eating?\\u00a0</div>\", \"Mr Krueger plans to use a technique called DNA metabarcoding to work out what species of animal the plants are eating.\", \"Adam Cross, an ecologist from Curtin University, said that previous studies of the bladderwort's diet\\u00a0had involved\\u00a0looking at the traps under a microscope and trying to see what was there.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c430f918546a01b97262f8a52553c1f8\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div
