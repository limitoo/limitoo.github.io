Of those patients, 73 are in intensive care units, with 28 people on ventilators.\", \"The state reported 7169 new infections - 2703 from PCR results and 4466 from RATs.\", \"It is the lowest daily case count since 31 December, just before the Omicron wave saw an explosion of new infections. The testing system was under immense strain at the time, and the official count was thought to not represent the real number of cases in the community.\", \"The is now 60,917 people with active infections in the state. The number of new infections reported each day and the rate of hospitalisations has been trending steadily downwards for the past three weeks.\", \"Meanwhile, the number of deaths reported each week has stayed tragically high, with 41 fatalities recorded in Saturday's update.

None had received their booster.\", \"Dr Gerrard said the pattern in the state's deaths was becoming \\\"increasingly clear\\\".\", \"\\\"Most of the deaths we are seeing in Queensland are in the un-boosted older age group, so un-boosted older Queenslanders are at highest risk of death.\", \"\\\"Also, there is a significant risk of serious illness and death in the unvaccinated younger age group as well, but as we're now close to 90 percent double-vaxxed, we focus more and more on those boosters in that older age group.\\\"\", \"There have been a total of 277 Covid-related deaths in the state since the start of the pandemic, with 268 of those occurring since 13 December, when Queensland's border reopened.\", \"There were reports on Saturday that the Covid-stricken Jeta Gardens facility would be evacuated, after Covid-19 claimed the lives of 15 residents and infected almost 200 residents and staff.
