means police cannot access its facial recognition technology (FRT) without laws to protect people's privacy.\", \"Adelaide City Council is replacing its ageing CCTV network with 360-degree cameras that have the capability for facial and number plate recognition, as well as low-light performance and object tracing.\", \"The council originally planned to leave\\u00a0what functions were utilised to the discretion of SA Police (SAPOL),\\u00a0but an amendment proposed by councillor Phil Martin means the camera's FRT capabilities cannot be accessed.\", \"\\\"The police will be asked to provide a formal agreement that they will not use FRT unless, and until,\\u00a0the Parliament of SA passes legislation providing guidelines,\\\" he said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Controversial tech</div>\", \"The move follows a 2021 report from the Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) that called for all states and territories to implement a moratorium on biometric technologies, including FRT, until laws were reformed to protect citizens from harmful surveillance.\", \"This included laws to regulate the technology's use so it expressly protected human rights, applying it to decision-making that had significant legal effects upon individuals, or where there was a high risk to human rights, such as in policing and law enforcement.\", \"It also wanted a statutory cause of action for serious invasions of privacy\\u00a0and safeguards that prevented misuse and avoid injustices, such as if FRT falsely identifying\\u00a0innocent people as criminals.\", \"<img

recognition in CCTV cameras.(7.30)</div>\", \"The introduction of FRT has been attracting\\u00a0criticism worldwide about privacy breaches and surveillance overreach.\", \"Earlier this month, social media giant Facebook shut down its facial recognition system and deleted the faceprints of more than one billion people amid growing concerns about the technology and its misuse.\", \"In Hong Kong during August 2019, smart lampposts were destroyed by pro-democracy protesters due to fears about FRT being used by Chinese authorities.\", \"<img

and cut it down.(ABC News: Brant Cumming)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">SA Police already using it</div>\", \"But in Adelaide's CBD, SAPOL is already using FRT after successful trials were held in 2017 to apply software to CCTV, ATM, and some social media footage, with its NEC NeoFace system fully implemented in 2019.\", \"A police spokesperson said it was considered an \\\"valuable investigate tool\\\" that helped to \\\"identify a suspect for a crime which, at times, can also prevent further crime\\\".\", \"\\\"Images are compared to a database that consists of photos of people that have previously been arrested in South Australia,\\\" he said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/f2d6715dae6ee6a1139fbba459fbada0\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The state government last decade installed about 24 CCTV cameras in a corridor through Adelaide's west end.(ABC Radio Adelaide: Malcolm Sutton)</div>\", \"The spokesperson said there were \\\"robust policies, practices, and procedures in place to ensure that the administration of the database is withing legislative requirements\\\".\", \"He said SAPOL was only providing an advisory capacity for Adelaide City Council's network upgrade \\\"and had no involvement in the final decision as to who wins the tender\\\".\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">A question of proportionality</div>\", \"Cr Martin said there was no doubt there were \\\"enormous advantages\\\" to FRT, particularly by law enforcement agencies in the prevention of major crime.\", \"\\\"It's been useful in tracking the movements of people like terrorists, or those suspected of terrorism, and I can see it has great use, but it does require some kind of framework that governs its use,\\\" he said.\", \"Cr Martin also posed questions about how data on citizens would be retained.\", \"He pointed out that despite state government promises that QR code check-in information would be deleted after 28 days as part of SA's COVID-19 response, the state auditor-general found that SA Health was, in fact, retaining such data indefinitely.\", \"\\\"How many times have we been to Foodland? How many times have we been to the pokies? Is it reasonable for that sort of information to be retained?\\\" Cr Martin said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0594e8bcc7d9e26d431d71fee23b0ec5\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Adelaide City Council's new network will also have 360-degree and low light capabilities.(ABC Radio Adelaide: Malcolm Sutton)</div>\", \"Law Society of SA president Rebecca Sandford said the society recognised the potential benefits to the \\\"appropriate use of FRT in investigating serious crime and mitigating threats to safety\\\", but backed the AHRC Report on Human Rights on Technology.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b8108209b780c21e485cf2abee60bd02\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The federal government is funding the $3 million CCTV network upgrade.(ABC Radio Adelaide: Malcolm Sutton)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">18-month roll-out</div>\", \"ACC's City Safe CCTV Network upgrade,\\u00a0funded by the federal government,\\u00a0will be rolled out over the next 18 months, with the council hoping the state government can implement a legislative framework before it is completed.\", \"A state government spokesperson said it was \\\"always considering new and emerging technologies and what protections and safeguards are in place\\\".\", \"The SA government earlier this year utilised a FRT app as part of its home quarantine trials and, as part of reforms to reduce problem gamblers, has also promoted FRT use by pokie venues to prevent barred patrons from entering venues.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0f4ff9764970c68f0b76ff3b27a1a548\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> SA Police say facial recognition is a valuable investigative tool to identify suspects and prevent further crimes.(ABC Radio Adelaide: Malcolm Sutton)</div>\"]","href_hash":"afa0737041d511ecab3cbbc73bee5e0c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"afa0737041d511ecab3cbbc73bee5e0c"}},
