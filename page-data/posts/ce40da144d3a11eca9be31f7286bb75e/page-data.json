The old man was carefully inspecting the dusty instrument that I\\u2019d brought to his workshop, and he had seen enough. \\u201cUna porquer\\u00eda! I cannot fix this. Well, I could, but it would make more sense for you to buy a better one.\\u201d\", \"He put down his cigarette and picked up another accordion that was sitting on his wooden worktable. It was large and white and shiny. \\u201cNow, this is an accordion. Italian-made. Listen.\\u201d\", \"He began to play, and suddenly, thick-sounding notes filled the small, dark room. I looked around: All along the white walls were shelves crammed with skeletons from the past half-century of his work: wood casings, sagging bellows, and mangled keyboards that looked like irreparably crooked teeth. The room itself smelled like a mix of cigarette smoke, musty wood and drying glue.\", \"Here \\u2014 in a side office, up the stairs of an unmarked building hidden away on a block of the city center jammed with flashy music stores that used thumping loudspeakers to attract customers \\u2014 was the workshop of one of this city\\u2019s oldest and most venerated accordion repairmen.\", \"\\u201cEverything I do is to improve the sound,\\u201d Ram\\u00edrez, now 76, likes to say of his work. \\u201cI\\u2019m a technician, always refining, always refining.\\u201d\", \"Day after day, for nearly 50 years, he has been visited by musicians \\u2014 mariachis and norte\\u00f1os, buskers and maestros \\u2014 gently cradling their injured instruments like small children. He has done repairs for performers as famous as Los \\u00c1ngeles Azules, Los Rieleros del Norte, Los Tigres del Norte and Mon Laferte, among many others.\", \"I am not one of these musicians. But a few years earlier, I\\u2019d decided I wanted to learn to play the accordion. Though the earliest iteration of the instrument was invented in Europe in the early 1800s, migrations both forced and voluntary brought different versions to cultures around the world.\", \"As a result, all my life I\\u2019d grown up around its enchantments: In America, my maternal grandparents, Jewish Iraqis to their core, long listened to the accordions in Mohammed Abdel Wahab and Umm Kulthum\\u2019s Arab orchestras and recalled the worlds they left behind. My abuelos, born and raised in Argentina, still spend their days in the company of the similarly sweet bandoneon, a fixture of the melancholic tangos of An\\u00edbal Troilo and Carlos Gardel.\", \"My own childhood in the New York suburbs was marked by the old-time folksy squeezebox singalongs of \\u201cYou Are My Sunshine\\u201d and \\u201cOh, Susanna!\\u201d I often wondered how a single instrument could sound, from one moment to the next, so joyous and then so sad.\", \"Most of the accordion\\u2019s now-widespread influence in Mexico came down from the rural Texas borderlands, where Germanic migrants settled in the 19th century and brought their music with them; still today certain norte\\u00f1o styles can easily pass for waltzes or polkas, and the sweet, rambling melodies have bled into banda, corridos and cumbia, too.\", \"In Mexico City, you hear accordions on the radio in taxicabs and at restaurants where mariachis serenade diners. But more than anywhere, it seems, you hear them in the streets: along the smog-filled boulevards and in the leafy, cobblestone plazas and between the noisy market stands of vendors hawking roasted corn and leather knapsacks and coffee from large clay pots.\", \"My problem, as quite the uneducated accordionist, was that I had precisely no idea what I was looking for. All of the casas de m\\u00fasica, which sold new accordions that glistened in glass cases, said that to come across one in my price range \\u2014 which was not high \\u2014 I would have to look secondhand. And that the best secondhand music market in Mexico was on Tuesdays in a neighborhood in the south of the city called Tasque\\u00f1a.\", \"Each week in Tasque\\u00f1a, some 100 musicians from the Sindicato \\u00danico de Trabajadores de la M\\u00fasica (the Mexican Union of Music Workers) line up their stands along a service road for long-distance buses pulling into the city\\u2019s southern bus terminal; the sounds of buzzing snares and tuning guitars echo over the grumble of diesel coaches bound for Oaxaca or Cuernavaca.\", \"There doesn\\u2019t seem to exist an instrument that can\\u2019t be found, on the right day, at the Tasque\\u00f1a bazaar: I\\u2019ve seen clarinets and tubas and trombones, cowbells and g\\u00fciros and tambourines, vihuelas and ukuleles and 12-string guitars, and, of course, accordions. Endless accordions. There are tiny accordions meant for children, and large accordions wider than children. There are button accordions and piano accordions and sometimes even bandoneons, too.\", \"At the end of the block that particular morning was an older couple who presided over a few colorful, medium-size accordions laid out in a patch of grass. On the road beside them was a white Volkswagen buggy truck with its doors splayed open and more instruments inside. I haggled with a sickly-looking man who wore a surgical face mask (this was surprising, in prepandemic times), and a few minutes later I left, beaming, with a red accordion in an old wooden case. I\\u2019d paid just over $100.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019ve been taken for a ride.\\u201d\", \"Ram\\u00edrez did not beat around the bush. In this way, with an accordion needing help, I first found myself in his musty old shop in 2019, and he spent most of our time simply surveying the damage. Recently I went back to visit him again, more interested this time in learning about his life and craft than in procuring his services.\", \"Two years had passed and a pandemic had torn through the world and I was glad to see that he was still there. The skeleton accordions, from which he pulled spare keys and parts, were still collecting dust on shelves in the darker half of the room. Two cigarette butts smoldered in his round ashtray when I arrived, and he added three more in as many hours while I was with him.\", \"During our conversation, two men appeared at the door, accompanied by several teenage boys. They revealed a black Farinelli accordion in a camouflage bag. Immediately Ram\\u00edrez took it in his hands and began to test the notes.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s lots of air leaking out,\\u201d he explained to the men, pointing at the accordion\\u2019s bellows. \\u201cIt sounds ugly. We need to fix that sound.\\u201d He put the instrument on his table and, with a pair of silver pliers, plucked out the thin nails that held the casing together. The bass side came apart first. \\u201cOh, it\\u2019s all messed up. We\\u2019ll have to fine-tune it, change the reeds, so that it sounds like a real accordion.\\u201d He closed it back up.\", \"\\u201cAnd how much?\\u201d one of the men asked timidly.\", \"\\u201cFor everything, 3200 pesos,\\u201d Ram\\u00edrez replied. Not much more than $150. \\u201cIt will be like new, better than new.\\u201d He took down another accordion from his shelf to play a few notes, to show the musicians what theirs could sound like if they entrusted him with it.\", \"\\u201cAgh,\\u201d one of the boys in the back whispered to another. \\u201cIt\\u2019s beautiful.\\u201d\", \"The older men, clearly the leaders of the group \\u2014 Los Principes del Bolero, they said, handing me their card \\u2014 looked at each other for a moment. The price was good. They would return in an hour for a tuneup, enough to get them through their next gig, and bring it back for the full repair, which would take a week.\", \"To fix the troubled keys that no longer made sounds, Ram\\u00edrez replaced their corresponding metal reeds on the interior voice box. To each new note he applied a hard blue wax, which he\\u2019d boiled in a small blue pot on a portable electric stove beside him, and a tiny, thin piece of film. With an electric soldering iron he melted the wax, a strong adhesive, and a weak smoke rose from the wood.\", \"\\u201cNow for the moment of truth.\\u201d He brought the voice box up to his mouth and blew into each new note like playing the harmonica, making a few adjustments as he went. Then he screwed the voice box back into the accordion, closed it up, played some major chords. The sound was noticeably fuller, sweeter.\", \"\\u201cGood,\\u201d Ram\\u00edrez smiled. \\u201cI just made 750 pesos.\\u201d He cracked open a Coke and lit another cigarette.\", \"Throughout the day, the pleasant sound of accordion music wafted through the halls of the building. Most of the time it was not coming from Ram\\u00edrez\\u2019s room but from the one next door. As it turns out, to celebrate 50 years on the job, Ram\\u00edrez had recently retired, working now mostly for pleasure and handing the reins of the business to his son.\", \"Over the course of his career, Ram\\u00edrez took on many apprentices \\u2014 \\u201cHere, accordion repair schools don\\u2019t exist,\\u201d he said \\u2014 but none of them has made him prouder than Luis Adri\\u00e1n Ram\\u00edrez, a professional accordion player who, not long after learning the trade from his father, joined him at Servicio Ram\\u00edrez Acordeones, making it a business of two and extending the generational line of a family deeply rooted in the musical traditions of the Americas.\", \"\\u201cMy abuela was a piano teacher; she lived for music,\\u201d Ram\\u00edrez recalled. \\u201cThat\\u2019s where our musical abilities come from.\\u201d His father, who never learned music as a child, later in life picked up instruments and started playing them almost immediately. \\u201cThat\\u2019s where our musical sensibilities come from.\\u201d\", \"For Luis Adri\\u00e1n, inheriting the family business has been a long time in the making. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been working with him since I was 12 years old,\\u201d he said of his father. \\u201cIt is an honor.\\u201d\", \"For the elder Ram\\u00edrez, the technicalities of music have been the biggest draw. \\u201cI\\u2019ve always been more interested in fixing accordions than playing them,\\u201d he said.\", \"Nearly 50 years of work has given him plentiful resources. When he was just starting out, and couldn\\u2019t buy the right parts, he improvised by extracting metal pieces from shoe heels and book bindings. From under a thin blanket on his shelf, next to some felts and skins and leathers, he pulled out loose sheets of yellowing paper \\u2014 hand-drawn diagrams of all the different possible chromatic tunings of an accordion.\", \"People still send him instruments from other countries \\u2014 Colombia, Guatemala, the United States \\u2014 to be tuned, tweaked or overhauled. For a time, years ago, he used to make house calls to faraway states and remote pueblos, often carrying his tools on muleback, up foggy hills and along craggy creeks swelled with rain. \\u201cThese were communities that didn\\u2019t have electricity in those days,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThey did things by candlelight, but they had accordions.\\u201d\", \"At this stage in life, he said, he\\u2019s happy the business has taken a back seat. \\u201cI just like to do good work,\\u201d he said. If a young person comes in, or someone just barely scraping by, sometimes he won\\u2019t charge them at all. \\u201cYou always have to return an instrument better than when you got it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ce40da144d3a11eca9be31f7286bb75e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ce40da144d3a11eca9be31f7286bb75e"}},
