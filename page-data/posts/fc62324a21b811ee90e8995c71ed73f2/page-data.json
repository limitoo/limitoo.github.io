Tommy Tuberville has been\\u00a0blocking military nominations and promotions over the military abortion policy, which covers certain abortion-related travel expenses for service members based in states with restrictive reproductive healthcare laws. Tuberville is exercising the hold until the Pentagon or new legislation changes the policy.\", \"Clark said Democrats would also \\\"fight\\\" on the floor against other \\\"culture war\\\" amendments to the defense bill. They include cutting diversity, equity and inclusion offices; prohibiting the use of federal funding for diversity, equity and inclusion training.\", \"There are also Republicans who want to add language prohibiting the sale or transfer of cluster munitions to Ukraine; and cutting Ukraine funding by $300 million. However, one senior House Armed Services Committee member told CBS News he projects approximately 30 Republican House members would support stripping the aid, far short of the number needed to do so.\", \"The top Democrat on the House Armed Services committee, Washington Rep. Adam Smith, told CBS News on Tuesday that Republican leadership would likely need Democratic votes to pass the defense bill, because he expected a \\\"chunk\\\" of Republicans to oppose it over the changes to Ukraine funding. Republicans can only afford to lose four votes without Democratic help.\", \"House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries accused Republicans of jeopardizing its passage.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's outrageous that this is what Republicans are doing,\\\" Jeffries said. \\\"With the defense bill, it should be about our national security.\\\"\", \"House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said he is hopeful the defense bill will pass by Friday with bipartisan support.
