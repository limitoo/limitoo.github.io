Maxwell was charged with six federal counts related to Epstetin's alleged sex trafficking ring.\\u00a0\", \"Maxwell, 59, pleaded not guilty to the charges stemming from her interactions with four teenage girls from 1994 to 2004. During that span, Maxwell was romantically involved with and then later worked for Epstein. She faces over 70 years in prison if convicted.\", \"Maxwell opted not to testify in her own defense at trial, and has denied the allegations detailed in the indictment and all claims of wrongdoing.\\u00a0\", \"The jury heard testimony from the four accusers at the center of the case. Three of them opted for anonymity, using either pseudonyms or first names only, and were known to the jury as Jane Doe, Kate and Carolyn. The final accuser to testify was Annie Farmer, who, along with her sister Maria Farmer, have been vocal about the sexual abuse they say each experienced at the hands of Epstein and Maxwell. The sisters were among the first women to report Epstein's alleged sexual abuse to authorities.\", \"-Nathalie Nieves contributed reporting\"]","href_hash":"6d4a009868f411ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6d4a009868f411ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
