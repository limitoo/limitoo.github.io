Beck, whose brand of pragmatic, thought-monitoring psychotherapy became the centerpiece of a scientific transformation in the treatment of depression, anxiety and many related mental disorders, died on Monday at his home in Philadelphia. He was 100.\", \"His death was confirmed by Alex Shortall, an executive assistant at the Beck Institute for Cognitive Behavior Therapy in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., outside Philadelphia. Dr. Beck\\u2019s daughter Dr. Judith Beck is its president.\", \"Dr. Beck was a young psychiatrist trained in Freudian analysis when, in the late 1950s, he began prompting patients to focus on distortions in their day-to-day thinking, rather than on conflicts buried in childhood, as therapists typically did. He discovered that many people generated what he called \\u201cautomatic thoughts,\\u201d unexamined assumptions like \\u201cI\\u2019m just unlucky in love\\u201d or \\u201cI\\u2019ve always been socially inept,\\u201d which can give rise to self-criticism, despair and self-defeating attempts to compensate, like promiscuity or heavy drinking.\", \"Dr. Beck found that he could undermine those assumptions by prompting people to test them out in the world \\u2014 say, by socializing without alcohol to observe what happens \\u2014 and to gather countervailing evidence from their own experience, like memories of healthy relationships. Practicing these techniques, in therapy sessions and in homework exercises, fostered an internal dialogue that gradually improved people\\u2019s mood, he showed.\", \"Dr. Beck\\u2019s work, along with that of Albert Ellis, a psychologist working independently, provided the architecture for what is known as cognitive behavior therapy, or C.B.T. Over the past several decades, C.B.T. has become by far the world\\u2019s most extensively studied form of psychotherapy. In England, it forms the basis for a nationwide treatment program offering a number of related talk therapies.\", \"\\u201cThere is more to the surface than meets the eye,\\u201d Dr. Beck was fond of saying.\", \"The influence of C.B.T. on the treatment of mental disorders is hard to exaggerate. Researchers have adapted the approach \\u2014 originally developed for depression \\u2014 to manage panic attacks, addictions, eating disorders, social anxiety, insomnia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Therapists teach a variation to help parents manage children\\u2019s outbursts at home, and some have used it, in combination with medication, to manage the delusions and hallucinations of schizophrenia. Sports psychologists have made use of the principles for performance anxiety.\", \"Dr. Beck, who spent his career at the University of Pennsylvania, led the way.\", \"\\u201cOne by one, he took each condition in psychiatry and laid out his thinking about how it should be addressed \\u2014 and others followed up,\\u201d said David Clark, a professor of psychology at Oxford University, who designed and helped institute England\\u2019s talk therapy program. \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure that that\\u2019s ever been done, in quite that way.\\u201d\", \"Steven Hollon, a psychologist at Vanderbilt University, said of Dr. Beck: \\u201cHe took a hundred years of dogma, found that it didn\\u2019t hold up, and invented something brief, lasting and effective to put in its place. He basically saved psychotherapy from itself.\\u201d\", \"Aaron Temkin Beck, known to friends and colleagues as Tim, was born in Providence, R.I., on July 17, 1921, the youngest of four children of Russian Jewish immigrants. His father was a printer who had socialist leanings and wrote poetry; his mother ran the household. \", \"As a child, Aaron was in perpetual motion. He was a Boy Scout who played basketball and football with friends until age 8, when he developed a serious infection after surgery for a broken arm. The month he spent in the hospital became a pivotal experience, turning him toward more intellectual pursuits, like reading and writing.\", \"After high school, he entered Brown University, finishing summa cum laude in 1942. He went on to get a medical degree from Yale University and did his residency in psychiatry at the Cushing Veterans Administration Hospital in Framingham, Mass.\", \"He was still in training at the Philadelphia Psychoanalytic Institute (now the Psychoanalytic Center of Philadelphia) when he began to have doubts about the scientific basis of Freud\\u2019s open-ended talk therapy, which was then the gold standard of treatment in American psychiatry. Though Freudian analysts agreed that there were \\u201cdeep factors at work\\u201d in many cases of mental distress, Dr. Beck told The New York Times in 2000, no one could agree on what they were.\", \"After searching in vain to find some empirical basis for Freud\\u2019s ideas, he began to focus on patients\\u2019 thinking in the here and now. For years he worked in relative obscurity, unsure of his footing and supported primarily by his wife, Phyllis, whom he called his \\u201creality tester.\\u201d (He and Phyllis Whitman married in 1950.) Judge Phyllis W. Beck, who is now retired and survives him, was the first woman to serve on the Pennsylvania Superior Court.\", \"In addition to her and his daughter Judith, Dr. Beck is survived by another daughter, Alice Beck Dubow, a judge in the Pennsylvania courts; two sons, Roy and Daniel; 10 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.\", \"Dr. Beck openly cited the influence of other thinkers, like the German psychoanalyst Karen Horney (1885-1952), the American psychoanalyst George Kelly (1905-1967) and Dr. Ellis, in developing his ideas. Dr. Ellis\\u2019s \\u201crational emotive behavior therapy,\\u201d as Dr. Ellis called it, shared many common-sense principles with Dr. Beck\\u2019s approach.\", \"In contrast with Dr. Ellis, a flamboyant, tough-love father figure who died in 2007, Dr. Beck came across as an affectionate paterfamilias. Smiling softly beneath a rich sweep of white hair, wearing a bright bow tie and tailored suit, he engaged patients gently, chipping away at defeating beliefs with Socratic questions: Would you agree it is against your interests to have this belief? Do you think it\\u2019s possible to ignore these thoughts?\", \"He had a different effect, however, on many of his contemporaries. When he first described his approach, Freudian analysts ventured that he \\u201chad not been well analyzed,\\u201d the ultimate insider\\u2019s put-down, implying that he was unequipped to understand others because he had not fully understood himself in his training therapy.\", \"Later, in the 1980s, Dr. Beck was hit from the other side: So-called biological psychiatrists, who focused on drug treatments, questioned the strength of C.B.T. studies, saying that they were unimpressive compared with drug trials. To the extent that the therapy worked, argued Dr. Donald Klein, then director of the New York State Psychiatric Institute, it was because of a general morale-boosting effect rather than a specific, targeted treatment. \", \"Dr. Beck hardened with a blunt New England edge when challenged. But he typically responded with a pile of new data, and avoided being drawn into intellectual blood feuds with other theorists.\", \"Cognitive therapy spread worldwide, in part because therapists found it useful and in part because its techniques could be summarized simply in manuals, making it easy to standardize, teach and use in research studies. Dr. Beck, patient, plain-spoken and persuasive, was its most effective ambassador.\", \"In the first chapter of his classic 1967 book, \\u201cDepression: Causes and Treatment,\\u201d he observed: \\u201cThere is an astonishing contrast between the depressed person\\u2019s image of himself and the objective facts. A wealthy man moans that he doesn\\u2019t have the financial resources to feed his children. A widely acclaimed beauty begs for plastic surgery in the belief that she is ugly. An eminent physicist berates himself \\u2018for being stupid.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"He wrote or co-wrote 22 books in all, on technical psychiatric topics as well as love, anger and chronic pain, including three with his daughter Judith.\", \"In his last years Dr. Beck applied cognitive techniques to help largely forgotten groups of people, like destitute drug addicts and people with late-stage schizophrenia. \\u201cThese people have some capacity to do better, but they have all these defeatist attitudes and expectations; they assume they\\u2019re going to fail,\\u201d he said in an interview with The Times in 2009 in Bala Cynwyd.\", \"He was also advising a friend who had terminal cancer. \\u201cHe\\u2019s having mood problems, and who wouldn\\u2019t?\\u201d Dr. Beck said. \\u201cI\\u2019m having him spend 30 minutes every day, at the beginning of the day, to think about how important this day is \\u2014 that it may be the most important day of his life, or one of richest.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"59fd56583b3511ecbba3000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"59fd56583b3511ecbba3000017025a03"}},
