After a Maori blessing, Campion began to introduce everyone. \\u201cThis is Phil Burbank,\\u201d she said as Benedict Cumberbatch stepped forward. \\u201cBenedict is really nice and you\\u2019ll meet him at the end of the shoot.\\u201d\", \"Phil, the clever, bullying, angry character played by Cumberbatch, is the elder of two brothers who run a thriving cattle ranch, and he isn\\u2019t nice at all. He dominates and insults his quiet, mild-mannered sibling, George (Jesse Plemons), and his perpetually simmering hostility finds a soft target when George marries Rose (Kirsten Dunst), a local widow with an effete teenage son, Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee). Phil is an alpha-male cowboy, dark and dirty (literally). But slowly we begin to understand that Phil, who studied Greek and Latin at Yale, is also playing a role.\", \"\\u201cIn her dry way, with that introduction, Jane gave me permission to be Phil,\\u201d Cumberbatch said in a video interview from his home in England. With rather more exuberant hair than Phil and minus the character\\u2019s fearsome stare, he was relaxed and articulate as he discussed the role. \\u201cHe behaves abhorrently, but there is a deep well of pain there, this life not lived, an arrested development that informs the way he behaves. If we don\\u2019t understand the monsters in our world, what motivates this behavior, if we can\\u2019t look at someone beyond being a baddie or a goody, then we\\u2019re in trouble.\\u201d\", \"To play this complex, controlling monster, Cumberbatch focused on the role\\u2019s physicality as never before, learning to ride, working with animals, fully embodying Phil\\u2019s visceral dominance of his environment. A heady experience for Cumberbatch, it has already led to Oscar talk and some of the best reviews he\\u2019s ever received. \\u201cCumberbatch is astounding in the role, as the actor knots his default sarcasm into a lasso of constricted menace,\\u201d David Ehrlich of IndieWire wrote. \\u201cThe unforgettable performance that results \\u2014 a definitive career-best \\u2014 is at once both terrifying and terrified.\\u201d\", \"Campion, the first woman to win the top prize at Cannes, for \\u201cThe Piano\\u201d in 1993, adapted \\u201cThe Power of the Dog\\u201d from a 1967 novel by Thomas Savage. The movie, which will have a theatrical release on Nov. 17 and stream on Netflix beginning Dec. 1, is her first in a dozen years, and her first to feature a male protagonist. Campion said in a phone interview that she had long admired Cumberbatch\\u2019s ability to \\u201cdo something unexpected.\\u201d For Phil, you want \\u201cthe guts and performance capacity to create someone who is worth hating and fearing. He is possibly one of the most interesting characters in American literature.\\u201d\", \"The movie arrives just a few weeks after another Cumberbatch tour de force, \\u201cThe Electrical Life of Louis Wain,\\u201d directed by Will Sharpe (on Amazon Prime beginning Nov. 5). In that, he plays the emotionally fragile, socially awkward, brilliantly talented illustrator Louis Wain, who in the late 19th century became famous for his playful, anthropomorphic drawings of cats.\", \"Louis is the polar opposite of Phil, a man unable to fulfill the traditionally masculine roles of provider and authority in an era that requires him to take care of his mother and five unmarried sisters. He falls unsuitably in love and marries Emily (Claire Foy), his young sisters\\u2019 governess; when she becomes ill, he draws cats to cheer her up.\", \"\\u201cOver time, as Louis\\u2019s life takes a number of dramatic turns, his cat love deepens and his art changes, and so do both the movie and Cumberbatch\\u2019s layered performance, with its openness, tenderness and performative control,\\u201d Manohla Dargis wrote in a New York Times review.\", \"Sharpe said the actor was \\u201cunafraid to put himself in any scenario,\\u201d adding in a phone interview that there was \\u201csome overlap between Louis and Benedict; an overbusy diary, full of energy, full of ideas.\\u201d\", \"Cumberbatch said he had adored everything about Louis Wain. \\u201cI had a similar connection to him that I did to Alan Turing when I did \\u2018The Imitation Game\\u2019: they were both quiet characters in a very loud world,\\u201d he said, adding that he had been moved by Wain\\u2019s mental health issues, \\u201chow that loud, mechanicalized, industrialized era could snuff someone out who was a real hero to so many people across generations.\\u201d\", \"Cumberbatch, who shot to fame around a decade ago as a grumpy, brilliant, emotionally disconnected Sherlock Holmes in the BBC series \\u201cSherlock,\\u201d is no stranger to wildly idiosyncratic characters. He received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Turing; won a BAFTA award for the role of an abused, drug-addicted wealthy Englishman in the Showtime mini-series \\u201cPatrick Melrose\\u201d; has played Hamlet and Frankenstein onstage; and is currently Dr. Strange in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (he\\u2019s in the forthcoming \\u201cSpider-Man: No Way Home\\u201d).\", \"\\u201cI fit a lot of very boring brackets in my personal description,\\u201d said Cumberbatch, 45, who is married with children. \\u201cI am drawn to the otherness of these people, to the difference from my lived experience. I want to understand it from the inside, not go, \\u2018Oh I know what that feels like.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Cumberbatch\\u2019s parents are actors, and he recounted the experience of being backstage when very young, watching his mother, Wanda Ventham, step onstage \\u201cand stop being my mum.\\u201d He was fascinated, he said, \\u201cthat people were there in the darkness, listening to that storytelling.\\u201d\", \"He acted through high school, \\u201ctoyed with the idea of being a lawyer,\\u201d and studied drama at the University of Manchester, then acting at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. His first six months of professional life were jobless and \\u201ca little bit desperate,\\u201d he said, but he slowly began to get small parts in theater, television and film.\", \"By 2010, when the first series of \\u201cSherlock\\u201d was broadcast, Cumberbatch was a busy, established actor in Britain but hardly an international star. Then everything changed. \\u201cThe fame thing was very acute afterwards,\\u201d he said. \\u201cFor a while it\\u2019s what I was known for and I\\u2019m grateful for it. But did it overtake my life? Is that what I\\u2019m chiefly recognized for? I don\\u2019t think so anymore.\\u201d (Note to \\u201cSherlock\\u201d devotees: Cumberbatch didn\\u2019t rule out future appearances in the role. \\u201cWe never say never about doing it again.\\u201d)\", \"Foy, who previously worked with Cumberbatch on a small indie film, \\u201cWreckers,\\u201d before he was famous, said in a phone interview that Cumberbatch \\u201cis the epitome of an actor, very old-school in the sense he is eccentric and quirky and dives straight in. He has a passion for acting, for craft and process, that not all actors have.\\u201d\", \"For \\u201cPower of the Dog,\\u201d Campion recalled, \\u201cI told him, the problem is that you\\u2019re about as English as anyone can get. But we\\u2019re going to make you an American rancher in 1925.\\u201d\", \"Cumberbatch spent months preparing before the New Zealand shoot, which began in January 2020, was halted by a lockdown halfway through, and resumed three months later. He began with a look book that Campion had put together. \\u201cIt gave me a sense of the sensuality of the film, the erotic nature of certain aspects of the character, his masculinity tinged with the otherworldly look of a satyr,\\u201d he said.\", \"Campion asked him what he needed. \\u201cI said, I need whittling lessons, I need riding lessons, I need banjo lessons, I need dude camp,\\u201d he recounted.\", \"He spent several weeks on Montana ranches. \\u201cAn amazing way of life opened up for me,\\u201d he said. He added, \\u201cPretty much everything I do in the film, I learned to do.\\u201d He cataloged it: \\u201cbraiding rope, working with the cattle, castrating \\u2014 braiding rope while smoking a cigarette, incredibly difficult!\\u201d (He also learned the slow whistling with which Phil tortures Rose as she tries to practice the piano. \\u201cIt was my idea,\\u201d Cumberbatch said. \\u201cI thought it would be really nasty, so in control.\\u201d)\", \"Before the shoot the cast spent two weeks rehearsing in New Zealand. \\u201cI did things like not washing for a week, getting up at all hours to tend to the animals, muck out stables, put together every part of the saddle,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI needed it to be like second nature.\\u201d\", \"Campion also gave the cast exercises to do in character. \\u201cWe went on a \\u2018brother\\u2019 hike,\\u201d Jesse Plemons said, \\u201cfirst having discussions in character that Jane suggested, then creating our own history with one another.\\u201d In the film, the characters don\\u2019t talk to one another much, Plemons added. \\u201cThere was so much story to tell through so few words that the way they behaved around each other was really important; every action mattered.\\u201d\", \"Phil\\u2019s hard-bodied, striding, athletic physicality is as specific and pronounced as Louis Wain\\u2019s upright, jerky, head-scratching, drawing-with-two-hands presence. \\u201cWhat life experience has done to shape someone, how that plays on the body, is very important to me,\\u201d he said, adding that he had worked with choreographers on both films to hone those defining physical characteristics.\", \"Early on, Cumberbatch said, he and Campion decided that he would stay in character while on set \\u2014 even in their conversations between takes. \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t try to gaslight her, but I would fully be him. Luckily Jane seemed to like Phil quite a lot; they got on very well for the most part.\\u201d\", \"He added, \\u201cI have always held on to being able to switch on and off as an actor.\\u201d But because Phil\\u2019s surroundings, experience and era were so different from his own, \\u201cit was incredibly helpful for me to occupy that space for the entire workday\\u201d so as to feel \\u201cgrounded when you are in front of the camera.\\u201d\", \"Dunst, who described Rose as a vulnerable, kind character, unable to withstand Phil\\u2019s\", \"jealousy and resentment when she marries George, said in a phone interview that she and Cumberbatch decided not to talk to each other on set. \\u201cI think because the character is so far from his personality, that was cathartic for him, it gave him permission to be angry,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe had to find that hatred for Rose and I had to find my response to that.\\u201d On weekends, she added, they would go out for meals and \\u201chave a lovely, fun time and he would always apologize. It was very English!\\u201d\", \"What is extraordinary about the story, Cumberbatch said, \\u201cis that it still bears relevance. There are still angry, toxic masculine character traits writ large in world leaders of late, let alone other kinds of domestic abuse or abhorrent male behaviors.\\u201d It\\u2019s important, he added, that \\u201cwe are getting to a place where women are being heard. But we should also be looking at men; why are men like this?\\u201d\", \"The experience of working on \\u201cThe Power of the Dog,\\u201d was \\u201cintoxicating,\\u201d Cumberbatch added, showing a small shrine to the movie he had created on a shelf, with props, photographs and gifts from the crew. \\u201cI can\\u2019t tell you how rare it is to sit in your own audience and go, \\u2018gosh, that\\u2019s what I intended in a scene, in a performance, in an entire character arc.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"He gestured to the shrine. \\u201cI am looking forward to the next shelf being filled up; that\\u2019s where I want to go as an artist.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9d244bea3d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9d244bea3d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}},
