This time it is permanent, the social network said.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-01-03T13:03:16.000Z","content":"[\"Controversial Republican Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene's personal Twitter account has been suspended permanently for spreading COVID-19 misinformation, the social media network confirmed to CBS News on Sunday. She still has access to her official congressional account @RepMTG and she can tweet from it.\\u00a0\", \"A Twitter spokesperson told CBS News that \\\"we permanently suspended the account you referenced (@mtgreenee) for repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation policy. We've been clear that, per our strike system for this policy, we will permanently suspend accounts for repeated violations of the policy.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Greene responded on her Gettr account, calling Twitter \\\"an enemy to American and can't handle the truth. That's fine, I'll show America we don't need them and it's time to defeat our enemies.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Greene's personal account had more than 465,000 followers. This is not the first time it has been temporarily suspended.\\u00a0 In July, Greene received a 12-hour ban after the social media platform accused her of spreading COVID-19 misinformation. The congresswoman responded on Facebook, saying \\\"Free Speech is under attack.\\\"\", \"Before Greene was elected to Congress, she made a slew of social media posts embracing far-right conspiracy theories. Greene questioned the legitimacy of deadly school shootings, believing they were staged and whether a plane really hit the Pentagon on 9/11. She went on to harass Parkland shooting survivor David Hogg in public and never offered an apology.\", \"Last February, the House of Representatives decided to strip Greene of her committee assignments due to her past harmful remarks about violence against Democrats. The vote was 230-199, with 11 Republicans joining all Democrats. Committees are where bills are written, so removing her from any committees decreases her influence on legislation within Congress.\", \"Greene was suspended again in August after she claimed COVID-19 vaccines were \\\"failing\\\" and that they were ineffective at reducing the virus's spread.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"70a109866c9511ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"70a109866c9511ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
