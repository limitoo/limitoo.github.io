Kathy Hochul of New York said on Thursday that everyone who attended a recent anime convention in Manhattan should get tested for the coronavirus, after an individual who tested positive for the Omicron variant in Minnesota recently traveled to to the conference.\", \"Ms. Hochul said the individual, a Minnesota resident who was vaccinated and suffered mild symptoms, had attended the Anime NYC 2021 convention at the Javits Center in Midtown Manhattan. She urged people who attended Javits from Nov. 18 to Nov. 22 to get tested and said that health officials would be in contact with attendees. It was not immediately clear how many people attended the convention, but the event had 46,000 attendees the last time it was held in 2019.\", \"\\u201cWe do anticipate they\\u2019ll be more cases,\\u201d Ms. Hochul said. \\u201cThis is not cause for alarm; it was foreseen ever since it was first reported out of South Africa, that we knew it would come to New York State at some point.\\u201d\", \"Much remains unknown about Omicron, including whether it is more transmissible and capable of causing more serious illness. People had to be vaccinated with at least one dose and wear masks to attend the conference. Proof of at least one dose is required for many indoor activities citywide. New York State and New York City do not have universal indoor mask mandates.\", \"In a statement, Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city had activated its contact tracing program to track down people who attended the event at the Javits Center, adding that \\u201cwe should assume there is community spread of the variant in our city.\\u201d\", \"The Omicron variant still had not been identified in New York, Ms. Hochul said, adding that New Yorkers should continue to wear masks and get tested, while unveiling a new public messaging campaign to encourage people to get booster shots.\", \"Last week, Ms. Hochul declared a state of emergency to give the state more flexibility to respond to the rise in cases and staff shortages in health care facilities. Under an executive order that goes into effect on Friday, for example, hospitals that have less than 10 percent bed capacity will have to temporarily pause elective surgeries.\", \"Ms. Hochul\\u2019s made her remarks on Thursday during a coronavirus briefing in which she introduced Dr. Mary T. Bassett, the newly-appointed New York State health commissioner.\", \"Dr. Bassett steps into the role as parts of upstate New York grapple with a spike in coronavirus cases, while the state contends with the largely unknown Omicron variant during the cold winter months, when people are likelier to gather indoors and travel during the holidays.\", \"\\u201cThe fact that we have not detected it may mean that it\\u2019s still extraordinarily rare here, that it is the proverbial needle in the haystack,\\u201d Dr. Bassett said of the Omicron variant. \\u201cWe now have an exposure and we fully expect that it will be detected in the coming days.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Bassett, who ran New York City\\u2019s health department for four years until 2018, took the helm of an embattled Health Department that suffered from an exodus of health officials under former Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who repeatedly interfered in the department\\u2019s coronavirus response.\", \"Dr. Bassett replaced Dr. Howard A. Zucker, who announced his resignation in September following political pressure over his role in potentially helping obscure the coronavirus death toll in nursing homes under Mr. Cuomo. Appointed by Ms. Hochul, who replaced Mr. Cuomo after he resigned in August, Dr. Bassett faces the daunting task of restoring trust in the state\\u2019s public health apparatus among experts and New Yorkers alike.\", \"Dr. Bassett won acclaim when she was the city\\u2019s health commissioner for her role in navigating the Ebola scare in 2014, as well as an outbreak of Legionnaire\\u2019s disease and the threat of Zika. She most recently served as director of Harvard\\u2019s FXB Center for Health and Human Rights.\"]","href_hash":"287a5eb8539611ecbd3d811438073cbf"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"287a5eb8539611ecbd3d811438073cbf"}},
