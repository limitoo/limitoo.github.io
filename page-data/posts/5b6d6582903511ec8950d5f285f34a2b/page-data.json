The court's decision last month led the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration to withdraw its emergency standard setting the policy.\", \"The move by Adidas comes a month after Starbucks said it would no longer require its U.S. workers be inoculatetd against COVID-19. The Seattle coffee giant also pointed to the high court's ruling in explaining why it ended a\\u00a0two-week-old policy requiring workers to get vaccinated by February 9 or face weekly tests.\\u00a0\", \"Intel has paused its requirement that workers get vaccinated or face unpaid leave starting in April.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Due to court decisions last month, Intel currently is not subject to a vaccine mandate or weekly testing requirements for unvaccinated employees \\u2014 and it is not requiring either for its employees at the moment,\\\" a spokesperson for the chipmaker said in an email.\", \"The decision by companies to ease their COVID-19 rules comes amid a drop in infections around the U.S. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of cases has fallen from a peak of nearly 800,000 on average in mid-January to roughly 134,000.\", \"Although many businesses implemented COVID-19 protocols during the pandemic, fewer chose to require employees to get vaccinated. A handful of companies have stuck with vaccine mandates even without cover from the federal government,\\u00a0including Tyson Foods\\u00a0and\\u00a0United Airlines. Others are taking a harder line, with Nike firing at least one long-time worker for failing to let a third-party verify his vaccination status, according to CBS Austin.\", \"In Portland, Oregon, a Columbia Sportswear executive told a\\u00a0CBS affiliate the company was disappointed by the Supreme Court ruling, but that it remains committed to its vaccine mandate.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It certainly would have made it easier if we think that we're all in this together and working under the same rules,\\\" Richelle Luther, the company's chief human resources officer, said last month.\\u00a0\", \"Amazon and Walmart \\u2014 both of which have held off on imposing vaccine requirements \\u2014 in recent days said that fully vaccinated workers\\u00a0no longer have to wear facial coverings. Amazon also told workers that only those fully vaccinated by March 18 would get paid leave due to COVID-19, and Walmart's emergency leave policy allowing for more paid sick time for coronavirus-related absences expires at the end of March.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"5b6d6582903511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5b6d6582903511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
