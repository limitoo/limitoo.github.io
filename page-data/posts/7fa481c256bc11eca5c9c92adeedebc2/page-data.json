Our vet on the scene got there immediately and he was already expired.\\u201d\", \"Neither the colt\\u2019s trainer Bob Baffert nor Baffert\\u2019s lawyer, W. Craig Robertson III, responded to requests for comment. Medina Spirit\\u2019s owner, Amr Zedan of Saudi Arabia, was not immediately available for comment.\", \"Zedan\\u2019s attorney, Clark Brewster, said he had spoken with both his client and Baffert Monday morning. Both said Medina Spirit was training well after an impressive second place finish in the Breeders\\u2019 Cup Classic in November and was preparing for another race in the coming weeks, Brewster said.\", \"\\u201cThey are wracked with grief. It\\u2019s truly tragic,\\u201d Brewster said. \\u201cHe was training great and moving easily and then Bob said when he finished up he just collapsed.\\u201d\", \"At 12-to-1 odds, Medina Spirit was a surprising winner of the Derby, America\\u2019s most famous race. The colt was sold as a yearling for only $1,000 and was a bargain for Zedan, who paid just $35,000 for him. Medina Spirit\\u2019s victory was the seventh for Baffert trained horses in America\\u2019s greatest race, a record.\", \"A week after winning the Derby, however, Baffert announced that a post-race test found the drug betamethasone, a corticosteroid injected into joints to reduce pain and swelling, in Medina Spirit. At the time, Baffert strongly denied that he or anyone else on his team had administered the drug to Medina Spirit.\", \"He gave a series of television and radio interviews in the following days offering various theories about how the colt had tested positive. He criticized Churchill Downs\\u2019s suspension of him as \\u201charsh\\u201d and cited \\u201ccancel culture\\u201d for the controversy.\", \"Baffert, however, soon reversed himself and conceded that Medina Spirit had a rash on his hind end. At a veterinarian\\u2019s recommendation, the ointment was applied daily to Medina Spirit\\u2019s hind end to heal the dermatitis contained the substance.\"]","href_hash":"7fa481c256bc11eca5c9c92adeedebc2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7fa481c256bc11eca5c9c92adeedebc2"}},
