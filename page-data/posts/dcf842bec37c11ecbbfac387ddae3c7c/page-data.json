Bill Clark: In any homicide investigation you obviously want to bring closure to the family\\u2026 So not only do you want to make that phone call saying, \\\"We got the guy that did this to your loved one,\\\" but in this case, we wanted to say to 'em, look, \\\"we found Johnny.\\\" \", \"Detective Clark hoped Twitchell would provide the final chapter.\", \"DET. BILL CLARK [interviewing Twitchell]: I'm gonna go get the car ready.\\u00a0 We're gonna take a drive.\", \"Troy Roberts: You guys were driving around and there was a camera trained on him in the back of the police car. Tell me about that.\", \"Det. Bill Clark:\\u00a0 When you \\u2014 you read all the experts' books about these type of individuals is they tend to like the media attention. \\u2026 So, we thought, \\\"Well, maybe if we drive him around and we'll put a camera on him, maybe he'll just \\u2014 we'll just take him to places,\\\" 'cause we had no idea where \\u2014 where Johnny remains were at that time.\", \"DET.

Bill Clark [with Roberts at sewer]: And he had marked an \\\"X,\\\" \\\"X\\\" marks the spot, and took us right to this sewer cover here. \\u2026 We could see what looked like pieces of human torso down there.\", \"In March of 2011, Mark Twitchell went on trial for the murder of Johnny Altinger. Prosecutors called Gilles Tetreault to testify, and to prove that what Twitchell described in \\\"SK Confessions\\\" was not a work of fiction but an account of what had actually happened.\", \"Gilles Tetreault: I wasn't really afraid of him at that time. \\u2026 I knew he couldn't hurt me anymore.\", \"The only witness the defense called was Mark Twitchell and he had one unbelievable tale to tell. Steve Lillibeun, a college professor and an investigative journalist, was covering the trial for the Edmonton Journal and went on to write a book, \\\"The Devil's Cinema,\\\" about the case.\", \"Steve Lillibeun: Mark Twitchell testified \\u2026 that this was all a big misunderstanding \\u2026 he had killed Johnny in self-defense \\u2026\", \"Twitchell claimed that Altinger's death was nothing more than a publicity stunt gone horribly awry. He said he intended to let both men go so they would create a buzz for his film by telling people that this had actually happened to them. But he claimed Altinger became enraged at being tricked, and he accidentally killed him in self-defense.\", \"Steve Lillibeun: He blames Johnny, saying it was Johnny's reaction to his attempt at this promotion is what happened.\", \"In the end, the jury took just five hours to find Mark Twitchell guilty.\\u00a0 He was sentenced to 25 years to life. But for Lillibeun, there were still so many questions.\", \"Steve Lillibeun: So, the motive is the mystery, the why did he do this. \\u2026 What's Mark Twitchell's psyche? What led to this happening? \", \"Questions Lillibeun hoped might be answered when he got a call out of the blue from Mark Twitchell himself.\", \"Steve Lillibeun: He just said straight out, \\\"If you're gonna be writing a book about me, you might as well come straight to the source.\\\" \", \"Steve Lillibeun: The first time I met him, he actually had me laughing. \\u2026 He's very charismatic.\", \"Mark Twitchell was nothing like author Steve Lillibeun expected.\", \"Steve Lillibeun: He has very much that salesman slick behavior, he knows how to put it on to get people to like him.\", \"Twitchell began writing to Lillibeun before he was even convicted in 2011.\\u00a0 Over the course of almost three years, they exchanged dozens of letters.\", \"Steve Lillibeun: I learned really quickly that he preferred to talk through writing. \", \"Troy Roberts: These weren't ramblings of a crazy man. There was actually some substance in these letters? \", \"Steve Lillibeun: Yes absolutely. So, he's not crazy. He is lucid.\", \"At first, Lillibeun didn't want to push Twitchell away with too many probing questions about his crimes.\", \"Steve Lillibeun: I asked him a lotta softball questions just about who he was, his family, his upbringing -- all that kinda background detail.\", \"Steve Lillibeun: He was newly married and a new father. So he was, you know, just a typical local guy who had dreams of making it big in Hollywood and really no red flags. No warning signs that something like this was on the horizon. \", \"In letters, Twitchell clung to his defense that he had no choice but to kill Johnny Altinger and then dismember him. \", \"Steve Lillibeun [reading letter]: He writes, \\\"I killed Johnny Altinger in a horrific accident of self-defense. After cursorily shoving aside my human sensibilities, I dealt with his remains in a disrespectful manner that traumatized me forever.\\\"\", \"Steve Lillibeun: ... still is adamant ... that this was not a planned and deliberate murder \\u2026 and to be frank, he is wrong.\", \"Lillibeun points to \\\"SK Confessions,\\\" where Twitchell describes how he turned that garage into a kill room, set up a makeshift autopsy table, had plastic sheeting, and a processing kit similar to the one Dexter Morgan used.\\u00a0 \", \"Steve Lillibeun: Mark Twitchell wrote to me quite extensively about his interest in \\\"Dexter.\\\" \", \"\\\"Dexter\\\" on his mind, Twitchell drew a portrait of Michael C. Hall \\u2013 the actor who plays him.\\u00a0 And to Lillibeun's surprise, even behind bars Twitchell was able to feed his obsessions.\", \"Steve Lillibeun: Mark Twitchell had actually been granted access to finish watching the series while he was incarcerated.\", \"In 2012, Michael C. Hall was asked about Mark Twitchell on a Canadian radio program.\", \"MICHAEL C. HALL (audio): it is horrifying to entertain the notion that something you did inspired that.\", \"Twitchell's response to Hall's comments was to downplay his fascination with the \\\"Dexter\\\" character.\", \"Steve Lillibeun [reading letter]: He wrote to me \\\"As you are aware, Dexter has almost nothing to do with my case.\\\"\", \"Throughout their correspondence, Lillibeun continued to grapple with what drove Twitchell and then Twitchell told him:\\u00a0\", \"Steve Lillibeun [reading letter]: \\\"There is no key. No root cause \\u2026there is no school bully or impressionably gory movies \\u2026 or Showtime television series to point the finger at.

He is killing very innocent, good people living productive lives. \", \"Julia Cowley: And while he's technically not a serial killer \\u2026 he was headed in that direction if they hadn't have caught him. \", \"Cowley believes Twitchell took pleasure in planning and executing his crimes as if they were romantic trysts.\", \"Julia\\u00a0Cowley: I think the primary motivation was sexual.\\u00a0\", \"Troy Roberts: Sexual?\\u00a0 \", \"Julia Cowley: Yes. \\u2026 He is targeting men that perhaps he would be interested in having a date with. \\u2026 It's a combination of a sexual motive and thrill killing.\", \"Julia Cowley: He is pretending to be a woman ... He \\u2026 writes extensively about \\u2026 what he's going to wear, the weapon that he chooses. He sort of describes it in seductive language. \\\"I wanted the weapon used for the deed itself to be simple, elegant and beautiful.\\\"\", \"And in a strange twist, Twitchell's been able to feed that obsession too. In 2017, he was allowed to join an online dating website for inmates.\", \"Steve Lillibeun: Which, you know, I find quite surprising considering that the way he ended up in prison \\u2026 I believe it's been taken down since then.\", \"The man who was tricked into that very bad date in Twitchell's garage, Gilles Tetreault, continues to be haunted by the experience. \\\"48 Hours\\\" caught up with him recently.\", \"Gilles Tetreault: I still think about the painted-up hockey mask.
