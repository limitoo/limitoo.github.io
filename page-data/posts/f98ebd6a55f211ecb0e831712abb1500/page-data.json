He later briefly ran the playersâ€™ union.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-05T17:45:11.000Z","content":"[\"Ken Moffett, a longtime federal mediator who spent 20 years trying to find solutions to nettlesome labor disputes and then had a brief, unhappy tenure as head of the baseball players\\u2019 union, died on Nov. 19 at his home in Alexandria, Va. He was 90.\", \"His death was confirmed by his son Ken Jr., the director of negotiations at the National Treasury Employees Union.\", \"In 1981, Mr. Moffett was the deputy director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, and faced a summer packed with labor battles involving air traffic controllers, baseball players and postal workers.\", \"\\u201cAs he shuttled from one bargaining table to the other trying to handle these three national crises, he was under more pressure than any director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service since the agency had been founded in 1947,\\u201d Joseph McCartin, author of \\u201cCollision Course: Ronald Reagan, the Air Traffic Controllers, and the Strike that Changed America\\u201d (2011), wrote in an email.\", \"During the 1981 baseball season, the Major League Baseball Players Association went on strike against team owners over free agent compensation; at one point the players accepted a proposal, with reservations, by Mr. Moffett to end the strike, but the owners spurned it. The strike ended after 50 days at the end of July, partly because of Mr. Moffett\\u2019s mediation, about a week after he had helped the United States Postal Service and union workers agree on a new contract.\", \"Despite the agreement, Mr. Moffett recalled the mutual disdain between the players and owners (which is once again being reflected in the owners\\u2019 lockout of players that began this month).\", \"\\u201cBoth sides were very vitriolic toward one another,\\u201d he told The Los Angeles Times in 1985. \\u201cI brought the secretary of labor\\u201d \\u2014 Raymond Donovan \\u2014 \\u201cin on the fourth day to show them I was serious. It showed them that the secretary of labor and the president were interested in ending the strike.\\u201d\", \"But the dispute between the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization and the Federal Aviation Administration proved catastrophic for the union, despite Mr. Moffett\\u2019s intervention. At one point, he helped broker an agreement \\u2014 in talks with Drew Lewis, the transportation secretary, and others \\u2014 that addressed some of the controllers\\u2019 demands.\", \"But the union\\u2019s membership rejected the agreement, and the controllers went on strike that August. When more than 11,000 controllers did not return to their jobs after 48 hours, President Ronald Reagan fired them, crushing the union, which was soon decertified by the federal government.\", \"Mr. Moffett, who had dealt with the union since 1970, was not surprised by its defiance of Reagan.\", \"\\u201cThey thought that the government and the country could not exist without them acting,\\u201d Mr. Moffett said when Professor McCartin, who teaches history at Georgetown University, interviewed him for his book in 2001. \\u201cThere are some people that are just not replaceable, per se, and they felt they were these guys.\\u201d\", \"Kenneth Elwood Moffett was born on Sept. 11, 1931, in Lykens, Pa., north of Harrisburg. His father, Elwood, was a coal miner who rose to the presidency of District 50, a union of workers in fields related to coal mining that was part of the United Mine Workers and later the United Steelworkers of America. His mother, Hannah (Ely) Moffett, was a homemaker.\", \"Unionism was ingrained in the Moffett family. Ken\\u2019s great-great-grandfather was part of the Molly Maguires, a secret society of Irish American coal miners that battled mine owners in the 19th century. His grandfather, who was active in the U.M.W., died of black lung disease. And his father took him to labor meetings and to factories, where Ken handed out pamphlets to unorganized workers.\", \"After graduating from the University of Maryland with a bachelor\\u2019s degree in physical education in 1958, Mr. Moffett worked as an organizer for District 50 in Baltimore and Richmond, Va. In 1961, he left for the federal mediation service as an intern. His job involved research; he later moved into mediating disputes in Cleveland for five years, then worked in Washington as a troubleshooter at the agency.\", \"\\u201cI get along with people pretty well,\\u201d he told The Washington Post in late 1981, after his busy summer. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t have someone doing this who\\u2019s acerbic.\\u201d He added, \\u201cI know all the catchwords and the key jargon which makes people say, \\u2018Hmm, he is being sympathetic.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"He became the service\\u2019s director of mediation services in 1972, deputy director in 1977 and acting director four years later.\", \"Even with his growing administrative responsibilities, he remained active in mediating disputes, like the pressmen\\u2019s strike at The Washington Post in 1975 and the newspaper strike in New York City in 1978 that shuttered The New York Times and The Daily News for nearly three months, and The New York Post for 56 days.\", \"In 1982, President Reagan appointed Mr. Moffett the director of the service, but replaced him after several months with Kay McMurray.\", \"Later that year, Mr. Moffett was unanimously elected executive director of the baseball players\\u2019 union, succeeding Marvin Miller, its transformative leader. But he was fired after 11 months on the job. He clashed with Mr. Miller, who had stayed on as a consultant, and he suggested that he had been fired for negotiating a drug-testing policy and for being too conciliatory to owners.\", \"\\u201cI was trying to build a bridge to management,\\u201d Mr. Moffett told The Washington Post in 1984. \\u201cHowever, the union is determined to be confrontational on every issue. They\\u2019re still back on a 1930s tack.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Miller responded that Mr. Moffett \\u201ccomes from a background as a mediator, where any settlement is seen as a victory. No advocate can look at it that way.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Moffett moved on to another union, the National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians. He was named assistant to the union\\u2019s president in 1985 and remained through its merger nine years later with the Communications Workers of America. In the three years before his retirement in 2003, he was the C.W.A.\\u2019s human resources director. He continued to work as an independent arbitrator.\", \"In addition to his son Kenneth Jr., Mr. Moffett is survived by his wife, Mary (Taddeo) Moffett; another son, John; a daughter, Laura Tornell; his brothers, Jack and A. Robert; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren. His marriage to Barbara Wilcox ended in divorce, as did three subsequent marriages.\", \"Mr. Moffett\\u2019s union background and his experience in mediating disputes gave him a healthy respect for collective bargaining, Professor McCartin said. Mr. Moffett\\u2019s belief in the process, he added, fueled his stature as \\u201cone of the most skilled and dedicated mediators to have emerged in U.S. labor relations in the postwar era.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f98ebd6a55f211ecb0e831712abb1500"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f98ebd6a55f211ecb0e831712abb1500"}},
