The jurors must sort through a matrix of interlocking charges and different forms of culpability that can depend on one another. Here are some of the complications.\", \"The indictment charges the three defendants \\u2014 Gregory McMichael, Travis McMichael and William Bryan \\u2014 both individually and as \\u201cparties concerned in the commission of a crime.\\u201d Under the law, if the jury finds that one of the men committed a felony, it can convict them all of that crime, on the basis that they were acting together.\", \"This issue is especially important for Mr. Bryan, whose lawyer has tried to distance him from the other two defendants, arguing that Mr. Bryan was just a witness to events and had no hand in actually harming Ahmaud Arbery.\", \"To convict on the top charge, malice murder, the jury would have to find that the men had a deliberate intention to kill, without considerable provocation. But the other murder charges in the indictment do not depend on whether the three men meant to kill Mr. Arbery.\", \"Defense lawyers have argued that the men were attempting to make a citizen\\u2019s arrest, and killed Mr. Arbery in self-defense. The prosecution has argued that they had no justification for a citizen\\u2019s arrest and could not claim self-defense because they instigated the confrontation.\", \"The men are each accused of four other serious felonies besides murder. But each of those charges could also lead to a murder conviction.\", \"Under Georgia law, causing a person\\u2019s death in the course of committing another felony is murder, \\u201cirrespective of malice\\u201d \\u2014 in other words, regardless of whether the death was intentional or accidental.\", \"So if the jurors find the men guilty of any of these crimes \\u2026\", \"\\u2026 and then find that Mr. Arbery\\u2019s death was caused along the way, they could convict the men of felony murder as well, without having to find that they intended or tried to kill him.\", \"The judge said in his instructions to the jury that on one count in the indictment \\u2014 aggravated assault involving the pickup trucks \\u2014 they could consider whether one of the defendants, Mr. Bryan, was instead guilty of a reduced charge of simple assault, reckless conduct or reckless driving.\", \"Those are misdemeanors in Georgia, not felonies, so a conviction on one of the reduced charges would not expose Mr. Bryan to a felony murder charge in connection with that count.\"]","href_hash":"eddf86ee4c8211ec8c95a3d4ab45c753"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eddf86ee4c8211ec8c95a3d4ab45c753"}},
