Two other boys - one of 14, the other aged eight - were wounded in the attack. \", \"Over the following weekend three more people were murdered in Marseille, also in turf wars over drugs.

Some start taking drugs themselves. With police raids getting more frequent, good new sales-points are hard to find.\", \"\\\"Young and in debt, they want to make big sales, so they push out further from their home turf.
