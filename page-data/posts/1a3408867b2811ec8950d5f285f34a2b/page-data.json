These rules were previously set out in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a Cold War-era pact that the US scrapped in 2019, after accusing Russia of violating the deal.\", \"Blinken also urged Russia to stop what he called its aggression towards Ukraine, saying the troop build-up gave it the ability to attack Ukraine from the south, east and north.\", \"He said the US knew from experience that Moscow, which annexed Ukraine's Crimea region back in 2014, also had an \\\"extensive playbook\\\" of non-military ways of furthering its interests, including cyber attacks.\", \"He confirmed the US would continue deliveries of \\\"security assistance\\\" to Ukraine in the coming weeks. America sent anti-tank guided missile systems to Ukraine last year, as well as small arms and ammunition.\", \"Blinken said the talks had also touched on Iran and negotiations over its nuclear capabilities, which he called an example of how the US and Russia can work together on security issues.\", \"For his part, Lavrov described the talks as open and useful but he accused NATO of working against Russia. He reiterated Moscow's position that it had \\\"never threatened the Ukrainian people\\\" and had no plans to attack Ukraine.\", \"He also accused the Ukrainian government of using \\\"state terrorism\\\" against the rebels in the east and \\\"sabotaging\\\" the Minsk peace agreements on the conflict there.\", \"Russia's foreign minister said the US would send \\\"written responses\\\" to all of Russia's proposals next week but Blinken only said America hoped to share its \\\"concerns and ideas in more detail in writing next week\\\".\", \"The talks between the two diplomats came just a day after Russia unveiled plans for naval drills involving more than 140 warships and more than 60 aircraft, seen as a show of strength.\", \"Also on Thursday, the US said Russian intelligence officers had been recruiting current and former Ukrainian government officials to step in as a provisional government and co-operate with an occupying Russian force in the event of an invasion.\", \"The US treasury department imposed sanctions on two current Ukrainian members of parliament and two former government officials accused of being part of the plot.\", \"Blinken arrived in Geneva after a trip to Kyiv to show support for Ukraine, and talks with Britain, France and Germany in Berlin.\", \"Several European nations have now moved to bolster NATO's military deployment in eastern Europe. Spain is sending warships to join NATO naval forces in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, and Denmark also said it would send a frigate to the Baltic Sea.\", \"French President Emmanuel Macron has offered to send troops to Romania.\", \"Earlier this week, Britain announced it was supplying Ukraine with extra troops for training and defensive weapons.\", \"In a speech on Friday, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss called on Putin to \\\"desist and step back from Ukraine before he makes a massive strategic mistake\\\" that would lead to terrible loss of life.\", \"President Biden had triggered questions about the consistency of the US line on Ukraine on Wednesday, when he bleakly predicted that Russia would \\\"move in\\\" on Ukraine, but appeared to suggest a \\\"minor incursion\\\" could attract a weaker response from the US and its allies.\", \"The message drew a rebuke from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who tweeted: \\\"There are no minor incursions.
