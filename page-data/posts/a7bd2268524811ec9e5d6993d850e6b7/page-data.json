But whether it honors or encourages risk is debated in the sport.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-01T01:48:17.000Z","content":"[\"High on Lunag Ri in Nepal, the Austrian climber David Lama started worrying that he might lose his toes. The cold on the 22,621-foot mountain was as bad as anything he had ever experienced.\", \"Lama, attempting to scale it alone in 2018, could have ended up dead if he became pinned down in a storm with severe frostbite or was injured in a fall. A rescue would be nearly impossible.\", \"Lama\\u2019s digits never froze entirely, and he continued to the top of the mountain. The image of him silhouetted on the pulpit-like summit is the kind that climbers dream about. He said after the ascent that he had pushed near his risk-tolerance limit. For his climb, Lama won a Piolet d\\u2019Or \\u2014 the Golden Ice Axe \\u2014 Alpinism\\u2019s biggest prize.\", \"But Lama wasn\\u2019t present to accept the award at the Piolets d\\u2019Or ceremony in Ladek-Zdroj, Poland, in September 2019.\", \"He had died five months earlier in an avalanche, while attempting to climb a new route on the dangerous Howse Peak in the Canadian Rockies. His two partners, the American Jess Roskelley and the Austrian Hansjorg Auer, also died in the accident. Auer, too, was being honored with a Piolet d\\u2019Or in Poland, for a boundary-pushing solo climb of Pakistan\\u2019s Lupghar Sar West (23,481 feet).\", \"The dissonance between their deaths and the celebration of their risky solo ascents raised an uncomfortable question about the Piolets d\\u2019Or: Is choosing winners \\u2014 and therefore losers \\u2014 in mountaineering a bad idea? Elite alpine climbing already feels perilous; its practitioners\\u2019 dying is a matter of course. But does handing out awards reinforce an unhealthy culture of risk in what is already a potentially deadly pursuit?\", \"Giving the awards to Lama and Auer was like \\u201chaving a drinking party for somebody that died of liver disease,\\u201d said Rolando Garibotti, 50, an Argentine American alpine climber for over 30 years, during a phone call from Innsbruck, Austria. Garibotti is one of several significant climbers who wrestle with the implications of giving out prizes for climbs.\", \"\\u201cThere are plenty of alpine climbs where people walked away only barely with their skin,\\u201d Garibotti said. \\u201cAnd none of those people and climbs, in my mind, should qualify for the Piolet d\\u2019Or. If we want to create a culture in which not so many of the top guys end up dying, we need to make some changes.\\u201d\", \"Garibotti\\u2019s comment about top alpinists' dying is not hyperbole: Since 2008, at least seven Piolet d\\u2019Or winners, including the Swiss climber Ueli Steck, have gone on to die in the mountains.\", \"The 2021 Piolets d\\u2019Or, the ceremony\\u2019s 30th anniversary, took place this weekend, in Brian\\u00e7on, a center of alpine climbing in France. The event featured glittering trophies, acceptance speeches and standing ovations. The honored ascents this year had greater margins of safety than Lama\\u2019s or Auer\\u2019s. But the specter remained.\", \"Christian Trommsdorff, the organizer of the Piolets d\\u2019Or and himself an alpinist, said in a phone call from Greece, \\u201cRisk is not a factor in the selection process\\u201d of winners, meaning that climbs judged to have been too dangerous are not considered. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s part of the game,\\u201d he said, referring to the intrinsic risks in alpinism. \", \"The Piolets d\\u2019Or were founded in 1992 in France as a collaboration between Montagnes magazine and the Group de Haute Montagne, or High Mountain Group, of which Trommsdorff is president. \", \"Risk aside, there has been debate over the years on how to judge climbs, which have a subjective quality as alpine climbers routinely debate \\u201cstyle,\\u201d or how one gets to the summit.\", \" \", \"Things came to a head in 2007, when the Slovene alpinist Marko Prezelj refused to accept the Piolet d\\u2019Or. Later that year, he wrote an article in the annual American Alpine Journal, arguing that the awards foster an environment in which climbers are \\u201cencouraged to overstretch their capacity, to make use of performance-boosting substances, and to take inconsiderate risks.\\u201d\", \"So in 2009, the Piolets d\\u2019Or introduced a new format, honoring several climbs, all announced months before the ceremony. This satisfied many of the most vocal opponents in the \\u201cstyle\\u201d camp, but for others, like Garibotti, it failed to redress the fundamental problems surrounding risk.\", \"Garibotti knows the danger firsthand. By his tally, more than 30 people he has roped up with have later died climbing. The Piolets d\\u2019Or twice tried to nominate Garibotti for the award, once in 2006, for a new route on Cerro Torre, in Patagonia, and once in 2009, for the first traverse of the entire Cerro Torre massif. Twice he refused.\", \"Most shocking was whom the jury decided to honor in 1998: a Russian team that made the first ascent of the west face of the Himalayan peak Makalu in 1997. Two of the climbers on the expedition died in the process. The organizers introduced a new criterion after backlash that year, requiring, according to Trommsdorff, \\u201cthat you have to come back in one piece.\\u201d\", \"The problem, in Garibotti\\u2019s opinion, isn\\u2019t that the awards encourage climbers to take more risk, but that in awarding risky climbs, they validate risky behavior. \\u201cIf you have representation of climbs that are reckless, there are going to be more reckless climbs,\\u201d he said. \", \"After winning a Piolet d\\u2019Or in 2019 with his Slovene teammates Ales Cesen and Luka Strazar, the British climber Tom Livingstone wrote in an essay on his website that the award \\u201cplays on my human ego\\u201d in worrisome ways.\", \"\\u201cI already have a devil on my shoulder at the end of a run-out\\u201d \\u2014 a section of sparsely protected climbing that can result in dangerous falls \\u2014 \\u201cwho whispers, \\u2018uh oh, you\\u2019re gonna take a big one!\\u2019\\u201d Livingstone wrote. \\u201cI don\\u2019t want another offering me a golden trophy.\\u201d He accepted the award only because his teammates wanted to.\", \"Of course, for many climbers, danger is a big part of the sport\\u2019s appeal. \", \"\\u201cWe have to recognize that in traditional mountaineering, death is a possibility,\\u201d said Reinhold Messner, 77, one of the most lauded alpinists of the last century. \\u201cIf it\\u2019s not a possibility, it\\u2019s not mountaineering. The art of surviving is just that. It\\u2019s an art.\\u201d\", \"Though Messner accepted the lifetime achievement Piolet d\\u2019Or in 2010, an award created a year earlier, he too dismisses climbing prizes as reductive. In 1988, he declined an honorary Olympic medal for becoming the first person to summit the world\\u2019s 14 8,000-meter (26,247 feet) peaks.\", \"\\u201cI was always against the idea that traditional climbing is a competition,\\u201d Messner said. \\u201cGenerally I am not for medals at all. The lifetime award \\u2014 it\\u2019s about respect.\\u201d\", \"Despite the detractors, many leading climbers are in favor of the Piolets d\\u2019Or.\", \"Symon Welfringer, a 27-year-old Frenchman and one of this year\\u2019s Piolets d\\u2019Or recipients for his first ascent of the south face of Pakistan\\u2019s Sani Pakkush (22,805.1 feet) with his countryman Pierrick Fine, said the award \\u201cwas one of my main goals in starting to go on expeditions\\u201d to the Greater Ranges.\", \"\\u201cIn alpinism we don\\u2019t have that much recognition,\\u201d Welfringer explained. \\u201cNowadays you have social media, but it can be quite hard to make people understand how difficult and committing it is to open a new line.\\u201d\", \"Messner agrees that recognition helps nonclimbers understand the accomplishments of the best climbers and functions as a check on \\u201ccharlatan climbers who only appear like great adventurers\\u201d in Instagram pictures.\", \"Uisdean Hawthorn, a 28-year-old Scottish climber, is another recipient of a Piolet d\\u2019Or this year with his partner, Ethan Berman, for their new route on Mount Robson\\u2019s Emperor Face, in Canada. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s a good thing,\\u201d Hawthorn said. \\u201cThis ceremony brings climbers together to have a discussion. So I think anything that kind of does that is positive.\\u201d\", \"Hawthorn doubts most alpinists see the Piolet d\\u2019Or as a motivator, as Welfringer did in his climbing. He compared climbers to scientists doing years of research in an esoteric field: \\u201cThey\\u2019re not like, \\u2018If I do this, I\\u2019ll get a Nobel Prize,\\u2019\\u201d Hawthorn said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re just really into that weird niche thing, and they like it.\\u201d\", \"Trommsdorff agrees. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not pushing people to take risks \\u2014 you don\\u2019t need the Piolets d\\u2019Or to do that,\\u201d he said. And, Trommsdorff said, the Piolets d\\u2019Or specifically removed mention of winners and losers in its revamped charter in 2009.\", \"Many, like Hawthorn, appreciate this reframing. \\u201cYou could negatively look at it as still an excuse to award the best climb in alpinism, but I don\\u2019t really see it as that. It\\u2019s more of a celebration of alpinism. If it wasn\\u2019t a peer-judged thing, it would be completely different.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a7bd2268524811ec9e5d6993d850e6b7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a7bd2268524811ec9e5d6993d850e6b7"}},
