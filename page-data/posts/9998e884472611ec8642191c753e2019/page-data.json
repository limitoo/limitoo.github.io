The song, which was first released on the original album in 2012, was named the best song of the 2010s by Rolling Stone.\", \"Not only was there an addition of almost 5 minutes of music, the singer also released a short film to correspond with the longer version starring actors Dylan O'Brien and Sadie Sink.

A Warwick character has even become a mainstay on Saturday Night Live\\u2014with the real Warwick making a special appearance on the show earlier this month.\", \"On Monday, Warwick tweeted, \\\"If that young man has Taylor's scarf he should return it.\\\"\", \"It was followed by another tweet that read: \\\"It does not belong to you.
