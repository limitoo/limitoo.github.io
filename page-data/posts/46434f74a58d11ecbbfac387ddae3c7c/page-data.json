David McCormick, one of his main GOP rivals, has been pressing Oz on the issue.\", \"\\\"My dual citizenship has become a distraction in this campaign,\\\" Oz said in a statement. \\\"I maintained it to care for my ailing mother, but after several weeks of discussions with my family, I'm committing that before I am sworn in as the next U.S. Senator for Pennsylvania I will only be a U.S. citizen.\\\"\", \"Before Oz issued his statement, McCormick's campaign held a press call with Alaska Republican Senator Dan Sullivan, who suggested Oz may not have full access to intelligence if he did not renounce his Turkish citizenship.\", \"\\\"To me, it's just inconceivable that you would make a decision that somehow would limit your access to this kind of intelligence that you need to do the job,\\\" Sullivan told reporters. \\\"My view is you need full access to all the intel that the different intelligence agencies provide us senators.\\\"\", \"When pressed why Turkish citizenship would be an issue, given that the country is a NATO ally, Sullivan said the country isn't part of a group of nations that the U.S. shares more closely held intelligence with.

He has lied about his position on abortion, the 2nd Amendment, immigration, masks, and Fauci to name a few. Renounce your Turkish citizenship now. We won't be fooled again.\\\"\", \"Oz and McCormick have launched several attacks against each other in a bitter GOP primary.
