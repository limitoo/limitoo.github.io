Check with your lender If you're unsure about your school's eligibility status.\", \"While federal student loans don't require a credit check, private student loans typically require a positive payment history and a minimum credit score in the upper 600s or higher. You might also have to meet the minimum income requirement to ensure you can repay your student loan.\", \"\\\"Before tackling a private student loan application, bear in mind that these loans are offered by banks, not the federal government,\\\" says Joe Camberato, CEO at National Business Capital. \\\"Make time to research the lender's reputation before sharing your personal information.\\\"\", \"If your credit history is minimal or you have below-average credit, you might need a cosigner to qualify for a private student loan.
