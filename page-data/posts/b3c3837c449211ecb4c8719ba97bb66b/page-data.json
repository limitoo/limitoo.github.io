Sometimes it would be just one fish chafing against one shark, but at times shoals of more than 100 fish would be bumping against several sharks.\", \"The researchers recorded 12 fin fish \\u2014 any fish with fins, such as salmon, tuna or sharks, as opposed to shellfish or other sea creatures \\u2014 chafing against eight different species of shark, including great whites.\", \"One case that stood out to the research team was recorded by an aerial drone in Plettenberg Bay, South Africa and showed 25 occurrences of a leervis fish going out of its way to rub against an enormous great white shark.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931710/pacific-jack-mackerel.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">School of Pacific jack mackerel chaffing against a white shark off Guadalupe Island, Mexico. </div>\", \"The researchers also found that silky sharks (a species that does not have rough skin) chafe against whale sharks.\", \"\\\"While we don't exactly know why it's happening, we have a few theories. Shark skin is covered in small tooth-like scales called dermal denticles, which provide a rough sandpaper surface for the chafing fish,\\\" said Neil Hammerschlag, UM Rosenstiel School research associate professor and study co-author.\", \"\\\"We suspect that chafing against shark skin might play a vital role in the removal of parasites or other skin irritants, thus improving fish health and fitness.\\\"\", \"The researchers hope that future studies will be able to further develop the theory of why fish seek out and rub against their natural predators.\"]","href_hash":"b3c3837c449211ecb4c8719ba97bb66b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b3c3837c449211ecb4c8719ba97bb66b"}},
