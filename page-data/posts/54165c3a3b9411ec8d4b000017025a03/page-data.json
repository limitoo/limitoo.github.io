Democrats are heavily favored in each, as they are in most of the other contests for City Council, borough presidents and the Manhattan district attorney.\", \"Eric Adams is likely to be elected as the city\\u2019s second Black mayor, and Alvin Bragg is likely to be the first Black district attorney of Manhattan. Mr. Adams can expect to be confronted with numerous challenges as the city looks to recover from the pandemic; he may also face some political opposition from a revamped City Council that is projected to be to his left on issues such as housing and criminal justice.\", \"Brad Lander and Jumaane D. Williams are also likely to be elected to the other two citywide positions as comptroller and public advocate, and both are also considered further to the left than Mr. Adams. Mr. Williams is contemplating a run for governor.\", \"Voters will decide on five ballot measures, including two that would widen voting access, allowing same-day voter registration and making it easier to cast absentee ballots. Also on the ballot are changes to the legislative redistricting process and a measure that would grant New Yorkers a constitutional right to clean air, water and a \\u201chealthful environment.\\u201d\", \"In New Jersey, the headline matchup is between Gov. Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat, and his Republican challenger, Jack Ciattarelli. The entire State Legislature is also up for election, and there are two ballot questions, including one on whether to expand sports betting.\", \"The New Jersey race is one of two governors\\u2019 contests in the nation that will be held before next year\\u2019s midterm elections and is being viewed as a barometer on how Democrats might perform. The race could show how voters will respond to coronavirus-related mandates put in place to quell a pandemic that has killed more than 745,000 Americans.\", \"Elsewhere in New York, the race for mayor in Buffalo between India B. Walton, a democratic socialist, and the Democratic incumbent, Byron W. Brown, has become the most closely watched race in the state.\", \"Mr. Brown, a former state Democratic Party chairman, lost to Ms. Walton in the primary and is running as a write-in candidate. Mr. Brown has pursued an aggressive strategy, spending $100,000 to purchase ink stamps bearing his name to allow voters to easily cast their ballot in his favor.\", \"Ms. Walton would make history with her victory. She would be the first socialist to lead a major American city in decades and would also be the first Black woman elected to lead New York\\u2019s second largest city.\"]","href_hash":"54165c3a3b9411ec8d4b000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"54165c3a3b9411ec8d4b000017025a03"}},
