I have a new coach (Mike Jacobs) and my training environment has changed.\", \"\\\"I came to Europe early to do a long pre-camp and it has been a process of falling back in love with the sport and understanding the opportunities athletics gives me. It is more than just training hard, there is so much fun to be had and so many cool experiences. Taking all that in has made me more confident.\\\"\", \"Grimaldi still has her specialist event the long jump to come this weekend.\", \"\\\"Speed is a massive part of the long jump, it is my biggest asset and I could feel the last couple of weeks when practising long jump it was getting harder to take off which usually means I'm running fast.\\\"\", \"-RNZ\"]","href_hash":"8cfc0e30202811ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8cfc0e30202811ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
