The truly demented movie version of the book, made by none other than Orson Welles, opened with a couple walking through a lovely park until it became clear they were wearing bizarre protective metal masks.\", \"Yikes!\", \"\\u201cOur modern technologies have achieved a degree of sophistication beyond our wildest dreams, but this technology has exacted a pretty heavy price,\\u201d Welles intoned. \\u201cWe live in an age of anxiety and a time of stress and with all our sophistication, we are in fact the victims of our own technological strength. We are the victims of shock, of \\u2026\\u201d\", \"You got it: Future Shock!!!\", \"As it turned out, it\\u2019s been a more soothing ride into the digital apocalypse, lined with big-screen TVs, delightful handheld supercomputers called smartphones, nifty apps that deliver us all manner of things and a once seemingly innocuous phenomenon called social media. But make no mistake, technology today is ruling us, not the other way around.\", \"We\\u2019re still headed around the bend, as Toffler predicted correctly, but it\\u2019s been without the creepy robot look and piercing screaming imagined 50 odd years ago. Instead, it\\u2019s AirPods that drown out the inner agony and a flood of invective on Twitter, YouTube and Facebook.\", \"I\\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the future this past week, with the birth on Monday of my fourth child. He came four weeks early, in some kind of innocent hurry to get to the planet, I suppose, even as if it feels to many of us like it might be falling apart.\", \"Still, when you get to four kids, some part of you must truly believe in a better future. Even if none of us can truly predict what the future will bring.\", \"If you\\u2019d asked me 19 years ago, when my first kid arrived and I was still carrying a feature-free Nokia cellphone, I never would have guessed that super-powerful smartphones would be ubiquitous and even affordable for the masses. Ditto for advancements like Microsoft\\u2019s Xbox 360 and the Apple iPod nano, which came in 2005 when my second child was born. Facebook was a year old at the time and Tesla barely two (and a risky proposition at that). It would be four more years before anyone heard of Uber or Bitcoin, let alone swole Jeff Bezos, who in the mid-2000s was still sporting his trademark pleated khakis.\", \"By late 2019, when my daughter arrived on the scene, who could have foreseen that an emerging and deadly global pandemic would solidify tech\\u2019s dominance, not challenge it? In two of the world\\u2019s most vulnerable years, Big Tech has weaved its way completely into our lives with a kind of iron grip, and the mania that \\u201cFuture Shock\\u201d cautioned against.\", \"That\\u2019s why I would rather not rely on the present mess to predict the future. On the horizon are massive changes in transportation (fully autonomous vehicles and truly useful drones), health (extensive gene-editing and augmented bodies), decision making (super artificial intelligence and edge computing) and, yes, robots too. Some of these will make our lives better and some will just make the lives of technologists better.\", \"There is no doubt that tech will further envelop my children and they will put it on and take it off like they might a T-shirt. In fact, future tech could itself be in a T-shirt.\", \"Not that I expect my children\\u2019s generation to be shocked by it all. Unlike my analog upbringing, they were born into a digital world. They see these changes coming from a mile away. My only hope as I look into the eyes of my infant is that power in his time will be more equally distributed, unlike today when just a handful of people are deciding the fate of technological advancement.\", \"Or, as Toffler wrote: \\u201cWe must search out totally new ways to anchor ourselves, for all the old roots, religion, nation, community, family, or profession are now shaking under the hurricane impact of the accelerative thrust.\\u201d\", \"This week I caught up with Mark Mahaney, senior managing director at EvercoreISI and the author of \\u201cNothing But Net,\\u201d to hear his thoughts about tech company valuations. I\\u2019ve edited his answers.\", \"Some newer tech companies like the electric vehicle maker Rivian are seeing massive valuations, especially compared to their output and revenue. What do you make of this and how does it compare to those who questioned Tesla\\u2019s valuation to their detriment?\", \"I don\\u2019t have an opinion on Rivian specifically. But I do have an opinion on \\u201cmassive valuations.\\u201d I think almost every one of the largest tech companies in the world today was accused of having massive valuations at the time of their initial public offerings; as well as 10 years ago, and five years ago, and two years ago. And they are all close to or at all-time highs today. If you had primarily focused on valuation, you would have missed every single one of these. Of course, valuation matters. But one of my biggest lessons from the almost 25 years I have spent covering tech stocks is that valuation is not an exact science and it carries precision traps. Valuation should NOT be the most important factor in picking tech stocks.\", \"In that case, what should?\", \"Prioritize your focus on total addressable markets, the strength of the management team, the level and quality of product innovation and how compelling the value proposition of the product or the service is to customers. What valuation-first investors have missed is how powerful the combination of the above four factors can be in driving premium growth for years and years. Which in turn can turn companies with \\u201cmassive valuations\\u201d into highly reasonably-priced stocks.\", \"You have covered tech stocks for a long time. What is the state of them now and your outlook for what\\u2019s important next?\", \"The global spread of smartphones and the rise of global marketing platforms like Google and Facebook and Amazon have allowed companies to scale in a way that they never could prior to 10 years ago. And the rise of cloud computing has allowed them to scale at a fraction of what it would have cost in the past. Near-term, there is no question that Covid has accelerated the digitization of just about everything.\", \"What is the stock or area you think needs more attention in the future?\", \"I am very intrigued by the metaverse. For two reasons: At least two very successful tech platforms (Facebook and Microsoft) are investing in this opportunity; and the Roblox generation is and will be perfectly comfortable living in the metaverse. Just ask your kids! One stock? Uber, which is almost certainly a long-term winner from the Covid crisis. But it\\u2019s not trading like it. It\\u2019s still 25 percent off its highs, whereas most of the major tech companies are trading at their all-time highs. And it screens well for me on those four criteria I mentioned before.\", \"A few weeks ago, I praised a letter that the Activision Blizzard chief executive Bobby Kotick sent to employees addressing reports of sexual harassment and discrimination that emerged after California officials this summer filed a lawsuit against the enormous video game company he grew from next to nothing. I wrote that it was a good thing to be clear about the thorny issues at the company, which makes hits like \\u201cCall of Duty,\\u201d name solutions and, most of all, to take responsibility.\\u201cThe guardrails weren\\u2019t in place everywhere to ensure that our values were being upheld,\\u201d Kotick wrote in the letter. \\u201cIn some cases, people didn\\u2019t consistently feel comfortable reporting concerns, or their concerns weren\\u2019t always addressed promptly or properly.\\u201d\", \"Including by him, according to a devastating report from The Wall Street Journal this week that painted a very ugly picture of a chief who was trying to tamp down problems, rather than fix them.\", \"The crux, from The Journal\\u2019s story: \\u201cMr. Kotick has told directors and other executives he wasn\\u2019t aware of many of the allegations of misconduct, and he has played down others, according to people familiar with the matter and internal documents.\", \"\\u201cThose documents, which include memos, emails and regulatory requests, and interviews with former employees and others familiar with the company, however, cast Mr. Kotick\\u2019s response in a different light. They show that he knew about allegations of employee misconduct in many parts of the company. He didn\\u2019t inform the board of directors about everything he knew, the interviews and documents show, even after regulators began investigating the incidents in 2018. Some departing employees who were accused of misconduct were praised on the way out, while their co-workers were asked to remain silent about the matters.\\u201d\", \"There have been calls for Kotick\\u2019s resignation, but the board has backed him and shifting course seems unlikely if he continues to lead Activision to bigger hits and profits. Its market value under his leadership has risen from $14 billion to around $54 billion in a decade.\", \"But given that this Journal report is clearly different than the tone of contrition that Kotick struck in the letter, he deserves a tough and independent investigation by Activision\\u2019s directors and outsiders. But I am doubtful of this happening since the board appears to have been out to lunch this entire time, as far too many tech boards are, relying on a potentially compromised management to investigate itself.\", \"That needs to end. As Kotick wrote in the letter: \\u201cI truly wish not a single employee had had an experience at work that resulted in hurt, humiliation, or worse \\u2014 and to those who were affected, I sincerely apologize. You have my commitment that we will do everything possible to honor our values and create the workplace every member of this team deserves.\\u201d\", \"In my last post, I noted: Let\\u2019s hope he keeps that promise. Now, I say, doing everything possible means coming clean about the past as well as trying to make it better for the future.\", \"\", \"\"]","href_hash":"09b23e7448c911ec950297fae6490429"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"09b23e7448c911ec950297fae6490429"}},
