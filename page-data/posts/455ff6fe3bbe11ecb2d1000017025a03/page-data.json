Hall likes to think about his own obituary. He knows that \\u201cDexter,\\u201d the Showtime drama he starred in for eight seasons, will make its way into its first paragraph.\", \"\\u201cIf not the first sentence,\\u201d he said.\", \"A show about Dexter Morgan (Hall), a Miami blood spatter analyst who moonlights as a quippy serial killer, \\u201cDexter\\u201d premiered in 2006, at the knife point of television\\u2019s antihero obsession. A perennial Emmy contender during its run, the show has a complicated legacy. It ended in 2013 with an episode, \\u201cRemember the Monsters?,\\u201d that often ranks with the worst finales in TV history. (Quick recap: flatlining sister, murder by pen, well-timed hurricane, Dexter is a lumberjack now.)\", \"\\u201cIt left a bad taste in audiences\\u2019 mouths and in mine as well,\\u201d he said. This was on a sun-glazed October afternoon at an outdoor cafe near his uptown apartment, and he was bettering that bad taste with a scone and an Americano. Hall likes his coffee the way he likes his prestige series \\u2014 dark \\u2014 and his sense of humor skews bleak, too. He made several jokes about cancer (he survived Hodgkin\\u2019s lymphoma a decade ago), which he leavened with his thin smile.\", \"Hall has a square chin, broad Cro-Magnon brow and flinty green eyes. (Paleolithic, but sexy with it.) In a baby blue shirt with long underwear peeking out beneath, he looked like any other fashionably rugged Upper West Sider. But fans recognize him pretty often, and when they do, they shout, \\u201cDexter,\\u201d not \\u201cMichael.\\u201d They ask him to pretend-murder them for selfies. They used to tell him that they wished that the show would come back. And in some ways, Hall wished for that, too.\", \"\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t some tremendous burden,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut I had been preoccupied with the unfinished-business feelings.\\u201d\", \"Hall has put that burden down. \\u201cDexter: New Blood,\\u201d a 10-episode limited series, arrives Sunday on Showtime. While it appears in the midst of television\\u2019s current fascination with reboots, revivals, prequels and sequels, \\u201cNew Blood\\u201d feels less like a reprise and more like a reprisal, a deliberate redress to the sloppiness of the original\\u2019s last several seasons and an attempt by Hall to recuperate the character that has defined his career.\", \"\\u201cIf I\\u2019m going to do this,\\u201d Hall\\u2019s Dexter says as he contemplates his first kill in a decade, \\u201cI\\u2019ve got to do it right.\\u201d\", \"Set in a snowbound town in upstate New York, \\u201cNew Blood\\u201d (\\u201cIn Cold Blood\\u201d was already taken) finds Dexter living under an assumed name, working at a fish and game emporium and abstaining from murder. (The series was shot in Western Massachusetts.) Trading Miami\\u2019s sweaty pastels for coniferous forests and flannel, this new show quiets Dexter\\u2019s overwrought internal monologue and keeps the original\\u2019s gruesome comedy to a minimum.\", \"Dexter relapses, of course. But he doesn\\u2019t enjoy murder the way he used to. His \\u201cDark Passenger,\\u201d the drive that moves him to kill, has taken a back seat, and there\\u2019s less separation between Dexter the killer and Dexter the snowsuit-wearing man about town.\", \"\\u201cI may be a monster, but I\\u2019m an evolving monster,\\u201d he says in the \\u201cNew Blood\\u201d pilot.\", \"It seems odd to revive a series while abandoning much of what made that series distinct, replacing equatorial heat with a mood that Clyde Phillips, the showrunner for the first four seasons of \\u201cDexter\\u201d and for \\u201cNew Blood,\\u201d called \\u201ccold and monastic and abstemious.\\u201d But the difference is purposeful.\", \"\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t want it to be \\u2018Dexter\\u2019 Season 9,\\u201d Phillips said on a recent video call. \\u201cWe wanted to honor the fact that 10 years have passed.\\u201d (Arriving eight years after the \\u201cDexter\\u201d finale, the reboot fudges the calendar slightly.)\", \"Showtime and Hall had entertained various \\u201cDexter\\u201d pitches over the years, including one from Hall\\u2019s mother that found Dexter in a monastery. (Monastic? Yes. Monastery? No.) Only Phillips\\u2019s idea, which reunited Dexter with Harrison, the son he abandoned a decade ago, felt right.\", \"When Hall heard the pitch, about two and a half years ago, he agreed to it immediately. He appreciated how it allowed Dexter to move in new directions while still maintaining \\u201cconnective tissue\\u201d (this is Hall\\u2019s body-horror metaphor, not mine) with the original show.\", \"Aside from Harrison, who is played in \\u201cNew Blood\\u201d by Jack Alcott, much of that continuity arrives in the ghostly form of Jennifer Carpenter\\u2019s Debra, Dexter\\u2019s foul-mouthed foster sister. Dexter killed Deb in the finale, unplugging her from life support and dumping her body in the bay. But dead Deb still shows up to razz her brother, taking over the role of conscience from Harry (James Remar), Dexter\\u2019s dead adoptive dad.\", \"Carpenter never felt especially bad about the finale. \\u201cBecause I was at the bottom of the ocean dead,\\u201d she said, referring to her character\\u2019s fate on an early morning phone call. But she and Hall, who eloped and then divorced during the run of the original show, have remained friends, and when he described the new series, she wanted to join it, however ethereally.\", \"Hall was diagnosed with Hodgkin\\u2019s lymphoma during production on the fourth season of \\u201cDexter\\u201d \\u2014 he kept the news private until shooting wrapped and received treatment during the show\\u2019s hiatus. Dexter had a painful secret and for a while Hall did, too, which was useful for the role, he said.\", \"But he has been in remission for more than a decade, and is married, seemingly quite happily, to the writer and critic Morgan Macgregor. Which would seem to place him at some remove from the darkness that a character like Dexter requires. Where will he find that darkness now?\", \"\\u201cOh it\\u2019s there,\\u201d he said, making his voice rumble just slightly. \\u201cIt\\u2019s there.\\u201d\", \"Probably it is. Hall\\u2019s particular genius \\u2014 from his breakout role as a mortician on \\u201cSix Feet Under\\u201d (2001-05) to \\u201cDexter\\u201d to his frequent collaborations with the playwright Will Eno to his stints in Broadway musicals \\u2014 is projecting a pleasant, somewhat blank exterior while also suggesting the torment and the mess roiling just underneath.\", \"\\u201cHe has these great multitudes and contradictions\\u201d Eno, a close friend of his, said. \\u201cAnd he covers it all with a pretty down-to-earth regular wrapper.\\u201d\", \"A low-key version of this emerged even in casual conversation. (Or as casual as a conversation can be when there are a couple of digital recorders in between the coffee cups.) On the surface, Hall was placid, thoughtful, unfailingly polite. But he fidgeted constantly \\u2014 tapping fingers on the table, rubbing his palms on his pants \\u2014 and was hyper-aware of his surroundings, pausing every time an engine revved or a truck backed up. He can seem like a man performing a chat rather than having one.\", \"Hall is mindful of this doubleness, which he traces back to his very early adolescence in Raleigh, N.C. Hall\\u2019s father died of prostate cancer when Hall was 11, and Hall intuited, rightly or wrongly, that showing the full range of his feelings wouldn\\u2019t be appropriate. So he learned how to cover up those feelings, and then later how to channel them into acting.\", \"Dexter, too, has taught himself to sublimate his more extreme impulses; the parallels can seem uncomfortably apt. Hall is mindful of this, as well.\", \"\\u201cMaybe I\\u2019m drawn to characters who have some sort of stormy interiority that they don\\u2019t feel free to let out,\\u201d he said. \\u201cMaybe that\\u2019s how I experience my own life. Maybe I experience it less in my life for having the chance to take it into my work.\\u201d\", \"Then he raised his eyebrows waggishly. \\u201cWho knows what I would have done over the past 16 years if I hadn\\u2019t been able to simulate all that murder?\\u201d he said.\", \"He simulates it, in the old series and the new one, with a mix of what Phillips calls \\u201cutter control and absolute abandonment.\\u201d (Carpenter was more pragmatic in her praise: \\u201cHe works his butt off. He\\u2019s on time, he never carries sides. He\\u2019s just a workhorse.\\u201d)\", \"After that first \\u201cDexter\\u201d finale, Hall took on other roles \\u2014 some theater, a few movies, a limited series or two. But no one really talks about his work in \\u201cSafe\\u201d or \\u201cThe Defeated.\\u201d No one wants a selfie with the guy from \\u201cCold in July\\u201d or \\u201cLazarus.\\u201d \\u201cDexter\\u201d has even somewhat eclipsed his Emmy-nominated role on \\u201cSix Feet Under.\\u201d He played a killer so well that audiences don\\u2019t seem to want to see him any other way.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s not a ton I can do about it \\u2014 other than to return and play that character again,\\u201d he said. How long will he play him? \\u201cI definitely didn\\u2019t come back thinking we were going to do eight more seasons,\\u201d he said. So unless the producers botch this finale, too, Dexter may soon lay down his very many knives for good. That doesn\\u2019t mean that Hall will ever quite escape him. (If you have seen the show, you know that Dexter has few escapees.)\", \"Does that ever bother him, that his life will forever be manacled to a fictional killer\\u2019s? That Dexter\\u2019s name will introduce any obituary?\", \"\\u201cSure,\\u201d he said. But then he thought better of it. \\u201cI mean, I don\\u2019t know. I\\u2019ll be dead. I won\\u2019t be here for that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"455ff6fe3bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"455ff6fe3bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}},
