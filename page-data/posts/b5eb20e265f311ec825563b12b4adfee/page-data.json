I think we've seen it in patches, just not enough through 90 minutes. When the expectation drops a little bit, the players start to rise to the occasion, but I think they've got to do that from the first minute through to the 95th minute of the game.''\", \"Meanwhile, Talay says new recruit, Mexican winger Gael Sandoval has impressed at training this week, but still needs a few more days to recover from a long travel schedule.\", \"\\\"He's looking good ... we haven't done too much with him, he's done some parts of the session, we're mindful of him travelling from Mexico, it's a long flight to Australia.\", \"\\\"But he's had a couple of days to recover and he's joined the group. He's looking good, the disappointing part is we can't use him till mid-January.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"b5eb20e265f311ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b5eb20e265f311ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
