These are now all in play.\", \"\\\"But the extent of the apparent credit constriction amounts to an extra handful of sand in the market's gears that we didn't previously allow for,\\\" he said.\", \"Jones said the drop in house prices would affect some people's who have been using their growing paper wealth to back their borrowing.\", \"He said the housing boom had played a critical role in the boom in consumer spending.\", \"\\\"The fact that boom now seems to have run its course I think does have implications for consumer spending going forward.\\\"\", \"Jones said even if there was some recovery of house sales in February, demand was no longer running ahead of supply.\", \"\\\"Separate data from realestate.co.nz confirm new listings are finally trending higher.
