Law enforcement records show that Pankey had other unrelated run-ins with Greeley police. They describe mostly minor and non-violent allegations, like creating a nuisance and harassment. In fact, the day before Jonelle disappeared, Pankey was arrested at a bank for harassment and criminal trespass.\", \"Anthony Viorst: He argued with a bank teller and the police were called. \", \"The police and court records of what happened with the charges are no longer available.\", \"Anthony Viorst: That's the kind of thing that's happened to Mr. Pankey over the years.

Zero physical evidence, OK?\", \"John Gates knows the evidence is circumstantial, but he believes it is as strong as it is strange.\", \"Mayor John Gates: This is \\u2026 some of the most bizarre stuff I've ever heard, and I've been around the block.\", \"About two years after 12-year-old Jonelle Matthews vanished from her home in Greeley, Colorado, her family made the painful decision to pack up and leave town.\", \"Jim Matthews: You have to go on with life. You can't let this consume you.\", \"Around that same time, Steven Pankey, his young son and his wife, who was pregnant with their second son, also left Greeley. The Pankey family bounced around from state to state for a while. In 1989, they settled in Idaho, but Pankey admits he could not stop thinking about Jonelle.\", \"STEVE PANKEY [to KMVT]: It would be in the back of my mind about this case \\u2026 so I called \\u2026 the guy who lived next door \\u2026 I just asked, \\\"did they ever resolve that Jonelle Matthews thing?\\\" And he said, no, not to his knowledge.\", \"But Pankey might have been more than just curious. In 1999 he told the Idaho Supreme Court, after a conviction for once again causing a scene in a bank, that the conviction \\u2014 which was dismissed years later \\u2014 was in part an \\\"attempt to force\\\" him \\\"to become an informant\\\" in Jonelle's disappearance. He also wrote that he feared he might \\\"get the death penalty for revealing the location of\\\" her body.\\u00a0\", \"Richard Schlesinger: See, that's weird.

I agree with you that it's weird \\u2026 \\u00a0It just makes zero sense. It's just \\u2014 he is a strange guy. \\u2026 and we submit that \\u2026 he never knew where the body was because he didn't do this. \", \"But over the years there was even more strange behavior, moments that, authorities believe add up to circumstantial evidence.\\u00a0\", \"Richard Schlesinger: What did you think of him? How did he seem to you?\", \"Kevin Schneider: Very odd.\", \"Kevin Schneider says he met the Pankey family when they first moved to Idaho. His son was friends with Pankey's son, Mark.\", \"Richard Schlesinger: Did your son ever see any unusual things at the Pankey house when he was over there? \", \"Kevin Schneider: Yes, he did. One time, I guess their family dog was doing a lot of barking, and it was irritating Steven. And he took duct tape and wrapped it around the dog's muzzle. \", \"Richard Schlesinger: Ohh. \", \"Pankey denies he ever did that, but Kevin says Pankey's son Mark was so unhappy living at home that the Schneiders took him in for about six years.\", \"Kevin Schneider: He couldn't take his dad.\", \"In 2001, Pankey's wife filed for divorce, and he moved to Shoshone, Idaho, where in 2004 without any experience with law enforcement, other than being arrested, he ran for sheriff.\", \"He lost, but Pankey still wanted to be sheriff somewhere. In 2008, he thought about running in Twin Falls, where he went to church with Ryan Horsley, a political consultant.\", \"Ryan Horsley: I was kind of confused because our local sheriff actually went to our church.\", \"Richard Schlesinger: He wanted to run against \\u2026 a fellow church member? \", \"Ryan Horsley: Yeah. \\u2026 it just seemed really weird that he didn't have a grievance against our local sheriff \\u2026 And so just seemed like he was just running just to run.\", \"Pankey might have thought better about running in Twin Falls. In 2008, he ran for sheriff in Shoshone once again. And, once again, he didn't come close to winning. But his political ambitions grew, and he became a serial candidate.\", \"Ryan Horsley: He's ran for lieutenant governor once. \\u2026 he's ran for governor two times. \\u2026 And one of the times he ran for governor was a real dumpster fire.\", \"Richard Schlesinger: What made that campaign a dumpster fire? \", \"Ryan Horsley: He ran under the Constitutional Party. \\u2026 at their state convention, he claimed that they tried to do an exorcism on him. \", \"Richard Schlesinger: I'm sorry, did you say an exorcism? \", \"Ryan Horsley: Yes. \", \"Richard Schlesinger: I know that you're a politician and not a priest, but did he seem in need of an exorcism?\\u00a0\", \"Ryan Horsley:\\u00a0It just seemed strange. I was just kind of glued to the headlines this whole time on just his stories \\u2014 that they just didn't make sense.\", \"For the record, the Constitution Party denies Pankey or anyone else was exorcised \\u2014 at least by them. In 2018, Pankey made a second attempt at becoming governor and to no one's surprise, he lost.
