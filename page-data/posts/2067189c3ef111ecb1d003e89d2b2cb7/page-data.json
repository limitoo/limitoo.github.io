Seven in 10 Americans have at least one analog clock in their home, but fewer than half have two, and just one in five have three or more clocks in their home.\", \"Still, analog clocks may be going out of style with younger adults. Nearly half of those under 35 don't have one, and a third of Americans between 35 and 44 also don't have an analog clock in their home either.\\u00a0 \\u00a0\", \"Nevertheless, most Americans think children should still know how to read them. Three in four think children should still be taught in school how to tell time with an analog clock \\u2014 including most Americans who don't have an analog clock in their home themselves.
