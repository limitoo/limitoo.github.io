Won't that push up inflation in Australia, even if wages don't rise faster?\", \"\\\"An important question is whether consumption patterns will normalise over time\\u00a0and, if so, what effect will this have on prices,\\\" Dr Lowe said.\", \"\\\"There is genuine uncertainty here. It is likely, though, that consumption patterns will return to something more normal.\", \"\\\"This is not only because we can once again consume many services, but also because households are unlikely to make repeat purchases of durable goods.\\\"\", \"Even though prices may settle at a higher level than pre-pandemic, if they stop rising then that will also halt inflation in its tracks, Dr Lowe explained.\", \"That is unless workers get uppity in the meantime and successfully demand higher pay packets to compensate for the rise in prices.\", \"\\\"If a period of higher wages growth were to reset wage growth norms, this would have a persistent effect on overall inflation,\\\" Dr Lowe added.\", \"The net result is that interest rates are likely to remain at record lows for a couple more years, that is unless your pay packet\\u00a0starts climbing, in which case the RBA will hope that you'll be able to afford the extra repayments.\"]","href_hash":"0f39e2b0469011ec88e249b980b2ac05"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0f39e2b0469011ec88e249b980b2ac05"}},
