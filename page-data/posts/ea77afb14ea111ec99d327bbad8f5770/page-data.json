Or at least it would if the seller was willing to part with it. Passers-by ask about it constantly. Instead, they are welcome to choose among memoirs by 1990s sitcom stars, yellowing Chopin sheet music, and illustrated books on dog grooming. And pickles.\", \"Sweet Pickle Books is mostly a bookstore, with a healthy side business of artisanal pickles and various donated knickknacks. Since Leigh Altshuler opened her tiny shop on Manhattan\\u2019s Lower East Side a year ago, much of her stock has been donated to the store.\", \"\\u201cAll my friends are, like, 80,\\u201d Ms. Altshuler said from behind an appropriated tanker desk, upon which sits a VHS copy of \\u201cCrossing Delancey,\\u201d the \\u201980s movie about a pickle peddler who falls in love with a bookseller in this very neighborhood. It is also not for sale.\", \"\\u201cI have, like, three million old ladies calling me, whom I\\u2019ve ended up becoming friends with,\\u201d Ms. Altshuler said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re always asking me to come over.\\u201d Her new friends and other Lower East Siders, upon discovering the store, feel compelled to contribute by passing along, say, their still-pristine copy of Rick Steves\\u2019s 2002 guidebook on Rome.\", \"And shoppers are into it. \\u201cThe other Sunday, someone had left a giant FreshDirect bag with old DVDs like \\u2018My Best Friend\\u2019s Wedding,\\u2019 some teeny-tiny wine glasses and a half-eaten bag of Fritos,\\u201d Ms. Altshuler said. \\u201cSold all of it except the Fritos.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Altshuler, 30, lives four blocks away from the store with her boyfriend, Costa Damaskos, 29, who runs a design agency.\", \"RIVER DANCE Here\\u2019s what Costa and I try to do as the sun is rising on Sundays: we\\u2019ll walk along the East River, down under the F.D.R. There\\u2019s this whole world going on down by Pier 36 that people don\\u2019t know about. Men in their 60s and 70s doing Tai Chi \\u2014 really working it. Guys fishing. Women doing an incredible, choreographed dance to obscure, techno-ish songs pumping through a speaker they must wheel out with a dolly. I don\\u2019t know who\\u2019s in charge, who\\u2019s picking the music; but nobody\\u2019s taking selfies, posting it on Instagram; propping up their iPhone, doing a thing for TikTok. And I\\u2019m like, if these women can get out here and do this dance at 6:30 in the morning, just to do it, then I can certainly make it to work on time today.\", \"CASH ONLY At some point during the morning, I make juice with fruit from one of those kitchen supply stores on East Broadway. Whatever produce TLB Trading has \\u2014 ginger, carrot, bok choy, apples. They have everything. It\\u2019s hard to leave without buying little kitchen items. For example, a teeny-tiny cheese grater. Every time we go I\\u2019m like, \\u201cI\\u2019m bringing cash, because it\\u2019s cash only.\\u201d And Costa will say, \\u201cNo, it\\u2019s not.\\u201d Then he\\u2019ll try to pay with credit card, and they\\u2019ll say, \\u201cIt\\u2019s cash only.\\u201d That happens every single time.\", \"SUPPLY CHAIN For weeks, a lady in her 80s named Pearl kept tapping on the shop door, saying: \\u201cYou have to come over! My neighbor down the street in Seward Park has a book collection he needs to show you. He doesn\\u2019t have a phone.\\u201d When I finally caved and walked to see the neighbor in question, Milton, who turned out to be literally 100 years old, said: \\u201cI have 4,000 books. And, you know, I\\u2019m getting a little older now and need to get rid of some. I just need help.\\u201d\", \"FULLY BOOKED So now I\\u2019m cleaning Milton\\u2019s place on the weekends. It\\u2019s a two-minute drive from the shop. I could walk it, but when I\\u2019m going, I\\u2019m not getting one box, I\\u2019m getting a car full. I paid some Craigslist guy cash for my silver 2004 Jeep Liberty with one zillion miles on it. And I cannot let this car die. Smoke comes out of it sometimes. People say, \\u201cYour car is smoking!\\u201d And I\\u2019m just like, \\u201cOh, I know.\\u201d\", \"SHOPTALK When I open the store at noon, there\\u2019s always books and bags of things on the stoop. Most of the time when people come in wanting to sell me their books, I\\u2019ll offer them cash, and they\\u2019ll say, \\u201cI just want the pickles.\\u201d Though there is still a 70-something woman who brings in a leather briefcase filled with cassette tapes. Uhm, I don\\u2019t want the cassette tapes. At all. But, there\\u2019s just something about her bringing them to me. So I look at all of them; I count them. Then buy them all with cash rather than pickles.\", \"DINNER DATE AT WU\\u2019S At 6, I lock the door and my workweek is finally over \\u2014 Monday is my only day off. I\\u2019m, like, done. Costa and I go to dinner at this Chinese place across from our apartment, Wu\\u2019s Won Ton King. Lo mien, bok choy, veggie noodles; I drink tea. We know the Wu\\u2019s people. Sometimes they let us keep the Jeep parked out in front of the restaurant. They\\u2019re like, \\u201cWe\\u2019ll watch it, we got you,\\u201d which is good because I park in illegal spots all the time and owe so much money. Last time I called to fight tickets, New York City\\u2019s Department of Finance said, \\u201cWe have to transfer you to a parking specialist.\\u201d\", \"CARDS, CLEANING Our apartment is TV-less, so Costa and I will play card games. Right now it\\u2019s Quiddler, which I bought from that board game cafe in the West Village, the Uncommons, it\\u2019s all about going to get something at a store rather than online. Then sometimes we\\u2019ll stay up till 2 a.m. rearranging the apartment. We love to clean.\"]","href_hash":"ea77afb14ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ea77afb14ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}},
