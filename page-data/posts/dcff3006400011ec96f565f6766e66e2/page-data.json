life.\", \"And while, arguably, politics has come a long way since the days where people felt they'd be shunned if they came out,\\u00a0it's still not without its difficulties.\", \"On this week's Innies + Outies podcast, the ABCQueer team explored what it's like being queer in a job where public scrutiny is part of the daily grind.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Chansey Paech</div>\", \"A self-described \\\"faboriginal\\\", Chansey was the first openly gay Indigenous politician when he was elected\\u00a0to the NT parliament in 2016.\", \"But his career in politics started a couple of years before that when he ran for a councillor position on the Alice Springs Town Council.\", \"\\\"I thought, you can't be what you can't see, that's really important,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I felt, you know, as a gay Aboriginal person living in Central Australia, when I looked at the Council at the time, it was predominantly non-Indigenous, middle class, over-50, who\\u00a0made up the Council, and I didn't think that that was representative of our community at all.\", \"\\\"And to also make sure that we're at the table rather than being on the menu.\\\"\", \"<img

NT.(Supplied)</div>\", \"Growing up in Central Australia, Chansey said\\u00a0he didn't experience the kind of homophobia or rejection others have experienced.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Many family friends or extended family members had someone who, who was either a lesbian or was gay or was trans or was a sister girl or a brother boy,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Sure, there's been some adverse comments thrown around in the heat of the moment with some people but not that kind of direct picking on me in and around town.\\\"\", \"It wasn't until his campaign for NT parliament that he was on the receiving end of homophobic comments in an attempt to dissuade people from voting for him.\", \"For Chansey, that work involves being the Minister for Remote Housing, Arts and Culture and Local Government \\u2014 among others.\", \"But in the chamber, his drive comes from striving toward \\\"equity and equality\\\" for all Territorians, including the LGBTIQA+ community.\", \"\\\"I think the thing I'm most proud about is being involved in putting forward progressive reform,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"So changing lives for the better,\\u00a0making sure that we can provide, you know, accessible housing for people who need it.\", \"\\\"I\\u00a0have to say one of the most important changes that I was able to advocate and get through in the territory parliament last term\\u00a0was bringing in new birth certificates here in the territory, where [we]\\u00a0were able to work through and actually allow the individual to have a say on how their gender was recorded on their birth certificate.\",

elected to federal parliament after Malcolm Turnbull resigned from the seat of Wentworth.(ABC News: Toby Hunt)</div>\", \"Dr Kerryn Phelps has lived a few different political lives \\u2014 first as NSW and then federal president of the Australian Medical Association, then into local government, a tilt at federal politics in 2018-19 before returning to her current role as councillor for the City of Sydney.\", \"It was in her first position as head of the NSW AMA in the late 1990s that a Sydney newspaper, looking for a way to cover the 1998 Mardi Gras, decided to out Kerryn and her partner Jackie Stricker-Phelps.\", \"\\\"[It] occupied almost the whole page of the newspaper, so the cat really was out of the bag and everybody knew that we were not only in a relationship, but that we had had a marriage ceremony,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"It was terrifying, because suddenly we became the focus of, you know, unwelcome attention\", \"\\\"But I have to say, you know, the attention was something that Jackie and I decided that we could turn around to positive and something that we could, we could really use to highlight issues around discrimination.\\\"\", \"Years before it would be legal in the US or in Australia, Kerryn and Jackie had flown to New York and had a marriage ceremony as a \\\"wonderful way\\\" to affirm and share their love for one another.\", \"Little did they know it would be the beginning of a long crusade for not only marriage equality, but equal rights for the LGBTQIA+ communities Australia-wide.\", \"\\\"We started talking about marriage and the need for legal recognition back in 1998,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"To us it was very important, because we could see that there was so much disadvantage for people who were in same-sex relationships, who didn't\\u00a0have the same rights as people who were in mixed-gender relationships, and particularly for people with, with children, who, you know, faced all manner of discrimination.\\\"\", \"Kerryn admits that she felt pigeonholed in the years after she was outed, with people \\\"pretty consistently\\\" referring to her as a \\\"lesbian doctor\\\" or the\\\"lesbian president of the AMA\\\".\", \"\\\"It took a little while not to be described by my sexuality, but over time, it did disappear,\\\" she said.\", \"Her passion for equality and social justice has shaped the roles of influence she's taken, with one of Kerryn's proudest moments being her work as an independent to successfully see legislation introduced \\u2014 without the support of the government\\u00a0\\u2014 that would become known as the medevac laws.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We found ourselves on the crossbench with the balance of power for a period of time and so we were able to, at that time, negotiate some landmark legislation,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Which ensured that people seeking asylum who were trapped in indefinite offshore detention were able to be brought to Australia on doctor's recommendations, and not to be blocked by bureaucrats or politicians to get the health care that they needed.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3fe9535c9127b98d17008a1b6ad44be3\\\"

discussion\\u00a0about the merits of his, and thousands of other Australians', relationships.\", \"Tim described when the Yes\\u00a0vote was returned, and later when the legislation was passed, \\u00a0as moments of both \\\"pure jubilation\\\" and, much like Kerryn, relief and closure that the decades-long fight was over.\", \"\\\"I was of course\\u00a0very happy, but it was actually just relief that it was done,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Because if you've been involved in a campaign for as long as a decade, you actually don't want it to keep going and you want it to be because you've achieved your goal, but it was also the opportunity to say, 'OK,\\u00a0now we can focus on something else as well'.\\\"\", \"But even before the final hurdle was cleared, he decided to mark the

biggest hurdle he had to deal with was himself.\", \"\\\"The brutal truth is that I basically decided that I either needed to accept it, or take an alternate path, because I wasn't prepared to live a lie,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"But I also wasn't prepared to keep going on the way I was where I felt the very sense, in essence, of who I was, was being hollowed out by my own fear.\\\"\", \"That idea of being unable to live an authentic life is a trait Tim has carried into his public life in politics.\\u00a0\", \"He's very clear that he doesn't care if people like him and doesn't have any plans to
