There are four confirmed in Auckland, one of which is the UK DJ Dimension. The remaining three are a MIQ border worker, their household contact, and a worker at Auckland Airport. There is a fifth person linked to this group that is also likely Omicron, and the sixth is the Palmerston North case.\", \"This person, who has had two doses of the Pfizer vaccine, was staying at an MIQ facility in Christchurch and tested negative five times throughout their stay. They were released on Sunday and got tested on Wednesday after they became symptomatic. Their positive result came back that evening.\", \"\\\"Urgent whole genome sequencing is underway, though, as this case was staying at a MIQ facility at the same time as known Omicron cases, as a prudent measure it is being treated as an Omicron case,\\\" the Ministry of Health says.\", \"\\\"Investigations are underway to determine the source of infection, including possible in-facility transmission.\\\"\", \"They're considered to have been infectious from Monday and they are isolating at home with their family. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says the person's household contacts are also isolating and health officials are tracing secondary contacts.\", \"Although it is yet to be confirmed as an Omicron infection, there were five other active cases on the same floor as this person in the MIQ facility.\", \"\\\"[The ministry] is acting on the assumption it's Omicron and came from their stay in MIQ,\\\" Ardern said during a COVID-19 update on Thursday.\", \"There are several shops around Palmerston North that are now locations of interest. The Ministry of Health says more will be added as they're found:\", \"A full breakdown of health advice for each of these locations is available here.\", \"The Ministry of Health says their objective is to stamp out the infection and prevent any onward transmission related to this case.\", \"\\\"New Zealand's vaccine rollout remains our key defence against all variants of COVID-19, including Omicron. With 93 percent of the eligible population now double-dosed and the booster programme underway, New Zealanders are well protected,\\\" the ministry says.\", \"Aotearoa has so far managed to escape an Omicron outbreak, but once the variant does reach our shores, the whole country will move to red in the traffic light system. However, Ardern says lockdowns won't be used when this happens.\", \"\\\"We know from other countries it can take as little as 14 days for Omicron cases to grow from the hundreds into the thousands,\\\" she says.\", \"\\\"The red setting allows businesses to remain open and domestic travel to continue, but includes mask wearing and gathering restrictions to help slow the spread of the virus and keep pressure off our health system.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"fcaebc6a799311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fcaebc6a799311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
