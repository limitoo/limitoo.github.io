But as negotiations between Manchin and the White House began to break down\\u00a0just before the Christmas holiday over the measure, particularly regarding the expanded child tax credit, Senate Democrats shifted their focus to voting rights legislation.\", \"Pelosi said last month that Democratic leaders are still \\\"hopeful\\\" members could reach an agreement on the social pending plan that would lead to its passage.\", \"While she reiterated Sunday her belief that the White House and Manchin could bridge their divides over the president's proposal, Pelosi said the order of legislative items currently being pursued in the Senate \\u2014 voting rights first, followed by the domestic policy plan \\u2014 is \\\"very appropriate.\\\"\", \"\\\"There's nothing more important for us to do than protect our Constitution and our democracy,\\\" she said. \\\"What the Republicans are doing across the country is really a legislative continuation of what they did on January 6, which is to undermine our democracy, to undermine the integrity of our elections, to undermine the voting power, which is the essence of a democracy.\\\"\", \"\\\"We have to do that bill,\\\" Pelosi continued. \\\"There is no more important bill that enables us to support and defend the Constitution of the United States.\\\"\", \"Still, the margins in the evenly divided Senate effectively make it impossible to get voting rights legislation as currently constructed to Mr. Biden's desk for his signature. Senate Republicans have on numerous occasions blocked legislation that would reform the nation's election laws from advancing, which requires 60 votes, and Schumer last week\\u00a0poured cold water on the possibility of making changes to the Electoral Count Act, which some lawmakers suggested could be updated, in lieu of more sweeping voting rights legislation.\\u00a0\", \"Still, Pelosi said Democrats \\\"have to keep working\\\" to get voting rights legislation through both chambers of Congress.\", \"\\\"They are not only suppressing the vote, suppressing the vote, they are nullifying elections, saying it doesn't matter who gets more votes, it matters who the three we appoint to analyze that, what they decide,\\\" she said. \\\"We cannot let that happen.\\\"\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"108d6856721111ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"108d6856721111ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
