They will ride special buses between their hotels and the sports venues. \", \"Already, Chinese authorities say they've picked up 78 COVID cases among the travelers arriving for the Winter Games, and the influx has only just begun. Anyone who tests positive must go into government supervised isolation. \", \"Chinese authorities are so hyper-alert about the possibility of coronavirus outbreaks marring the Olympics that now, anyone who goes to a drugstore to buy cough or cold medication, or even painkillers or fever reducers, is automatically flagged for a mandatory COVID test.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"4d988a627dee11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4d988a627dee11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
