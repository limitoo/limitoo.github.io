policy experts are divided on whether the South Korean President's trip to Australia is a sign of \"quiet alignment\" with Australia and the US, or simply a move to secure Australian

has a long-standing military alliance with the United States, which still has around 30,000 troops stationed in the country.\", \"Those soldiers are there because South Korea has still not struck a peace treaty with its belligerent neighbour, North Korea.\", \"The two countries maintain an uneasy armistice, but the North \\u2013 which could already inflict unimaginable devastation on the South with its array of conventional weapons \\u2013 has spent the last few decades developing nuclear weapons, stirring existential fears in Washington and beyond.\", \"And then there's China, which is one of the very few countries which can exert any influence over the North \\u2013 although even this is disputed \\u2014 and which has long had a vexed relationship with the South.\", \"Beijing is Seoul's largest trading partner by a huge margin (sound familiar?) and it has not hesitated to use that as leverage when South Korea has displeased it.\", \"In 2017, China targeted multiple South Korean exports and companies with economic sanctions after Seoul installed US anti-missile systems.\", \"So, not surprisingly, South Korean leaders are accustomed to treading very cautiously, and choosing their words carefully.\", \"That might explain why some Australian analysts and officials are so enthused by the fact that South Korea's President Moon Jae-in is making a state visit to Australia right now.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Visit a sign of 'quiet alignment'?</div>\", \"The federal government sees the trip as an endorsement of Australian efforts to strengthen ties with key regional players, and as a powerful riposte to Beijing's campaign to portray Australia as a US lackey ill at ease in the region.\", \"Not that South Korea's government is going to publicly embrace that framing.\", \"Unsurprisingly, Moon was at pains not to be drawn into the mutual recrimination and distrust between Australia and China at a joint press conference with Scott Morrison in Canberra on Monday.\", \"When asked by journalists if Beijing might be irritated by the timing of this visit \\u2013 coming only days after Australia drew yet another furious denunciation from China for joining the diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics \\u2013 Moon played a dead bat.\", \"\\\"We will continue to cooperate with Australia for peace in this region,\\\" the President said.\", \"\\\"The state visit I make at this time has nothing to do with our position over China.\\\"\", \"But to Michael Shoebridge, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, the President's visit \\u2013 along with the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership signed by both nations \\u2013 is more proof that South Korea sees a growing strategic convergence with Canberra.\", \"\\\"Moon's visit now signals some alignment with Australia on the bigger strategic picture around the Quad, AUKUS and the systemic challenge posed by China, but without him needing to bind South Korea to this publicly,\\\" he said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/70d763ec2603e7bb537499446a4af6c9\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Michael Shoebridge says Moon Jae-in's visit is a sign of \\\"quiet alignment\\\" with Australia and the US.(Reuters: Lukas Coch via pool)</div>\", \"Shoebridge thinks that both Seoul and Canberra are increasingly seeing the world in similar ways.\", \"Both are medium-sized powers, both are US allies, both are unnerved by increasing aggression, both have been subjected to economic coercion from Beijing, and both are intent on building their military capability.\", \"And both countries \\u2013 but particularly South Korea \\u2013\\u00a0are grappling with the impacts of technological decoupling between the US and China and with the systemic shocks dealt by the COVID-19 pandemic.\", \"South Korea has always tried to balance its ties with the US and China, not only because of its massive trade exposure but also because it wants and needs Beijing's help to try and negotiate some sort of settlement which will induce the North to abandon its nuclear weapons program.\", \"Moon laid this out quite plainly during the press conference when asked about how both countries could deal with economic punishment campaigns pursued by China.\", \"The President side-stepped the question, referring vaguely to \\\"certain conflicts\\\" and \\\"some issues of competition\\\" while stressing it was crucial to cooperate with China on climate change, and adding \\\"we need the constructive efforts of China to enable denuclearisation of DPRK\\\".\", \"But Shoebridge believes China's leverage over North Korea is often wildly overstated.\", \"He also believes that Moon's statement yesterday signalling broad support for the AUKUS pact and Australia's push for nuclear powered submarines \\u2014 \\\"this is a decision made by Australia as a sovereign nation and we respect that\\\" \\u2013 is an encouraging sign of \\\"quiet alignment\\\".\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d9cbe2f022fae37b1924bb433b2dc90f\\\"

this week.(Reuters: Lukas Coch via pool)</div>\", \"Then there are the howitzers.\", \"South Korea has massively expanded its defence industry, and representatives from manufacturing giant Hanwha yesterday finally inked a $1 billion contract \\u2013 first announced more than two years ago \\u2013 to build 30 self-propelled howitzers and 15 armoured ammunition resupply vehicles for the army.\", \"Australian officials see this as sign that South Korea is willing to integrate itself more closely not just with the ADF but also with the broader US-led strategy to balance Chinese power in the region.\", \"Shoebridge said South Korea's strategic imagination had\\u00a0\\\"moved way beyond its northern peninsular neighbour\\\" and said the big investments it had\\u00a0been making to build up its navy and missile arsenal pointed to new ambitions.\", \"\\\"And that boils down in a lot of ways to helping shift the military balance away from the dominance of China.\\\"\", \"<div

associate professor at South Korea's Yonsei University \\u2013 said it would be a mistake to read too much into the defence deals being struck by South Korean defence firms.\", \"\\\"They are purely commercial. Purely commercial. It's got nothing to do with strategy, it's only got to do with commerce,\\\" he said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/21b971496bbdaed2156b7f2aacddbdaf\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Jeffrey Robertson says many South Koreans believe Australia's foreign policy mirrors that of the US.(AP Photo: Ahn Young-joon)</div>\", \"Robertson is scathing about Australia's efforts to build closer ties with South Korea. He sees too little energy and imagination, and too much wishful thinking.\", \"\\\"The relationship is still more than 10\\u00a0years behind where it should be,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"For one, it's very far away.\", \"\\\"Two,\\u00a0a lot of people here see Australia's foreign policy as just mimicking US foreign policy, so if they need to deal with an issue they just go to the US if they need to discuss something.\", \"\\\"And third, Australia hasn't invested in the relationship. It's done nothing to make Australia relevant in South Korean policy circles.\", \"Robertson is also sceptical about some of the claims of strategic convergence between Australia and South Korea, and believes Seoul will simply continue the difficult task of balancing between the US and China.\", \"In fact, he thinks Moon's visit has little to do with geopolitics, and quite a lot to do with commerce.\", \"It got relatively little attention, but one of the agreements struck by the two leaders during the visit was to \\\"develop robust and commercially viable critical minerals supply chain\\\".\", \"Australia has vast reserves that it hopes to exploit, and South Korea \\u2013 which has big plans to develop its electric-vehicle battery industry \\u2013 will have a ravenous appetite for those resources.\", \"\\\"And it's been what every other trip of South Korean presidents to Australia has been about. It's no different now.\", \"\\\"Nobody in South Korea thinks this is about China. Even the defence agreements, there is very little discussion about them here.\\\"\", \"For Robertson, what's telling is that it took so many years for Moon \\u2013 who only has three months left in office \\u2013 to actually get on a plane to Canberra.\", \"\\\"It points to the irrelevance of Australia in South Korean policy circles that this trip wasn't taken earlier in his administration,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Moon is already a lame duck.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"218f4a905cb111ec9417db5528d01439"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"218f4a905cb111ec9417db5528d01439"}},
