It makes it a lot easier for training, coaches and support staff, and all those things that I have here based in New Zealand and are a huge part of why I'm the athlete I am.\\\"\", \"Also smiling was triathlete Hayden Wilde -and not just about what the new border rules meant for his Commonwealth Games preparation.\", \"The bronze medallist from the Tokyo Olympics said he had landed one of 20 MIQ spots allocated to Sport New Zealand in December for sports stars stranded abroad.\", \"Wilde said, after nine failed attempts in the MIQ lottery, he was relieved he would finally be going home to celebrate his Olympic success with his family.\", \"\\\"I've been trying for the last four months, so at least we're moving forward.\", \"\\\"We can take this as a positive and know that we can leave and represent our country but also have the certainty that we can potentially come home.\\\"\", \"Wilde said the border changes were a big boost to his chances of repeating his Tokyo success in Birmingham next year.\", \"\\\"To race well at the Commonwealth Games, I really wanted to come home early ... to have a few weeks off and then prepare in the New Zealand summer time.\", \"\\\"It's great to have that certainty.
