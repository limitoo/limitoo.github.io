Even without a suitcase, he\\u2019s clearly hauling a lot of baggage. That much is clear as soon as he saunters up to the door of the house where his estranged wife, Lexi, lives with her mother, Lil, and their dog, Sophie.\", \"Lexi, who hasn\\u2019t seen Mikey in a while, challenges the idea that absence makes the heart grow fonder, ordering him off the property. Still, there is something about Mikey that wears down her resistance. Before long he is installed on Lil\\u2019s couch (and later, in Lexi\\u2019s bed), using their modest yellow bungalow as a base of operations as he lays siege to Texas City by bicycle.\", \"That sounds both grandiose and ridiculous, but shameless, preposterous self-aggrandizement is Mikey\\u2019s M.O. In a handful of early scenes in Sean Baker\\u2019s \\u201cRed Rocket,\\u201d we learn quite a bit about this guy, who is played with antic, uninhibited verve by the onetime MTV V.J. Simon Rex. \\u201cGoogle me,\\u201d Mikey says to potential employers and new acquaintances. What they find is evidence of a long and successful career in pornography under a suggestive pseudonym.\", \"OK, but how did he get those bruises? Why is he back in his hometown after 17 years? Why isn\\u2019t Lexi, his former co-star, happy to see him? The answers are a little hazy, but the important point, as far as Mikey is concerned, is that nothing is ever his fault.\", \"\\u201cThe universe is on my side,\\u201d he marvels a bit later, after various schemes and scams appear to be coming to fruition. His combination of shamelessness and charm has worked not only on Lexi (Bree Elrod) and Lil (Brenda Deiss), but also on a handful of other residents of the greater Texas City area: Lonnie (Ethan Darbone), a gullible, rudderless neighbor who gives him rides; Leondria (Judy Hill), a matriarchal entrepreneur who supplies him with weed; and above all Raylee (Suzanna Son), a teenage doughnut-shop employee whose nickname is Strawberry.\", \"The biases of the universe remain unknowable, but for viewers and critics the relevant questions are whether or to what extent the movie is on Mikey\\u2019s side. He puts in a lot of effort not so much to get people to like him as to persuade them to do what he wants, and \\u201cRed Rocket\\u201d invites us to witness his scams. If we fall for them, or root for them to succeed \\u2014 or, for that matter, if we recoil in disgust \\u2014 then that\\u2019s on us.\", \"You can make it through most of the film in a state of queasy, not entirely unpleasant ambivalence. Sometimes, you might be swept up in Mikey\\u2019s brazen, half-demented self-confidence. At other times, you hope for what seems like an inevitable and richly deserved comeuppance.\", \"The people he meets in the movie are similarly divided. (The mostly nonprofessional actors are good sports and decent company.) There are some who do business with him, some who have sex with him, and some who punch him, kick him, threaten him with murder or force him to run naked through the nighttime streets. These are not mutually exclusive categories.\", \"The major exceptions are Lonnie and Strawberry, both in their different ways in thrall to Mikey\\u2019s celebrity and susceptible to his charisma. Lonnie is eager for inside dirt on the porn world. Strawberry, who is 17, responds to Mikey\\u2019s flirting out of boredom and curiosity. Her interest intensifies when she finds out about his work history, and he starts to see her as a porn star in the making, his ticket back to the big time. Son, who has undeniable star potential, helps keep the story perched on the boundary between sweetness and sleaze.\", \"It\\u2019s not a great place to be. In his previous movies, Baker has observed strivers and dreamers on the margins of respectability with an eye that could be prurient and skeptical, but also compassionate. The aspiring actresses in \\u201cStarlet,\\u201d the transgender hustlers in \\u201cTangerine,\\u201d the half-feral children of \\u201cThe Florida Project\\u201d \\u2014 all of them are exposed to danger and humiliation. The movies, though, find dignity in the most abject circumstances, and bathe their characters in sometimes surprising warmth.\", \"\\u201cRed Rocket,\\u201d the nonjudgmental portrait of a narcissistic predator, is a rougher piece of work. It\\u2019s funny and abrasive, but also coy and, in the end, a bit tedious. The vivid sense of place \\u2014 you can\\u2019t fake Texas City \\u2014 is embellished with a specific time stamp. Mikey\\u2019s misadventures take place in the summer of 2016, as Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump accept the nominations of their parties and square off for November.\", \"Nobody in the movie talks about politics, but the candidates\\u2019 voices and images leak from radios and television sets, creating a hazy aura of relevance. Maybe we\\u2019re supposed to see affinities between Mikey and the eventual winner \\u2014 to ponder once again how some men get away with so much, and sort through our possible reactions of envy, admiration or disgust.\", \"Or maybe Mikey just isn\\u2019t that interesting. He may have made a name for himself via three-minute clips on the internet, but more than two hours in his company is a lot to endure.\"]","href_hash":"5db77a80591211ecac7f3b05c8d33227"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5db77a80591211ecac7f3b05c8d33227"}},
