Here is what we know.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Are scientists worried about Omicron?\\u00a0</div>\", \"Yes. Cautiously.\\u00a0\", \"There is still a lot of research that needs to be done, but scientists are alarmed by the number of changes in this variant's genetic code.\\u00a0\", \"It's normal for viruses to mutate over time, so scientists pay close attention when those changes alter how the virus behaves.\", \"Professor Edward Holmes, who studies the emergence of infectious diseases, said the fact that this variant\\u00a0is so distinct from other variants is a worry.\", \"\\\"It is definitely a serious concern,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It has mutations throughout the spike protein that might make it able to evade immune responses.\\\"\", \"Tulio de Oliveira, a bioinformatician with South Africa's Centre for Epidemic Response and Innovation, said at a public briefing that the new variant had\\u00a0a \\\"very unusual constellation of mutations\\\".\", \"He explained that scientists had picked up more than 30 changes just to the spike protein, 10\\u00a0of which could alter the part of the virus that binds to human cells.\", \"The Beta variant had three mutations to this part, and Delta just two, he said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/85edcadb71594dd83574c2df880503ac\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> South Africa is trying to increase vaccination rates, particularly in remote communities.(Reuters: Siphiwe Sibeko, File photo)</div>\", \"What's worrying about this is that vaccines \\u2014\\u00a0our best defence against COVID-19 \\u2014\\u00a0work by teaching our body to recognise and disable these parts of the virus.\", \"If they change too much, our immune systems might not notice them until it's too late and we are badly infected.\", \"As Professor Tulio de Oliveira explained, some of the changes have been seen before and scientists know how they affect the virus's behaviour, but others have only been rarely seen.\", \"\\\"So the full significance is still uncertain,\\\" he said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Where has Omicron spread so far?\\u00a0</div>\", \"On Friday afternoon, the new variant had been\\u00a0found in three countries: Botswana, South Africa and Hong Kong.\", \"But since then cases have been confirmed in other parts of the world, including Belgium and Israel.\", \"The variant was first discovered in Botswana earlier this month.\", \"In South Africa, most of the confirmed cases have been found in the Gauteng province, which takes in the cities of Johannesburg and Pretoria.\", \"However, there are indications it has spread more widely.\", \"As it happens, one of the mutations to the spike protein shows up in one of the regular tests used to diagnose COVID-19.\", \"Richard Lessells, an infectious disease physician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal, said that indicated the new strain was already turning up in other provinces across South Africa.\", \"\\\"It gives us concern that this variant may already be circulating quite widely in the country,\\\" he said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What are health authorities doing about it?\\u00a0</div>\", \"On the ground in South Africa, health authorities have urged people to continue sanitising their hands, wearing masks in public and avoiding events that could spread the virus widely.\", \"They are also working to increase vaccination rates, but apathy and hesitancy have proved a challenge.\", \"Health authorities across the world are monitoring the variant closely, and some countries have started restricting travel from several African nations.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Is this\\u00a0a COVID-19 variant of concern or a variant of interest?</div>\", \"On Saturday morning the WHO declared B.1.1.529 a \\\"variant of concern\\\" and gave it the Greek name Omicron.\", \"The WHO said the decision to give it the more serious definition was based on evidence that was \\\"indicative of a detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology\\\".\", \"\\\"Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs,\\\" the WHO said in a statement.\", \"\\\"The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa.\\\"\", \"The organisation said there was still a lot of research underway to figure out what exactly the new variant meant for managing COVID-19.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Right now, researchers are getting together to understand where these mutations are and what that potentially may mean for our diagnostics, our therapeutics and our vaccines,\\\" WHO COVID-19 technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove said on Friday.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It will take a few weeks for us to understand what impact this variant has.
