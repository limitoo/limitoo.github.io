On its website, it adds that the sickness can be very debilitating for sufferers. Clark continued: \\\"Imagine feeling sick or actually being sick, how awful that is. Now imagine feeling like that every day for weeks on end. I think all of us can empathize with that.\\\"\", \"Clark added that it is important that women suffering from HG understand that there is a good chance it will end after the first trimester, though in some cases it continues for longer.\", \"Pregnancy Sickness Support explains that it is key HG sufferers seek medical advice if they become unable to keep any food or fluids down as it is possible the condition can because them to become dehydrated very quickly.\", \"Pregnancy Sickness Support was part of a study published in Obstetric Medicine in October this year that found that of 5000 HG sufferers surveyed, almost 5 percent terminated a wanted pregnancy because of HG.\", \"Further to this, over half of the women surveyed considered terminating their pregnancy because of HG. Over a quarter of the women responded that the symptoms of HG had driven them to consider suicide. Almost 7 percent responded they had considered suicide regularly because of HG.\", \"King's College London, whose researchers helped conduct the research, wrote how one woman said she became \\\"so ill that I considered termination when I couldn't bring myself to do that, I contemplated taking my own life.\\\"\", \"Of the HG sufferers surveyed, almost 68 percent said the condition left them bed-ridden and needing daily support. Describing her decision to terminate, she said it was \\\"to avoid losing my new job and home for my first child, which I had rented after 6-months of homelessness.\\\"\", \"With regards to treatment, Clark said that sufferers of HG can be given anti-sickness medication, and in extreme circumstances could be placed on drips to replace lost fluids. In rare cases, HG sufferers can be given vitamin B1 supplements to prevent neurological problems like loss of balance and confusion.\", \"The Redditor described the effect his partner's HG had on him and his sleep. He wrote: \\\"There is a lot of twists and turns and getting up to go to the bathroom every few minutes. It absolutely destroys my sleep. I don't want to sound like an a**hole but I have to wake up early for work and because I am a sensitive sleeper I jolt awake easy with all the sudden movements.\", \"Clark says while there isn't much data about how HG affects partnerships, he said that stress and depression can have a knock-on effect on relationships. He added that partners offer more support and a little extra TLC. He added: \\\"I think emotional support, as well as practical physical support, is important.\\\"\", \"Many Reddit commenters responded to the Redditor's concern regarding sleepless nights by pointing out that the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better. One Reddit user posted a comment with almost 18,500 upvotes, saying: \\\"I can understand needing sleep to perform your best at work. But dude, you are in for a hell of a time when the baby comes\\\"\", \"Other Reddit users suggested that the poster should have moved, rather than asking his partner to move. One wrote: \\\"I would have not relocated the pregnant person but relocated myself.\\\"\", \"Some commenters added that if the couple were happy with their sleeping arrangements, others shouldn't question it. One commented: \\\"Why does it matter who moves? She doesn't mind, why should anyone else?\\\"\", \"Other posts on the thread expressed solidarity and described similar experiences. One commenter wrote: \\\"Currently have a baby and my husband moved to the guest bedroom while I was pregnant and not sleeping well. It put one less thing on me while I was already having a tough time.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950138/pregnancy-stress.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A stock image of a pregnant woman struggling to sleep.
