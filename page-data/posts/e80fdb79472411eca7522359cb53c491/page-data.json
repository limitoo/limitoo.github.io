Health Department.\", \"Private businesses are also permitted to enact their own mask mandates, the AP reported.\", \"\\\"Now, I want to be very clear,\\\" Bowser said during a briefing Tuesday. \\\"This does not mean that ... everyone needs to stop wearing their mask, but it does mean that we're shifting the government's response to providing you this risk-based information and recommending layering strategies as the best way to protect yourself and the community.\\\"\", \"Bowser explained during the briefing that the city would be continually monitoring the virus situation and would be prepared to reinstate the mask mandate if necessary.\", \"\\\"So if we need to come back to the public and say, 'We think that we need to blunt transmission,' or we see hospitalizations, or we see some other activity in the public health system, then we will come back to the public with that information. But hopefully that won't happen,\\\" Bowser said.\", \"The D.C. Health Department said in the press release that \\\"instead of following a blanket mandate,\\\" the updated rules would include risk-based guidance that takes current health metrics and vaccination statuses into consideration. The updated guidance will be posted on the D.C. government's coronavirus website in the coming days, the release said.\", \"The D.C. Health Department also urged residents to get vaccinated against the virus and encouraged \\\"all people, regardless of vaccination status, to consider their risk factors and surroundings carefully when choosing layered mitigations strategies\\\" like wearing masks and social distancing.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1933724/dc-dropping-indoor-mask-mandate.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The District of Columbia will lift its indoor mask requirement starting next week as local COVID infection cases continue to trend downward.
