Leonard, a senior researcher at the Department of Planetary Sciences at the University of Arizona, at the Mount Lemmon Observatory in Arizona, according to Space.com.\", \"Its orbit is highly eccentric, meaning that it travels around the sun in a flat oval shape rather than a circular one.\", \"As such it is thought that it travels as far as 325 billion miles away from our sun, or around 3,500 times the distance between the sun and the Earth, Space.com reported.\", \"It takes a long time to complete this orbit\\u201435,000 years either way, according to Sky and Telescope magazine.\", \"When C/2021 A1 Leonard appears close to Messier 3 this week, it will not actually be physically close to the star cluster. The comet will actually be around 3.6 light-minutes away and the star cluster 34,000 light years away, the Virtual Telescope Project notes\\u2014but they'll look close in the sky from our perspective on Earth.\", \"Comets are frozen chunks of ice, gas and rock that are leftovers from the formation of the solar system.\", \"Their orbits sometimes see them come particularly close to the sun, which causes them to heat up. When this happens, they start to spew out dust and gas that stretches away from them in a comet tail that can be millions of miles long. Rarely, a comet can be seen with the naked eye.\", \"According to NASA, the current number of known comets is 3,743. But there are likely to be billions of them orbiting our sun altogether.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943163/man-pointing-telescope-sky.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A stock photo shows a man standing with a telescope against a night sky.
