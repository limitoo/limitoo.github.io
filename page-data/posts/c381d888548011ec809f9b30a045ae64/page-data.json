It\\u2019s the most wonderful time of the year: \\u201cbest of\\u201d season, when critics of all stripes set forth their favorite books, movies, podcasts, you-name-it of the past 12 months. Everywhere you turn, there\\u2019s a list offering a wealth of new recommendations, or one affirming your own good taste or prompting your ardent disagreement, refining your sensibility. I wish everyone I know would send me a best-of list for their year, including the stuff they watched and read and listened to, but also the best advice they received, the best meals they ate, the best things they bought, the best changes they\\u2019ve made.\", \"Reggie Ugwu\\u2019s list of the best podcasts of 2021 is a good one to start with. It includes \\u201cWelcome to Your Fantasy,\\u201d the true crime series about the Chippendales dance troupe in the 1980s, as well as \\u201c9/12,\\u201d Dan Taberski\\u2019s (\\u201cMissing Richard Simmons\\u201d) podcast about how 9/11 affected American culture. (\\u201c9/12\\u201d is the #1 recommendation on Time\\u2019s list, which includes a bunch of podcasts I hadn\\u2019t heard of that sound great, as well as one that I loved and recommended a couple of months ago, \\u201cThe Just Enough Family.\\u201d Cross-referencing lists from multiple publications is an essential part of best-of season!)\", \"The Book Review\\u2019s 10 Best Books were announced this week (\\u201cIntimacies\\u201d by Katie Kitamura was already on my list; now it\\u2019s at the top). The music critics Jon Pareles, Jon Caramanica and Lindsay Zoladz have selected the best albums of the year (Olivia Rodrigo\\u2019s \\u201cSour\\u201d and Tyler, the Creator\\u2019s \\u201cCall Me if You Get Lost\\u201d are on all three lists). Eric Asimov has selected the year\\u2019s best wine books. The Well desk has a list of the best books on healthy living. You could easily pass the weekend updating your queues and holiday shopping carts with good stuff from these lists.\", \"Of course, there are lots of movies and TV shows to stream (Jane Campion\\u2019s \\u201cThe Power of the Dog,\\u201d please) and a full day of college football on Saturday. And you could make at least two of the recipes in our \\u201c24 Days of Cookies\\u201d collection (or just watch the animation of the cookies rotating hypnotically, which is its own kind of delicious entertainment).\", \"What\\u2019s on your best of 2021 list? What books, movies, shows, recipes did you love? And for that matter, what\\u2019s the best advice you received, the best change you made in your life? Write and tell us: athome@nytimes.com. Be sure to include your full name and location and we might feature your response in a future newsletter. We\\u2019re At Home and Away. We\\u2019ll read every letter sent.
