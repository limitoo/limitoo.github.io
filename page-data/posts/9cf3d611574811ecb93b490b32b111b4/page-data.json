For four decades, he has sold carrots, beans and tomatoes grown by local farmers using foreign-made chemical fertilizers and pesticides, which helped them reap bigger and richer crops from the verdant hills that ring his hometown.\", \"Then came Sri Lanka\\u2019s sudden, and disastrous, turn toward organic farming. The government campaign, ostensibly driven by health concerns, lasted only seven months. But farmers and agriculture experts blame the policy for a sharp drop in crop yields and spiraling prices that are worsening the country\\u2019s growing economic woes and leading to fears of food shortages.\", \"Prices for some foodstuffs, like rice, have risen by nearly one-third compared with a year ago, according to Sri Lanka\\u2019s central bank. The prices of vegetables like tomatoes and carrots have risen to five times their year-ago levels.\", \"\\u201cI haven\\u2019t seen times that were as bad as these,\\u201d said Mr. Somadasa, a 63-year-old father of two who sells vegetables in the small town of Horana, just outside the island nation\\u2019s capital, Colombo. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t find enough vegetables. And with the price hikes, people find it hard to buy the vegetables.\\u201d\", \"Now Sri Lanka\\u2019s government, run by members of the Rajapaksa family, is rushing to avert a crisis. Late last month, Sri Lanka\\u2019s plantation minister, Ramesh Pathirana, confirmed a partial reversal of the policy, telling the country\\u2019s Parliament that the government would be importing fertilizer necessary for tea, rubber and coconut, which make up the nation\\u2019s major agricultural exports.\", \"\\u201cWe will be importing fertilizers depending on the requirement in the country,\\u201d Mr. Pathirana told The New York Times. \\u201cSo far, we don\\u2019t have enough chemical fertilizers in the country because we didn\\u2019t import them. There is a shortage there.\\u201d\", \"Food costs are rising around the world as pandemic-related supply chain knots are slowly unsnarled and as prices rise for feedstocks like natural gas that are used to make fertilizer and other supplies. Sri Lanka added to those pressures with its own missteps.\", \"Chemical fertilizers are essential tools for modern agriculture. Still, governments and environmental groups have grown increasingly concerned about their overuse. They have been blamed for growing water pollution problems, while scientists have found increased risks of colon, kidney and stomach cancer from excessive nitrate exposure.\", \"President Gotabaya Rajapaksa cited health concerns when his government banned the importation of chemical fertilizers in April, a pledge he had initially made during his 2019 election campaign.\", \"\\u201cSustainable food systems are part of Sri Lanka\\u2019s rich sociocultural and economic heritage,\\u201d he told a United Nations summit in September. \\u201cOur more recent past, however, saw increasing use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides and weedicides that led to adverse health and environmental impacts.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Rajapaksa\\u2019s critics pointed to another reason: Sri Lanka\\u2019s dwindling reserves of money.\", \"Covid-19 lockdowns devastated Sri Lanka\\u2019s tourist industry, which generates one-tenth of the country\\u2019s economic output and provides a major source of foreign currency. The domestic currency, the rupee, has lost about one-fifth of its value, limiting Sri Lanka\\u2019s ability to purchase food and supplies abroad just as prices were rising. That added to lingering problems like its huge debt load, including on high-interest loans from Chinese state banks that required it to take out still more loans.\", \"\\u201cOur annual earnings from tourism amounting to almost $5 billion did not materialize during the last two years,\\u201d Basil Rajapaksa, the finance minister and the president\\u2019s brother, told Parliament last month. \\u201cAs a government, we acknowledge that our foreign reserves are being challenged.\\u201d\", \"As Sri Lanka\\u2019s economy struggled and global prices rose, its foreign exchange reserves shrank by about 70 percent. Shaving foreign-made fertilizer from the country\\u2019s shopping list would help stem the slide.\", \"\\u201cThe country was hit not with chronic kidney disease,\\u201d said Dr. Aruna Kulatunga, a former government adviser on primary industries and agriculture, \\u201cbut with a chronic shortage of dollars.\\u201d\", \"The push for organic farming didn\\u2019t start with Mr. Rajapaksa\\u2019s current government, nor when another brother, Mahinda Rajapaksa, currently the prime minister, was president from 2005 to 2015. Some farmers and agriculture industry officials say they are warming to the idea of reducing dependence on chemicals in farming. But the shift was too sudden for farmers who didn\\u2019t know how to work organically, said Nishan de Mel, director of Verit\\u00e9 Research, a Colombo-based analysis firm.\", \"Verit\\u00e9 found in a July survey that three-quarters of Sri Lanka\\u2019s farmers relied heavily on chemical fertilizers, while just about 10 percent cultivated without them. Almost all major crops grown in the country depend on the chemicals. For crops crucial to the economy like rice, rubber and tea, the dependence reaches 90 percent or more.\", \"The April ban went into effect just before what is known as the Yala planting season, which lasts from May to August, and was felt almost immediately. The Verit\\u00e9 survey showed that 85 percent of farmers expected a reduction in their harvest because of the fertilizer ban. Half of them feared that their crop yield could fall by as much as 40 percent.\", \"Food prices shot up in September, and people formed lines outside shops for basic items such as milk powder and kerosene. Mr. Rajapaksa declared a state of emergency to regulate prices and prevent the hoarding of essential items. The government also introduced import restrictions on nonessential items in hopes of dealing with the dwindling foreign exchange.\", \"Now that the government is easing the policy, it isn\\u2019t clear whether Sri Lanka\\u2019s farmers will get their needed fertilizer in time. The Maha planting season runs from September to March.\", \"\\u201cThe damage is so much in agriculture and agriculture-related exports,\\u201d said W. A. Wijewardena, a former deputy governor of Sri Lanka\\u2019s central bank, \\u201cthat it will take some time for the country to recover.\\u201d\", \"It also isn\\u2019t clear whether the government will continue to subsidize fertilizer, which made it more affordable for poorer farmers. Lalith Obeyesekere, the secretary-general of the Planters\\u2019 Association of Ceylon, said the price for a ton of urea \\u2014 one type of fertilizer \\u2014 had gone up in the global market so much that farmers would be paying five times what it once cost unless the government helped with subsidies.\", \"\\u201cWe know the government has decided on importing chemical fertilizers,\\u201d Mr. Obeyesekere said. \\u201cBut now we will not get fertilizers at a subsidized price.\\u201d\", \"Tea planters, some of whom had feared that the harvest could shrink by as much as 40 percent, said they still hoped that subsidized fertilizer would arrive in time. Tea makes up about 10 percent of Sri Lanka\\u2019s total exports, bringing in about $1.2 billion a year.\", \"Many of the tea planters and tea factory managers asked for anonymity, fearing they would anger the government at a vulnerable moment. One manager said tea production had dropped by 40 percent. He said there was simply not enough organic fertilizer in the country to replace the chemical fertilizers.\", \"\\u201cI used to pluck around 35 kilos of tea leaves a week, but now for about a year we pluck less than 25 kilos a week,\\u201d said R. Muniandi, a tea plucker in Ratnapura, a southwestern city. \\u201cI can see that the harvest is gradually reducing.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9cf3d611574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9cf3d611574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}},
