There's no such thing as a safe ecstasy or a safe dose of some of the other drugs that may in time be able to be tested. That's, in effect, what the coroner has said very recently,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I say drugs aren't just a health issue. Yes, they are a health issue, but they're also ... a criminal justice issue, because of the harm they cause, the misery they cause.\", \"\\\"Andrew Little in particular, when he first came to this House, he said it would just be for festivals. It then grew and it was pill testing everywhere that we're legalising. It then became that actually not only are we testing the pills but the taxpayer is going to pay for it everywhere.\\\"\", \"NZ Drug Foundation executive director Sarah Helm however said the law was the most significant advance in the area since the creation of needle exchanges in the late 1980s.\", \"\\\"Many of our communities most at risk of overdose would hugely benefit from this health service, like people who use injected drugs and people who are homeless. This health service shouldn't just be for festivalgoers.\\\"\", \"\\\"We would like to see more widespread availability of drug checking through needle exchanges and social services as soon as possible - in the next year.\\\"\", \"Little said the law was about keeping people safe.\", \"\\\"The drug-checking services we have had running have detected and intercepted potentially deadly substances circulating in the community.\", \"\\\"Last summer, 40 percent of the MDMA that was tested turned out to be eutylone, a potentially dangerous synthetic cathinone also known as bath salts and linked to deaths and hospitalisations.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"862691644cff11ec81b9f169a792cd27"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"862691644cff11ec81b9f169a792cd27"}},
