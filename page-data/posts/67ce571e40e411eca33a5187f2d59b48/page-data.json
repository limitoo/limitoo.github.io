He was still so stiff that he refused a plastic chair the school administrators offered him.\", \"P.S. 40, in the Gramercy neighborhood, was another of a dozen New York City schools swamped with demand Monday morning as the city rolled out its weeklong effort to bring a half-day vaccine clinic to each of its more than 1,000 schools that serve elementary aged students.\", \"City officials acknowledged that they were caught off-guard by the demand at those schools, which far exceeded the interest last spring at school-based vaccine clinics for teenagers. They pledged to return to any school where children were turned away for lack of supply.\", \"\\u201cWe laid in supply and staffing for the amount of demand we expected,\\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a morning news briefing. \\u201cIf we\\u2019re seeing more demand, well, that\\u2019s a good thing, but we got to catch up with it quickly.\\u201d\", \"Officials said that most of the clinics, which took place at over 200 schools on Monday, went smoothly. Mr. de Blasio noted that the clinics with overwhelming demand were in Districts 1 and 2 in Manhattan and District 15 in Brooklyn: among the city\\u2019s wealthiest districts, in areas that have high vaccination rates among adults.\", \"Four clinics also had delays in getting their supplies Monday morning, Mr. de Blasio said. The P.S. 40 clinic finally opened at 11:24 a.m. to a round of relieved cheers, instead of at 7 a.m. as scheduled. Most children had elected to wait in class, rather than stand outside with their parents.\", \"At P.S. 19 in the East Village, the city invited the media to watch as five students got vaccinated. Ranging from 5 to 10 years old, the children were mostly calm as the needles slid into their arms. One student, Mason Lawrence, 9, turned his head away and leaned into his father. But as soon as it was over, he flashed two thumbs up high in the air.\", \"\\u201cI got the shot!\\u201d cheered Indiana Chang, age 5. The needle only hurt a little, she added. \\u201cThat wasn\\u2019t so bad.\\u201d\", \"Mr. de Blasio was supposed to turn up at P.S. 19, so some of the children had written handmade cards for him. He didn\\u2019t come in the end. A spokeswoman said there was a \\u201cscheduling conflict\\u201d and that the cards would be hand delivered to him. The schools chancellor and health commissioner were there.\", \"Other schools saw far less demand. At P.S. 21 in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, parents leaving the clinic reported smooth operations, with about eight children waiting inside about two hours into the afternoon clinic. There were no lines on the street.\", \"And at nearby P.S. 5, also in Bedford-Stuyvesant, all was quiet when Candace Floyd, 36, brought her son Jeremiah Augustine, 10, to get vaccinated on Monday afternoon. There were about four other children inside when they arrived, she said, but when they left only two remained. She and her son were \\u201cin and out,\\u201d she said.\", \"In the Brooklyn ZIP code where P.S. 21 and P.S. 5 are located, only 50 percent of residents are fully vaccinated, compared with 78 percent in the Manhattan neighborhood around P.S. 40. The schools also differ in economic need: More than 80 percent of children at P.S. 21 and P.S. 5 are considered in need, according to city statistics, compared with 12 percent at P.S. 40.\", \"Ms. Floyd said that Jeremiah and his classmates have already had to quarantine twice since the beginning of the school year because of exposure to the virus. Her son is likely the first in his class to get the vaccine, she said, but she thinks other parents will follow suit.\", \"Jeremiah was in good spirits as he requested some Gatorade from his mother. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a relief,\\u201d she said.\"]","href_hash":"67ce571e40e411eca33a5187f2d59b48"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"67ce571e40e411eca33a5187f2d59b48"}},
