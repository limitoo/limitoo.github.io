He was stabbed multiple times in the head. Rogers' body was discovered along an overpass on Interstate 95 the following day.\", \"\\\"This appears to be a completely random act. We do not have a motive,\\\" Shannon said. \\\"I would best describe it as an innocent child victim having a chance encounter with a very violent criminal.\\\"\", \"According to court records, a bandana that had Rogers' blood on it was found inside Williams' backpack. Williams, who was arrested in Miami Wednesday, denied having ever been with Rogers.\", \"The records also show that a pair of headphones present at the scene had Williams' DNA on them.\", \"Williams reportedly had a history of committing random acts of violence. Court records show that he pleaded guilty to an attack in Atlanta in 2014 for aggravated assault-strangulation and battery on a person 65 or older.\", \"Williams spent four years in jail and a mental hospital for the incident.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944487/palm-beach-florida-murder.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">This photo provided by Palm Beach County Sheriff\\u2019s Office shows Semmie Lee Williams.

Williams threw the victim into a ravine, leaving him with a permanent arm injury, and ran away. Williams was arrested after a short search of the area.\", \"The victim said that he asked Williams during the attack if he wanted money.\", \"\\\"He said no. He knows my kind and he is going to finish me,\\\" the victim told Judge Thomas A. Cox Jr. \\\"I'm lucky to be alive. The intent was to kill me.\\\"\", \"Williams had served four years in jail and a mental hospital. Prosecutors wanted an additional year, but Cox said that since Williams had no prior felony convictions, he would be sentenced to time served and released that day. Cox ordered Williams to leave Georgia immediately upon release and travel by bus to central Florida to live with his mother, who had agreed to care for him. He was to serve five years probation in Florida.\", \"The Atlanta victim did not immediately return a call seeking comment. The Associated Press is not naming him to protect his privacy.\", \"Williams also has arrests in the mid-2000s in central Florida for various misdemeanor charges including domestic violence, resisting arrest without violence, petty theft and carrying a concealed electronic weapon.
