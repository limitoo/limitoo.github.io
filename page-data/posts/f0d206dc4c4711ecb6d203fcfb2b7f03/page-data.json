(It will also be recorded as an Audible Original.) \\u201cI\\u2019m evangelical about the Upper West Side.\\u201d\", \"She could probably learn to warble hosannas about other parts of town \\u2014 yes, Ms. Salie can sing, too \\u2014 but since moving to Manhattan from Los Angeles in 2006 to be the host of the short-lived news-and-entertainment radio show \\u201cFair Game,\\u201d she has lived exclusively in a square-mile-and-a-half area bordered by Central Park West and Broadway.\", \"Occupation: journalist, performer, author\", \"Manhattan matriculation: \\u201cA friend told me, \\u2018You are so lucky to live in this apartment, because when you live in New York it\\u2019s like you\\u2019re at university, and the whole city is your campus and your home is your dorm.\\u2019 I try to remember that.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWhen I came here, I was separated from my wasband, which is what I call my first husband,\\u201d Ms. Salie said. \\u201cAnd over a period of four years, I sublet three furnished apartments. That was my journey until I met my second husband,\\u201d she said, referring to John Semel, an education technology executive, whom she married in 2011.\", \"\\u201cI felt some sort of comfort in the transience of the places I was living,\\u201d Ms. Salie continued. \\u201cI was actually relieved, because I didn\\u2019t feel settled personally. I had so many questions: When is my divorce going to come through? Am I going to marry again? Will I ever become a mother? How will I become a mother on my own?\\u201d\", \"There was one question she didn\\u2019t have to answer, she said: \\u201cWhat kind of furniture do you want? The furniture I want is whatever is here.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Salie was pregnant at her wedding, something she loves to mention because, she said, it makes her sound modern. Thus, there was some urgency to finding a rental in her preferred neighborhood and settling in before baby Augustus, now 9, was born. (Daughter Minerva followed two years later.)\", \"\\u201cJohn had always lived on the Upper East Side,\\u201d Ms. Salie said. \\u201cAnd he always tells me, \\u2018You were adamant about staying on the Upper West Side, and I was adamant about staying married to you.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Besides being a good guy, Mr. Semel is good with spreadsheets. He laid out all the possibilities and found the right place: a two-bedroom with nice light and a terrace. Also, fortunately, he came to the union with some \\u201cgrown-up man\\u201d furniture \\u201cthat he was very proud of,\\u201d Ms. Salie said.\", \"The haul included a Minotti sofa, a Ligne Roset glass-fronted curio cabinet that was a floor model, a Ligne Roset dining table and chairs, and a pair of Charles Pollock chairs, along with an Eileen Gray marble-topped coffee table that had been in Mr. Semel\\u2019s childhood home.\", \"\\u201cJohn\\u2019s furniture was just fine,\\u201d Ms. Salie said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not my taste, but I don\\u2019t know that I have such fully formed taste that I can articulate what my taste actually is. When you\\u2019re renting and when you have kids, there are many times when you say, \\u2018It\\u2019s fine.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"To be sure, many things here are a good deal more than fine to Ms. Salie. They tend to be pieces from her travels with Mr. Semel: two rugs and a fanciful painting from the Medina in Fez; a Berber door, also from Morocco, that sits atop the credenza in the entryway; cushions from Paris, London, Venice and Hong Kong that line the sofa; and a large cloth napkin from a restaurant in Florence, Italy, that hangs over Minerva\\u2019s bed.\", \"\\u201cThe chef heard that we were on our honeymoon,\\u201d Ms. Salie recalled, \\u201cand he came out from the kitchen with a box of markers and made the most whimsical drawing on the napkin, put his hand in John\\u2019s espresso and threw some on the picture, then brought out some limoncello and sprinkled that on the picture.\\u201d\", \"But Ms. Salie seems to derive the greatest pleasure from the furniture and objects that speak to the discreet charms of family life: the purple recliner in the bedroom that she sat in to nurse her children; the artwork taped or pushpinned to a wall in the dining nook; the battery of Legos; the picture books arrayed on a library-style cart in the living room; the photos and magnetic alphabet letters affixed to the refrigerator; Augustus\\u2019s stuffed animals gathered on a section of his bed that Minerva, 7, calls \\u201cthe dairy-o\\u201d (perhaps a reference to \\u201cThe Farmer in the Dell,\\u201d but no one in the family is certain).\", \"The blessed patch of fresh air otherwise known as the terrace is where Mr. Semel smokes one of the more than 300 pipes in his collection, where he and Ms. Salie snap the children\\u2019s first-day-of-the-school-year photos and where they gathered every evening during the height of the pandemic to cheer for frontline workers.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a very emotional place,\\u201d Ms. Salie said.\", \"When she and Mr. Semel moved into the apartment, the space seemed ample. Ten years on, they\\u2019re bursting at the seams. It helps some that Ms. Salie has rented a one-bedroom unit a floor below to use as an office and as a studio where she records her podcasts.\", \"When she is feeling most frustrated \\u2014 perhaps she has just stepped on an errant Lego piece or is futilely trying to make room on a wall for her children\\u2019s latest masterpieces \\u2014 she quickly regroups.\", \"\\u201cI think, \\u2018You know what? If I were a set designer for a play and I wanted to show a house that was fun and not too fancy and a place of joy with parents who treasured their children, what would it look like?\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Salie said. \\u201cAnd I think it would probably look just like our messy apartment.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f0d206dc4c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f0d206dc4c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}},
