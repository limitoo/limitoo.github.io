He was 80.\", \"Rilla Fleming, his partner, said the cause was metastatic cancer.\", \"The Moody Blues first gained attention as part of the British Invasion that dominated the American rock scene in the mid-1960s. Their repertoire originally consisted largely of R&B covers, but by their second album, \\u201cDays of Future Passed\\u201d (1967), they had developed the blend of orchestral and rock music that would make them famous.\", \"\\u201cIn the late 1960s we became the group that Graeme always wanted it to be, and he was called upon to be a poet as well as a drummer,\\u201d Justin Hayward, the band\\u2019s lead singer, wrote in a statement on the Moody Blues website after Mr. Edge\\u2019s death. \\u201cHe delivered that beautifully and brilliantly, while creating an atmosphere and setting that the music would never have achieved without his words.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Edge\\u2019s mesmerizing drumming and introspective poetry were a big part of the group\\u2019s success. The Moody Blues are probably best remembered for \\u201cNights in White Satin\\u201d (1967), a darkly ruminative song that ends, in the original album version, with \\u201cLate Lament,\\u201d written by Mr. Edge and read by the keyboardist Mike Pinder. (It was missing from the shorter version released for radio.)\", \"Though Mr. Pinder\\u2019s sonorous baritone and the poem\\u2019s opening lines \\u2014 \\u201cBreathe deep the gathering gloom\\u201d \\u2014 make the poem sound melancholy, even foreboding, it was meant to be uplifting, Mr. Edge said.\", \"\\u201cI think it\\u2019s the joy, the spirit that makes it,\\u201d he said in an interview with Rolling Stone in 2018. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a young boy discovering that he loves somebody for the first time, and he just wants to shout it out from the hills \\u2014 and shout it out again!\\u201d\", \"\\u201cNights in White Satin\\u201d was not originally a hit, but it reached the Top 10 when it was rereleased in 1972. (Their only other Top 10 singles were their first hit, \\u201cGo Now!,\\u201d in 1964, and the up-tempo \\u201cYour Wildest Dreams\\u201d in 1986.) It came to be regarded as a musical landmark \\u2014 one of the first to emerge from the burgeoning prog-rock movement, which also included bands like Pink Floyd, Genesis and Emerson, Lake & Palmer.\", \"The Moody Blues had other hits in the late 1960s and early \\u201970s, including \\u201cTuesday Afternoon,\\u201d \\u201cI\\u2019m Just a Singer (in a Rock and Roll Band)\\u201d and \\u201cRide My See-Saw,\\u201d before going on hiatus from 1974 to 1977. During that time, Mr. Edge sailed around the world in his 70-foot yacht and released several solo albums.\", \"The band found a second wind in the 1980s, when it set aside its prog-rock past and embraced a synthesizer-driven pop sound. They released their last album, \\u201cDecember,\\u201d in 2003, but continued to tour regularly afterward.\", \"\\u201cI never get tired of playing the hits,\\u201d Mr. Edge told The Sarasota Herald-Tribune in 2008. \\u201cYou have a duty. You play \\u2018Nights in White Satin\\u2019 for them. You\\u2019ve got to play \\u2018I\\u2019m Just a Singer (in a Rock and Roll Band),\\u2019 and you\\u2019ve got to play \\u2018Tuesday Afternoon\\u2019 and you\\u2019ve got to play \\u2018Question.\\u2019 It\\u2019s your duty, and their right.\\u201d\", \"Graeme Charles Edge was born on March 30, 1941, in Rochester, a city in southeastern England. When he was 3 his family moved to Birmingham, where he grew up.\", \"He came from a musical family: His mother, a classically trained pianist, worked in a movie theater playing the accompaniment to silent films, and his father was a music-hall singer, as were his paternal grandfather and great-grandfather.\", \"Mr. Edge\\u2019s two marriages ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Fleming, he is survived by his daughter, Samantha Edge; his son, Matthew; and five grandchildren.\", \"When he was about 10, he heard Bill Haley and the Comets\\u2019 \\u201cTen Little Indians\\u201d on the radio and immediately fell in love with rock \\u2019n\\u2019 roll. Though he trained to be a draftsman, his first job was managing an R&B band in Birmingham.\", \"When that band's drummer quit unexpectedly, Mr. Edge was hired as a temporary replacement. He had never played drums before, but he learned quickly, and when the band hired another drummer, he bought his own kit and decided to become a musician.\", \"He founded and played in several bands before he and four other musicians \\u2014 Denny Laine, Ray Thomas, Clint Warwick and Mr. Pinder \\u2014 formed the MB Five in 1964. They soon renamed themselves the Moody Blues.\", \"Their first hit was \\u201cGo Now!\\u201d a cover of an R&B song originally recorded by Bessie Banks. But Mr. Edge worried that playing other people\\u2019s songs would take them only so far. After Mr. Laine and Mr. Warwick left and Mr. Hayward and John Lodge joined, the band decided to take a new approach.\", \"They were big admirers of the Beatles\\u2019 use of an orchestra on some of their songs, and they decided to develop a sound that blended rock with classical instrumentation. Though they later recorded and toured with an orchestra, their first efforts employed a mellotron, an analog antecedent to the electronic synthesizer.\", \"The resulting sweep of strings and horns that played through their songs, along with Mr. Edge\\u2019s poetry, gave the Moody Blues a reputation as a thinking person\\u2019s rock band, among the earliest exponents of what came to be called art-rock.\", \"\\u201cWe used to think that we were aiming at the head and the heart, rather than the groin,\\u201d Mr. Edge told The South Bend Tribune in Indiana in 2006.\", \"The Moody Blues have sold more than 70 million albums and in 2018 were inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland. Fittingly for a song from a band once known for its covers, \\u201cNights in White Satin\\u201d has been covered more than 140 times.\", \"Clint Warwick died in 2004. Ray Thomas died in 2018.\", \"Mr. Edge suffered a stroke in 2016 and retired from touring in 2019, but he remained an official member of the band until his death \\u2014 the only remaining member of the original quintet, formed almost 60 years earlier.\"]","href_hash":"9f0e4009441e11ec856083d4d35ec62f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9f0e4009441e11ec856083d4d35ec62f"}},
