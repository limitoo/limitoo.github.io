Hundreds still remain in jail, according to analysis by civil rights group Cubalex.\", \"Demonstrators have long called for an end to the communist regime.\", \"Miguel D\\u00edaz-Canel, who heads the Cuban Communist Party, has banned the public protests, arguing that they are part of a U.S.-backed destabilization campaign and an attempt to overthrow the regime.
