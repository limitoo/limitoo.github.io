hurtling\\u00a0around a nearby star like a cannonball.\", \"The rocky planet, which lies about 30 light-years away in the constellation of Vela, is about three quarters of the size of Earth\\u00a0and half as massive.\", \"Dubbed GJ 367 b, the little world\\u00a0takes less than eight\\u00a0hours to orbit a red dwarf star half the size of our Sun.\\u00a0\", \"It's the smallest fast-moving planet that we've got the\\u00a0precise measurements of, said Kristine Lam of\\u00a0the German Aerospace Center, who led the international team that made the discovery.\", \"\\\"This is a unique object with a short orbital period and a high density,\\\" Dr Lam said.\", \"While it may not be the densest exoplanet ever discovered, her team's measurements, reported in the journal\\u00a0Science, indicate it is denser than any rocky planet in\\u00a0our Solar System.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Its high density suggests the planet is\\u00a0dominated by an iron-rich core, like Mercury.\", \"<div

hard to detect.\", \"\\\"This discovery paves the way for future exoplanet scientists to find smaller and smaller planets, hopefully like\\u00a0something in our Solar System, or something completely different,\\\" Dr Lam said.\", \"The first hint\\u00a0of this extraordinary planet came as\\u00a0dips in light around a star detected by NASA's\\u00a0Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite\\u00a0(TESS) in 2019.\\u00a0\", \"Fleeting winks of light created by the planet passing in front of the star\\u00a0gave the scientists an indication of the planet's radius.\", \"\\\"To confirm this signal was a planet, we needed to go through\\u00a0a lot of rigorous ground-based follow up observations in order to check whether this was\\u00a0real,\\\" Dr Lam said.\", \"<img

Exoplanet\\u00a0Survey Satellite (TESS), but it took two years to confirm.(Supplied: MIT )</div>\", \"The team used\\u00a0the\\u00a0High Accuracy Radial Velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) in Chile to measure how much the star wobbled back and forth to work\\u00a0out the planet's mass.\", \"The ability to measure the mass of such a small planet with such precision was an \\\"incredible achievement,\\\" said Jonti Horner, an exoplanet hunter at the University of Southern Queensland who was not involved in the study.\", \"\\\"That we can measure this star\\u00a0that is 290 trillion kilometres away, and we can measure the speed with the precision of 80 centimetres per second to detect this planet, is astonishing,\\\" Professor Horner said.\", \"\\\"[The star's wobble] is almost slower than walking pace.\\\"\", \"The team calculated the planet's density\\u00a0by combining the radius with the mass.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">A bigger version of Mercury?</div>\", \"Professor

young, which stripped off most of its outer layers.\", \"\\\"Mercury was initially twice as big it is today, and that collision stripped away the mantle and the crust, leaving just a core and a little bit of rubble on top,\\\" Professor Horner\\u00a0said.\", \"Temperatures on Mercury can reach up to 178 degrees Celsius, but that's a\\u00a0walk in the park compared with the newly found planet.\", \"Ripping around at speeds of\\u00a0about 240 kilometres per second,\\u00a0it is much closer to its red dwarf star than Mercury, which takes 88 days to go around our Sun.\", \"\\\"It's so close to the star that\\u00a0any atmosphere that it's got would have been stripped away,\\\" Professor Horner said.\", \"The lack of atmosphere would contribute to GJ 367b's apparent\\u00a0density.\", \"It also means temperatures on the planet\\u00a0are predicted to reach up to 1,500 degrees Celsius \\u2014\\u00a0hot enough to melt iron.\", \"And it's\\u00a0probably locked in position with one side\\u00a0permanently\\u00a0facing\\u00a0its star, while the other\\u00a0is exposed to the vacuum of space and has no light coming in.\", \"\\\"You can imagine this little rocky world that is baked
