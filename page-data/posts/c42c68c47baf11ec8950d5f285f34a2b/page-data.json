About 20 percent got conflicting information about vaccination and 16 percent got information discouraging it.\", \"The source and type of information fathers received was important and had a bearing on the likelihood of a child getting timely vaccinations, the research found.\", \"University of Auckland Faculty of Medical and Health Sciences lecturer Catherine Gilchrist said fathers can play a strong role in influencing a mothers' health decisions during pregnancy.\", \"\\\"We also know that educational interventions which target fathers can improve infant outcomes and influence the mother's choices so it's important that we understand the sort of information fathers are receiving about vaccination and what their responses are,\\\" she said.\", \"Information provided by family, friends and the media was more likely to be discouraging of vaccination than information provided by healthcare sources.\", \"The infants of fathers who received conflicting or discouraging information about vaccination were less likely to have all their vaccinations on time, Dr Gilchrist said.\", \"Further to that, the infants of M\\u0101ori fathers were less likely to receive all of their vaccinations on time, compared with the infants of P\\u0101keh\\u0101 fathers, she said.\", \"Including both parents in conversations with health providers during pregnancy could improve immunisation uptake, Dr Gilchrist said.\", \"\\\"Antenatal appointments provide an ideal opportunity for both parents to receive accurate vaccination information from a trustworthy source. Midwives and Lead Maternity Carers should consider engaging fathers during perinatal care as an important part of their role.\\\"\", \"More work could also be done to engage with M\\u0101ori fathers to increase vaccination rates for M\\u0101ori infants, Dr Gilchrist said.\", \"In 2019, only 63 percent of M\\u0101ori infants were fully vaccinated at six months compared with 84 percent of P\\u0101keh\\u0101 infants, 76 percent of Pacific infants, and 91 percent of Asian infants.\", \"\\\"The wider wh\\u0101nau is often important in immunisation decisions for M\\u0101ori, so including fathers and the wh\\u0101nau in antenatal care to provide accurate vaccination information could help to address concerns and potentially improve infant vaccination uptake,\\\" Dr Gilchrist said.\", \"RNZ\"]","href_hash":"c42c68c47baf11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c42c68c47baf11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
