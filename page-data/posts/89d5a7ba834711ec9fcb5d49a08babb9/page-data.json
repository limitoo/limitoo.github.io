May started skiing at 27, on a bunny slope, holding onto a guide\\u2019s poles \\u2014 in what he calls \\u201chorse and buggy style.\\u201d Within days, he was unattached and following his guide\\u2019s voice down the hill. \\u201cIt was extremely liberating,\\u201d says May, who went on to win multiple medals in the world competitions now known as the Paralympics, and hit 65 miles per hour to set the world record for speed skiing by a completely blind skier.\", \"Call the resort to find out what kind of programs it offers. \\u201cIt shouldn\\u2019t cost you more to ski than it costs a sighted person,\\u201d says May, who suggests using only guides who lead rather than follow you. You want a skilled skier with a loud voice. Once on the trail, keep four to 15 feet between you and your guide. A good guide will use cadence to indicate spatial directions; a long turn might sound like \\u201cTuuuuurn left. Gooo, gooo. \\u2026 \\u201d Listen for other noises too: A blip in your guide\\u2019s voice might mean a bump ahead; if their skis start scraping, prepare for ice; sudden quiet indicates powder. Avoid using radios or walkie-talkies, which won\\u2019t give you the same directional cues.\", \"Always wear a brightly colored bib that identifies you as a blind skier in boldface type (your guide should wear one that says \\u201cGuide\\u201d). Still, don\\u2019t assume others will take in its meaning; May thinks that fewer than 50 percent do. \\u201cThey just see \\u2018Guide\\u2019 and ask for directions, like, \\u2018Where\\u2019s the bathroom?\\u2019\\u201d he says. The biggest obstacle for blind skiers is often transportation to the mountain. In college, May sometimes hitchhiked from Davis, Calif., to the Sierra Nevadas, hours away. He doesn\\u2019t recommend it. \\u201cHitchhiking with a seeing-eye dog and your ski gear is not a simple task,\\u201d he says.\", \"Ski lifts can be tricky, but you can always ask the operator to slow the lift down if you feel nervous. At the top of the run, ask your guide to give you a play-by-play so you know what\\u2019s coming. \\u201cI always like to take the same run over and over again,\\u201d May says. \\u201cThat way I get a mental picture and can start to relax and really open up to the experience.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"89d5a7ba834711ec9fcb5d49a08babb9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"89d5a7ba834711ec9fcb5d49a08babb9"}},
