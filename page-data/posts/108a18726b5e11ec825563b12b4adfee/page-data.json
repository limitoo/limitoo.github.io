Giuffre's lawyer say she lives in Colorado. But Judge Lewis A. Kaplan on Friday noted that Prince Andrew's lawyers have \\\"not actually raised\\\" the potential defense that Giuffre lives outside the U.S. Kaplan also told the prince's lawyers they must turn over documents by the previously approved deadline.\", \"Kaplan wroter that Brettler has put in a \\\"comprehensive request for documents\\\" relating to where Giuffre lives to be turned over by January 14.
