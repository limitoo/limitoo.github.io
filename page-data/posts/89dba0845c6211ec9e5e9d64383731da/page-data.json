With so many players unavailable, the Bulls faced the prospect of not being able to field enough healthy players to take the floor.\", \"This marks the first postponement of an N.B.A. game this season and a reminder of the coronavirus pandemic\\u2019s continuing prevalence. Players enter the protocols when they test positive for the coronavirus or if they are possibly exposed to someone who has. Once players are in the protocols, they must quarantine for 10 days or until they have two negative P.C.R. test results at least 24 hours a part.\", \"The league has seen a striking uptick in the number of players in protocols since increasing testing, even among vaccinated players, after Thanksgiving. Last week, the Indiana Pacers and Raptors separately canceled a practice out of what both teams said was \\u201can abundance of caution.\\u201d\", \"Other teams affected by the recent upward swing in cases include the Charlotte Hornets, who had five players listed in protocols last week. On Monday, the team named only two, including their top player, LaMelo Ball.\", \"Once players are in the protocols, they must quarantine for 10 days or until they have two negative P.C.R. test results at least 24 hours a part. Before the season, Arturas Karnisovas, the executive vice president of the Bulls, said the team was \\u201cgetting pretty close\\u201d to being fully vaccinated. The league and team did not immediately respond to an inquiry from a reporter about whether all the Bulls players had received the Covid-19 vaccine.\", \"Last season, the pandemic disrupted the N.B.A. right from the start, with dozens of games postponed throughout the season, mostly in January. Only three teams did not have a game postponed: the Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers and the Nets.\", \"Chicago\\u2019s next scheduled game is tentatively scheduled for Sunday, when the Bulls host the Lakers. As of Monday, the Bulls were 17-10, and, ranked third in the Eastern Conference, were in the midst of a surprisingly strong start to the season. In the off-season, they added the four-time All-Star guard DeMar DeRozan; guard Lonzo Ball, who had been with the New Orleans Pelicans; and guard Alex Caruso, who had been with the Lakers. DeRozan has missed the past three games because he was in the protocols.\"]","href_hash":"89dba0845c6211ec9e5e9d64383731da"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"89dba0845c6211ec9e5e9d64383731da"}},
