Austin III is expected on Wednesday to make his first public comments about a U.S. airstrike in Syria in 2019 that killed dozens of women and children, Pentagon officials said.\", \"Mr. Austin, who became secretary earlier this year after the Biden administration began, received a briefing on Tuesday about the strike and the military\\u2019s handling of it from Gen. Kenneth F. McKenzie Jr., the head of the military\\u2019s Central Command, which oversaw the air war in Syria. The Pentagon has scheduled a news conference for 2:30 p.m.\", \"The defense secretary requested the briefing after reading an investigative report published over the weekend by The New York Times detailing the strike and allegations that top officers and civilian officials had sought to conceal the casualties.\", \"On Monday, John F. Kirby, the Pentagon\\u2019s top spokesman, declined to comment on details of the strike, a bombing at Baghuz, Syria, on March 18, 2019, that was part of the final battle against Islamic State fighters in a remnant of a once-sprawling religious state across Iraq and Syria. It was one of the largest civilian casualty incidents of the yearslong war against ISIS but had never been publicly acknowledged by the U.S. military.\", \"Several options are available to Mr. Austin. He could order a new investigation into the strike, which was carried out by a shadowy, classified Special Operations unit called Task Force 9, as well as into the handling of the task force\\u2019s investigation into the strike by higher military headquarters and the Defense Department inspector general. He also could endorse the task force\\u2019s findings and General McKenzie\\u2019s review of the incident.\", \"The task force investigated the strike afterward and acknowledged that four civilians were killed, but also concluded there had been no wrongdoing in the unit. In October 2019, the task force sent its findings to the military headquarters in Baghdad, as well as to the Central Command headquarters in Tampa., Fla.\", \"But the command in Baghdad failed to review and close out the inquiry, and Central Command did not follow up and remind the Baghdad command to do so, Capt. Bill Urban, the Central Command spokesman, said on Wednesday before Mr. Austin\\u2019s briefing.\", \"As a result, senior military officials in Iraq or Florida never reviewed the incident, and the investigation technically remained an open case until the Times investigation.\", \"\\u201cShould we have followed up? Yes,\\u201d Captain Urban said in a telephone interview, blaming the mishap on \\u201can administrative oversight.\\u201d\", \"The Times investigation showed that the death toll from the strike, which killed an estimated 80 people, was almost immediately apparent to military officials. A legal officer flagged the bombing as a possible war crime that required an investigation. But at nearly every step, the military made moves that concealed the catastrophic strike. The Defense Department\\u2019s independent inspector general began an inquiry, but the report containing its findings was stalled and stripped of any mention of the strike.\", \"In an email to the Senate Armed Services Committee this spring, the legal officer who witnessed the strike warned that \\u201csenior ranking U.S. military officials intentionally and systematically circumvented the deliberate strike process,\\u201d and that there was a good chance that \\u201cthe highest levels of government remained unaware of what was happening on the ground.\\u201d\", \"The Times investigation found that the bombing by Air Force F-15 attack jets had been called in by Task Force 9, made up largely of the U.S. Army\\u2019s elite Delta Force. The task force was in charge of ground operations in Syria. Military sources who spoke to The Times said the secretive task force circumvented oversight by claiming the vast majority of its strikes required immediate action to protect allied troops from imminent threat. Often, military officers said, no imminent threat was present.\", \"Last week, after The Times sent its findings to U.S. Central Command, the command acknowledged the attack for the first time. In a statement it said that the 80 deaths were justified because the task force had launched a self-defense strike against a group of fighters who were an imminent threat to allied forces on the ground.\", \"Central Command told The Times that the strike had included three guided bombs: a 500-pound bomb that hit the initial group and two 2,000-pound bombs that targeted the people fleeing the initial blast. This week the command corrected itself, saying all three bombs were 500-pound munitions.\", \"The command said the three strikes killed 16 fighters and four civilians. As for the other 60 people killed, the statement said it was not clear that they were civilians, in part because women and children in the Islamic State sometimes took up arms.\", \"Human rights advocates expressed outrage this week at the strike and the military\\u2019s handling of it, and demanded that Congress open an independent investigation.\", \"\\u201cClearly, the U.S. military isn\\u2019t going to fix it,\\u201d said Sarah Holewinski, the Washington director of Human Rights Watch and a former senior adviser on human rights to the military\\u2019s Joint Staff. \\u201cThe Pentagon has never prioritized civilian harm. Ever. I\\u2019m tired of that talking point.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b9b1966047c711ecb217b5dd766e38fe"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b9b1966047c711ecb217b5dd766e38fe"}},
