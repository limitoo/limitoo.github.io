We want to help by taking one thing off your plate. We\\u2019ve gone through Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime Video and Disney+ to find the best titles that are suitable for the entire family.\", \"\\u2018Hugo\\u2019\", \"A film directed by the maker of such violence- and profanity-laden classics as \\u201cTaxi Driver,\\u201d \\u201cRaging Bull,\\u201d and \\u201cGoodfellas\\u201d isn\\u2019t an obvious choice for family entertainment. But the source material for this 2011 charmer from Martin Scorsese centers on another of his obsessions: cinema history. The titular novel by Brian Selznick concerns a young orphan boy\\u2019s love of the then-nascent motion picture form, forged in the tiny cinemas of 1930s Paris. By exploring the boy\\u2019s unexpected bond with a bitter shopkeeper, Scorsese mixes heartfelt storytelling with film history. But it won\\u2019t bore the kids, thanks to the generous helpings of slapstick comedy, jaw-dropping effects and full-on movie magic. Manohla Dargis called it \\u201cserious, beautiful, wise to the absurdity of life and in the embrace of a piercing longing.\\u201d\", \"These are the 50 best movies on Netflix.\", \"\\u2018The Great British Baking Show\\u2019\", \"A handful of home bakers gathers in a tent in the English countryside, where they make baked goods in front of demanding judges and supportive comedians. The cooking competition show has been done dozens of different ways, but there is something special about \\u201cThe Great British Baking Show,\\u201d a life-affirming series in which contestants of various ages and socio-ethnic backgrounds hug one another, cry together and enjoy one another\\u2019s company. Writing for The Times, Tom Whyman called it \\u201cthe key to understanding today\\u2019s Britain.\\u201d\", \"Here are 50 great TV shows on Netflix.\", \"\\u2018The Wonder Years\\u2019\", \"Nostalgia tends to run in 20-year cycles, so filmmakers and television writers spent a good deal of the 1980s meditating on the 1960s \\u2014 particularly the idealism of the Woodstock era, and how it faded away in the years that followed. This six-season family dramedy certainly trafficked in such wistfulness, but filtered it through a contemporary lens, as the adult iteration of its protagonist (voiced by Daniel Stern, played as a teen by Fred Savage) narrated his journey through middle and high school during this turbulent era. And the show is now seen through a prism of dual nostalgia, recalled with fondness by those who were themselves teenagers when it first aired, confirming that its stories of first love, teen awkwardness and familial rebellion aren\\u2019t confined to any specific era.\", \"You will surely find something to watch on this list of Hulu\\u2019s best movies and TV shows.\", \"\\u2018It\\u2019s a Wonderful Life\\u2019\", \"The director Frank Capra and the actor Jimmy Stewart took a marvelously simple premise \\u2014 a suicidal man is given the opportunity to see what his world would have been like without him \\u2014 and turned it into a holiday perennial. But \\u201cIt\\u2019s a Wonderful Life\\u201d is too rich and complex to brand with a label as simple as \\u201cChristmas movie\\u201d; it is ultimately a story about overcoming darkness and finding light around you, a tricky transition achieved primarily through the peerless work of Stewart as a good man with big dreams who can\\u2019t walk away from the place where he\\u2019s needed most. Our critic said it was a \\u201cquaint and engaging modern parable.\\u201d\", \"Here are a bunch of great movies on Amazon.\", \"\\u2018Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\u2019\", \"The first full-length animated feature remains a treasure and an institutional touchstone, establishing the outsized clashes between good and evil, the comical interludes and the lush house style that would endure as Disney hallmarks for decades. A princess\\u2019s beauty, a queen\\u2019s vanity, a magic mirror, a poisoned apple and a cottage full of diminutive miners are among the classic elements plucked from the Grimm Brothers\\u2019 fairy tale. Our critic called it \\u201csheer fantasy, delightful, gay and altogether captivating.\\u201d\", \"The 50 best things to watch on Disney+ right now.\"]","href_hash":"fa06529c4ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fa06529c4ea111ec99d327bbad8f5770"}},
