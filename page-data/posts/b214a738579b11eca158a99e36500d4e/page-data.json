But unlike last spring's buildup, which was regarded as a show of force, U.S. intelligence officials are warning that this one could be in preparation for an actual incursion into the Donbass region of Eastern Ukraine.\", \"After the virtual meeting between the two leaders got underway, Russian state television showed footage of Putin greeting Mr. Biden. \\\"Good to see you again,\\\" Mr. Biden said. \\\"We didn't get to see one another at the G-20. I hope next time we meet we do it in person.\\\"\", \"The White House released a photo of Mr. Biden in the Situation Room, where he was joined by Sullivan, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and two other aides.\", \"On a call with reporters Monday, a senior administration official didn't go into specifics about what Mr. Biden planned to tell Putin the U.S. military will or won't do in the event of an incursion. The official did say that in the event of a Russian military invasion, the U.S. will provide reassurance to allies.\", \"\\\"I don't want to use a public press call to talk about the particular sensitive challenges that President Biden will lay out for president Putin, but I would say that the United States is not seeking to end up in a circumstance in which the focus of our countermeasures is the direct use of American military force as opposed to a combination of support for Ukrainian military, strong economic countermeasures, and a substantial increase in support and capability to our NATO allies to ensure that they remain safe,\\\" the official said.\\u00a0\", \"Russia has denied any buildup and has accused Ukraine of its own troop buildup, according to BBC News.\", \"Mr. Biden planned to speak to key European allies later Monday, and with Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy after his call with Putin, according to the senior administration official.\", \"Mr. Biden said Friday that he has been \\\"aware of Russia's actions for a long time.\\\" Putin said last week that he had new \\\"red lines\\\" \\u2014 Washington and its allies must not deploy missiles in Ukraine capable of hitting Moscow.

Of course, economic sanctions are an option.\\\"\", \"A possible Russian invasion of Ukraine could involve as many as 175,000 troops, a U.S. official confirmed last week to CBS News. The plans involve extensive movement of 100 battalion tactical groups with an estimated 175,000 personnel, along with armor, artillery and equipment, according to an administration official.\\u00a0\", \"Roughly 70,000 Russian troops are currently deployed opposite Ukraine, although they lack the support units needed to launch an invasion. That support would come from reservists.\\u00a0\", \"Blinken said Friday that Putin's actions on the border are \\\"very, very concerning\\\" not just to the U.S. but to European leaders as well.
