Not only is the holiday season returning with full force, but this year \\u2014 thanks to vaccines and booster shots \\u2014 New Yorkers can (safely) return to most of their favorite festive traditions. Most venues require proof of Covid-19 vaccination or a negative test from the last 72 hours, as well as mask wearing, so check protocols beforehand. And read on for a smorgasbord of seasonal offerings around the city.\", \"Perhaps nothing says Christmas in New York quite like \\u201cThe Nutcracker\\u201d \\u2014 especially George Balanchine\\u2019s version, performed by the New York City Ballet through Jan. 2. Watch as the famous one-ton Christmas tree grows from 12 to 41 feet onstage. Or, if you\\u2019re looking for a more retro-modern twist, try \\u201cThe Hard Nut\\u201d by the Mark Morris Dance Group at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, through Dec. 23. This witty reimagining adapts the conventional 1890s story to the swinging \\u201970s, gender-bending roles along the way. And \\u201cThe Brooklyn Nutcracker\\u201d comes to the Kings Theater on Dec. 11; enjoy a fusion of ballet, hip-hop and dance genres from around the globe.\", \"Holiday-themed performances come to the stately concert hall this month, beginning with \\u201cSing! An Irish Christmas\\u201d with Keith and Kristyn Getty on Dec. 16. The next day, the New York Pops will be joined by Tony Award winner Laura Benanti in their annual \\u201cBack Home for the Holidays\\u201d show. Then, a flurry of takes on Handel\\u2019s \\u201cMessiah\\u201d: the Oratorio Society of New York will play the classic piece on Dec. 20, Musica Sacra will present its rendition the next day and the Masterwork Chorus and Orchestra will take its turn on Dec. 23. And on Dec. 27, the Russian pianist Katya Grineva will play a selection of Bach, Tchaikovsky and other greats in \\u201cA Classical Holiday.\\u201d\", \"Jack Thorne\\u2019s adaptation of Charles Dickens\\u2019s classic has left Broadway for a national tour, with stops in San Francisco and Los Angeles, but the Ghost of Christmas Past still haunts plenty of New York venues. \\u201cA Christmas Carol: The Musical\\u201d will run Off Broadway at the Players Theater through Dec. 30. At the Merchant\\u2019s House Museum, Dickens himself (played by John Kevin Jones) will retell his timeless tale (just as he did in 1867 for a month of sold-out shows in New York City) through Dec. 31. For another theatrical spin on the Victorian era, try \\u201cThe Streets of New York\\u201d at the Irish Repertory Theater.\", \"Like many of the performances on this list, \\u201cThe Christmas Spectacular\\u201d is back, through Jan. 2 at Radio City Music Hall. Snagging a ticket means joining the almost 80 million people who have seen the show since it officially began in 1933. Watch the 36 Rockettes onstage high-kick, tap-dance and twirl in synchronized precision in sparkling holiday costumes. And keep an eye on the streets outside of the Music Hall \\u2014 the live camels, sheep and donkeys from the \\u201cLiving Nativity\\u201d scene are walked there early in the morning and late at night.\", \"Four years ago, Julie Atlas Muz and Mat Fraser successfully added New York touches to the British holiday tradition known as panto with their uproarious \\u201cJack and the Beanstalk.\\u201d The only thing we can predict about the pair\\u2019s new panto, \\u201cDick Rivington and the Cat,\\u201d at Abrons Arts Center through Dec. 19, is that there will be audience participation, topical references and pop songs once again.\", \"The members of Broadway Inspirational Voices may ply their trade on the Great White Way, but the artistic director Allen Ren\\u00e9 Louis is more likely to lead them through carols and hymns in \\u201cWelcome Home: A Holiday Gospel Concert,\\u201d at Symphony Space on Dec. 6.\", \"A version of \\u201cDrag Race\\u201d alums Jinkx Monsoon and BenDeLaCreme\\u2019s show \\u201cThe Jinkx and DeLa Holiday Special\\u201d has been available online for a year, but the pair, like the best drag acts, thrive live. Catch them at the Town Hall, Dec. 3-4. Meanwhile, the showbiz maven Murray Hill single-handedly restores a ba-dum-bump sensibility in \\u201cA Murray Little Christmas\\u201d at Joe\\u2019s Pub, Dec. 14-18.\", \"The windows of Bloomingdale\\u2019s, Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman and Macy\\u2019s are once again decked out with glittering holiday lights and snow-filled displays. Highlights include a T. rex wearing a Christmas tree decorated with dinosaur ornaments and an owl teaching reindeer a course on how to fly. (For homespun but equally impressive mechanical Santas, check out the front yard displays in Dyker Heights, Brooklyn.)\", \"Also, take time to admire Rockefeller Center\\u2019s 79-foot-tall Norway spruce, now lighted through at least New Year\\u2019s Eve. Entry to the Rockefeller Center ice rink costs $20-$54, with an additional $10 skate rental. Bryant Park, the only ice-skating rink with free admission in the city, lets you bring your own skates or rent them there. Plus, its Winter Village, a European-inspired open-air market, offers local crafts, artisan goods and international gifts.\", \"The rivalry continues between what are believed to be the world\\u2019s largest Hanukkah menorahs: one in Grand Army Plaza in Brooklyn and one in Grand Army Plaza in Midtown. Both stand at a towering 32 feet high, weigh in at 4,000 pounds of steel and are lighted most evenings through Dec. 6. At the Jewish Museum on Dec. 15, Hanukkah Family Day will include pop-rock music by Joanie Leeds & The Nightlights, build-your-own menorah tutorials and holiday storytelling by Jeff Hopkins.\", \"Nothing will get in the way of \\u201cKwanzaa: A Regeneration Celebration\\u201d after 15 years strong at the Apollo Theater in Harlem \\u2014 not even Covid. This year, the virtual performance will feature the Forces of Nature Dance Theater, founded by Abdel R. Salaam; stream it live on Dec. 26 or watch it on demand from Dec. 26-Jan. 3. In person, the Brooklyn Children\\u2019s Museum will hold its 14th annual Kwanzaa celebration, Dec. 26-30, which will include art workshops, drum classes and storytelling sessions.\", \"On Dec. 3, Actionplay \\u2014 a theater organization for autistic, neurodivergent and disabled teens and adults \\u2014 will present its holiday extravaganza at the Brooklyn Conservatory of Music, where the Actionplay Chorus will perform a selection of wintry favorites. Waiting in line to see Santa can be noisy and stressful; for children in need of a calmer, quieter experience, check out the Staten Island Mall, Empire Outlets in Staten Island, Queens Center and the Shops at Atlas Park in Queens.\", \"For the 30th year running at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, tiny trains zip past miniature models of city landmarks, including the Statue of Liberty, the Brooklyn Bridge and Yankee Stadium, through Jan. 23. The garden\\u2019s \\u201cGlow\\u201d installation features a mile and a half of outdoor color and light through Jan. 22. Or explore Brooklyn Botanic Garden\\u2019s \\u201cLightscape,\\u201d through Jan. 9. There, the Winter Cathedral tunnel, Fire Garden and Sea of Light will shine alongside a series of poems by Jacqueline Woodson, written in light.\"]","href_hash":"f7d093d853a211ecb3ed0f33cb3827b7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f7d093d853a211ecb3ed0f33cb3827b7"}},
