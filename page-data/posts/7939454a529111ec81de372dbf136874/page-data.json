The cast album was a No. 1 smash. The 1961 movie won best picture and nine other Oscars. The show has been regularly revived, most recently on Broadway last year in a short-lived radical rethinking by the Belgian director Ivo van Hove. And now, this month, a movie remake by none other than Steven Spielberg.\", \"And yet, from the beginning, the show (directed and choreographed by Jerome Robbins, with a book by Arthur Laurents) has discomfited some audience members and critics \\u2014 for its violence, its mix of tones and, especially, for the way it underscores stereotypes of Puerto Ricans as gang members. Not to mention that the 1961 movie featured the white actress Natalie Wood playing the Latina role of Maria.\", \"Why does \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d continue to have such a large cultural footprint? Should it? Is it possible to be true to such richly emotional material and still be responsive to our moment?\", \"We asked five experts to weigh in: Jesse Green, the chief theater critic at The New York Times; Isabelia Herrera, a Times critic fellow; Carina del Valle Schorske, a contributing writer at the Times Magazine and the author of a 2020 Times Opinion piece challenging the show\\u2019s place in the culture; the Tony Award-winning playwright Matthew L\\u00f3pez (\\u201cThe Inheritance\\u201d); and Misha Berson, the author of \\u201cSomething\\u2019s Coming, Something Good: \\u2018West Side Story\\u2019 and the American Imagination.\\u201d\", \"They gathered before seeing the new film and just before news broke that Sondheim, the show\\u2019s lyricist and the last survivor from its creative team, had died at 91. Scott Heller, the interim editor of Arts & Leisure, kicked off the conversation, and it got going quickly from there.\", \"SCOTT HELLER What stays with you about the first time you saw \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d? Or the most memorable time?\", \"JESSE GREEN The first time I saw it was in a high school production featuring extremely clumsy dancing, warbly singing and an all-white (non-Latinx) cast. Memorable, but not in a good way. Luckily, I had already gotten to know it by then \\u2014 from the music.\", \"MATTHEW L\\u00d3PEZ My relationship to \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d is a bit unusual in that my father was in the film as an extra. He\\u2019s clearly visible in the opening scene on the playground, just after the prologue. When I was perhaps 7, my parents showed it to me, and it was incredibly exciting to see my father at 14 years old. And it was the first time I\\u2019d ever seen any kind of popular entertainment with Puerto Rican characters. It was not until later that my relationship to the show changed. I saw the revival in 2009 (my first time seeing it onstage), and I was shocked at how thinly the Puerto Rican characters were drawn.\", \"MISHA BERSON I\\u2019m probably the one person here who saw the original \\u2014 actually a Broadway tour that came through Detroit when I was 9 years old. I went with my dance class, and though it was something of a blur and I didn\\u2019t understand it much, I was captivated by the dancing, the music, the energy and excitement of the show. I became obsessed with it, but as an adult didn\\u2019t see another vibrant, fully realized production until the 5th Avenue Theater in Seattle did an excellent revival in 2007.\", \"ISABELIA HERRERA Unfortunately, my memories are wrapped up in a microaggression that has stayed with me since high school. My family is Dominican, from the city of Santiago de los Caballeros, and I am likely one of the only kids of Dominican descent who attended my high school. I remember when, in English class, a white classmate reprimanded me for not having seen \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d at the time, saying, \\u201cBut aren\\u2019t you Puerto Rican?!\\u201d\", \"CARINA DEL VALLE SCHORSKE Ugh, Isabelia, that\\u2019s such a familiar story! In a messed-up way, your classmate\\u2019s confusion makes sense, because the musical itself might just as well be about Dominicans \\u2014 it\\u2019s that general. I first saw \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d on a VHS tape my mom and I rented from the public library when I was maybe 9 or 10. I grew up in California, away from my Puerto Rican family in Washington Heights, so I thought I might find something out about my culture that I didn\\u2019t know before. But nothing onscreen \\u2014 beyond the latticework of fire escapes \\u2014 reminded me of the people or neighborhood I knew from frequent visits to New York. I finished the movie feeling even more confused than I was before about what being Puerto Rican was supposed to mean \\u2014 to me, and to the \\u201caverage\\u201d American.\", \"GREEN I\\u2019ve never seen musicals as documentaries. They often rely on stereotypes to make larger points than they could if they focused on specific, actual characteristics. Without the stereotypes, you probably couldn\\u2019t have ensembles. The question is whether the stereotypes are vile, destructive. As a white, non-Latinx person, I\\u2019m not the right person to judge that. But I would just say that the Jets are stereotyped, too, and, in the source material, so are the Veronese.\", \"BERSON Do you trust that everyone knows the source material is Shakespeare\\u2019s R&J? I wish I did!\", \"DEL VALLE SCHORSKE \\u201cThe Jets are stereotyped, too,\\u201d but white teens are not harmed by such stereotypes because there have always been such a wealth of representations to choose from. And at the time of the musical\\u2019s debut, there wasn\\u2019t a general suspicion in the air that any white teen might be a gangster, so \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d wasn\\u2019t, for them, reinforcing an expectation of criminality that was already violently shaping the politics of the period.\", \"GREEN Would you say the Puerto Rican characters are less well characterized than the white ones: the Poles, Italians and others? My sense is that most characters in most musicals are poorly characterized in terms of their ethnic or racial or other identity because that\\u2019s not what those shows are really about. Don\\u2019t get me started on gay and Jewish stereotypes in musicals, which I guess I\\u2019m especially aware of as a gay Jew.\", \"BERSON The creators of the show, though they were all white men, were not simply oblivious to what actual Puerto Ricans were like in New York at the time. For instance, Jerome Robbins visited Puerto Rican youth dances and social gatherings, and tried to incorporate some of the popular dance movements he saw in his choreography. He also tried to recruit as many Latinx performers as possible, which was difficult because there were so few opportunities for them to get the Broadway experience and training the show demanded. Also, Bernstein had always loved and admired Latin music and tried to meld some of the rhythms into his score.\", \"DEL VALLE SCHORSKE That\\u2019s interesting, about Robbins. I\\u2019m quite familiar with a broad range of Latin rhythms, and I don\\u2019t hear or see the influence \\u2014 unless you\\u2019re counting the Spanish paso doble on the rooftop. I do love some of the choreography, especially the anxious, tightly coiled \\u201cCool,\\u201d performed by the Jets. It\\u2019s good to know that someone was at least trying to do their homework after Sondheim confessed he\\u2019d \\u201cnever even met a Puerto Rican.\\u201d In this conversation, I really hope we can move beyond the false binary: \\u201cdocumentary\\u201d versus \\u201cwork of imagination.\\u201d Does a work of imagination really have to be so \\u201csuperficial and sentimental,\\u201d which is how the Black Puerto Rican journalist Jes\\u00fas Col\\u00f3n described West Side Story when it debuted?\", \"GREEN In musical theater, that isn\\u2019t a false binary. Some shows operate at a granular level, risking larger insignificance, and others work more broadly, risking stereotype. \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d as Misha can tell us more definitively, was an idea looking for an ethnicity. And it does seem to me that in landing on Puerto Ricans vs. whites (instead of Jews vs. Catholics as originally imagined), it was taking advantage of a news hook of the time without any deep engagement in Puerto Rican-ness. I guess the question is whether it\\u2019s possible for a work to rise above that when it is primarily looking at the eternal paradigm of outsiders and insiders, and the tragedy of love that tries to cross those boundaries.\", \"BERSON That is \\u201cRomeo and Juliet,\\u201d Jesse, which one could say (as you indicated) had little to do with the actual Verona (which Shakespeare never visited) but still is a potent portrayal of love in the crossfire of hate. I also want to add that though characters in musicals tend not to be deeply complex and contoured, Bernardo and Anita are not portrayed simply as bad kids spoiling for a fight. They are more sympathetic than that, as leaders and lovers, at least to my understanding \\u2014 in some ways more so than Jets members.\", \"And a moment of historical context may be helpful here: At the time of the show\\u2019s creation, there was national alarm about the growing \\u201cthreat\\u201d of youth violence during the postwar malaise, and that was true of Black, Irish and other groups of kids. And there was also, among these liberal artists, a real concern about racial/ethnic prejudice and the rising backlash against immigrants of color. These things are still meaningful, and one of the reasons I think young people especially are still very much drawn to the material despite its flaws.\", \"DEL VALLE SCHORSKE I would be more sympathetic to the possibility of \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d rising above that fault if its creators, or re-creators, were not taking advantage of Puerto Ricans as the \\u201cnews hook\\u201d for liberal street cred. If it\\u2019s supposed to be some universal and culturally interchangeable narrative, then it doesn\\u2019t get to count as a serious exploration of Puerto Rican or so-called Latinx life.\", \"GREEN I agree that \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d is not a serious exploration of those things. But that doesn\\u2019t mean it isn\\u2019t a serious exploration of something else. I say this even though I don\\u2019t actually think it\\u2019s the greatest musical ever written; it has plenty of aesthetic flaws beyond the political ones we\\u2019re discussing. My love for it comes mostly from the way the songs tell the story \\u2014 though I know that too is a point of contention. For me, Sondheim\\u2019s lyrics get at the twitchy excitement (and anger) of youth like nothing else in musical theater ever has \\u2014 as do Bernstein\\u2019s polyrhythms and percussion, whatever their actual sonic origin.\", \"HELLER Matthew, I\\u2019m going to circle back to you, as a theater artist whose response to the material has changed over time. Among other things, you wrote a play about the play and its impact on a Puerto Rican family. Tell us about it \\u2014 and was it informed by your new insights into where the original fell short?\", \"L\\u00d3PEZ The movie did spark my nascent creative brain as a piece of drama \\u2014 the music, the dancing \\u2014 and as cinema. Seeing the revival, though, I realized how much the Puerto Rican characters \\u2014 and thereby the performers playing them \\u2014 were not invited to the party, so to speak. A meal had been laid out and half the cast seemed left to go hungry. My family loved \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d but as I thought about it, I realized their love for the show wasn\\u2019t reciprocated by it.\", \"All of this led me to begin writing \\u201cSomewhere,\\u201d which is set in the neighborhood that was ultimately destroyed to build Lincoln Center. A Puerto Rican family of dancers and performers who dream of being cast in \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d (or anything Jerome Robbins created) but who, by the realities of their situation, are only left dreaming. I think in some ways, I was attempting to tell the offstage story that you don\\u2019t see.\", \"DEL VALLE SCHORSKE Matthew, it seems like \\u201cSomewhere\\u201d shows us how to engage with a \\u201ccanonical\\u201d work without reproducing its limitations. I\\u2019m interested in the way Puerto Rican artists have creatively navigated the musical\\u2019s constraints, but I\\u2019m also hungry for \\u2026 anything else! In her memoir, Rita Moreno wrote about how difficult it was to find substantial roles after \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d: I\\u2019m kind of depressed by the fact that she\\u2019s still defined by the show in 2021. I mean, Moreno performed in plays by Lorraine Hansberry, she spent decades in psychoanalysis \\u2014 doesn\\u2019t she deserve to grow?\", \"L\\u00d3PEZ I do have to cop to a bifurcated mind on this. There\\u2019s a part of me that really loves \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d and a part of me that really hates that I love \\u201cWest Side Story.\\u201d I think Lin-Manuel Miranda once called it \\u201ca blessing and a curse,\\u201d which is a sentiment I understand.\", \"BERSON It makes total sense to have a conflicted opinion of the show, especially if it speaks to you so personally. It\\u2019s not equivalent, but as a Jewish woman, \\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\\u201d drives me up the wall! Meanwhile, I can readily imagine Latinx performers might both love and resent \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d \\u2014 love the way it has given many employment and its exhilarating use of dancer-actor-singers, but resent it for all the reasons you, Carina and others have stated. Popular culture is often a double-edged sword that way.\", \"GREEN New work from new artists is the lifeblood of the theater. Yet engaging with the old ones, which were new once, can also be pleasurable and valuable \\u2014 unless they have become the equivalent of Confederate statues that need to come down. Is \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d a Confederate statue? I don\\u2019t think so.\", \"BERSON If we are now designating imperfect musicals as Confederate statues, I think that\\u2019s scary. \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d gets produced a lot because it can accommodate a teenage cast (there have been thousands of high school productions) and because it is a kind of cultural touchstone that still excites people. Confederate statues glorify bigotry and apartheid. There\\u2019s a difference.\", \"DEL VALLE SCHORSKE Audiences are taught what should resonate with them \\u2014 nothing becomes a \\u201ccultural touchstone\\u201d by accident \\u2014 and the more a certain narrative gets repeated, the more sentimental associations it accrues. \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d might not be a Confederate monument, but it is a monument to the authority of white Americans to dominate the conversation about who Puerto Ricans are. And each revival renews that authority and co-signs the narrative for a new generation.\", \"GREEN All art is political, yes, and deserves to be judged as such. But art is not just political, and deserves to be judged on other grounds, too. If there is no pleasure to be had in \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d then it cannot possibly overcome the problems we\\u2019re discussing. But if it does offer pleasure, then we, as individuals, are free to weigh it against those problems. The balance will be different for different people, not necessarily corresponding with identity.\", \"HELLER Matthew, you and I had some provocative back-and-forths about critical responses to \\u201cThe Inheritance\\u201d and its depictions of the gay community, and you were good enough to write a piece for us, in which you made this point: \\u201cNo one piece of writing about our complex, sprawling community will ever tell the entire story, and I believe that is a good thing: It creates an unquenchable thirst for more and more narratives.\\u201d Does that hold for \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d as well?\", \"L\\u00d3PEZ I don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s an apt comparison. \\u201cThe Inheritance\\u201d is a gay play written by a gay man whereas \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d is purported to be about Puerto Ricans and was written by white men. And while there are heterosexual characters in \\u201cThe Inheritance,\\u201d they aren\\u2019t serving the same dramatic function in my play that the Puerto Rican characters do in \\u201cWest Side Story.\\u201d And I used the word \\u201cfunction\\u201d purposefully, for that is what they feel in the story. I\\u2019d love to see a \\u201cRosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead\\u201d-style rethinking one day.\", \"DEL VALLE SCHORSKE I agree that any future engagement with \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d that actually deepens the material would have to abandon all loyalty to the show as written, the way \\u201cRosencrantz and Guildenstern\\u201d completely reimagines \\u201cHamlet.\\u201d It\\u2019s an independent work of art that deconstructs the canonical play. I doubt the creators of \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d gave a single thought to \\u201cnew narratives\\u201d that might emerge from their musical, let alone new Puerto Rican narratives. And it doesn\\u2019t seem like the power brokers of Broadway or Hollywood are really thirsting for them, otherwise the same material wouldn\\u2019t get recycled over and over.\", \"HELLER So we are getting to the Spielberg movie.\", \"HERRERA I\\u2019m also skeptical of how much the thirst for new narratives comes from a genuine place, rather than a response to an industry that is clearly grappling with questions of racism and struggling to navigate critiques about representation. Honestly, I think there is something sinister about capitalizing on the nostalgia of a Hollywood artifact, casting an all-Latinx Sharks cast, while still using the liberal language of \\u201cinclusion\\u201d and \\u201cdiversity\\u201d as armor against critique. The fact that \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d is being remade with these issues in mind doesn\\u2019t necessarily absolve it of its original missteps.\", \"BERSON So is there no place for \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d even with the best of intentions? Does that mean there\\u2019s no place for \\u201cOthello\\u201d or \\u201cMerchant of Venice,\\u201d which are problematic but still dramatically vital works? Can we still see the show, or not see it, and have fruitful debate about it?\", \"DEL VALLE SCHORSKE I\\u2019m not advocating the wholesale erasure of \\u201cWest Side Story.\\u201d I\\u2019m saying, let\\u2019s stop pouring literally hundreds of millions of dollars into propping up its relevance, and let\\u2019s stop minimizing its flaws.\", \"HERRERA Misha, I think we can certainly still have a fruitful debate about it! When discussions around colorism mushroomed online surrounding the film adaptation of \\u201cIn the Heights,\\u201d I mentioned in our roundtable that criticism emerges from a place of love \\u2014 a desire to make art, life and politics better. I don\\u2019t see these critiques as mutually exclusive.\", \"BERSON That is very well said. And just my awareness of the politics of librettist Arthur Laurents and composer Leonard Bernstein especially \\u2014 who were both blacklisted in the \\u201950s for their civil rights and other activism \\u2014 makes me think they would probably share some of these concerns and find them meaningful. But the show has intrinsic artistic power, and I think will survive. It is encouraging to me that someone with the skill and sensitivity of Tony Kushner is the screenwriter/adapter. I hope it\\u2019s great, and I hope it\\u2019s the last!\", \"HELLER Do others hope the remake is great?\", \"HERRERA I don\\u2019t know if there is such a thing as a great remake, but I\\u2019m certainly hoping this version releases its grip on stereotypes, offers its more underdeveloped characters a bit of autonomy and perhaps provides more texture about the actual life and experiences of Puerto Rican migration at the time. And please, give us at least a few songs with actual Afro-Caribbean rhythms! A plena take on \\u201cI Feel Pretty\\u201d?\", \"GREEN Authenticity isn\\u2019t the goal; if \\u201cHamilton\\u201d were authentic, it would be mostly minuets. I want the new movie of \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d to succeed if it\\u2019s good, if it manages to move people. But if only white people are moved, it will be a failure.\", \"L\\u00d3PEZ I\\u2019m excited to see what Spielberg, Kushner and [the choreographer Justin] Peck do with the material for a 21st-century audience. It\\u2019s a perfect opportunity to honor what\\u2019s glorious about the show, and address what is flawed.\", \"DEL VALLE SCHORSKE I want it to flop so we can move on.\"]","href_hash":"7939454a529111ec81de372dbf136874"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7939454a529111ec81de372dbf136874"}},
