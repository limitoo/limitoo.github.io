That would be the fastest clip since February 1982.\", \"But prices are expected to have climbed 0.4 percent in January from the prior month. That is unusually rapid, but it is a moderation from the biggest monthly increases last year, which came in as high as 0.9 percent.\", \"Forecasters anticipate that inflation will ease meaningfully in 2022: Many expect it to finish the year closer to 3 percent.
