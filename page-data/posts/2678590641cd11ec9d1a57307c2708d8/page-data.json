He tells me that he has a younger sister who lives in Manhattan. I say I\\u2019d like to meet her. Soon after, Donnie\\u2019s father dies. I bring lemon chicken to the wake. Donnie calls me over to meet his sister, Bonnie. (Donnie\\u2019s twin brother is Ronnie.) Mesmerized, I shake Bonnie\\u2019s hand for a stupidly long time and keep repeating, \\u201cI brought chicken.\\u201d Some time later, Donnie calls Bonnie and says, \\u201cRemember the guy with the chicken?\\u201d Wary, she replies, \\u201cYeah.\\u201d We married nine months later. \\u2014 Bruce Julian\", \"I carried our first child, and my wife carried our second \\u2014 a perk of our two-uterus marriage. As her belly grew, so did my apprehension. Could I love this baby as much as the one I birthed? Would other people see our first child as \\u201cmine\\u201d and our second as \\u201chers\\u201d? I didn\\u2019t think I would feel such distinctions, but how could I be sure? Then it was time. I stared at my wife\\u2019s frightened face. Her body shook. The baby cried. I cut his umbilical cord and held him. His skin against mine. He is mine. He is ours. \\u2014 Laura Leigh Abby\", \"In 1988, my Palestinian father died. My American mother had died two years earlier. I flew back to Jordan, where I grew up, and spent a year learning to be parentless. Before returning to the United States, I bought a traditional Palestinian floor pillow embroidered in colors of wheat and earth. Its intricate pattern offered a map for my confusion and grief. After decades of use, the pillow ripped \\u2014 rifts in its rich embroidery echoing the severance of loss. A widow now, I see how the pattern of life is mapped by careful stitches, how the thread of love continues. \\u2014 Lisa Suhair Majaj\", \"My husband and I used to enjoy cooking together and keeping the spice rack well stocked. After our nest emptied, the bottles of hot sauce on the top shelf dwindled (too much heat for my husband alone). To curb our carb intake, I stopped baking. The cinnamon and vanilla extract gathered dust. Soon, he went vegetarian, and I leaned Paleo. Meals became functional and uninspired. The spice rack filled with prescription bottles. Retirement and coronavirus cramp our personal space, but most days we still eat together. Who needs spice when you\\u2019ve already got your sugar? \\u2014 Karen DeBonis\"]","href_hash":"2678590641cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2678590641cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
