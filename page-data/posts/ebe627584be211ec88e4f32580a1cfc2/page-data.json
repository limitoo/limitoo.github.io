McDonough Jr., of Hampton Superior Court, wrote in his dismissal that he believed the five veterans named in the case had been exposed to the virus before the two units were merged, so the administrators could not be held legally responsible. \", \"\\u201cThere was insufficiently reasonably trustworthy evidence presented to the grand jury that, had these two dementia units not been merged, the medical condition of any of these five veterans would have been materially different,\\u201d he wrote.\", \"Ms. Healey is weighing whether to appeal the decision, a spokeswoman said. \", \"\\u201cWe are very disappointed in today\\u2019s ruling, especially on behalf of the innocent victims and families harmed by the defendants\\u2019 actions,\\u201d said Jillian Fennimore.\", \"The criminal charges against the two administrators \\u2014 the superintendent Bennett Walsh and the medical director David Clinton \\u2014 were believed to be the first in the country brought against nursing home staff, and the two could had faced years or even decades in prison if convicted.\", \"Because of staffing shortages, the facility consolidated the units, which had a total of 42 residents who had different Covid-19 statuses, and residents who were positive or symptomatic were placed six in a room that typically held four veterans. An independent investigation of the deaths quoted nurses who said they knew that the move to combine units would prove deadly to many of their patients. \", \"Relatives of the veterans who died at the facility expressed frustration at the judge\\u2019s decision on Monday. \", \"\\u201cAbsolutely disgusting, our veterans and their families apparently are a disposable commodity,\\u201d wrote Susan Perez, whose father, James Miller, died at the home, adding, \\u201cApparently no one is responsible for the deaths of the veterans and trauma to their families.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ebe627584be211ec88e4f32580a1cfc2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ebe627584be211ec88e4f32580a1cfc2"}},
