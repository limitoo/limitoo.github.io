Behind the Christmas cheer, it\\u2019s clear that the world outside the cottage is in peril, and the friends have made a pact to make a drastic escape.\", \"The danger is never fully explained, but there appears to be a noxious cloud of toxins engulfing the Earth that painfully kills those exposed to it. Throughout, the children often serve as proxies for adults, engaging in political conversations while their parents reminisce or talk about who slept with whom in high school. Art (Roman Griffin Davis), one of Nell\\u2019s children, watches videos online that seem to contradict his parents\\u2019 messaging, and he starts to question their choices.\", \"The timing of \\u201cSilent Night\\u201d makes it destined to be viewed as a Covid-19 film, but it\\u2019s actually about climate change and the government\\u2019s inaction in the crisis. It\\u2019s an eerie movie that emphasizes the ways in which children are vulnerable to adults\\u2019 decisions, and how the wealthy skirt responsibility and protect their own. Most of the adult characters seem to be living inside a conspiracy theory, blinded by their own fear and resigned to their impending doom. But the characters, despite their histrionic representation of the wealthy class, are not compelling enough to carry the movie, nor are the horrors of the outside world fleshed out enough to frighten. Ultimately, the movie seems to ask: In the face of a dying world, should we give up or stay and fight?\"]","href_hash":"d1b09a16536c11ec8431677512b10b72"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d1b09a16536c11ec8431677512b10b72"}},
