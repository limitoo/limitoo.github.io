(Brent crude is now trading for about $73 a barrel.)\", \"Alarm bells about gas prices started sounding late last summer. Prices hit a peak in October, but lately they have resumed climbing, reaching new highs. Several factors are pushing prices higher, including the fact that supplies are straining to keep up with strong demand as the effects of the pandemic lockdowns ease.\", \"At the same time, import volumes from Russia, Europe\\u2019s chief supplier, remain low. The buildup of Russian troops on the border with Ukraine is both creating worries over the possibility of disruptions of gas flows through that country, and the political tension is making it unlikely that Nord Stream 2, the recently completed but not approved gas pipeline between Russia and Germany, will open anytime soon.\", \"Germany\\u2019s new foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, sent gas prices soaring on Monday when she said the giant pipeline could not be certified because it did not meet European Union rules.\", \"Whatever happens with Ukraine, Europe has not built up sufficient gas in storage to guarantee that there will be enough to fuel to heat homes and power businesses if the weather turns frigid, as some forecasters predict.\", \"Europe burns far more gas in the winter than in summer, and European gas suppliers last summer failed to replenish inventories that were drained by a late cold snap last spring. Adding to concerns, in November European storage facilities \\u201cdepleted at the fastest rate since records began,\\u201d according to Ms. Page of Kpler.\", \"Much of course depends on the weather and whether tensions ease over Ukraine, but analysts say the market is likely to be on edge at least until the peak of winter \\u2014 bad news for businesses that use large amounts of gas, like fertilizer producers or metals smelters.\", \"Elevated gas prices will continue to push electricity bills higher in countries like Britain and Italy that use large amounts of gas to generate power. Rising bills in turn will squeeze consumers and boost inflation, which hit 5.1 percent in Britain for November, the highest in a decade.\"]","href_hash":"d24217e15da711ec8c7c8134f489ff19"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d24217e15da711ec8c7c8134f489ff19"}},
