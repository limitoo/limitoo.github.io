O\\u2019Keefe, the chief executive of the Theodore Roosevelt Presidential Library Foundation, said in a statement on Friday. \\u201cOur job is to forthrightly examine history to understand the present and make a better future.\\u201d\", \"The library, which is slated to open in 2026 in Medora (population 129), will offer distance in both years and miles from the statue\\u2019s perch at the entrance of one of New York City\\u2019s most prominent museums.\", \"Designed by the American sculptor James Earle Fraser, the statue has stood on the steps of the museum, overlooking Central Park West, since 1940. In recent years, however, it has been the target of protests from those who see it as a symbol of colonialism.\", \"\\u201cHeight is power in public art, and Roosevelt\\u2019s stature on his noble steed visibly expresses dominance and superiority over the Native American and African figures,\\u201d a mayoral panel reviewing monuments and markers on city-owned property wrote in a 2018 report. (It ultimately decided to leave the statue in place, with added context.)\", \"The statue will be in storage until it\\u2019s displayed when the library opens. (The long-term loan agreement and any plans to display the statue are subject to final approval by the city\\u2019s Public Design Commission.)\", \"With the support of the Roosevelt family, the library will also establish an advisory council composed of representatives of Indigenous and Black people, as well as historians, scholars and artists to determine how to recontextualize the statue.\", \"\\u201cIt is fitting that the statue is being relocated to a place where its composition can be recontextualized to facilitate difficult, complex and inclusive discussions,\\u201d Theodore Roosevelt V, a great-great-grandson of the president, said in a statement.\", \"The arrangement came about after the Public Design Commission voted unanimously in June to remove the statue and relocate it to a cultural institution dedicated to the life and legacy of the former president. The museum had recognized that the depiction was problematic, and, after years of objections from activists and amid an urgent nationwide conversation about racism, proposed removing the statue in June 2020. New York City, which owns the building and property, agreed to the suggestion, and Mayor Bill de Blasio expressed his support.\", \"Vicki Been, the city\\u2019s deputy mayor for housing and economic development, said that the loan would \\u201callow an important part of the city\\u2019s art collection to be appropriately contextualized.\\u201d\", \"The president of the American Museum of Natural History, Ellen V. Futter, said that the museum anticipates that the removal process, which will take several months, will begin later this fall. (Anne Canty, a spokeswoman for the museum, said in an email that the museum would pay for its removal, and that the commission had approved a plaque for the site, as well as a restoration of the steps.)\", \"The announcement comes amid national debate over the appropriateness of statues or monuments that first focused on Confederate officials like Robert E. Lee before expanding to a broader set of figures, like Christopher Columbus or Winston Churchill. Last month, city officials voted unanimously to remove a statue of Thomas Jefferson from New York City Council chambers, citing his history as a slaveholder, and several other Jefferson statues have been removed or destroyed in the last year, including ones in Oregon and Georgia. (The New York City Council statue will find a home at the New-York Historical Society.)\", \"The American Museum of Natural History has also been re-evaluating displays in its halls.\", \"In January 2020, the museum moved the Northwest Coast Great Canoe from its 77th Street entrance into that hall to better contextualize it. The museum\\u2019s Old New York diorama, which includes a stereotypical depiction of Lenape leaders, also now has captions explaining why the display is offensive.\"]","href_hash":"926fd97c496611ec93b0c5554538cf99"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"926fd97c496611ec93b0c5554538cf99"}},
