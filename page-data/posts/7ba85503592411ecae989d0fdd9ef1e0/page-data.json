In the early 1970s, Semmel started making large-scale oil paintings of nude partners having sex, their bodies rendered in vivid Neo-expressionist colors like red, purple, yellow and an acid or bluish green that gives off a spectral glow. The perspective in the works is subjective, close-up and deliberately skewed, requiring a concentrated effort on the part of the viewer to compose the limbs, buttocks, breasts, vaginas and penises into recognizable images of men and women. These paintings would eventually be followed by ones documenting Semmel\\u2019s own nude body as it\\u2019s aged over the decades.\", \"The almost pornographic yet matter-of-fact graphicness that marks Semmel\\u2019s work might be taken for granted today (the work of Lisa Yuskavage, Marilyn Minter and Angela Dufresne comes to mind), but was jolting when Semmel was starting out. And even now, her paintings retain their ability to shock or put off viewers, including women. When I showed a few of Semmel\\u2019s self-portraits to a friend of mine, her main response was one of disgust, and images of Semmel\\u2019s work have been censored by Instagram for their nudity. The artist\\u2019s provocative intentions are unrelated to sensationalism in and of itself, though; rather, they derive from her wish to go up against historical messages, whether coming from the art world or pop culture, about women\\u2019s sexual passivity and perceived value as seductive lure to men. \\u201cWomen are essentially chattel in so much of the history of Western art,\\u201d Semmel observes. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what I rebelled against.\\u201d\", \"Semmel, who turned 89 on Oct. 19, has finally been given her first retrospective, \\u201cSkin in the Game,\\u201d which covers more than six decades and will stay up through April 3 at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts (PAFA) in Philadelphia. In addition to her realist nudes, it includes early abstract paintings, drawings and collages. As Semmel attests, she has always had a \\u201cback and forth\\u201d with abstraction, aiming to use abstract and realist elements together. She adds that she never wanted to conform to any particular style and has never considered herself a realist. \\u201cI found those distinctions spurious,\\u201d she declares.\", \"One could ask why it took so long for a painter of Semmel\\u2019s daring, skill and influence to be accorded this tribute, which comes after decades of her having been put in the descriptive box of \\u201cfeminist artist.\\u201d Semmel is indeed a passionate feminist, but she would like for her work to be considered \\u201con its own terms,\\u201d she says, adding that, \\u201cfeminist art should be mainstream \\u2014 not off in the corner, a footnote in history.\\u201d Then again, one could also ask why Louise Bourgeois and Alice Neel were in their 70s before either of them was given a retrospective. (The sculptor Louise Nevelson, by contrast, snubbed feminism and aligned herself with male art critics like Hilton Kramer and Robert Hughes, neither of whom had any use for women\\u2019s clamor about inequality. Which might explain why she had her first major museum retrospective, at the Whitney in 1967, when she was \\u201conly\\u201d 67).\", \"To really answer the question, one would have to address the lack of regard given to women painters and sculptors from the beginning, whether the mode of the moment was, say, Impressionism or Abstract Expressionism or Photo Realism. This is something with which critics, curators and artists including Semmel have long grappled, especially since the advent of second-wave feminism. Whatever answer one comes up with, though, is likely to have something to do with age-old attitudes about gender and the nature of creative genius.\", \"Although representations of nude female figures had been and continued to be a crucial part of the Western art tradition in the \\u201970s, they were mostly done from a male point of view, and frequently had a voyeuristic and titillating slant. One has only to think of \\u00c9douard Manet\\u2019s \\u201cOlympia\\u201d (1863) or Gustave Courbet\\u2019s infamous \\u201cOrigin of the World\\u201d (1866) (once owned, tellingly or not, by the psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan), which features a daringly cropped close-up of the genitals of a naked woman lying on a bed with her legs spread. In the classicist Mary Beard\\u2019s documentary \\u201cShock of the Nude\\u201d (2020), the historian sums up the dominance of the male gaze in her musings on the Medici Venus, a life-size Hellenistic marble sculpture depicting Aphrodite, the Greek goddess of love: \\u201cI\\u2019m never quite sure \\u2026 whether I\\u2019m with those guys peering up the statue\\u2019s bum,\\u201d she says, \\u201cor whether it\\u2019s my bum they\\u2019re peering up. It\\u2019s those difficult questions about yourself that are the real shock of the nude.\\u201d\", \"The institutional exclusion of women artists and the collective understanding of the concept of greatness, a label typically applied to white male artists, are taken up, famously, in Linda Nochlin\\u2019s 1971 essay, \\u201cWhy Have There Been No Great Women Artists?\\u201d The piece gets itself into a quandary of sorts, first questioning the legitimacy of the inquiry and then backpedaling over its own quibbles to ascribe this supposed absence to a lack of education and exposure. When I allude to this essay, Semmel\\u2019s response is crisp: \\u201cIt\\u2019s time we let go of that article. Great women artists are never celebrated. They rise and then they\\u2019re written out.\\u201d\", \"SEMMEL WEARS HER grayish-white hair girlishly long and still bears traces of her youthful beauty. Her keen blue eyes seem to miss nothing, and she has an energy about her that would put women several decades her junior to shame, despite her having recently taken a fall and wounded her leg. Notwithstanding my protests that I am going on to a late dinner after my visit, she insists on serving me supper \\u2014 scallops, sweet potatoes and asparagus \\u2014 navigating cautiously in the small kitchen. This gracious hostess side of her is unexpected and, coming from a woman with such fierce drive and a hard-won sense of independence, quite touching.\", \"In the carpeted studio with 14-foot-high ceilings, which is separated from the living room area by an eight-foot-wide wooden door, several plants sit on the ledge of large windows overlooking Spring Street, and there is an old-school desk with a computer, printer and piles of paper on it. Semmel uses two glass-topped rolling carts to hold her cans of brushes and squeezed tubes of oil paint. A finished canvas, a nude self-portrait, leans against the paint-splattered eastern wall.\", \"Ever since the 1980s, Semmel\\u2019s project has been to depict her own body \\u2014 prone, crouched or twisted and frequently truncated \\u2014 with drooping breasts and rolls of flesh and all, as it moves ever further from the idealized youth of traditional female portraiture. In the studio are also other smaller examples of these works, which feature swaths of hot and cool hues. Sometimes Semmel applies the paint in thin, fluid expanses, and at other times in thick layers, and the canvasses have a textured, tactile quality, as if the nude figures they depict invite touch. In all the paintings Semmel wears a large turquoise ring that she describes as an identity marker. The ring also has a technical purpose in that it introduces, says Semmel, \\u201canother kind of color and surface against the softness of the flesh.\\u201d\", \"Semmel, nee Alperstein, grew up in the Bronx; her mother was an immigrant from Eastern Europe, and her father was an American who had been brought up by an Orthodox Jewish family after his mother died. He owned a dry-cleaning business, and Semmel\\u2019s mother was a fastidious housewife who was on her knees every morning taking a sponge to the floors. Semmel, who had a younger brother, was a sickly child with constant mastoiditis. She spent a lot of time indoors, drawing with crayons and pastels and copying comics. She also liked to read, despite the absence of books at home (Charles Dickens\\u2019s \\u201cDavid Copperfield,\\u201d 1849, was one of the few) and would embark on weekly walks to the library and bring back \\u201creams of books.\\u201d In junior high she joined art clubs, and one of her teachers told her mother that she was talented and should apply to Manhattan\\u2019s High School for Music & Art. When I ask her where she thinks she got her aesthetic sensibility from, she raises her arms, suggesting that such matters are impenetrable mysteries. \\u201cThe compulsion drives us,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to know where compulsion comes from. If I knew what drove me, I wouldn\\u2019t have been driven.\\u201d\", \"At Music & Art Semmel was exposed to a world beyond the one she had known until then. \\u201cIt was an intellectual environment very different from the background I had come from,\\u201d she recalls. \\u201cI saw real art and slides, and went to museums for the first time.\\u201d When she decided to go next to Cooper Union, instead of City College, she realized she had \\u201cmade the choice to be an artist.\\u201d (One of her high school teachers was disappointed: \\u201cYou have this logical mind,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt will be wasted.\\u201d) Once there, she took courses in the flat graphic style called 2-D design made popular by the painter Stuart Davis, as well as in Ashcan School painting and early Abstract Expressionism. \\u201cThere wasn\\u2019t much in the way of realism,\\u201d she recalls. \\u201cNo Renaissance. The mantra was \\u2018The picture plane is flat.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"She married Harold Semmel, at the age of 19, in 1952, the same year she graduated from Cooper Union. After that, she worked as a model in the garment district for five months. She\\u2019d been painting on the side, but stopped when she moved back in with her parents while her husband, an engineer, was posted to North Africa during the Korean War, because, as she notes, still incredulous all these years later, \\u201cwomen couldn\\u2019t live alone.\\u201d The couple\\u2019s daughter, Patricia, was born in 1955, when they were living the bourgeois life in a garden apartment in Bayside, Queens. Semmel came down with tuberculosis a year and a half later and was hospitalized for six months, during which time a piece of one of her lungs was taken out. She recalls that during that time she read \\u201ca book a day\\u201d and knew, she says, that \\u201cI was going to go back to painting. I realized that the life I had was centered around my family, and I needed something for myself.\\u201d\", \"In 1963, after Semmel had gotten a BFA from Pratt Institute, her husband\\u2019s firm relocated him to Madrid. \\u201cWe went for a year,\\u201d she says, \\u201cand I stayed for seven and a half.\\u201d She liked how far money went in Spain \\u2014 the family lived in a duplex apartment with a pool on the roof \\u2014 and the liberating experience of being a nonnative. In a revealing essay titled \\u201cA Necessary Elaboration,\\u201d which appears in the catalog that accompanied her 2015 show, \\u201cJoan Semmel: Across Five Decades,\\u201d at Alexander Gray Associates in New York, the gallery she has been with for a decade, she writes, \\u201cAs an American artist and a foreigner in Madrid, I was not expected to conform. They considered all foreign women totally immoral, so it didn\\u2019t really matter.\\u201d She enjoyed, too, the \\u201cheady mix\\u201d of people from \\u201call strata of life,\\u201d including \\u201cforeign correspondents \\u2026 business expatriates and any number of characters out of F. Scott Fitzgerald.\\u201d Semmel notes that \\u201cI emerged a different person.\\u201d She had a son, Andrew, in 1965 and, after her husband left for South America, she remained in Madrid, where she exhibited her abstract paintings. (\\u201cI think they were very strong,\\u201d she asserts.) In 1970, when her son was of school age, she returned with the children to New York and filed for divorce, which she had been unable to do in Spain, where it was illegal.\", \"SEMMEL\\u2019S LIFE AS an artist really took off after she settled into her loft. It was then that she started working figuratively, a bold move at a time when the style was considered if not dead, then at least pass\\u00e9. She also discovered feminism, which led to her involvement with other women artists, including Joyce Kozloff, Judith Bernstein, May Stevens, Miriam Schapiro, Anita Steckel, Carolee Schneemann, Juanita McNeely, Nancy Spero, Emma Amos and Hannah Wilke, who all wanted to change the culture with their work. (I tell Semmel this list of names is too long to include in this piece in full, but she is adamant about my keeping every one.) \\u201cThere was great excitement in New York City at that time,\\u201d she says. \\u201cThere was a constant interchange that lasted through the down years.\\u201d\", \"In 1973, Semmel joined Steckel\\u2019s nascent Fight Censorship (FC) group, whose agenda focused on the wider acceptance of sexually explicit artworks by women. Shortly thereafter, Semmel began to create her \\u201cSex Paintings\\u201d and \\u201cErotic Series,\\u201d which consist of large-scale depictions of naked heterosexual couples performing sex acts. With the \\u201cErotic Series\\u201d she moved from working from drawings to black-and-white photographs she\\u2019d taken of the couples, mostly friends (in some of Semmel\\u2019s works, she\\u2019s included an image of herself wielding the camera), but continued to employ nonrepresentational color as a primary element. \\u201cAt that time, the use of photography by a painter was considered not quite legitimate,\\u201d she writes in \\u201cA Necessary Elaboration.\\u201d But, she goes on, \\u201cI appropriated the modeled form and smooth surface of the closely cropped photograph into my paintings, which tended to push the image out from the picture plane into the viewer\\u2019s space. \\u2026 This served as a distancing device defining the object as art, and separating it from the realm of pornography.\\u201d\", \"I ask her why she chose sexuality as her subject. \\u201cI found still-lifes and landscapes so boring,\\u201d she answers. \\u201cI identified with the female body. I felt very strongly that women needed to be able to express their own sexual desires rather than follow the Hollywood concept of the chivalric tradition, in which Sleeping Beauty is aroused to passion by the handsome prince. I was a woman at the height of my sexual powers and didn\\u2019t want to be ashamed of it.\\u201d Her work owes, then, very much to the feminist conviction that the personal is political. \\u201cThe imagery that invades our consciousness,\\u201d she says, \\u201cand constructs our sense of who we are and how we should be \\u2014 \\u2018mother and child,\\u2019 \\u2018pretty woman,\\u2019 \\u2018heroic male\\u2019 \\u2014 ideas about sexuality without shame, vulnerability in women and the aged, have all been the content of my work as I have lived them through my own experience.\\u201d\", \"Semmel moved to using her own body as a subject partly, she explains, \\u201cto stay away from the objectification issue. I was also very interested in perceiving your body through your own eyes.\\u201d In an interview she did with the writer and professor Richard Meyer in 2007, she said that she was trying \\u201cto find an erotic language to which women could respond, one which did not reiterate the male power positions and prevalent fetishizations.\\u201d Semmel wasn\\u2019t alone in this: Philip Perlstein was creating precise, dispassionate nude portraits, while Betty Tompkins was producing her unabashed black-and-white paintings of couples engaged in coitus, and predating all of them was the pioneering Suzanne Valadon, who painted one of the first full-length female nude self-portraits in \\u201cAdam and Eve\\u201d (1909). But in insisting on the primacy and validity of the female nude in its own right, not as an object to be judged by male spectators, Semmel helped start an artistic revolution that would eventually influence painters such as Jenny Saville to take on the raw topography of female fleshiness, and even corpulence, with fearless abandon. \\u201cIn contrast to the nudes of art history,\\u201d the art critic Deborah Solomon tells me, \\u201cSemmel\\u2019s figures are purged of idealization and offer us a view of femaleness that allows for awkward poses and bovine thighs. She paints skin that is clearly inhabited by real women \\u2014 women who are variously shown sitting or lying down, touching, relaxing, intent on their own comfort and satisfaction rather than self-display.\\u201d\", \"Although Semmel\\u2019s \\u201cSex Paintings\\u201d would receive favorable reviews, she couldn\\u2019t find a gallery that would actually show them, and, in 1952, had to rent her own exhibition space at 141 Prince Street. She was also seen as flouting some of the tenets of second-wave feminism. In a piece by Alison M. Gingeras published in 2015 in Art News, the curator makes the retrospective argument that because black sheep feminist artists (as she dubs them) like Semmel \\u201cembraced a sex-positive attitude in their work,\\u201d and explored \\u201cthe extreme edges of feminist politics and sexualized iconography,\\u201d they were \\u201csystematically excluded from important exhibitions and catalogs devoted to women\\u2019s art.\\u201d\", \"When I raise this point with her, she replies that she wasn\\u2019t swayed by the movement\\u2019s assumptions, despite being lead to believe, as she puts it, \\u201cthat a woman\\u2019s body was colonized territory, that there was no way of using it without objectifying women.\\u201d She goes on to say that women were critical of her \\u201cbecause they felt if you played with the female nude, it would end up in the male playground.\\u201d I remark, half-humorously, that Semmel happens to have had (and still has) what would be considered a conventionally attractive body, prompting her to shoot back: \\u201cI didn\\u2019t think I had a good body. None of us ever feel we have a great body. It\\u2019s never just right.\\u201d\", \"SEMMEL\\u2019S RETROSPECTIVE AT the PAFA is a thoughtfully curated (by Jodi Throckmorton), beautifully hung presentation of an entirely ravishing collection of her work. The 64 pieces on view include early Ab-Ex paintings; two figure studies for \\u201cSex Paintings\\u201d that make use of quick, sinuous lines reminiscent of erotic drawings by Henri Matisse; and a tender yet gimlet-eyed depiction of a women\\u2019s changing room, part of Semmel\\u2019s \\u201cLocker-Room\\u201d series (1988-91), that shows a group of nude figures: one is sitting at a counter, another is in the shower, one is peering at herself in the mirror and one is anxiously checking her weight on a balance beam scale. Viewers also encounter three slightly eerie paintings of mannequins from the late \\u201990s; several of Semmel\\u2019s overlay paintings, in which newer line drawings of hers are superimposed upon earlier images, imparting a sense of dynamism and dissolution; and an ambitious triptych from 1977 called \\u201cMythologies and Me,\\u201d for which Semmel painted a parody of a Playboy centerfold and a parody of a Willem de Kooning portrait of a woman and placed them on either side of a self-portrait. The effect is almost discordant, but also riveting, like a cacophony of voices each demanding to be heard. The focus of the exhibit is on Semmel\\u2019s iconic nudes, including the most recent iterations, which utilize techniques of blurring and outlining and doubling, sometimes on the artist\\u2019s face.\", \"I suppose one might call Semmel a painter\\u2019s painter, as some have, and the show makes her love affair with paint itself, and with color, abundantly clear, except that this designation makes her sound insulated from the larger world. In truth, one comes away with an impression of a woman using her painterly and intellectual skills with unbounded determination to capture both her inner life and the life of the culture in which she resides; even within a single painting, one can see Semmel thinking her way through intense conflict and the possibility of resolution. \\u201cThe canvas becomes the tender skin of fragile thoughts,\\u201d she once wrote. Put another way, beneath her invocations of female flesh is a vital presence who engages us in her ongoing struggle to define herself \\u2014 and, by extension, us.\", \"\\u201cSkin in the Game\\u201d is something of a revelation, and should put to an end any doubts about Semmel\\u2019s significance as an artist, not merely a feminist artist. As I walk around the exhibit, something the poet Adrienne Rich once said keeps dancing in my head: \\u201cA thinking woman sleeps with monsters.\\u201d It is a measure of Semmel\\u2019s enormous talent and intelligence that she has taken the monsters that besiege us and made of them something compelling and luminous and beautiful.\"]","href_hash":"7ba85503592411ecae989d0fdd9ef1e0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7ba85503592411ecae989d0fdd9ef1e0"}},
