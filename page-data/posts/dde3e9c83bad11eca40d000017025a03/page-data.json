We had been in level 4 for the longest period that we'd ever been in level 4.\\\"\", \"She says the decision to keep Auckland in level 3 has kept case loads much much lower than has been seen in NSW and Victoria.\", \"\\\"That is down to the commitment of everyone in Auckland.\\\"\", \"Ardern says it will take some time for people to get to grips with the new traffic light system, just as it took a while to get used to the alert levels.\", \"She says the message to New Zealanders is to get vaccinated if the country is to move in a concerted way towards lower restrictions.\", \"Ardern says the digital options for vaccine certificates will be ready to use by the end of this month, but if needed other forms of the certificates can be used earlier. This could include if Auckland or the South Island reached 90 percent double vaccinated, triggering a potential move from alert levels to the traffic light system.\", \"Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield says as of yesterday 75 percent of eligible New Zealanders are now fully vaccinated, and 80 percent can be expected to reach that milestone next week. Auckland is already at 80 percent.\", \"He says 70 percent was a figure that was being bandied about internationally, so to reach that is fantastic.\", \"Pointing to several slides showing the outbreak in Auckland, Bloomfield says whilst case numbers are increasing, \\\"we can see the hospitalisation numbers are not increasing at the same rate, and in fact a number of those people in hospital are in hospital for reasons other than Covid-19\\\".\", \"He says of concern in the current cases is a large proportion of M\\u0101ori. \\\"It was less than 10 percent of cases initially in August but is ... between 40 and 50 percent of cases each day now.\\\"\", \"He says the number of Pasifika cases has dropped from the high proportion seen at the beginning of the outbreak.\", \"Regarding paediatric vaccines, Bloomfield says Medsafe will not skimp on its protections and will wait until Pfizer makes the application. He says the government is having conversations with Pfizer about ordering the vaccines.\", \"Bloomfield says testing for M\\u0101ori is still high, however, with about 12 percent of M\\u0101ori in Auckland having been tested in the past 14 days. \\\"This is very important for us being able to identify cases there.\\\"\", \"He says there has also been a slight increase in the positivity rate, but it remains one of the lowest, if not the lowest, in the OECD.\", \"Modelling of the R-value shows projections for where case numbers are expected to go. Bloomfield says vaccination rates can be expected to have an impact on the R-value.\", \"He says hospitalisations last week were higher than what was expected, but ICU rates remained low.\", \"Most cases are among the unvaccinated or partially vaccinated, he says, and the impact of vaccination on hospitalisations \\\"is even more profound\\\", as can be seen from the data.\", \"Bloomfield says the low number of deaths from the outbreak so far reflects the number of vaccinations, the younger average age of those infected, and the treatments becoming available in hospital.\", \"He says even in the upper projections, hospitals and ICUs in Auckland will be able to manage.\", \"Bloomfield says there is a low risk of undetected community transmission in Christchurch. He says there are explanations for the positive wastewater testing results.\", \"Ardern says daily case numbers do not say much about how the Covid-19 response is going.\", \"She says she will travel to support Northland's vaccination efforts tomorrow, and on Wednesday will be in Whanganui to support the vaccination teams there.\", \"There were 162 new community cases of Covid-19 reported today, 156 in Auckland and five in Waikato.\", \"More than 3.1 million New Zealanders are now fully vaccinated.\"]","href_hash":"dde3e9c83bad11eca40d000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dde3e9c83bad11eca40d000017025a03"}},
