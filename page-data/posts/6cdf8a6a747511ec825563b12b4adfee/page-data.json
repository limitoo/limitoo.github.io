Gavin Newsom signed a bill that adds $330 million to the available tax credits for film and TV productions in 2022 and 2023, on top of the $330 million that was already budgeted each year through 2025.\", \"The next round of deadlines for applying for film tax credits is approaching at the end of the month.\", \"\\u201cEverybody\\u2019s in the game of luring production, and so this is a highly competitive space,\\u201d said Colleen Bell, the executive director of the California Film Commission, which oversees the program. \\u201cWe continue to maintain our legacy as entertainment production capital of the world. But we can\\u2019t just sit back on our laurels.\\u201d\", \"But the increased investment raises the question: Can these credits actually stop runaway production?\", \"Let\\u2019s start with some history.\", \"More than 20 years ago, Canada and states like New Mexico, Louisiana and Georgia began creating tax perks to attract Hollywood productions. Film employment declined in California.\", \"Fearing the loss of its flagship industry, California created a film tax credit in 2009 for productions that stay in state. The program was greatly expanded in 2014.\", \"In its current form, filmmakers can recoup as much as 25 percent of their spending \\u2014 up to the first $100 million \\u2014 on crew salaries and other costs (star salaries are not eligible).\", \"Since the program began, California has spent $2.5 billion to help fund 591 productions, including toward the salaries of 161,000 people who worked on set. That stimulus generated $19.4 billion in in-state funding, officials say.\", \"But California\\u2019s foothold as the nation\\u2019s entertainment capital continues to slip.\", \"Between 2020 and 2021, the number of scripted TV shows filmed in California dropped by 39 percent, more than any other popular filming location, according to a report from FilmLA. During the same time period, which was disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic, the number of productions in Georgia remained flat while increasing in Utah and Texas.\", \"Many states offer bigger financial incentives than California, making it hard for the state to compete. And critics of the tax incentives point out that they don\\u2019t permanently bring production back, but can start a bidding war between states.\", \"Plus, perhaps surprisingly, money isn\\u2019t everything. In an early analysis of California\\u2019s film tax credit, the state\\u2019s Legislative Analyst\\u2019s Office found that one-third of the projects that received the subsidies probably would have been made in California regardless.\", \"\\u201cWhile the credit probably caused some film and television projects to be made here, many other similar projects also were made here without receiving any financial incentive,\\u201d a 2019 report reads.\", \"In the most recent fiscal year, 18 percent of productions that were denied the film tax credit went ahead with production in California anyway, according to state data.\", \"Still, a local tax incentive is widely viewed as a way to level the playing field. The latest boost to California\\u2019s program includes funding to create more soundstages and to incentivize additional TV shows to relocate.\", \"As Newsom told Variety after the signing of the expanded credits, keeping Hollywood production in California is also a point of pride: \\u201cThis is the world we created now, and in many ways it\\u2019s competing against us.\\u201d\", \"For more:\", \"Masala winter squash.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from Jim Rutledge, a reader who lives in Oakland:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
