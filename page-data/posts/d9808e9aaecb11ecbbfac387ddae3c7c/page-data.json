Ukraine says Russian troops continued shelling the evacuation routes, which were supposed to be safe.\", \"In parts of Mariupol captured by the Russians, reports suggest the civilians - hungry, thirsty and often sick - have little choice but to head out to Russian-controlled areas and Russia itself.\", \"Matt Morris, spokesperson for the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), said the ICRC could only evacuate civilians and deliver aid if Russia and Ukraine provided safety guarantees, and that had not happened yet, though the ICRC was speaking to both sides.\", \"\\\"The sides have to be the guarantors and have an agreement to allow safe passage.

About 5000 refugees are being housed there, in tents, a school and a club.
