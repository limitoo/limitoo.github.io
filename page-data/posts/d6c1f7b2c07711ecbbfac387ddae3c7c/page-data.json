She would have all those ministers going through line by line, saying actually what programmes aren't working, where is that wasted money happening.\\\"\", \"Asked if he would look at delaying the party's plans to cut taxes, he said he would not - that the $1600 that the average household would receive annually would be helpful.\", \"Opening up immigration settings to help businesses get critical workers into the country would also be useful, he said.\", \"Matariki might be a great idea but it will cost the country $450 million so another holiday such as Labour Day should be cancelled.\", \"\\\"How do you throw $450 million of extra cost on business at a time when you're dealing with cost of living and inflation the highest it's been in 30 years and higher than any of our trading partners.\", \"\\\"New Zealand is not doing a good job of managing inflation domestically at the moment because the government is into spending.

At the same time, the big drivers of cost of living pressures are being generated offshore as well as build state houses to help ease the housing crisis.\", \"\\\"In particular the Covid-19 pandemic and the pressure that's put on supply chains, we've got the war in Ukraine now that is putting further pressure on that.
