It\\u2019s as if someone combined \\u201cCops,\\u201d \\u201cF for Fake\\u201d and \\u201cWhen Harry Met Sally.\\u201d\", \"Directed by Alonso Ruizpalacios (\\u201cMuseo\\u201d), the film, from Mexico, initially appears to be a straight documentary. It opens with a sequence in which Teresa, one of the two main police officers, responds to a call about a woman in labor. After Teresa radios to check on an ambulance that isn\\u2019t coming soon enough, she grabs gloves to deliver the baby herself, even though, she says, the academy didn\\u2019t give her medical training.\", \"Exactly what training Teresa has becomes murkier. If the high-stakes situation doesn\\u2019t immediately indicate that \\u201cA Cop Movie\\u201d isn\\u2019t playing by ordinary documentary rules, the splashy wide-screen compositions, use of zooms as punctuation, careful camera setups and subjects\\u2019 habit of commenting toward the viewer all signal that something is up. By the time Teresa is breaking the fourth wall \\u2014 yes, there\\u2019s a fourth wall \\u2014 while cradling a colleague who has been shot, Ruizpalacios is clearly employing dramatization. Narrative expectations come into play when he reveals that Teresa and her partner, Montoya, are romantically involved.\", \"It would be easy to give too much away, but \\u201cA Cop Movie,\\u201d viewed one way, is a fake documentary that establishes its unreliability, then recasts itself as a documentary of a deception. It equates performing official duties with playing a character; the audience\\u2019s distrust may mirror a civilian\\u2019s distrust for authority. And as in the Stanford prison experiment, the uniform makes the officer.\"]","href_hash":"61cc3cfe3d6111ec8344000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"61cc3cfe3d6111ec8344000017025a03"}},
