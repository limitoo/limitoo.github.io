Everybody has their fingers crossed that there are no more frosts and hopefully that will set us up for a significantly increased crop next year.\", \"\\\"But we are expecting over the course of next year that the overall value of wine exports will be down, simply because the shortfall of grapes is quite significant.\\\"\", \"Gregan said strong international demand was helping growers who were still dealing with challenges in the domestic market.\", \"\\\"Wine businesses that sell predominantly through the on-premise and tourism sector continue to experience significant challenges.\", \"\\\"Domestically, restrictions on operations of hospitality businesses are a major stress point for wineries dependent on that sector. Cellar doors have been hit hard by the collapse in international tourist numbers, as well as the impact of current restrictions on regional travel.\\\"\", \"He said more New Zealanders were visiting cellar doors but there were long, lean periods outside of the traditional Kiwi holiday period.\", \"\\\"The best thing that could happen for the sector would be for travel throughout the country to be freed up because that would encourage Aucklanders to travel to wine destinations that they clearly love.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"753c4052411911eca9b2f7c17f2c39f5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"753c4052411911eca9b2f7c17f2c39f5"}},
