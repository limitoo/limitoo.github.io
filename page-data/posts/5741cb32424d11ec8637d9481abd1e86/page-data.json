gathers youth from across the Asia-Pacific region to share their whakaaro on the big issues being faced in the world.\", \"These include the impact of Covid-19, sustainability and climate change, digital futures, and international co-operation between nations.\", \"Te Rangit\\u016bkupu is the APEC M\\u0101ori partnership group which has selected eight rangatahi to attend.\", \"Rangatahi

potential.\", \"\\\"It's just my passion to help M\\u0101ori people and to inspire M\\u0101ori tauira, to realise their true potential is what led me to this forum or to this opportunity.\", \"\\\"For us as rangatahi M\\u0101ori, it gives us a chance to represent other minority groups and give them a voice because at the big events our indigenous perspective isn't really taken into account.\\\"\", \"Muriwai is looking to offer k\\u014drero around digital futures and how digital exclusion can impact minority groups.\", \"Sharing new and diverse perspectives related to kaupapa such as digital futures is something he believes is important as it is the younger generations who will face the outcomes of these issues in the near future.\", \"\\\"The voices of the future event gives the youth an opportunity to give our opinions and perspectives.\", \"\\\"The reason why I think it's important to have a youth perspective is because in the Asia and Pacific demographic, youth actually make up one third of the population and a lot of these topics, all of the choices we made now are going to affect us in the future\", \"\\\"It gives us a chance to make sure that our voices are heard and that our

another.\", \"\\\"I always prefer working within a collective and especially with rangatahi M\\u0101ori because all of us come from different backgrounds.\", \"\\\"It's really awesome to see the diversity amongst M\\u0101ori and the multitudes of voices rather than a homogenized view of M\\u0101oritanga.\", \"\\\"It's a real privilege to work, learn, teach and collaborate.\\\"\", \"Devine has worked within the arts, activism, media and fundraising for indigenous kaupapa, with an ambition to help support and advocate for indigenous groups.\", \"She was looking forward to contributing towards future focused initiatives during the summit aiming to promote inclusivity and diversity.\", \"\\\"We can help contribute to APEC because we already embody this idea of a global, united forum
