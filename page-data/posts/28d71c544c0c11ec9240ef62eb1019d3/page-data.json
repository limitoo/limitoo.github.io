ally Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones.\", \"The move came as US politicians\\u00a0deepened the\\u00a0probe into the rallies that preceded the deadly attack.\", \"The subpoenas included demands for documents and testimony from Mr Stone and Mr Jones, as well as three people accused of organising and promoting the two rallies that took place on January 6.\", \"The Democratic chairman of the panel,\\u00a0Bennie Thompson, said the committee was seeking information about the rallies,\\u00a0which later escalated into an\\u00a0insurrection that \\\"threatened our democracy\\\".\", \"\\\"We need to know who organised, planned, paid for, and received funds related to those events, as well as what communications organisers had with officials in the White House and Congress,\\\" he said.\", \"The subpoenas are the latest to be issued by the panel as it continues its investigation into the day\\u00a0a group of Mr Trump's supporters assaulted police and smashed their way into the Capitol to interrupt the certification of Democrat Joe Biden's victory.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3e3a40595f3c21e0f4748aa8b75ff9c7\\\"

committee has already interviewed more than 150 people across government, social media and law enforcement, including former Trump aides who have been cooperative.\", \"The panel has subpoenaed more than 20 witnesses, including several associates who helped plan the \\\"Stop the Steal\\\" rally on\\u00a0the morning of January 6, who have signalled they will cooperate.\", \"In an investigation by\\u00a0special counsel Robert Mueller, Mr Stone was convicted for lying to Congress about his efforts to gather inside information about Russia-hacked Democratic emails that were published by WikiLeaks ahead of the 2016 presidential election.\", \"Mr Stone was subsequently pardoned by Mr Trump.\", \"The House subpoena notes Mr Stone spoke at rallies on January 5 and used members of a far-right group, the Oath Keepers, as personal security guards while he was in Washington.\", \"In a statement, Mr Stone said he had\\u00a0not yet read the subpoena but said any allegation he was involved was\\u00a0\\\"categorically false.\\\"\", \"\\\"I have said time and time again that I had no advance knowledge of the events that took place at the Capitol on that day,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"After the subpoena is served and after my counsel reviews the requests, I will make the determination of how I will proceed.\\\"\", \"The House panel also wants to hear from Alex Jones, after Mr Thompson said the conspiracy theorist and talk-show host helped organise the January 6 rally at the Ellipse park before the insurrection.\", \"Mr Thompson's letter said Mr Jones repeatedly promoted Mr Trump's claims of election fraud, urged his audience members to come to Washington for the rally, and marched from the Ellipse to the Capitol.\", \"Mr Jones's lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.\", \"Three more subpoenas were issued to Dustin Stockton, Jennifer Lawrence and Taylor Budowich for their alleged involvement in the promotion and organisation of rallies following the 2020 presidential election.\", \"Mr Stockton and Ms Lawrence were key leaders of the \\\"Stop the Steal\\\" movement after the election and helped to organise the rally on January\\u00a06 that preceded the Capitol attack.\\u00a0\", \"The committee alleged Mr Stockton was concerned the Ellipse rally would lead to \\\"possible danger\\\", so he escalated those concerns to then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows.\", \"The couple said they planned to testify and would turn over documents requested by the committee, but denied responsibility for the violence.\\u00a0\", \"Mr Stockton said he had previously reached out to the committee to cooperate voluntarily and\\u00a0Ms Lawrence said they were shocked and horrified by what had happened on January 6.\", \"\\\"We need to get to the bottom of what really happened so we can move forward as a country,\\\" he said.\", \"Mr Budowich, who now serves as Mr Trump's chief spokesperson, did not respond to requests for comment.\", \"Steve Bannon, a long-time ally to Mr Trump,\\u00a0was indicted on on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress after he defied a subpoena from the House committee.\",
