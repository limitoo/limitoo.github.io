They wore seasonal jackets and wind breakers just like other passengers, but one accessory made them stand out: old-fashioned hair curlers locked tightly into their bangs.\", \"These plastic cylinders, usually Velcro-covered, can be seen nearly everywhere around Seoul \\u2014 in cafes and restaurants, on public transportation, on the street.\", \"And while they may seem like a vestige of a previous era, the young women who wear them say they are not only functional but also a sign of shifting ideas about gender and beauty and a reflection of the country\\u2019s generational divide.\", \"Jung Yoon-won, a 23-year-old college student in Seoul who uses curlers daily, said she wore them outside her home to maintain the perfect curl in her bangs before going to an event or meeting. She said her mother had asked her to stop, fearing others would find it inappropriate.\", \"But for Ms. Jung, appearance matters more at the destination than on the way there. \\u201cYou only have to look good in front of the people you care about,\\u201d she said.\", \"That independent attitude is shared among many younger people who don\\u2019t feel beholden to the conventions that were once strictly observed in South Korean society. Young people today say they are less concerned about what other people think and are choosing instead to live more carefree.\", \"Ms. Jung doesn\\u2019t view curlers as a relic of the past, but as a tool to help her look put together as she zips across the city from one place to the next.\", \"\\u201cThere is a notion that women today should always have their hair be presentable,\\u201d she said. She bristled at the idea that she was supporting antiquated beauty standards or clinging to the days when going outside in Seoul without perfect hair and makeup was like leaving the house without wearing clothes.\", \"Unlike previous generations of women who felt it was necessary to get ready in private, hidden from the sight of men, she and others care much less if their grooming efforts are visible, Ms. Jung said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why it doesn\\u2019t matter if you have a curler in on the subway or cafe.\\u201d\", \"Hair rollers in South Korea are typically worn in bangs. Costing as little as 80 cents apiece, they are accessible and affordable for most women. Korean celebrities often post pictures on social media sporting curlers. Older women are both intrigued and mystified by the phenomenon.\", \"Lee Jeong-jin, 51, has a 21-year-old daughter who frequently wears curlers outside the house, much to her mother\\u2019s disappointment. Ms. Lee, who lives near Seoul, said it\\u2019s not unusual for young people to have a \\u201cso what\\u201d attitude.\", \"She can relate. Using hair spray to create tall, voluminous hairstyles was the trend in South Korea when she was in her teens, she said. \\u201cI\\u2019m pretty sure the older generation thought we were the weird ones back then,\\u201d she said.\", \"Yet Kim Ji-in, 54, sees the hair curlers as part of a broader shift among young women who feel they should be allowed to behave as they choose in public, without having to follow expectations about beauty and gender.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve seen one woman in her 20s sitting on the subway floor with her makeup sprawled out in front of her,\\u201d she said. In her time, it was unthinkable for a woman to go outside with rollers in her hair, she added.\", \"Resistance to South Korea\\u2019s often-rigid beauty standards and restrictive views about gender is not new. After #MeToo allegations swept the country a few years ago, some women responded with \\u201cEscape the Corset,\\u201d a movement in which they abandoned makeup and wore bowl cuts to protest oppressive beliefs about physical attractiveness.\", \"Still, the country has one of the world\\u2019s leading beauty industries, accounting for almost 3 percent of the global beauty market in 2019, according to the International Trade Administration, a U.S. government agency.\", \"The South Korean cosmetics industry has flourished despite the pandemic. Amorepacific, one of the nation\\u2019s largest beauty conglomerates, reported an 8.5 percent year-on-year increase in sales in the first quarter of 2021. Exports in beauty products also rose by 16 percent from the previous year, according to the Korea Trade Association.\", \"But increasingly, young people say they prefer to come as they are.\", \"Kim Dong-wan, a 25-year-old researcher in Seoul, said he was confused when he first saw women wearing hair curlers in public about six years ago. Now he says that he\\u2019s \\u201cindifferent,\\u201d and that women nowadays are less likely to be pressured to hide such things and are also demanding more respect. \\u201cTimes have changed so much,\\u201d he said.\", \"While older South Koreans may not approve of the use of hair curlers in public, Yoon Da-young, a 22-year-old student in Seoul, said it\\u2019s not their place to understand youth culture or why teenagers and women in their 20s would proudly step outside with curlers in their hair. \\u201cThe trend is to wear them out now,\\u201d she said.\", \"Young women just want to be able to \\u201cdo what they want in peace.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"414737e04ac211ecb4db493ab2fe7616"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"414737e04ac211ecb4db493ab2fe7616"}},
