The Stella piece had previously been exhibited at the Aldrich Contemporary Art Museum in Connecticut and was in Stella\\u2019s studio upstate when Silverstein reached out, looking for a new piece for the site. (He declined to say what he paid Stella for the work.)\", \"\\u201cJasper\\u2019s Split Star\\u201d is constructed out of six small geometric grids that rest on an aluminum base shaped roughly like a flower petal. From a certain angle, it looks enough like a jungle gym that one spectator said aloud, \\u201cI\\u2019m wondering when the first kid is going to climb on it. I give it three hours.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s a homecoming of sorts for Stella, who had two large-scale paintings grace the lobby of the original Seven World Trade Center, both of which were lost when the building was destroyed on 9/11. The sculpture is loosely based on Stella\\u2019s own 1962 painting, \\u201cJasper\\u2019s Dilemma,\\u201d which features two abstract, almost mathematically precise panels, one vibrantly colored, the other rendered in dour gray, and was itself inspired by a quote from Jasper Johns: \\u201cThe more I paint in color, the more I see everything in black and white.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cHe may have said that,\\u201d Stella said of the inspiration behind the work, \\u201cbut I certainly forgot it.\\u201d Of Johns, a contemporary (he\\u2019s 91) and the current subject of a retrospective at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum, the latter just a couple of subway stops from 7 World Trade Center, Stella added, \\u201cI was always tremendously impressed by the way he laid the paint down.\\u201d\", \"Stella said that seeing the Johns show at the Whitney had him thinking about the past \\u2014 namely the Leo Castelli Gallery, the legendary art dealer Stella shared with Johns, and where both had their first solo shows many decades ago. \\u201cIt was really quiet and comfortable, and you just had to go and see what everyone was doing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd then you got to eat Chinese food after that. After 1980, it was over. Or over for me. Jasper was older by then \\u2014 and it turned out I was old too by then, but I didn\\u2019t know it.\\u201d\", \"What he liked about Castelli was that \\u201cit was so straightforward,\\u201d a quality shared by Stella and his work. He once famously described painting as \\u201ca flat surface with paint on it, nothing more.\\u201d He\\u2019s still good for a laconic quip. Asked if there was too much money in the contemporary art world, he groaned and said, \\u201cNot enough.\\u201d And of the auction houses, Sotheby\\u2019s and Christie\\u2019s, where his work has sold for up to eight figures \\u2014 his auction high was $28.1 million, at Christie\\u2019s in May 2019, for \\u201cPoint of Pines,\\u201d which he painted at the age of 23 \\u2014 he said, \\u201cBy and large, they\\u2019re pretty chicken.\\u201d (Somewhat surprisingly, he\\u2019s a fan of the Oculus Transportation Hub, home to many subway lines, which juts out of the Financial District like a rib cage and is visible from 7 World Trade Center. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a miracle that got built,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s nothing else like it.\\u201d)\", \"Stella and the rest of the early Castelli roster \\u2014 which also included Roy Lichtenstein, Robert Rauschenberg, James Rosenquist and Andy Warhol \\u2014 were among the most scrutinized artists in history, their aesthetic decisions tracked and decoded as if their work were the Rosetta Stone for understanding American culture.\", \"\\u201cPeople used to talk about artists and say things like, \\u2018Oh, now he\\u2019s lost it,\\u2019\\u201d Stella said. \\u201cAnd what now seems like minuscule phases and changes in the work were at the time the end of a career. It was kind of a joke. But it was serious in the way people reacted to it.\\u201d For a period of time, the star \\u2014 a shape that recurs in Stella\\u2019s work, and which he began using in the 1960s \\u2014 was something the artist wouldn\\u2019t go near. The name \\u201cStella\\u201d is Italian for star, and he worried the work was too on the nose.\", \"Of course, that didn\\u2019t seem to matter much anymore. One benefit of getting older, he said, is that \\u201cyou get tired of worrying about those kinds of things, and you just go with it.\\u201d Gesturing at his work, he concluded, \\u201cI mean, it\\u2019s hard to pass this up.\\u201d\", \"Silverstein, 90, the developer of the original Seven World Trade Center as well as its reconstruction after 9/11, was responsible for bringing Stella into this environment. During construction of the building, which opened in 1987 and was designed by Emery Roth and sons, Silverstein had become enamored with a certain kind of granite, which he used for the lobby. \\u201cI put it on the floors, the walls, the ceilings, the toilets,\\u201d he said in a phone call. \\u201cEverything! When it was finished, I looked at the lobby and I realized it looked like a mausoleum.\\u201d\", \"This caused him and his wife to start looking at contemporary art for the space in order to \\u201cmake it come alive.\\u201d In this way, they stumbled upon Stella, whose work became a kind of center of gravity. People would collect in front of it in the morning on their way up to work, along with other works the Silversteins acquired.\", \"Silverstein and his wife now live about a block away from 7 World Trade Center. They moved from Midtown after a realization in their old building\\u2019s elevator that all of their neighbors were \\u201ca bunch of old fogies like us,\\u201d as Silverstein put it. \\u201cAnd I finally said, I think it\\u2019s time to get the hell out of here.\\u201d This area, lurching back to life after a mass exodus during the pandemic, is noticeably more vibrant. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got baby carriages and mothers and pets,\\u201d Silverstein continued. \\u201cI don\\u2019t know where they got the money to pay for these apartments, but they\\u2019re young. It\\u2019s phenomenal.\\u201d\", \"And in Stella\\u2019s work, they\\u2019ll have a new local landmark. \\u201cIt\\u2019s permanent as long as Larry leaves it there,\\u201d Stella said with practiced nonchalance. As the crane lowered the final section into place \\u2014 \\u201cthe last piece of the puzzle,\\u201d he joked \\u2014 the artist admired the way the sun was hitting the work. The colors were vibrant, but they didn\\u2019t hit you over the head. They were subtle. \\u201cLike Jasper,\\u201d Stella said.\"]","href_hash":"ef3487fc4bd211ec83296d2986973fbb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ef3487fc4bd211ec83296d2986973fbb"}},
