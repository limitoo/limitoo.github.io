The old saw has it that the cobbler\\u2019s children go barefoot. It\\u2019s something I think about every time Thanksgiving rolls around. I spend weeks outlining plans for others, encouraging work-aheads for the freezer and the fridge, so that Thanksgiving Day (above) isn\\u2019t an ultramarathon for anyone. Then, for myself, on the actual day, I wake up in inky darkness and cook the meal all at once. It\\u2019s exciting to do that, but it\\u2019s not anything I\\u2019d recommend to those who don\\u2019t like living life on the edge, to those who don\\u2019t thrill to driving around on the bottom eighth of a tank of gas.\", \"So I hope you\\u2019ve planned your play. Tomorrow you can play your plan.\", \"Some won\\u2019t be cooking for the hordes, of course. Melissa Clark has written beautifully about the pleasures of cooking Thanksgiving for two. (You can find dozens more recipes for a small Thanksgiving here.) And no matter how many you cook for, you may find value in this YouTube video of our staffers sharing their best Thanksgiving tips.\", \"Others won\\u2019t be cooking Thanksgiving at all, but instead attending the feast as a guest and, perhaps, considering recipes for Hanukkah, which gets underway on Sunday evening. For them, and perhaps for you, we have three new ones from Melissa: for olive oil chocolate cake, for melomakarona, Greek olive oil-honey cookies and for an olive oil lemon curd. (Other recipes from the files to consider: this stellar classic beef brisket with caramelized onions; these pure potato latkes; these orange-scented jelly doughnuts.)\", \"And for everyone else: tips for tomorrow. Make sure to defrost your pie dough and crusts tonight if you\\u2019ve frozen them, along with your breads and stocks. You might assemble and bake pies tonight as well \\u2014 you can leave them out at room temperature overnight if they\\u2019re not custard-based, in which case you can pop them into the fridge. You could put together a few side dishes that can be baked this evening and reheated tomorrow, or baked tomorrow, depending. (In that line, a green-bean casserole, a sweet potato casserole, some Southern cornbread dressing.)\", \"You could chop vegetables now. You could whisk up make-ahead gravy (here\\u2019s a vegan version). It\\u2019s not too late to wet-brine your turkey (nor to massage your bird with salt and allow it to dry overnight in the fridge). And you should absolutely, if you can, set the table before you go to bed. Dragoon some children in the morning to write place cards.\", \"And make sure to eat dinner. You don\\u2019t need a recipe for that. Instead, make a freestyle black-pepper chicken stir-fry. You\\u2019ll need a couple shallots; some ginger; brown sugar; fish sauce; rice vinegar; sriracha or really any fiery Asian chile sauce; boneless, skinless chicken thighs; and a lot of coarsely ground black pepper, with chopped scallions or cilantro to finish everything off. Slice the shallots and mince the ginger, and get them all soft in an oil-filmed pan set over medium-high heat. Add everything else but the chicken and let it reduce into syrup. Then dice the thighs and add them to the pan, and let them cook through. Dinner over rice, adorned by the green!\", \"Thousands and thousands of actual recipes are waiting for you on New York Times Cooking. It\\u2019s true that you need a subscription to access them. Subscriptions support our work. This Thanksgiving I am grateful for yours. And I hope if you don\\u2019t have one already, that you will subscribe today. Thanks.\", \"We\\u2019re standing by like EMTs, in case anything goes wrong while you\\u2019re cooking or using our technology. Just write cookingcare@nytimes.com and someone will get back to you. (That\\u2019s true for tomorrow as well, at least until 5 p.m., Eastern time.)\", \"Now, speaking of no-recipe recipes: Our cookbook of those made it into this Vanity Fair compilation of the best cookbooks of 2021.\", \"Here\\u2019s last year\\u2019s Questlove Thanksgiving playlist on Spotify. Tradition!\", \"Your turkey is done when its internal temperature, read at the fleshiest part of the thigh, is 165 degrees. That temperature will continue to rise after you\\u2019ve removed the bird from the oven, so you can pull it at 160 and be perfectly safe.\", \"Finally, relax. Everything is going to be all right. I believe in you.\"]","href_hash":"df2c683e4d4411ec9e025326e97e4f58"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"df2c683e4d4411ec9e025326e97e4f58"}},
