moment the 80 per cent easing occurred and retail reopened on October 29.\", \"In the\\u00a0hour around 7pm at Bourke Street Mall, there was a 881 per cent surge on the previous month's average foot traffic past David Jones and Myer.\", \"And it wasn't a one-off, with data from last week suggesting the CBD is seeing a decent bump in visitors compared to lockdown in October.\", \"Those heading out on Melbourne's roads\\u00a0would be right in thinking the city is heading back towards the chronically congested norm.\", \"Which some have found oddly soothing.\", \"Mobility across the state, as measured through the number of route requests made in Apple's maps app, had been creeping up slowly for weeks.\", \"But it has surged since the lockdown ended, with driving route requests back to levels higher than were normally seen pre-pandemic.\", \"The transport department said there were still fewer peak hour trips occurring to and from the CBD than before the pandemic began, but localised journeys were higher than pre-pandemic levels.\", \"The government said it had also observed an increase in cars on the road in some regional centres.\", \"<img

Highway heading into Torquay.\", \"Public transport usage\\u00a0is still down on pre-lockdown levels, possibly as people opt for a car while cases remain high.\", \"But the early signs of a return are there, with around 3.5 million users in the final week of October, compared to a lockdown low of 1.6 million in late September.\\u00a0\", \"And don't forget, lots of Victorians are still working from home.\", \"The state's current settings encourage people to work from home if they can, but allow for fully vaccinated employees to work on site.\", \"When 90 per cent of the 12+ population are vaccinated, the roadmap offers a more enthusiastic endorsement to get back into the office.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">We're planning trips to enjoy the opened economy</div>\", \"A glance at what Victorians have been searching online is also revealing.\", \"While there were some half-hearted searches for picnic inspiration during lockdown, it's searches for restaurants that soared in October as the state stepped out of restrictions.\", \"Victoria's hotels are slowly beginning to fill up, with\\u00a0hospitality data analytics company STR noting a surge in Victorian hotel occupancy from

numbers are moving in the right direction</div>\", \"It's less clear what all of this might mean for COVID-19 cases.\", \"Burnet Institute modelling forecasts another peak in cases around December-January, which hopefully won't be accompanied by a huge spike in hospitalisations, thanks to the state's extremely high vaccination coverage.\", \"But so far, in both New South Wales and in
