The United States provides the powerful gyro devices used to maintain the lab's orientation and supplies the lion's share of the station's electrical power.\", \"A Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ship launched last week is the first U.S. craft since the now-retired shuttle that is capable of raising the station's altitude, but it cannot take the place of Russian propulsion systems.\", \"And in any case, Russian cosmonauts are not trained to operate U.S. systems and NASA astronauts cannot operate Russia's. The space station is, in the end, a truly international project that requires both superpowers, working together, to function.\", \"\\\"Currently, there is no plan, it would be very difficult for us to be operating on our own,\\\" Lueders said. \\\"The ISS is an international partnership ... with joint dependencies. It's a place where we live and operate in space in a peaceful manner. That's really a model for us to be operating in the future.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It would be a sad day for international operations if we can't continue to peacefully operate in space,\\\" she added. \\\"And as a team, we are doing that.\\\"\", \"Lueders is one of the highest level NASA managers yet to comment on space station operations amid the ongoing crisis in Ukraine, providing a stark contrast to a barrage of sarcastic tweets from Dmitri Rogozin, director of Russia's space program.\", \"On Monday, he noted that the United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket that will be used to send Boeing's Starliner commercial crew capsule to the space station is powered by Russia's RD-180 first stage engine. He implied the rocket's perfect successful record was the result of Russian specialists who may not be supporting upcoming flights.\", \"\\\"Well, let's pray for our American friends,\\\" he tweeted.\", \"\\u0412\\u044b\\u0432\\u043e\\u0434\\u0438\\u0442\\u044c\\u0441\\u044f \\u0432 \\u043a\\u043e\\u0441\\u043c\\u043e\\u0441 \\u044d\\u0442\\u043e\\u0442 \\u043a\\u043e\\u0440\\u0430\\u0431\\u043b\\u044c \\u0431\\u0443\\u0434\\u0435\\u0442 \\u043d\\u0430 \\u0440\\u0430\\u043a\\u0435\\u0442\\u0435 \\\"Atlas 5\\\" \\u0441 \\u043d\\u0430\\u0448\\u0438\\u043c \\u043c\\u0430\\u0440\\u0448\\u0435\\u0432\\u044b\\u043c \\u0434\\u0432\\u0438\\u0433\\u0430\\u0442\\u0435\\u043b\\u0435\\u043c \\u0420\\u0414-180 \\u043d\\u0430 \\u043f\\u0435\\u0440\\u0432\\u043e\\u0439 \\u0441\\u0442\\u0443\\u043f\\u0435\\u043d\\u0438. \\u041d\\u043e \\u0443\\u0436\\u0435 \\u0431\\u0435\\u0437 \\u043d\\u0430\\u0434\\u0437\\u043e\\u0440\\u0430 \\u043d\\u0430\\u0448\\u0438\\u0445 \\u0441\\u043f\\u0435\\u0446\\u043e\\u0432. \\u0427\\u0442\\u043e \\u0436, \\u043f\\u043e\\u043c\\u043e\\u043b\\u0438\\u043c\\u0441\\u044f \\u0437\\u0430 \\u043d\\u0430\\u0448\\u0438\\u0445 \\u0430\\u043c\\u0435\\u0440\\u0438\\u043a\\u0430\\u043d\\u0441\\u043a\\u0438\\u0445 \\u0434\\u0440\\u0443\\u0437\\u0435\\u0439!https://t.co/3QFeSZOj4u\", \"ULA is transitioning to a new rocket, the all-American Vulcan, and the company already has stockpiled all the RD-180s it needs to complete the Atlas program.
