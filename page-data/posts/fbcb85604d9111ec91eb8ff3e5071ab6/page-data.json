PPE, equipment, and appliances need to be decontaminated before leaving the incident ground to reduce any chance of unwanted products being transferred.\\\"\", \"The Takanini fire occurred six months later.\", \"The conflict between FENZ and the union has come to a head following the Ponsonby Intermediate school fire a year ago.\", \"Though this fire released asbestos across the inner Auckland neighbourhood, forcing the evacuation of some houses for weeks, FENZ did not do an operational review. In its OIA response, it said it had instead done a \\\"hot debrief\\\" straight after the fire. RNZ has requested details of that debrief.\", \"Decontamination of firefighters was \\\"in line with best particulate suppression practices\\\", Fenz said.\", \"It is updating how it deals with asbestos using a model developed in Australia for dealing with carcinogens.\", \"Auckland regional public health has not released to RNZ details of the outcome of a debrief of the Ponsonby fire, which the service had said it would be part of to see what could be improved.\", \"It says it is too busy due to the pandemic.\", \"Public health has said it relies on FENZ as the lead agency. However, the inquiry into Sky City convention centre fire made clear prior to the Ponsonby fire that FENZ is not responsible under its legal mandate for monitoring air quality or alerting the public when it is bad, even though the public might expect it to be.\", \"FENZ says it received two safety notices - called Provisional Improvement Notices - but argues these were not validly issued.\", \"However, it says it responded anyway, telling the health and safety rep it takes management of asbestos \\\"extremely seriously\\\", that it meets legal requirements, and that \\\"work is being done to ensure we are up-to-date with all industry requirements\\\".\", \"\\\"We have clear procedures for both the identification and decontamination of asbestos.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"fbcb85604d9111ec91eb8ff3e5071ab6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fbcb85604d9111ec91eb8ff3e5071ab6"}},
