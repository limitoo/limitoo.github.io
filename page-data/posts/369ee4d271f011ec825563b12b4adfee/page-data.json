Total incompetence! Like on everything else. If they seriously didn't want him, why on earth did they give him a visa to fly here? This was conceived as one giant distraction strategy when out in the real world people can't get tested,\\\" Rudd said on Twitter.\\u00a0\", \"Other politicians are also taking the opportunity to criticize Morrison for losing the court hearing to the 20-time Grand Slam champion.\\u00a0\", \"Senator for South Australia Sarah Hanson-Young slammed Morrison, saying \\\"the level of incompetence in the Morrison government is staggering\\\".\", \"The Deputy Leader of the Opposition Kristina Keneally said: \\\"Mr Morrison can't manage the vaccine rollout.\\u00a0 Can't manage rapid antigen tests.
