And, for even more, what if the model were a version of the recently discontinued Ref. 5711, the steel Nautilus, one of the most coveted wristwatches in the world?\", \"Well, then you would have the equivalent of a horological unicorn, the hypothetical value of which might rewrite the record book for secondhand watch sales.\", \"Until today, the luxury watch world was not aware of such a timepiece. But fantasy is to meet reality later this month, when the model is scheduled to be delivered to Tiffany locations in New York; Beverly Hills, Calif.; and San Francisco.\", \"Known as Ref. 5711/1A-018, this Nautilus will be limited to 170 pieces to honor the 170th anniversary of Patek Philippe\\u2019s partnership with Tiffany \\u2014 including one piece that the retailer is planning to consign to Phillips for its New York watch auction on Saturday, with proceeds benefiting The Nature Conservancy, a global environmental organization.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve been working so long with Tiffany,\\u201d Thierry Stern, Patek Phillipe\\u2019s president, said on a video call in mid-November. \\u201cIt\\u2019s our oldest retailer in the U.S. I grew up with Tiffany and I\\u2019m not even talking about business; it was a part of my family.\\u201d\", \"The business arrangement between the firms dates from 1851, when Tiffany became the Swiss company\\u2019s first authorized U.S. dealer. Over the years, the agreement has survived numerous ownership changes, including the Stern family\\u2019s purchase of the watchmaker in 1932 and the $16.2 billion acquisition of Tiffany, completed in January, by LVMH Mo\\u00ebt Hennessy Louis Vuitton.\", \"Mr. Stern said he wanted to signal to Tiffany that \\u201cyou have been doing a good job,\\u201d especially now that the important step of its sale to LVMH has been taken.\", \"But, \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure it\\u2019s a gift for them,\\u201d he added. \\u201cIt may be a big problem. They may not realize how difficult it\\u2019s going to be to choose the clients.\\u201d\", \"That may be the understatement of the year. The frenzy that is sure to erupt among longtime Patek Philippe collectors and important Tiffany clients over those 170 timepieces is likely to be almost unprecedented.\", \"Introduced in 2006, the Ref. 5711 \\u2014 itself a refined version of the original 1976 Nautilus, a stainless steel luxury sport watch influenced by nautical motifs and designed by the celebrated Gerald Genta \\u2014 has long been one of the industry\\u2019s most prized wristwatches. But around the start of the coronavirus pandemic, prices for pre-owned pieces started to climb. Earlier this year, when Patek Philippe announced it was discontinuing the model, the secondary market reacted by pricing it at nearly four times its $34,890 retail value.\", \"In February, Mr. Stern said that collectors, some of whom had added their names to waiting lists that were eight, even 10, years long, could find hope in his decision to give the model \\u201ca victory lap.\\u201d (Patek Philippe sells its timepieces through a tightly controlled network of retailers around the world.)\", \"\\u201cWe will have a surprise final series of the Ref. 5711,\\u201d Mr. Stern said then. \\u201cAnd it is not what was left in the pipeline.\\u201d\", \"That victory lap was the Ref. 5711-1A-014, a highly sought-after olive green dial version introduced in April, with the same $34,890 price. Three months later, one piece, still in its factory-sealed packaging, sold for 416,000 euros, or $466,625, at an Antiquorum auction in Monaco.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m confident that if a Tiffany-signed green dial surfaced, it would bring $800,000,\\u201d said John Reardon, the founder of Collectability, an educational platform and online reseller of vintage Patek Philippes. (Mr. Reardon was commenting generally on retailer-signed dials, not the Tiffany Blue watch in particular.)\", \"Double-signed watches were relatively popular in the 20th century, when watchmakers, including Patek Philippe and Rolex, honored their relationships with retailers such as Serpico y Laino in Caracas, Venezuela; Beyer in Zurich; and Freccero & Cia. in Montevideo, Uruguay, by stamping the names on the faces of their timepieces. But the models were not always in demand.\", \"\\u201cTwenty years ago, I had a number of collectors refer to retailer signatures on a Patek Philippe dial as nothing but graffiti,\\u201d Mr. Reardon said.\", \"Now, he continued, collectors prize original condition above all else. \\u201cWhen you find a beautiful dial with a retailer signature, it often indicates the dial is original and unrestored,\\u201d Mr. Reardon said. \\u201cThese retailer-signed Patek Philippe iconic references are considered benchmark trophies.\\u201d\", \"For reasons that may have to do with Tiffany\\u2019s enduring relationship with Patek Philippe, Tiffany-signed pieces have a particular \\u201cmagic\\u201d and tend to go to loyal collectors rather than opportunists chasing a fast buck, Mr. Reardon said. (Indeed, the company is the only retailer in the world whose name continues to appear on a Patek Philippe dial.)\", \"\\u201cEverything has a price, but not for these collectors,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat Tiffany signature is to them something sacred, something priceless and something to be kept in their families.\\u201d\", \"The new model will be $52,635. A spokeswoman for Patek Philippe said the higher price was related to the additional work involved in customizing and producing a small series.\", \"Tiffany executives were not available to comment on the watch. (Mr. Stern said he had discussed the limited edition with Alexandre Arnault, Tiffany\\u2019s executive vice president of product and communications. His father, Bernard Arnault, is LVMH\\u2019s chief executive.) But it is one more innovation since the LVMH takeover \\u2014 joining the collaboration with Supreme, the Beyonc\\u00e9 and Jay-Z ad campaign and the house\\u2019s first-ever line of men\\u2019s engagement rings \\u2014 raising the buzz level around the heritage brand.\", \"Mr. Stern alluded to another detail that may make the model, and the retailer, even more buzzworthy: In addition to a commemorative inscription on the sapphire crystal caseback that reads \\u201c170th Anniversary 1851-2021 Tiffany & Co. \\u2014 Patek Philippe,\\u201d the watch includes what moviemakers and software companies call an Easter egg.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m very curious to see how long it\\u2019s going to take people to discover that there is a secret on every piece,\\u201d Mr. Stern said.\", \"He paused before adding a comment that seemed to acknowledge what many in the watch world might ask when they read about the limited edition: Is Patek Philippe for sale, and will the buyer be Tiffany\\u2019s parent company?\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s fun; it\\u2019s not commercial,\\u201d Mr. Stern said about the Easter egg. \\u201cAnd only a family business can do that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a4ae99e8568611ec9e896ffbdf258fa5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a4ae99e8568611ec9e896ffbdf258fa5"}},
