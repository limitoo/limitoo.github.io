It is a self-regulating move by Facebook, ugh, Meta, given all the controversies over the collection of personal facial data by tech giants and the government\\u2019s use of their products: invasion of privacy, racial inequity and wrongful arrests, to name a few. Hitting the delete button was not on anyone\\u2019s list of things Meta might do, although this move ought to put pressure on others, like Amazon, which has received its fair share of criticism for the Rekognition face reading software that it has supplied to cops.\", \"Whatever the real reason for the change of heart at Meta (and we\\u2019ll likely never know absent another whistle-blower), it\\u2019s good the company took this step. Though it\\u2019s worth highlighting that it evidently applies only to Facebook itself and not other divisions like Instagram or, notably, Meta\\u2019s long-term metaverse project.\", \"Jerome Pesenti, who heads Meta\\u2019s artificial intelligence unit, was refreshingly plain in a blog post explaining the move. \\u201cMany specific instances where facial recognition can be helpful need to be weighed against growing concerns about the use of this technology as a whole,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cThere are many concerns about the place of facial recognition technology in society, and regulators are still in the process of providing a clear set of rules governing its use. Amid this ongoing uncertainty, we believe that limiting the use of facial recognition to a narrow set of use cases is appropriate.\\u201d\", \"Yet this shouldn\\u2019t be the end of the discussion. If ever an issue cried out for some lawmaking guidance, this is it.\", \"The new Amazon chief executive, Andy Jassy, spoke to the government\\u2019s role in an interview with me way back in 2019, when he was head of the company\\u2019s cloud computing division, in addressing the range of problems that had already cropped up around Rekognition. Jassy said he thought a company like his should not be the moral arbiter of the world and that he thought it was up to lawmakers to step up.\", \"\\u201cPeople are looking for those extra set of protections around the federal government explaining how they want the technology to be used and having real ramifications if you misuse it,\\u201d he told me. \\u201cI wish they\\u2019d hurry up, because if they don\\u2019t, what\\u2019s happening is you\\u2019re going to have 50 different laws in 50 different states and you\\u2019re going to have some that overreach.\\u201d\", \"Jassy was correct that the lion\\u2019s share of rule-making responsibility lies with the government, though Amazon and its ilk have some responsibility, too. And the ability to anticipate consequences and step up is what Meta is showing in its decision to rein in its facial recognition ambitions, even if the timing, amid all the whistle-blower revelations, make it feel performative and like an attempt to divert attention from mounting lawsuits.\", \"My bet is that lobbyists for Meta, Amazon and others won\\u2019t sit on the sidelines of any government discussion of facial recognition regulation. Expect these companies to \\u201chelp\\u201d draft regulations to work in their favor. That may even be the point of Meta\\u2019s move to pull back \\u2014 get the rules where Meta wants them before diving right back in and nip that government \\u201coverreach\\u201d concern of Jassy\\u2019s in the bud.\", \"In the meantime, it\\u2019s not as though Meta is leaving the arena altogether. A spokesman told The New York Times that while the company plans to delete more than one billion facial recognition scans, \\u201cit will not eliminate the software that powers the system\\u201d \\u2014 ominously called DeepFace \\u2014 and wouldn\\u2019t rule out incorporating the software into products in the future.\", \"Oh, I get it: The fine print.\", \"This week I chatted about the metaverse with Ethan Zuckerman, an associate professor of public policy, communication and information at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, and director of the Institute for Digital Public Infrastructure, a research group studying and building alternatives to the existing commercial internet. We\\u2019ve edited his answers.\", \"You recently wrote a piece in The Atlantic about the metaverse being an old idea and not particularly good technology. If you had to pick one major issue with creating it anew today, what would it be?\", \"It\\u2019s so hard to pick a single issue. My article argues that Mark Zuckerberg\\u2019s metaverse is pretty boring \\u2014 it\\u2019s yet another rehash of ideas articulated in the early 1990s and tried dozens of times since then.\", \"My specific complaint is this: We are now discovering that interactions on social networks can be harmful for individuals and for society as a whole. Facebook\\u2019s properties are where a great number of these harmful interactions are happening. Do we really want the company that\\u2019s shown very little willingness to mitigate online harms to create a new online space in which brand-new sorts of harms are possible? Shouldn\\u2019t Facebook demonstrate that it can combat hate speech before we invent a new way of creating hateful 3-D animations that are fed directly to our eyeballs?\", \"Some have suggested this is a (virtual) land grab by Meta, given how many others have worked on aspects of the core idea of the metaverse, a physical and digital mash-up. Do you agree? And, if so, who is most vulnerable as this behemoth wades in?\", \"About 40 minutes into the Meta launch video, Zuckerberg talks about how the power that technology platform companies have to \\u201cstifle\\u201d innovation is what he fears the most. He\\u2019s talking about Apple, and specifically about Apple\\u2019s steps to allow iOS users to easily block tracking in apps like Facebook. The metaverse is the one area in which Facebook has a meaningful play to become like Apple \\u2014 the manufacturer of hardware, operating systems and applications.\", \"So, the land grab is primarily intended to seize land from Apple and, to a lesser extent, Google. In the process, Zuckerberg may end up trampling smaller companies that have been building metaverses for many years. Or he may end up swallowing those companies, making their founders very rich, and incorporating their tech into his metaverse plans.\", \"What do you make of this idea that the so-called singularity \\u2014 a mash-up of man and machine \\u2014 will actually precede the arrival of the metaverse?\", \"I may be skeptical of the metaverse but I\\u2019m way more skeptical of the singularity.\", \"The singularity imagines a world in which our consciousness can transcend our bodies, where the virtual world of the metaverse would be the collective space our disembodied consciousness inhabits. Every few years, someone writes a book assuring us that the rate of technological change is so high that computers will increase beyond the complexity of the human brain and either we will be uploadable into the Matrix or machine intelligence will so outpace human intelligence that the machines will be where it\\u2019s at.\", \"I\\u2019m skeptical because human bodies are hard. I\\u2019ve been a Type 1 diabetic for more than 35 years. Get me a functional mechanical pancreas that can actually manage my chronic disease as well as I manage it with insulin shots and then maybe we can talk about uploading my consciousness into silicon.\", \"If you could imagine an ideal functioning metaverse, what do you think would be the best use for it?\", \"There are some specific uses for complex virtual reality spaces that are incredibly useful. I\\u2019m struck by Jeremy Bailenson\\u2019s work at Stanford where he uses V.R. to train people in tasks \\u2014 firefighting, bomb disposal \\u2014 that are dangerous to learn any other way. I also think collaborative. V.R. spaces can be very useful for people who find parts of the physical world inaccessible. The V.R. online game Second Life has been very useful for people with physical limitations to encounter each other in an embodied way.\", \"And I suspect game spaces will take great advantage of metaverses. The shared Minecraft server my 11-year-old son runs, combined with FaceTime for voice chat, provides lots of what he\\u2019d like out of a metaverse, but assembled from individual pieces. As for moving my work life into a 3-D simulation \\u2014 no, no thank you. Teaching over Zoom has been enough of a mixed bag.\", \"Why do you think Meta is making so much noise about this tech now? Is it because Facebook itself is dying a slow death?\", \"I don\\u2019t fully buy Kevin Roose\\u2019s argument that Facebook is dying. Perhaps in the U.S., where the cool kids have moved onto TikTok, but in much of the world, Facebook\\u2019s products \\u2014 particularly WhatsApp \\u2014 are the internet. I do, however, think Zuckerberg may think that Facebook is dying because he defines his success as being on the cutting edge of tech development and interesting new engineering problems. Focusing on the metaverse allows Facebook to ignore pesky, hard-to-solve problems like limiting disinformation and online harassment and move onto something more exciting for the engineers. It\\u2019s up to the rest of us to make sure that Facebook doesn\\u2019t get to ignore the problems it has created just because it wants to cook up a new batch of problems.\", \"Glenn Youngkin, the first Republican elected governor in Virginia in a dozen years, did a masterful job at being Donald Trump-lite (certainly not my cup of tea). And he was aided, unexpectedly, by the former president\\u2019s continued absence from social media, particularly Twitter, where Trump would otherwise be a daily reminder for Virginia voters of whom they shunned in 2020.It\\u2019ll be interesting to see if Youngkin \\u2014 who rode to victory by prodding at parental worries about teaching critical race theory in schools \\u2014 will follow through on his anti-tech rhetoric once in office. In May, the former co-chief executive of the private-equity powerhouse Carlyle Group took to Facebook, without a whiff of irony, to whine in a video about tech companies\\u2019 censorship of conservatives.\\u201cOur right to free speech and religion is the bedrock of this country, and it\\u2019s threatened like never before,\\u201d Youngkin said in the video. \\u201cA handful of California mega-corporations are deciding who can say what.\\u201dHe pledged, \\u201cAs governor, I will stop big tech from canceling your First Amendment rights.\\u201d Never mind that Carlyle has a pile of tech investments that it brags about on its website.\", \"This perfect impression of Sheryl Sandberg by the \\u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers\\u201d writer Dina Gusovsky. You will not get this until you watch, but as a mother of a daughter, who is a sister of brothers who have a mother, who is me, a woman, I found it priceless.\"]","href_hash":"575186583dc011ecb40c000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"575186583dc011ecb40c000017025a03"}},
