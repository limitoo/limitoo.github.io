People were panicking,\\u201d he said. \\u201cEverything was flying off the shelves.\\u201d\", \"Despite the swirling tension and fear around him, Mr. Manning said, he took the situation in stride and remained focused on his own goals, confident in pursuing the passion he\\u2019d found.\", \"In his early life, Mr. Manning had interests in art and music, and he was inspired to be the first person in his family to go to college. He saw education as a way to take his life into his own hands.\", \"\\u201cI always told myself as a younger child that one day I\\u2019d live a great and amazing life,\\u201d he said.\", \"Figuring out how to make that happen took some time. Mr. Manning, 29, was first connected with Children\\u2019s Aid, a beneficiary agency of The New York Times\\u2019s Neediest Cases Fund, when he entered its foster care program in 2004. After graduating high school, he attended a free vocational program at the School of Cooperative Technical Education.\", \"He also became involved with the Next Generation Center, a Children\\u2019s Aid program focused on young people, including those moving out of foster care. When the center opened a music studio in 2010, Mr. Manning had an opportunity to explore music and sound production, recording and how to D.J.\", \"\\u201cI found my niche,\\u201d Mr. Manning said.\", \"Six years after finishing the vocational program, he began the associate degree he\\u2019d been aiming for, channeling his musical interest at Hostos Community College. Last year, he received his associate degree in digital music, and after encouragement from a teacher, he decided to continue his education.\", \"But when Mr. Manning was accepted at the City College of New York to pursue a bachelor\\u2019s degree, his finances were too tight. He continued to work at the grocery store and could not afford the tuition. He turned to Children\\u2019s Aid for help. Using money from The Neediest Cases Fund this summer, Children\\u2019s Aid provided $1,949 for two courses.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m very happy and blessed that even past aging out many moons ago, Children\\u2019s Aid is still supporting me in pursuing this childhood dream,\\u201d Mr. Manning said.\", \"Support to achieve a degree came to Gilbert Perez through Brooklyn Community Services, another beneficiary of The Neediest Cases Fund. Mr. Perez, 18, also wants to be the first in his family to attend college, a goal that his mother had for herself but has not been able to begin.\", \"\\u201cI want to finish what she couldn\\u2019t start,\\u201d Mr. Perez said.\", \"Early this year, as Mr. Perez considered his June graduation from high school, he was searching for programs that would prepare him for the future. He found an internship program organized by Brooklyn Community Services. The 14-week program trains high-schoolers on how to apply for college and for financial aid, while also providing them with paid internships.\", \"Mr. Perez began in March. He became close with a case manager, Zolanlly Brunson, who learned that Mr. Perez had had multiple reconstructive surgeries over the previous nine years after a motorcycle accident that had shattered his leg. The one-bedroom apartment that he shared with his mother and sister, she also learned, did not have office furniture to accommodate Mr. Perez\\u2019s disability.\", \"So when Mr. Perez, whom Ms. Brunson described as having \\u201cperseverance and patience,\\u201d was accepted into the civil engineering program at the City College of New York, Brooklyn Community Services used $1,612 from The Neediest Cases Fund to buy an adjustable desk and chair, along with a computer, so that Mr. Perez could learn comfortably.\", \"\\u201cEveryone deserves an opportunity,\\u201d said Ms. Brunson, now the program director of Covid outreach. \\u201cI\\u2019m proud of being able to work with him and see how much he wants this.\\u201d\", \"Another New Yorker striving to achieve a degree is Adalyss Ruiz, 22. After graduating high school in 2017, she hoped to pursue a bachelor\\u2019s in business.\", \"\\u201cI was just so fixated on going to college,\\u201d she said.\", \"The complexities of applying for financial aid were overwhelming, though, and instead, Ms. Ruiz briefly spent time volunteering in Florida with her cousin who is a pastor. She returned to New York in 2018, but her goal to attend Berkeley College in Manhattan took a back seat again when she became pregnant. After her daughter, Evangeline, was born, she took on the role of stay-at-home mother.\", \"Early in 2020, Ms. Ruiz and Evangeline\\u2019s father split up, and Ms. Ruiz scrambled to find a job and to care for her daughter. Ms. Ruiz\\u2019s aunt connected her with the Grace Institute, which offers job-training programs for low-income women in New York. But the pandemic temporarily shut the program down before she could begin.\", \"\\u201cI was very depressed,\\u201d Ms. Ruiz said. \\u201cThe pandemic stopped all the jobs and I was like, \\u2018What the heck am I supposed to do now?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Ms. Ruiz was still job hunting when the Grace Institute reopened virtually, and she was able to attend from September to November 2020. Through the institute, Ms. Ruiz was connected with Community Service Society, another beneficiary of The Neediest Cases Fund.\", \"Ms. Ruiz, who was receiving cash public assistance and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits, got help from Community Service Society, which used $385 from The Fund to help Ms. Ruiz stay afloat with Instacart groceries, personal hygiene items and baby products on two occasions, along with a MetroCard so she could travel to interviews.\", \"\\u201cIt impacted me so much,\\u201d Ms. Ruiz said.\", \"She later found summer work at a Harlem community organization, assisting with a jobs program. Though the position ended, it helped financially and gave Ms. Ruiz a newfound sense of purpose.\", \"Four years after graduating high school, Ms. Ruiz reapplied to Berkeley and was accepted. She will begin classes in January and still plans to study business.\", \"She hopes to use her degree to create a nonprofit organization focused on affordable housing.\", \"\\u201cI know what it\\u2019s like to struggle and I love helping people,\\u201d Ms. Ruiz said. \\u201cI love to see people come out the other side better.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9123ca3b485811ec885e27dac71e361a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9123ca3b485811ec885e27dac71e361a"}},
