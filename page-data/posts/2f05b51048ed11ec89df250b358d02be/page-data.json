Most had strategies for accessing support from other rural officers nearby, or from within the community when necessary,\\\" the report found.\", \"\\\"Safety concerns are exacerbated by the presence of black spots, which prevent officers from contacting their Communications Centre in the event of an emergency and exposes them to undue risk.\\\"\", \"It also highlighted the issue of police officers having a conflict of interest, particularly when members of a community believe their officer favours some people more than others.\", \"\\\"Officers in small communities are less able to avoid such perceived conflicts, because often there is no one else to hand the matter over to.\\\"\", \"Some officers which took part in the review were concerned about workload and burnout, especially the lack of adequate support in one-person stations.\", \"IPCA chair Judge Colin Doherty said policing of small communities could be difficult and challenging.\", \"\\\"We met outstanding officers in the course of our review and were impressed at the service they provided, however, we concluded that police as an organisation lack an adequate national strategy for the allocation of resources and delivery of services to small and remote communities.\", \"\\\"The role of officers is not always clearly defined, and they do not always receive sufficient induction, supervision, training and support.
