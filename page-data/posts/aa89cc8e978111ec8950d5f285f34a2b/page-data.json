In his remarks at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Orlando, the former commander-in-chief predicted \\\"a major war in Europe\\\" would erupt.\", \"Trump, who has already endorsed over 120 local and federal Republican candidates in the 2022 midterm elections, also made a strong suggestion that he is going to run for president in 2024.\", \"\\\"[Democrats] are going to find out the hard way starting on November 8, and then again even more so on November 2024. They will find out like never before. We did it twice. We will do it again.

You can't defend western civilization if you would not be able to defend your own civilization.\\\"\", \"He noted other instances of Russian aggression under prior presidents, and again leaned into his baseless claim of the 2020 election being stolen, saying the conflict would not have happened if he was president.\\u00a0\", \"Trump, along with many other speakers throughout the weekend, drew comparisons between the Biden administration's reaction to Russia's invasion with the withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021.\\u00a0\", \"Trump also praised controversial GOP Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who was criticized for attending a white nationalist event on Friday.\", \"\\\"A person who is very shy does not like speaking her mind.
