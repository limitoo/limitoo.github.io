But more does not necessarily mean worse: Mutations sometimes work together to make a virus more fearsome, but they may also cancel one another out.\", \"\\u201cIn principle, mutations can also work against each other,\\u201d said Jesse Bloom, an evolutionary biologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. \\u201cHowever, in this case evolutionary selection is more likely to lead to the spread of a new variant with favorable than unfavorable combinations of mutations.\\u201d\", \"Still, this phenomenon, called epistasis, is why scientists are reluctant to speculate on Omicron\\u2019s attributes, even though individual mutations in the variant are associated with greater transmissibility or with an ability to dodge the body\\u2019s immune defenses.\", \"\\u201cIt is important to get a sense of the full virus,\\u201d said Penny Moore, a virologist at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases in South Africa.\", \"Dr. Moore\\u2019s team is among dozens worldwide trying to understand whether current vaccines will work against Omicron. The researchers are creating artificial versions of the virus that contain all of Omicron\\u2019s mutations, rather than making judgments based on a subset of mutations.\", \"It\\u2019s a lesson researchers learned last year, when the Beta variant emerged in South Africa. They estimated that variant\\u2019s ability to evade immunity based on one particular mutation, E484K. But Beta also had two other mutations that turned out to affect sensitivity to vaccines.\", \"\\u201cThe combination of those three mutations was more resistance than a virus that contained only E484K,\\u201d Dr. Moore said. Studying the single mutation \\u201cturned out to be misleading.\\u201d\", \"Omicron carries a mutation called N501Y, which is thought to allow the virus to bind to human cells more tightly. This mutation was also present in the Alpha variant and was linked to its contagiousness.\", \"\\u201cNonetheless, it ended up being Delta, which doesn\\u2019t have that particular mutation, that was more even more transmissible than Alpha,\\u201d Dr. Bloom said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s because Delta had other mutations that enhance transmissibility.\\u201d\", \"A variant\\u2019s contagiousness depends on how well the virus binds to receptors on human cells, but also on the stability of the virus, where in the airways it replicates and how much of it is exhaled.\", \"Omicron has a cluster of mutations that are all linked to tighter binding to human cells. \\u201cBut acting together, they might have a somewhat different effect,\\u201d Dr. Bloom said. For that reason, he added, he cannot predict how the variant will act in the body.\", \"That will require laboratory studies, which are underway across the globe.\"]","href_hash":"3b60d114516711ecadedfdb587fce7bb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3b60d114516711ecadedfdb587fce7bb"}},
