But her mother, a consistent voter even in special elections, was worried, wondering \\\"where are the Democrats?\\\"\", \"Republican Glenn Youngkin's campaign had knocked on her door but McAuliffe's campaign had not.\", \"Even before the dust settled on Youngkin's victory over McAuliffe Tuesday by a 50.7% to 48.6% margin, fingers were already being pointed at a campaign that is said to have neglected Black and Latino voters in favor of chasing white suburban women who abandoned Democrats in the end anyway.\", \"In the 2020 presidential election in Virginia, for example, Joe Biden edged Donald Trump among white women 50% to 49%, but Youngkin turned the tables on McAuliffe, beating him badly with the group 57% to 43%.\", \"\\\"Stop expecting white women voters especially in the suburbs to save the Democratic agenda,\\\" Omara wrote in a Twitter thread on Wednesday. \\\"They aren't loyal. Dance with the people who bring you to the dance.\\\"\", \"There is a belief, she argued, that things like Donald Trump's comments about women or the Texas abortion ban will drive suburban women to vote blue but \\\"more often than not they look at their options and still choose to vote for the Republican party.\\\"\", \"While Black voters gave McAuliffe 86% support, according to exit polls, there is widespread belief that votes were left on the table with a razor thin 2% margin of victory. But when it comes to Latino voters, there is confusion that only precinct vote totals will alleviate. The same exit polls used by most news organizations showed McAuliffe with a conventional 66% support among Latinos, but the AP VoteCast, a project of the Associated Press and Fox News, found Youngkin to have received 55% support from Hispanics.\", \"While the full data is not yet available on a group that comprised 5% of the electorate on Tuesday, Nate Cohn, a data journalist at the New York Times said that the four precincts where Latinos are a majority underperformed modeling for a tied election, perhaps suggesting \\\"continuing, disproportionate Democratic weakness with the group.\\\"\", \"It wouldn't be a surprise to Latino political strategists like Chuck Rocha, a former senior advisor to Bernie Sanders' 2020 presidential campaign, who did some work in Virginia on the governor's race, but said more needed to be done.\", \"A Democratic source who did private polling of voters in Virginia said they were focused on the economy and tired of the COVID-19 pandemic. But they chided the McAuliffe's campaign inattention to Black and Latino voters.\", \"\\\"Six months ago they didn't think they needed those voters because Terry was up by a lot but when they realized they did need those voters it was too late,\\\" the source said.\", \"Kristian Ramos, a Democratic political consultant and Latino vote expert, said Biden has created a strong economy, Virginia has a $2 billion budget surplus, and 70% of the country has been vaccinated, but Virginia's voters weren't told a positive story that resonated on those issues.\", \"One thing McAuliffe did actually say was considered a gaffe that hurt his campaign as the impacts to education from the pandemic rose to prominence.\", \"During a debate at the end of September Youngkin charged that McAuliffe believed \\\"school systems should tell children what to do. I believe parents should be in charge of their kids' education.\\\"\", \"McAuliffe said I'm \\\"not going to let parents come into schools and actually take books out and make their own decisions\\\" before adding \\\"I don't think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\\\"\", \"That comment appeared to hurt the Democratic candidate and former governor, especially as a debate has seeped into school districts over \\\"critical race theory\\\" and the concept that \\\"race is a social construct, and that racism is not merely the product of individual bias or prejudice, but also something embedded in legal systems and policies,\\\" according to a definition by Education Week.\", \"A longtime Latino Democrat who likes McAuliffe and briefly supported his presidential exploration ahead of 2020 said they received two calls from the campaign in October, but they were for money, not about help with strategy.\", \"The source said a lesson Republicans will take from Youngkin's win is the salience of critical race theory with voters in downballot races in 2022.\", \"\\\"It's already part of the playbook they're going to adopt in these House races because they figured out that Jim doesn't want little Jimmy to hear about how bad his grandfather was in the civil rights era,\\\" the source said.\", \"With respect to Black voters, there was a feeling Vice President Kamala Harris was misused or underutilized in Virginia, as well.\", \"A buzzy event featuring Harris and \\\"Drop It Like It's Hot\\\" superstar Pharrell Williams was sparsely attended and wasn't seen as particularly helpful when Pharrell told voters he wasn't there to tell them who to vote for but just to vote. The comment was seen as permission to vote for Youngkin, while Pharrell spoke in front of a \\\"Terry for Virginia\\\" banner.\", \"\\\"I can't speak to how [Harris] was underutilized but she didn't come through as much as you would expect,\\\" Omara said. \\\"The fact that in the last three weeks they called Stacey, Kamala, Obama, the president and the first lady tells you they realized \\\"Oh crap, we need to rouse the troops, and not just moderates, but the independents.\\\"\", \"But Bennett with the Fredericksburg Democrats said that while lack of engagement with groups like Latinos is a problem, voter engagement in general was a mess. \\\"This campaign was a head-scratcher from the beginning,\\\" she said. \\\"There was a lack of communication with the Democratic party of Virginia, a lack of communication with individual campaigns, and chairs seemed to be on a 'last to know' basis.\\\"\", \"McAuliffe's strategy of attempting to tie Youngkin to Trump was also panned, with Bennett calling it a \\\"major mistake.\\\"\", \"\\\"Democrats are tired of hearing about Trump,\\\" she argued. \\\"We've been fighting Trump for four years, it's emotionally exhausting and we want a vision of the future that's positive and exciting.\\\"\", \"Bennett's list of offenses by the campaign is long \\u2014 she says local Democrats needed resources like yard signs in September, not mid-October, to get buzz about the election going. But she said the number one resource in a campaign is the candidate themselves and in the case of McAuliffe, he wasn't holding enough rallies around the state.\", \"\\\"He wouldn't come,\\\" she said, noting that Democrats had to instead rely on other surrogates. \\\"Where was Terry?
