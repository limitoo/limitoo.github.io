In London, lawlessness continues apace, yet the great detective has given up the fight. Adrift in ennui, he no longer bothers to ensnare the city\\u2019s evildoers. His faithful Dr. Watson, eager to get the band back together, can\\u2019t even entice Holmes to come to his house for Christmas.\", \"\\u201cThere is no greater fool than one who shouts \\u2018Happy Christmas!\\u2019 in a city throughout which the foulest of mankind lurks \\u2019round every corner,\\u201d Holmes growls. \\u201cI\\u2019ll thank you to leave me alone, Watson.\\u201d\", \"Bit of a Grinch, isn\\u2019t he. Bit of a Scrooge, even. In \\u201cA Sherlock Carol,\\u201d Mark Shanahan\\u2019s arch charmer of a holiday mash-up, Holmes \\u2014 not Dickens\\u2019s Scrooge \\u2014 is the one who is \\u201csolitary as an oyster.\\u201d\", \"At New World Stages, Shanahan directs a cast of six, wonderfully led by the Broadway veterans Drew McVety as Holmes and Thom Sesma as Scrooge. Remixing Arthur Conan Doyle and Charles Dickens, this is a clever, crowd-pleasing holiday comedy that happens also to be a murder mystery.\", \"It isn\\u2019t aiming for sumptuous elegance, like Matthew Warchus\\u2019s large-cast, high-design production of Jack Thorne\\u2019s \\u201cA Christmas Carol,\\u201d seen two seasons ago on Broadway. This is a simpler, streamlined affair looking for \\u2014 and, crucially, finding \\u2014 silly, festive fun.\", \"On Christmas Eve 1894, the grumpish Holmes is haunted by a spirit: Moriarty, whose presence he feels stalking him everywhere.\", \"And the beatific, reformed Scrooge? Found dead that very day by a doctor who believes there was foul play. A fan of Watson\\u2019s stories, the doctor entreats Holmes to investigate \\u2014 and is thrilled when the uncannily observant detective, while refusing his appeal, says he\\u2019s known everything about him since the moment he walked in.\", \"Partisans of \\u201cA Christmas Carol\\u201d get a sweet thrill as well when Holmes, too arrogant to resist, gives a quick rundown of his intel on this stranger: He was poor in early childhood, illness shadowed his first years of life, the dead man was his benefactor. In an instant, we recognize the doctor \\u2014 Tiny Tim, all grown up and doing well.\", \"After he tells Holmes that a famous diamond had been on its way to Scrooge, who recently received a death threat, the detective relents and takes the case.\", \"\\u201cThe game is afoot,\\u201d he says, suddenly saucy, tossing one end of his scarf around a shoulder.\", \"And off we go into a sprightly escape of a play with a fine, much-doubling ensemble and a design team trailing reams of Broadway credits: Anna Louizos, set; Linda Cho, costumes; Rui Rita, lighting; John Gromada, music and sound; Charles G. LaPointe, hair and wigs. This production is in very good hands, and so are we.\", \"There is a curious shortage lately of plays to make us laugh, let alone to tickle both children and adults. For admirers of Doyle and Dickens, here\\u2019s one.\"]","href_hash":"caa9828052fc11ecb6b4e9b7af2bac97"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"caa9828052fc11ecb6b4e9b7af2bac97"}},
