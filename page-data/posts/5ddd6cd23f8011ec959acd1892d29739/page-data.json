The race begins in Staten Island and loops through Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx before ending in Manhattan\\u2019s Central Park.\", \"Runners have been waiting for Sunday\\u2019s race for two years, since 2019, as last year\\u2019s race was canceled because of the coronavirus pandemic. The last time a New York marathon was canceled before that was in 2012 after Hurricane Sandy.\", \"Conditions for Sunday look like perfect running weather, with a forecast for partly cloudy skies and temperatures in the high 40s in the morning.\", \"The marathon is broadcast live on ESPN2 nationally (8:30-11:30 a.m. Eastern time) and WABC-TV, Channel 7 locally (8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Eastern).\", \"The race is also broadcast on a variety of global networks, listed here.\", \"The 26.2-mile race begins in Staten Island and turns north through Brooklyn and Queens.

The race\\u2019s 20-mile mark, around 135th Street and Alexander Avenue, is a notoriously challenging part of the race where runners may hit the proverbial \\u201cwall.\\u201d\", \"If you\\u2019re the kind of person who likes a crowd to cheer with, First Avenue from 59th Street to 96th Street in Manhattan is always lined with spectators, especially with all the bars and restaurants on this part of the course.\", \"The field of 30,000 participants is about 40 percent smaller than the 2019 event, which saw a little more than 53,000 runners.\", \"Runners must provide proof of at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, or a negative coronavirus test taken within 48 hours of the race. \", \"Race organizers have also taken several steps to reduce crowd sizes in certain areas, and are requiring masks in the start and the post-finish areas.
