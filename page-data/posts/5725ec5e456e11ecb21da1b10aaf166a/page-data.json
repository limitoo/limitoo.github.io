The Times is using only their first names and is not showing their faces in photographs to protect their families still in Afghanistan.\", \"As the Taliban neared Kabul in August, Neda, a business student who worked part-time at the university, frantically fed student documents into a fire on the nearly empty campus. \\u201cWe tried to burn all the contracts or documents so they couldn\\u2019t find the students\\u2019 names and addresses,\\u201d she said.\", \"The students and staff feared the Taliban would hunt them down along with their families and kill them.\", \"\\u201cThe Taliban came to an office I was working at,\\u201d recalled Murtaza, a law student who was later evacuated. \\u201cThey wanted to beat us. They called us infidels and American spies.\", \"That night in August, as Neda burned papers, the foreign staff at the university had already been evacuated to a British-run security compound near the airport. For almost four hours Neda and a handful of other Afghans threw student records into the fire.\", \"And then it was time to leave for the British compound, in what would become a harrowing journey ending in what many of the students initially considered to be the dangerous destination of Iraq. \", \"But the Afghan university\\u2019s academic administrator knew better.\", \"Vice President Victoria Fontan had worked in Iraq and during the pandemic had collaborated with her counterpart in Sulaimaniya on an online curriculum. When the Kabul university started searching for a place to relocate students, she thought of Iraq and a network of powerful friends kicked into action.\", \"Iraqi President Barham Salih, the founder of the university in Sulaimaniya and himself a former refugee, pledged to take in up to 300 students and arranged for them to enter without visas or in some cases even passports.\", \"\\u201cThe Iraqis really took an enormous leap of faith in this,\\u201d said Jared Cohen, the chief executive of Jigsaw, a technology incubator formerly known as Google Ideas. He became involved in a personal capacity after being asked by a friend, an Afghan-born BBC journalist, to help evacuate students.\", \"Mr. Cohen said he obtained in a single afternoon from American philanthropists pledges of $3 million to evacuate and fund the studies of the 109 Afghan students in Sulaimaniya and relocate another group of civil society professionals and journalists to another country. The Qatari government provided planes to evacuate the students.\", \"The president of the Afghan university, Ian Bickford, said another 106 students had been sent to the American University of Central Asia in Kyrgyzstan, and about 200 to other countries, including Pakistan and the United States.\", \"Another 375 American University students are still in Afghanistan along with many more staff and hundreds of alumni, Mr. Bickford said. Many are in hiding.\", \"Students in Afghanistan still have access to online courses led by teachers now living outside the country. But many of those students no longer have reliable access to the internet or feel safe to connect, their former classmates said.\", \"Some students, like Neda, are still traumatized by their escape. The British security compound where she was sheltering with the university\\u2019s foreign staff was taken over by the Taliban, who demanded money and vehicles before they let the occupants leave. Neda was terrified that the Taliban, who later took photos and videos of everyone on the buses to the airport, would recognize they were not foreigners but Afghans.\", \"When they finally arrived at the Kabul airport gate with the foreign staff, she said, British soldiers barred them from entering.\", \"\\u201cThey said, \\u2018No, you guys are Afghans, you cannot go,\\u2019\\u201d Neda said. She said they were kicked out of the airport and into an area controlled by the Taliban. \\u201cI was in a very bad situation because I had never seen the Taliban face to face.\\u201d\", \"Eventually, she made it onto a Qatari evacuation flight on Aug. 21, leaving in a sandstorm amid the chaos of foreign soldiers including Turks trying to control an airport overrun with people desperate to escape.\", \"\\u201cThe Turkish army and American army treated us in a very bad way,\\u201d she said, wiping away tears. \\u201cI mean, it was my own country, it was my own land. But still they shouted at us.\\u201d\", \"Neda did not tell her family she was going to Iraq because she knew they would worry. \\u201cAll you hear about Iraq is the Islamic State and explosions,\\u201d she said.\", \" \", \"Murtza, 22, a law student who was among those relocated, said he missed Kabul, even with its frequent electricity cuts. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t feel safe around Kabul,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut it was my hometown. It was my country. It was my soul and it was my heart.\\u201d\", \"Mujtaba, a law student, was among a group of students who relocated to Sulaimaniya in October. Before he left, he would lie awake at night, listening to the constant roar of planes leaving Kabul.\", \"\\u201cWe couldn\\u2019t sleep because of the sound. And not just the sound, the thought that so many great people are just leaving the country. It was just devastating,\\u201d he said. Now he has become one of them. But he says he is determined to return to Afghanistan when he can to help rebuild it.\", \"Mujtaba taught English and ran a book club in Kabul, while also teaching his mother to read.\", \"He showed videos of his brother and sister reading by flashlight during a power cut in Kabul. While his brother still goes to school, Mujtaba said, his sister, a ninth-grader, was forced to stop after the Taliban shut down high schools for girls.\", \"In the small room he shares with another Afghan student in Sulaimaniya, Mujtaba writes inspirational notes to himself on sticky notes placed above his desk.\", \"\\u201cBe strong,\\u201d said that day\\u2019s note, with a smiley face drawn underneath.\"]","href_hash":"5725ec5e456e11ecb21da1b10aaf166a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5725ec5e456e11ecb21da1b10aaf166a"}},
