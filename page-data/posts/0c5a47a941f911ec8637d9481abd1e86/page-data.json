The Government has said the city will begin on the 'red' level of the system, meaning everything can reopen with limits of 100 people if vaccine certificates are used.\", \"If vaccine certificates aren't used at venues, restrictions will apply. For example, hospitality businesses will still only be able to open for takeaways.\", \"\\\"At red, action will need to be taken to protect both at-risk people and protect our health system from an unsustainable number of hospitalisations,\\\" the Government says in its COVID-19 protection framework criteria.\", \"Little, the Health Minister, was asked on Tuesday what that \\\"unsustainable\\\" number of hospitalisations would be.\", \"\\\"Look, I can't give you a precise number,\\\" he told The AM Show. \\\"We're at sort of, roughly kind of, the late 70s, 80, 81 yesterday in hospital but you've got three big hospitals in Auckland who can accommodate 4000 patients between them, but of course they're not 4000 beds just for COVID patients.\\\"\", \"Little was also asked how many hospital beds would be available for COVID-19 patients in Auckland.\", \"\\\"There'll be as many as we need to manage the problem but the more pressure that goes on the system, then the more you have to put restrictions on everything else,\\\" he told host Ryan Bridge. \\\"I can't give you precise numbers.
