The videos submitted to police by the homeowner show Arbery at the site between Oct. 25, 2019, and Feb. 23, 2020 - the day Arbery died.\", \"Rash testified he had been looking for Arbery, whose identity was unknown at the time, to tell him to stay away from the unfinished home. The police have a standard protocol for people caught trespassing.\", \"\\\"Once we make contact with the person on the property, we explain to them the homeowner does not want them there, they have no legal reason to be there,\\\" Rash said. \\\"I explain to that person, if you ever come back onto this property for any reason, you will be arrested.\\\"\", \"Larry English, the property owner, has said he was concerned that the same person kept coming into the house after dark but there was no evidence that person stole anything.\", \"On Feb. 23, 2020, father and son Greg and Travis McMichael, in a pickup truck, chased Arbery after he ran past their home, which was near the unfinished house Arbery was seen at. He was shot three times with a shotgun and died in the street.
