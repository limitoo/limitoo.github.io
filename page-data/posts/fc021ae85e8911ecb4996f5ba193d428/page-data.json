The Music Advancement Program\\u2019s \\u201ccommitment to recruiting underrepresented minorities will help bring new spirit, as well as superb young musicians, to orchestras, concert halls and theaters everywhere,\\u201d Heyman said in a statement.\", \"Juilliard aims to expand enrollment to 100 students, up from 70. The initiative will also broaden its reach to include younger students. (It currently serves children ages 8 through 18.) And in addition to full scholarships for all students, the gift will be used to create a fund to help them buy instruments.\", \"The program includes ear training, instrument lessons and theory classes for its students, who largely come from New York City public schools. Students can enroll for four years. The program costs $3,400 per year, though many students receive full or partial scholarships, currently funded from a variety of sources.\", \"While just seven Music Advancement Program students since 2010 have ended up in Juilliard\\u2019s undergraduate program, more have entered other prestigious institutions, including the Manhattan School of Music, Berklee College of Music and New England Conservatory. And 61 of the students have gained admission to Juilliard\\u2019s prestigious pre-college division.\", \"Anthony McGill, the New York Philharmonic\\u2019s principal clarinet and the artistic director of the program, said the gift would allow Juilliard to reach students who might have been reluctant to apply because of financial considerations.\", \"\\u201cWe needed to make sure there were no barriers to getting more of the students we want into our program,\\u201d McGill said in an interview. \\u201cWe wanted to open the doors, the pathways, to their success.\\u201d\", \"The program was founded in 1991 as a way of providing rigorous training for promising young musicians at a time when many New York schools were cutting music education classes. The initiative has at times faced financial difficulties. Juilliard almost suspended it in 2009, citing budget cuts and problems raising money. A group of donors, including Moritz and Heyman, eventually came to the rescue. In 2013, the couple stepped up again, giving $5 million.\", \"The program\\u2019s expansion comes amid a broader push by artists and cultural institutions to address longstanding inequities in classical music. Weston Sprott, who helps oversee the program as dean of Juilliard\\u2019s preparatory division, said being a musician of color was too often a lonely experience, and that ensembles should better reflect the diversity of their communities.\", \"\\u201cOftentimes, as musicians of color, the reward that we get for our success is isolation,\\u201d Sprott, who is Black, said in an interview. \\u201cClassical music can\\u2019t be the best it can be without these young people that we\\u2019re bringing into our programs.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"fc021ae85e8911ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fc021ae85e8911ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
