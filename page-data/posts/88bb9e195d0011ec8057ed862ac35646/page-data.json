Every meal? I love you, Nora, but I\\u2019ve got school lunches to make in the morning.\", \"Or I did, until school shut down. Once the city was in the grips of Covid, I had plenty of opportunities to sleep late. What I didn\\u2019t have was a place outside my own apartment to eat and drink and carry on. And look, I know many people had it worse than I did, but going out is my job. At some point last winter, when I was writing about the risks of indoor dining, I started to wonder when my editors were going to ask whether they really needed a restaurant critic who seemed to spend most of his time telling people not to eat in restaurants.\", \"Spoiler alert: I\\u2019m still here. But over the past two years, during which my mother and many of my idols died, I\\u2019ve come closer to seeing things Nora\\u2019s way. I believe now that she wasn\\u2019t advising gluttony and hangovers, necessarily. To eat every meal as if it\\u2019s your last could just as easily mean choosing food and drink and company that make you feel alive.\", \"That, at least, was my guiding thought as I ranked my 10 favorite new restaurants of all those I reviewed this year. Last December, when the time came for this annual ritual, I couldn\\u2019t do it. I hadn\\u2019t been able to write more than a handful of reviews in 2020. But I\\u2019ve been filing reviews more or less weekly since February. I was grateful to be back on the job then, and I\\u2019m still not taking it or anything else for granted. If the pandemic wasn\\u2019t quite a near-death experience for restaurant critics, it was closer than I expected to come.\", \"And it left me with a sharper sense of the meals I want more of. I think I\\u2019m less patient now, less interested than ever in sitting for hours waiting for some exquisitely arranged dollhouse plate that is gone in less time than it takes to snap a picture of it. I want less ritual, more reward. I want food that I can share with the other people at the table \\u2014 food that makes me say, \\u201cYou have to try this.\\u201d I want food that makes me glad we\\u2019re alive.\", \"Half of Dhamaka\\u2019s success must have been its timing. New York was still coming out of a pandemic-shutdown fog when it opened in February, a period of glitchy video calls, undefined working hours, creeping anxiety, reheated leftovers and repressed pleasures. Life had gone prematurely gray. There\\u2019s nothing gray about the food at Dhamaka, though. Every dish comes at you as if it wants to either marry you or kill you. The chef, Chintan Pandya, had started moving away from polite urban sophistication at Adda Indian Cuisine, in Long Island City; with Dhamaka he left the big cities of India behind, traveling to small villages and home cooks for inspiration. The food is relentlessly unfussy. Goat for the biryani is left on the bone \\u2014 the neck bone, to be precise. Chicken pulao is served in the pressure cooker in which it steamed, along with its bed of basmati rice \\u2014 so you can scrape up the golden crust at the bottom of the pot. Mr. Pandya doesn\\u2019t strafe every single dish with chiles, but he doesn\\u2019t hold back, either. For all the heat and spice in his cooking, though, there\\u2019s a lot of nuance to be appreciated once your heart has stopped racing.\", \"Other Chinese restaurants have arrived in New York to greater fanfare than CheLi, which slipped into St. Marks Place and then, once it had practiced its moves for a few months, sent its chefs (Wang Lin Qun and his wife, Fang Fang) to Flushing to open a Queens location. But don\\u2019t be fooled by its modesty: CheLi\\u2019s debut was a major event. The focus is the cuisine of Shanghai. This means more than just xiao long bao, although CheLi makes them very well, as it does other little buns and dim sum treats. The heart of the menu is seafood, prepared with Shaoxing wine and other subtle, aromatic seasonings that support the main ingredients rather than muffling them. Sweet small shrimp, which turn up in a swirl of dry-ice fog, are quietly accentuated by Dragon Well tea; dried peach sap thickens and flavors a crab meat stew; green and red chiles don\\u2019t overwhelm the broth in which Qianlong\\u2019s Favorite Fish Head is braised. All this is served in a room built to look like the kind of traditional village that China has almost completely erased from its landscape; now that the country has been so thoroughly modernized, rusticated nostalgia signifies sophistication.\", \"A tribute to the Basque cooking of San Sebasti\\u00e1n, Ernesto\\u2019s might be New York\\u2019s most unfiltered representation of the food people actually eat in Spain. Ryan Bartlow keeps the brusque, blunt qualities that another local chef might try to edit out or at least rein in: the heads of garlic, the crates of onions, the showers of olive oil, the parade of organ meats. Sometimes they all meet on one plate, as they do in the Madrid-style tripe or the bar sandwich of head cheese in a glistening brick of aspic, served on a bun with raw onions. The less confrontational dishes, like salt-cod fish sticks draped with fried green peppers, or grilled pork collar facing a crowd of minted peas, aren\\u2019t pussyfooting around, either.\", \"The owners of Contento started with the idea that people with disabilities should be able to go anywhere in the dining room with almost no fuss. They ended up doing more than removing barriers; they came up with a thoroughly new idea of hospitality. Yes, on any given night there may be guide dogs by the tables, wheelchairs at the bar, and knives and forks designed to be held by people with hand tremors. But there\\u2019s more going on: Everybody in the room seems to feel as if they belonged there. Of course, it helps that Contento has enough good things going on that you want to keep coming back until you belong, too. Oscar Lorenzzi, the chef, has a sophisticated sense of how bring French, Peruvian and other cuisines into the same conversation. Contento would be a destination solely on the strength of its wine list; it makes you want to ask questions, and then follow up on the answers by drinking something you\\u2019ve never heard of.\", \"The food is Middle Eastern, and the tone is exuberant. Ayesha J. Nurdjaja seems to throw everything she\\u2019s got into her menu at Shukette, which radiates a love of pickles, a passion for dips and charcoal-grilled skewers, a near-mania for breads hot from the oven. Fresh herbs are tossed without restraint over the hummus and salads and meats. They even make their way into the elaborately composed sodas called gazoz; a big hit in Tel Aviv, they look like floral arrangements suspended in seltzer. Needless to say, the energetic approach extends to the dining room. Plates rain down minutes after they\\u2019re ordered, even the best-mannered diners reach and grab and poke, and quiet is as scarce as an empty square foot of tabletop.\", \"First, let\\u2019s take a minute to be glad we\\u2019ve got Gage & Tollner to talk about. We almost lost it in 2004, when the gas chandeliers in the Victorian dining room in Downtown Brooklyn were snuffed out for the last time. If New York were Paris, Alain Ducasse, Jean-Fran\\u00e7ois Pi\\u00e8ge or another chef with a knack for scraping the rust from classic restaurants would have scooped up the space years ago. But in New York, property goes to the highest bidder, no matter how gruesome the outcome. It took almost two decades, give or take a pandemic, before Sohui Kim, Ben Schneider and St. John Frizell got their hands on the lease and brought Gage & Tollner back to life. The chandeliers are electric now, but the room has a soft, honeyed glow; the mood is life before Edison, to say nothing of life before Zuckerberg, and the menu offers a contemporary view of Gilded Age indulgence, starting with Parker House rolls, platters of oysters and bowls of Edna Lewis\\u2019s she-crab soup; building to steaks, chops and (Lewis\\u2019s hand again) fried chicken; and reaching a crescendo with a baked alaska the size of a woolly mammoth\\u2019s head. All this, plus a punctiliously made cocktail or two, may have you wondering whether there\\u2019s a cure for gout. But the space is unquestionably giving more to Brooklyn\\u2019s civic life now than it did as a store selling scrunchies and cellphone cases.\", \"John Fraser and Rob Lawson give us a fresh look at the Greek and Turkish cooking of the Aegean coast at Iris. Generally a rigorous simplicity reigns where Greek cuisine is concerned, but the two chefs manage to complicate the picture without confusing the matter. To a mashed eggplant salad, they add roasted peppers, toasted pine nuts, fresh herbs and more than a trickle of vinegar. Hummus is soured with both lemon juice and sumac, then finished with sesame seeds. A Turkish pide, a canoe-shaped feta pie, is seasoned with leeks, fresh dill and crunchy pink pickled onions. Amy Racine\\u2019s wine list goes off in original directions, too; I doubt any restaurant in the city sells as many bottles from Turkey, and the stylistic range goes from new school to ancient school.\", \"I\\u2019m tempted to say 2021 was the year of the plant-based restaurant, but I have a feeling that 2022 is going to be intensely plant-based, too. Out of the new crop, Cadence may have the most surprises up its sleeve. The chef, Shenarri Freeman, serves an exquisitely tender pancake with syrup, but the batter happens to contain both garlic and black-eyed peas, and the syrup is green with fresh sage. Lasagna with fake-meat Bolognese is rolled up, like manicotti, but also breaded and fried, like catfish. And I, for one, did not expect that when the platonic ideal of picnic potato salad finally came to New York, it would be served at a vegan tasting counter in the East Village.\", \"Pashtun-style patties of spiced beef, lamb or chickpeas, flattened by hand and fried in a cast-iron skillet, are the specialty of Chapli & Chips, a sidewalk cart on the eastern edge of Queens. While the patty is still sizzling from the oil, it is hacked into strips and either rolled up inside a flour tortilla meant for burritos or arranged over long grains of Pakistani sella rice, steamed with cloves and cinnamon. Both the sandwich and the platter are opportunities for deploying the many sauces cooked up by the cart\\u2019s proprietor, Karim Khan, particularly the smoky and gloweringly spicy hot sauce. All the details are carefully tended to, down to the French fries that are cut to order in a hand-operated press mounted on the side of the cart.\", \"Yoon Haeundae Galbi is a tribute to a decades-old restaurant in Busan, South Korea, that specializes in four items: grilled short rib, grilled marinated short rib, bulgogi and soybean stew. The meat is cooked on what looks like an ancient warrior\\u2019s helmet; all the fat and juices run down to a wide brim. Once the meat is finished, you can dip it in spicy sesame salt and roll it up in lettuce while the helmet\\u2019s brim is used to cook potato-starch noodles; they take on so much of the meat\\u2019s flavor that they almost qualify as a separate cut of beef.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
