The SEC also seeks to implement a \\\"cooling-off period\\\" of 120 days between the time an individual adopts a new plan and makes their first trade. For those trading in the stock of their own companies, this period would be 30 days.\", \"The new regulations would also prevent corporate insiders from having several overlapping plans which Reuters reported that SEC Chair Gary Gensler disapproves of because of the ability for insiders to \\\"cherry-pick favorable plans as they please.\\\"\", \"\\\"Over the past two decades, we've heard concerns about and seen gaps in Rule 10b5-1 \\u2014 gaps that today's proposals would help fill,\\\" Gensler said in a press statement issued Wednesday. \\\"These issues speak to the confidence that investors have in the markets. Anytime we can increase investor confidence in the markets, that's a good thing. It helps investors deciding where to put their money. It lowers the cost of capital for businesses seeking to raise capital, grow, and innovate, and thus facilitates capital formation. I'm pleased to support today's proposal and, subject to Commission approval, look forward to the public's feedback.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952667/cftc-sec-heads-testify-before-senate.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The SEC called for the tightening of a rule on Wednesday that allows corporate insiders to set predetermined plans to sell company stocks in accordance with insider trading rules.
