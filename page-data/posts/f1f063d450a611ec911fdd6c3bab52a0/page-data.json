The parity has decimated our record against the spread and has vaulted under-the-radar teams into the playoff conversation. The Indianapolis Colts, Philadelphia Eagles, San Francisco 49ers and Minnesota Vikings are on unlikely winning streaks, and each has a real chance at a wild-card spot pending the outcome of this weekend\\u2019s games.\", \"In the meantime, teams that sat atop their divisions mere weeks ago can no longer assume home-field advantages for the playoffs.\", \"The drama continues this week with a potential N.F.C. Championship preview between the Los Angeles Rams and Green Bay Packers, an important A.F.C. North game between the Cleveland Browns and Baltimore Ravens, and a matchup of two playoff dark horses, the Minnesota Vikings and San Francisco 49ers.\", \"Below is a look at N.F.L. Week 12, with all picks made against the spread.\", \"Last week\\u2019s record: 5-10\", \"All times are Eastern.\", \"Byes: Kansas City, Arizona\", \"Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Indianapolis Colts, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Buccaneers -2.5 | Total: 51.5\", \"This game should determine whether it\\u2019s time to add the Colts (6-5) into the hectic fray of A.F.C. challengers. They have won five of their last six games, and are currently on a three-game winning streak. Jonathan Taylor leads the league in rushing yards (1,222), and has entered the Most Valuable Player Award conversation. But Indianapolis\\u2019s postseason hopes hinge on getting a win: They have a 66 percent chance of making it if they win, and only a 45 percent shot if they lose.\", \"The Buccaneers (7-3), though, allow the fewest rushing yards per game (78.4), and could get a lift from the return of defensive tackle Vita Vea (knee), whose presence would be particularly helpful in clogging Taylor\\u2019s run lanes. If Tampa Bay\\u2019s defense neutralizes Taylor, it will turn into a shootout between Carson Wentz and Tom Brady. Who do you trust more in that scenario? Pick: Buccaneers -2.5\", \"Los Angeles Rams at Green Bay Packers, 4:25 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Packers -1 | Total: 47.5\", \"Last week\\u2019s bye was perfectly timed for the Rams (7-3) to gather their pride after two embarrassing losses, and to integrate receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and linebacker Von Miller \\u2014 acquired in the past month \\u2014 into their system. The showdown against the Packers (8-3) could be a preview of the N.F.C. Championship game.\", \"The Rams figure to be in a better position than in last season\\u2019s divisional round loss to the Packers, when Aaron Donald was compromised with a rib injury. He should feast with two of Green Bay\\u2019s starters from the offensive line out: Guard Elgton Jenkins was placed on injured reserve after tearing his anterior cruciate ligament last week, and tackle David Bakhtiari will miss time after having his knee scoped this week. Forecasts call for a kickoff temperature around 37 degrees, but that looks like the only advantage the Packers should have in this one. Pick: Rams +1\", \"Pittsburgh Steelers at Cincinnati Bengals, 1 p.m. CBS\", \"Line: Bengals -3.5 | Total: 45.5\", \"The Steelers (5-4-1) nearly beat the Chargers last week without some of their best players, which makes predicting their divisional matchup with the Bengals (6-4) tough. Cornerbaack Joe Haden (foot) was ruled out but T.J. Watt (hip and knee) and Minkah Fitzpatrick, who was on the Covid-19 list last week, are expected to play. They will certainly help, but the Steelers must also run the ball better \\u2014 they rushed for only 55 yards against Los Angeles, whose defense has been awful against the run.\", \"Cincinnati has allowed the fifth-fewest rushing yards per game (98) and could force Pittsburgh to again be one-dimensional. If the Bengals get out to a lead, they should be able to keep it. A Cincinnati win increases their postseason chances to 60 percent but a loss would drop them to 28 percent. Pick: Bengals -3.5\", \"Tennessee Titans at New England Patriots, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Patriots -5.5 | Total: 44.5\", \"Injuries are affecting the Titans (8-3) and their slipping grip atop the A.F.C. The team placed linebacker Bud Dupree (abdominal) and receiver A.J. Brown (chest) on injured reserve. Ryan Tannehill threw four interceptions against one of the worst teams in the league last week, not a good precursor to playing the Patriots (7-4).\", \"New England has allowed opponents an average of only 135 passing yards and 72.3 rushing yards over their last three games. Meanwhile, Mac Jones has completed over 80 percent of his passes in back-to-back weeks. The Patriots are the hotter team while Tennessee is banged up, making this an easy bet. Pick: Patriots -5.5\", \"Minnesota Vikings at San Francisco 49ers, 4:25 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: 49ers -3 | Total: 48\", \"Back-to-back wins for the Vikings (5-5) and the 49ers (5-5) have given both teams momentum for their playoff hopes. Minnesota\\u2019s Justin Jefferson has posted over 100 receiving yards in that stretch, and Kirk Cousins has not thrown an interception in the last five games. Defending Jefferson and receiver Adam Thielen will be a big barometer for San Francisco\\u2019s secondary, which has allowed the third-fewest passing yards per game (202.4). Cousins struggles under duress, and if the 49ers\\u2019 front seven can generate pressure, he could be liable for a turnover or two, allowing San Francisco\\u2019s methodical offensive approach to chew clock. Pick: 49ers -3\", \"Cleveland Browns at Baltimore Ravens, 8:20 p.m., NBC\", \"Line: Ravens -3.5 | Total: 46\", \"A narrow victory last week for the Browns (6-5) against the winless Lions felt like a loss as Baker Mayfield declined to talk to reporters afterward and then scolded fans who booed the team. The quarterback played through shoulder and knee injuries, ailments that are clearly affecting his performance, but Mayfield is available to play.\", \"Against the Ravens (7-3), running back Kareem Hunt is hopeful to play for the first time since he injured his calf in October. Baltimore has allowed the second-fewest rushing yards, though, and could contain even a backfield as dynamic as Hunt and Nick Chubb. Lamar Jackson practiced this week as he recovered from an illness that kept him out in Week 11. With the Browns faltering, Baltimore is the safer bet. Pick: Ravens -3.5\", \"Carolina Panthers at Miami Dolphins, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Panthers -1 | Total: 42.5\", \"Cam Newton\\u2019s return for the Panthers (5-6) doesn\\u2019t fix that the team has no consistent playmaker other than running back Christian McCaffrey, that the run defense is mediocre and that Carolina leads the league in penalties (81). The Dolphins (4-7) have won their last three games behind their defense, which has created seven turnovers in that stretch.\", \"But there\\u2019s still reason to think that the Panthers are the better team. Miami\\u2019s pass defense is still the worst in the league, and the team has rushed for 100 yards only three times. If Carolina takes care of the ball and handle Miami\\u2019s aggressive blitzes, the Panthers should win. Pick: Panthers -1\", \"Atlanta Falcons at Jacksonville Jaguars, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Falcons -1 | Total: 48.5\", \"Anything can happen when two of the worst teams in the league meet up. The Falcons (5-6), though, have played far worse than the Jaguars (2-8) recently and have been outscored, 68-3, in their last two games. Jacksonville, meanwhile, has played competitively against strong competition, allowing only 186.3 passing yards per game in their last three.\", \"Atlanta will still be without receiver Calvin Ridley (mental health) and do-it-all back Cordarrelle Patterson (ankle), making Matt Ryan\\u2019s one option finding tight end Kyle Pitts. The Jaguars know that and can cut it off. Pick: Jaguars +1\", \"Philadelphia Eagles at Giants, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Eagles -3.5 | Total: 46\", \"After leaning heavily on the pass earlier in the season, the Eagles (5-6) have become more balanced, rushing for over 200 yards in three of their last four games. That strategy should succeed against the Giants (3-7), who allow 119.7 rushing yards per game. The Giants offense scores a mere 18.9 points per game, a lack of production so dire it got offensive coordinator Jason Garrett fired Tuesday. These two teams are on opposite trajectories, and the spread could be a bit higher. Pick: Eagles -3.5\", \"Jets at Houston Texans, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Texans -2.5 | Total: 44.5\", \"Realistically, don\\u2019t bet on this game. If you do, take the Texans (2-8) based on momentum. Houston surprisingly beat the Titans last week thanks to a five-turnover performance by its defense. The unit could see similar results against the Jets (2-8), who will start the rookie quarterback Zach Wilson after he missed four games because of a knee injury.\", \"Wilson struggled with ball security and is tied for fourth in interceptions (9) even after sitting out a month. Other young skill players have blossomed in his absence, including receiver Elijah Moore and running back Michael Carter, though Carter will be out with an ankle injury. The Jets defense has underperformed, though, allowing 171.3 rushing yards per game over their last three. Wilson\\u2019s rust, Carter\\u2019s absence and the defense\\u2019s problems should allow Houston to cover. Pick: Texans -2.5\", \"Los Angeles Chargers at Denver Broncos, 4:05 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Chargers -2.5 | Total: 47.5\", \"This A.F.C. West matchup puts the Chargers\\u2019 (6-4) playoff standing on the line. With a win, Los Angeles is back in the fight for the division lead. A loss drops them back into wild card territory, where they\\u2019d have a 52 percent chance of making the postseason. The Chargers\\u2019 last four games have been decided by one score and even if they are a better team, the potential Covid-related absences of three defensive tackles, including Linval Joseph, who is on the Covid-19 list, could cause Los Angeles to struggle. \", \"Fresh off their bye, Denver designated linebacker Bradley Chubb to return from injured reserve, and his presence would help stop Chargers running back Austin Ekeler, who scored four touchdowns last week. Denver can win outright, or keep it within the spread. Pick: Broncos +2.5\", \"Seattle Seahawks at Washington Footballers, 8:15 p.m., ESPN\", \"Line: Washington -1 | Total: 46.5\", \"The Seahawks (3-7) have become irrelevant. The defense is still one of the worst in the league, allowing the third-most passing yards per game (279.6). The offense, even with Russell Wilson back from finger surgery, is inept, especially now that running back Chris Carson is officially out for the remainder of the year with a neck issue.\", \"Taylor Heinicke has played well recently, leading Washington (4-6) to two straight wins, and he has not thrown an interception in that time frame. Each week gives Wilson and his agent more material to request a trade this off-season. A loss to Washington in prime time could be a final straw. Pick: Washington -1\", \"Bears 16, Lions 14\", \"We picked the Bears to cover -3.5, figuring that this battle of two bad offenses would turn on Detroit running back D\\u2019Andre Swift having a third straight 100-yard rushing game.\", \"We picked wrong. Swift exited the game in the second quarter with a shoulder injury but the Lions (0-10-1) carried a lead late into the fourth before falling to the Bears (4-7), who connected on Cairo Santos\\u2019s 28-yard field goal attempt as time expired.\", \"Chicago\\u2019s Andy Dalton had 317 yards on 24 of 39 passing, with one touchdown, in place of Justin Fields, who injured his knee in Week 11.\", \"In Jared Goff\\u2019s return from an abdominal injury, the Lions managed to take a 14-13 lead in the third quarter on Goff\\u2019s 17-yard touchdown pass to T.J. Hockenson. Detroit could have extended its lead on a final fourth-quarter possession but was assessed penalties on three consecutive plays and had to punt. Dalton drove the Bears 41 yards before Santos\\u2019s field goal sailed through.\", \"Raiders 36, Cowboys 33 (overtime)\", \"We picked the Cowboys -7, playing at home against a Raiders defense that had looked shaky in recent performances.\", \"We picked wrong. The Raiders (6-5) defense again looked untrustworthy giving up 11 points on the Cowboys final two drives in regulation. Dak Prescott threw on all but one play of a 4-play, 69-yard touchdown drive and converted a 2-point attempt to Dalton Schultz to tie the game, 30-30, with over two minutes remaining.\", \"Dallas failed to score on the opening possession of overtime and looked as if it would stop Las Vegas\\u2019s drive. Facing third-and-18 from their own 43-yard line, Raiders quarterback Derek Carr targeted Zay Jones, who was interfered with by Cowboys cornerback Anthony Brown. The penalty gave the Raiders a new set of downs deep in Cowboys territory and Daniel Carlson ended the drive and the game with a 29-yard field goal.\", \"Bills 31, Saints 6\", \"We picked Buffalo -4, figuring that New Orleans short-handed offense would not be able to keep pace with a Bills team smarting from a Week 11 thumping.\", \"We picked correctly.\", \"Josh Allen and the Bills (7-4) offense dominated Thursday, outgaining the Saints by 171 yards. Allen threw for 260 yards and four touchdowns, including two to tight end Dawson Knox, in a game that was never close. The Saints (5-6) defense picked off Allen twice but could find no consistent offense with Alvin Kamara and other playmakers out.\", \"A quick primer for those who are not familiar with betting lines: Favorites are listed next to a negative number that represents how many points they must win by to cover the spread. Raiders -5.5, for example, means that Las Vegas must beat Chicago by at least 6 points for its backers to win their bet. Gamblers can also bet on the total score, or whether the teams\\u2019 combined score in the game is over or under a preselected number of points.\"]","href_hash":"f1f063d450a611ec911fdd6c3bab52a0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f1f063d450a611ec911fdd6c3bab52a0"}},
