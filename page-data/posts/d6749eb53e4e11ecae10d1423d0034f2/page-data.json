The investigation, known as Operation Varsity Blues, exposed a corrupt private college consultant, William Singer, working with coaches, test administrators and wealthy parents willing to pay thousands of dollars in bribes to get their children into some of the country\\u2019s top universities.\", \"Dr. Heinel received more than $1.3 million in bribes according to federal prosecutors.\", \"Her plea comes about a month after two of the parents, Gamal Abdelaziz, a former casino executive, and John Wilson, a private equity financier, were found guilty by a federal jury in Boston; they were the first people to stand trial in the case.\", \"Dr. Heinel was directly implicated in Mr. Abdelaziz\\u2019s case. Prosecutors said she helped Mr. Abdelaziz\\u2019s daughter get admitted to U.S.C. in 2018 as a basketball recruit, even though she had not made her high school varsity team. Prosecutors said Mr. Abdelaziz subsequently sent $300,000 to a foundation controlled by Mr. Singer. A few months later, court papers say, Mr. Singer began making payments of $20,000 a month to Dr. Heinel, in exchange for her assistance in easing the way for Mr. Abdelaziz\\u2019s daughter and the children of Mr. Singer\\u2019s other clients. Mr. Abdelaziz\\u2019s daughter never joined the U.S.C. basketball team.\", \"Jeffrey Cohen, a former federal prosecutor, said Friday that the conviction of Mr. Abdelaziz may have pushed Dr. Heinel to take the plea deal.\", \"\\u201cThose accused of being involved now recognize that the defenses made by Abdelaziz are not likely to persuade a jury, namely that this was part of the normal admissions process and nothing corrupt,\\u201d Mr. Cohen said. \\u201cFaced with that realization, the defense will be hard-pressed to formulate a defense, especially for the coaches who are part of the university and not outsiders to the process.\\u201d\", \"The investigation has snared more than 50 parents, coaches, exam administrators and others in an admissions scheme that implicated college athletic programs at the University of Southern California, Yale, Stanford, Wake Forest and Georgetown. Most have pleaded guilty rather than take their chances in court.\"]","href_hash":"d6749eb53e4e11ecae10d1423d0034f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d6749eb53e4e11ecae10d1423d0034f2"}},
