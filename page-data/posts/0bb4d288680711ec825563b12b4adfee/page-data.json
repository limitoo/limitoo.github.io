But that concern is running up against those who argue that it is time to accept that the virus is endemic, and that countries should move away from lockdowns and toward more relaxed rules, including shorter quarantines.\", \"John Bell, a professor of medicine at Oxford University and an adviser to the British government, said that Omicron was \\u201cnot the same disease we were seeing a year ago.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe horrific scenes that we saw a year ago of intensive care units being full, lots of people dying prematurely, that is now history, in my view, and I think we should be reassured that that\\u2019s likely to continue,\\u201d he told the BBC on Tuesday.\", \"Britain appears to be a few weeks ahead of most other nations in confronting the first wave of Omicron infection and, for the moment, has decided that the evidence does not warrant new restrictions.\", \"While the latest figures in Britain are incomplete because of the Christmas holiday, data published on Monday indicated that more than 300,000 new Covid cases had been recorded between Saturday and Monday.\", \"But Chris Hopson, the head of N.H.S. Providers, the membership organization for England\\u2019s health staff, said that while hospitalizations across Britain had risen, it was not a precipitous jump.\", \"\\u201cWhat\\u2019s very interesting is how many are talking about number of asymptomatic patients being admitted to hospital for other reasons and then testing positive for Covid,\\u201d he said of conversations with heads of hospitals, in a series of posts on Twitter.\", \"\\u201cSome are describing this as \\u2018incidental Covid.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Professor Paul Hunter, an infectious disease expert at the University of East Anglia, said the approach to the current rise is a complicated one.\", \"\\u201cIf health services are likely to come under such pressure that they could collapse then implementing control measures now would be the right thing to do,\\u201d he wrote in a post on Twitter. \\u201cBut tighter control measures carry a real risk, and not just to mental health, the economy, etc.\\u201d Forcing a change in behavior would not prevent infections, just delay them, he said. So further restrictions now would reduce the peak of a surge in cases and could ease short-term pressure on health services, but also extend the wave, he added.\", \"\\u201cSo is it better to reduce the peak now but with the risk that because of waning vaccine immunity overall more people may suffer severe disease in the long term?\\u201d he asked. \\u201cThat is what makes this decision so difficult.
