Because most of us do like the environment and there's been a lot of challenges to it, particularly through the dairy boom.\\\"\", \"In those years, entire wetlands and sphagnum moss swamps were wiped out - \\\"humped and hollowed\\\" to create pasture, and the government with its Landcorp farms was one of the worst offenders, Ken said.\", \"\\\"The Crown would be one of the biggest environmental vandals we've got, if you look at the blocks they developed, like Mawheraiti and Cape Foulwind, Weka, Nelson Creek ... if the government now wants these SNAs they should sell Landcorp and buy them, or do a land swap.\\\"\", \"In the 1990s, the Fergusons drew up a sustainable management plan for their forest and under that agreement can harvest up to 1000 tonnes of timber a year.\", \"\\\"The interesting thing about that is that the council at that time agreed we could lift timber out of our SNAs. The environmental plan was strong enough, robust enough, that it wouldn't change the biodiversity.\\\"\", \"These days the Fergusons take only windfall trees, but the old agreement still stands.\", \"\\\"When we put the plan through, we didn't have a strong cash flow and the plan cost something like $50,000 and that included the resource consents for roading, bridges, culverts, gravel pits - all the things we could think of that the farm might need in future.\\\"\", \"In contrast, the way the present government had gone about belatedly enforcing biodiversity policy was guaranteed not to win friends and influence people, Ken said.\", \"\\\"I think they should have put the carrot out there and said 'on your SNAs, you can get carbon credits'. Because pre-1990 forest doesn't get carbon credits yet we all know it's sequestering carbon.\\\"\", \"That would be a good start, he believed. That - and the offer of funds for fencing.\", \"\\\"Because native forests have a life span, and without regeneration, they will die unless they are fenced off and protected in a loving way. They'll fail because the stock will get in there and skin out the undergrowth and nothing regenerates.\", \"\\\"And the beauty of our forest is regeneration is just waiting there. There's some really good examples of that if you drive up the Mauria and look at the old earthquake slip.\", \"\\\"That was totally denuded down to rock and clay. And now most people wouldn't know it was there unless you pointed it out.\\\"\", \"West Coast councils and iwi are now pondering their next step on the vexed SNA issue, as they try to write biodiversity rules for the new combined district plan.\", \"Expert legal advice has been that they must identify and map them or risk burdening ratepayers with costly appeals against Te Tai o Poutini Plan in the Environment Court.\", \"To date the committee has resisted taking the final step - having the mapped areas verified as SNAs by an ecologist. But the Grey District Council has now broken ranks by reminding the group it has already done that job, and can take no further part in the resistance.\", \"\\\"We made agreements with our farmers in exchange for SNAs and we will be standing by them,\\\" councillor Anton Becker told the meeting.\", \"Whether environmental groups will be satisfied with the 72 SNAs listed in the Grey District Plan 15 years ago is uncertain - as is the Te Tai o Poutini Plan's way forward.\", \"But as the government had discovered, a collaborative rather than dictatorial approach might be the best bet when it came to the farming community, Ken said.\", \"\\\"Get around the table and discuss it - that would be my advice.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/211080/three_col_LDR-HORIZONTAL-FINAL-colour.jpg?1570666591\\\" alt=\\\"no metadata\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"Local Democracy Reporting is a public interest news service supported by RNZ, the News Publishers' Association and NZ On Air.\"]","href_hash":"84b855205d2011ec88b3c9f853897eb8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"84b855205d2011ec88b3c9f853897eb8"}},
