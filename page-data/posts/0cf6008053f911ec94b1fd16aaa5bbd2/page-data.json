In 2015, the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children created a digital rendering of what she would have looked like before her death, which included a tattoo of the letter S on her right arm and a birthmark on her back.\", \"In 2016, additional testing was done with DNA samples taken from her body and revealed a match to two of her sisters.
