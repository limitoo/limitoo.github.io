Parts of Europe are grappling with a wave of infections of the more familiar Delta variant.\", \"WHO emergencies director Mike Ryan said there was no evidence that existing vaccines needed to be modified to fight Omicron. He said officials should focus on getting more people inoculated with vaccines currently on the market.\", \"\\\"We need to focus on getting people most at risk vaccinated,\\\" Ryan said at a social media event.\", \"However, WHO spokesperson Christian Lindmeier told a United Nations briefing in Geneva that vaccine makers should prepare for the likelihood of adjusting their products.\", \"Ugur Sahin, the chief executive of BioNTech, which makes a Covid-19 vaccine with Pfizer, told Reuters the company should be able to adapt the shots relatively quickly.\", \"Sahin also said current vaccines should continue to provide protection against severe disease, despite mutations.\", \"\\\"I believe in principle at a certain timepoint we will need a new vaccine against this new variant.
