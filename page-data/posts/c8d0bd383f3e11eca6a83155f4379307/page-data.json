But it directed the Biden administration to respond by 5 p.m. Monday to the request for a permanent injunction from the groups opposed to the rule.\", \"Seema Nanda, the chief legal officer for the U.S. Department of Labor, said in a statement that the government was confident in its legal authority to issue the emergency temporary standard on vaccination and testing.\", \"\\u201cThe Occupational Safety and Health Act explicitly gives OSHA the authority to act quickly in an emergency where the agency finds that workers are subjected to a grave danger and a new standard is necessary to protect them,\\u201d Ms. Nanda said.\", \"\\u201cWe are fully prepared to defend this standard in court,\\u201d she added.\", \"The regulations are not slated to go into effect until Jan. 4. On Thursday, the Biden administration set that date as the deadline for large companies to mandate coronavirus vaccinations or start weekly testing of their workers. The move was the government\\u2019s biggest effort yet to enlist private businesses in combating the virus.\", \"The new rules were crafted by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and issued as an \\u201cemergency temporary standard,\\u201d invoking emergency powers concerning safety in the workplace. Applying to companies with 100 or more, the mandate is expected to cover 84 million workers, roughly 31 million of whom are unvaccinated.
