Whether you want to work off all those holiday cookies or stretch your way into a healthier year, a home gym can make that more convenient \\u2014 and safer, as the pandemic rages on.\", \"A dedicated home gym isn\\u2019t a necessity, of course, but if you\\u2019re fortunate enough to have the space, it can be a real luxury \\u2014 especially if it\\u2019s well designed. To make it a place where you\\u2019ll enjoy spending time, give it some thought and concentrate on the design, advised Sara Story, a New York-based interior designer and exercise enthusiast. \\u201cIt should have a good atmosphere and good lighting,\\u201d she said, much like any other room in your home.\", \"For tips on designing a hard-wearing gym that\\u2019s a joy to use, we asked designers how they approach workout spaces.\", \"Although it\\u2019s nice to have an expansive space for your gym, it doesn\\u2019t need to be a huge room. Nicole Hollis, an interior designer, turned a small, awkward room on the top floor of her San Francisco townhouse \\u2014 roughly the size of a walk-in closet \\u2014 into her home gym.\", \"\\u201cWe have this little room that\\u2019s too small to be a bedroom, so we set it up as our gym,\\u201d Ms. Hollis said. Rather than trying to de-emphasize the tight quarters, she played them up, painting the walls and floor in dark colors to create a sense of drama, a strategy that many designers use for powder rooms.\", \"Basements are a popular place for home gyms because they often have leftover space, but for the fitness-obsessed, it\\u2019s perfectly acceptable to put a gym in a more prominent spot \\u2014 like an unused guest room, or a home office.\", \"Olga Hanono, an interior designer, recently completed a four-story home in Mexico City with a gym on the top level, which has glass doors and views over neighboring rooftops. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not the deepest, most obscure corner of the home,\\u201d she said. \\u201cOn the contrary, it\\u2019s a space filled with natural light.\\u201d\", \"If possible, it\\u2019s best to put the gym near a bathroom, said Jimmy Crisp, the principal of Crisp Architects, in Millbrook, N.Y., because \\u201cchances are, you\\u2019re going to want to shower after you work out.\\u201d And if you\\u2019re going all out, consider installing spalike features like a steam shower or a sauna.\", \"There are many ways to work out, from free weights to elliptical machines, so knowing which equipment you\\u2019ll actually use is important. And if you want a gym that is as attractive as it is functional, you\\u2019re in luck: Finding good-looking equipment with a compact footprint is easier than it used to be.\", \"\\u201cNow there\\u2019s a blending of luxury and technology in the gym, and that\\u2019s the best thing that could happen to us,\\u201d Ms. Hanono said. \\u201cIt allows us to place not only useful, but also beautiful, objects in these places.\\u201d\", \"Interactive fitness systems like Mirror, Tonal and Forme are as unobtrusive as a wall-mounted mirror or picture frame. Peloton has streamlined stationary bikes and treadmills. Wahoo and Tacx make stationary smart trainers that allow carbon-fiber racing bicycles to be used indoors. Ergatta and WaterRower make rowing machines that look almost as handsome as finely crafted rowing shells. And companies like Bala and Kenko are rethinking what weights should look like.\", \"There\\u2019s more to designing a home gym than just piling equipment into an unused room \\u2014 it requires creating a layout with good spatial flow.\", \"\\u201cWe really like to consider the program and how the client will use the space, including what types of cardio equipment they\\u2019ll be using,\\u201d said Heather Hilliard, an interior designer in San Francisco. For instance, she said, \\u201cif there\\u2019s a treadmill, you have to have space behind it, in case someone falls off. And you need space for navigating between machines.\\u201d\", \"With electronic machines like treadmills and Peloton bikes, she added, it\\u2019s critical to have electrical outlets nearby, so you don\\u2019t have extension cords snaking across the room. When possible, Ms. Hilliard likes to add floor outlets directly below the machines.\", \"It\\u2019s also important to leave space for floor exercises, Ms. Story said. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want to go into a gym where it\\u2019s just all machines,\\u201d she said, because it could feel claustrophobic. Leaving open space at the center of the room will make your gym feel less cramped, while also providing room for yoga, stretching and calisthenics.\", \"The flooring and walls in a gym should be durable and easy to clean.\", \"\\u201cSome form of resilient floor is always a good idea,\\u201d Mr. Crisp said. That often means interlocking rubber-tile or vinyl flooring, similar to the kind commercial gyms use, installed wall-to-wall or as a large area mat on top of other flooring.\", \"Another option is to use cushioned mats that can be rolled out individually, in discrete workout zones, across a hard floor of wood, laminate or concrete, Ms. Hollis said. (Carpet is not ideal, because it\\u2019s difficult to clean.) She suggested \\u201ca couple of different types of mats \\u2014 one for weights and one for yoga.\\u201d Individual mats can also be placed under equipment like stationary bikes, to dampen noise and catch drops of sweat.\", \"For the walls, Ms. Hollis recommended paint with an eggshell sheen, as it\\u2019s easier to clean than a matte surface.\", \"Or, you could cover the walls with a more durable material. Ms. Hilliard used plywood on the walls of one home gym she designed. Crisp Architects, working with Valerie Grant, an interior designer, created shiplap wainscoting using wood planks for another gym.\", \"All of the designers interviewed for this story also suggested adding mirrors \\u2014 either mirrored walls or large framed mirrors \\u2014 to enlarge the sense of space and let you check your form as you work out.\", \"You don\\u2019t have to blast your workout space with the kind of overhead light you\\u2019d find in a commercial gym. Installing layers of lighting with multiple fixtures \\u2014 and using dimmers to control those fixtures \\u2014 can create a more inviting atmosphere and allow light levels to be adjusted for various activities.\", \"\\u201cWe incorporate a mood light and ambient light for the experience,\\u201d Rush Jenkins, the chief executive of WRJ Design, in Jackson, Wyo., wrote in an email.\", \"And because it\\u2019s a home gym, you can choose fixtures you\\u2019d never see in a commercial gym, like chandeliers, pendants and sconces. \\u201cDepending on the height of the gym space, the main lighting could be a beautiful chandelier, or it could be a subtle flush mount,\\u201d Mr. Jenkins noted.\", \"It\\u2019s also important to consider where the fixtures are positioned in relation to the workout zones, he added: \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want to be down on a mat during exercise and looking up directly into a bright light.\\u201d\", \"To bring in relaxing, atmospheric light without installing new wiring, one option is a portable LED lantern, said Ms. Hollis, who uses an Uma Sound Lantern from Pablo, which doubles as a speaker. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a candle,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd it moves around with me.\\u201d\", \"Using furniture and accessories that make it easy to keep your gym clean and tidy \\u2014 and complete your workout without interruptions \\u2014 will help you stick with an exercise routine.\", \"If you\\u2019ll have foam rollers, resistance bands or boxing gloves, think about where those items will live when you\\u2019re not using them, Ms. Hilliard said. Cabinetry and case goods are ideal, but even a group of baskets on the floor can help.\", \"Adding a bench, stool or chair provides a place to catch your breath between exercises, as well as a spot to throw a towel. And if you like watching TV or listening to music while you work out, and you don\\u2019t plan to use a portable speaker or headphones, add audiovisual equipment to the room.\", \"When space allows, Ms. Hilliard also likes to install a small station similar to a kitchenette. \\u201cSometimes we do custom cabinets, where we have a water cooler or water bottles,\\u201d she said, as well as an area for clean towels and a hamper for used ones. \\u201cAs much as we can give it the look and feel of a high-end gym, so people actually want to go and use it, the better.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3bf3add46d5211ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3bf3add46d5211ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
