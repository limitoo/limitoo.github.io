Wet brush 5. Toothpaste) reminding her how to brush and floss her teeth. It is one of many strategies Ms. Lewis, 34, has learned from \\u201ccognitive rehab,\\u201d an intensive therapy program for Covid-19 survivors whose lives have been upended by problems like brain fog, memory lapses, dizziness and debilitating fatigue.\", \"Nearly two years into the pandemic, advances have been made in treating Covid itself, but long Covid \\u2014 a constellation of lingering health problems that some patients experience \\u2014 remains little understood. Post-Covid clinics around the country are trying different approaches to help patients desperate for answers, but there is little data on outcomes so far, and doctors say it is too soon to know what might work, and for which patients.\", \"While some physical symptoms of long Covid, like shortness of breath or nausea, can be addressed with medication, cognitive issues are more challenging. Few drugs exist, and while some deficits can rebound with time, they can also be exacerbated by resuming activities too soon or intensively.\", \"Over several months, The New York Times visited Ms. Lewis, interviewed her doctors, attended her therapy sessions and read her medical records. Before she was infected with the coronavirus in October 2020, experiencing a modest initial illness that did not require hospitalization, she was successfully juggling a demanding, detail-oriented job while raising a child with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. But this summer, she scored 25 on a 30-point assessment, placing her in a pre-dementia category called mild cognitive impairment.\", \"\\u201cI can feel that things are off,\\u201d she told a neurologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital\\u2019s Neuro Covid-19 Clinic in Chicago who evaluated her and recommended cognitive rehab. \\u201cI approach a red light, my brain knows that it\\u2019s red, but it\\u2019s not reacting to the rest of my body to put my foot on the brake. Do you understand how terrifying that is?\\u201d\", \"In July, she began throwing herself into several sessions a week at Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, a rehabilitation center that for years has helped patients with brain injuries, strokes and other conditions. It has so far treated about 600 Covid survivors. There, an occupational therapist, physical therapist and speech-language pathologist gave Ms. Lewis exercises to strengthen her memory, concentration, balance and endurance.\", \"At home, 40 miles west of Chicago, Ms. Lewis practices the memory and attention exercises with playing cards and a color-coded planner, and the balance exercises using a Post-it marked with an \\u201cX\\u201d affixed to her wall. Smart speakers throughout the tri-level townhouse broadcast reminders like, \\u201cSamantha, it is time to take a break for lunch\\u201d and \\u201cGet your butt ready for bed.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThese are things she legitimately needs,\\u201d Dr. Ashley Stoecker, her primary care physician, said.\", \"Studies estimate that 10 to 30 percent of coronavirus patients may develop long-term symptoms and post-Covid clinics are beginning to characterize the experience.\", \"One year after infection, 63 percent of 156 patients at Mount Sinai Health System\\u2019s post-Covid program reported cognitive problems like trouble with short-term memory and planning. Most reported ongoing brain fog, dizziness, headaches or fatigue, and many reported labored breathing or palpitations. Nearly half of 102 patients had stopped working full time.\", \"Of more than 1,000 patients from around the country evaluated by Northwestern\\u2019s neuro-Covid clinic, many were previously multitaskers with busy jobs, said Dr. Igor Koralnik, who heads the clinic and is Northwestern\\u2019s chief of neuro-infectious diseases and global neurology. In a report about the clinic\\u2019s first 100 patients, the average age was 43.\", \"\\u201cI was a little bit surprised with how young and functional our population was initially,\\u201d Dr. Joshua Cahan, a cognitive neurologist at Northwestern, said. But, he added, the cognitive symptoms have proved especially \\u201cnoticeable to people who are having demanding lives.\\u201d\", \"Long Covid has affected everything for Ms. Lewis. Her slowed reaction time prevented her from driving on highways. She has occasionally pulled over to vomit from motion sickness and once asked her 11-year-old daughter, Mariah, to monitor the rearview mirror so she could focus on the road.\", \"Before Covid, Ms. Lewis was an avid roller skater with the roller derby nickname \\u201cSavage Siren\\u201d; after Covid, her balance became so unsteady, she used a walker and then a cane.\", \"\\u201cShe was so active before,\\u201d said Dr. Stoecker, who has witnessed lapses like the time Ms. Lewis left her wallet in Dr. Stoecker\\u2019s office.\", \"She had to sharply reduce her hours in her job as a director with an agency operating group homes and programs for adults with developmental disabilities and sometimes made mistakes like assigning three employees the same task.\", \"\\u201cMy whole field is developmental disabilities,\\u201d Ms. Lewis said. \\u201cYou hate to be the person that\\u2019s like, \\u2018I need something too.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Especially difficult is feeling less able to support Mariah. \\u201cI\\u2019m her person,\\u201d Ms. Lewis said, lamenting that ringing and buzzing in her ears makes sounds so painful she sometimes has to ask Mariah, who loves to talk, to be quiet.\", \"\\u201cMy cognitive stuff is a little broken,\\u201d she told Mariah. \\u201cWe\\u2019re both in repair.\\u201d\", \"Mariah replied: \\u201cThat\\u2019s hard because you\\u2019re not supposed to be broken.\\u201d\", \"In September, she drove Mariah to autism therapy on the wrong day.\", \"\\u201cI feel so stupid,\\u201d Ms. Lewis exclaimed.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re not stupid, Mom,\\u201d Mariah said. \\u201cYour brain\\u2019s just hurt a little bit and it will get better.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cRepeat this sentence: \\u2018The restaurant is on the top floor of the Bank of America building on 12th,\\u2019\\u201d Melissa Purvis, a speech-language pathologist, instructed Ms. Lewis in late July, soon after she started cognitive rehab.\", \"\\u201cThe restaurant is on the 12th floor of the Bank of America building,\\u201d Ms. Lewis said.\", \"Ms. Purvis asked her to repeat six numbers: 4, 7, 1, 9, 2, 6.\", \"\\u201c4, 7, 2, 5, 6,\\u201d Ms. Lewis replied.\", \"She took overly long to complete a maze. \\u201cThe lines all started to blur together,\\u201d she said.\", \"Out of 10 tests, Ms. Purvis reported, \\u201cThere were five different areas in here where you\\u2019re definitely working below where you should be.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Lewis\\u2019s fianc\\u00e9 at the time, James Moylan (they recently married), was skeptical initially. \\u201cAre we in kindergarten? Is this the best they can come up with?\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cBut now,\\u201d he added, \\u201cit makes sense.\\u201d\", \"What causes post-Covid neurological symptoms is unclear. Theories include inflammation and overactive immune responses. Brain scans and other tests frequently show nothing amiss.\", \"\\u201cOftentimes, doctors will have told them, \\u2018You look fine, this is made up in your head, forget about it,\\u2019\\u201d said Dr. Elliot Roth, an attending physician at the AbilityLab\\u2019s Brain Innovation Center and chairman of physical medicine and rehabilitation at Northwestern.\", \"Some scientists think specific factors could predispose people to long-term symptoms. Forty-two percent of the Northwestern clinic\\u2019s first 100 patients previously had depression or anxiety, though such patients might simply be more comfortable seeking neurological treatment, doctors said. Other pre-existing conditions included autoimmune diseases and headaches.\", \"Ms. Lewis experienced depression as a teenager, was briefly diagnosed with bipolar disorder in college and has since been intermittently treated for depression and anxiety, although she wasn\\u2019t taking psychiatric medication before Covid and hasn\\u2019t needed it since, she and Dr. Stoecker said.\", \"Her few pre-Covid medications, she said, were for tension headaches and hypothyroidism. Her history also included occasional asthma and possibly an underlying autoimmune condition, psoriatic arthritis, which was diagnosed after Covid, Dr. Stoecker said.\", \"Two weeks after testing positive and isolating at home, Ms. Lewis tried returning to work, but lasted only two hours. A scan of her lungs found haziness and constricted airways.\", \"One month post-infection, she had to nap by noon every day and was so dizzy that things spun when she stood or walked. Once, she fainted while putting away groceries, hitting her head on the microwave and kitchen counter. Mariah said she asked, \\u201cAre you OK?\\u201d three times, becoming tearful, before Ms. Lewis opened her eyes.\", \"Two days later, a hospital found no brain injury, she said, but a doctor there suggested she see several specialists, saying her symptoms resembled those of some of his hospital\\u2019s nurses who had struggled with long Covid for months.\", \"Soon after, a pulmonologist mentioned Northwestern\\u2019s clinic and Ms. Lewis scheduled the first available appointment, in late March. While waiting, she visited a local neurologist who suggested she just \\u201ctry harder,\\u201d she said.\", \"A cardiologist detected rapid heart rate. She was diagnosed with a type of dysautonomia called POTS, which can involve dizziness. She saw a gastroenterologist for diarrhea and nausea, and a rheumatologist for arthritis-related knee problems. \", \"But neurological problems agonized her the most. Accustomed to cooking meals from scratch, including lunches for co-workers, she couldn\\u2019t follow recipes. \\u201cI was the person that fed everyone and now I struggle to figure out what I can feed myself,\\u201d she said.\", \"She forgot to pay several bills and couldn\\u2019t remember why she had entered a room.\", \"Such lapses were \\u201creally, really strange\\u201d for someone typically so responsible she seemed to do \\u201cthe job of 12 people,\\u201d Mr. Moylan said. \\u201cIt was almost like she was drunk.\\u201d\", \"When her neuro-Covid clinic appointment came, \\u201cit was very relieving to finally feel validated,\\u201d Ms. Lewis said. Dr. Koralnik prescribed a medication for fatigue, amantadine, which she finds helpful, calling it \\u201czoom-zoom pills.\\u201d\", \"On the cognitive assessment he administered, she scored \\u201csignificantly lower than average\\u201d in processing speed, attention and executive function, he said, and barely average in the remaining category, working memory.\", \"The results were \\u201ccrushing,\\u201d she said.\", \"Dr. Cahan, then on leave, did an in-depth follow-up when he returned in June.\", \"On those tests, Ms. Lewis said, she called a camel a \\u201cdesert llama\\u201d and when asked to count backward from 100 by seven, \\u201cI say 93 and I\\u2019m just stuck.\\u201d\", \"He recommended cognitive rehab, writing: \\u201cI think problems with processing speed are impacting many other cognitive domains. This may interfere with your ability to take in conversations, focus, or try to retrieve memories.\\u201d\", \"Doctors say that a concussion from her kitchen fall possibly made things worse, but that several of her symptoms are more consistent with long Covid. \\u201cWe think that Covid-19 is causing her cognitive ability problems, and we\\u2019ve seen that time and again in more than 800 patients,\\u201d Dr. Koralnik said.\", \" \", \"Over time, Ms. Purvis, the speech-language pathologist, incrementally ramped up the exercises: arrange numbers in descending order, repeat a sentence in reverse. She increased noise and distraction to approximate Ms. Lewis\\u2019s busy work environment. She kept the door open, turned on television news and eventually held sessions in the bustling physical therapy gym.\", \"Amid the hum of treadmills, exercise bikes and other patients\\u2019 conversations, Ms. Lewis worked earnestly to arrange playing cards by suit in ascending order and flip numbers spelled with a \\u201cT,\\u201d like \\u201ctwo.\\u201d Simultaneously, Ms. Purvis recited words and Ms. Lewis tried to raise her hand whenever one started with \\u201cB.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYou missed 12, which is a lot more than you normally miss,\\u201d Ms. Purvis said.\", \"\\u201cAy,\\u201d Ms. Lewis sighed, fingers fidgeting.\", \"Two days later, asked to start at 1 and repeatedly add 9 and subtract 4 until reaching 130, Ms. Lewis was halting and slow.\", \"\\u201cOh my God,\\u201d she exclaimed after finishing. \\u201cThat one was harder.\\u201d\", \"But later, she accurately remembered four statements recited early in the session, including, \\u201cRubber bands last longer when refrigerated.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s been challenging,\\u201d she told Ms. Purvis. \\u201cI don\\u2019t feel super-disheartened, though.\\u201d\", \"Since for some patients physical or cognitive exertion exacerbates symptoms, Dr. Roth said the AbilityLab urges patients to \\u201cpush themselves as much as they can, but not beyond.\\u201d\", \"An occupational therapist, Emillie Asuncion, has also helped. In Ms. Lewis\\u2019s office at work, decorated with some of the \\u201cStar Wars\\u201d paraphernalia her husband collects, she breaks her time into small chunks: reading two pages on the computer, then opening mail, then printing papers before returning to the screen. \", \"In an AbilityLab kitchen, Ms. Asuncion timed Ms. Lewis following a recipe for Instant Pot Tortilla Soup. It took 43 minutes instead of the expected 30.\", \"The goal is to build toward \\u201cthe types of meals that she was able to do before,\\u201d Ms. Asuncion said. \\u201cThe whole point is to be able to have you back into your life.\\u201d\", \" \", \"In one session, Ms. Lewis confided that when looking at staircases or other objects, she saw haloed echoes of the images.\", \"\\u201cI was very scared to say it out loud because I thought that I was hallucinating,\\u201d Ms. Lewis said. But Ms. Asuncion said she was actually experiencing double vision, so the physical therapist, Adam Burns, began eye coordination exercises.\", \"\\u201cThe double vision disturbs her balance,\\u201d Mr. Burns said as he guided her to focus on beads on a string. In other exercises, she stood on a vibrating plate, a wooden rocking platform and a foam pallet, closing her eyes or turning her head, Mr. Burns ready to catch her if she fell.\", \"On a balance test that included climbing stairs and walking a line, she scored 26 out of 30, up from 22 three weeks earlier.\", \"Still, \\u201cshe should have enough stability and control in her body movement to ascend and descend stairs without an issue,\\u201d Mr. Burns said. \\u201cShe\\u2019s too young, she\\u2019s too strong to not get a 30.\\u201d He urged her to stop using her cane.\", \"Ms. Lewis has benefited from an understanding employer \\u2014 allowing her flexible hours, partly at home, and affording time for therapy \\u2014 but by late fall she could no longer afford to work part time and returned to a full-time schedule. Health insurance and workers\\u2019 compensation helped cover medical bills initially but were exhausted as her symptoms lingered, requiring her to borrow from her 401(k) account.\", \"By late September, a Northwestern neuropsychologist wrote on a cognitive evaluation of Ms. Lewis: \\u201cThere has been some improvement with time, rehab therapies and medication.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI actually think she\\u2019s responding a tiny bit quicker and better to some of the interventions than some others do,\\u201d Dr. Roth said.\", \"When he evaluated Ms. Lewis in September, she reported: \\u201cI\\u2019m sending better emails\\u201d and \\u201cI don\\u2019t feel as lost.\\u201d\", \"Still, \\u201cthere\\u2019s certainly a possibility that she may not become fully recovered,\\u201d he said. Many patients have cycles where they improve \\u201cand then they sort of level off.\\u201d Therapists recommend ending rehab when patients\\u2019 goals are met or improvement plateaus.\", \"Steven Jackson, AbilityLab\\u2019s administrative director of outpatient therapy services, said data on patients\\u2019 results was being analyzed, adding that most were \\u201creporting improvement in their ability to function and manage daily tasks, but not necessarily complete resolution of their symptoms or deficits.\\u201d \", \"Dr. Stoecker recently prescribed Adderall for fatigue that still requires Ms. Lewis to nap daily, including in the car while Mr. Moylan drove to Mariah\\u2019s hockey practice in October. The doctor said she has counseled that Ms. Lewis may always need the therapeutic strategies and should be \\u201crealistic and think, \\u2018This is kind of where I am, and I don\\u2019t know that it\\u2019s going to improve.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"As the October anniversary of her Covid diagnosis approached, Ms. Lewis texted, \\u201cI\\u2019m a bit emotional but also feeling strong for having come so far and uncertainty for how much further I can go.\\u201d\", \"But that month, she got encouraging news. When Dr. Cahan re-administered the 30-point test, she scored 29, indicating normal cognition. In November, she was thrilled when, held up by a harness attached to the AbilityLab\\u2019s ceiling, she roller skated around the building. And just before Thanksgiving, she scored 29 on the 30-point balance test and graduated from physical therapy. She hopes to finish the other two therapies in January.\", \"One recent evening in her kitchen, as she prepared frozen turkey meatballs instead of making them from scratch as before, Ms. Lewis reflected.\", \"\\u201cThere might be some adaptations that may always be there,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut if we can get to five out of seven good days, that might be great.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"5549a6a4545b11ecaa23879f594b3677"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5549a6a4545b11ecaa23879f594b3677"}},
