Mr. Endy, a 51-year-old professor of bioengineering at Stanford University, is a star in the emerging field of synthetic biology. He is its most articulate enthusiast, inspiring others to see it as a path to a better world, a transformational technology to feed the planet, conquer disease and combat pollution.\", \"The optimism behind synthetic biology assumes that biology can now largely follow the trajectory of computing, where progress was made possible by the continuous improvement in microchips, with performance doubling and price dropping in half every year or two for decades. The underlying technologies for synthetic biology \\u2014 gene sequencing and DNA synthesis \\u2014 are on similar trends.\", \"As in computing, biological information is coded in DNA, so it can be programmed \\u2014 with the goal of redesigning organisms for useful purposes. The aim is to make such programming and production faster, cheaper and more reliable, more an engineering discipline with reusable parts and automation and less an artisanal craft, as biology has been.\", \"Synthetic biology, proponents say, holds the promise of reprogramming biology to be more powerful and then mass-producing the turbocharged cells to increase food production, fight disease, generate energy, purify water and devour carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\", \"\\u201cBiology and engineering are coming together in profound ways,\\u201d Mr. Endy said. \\u201cThe potential is for civilization-scale flourishing, a world of abundance not scarcity, supporting a growing global population without destroying the planet.\\u201d\", \"That idyllic future is decades off, if it is possible at all. But in the search for the proverbial next big thing over the next 20 years, synthetic biology is a prime candidate. And no one makes the case more persuasively than Mr. Endy.\", \"He sees synthetic biology as a sweeping force that can reshape the sciences, society and culture \\u2014 as the personal computer and internet have \\u2014 rather than just a new industry. Yet Mr. Endy was a founder of two start-ups (one acquired, one folded) and his wife, Christina Smolke, an adjunct professor at Stanford, is chief executive of Antheia, a start-up that uses synthetic biology to make ingredients for essential medicines.\", \"As a nascent industry, Mr. Endy says he believes we are at a turning point \\u2014 one essential to its future. \\u201cFor the first time ever, synthetic biology companies are on the verge of making money instead of consuming money,\\u201d he said.\", \"The money flowing in is still the clearest sign of commercial optimism. Synthetic biology companies raised $9 billion from venture capitalists and initial public offerings worldwide in the first half of this year, more than the amount raised all last year, according to SynBioBeta, an industry newsletter. In 2015, the total raised was $1 billion.\", \"The industry, broadly, is divided into tools makers and product developers. The tool makers include well-established suppliers to synthetic biology companies and others, like the gene sequencers Illumina and Pacific Biosciences, as well as DNA synthesizers, which are younger companies like Twist Bioscience and Codex DNA.\", \"Ginkgo Bioworks, which recently went public, has an all-in-one biofoundry that others can use to make synthetic biology products \\u2014 much as Amazon supplies cloud computing services to many companies.\", \"The product developers, which include organizations from tiny start-ups to pharma giants, are developing products and new manufacturing processes with synthetic biology across the spectrum of industry. Synthetic biology, for example, was employed to accelerate the production of Covid-19 vaccines.\", \"Not every application aims to save lives or the planet. Cronos, a Canadian company, is using synthetic biology to develop cannabis edibles. Zbiotics, a San Francisco start-up, has a hangover killer.\", \"But there are elements of the potential Mr. Endy sees for transformation of major industries. Bayer, whose agricultural interests include the DEKALB seed business, is creating nitrogen-fixing microbes to apply to seeds, potentially reducing the use of chemical fertilizer.\", \"Lululemon, the athleisure wear maker, is working with a start-up, Genomatica, to shift from petrochemical-based nylon to bio-built fabrics. Impossible Foods uses synthetic biology to create its plant-based burgers. Bridgestone is exploring the use of bio-based alternatives for chemical polymers used in producing tires. And Amyris, an early synthetic biology company, has become a thriving supplier of ingredients for the cosmetics and fragrance industry.\", \"Mr. Endy\\u2019s technical achievements include work in amplifying genetic logic, rewritable DNA data storage, genome refactoring and developing reusable biological parts. But perhaps his greatest skills are as a communicator and a social engineer.\", \"This sometimes manifests in the form of seemingly outlandish, calculated exaggerations and clever turns of phrase \\u2014 all part of his verbal arsenal.\", \"He\\u2019ll hold up a smartphone and say that in not so many years it can be made with synthetic biology. Who knows if it could be done or, if so, it would ever make economic sense. But his point is the vast potential of synthetic biology to produce new materials.\", \"The annual garden clippings of the small city of Menlo Park, Calif., carted away into compost, Mr. Endy said, weigh more than the global production of microchips. Well, maybe, but they are hardly comparable.\", \"\\u201cYes, it\\u2019s a provocation,\\u201d Mr. Endy replied. \\u201cBut it points to first principles. Biology is literally a surplus manufacturing capacity. It happens so much we don\\u2019t think about it. Biology is making this stuff for free.\\u201d\", \"Another Endy one-liner: \\u201cAll atoms are local.\\u201d So synthetic biology lashed to the internet will enable a \\u201cdesign anywhere, grow everywhere\\u201d paradigm that could, he said, lead to a \\u201cmassive upgrading of local manufacturing\\u201d and an economic \\u201crebalancing in favor of deglobalization.\\u201d\", \"Synthetic biology, according to Mr. Endy, could also prompt a rethinking of humanity\\u2019s relationship to nature. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an expression of human intention in partnership with nature,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re speaking with life.\\u201d\", \"The technology can also be used to increase biodiversity and protect endangered species. Ocean warming, for example, is destroying coral reefs. But corals in the Red Sea have remarkable heat tolerance. Altering coral genes to mimic the Red Sea varieties could halt the decline and possibly revive coral reefs worldwide.\", \"Some of these theoretical applications may sound far-fetched, but Mr. Endy\\u2019s intent is to stretch minds and inspire \\u2014 and he is often successful.\", \"\\u201cWhen I talk to him, I feel as if my I.Q. has dropped,\\u201d said Emily Leproust, an organic chemist and chief executive of Twist Bioscience, one of the DNA synthesis specialists. \\u201cHe\\u2019s thinking on a different plane, offering a larger vision of what we are doing.\\u201d\", \"Jason Kelly recalled being a senior at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the fall of 2002 when Mr. Endy gave a guest lecture in a biology class. Until then, Mr. Kelly found biology filled with tedious lab work, and he was questioning whether to continue. But he was captivated by Mr. Endy, who spoke of the future and potential.\", \"\\u201cI literally chased him down in the hall,\\u201d recalled Mr. Kelly, who went on to earn a Ph.D. in biological engineering at M.I.T. (Mr. Endy was his thesis adviser) and to become a founder and chief executive of Ginkgo Bioworks.\", \"\\u201cDrew Endy is first and foremost a great community builder,\\u201d Mr. Kelly said. \\u201cHis message is, Here\\u2019s a vision of the future. Let\\u2019s get together and try to make it happen.\\u201d\", \"In an attempt to build that community, Mr. Endy was a founder and continues to be a board member in two major nonprofit organizations designed to enlarge the synthetic biology community.\", \"BioBricks Foundation organizes scientists and engineers to develop standardized DNA parts \\u2014 biological building blocks for use in synthetic biology. Contributors agree to let others freely use the biobricks \\u2014 much as open-source software projects operate.\", \"The International Genetically Engineered Machine Foundation, or iGEM, runs annual contests for teams of students making synthetic biology projects, from kits of biobricks. An estimated 60,000 students from teams worldwide have participated in the competitions since 2004.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s been transformational for the field, getting young people involved and opening their eyes to the potential to build life instead of just observing it,\\u201d said David Haussler, a professor of biomolecular engineering at the University of California, Santa Cruz. \\u201cDrew Endy has been a mentor to a whole new generation.\\u201d\", \"Synthetic biology holds great promise, but there is a dark side as well. Hacking biology and democratizing the tools to do so raises the specter of an angry loner or terrorist group creating a build-your-own pandemic genetically targeted at their enemies, among other potential horrors.\", \"Mr. Endy, though synthetic biology\\u2019s champion, has been cleareyed about the risks since the outset. He was the lead author of a report for the Pentagon\\u2019s advanced research agency in 2003 that laid out a framework for developing synthetic biology and managing its risks. In the report, he assessed the spectrum of dangers and imagined the bad-actor threat as \\u201cBin Laden Genetics.\\u201d\", \"Today, risk management, Mr. Endy said, should start with the assumption that in the not too distant future \\u201canyone, anywhere can make any virus from scratch.\\u201d\", \"One line of protection is synthetic biology itself. For example, Mr. Endy points to the possibility of advanced technologies like engineered chromosomes that would give humans a built-in defense system, say, against the world\\u2019s top 20 pathogens.\", \"But countermeasures are also dependent on social cohesion and institutional effectiveness of the kind that have proved challenging during the Covid-19 pandemic \\u2014 like resistance to getting vaccinated and wearing masks, and gaps in the public health system.\", \"The risks, Mr. Endy acknowledges, are worrisome, and they contribute to qualms about the entire synthetic biology endeavor. It can easily be cast as an unnerving, if not unholy, tampering with nature.\", \"His big-tent community building seeks to create enthusiasm, even affection, for next-generation biotechnology, much as he felt toward his personal computer \\u2014 a Franklin Ace, produced by a long-gone Apple clone maker \\u2014 as a 12-year-old.\", \"Like the personal computer, synthetic biology, he suggests, is a powerful technology, more good than bad, and one that can even inspire an emotional connection. \\u201cWhy did I run out of the house with the computer? Because I loved it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cCan a society fall in love with biotechnology? That\\u2019s my bet.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"dfcfb0014c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dfcfb0014c4711ecb6d203fcfb2b7f03"}},
