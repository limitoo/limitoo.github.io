The illustrators often end up mimicking the style of the artist in question, with results that tend to look like unconvincing hybrids. Also, picture book biographies are prone to feel more like hagiographies, where events or personality traits that might be awkward or boring to explain to a child reader are sugarcoated or altogether omitted. There are exceptions, of course, and fortunately the authors of the three books presented here avoid those typical problems, each in their own way.\", \"In \\u201cA Boy Named Isamu,\\u201d James Yang imagines an ideal, almost oneiric day in the life of the sculptor Isamu Noguchi as a young child. At the market, in the forest and on the beach, the solitary boy observes the things he encounters \\u2014 stones, grass, sticks, leaves, sand and more \\u2014 and asks himself questions about them. He feels textures, hears sounds, notices shapes and colors. Even though we don\\u2019t see Isamu carrying home all the objects he finds during his journey, with a delicate turn of the page they appear in his bedroom, as if waiting for him, implicitly suggesting they might be an inspiration for the sculptures he will make many years later.\", \"The text, composed of brief, uncomplicated sentences, is as quiet and minimal as the digital illustrations. I sometimes wished for a more specific and varied treatment of all the different materials\\u2019 textures, which would have been a nice, subtle homage to Noguchi\\u2019s art. But Yang\\u2019s compositions are soothing, his palette is harmonious, and the protagonist is sweet and lovable. The overall feel is warm and comforting, especially for a child who might be as sensitive and imaginative as Isamu.\", \"Shahzia Sikander moved to the United States from her native Pakistan as a young artist, trained in traditional miniature painting. In \\u201cRoots and Wings,\\u201d written in collaboration with Amy Novesky, she relates the story of her lively early years. She climbs trees, beats boys at cricket, trains pigeons with her cousins. Her big home is filled with books from all over the world and she watches Bollywood movies as well as American westerns. She travels with her family to Rome, where she is charmed by the Sistine Chapel. In the book\\u2019s most childlike line (my favorite), she tells us, \\u201cMichelangelo and I share a birthday.\\u201d We see her paint, first by herself at home and later in art school with the guidance of a miniature-painting master. \\u201cArt is my ritual, my ticket to new worlds\\u201d is the earnest clue to a dramatic and effective scene change; on the next page we see her on the streets of New York, ready to begin her life as an artist, far from home. The accomplished illustrator Hanna Barczyk, in her debut English-language picture book, gives the story a convincing, personal interpretation. I presume it was not an easy task to illustrate a book about a living painter who also happens to be the book\\u2019s author, but Barczyk manages to stay beautifully true to her own style. Her paintings \\u2014 a digitally assembled mix of ink, gouache and acrylic \\u2014 have an appealing fanciful quality even when depicting realistic scenes, and the carefully balanced blend of warm and cool colors gives the book a satisfying unity.\", \"\\u201cBefore I Grew Up\\u201d is a very unusual picture book compared to most produced by the current American children\\u2019s book industry. It tells the story of the Italian painter Giuliano Cucco\\u2019s childhood in the first person, but it is written by an old friend of his, John Miller. As Miller explains in a short afterword, the two had collaborated decades earlier on four books, none of which were published \\u201cbecause reproducing full-color illustrations was too expensive back then.\\u201d Fifty years later, when things had changed and Enchanted Lion was eager to publish their work, Miller tried to get in touch with Cucco to give him the good news, only to learn that he and his wife had been killed by a motor scooter in a pedestrian crossing in 2006. Looking through the late painter\\u2019s archive in Rome, Miller found a group of paintings related to Cucco\\u2019s childhood. He selected and arranged some of those pictures, complementing them with short, interpretive sentences.\", \"The alluring result is the imaginary life of the artist as a young boy, told through a sequence of lyrical scenes, some more obviously interconnected than others. As the tale begins, we see the boy play an odd game with his \\u201ctall and very beautiful\\u201d mother, a game that involves a yellow rag doll and a mirror, while a group of eccentric relatives and a priest look on, seemingly annoyed. In the next spread, we see him in his room, where he makes paper boats that he lets \\u201cfloat away like dreams.\\u201d Dreams and boats are recurrent themes in the story, as is light. The father, we learn, is a scientist who studies light. We don\\u2019t know what kind of scientist he is, or what kind of light he is looking for when he rows his boat out in the ocean, but we don\\u2019t need to. What we know for sure is that when the boy successfully attempts to paint that same light, his father\\u2019s approval makes him certain he will \\u201cgrow up to be an artist.\\u201d This is not an easy book to summarize, and there are a number of fascinating and unexpected situations that are best left to the reader to experience directly.\", \"I am glad that all three of these books focus on the artists\\u2019 childhoods \\u2014 real or imagined \\u2014 and wisely steer clear of their adult lives, except for some information in the back matter. In his author\\u2019s note, Yang quotes Noguchi as saying, \\u201cWhen an artist stopped being a child, he would stop being an artist.\\u201d In his 1968 autobiography, \\u201cA Sculptor\\u2019s World,\\u201d Noguchi attributes that remark to the Romanian artist Constantin Brancusi, who also said: \\u201cWhen we are no longer children, we are already dead.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"61b5186243f611ec9b1c6920cbb7425e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"61b5186243f611ec9b1c6920cbb7425e"}},
