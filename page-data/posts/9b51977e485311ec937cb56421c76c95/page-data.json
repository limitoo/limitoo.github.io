But I do understand this issue because I read accounts from parents, from educators.\\\"\", \"He told Cuomo Prime Time that when he was in school: \\\"We learnt about the Civil War. They mentioned racism, we understood slavery and Lincoln...but they didn't really go into it and more than Gone with the Wind goes into it.\", \"\\\"Now we are doing that and I think it's a good thing,\\\" he said, \\\"that's different than teaching that racism is the essence of America, that's what people get upset about.\", \"\\\"Or involving children, who are probably not old enough or sophisticated enough to understand this very complicated issue,\\\" he added.\", \"Cuomo said that many parents believed that CRT was a way \\\"to make white kids feel badly about what happened before them and that their lives should be a function of making up for it.\\\"\", \"Maher replied: \\\"Kids are taught and sometimes separated into groups, oppressor and oppressed.\", \"\\\"Does a kid even know what those words mean? Would they gravitate toward that if you hadn't told them?\\\"\", \"Cuomo raised the argument that people want children to be taught about the realities of racism and \\\"otherwise you're just hiding from the truth.\\\"\", \"Maher replied, \\\"That's nuts. That's just silly. It's just virtue signaling.\\\"\", \"Education experts have voiced concerns that CRT is being misrepresented as simply teaching about slavery and other historical events that have any mention of race.\", \"\\\"People are overreacting. Critical race theory is nothing but the civil rights movement history.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935223/tv-host-bill-maher.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">TV host Bill Maher at ArcLight Hollywood on October 24, 2017, in Hollywood, California.
