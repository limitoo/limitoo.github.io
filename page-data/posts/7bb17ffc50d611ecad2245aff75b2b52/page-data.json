It has so far been identified in Britain, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, the Netherlands and other places, usually in people who had recently returned from southern Africa. Here\\u2019s a map of cases.\", \"Nations in southern Africa protested bitterly as more of the world\\u2019s wealthiest countries cut them off from travel, renewing a debate over pandemic border closings and compounding the problems facing poorly vaccinated countries. Australia, Britain and the E.U. were among those that barred travelers from South Africa and nearby countries.\", \"Scientists scrambled to gather data on the variant. Early findings suggest Omicron may be more transmissible and better able to evade the body\\u2019s immune responses than previous versions of the virus. But vaccines may well continue to ward off severe illness and death. Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are preparing to reformulate their shots if necessary.\", \"What\\u2019s in a name: The W.H.O. skipped two Greek letters in naming the variant, avoiding Nu, too easily confused with \\u201cnew,\\u201d and Xi, a common Chinese surname and the name of China\\u2019s leader.\", \"Go deeper: Researchers can design and mass-produce genetic material, a technique that helped build the mRNA vaccines. What could they give us next?\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"Supply shortages continue to bedevil Britain, causing the government to fret about disruptions to the holidays. A lack of truck drivers, combined with global shipping delays, product shortages, the pandemic and Brexit restrictions, has left some supermarket shelves bare and retailers warning that not every Christmas gift will be available.\", \"An offer by the British government to grant 5,000 temporary visas to truck drivers from continental Europe has had little appeal to Polish drivers, who say they can make comparable money in less-xenophobic European countries closer to home. As of mid-October, a Conservative Party official said that a little more than 20 applications had been approved.\", \"To reduce the reliance on truck drivers, some have come up with creative solutions. Every weekend, a 32-car, 1,600-foot \\u201cwine train\\u201d travels 100 miles between the port of Tilbury and Daventry, carrying almost 650,000 bottles of wine to distribute to stores. Britons might at least have a decent stock of alcohol during Christmas.\", \"Talking turkey: Companies in the Food and Drink Federation had been used to 97 percent of their orders arriving on time. Now, one-fifth of items will not show up when expected \\u2014 and which ones will be missing from the holiday table is anyone\\u2019s guess, the group\\u2019s chief executive said.\", \"The longstanding covert cyberwar between Israel and Iran is expanding past military targets, as millions of civilians bear the brunt of the shadow campaign. No one has died in the latest attacks, but if their goal was to create chaos, anger and emotional distress on a large scale, they succeeded wildly.\", \"In recent weeks, a cyberattack on Iran\\u2019s nationwide fuel distribution system paralyzed the country\\u2019s 4,300 gas stations, which took 12 days to have service fully restored. And in Israel, the intimate details of hundreds of thousands of people\\u2019s sex lives were stolen from an L.G.B.T.Q. dating site and uploaded on social media.\", \"As hopes fade for a diplomatic resurrection of the Iranian nuclear agreement, such attacks are likely to proliferate. Nondefense computer networks are generally less secure than those tied to state security assets.\", \"News from the region: Iran violently cracked down on protests against growing water shortages as the vast majority of the country confronted drought.\", \"The woman on the bridge: The police and prosecutors spent five years chasing a domestic violence case. Would it be enough?\", \"The arts and fashion worlds this weekend lost two greats. Stephen Sondheim, one of the most influential songwriters in the history of musical theater, died at 91 early Friday. And on Sunday, Virgil Abloh, the barrier-breaking Black fashion designer, died at 41 after a two-year battle with a rare cancer.\", \"Several youngsters are winning praise this season for their roles in prestige drama \\u2014 among them Jude Hill, who stars as Buddy in \\u201cBelfast\\u201d; Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton, who play Venus and Serena Williams in \\u201cKing Richard\\u201d; Woody Norman, who appears with Joaquin Phoenix in \\u201cC\\u2019mon C\\u2019mon\\u201d; and Daniel Ranieri in the George Clooney-directed drama \\u201cThe Tender Bar.\\u201d\", \"For The Times, Sarah Bahr spoke to these young stars about their time in the limelight. Here are edited extracts from their conversations.\", \"Jude Hill, 11: The first time I saw my face on a poster I thought, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not real.\\u201d I\\u2019m still just a normal kid, and this is my first film, but I think if you work hard, then you can achieve anything.\", \"Demi Singleton, 14: Any role that highlights how powerful women can be is a role I want to be in. I also really want to do an action movie like \\u201cWonder Woman\\u201d or \\u201cBlack Widow,\\u201d because that\\u2019s been my dream ever since I was a little girl.\", \"Daniel Ranieri, 10: I didn\\u2019t always want to be an actor. I wanted to be a race driver, and then I changed my mind and wanted to be a firefighter, but now I\\u2019m really stuck on being an actor.\", \"Woody Norman, 12: What I want people watching the film to take away is that young people are humans with opinions just as valid as yours. We are not children or babies.\", \"This vegan chili uses store-cupboard staples to add umami depth, acidity and brightness.\", \"\\u201cLicorice Pizza\\u201d is a shaggy 1970s romp about a self-important teenage boy and a memorable woman.\", \"Celebrate the hilarious, heartbreaking life and music of Malcolm Arnold on the British composer\\u2019s centenary.\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: Animal aptly found hidden in \\u201cbanana peel\\u201d (three letters).\", \"And here is the Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.
