So could Laura Ingraham, Mark Levin or Donald Trump himself.\", \"One of these conservative figures could go on the air and explain that the Omicron variant has placed much of their audience in grave danger. They could remind people that they have been skeptical of vaccines at times \\u2014 but that Omicron is different. It is so contagious that it may quickly sweep the country.\", \"As they issued this warning, they could still take their usual swipes at the political left, mocking panicky liberals for wearing masks outdoors and forcing children to sit apart in cold schoolyards. Conservatives don\\u2019t need to do any of that; they just need to take a Covid-19 vaccine \\u2014 the \\u201cTrump vaccine\\u201d that could save their life.\", \"I don\\u2019t have any illusions about how likely this scenario is, but I do think that unvaccinated Americans \\u2014 who are disproportionately Republican \\u2014 are now in even more danger than a few weeks ago. Omicron seems to be qualitatively more contagious than any earlier variant. As my colleague Emily Anthes writes, in a roundup of the latest developments:\", \"In the U.S., partisanship is the biggest factor determining vaccination rates. If Democratic voters made up their own country, it would be one of the world\\u2019s most vaccinated, with more than 91 percent of adults having received at least one shot. Only about 60 percent of Republican adults have done so.\", \"This vaccination gap has created a huge gap in death rates, one that has grown sharply during the second half of the year.\", \"The chart below is based on data from Charles Gaba, a health care analyst who has split the country into 10 equally sized groups. The Trump line refers to the one-tenth of Americans who live in counties that voted most heavily for Trump last year, while the Biden line is the equivalent for the president\\u2019s best counties. The line labeled \\u201cswing\\u201d describes counties where each candidate won at least 45 percent of the votes:\", \"One telling detail is that Covid deaths in both swing counties and heavily Biden counties have not risen over the past two months, even as nationwide case numbers have surged. In heavily vaccinated communities, rising caseloads don\\u2019t automatically lead to rising death tolls.\", \"In hundreds of U.S. counties, though, most adults still have not received a Covid vaccine shot. \\u201cJust since this summer, 150,000 unvaccinated Americans have needlessly lost their lives despite the widespread availability of vaccines,\\u201d Dr. Peter Hotez of the Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, said yesterday.\", \"Vaccine skepticism stems in part from messages on social media and conservative outlets like Fox News, the Sinclair Broadcast Group and talk radio. Pundits on these platforms often stop short of telling people not to get vaccinated, even as they send a general negative message about the shots.\", \"They criticize vaccine mandates, sensationalize rare side effects and describe vaccination as a personal choice. They certainly do not deliver the clear message that scientists and Democratic politicians have: Get vaccinated, please, as soon as possible.\", \"The fact that many of conservative pundits are vaccinated themselves would make a pro-vaccine message from them even stronger. It would surely be more persuasive than anything that President Biden, Anthony Fauci, Rochelle Walensky or a New York Times journalist could say.\", \"Biden, at the White House yesterday, tried his best, saying, \\u201cWe are looking at a winter of severe illness and death if you\\u2019re unvaccinated.\\u201d\", \"There is still a chance that Omicron will be less bad than scientists fear. Some early evidence suggests it is less severe than earlier versions of the virus. And a substantial number of unvaccinated Americans have also had Covid before, giving them some level of immunity.\", \"Still, unvaccinated people appear to be in real danger. For one thing, immunity wanes over time. For another, millions of adults have no immunity, having been neither vaccinated nor infected.\", \"Finally, Omicron appears to be so contagious that even a modest decline in severity \\u2014 such as the decline estimated in an early analysis from South Africa \\u2014 could still lead to a large spike in deaths, as Dr. Robert Wachter of the University of California, San Francisco, explained to me.\", \"Some basic arithmetic makes the point: Imagine that the risk of death is 30 percent lower from an Omicron case than a Delta case \\u2014 but that Omicron leads to a tenfold increase in cases. This combination would lead to a substantial increase in deaths. \\u201cIt\\u2019s bad number times a decent number, and you end up with a bad number,\\u201d Wachter said.\", \"For vaccinated Americans, Omicron creates a complicated set of questions, and I\\u2019ll write more about them next week, including: When should I get boosted? (Now, experts say.) When should schools close? (Rarely.) How much should older people change their behavior? (It depends on their health, and it\\u2019s a vexing question regardless.)\", \"For the unvaccinated, however, the best medical advice is clear: Get a shot that may save your life. The question is whether unvaccinated Americans will hear that message from the voices they trust.\", \"\\u201cHe believed another world was possible,\\u201d Laila Soueif writes about her son, a political activist imprisoned in Egypt.\", \"School mask mandates are based on very shaky science, David Zweig writes in The Atlantic.\", \"Dance: A close look at this year\\u2019s \\u201cNutcracker\\u201d costumes.\", \"Meet Si Spiegel: He bombed the Nazis, outwitted the Soviets and modernized Christmas.\", \"Scam: That job at Harvard?
