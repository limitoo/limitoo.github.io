While voicing the character of Gene, Mirman emphasizes a youthful exuberance and optimism and cadence that\\u2019s slightly more upbeat than his everyday adult voice.\", \"To prepare, try yawning, relaxing your jaw, raising your arms, hitting yourself in the chest, smiling while saying a happy line. Keep a glass of water or tea nearby. Mirman records on his feet; a music stand holds his script. \\u201cI stand so I can do the physical actions described,\\u201d says Mirman, who works out of a soundproof booth in his home. \\u201cIf you have to make running noises, you probably wiggle your body in a slight running way mimicking the actions.\\u201d\", \"Develop relationships with your fellow performers. When you get together, whether in person or online, it helps to chitchat and catch up with one another. Mirman has known his castmates for years (they were hired partly, he says, \\u201cbecause we already knew each other\\u201d), and that has fostered the \\u201cfamilial\\u201d comfort level needed to go off on ad-libbing tangents. Comedy productions in particular require improvisational freedom. \\u201cIn the second episode of \\u2018Bob\\u2019s,\\u2019 there\\u2019s a whole part where Bob is trapped in the wall of their home,\\u201d Mirman says. \\u201cAnd Gene starts talking to him about \\u2018The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe\\u2019 and how he\\u2019s sure Salman Rushdie wrote it. It was just this random thing we improvised, and it actually got used.\\u201d\", \"Even when following the script or the director\\u2019s guidance \\u2014 whether recording solo or with the cast \\u2014 try not to just say one line at a time. Make it feel as if you\\u2019re responding inside the scene. \\u201cYou want it to sound like you\\u2019re discovering it as you\\u2019re saying that thought,\\u201d Mirman says.\"]","href_hash":"4527f510414511eca54adbac1943da9b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4527f510414511eca54adbac1943da9b"}},
