In this case, Primus said demonstrating gross negligence would likely require prosecutors to present proof that the parents did not take the proper care to avert the attack that an ordinary person would, prooving the parents' culpability by demonstrating potential disregard.\", \"To prove causation, Primus said the prosecutor has to establish that the parents caused the deaths in the attack, and the proof must be established in two ways. First, Primus said, prosecutors must establish that had the parents not conducted themselves in a certain way, the deaths would not have occurred. If Crumbley did indeed use the gun that his parents purchased to carry out the alleged attack, Primus said this will be easier to establish. The second part requires proof that the parents were liable and could be a greater challenge.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946361/police-search-home-andrzej-sikora-crumbleys-shooter.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">James Crumbley and his wife Jennifer Crumbley have been charged with four counts of involuntary manslaughter after their son Ethan Crumbley allegedly fatally shot four students at Oxford High School on November 30, 2021 in Oxford, Michigan.</div>\", \"Here, Primus said the prosecutor must answer whether the attack was something the parents could \\\"reasonably foresee having happened, given their negligent actions.\\\" This is where trying Ethan Crumbley as an adult comes into play. Because, according to Primus, if Ethan Crumbley is an adult that acted on his own accord, this could break the link between James and Jennifer's parenting and the attack, working against the proof for causation.\", \"When it comes to the decision to charge Crumbley's parents, Primus does not expect to see much of an effect on Ethan Crumbley's case.\"]","href_hash":"cc55d3de5db711ec8c1b27afd118f0fe"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cc55d3de5db711ec8c1b27afd118f0fe"}},
