A hood will be placed over the head of the inmate, who will be given the opportunity to make a last statement.\", \"South Carolina is one of eight states to still use the electric chair and one of four to allow a firing squad, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center.\", \"Moore is one of 35 men on South Carolina's death row. He exhausted his federal appeals in 2020, and the state Supreme Court denied another appeal this week.\", \"However, Associate Justice Kaye Hearn wrote a blunt 14-page dissent.\", \"\\\"The death penalty should be reserved for those who commit the most heinous crimes in our society, and I do not believe Moore's crimes rise to that level,\\\" Hearn wrote.\", \"Lindsey Vann, an attorney for Moore, said Thursday she will ask the court to stay the execution.\", \"The state last \\u00a0scheduled an execution for Moore in 2020, which was then delayed \\u00a0after prison officials said they couldn't obtain lethal injection drugs.\", \"During Moore's 2001 trial, prosecutors said Moore entered the store looking for money to support his cocaine habit and got into a dispute with Mahoney, who drew a pistol that Moore wrestled away from him.\", \"Mahoney pulled a second gun, and a gunfight ensued. Mahoney shot Moore in the arm, and Moore shot Mahoney in the chest. Prosecutors said Moore left a trail of blood through the store as he looked for cash, stepping twice over Mahoney.\", \"At the time, Moore claimed that he acted in self-defense after Mahoney drew the first gun.\", \"Moore's supporters have argued his crime doesn't rise to the level of heinousness in other death penalty cases in the state. His appeals lawyers have said that because Moore didn't bring a gun into store, he couldn't have intended to kill someone when he walked in.\", \"In 2020, South Carolina\\u00a0postponed\\u00a0Moore's execution after the state could not obtain the drugs to carry out lethal injection. Moore was given the option but declined the alternative execution method: electrocution.\", \"South Carolina's last execution was in 2011, when Jeffrey Motts, on death row for strangling a cellmate while serving a life sentence for another murder, abandoned his appeals and opted for the death chamber.\", \"The last time the state executed someone by electrocution was 2008.\"]","href_hash":"7b15bb26b72e11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7b15bb26b72e11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
