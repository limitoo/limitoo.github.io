The purpose of this policy, officials said, is to protect \\\"unvaccinated people against infection, illness and hospital admission in high-risk locations.\\\"\", \"The Netherlands has a Pass System that can be used to travel within the European Union and access public spaces such as restaurants or events. The passes can be given to those who are vaccinated against COVID-19, have previously recovered from the virus, or have proof of a negative test. With the new legislation, officials are trying to restrict the system to eliminate the latter requirement for obtaining a pass in an effort to encourage vaccination.\", \"Dutch officials have already made social distancing mandatory again for all adults, regardless of vaccination status. They have advised that people stay 1.5 meters, or five feet, from one another and must be enforced by businesses.\", \"The measures come after the country's health institute reported an increase in cases, hospitalizations and deaths. Hospital admissions increased 19 percent over the past seven days, with intensive care admissions rising 26 percent. A new weekly case record was met on Tuesday, with the infection rate climbing 39 percent.

Law enforcement can issue fines if people do not comply.\", \"Children under 12 had the highest proportion of positive tests in the week up to Tuesday. The European Union's drug regulator is expected to issue a decision later this week on a request by Pfizer and BioNTech to approve their COVID-19 vaccine for children aged 5 to 11.\", \"A panel of experts that advises the Dutch government urged people this week to improve basic virus-fighting measures such as social distancing and mask-wearing, saying that many people are not adhering to a partial lockdown introduced more than a week ago.\", \"A protest Friday against the COVID-19 pass system in Rotterdam degenerated into violence that led to police officers opening fire on rioters.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938927/dutch-crowd.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Dutch government announced on Tuesday that it is making social distancing mandatory again for all adults starting Wednesday after coronavirus infection numbers hit a new weekly record, climbing 39 percent, while hospital and intensive care unit admissions also rose sharply.
