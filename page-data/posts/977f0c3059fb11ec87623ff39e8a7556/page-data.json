Many veteran Kellogg workers, who the company says earn about $35 per hour on average, believe that adding lower-paid workers puts downward pressure on their wages.\", \"Kellogg raised the possibility of hiring permanent replacements in November. The company and the union last week reached a tentative agreement in which the company would lift a cap on the number of workers in the lower tier, which was 30 percent under the previous contract. In exchange, the company agreed to move all workers with four or more years experience into the veteran tier, as well as an amount equivalent to 3 percent of workers at its plants in each of the five years of the contract.\", \"On Tuesday, the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers International Union, which represents the workers, said its members had \\u201coverwhelmingly voted\\u201d against the deal. In response to the result, Kellogg said that it would \\u201chire permanent replacement employees in positions vacated by striking workers.\\u201d\", \"A Kellogg spokeswoman said Friday that the company had posted job listings for permanent replacement roles in each of its four locations and that its hiring process was \\u201cfully operational.\\u201d The statement added: \\u201cInterest in the roles has been strong at all four plants, as expected. We expect some of the new hires to start with the company very soon.\\u201d\", \"Permanently replacing workers who are striking over economic issues like wages and benefits is legal, but Democrats, including Mr. Biden, have sought to outlaw the practice through the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act. The House approved the bill in March but it has stalled in the Senate.\", \"\\u201cI have long opposed permanent striker replacements and I strongly support legislation that would ban that practice,\\u201d Mr. Biden said in his statement Friday. \\u201cSuch action undermines the critical role collective bargaining plays in providing workers a voice and the opportunity to improve their lives.\\u201d\", \"The statement is not the first time Mr. Biden has appeared to weigh in on a prominent labor action. The president appeared in a video during a union campaign at an Amazon warehouse in Alabama this year warning that \\u201cthere should be no intimidation, no coercion, no threats, no anti-union propaganda\\u201d \\u2014 an unusual interjection by a president during a union election.\", \"Mr. Biden has made no secret of his support for unions over the years. He quickly ousted government officials disliked by unions, reversed Trump-era rules that softened worker protections and signed legislation that allocated tens of billions of dollars to stabilize union pension plans.\", \"His nearly $2 trillion climate and social policy bill, pending in the Senate, includes numerous pro-labor measures, including incentives for employers to offer union-scale wages on wind and solar projects.\"]","href_hash":"977f0c3059fb11ec87623ff39e8a7556"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"977f0c3059fb11ec87623ff39e8a7556"}},
