You can probably include the Wallabies themselves in this, too.\", \"Australia v England in anything \\u2014 cricket, rugby, marbles \\u2014 provokes emotion and rivalry in equal parts.\", \"Add into the mix the Old Enemy being coached by an Australian who himself was sacked as Wallabies coach back in the day, and has never really forgiven his native country for it, and this clash has all the spicy ingredients you could hope for.\", \"Eddie Jones has been front-and-centre yet again this week because this is precisely the environment in which he relishes.

But Jones was having none of it.\", \"\\\"The big thing for young players is distractions,\\\" Jones said in response.\", \"\\\"Distractions can be the exposure they get in the media, the praise and criticism they get, groups of agents who see this guy as the next big thing.\", \"\\\"There's a reason why the girl who won the US Open [Emma Raducanu] hasn't done so well afterwards.

He missed the Tonga game after what turned out to be a false-positive test result for the virus.\", \"And despite the Wallabies' disappointing showing in the loss to Scotland last weekend, Jones is now going to great lengths to explain the challenge of facing Australia\\u00a0\\u2014 against whom the head-to-head stands at 25 wins apiece and one draw dating back to 1909.\", \"\\\"It is probably hard for the English to understand how important this is for Australia.
