This is a reminder that climbing on roofs at any time is risky behaviour and even more so when intoxicated,\\\" Bond said.\", \"\\\"Overall the behaviour has been good, but unfortunately there have been a few idiots that police have had to speak to to remind them of acceptable behaviour, and so far no arrests.\", \"\\\"Extra police are rostered on today and will be having a presence in and around the North Dunedin area, as well as breath testing motorists in and around Dunedin to ensure those that do choose to drink, don't drive.\\\"\", \"Police are also investigating a couch fire on Castle Street that started around 9am.\", \"Bond said many young people in the area had been drinking since early this morning and there was a large gathering at the address where the fire was lit.\", \"\\\"There are large amounts of people wandering around the streets, intoxication is getting up there and unfortunately there was one fire in the front of a residential property in Castle Street around 9am, which was of concern to us and [Fire and Emergency].\", \"\\\"So we're still monitoring the situation and doing foot patrols in and around the North Dunedin area.\\\"\", \"Bond said in the past few years police had taken \\\"a very hardline approach\\\" to fires being lit in the university area.\", \"\\\"Unfortunately, there was a large gathering at the address at the time, so information is limited but the investigation is ongoing.\\\"\", \"There were also a number of large gatherings in the area, including at Brackens Lookout - which regularly attracted St Patrick's Day party-goers.\", \"\\\"It is the same as previous years, where a large number of people are drunk by 9am which is disappointing and they're putting themselves in danger as well being so close to the one-way systems,\\\" Bond said.\", \"\\\"It seems very similar to previous years. There are a number of students that have caught Covid and have been through their isolation period and are out the other side looking for some good times and unfortunately due to the red [light] settings those large events aren't happening at the moment to entertain them.\", \"\\\"So days like today are when they're taking the opportunity to party but they are still gathering in excess of the 100-person limit.\\\"\", \"Covid-19 remained a concern in the area with numerous flats still isolating, he said.\"]","href_hash":"a4aa432ca5c611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a4aa432ca5c611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
