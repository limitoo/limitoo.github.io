The manhunt ended with their arrests around 1:30 a.m. Saturday, after the authorities received a tip on the couple\\u2019s location. The Crumbleys were found inside an art studio in a warehouse in Detroit, according to Sheriff Michael Bouchard of Oakland County. They were not armed, he said.\", \"Lawyers for the couple maintained at the arraignment on Saturday morning that the Crumbleys were not fleeing the police and said that a miscommunication with the prosecutor\\u2019s office was the reason the couple did not turn themselves in earlier. But that characterization was disputed by Sheriff Bouchard during a news conference on Saturday afternoon.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not going to get into the specifics, but I think where they were and how they were seems to support the position they were hiding and they weren\\u2019t looking for surrendering at that point,\\u201d he said.\", \"Sheriff Bouchard added that the authorities believed that someone helped the couple gain access to the building and suggested that another person could be charged with aiding and abetting or with obstruction. He also said that it was not clear whether Ethan Crumbley was aware that his parents had been charged.\", \"During the arraignment, Karen D. McDonald, the Oakland County prosecutor, said that there was overwhelming evidence that would show that Mr. and Ms. Crumbley should have known that their son was a danger to his school.\", \"But Shannon Smith, one of the couple\\u2019s lawyers, told the judge that a fuller picture would come to light. \\u201cThere is far more going on than what this court has been made aware of,\\u201d she said.\", \"During the proceeding, the defense team revealed a few details of the couple\\u2019s lives.\", \"Ms. Crumbley, 43, grew up in Clarkston, a Detroit suburb about 20 minutes from Oxford, her lawyer said. Her lawyer added that Ms. Crumbley was recently working as a marketing director. An undated profile, recently removed, on the website of a Michigan real estate company had listed her as an employee.\", \"Ms. Crumbley was charged with driving under the influence years ago, according to her lawyer, and court records show a few other misdemeanor charges.\", \"Mr. Crumbley, 45, also had a conviction for a D.U.I., but no more serious charges, his lawyer said.\", \"In his Facebook profile, which has since been deleted, Mr. Crumbley listed a job history at a handful of small software and technology companies. Most recently, from February to July, he worked as an independent contractor for a San Francisco-based technology company called Monarch, according to the firm.\", \"\\u201cHe was terminated for reasons unrelated to this incident,\\u201d said Chase Gonzales, the company\\u2019s chief executive, who declined to offer additional details.\", \"The couple once lived in Florida but returned to Michigan several years ago, their lawyers said. They bought their home near downtown Oxford in 2015.\", \"A former girlfriend of Mr. Crumbley\\u2019s, Michelle Cobb, 39, struggled on Saturday to reconcile the current news with the man she said she once fell in love with. Ms. Cobb, who has a son, Elijah, 18, with Mr. Crumbley, spoke about their relationship in an interview outside her home in Jacksonville, Fla.\", \"While being inundated with calls, texts and Facebook messages from reporters, she said she has tried to help Elijah, who lives with her, come to terms with what has happened with that part of his family. Elijah declined to be interviewed.\", \"Ms. Cobb met Mr. Crumbley when she was 18, she said. She worked as a waitress and he lived in the apartment below hers. He worked in several different jobs in sales and marketing, she said.\", \"\\u201cI loved him to death,\\u201d she said. \\u201cHe was fun, loving, caring. We had a wonderful relationship.\\u201d It was Ms. Cobb\\u2019s first serious relationship, she said, and it lasted until she was 25.\", \"Three months after they broke up, James and Jennifer Crumbley married, according to Ms. Cobb. After that, she said, her relationship with Mr. Crumbley deteriorated and ultimately grew bitter.\", \"New details also emerged on Saturday from the school district, Oxford Community Schools, about the meeting involving the Crumbleys and school officials before the shootings. In a letter to parents and staff members, Tim Throne, the district superintendent, said that there had been two incidents that involved the shooting suspect, the Crumbleys\\u2019 son.\", \"\\u201cThe student\\u2019s parents never advised the school district that he had direct access to a firearm or that they had recently purchased a firearm for him,\\u201d Mr. Throne wrote.\", \"On Nov. 29, Mr. Throne wrote, a teacher saw Ethan Crumbley viewing images of bullets on his cellphone during class. A counselor and a staff member met with him, and he indicated that shooting sports were a family hobby, the letter said. The school tried to contact Ms. Crumbley but did not hear back right away. The next day, the parents confirmed their son\\u2019s account, the letter said.\", \"On Nov. 30, the morning of the shootings, a teacher observed drawings by the Mr. Crumbley that raised concern. The county prosecutor, Ms. McDonald, has said that the drawing featured images of a gun, a person who had been shot, a laughing emoji and the words, \\u201cBlood everywhere,\\u201d and, \\u201cThe thoughts won\\u2019t stop. Help me.\\u201d\", \"The teacher, Mr. Throne said, notified school counselors and the dean of students. The student was immediately removed from the classroom and taken to the guidance counselor\\u2019s office, where he claimed the drawing was part of a video game he was designing, Mr. Throne said.\", \"After the student\\u2019s parents arrived, school officials asked \\u201cspecific probing questions\\u201d regarding the student\\u2019s potential to harm others or himself, Mr. Throne said. His answers, which were confirmed by his parents, led counselors to conclude that he did not intend to hurt anyone, the superintendent said.\", \"\\u201cAt no time did counselors believe the student might harm others based on his behavior, responses and demeanor, which appeared calm,\\u201d wrote Mr. Throne, referring to both meetings.\", \"Counseling was recommended for him, and the parents were told they had 48 hours to seek counseling for their child or the school would contact Children\\u2019s Protective Services, Mr. Throne wrote.\", \"\\u201cWhen the parents were asked to take their son home for the day,\\u201d he wrote, \\u201cthey flatly refused and left without their son, apparently to return to work.\\u201d\", \"Because their son had no previous disciplinary infractions, \\u201cthe decision was made he would be returned to the classroom rather than sent home to an empty house.\\u201d\", \"Both incidents, the letter said, stayed at the guidance counselor level and were never elevated to the principal\\u2019s or assistant principal\\u2019s offices.\", \"The counselors made a judgment based on their training and clinical experience, Mr. Throne said, \\u201cand did not have all the facts we now know.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f2cc597655d211ecb56d11a35b577dfc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f2cc597655d211ecb56d11a35b577dfc"}},
