weather expected later this afternoon and into the night, combined with high tide around 3pm, further road closures are likely.\", \"MetService has issued a red level rain warning for Gisborne and the Wairoa District with up to 350mm of rain expected to accumulate by this afternoon.\", \"Gisborne Civil Defence manager Ben Green told Morning Report there had been 50 to 60 millimetres of rain early this morning, and it's expected to pick up.\", \"\\\"The saturation for a lot of our region is probably the more critical point for us, so rain getting to intensities not even reaching warning levels is not a helpful thing in terms of what recovery requires.\\\"\", \"A team of volunteers met early this morning to plan for the day ahead, and Green says they will report damage or incidents to Civil Defence as they happen.\", \"Tokomaru Bay-based Civil Defence coordinator Lillian Te Hau-Ward said a small number of vulnerable wh\\u0101nau had been pre-emptively evacuated from the area

to manage further weather-related traffic disruptions.\", \"\\\"What the land does and the roads I guess will be the immediate obvious concern just really how fragile the state of the rural and state highway networks are.\", \"\\\"Really this just adds to that compounding aspect of work, I mean roads have opened in the sense that they've got access but certainly not restored to what would be considered fully trafficable,\\\" Green said.\", \"With the spate of recent weather events in the region, he said he was pleased local residents had developed a very proactive sense of how to deal with these weather warnings.\", \"People are being urged to avoid travel where possible as heavy rain builds in Tair\\u0101whiti.\", \"Waka Kotahi national journey manager Helen Harris told Morning

role in the clean up from the last storm, with many of them affected by the weather personally.\", \"Wairoa mayor Craig Little says the region is hoping for the best but preparing for the worst as Cyclone Fili's effects start to be felt this morning.\", \"Little says the rain will likely cause further slips in a district that is still cleaning up from the storm that hit just three weeks ago.\",

thing for us was about putting resources into Wairoa so at the moment we've got extra police, extra fire resources, the New Zealand army has put a truck up there with some soldiers and we've also sent some staff up from other councils to help out.\\\"\", \"He said it is likely the road between Hawke's Bay and Wairoa will be closed today.\", \"Macdonald said he is worried, but they are as prepared
