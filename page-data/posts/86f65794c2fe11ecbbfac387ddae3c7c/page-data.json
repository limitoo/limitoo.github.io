Chris Stewart, Brandon DeCuir and Michael Adams said they need information about an Uber driver who reportedly drove the 21-year-old University of New Orleans student from Bamberg, South Carolina, to look for her car.\", \"\\\"They want to know what the Uber driver did as he witnessed a passenger dying, and why he never called 911 as he witnessed a medical emergency,\\\" the statement said. \\\"Uber still has not released any information to the family, so we are forced to file our lawsuit.\\\"\", \"Uber said Thursday that it cannot comment on pending litigation.\", \"The company has given police requested information about the driver, vehicle and GPS trip data, according to emailed information from the company.
