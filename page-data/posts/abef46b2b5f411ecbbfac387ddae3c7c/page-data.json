It was one of the Labour Party's 2020 election policies, which the party said was to generate income while affecting 2 percent of the highest earners in the country.\", \"Business income tax stayed the same on 28 cents, as did the 33-cent trustee income tax rate.\", \"Inland Revenue specifically warned ministers that people would try to avoid paying the higher personal rate unless it aligned the rates of other business vehicles, especially trusts, with the top personal rate.\", \"Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand local tax lead John Cuthbertson said the larger disparity opens an opportunity for high earners to reduce the tax they pay.\", \"\\\"The potential is that some people will find the temptation too great, and will look to mitigate their tax affairs to pay less tax.\\\"\", \"He noted the difference between the flat business rate of 28 percent and the top personal rate of 39 percent is now 11 percentage points.\", \"\\\"It creates basically a fertile ground where [high income earners] start thinking 'that's actually quite a big disadvantage now, is there a better way I could be doing this legitimately?' and pay less tax as part of the process,\\\" Cuthbertson said.\", \"To try calculate this, Inland Revenue honed in on high earning individuals from the last few years who would likely be captured by the new 39 percent rate $180,000 rate in the 2022 tax year.\", \"(Although the tax year at the time hadn't even finished, the IRD was able to pull together loose estimates of earnings.)\", \"It forecast returns for this group will be down $2.88 billion, or about 14 percent from the year prior.\", \"The IRD expects that the average self-employed person - who has the most control over their income - might declare 13 percent less income than they did the year before, to drop from $191,000 to $166,000. This would take them below the $180,000 threshold and not pay the higher rate.\", \"The number of PAYE earners are expected to reduce, and also declare lower incomes, from an average of $228,000 to $217,000.\", \"The IRD emphasised that these were initial estimates based on incomplete data, and the year's filings won't be complete for at least 12 months. It was also highly likely Covid-19 related disruptions impacted incomes, but this was the case for the 2021 tax year too, which is the comparison year.\", \"However the IRD does have historical suspicions to believe structuring has occurred.\", \"The following graph shows precipitous spikes in income reported by self-employed people just at the threshold that the marginal tax rate increases at $48,000 and $70,000.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/290934/eight_col_taxable_income_distribution_2018._Source_IRD.JPG?1649273444\\\" alt=\\\" The IRD found \\\"bunching\\\" of incomes of non-PAYE earners at tax thresholds.

This will likely result in disputes with taxpayers seeking to avoid the new rate and possibly court cases. Inland Revenue already undertakes significant compliance activity to minimise avoidance and will be expecting that incentives created by higher taxes create more pressures in this area.\\\"\", \"A spokesperson for the Revenue Minister David Parker said they are keeping a close watch on this.\", \"\\\"When we introduced the 39c rate we always said that we would monitor the situation and the use of trusts, and would act if necessary,\\\" the statement said.\", \"\\\"That's also why we introduced powers to collect information from trustees to further understand trust behaviour.\", \"\\\"Inland Revenue will manage its resources as it sees fit to act on information and protect the integrity of the tax system.\\\"\", \"The government is consulting this month on ways to limit avoidance of the higher tax brackets by using a company structure.\", \"John Cuthbertson, the accountant, said they shouldn't rush on any resulting decision.\", \"\\\"I think the last thing we really want or need here is some sort of knee jerk reaction. We've already had significantly increased compliance burden on all, and we want to be really careful that if they're considering expanding these integrity measures that they don't impinge on normal and routine commercial practices in New Zealand,\\\" Cuthbertson said.\", \"The IRD said it's keeping an eye on this.\", \"\\\"We are continuing to monitor trends and patterns, focussing on customers who had high incomes in the 2021 and/or 2020 tax years, as this is the population who may be motivated to change their behaviour in the 2022 tax year to minimise their exposure to the 39 percent tax rate,\\\" IRD customer segment leader Tony Morris said.\", \"\\\"There are many other reasons why a customer might have had high income in 2020 or 2021 and a valid reason for their income being lower in 2022, examples are those people who retired or were made redundant in 2020/21.\", \"\\\"Where we identify behaviour that indicates a customer has tried to avoid the top personal tax rate we will engage with those customers to understand the reasons for any change in their income and/or business structure.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"abef46b2b5f411ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"abef46b2b5f411ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
