He was 93.\", \"His death was confirmed by Fredericks & Freiser, the New York gallery that has represented his work for many years.\", \"In a prolific career of more than five decades, Mr. Wesley, who was known as Jack, had the great distinction and occasional critical misfortune of eluding almost every attempt at categorization. He tolerated the label of Pop artist, he said, mostly because it got him into shows. Through the years, critics also described him variously as a \\u201cSurrealist secret agent,\\u201d a sly eroticist, a latter-day manifestation of Rococo, a renegade Color Field artist and a \\u201cGreek vase painter by way of Aubrey Beardsley.\\u201d\", \"The sculptor Donald Judd enshrined Mr. Wesley\\u2019s paintings alongside masterpieces of Minimalism and other rigorously spare work at the Chinati Foundation in Marfa, Texas, though Mr. Judd seemed uncharacteristically at a loss to explain exactly why. Mr. Wesley was of no help in clearing up any of the confusion. He hated talking about his work and would go only so far as to concede a stray formal affinity with other artists, past or present.\", \"\\u201cMy painting, like the German Gothic style,\\u201d he once said wryly, \\u201caims at thin construction and precise, clean shaping.\\u201d\", \"He also made clear that he meant it to be funny, and his peers admired him for that.\", \"\\u201cElaborate good humor to downright damned foolishness in Western visible arts is scarce,\\u201d the artist Dan Flavin once wrote. \\u201cJack Wesley can deal with them with weird eccentric precision.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Wesley rarely gave interviews, but in one, with The New York Times in 2009, on the occasion of a retrospective organized by the Prada Foundation as part of the Venice Biennale, he said: \\u201cI didn\\u2019t go out and try to be a surrealist. It was just fun doing what I was doing.\\u201d\", \"When his dealer held up a piece of the gridded, pencil-marked tracing paper that Mr. Wesley used throughout his career to translate newspaper and magazine imagery onto canvas with hallucinatory alterations, his eyes twinkled mischievously. \\u201cIt\\u2019s magic!\\u201d he said.\", \"John Mercer Wesley was born on Nov. 25, 1928, in Los Angeles. His father, Ner, named for an Old Testament patriarch, returned home one Saturday in 1934 from his job at a hardware store and died of a stroke on the family\\u2019s bathroom floor, where his son, then 5, found him \\u201cwith his shoes still on,\\u201d as Mr. Wesley recalled.\", \"He spent a year in an orphanage before his mother, Elsa Marie Patzwaldt, who worked for the Los Angeles Telephone Company, remarried and took him back. The trauma of his father\\u2019s death had a profound impact, and the young Mr. Wesley became a bookish loner, unable to drive until after he was married.\", \"As a young adult, he attended art classes at night and took whatever blue-collar work came his way, including dishwasher, warehouse stocker and aircraft riveter. Two of his jobs supplied unlikely fodder for the painter he was to become. In 1953, he was hired by the illustration department at the Northrop Aircraft Corporation to simplify blueprints into drawings, a task that instilled a love of the simple, functional line and of matte, cyanotype blue, which he used in many early paintings.\", \"After moving to New York in 1960, he took a job as a postal clerk \\u2014 he described the United States Postal Service as \\u201ca very polite prison, full of very decent prisoners\\u201d \\u2014 and began using some of the post office\\u2019s symbols, like one found on his employee badge and in a shieldlike postal stamp, as subjects for painting.\", \"This work, he said, was intended to look like \\u201cbanners, or posters, or something,\\u201d and was influenced by Jasper Johns, whose deadpan paintings of flags, targets and numbers were described by Mr. Johns as depictions of \\u201cthings the mind already knows.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Wesley\\u2019s reductive renderings of such everyday objects also chimed with work being done in those years by Roy Lichtenstein, James Rosenquist and Andy Warhol, whose \\u201cCampbell\\u2019s Soup Cans\\u201d paintings were first shown at the Ferus Gallery in Los Angeles in 1962.\", \"But the visual fixations and style of Mr. Wesley\\u2019s work quickly turned out to be much weirder than those of his Pop compatriots. By 1963 he had brought in animals \\u2014 camels, frogs, baby birds, libidinous squirrels \\u2014 arranged in repetitive frieze-like formations that evoked ancient Egyptian tomb carving. \\u201cRepetition makes things funny,\\u201d he once said. \", \"His titles \\u2014 \\u201cDebbie Millstein Swallowed a Thumbtack,\\u201d \\u201cHungarian Dog Wrestler,\\u201d \\u201cThe Day It Rained Babies I Caught a Couple\\u201d \\u2014 sounded as if he had borrowed them from old vaudeville routines. And he made curiously anachronistic portraiture choices, like Theodore Roosevelt, Rudyard Kipling and Count Henri de Baillet-Latour, the Belgian diplomat and president of the International Olympic Committee who oversaw the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, an event whose press imagery beguiled Mr. Wesley for years.\", \"Around 1973, he began a long preoccupation with Dagwood Bumstead from Chic Young\\u2019s popular comic strip, \\u201cBlondie.\\u201d The cowlicked character became a stand-in for Mr. Wesley\\u2019s missing father.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s really my house when I was little \\u2014 those lamps, those curtains, that chair,\\u201d he said of the paintings\\u2019 scenarios, sometimes rendered with incongruous evocations of Japanese woodblock prints. He added: \\u201cMy father was like Bumstead. He was thin like Bumstead, and he wore a tie to work, and when he came home from work in the evening he tipped his hat to the neighbors. I am seeking Ner Wesley.\\u201d\", \"In his youth, Mr. Wesley somewhat resembled a comic-book character himself: tall and stooped with craggy good looks and a shock of straight brown hair. In New York, he was a member of a disparate crowd of nascent postmodern artists \\u2014 none of whom made art like his \\u2014 that included Mr. Flavin, Mr. Judd, Robert Ryman and the painter Jo Baer, Mr. Wesley\\u2019s second wife, with whom he had moved east from Los Angeles.\", \"With his first wife, Alice Richter, he had two children, a daughter, Christine Knox, and a son, Ner Wesley, who survive him. After his divorce from Ms. Baer in 1970, he married the novelist Hannah Green, and remained with her until her death in 1996. The painter and playwright Patsy Broderick, mother of the actor Matthew Broderick, was his companion for six years, until her death in 2003.\", \"Mr. Wesley\\u2019s work was shown in the international art exhibition Documenta 5 in Kassel, Germany, in 1972 and given a retrospective at the P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center (now known as MoMA PS1) in Queens in 2000. His work also entered important public collections, including those of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam. But in a sense he remained a cognoscente\\u2019s darling until the end \\u2014 an elegant, inscrutable voluptuary.\", \"\\u201cWesley\\u2019s continuing vogue as a painter is, in its every aspect, more closely akin to that of a great jazz musician or songwriter than to that of an American artist,\\u201d the critic Dave Hickey wrote in Artforum in 2000. \\u201cIn the enclave of enthusiasts, he is simply John Wesley, an acknowledged master, the Cole Porter of painting. Those who know know; those who care care; those who don\\u2019t know or care don\\u2019t have a clue, but that\\u2019s OK, too.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Green, one of the best writers about her husband\\u2019s work, said that Mr. Wesley\\u2019s rare talent lay in calmly accepting the unknowability of his sources while still being able to touch them, like a waking dreamer.\", \"\\u201cHis ideas come as the mind turns (like a globe) into darkness,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cHis mysterious and varied iconography must have a certain magic, a certain mystery for himself as well.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9702b36e8cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9702b36e8cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}},
