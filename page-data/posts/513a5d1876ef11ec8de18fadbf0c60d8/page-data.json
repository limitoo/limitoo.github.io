Especially since it is our future that is at stake \\u2014 and Kyiv\\u2019s asks might come as a surprise.\", \"Our country is not brimming with hope about a Western savior or a NATO rescue in the face of a Russian invasion. What we want from our Western partners that share our desire for us to be a true democracy free from Russia\\u2019s yoke is help in preparing for war so we might stand a chance if Moscow invades.\", \"While we Ukrainians appreciate that American leaders take pains to say, \\u201cNothing about Ukraine without Ukraine,\\u201d that\\u2019s not exactly happening. Our voice is often drowned out amid the rhetorical volleys being traded by the United States, its NATO allies and Russia.\", \"To be clear: Talks aren\\u2019t simply \\u201ctalks\\u201d when you have a gun to your head. And that\\u2019s what\\u2019s happening to us in Ukraine now.\", \"While the talks were being conducted in Geneva and Brussels, Russia began transferring military helicopters to Ukraine\\u2019s borders and engaged in new military drills in Russian regions neighboring Ukraine. This came after Moscow massed around 100, 000 troops on the border; it is also reportedly moving military equipment and personnel toward the border from other parts of Russia.\", \"Whether he invades or not, we know that President Vladimir Putin is most likely using this troop buildup to ultimately force Europe and the United States into a renegotiation of the power balance on the continent.\", \"But we are not a political football. Western leaders should remember that the real victim in this story is Ukraine. It is troubling that these talks are ostensibly to address the security concerns of Russia, the aggressor, even though ours should come first. Western leaders should avoid a situation where avenues for dialogue outnumber avenues to deter Russia \\u2014 and that\\u2019s the situation right now.\", \"Of course, diplomacy is critical, and we all know how realpolitik often runs the show. But it\\u2019s also na\\u00efve to assume that Russia will be negotiating in good faith. The United States, for instance, has accused Moscow of sending saboteurs into eastern Ukraine to stage an incident that could provide Mr. Putin with a pretext for invasion.\", \"So the talks should have been accompanied by clear actions to enhance Ukraine\\u2019s resilience, like providing additional security and military assistance \\u2014 specifically, air defense.\", \"Ukraine is not asking for the West to defend it. Rather, it is asking for help to prepare for this fight by bolstering our military capacity. Moreover, the best way to defend Ukraine is to defend Western doctrines and values, including the \\u201cno spheres of influence\\u201d principle barring large countries from dominating their neighbors and NATO\\u2019s \\u201copen door\\u201d policy of welcoming new applicants to the alliance. Close cooperation between Ukraine and the alliance \\u2014 like military exercises, which enhance the Ukrainian Army\\u2019s ability to work with NATO member states and also remind Russia that Ukraine is not alone \\u2014 should continue.\", \"While we understand the discussion about the risks of admitting Ukraine to NATO, there also should be discussion among NATO member states about the risks of not doing so. Blocking Ukraine\\u2019s accession could give Russia the perception it has a veto right in NATO or stands to benefit from instigating conflicts in other countries seeking membership in the alliance.\", \"These are our asks. And in the meantime, we are preparing for the worst.\", \"Until very recently, polls showed Ukrainians were largely afraid of rising utility bills and the deteriorating economy, and less than half said that a war was possible. That\\u2019s because after nearly eight years of Mr. Putin\\u2019s aggression, Ukrainians have gotten used to his (unfortunately) successful use of saber rattling as a tactic to get an invitation to negotiations with the West on his own terms.\", \"But now, Ukrainians are increasingly preoccupied by the prospect of a new invasion. They don\\u2019t believe the talks with Mr. Putin will be productive, which means Russia will see military action as the only way to bring Ukraine back into Moscow\\u2019s sphere of influence. These concerns echo in my work at a think tank here and in conversations with friends and family.\", \"Not surprisingly, a popular topic these days is how to join civilian \\u201cresistance\\u201d units to complement the military in case of an invasion. Billboards in many Ukrainian cities and on highways urge people to join the ranks, with a phone number to enlist. I\\u2019ve seen Facebook posts pop up about the necessity for a so-called emergency bag of essential items to grab when an invasion starts.\", \"Even Kyiv \\u2014 which has been considered almost a safe haven, distant from the war in the east and occupied Crimea \\u2014 is on edge over fears Mr. Putin could attack Ukraine.\", \"Updates on the diplomatic talks dominate the evening news and animate Facebook conversations. As one of our polls has shown, a majority of Ukrainians are convinced that Mr. Putin would continue to needle Ukraine even if it gave up its hopes of joining NATO or the European Union in the future.\", \"Western leaders at the negotiating table should remember that Ukrainians deserve to be able to plan their lives according to their dreams, not according to Mr. Putin\\u2019s imperialistic obsessions. And that Ukraine\\u2019s failure would be not just a win for Mr. Putin\\u2019s regime but also a blow to global democracy.\"]","href_hash":"513a5d1876ef11ec8de18fadbf0c60d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"513a5d1876ef11ec8de18fadbf0c60d8"}},
