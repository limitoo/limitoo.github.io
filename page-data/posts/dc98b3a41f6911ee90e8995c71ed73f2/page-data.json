Such messages will typically include a link where the customer is encouraged to provide account details.\\u00a0\", \"Never click on a link that you're not 100% confident comes from Amazon, the experts said. Keeping track of what has been ordered and when it's expected to arrive can also help customers avoid becoming a victim, the BBB said. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"Maybe set up a database with order numbers, tracking numbers [and[ how it's coming to you,\\\" Melanie McGovern, a BBB spokeswoman,\\u00a0told CBS affiliate WHIO. \\\"Just so you know if you do get a text message or you get an email saying there's a shipping delay or there's an issue, you can just refer to that spreadsheet.\\\"\", \"Phishing attempts also can be made via text message, with scammers often falsely telling customers that they've won a free gift and inviting them to fill out a form to claim the prize.\\u00a0\", \"Most phishing strategies aimed at Amazon customers prey on their misunderstanding of how the retailer communicates with individual consumers, experts said. A company representative is unlikely ever to contact a shopper directly and ask about order details, Scott Knapp, Amazon's director of worldwide buyer risk prevention, told CBS affiliate WNCN.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"There's the message center, which will tell you if we're trying to get in touch with you or if it's trying to confirm an order, you can go right to the My Orders page,\\\" Knapp said.\\u00a0\", \"Cybercriminals also sometimes create web pages that look like Amazon.com in order to lure customers into placing orders on the dummy site. Indeed, fraudsters try to mimic an Amazon page more than any other business website, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Amazon helped delete more than 20,000 fake websites last year, Knapp told WNCN.\\u00a0\", \"The simplest way to spot a dummy site is to look for spelling or grammatical errors in the URL or somewhere on the page, the BBB said. Customers are encouraged to report fraudulent websites to the FTC at reportfraud.ftc.gov or on Amazon's customer service\\u00a0website.\\u00a0\", \"Prime Day this year officially launches at 3 a.m. on Tuesday and will end 48 hours later. Analysts with Bank of America Securities estimate the two-day promotion, which Amazon launched in 2015, could generate nearly $12 in merchandise sales.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"With consumers looking for deals, more merchant participation, faster deliveries and steep discounts, we expect a relatively strong Prime Day, with potential for upside to our 12% growth estimate vs. Prime Day last July,\\\" they said in a report on Monday.\", \"Khristopher J. Brooks is a reporter for CBS MoneyWatch covering business, consumer and financial stories that range from economic inequality and housing issues to bankruptcies and the business of sports.\"]","href_hash":"dc98b3a41f6911ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dc98b3a41f6911ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
