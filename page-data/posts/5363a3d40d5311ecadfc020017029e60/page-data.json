Three of them are in a critical condition.\", \"The attacker, a known supporter of Islamic State, was shot dead by police.\", \"He has now been identified as Ahamed Aathil Mohamed Samsudeen, a 32-year-old Tamil, who arrived in New Zealand in 2011 and sought refugee status.\", \"Ms Ardern, who described the stabbings as a \\\"terrorist attack\\\", said she expected that changes to the country's counter-terrorism legislation would be backed by parliament by the end of September.\", \"The legislation is expected to make it easier to convict someone for planning a terror attack.\", \"Samsudeen had been arrested a number of times before Friday's incident. But Ms Ardern said that every legal avenue to keep him out of the community had been exhausted.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What do we know about Samsudeen?</div>\", \"Samsudeen, whose identity was suppressed by court order until now due to his refugee status, arrived in New Zealand on a student visa in 2011. He became a person of national security interest in 2016.\", \"As a member of the Tamil minority community, he claimed he and his father had been persecuted in Sri Lanka.\", \"He had been under round-the-clock monitoring and heavy surveillance due to concerns about his ideology. Samsudeen was known to multiple agencies, and was also on a terror watchlist.\", \"Local media reports said he had recently been sentenced to one year of supervision for possessing IS propaganda.\", \"Prosecutors had accused him of plotting a \\\"lone wolf\\\" terror attack using knives, but the judge ruled that planning a terror attack was not in itself an offence under existing laws. \", \"His internet search history and bookmarks included heroes of Islamic State, Islamic State dress, and New Zealand prison clothes and food, according to Stuff.\", \"Questions have been raised about why action against the attacker was not taken before the stabbings - especially since he was under close surveillance.\", \"The attacker's family were \\\"shocked and grieving\\\", lawyer Davoud Mansouri-Rad, who represented the man in relation to his immigration matters, told Stuff. \", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How did the attack unfold?</div>\", \"It happened at the Countdown supermarket at LynnMall in the Auckland district of New Lynn on Friday afternoon.\", \"A surveillance team and a specialist tactics group had followed Samsudeen from his home to the supermarket. But while there were concerns about him, officials said they had no reason to think he was planning an attack on Friday. The team believed he was going to do his grocery shopping.\", \"After entering the store, however, the Samsudeen got hold of a knife and went on a stabbing spree.\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/10F16/production/_120389396_mediaitem120389393.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">An armed police officer at the site of a knife attack in Auckland, New Zealand.

This happened within 60 seconds of the attack. \", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/1024/cpsprodpb/15F15/production/_120377898_auckland_countdown_attack2x640-nc.png' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">image shows map of the attack location</div>\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/2048/cpsprodpb/1739F/production/_113753159_yqa_get_in_touch_top_no_yqa_text_640-nc.png' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Banner saying 'Get in touch'</div>\", \"Were you in the area?
