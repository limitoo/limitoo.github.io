optimism as the economic and fiscal outlook is good.\\\"\", \"He said supply chain disruptions, higher inflation and Covid-19 might affect the forecasts.\", \"The Treasury commentary highlighted uncertainty around the forecasts including its assumptions on when the border would open more fully, levels of immigration, and house prices.\", \"Economic growth was forecast to rebound strongly in 2022/23 before moderating in later years, while inflation was forecast to peak next year above 5 percent before falling back in subsequent years into the Reserve Bank's 1-3 percent target band.\", \"Unemployment was expected to keep falling over the next couple of years and to stay below 4 percent for the next five years.\", \"The lower jobless rate was expected to reduce social welfare benefit costs as well as boost the tax take, which would also benefit from higher GST and corporate tax revenues.\", \"\\\"Our cautious approach continues to pay dividends,\\\" Robertson said.\", \"<img
