We\\u2019ll look at the sex-trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, which begins today. We\\u2019ll also update the story on the \\u201cFearless Girl\\u201d statue. The statue\\u2019s permit from the city expires today.\", \"Even in death, the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein could easily overshadow the sex-trafficking trial of his longtime companion, Ghislaine Maxwell.\", \"The jurors are expected to be selected this morning. Then the prosecutors will begin outlining their case against Maxwell.\", \"As my colleagues Benjamin Weiser and Rebecca Davis O\\u2019Brien write, the trial is widely seen as a proxy for holding Epstein himself to account \\u2014 something that never happened. He hanged himself in his jail cell in August 2019, according to the medical examiner, a month after his arrest on sex-trafficking charges.\", \"Maxwell, the daughter of a British media baron, was a cosmopolitan globe-trotter who turned up regularly on the Manhattan social scene in the early 2000s. The prosecutors say she \\u201cassisted, facilitated and contributed to\\u201d the sexual exploitation of underage girls by Epstein, who socialized with celebrities, presidents and princes. His orbit included Bill Clinton and Donald Trump; billionaires like Bill Gates and the retail magnate Leslie Wexner; and Prince Andrew.\", \"For Maxwell\\u2019s lawyers, the goal will probably be to distance her from Epstein \\u2014 even perhaps portraying her as his victim, some legal experts said. But here, too, the prosecutors will need to avoid \\u201cmaking the trial too much about Epstein and his conduct, and not enough about Maxwell,\\u201d said Arlo Devlin-Brown, a former federal corruption prosecutor in Manhattan.\", \"Maxwell has denied wrongdoing. But as the two sides prepared for the trial, the fallout has continued for others with connections to Epstein.\", \"Those connections cost the chief executive of one of Britain\\u2019s biggest banks his job on Nov. 1. The reason: an inquiry by British regulators into how the official, James Staley, had described his relationship with Epstein.\", \"As my colleagues Michael de la Merced and Matthew Goldstein explained, Epstein had played an important role earlier in Staley\\u2019s career. They had apparently known each other as far back as the late 1990s, when Staley was the head of private banking at JPMorgan Chase and Epstein referred clients who helped strengthen Staley\\u2019s portfolio. Emails that JPMorgan provided to the British regulators indicated that Epstein and Staley were friendlier than Staley had acknowledged. He said he had cut ties with Epstein by the time he took over at Barclays in 2015, though he had visited Epstein\\u2019s Caribbean island earlier that year.\", \"Barclays noted in announcing Staley\\u2019s departure that there had been no findings that he \\u201csaw, or was aware of, any of Mr. Epstein\\u2019s alleged crimes.\\u201d\", \"The announcement by Barclays that Staley was leaving came a day after Prince Andrew issued an attack in court papers on a woman who sued him in federal court in Manhattan in August, accusing him of sexual abuse when she was 17 and he was a guest of Epstein.\", \"Andrew, the Duke of York, had said he had \\u201cno recollection\\u201d of meeting her. Andrew said in 2019 that he was withdrawing from public life after Britain was appalled by a television interview that subjected him to polite but relentless grilling about his relationship with Epstein.\", \"As for the Maxwell trial, her lawyers have not discussed their strategy publicly. But shortly after her arrest, when she was unsuccessfully seeking bail, they wrote to Judge Alison Nathan, who is presiding over the case: \\u201cSometimes, the simplest point is the most critical one: Ghislaine Maxwell is not Jeffrey Epstein.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s a mostly sunny day, New York, with wind gusts and temps in the high 30s. In the evening, temps will drop to the low 30s.\", \"In effect until Dec. 8 (Immaculate Conception).\", \"After today, the statue famous for defiantly staring down the New York Stock Exchange will be illegal \\u2014 technically, anyway.\", \"The city\\u2019s temporary permit for the statue known as \\u201cFearless Girl\\u201d is expiring. Permanent status appears to depend on a bureaucratic two-step that the artist says has left the statue in limbo.\", \"\\u201cThe idea of \\u2018Fearless Girl\\u2019 not being given permanence in the city is disserving because New York City is well-positioned with \\u2018Fearless Girl\\u2019 there to be a leader in diversity,\\u201d the artist, Kristen Visbal, told me. \\u201cIf you remove her, what does that say about New York City and equality?\\u201d\", \"As with driving on an expired license, the lack of a valid permit for \\u201cFearless Girl\\u201d would matter only if a violation were written up. The Landmarks Preservation Commission, the city agency that could issue the equivalent of a ticket for \\u201cFearless Girl,\\u201d says it will not do so while a permit renewal is going on.\", \"The statue was an immediate sensation when the financial firm State Street Global Advisers installed it in Bowling Green, a small park in Lower Manhattan, saying it wanted to promote \\u201cgreater gender diversity on corporate boards.\\u201d That was shortly before International Women\\u2019s Day in March 2017. Several months later, the Labor Department accused State Street of underpaying more than 300 female employees. The firm, which had denied the allegations, agreed to cover about $4.5 million in back pay.\", \"The landmarks commission was involved because the statue occupied a site within a landmark \\u2014 specifically, the \\u201cStreet Plan of New Amsterdam and Colonial New York,\\u201d which covers a chunk of the financial district in Lower Manhattan. \\u201cFearless Girl,\\u201d initially installed on a one-week permit, remained within the landmark area when it was moved opposite the Stock Exchange on Wall Street in 2018.\", \"Zodet Negr\\u00f3n, a spokeswoman for the landmarks commission, said that State Street had applied for a longer-term permit after receiving three temporary permits, the most the landmarks commission will issue.\", \"But the landmarks commission is not the only branch of city government that will have a say. The Public Design Commission will review the matter, as Negr\\u00f3n said it does with proposals for art installations that are to remain in place longer than a year. The landmarks commission will send the design commission an advisory report, but it is not clear how soon that will happen.\", \"Visbal, the artist, has tangled with State Street over copyright and licensing agreements. State Street sued her in 2019, claiming she had broken those agreements and had caused \\u201csubstantial and irreparable harm\\u201d to \\u201cFearless Girl\\u201d by selling copies of the statue. She filed a counterclaim that State Street had unfairly prevented her from spreading the statue\\u2019s message of gender equality.\", \"Todd Fine, a preservation activist in Lower Manhattan and a supporter of Visbal, said the artist had produced the statue \\u201cthinking it was about women.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cShe didn\\u2019t conceive of this as something about finance,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThis was conceived as being about women\\u2019s equality.\\u201d\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"It was 1985 and the first day of my internship at the Metropolitan Museum. I entered at the employee entrance as instructed and was then guided to an elevator.\", \"When the elevator stopped at the first floor, a museum worker pushed a wheelchair and in it was Louise Nevelson. I knew it was her by her mink eyelashes.\", \"I could not believe my eyes. Like Ms. Nevelson, I am a sculptor, and she was someone I had read books about, studied and admired.\", \"\\u201cI have always admired your artwork,\\u201d I said.\", \"\\u201cThank you,\\u201d she replied, and then slowly and carefully lifted her hand for me to shake.\", \"\\u2014 Pamela C.
