It was an act that punctuated his pleas for sympathy toward refugees just as European attitudes were hardening against them.\", \"Five years later, the three families who traveled with Francis \\u2014 two from Damascus and one from Deir al-Zour \\u2014 have made lives for themselves in Rome, though they say that their thoughts are constantly with those they left behind in Syria.\", \"\\u201cWhen we got on that plane with him, we felt a sense of peace that we hadn\\u2019t felt for a very long time,\\u201d said Wafaa Eid, 35, recalling a \\u201cdreamlike\\u201d trip that swept them from years of war in Syria and a fraught five-month journey to reach Europe, to a rousing welcome offered by a Catholic charity in Rome.\", \"\\u201cThere were flowers and music \\u2014 it felt like a wedding,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt was great.\\u201d\", \"Adapting to a new life, a new culture, has not always been easy, she said, but her family has found support and generosity in Rome.
