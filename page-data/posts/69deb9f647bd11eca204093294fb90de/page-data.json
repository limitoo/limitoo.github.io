But the only opinions that ultimately count belong to the 12 Kenosha County residents who entered the deliberation room to discuss the evidence from the closely watched trial. \", \"The 12 were told to consider only the information presented in court \\u2014 and to disregard the constant news coverage and political commentary about Mr. Rittenhouse\\u2019s actions and affiliations, some of which the judge blocked from being discussed in the courtroom. \", \"\\u201cYou are not to rely upon any private sources of information,\\u201d the Wisconsin Jury Handbook says, \\u201calthough it is assumed that you will use your own experiences, knowledge and common sense in reaching your conclusions.\\u201d\", \"The discussions in the jury room are off limits to everyone except the jurors themselves.

They are instructed to listen to opposing arguments in the deliberation room and to be willing to change their minds if they find those arguments convincing.\", \"If the jurors cannot reach agreement either to convict or acquit on a particular count, the jury is said to be hung, and the judge can declare a mistrial. If that happens, prosecutors must decide whether to drop the charge or pursue another trial.\"]","href_hash":"69deb9f647bd11eca204093294fb90de"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"69deb9f647bd11eca204093294fb90de"}},
