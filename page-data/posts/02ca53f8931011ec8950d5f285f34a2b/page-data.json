A male DNA profile was identified but never matched to a specific suspect and the case went cold again.\", \"After police opened the case again in 2018, they worked with a team from the district attorney's office and the FBI. Prosecutors said Morgan was identified as a suspect through technology that uses genealogical websites to identify potential relatives of a suspect based on DNA collected at a crime scene. DNA testing confirmed this week that he matched the profile taken from the autopsy in 1984.\", \"\\\"Working together, we continue to solve the most difficult cold cases that Dallas has ever seen,\\\" said Dallas County Assistant District Attorney Leighton D'Antoni. \\\"I look forward to working with all our local law enforcement agencies to utilize the advancements in forensic testing techniques to identify, arrest, and prosecute the most dangerous predators hiding among us.
