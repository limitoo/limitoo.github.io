The findings were published in The Astrophysical Journal.\", \"Mar\\u00eda Jos\\u00e9 Bustamante, doctoral graduate from the University of Texas, Austin, and co-author of the study on the findings, said in a statement: \\\"there is no explanation for this kind of black hole in dwarf spheroidal galaxies.\\\"\", \"The research could not only shake up astrophysical models of how galaxies evolve, but could also help scientists better understand how the mysterious substance dark matter\\u2014which accounts for the majority of a galaxy's mass content\\u2014is distributed throughout galactic structures.\", \"Researchers chose to study Leo I because it is a dwarf galaxy that seems to have very little dark matter, unlike other galaxies orbiting the Milky Way.\", \"The team of astronomers reached their discovery by studying the dark matter profile of Leo I, which is how the density of dark matter changes from the dwarf galaxy's outer edge through to its center. This is achieved by measuring the gravitational influence of Leo I's dark matter content on its stars.\", \"Dark matter differs from the everyday matter we see all around us because it interacts weakly with other matter and also with light. The only interaction dark matter displays that is measurable is with gravity. That means it can be inferred by its effect on stars and other cosmic bodies.\", \"The faster the stars are moving, the more matter there is enclosed in their orbits. This allowed the team to measure if Leo I's dark matter density increases toward the dwarf galaxy's center.\", \"This central region has been somewhat overlooked in previous studies of Leo I, which focused more on the velocities of individual stars. What the team found was in the measurements previously taken there was a bias towards low-velocity stars. This had the effect of reducing the amount of matter that seemed to be enclosed within the star's orbits.\", \"By removing this bias, the astronomers found that the amount of mass contained at the center of Leo I ballooned tremendously.\", \"This suggested the presence of a compact and truly massive object about 3.3 million times as heavy as the sun. For comparison, Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the heart of the Milky Way, is 4.4 million times as massive as our star.\", \"The team believes that the presence of this massive black hole in such a small galaxy represents a new way for black holes to merge. The astronomers suggest that over time, as small galaxies like Leo I fall into larger galaxies, the smaller galaxy's black hole merges with that of the larger galaxy, increasing its mass.\", \"\\\"If the mass of Leo I's black hole is high, that may explain how black holes grow in massive galaxies,\\\" Gebhardt said.\", \"This could give gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo an entirely new source of gravitational wave sources to investigate. And because astronomers use these dwarf galaxies to study dark matter, the findings made by the team could shake up the search for answers regarding one of physics' most pressing mysteries.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943949/milky-way-leo-i.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">(Main) An image of the Milky Way (inset) the small dwarf galaxy Leo I.
