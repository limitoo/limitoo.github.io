Within months of his solicitations, Mr. de Blasio was formally warned by the city\\u2019s Conflict of Interest Board \\u2014 in a previously undisclosed letter \\u2014 not to repeat the behavior.\", \"But even after that warning, the mayor continued to hit up well-connected donors for money, according to documents that the city recently released after years of an extraordinary legal campaign by the de Blasio administration to keep the documents secret.\", \"In February 2015, the mayor made a call to Jeffrey Levine, chairman of Douglaston Development, which had just won city approval for $12 million in financing for an affordable housing complex, and was given a parcel of city-owned land in the Bronx.\", \"The next month, Mr. de Blasio called David Von Spreckelsen, president of Toll Brothers, an affordable housing developer. A stop-work order had recently been lifted on the developer\\u2019s hotel and condominium project in Brooklyn Bridge Park.\", \"Both men later received follow-up calls from the nonprofit\\u2019s fund-raiser, Ross Offinger, and each donated $25,000.\", \"In April of that year, Mr. de Blasio spoke with James Capalino, a major city lobbyist with many clients doing city business, to ask for his support. The campaign\\u2019s fund-raiser made another follow-up call, and Mr. Capalino donated $10,000.\", \"As the mayor nears the end of his eight-year tenure, and navigates a likely bid for governor next year, his pattern of questionable fund-raising tactics and ethics violations may cast a shadow on his legacy and his political future.\", \"New details of Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s outreach to the donors were contained in a secret letter from the city\\u2019s Conflicts of Interest Board to the mayor. The letter, which includes a forceful reprimand of the mayor, was sent to Mr. de Blasio in 2018, but was only released this week.\", \"\\u201cBy soliciting these three donations from firms with business pending or about to be pending before executive agencies,\\u201d the letter said, \\u201cyou not only disregarded the board\\u2019s repeated written advice, but created the very appearance of coercion and improper access to you and your staff that the board\\u2019s advice sought to help you avoid.\\u201d\", \"It continued: \\u201cA public servant who engages in solicitations such as these, either directly or through a surrogate, acts in conflict with that public servant\\u2019s official duties, in violation\\u201d of the City Charter\\u2019s ethics code.\", \"The city provided the letter to The New York Times this week, after the State Court of Appeals denied a final effort by the mayor\\u2019s office to keep the document secret. The city had, for more than two years, fought The Times\\u2019 efforts to obtain the document, denying an initial Freedom of Information request and then fighting a lawsuit filed by The Times.\", \"Mr. de Blasio, a Democrat elected in 2013, has been the subject of several investigations into his methods to raise money for the Campaign for One New York, and for a separate effort in 2014 to wrest control of the State Senate from the Republicans. Donors to the mayor\\u2019s political endeavors have included major unions and real estate developers, and many of them have business before the city.\", \"The Campaign for One New York, now shuttered, was created by Mr. de Blasio and his supporters to push for universal prekindergarten; it was later used to support his political agenda.\", \"\"]","href_hash":"c9919ca6587011ecbfc5e12c853f91e6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c9919ca6587011ecbfc5e12c853f91e6"}},
