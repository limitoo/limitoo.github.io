He shot well on the range, hitting 18/20 targets.\", \"\\\"That was the second best score I've shot in an individual - today was a good day!\\\" explained Wright after his race.\", \"\\\"I feel really good, I'm really happy with that performance and can't wait for more Olympic racing.\\\"\", \"Wright is competing a further two times during the Winter Olympic Games, in the Men's 10km Sprint on the 12th of February and the Men's 12.5km Pursuit on the 13th of February.\", \"Meanwhile ice speed skater Peter Michael was also in action at the National Speed Skating Oval.\", \"Michael was first up of the 31 athletes in the 1,500m race, with the draw forcing him to skate alone, whereas the others skated in pairs.\", \"Despite not being able to draft into a slipstream, Michael still managed to post a respectable time of 1:48.68s to finish 26th.\", \"\\\"I went out there and gave it everything I had,\\\" said Michael. \\\"Unfortunately that wasn't enough tonight but I'm going to reset and prepare for my next race.\\\"\", \"Michael will contest the 10,000m on Friday.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/284649/eight_col_speed.jpg?1642544641\\\" alt=\\\"Peter Michael of New Zealand in action during the Olympic men's 5000m speed skating 2018.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPeter Michael \\nPhoto: PHOTOSPORT\\n</div>\", \"Other Olympic news:\", \"World record holder Kjeld Nuis edged out his rivals to win the men's 1,500 metres, retaining his title to continue the Dutch gold rush in speed skating at the Games. The Dutch speed skating team have now won six medals at the Games, including three gold.\", \"Austria's Matthias Mayer became the first man to win an Alpine skiing gold medal at three consecutive Olympic Games after winning the super-G. Mayer, who won gold in downhill in Sochi in 2014 and super-G in Pyeongchang four years ago, finished ahead of American Ryan Cochran-Siegle and Norway's Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, the World Cup super-G leader. Mayer won bronze in the downhill.\", \"Nathan Chen claimed redemption at the Beijing Games after his world record short programme in the men's figure skating helped erase the disappointment of his Pyeongchang flop four years ago. The world champion's stunning 113.97-point skate at Capital Indoor Stadium wiped the previous record of 111.82 set by Japanese rival and Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu at the 2020 Four Continents tournament.

China does not allow dual nationality, and state media have previously reported that the 18-year-old renounced her U.S. citizenship after she became a Chinese national at the age of 15.\", \"China will invite more spectators to attend the games as the COVID-19 situation is under control within the \\\"closed-loop\\\" bubble, which separates all event personnel from the public, an official from the Beijing organisers said.
