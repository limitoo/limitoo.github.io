And remember that in politics, a month can seem like a lifetime.\", \"Brian HousealBrunswick, Maine\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Bret Stephens writes, \\u201cThings might be different if the Biden presidency were off to a great start,\\u201d and notes that Mr. Biden\\u2019s \\u201cpoll numbers have been deeply underwater since August.\\u201d\", \"That statement says all that needs be said on how success is measured in today\\u2019s United States \\u2014 not by a president\\u2019s groundbreaking accomplishments in less than a year but rather by political polls.\", \"I don\\u2019t see polls as the measure of the president\\u2019s success but rather as the success of the obstructionist, anti-democratic Republicans in establishing the narrative portrayed in the national media. I would prefer that success be measured by a comparison with the four years preceding President Biden\\u2019s term.\", \"Stephen F. GladstoneShaker Heights, Ohio\", \"To the Editor:\", \"I rarely agree with Bret Stephens other than with his principled opposition to another Trump presidency. But I agree fully with his argument that President Biden should not run again.\", \"Mr. Biden\\u2019s agenda has been impressive, but his growing incoherence badly handicaps its implementation. A second presidential term, probably unachievable in any case, would undermine any legacy he might still earn.\", \"Key Democratic Party leaders need to push hard on Mr. Biden\\u2019s patriotism and encourage him to do as Mr. Stephens suggests. Perhaps the key Democratic leader in such an endeavor would be a man who helped save Mr. Biden\\u2019s presidential nomination in the first place, Jim Clyburn.\", \"Ramsay ThomasLafayette, Calif.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"As someone born on Nov. 20, 1942, the same day as Joe Biden, I feel qualified to rebut Bret Stephens\\u2019s column. I have slipped, and arguably Mr. Biden has slipped, as the years have piled up, but I haven\\u2019t slipped so far that I can\\u2019t see how well he is performing \\u2014 whatever the polls say.\", \"I am lucky enough to remember President Dwight D. Eisenhower, who was also derided for his slips as he aged. But few thought his occasional misspeaking was disqualifying.\", \"Perhaps those who would urge Mr. Biden to call it a day after one term are afraid he\\u2019ll continue to fight effectively for policies they dislike.\", \"Bart MillsManhattan Beach, Calif.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"In the past year child poverty has been cut substantially. We\\u2019ve added hundreds of thousands of jobs per month, and we finally have an infrastructure bill.\", \"Of course, this administration\\u2019s first year hasn\\u2019t been problem-free. We are out of Afghanistan, but the exit was painful and messy. Inflation is skyrocketing. Crime is getting worse, and the pandemic just won\\u2019t go away.\", \"But we still have a democracy. If the Republicans were in office, that would not be a sure thing.\", \"Bret Stephens suggests that President Biden announce that he won\\u2019t be running again and that the Democrats go into a free-for-all to find a candidate. It\\u2019s a terrible idea. The Republicans are now firmly run by their anti-democracy wing. The stakes are too high and our nation is too fragile. We need stability at the top. Joe Biden is still the best person to provide that.\", \"Elliott MillerBala Cynwyd, Pa.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cOn Abortion, Public Is Not as Polarized as Parties,\\u201d by Nate Cohn (news analysis, Dec. 12):\", \"In discussing the mismatch between voters\\u2019 views on abortion and the position of their party, you say that many people are \\u201cmuddled or conflicted\\u201d on the issue. Though I would not use the word \\u201cmuddled,\\u201d I am one of them.\", \"My political position is definitely pro-choice. Though I believe that abortion would be morally wrong for me in most circumstances, I do not think that my religious beliefs should be forced on others. That said, there is much we can do to reduce the number of abortions in this country, including improving funding for child care, support for families and the availability of reliable contraception.\", \"Unfortunately, those most passionate about outlawing abortion in all circumstances also refuse to support the very measures that would allow more women to choose to carry a pregnancy to term. Apparently, they would rather send women back to the back alley.\", \"Anne-Marie HislopChicagoThe writer is a Presbyterian minister.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Discovering \\u201cAt a Packed Fair, Reveling in Literary Traditions,\\u201d by Jane Arraf (Baghdad Dispatch, Dec. 19), about the Baghdad International Book Fair, was an unexpected delight \\u2014 a gem of hope amid all the stories about war, pandemic, political strife and famine.\", \"I have never been to Iraq, but I felt as if I was there at the fair. It is inspiring to know the place that books and reading occupy in Iraqi society. I will think of Baghdad readers the next time I visit a bookstore. Thank you, Ms. Arraf, for making that international connection with book lovers everywhere.\", \"Valerie WilkThe Villages, Fla.\"]","href_hash":"dd010572666911ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dd010572666911ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
