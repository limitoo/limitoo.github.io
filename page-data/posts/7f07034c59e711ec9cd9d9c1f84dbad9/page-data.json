He was 78.\", \"Jason Elzy, the head of public relations for Rhino Records, the label that represents the Monkees, confirmed the death but did not specify a cause. \", \"\", \"Mr. Nesmith was a struggling 23-year-old singer and songwriter when he saw an advertisement in Variety seeking \\u201c4 insane boys\\u201d for \\u201cacting roles in new TV series.\\u201d Two aspiring television producers, Bob Rafelson and Bert Schneider, inspired by the Beatles\\u2019 movies, were hoping to make a TV series about the zany antics of a rock band \\u2014 not a real rock band (although the Lovin\\u2019 Spoonful was briefly considered for the job), but actors with musical backgrounds who could create the illusion of a band.\", \"The four members were picked to fit types. Davy Jones, a British vocalist, was the cute scamp; Micky Dolenz, the drummer, was the wild jokester; and Peter Tork, the bass player, was the lovable dim bulb. Mr. Nesmith, a guitarist, was variously described as the cerebral Monkee, the introspective Monkee, the sardonic Monkee, the quiet Monkee.\", \"\\u201cHe has that dry Will Rogers sense of humor,\\u201d Mr. Dolenz told Rolling Stone in 2012, characterizing Mr. Nesmith\\u2019s real persona. \\u201cThat\\u2019s probably one of the reasons they cast him.\\u201d\", \"The show made its debut in September 1966, and though it lasted only two seasons, the Monkees became a cultural reference point, thanks largely to their best-selling albums (which featured a lot of studio musicians and backup singers, especially early on). Mr. Nesmith, who wrote and produced some Monkees songs, had the reputation of being the only \\u201creal\\u201d musician in the group, but in his 2017 memoir, \\u201cInfinite Tuesday,\\u201d he disputed that.\", \"\\u201cIt would always seem wildly ironic to me that I was the one given credit in the press for being the \\u2018only musician\\u2019 in the Monkees,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cNothing was further from the truth.\\u201d\", \"A complete obituary will appear shortly.\", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \", \" \"]","href_hash":"7f07034c59e711ec9cd9d9c1f84dbad9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7f07034c59e711ec9cd9d9c1f84dbad9"}},
