The others include two in their 50s, two in their 60s, four in their 70s, one in their 80s, and one over 90.

Conversely in the Southern region cases only started to decline in the final week of March, and during the last risk assessment were still rising in Southern, and just reaching a peak in Midland.\", \"Hospitalisations in the northern region - Auckland plus Northland - are declining but quite slowly still, he said. Hospitalised cases peaked on 29 March at 842, down now to 639.

There are reports of people who have the virus recording negative RAT results, and Rod Jackson said home testing could miss up to half of positive Covid-19 cases.\", \"A leaked memo from from the Northern Region Health Co-ordination Centre has raised questions over the daily reported case numbers, due to low reporting of RAT results. The memo from March states: \\\"The MoH shared the following with us this week: in the last month we have distributed 50 million RATs into the system and so far less than 1 million results have been reported.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"ba3c2078b62111ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ba3c2078b62111ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
