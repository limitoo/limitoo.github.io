Donald Trump was playing golf.\", \"President-elect Biden addressed his supporters in Wilmington, Delaware. \\\"Folks, the people of this nation have spoken. They've delivered us a clear victory, a convincing victory,\\\" he said. \\\"Let this grim era of demonization in America begin to end here and now.\\\"\", \"Claiming \\\"this was a stolen election,\\\" Trump again took to Twitter to rant.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1670729/rudy-giuliani.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Trumpworld's \\\"adults\\\" disappeared. Presidential lawyer Rudy Giuliani gave a widely-mocked press conference in the back parking lot of Four Seasons Total Landscaping on November 7, 2020, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. </div>\", \"Son-in-law Jared Kushner, one of the few \\\"adults\\\" in the White House who had the president's ear, tried to talk him into conceding the election, CNN reported. But as Trump descended into fury and self-delusion, another pattern emerged. People inside the White House started to disappear, either because they were shunned by the president or they wanted to divorce themselves from Trump's increasingly incoherent challenge.\", \"Even Kushner vanished, off to the Middle East to continue work on the Abraham Accords, normalizing relations between Israel and select Arab states, of which Saudi Arabia and the rich Gulf States were the ultimate prize. And Kushner's wife, presidential daughter Ivanka Trump, disappeared as well, spending time in Florida to make arrangements for post-White House life, finding a house and a school for the kids.\", \"Trumpworld was in chaos, increasingly split between the regulars and the external yes men and women whom Trump increasingly relied on. Rudy Giuliani and several other hangers-on held a news conference in Philadelphia, in the outskirts of the city in an industrial part of town in the parking lot in front of a business called Four Seasons Total Landscaping.\", \"The former mayor of New York, once a 9/11 hero, rambled at length, saying the president not going to concede, throwing out one conspiracy claim after another, including a claim that Pennsylvania ballots had been tampered with.\", \"Donald Trump, who'd tweeted that his lawyers would appear at the Four Seasons in Philadelphia, wasn't happy with Giuliani's performance. He was particularly upset with the low-rent venue.\", \"It was the news media's reaction to the Giuliani show, once Trump got back to watching television from his normal weekend at the golf course, that galvanized him. Cable TV and the Internet were on fire with every form of mockery of Rudy and the Trump camp. Biden won, and as more votes came in, that lead would surely grow.\", \"The MAGA spectacle, now transformed into a raucous tantrum, amused the mainstream media and Biden supporters. They believed that those in the streets didn't represent a constituency: they were idiots being instigated by a brilliant Donald Trump and riled up by an alternative media world that existed on a channel that Biden backers didn't watch. And most important, the view took hold that the protestors were white supremacists and armed militia, fascists and extremists. The names\\u2014Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, QAnon, Boogaloo Bois\\u2014 started to become household talking points while the tens of millions of other Trump voters were invisible.\", \"Stop the Steal protests took place across the United States at state capitols and ballot-counting locations in Arizona, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Georgia. At the Pennsylvania state capitol, extremists including armed militias, white supremacists, QAnon believers, and Proud Boys participated in a heavily armed protest.\", \"Extremists, including white nationalist movement leaders and Proud Boys, also begin promoting and planning a \\\"Million MAGA March\\\" in Washington D.C. for Nov. 14.\", \"D.C. Mayor Muriel E. Bowser traveled Saturday to Delaware, a state with significantly higher coronavirus risk than the District, to celebrate President-elect Joe Biden's victory, drawing immediate criticism from conservative media.
