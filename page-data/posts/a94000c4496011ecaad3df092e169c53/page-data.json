Prosecutors argued throughout the trial that Rittenhouse incited the deadly encounters, while his defense team said the killings were in self-defense.\", \"Schroeder read aloud some 36 pages of explanation on the charges Rittenhouse is facing and the laws regarding self-defense before deliberations commenced. After the jury ended its third day of deliberations on Thursday, one juror asked Schroeder if she could bring the jury instructions home with her, and he obliged, AP reported.\", \"In addition to Grieve, Schroeder's decision troubled some people directly involved in the case. Rittenhouse attorney Mark Richards told Schroeder after the jury left that he was concerned permitting jurors to take the legal instructions with them would spur them to do online research or look things up in a dictionary, which is not allowed.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936456/kyle-rittenhouse-trial-judge.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Judge Bruce Schroeder talks about why he let the jury take home the jury instructions at the end of the day in Kyle Rittenhouse's trial at the Kenosha County Courthouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on November 18, 2021.</div>\", \"The jury returned for a fourth day of deliberations on Friday.\", \"Even as the jury weighed the evidence, two mistrial requests from the defense hung over the case, with the potential to upend the verdict if the panel were to convict Rittenhouse. One of the requests asks the judge to go even further and bar prosecutors from retrying him.\", \"Rittenhouse's lawyers have complained that they were given an inferior copy of a potentially crucial video and that the prosecution asked improper questions of the defendant during cross-examination.\", \"Rittenhouse was a 17-year-old former police youth cadet when he went to Kenosha in what he said was an effort to protect property after rioters set fires and ransacked businesses on previous nights.\", \"He shot and killed Joseph Rosenbaum, 36, and Anthony Huber, 26, and wounded Gaige Grosskreutz, now 28. Rittenhouse is white, as were those he shot.\", \"The case has exposed deep divides among Americans over guns, racial injustice, vigilantism and self-defense in the U.S.\", \"Rittenhouse could get life in prison if convicted of the most serious charge against him.\", \"Also Thursday, Schroeder banned MSNBC from the courthouse after police said they briefly detained a man who had followed the jury bus and may have tried to photograph jurors.\", \"NBC News said in a statement that the man was a freelancer who received a citation for a traffic violation that took place near the jury vehicle, and he \\\"never photographed or intended to photograph them.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936471/kyle-rittenhouse-jury-deliberating.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Kyle Rittenhouse (center) looks to his attorneys as the jury is dismissed for the day during his trial at the Kenosha County Courthouse in Kenosha, Wisconsin, on November 18, 2021.</div>\"]","href_hash":"a94000c4496011ecaad3df092e169c53"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a94000c4496011ecaad3df092e169c53"}},
