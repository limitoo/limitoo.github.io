One payout is to be split between the families of the 17 killed, people who suffered from injuries, and others who suffer from ongoing trauma. The other is an individual payout to Andy Borges who was severely injured in the incident.\", \"Borges' received a settlement of a $1.25 million lump-sum payout for his injuries in the shooting.\", \"His lawyer decided to break off from the larger settlement because of the severity of Borge's injuries which were some of the most severe out of those who were hurt. He will require a lifetime of expensive medical care because of it, the South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported.\", \"A total of 51 people, including families of the 17 who died in the shooting, as well as staff members and students who were injured during the ordeal were awarded a total of $25 million in the second settlement. They will receive the payout in a three-part installment plan.\", \"Families of the deceased will receive about $1 million each.
