This decades-spanning fable of power and corruption turns out to be something much less clear-cut than the familiar David-and-Goliath tale of a sociopathic corporation and the lives it steamrolls. Through the eyes of Kosawa\\u2019s citizens young and old, Mbue constructs a nuanced exploration of self-interest, of what it means to want in the age of capitalism and colonialism \\u2014 these machines of malicious, insatiable wanting.\", \"In Kitamura\\u2019s fourth novel, an unnamed court translator in The Hague is tasked with intimately vanishing into the voices and stories of war criminals whom she alone can communicate with; falling meanwhile into a tumultuous entanglement with a man whose marriage may or may not be over for good. Kitamura\\u2019s sleek and spare prose elegantly breaks grammatical convention, mirroring the book\\u2019s concern with the bleeding lines between intimacies \\u2014 especially between the sincere and the coercive. Like her previous novel, \\u201cA Separation,\\u201d \\u201cIntimacies\\u201d scrutinizes the knowability of those around us, not as an end in itself but as a lens on grand social issues from gentrification to colonialism to feminism. The path a life cuts through the world, this book seems to say, has its greatest significance in the effect it has on others.\", \"\\u201cThe Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois,\\u201d the first novel by Jeffers, a celebrated poet, is many things at once: a moving coming-of-age saga, an examination of race and an excavation of American history. It cuts back and forth between the tale of Ailey Pearl Garfield, a Black girl growing up at the end of the 20th century, and the \\u201csongs\\u201d of her ancestors, Native Americans and enslaved African Americans who lived through the formation of the United States. As their stories converge, \\u201cLove Songs\\u201d creates an unforgettable portrait of Black life that reveals how the past still reverberates today.\", \"Lockwood first found acclaim as a poet on the internet, with gloriously inventive and ribald verse \\u2014 sexts elevated to virtuosity. In \\u201cPriestdaddy,\\u201d her indelible 2017 memoir about growing up in rectories across the Midwest presided over by her gun-loving, guitar-playing father, a Catholic priest, she called tweeting \\u201can art form, like sculpture, or honking the national anthem under your armpit.\\u201d Here, in her first novel, she distills the pleasures and deprivations of life split between online and flesh-and-blood interactions, transfiguring the dissonance into art. The result is a book that reads like a prose poem, at once sublime, profane, intimate, philosophical, hilarious and, eventually, deeply moving.\", \"Labatut expertly stitches together the stories of the 20th century\\u2019s greatest thinkers to explore both the ecstasy and agony of scientific breakthroughs: their immense gains for society as well as their steep human costs. His journey to the outermost edges of knowledge \\u2014 guided by the mathematician Alexander Grothendieck, the physicist Werner Heisenberg and the chemist Fritz Haber, among others \\u2014 offers glimpses of a universe with limitless potential underlying the observable world, a \\u201cdark nucleus at the heart of things\\u201d that some of its witnesses decide is better left alone. This extraordinary hybrid of fiction and nonfiction also provokes the frisson of an extended true-or-false test: The further we read, the blurrier the line gets between fact and fabulism.\", \"Ditlevsen\\u2019s gorgeous memoirs, first published in Denmark in the 1960s and \\u201970s and collected here in a single volume, detail her hardscrabble upbringing, career path and merciless addictions: a powerful account of the struggle to reconcile art and life. She joined the working ranks at 14, became a renowned poet by her early 20s, and found herself, after two failed marriages, wedded to a psychopathic doctor and hopelessly dependent on opioids by her 30s. Yet for all the dramatic twists of her life, these books together project a stunning clarity, humor and candidness, casting light not just on the world\\u2019s harsh realities but on the inexplicable impulses of our secret selves.\", \"For this timely and thought-provoking book, Smith, a poet and journalist, toured sites key to the history of slavery and its present-day legacy, including Thomas Jefferson\\u2019s Monticello; Angola, the Louisiana State Penitentiary; and a Confederate cemetery. Interspersing interviews with the tourists, guides, activists and local historians he meets along the way with close readings of scholarship and poignant personal reflection, Smith holds up a mirror to America\\u2019s fraught relationship with its past, capturing a potent mixture of good intentions, earnest corrective, willful ignorance and blatant distortion.\", \"To expand on her acclaimed 2013 series for The Times about Dasani Coates, a homeless New York schoolgirl, and her family, Elliott spent years following her subjects in their daily lives, through shelters, schools, courtrooms and welfare offices. The book she has produced \\u2014 intimately reported, elegantly written and suffused with the fierce love and savvy observations of Dasani and her mother \\u2014 is a searing account of one family\\u2019s struggle with poverty, homelessness and addiction in a city and country that have failed to address these issues with efficacy or compassion.\", \"This book weaves together history and memoir into a short volume that is insightful, touching and courageous. Exploring the racial and social complexities of Texas, her home state, Gordon-Reed asks readers to step back from the current heated debates and take a more nuanced look at history and the surprises it can offer. Such a perspective comes easy to her because she was a part of history \\u2014 the first Black child to integrate her East Texas school. On several occasions, she found herself shunned by whites and Blacks alike, learning at an early age that breaking the color line can be threatening to both races.\", \"It\\u2019s daring to undertake a new biography of Plath, whose life, and death by suicide at 30 in 1963, have been thoroughly picked over by scholars. Yet this meticulously researched and, at more than 1,000 pages, unexpectedly riveting portrait is a monumental achievement. Determined to rescue the poet from posthumous caricature as a doomed madwoman and \\u201creposition her as one of the most important American writers of the 20th century,\\u201d Clark, a professor of poetry in England, delivers a transporting account of a rare literary talent and the familial and intellectual milieu that both thwarted and encouraged her, enlivened throughout by quotations from Plath\\u2019s letters, diaries, poetry and prose.\", \"Follow New York Times Books on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, sign up for our newsletter or our literary calendar.
