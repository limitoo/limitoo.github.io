Thus, the toe bacteria were involved in the production of Limburger cheese.\\\"\", \"While experimenting with dirty socks is not Dr Kline's usual MO, it did highlight the fact that mosquitoes are attracted to volatile chemicals we breathe out, or that are produced by bacteria acting on substances produced on the skin, including sweat.\", \"And some volatile chemicals people give off actually seem to protect them from mosquitoes.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/72566/eight_col_62665770_l.jpg?1547140671\\\" alt=\\\"Girl with blond hair, sitting with his back turned and scratching bitten, red, swollen neck skin from mosquito bites in the summer in the forest.

Your body heat also helps mosquitoes to zoom in on you.\", \"\\\"A complex interaction of all of these cues will determine if you get bitten,\\\" says Dr Kline's chemist colleague Ed Norris.\", \"Differences in our genetics, and the cosmetic products we wear also add to the mix, making it a very tricky job to identify what exactly makes someone a mozzie magnet.\", \"Plus, different mosquitoes prefer different scents.\", \"\\\"There are plenty of mosquitoes that are known to be ankle biters or face biters, so there's presumably different volatiles on those different parts of the body that are attracting them,\\\" Dr Norris says.\", \"Finally, your skin's tendency to react to any bites you get may also explain why some people blithely enjoy that outside party, while you don't.\", \"They may be being bitten but not even notice it!\", \"Still, many of us love a simple explanation - and the promise of a more pleasant alternative to slathering ourselves in insect repellent - so it's no wonder there are so many theories out there claiming to explain why mozzies prefer some people over others.\", \"For example, you may have heard eating bananas or drinking beer attracts mozzies, while eating garlic or vitamin B protects you.\", \"Sadly, says medical entomologist Cameron Webb at the University of Sydney, you can't hang your hat on any of these ideas.\", \"\\\"While some food or drink may subtly change the attraction of mosquitoes, changing diet won't stop you having to use insect repellents,\\\" Dr Webb says.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/72214/eight_col_44512276_l.jpg?1546203022\\\" alt=\\\"Woman using mosquito repellent on her legs.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPhoto: 123RF\\n</div>\", \"There's some evidence those with certain blood types are more attractive to mozzies, but Dr Kline says there's conflicting evidence and not enough research to settle the question.\", \"And are men or women more likely to get bitten?
