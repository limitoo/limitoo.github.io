When the deal goes through, People will have its second new owner in three years. The expected merger will create a media giant, called Dotdash Meredith, led by the Dotdash chief executive, Neil Vogel.\", \"Executives on both sides of the deal have described it as a peanut-butter-and-chocolate corporate merger: Meredith, a Des Moines, Iowa, magazine giant founded in 1902, has the content that appeals to readers all across the country; Dotdash has the digital know-how.\", \"Dotdash is a division of InterActiveCorp, the company behind the dating apps Tinder, OK Cupid and Match. It is relatively new to lifestyle journalism, though, having gotten its start as the reference website About.com.\", \"Dotdash now has 14 online publications, including Serious Eats, TripSavvy, Investopedia, Verywell Health and Lifewire. Readers visit them when they are about to decide what to cook, where to stay, how to invest. The sites are information resources, often different in tone from most of the roughly 40 publications housed by Meredith, a roster that includes Better Homes & Gardens, Real Simple, Food & Wine and Southern Living.\", \"Mr. Vogel, the Dotdash chief, singled out People as a key to the deal in a call with investors last month. Under new ownership, he said, People would become more of a digital powerhouse, helping Dotdash Meredith reach 180 million readers a month. With an audience of that size, Dotdash Meredith would be a serious competitor to Facebook and Google for digital advertising dollars, he argued.\", \"But Mr. Vogel acknowledged that People and another Meredith magazine, Entertainment Weekly, might not seem like logical fits at first glance. They are \\u201cnot as intent-driven as the rest of the things we do,\\u201d he told investors \\u2014 meaning they are not as likely to be visited by readers in search of practical information, Dotdash\\u2019s stock in trade.\", \"Aileen Gallagher, a professor of magazine journalism at Syracuse University\\u2019s Newhouse School, questioned whether the addition of People made sense for its next owner. \\u201cThe rest of the Meredith publications, I can see where they fit into Dotdash\\u2019s portfolio,\\u201d she said. \\u201cPeople is a tough call.\\u201d\", \"Unlike Dotdash\\u2019s titles, People is centered on a weekly print magazine, a top seller at supermarket checkout lanes. People\\u2019s average paid print circulation, nearly three million, is higher than that of any other magazine other than Better Homes & Gardens and two publications from AARP, according to the Alliance for Audited Media.\", \"IAC executives said there were no immediate plans to scrap the print editions of the Meredith magazines but they expected print media\\u2019s broad decline to continue. \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to carefully manage the print business,\\u201d Tim Quinn, Dotdash\\u2019s chief financial officer, said on the investors\\u2019 call. \\u201cWe think there\\u2019s an opportunity to focus on the top titles and quality subscribers.\\u201d\", \"In an interview, Mr. Vogel declined to discuss People directly, because the merger has yet to close, but he said that Dotdash sees value in content with broad appeal. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not trying to build audiences and sell ads, though it is ultimately what we do,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re trying to build relationships with people, where they come to us.\\u201d\", \"Time Inc., a dominant force in American publishing of the 20th century, runs deep in People\\u2019s DNA. The magazine was founded in 1974 as spinoff of a one-page feature in Time, called People.\", \"\\u201cThere is nothing abstract about our name,\\u201d Richard B. Stolley, the founding editor, wrote in a letter to readers in the first issue, which had Mia Farrow on the cover. \\u201cPeople is what we are all about.\\u201d\", \"Crisply written and personality-driven, People was an immediate sensation, despite the snickers of some Time journalists who dismissed it a gossip rag, and it turned a profit within 18 months.\", \"\\u201cPeople really anticipated, captured and ushered in the rise of celebrity culture in America,\\u201d Ms. Gallagher said.\", \"Larry Hackett, People\\u2019s top editor from 2006 to 2014, said the combination of stories on celebrities and ordinary people was a key to its success. \\u201cThe beauty of the magazine was that mix,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was not the most important stuff, but it was always very interesting.\\u201d\", \"People developed Best & Worst Dressed and other franchises; presented the homey side of one White House family after another in dispatches from its Washington bureau; and chronicled the ups and downs of Jennifer Aniston, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. It was a perennial Time Inc. cash cow, responsible for 20 percent of company revenue as late as 2014.\", \"\\u201cIf we didn\\u2019t sell a million copies in a week on newsstands, someone would want to talk to me,\\u201d Mr. Hackett said.\", \"With the rise of digital media, Time Inc. struggled to adjust. Meredith swooped in with an offer of $2.8 billion in 2017. On Jan. 31, 2018, workers pried the Time Inc. sign off the company\\u2019s Manhattan headquarters and replaced it with the Meredith logo. The company later sold off some of the big Time Inc. properties \\u2014 Time, Sports Illustrated and Fortune \\u2014 but hung on to People.\", \"A few months after the acquisition, Meredith elevated Dan Wakeford from deputy editor to editor in chief of People. Under Mr. Wakeford, People has continued an emphasis on digital media. From 37 million print and digital readers in 2018, according to the magazine\\u2019s media kit, it now has more than 65 million digitally, according to Comscore. (Meredith declined to comment for this article.)\", \"Ms. Gallagher, the journalism professor, said that People\\u2019s challenges include the rise of smartphone usage, which has cut into the audience for print magazines, as well as the coarsening of celebrity coverage, which contrasts with People\\u2019s more journalistic tone.\", \"The magazine\\u2019s editorial staff has remained in Manhattan since Meredith took over. In a staff memo this month, Tom Harty, Meredith\\u2019s chief executive, said the merger was on track to close by year\\u2019s end.\"]","href_hash":"1e6799a6460b11ecb934c7ac8a7ae7b2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1e6799a6460b11ecb934c7ac8a7ae7b2"}},
