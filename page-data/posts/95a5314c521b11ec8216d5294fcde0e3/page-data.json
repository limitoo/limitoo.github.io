It says hundreds of students, who are not yet fully vaccinated, will face further delays to\\u00a0getting licences.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/200784/eight_col_eight_col_83146035_l.jpg?1562391400\\\" alt=\\\"Learning to drive a car with instructor.

And I was told no,\\u00a0that they need to be able to produce a vaccine certificate.\", \"\\\"The big\\u00a0issue is, a lot of our students were booked\\u00a0to set their practical tests during the\\u00a0level 4\\u00a0lockdown. And when when we went back to level 2 in September, they were automatically rescheduled. Some of those young people, their tests are\\u00a0coming up now.\", \"\\\"So when they booked, a vaccination certificate wasn't even on the table. To have waited for two to three months for their test to come up and to\\u00a0now find out that they can't do the test until they're double-vaxxed, and that they'll need to reschedule again, is going to be a real blow to them.\\\"\", \"She said it will be particularly tough as around New Zealand right now there is a wait time of up to 12 weeks, and Auckland's waitlist is worse.\", \"\\\"That's not to say that all of these young people are not vaccinated. Some of them may have had one [shot], but many of them aren't double-vaxxed and don't have that vaccine passport yet.\\\"\", \"Robertson estimates hundreds of young people around Aotearoa will be affected by the rule.\\u00a0\", \"She said she thinks their reasons not to be vaccinated will be a mix of the common issues.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I know a lot of them are\\u00a0very much undecided as they read different things on\\u00a0social media and they're still making up their mind.\", \"\\\"Some of them are keen\\u00a0just to wait and see how it affects their peers. Others, some of these young people sitting there licences are\\u00a017, 18, still living at home, and their family may have taken the stance that it's not for them.\", \"\\\"So the decision may not even be theirs.\\\"\", \"Some of the youth are living in some of Aotearoa's lowest vaccinated areas, she said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We would like to see at least the practical test be\\u00a0deemed as an essential service. We know through the driving change network that a driver's licence is essential to gaining not only employment, but also being able to access further education and everyday life.\", \"\\\"Particularly for those for those people living rurally, where they don't have access to public transport. To take to take the ability to gain a driver's licence off them as is going to be a huge blow for them.\\\"\", \"In a statement, James\\u00a0Law, operations support manager for VTNZ, said: \\u201cVTNZ has been working closely with Waka Kotahi NZTA following the Ministry of Health guidelines to develop the health and safety procedures that are necessary to safely conduct driver licence testing.
