He also owns an apartment in Fort Lee, N.J., with his companion, Tracey Collins. Twice, in response to reporters\\u2019 questions, he has promised to amend the tax returns. He has blamed the discrepancies on his accountant, who he said was homeless.\", \"To get to the bottom of this mystery, the real-estate news site Curbed staked out the Brooklyn home last week.\", \"At 4:18 a.m. last Tuesday, Mr. Adams pulled up to the curb in a gray Toyota Prius and parked illegally, in front of the garage of a plumbing supply company, Curbed reported.\", \"As Mr. Adams apparently slept, trucks trying to access the plumbing business \\u201cbacked up all the way down Lafayette Avenue, causing a bona fide pileup.\\u201d\", \"Finally, at 8 a.m., a forklift from the supply company used a yellow rope to pull Mr. Adams\\u2019s car out of the way.\", \"When Mr. Adams left his house that morning, he found the traffic jam he had created blocking his path. So he drove down the sidewalk, photos show. Mr. Adams returned to the house that same evening, after participating in the final mayoral debate.\", \"Curbed considers its own stakeout inconclusive. It may also soon be a moot point. Mr. Adams is likely to win Tuesday\\u2019s election, which means that come January, he may be living in Gracie Mansion.\"]","href_hash":"941a35e63c3311ec8842000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"941a35e63c3311ec8842000017025a03"}},
