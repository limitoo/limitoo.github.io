As the cases unfold, we see science (handwriting analysis, fingerprinting and the like) slowly marshaled to solve them.\", \"Some of the murderers featured in the book are famous, like Lizzie Borden, Richard Hauptmann and various members of the Hatfield and McCoy families. Most, however, are less well known, or in some cases not known at all: In a story that gripped Gilded Age New York City, a wealthy businessman named Benjamin Nathan, a founder of Mount Sinai Hospital, was bludgeoned to death in his home in 1870. Though the case played out in the papers for years, no one was ever arrested.\", \"ATLAS OF THE INVISIBLEMaps and Graphics That Will Change How You See the WorldBy James Cheshire and Oliver UbertiIllustrated. 216 pp. Norton. $40.\", \"In their previous books \\u2014 \\u201cWhere the Animals Go\\u201d and \\u201cLondon: The Information Capital\\u201d \\u2014 Cheshire, a geography professor, and Uberti, a graphic designer and visual journalist, upended our ideas of what maps and atlases can be, by presenting data in imaginative and unexpected ways that make it easy to visualize complex scientific concepts.\", \"Their latest endeavor is no exception. \\u201cOur overall aim is to show you patterns,\\u201d the authors write, \\u201cnot places.\\u201d In a chapter called \\u201cWhat We Face,\\u201d they bring fresh focus to global warming. One map shows the global proliferation of wildfires, based on data from fire-detecting satellites whose thermal sensors can \\u201cdetect heat from fires as small as a parking space.\\u201d It\\u2019s one thing to think, It seems the whole world is on fire, and it\\u2019s another to see those fires illustrated in sharp relief on a map that\\u2019s blood-red with hot zones in Africa, the Amazon basin, Australia. (Those California fires? A few isolated dots.) Later in the same chapter another map uses satellite imagery to track the movement, or melting, of glaciers; still another shows how, and why, rising sea levels pose such a grave threat to the western Pacific. \", \"ATLAS OF IMAGINED PLACESFrom Lilliput to Gotham CityBy Matt Brown and Rhys B. DaviesIllustrated. 168 pp. Batsford. $34.99.\", \"Anyone can find New York City on a map. But what if you\\u2019re looking for the lost city of Atlantis, or Wakanda, or Gilligan\\u2019s Island? Twin Peaks? Thomas Hardy\\u2019s Wessex? \\u201cWelcome to the atlas of places that do not exist,\\u201d Brown and Davies write in the introduction to this luxe oversize book. \\u201cNone are found in a conventional atlas, but all exist in works of the imagination\\u201d \\u2014 novels, movies, TV shows, video games, myths and comic books.\", \"The stunning pastel maps are accompanied by brief essays that explain why certain places show up where they do. Hogwarts and Hogsmeade, for example, appear in eastern Scotland because in the Harry Potter series, \\u201cSirius Black is spotted passing through the real community of Dufftown,\\u201d in the Cairngorms mountains. \\u201cOnly 48 kilometers (30 miles) from Dufftown we find the skiing resort of Aviemore, and it is at Aviemore\\u2019s railway station \\u2026 that second-generation Potter-protagonists Albus and Scorpius arrive after an overnight walk from Hogwarts\\u201d in \\u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child.\\u201d Therefore, Brown and Davies are \\u201cpretty confident in saying that both Hogwarts and Hogsmeade lie within a short walk of Aviemore, and have charted it as such.\\u201d\", \"MAPPING NATURE ACROSS THE AMERICASEdited by Kathleen A. Brosnan and James R. AkermanIllustrated. 416 pp. University of Chicago. $70.\", \"You might not expect an atlas to open with the editors declaring that \\u201cmaps are inherently unnatural,\\u201d as Brosnan and Akerman do here.\", \"\\u201cMaps are abstractions that capture someone\\u2019s idea of what matters within a particular place,\\u201d they write, pointing out that maps also reflect cultural values of their eras through what they do \\u2014 and do not \\u2014 include. This book, featuring essays from a number of scholars, focuses on how early maps depicted the natural world. It turns out they\\u2019re a valuable source of environmental history.\", \"Centuries ago, maps were sometimes aspirational, reflecting what their creators hoped to find, or even \\u201cwindows into the geographic imaginations of human beings,\\u201d as opposed to faithful depictions of what places were actually like. But even these kinds of inaccuracies have things to tell us. Why do palm trees adorn so many early maps of places where they did not grow? Is there a reason so many Indigenous names for waterways survive in some parts of the American South? What can a late-16th- or early-17th-century map tell us about Aztec agriculture? \\u201cMapping Nature\\u201d explores these questions and more.\", \"DETROIT IN 50 MAPSBy Alex B. HillIllustrated. 143 pp. Belt. $30.\", \" In 2013, Hill \\u2014 an anthropologist whose work at the Detroit Food Map Initiative assesses neighborhoods\\u2019 access to grocery stores and farmers\\u2019 markets \\u2014 started a website called DETROITography. \\u201cI wanted a place to share my maps, the maps of other great cartographers, as well as historical maps,\\u201d he writes. He also wanted to connect \\u201cmaps and data to the stories and situations of people.\\u201d\", \"An extension of that project, \\u201cDetroit in 50 Maps\\u201d is an offbeat, fascinating, decidedly lo-fi atlas. Hill doesn\\u2019t completely dispense with traditional street maps, but he explains how the city\\u2019s hub-and-spoke layout was modeled after those of Paris and Washington, D.C. \\u2014 and shows how many of its major urban roadways follow ancient Indigenous trails.\", \"It\\u2019s the maps exploring Detroit daily life that reveal the most about the place. Which neighborhood has the most churches? The most liquor stores? Where do most graffiti arrests take place? What areas have the highest burden of chronic disease? Can the locations of new coffee shops show which parts of town are gentrifying most rapidly? Each map is interesting on its own, but taken together \\u2014 despite the title, there are far more than 50 \\u2014 they offer a lively cultural snapshot of the Motor City.\"]","href_hash":"21b83760547411eca20e7bba5c39500d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"21b83760547411eca20e7bba5c39500d"}},
