These factors include high blood pressure, elevated cholesterol, diabetes, a history of smoking, obesity and a family history of premature heart disease.\", \"When a patient has either no risk factors or many of them, treatment decisions are usually straightforward. Doctors typically tell patients with no risk factors to keep doing what they\\u2019re doing, while those at high or moderately high risk are often advised to start medications along with adopting lifestyle measures, like a heart-healthy diet and regular exercise.\", \"But when patients are in the middle-ground of risk, or are known to be at elevated risk but resist advice to take medication or change their habits, there\\u2019s a test that can help to clarify the best course of treatment and help convince reluctant patients to follow it.\", \"The test is a coronary calcium scan, which takes 10 to 15 minutes and usually costs about $100 to $400, though it is often not covered by insurance. The test uses specialized CT X-rays to assess the presence and amount of calcium (actually bony deposits of plaque that signal atherosclerosis, or \\u201chardening of the arteries\\u201d) in the blood vessels that feed the heart.\", \"The radiation dose is low, about the amount in a mammogram, and calcium scores can range from zero up into the thousands. The higher the level of calcium in coronary arteries, the greater the patient\\u2019s likelihood of suffering a cardiovascular event like a heart attack or stroke within the next decade.\", \"Recently, a friend in his early 60s with a family history of heart disease and a somewhat elevated cholesterol level had a coronary artery calcium test suggested by his doctor. Although the test showed my friend\\u2019s arteries had very little calcium, it wasn\\u2019t zero, and the doctor decided to prescribe a statin to lower his serum cholesterol and prevent worsening of atherosclerosis, the artery-clogging disease that underlies most heart attacks.\", \"In 2018, the United States Preventive Services Task Force acknowledged that the calcium test can indeed help doctors assess a patient\\u2019s cardiovascular risk. But the agency concluded that there was not yet adequate evidence to show that the test\\u2019s results improved patient outcomes above what is typically recommended, based on standard risk factors alone.\", \"Still, many doctors who practice preventive cardiology believe otherwise. They say the results of a calcium scan can pinpoint which patients would benefit from treatment to reduce their cardiovascular risk and help motivate patients to follow through, for example, by changing their diet or taking medication.\", \"Dr. Sadiya S. Khan, a preventive cardiologist at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University, said that she and many other cardiologists follow the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association\\u2019s conclusion that the calcium test can help guide therapeutic options, especially for patients with a borderline or intermediate risk of developing cardiovascular disease.\", \"In an editorial on \\u201cThe Potential and Pitfalls of Coronary Artery Calcium Scoring,\\u201d published in JAMA Cardiology in October, Dr. Khan and her co-author, Dr. Ann Marie Navar, a cardiologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School, concluded that for middle-aged and older adults like my friend, the calcium test is one of the best and safest ways to identify the presence of otherwise hidden atherosclerosis.\", \"Results of a calcium scan can also be important for younger men and women \\u2014 and sometimes for their physicians, who may not take risk factors in younger patients as seriously as they should.\", \"\\u201cGiven the robust association between coronary artery calcium and cardiovascular disease,\\u201d Drs. Khan and Navar wrote, \\u201cthe presence of coronary artery calcium in young adults should be a red flag for a high-risk patient.\\u201d As Dr. Khan explained in an interview, \\u201cThe presence of any calcium in coronary arteries is a sign of having heart disease.\\u201d\", \"When atherosclerosis first starts to develop, the arterial lesions, called plaque, are not calcified, explained Dr. Philip Greenland, also a preventive cardiologist at Northwestern. Rather, the lesions acquire the bony deposits over time that gradually increase when the plaque ruptures and is repaired. The healing process causes calcification, he said.\", \"Dr. Greenland cautioned that patients and doctors should never assume that a calcium score of zero means there\\u2019s nothing to worry about. He said that in men under 40 and women under 50, \\u201cyou can\\u2019t rely on coronary artery calcium alone, because the level is typically zero even in the presence of atherosclerosis.\\u201d\", \"Rather, he and Dr. Kahn said, in younger adults, follow-up tests and medical advice should be based on the extent of patients\\u2019 cardiovascular risk, including whether they have any symptoms of heart disease, like shortness of breath when climbing stairs or chest pain when exerting themselves.\", \"Dr. Greenland said that people with \\u201ca low-risk factor profile and a calcium score of zero have a kind of warranty that they won\\u2019t have a heart attack within 10 years.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBut,\\u201d he continued, \\u201cif risk factors put you above a 20-percent 10-year risk of a cardiovascular event, even zero calcium is not sufficient to provide such a warranty.\\u201d You can determine your risk profile, which considers such factors as age, gender and race, using the calculator at cvriskcalculator.com.\", \"The value of this advice is underscored by the findings of a large study, also published in October in JAMA Cardiology. A cardiology team from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark reported that among nearly 24,000 high-risk patients who had symptoms of cardiovascular disease, 14 percent of those with obstructions in their coronary arteries nonetheless had no evidence of coronary calcium.\", \"For patients in the 10-year study who were younger than 60, a \\u201csizable proportion\\u201d of obstructive coronary artery disease occurred among those with no coronary artery calcium, yet they faced a seriously increased risk of heart attack and death, the Danish team wrote.\", \"Based on the Danish report, Dr. Khan said, \\u201cHaving a calcium score of zero is not a get-out-of-jail-free card,\\u201d especially for younger men and women, who may still be at high risk for coronary artery disease despite the absence of coronary calcium. She noted that in the United States, Black adults tend to have less coronary artery calcium compared to their white peers but may still be at high risk because of other cardiac risk factors.\", \"Dr. Khan emphasized that regardless of calcium score, all patients at high risk, and especially those with symptoms of heart disease, should be treated with medication and lifestyle changes. Among helpful measures are lowering elevated levels of blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose; adopting a heart-healthy diet; getting regular physical exercise; and striving to achieve and maintain a normal body weight.\"]","href_hash":"062d2a264b7f11ecaa1c65446754d144"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"062d2a264b7f11ecaa1c65446754d144"}},
