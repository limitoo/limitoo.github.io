restrictions.","country":"au","create_time":"2021-12-08T18:35:56.000Z","content":"[\"A \\\"furious\\\" Boris Johnson has apologised after video leaked of his staff joking about a Christmas party held at Downing Street last year while the country was under tough COVID-19 restrictions.\", \"It comes after a week of denials from the British Prime Minister and his officials that a party happened or that any rules were broken after the Daily Mirror newspaper reported there were several gatherings that had taken place at No 10 Downing Street during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in December 2020, when indoor mixing was banned in London.\", \"The video showed the Prime Minister's then-spokeswoman Allegra Stratton laughing when she was asked by another government staffer to talk about the alleged party during a mock press conference set up to test Downing Street's new briefing room on December 22 last year.\", \"In the video, which was first aired by her former employer ITV News, she was shown joking and laughing with colleagues, and asked if the \\\"cheese and wine\\\" was alright at the Christmas party.\", \"The room the comments took place in\\u00a0been renovated at a cost of nearly $5 million to allow the British government to give White House-style televised daily press briefings, but the briefings were reportedly scrapped shortly after the mock press conference.\", \"The leaking of the video has seen pressure mounting on Mr Johnson to explain what exactly happened, while on Wednesday afternoon Ms Stratton resigned as she made a\\u00a0tearful statement outside her house.\", \"\\\"That was never my intention \\u2013 I will regret those remarks for the rest of my days.\", \"\\\"To all of you who lost loved ones, who endured intolerable loneliness and who struggled with your businesses \\u2014\\u00a0I am truly sorry and this afternoon I am offering my resignation to the Prime Minister.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/fb9109011956187b4c6c7a0655ee4733\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Leaked video shows Downing Street staff joking about Christmas party they later denied having</div>\", \"The leaked video has also caused anger amongst the thousands of families of those who lost loved ones in the pandemic, with one labelling the government's behaviour\\u00a0\\\"despicable\\\".\", \"Earlier in the day Mr Johnson started off Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons with the apology and told MPs he had been \\\"repeatedly assured\\\" that no party had taken place and no COVID-19 rules had been broken.\", \"\\\"I understand and share the anger up and down the country at seeing No 10 staff seeming to make light of lockdown measures, and I can understand how infuriating it must be to think that the people who have been setting the rules have not been following the rules,\\\" Mr Johnson said.\", \"\\\"But I repeat, that I have been repeatedly assured since these allegations emerged, that there was no party, and that no COVID rules were broken, and that is what I've been repeatedly assured.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Investigation to take place</div>\", \"Mr Johnson said the country's top civil servant, Simon Case, would investigate what happened on December 18 last year, the day the party allegedly took place.\", \"\\\"I have asked the Cabinet Secretary to establish all the facts and to report back as soon as possible, and it goes without saying that if those rules were broken, then there will be disciplinary action for all those involved,\\\" Mr Johnson\\u00a0said.\", \"Opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer attacked Mr Johnson, saying that the public now think he was \\\"taking them for fools\\\".\", \"\\\"We've all watched the video of the Prime Minister's staff, including his personal spokesperson \\u2013 they knew there was a party, they knew it was against the rules, they knew they couldn't admit it, and they thought it was funny,\\\" he said.\", \"Questions have also been raised over another two parties that are said to have taken place at No 10 in late 2020, including one Mr Johnson was said to have given a speech at on November 27, and another one former aide Dominic Cummings said happened inside Mr Johnson's own flat on November 13.\", \"During the entire month of November last year England was in a national lockdown.\", \"On Wednesday a further 51,342 COVID-19 cases were recorded in the UK, and there is speculation the government will bring in new measures to curb the spread of the Omicron COVID variant, while another 161 people died within 28 days of a positive test.\", \"The total death toll for the UK now stands at 145,987.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'It feels like I'm being gut-punched'</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/56446f8ae2406873482ffc3e29e38792\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Susie Flintham with her father Howard Crozier, who died from COVID-19 in March 2020.(Supplied: Susie Flintham)</div>\", \"Susie Flintham lost her father Howard to COVID-19 at the start of the pandemic in March 2020.\", \"He had been moved from his care home in Sunderland, in England's north-east, to be treated for pneumonia in hospital, where he caught the virus.\", \"Mrs Flintham said she was only allowed to see him at the very end of his life, shortly before he\\u00a0died within a week of being admitted.\", \"She told the ABC she was\\u00a0\\\"in disbelief\\\" over the video.\", \"\\\"How on earth could anybody think that what's happened is, okay?\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"I saw the video of Allegra Stratton laughing, and I was in shock.\", \"\\\"I feel sick, and I am deeply upset and I'm having flashbacks to what happened last March.\", \"Mrs Flintham, who is part of the COVID-19 Bereaved Families for Justice UK, said she was also worried the incident has undermined public health messaging at a crucial time.\", \"\\\"Public confidence in in the Prime Minister's authority is going to be at an all time low, so what's happened is potentially fatal,\\\" she said.\", \"Jean Adamson also lost her father to COVID-19 and said the government's behaviour had been \\\"despicable\\\".\", \"\\\"Whilst the rest of the nation had to adhere to the rules, we had to watch our loved ones dying on their own without a hand to hold, without any comfort, and we have those who lead us behaving in this way, flouting the rules that they make,\\\" she told Sky News.\", \"\\\"Again \\u2013 one run for them, and another rule for the rest of us, it's just absolutely sickening.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"a2325be8585511ec986fc3b37cf35ac3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a2325be8585511ec986fc3b37cf35ac3"}},
