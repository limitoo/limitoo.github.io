Fandoms are one of the ways I mark a year across the spectrum of entertainment genres that I consume every day. Here\\u2019s my list of 10 favorite TV series, movies and plays that thrilled me as a comics nerd, pop culture nerd, literary nerd and drama nerd.\", \"As a longtime fan of \\u201cCowboy Bebop,\\u201d I\\u2019d been waiting for Netflix\\u2019s live-action adaptation of the anime with cautious anticipation. Though the series, a sci-fi Western noir about a ragtag crew of bounty hunters in space, is fantastic when it\\u2019s good and pretty damn terrible when it\\u2019s bad, the music, the style and the performances of the perfectly cast main stars pull the show through and make it essential for \\u201cBebop\\u201d fans. But more important, the show drew me back to the original, helping me appreciate anew what makes \\u201cCowboy Bebop\\u201d a timeless classic. (Streaming on Netflix.)\", \"I\\u2019m far from a history buff, but will happily nerd out about Tudor England, especially when it resembles a high school drama. So \\u201cSix,\\u201d a glamorous Broadway musical about the wives of King Henry VIII, is up my alley. \\u201cSix\\u201d was on my docket in March 2020, and missing it when the pandemic shut down Broadway was one of my sorest disappointments in those first few weeks of lockdown. But now that it\\u2019s back it feels like the perfect Broadway return show, with its flamboyant costumes, big lights and even bigger musical numbers. (Read our review.)\", \"Fun, lovable and playful, this animated film is also culturally relevant, as it follows a kooky family that is humanity\\u2019s last hope after robots take over the world. The movie is admirably multilayered, mixing standard dialogue with voice-overs and internal monologues and combining 3-D animation with hand-drawn illustrations. And the references \\u2014 to Apple products, YouTube and Furbys, among many other things \\u2014 are enough to please both millennials and Gen Z-ers. (Streaming on Netflix.)\", \"The first time I saw \\u201cIn the Heights\\u201d was over a decade ago, on Broadway; it was my introduction to the wonder that is Lin-Manuel Miranda. Jon M. Chu\\u2019s vibrant film adaptation was also my path back to that precious realm of overpriced candy and artificially buttered popcorn \\u2014 the movie theater. In Chu\\u2019s hands, the story of a bodega owner named Usnavi, who aims to leave his beloved New York for his dream life in the Caribbean, teems with color and movement. And the cast \\u2014 including Anthony Ramos, Daphne Rubin-Vega, Christopher Jackson and Miranda himself \\u2014 is full of delights for theater nerds. (Read our review.)\", \"As a poet with two literature degrees, I can\\u2019t resist a weird archaic poem about Celtic mythology \\u2014 or a film adaptation of that poem, \\u201cSir Gawain and the Green Knight.\\u201d \\u201cThe Green Knight,\\u201d eloquently directed by David Lowery, manages to pull off the dazzling feat of translating the tone, style and even rhythm of a written text to a visual medium. The actor Dev Patel gives a striking performance as Sir Gawain, a young knight who, in a bid for greatness, becomes a player in a deadly game against the mysterious Green Knight. With eloquent cinematography, a ruminative score, and a plot that takes flights into the surreal, \\u201cThe Green Knight\\u201d resists conventional storytelling to train its viewers to receive the work like a poem: slowly, with plenty of room for symbolism, atmospheric shifts and silences. (Read our review.)\", \"Who you gonna call to revive a pop culture classic? The original director\\u2019s son, apparently. After the franchise\\u2019s vapid 2016 reboot, \\u201cGhostbusters: Afterlife\\u201d shows the difference it makes when a project is a family affair. The director Jason Reitman picks up where his father, Ivan Reitman, left off in the 1980s, and even got the old cast together for this sequel, in which the family of the late Egon Spengler move to Oklahoma to inherit his farm. His grandchildren stumble onto his legacy and bust some ghosts to prevent an apocalypse. I watched this film in a room of eager nerds at New York Comic Con in October. Though \\u201cAfterlife\\u201d does do a lot of fan-pandering and nostalgia-baiting, I still found it absolutely endearing. There were tears. (Read our review.)\", \"The Marvel Cinematic Universe has been expanding so much that clever storytelling and character development often take a back seat to big battles and team-ups. That\\u2019s what made this Disney+ series, about Wanda and Vision living a domestic life that\\u2019s actually an illusion, so fascinating. The nods to different sitcom eras and the examination of Wanda\\u2019s grief after \\u201cAvengers: Endgame\\u201d make this show one of the most fruitful dives into the M.C.U. Oh, and Kathryn Hahn as the winking Agatha Harkness is absolute perfection. (Streaming on Disney+.)\", \"Two Black men waiting on a street corner, hoping to leave but inexplicably trapped. When my friend and I walked out of Antoinette Chinonye Nwandu\\u2019s stunning play \\u2014 my first Broadway show since the reopening \\u2014 she said, \\u201cI won\\u2019t ever forget that.\\u201d I felt the same. There were problems (I found fault with the ending), but not enough to undercut the wonder of the performances, the staging and Nwandu\\u2019s clever nods to Samuel Beckett\\u2019s \\u201cWaiting for Godot.\\u201d (Read our review.)\", \"The cancellation of this animated show was one of the great TV travesties of the year. The final season premiered this spring; I jumped aboard late, but happily binged all 40 episodes of the surreal anthology series, about characters who are summoned onto a fantastical train and must journey from car to car, tackling their trauma and pain through strange challenges, in order to return home. A corgi car, a chrome car, a map car, a cross-eyed duck car \\u2014 the show\\u2019s imaginative turns were always surprising. But it\\u2019s the depth of the story, which explored existential and moral questions and wasn\\u2019t afraid to go into dark territory, that made the show unforgettable. (Streaming on HBO Max.)\", \"The magic of this movie is so inviting that while watching it I kept thinking how bad I wanted to step into that world. A Colombian family with special abilities live in a house that has come under a mysterious threat. The animation is breathtaking and the music, by Lin-Manuel Miranda, is catchy. The heart of the film, however, is a message about the importance of family. Like the prophetic uncle of the film, I have my own vision of the future: There shall be many rewatchings.
