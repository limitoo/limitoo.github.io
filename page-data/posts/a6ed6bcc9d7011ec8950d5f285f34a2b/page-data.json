The Biden administration, though, has not gone so far as to ban Russian oil imports into the U.S., which purchases 600,000 barrels of Russian petroleum products per day.\", \"There have been growing calls on Capitol Hill, though, for the U.S. to ban energy imports from Russia, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday saying she is \\\"all for that.\\\" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told CNN on Sunday that the U.S. is speaking with European partners about a potential embargo.\", \"Schiff said lawmakers would like to move quickly on a ban, but said the U.S. needs to continue exploring ways to \\\"crush\\\" the Russian economy.\", \"\\\"We have to be circumspect about the fact that Russia will probably find somewhere else to sell that oil and gas to,\\\" he said. \\\"So the impact ultimately on Russia may not be as powerful as we would like.\\\"\", \"Schiff added that a \\\"very partisan Congress\\\" has united around a sanctions package and providing more military support to Ukraine.\", \"Asked how the U.S. would respond if something were to happen to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Schiff said the Biden administration is working to ensure he is protected.\", \"\\\"We're doing everything we can, supplying, I think, real time intelligence to help protect him, as well as to give Ukrainians the information they need to defend themselves,\\\" he said.\"]","href_hash":"a6ed6bcc9d7011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a6ed6bcc9d7011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
