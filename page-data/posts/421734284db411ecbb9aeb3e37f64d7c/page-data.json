On Thursday, more buildings in Chinatown went up in flames, according to local news media.\", \"Here\\u2019s what we know about the protesters\\u2019 grievances.\", \"Many of the protesters traveled from the island of Malaita to Guadalcanal Island, which houses the nation\\u2019s capital, according to officials and local news reports.\", \"Experts say discontent has simmered for decades between the two islands, mainly over a perceived unequal distribution of resources and a lack of economic support that has left Malaita one of the least-developed provinces in the island nation.\", \"There has also been lingering dissatisfaction in Malaita over the central government\\u2019s decision in 2019 to switch diplomatic allegiances to China from Taiwan, a self-governing island that China claims as its territory.\", \"Taiwan\\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs accused Beijing of bribing Solomons politicians to abandon Taipei in the run-up to the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People\\u2019s Republic of China under the Communist Party.\", \"The Solomon Islands is an archipelago made up of nearly a thousand islands in the Pacific, about 1,000 miles northeast of Australia. The island chain has a population of just 650,000, primarily farmers and fishers.\", \"Malaita is the most populous of the islands, with a population of 160,500 as of last year. Densely forested, mountainous and volcanic, it lies 30 miles northeast of Guadalcanal, the larger island, across Indispensable Strait.\", \"The island nation found itself in a heightened geopolitical tug of war because of the 2019 decision, which dealt a blow both to Taipei\\u2019s global standing and to Washington\\u2019s regional diplomacy.\", \"The United States sees the Solomon Islands, and other Pacific nations, as crucial in preventing China from asserting influence in the region.\", \"China has been investing heavily in the Pacific, to the alarm of U.S. officials.
