It will run from Wynyard Quarter to Mt Roskill before surfacing and running alongside SH20 to the airport.\", \"The option - which would cost about $14.6 billion - was recommended by the Auckland light rail establishment unit.\", \"National infrastructure spokesperson Simon Bridges said the project was wasted spending.\", \"\\\"Today we hear the government is going to spend another $50 million on a business case. That's $100m of taxpayers' money spent before they've even got spades in the ground.\", \"\\\"If it ever goes ahead it will be at least $15b of wasted spending. Their light rail dream is just that - a dream.\\\"\", \"Transport Minister Michael Wood told Checkpoint they acknowledged the project required significant Crown investment.\", \"On the finance said, he said they also continued to work with the local government about what their contribution might be, as well as the confirmation today that \\\"value capture\\\" was part of the project.\", \"\\\"It's estimated that could be $2 billion to $3 billion of the total contribution over time,\\\" Wood said of the value capture.\", \"\\\"If someone was making a large private gain out of all this public investment, it's not unreasonable to expect there might be a contribution, that's generally how these projects work overseas.\\\"\", \"Transport spokesperson Simeon Brown said the project's plan had been through so many iterations Aucklanders had given up believing it will happen.\", \"The government should prioritise a second crossing over the Waitemat\\u0101 Harbour, Brown said.\", \"\\\"Aucklanders are sick and tired of this government trying to sell light rail in multiple different ways and that's just the latest iteration.\", \"\\\"What we need is a second Harbour Crossing and that needs to be the number one priority for our city.\\\"\", \"Wood said the business case for a second harbour crossing was going ahead and public consultation would happen later this year, with decisions expected next year.\", \"\\\"There's not just one choke point in Auckland ... we're not just going to focus on one thing at a time. The whole point of this announcement is that we need a system-wide approach to better transport in Auckland.\\\"\", \"ACT's transport spokesperson Simon Court described the project as a \\\"disaster.\\\"\", \"\\\"We've spent four years trying to figure out how to make a political promise from Jacinda Ardern work. In the meantime, we've seen billions of dollars moved away from road building, projects cancelled, rescoped and deferred, fuel taxes increased, and regions neglected. New Zealanders deserve better.\\\"\", \"Green MP Ricardo Men\\u00e9ndez March said the party would prefer street-level light rail down Dominion Road.\", \"\\\"It's a missed opportunity to not have gone with surface light rail because it would have enabled us to complete the project faster and start reducing emissions sooner, as well as give people more options for how they get around our city.\\\"\", \"It was time to get on with the project, Men\\u00e9ndez March said, so the government had to ensure the end result was accessible to all communities.\"]","href_hash":"ed4f867880a011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ed4f867880a011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
