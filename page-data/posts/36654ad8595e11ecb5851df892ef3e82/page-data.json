He was, after all, the man who wrote those feelings into a beautiful \\u201cCompany\\u201d song \\u2014 \\u201cSorry-Grateful\\u201d \\u2014 and, in so doing, introduced ambivalence at an almost cellular level to the American musical theater.\", \"But let\\u2019s face it, the revival that opened on Thursday night at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater is not the \\u201cCompany\\u201d Sondheim and the book writer George Furth (along with the director Hal Prince) unleashed on Broadway in 1970. Sure, the score remains great, and there are a few perfectly etched performances in supporting roles, especially Patti LuPone\\u2019s as the undermining, pickled Joanne.\", \"As directed by Marianne Elliott, however, in a gender-flipped version abetted by Sondheim himself, what was once the story of a man who is terrified of intimacy becomes something much less interesting: the story of a woman who is justifiably tired of her friends.\", \"That woman \\u2014 now Bobbie instead of Bobby, and played by the winsome Katrina Lenk \\u2014 no longer hears the busy signal of missed emotional connections that pulsed through the songs in their original incarnation. This time, what accompanies her as she studies five partnerships and samples three lovers is the ticking of a biological clock.\", \"Reframed that way, and with heaps of oversize symbolic baggage piled on top, the story comes to seem overwrought and incoherent. Gone is the affirmative lesson Bobbie learns from the smothering couples attending her 35th birthday party \\u2014 a milestone she\\u2019d rather ignore. Instead, as if to prove that \\u201cCompany\\u201d loves misery, this production drags her off the pedestal of her aloofness and into the mud of a long, dark night of the soul. At one point she vomits into a bucket.\", \"Not that coherence was ever the material\\u2019s strong point. From the start, critics complained about a main character who seemed dangerously recessive, observing other people\\u2019s foibles in loosey-goosey comic sketches that barely added up. No wonder: They started life as separate one-act plays.\", \"In one of those sketches, the low-level friction between a husband and wife erupts in a jiu-jitsu match; in another, the apparently perfect shine of marital bliss turns out to be the glow of impending divorce. A third couple learns the meaning of devotion while smoking pot; a fourth couple \\u2014 now configured as two gay men \\u2014 experiences hiccups on the way to the altar.\", \"Still, as strung together by Sondheim\\u2019s diamantine songs, \\u201cCompany\\u201d offered a groundbreaking way of looking at its subject, less through a microscope than a kaleidoscope. Sarcasm warming into insight was the hallmark of the style, which borrowed the nonrepresentational techniques of midcentury drama and wed it to a psychological acuity rarely before seen in American musicals. The result was a new method of storytelling in which thematic consistency trumped conventional plot \\u2014 and nearly obliterated it.\", \"Though fascinating in theory, and worth considering as a way of reorienting the original\\u2019s outdated sexual politics, Elliott\\u2019s idea that the material could be regendered for a new era completely disrupts that consistency. Aside from Sondheim\\u2019s customized new lyrics, only a few of the alterations made to accommodate the thesis scan. One involves the gay couple, Jamie (formerly Amy) and Paul. For them, getting married really is the terrifying unknown described in the showstopping, tongue-twisting \\u201cGetting Married Today.\\u201d Explaining his decision to cancel the ceremony, Jamie (Matt Doyle) says, in a line that\\u2019s been added: \\u201cJust because we can doesn\\u2019t mean we should.\\u201d\", \"That moment rings true. But when Bobbie takes advantage of Jamie\\u2019s jitters to suggest that he marry her instead of Paul, she doesn\\u2019t seem needy or wolfish, as Bobby did when propositioning Amy; she seems foolish and disrespectful. That Lenk fails to make sense of the moment is not her fault. There are no lines or logic that would allow her to do so.\", \"Even more flummoxing is the scene in which, as originally written, Joanne, tired of Bobby\\u2019s passivity, and perhaps her own, suggests they have an affair. Short of turning Joanne into a lesbian, which might have been more interesting, Elliott has little choice but to turn her into a pimp, goading Bobbie to \\u201cmake it\\u201d with her husband, Larry. Perhaps if Larry were not a tertiary character, barely fleshed out in Furth\\u2019s script, this might not seem like a directorial hail-Mary pass.\", \"Yet it\\u2019s amazing what a little LuPone can do to distract from such things. Whether swinging her legs like a mischievous child or squatting on a toilet \\u2014 yes, Elliott\\u2019s staging goes there \\u2014 she brings her precision comedy and riveting charisma to every moment she\\u2019s onstage. Her two big numbers, \\u201cThe Little Things You Do Together\\u201d and \\u201cThe Ladies Who Lunch,\\u201d both left pretty much alone, are uncommonly taut and specific.\", \"Too bad that Lenk, so beguiling in \\u201cThe Band\\u2019s Visit\\u201d and \\u201cIndecent,\\u201d is not as lucky, both miscast and mishandled. Bobby\\u2019s transformation into Bobbie has been accomplished at the cost of a few ribs, turning the character into a rag doll. Unable to meet the dramatic and vocal demands of the role, Lenk seems merely pummeled by it. To be fair, Elliott\\u2019s staging, full of athletic busywork and \\u201cAlice in Wonderland\\u201d contortions of scale on Bunny Christie\\u2019s almost too-fascinating set, is quite a workout. Maybe that\\u2019s why Christie, who also designed the costumes, has oddly given Lenk plain white sneakers to wear with her dressy scarlet pantsuit.\", \"But in trying to disguise the show\\u2019s revue-like structure by centering the action in Bobbie\\u2019s mind, Elliott paradoxically causes her to recede even further than usual. (At one point she brings on a battalion of Bobbies, as if to compensate.) In response, you become uncommonly grateful for secondary characters who have clear things to do and do them smartly, like Jennifer Simard as the jiu-jitsu wife and Claybourne Elder as a himbo flight attendant.\", \"Eventually, though, the show runs out of distractions.\", \"Sondheim was collaborative to a fault; it\\u2019s no contradiction that he hotly resented criticism of Furth\\u2019s work on \\u201cCompany\\u201d and yet (after initial skepticism) eagerly endorsed Elliott\\u2019s renovations. \\u201cWhat keeps theater alive is the chance always to do it differently,\\u201d he told The Times shortly before his death. This was no mere bromide; Sondheim allowed a masterpiece like \\u201cSweeney Todd\\u201d to be cut to ribbons for Tim Burton\\u2019s film and saw the cult flop \\u201cMerrily We Roll Along\\u201d through more surgeries than Frankenstein\\u2019s monster.\", \"In that sense, this \\u201cCompany\\u201d is perfectly in line with his intentions: It\\u2019s new. And truth be told, I was never less than riveted \\u2014 if usually in the way Bobby is, eyeballing messy marriages. Nor is the chance to hear the great score live with a 14-piece orchestra to be taken lightly; is there a more exciting opening number than the title song?\", \"So I guess I\\u2019m sorry-grateful. Sorry for not liking this version of \\u201cCompany\\u201d better \\u2014 and grateful to Sondheim for providing the chance to find out.\"]","href_hash":"36654ad8595e11ecb5851df892ef3e82"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"36654ad8595e11ecb5851df892ef3e82"}},
