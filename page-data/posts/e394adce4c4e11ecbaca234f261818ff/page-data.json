This is something that Joseph McCarthy did to a lot of people in America, and it turned out some of the people he was targeting are actually guilty.\", \"\\\"We talk about January 6, this is even worse than what Joseph McCarthy did. And I believe he went too far,\\\" Jones added.\", \"\\\"This is the absolute declaration of war against the American people and against free speech. They don't even care in this committee that I was there at the Capitol trying to stop what happened?\", \"\\\"No, they want to basically put me on trial in the corporate media, showing selective information so that when people hear the name Alex Jones, they think we're talking about an insurrectionist criminal when I am the opposite.\\\"\", \"It is unclear if Jones intends on complying with the subpoena issued against him. Steve Bannon was criminally charged with contempt of congress after he failed to turn over any documents when requested by the committee while citing Trump's \\\"executive privilege\\\" argument.\", \"In a statement announcing the subpoena, committee Chairman Bennie G. Thompson said Jones reportedly helped organize the rally at the Ellipse on January 6 that immediately preceded the attack on the Capitol and also helped raise around eighty percent of its funding.\", \"A letter from the Select committee to Jones noted that the conspiracy theorist was recorded urging people not to be violent on January 6.\", \"Jones did not end up speaking at the January 6 rally, but claimed that White House officials told him that he was to lead a march from the rally at the Ellipse to the Capitol, where Trump would speak.\", \"While Trump never came to the Capitol, the committee said the location where Jones told people to wait for him coincided with where Ali Alexander obtained a permit to hold a \\\"Stop the Steal\\\" rally that day.\", \"\\\"Mr. Jones has repeatedly promoted unsupported allegations of election fraud, including encouraging individuals to attend the Ellipse rally on January 6th and implying he had knowledge about the plans of the former President with respect to the rally,\\\" Thompson said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938388/alex-jones-capitol.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Alex Jones, the founder of right-wing media group Infowars, addresses a crowd of pro-Trump protesters after they storm the grounds of the Capitol Building on January 6, 2021 in Washington, D.C</div>\"]","href_hash":"e394adce4c4e11ecbaca234f261818ff"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e394adce4c4e11ecbaca234f261818ff"}},
