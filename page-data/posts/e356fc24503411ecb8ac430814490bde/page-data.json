She was later enrolled in an art school where she was the only Black student. In secondary school, she won a national youth art award and went on to study printmaking at the Michaelis School of Fine Art at the University of Cape Town.\", \"Ms. Kavula, now 29, is making her debut at Art Basel Miami Beach with \\u201csewedi sewedi\\u201d (Sewedi was her mother\\u2019s maiden name), an expansion of her first solo exhibition that was held earlier this year at the Cape Town outpost of Smac Gallery, which represents her. The work, made from shweshwe \\u2014 a printed cotton fabric \\u2014 crosses printmaking with weaving and sculpting.\", \"\\u201cPersonally, it\\u2019s my kind of therapy,\\u201d Ms. Kavula said, adding that the show was inspired by a dress of her mother\\u2019s that was given to her by her great-grandmother. \\u201cThere is an element of you\\u2019ve got to be present so no matter what is going on, you have to demand a stillness.\\u201d\", \"That demand of reflection and stillness \\u2014 from both artist and viewer \\u2014 is the reason a number of galleries are presenting works created with or inspired by textiles and craft during Art Basel Miami Beach and other satellite fairs this week.\", \"At Art Basel, Aninat Galeria de Arte of Santiago, Chile, is presenting textile techniques by three prominent Latin American female artists: Patricia Belli of Nicaragua and Catalina Swinburn and M\\u00f3nica Bengoa, who are both Chilean. Meanwhile, Proyectos Ultravioleta of Guatemala City and Von Bartha of Basel, Switzerland, will showcase the work of another Chilean artist, Felipe Mujica, who has collaborated with textile artists from countries including Mexico, China, Brazil and Norway to produce his fabric curtains.\", \"A more conceptual textile piece, \\u201cHarlem Quilt\\u201d (1997), by a Harlem-born Canadian artist, June Clark, will be highlighted by Toronto\\u2019s Daniel Faria Gallery while at Untitled Art\\u2019s Miami Beach edition, Gallery 1957 of Ghana will focus on Serge Attukwei Clottey\\u2019s textiles made with duct tape that are then superimposed over photography.\", \"All this fusion between applied and contemporary art is impossible to miss. Mr. Faria said the people who traditionally had worked in textiles and crafts \\u2014 including women, minorities and Indigenous people \\u2014 in the past were often left out of the contemporary art canon.\", \"\\u201cThere has been a shift recently where it has been this broadening up of voices and perspectives that before it was a very straight line of what art history was and continued to be,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand there\\u2019s been this kind of exploding of our understanding of that.\\u201d\", \"Applied arts like sewing, quilting, embroidery, weaving and knitting have historically been seen in the sphere of domestic practices, and for years they were not given their due by the upper echelons of the art world. However, Iliya Fridman, whose gallery will be presenting textile works of the pioneering \\u201cassemblage quilting\\u201d artist and civil rights activist Dindga McCannon at Art Basel Miami Beach, wrote in an email that the definition of fine art had \\u201cgrown to include forms of expression traditional to \\u2018women\\u2019s work.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Artists like Ms. Belli, who is a sculptor as well as a textile artist, have helped to push that boundary of recognition. Her tangled fabric of used clothing examines the expectations that have historically been put on women.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m thinking about the patriarchy and the role of women,\\u201d she said during a video interview, \\u201cand how these duties and obligations are interpreted by us women, by my mother, as a source of meaning and joy of her space in life.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Mujica\\u2019s work, meanwhile, is to \\u201cdirect the conversation\\u201d toward the domesticity of the production of his curtains. \\u201cI think fabric is a tremendous subject and material,\\u201d he wrote in an email. He added that different cultures in a variety of ways reflected the role that textiles play in everyday life and that his work was learning \\u201cto incorporate these different paths\\u201d and situations.\", \"In the 19th-century quilts shared coded messages with passengers on the Underground Railroad, something that inspired the Los Angeles-based artist David O. Alekhuogie to create draped fabric wall sculptures that the Yancey Richardson Gallery of New York will be presenting in Miami.\", \"Another New York gallery, Nicelle Beauchene, will be showing four works by Mattie Ross (1903-97) and Rachel Carey George (1908-2011), two quilters from Gee\\u2019s Bend, Ala. These works date from the 1960s, around the time of the civil rights movement. A number of Gee\\u2019s Bend quilters were a part of the Freedom Quilting Bee where, said Ms. Beauchene, \\u201cthey would meet, they would plan their protests and their marches, they would gossip, they would sing.\\u201d She added that \\u201cso much amazing history\\u201d was happening \\u201cwhen these quilts were being made.\\u201d\", \"Meanwhile, Ms. Clark emigrated to Canada in 1968 and did not return to Harlem until she did a residency at the Studio Museum almost 30 years later. Her installation, while not a traditional quilt, uses over 200 scraps of fabric from secondhand clothes she procured at Goodwill. Each piece is overlaid with photographs that she took at waist level.\", \"\\u201cMy mother taught me how to sew, and I began my adult life making clothes,\\u201d Ms. Clark said during a video interview. \\u201cI found committing imagery to any and every piece of fabric was an incredibly satisfying feeling for me.\\u201d\", \"Like Ms. Clark \\u2014 and Ms. Kavula \\u2014 Mr. Attukwei Clottey said he understood why a lot of artists were working in textiles at the moment. Fabric, he said, is \\u201cpart of our celebration as humans\\u201d and it is \\u201csomething that represents who we are.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e356fc24503411ecb8ac430814490bde"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e356fc24503411ecb8ac430814490bde"}},
