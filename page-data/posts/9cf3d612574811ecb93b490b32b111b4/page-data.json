They fell into an argument. Mr. Simmons was 17, set to graduate from high school in three weeks.\", \"The argument escalated, and as he would later tell authorities, he thought he saw a gun. He drew his own. In a flash, one person lay mortally wounded and another injured. Mr. Simmons was convicted of first- and second-degree assault, as well as criminal possession of a weapon. En route to Coxsackie Correctional Facility, he felt a grimly familiar narrative close around him: another poor young Black man in handcuffs.\", \"\\u201cOnce you\\u2019re arrested as a young person, it\\u2019s like a pathway,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Simmons spent 15 years in prison. Since 2014, he\\u2019s been a free man \\u2014 one whose trajectory was dramatically rerouted not once, but twice. As a reader and writer in prison, and then the first graduate \\u2014 summa cum laude \\u2014 of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice\\u2019s Prison-to-College Pipeline program, he broke free of that dark narrative. In the years since, he\\u2019s devoted himself to rewriting it altogether.\", \"At 40, Mr. Simmons has been named a 2017 David Rockefeller Fund Fellow, a 2019 Soros Justice Fellow, a Senior Atlantic Fellow and vice chair of the Canary Impact Fund. He\\u2019s a father now, too, and he\\u2019s made it his mission to remake not just his own life, but to change the educational and career opportunities afforded to incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people, and the way society thinks about that population in the first place. (The following interview has been edited and condensed.)\", \"What were you like as a kid?\", \"I always thought I was a good kid. I wanted to go to college, though not for the right reasons \\u2014 I wanted to sell weed to white boys. But I was a good kid, didn\\u2019t want to do harm to anyone.\", \"I\\u2019d say I got a passion for education when I was young, because my mom used her work address so I could go to a better school rather than in our own district in Harlem, which was horrible. I got to leave the neighborhood every morning to go to school. I saw all the great architecture, saw there was another world, two train stops away.\", \"What was that first year in prison like?\", \"I got my G.E.D. my first year, but there was no higher education after that, because of the [1994] crime bill, which canceled Pell grants for people in prison. So I just started reading. I don\\u2019t think I ever read an entire book until prison. I began to read autobiographies. \\u201cThe Autobiography of Malcolm X.\\u201d I was trying to see a world outside prison.\", \"I was starting to change. I would take new words and try to use them \\u2014 I\\u2019d be in the yard and be like, \\u201cWhy you so loquacious?\\u201d\", \"What was it like trying to change while also serving time?\", \"Reading a lot of books helped with that. I went to South Africa in my head before I actually went there, years later.\", \"I had to be really intentional about what I thought about, and talked about. I had to not engage with who got stabbed last week, or who\\u2019s selling drugs. Those thoughts aren\\u2019t positive. I was trying to have a positive mind-set.\", \"What did you think when you heard about the Prison-to-College Pipeline program?\", \"It was intimidating \\u2014 I hadn\\u2019t been in a school setting for 12 years. But I was already litigating, because I had to file for my appeal. Being a jailhouse lawyer kept me sharp academically.\", \"A lot of people in jail or prison have to learn the law as a means of representing themselves \\u2014 writing briefs, submitting motions. But when they come out, they\\u2019re not able to utilize those skills. It\\u2019s a missed opportunity for us as a society.\", \"What was it like pivoting from prison life to student life?\", \"Being a student gave me agency. Like before, if I was just a parolee complaining about stop-and-frisk, people would be like \\u201cchill out.\\u201d But if I said those same things in school, as a student, I\\u2019d be commended for it, and it\\u2019s considered critical thinking.\", \"Do you remember your first day out?\", \"The day of my release I was shot twice and left for dead \\u2014 it was the guy involved in what sent me away back in 1999. You\\u2019d think it\\u2019d be the greatest day of my life, but it didn\\u2019t turn out that way. I stayed in the hospital about a week, got a plate in my right arm.\", \"I think the world anticipated me focusing on the shooting. I chose to focus on school instead. I had a special pen that would record the lecture, because I couldn\\u2019t write. I decided it\\u2019s up to me to choose my narrative. Is it that I was shot immediately upon my release? Or is it graduating summa cum laude, and trying to change the criminal legal system?\", \"How did the world respond to you in general?\", \"You\\u2019ve got to find a way to reinvent yourself and promote yourself to the world.\", \"But there\\u2019s a stigma. For a long time, for example, any application for school, housing, a job, you needed to check the box saying you\\u2019re formerly incarcerated. The disenfranchisement pushes a lot of people into the informal market \\u2014 selling drugs, for example.\", \"That\\u2019s why I\\u2019m trying to change not just the education opportunities for formerly incarcerated people, but public perception. That stigma \\u2014 it shouldn\\u2019t be that a bad choice you make at 15 follows you the rest of your life.\", \"What\\u2019s it like being asked about what got you arrested?\", \"There\\u2019s a dignity piece. I wasn\\u2019t a bad kid. I was in a bad situation. It\\u2019s definitely part of my journey, but I don\\u2019t feel it speaks to who I am today. I\\u2019d hope people would reassess whether that information is actually relevant to how they understand me today.\", \"What\\u2019s your focus now?\", \"I cocreated the Paralegal Pathways Initiative, at Columbia Law School, to help those jailhouse lawyers find a way into the legal field. It\\u2019s a 14-week training course that teaches tech skills, legal ethics, soft communication skills, a little legal history \\u2014 all the basics that would allow you to be a paralegal. After the course, our participants either get a fellowship or job placement, or move on to law school.\", \"I\\u2019m also trying to create more pipeline programs like John Jay\\u2019s around the world. As global ambassador for the Incarceration Nations Network, I\\u2019ve traveled to South Africa, Cuba, Jamaica and the U.K. I\\u2019m also working to change thinking about parole, too. I\\u2019d also love to help law firms diversify better, too. I wear a variety of hats.\", \"What does the future look like for you?\", \"That\\u2019s challenging for formerly incarcerated people. I struggle with that. I try to live in the moment. I would love to continue the work I\\u2019m doing. And maybe one day I\\u2019ll write a book or do a documentary. But I\\u2019m always cognizant that tomorrow is not promised.\", \"Any words of wisdom you\\u2019d like to share?\", \"I try to contribute to rewriting my eulogy every day. I think I got that out of \\u201cThe 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.\\u201d\", \"Also, I\\u2019ve come to the realization that people are flawed. That got me to learn empathy over the years.\", \"What is your takeaway from your experience?\", \"I\\u2019m blessed. The universe wasn\\u2019t supposed to let me live to see 40. I\\u2019m a formerly incarcerated person and I can never take that away. But if I can use my platform to create change, that\\u2019s a blessing.\", \"We\\u2019re looking for people who decide that it\\u2019s never too late to switch gears, change their life and pursue dreams. Should we talk to you or someone you know? Share your story here.\"]","href_hash":"9cf3d612574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9cf3d612574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}},
