Gupta described the assessment as a screening test for dementia.\", \"Gupta, who is also an associate professor of neurosurgery at Emory University, added that some medical professionals have pushed for basic cognitive tests to be more readily done at age 65. President Biden turns 79 on Saturday and is the oldest serving president in U.S. history.\", \"However, despite the concerns of some conservatives, Gupta corroborated Dr. O'Connor's report that the president was healthy and fit for office.\", \"The six-page report went into more details on the president's condition, and stated that while he was fit to serve, he did have a number of minor issues that commonly afflict people his age.\", \"This includes atrial fibrillation, gastric reflux, and seasonal allergies. The report also stated that Biden has a bit of a \\\"stiffened gait,\\\" mostly as a result of a number of orthopedic injuries over the years and a broken foot in November 2020.\", \"While no cognitive assessment was performed on the president, Dr. O'Connor said that he performed a detailed neurologic exam to check for central nervous disorders such as Parkinson's disease or a stroke. This exam did not reveal any significant findings, O'Connor added.\", \"Physical examination results are typically released by presidents throughout their time in office.\", \"Despite the report, many Republicans continue to call into question Biden's mental acuity, and some have mockingly called him Dementia Joe.\", \"However, despite these concerns, a study from the University of Michigan found that only one in seven Americans over the age of 70 suffer from dementia, about 14 percent of that demographic.\", \"A recent Politico poll stated that 48 percent of Americans were reportedly concerned with Biden's cognition. This poll was released days prior to the president's public health report.\", \"Trump saw similar statistics with regards to his mental stability in 2018.\"]","href_hash":"b58a307049b511ec8f9d4b5c26f627d4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b58a307049b511ec8f9d4b5c26f627d4"}},
