Four years later, they became husband and wife.\", \"The two had become acquainted in 2016, through the local improv scene. \\u201cWe really loved the comedy chemistry we had, which turned into friendship,\\u201d said Ms. Blair, who goes by Rosey. Sometime after their performance as a married couple, though, things got a little flirty while the two were hanging out one evening, and Mr. Hardaway kissed her. A first date, which included sushi and a burlesque show, soon followed.\", \"\\u201cIf you ever wonder if the man you\\u2019re going out with is a gentleman, take him to a burlesque show and see how well behaved he is,\\u201d Ms. Blair said. \\u201cNeedless to say, Houston was perfect.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Blair, 33, a Dallas native, writes a blog about plus-size fashion, Roseybeeme, and is a social media influencer with some 176,000 followers on Instagram and 252,000 followers on TikTok.

Mr. Hardaway proposed to Ms. Blair outside of Parliament, the local bar where, he said, \\u201cwe both agree was the location we had started to catch feelings for one another. I took her on a walk around the block and got on one knee. Rosey ugly cried.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Hardaway said he had felt \\u201ca self-imposed pressure to make our proposal as cinematically romantic as possible,\\u201d and that he spent weeks trying to identify the \\u201cperfect\\u201d moment to ask Ms. Blair to marry him. \\u201cI carried around the ring in my pocket for probably a month before proposing, waiting for that magic moment.\\u201d\", \"[Click here to binge read this week\\u2019s featured couples.]\", \"But he eventually realized that what was most important to him was the two of them. \\u201cThat night, I stuffed the ring in my pocket and decided no matter what happened this was the night I was proposing,\\u201d he said.\", \"They were married Nov. 20 at the Mason, a venue in Dallas\\u2019s Oak Cliff neighborhood, which is where they first declared their love for one another.
