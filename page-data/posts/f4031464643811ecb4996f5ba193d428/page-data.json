His office said this was an operational question for OT and the first he knew of the agency's underspend was when RNZ approached him last week.\", \"Davidson said in a two-line statement: \\\"It is disappointing that that the total allocated has yet to be spent, however it is important that we ensure we have the right capacity to deliver this specialist work.\\\"\", \"M\\u0101ori are particularly hard hit by the service shortages, her Cabinet report said.\", \"It stated that ministers were collectively accountable for the overall outcomes of the joint venture which aimed to eliminate family and sexual violence.\", \"The government's national anti-violence strategy launched this month and will be implemented by the joint venture of 10 core agencies and Davidson said it \\\"sets up accountability to work towards the goal of workforce and community capacity\\\".\", \"A new board of public service chief executives would create \\\"greater accountability\\\", she said.\", \"The new board replaces the old board set up in 2018 to oversee the joint venture.

That required at least four staff per provider, it said.\", \"Its solution is to get regional providers to tap into the 'Safe to Talk - Korero mai ka ora' service.\", \"The cost of sexual violence to the country has been estimated to be $7 billion a year, and with child abuse costing the country $4b.\", \"Demand for services was rising as they became more accessible, the Cabinet report said. Some providers had been able to hire more people, or get more phones, laptops or cars.\", \"\\\"The workforce increase has meant the workload is shared between staff to avoid stress and burnout. Reduced caseloads are allowing support workers to spend more time with service users.\\\"\", \"By shifting to longer, four-year contracts, the funding had cut anxiety about poor job security, it said.\", \"The joint venture had hired 14 independent advisers to help design services.
