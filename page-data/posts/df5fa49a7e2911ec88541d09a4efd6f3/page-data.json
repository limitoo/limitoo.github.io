It was the first time the N.F.L. had suspended a coach, and it cost Payton more than $7 million, while the team was fined $500,000 and lost two second-round draft picks.\", \"Payton, 58, also butted heads with the league in 2019 after the Saints lost the N.F.C. championship game, in part because the referees failed to call what appeared to be defensive pass interference on Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman. That off-season, Payton successfully lobbied other teams to make pass interference a reviewable play.\", \"He had been a member of the league\\u2019s competition committee, which reviews rules, technology, game-day operations and player protection, since 2017, but he stepped down from the group this season.\", \"Payton made eight trips to the postseason, compiling a 9-8 record, including a victory over the Indianapolis Colts in Super Bowl XLIV. His departure adds the Saints to the list, now nine franchises long, of teams searching for new head coaches. Most of the other teams fired their coaches weeks ago, giving them a head start on interviewing replacements.\", \"According to NFL Network, Saints defensive coordinator Dennis Allen is the leading candidate to take over for Payton, and Aaron Glenn, the defensive coordinator for the Lions who coached in New Orleans under Payton from 2016 to 2020, may also be interviewed.\", \"Payton\\u2019s departure, which comes a year after Brees\\u2019s retirement, throws into flux the balance of power in the N.F.C. South, which the Saints have dominated for years. The future of quarterback Tom Brady\\u2019s tenure with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers only adds to the uncertainty.\", \"It is unclear whether Payton is retiring from coaching, or if he is taking time off before finding another assignment. Payton\\u2019s name was been floated as a potential coach of the Dallas Cowboys, for whom he was an assistant head coach and quarterbacks coach from 2003 to 2005, when Bill Parcells led the team. \", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what\\u2019s next,\\u201d Payton said, addressing his future. \\u201cI don\\u2019t like the word retirement. I still have a vision for doing things in football, and I\\u2019ll be honest, it might be in coaching. It might be, but it\\u2019s not where my heart is right now.\\u201d\", \"Payton said he would be staying in the New Orleans area.\", \"Payton\\u2019s departure leaves a big hole to fill for the team\\u2019s owner, Gayle Benson. Payton called the offensive plays on the sideline and was involved in nearly every aspect of the team\\u2019s football operations, working closely with general manager Mickey Loomis and Dennis Lauscha, the president of both the Saints and the N.B.A.\\u2019s Pelicans.\", \"Payton helped turned around a largely moribund franchise that had only seven winning seasons before he took over as coach in 2006, the same year that Brees arrived as a free agent from the San Diego Chargers, and a year after New Orleans was devastated by Hurricane Katrina.\", \"\\u201cWe took a chance on Drew at the time because we weren\\u2019t going to win any jump balls,\\u201d Payton said. \\u201cIn other words, we had to be overly aggressive.\\u201d\", \"Brees immediately became the centerpiece of the team and reeled off 12 consecutive seasons with 4,000 or more passing yards. He and Payton won 10 games and made the postseason in their first year together, and by 2009, after recording a 13-3 record in the regular season, won the team\\u2019s first and only Super Bowl title, which became symbolic of the city\\u2019s recovery.\", \"With Brees gone, the Saints were not nearly as explosive this season, finishing 9-8 and failing to make the playoffs. Because of injuries, Payton was forced to use four different quarterbacks, who collectively could not muster the statistics that Brees compiled even in his weakest years.\", \"Payton played one season as a quarterback with the Chicago Bears in 1987.\"]","href_hash":"df5fa49a7e2911ec88541d09a4efd6f3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"df5fa49a7e2911ec88541d09a4efd6f3"}},
