The president used the opportunity to celebrate the passage of his bipartisan infrastructure package, emphasize the importance of voting rights and encourage Americans to get their shots.\", \"\\u201cThe bottom line is that the way to avoid the virus is to get two shots and then get the booster shot,\\u201d Mr. Biden told Mr. Fallon. He added that if more people listened to the song that Mr. Fallon created with the singer Ariana Grande and Megan Thee Stallion, \\u201cIt was a \\u2026 Masked Christmas,\\u201d it would help combat vaccine hesitancy.\", \"Mr. Biden shared a link to the song on Twitter earlier on Friday with the message, \\u201c\\u2019Tis the season (to get boosted).\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt is really important,\\u201d Mr. Biden said of the booster shots, noting that teenagers and young people were now eligible to be vaccinated. \\u201cWe\\u2019re moving, we\\u2019re moving.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden also took the opportunity to take a slight shot at the partisan divisions that have become the norm in Congress, after Mr. Fallon said that he saw Democrats and Republicans cordially socializing at the 44th Kennedy Center Honors on Sunday.\", \"\\u201cI saw Republicans and Democrats in the crowd \\u2014 everyone\\u2019s laughing at jokes and listening to great music, and everyone seemed cordial and nice and I go, This seems like it should be much easier to get along with everybody,\\u201d Mr. Fallon said.\", \"Mr. Biden then noted a reason he was tardy for his taped interview was because he was at the funeral of former Senator Bob Dole, a former Republican presidential nominee who the president eulogized earlier in the day as a blunt leader willing to work across the aisle.\", \"\\u201cHe asked me on his deathbed whether I would do his eulogy,\\u201d Mr. Biden said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re friends. We disagree, but we\\u2019re friends. We used to have an awful lot of that relationship and it still exists.\\u201d\", \"The president then said the extremist views displayed by some members of the Republican Party had eroded some of that bipartisanship.\", \"Mr. Biden has appeared on Mr. Fallon\\u2019s show twice before, both in September 2016, toward the end of his time as vice president and again in 2020, in an interview that took on a much more serious tone during the spread of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Biden, who as president will often add emphasis during his speeches or interviews with mentions of \\u201cThat\\u2019s not hyperbole\\u201d and \\u201cIt\\u2019s not a joke,\\u201d has shown a willingness to joke around a bit on late-night shows.\", \"Mr. Biden told Mr. Fallon how his family was not used to having every meal made for them in the White House and that he reached an agreement with \\u201cthe guys who run the kitchen\\u201d that the first family would make breakfast for themselves.\", \"\\u201cYou make your own eggs?\\u201d Mr. Fallon asked.\", \"\\u201cWell, I don\\u2019t \\u2014 Jill does,\\u201d Mr. Biden said, referring to the first lady of the United States.\", \"Mr. Biden also foreshadowed some of his forthcoming goals during the appearance on the show. When asked what he hoped he would be talking about this time next year, he said he hoped he would be celebrating his administration getting the pandemic under control, even as the rise of the Delta variant this summer factored into his dwindling approval ratings. He added that he was focused on putting in effect more measures to combat climate change.\", \"And Mr. Biden said that he hoped to pass legislation that would preserve the right to vote, something he acknowledged during a CNN town hall in October that had not received his full attention while he tried to secure enough votes to pass his infrastructure and social spending packages.\", \"Mr. Biden said the Republican attempts to restrict voting rights in more than a dozen states was \\u201cliterally un-American.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Fallon has issued playful jabs at Mr. Biden on his show as recently as last week, when the host played a clip of the president delivering the jobs report through a hoarse voice.\", \"\\u201cThere he is, President Groot,\\u201d Mr. Fallon told his audience, referencing the beloved extraterrestrial tree alien from the \\u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\\u201d films.\"]","href_hash":"a34735bc5a4911ec86ef47d7d1a989ec"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a34735bc5a4911ec86ef47d7d1a989ec"}},
