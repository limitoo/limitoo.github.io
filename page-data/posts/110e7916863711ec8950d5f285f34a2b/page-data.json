One is obviously from a UK consumer perspective, they have been brought up on this product and the knowledge that's come from here, and it's very important to protect that. The other side of the coin is that other honeys have been using the name m\\u0101nuka when in fact the honey is not m\\u0101nuka.\", \"\\\"The second is about New Zealand's position, it's on the way to becoming a billion-dollar industry annually so protecting the term is very critical.\\\"\", \"An application to trademark m\\u0101nuka is currently before the New Zealand Intellectual Property Office - a decision is expected early this year.\"]","href_hash":"110e7916863711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"110e7916863711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
