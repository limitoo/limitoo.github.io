Kevin Brobson, a Republican and a Commonwealth Court judge, defeated Maria McLaughlin, a Democrat and a Superior Court judge, in a fiercely contested race for a seat vacated by a Republican. The candidates raised more than $5 million, much from special interests.\", \"Unofficial tallies reported by the Pennsylvania Department of State showed Judge Brobson with about 52 percent of the vote.\", \"The election protected one of the two seats Republicans control on the seven-member court in Pennsylvania, which is one of a handful of states that elect rather than appoint their Supreme Court justices.\", \"While judicial races often fly under the radar, they are hugely consequential.\", \"In Pennsylvania over the past few years, the Supreme Court has redrawn the state\\u2019s congressional districts, throwing away a Republican gerrymander and contributing to Democrats\\u2019 net gain of four House seats there in 2018. It has also upheld an emergency declaration that enabled Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, to issue stay-at-home orders and other restrictions in response to the pandemic; allowed Pittsburgh to enact a paid sick leave law; and slapped down a Republican lawsuit seeking to invalidate mail-in ballots in the 2020 election.\", \"Given the persistence of efforts by former President Donald J.

The court is also expected to decide whether Pennsylvania\\u2019s Medicaid program must cover abortion without restrictions.\", \"Republicans also won judicial races in lower courts. Megan Sullivan beat Timika Lane, a Democrat, for a seat on the state\\u2019s Superior Court. Stacy Wallace, a Republican, finished first among four candidates for two seats on the Commonwealth Court. Another Republican, Drew Crompton, who was seeking a permanent seat on the court, was leading the two Democrats in that race.\"]","href_hash":"3f770c543ccd11ec8384000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3f770c543ccd11ec8384000017025a03"}},
