Police haven't released the motive for the shooting but announced on Wednesday they had arrested suspects Qadir Johnson and Kyair Garnett.\", \"An initial release from the Philadelphia District Attorney's office put Johnson as age 26 and Garnett as 21-years-old. However, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported Johnson is actually 21 years old. NBC News put his age at 20.\", \"Both men were charged with murder, conspiracy, violation of the uniform firearms act, possession of an instrument of crime, reckless endangerment, and tampering with evidence, according to NBC News. Garnett also has an outstanding bench warrant from Montgomery County and was charged with receipt of stolen property and unauthorized use of an automobile.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944402/philadelphia-14-year-old-shot-arrest.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Philadelphia police arrested two men for the fatal shooting of 14-year-old Samir Jefferson.

He died shortly after arriving.\", \"Jefferson's death comes as Philadelphia grapples with one of its deadliest years for homicides and on Monday, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said her heart \\\"grieves\\\" for the victims, their families and the entire city.\", \"\\\"While we cannot bring back those lost, the Philadelphia Police Department will ensure that these cases are fully investigated so that these victims and their families receive closure and justice,\\\" Outlaw said.\", \"Police questioned two persons of interest on Monday, but it's unclear if Garnett and Johnson were those men.\", \"Philadelphia Police Deputy Commissioner Ben Nash said the department received help from the public that led to the arrests. He added that the \\\"terrible incident\\\" that occurred on Monday has been \\\"solved\\\" but that \\\"not everyone is in custody.\\\"\", \"Ahead of the shooting, Jefferson's family said he sent a video of a fight to someone on Instagram and police are looking into whether social media played a role in Jefferson's death.\", \"While police consider this case \\\"solved,\\\" Nash noted that they may never be able to put an end to the type of violence that led to the 14-year-old's death. He said the people who shot Jefferson were \\\"intentionally going to take a young man's life.\\\"\", \"Desiree Goodson, Jefferson's mom, told local news station WTXF that she isn't interested in \\\"justice\\\" or \\\"retaliation\\\" for her son's death because nothing will bring him back.\", \"\\\"Every time I close my eyes, I see my son.
