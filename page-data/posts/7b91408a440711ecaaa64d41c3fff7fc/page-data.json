The judge said there was enough evidence for the case to go to trial, the Associated Press reported.\", \"Willard Noble Chaiden Miller and Jeremy Everett Goodale, both 16, are accused of killing Nohema Graber, a 66-year-old Spanish teacher at Fairfield High School. Authorities have not revealed a possible motive or if she taught either of the suspects.\", \"She was reported missing Nov. 2 and her remains were found later that day at Chautauqua Park in Fairfield, where she's known to take her daily walks. Her body was found concealed under a tarp, wheelbarrow and railroad tires.\", \"Prosecutors in Fairfield filed documents containing charges against Miller and Goodale. Earlier court filings stated that Graber suffered \\\"inflected trauma to the head.\\\"\", \"According to the AP, police received a tip that Goodale posted details for plans about the killing on social media, according to court documents. The documents indicated police investigators found what appear to be blood-stained clothing at the teenager's homes.\", \"Documents also said Miller admitted to being at the park when Graber was killed, and to providing material used to kill and conceal her death.\", \"Miller and Goodale are held on $1 million bonds. Their arraignment date is set for Nov. 29.\", \" For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931821/murder-iowa-high-school-teacher.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">This undated photo provided by the Assistant Jefferson County Attorney, in Iowa, shows Jeremy Everett Goodale.

Previously set appearances for both teens were canceled for Friday.\", \"Records show minutes of testimony also were filed but kept sealed as allowed under Iowa law. The minutes typically outline a crime in detail significant enough for a judge to approve them and hold the defendants over for trial.\", \"Judge Joel Yates said he reviewed the information and the minutes of testimony and found \\\"they contain evidence which, if unexplained, is sufficient to warrant a conviction by a trial jury.\", \"\\\"Being satisfied from the showing made that the case should be prosecuted, I approve the trial information,\\\" he wrote.\", \"Attorneys for both have requested a hearing for bond reduction, which Yates has set for Nov. 23.\", \"An attorney for Goodale declined to comment on the charges, and an attorney for Miller did not immediately respond to messages.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931823/murder-iowa-high-school-teacher.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">This undated photo provided by the Assistant Jefferson County Attorney, in Iowa, shows Willard Noble Chaiden Miller.
