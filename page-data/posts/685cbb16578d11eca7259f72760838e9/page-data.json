Already, the video has racked up more than 27 million views and over 5 million likes.\", \"\\\"When you're [sic] husband comes home from work and you have a cow in the house,\\\" read the video's text overlay.\", \"The footage opened with Lane's husband walking through the front door, which is slightly ajar. The cow is sleeping behind the door and is visible to viewers, but cannot be seen by Lane's husband.\", \"\\\"Wait, stop right there,\\\" Lane tells her husband as he approached the door. \\\"You know I love you, right?\\\"\", \"Her husband, who at this point looks concerned, asks: \\\"What did you do?\\\"\", \"She calmly instructs him to step inside, before telling him that there is something behind their front door. As he steps around the door to see what she's hiding, Lane begins to laugh.\", \"\\\"Where the f**k did you get a g**damn cow?\\\" he asked incredulously. \\\"Whose cow?\\\"\", \"Through laughs, she said: \\\"It's my cow.\\\"\", \"He again asks: \\\"Where the f**k did you get a cow?\\\"\", \"She responded that she got the cow from \\\"Steve.\\\" According to a follow-up video, Steve is Lane's stepfather.\", \"Though the cow, named Oakley, is enjoying time inside Lane's home right now, she shared in the comments section of another video that she and her husband have \\\"4 acres and a barn,\\\" where the cow will soon live.\", \"In response to one concerned viewer who asked about \\\"potty training,\\\" Lane said that she takes Oakley out every 30 minutes to avoid any accidents.\", \"Interestingly enough, scientists recently discovered that it could be possible to \\\"potty-train\\\" cows.\", \"\\\"It's usually assumed that cattle are not capable of controlling defecation or urination,\\\" said Jan Langbein. However, \\\"cattle, like many other animals or farm animals are quite clever and they can learn a lot.\\\"\", \"The motivation behind training cows to use a latrine for urination comes from the desire to protect the environment.\", \"The ability to collect a cow's urine before certain chemical reactions take place could cut down on emissions.\", \"Viewers, of course, weren't overly concerned with Oakley's future bathroom schedule. Rather, they were hung up on Lane's husband's hilarious reaction to the whole surprise, as well as how adorable the cow is.\", \"\\\"The fact he's not upset that you HAVE the cow, but he's confused WHERE you got this cow,\\\" wrote jenny, followed by a laughing emoji.\", \"\\\"I love this video,\\\" said Casey Landerkin. \\\"He's not mad he's just confused.\\\"\", \"JESICAAAA added: \\\"I love him because he is like...amused, but not THAT surprised.\\\"\", \"\\\"I. Love. Everything. About. This,\\\" expressed OzzyGDavis.\", \"Sheriannbella commented: \\\"SO FREAKING ADORABLE.\\\"\", \"\\\"The cow is so cute,\\\" said Nice2strangers.\", \"Catluminati responded: \\\"New item added to my wishlist.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946995/cow.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A video that shows a woman surprising her husband with a pet cow has gone viral, and commenters are in hysterics over her husband\\u2019s reaction.
