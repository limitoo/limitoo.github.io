The incrementalist counsels patience: Something is better than nothing, half a loaf is better than none.\", \"Characteristically, Malcolm X wasn\\u2019t having any of that. In a televised round table in 1961, the civil rights lawyer Constance Baker Motley tried to coax Malcolm into acknowledging that the average Black American \\u201cis substantially better off than he was at the end of slavery.\\u201d He scorned the very premise. \\u201cNow you have 20 million Black people in America who are begging for some kind of recognition as human beings,\\u201d he said, referring to the Black Americans imprisoned at the time, \\u201cand the average white man today thinks we\\u2019re making progress.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s an evocative exchange, one that the Harvard legal historian Tomiko Brown-Nagin showcases to illuminating effect in \\u201cCivil Rights Queen,\\u201d the first major biography of Motley, a decade in the making. Brown-Nagin juxtaposes Motley\\u2019s attempts to find common ground by asking a series of lawyerly questions (\\u201cYou recognize, don\\u2019t you \\u2026? \\u201cDon\\u2019t you think \\u2026?\\u201d) with Malcolm\\u2019s scathing rejoinders. By the mid-1960s, Motley had been caught \\u201cin a bind,\\u201d Brown-Nagin writes. Working at the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., or Inc Fund, since 1946, she had been a crucial figure in using the courts to dismantle Jim Crow laws. Motley had helped litigate Brown v. Board of Education; she fought for Martin Luther King Jr.\\u2019s right to march in Birmingham. But to radicals disenchanted with the mainstream civil rights movement, she was \\u201cweak and accommodationist,\\u201d Brown-Nagin writes. Set against figures like Malcolm, \\u201cher politics and style looked tamer \\u2014 and they were.\\u201d\", \"Not that Motley was necessarily accepted wholeheartedly into the hallways of American power either. As Brown-Nagin shows in this thoughtful biography, Motley was lambasted by one side as \\u201ca pawn of the white establishment,\\u201d but she was sometimes criticized by elements of that white establishment for not being moderate enough.\", \"In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her to the Southern District of New York, making her the first Black woman to serve as a federal judge. She constantly faced doubts among those who presumed that her identity would make her biased. During her confirmation hearings, she was accused of being a Communist \\u2014 which was ironic, considering that as a judge Motley would regularly enforce the property rights of business owners. \\u201cIn her courtroom,\\u201d Brown-Nagin writes, \\u201cno less than in any other, larger corporate entities with greater resources \\u2014 big business \\u2014 prevailed.\\u201d\", \"The federal courthouse in Lower Manhattan was a world away from Motley\\u2019s childhood in New Haven, Conn., where she was born, the ninth child of 12, to parents who had immigrated from the Caribbean island of Nevis. Her father had found steady but humble work as a steward at Yale; her mother was a homemaker. Speaking at a community center, a 19-year-old Motley so impressed a local philanthropist that he paid for the rest of her education \\u2014 first at Nashville\\u2019s Fisk University, then at New York University and eventually at Columbia Law School.\", \"Motley would remember her experiences as a Black girl in Connecticut in stark contrast to what she later saw in the South. \\u201cFear and racial conflict were simply not a part of the landscape,\\u201d she recalled. Brown-Nagin, for her part, says that Motley clung to \\u201cone of the enduring yet long-contested myths about American race relations\\u201d \\u2014 that racism was primarily a Southern problem \\u2014 and \\u201cdownplayed the extent of racism in the North.\\u201d\", \"Brown-Nagin does this now and again \\u2014 providing an intermittent critique while recounting the story of an exceptional life that she manifestly admires. (Brown-Nagin\\u2019s previous book, the Bancroft Prize-winning \\u201cCourage to Dissent,\\u201d included a chapter on Motley.) It\\u2019s a judicious impulse that Motley, who wanted to be a lawyer from the time she was a high school student, might have appreciated \\u2014 though it can be hard to tell, since \\u201cCivil Rights Queen\\u201d isn\\u2019t quite an intimate biography. Brown-Nagin focuses mainly on Motley\\u2019s life in the courtroom, as both an attorney and a judge, with only an occasional glance at her personal life, which included a happy, supportive marriage and one child, a son.\", \"\\u201cCivil Rights Queen\\u201d is the result of diligent research; Brown-Nagin sifted through the literature, pored through the archives, talked to Motley\\u2019s clerks. We learn that when Motley interviewed with Thurgood Marshall, who was then special counsel to the Inc Fund, he asked her to climb a ladder next to a bookshelf because \\u201che wanted to inspect her legs and feminine form.\\u201d\", \"Brown-Nagin situates this incident (\\u201calleged,\\u201d she takes care to note) in terms of the ambient chauvinism of the time and Marshall\\u2019s reputation as a \\u201cRomeo\\u201d; the book as a whole offers little else by way of gossip or Motley\\u2019s own idiosyncrasies, beyond what Motley herself was willing to reveal in her memoir. (Published in 1998, that memoir doesn\\u2019t mention any specifics about the job interview, recalling only Marshall\\u2019s \\u201ctotal lack of formality\\u201d: \\u201cFor whatever reason, I don\\u2019t remember much else.\\u201d) Brown-Nagin repeatedly describes Motley as \\u201cstately,\\u201d \\u201csteely,\\u201d \\u201cstylishly dressed\\u201d \\u2014 as if her impeccable self-presentation was a form of armor, which Brown-Nagin suggests it was: \\u201cShe protected herself; only a select few could peek behind the mask.\\u201d\", \"Some of the most poignant episodes in the book recount the harrowing experiences of Motley and her clients in the South \\u2014 risking their lives in their persistent efforts to make the country measure up to its stated ideals. Brown-Nagin makes clear that Motley, like the other lawyers at the Inc Fund, had to be pragmatic to the point of ruthlessness, holding clients to the most scrupulous standards of the respectability politics of the time, casting aside anyone who might jeopardize a case. But Motley also counseled exhausted and frightened clients to persist, ensuring that all the hard work they had put in wouldn\\u2019t be in vain.\", \"The work was sometimes painful, and always painstaking; it was transformative for the country and formative for Motley. \\u201cCivil Rights Queen\\u201d is a balanced assessment of a brave and brilliant woman who helped to reconfigure the system before she became a part of it. Brown-Nagin ends by observing that, as a judge, Motley wasn\\u2019t the \\u201cgladiator\\u201d she once had been; she delivered a few \\u201cgroundbreaking\\u201d opinions, but was known mainly for her fairness and dedication. Reflecting on this \\u201cparadox of opportunity\\u201d for the outsider who becomes an insider, Brown-Nagin honors her subject by being resolutely direct and unsentimental \\u2014 steely, if you will. \\u201cThe power structure does not fundamentally transform,\\u201d she writes. \\u201cAt best, it accommodates difference.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"1042596c7e8f11ecb333d527d9987b77"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1042596c7e8f11ecb333d527d9987b77"}},
