It's a decision entirely at the discretion of Australia's immigration minister if deemed to be in the public interest for health and safety reasons.

Further questions also were raised about errors on his immigration form that could potentially result in the cancellation of his visa. \", \" On the form, Djokovic said he had not traveled in the 14 days before his flight to Australia, despite being seen in Spain and Serbia in that two-week period.\", \" Djokovic described recent commentary as \\\"hurtful\\\" and said he wanted to address it in the interest of \\\"alleviating broader concern in the community about my presence in Australia.\\\"\", \" The 34-year-old Serb said he'd taken rapid tests that were negative and he was asymptomatic before he received his positive result from an approved PRC test he undertook out of an \\\"abundance of caution\\\" after attending a basketball game in Belgrade on Dec. 14.\", \"He received the result late Dec. 17, he said, and scrapped all his commitments except the long-standing interview with L'Equipe.\", \" \\\"I felt obligated to go ahead ... but did ensure I socially distanced and wore a mask except when my photograph was being taken,\\\" Djokovic said. \\\"While I went home after the interview to isolate for the required period, on reflection, this was an error of judgment.\\\"\", \" He addressed the travel declaration by saying it was submitted by his support team and \\\"my agent sincerely apologizes for the administrative mistake in ticking the incorrect box.\\\"\", \" \\\"This was a human error and certainly not deliberate,\\\" he wrote. \\\"The team has provided additional information to the Australian Government to clarify this matter.\\\"\", \"There's growing concern in the community, meanwhile, with COVID-19 cases surging.\", \"The Omicron variant has swept across Australia despite its high vaccination rate and strict border policies that kept the country largely sealed off from the world for almost two years. \", \"Those measures turned Australia into a virtually COVID-19-free utopia at the start of the pandemic.
