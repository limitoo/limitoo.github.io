Two enormous volumes of plates, the size of 19th-century ledgers, and an accompanying almanac, \\u201cAnnals of the North\\u201d \\u2014 the dimensions of a hard-bound dictionary \\u2014 constitute this account of the Troubles in Northern Ireland, beginning in 1972 and extending past the end of the 20th century. Peress, from Paris, went to Derry as a young Magnum photographer, knowing little English; right away he witnessed the British Army\\u2019s massacre of 14 civilians in what became known as Bloody Sunday. Within a year, he had embedded himself so thoroughly that his photographs were often called upon as evidence in court. He developed ties with many people, sometimes tragically; one of his closest Republican friends turned out to be an informer and was killed by the I.R.A. It is clear from this work \\u2014 the title comes from the I.R.A.\\u2019s \\u201cGreen Book\\u201d \\u2014 that Peress left a chunk of his soul in Ulster. (Disclosure: Peress is my colleague at Bard College, although our paths seldom cross.)\", \"The plates are not organized chronologically but in 22 chapters that represent thematic \\u201cdays\\u201d \\u2014 \\u201cDay of Internment,\\u201d \\u201cDay of Roses,\\u201d \\u201cPrison Days\\u201d \\u2014 spanning the better part of two decades. The \\u201cProd\\u201d (Protestant) and \\u201cTaig\\u201d (Catholic) sides are represented evenly; Peress gives a clear measure of the ways the two seem to share a culture as well as being irreconcilably warring states. The pictures are immersively horizontal; they appear cinematic by virtue of their dimensions, size (14 inches by 9\\u00bd inches, with some at 28 inches across) and at least implied action. Peress\\u2019s photos are never at rest. Violence is always imminent if not present, and people are typically all headed in different directions; even his gravestones seem to be in motion. The vast sequence of images here, representing not a timeline but a series of existential crises that recur like rituals, that also play out in headlines, TV news footage and, above all, graffiti, rises in waves and recedes into choppiness, as capacious as a 19th-century novel but as indeterminate as an ocean.\", \"Catherine Opie is a portraitist of unusual poise, who accords her subjects the gravity of the nobles portrayed by Vel\\u00e1zquez or Holbein the Younger, while often maintaining direct eye contact that can read as sympathetic or conspiratorial, depending on who the subject is. She is best known for portraying what are often called sexual minorities \\u2014 trans people, butch lesbians, fetishists of diverse sorts \\u2014 and her stately presentations have done much to infuse dignity into their public perception.\", \"In CATHERINE OPIE (Phaidon, 337 pp., $150) those pictures are blended together with portraits of famous artists, surfers, domestic gay couples, high school football players and small children, with no discordance; they are all simply humans shown in full self-possession. The rest of the book highlights her landscapes, which range from misty ocean scenes to colorful slices of vernacular architecture to wide-screen views of mini-malls and highway flyovers. The latter are the strongest of her landscapes, with the highways in particular as wind-swept and epic and truncated as the legs of Ozymandias in Shelley\\u2019s poem.\", \"In 1977, Mike Mandel and the late Larry Sultan published their deeply influential \\u201cEvidence,\\u201d a collection of photographs culled from the archives of dozens of corporations and government agencies, selected for maximum strangeness and inadvertent art. Now, in ZONE ELEVEN (Damiani/D.A.P., 103 pp., $55), Mandel has done something parallel \\u2014 with the archives of Ansel Adams; the two books have similar formats and similar covers, down to the typeface. The quarry is obviously not inadvertent art, but pictures that few would guess were by Adams, known for his Western landscapes and advocacy of \\u201cpure\\u201d photography (the title refers to his \\u201czone system\\u201d for breaking down the tonal range of photographs). There is assignment work; a pinhole-camera experiment; a 1960s student theater production that seems to have reminded Adams of the actress Eleanora Duse; photos reminiscent of those of Walker Evans, Aaron Siskind, John Gutmann and the science photos that Berenice Abbott made late in her career; while the most affecting pictures, varied and emotional, were made in the 1940s at the Manzanar internment camp for Japanese Americans. Dating from all across his life, the photos usefully enlarge our view of Adams, showing that he could easily step away from his monolithic image.\", \"Mitch Epstein, more than most photographers, works like a nonfiction writer. He picks a subject, burrows deep inside it and emerges with a book; these projects have included works on Vietnam, power utilities, the trees of New York City and the end of his family\\u2019s hardware business. PROPERTY RIGHTS (Steidl/D.A.P., 285 pp., $75) can be regarded as a book of war photography, concerning the ongoing war in the United States waged by powerful forces against vulnerable citizens, and the resistance by those citizens. He documents, among other struggles, the resistance to the Dakota Access Pipeline at the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation; the resistance to the Atlantic Sunrise Pipeline in Lancaster County, Pa.; the resistance to the border wall and the murders of migrants, to the murders of Black people by the police, to the murders of Jewish people by antisemites, to environmental degradation and its resulting catastrophes.\", \"His photographs are always lucid and eloquent, and often very beautiful despite their grim subjects. There is no empty rhetoric here, neither in the photographs nor in the text Epstein wrote with Susan Bell, and none is needed. A sign in the South Dakota Black Hills reading \\u201cIndian Land\\u201d that has been shot full of holes, a section of border wall alongside stumps of cactuses at the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in Arizona, makeshift memorials to the fallen in Pittsburgh and Staten Island, the faces of protesters old and young on every front \\u2014 they carry the point that it is all one big struggle.\", \"Contrasting views of the subcontinent are presented by Epstein, in IN INDIA (Steidl/D.A.P., 144 pp., $65), and by the Belgian photographer Harry Gruyaert, in INDIA (Thames & Hudson, 203 pp., $65). Epstein\\u2019s pictures date from the 1970s and \\u201980s, when he was married to the filmmaker Mira Nair and spent a great deal of time in her home country. They show an oddly intimate and oddly secular country; you stand in the photographer\\u2019s shoes and see what he sees, in spaces to which he has been invited or at least admitted. These include private homes, a band rehearsal, a photo studio, a cabaret \\u2014 a dancer on a platform smokes a cigarette and wears a voluminous dress that looks as if it were made from some aerospace material. The people generally appear relaxed, either complicit with the photographer or indifferent to his presence. You begin to feel as if you might belong. Gruyaert, on the other hand, goes for pure strangeness and violent contrast, in pictures that range across the last quarter of the 20th century. It is sometimes unclear just what we are looking at. Are those women, or a collection of fabric swags? (A question that can apply to two very different pictures.) Where do the wall posters leave off and the flesh-and-blood people begin? Gruyaert\\u2019s India is crowded, vital, nonstop, pulsing with color and texture, and as remote from our tidy Western lives as if the photos had been taken two centuries ago.\", \"The struggles of the 1960s can be glimpsed, dramatically, in Leni Sinclair\\u2019s MOTOR CITY UNDERGROUND: Photographs 1963-1978 (Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit/Foggy Notion Books, 407 pp., $60), edited by Cary Loren and Lorraine Wild and with a contribution by Kristine McKenna. For many years Leni Sinclair was married to John Sinclair, a poet and jazz critic who by the end of the decade had become head of the White Panther Party, a Detroit-based attempt to forge a white working-class analogue to the Black Panthers. In the earlier \\u201960s, Sinclair and his friends wear suits, organize jazz events featuring various immortals \\u2014 John Coltrane, Cecil Taylor, Albert Ayler \\u2014 and march for civil rights and an end to the war in Vietnam. By 1967, Sinclair looks like the prophet of the swamps, oversees a raucous scene featuring the MC5 and the Stooges, who are attempting to channel the energies of free jazz into populist rock \\u2019n\\u2019 roll, and promotes a platform calling for music, drugs and rutting in the streets (actual wording slightly different).\", \"Leni Sinclair\\u2019s photos capture the carnivalesque excitement, disquiet and jejune playacting of this scene \\u2014 asked later about the guns being waved around in various photos, she said: \\u201cWe were hippies! \\u2026 We were just showing off.\\u201d She is a sensitive and versatile photographer, equally at ease depicting riots, communal decision-making, urban decay, cultural shifts and the vivid faces of the elders of Black music.\", \"No one does mise-en-sc\\u00e8ne like Annie Leibovitz. Every shoot, it seems, is epic, an entire motion picture in stills, and presumably requires a small army of assistants to pull off. And this is true whether she is recasting \\u201cAlice in Wonderland\\u201d with fashion-industry titans in the leading roles or simply, or not so simply, catching politicians in action. A photo of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez surrounded by small children at an El stop in the Bronx looks every bit as deep-focus cinematic as her more obviously confected work. Leafing through WONDERLAND (Phaidon, 439 pp., $89.95), a compendium of her greatest hits for Cond\\u00e9 Nast publications over the past 20-odd years, is as overstimulating as watching a whole evening of movie trailers. (I wrote the introduction for one of her previous collections.) Her pictures are big, colorful, beautifully composed, egregiously luxuriant, loaded with detail, and nearly always contain some kind of implied narrative. Often they are meticulously constructed, but sometimes the parts just seem to come together of their own accord, as in a remarkable 2006 photo showing Melania Trump, pregnant and in her underwear, standing on the steps of a private jet, while her husband glowers from the driver\\u2019s seat of his Mercedes-Benz gullwing coupe below \\u2014 apparently he had just shown up. In a sense, Leibovitz is like a 19th-century Salon history painter, making her time appear richer, more glamorous and more absurdly action-packed than it can possibly have been.\", \"Juergen Teller could almost be considered Leibovitz\\u2019s opposite. He too trades in fashion and glamour, but his style tends toward the provocatively slapdash: snapshot-like, apparently off the cuff, sometimes idle-seeming. DONKEY MAN AND OTHER STORIES (Rizzoli, 606 pp., $150) contains many photos of frogs, many photos of variegated penile objects, pictures of trees, rocks, monitors, viscous substances, famous people behaving in antic fashion \\u2014 although not in any composed way, more as if photographer and subject were on a road trip together, acting out a kind of giddy intimacy. That is to say that the portraits are less about them than about the photographer, whose excitingly and inaccessibly frenetic life the book appears to celebrate. The book does not in fact seem intended for you or me, more for friends, colleagues and the sort of fan who will get the various inscrutable jokes that litter its pages. This is not to say that Teller is a bad photographer. He can clearly pull off a fashion shoot, especially one that is supposed to not look like a fashion shoot, as is intermittently voguish, and he is evidently very good at getting subjects to step outside their personas and look goofy. And he is an excellent photographer of frogs.\", \"THE OUTLANDS (Steidl/D.A.P., three volumes, 580 pp., $450) represents the very last of William Eggleston\\u2019s color work from the 1970s, after \\u201cWilliam Eggleston\\u2019s Guide\\u201d (1976), \\u201cElection Eve\\u201d (1977), \\u201cThe Democratic Forest\\u201d (1989) and others. It could almost function as a typology of the American South at that time: houses, churches, shacks, cars, signs (many, many cars and many, many signs), stores, gas stations, floral displays. There are even people, although not too many. The intense color can make the viewer feel as if the pictures were taken yesterday, although the cultural content can make them seem older than 50 years, almost but not quite in Walker Evans territory. That intense color, along with the select focus, generally on a single subject, can also make us feel as if we\\u2019d never really seen color before \\u2014 everything is saturated, and the light seems to belong to one of those purified days in late spring when the blue of the midday sky is at its darkest. The photos are Eggleston\\u2019s outtakes and non-LP B sides, and they are bereft of those enduring enigmas and irreducible human moments that mark the best of his work. But there is no question that they give great and renewable pleasure.\"]","href_hash":"9a0686ec542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9a0686ec542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}},
