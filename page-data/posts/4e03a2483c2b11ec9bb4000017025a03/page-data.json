First, Zillow could be concerned enough about the housing market outlook \\\"that it is willing to sell a very large amount of homes quickly and likely at a loss.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Second, the decision to sell so many homes could signal \\\"undisciplined execution has led [Zillow Group] to take what we see as a drastic step of reducing its owned home portfolio.\\\"\", \"The decision to exit the business comes only weeks after executives touted the home-flipping offering as one that could eventually reach half of all housing stock.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We, over time, believe this can be a service that is offered to the majority, to over 50% of the housing stock,\\\" Zillow Chief Operating Officer Jeremy Wacksman said in a September 13 virtual technology conference. \\\"We will get there.\\\"\", \"It never got there. Zillow said Tuesday in its latest quarterly earnings report that it will write down real estate worth $304 million after buying homes that are now worth less than the company's current estimates of their future sales prices.
