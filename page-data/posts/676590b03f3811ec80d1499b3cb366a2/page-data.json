\\\"monumental step forward for the nation\\\" after fellow Democrats resolved a months-long standoff in their ranks to finally seal the deal.\", \"The House passed the measure 228-206 late on Friday\\u00a0local time, prompting prolonged cheers from the relieved Democratic side of the chamber.\", \"Thirteen Republicans, mostly moderates, supported the legislation while six of the Democrats' farthest left members \\u2014 including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Cori Bush of Missouri \\u2014 opposed it.\", \"The bill, which promises to create legions of jobs and improve broadband, water supplies and other public works, just needs to be signed off by the President himself.\", \"Mr Biden's administration will now oversee the biggest upgrade of America's roads, railways and other transportation infrastructure in a generation, which he has promised will create jobs and boost US competitiveness.\", \"Mr Biden said the investment would be viewed in 50 years as \\\"when America decided to win the competition of the 21st century\\\" with a rising China.\", \"The Democrats still have much work to do on the second pillar of Mr Biden's domestic program: a sweeping expansion of the social safety net and programs to fight climate change.\", \"At a price tag of $US1.75 trillion ($2.34\\u00a0trillion), the Build Back Better package would be the biggest expansion of the US safety net since the 1960s, but the party has struggled to unite behind it.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'We delivered'</div>\", \"The passage of the legislation comes as the President's approval ratings have dropped and after the Democrats got a cold shoulder from voters in this past week's off-year elections.\", \"Democratic candidates for governor were defeated in Virginia and squeaked through in New Jersey, two blue-leaning states.\", \"Those setbacks made party leaders \\u2014 and moderates and liberals alike \\u2014 impatient to produce impactful legislation and demonstrate they know how to govern.\", \"Voters \\\"want us to deliver,\\\" Mr Biden said, and Friday's vote \\\"proved we can\\\".\", \"Elated by the bill's passage, Mr Biden spoke\\u00a0with reporters for over a half hour, joking that his chances of getting the bill done had been written off multiple times, only for him to be able to salvage it.\", \"<img

late on Friday evening local time.(AP: House Television)</div>\", \"The bill had been caught up for months in bitter fighting between Democrats and the impasse had raised questions about the President's effectiveness.\", \"With Mr Biden making multiple phone calls to his colleagues urging a compromise, an agreement was worked out late on Friday for the House to vote by November\\u00a015 on the Build Back Better social safety net plan.\", \"This allowed lawmakers to go forward on the\\u00a0infrastructure\\u00a0bill.\", \"Mr Biden said he would wait to hold a signing ceremony until\\u00a0Democrats and Republicans who voted for it return to Washington after a week's recess.\", \"\\\"Finally, infrastructure week,\\\" he said. \\\"I'm so happy to say that: infrastructure week.\\\"\", \"The phrase \\\"infrastructure week\\\" had become a Washington punch line during his predecessor Donald Trump's four years in the White House, when plans to focus on those investments were repeatedly derailed by scandals.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/9b8795a24a7a324939b0a1a6f7756495\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The package promises to fund the\\u00a0biggest upgrade of America's roads, railways and other transportation infrastructure in a generation.(Reuters:\\u00a0Mike Segar)</div>\", \"The President acknowledged uncertainty surrounding his larger social and environmental spending package, saying \\\"time will tell\\\" whether he can keep popular provisions like universal paid family leave in the final version.\", \"He wouldn't say whether he has private assurances from moderate Democrats in the House and Senate to pass the nearly $US2 trillion bill, but said he was \\\"confident\\\" he would get the votes.\", \"Mr Biden predicted Americans would begin to feel the impact of the infrastructure bill \\\"probably starting within the next two to three months as we get shovels in the ground.\\\"\", \"But the full impact will probably take decades to be fully realised.\", \"He added that he would visit some ports that would benefit from the legislation in the next week, as his administration tries frantically to ease supply chain disruptions that are raising prices on consumer goods before the holidays.\",
