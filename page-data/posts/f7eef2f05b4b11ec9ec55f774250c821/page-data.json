Dometic offers a different solution with its CFX3 line of electric-powered coolers. Instead of messing with ice, which will ultimately melt, the CFX3 coolers plug into a wall outlet or 12-volt car outlet.\", \"The convenience of a powered cooler that can hold a temperature as low as minus 7 degrees Fahrenheit doesn't come cheap. This entry level CFX3 35 model, which can hold 50 12-ounce drink cans, starts at nearly $980 when it's not on sale.\", \"Having a portable fridge and freezer could really change how you pack for a trip or parties in the backyard. So I was curious how this Dometic cooler worked in practice. Does it actually perform as it appears?\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">TL;DR</div>\", \"Pros:\", \"Cons:\", \"Buy at Dometic.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What Is a Powered Cooler?</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943403/dometic-cfx3-35.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The CFX3 35 has a capacity of 36 liters. The compressor that does the cooling takes up some of the inside space, but likely not more than would be used by ice.</div>\", \"The CFX3 35 uses a small VMSO3 compressor to refrigerate and deep-freeze whatever you might need to chill. In case it's not clear why someone wouldn't just buy a mini fridge instead of a powered cooler, it's for the portability. This product has handles and a rigid frame so it can be moved around. It's much more versatile than a standard fridge would be.\", \"The cooler does need to be continually plugged into power: either AC or DC power sources, such as a home electrical outlet or 12 volt outlet in a car. Essentially, this is a portable fridge in the shape of a cooler. The compressor does take up some room inside, but no more than would have been used by ice in a traditional cooler.\", \"The CFX3 35 has a small liquid-crystal (LCD) screen on the outside to display the basic settings and temperatures. Next to the external display is a USB-A port that can be used to charge other personal devices, such as a phone.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943394/dometic-cfx3-35.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The CFX3 35 has a small LCD screen to show the temperature and control all of its settings.</div>\", \"This cooler has Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity, but the app experience is lacking overall. I had no trouble connecting to the cooler using Bluetooth, but Wi-Fi took longer to configure. Within the Dometic app you can set and change the temperature. You can also see a history of the temperature over an hour, day or week. Those are the two main functions of the companion app. Any of the available settings can be changed on the cooler itself.\", \"For example, it does have different levels of battery protection so as to not drain your car's battery when powering the cooler on the road. You can select how aggressive that protection is with high, medium and low options right from the cooler's small screen.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">How Much Can the Dometic CFX3 35 Hold?</div>\", \"The Dometic's entry level CFX3 35 has a storage capacity of 36 liters. There's a large main section and a smaller, shallow shelf area inside the cooler.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943391/dometic-cfx3-35.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Inside the CFX3 35 cooler is a removable wire basket, a light and a drain plug.</div>\", \"I took the CFX3 35 on a weekend road trip in the back of an SUV and used it for fruits, drinks and deli meats. In terms of capacity versus overall footprint size, my guess is that this 36-liter model would work well for a couple. My family of four managed to make it work, but on a long road trip or spending more time away from the house, having additional storage would be more convenient. A family with more than four people will probably want to start with one of the other CFX3 models, all of which mostly have the same features but in larger sizes.\", \"The CFX3 35 is a bit heavy. Empty, it weighs about 37 pounds. Because of its size and shape it may need two people to move or lift onto a storage shelf, especially when it's in use and packed full of drinks.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">The CFX3 35 Takes the Heat</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943400/dometic-cfx3-35.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The CFX3 35 powered cooler has a reinforced frame to keep it safe while moving around.</div>\", \"I really wanted to test the CFX3 35's performance in direct sun with a temperature above 80 degrees Fahrenheit. With the season heading into Southern California winter, I had to settle for temperatures that peaked around the mid-70s. I plugged in the cooler, set it to 38 degrees Fahrenheit and put in a 6-pack of cans that had been sitting at room temperature.\", \"Within an hour, the CFX3 35 had reached its target temperature and chilled the drinks down to a cool level. There was no audible noise from the compressor after the cooler reached its goal. After another hour, I unplugged the cooler and let it sit into the evening to see how well it would remain chilly inside. After about three hours, the inside of the cooler was at 55 degrees\\u2014the outside temperature was at 60 degrees.\", \"To go even further into the cold zone, the next morning I set the target temperature to zero degrees. (I removed the drinks and replaced them with an ice pack.) It took about 40 minutes to get there from its 54 degree starting point. There was a gentle hum, like any mini fridge might make as it made its way down to the goal. Once it reached zero degrees, it became nearly inaudible.\", \"The cooler had no problem holding its temperature at 0 degrees. The ice pack I had inside remained frozen the whole time.\", \"If extreme heat is a concern, Dometic does sell an insulated cover, which should help improve its efficiency. The app can also alert you if the temperature falls outside a 9 degree threshold of its target temperature.\", \"I was a bit disappointed by the short power cables that come with the cooler. Getting an extension cord is easy enough for a standard outlet. But you almost certainly want to keep the cooler in the trunk or bed of a truck, and reaching a 12 volt power source might not be possible.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1943397/dometic-cfx3-35.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">On the back rear of the cooler are its AC and DC power connections.</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Should You Buy the Dometic CFX3 35?</div>\", \"It's always hard to recommend someone spend nearly $1,000, no matter the product. In this case, a powered cooler is a fairly specific need. The CFX3 35 doesn't run on battery power and most people don't need to be tethered to an electrical source as opposed to just using ice. Plus, the app component isn't anything to write home about.\", \"Still, if you can justify the need for a powered cooler by going on constant trips or having lots of backyard parties, then this one is probably the first product to consider. There's also the possibility that you'll occasionally need 36 liters of extra freezer space in the garage throughout the year. Despite its price and minor limitations, I was continually impressed by the CFX3 35's performance and all-around usefulness in more situations than I expected.\", \"Buy at Dometic for $979.99.\"]","href_hash":"f7eef2f05b4b11ec9ec55f774250c821"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f7eef2f05b4b11ec9ec55f774250c821"}},
