I felt so much relief.\\u201d\", \"The meeting was organized by the St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, Wesley Bell, as part of a \\u201crestorative justice\\u201d mediation program. It took place a year after the city of Ladue agreed to a $2 million settlement with Ms. Hall that released Ms. Crews and Ladue\\u2019s police chief, Ken Andreski Jr., from liability, The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. Mr. Bell announced on Monday that the assault charge against Ms. Crews had been dismissed.\", \"Restorative justice, an alternative to prosecution, is based on the premise that victims of crimes and those charged with committing them can address and repair harm by voluntarily talking to each other. The process, which is most often applied in nonviolent cases, involves a conversation, facilitated by a mediator, that allows each party to discuss a crime and why it happened, and to reach an outcome that resolves the conflict.\", \"The events that would bring Ms. Hall and Ms. Crews together this month unfolded on April 23, 2019, in the parking lot of the Ladue Crossing shopping center. Ms. Hall was one of two shoppers whom employees at the Schnucks store accused of pushing a cart of steaks and seafood past a self-checkout area, The Post-Dispatch reported.\", \"Ms. Crews drew her weapon as Ms. Hall was running away and shot her in the back, the authorities said.\", \"As Ms. Hall lay bleeding in the parking lot, Ms. Crews apologized to her, according to a federal lawsuit that Ms. Hall filed last year against Ms. Crews and the city of Ladue accusing them of unreasonable and excessive force. Ms. Crews later told detectives that she had meant to reach for her Taser, not her gun. A month after the shooting, she resigned from the Police Department, submitting a letter in which she called the episode an \\u201cinnocent mistake.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Hall, 36, was hospitalized for three weeks, initially in critical condition, with a lacerated stomach, a gunshot wound and multiple rib fractures, her lawyer, William King Holland, said.\", \"Ms. Crews, 39, did not respond to an interview request.\", \"\\u201cOfficer Crews has maintained she did not intend to shoot Ashley Hall,\\u201d her lawyer, Travis Noble, said in a statement. \\u201cIt was an accident. The restorative justice approach taken by the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney\\u2019s Office was the best outcome for all involved.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Bell, the St. Louis County prosecutor, said that the case \\u201cpresented a unique set of facts\\u201d that made it an ideal opportunity for restorative justice mediation. He emphasized Ms. Crews\\u2019s immediate apology after she fired a bullet into Ms. Hall\\u2019s back, and Ms. Hall\\u2019s disclosure to him that she did not wish to see Ms. Crews go to jail.\", \"Soon after the shooting, Mr. Bell contacted the restorative justice program in Washington, D.C., which the city\\u2019s attorney general, Karl A. Racine, established in 2017. Seema Gajwani, who leads the program, agreed to facilitate the moderation between Ms. Hall and Ms. Crews.\", \"\\u201cThis is an example accomplishing the ideal, which is healing and justice,\\u201d Mr. Bell said in an interview. \\u201cThe trauma that individuals have to deal with during the legal process often does not address that healing, that type of accountability, and it\\u2019s not designed to.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Gajwani said in an interview that the criminal justice system leaves little room for people to have the agency to \\u201cresolve things themselves and to have a chance to speak.\\u201d She said she has often been surprised by how frequently victims opt for restorative justice when it is available, instead of a trial.\", \"Washington\\u2019s restorative justice program has conducted more than 150 mediations, according to Mr. Racine\\u2019s office, which said that an internal analysis of cases involving juvenile offenders indicated that the process reduces recidivism.\", \"Restorative justice programs are proliferating across the country, and not just in major metropolitan areas, said Alissa Marque Heydari, deputy director of the Institute for Innovation in Prosecution at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.\", \"\\u201cIt can give that person a level of closure that the traditional form of prosecution really can\\u2019t,\\u201d Ms. Heydari said, adding that there was a \\u201cgrowing trend\\u201d of applying restorative justice mediation to a wide range of cases beyond low-level crimes.\", \"Restorative justice cases involving police officers or former officers are rare, according to Ms. Gajwani, who said the mediation in the Ladue shooting was the first one she had participated in with an officer.\", \"One exception involved the dismissal of all charges last year against a former police officer in Asheville, N.C., who had been convicted of assaulting an unarmed Black man who was suspected of jaywalking.\", \"The dismissal of the assault charge against Ms. Crews clears the way for her to return to the police force if she chooses, Mr. Noble, her attorney, said, adding that she had yet to indicate her future plans to him.\", \"Ms. Hall said that she still struggles years after the shooting. She feels fear when she goes outside and finds herself catastrophizing, or assuming the worst, when she gets in her car.\", \"But she said she was at peace with Ms. Crews. Their meeting was \\u201cvery emotional,\\u201d Ms. Hall said, adding that it was \\u201cthe best thing we could have done for both of us.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt felt like she was genuinely sorry,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019m still here, and I\\u2019m thankful for that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a1689c3a4ea611ec87c299d0b0d2b853"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a1689c3a4ea611ec87c299d0b0d2b853"}},
