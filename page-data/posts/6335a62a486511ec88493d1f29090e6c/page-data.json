But the bill, as it stands, still includes a lot of changes that would expand health coverage, broaden benefits and lower costs across the age spectrum.\", \"The changes aren\\u2019t a major reconsideration of the health care system in the U.S., as Medicare for all would be. Instead, Democrats in Congress have crafted smaller solutions to gaps in the current system.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re all sort of small slices,\\u201d said Christine Eibner, a senior economist at the RAND Corporation. \\u201cWe have a whole bunch of little niches that need to be filled.\\u201d\", \"Because the bill is still being negotiated by Congress, details could change \\u2014 or the legislation might fail altogether. But the current package represents a particular vision for how to overhaul the system.\", \"During the 2020 presidential primary, I described the Democratic Party\\u2019s health care debate as a metaphorical fight over home construction options. Some candidates, like Bernie Sanders, saw the weird old house of the U.S. health care system as a tear-down; others, like Joe Biden, viewed it as a fixer-upper. The authors of the Build Back Better Act are aiming for a renovation.\", \"Here\\u2019s what the bill\\u2019s health care proposals would offer different groups.\", \"If the current bill passes, the more than 25 million Medicare patients with hearing loss could get coverage for hearing aids. An overhaul of drug benefits would also reduce what patients pay for medicines, including a monthly $35 cap for insulin and an annual drug spending limit of $2,000. Around 2.5 million Medicare patients pay more than that now, and the ones who do can face huge bills for lifesaving treatments.\", \"The legislation would for the first time allow Medicare to regulate the price of prescription drugs, which could drive down pharmacy costs for some patients. The details of that plan were heavily negotiated and remain the subject of intense lobbying. But the current version still represents a significant change in how Medicare pays for drugs.\", \"Another part of the bill would expand funding for home health care. That could help some of the 800,000 older and disabled Americans on waiting lists to get care in their community instead of in nursing homes.\", \"The bill would fix a longstanding hole in the Affordable Care Act by offering an affordable health insurance option to poor adults in 12 states that have not adopted expanded Medicaid programs. The bill would give those people access to free Obamacare plans, with additional benefits that would eliminate most co-payments and offer additional services.\", \"People who buy their own health insurance would be able to keep collecting tax credits that were created by President Biden\\u2019s pandemic stimulus bill in March. Those subsidies lower the price of health insurance for almost everyone who buys their own plan. Adults with low incomes would be able to sign up for free plans, and those with higher incomes could keep new financial assistance that didn\\u2019t exist in Obamacare\\u2019s first decade.\", \"Those increases were aimed at concerns among researchers and Democratic lawmakers that the Affordable Care Act had not made insurance affordable enough. Combined with a big enrollment push, the changes prompted 2.8 million more Americans to sign up for insurance this year.\", \"New rules in the bill would limit how much pharmaceutical companies can increase drug prices each year. That could help lower premiums and co-payments for the two-thirds of Americans with private health insurance. (Though, as Politico recently reported, pharmaceutical companies are lobbying hard to weaken this proposal.)\", \"The bill would permanently extend the Children\\u2019s Health Insurance Program, which provides inexpensive health benefits to nearly 10 million children from lower-income families.\", \"It would also make a technical change to Medicaid that experts say would help children keep their health insurance for longer. The change requires that children be allowed to keep the insurance for a year after being signed up, even if their family\\u2019s income changes. Frequent eligibility checks in certain states had contributed to loss of coverage for more than a million children in recent years.\", \"The sum of these parts is much smaller than the tear-downers might have preferred. America\\u2019s health coverage system remains fragmented. Some groups, such as undocumented immigrants, remain left out. Other people may still struggle to afford coverage or may lack insurance for benefits such as dental care. Price regulations won\\u2019t take a huge bite out of pharmaceutical industry profits. And some of the key coverage expansions will expire after 2025 if Congress doesn\\u2019t renew them.\", \"But, for a legislative package that is not primarily about health care and faces monetary constraints, Democrats have targeted many cracks in the system. They aim to protect key groups of uninsured Americans and address missing benefits in existing programs, at least for a while.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a short-term big deal,\\u201d said Cynthia Cox, the director of the Program on the A.C.A. at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \\u201cWhat we are going to see is almost every American citizen will be eligible for affordable health insurance, but only for the next three or so years.\\u201d\", \"Katharine Esty is 87, triple vaxxed and living life again.\", \"The \\u201cwoke\\u201d student is a scapegoat, Michael Roth argues in The Times.\", \"Artifacts: Looking for a stolen idol?

The futuristic space-shooter series has sold more than 81 million copies of games, spun off into a universe of novels and comics, and brought in more than $6 billion.\", \"Halo Infinite, the next installment in the franchise, is due out next month on Microsoft\\u2019s new consoles, the Xbox Series X and Series S. It comes at a moment when the company could use a blockbuster, Kellen Browning writes in The Times.\", \"During the pandemic, Microsoft\\u2019s chief rivals, Nintendo and Sony, had major hits with Animal Crossing and The Last of Us Part II. \\u201cMicrosoft didn\\u2019t really have any product like that to engage the stay-at-home, Covid-fearful player that was out there,\\u201d Adam Sessler, a video game journalist, told The Times.\", \"But it\\u2019s been two decades since Halo\\u2019s first release, and six years since its last major installment. Will people still care?\", \"\\u201cThe Halo franchise is old, and its new game faces far more competition for gamers\\u2019 eyeballs than during its heyday,\\u201d Kellen told us. \\u201cBut don\\u2019t underestimate the nostalgia factor.
