It actually is the only story in the Hebrew Bible that doesn't mention God. It's a purely human drama. And it is extremely dramatic.\\\"\", \"The story of Purim begins in ancient Persia, with a king, a queen, and a villain, the king's advisor, Haman. \\\"Haman hates the Jews,\\\" Butnick told correspondent Faith Salie. \\\"What he does not know is that Esther the queen is secretly Jewish. And so when he basically cooks up this plot to kill all the Jews in ancient Persia, Esther decides that if she wants to save the Jews she has to out herself essentially as being Jewish.\\\"\", \"So, Esther confronts the king and ultimately convinces him to stop Haman's plot. \\\"The Jews get saved, Haman gets killed, and that's the holiday we celebrate today,\\\" said Butnick.\\u00a0\", \"The pastry, however, wasn't baked into the holiday until the 16th century, when it was inspired by the German cookie mohntaschen (mohn meaning poppy seed and tash meaning pockets).\", \"Butnick said, \\\"Haman is the villain of the Purim story. And so, Jews sort of said, 'Wait, what if we called this cookie a hamantaschen? And we can eat it on Purim?' And now, we have these hamantaschen which are technically Haman's pockets. But people say it's Haman's ears, people say it's Haman's hat. So, we've sort of just made this cookie into what it is that we want it to be.\\\"\", \"And as the meaning of the triangle has evolved, so has hamantaschen itself. At Breads Bakery, chef Edan Leshnick has cooked new flavors \\u2013 pizza hamantaschen, anyone? \\u2013 and classics like poppy.\\u00a0\", \"The process of making hamantaschen is relatively simple, and the significance of the triangle even a little silly. But when put into context, Butnick said it's a recipe for what Jewish celebrations are all about:\", \"\\\"To me, it's this Jewish spirit of resilience and celebration that we actually eat a cookie named after one of the top villains in Jewish history,\\\" she said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Yeah, it's, like, taking a bite of Jewish people's survival,\\\" said Salie.\", \"\\\"Yes, they tried to kill us, we won, let's eat a delicious cookie!\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0RECIPE:\\u00a0Apple Hamantaschen from Breads Bakery\", \"\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0For more info:\", \"\\u00a0 \\u00a0 \\u00a0\\u00a0Story produced by Sara Kugel.
