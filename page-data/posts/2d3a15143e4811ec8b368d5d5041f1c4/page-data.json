But investors could become inured to the bleak state of climate change.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-05T06:54:35.000Z","content":"[\"It\\u2019s not yet clear how effective the United Nations conference underway in Glasgow will be in mitigating the most pernicious effects of global warming. But one outcome is already evident: The number of news articles about climate change is surging.\", \"Another result of the Glasgow conference can be predicted with some confidence, too. So-called green stocks \\u2014 those of companies with relatively low carbon emissions \\u2014 will get a temporary boost. At the same time, brown stocks \\u2014 those of companies that emit large quantities of greenhouse gases \\u2014 will face a headwind.\", \"New research indicates that the two effects are related. Three recent research papers by two groups of economists suggest that when public exposure to information about climate change spikes, investor preferences also shift, altering the performance of sectors of the stock market.\", \"\\u201cWhat we\\u2019ve found is a story about climate change and the stock market,\\u201d Lubos Pastor, a professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said in an interview.\", \"\\u201cAt this point, news about climate change, any news, is, at least to some extent, negative,\\u201d he said, meaning that it tends to raise public concern about the future of the planet. \\u201cAs investors become more aware of the climate issue, they understand that regulations are coming, and that the situation will be beneficial to green firms and harmful to brown ones.\\u201d\", \"That increased public attention \\u2014 and the accompanying preference of many investors for environmentally sensitive stocks \\u2014 boosts the price of those stocks and hurts those of companies that are big emitters of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases, the scholars found. They also pointed out that this investor preference for green companies has made it easier and cheaper to raise money for environmentally useful projects.\", \"But for people who want to do well while doing good, the researchers\\u2019 findings may not be entirely comforting.\", \"For one thing, the very preference of many investors for green stocks \\u2014 which creates a measurable green premium, or \\u201cgreenium,\\u201d that elevates their share price \\u2014 implies that these shares will have lower expected returns in the future. That\\u2019s just what happens in financial markets when demand for an asset soars and supply does not: Its price rises over the short run but, all else equal, it has less room for increases down the road. .\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019d say with this green preference, the market reaches a new equilibrium,\\u201d said Robert F. Stambaugh, an economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. \\u201cBy pricing green stocks higher, investors are accepting lower expected returns, whether they understand that or not.\\u201d\", \"The converse is also true. Obviously, fossil fuel stocks can still rise sharply amid an energy shortage \\u2014 as they have been doing in recent months \\u2014 even if there is increasing investor preference for alternative energy companies and other green stocks. If anything, Professor Stambaugh said, by creating a premium for green stocks and shunning brown ones, environmentally conscious investors may be inadvertently raising the expected returns for brown stocks. As long as these companies still produce profits and cash flow, investors who strongly emphasize making money over environmental issues may now flock to brown stocks, judging them a relative bargain.\", \"The core of these insights appears in \\u201cSustainable Investing in Equilibrium,\\u201d published this month in the Journal of Financial Economics and available as a working paper since December 2019. Along with Lucian Taylor, who is also a professor at Wharton, Professors Stambaugh and Pastor wrote that paper, which developed the model that explains how shifting investor preferences lead to share re-pricing and stock market shifts.\", \"Two subsequent papers provided evidence that supports their theory.\", \"The first, \\u201cClimate Change Concerns and the Performance of Green Versus Brown Stocks,\\u201d was written by a group of economists affiliated with the National Bank of Belgium. They are David Ardia of HEC Montreal, Keven Bluteau of Universit\\u00e9 de Sherbrooke, and Kris Boudt and Koen Inghelbrecht of Ghent University.\", \"They constructed a \\u201cMedia Climate Change Concerns index\\u201d that measured the frequency and tone of climate change coverage from Jan. 1, 2010, to June 30, 2018, in The New York Times and seven other large-circulation U.S. newspapers: The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times, The Chicago Tribune, USA Today, The New York Daily News and The New York Post.\", \"The index spiked during major conferences on climate change, like the one that produced the 2015 Paris Agreement, as well as after major setbacks in efforts to curb global warming, like President Trump\\u2019s announcement in 2017 that the United States was withdrawing from that agreement.\", \"In an interview, Professor Ardia said the researchers were working on an updated version of the index. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s safe to say that the index would be spiking now, during the Glasgow conference, whatever happens there,\\u201d he said.\", \"The researchers compared their index with the returns of selected stocks, distinguishing between green and brown shares on the basis of their companies\\u2019 carbon intensity, as defined by their carbon emissions divided by their revenue. The researchers found that when climate coverage increased, the prices of brown stocks dropped compared with those of green stocks.\", \"Another research paper by Professors Pastor, Stambaugh and Taylor relied in part on the same Media Climate Change Concerns index, and produced similar findings. It concluded that the increased coverage of climate change contributed to a significant outperformance of green stocks over brown ones from November 2012 through December 2020. \\u201cOver this period, the value-weighted portfolio of stocks in the top third of greenness outperformed the bottom third by a cumulative return difference of 174 percent,\\u201d the paper said.\", \"This roughly corresponds with the results of standard stock market indexes. Those that emphasize environmental factors have, for the most part, had stronger returns than the broad market in recent years. For instance, the environmentally friendly MSCI ACWI ESG Leaders index outperformed the standard MSCI ACWI index (which tracks world markets) in 10 of the 13 years through 2020, according to MSCI.\", \"But the scholars pointed out that there\\u2019s no assurance that this trend will continue, and not simply because past performance doesn\\u2019t predict future outcomes, as investors are frequently warned. Their research is based on measurement of the newsworthiness of climate change. If global warming worsens, as most scientists say is likely, it\\u2019s possible that people will become inured to it. When a barrage of news on any subject becomes constant, it\\u2019s no longer quite as newsworthy, as any journalist knows.\", \"\\u201cIf it\\u2019s a surprise, it\\u2019s news, by our definition,\\u201d Professor Bluteau said. \\u201cOnce it\\u2019s not surprising, it\\u2019s no longer news.\\u201d That, in turn, could affect stock returns and reduce the reward that environmentally conscious investors are receiving. Economics explains problems like this. It doesn\\u2019t necessarily solve them.\"]","href_hash":"2d3a15143e4811ec8b368d5d5041f1c4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2d3a15143e4811ec8b368d5d5041f1c4"}},
