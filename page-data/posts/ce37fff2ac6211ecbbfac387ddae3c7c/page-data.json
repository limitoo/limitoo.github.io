The agency said it has tasked an official to monitor conditions at the facility, which is undergoing renovations.\", \"Meanwhile, the Alamance County Detention Facility in North Carolina will transition from a long-term detention facility to a 72-hour processing site, the notice said. ICE officials cited concerns about conditions at the county jail where the detainees are held, including a lack of outdoor recreation.\", \"Friday's announcement represents the most significant move yet by the Biden administration in its efforts to reform ICE's sprawling detention system, which has long been plagued by reports\\u00a0of inadequate conditions and allegations of detainee mistreatment. ICE will continue to monitor conditions at other detention facilities, the notice said.\", \"In an interview with CBS News in January, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas called detention reform one of his priorities for 2022.
