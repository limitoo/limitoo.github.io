Those tiny rocks slam into our atmosphere, creating trails of dazzling light as they burn up. As Earth plows into Phaethon\\u2019s debris field, the resulting meteors all appear to streak from a spot in the sky, called a radiant, where the constellation Gemini sits, hence the meteor shower\\u2019s name. Other showers originate from comets.\", \"While you may get a good look at them tonight, the Geminids presented an unusual spectacle for a few lucky viewers in December 2020.\", \"Nathan Myhrvold, the former chief technology officer of Microsoft who is also a photographer, a researcher on asteroids and a cookbook author, traveled near Pinto Canyon in the Big Bend region of Texas during a particularly impressive Geminid shower when the moon was new and therefore caused little interference.\", \"Dr. Myhrvold has built a custom array of four cameras that allows him to take in a large portion of the sky at once, and he used it to record last year\\u2019s show. After processing and combining images from thousands of different exposures, he noticed that there were meteors in his pictures originating from several different points and not just from the constellation Gemini.\", \"\\u201cBecause it was super dark and I had this special camera array, we captured meteors from six different showers simultaneously,\\u201d Dr. Myhrvold said.\", \"The other showers in the picture are minor showers, and they were not near their peaks, so they only produced a few faint meteors. Along with the Geminids, Dr. Myhrvold managed to see streaks from the Sigma Hydrids, the Leonis Minorids, the Comae Berenicids, the Monocerotids and the Puppid-Velids.\", \"\\u201cI was expecting I\\u2019d see a picture where all the lines came from one radiant,\\u201d Dr. Myhrvold said. \\u201cAlthough there were a ton of them from the Geminids, it turns out there were six radiants.\\u201d\", \"Capturing meteors from so many sources at once is very uncommon, and viewers shouldn\\u2019t expect to see something similar this year. But you can still enjoy the show.\", \"The Geminids peak between Dec. 13 and Dec. 14.\", \"Because of the bright moon, which is nearly full and which will be above the horizon for part of the night, this year\\u2019s Geminids are predicted to be more difficult to see than usual, with perhaps one meteor per minute in dark sky conditions, said William Cooke, who leads the Meteoroid Environments Office at NASA.\", \"The moon sets around 2 a.m. on Tuesday morning, so the best chance to see the shower in all its glory is between then and sunrise, regardless of your time zone.\", \"For those interested in seeing the most impressive display, Dr. Cooke advised getting to as dark a location as possible, away from city lights.\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re in the middle of downtown Manhattan, go somewhere else,\\u201d he said.\", \"Viewers should give themselves 30 to 45 minutes for their eyes to adapt to the dark and then lie flat on the ground in a position that allows them to take in as much of the sky as possible. \\u201cAbove all, don\\u2019t look at your cellphone,\\u201d Dr. Cooke said. \\u201cYou\\u2019ll ruin your night vision.\\u201d\", \"While the Geminids originate from the constellation Gemini, meteors will be visible all over the sky. Binoculars or telescopes are unnecessary, because the meteors pass too quickly to be captured in their scopes.\", \"It\\u2019s December, so it\\u2019s best to bundle up and bring a thermos of something warm to drink. \\u201cMeteor observing takes time,\\u201d Dr. Cooke said. \\u201cMother Nature is not big on comfort.\\u201d\", \"If you miss the peak tonight, the shower will continue over the coming days. Early Wednesday morning is another good opportunity to catch the Geminids.\", \"Cellphone cameras are generally not sensitive enough to record meteors, because the streaks only last a couple of seconds.\", \"While you won\\u2019t be able to take a picture like Dr. Myhrvold\\u2019s without a customized setup, if you have a digital camera you can try your hand at astrophotography. Dr. Myhrvold recommends placing a camera on a tripod with a wide-angle lens and then setting a long exposure of perhaps 10 seconds. Then sit back, stay warm and enjoy the show with your own eyes.\"]","href_hash":"0614d80c5cf711ec86ec0d07c2ee04d1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0614d80c5cf711ec86ec0d07c2ee04d1"}},
