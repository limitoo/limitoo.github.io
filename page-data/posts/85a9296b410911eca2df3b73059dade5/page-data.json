The officer who shot Hurley will not face criminal charges, a prosecutor announced Monday.\", \"An investigation into the incident by outside agencies concluded the shooting was an accident, the Associated Press reported. The prosecutor, like police before her, lauded Hurley's actions following the death of officer Gordon Beasley.\", \"\\\"He acted to defend others and we will remember him for his selflessness,\\\" First Judicial District Attorney Alexis King said at a press conference.\", \"Police said Troyke left a note saying he intended to kill as many police officers as possible.\", \"Hurley's mother understood the possible blowback following no charges for the officer who killed her son.

None of them knew Beesley, a 19-year department veteran and beloved school resource officer, had been shot or that Hurley had intervened. The officer who shot Hurley, who was wearing a red shirt and holding Troyke's rifle, believed he was a second mass shooter and that he only had a moment to stop him from hurting others, King said.\", \"The three officers separated to different parts of the building to try to stop the gunman dressed in black, according to King's letter to police detailing the findings of the investigation. One saw people rushing away from the main square in Olde Town Arvada, a historic shopping and entertainment area around midday on June 21 while the second set out to try to shoot at the gunman from a window but could not see him from there. But, standing at a door to the building, Officer Kraig Brownlow saw a man wearing a red shirt \\u2014 later identified as Hurley \\u2014 come into view holding an AR-style rifle and a handgun near the spot where the man in black had been spotted earlier, looking toward the square, King said. Hurley appeared to Brownlow to be reloading the rifle or trying to fix something while holstering his pistol, the letter said.\", \"An Arvada police spokesperson declined to comment on the decision. In a statement, the city said it appreciated the work that went into the investigation and expressed support for its police department in general as well as Brownlow and his family.\", \"\\\"This incident illustrates the nearly unfathomable decisions society asks our police officers to make as they go about their everyday work,\\\" it said.\"]","href_hash":"85a9296b410911eca2df3b73059dade5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"85a9296b410911eca2df3b73059dade5"}},
