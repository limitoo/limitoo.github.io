Brian Kemp, a fellow Republican who defied the former president.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-06T17:49:44.000Z","content":"[\"ATLANTA \\u2014 Former Senator David Perdue\\u2019s leap Monday into a primary challenge against Gov. Brian Kemp, his fellow Republican, ensured that Georgia will be at the hot molten core of the political universe next year, with costly and competitive races that will test the grip of Trumpism over the G.O.P. and measure the backlash against President Biden in a state that increasingly reflects the country\\u2019s demography and its divisions.\", \"Already a battleground at the presidential level, Georgia will be the scene of intense Republican primary showdowns for both governor and secretary of state, followed by general election contests in which Democrats \\u2014 led by Senator Raphael Warnock, who is seeking a full term, and Stacey Abrams, who narrowly lost the 2018 governor\\u2019s race to Mr. Kemp and announced another bid last week \\u2014 hope to keep the state a bluer tint of purple.\", \"Mr. Perdue, who lost his Senate seat after one term to the Democrat Jon Ossoff in January, is former President Donald J. Trump\\u2019s preferred candidate, while Mr. Kemp earned a place on Mr. Trump\\u2019s enemies list after declining to help the former president overturn his 2020 election loss in Georgia. The two will now face off in May in an internecine war that may offer the closest approximation to a referendum on Trumpism next year as any in the country.\", \"\\u201cLook, I like Brian. This isn\\u2019t personal,\\u201d Mr. Perdue said Monday in a video announcing his candidacy. But he implied that Mr. Kemp had damaged his standing with Georgia\\u2019s Trumpist base of Republican voters.\", \"\\u201cHe has failed all of us,\\u201d Mr. Perdue said of Mr. Kemp, \\u201cand cannot win in November.\\u201d\", \"Aides to Mr. Kemp gave Mr. Perdue a blistering reception, revealing the depths of the anger over what they view as his betrayal of a fellow Republican and former political ally. They noted that the governor had actually beaten Ms. Abrams, while Mr. Perdue was, most recently, that most loathsome of nouns in the former president\\u2019s vocabulary: a loser.\", \"And Georgians First Inc., a pro-Kemp political action committee, released an ad reminding voters of Mr. Perdue\\u2019s stock trades of companies whose business fell under the purview of his Senate committees.\", \"While Mr. Kemp boasted a \\u201cproven track record,\\u201d a campaign spokesman for the governor, Cody Hall, said on Monday, \\u201cPerdue is best known for ducking debates, padding his stock portfolio during a pandemic, and losing winnable races.\\u201d\", \"Endorsing Mr. Perdue on Monday, Mr. Trump called Mr. Kemp \\u201ca very weak governor\\u201d who \\u201ccan\\u2019t win because the MAGA base \\u2014 which is enormous \\u2014 will never vote for him.\\u201d\", \"In entering the governor\\u2019s race, Mr. Perdue joins a number of other G.O.P. candidates who could form a slate of high-profile Trump loyalists in November: The former football star Herschel Walker, with Mr. Trump\\u2019s encouragement, is seeking the nomination to run against Mr. Warnock. And Representative Jody Hice is challenging the Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, who also rebuffed Mr. Trump\\u2019s entreaties to help overturn his defeat.\", \"Both Mr. Walker and Mr. Hice have parroted Mr. Trump\\u2019s false claim that election fraud cost him the 2020 election.\", \"And Mr. Perdue did not limit his own attack to Mr. Kemp. Republicans were disunited in Georgia, he said, \\u201cand Brian Kemp and Brad Raffensperger are to blame.\\u201d\", \"The influence of Mr. Trump, who has not ruled out another presidential run in 2024, is bound to be felt in other states\\u2019 midterm races. But Mr. Trump has been particularly fixated on Georgia, a state he lost by fewer than 12,000 votes. He and some of his allies are being investigated by the Fulton County district attorney\\u2019s office for potential criminal violations after reaching out to state officials, including Mr. Kemp and Mr. Raffensperger, in an effort to change the election results.\", \"If Mr. Perdue and Mr. Walker lead the Republican ticket next fall, Georgia voters will be forced to choose between revulsion for Mr. Trump and his incendiary politics, on the one hand, and, on the other, dissatisfaction with Mr. Biden and unease with the liberal politics that Ms. Abrams and Mr. Warnock embody.\", \"The drama will unfold in a state that, with its gaping divides along the lines of race, class and region, mirrors the nation and its partisan, polarized and increasingly poisonous politics.\", \"Georgia also reflects broader trends among the two national parties. Democrats are increasingly turning to more diverse candidates. But the candidates are still stepping gingerly, as Ms. Abrams did in her launch video by trumpeting the idea of \\u201cone Georgia,\\u201d and seeking to elevate unifying issues that can appeal to die-hard liberals and fickle suburbanites alike.\", \"Some Democrats fear that Ms. Abrams, a veteran state legislator and voting-rights advocate, may face an uphill climb in the governor\\u2019s race given the challenges confronting the party nationally: an unpopular president, inflation, Covid-19, and simmering concerns over violent crime and how American history is taught in schools.\", \"But many expressed hope on Monday that the coming fight between Mr. Kemp and Mr. Perdue would benefit Ms. Abrams, who is seeking to become the state\\u2019s first Black governor, and other down-ballot Democrats.\", \"\\u201cWhile David Perdue and Brian Kemp fight each other, Stacey Abrams will be fighting for the people of Georgia,\\u201d said her campaign manager, Lauren Groh-Wargo, pointing to Ms. Abrams\\u2019s stances on health coverage, school funding and Covid-related health policies.\", \"For Republicans, Georgia has now become perhaps the most consequential proving ground in the party\\u2019s Trump wars. Should Mr. Perdue and other Trump-backed candidates lose their primaries, it will raise grave questions about the former president\\u2019s clout in the party as well as his own capacity to compete in a must-win state in 2024.\", \"By running, Mr. Perdue and his supporters are effectively sending the message that Mr. Trump must be accommodated \\u2014 and his election denialism perpetuated.\", \"Mr. Perdue\\u2019s allies say their case is very simple: Mr. Kemp is unelectable next November because a significant number of Trump devotees will stay at home if he\\u2019s nominated.\", \"\\u201cThe bitterness between Kemp and Trump is so deep that Kemp cannot win a general election,\\u201d said Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, who is backing Mr. Perdue. \\u201cThe question for Georgia Republicans is would you like Perdue or Stacey Abrams, because if you\\u2019re for Kemp, you\\u2019re effectively voting for Stacey Abrams.\\u201d\", \"For his part, Mr. Kemp, who in his 2018 race brandished guns and threatened to round up \\u201ccriminal illegals\\u201d in his pickup truck, can be expected to remind Republican voters that it is hard to outflank him to the right on issues like gun control or abortion rights. He also signed into law Georgia\\u2019s controversial new voting law, which limits ballot access for voters in urban and suburban areas that are home to many Democrats.\", \"Mr. Kemp\\u2019s supporters also say they believe that Ms. Abrams is enough of a polarizing force to cauterize any G.O.P. wounds sustained in the primary.\", \"\\u201cShe will inspire Republicans to come back out,\\u201d said Erick Erickson, a Georgia-based conservative writer and radio host. \\u201cThey\\u2019re not going to stay home in Kemp-versus-Abrams or Perdue-versus-Abrams.\\u201d\", \"Still, Mr. Erickson, an outspoken Trump detractor, expressed concern that a nasty primary could disrupt next year\\u2019s legislative session and deny Mr. Kemp any new accomplishments to run on.\", \"Democrats, who are eager to amplify the opposition\\u2019s discord \\u2014 and to downplay Mr. Biden\\u2019s unpopularity, which is weighing on the party in Georgia as elsewhere \\u2014 can barely contain their glee.\", \"\\u201cAll that Perdue is going to be talking about is \\u2018the election was stolen,\\u2019\\u201d said Jennifer Jordan, an Atlanta-area state senator running for attorney general. \\u201cThe voters in my district, the chamber of commerce Republicans, that is incredibly unseemly to them. You have this guy, Perdue, who had some appeal in the business community, and he\\u2019s basically giving that away because now he\\u2019s just going to become Trump\\u2019s boy.\\u201d\", \"Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University, said she expected Republicans to rally around the party\\u2019s nominee in November. But even if that were Mr. Kemp, she said, Mr. Trump could still be a wild card.\", \"\\u201cIf Brian Kemp won,\\u201d she said, \\u201cwould Donald Trump be disciplined enough to keep his mouth shut in a general election?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ce948e9c56ff11ec8ffe6fdd20e11527"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ce948e9c56ff11ec8ffe6fdd20e11527"}},
