This did not include the council's housing portfolio, forestry holdings or its other investments such as the port and airport.\", \"From 2019 to 2020, landfill emissions increased over 17 percent to reach 34,341 tonnes. Wastewater treatment was a distant second for emissions, peaking at 4728 tonnes in 2020.\", \"Chief executive Mark Wheeler said the rise in emissions during 2020 was unusual.\", \"While it was partly due to growth in the region, it was also due to waste being sent to landfill during the first Covid-19 lockdown without being sorted.\", \"Greenwaste was also sent to landfull during the rebuild of the waste sorting centre which was closed for 18 months after rubbish in a skip caught fire in January 2019, causing significant damage to the centre.\", \"The methane generated by landfill emissions is currently burnt off in an enclosed flame at the Bluegums Landfill in Blenheim.\", \"Consultants have identified better efficiencies to capture more gas and generate electricity at the site; which is currently operating below average for similar systems in New Zealand and Australia.\", \"Wheeler said the council purchases carbon units to offset operational emissions, at one unit per tonne of emissions.\", \"\\\"In 2019 we were able to offset all 29,330 tonnes of CO2 emitted by the Bluegums landfill.\", \"\\\"However, by reducing emissions we can reduce the number of carbon units purchased over time, as the cost of carbon offsets is expected to rise.\\\"\", \"Mayor John Leggett said doing nothing will end up costing more in the long run.\", \"\\\"Council is taking a leadership role to ensure we meet our obligations to reduce carbon and not spend money to offset it. The goal is meaningful change while acknowledging that we still need to run community facilities and ensure that infrastructure is built for future generations.\\\"\", \"In a national context, New Zealand produces an estimated 78.9 million tonnes of emissions per year. Globally, New Zealand is one of the highest emitters per capita but its total emissions are well under one percent of the worldwide total.\"]","href_hash":"cf1f6232896911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cf1f6232896911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
