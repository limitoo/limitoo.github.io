As a physics professor, I am writing to answer his question.\", \"As shown by the American Institute of Physics\\u2019 TEAM-UP report, many groups are heavily underrepresented in physics relative to white men like me, which is bad for physics.\", \"First, it means science suffers from the lack of these groups\\u2019 full energy and talent. Second, the effective teamwork required by world-class science benefits from diverse teams, which are shown to produce more creative and higher quality work. Third, and most important, the current situation is just not right: All of our society should participate in answering humanity\\u2019s most profound questions.\", \"Michael BlantonNew YorkThe writer is a professor of physics at New York University.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"I\\u2019m a freshman in college. The most important thing John McWhorter misses, I think, is encapsulated in the fact that San Diego State University is not just seeking a physicist; it is seeking an assistant physics professor. Are the criteria he lists, which basically boil down to being understanding of and interested in other cultures, necessary to being a physicist? I don\\u2019t know. But I am absolutely certain they\\u2019re instrumental to making a good professor.\", \"I\\u2019ve seen the way my classmates lose interest in curriculum if they can\\u2019t relate to the featured authors. I\\u2019ve felt the shame and anger when my teachers told me that wanting to write about my own identity is too niche, too uninteresting.\", \"Antiracism isn\\u2019t about becoming better at physics. Antiracism is about making sure the kids in that classroom can learn about physics at all.\", \"Phoebe RobinsonMiddletown, Conn.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"John McWhorter is completely right. I\\u2019ve always supported affirmative action, although I also believe that it must be applied with great care, and only in certain contexts. But I rarely discuss the issue, because I am expected to affirm my belief in two contradictory tenets: that affirmative action is vitally important, and that it really doesn\\u2019t much affect hiring and admissions decisions.\", \"William ColeSitges, Spain\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cA Tear-Streaked Face and a Scramble to Help in Maine\\u201d (front page, Nov. 29):\", \"Ellen Barry\\u2019s reporting of a case of domestic violence in Maine is familiar. One in three women have experienced rape, physical violence and/or stalking by an intimate partner in their lifetime. The numbers continue to grow, as the systems in place fail to stem this terror.\", \"Tanya Neal\\u2019s last text before jumping off the bridge was that her boyfriend was right, \\u201cI\\u2019m no good,\\u201d and to me, that is the core of the issue. We must make victims understand that physical violence is not a form of love, but control, and not something they have done to deserve. They need to realize their value, self-worth and what the experience of a healthy relationship looks like.\", \"Efforts to deal with this issue are not working. We need to reach out to charitable foundations with the resources to get the right information out every day. With such a campaign our most vulnerable girls and women can understand that it is not their fault, but something that they have the power to end, and they are not alone. We need to stop this shameful cycle of pain and loss. Knowledge is power.\", \"Midge ColemanHillsdale, N.J.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cG.O.P. Donors Flock to Back 2 Democrats\\u201d (front page, Nov. 22):\", \"Reports of Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema stuffing their campaign coffers with donations from conservative donors is a perfect example of the rot at the heart today\\u2019s politics \\u2014 the stranglehold that big-money donors have on elected officials, Republicans and Democrats alike.\", \"Until we excise this money cancer, little will be done to move toward a more equitable society, or address challenges like climate change. But this will require radical change, like limiting political donations to individuals who reside in the senator\\u2019s or representative\\u2019s state or district. Furthermore, donations should be limited to an amount per donor and per election cycle. Candidates must also abide by this restriction, i.e., no self-funded campaigns.\", \"These changes will force candidates to appeal to a wide range of voters, instead of relying on, and becoming captive of, wealthy donors. Yes, it will be fought tooth and nail by the power elite, but I fear that without a wholesale departure from the current system, today\\u2019s political dysfunction may lead to the loss of democracy itself.\", \"Rick BlumBedford, Mass.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"Re \\u201cWhy Are There So Many Premature Births in America?,\\u201d by Jessica Grose (Opinion, nytimes.com, Nov. 20):\", \"The United States has the highest rate of premature births among industrialized nations. Our premature-birth rate is worse than some nonindustrialized nations. This fact is frankly appalling. Also appalling and directly related is the fact that we are the only industrialized nation without universal health care.\", \"We cannot commit to improving our health care outcomes without first committing to improve our system of providing health care.\", \"Lawrence A.
