Robert Romero, a former project manager for the company, filed the whistle-blower suit in 2016, accusing the firm of inflating repair estimates for the archdiocese and others.\", \"The suit says that FEMA paid the archdiocese $10 million more than it should have to replace a school cafeteria building that only required repairs, and $36 million for two assisted living buildings that the archdiocese said had suffered catastrophic flood damage on the upper floors, when they only sustained wind damage.\", \"The archdiocese had previously denied those accusations but declined to comment on Tuesday on the settlement with the government, which did not require it to admit participating in fraud. The agreement, which was approved by a federal judge as part of the bankruptcy proceedings for the archdiocese, was earlier reported by Nola.com and announced by the Justice Department on Monday.\", \"Xavier previously agreed to pay $12 million to resolve the accusations against it, the Justice Department said, and the lawsuit against AECOM is ongoing. The firm did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday but had previously said it would \\u201cvigorously defend\\u201d its work.\", \"The federal government joined Mr. Romero\\u2019s complaint in 2020 and later added the Louisiana Department of Education as a defendant, accusing it of also misrepresenting damage to obtain fraudulent funds.\", \"\\u201cUnfortunately, when there is government money, there is often fraud,\\u201d said Jeffrey Dickstein, a lawyer representing Mr. Romero who is also a former federal prosecutor. \\u201cAnd when there is a lot of government money, there is a lot of fraud.\\u201d\", \"AECOM has been a FEMA contractor since 1997, according to the company\\u2019s 2007 annual report. FEMA came under significant fire after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita for the extent of fraudulent or improper payments made by the agency, which were estimated to total anywhere from $600 million to $1.4 billion, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.\", \"\\u201cIn the exigency of a catastrophe like a hurricane, there\\u2019s every motivation to say: Get the money out quickly, we cannot have the homeless or people starving and dying in the streets,\\u201d said Seth Kretzer, a Houston criminal defense lawyer who has previously represented clients accused of fraudulent FEMA claims.\", \"Investigations of fraud allegations can take years, and the accused rarely face prosecution. \\u201cCompanies pay these big fines,\\u201d Mr. Kretzer said, \\u201cand none of the executives get indicted.\\u201d\", \"But some emergency response experts worry that issues with fraud have pushed FEMA to be increasingly stringent about relief funds, with a negative impact on disaster survivors.\", \"\\u201cThe folks that made fraudulent claims in New Orleans \\u2014 they don\\u2019t represent the majority of New Orleanians,\\u201d said Laurie Schoeman, a disaster recovery specialist for Enterprise Community Partners, a nonprofit group. \\u201cYet now the majority of people are now having to deal with a cautiousness that wasn\\u2019t there before.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"732bca9a473511ec86b6b916bf4b769a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"732bca9a473511ec86b6b916bf4b769a"}},
