This is particularly critical for wild species, which are quite rare, [and] threatened in nature. So we have to have the long term conservation technique in place.\\\"\", \"She said to understand the importance of this work one only needed to look to Australia, where myrtle rust had caused the extinction of some localised species.\", \"In New Zealand, scientists had already seen the adverse effects of this disease on ramarama, where the species was already disappearing from natural populations. They'd also recently noticed myrtle rust on swamp maire seeds, which meant these plants wouldn't be able to produce seedlings, Dr Nadarajan said.\", \"\\\"If this scenario continues, this will lead to species extinction. Despite the high risk of extinction to New Zealand myrtaceae species, limited information is available on seed biology, ecology, [and] population of most of the species, which is hampering the conservation effort,\\\" she said.\"]","href_hash":"9d962d2653be11ec9d1c071c06609109"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9d962d2653be11ec9d1c071c06609109"}},
