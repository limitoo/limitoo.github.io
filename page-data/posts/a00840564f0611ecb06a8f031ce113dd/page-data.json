Other European nations and the United States quickly followed suit.\", \"\\u201cI do apologize that people took a very radical decision,\\u201d said Tulio de Oliveira, director of the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform and the scientist who announced the new variant on Thursday.\", \"Fresh from a virtual meeting with global health leaders, including Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden\\u2019s top medical adviser on the coronavirus, Mr. Oliveira told journalists he believed that international solidarity would be in favor of South Africa\\u2019s decision to publicize its findings.\", \"The variant, dubbed Omicron by the World Health Organization, has been detected in 22 patients in South Africa. In neighboring Botswana, four cases of the new variant were found. The government announced that the four cases were all foreign diplomats who had since left, and that contact tracing was continuing.\", \"The economies of South Africa and Botswana are reliant on tourists from the United States, Europe and China. South Africa\\u2019s tourism minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, described the temporary travel bans as \\u201cdevastating.\\u201d Earlier this year, South African diplomats and scientists lobbied the British government to lift a previous ban that had already crippled tourism.\", \"\\u201cWe had been on the British red list and we worked our way out of it and with no notification we find ourselves back on the red list,\\u201d Ms. Sisulu told a national television station.\", \"\\u201cPerhaps our scientists\\u2019 ability to trace some of these variants has been our biggest weakness,\\u201d Ms. Sisulu said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re finding ourselves punished for the work that we do.\\u201d\", \"Health officials in Africa suggested that increased screening at points of entry, or even longer quarantine periods, would have been a better alternative.\", \"\\u201cThis will just discourage different countries for sharing information which might be very important for global public health,\\u201d said Thierno Balde, incident manager for the Covid-19 emergency response for the World Health Organization\\u2019s regional office in Africa.\", \"South Africa\\u2019s transparency was criticized by some local officials and businesspeople.
