After 10 weeks, however, the Pfizer booster was just 35 percent effective. The Moderna booster was 45 percent effective at up to nine weeks. (The AstraZeneca vaccine is not authorized in the United States, but the Johnson & Johnson shot uses a similar technology.)\", \"For people who were given three Pfizer doses, vaccine effectiveness dropped from 70 percent one week after the booster to 45 percent after 10 weeks. Pfizer recipients who received a Moderna booster, on the other hand, seemed to fare better; their vaccine regimen remained up to 75 percent effective at up to nine weeks.\", \"The report, which was based on an analysis of about 148,000 Delta cases and 68,000 Omicron cases, also included recent data suggesting that Omicron infections are less likely to lead to hospitalizations than Delta infections. The findings should be interpreted cautiously, the agency noted, because there have still not been many Omicron cases, relatively speaking, and the people who have contracted the variant may not be representative of the broader population.\", \"The Biden administration has been encouraging all eligible Americans to receive booster shots as Omicron spreads.\", \"In a recent interview on WCBS-AM, a New York radio station, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the nation\\u2019s leading infectious disease doctor, said that officials were monitoring the effectiveness of mRNA boosters against Omicron.\", \"\\u201cI do think it\\u2019s premature, at least on the part of the United States, to be talking about a fourth dose,\\u201d he said. Israel is weighing whether to give a fourth shot to its citizens.\", \"Some scientists have warned against a fourth shot, noting that there is not yet evidence that it is necessary and that some immune cells might eventually stop responding to the shots if too many doses are given.\"]","href_hash":"5d837ed2644911ecb7298d64c976b77e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5d837ed2644911ecb7298d64c976b77e"}},
