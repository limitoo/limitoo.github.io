He said he traveled to Kenosha to protect businesses from looting during the protests. Two of the men he allegedly shot, Joseph Rosenbaum and Anthony Huber, died. A third man, Gaige Grosskreutz, allegedly was shot by Rittenhouse.\", \"Protests against police brutality began after a white police officer shot Jacob Blake, who is Black, in the back during a domestic disturbance. Blake had been fighting with officers and was armed with a knife.\", \"Schroeder warned that the media played a big part in the case and could potentially mislead jurors.\", \"\\\"This case has become very political. It was involved in the politics of the last election year....You could go out now and read things from all across the political spectrum about this case, most of which is written by people who know nothing,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I don't mean that they are know-nothings.

The judge asked him, \\\"What would you rather do, be here with me or have your nose operated on?\\\" The man responded: \\\"I'll be honest with you, I'm not looking forward to it.\\\" The judge laughed and said he would take it under consideration.\", \"The tenor of Monday's hearing was no surprise to one attorney who has appeared before Schroeder.\", \"Michael Cicchini, a Kenosha-based defense attorney, said the beginning of jury selection can be \\\"a logistical nightmare.\\\" Attorneys are handed seating charts and other paperwork as jurors are led in, and they need time to get organized. Schroeder traditionally spends that time playing trivia with the jury pool until the attorneys are ready, he said.\", \"Rittenhouse contends he fired in self-defense and conservatives nationwide have rallied behind him, holding him up as a bulwark against chaotic protesters and a symbol of gun rights. Others, including liberals and activists, portray him as a domestic terrorist, saying he made a volatile situation worse by showing up with a gun.\", \"Previously, Schroeder's highest-profile case was the 2008 homicide trial of Mark Jensen, who was accused of poisoning and smothering his wife. Jensen was convicted, but appellate courts and the state Supreme Court ruled that Schroeder wrongly admitted as evidence a letter Jensen's wife gave a neighbor saying if anything happened to her Jensen would be responsible.

He then asked for a round of applause for any veterans present.\", \"Cicchini said Schroeder traditionally gives brief speeches about the history of trials to impress upon jurors the importance of their task. On Monday, he referenced the fall of Rome when explaining the system's evolution.\", \"\\\"When Rome fell, the world changed dramatically,\\\" the judge said, before launching into more history about how cases were decided more than 2,000 years ago. He spoke of priests blessing trials in which defendants had to place their hands on burning coals or in boiling water\\u2014if they \\\"didn't come out too badly,\\\" that was a sign from God of their innocence.\"]","href_hash":"c8c9ebb63b5611eca8a7000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c8c9ebb63b5611eca8a7000017025a03"}},
