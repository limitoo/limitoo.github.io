It has been studied and scrutinized by generations of maritime experts, but had never before gone through such a detailed analysis.\", \"The study was led by Calvin Mires, a maritime archeologist and researcher with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Falmouth, Massachusetts; Aiofe Daly, an associate professor at the Saxo Institute at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark; and Fred Hocker, the director of research at the Vasa Museum in Stockholm, Sweden.\", \"They used wiggle-match dating, a form of radiocarbon analysis, and dendrochronology, the study of tree ring growth, to narrow down roughly when the Sparrow-Hawk was built.\", \"The wiggle-match dating indicated that the wood used to make the boat was harvested between 1556 and 1646, according to the study.\", \"The rings on a tree are like the \\\"fingerprint based on the climate of the region in which the tree grew,\\\" Daly said. The ring patterns of the Sparrow-Hawk's wood matched tree-ring chronologies from 17th century southern England, according to the study.\", \"The same techniques were used to study the Vasa, a Swedish warship that went down on its maiden voyage in 1628, just two years after the Sparrow-Hawk wrecked.\", \"\\\"By showing that the ship is built with English timber and is unlikely to be later than the mid-seventeenth century, it indirectly supports the identification,\\\" the authors wrote. \\\"How many other early seventeenth-century English vessels are likely to have been lost in the same place?\\\"\", \"Another clue that the Sparrow-Hawk is from the early 17th century is the oak and elm from which it is constructed, said the Vasa Museum's Hocker, who specializes in the history of shipbuilding.\", \"\\\"That combination of woods is a traditional combination of materials in shipbuilding in England in that era,\\\" he said. \\\"Everything I looked at just screamed 17th century to me.\\\"\", \"Although they have been exhibited publicly in the past, the Sparrow-Hawk's remains are currently in storage at the Plymouth museum.\", \"More scientific study is planned, and Curtin would like to use digital modeling to construct a 3D image of the ship, with the goal of putting it back on public display in 2026, the 400th anniversary of the wreck.\"]","href_hash":"dc1fad10a14311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dc1fad10a14311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
