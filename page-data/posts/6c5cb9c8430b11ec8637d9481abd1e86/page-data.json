It was first seen in mice - those without any gut microbes at all exhibited odd behaviour, shunning social situations and excessively grooming themselves.\\u00a0\", \"Research since then has uncovered various links between the composition of gut bacteria and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), many of which appear causal - for example, when mice were donated microbes from both autistic and neurotypical humans, those who received theirs from the former \\\"socialised less, produced fewer vocal sounds and engaged in more repetitive behaviour\\\", a study in 2019 found.\\u00a0\", \"And autistic kids studied in 2020 were found to lack certain microbes involved in detoxification, leading to a potential \\\"low-grade inflammatory response\\\" in the brain known to occur in children on the spectrum.\\u00a0\", \"The findings have led to novel treatments for autism, such as faecal microbiota transplants and probiotics, which the scientists behind the latest study say are probably useless.\\u00a0\", \"They looked at stool samples of 247 children, 99 of them with autism.\", \"\\\"We found that children with an autism diagnosis tended to be pickier eaters, which led them to have a less-diverse microbiome,\\\" said Yap. \\\"This in turn was linked to more-watery stools. So, our data suggests that behaviour and dietary preferences affect the microbiome, rather than the other way around.\\\"\", \"Only a single bacterial species detected in the study correlated with ASD.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"There\\u2019s been a lot of hype around the gut microbiome in autism in recent years, driven by reports that autistic children have high rates of gut problems. But that hype has outstripped the evidence,\\\" said senior author Jake Gratten. \\\"We are already seeing early clinical trials involving faecal microbiota transplants from non-autistic donors to autistic people, despite not actually having evidence that the microbiome drives autism.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The findings of this study provide clear evidence that we need to help support families at mealtimes, rather than trying fad diets,\\\" said autism Andrew Whitehouse of the University of Western Australia.\\u00a0\", \"The research was published Friday in the journal Cell.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"6c5cb9c8430b11ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6c5cb9c8430b11ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
