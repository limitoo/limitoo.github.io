She's shocked.\", \"A funny video of Swift herself in a post-surgery stupor was shared to the world in 2019 while appearing on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon. The video, which was shot by the singer's mom Andrea, shows Swift getting herself a banana sporting protective eye gear (she had just received Lasik eye surgery.) The video then cuts to the singer in bed eating the banana. Her mother tells her not to fall asleep eating the banana to which the singer responded \\\"I'm not asleep, my mind is alive.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944602/taylor-swift-ama.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A Taylor Swift fan defended the singer in a hilarious video after her doctor said he was not a fan.
