The team has played nine games in the league. It has won nine games in the league. It has won them, in fact, by such a margin that the word \\u201cwon\\u201d does not quite capture it. Barcelona\\u2019s first game ended, 5-0. So did its second. In its third and fourth games, it scored eight.\", \"That was only the start. The next week, it beat Alav\\u00e9s by 9-1. Late last month, it faced Real Sociedad, the one team still vaguely, theoretically, in its slipstream at the summit of La Liga F\\u00e9menina. That finished 8-1. In the middle of all that, it found time to deconstruct Arsenal, the otherwise unbeaten leader of Britain\\u2019s Women\\u2019s Super League, too.\", \"Including its two appointments in the Champions League, Barcelona has played 11 games this season. It has conceded three goals \\u2014 one each to Alav\\u00e9s, Real Sociedad and Arsenal \\u2014 and it has scored a scarcely believable 60. Its coach, Jonatan Gir\\u00e1ldez, has weighed all of that evidence before drawing his conclusion: Barcelona really should have scored more goals.\", \"The natural assumption might be that he is, if not joking, then perhaps exaggerating for effect, but Gir\\u00e1ldez is quite serious. In his mind, it is a simple equation: You just have to place the numbers in proper context. \\u201cWe have generated more than 200 chances,\\u201d Gir\\u00e1ldez said. \\u201cSo if you look at it like that, we have not scored very many.\\u201d\", \"This is a manager\\u2019s job, of course: to demand constant improvement from players, to refuse them the luxury of resting on their laurels, to eschew the very idea of being satisfied. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what coaches are like,\\u201d said Marta Torrej\\u00f3n, the experienced Barcelona defender, \\u201calways wanting more.\\u201d\", \"Gir\\u00e1ldez\\u2019s reasoning, though, is rather more pragmatic. He was promoted to head coach last summer after the unexpected departure of his predecessor, Llu\\u00eds Cort\\u00e9s, only weeks after the club had won not just the Spanish league and its domestic cup but also its first Champions League title, crushing Chelsea, 4-0, in the final.\", \"Gir\\u00e1ldez, 29, was given the job ahead of a cluster of other applicants \\u2014 at least 20 coaches from around the world speculatively sent in their r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9s \\u2014 essentially as a continuity candidate, someone who knew \\u201cour ideas and our identity,\\u201d as the club\\u2019s sporting director, Markel Zubizarreta, put it.\", \"To Gir\\u00e1ldez, the job is a considerable privilege and a constant pressure. Barcelona, now the foremost team in women\\u2019s soccer, has standards to maintain and expectations to meet. He does not ask for more from his players out of rote instinct; he does it because he knows that what appears to be a slight fissure at this stage of the season could prove a fatal fault line later on.\", \"\\u201cWe have conceded two goals from set pieces this season,\\u201d Gir\\u00e1ldez said. (The third, scored by Real Sociedad\\u2019s Sanni Franssi, came from a counterattack.) \\u201cOne from a corner, one from a free kick. When you win a game, 8-1, that goes unnoticed, but we have to improve that, because when we play in the final rounds of the Champions League, against Lyon or Paris St.-Germain or Wolfsburg, that action could send us home.\", \"\\u201cIf we have 25 chances in a game, the goalkeeper saves 13, and 12 go wide. In a more balanced game, we would not have so many chances, so we have to make sure we take more of them. We have to work out why we did not score more goals: We got nine against Alav\\u00e9s, but I had the sensation that we could have scored 15. Why didn\\u2019t we?\\u201d\", \"It is important, he quickly adds, to recognize that it is very hard to score eight goals in a game, to appreciate and to celebrate that. And then demand even better.\", \"\\u201cYou can win, 8-0, and still have a lot of things to improve,\\u201d Gir\\u00e1ldez said. \\u201cMy job is to detect what we have done badly and modify it. It is about improving every detail.\\u201d\", \"Those details are not easy to find at Barcelona, not these days. In the eight years since Torrej\\u00f3n joined the club, it has changed almost beyond recognition. \\u201cIt is like a different place,\\u201d she said. \\u201cFrom zero to 100.\\u201d\", \"When Torrej\\u00f3n arrived, training sessions still took place in the evening, because the players either attended college or went to work during the day. Already a fixture on Spain\\u2019s national team back then, she had joined on the promise that Barcelona would turn professional. There was talk of significant investment, attracting a sponsor, building a winning team.\", \"When the move came, in 2015, it felt \\u201clike luxury,\\u201d Torrej\\u00f3n said: arriving at Barcelona\\u2019s training complex in the morning, having breakfast together as a team, enjoying access to the club\\u2019s medical services and its conditioning staff and its state-of-the-art facilities. Still, though, \\u201cthinking about winning the Champions League was impossible,\\u201d she said.\", \"Barcelona did not choose, unlike many of its peers, to use the financial clout of its parent club to accelerate its growth. \\u201cFor 10 million euros,\\u201d or about $11.5 million, \\u201cyou could buy a team of the best players in the world,\\u201d Zubizarreta said. \\u201cThere are teams out there that are projects based on doing that. Lyon has done it. Chelsea has done it. Manchester City has an English core but they have done it, too.\\u201d\", \"Barcelona, he said, wanted to do it differently. \\u201cThe best thing we can do is be ourselves,\\u201d Zubizarreta said. Instead of upgrading its squad with a patchwork of superstars, it decided to allow the players it had to flourish, to build a team that was \\u201cdistinctively Barcelona.\\u201d\", \"Progress was halting. \\u201cIt is very hard to climb the ladder organically,\\u201d Torrej\\u00f3n said. There was a Champions League semifinal appearance in 2017, but for three years in succession the team finished second in the league to Atl\\u00e9tico Madrid. In that, perhaps, lay the only conceptual difference between the club\\u2019s men\\u2019s and women\\u2019s divisions. \\u201cThe men\\u2019s team not winning trophies to invest in the future would not, maybe, be the best-received news,\\u201d Zubizarreta said.\", \"The reward seemed to come in 2019. Barcelona finished second in the league, again, but qualified for its first Champions League final. It met Lyon, the sport\\u2019s equivalent of the Harlem Globetrotters, in Budapest, and was swept away in the first half.\", \"\\u201cIt was a mirror,\\u201d Zubizarreta said. \\u201cWe could see how far we had to go.\\u201d\", \"As soon as he returned from Hungary, he sought out the club\\u2019s conditioning experts. There was no shortage of talent, but he knew that Barcelona\\u2019s players had to be fitter, faster and stronger to compete with the very best clubs in Europe.\", \"What followed, according to Gir\\u00e1ldez, an assistant coach at the time, was a \\u201cbrutal\\u201d change in the way Barcelona trained. \\u201cWe could improve quickly at the start,\\u201d he said. But the further up the curve the players got, the harder they had to work even for the smallest gains.\", \"That approach became so embedded in the club that it has endured even what might have appeared to be its apogee: the treble acquired under Cort\\u00e9s last season, capped by a destruction of Chelsea in the Champions League final that echoed Barcelona\\u2019s own experience against Lyon two years previously.\", \"And so, even now, Gir\\u00e1ldez can watch his team, champions of everything, scoring five and six and eight and nine against its opponents, with its goal difference \\u2014 in the league alone \\u2014 of plus 52, and ask for more. And not only can his players understand his gentle chiding and detailed tape sessions, but they can also appreciate them.\", \"\\u201cThe secret is that we are competing with ourselves,\\u201d Torrej\\u00f3n said. \\u201cYou compete with your rival for points or for qualification, but with yourself to be better every day, for your place in the team. That is the biggest struggle: with yourself. The coach might always want more, but we do as a team. We are never satisfied.\", \"\\u201cWhy be happy with scoring four when you should have scored eight?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"46fe7bd743b911eca163c5165c84702b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"46fe7bd743b911eca163c5165c84702b"}},
