Two other rioters, Jacob Chansley and Paul Allard Hodgkins were also charged with obstruction and pleaded guilty. They were sentenced to 41 months and 8 months, respectively, for their role in the riots.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950646/capitol-riot-january-6-washington.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich ruled on Friday that an obstruction charge applies to the Justice Department\\u2019s case against Ronald Sandlin and Nathaniel DeGrave. Above, insurrections loyal to President Donald Trump climb the west wall of the U.S. Capitol, Jan. 6, 2021, in Washington. </div>\", \"Defense lawyers have asked other judges presiding over Capitol riot cases to dismiss the same charge on related grounds.\", \"Friedrich also concluded that the obstruction charge covers a broader set of acts than what the defense lawyers contended.\", \"However, on Saturday, Friedrich deferred ruling on whether the same obstruction charge applies in a separate case against Guy Reffitt, a Texas man accused of leading a group of rioters up the Capitol steps to confront law enforcement officers. The judge said it is unclear, based on the indictment alone, what actions Reffitt allegedly engaged in to obstruct the congressional proceeding.\", \"\\\"For this reason, the Court is inclined to defer ruling on his vagueness challenge until the facts have been established at trial and the jury has had an opportunity to consider that evidence,\\\" Friedrich wrote.\", \"A day before Trump's January 6 \\\"Stop the Steal\\\" rally, Sandlin and DeGrave drove to Washington, D.C., with two pistols, knives, a stun gun, walkie talkies, bear mace and paramilitary gear, according to prosecutors. The men pushed several Capitol police officers guarding a door to the Capitol rotunda and went to the Senate gallery, where they wrestled with officers to get inside, prosecutors said.\", \"John Pierce, an attorney for DeGrave, a Las Vegas resident, declined to comment on the ruling. A lawyer for Sandlin, a Tennessee resident, didn't immediately respond Monday to an email seeking comment.\", \"Approximately 700 people have been charged with federal crimes related to the Capitol riot.\", \"Donovan Crowl, an Ohio man charged with conspiring to attack the Capitol with other members of the anti-government Oath Keepers, has asked a different judge to throw out the obstruction charge against him. Applying the obstruction statute to somebody like Crowl \\\"will chill the First Amendment rights of all Americans,\\\" his lawyer, Carmen Hernandez, said in a court filing Monday.\", \"Friedrich's ruling on Friday \\\"mentions the First Amendment only once in passing without addressing whether the defendant's protest activity on January 6 was protected by the First Amendment or the First Amendment implications of stretching the obstruction statutes in a novel manner beyond any application in 100 years of obstruction prosecutions,\\\" Hernandez wrote.\", \"Former President Donald Trump nominated Friedrich to the court in 2017.\", \"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950643/capitol-riot-january-6-2020-election.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">U.S. District Judge Dabney Friedrich ruled on Friday he won't throw out obstruction charges in cases for two men accused of participating in the capitol riots on January 6.
