[There's] not too many players who can command a starting position in two positions and I think he's shown great maturity in the way he's handled that.\", \"\\\"It's given us the opportunity to use him in different roles at different phases in the game, but certainly, this is a game we want to get his hands on the ball early, if we can, and get him running.\", \"\\\"I can't speak more highly of him. He's had a great tour, he's grown quickly as a centre - he's still got some work to do as everyone has, but [I'm] delighted with his progress.\\\"\", \"Lienert-Brown will also undergo a positional shift to face Ireland, moving from centre to second-five, with David Havili sent to the bench.\", \"Foster isn't concerned about his adaptability either, with Lienert-Brown already proving his worth to the All Blacks in the No.12 role - if not the jersey.\", \"\\\"He played 12 two weeks ago against Wales for 25 minutes. I think we often forget the changes in the game.\", \"\\\"He's covered 12 on a number of situations and does so regularly at training.\", \"\\\"We're pretty confident of that.\\\"\", \"Join Newshub for live updates of the All Blacks v Ireland from 4am Sunday.\"]","href_hash":"1702b3ac434111ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1702b3ac434111ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
