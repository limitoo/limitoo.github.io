I used to say borders, you've got to have borders\\u2014we don't have borders\\u2014but we don't have elections and we don't have a free and fair press. So this country has a long way to go.\\\"\", \"Trump also claimed during the interview that the reason the press aren't writing about the \\\"2020 presidential election scam\\\" is because he and his allies are \\\"too close\\\" to proving it.\", \"\\\"They don't want it to be revealed.
