If your first thought was Meryl Streep, you have made both an excellent and terrible choice.\", \"In \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up,\\u201d from the writer-director Adam McKay (\\u201cThe Big Short,\\u201d \\u201cVice\\u201d), two scientists played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lawrence find themselves facing this end-of-the-world scenario and must turn to a United States government led by the fictional President Orlean for assistance.\", \"The good news (for the movie, which will reach theaters on Dec. 10 and Netflix on Dec. 24) is that Orlean is played by Streep, the venerated film and TV star; the bad news (for humanity) is that Orlean is a self-centered scoundrel who cares a great deal about her public image but little to nothing about running the country.\", \"Orlean is one of several malefactors in \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up,\\u201d a social satire that McKay wrote about climate change but that he fully expects will be interpreted as a commentary on the pandemic. The president is also a character whose many faults and shortcomings Streep delighted in bringing to life, and she credits McKay for giving her and her co-stars the latitude to indulge in awfulness.\", \"As Streep explained in a recent phone interview, \\u201cHe never lost heart or confidence in this vision that he had for this thing, which was to make an atmosphere as free as possible for everybody \\u2014 just go nuts and do what you want. But with a deadly serious intent.\\u201d\", \"Here, Streep and McKay explained the steps they followed to put President Orlean in the Oval Office.\", \"Based on what she\\u2019d read in McKay\\u2019s screenplay, Streep said she was already envisioning how President Orlean could have won office. \\u201cYou could imagine a group of various miscreants was pulled together, and she was the least bad of a lot of other candidates that they could have put out there,\\u201d Streep said, adding that she thought of Orlean \\u201cas someone whose elderly husband had a lot of money, and she got rid of him, and it was in California so she got half. She had no real agenda except to have and retain power, and when she got there, she just realized that the job was pretty easy.\\u201d\", \"McKay said that in naming the character, he was thinking of New Orleans \\u2014 \\u201cIt\\u2019s a fun city, but it\\u2019s kind of in jeopardy\\u201d \\u2014 and not the fact that Streep played the author Susan Orlean in \\u201cAdaptation.\\u201d (The notion that he manifested Streep in the role by naming it for her, McKay said, is \\u201cdefinitely not the case.\\u201d)\", \"McKay said he thought of President Orlean as \\u201ca goulash\\u201d of recent chief executives. That meant \\u201cthe self-serving con man aspects of the last president, the dangerous inexperience of George W. Bush, the slick polish of Bill Clinton, the celebrity of Barack Obama and the coziness with big money,\\u201d McKay said. Another inspiration was the finance expert Suze Orman, whom McKay described as \\u201ca brash populist with a strong fashion statement.\\u201d\", \"To that recipe, Streep said she added a dash of the \\u201cReal Housewives,\\u201d whose televised squabbles often play in her house when her daughters come to visit. Though Streep won an Oscar for playing Margaret Thatcher in \\u201cThe Iron Lady,\\u201d she said that performance was instructive only up to a point. Thatcher, she said, \\u201cwielded a kind of femininity that was intimidating to men, and part of her power was how she could pull it together \\u2014 it was very specific to the ladder she climbed there.\\u201d Orlean, she said, is \\u201cmore of our time \\u2014 algorithmically put together.\\u201d\", \"Streep had a hand in devising Orlean\\u2019s fashion sensibility, which she said communicated something essential about the character: \\u201cSo what if she\\u2019s 70 years old and dresses like she\\u2019s 35?\\u201d she explained. \\u201cNo one told her you can\\u2019t be 35 forever.\\u201d That meant attire modeled after TV news anchors who, Streep said, \\u201ctend to pick these broad swaths of bright, happy colors to put on themselves \\u2014 no prints, no polka dots or plaids or, God forbid, florals. None of the things that other people wear. Just these power suits and pencil skirts.\\u201d It also called for a specific hair regimen: \\u201cWhen I was in high school, you\\u2019d set your hair in rollers, then take it out and brush it 100 times,\\u201d Streep said. \\u201cThis is the kind of hair where you take it out of rollers and just leave it like that \\u2014 the longer the better. And then those are sprayed and crisped and the ends curl out in weird ways. And that\\u2019s a thing. It has always escaped me why this was good. So I thought, well, I\\u2019m going to try to that \\u2014 God knows I won\\u2019t do it in my real life.\\u201d\", \"All that advance planning may still not fully prepare you for the demands of the presidency, as Streep discovered on her first day of shooting. She had spent several weeks in isolation, as screen actors have been required to do during the pandemic. Then, on the appointed day, she said, \\u201cI bundled up in my big down coat, put the dog in the back of my car, drove through a snowstorm to Worcester, Mass., and got out at a stadium and parked.\\u201d Once there, Streep said, \\u201cThey tried to turn me away at several points to get into the set. I said no, I\\u2019m in it.\\u201d After getting into hair, makeup and costume, Streep took to the stage where she saw her face on a Jumbotron and heard the delayed echo of her voice as she spoke to a crowd of several hundred extras. \\u201cAnd I just lost it,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI thought, well, I clearly have to retire. I can\\u2019t do this. I actually can\\u2019t do this. It was really a crisis of confidence.\\u201d Needless to say, Streep did find her bearings, but, she said, \\u201cit took a while.\\u201d\", \"As he did on his movies like \\u201cStep Brothers\\u201d and \\u201cAnchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy,\\u201d McKay allowed for some improvisation in \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up,\\u201d and the director said Streep had a talent for extemporaneous dialogue and reactions. \\u201cHer character is almost never bothered by horrible things that people say to her or how horrible she is,\\u201d McKay said. \\u201cShe has an utter shamelessness that could almost be misconstrued as confidence.\\u201d\", \"Streep \\u2014 who had just completed \\u201cLet Them All Talk,\\u201d a Steven Soderbergh movie with entirely improvised dialogue, before filming \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up\\u201d \\u2014 isn\\u2019t immediately thought of as an ad-libber. But she enjoys the process and admires colleagues who can expertly riff. \\u201cActors get a raw deal,\\u201d she said. \\u201cPeople think they\\u2019re dopey. But most of the good actors I know are really, really smart \\u2014 I haven\\u2019t seen their math SATs, but I don\\u2019t care. Being able to pull that brilliance out of the air, really, it\\u2019s a form of writing. It\\u2019s an amazing thing when people are good at it.\\u201d\", \"Despite a successful sojourn into fictional politics, Streep said she harbored no desire to pursue elected office in real life. For one, the experience of waging a campaign, she said, is likely more than she could bear: \\u201cThe cost, since the rise of social media, is so high that you have to be a nun to be elected,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnybody in your family who was in trouble or in jail or anything, your family is offered up on the altar for sacrifice. I can\\u2019t even imagine what that\\u2019s like.\\u201d\", \"Acting, said Streep, \\u201cis the only thing I can do. I could act like a politician, but I wouldn\\u2019t be good at it. I acted like I could play the violin, but I can\\u2019t really play the violin.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"850634363d7a11ecb775000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"850634363d7a11ecb775000017025a03"}},
