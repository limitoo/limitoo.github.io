Her lawyer later confirmed she actually left the phone in an Uber.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Ms. Ponsetto displayed outrageous behavior,\\\" District Attorney Alvin L. Bragg, Jr. said in a statement Monday. \\\"As a Black man, I have personally experienced racial profiling countless times in my life and I sympathize with the young man victimized in this incident.
