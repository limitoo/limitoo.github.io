Ms. Maxwell, a longtime companion of Mr. Epstein, was arrested in 2020, about a year after Mr. Epstein hanged himself in a Manhattan jail cell. He had also been charged with trafficking girls.\", \"Here are some takeaways from the third day of the trial:\", \"Ms. Menninger began her cross-examination with questions about Jane\\u2019s applications to attend the Interlochen summer camp in Michigan. She read from a recommendation that said Jane and her two brothers, who also attended the camp, came from \\u201ca strong, loving family background\\u201d and that they represented the \\u201crebirth of the von Trapp family\\u201d from \\u201cThe Sound of Music.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Menninger read from documentation that said the cost of the camp was over $4,000 per child for the summer, but that Jane and her siblings never applied for financial aid or scholarships for the three summers they attended. Jane said she did not recognize the document but recognized her signature and believed it was her application.\", \"Ms. Menninger used her cross-examination to focus on what Jane told federal investigators in 2019 and 2020 about the sexual abuse she said she faced at the hands of Mr. Epstein and Ms. Maxwell. Ms. Menninger implied that those recounts differed from what she testified about on Tuesday.\", \"\\u201cTwo years later, now you remember that Ghislaine called your home to make appointments?\\u201d Ms. Menninger asked Jane on Wednesday.\", \"\\u201cRight,\\u201d Jane responded.\", \"\\u201cThat memory has come back to you in the past two years?\\u201d Ms. Menninger pressed.\", \"\\u201cMemory is not linear,\\u201d Jane replied.\", \"During her cross-examination of Jane, who is an actress on a soap opera, Ms. Menninger asked Jane two questions: Is an actor \\u201csomeone who plays the role of a fictional character\\u201d and \\u201csomeone who takes lines borrowed from a writer\\u201d?\", \"\\u201cYes,\\u201d Jane replied to both.\", \"Ms. Menninger asked if characters in soap operas had \\u201ctangled interpersonal relationships,\\u201d and if they responded in a \\u201cmelodramatic and sentimental\\u201d way. She asked if Jane had played a number of different characters, including a protective mother, a prostitute, a car-crash victim and someone stalked by serial killers.\", \"Jane answered yes, and quipped, \\u201cNot my favorite story line,\\u201d when asked about her role as a prostitute.\", \"When it was time for a final set of questions from the government, the prosecutor asked Jane if she knew the difference between acting and testifying in court.\", \"\\u201cActing on television is not real and testifying in court is real and is the truth,\\u201d Jane replied. She said that she was not acting on the witness stand.\", \"An ex-boyfriend of Jane who testified as \\u201cMatt\\u201d said Jane told him that she had \\u201ca godfather, an uncle, a family friend-type person who helped her mom pay the bills,\\u201d but never told him what she had to do to get the money. She only said, \\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t free,\\u201d Matt told the jury Wednesday.\", \"Matt said that Jane told him that Mr. Epstein had an adult female friend who \\u201cmade her feel comfortable\\u201d spending time with the financier as a teenager \\u2014 but did not mention Ms. Maxwell by name. It was only after Ms. Maxwell\\u2019s 2020 arrest that Jane confirmed that she was the woman, he said.\"]","href_hash":"70c97c66531f11ec9238950585eca692"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"70c97c66531f11ec9238950585eca692"}},
