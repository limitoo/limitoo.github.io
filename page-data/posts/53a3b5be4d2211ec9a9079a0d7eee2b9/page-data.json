I wanted to make something that was completely mine.\\u201d\", \"In an attempt to recharge, he embarked in 2011 upon a five-week trip to Latin America, from Argentina up through Mexico; everywhere he traveled, he found himself noticing carpets, which were ubiquitous and had been mostly created for tourism purposes. \\u201cAll of them were sized to fit a suitcase,\\u201d he says, \\u201cand in the tourist markets, they all looked more or less the same.\\u201d But one day in La Paz, Bolivia, he spotted an unusual, unexpectedly abstract rug, which appeared as if it had been pleated into a pattern of Art Deco-inflected waves. When he asked about it, the boutique\\u2019s salesperson told him that it was woven by \\u201ca crazy lady in the mountains who never follows the rules,\\u201d he recalls. \\u201cShe said that she had only purchased the carpet because she felt sorry for her. I immediately bought it, and that was the moment I knew I wanted to make carpets.\\u201d\", \"Hefti, 54, shares this story from the dining room table of his 750-square-foot apartment in Brussels\\u2019s Saint-Gilles neighborhood. Despite the flat\\u2019s size, each small, square room \\u2014 a bedroom, a kitchen and a living/dining room \\u2014 resembles an immersive theater set, filled with the designer\\u2019s vibrant custom textiles, from the curtains hanging in several windows that line the front of the Beaux-Arts five-story building to the carpets, which cover nearly every inch of the wooden floors. In the living room, which is dominated by a wildly overgrown dragon tree and a Monstera deliciosa plant, a large, rectangular carpet depicts six huge blue hands throwing and catching lemons. \\u201cFor some time, I kept drawing landscapes [that were] indirectly inspired by all the magical realism I was reading while traveling through Latin America,\\u201d Hefti says. Along with the carpets, the shelves and mantels are lined with ceramic objects, including 1970s-era French tea sets and thickly glazed ceramic sculptures made by his friend the Belgian ceramist Gregory Georgescu.\", \"ALTHOUGH IT WAS South America that inspired his now eight-year-old carpet enterprise, Hefti produces his pieces in Nepal, with two artisanal firms run by descendants of Tibetan exiles who live in Kathmandu. \\u201cThere is always an exchange,\\u201d he says of his manufacturers. \\u201cI propose a design, and we discuss the technical possibilities from there.\\u201d The pieces are sold in the Brussels design gallery Maniera, which is co-owned by two of Hefti\\u2019s friends, Amaryllis Jacobs and Kwinten Lavigne. \\u201cThe rugs are an explosion of color and texture, but they\\u2019re not just about beauty. There is always something disturbing about them,\\u201d says Jacobs, referencing their uncannily lifelike motifs, among them human faces and wild animals.\", \"Most of Hefti\\u2019s creative work is done at his studio in a converted industrial warehouse on the Brussels Canal, but he spends his downtime between his apartment and a place he keeps in Zurich. The designer regularly commutes between the two cities by train, stopping over in Paris to create textiles for fashion houses like Mugler. Switzerland is where he takes care of himself, swimming in Lake Zurich, while Brussels is \\u201cthe interesting, messy place that inspires my work. I meet creative people, have unexpected encounters, work until 11 p.m. and eat French fries for dinner.\\u201d The city\\u2019s avant-garde theater and dance scene regularly influences his work, in particular shows by the contemporary dance troupe Ultima Vez and the performance artists Diederik Peeters and Miet Warlop, both of whom fuse elements of horror and absurdism in their practices.\", \"Late last year, Hefti held his own show at Dries Van Noten\\u2019s gallery, Little House, adjacent to the brand\\u2019s new Los Angeles boutique. In addition to his rugs, Hefti created a surrealistic curtain with facial parts floating in woodlands and poufs upholstered with fabrics pulsating with psychedelic colors, all of which are now installed in his living room. The exhibit allowed Hefti to completely manifest his vision, and was made all the sweeter by the fact that it was facilitated by his mentor. \\u201cI look around now and see that I have built a space of objects that\\u2019s entirely of my own making,\\u201d he says, adding that, despite his recent success, he still thinks of his rugs as \\u201cmonsters on the floor with whom you become friends. They are often the strangest element in an apartment \\u2014 but I have found that the carpets make friends with the rest of the room very quickly.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"53a3b5be4d2211ec9a9079a0d7eee2b9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"53a3b5be4d2211ec9a9079a0d7eee2b9"}},
