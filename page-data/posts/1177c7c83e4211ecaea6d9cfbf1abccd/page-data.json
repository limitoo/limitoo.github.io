He has however taken life insurance which will go to her.\", \"The woman and her partner are both in their forties and expecting their first child together, but she confirmed that they are not married, making it all more complicated. According to the expectant mother, she is currently the highest earner of the pair and pays the bills and mortgage alone as his business is not doing so well. She also has left the house to him in her will.\", \"\\\"He has a lot of family assets so he'll always be okay financially,\\\" she confirmed. \\\"My family is not so well off, so I'm not expecting big inheritances in the future.\\\"\", \"\\\"He's asked today if he can leave everything to our daughter in trust (I work in this field). I said that yes he can, and gently reminded him that I have a big mortgage and on my death he can have the house,\\\" she wrote.\", \"\\\"I know that wealthy people sometimes do this where they leave everything directly to the children, but am I being unreasonable in thinking that he's not considered me at all in this.\", \"\\\"I'm beginning to feel that he's 100% committed to our daughter but not really to me.\\\"\", \"In the U.S., the median inheritance is $69,000, according to the Survey of Consumer Finances, while the median trust fund wealth transfer was $285,000.\", \"It's far from uncommon for family arguments to be caused by it.
