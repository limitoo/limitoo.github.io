It's not an easy threshold for anybody to meet, quite frankly.\\\"\", \"Cheer said it was also possible the statistics reflected inequities in access to quality legal representation.\", \"\\\"It takes a tenacious and really strong lawyer to keep arguing about suppression. Suppressions are supposed to be granted exceptionally, they're not meant to be granted easily. So you do have to make good strong cases to get them.\", \"\\\"Having access to a good lawyer, and being able to pay a good lawyer to do that for you is obviously an advantage.
