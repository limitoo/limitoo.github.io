Steinhardt, the billionaire hedge fund pioneer and one of New York\\u2019s most prolific antiquities collectors, has surrendered 180 stolen objects valued at $70 million and been barred for life from acquiring any other relics, the Manhattan district attorney\\u2019s office said in a statement Monday.\", \"The prosecutor\\u2019s office struck an agreement with Mr. Steinhardt after a four-year multinational investigation that determined that the seized pieces had been looted and smuggled from 11 countries, trafficked by 12 illicit networks and appeared on the international art market without lawful paperwork, the office said.\", \"\\u201cFor decades, Michael Steinhardt displayed a rapacious appetite for plundered artifacts without concern for the legality of his actions, the legitimacy of the pieces he bought and sold, or the grievous cultural damage he wrought across the globe,\\u201d District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said, adding: \\u201cThis agreement establishes that Steinhardt will be subject to an unprecedented lifetime ban on acquiring antiquities.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Steinhardt, a Brooklyn native who turns 81 on Tuesday, is a major contributor to New York University and to numerous Jewish philanthropies. There is a Steinhardt conservatory at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and a Steinhardt Gallery at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.\", \"In a statement on Monday, his lawyer, Andrew J. Levander, said: \\u201cMr. Steinhardt is pleased that the District Attorney\\u2019s yearslong investigation has concluded without any charges, and that items wrongfully taken by others will be returned to their native countries. Many of the dealers from whom Mr. Steinhardt bought these items made specific representations as to the dealers\\u2019 lawful title to the items, and to their alleged provenance. To the extent these representations were false, Mr. Steinhardt has reserved his rights to seek recompense from the dealers involved.\\u201d\", \"According to prosecutors, 171 of the 180 seized antiquities first surfaced in the possession of accused antiquities traffickers, including two who have been convicted in Italy \\u2014 Giacomo Medici and Giovanni Becchina. They said the investigation revealed that 101 of the items, all covered in dirt and encrustations, were visible and identifiable in photographs found in the possession of known traffickers.\", \"Christos Tsirogiannis, an associate professor at the University of Aarhus Institute of Advanced Studies in Denmark, who specializes in searching photographic archives seized from antiquities dealers, said traffickers use such photos to advertise their looted wares to small groups of wealthy collectors. Dr. Tsirogiannis is one of about 60 researchers, investigators and foreign law enforcement officials credited by the prosecutors\\u2019 office with assisting in the case.\", \"As part of its inquiry, Mr. Vance\\u2019s office said, prosecutors executed 17 search warrants and worked with officials in 11 countries \\u2014 Bulgaria, Egypt, Greece, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Jordan, Lebanon, Libya, Syria, and Turkey.\", \"In explaining the agreement not to prosecute so long as Mr. Steinhardt abides by all its terms, Mr. Vance said the arrangement would allow for the items to be \\u201creturned expeditiously to their rightful owners\\u201d rather than being held as evidence. It would also help his office to \\u201cshield the identity of the many witnesses here and abroad whose names would be released at any trial.\\u201d\", \"Nonetheless, the case and other recent seizures demonstrate that the office\\u2019s Antiquities Trafficking Unit is ready to reach far back in time to confiscate objects based on a New York state statute that allows prosecutors to return stolen property to its \\u201crightful owners\\u201d regardless of when a theft might have occurred.\", \"\", \"Mr. Steinhardt\\u2019s dealings with prosecutors over suspect antiquities date back to the 1990s. In 1997, a federal judge ruled that Mr. Steinhardt had illegally imported a golden bowl, known as a phiale, from Italy in 1992. The object, dating to 450 B.C. and costing $1 million, was seized from Mr. Steinhardt\\u2019s home in 1995. The judge rejected his contention at the time that he was an \\u201cinnocent owner\\u201d with no knowledge of irregularities.\", \"In 2018, investigators raided his office and Fifth Avenue home and took away several ancient works they said had been looted from Greece and Italy. That seizure came on the heels of a 2017 seizure of a marble statue stolen from a temple in Sidon, Lebanon, which Mr. Steinhardt relinquished and which has been returned.\", \"The 2017 seizure led to the formation of the trafficking unit, which pressed the case that was resolved on Monday. Officials said the unit has recovered more than 3,000 items valued at $200 million, and that at least 1,500 have been returned to their owners and countries of origin. It said hundreds are ready to be repatriated \\u201cas soon as the relevant countries are able to receive them amid the pandemic,\\u201d and more than 1,000 objects are being held awaiting the outcome of criminal proceedings.\", \"(Separately, in March 2019, Mr. Steinhardt was accused of a pattern of sexual harassment by several women who worked for the nonprofits he supported.)\", \"The confiscated items, which decorated Mr. Steinhardt\\u2019s homes and offices, and which he often lent to major museums, came mostly from Italy, Greece and Israel, according to a list compiled by investigators.\", \"They include:\"]","href_hash":"6b4b2efe570911eca41c0108c04b53da"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6b4b2efe570911eca41c0108c04b53da"}},
