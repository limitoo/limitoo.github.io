Potter was convicted of first-degree and second-degree manslaughter in December.\", \"According to prosecutors, Potter, 49, faces a presumptive sentence of just over seven years under state guidelines. Her attorneys have asked for a lesser sentence or just probation, CBS Minnesota reports.\", \"Wright, a 20-year-old Black man, was pulled over in Brooklyn Center in April for having expired license plate tags and an air freshener hanging from his vehicle's rearview mirror. When Potter, who is White, and another officer tried to arrest him on an outstanding warrant, Wright got back into the driver's seat.\", \"Before Wright drove away, Potter said she thought she grabbed her Taser, but she pulled her gun instead and shot Wright in the chest. While being questioned by the prosecution during her trial, Potter broke down sobbing on the witness stand, telling the court, \\\"I'm sorry it happened.\\\"\", \"Friday's hearing comes a day after the funeral for Amir Locke, a 22-year-old Black man who was shot to death in Minneapolis by a police officer executing a no-knock warrant at an apartment. The shooting is under investigation.\"]","href_hash":"9c04136090c711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9c04136090c711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
