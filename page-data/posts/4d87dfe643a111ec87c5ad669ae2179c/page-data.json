Here’s what is at stake.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-12T10:15:28.000Z","content":"[\"Britney Spears has made no secret of late how she feels about the court-approved conservatorship that oversees her life: She wants it gone. In a complete turnaround, the pop singer\\u2019s father \\u2014 long the official steward of the legal arrangement, often over her objections in public and private \\u2014 has come to agree.\", \"Now, after many months of back and forth, the fate of the conservatorship that has overseen Ms. Spears and her fortune since 2008 rests solely in the hands of a probate judge in Los Angeles Superior Court, where a hearing on Friday may mark the end \\u2014 or at least the beginning of the end \\u2014 in a 13-year saga.\", \"\\u201cThe time has come for Ms. Spears\\u2019s freedom,\\u201d the singer\\u2019s lawyer, Mathew S. Rosengart, wrote in a court filing late last month, emphasizing her desire to end the unique legal arrangement right away.\", \"Lawyers for Ms. Spears\\u2019s father, James P. Spears, who is known as Jamie, put it this way in their own status report this month: \\u201cit is said in no uncertain terms, Jamie believes that the Conservatorship should end, immediately.\\u201d\", \"But it\\u2019s not quite as simple as the apparent consensus on both sides.\", \"Mr. Spears, 69, maintained for years that the arrangement \\u2014 which began when he sought control over his daughter\\u2019s life and business, citing her mental health struggles and substance abuse \\u2014 was not only necessary for the singer\\u2019s health and well-being, but voluntary.\", \"Yet amid a hurricane of courtroom activity and legal filings since June, when Ms. Spears called the setup abusive and exploitative in her first extended public comments on the conservatorship, much has shifted: Ms. Spears, 39, was allowed to choose her own lawyer for the first time since 2008, replacing a court-appointed one. Her new representative, Mr. Rosengart, moved aggressively to oust the singer\\u2019s father from his position of authority over her, with the court suspending Mr. Spears as conservator of Ms. Spears\\u2019s nearly $60 million estate on Sept. 29.\", \"Still, the legal path each side has taken to the same conclusion has been winding \\u2014 with Mr. Spears\\u2019s about-face spurring more questions on his daughter\\u2019s side \\u2014 leaving plenty of unsettled business before the court. Ahead of Friday\\u2019s hearing, which is set to begin at 4:30 p.m. Eastern, here are a few of the major questions that could be addressed.\", \"No one involved in the conservatorship has registered any official objection to ending it.\", \"In addition to Ms. Spears and her father, the singer\\u2019s personal conservator, Jodi Montgomery, has also consented, according to court filings, and has worked with Mr. Rosengart on what he called a \\u201ctermination plan.\\u201d (Ms. Montgomery, a licensed professional, oversees the day-to-day and medical side of the two-pronged legal setup, which consists of Ms. Spears\\u2019s personal affairs and her estate. Ms. Montgomery took over from Mr. Spears on an ongoing temporary basis in September 2019, when he resigned citing health issues.)\", \"But the person who will decide whether to restore Ms. Spears\\u2019s independence is Judge Brenda Penny, who was not responsible for establishing the conservatorship yet has presided over the case in recent years.\", \"Typically in deciding whether to end a conservatorship, a judge will consider whether the conservatee has regained \\u201ccapacity,\\u201d using a psychological assessment and other factors to determine cognitive ability and decision making, including whether they can weigh risks and benefits regarding things like medical care, marriage and contracts. The person\\u2019s ability to feed, clothe and shelter themselves may also be examined.\", \"But Ms. Spears\\u2019s case has been considered largely unprecedented because she continued to work extensively as a performing musician and global celebrity, bringing in millions of dollars, while simultaneously being considered unable to care for herself by the court.\", \"Since June, the singer has been adamant that the arrangement end without her having to undergo additional mental evaluations, and there is no public record of Judge Penny having recently called for one. (According to confidential documents obtained by The New York Times, a court investigator said in 2016 that the conservatorship remained in Ms. Spears\\u2019s best interest despite her ongoing requests to end it, but called for a path to independence.)\", \"Mr. Rosengart noted that in one recent filing, lawyers for Mr. Spears stated \\u201cno less than three times that no mental or psychological evaluation is required under the Probate Code,\\u201d adding: \\u201cMs. Spears fervently agrees.\\u201d\", \"In a since-deleted Instagram caption, Ms. Spears seemed to allude to the possibility that the judge would concur. \\u201cThis week is gonna be very interesting for me,\\u201d she wrote, using emojis for emphasis. \\u201cI haven\\u2019t prayed for something more in my life.\\u201d\", \"When Ms. Spears addressed the court in June, she said she had been drugged, forced to work and prevented from removing her birth control device in recent years while under the conservatorship. She called for those overseeing it to be investigated and jailed, pointing to her father as \\u201cthe one who approved all of it.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cControlling Britney Spears,\\u201d a documentary on the subject by The Times, also revealed that a surveillance apparatus monitored the singer, including secretly capturing audio recordings from her bedroom and accessing material from her phone, according to whistle-blowers.\", \"Her lawyer has since added to those accusations the prospect of financial mismanagement by Mr. Spears and the estate\\u2019s former business manager, Tri Star Sports & Entertainment Group, issuing subpoenas for sworn depositions and extensive records, including payments and communication between the parties, as well as the security firm behind the monitoring of Ms. Spears.\", \"Mr. Rosengart has argued that Mr. Spears\\u2019s sudden desire to end the conservatorship after years of defending its necessity was tied to hopes that he could avoid legal discovery and being deposed under oath.\", \"Mr. Spears hired new lawyers last month, replacing the extensive legal team that had fought for maintaining the conservatorship and his role in it. In the latest filings, Mr. Spears\\u2019s lawyers wrote that their client \\u201chas nothing to hide regarding his administration of Britney\\u2019s estate and will therefore hide nothing.\\u201d\", \"They added that Mr. Spears \\u201csupports, indeed encourages, a full and transparent examination of the Conservatorship and has every confidence that said review will put to rest the outlandish, scurrilous and irresponsible speculation that has accompanied the media circus surrounding these proceedings.\\u201d The filings called Mr. Spears\\u2019s desire to immediately end the conservatorship \\u201cunconditional,\\u201d arguing that the transferring of records and his cooperation with Ms. Spears and her lawyers \\u201cwill occur regardless.\\u201d\", \"Lawyers for Tri Star, in their own filing, denied that the company\\u2019s employees had any control over Ms. Spears\\u2019s medical treatment or security protocols, including hidden electronic surveillance. They argued that the company\\u2019s financial dealings with the estate were approved by the court before the firm\\u2019s resignation from the conservatorship last year.\", \"Even if Judge Penny decided to end the conservatorship on Friday, it is likely that these issues would remain to be addressed at subsequent hearings.\", \"Up to this point, all expenses incurred by the conservatorship \\u2014 including the legal fees of those fighting against Ms. Spears\\u2019s stated wishes \\u2014 have been paid by the singer\\u2019s estate. As the arrangement nears what could be its endpoint, the list of those looking to be compensated is only growing.\", \"The estate\\u2019s financial records for the year 2019 \\u2014 known as the conservatorship\\u2019s \\u201ctwelfth accounting\\u201d \\u2014 are still pending final approval before the court. Other financial matters that remain unsettled include more than $1 million in legal fees sought by Mr. Spears\\u2019s previous representation, from the firms Holland & Knight and Freeman, Freeman & Smiley, plus fees owed to Ms. Montgomery and others who have worked on behalf of Ms. Spears.\", \"Mr. Rosengart, who came on as Ms. Spears\\u2019s lawyer in July, has also begun the process of having his legal fees approved by the court, though he has not yet detailed his exact billings in public court filings. Judge Penny recently authorized payments to the lawyer\\u2019s firm, to be made on behalf of Ms. Spears by John Zabel, the certified public accountant whom Mr. Rosengart backed as a temporary replacement for Mr. Spears as the conservator of the singer\\u2019s estate.\", \"Lawyers for Lynne Spears, Britney\\u2019s mother and an \\u201cinterested party\\u201d in the conservatorship since 2019, are also seeking compensation.\", \"Citing their work on arranging Ms. Spears\\u2019s medical care, the removal of her father from the conservatorship and other steps by Lynne meant to \\u201chelp Britney free herself from what she saw as a very controlling existence,\\u201d two firms have billed $504,000 (applying what they called a 40 percent discount to $840,000 worth of fees) and $146,548, plus expenses, according to recent filings.\", \"But Ms. Spears, increasingly vocal after years of public silence on these matters, has also begun to make her many layers of discontent with those around her known. \\u201cPssss my dad may have started the conservatorship 13 years ago,\\u201d she wrote in another now-deleted Instagram post. \\u201cBut what people don\\u2019t know is that my mom is the one who gave him the idea !!!! I will never get those years back.\\u201d\", \"A separate hearing is currently scheduled for Dec. 8 before Judge Penny regarding the financial and accounting matters.\"]","href_hash":"4d87dfe643a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4d87dfe643a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}},
