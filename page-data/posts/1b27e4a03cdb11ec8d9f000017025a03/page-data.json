cattle.\\u00a0\", \"An errant spark from a grader on a nearby property turned into a wildfire that got away, spreading into\\u00a0the Bulburin National Park.\", \"Once it reached the national park, Mr Coffey knew it was only a matter of time until\\u00a0his property would be affected.\\u00a0\", \"It is the fourth time in the five years that Mr Coffey has lived on his cattle station near Miriam Vale, in central Queensland, that bushfires have spread onto his property from the neighbouring national park.\\u00a0\", \"He said it was not the point of ignition, but the fuel load and lack of management from inside Bulburin that was the cause of his frustration.\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Environmental mismanagement</div>\", \"Mr Coffey\\u00a0estimated\\u00a0about a thousand hectares of his land had\\u00a0been burnt over the past month, with the cost of damages running into the tens of thousands of dollars.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We're no stranger to having to fight fire, it's part of life on the land and what we do,\\\" he\\u00a0said.\\u00a0\", \"Controlling the blazes was a full-time job for Mr Coffey, alongside other rural fire volunteers, and the Queensland Fire and Emergency Service (QFES).\\u00a0\", \"But he said there was a better solution \\u2014 to stop the fires starting in\\u00a0the first place.\", \"Mr Coffey claimed a complete lack of management by the government had\\u00a0led to overwhelming fuel loads, pests and weeds, which inevitably spread\\u00a0onto bordering properties.\", \"\\\"The fuel load needs to be managed,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It risks lives and is causing environmental degradation.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"In a statement to the ABC, a spokesperson from the Department of Environment and Science emphasised that the fires had started outside the national park.\\u00a0\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/50dae32f26597dc79e6f0e69abd1dec5\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

Bulburin National Park is subtropical remnant rainforest, and rainforest is not subjected to scheduled planned burns,\\\" the statement read.\\u00a0\", \"It argued that the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS) \\\"routinely conducts pest and weed control programs,\\\" and that planned burns\\u00a0for fuel reduction was now redundant, due to the level of bushfire activity in the forest since 2017.\", \"But Mr Coffey said evidence of this was thin on the ground.\", \"\\\"Nothing's done\\u00a0[in Bulburin National Park],\\\" he said.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"\\\"And until they

Coffey)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Communication breakdown</div>\", \"Mr Coffey said he had informed the QPWS of the fire once it had spread into the national park, but claimed he never saw QPWS staff assisting to control it.\", \"\\\"QFES said that National Parks had taken jurisdiction of the fire, and when I spoke to National Parks (QPWS) \\u00a0they said it's not their problem and that QFES had jurisdiction of the fire,\\\" he said.\\u00a0\", \"Claims of communication failure between the upper levels of management of the QPWS\\u00a0and local landholders are not new.\", \"Over the Christmas and New Year\\u00a0period in 2019, Injune grazier Brigid Price faced life-threatening bushfires that spread from the Lonesome National Park, after a lightning strike ignition.\\u00a0\",
