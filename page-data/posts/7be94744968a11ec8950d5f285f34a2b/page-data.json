The the last major floods, shown here, were in July 2020. \\nPhoto: RNZ / Sarah Robson\\n</div>\", \"Moerewa and Otiria, near the Bay of Islands, have had a number of floods in the last few decades, most recently in July 2020.\", \"A 150m spillway will be built to take water from Otiria stream. When it rains heavily, 80 percent of the stream can overflow onto nearby land. The spillway will take water that would have otherwise spilled over and divert it safely.\", \"Northland Regional Councillor Justin Blaikie said there's been years of planning work toward the spillway, a lot of engagement, consultation and co-design with the community, and now it's finally ready to be constructed.\", \"\\\"[I'm] immensely pleased. They've been waiting a long time, and they've suffered greatly. I think there's been four or maybe even five major floods in the last 20 years. So the impacts will be great and they've been very patient.\\\"\", \"The second stage will be a new three-span 60m single-lane bridge. Everything should be finished by mid-next year.\", \"Blaikie said Pokapu Road and bridge diverts the natural flow of water toward houses and marae. So the Pokapu Bridge will be decommissioned and a new bridge will be built, capable of handling a one in 100 year flooding event.\", \"The third stage is another spillway and stopbank from the new bridge to direct water to the Waiharakeke River. Work will start on it in December and it should be finished by June 2023.\", \"The works are expected to reduce the risk of flooding by 75 percent.\", \"Local kaitiaki Wiremu Keretene hailed the council for its \\\"true partnership\\\" with hap\\u016b mana whenua. He said locals' knowledge has been incorporated, and they have been involved in discussions and decision making.\", \"More than half of the cost, about $2.8m, will be paid for by central government via K\\u0101noa, the Regional Economic Development and Investment Unit. Another $1.6m will be paid by the Northland Regional Council and the balance - about $600,000 - will be covered by a local rate on 2300 properties in the affected area.\"]","href_hash":"7be94744968a11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7be94744968a11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
