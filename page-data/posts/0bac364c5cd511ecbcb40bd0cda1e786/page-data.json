Now, itâ€™s an unholy rush.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-14T11:58:10.000Z","content":"[\"Last month, for the first time in two years, I went to a play. Afterward, on the street, I spotted an acquaintance and felt an unexpected wave of elation. A person whom I knew, hadn\\u2019t thought of in months, and did not make plans to see, stood in front of me.\", \"En route to a hug, I gave an accidental nudge to the man he was talking to, his boss, causing the whole group to turn around, but I didn\\u2019t care. It was a run-in! What\\u2019s more, my dates to the play, my colleagues, all had run-ins with former co-workers and friends as the lingering theater crowd spilled into the street on this unusually warm fall night.\", \"\\u201cCan you believe this?\\u201d I said, gesturing at the murmuring group. \\u201cWhat are the odds?!\\u201d\", \"Pretty high, actually. We all work in media in New York City. We all went to a play. Hard to imagine a more predictable event. But after breaking the seal on a theatrical outing, and having resumed my twice-weekly commute to the office, I have found myself reveling in subsequent unplanned face-to-face events.\", \"Over the course of the pandemic, isolation has been the route to safety, and any social occasion had to be considered with levels of care usually reserved for presidents or royalty. There is no \\u201cbumping into\\u201d a beloved (or detested) former co-worker when you go to the corner store and back, at most, in a day.\", \"Serendipity went out the window when the privileged renamed their friends and family as \\u201cpodmates\\u201d and took vows of social celibacy to eat a meal indoors. You saw a lot of your loved ones, maybe, and your own face in a video meeting, but not much else.\", \"In other words, it was all main characters, all carefully curated. But it turns out that side characters are important, too.\", \"Some well-known research on the people we don\\u2019t care about comes from Mark Granovetter, a Stanford sociology professor. In 1973, he wrote about the importance of \\u201cweak ties,\\u201d looking, at one point, at how people get information about potential new jobs from near-strangers as opposed to close friends.\", \"Most, he found, heard about a new job through people they saw occasionally (55.7 percent) or rarely (27.8 percent.) \\u201cChance meetings or mutual friends operated to reactivate such ties,\\u201d Professor Granovetter wrote. \\u201cIt is remarkable that people receive crucial information from people whose existences they have forgotten.\\u201d\", \"It was his conclusion that there is a paradox in how we think about the people closest to us, and those we don\\u2019t think about at all: Weak ties are \\u201cindispensable\\u201d in a person\\u2019s place in their community while \\u201cstrong ties, breeding local cohesion, lead to overall fragmentation.\\u201d\", \"How, then, can we make sense of weak ties in a pandemic? When Saeed Jones, a poet and writer, moved from New York City to Columbus, Ohio, in the fall of 2019, he did not imagine that his next trip back wouldn\\u2019t be for two years, until this fall.\", \"Running into neighbors in Columbus became normal, he said; bumping into old friends or acquaintances in New York feels very different. \\u201cIt\\u2019s so complicated,\\u201d he said in a phone call. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a joy and a gratitude, like, \\u2018Oh it\\u2019s back, I\\u2019m running into friends in the street.\\u2019 But it\\u2019s bittersweet.\\u201d\", \"These tiny, confusing encounters \\u2014 \\u201cyour brain just glitches\\u201d \\u2014 make Mr. Jones aware of how much has changed. \\u201cAs a social person, I feel bereft. I feel how acutely small our lives have had to be to survive.\\u201d\", \"Others have felt only elation. \\u201cI went to a party recently and met someone I had internet known for years, and it felt like a miracle,\\u201d said Emily Gould, a novelist. \\u201cThe dopamine carried me for days.\\u201d\", \"The comedian Josh Gondelman, who has tweeted about missing run-ins \\u2014 \\u201cSometimes you don\\u2019t need a whole phone call or carefully orchestrated hangout. You just want that 90 seconds of proving to each other you\\u2019re both still alive\\u201d \\u2014 said over email that the pandemic has made surprises mostly a negative experience, so having a happy accident is a novelty.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve also been enjoying chance encounters with random weirdos,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cMy ticket for the Amtrak home from Thanksgiving got messed up, and the conductor said he was going to \\u2018hatch a crazy scheme\\u2019 to find me a seat. Anything unexpected and delightful has been such a thrill.\\u201d\", \"Sloane Crosley, an essayist and novelist said that during the pandemic \\u201ca lot of us were living in one-woman shows, performed seven nights a week. No intermission. It\\u2019s nice to be in an ensemble cast again, to see all the players, good and bad.\\u201d.\", \"Ah yes, the bad. Weirdly, my brain doesn\\u2019t bother to register whether I like the person that I\\u2019m running into; I am just so happy to see a familiar face. It\\u2019s like if Seinfeld and Newman hugged first, yelled later. At the very least, running into someone you don\\u2019t like gives you something to take back to the group chat; like a magpie, building a nest from the scraps of gossip, I\\u2019d do anything to stop talking about my own dumb life.\", \"For Mr. Jones, who said he also had a few instances of warm greetings for people and then remembers their actual \\u201cruptured\\u201d relationship, the disconnect is part and parcel of how alien social interaction has become. \\u201cNo one would admit it, but we had standard phrases and strategies to navigate the nuances of human life,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd we haven\\u2019t had to use those strategies in a long time.\\u201d\", \"Maybe, though, I shouldn\\u2019t be so surprised to love an impromptu street chat now. Finding moments where the vastness of the city retreats, and the place feels like a small village, has always been one of the most fun parts about living in New York. Or anywhere, really.\", \"The summer after I graduated high school, two friends and I got a cheap Eurail pass and went overseas. To pass the time in train stations, my friend Emma and I developed this elaborate ritual where we would position ourselves at opposite ends of the station and walk toward each other through a crowd. When we were about 20 or so feet apart, we would drop our bags. \\u201cEmma Freudddd-en-berger, is that you?\\u201d I\\u2019d shout, \\u201cWhat are you doing here?\\u201d Then we\\u2019d run toward each other for a dramatic embrace.\", \"We\\u2019d do this over and over, sometimes \\u2014 wow, this is embarrassing \\u2014 at the same train station. It\\u2019s hard to explain why we thought this was going to get people to talk to \\u2014 or, please God, flirt with \\u2014 us, but we were unabashedly amused at the idea that two friends could see each other in a different country. The odds seemed genuinely long. Also, we didn\\u2019t have Instagram then.\", \"The future, in all its variants, is unknown. But I fear for further personal social malformation in more lockdowns. My hugging has grown increasingly desperate, and does not correspond to the level of relationship that I have with the people I run into.\", \"While I hope this is relatable, I am not under the illusion that it is normal, especially for people who haven\\u2019t, say, been boxed into houses with small children. Most people still dread the small talk associated with \\u201cweak ties.\\u201d It has been hard to navigate a simple hello with our bodies after so many months of fearing touch or breath.\", \"Ms. Crosley, for instance, has a novel coming out next year that she worked on during the pandemic, in which her protagonist is forced to bump into everyone she\\u2019s ever dated, every night. \\u201cShe thinks it\\u2019s a nightmare,\\u201d the author said. \\u201cI do not.\\u201d\", \"Unfortunately, neither do I.\"]","href_hash":"0bac364c5cd511ecbcb40bd0cda1e786"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0bac364c5cd511ecbcb40bd0cda1e786"}},
