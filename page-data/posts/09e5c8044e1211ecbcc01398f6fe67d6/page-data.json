I have fond memories of a Sesame Street float, a vague recollection of one with Marvel heroes and villains, and I was always in awe of the Superman balloon (It turns out there were three. The last Man of Steel balloon made his final parade appearance in 1987.) \", \"But as a child I never gave a second thought to what a production it must be to pull off a successful parade. A year and a half ago, I started looking for a way to participate. (I first tried to do it last year, but Covid curtailed the length of the parade, the balloons, the volunteers and the onlookers.) \", \"I was brought into the ranks of balloon handlers \\u2014 it almost feels like a whisper network, you need to know someone who knows someone \\u2014 by a former colleague who had marched many times. I told her I was interested in joining in and she helped me become a volunteer on her team this year.\", \"The sign-up process involved uploading my proof of vaccination, watching a training video in the proper care of balloon handling and more. I added a new phrase to my vocabulary: \\u201chandling bone.\\u201d That\\u2019s the device used to hold and tow the lines that ease the balloons down the parade route and, later, to the deflating area.\", \"As a native New Yorker, I\\u2019m eager to take part in such a Big Apple experience, though it\\u2019ll be a long day, thankfully, if forecasts are correct, with mild weather. I need to check in at 7:15 a.m. and will likely not be done until after 12:30 p.m. \", \"My one worry, as a momma\\u2019s boy, was being late to my family\\u2019s Thanksgiving lunch, a tradition which stems from a time when my sister and I worked evening shifts at The New York Times. But I dutifully visited my mother on Wednesday afternoon, asked her to keep an eye out for me on television and promised I would eat plenty when I arrived.\"]","href_hash":"09e5c8044e1211ecbcc01398f6fe67d6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"09e5c8044e1211ecbcc01398f6fe67d6"}},
