Together, prosecutors said, they made around 25 million Swiss francs (over $27 million) by secretly buying controlling stakes in companies and then arranging for those companies to be bought by Raiffeisen or Aduno, a credit card company partly owned by Raiffeisen where Mr. Stocker was chief executive and Mr. Vincenz served as chairman.\", \"For example, in 2007, when Aduno acquired Commtrain, a payments company, the boards of Aduno and Raiffeisen were unaware that Mr. Vincenz and Mr. Stocker held stakes in the company. \\u201cThat was 15 years ago \\u2014 I was young and had no experience,\\u201d Mr. Vincenz told the court. \\u201cI assumed all the bodies involved were doing it correctly.\\u201d\", \"Prosecutors are seeking six-year prison sentences for both Mr. Vincenz and Mr. Stocker and repayment of a total of 25 million Swiss francs. The two men, and five other defendants accused of helping them, have denied the charges.\", \"But it is not just charges of hidden financial interests that are drawing attention to the Volkshaus Theater each day. The testimony generating the biggest headlines involves Mr. Vincenz\\u2019s expense account activity.\", \"Those expenses, prosecutors say, include nearly 200,000 Swiss francs, or more than $216,000, he spent at \\u201ccabarets, strip clubs and contact bars\\u201d as part of what the authorities have described as a \\u201cTour de Suisse\\u201d through Switzerland\\u2019s red light districts. Mr. Vincenz said these were necessary expenses to meet potential clients and business associates.\", \"Other billings include 700 francs (about $750) for a night out with a woman Mr. Vincenz met on the dating app Tinder (he told the court that he had been interviewing her for a job), as well as almost 4,000 francs (about $4,000) for the refurbishment of a room at the Hyatt in Zurich that was damaged during a fracas between Mr. Vincenz and a strip club worker.\", \"Although Mr. Vincenz conceded that some invoices had been mistakenly charged to the company, he said that on the whole his expenses were justified by his business activity. \\u201cI don\\u2019t have the feeling I have done anything criminal here,\\u201d he told the court.\", \"Lawyers for Mr. Vincenz and Mr. Stocker declined to comment. \", \"Mr. Vincenz, who was Raiffeisen\\u2019s chief executive for 16 years, until 2015, was a prominent executive in Switzerland before prosecutors filed charges.\", \"In the Swiss media, he was often referred to as a \\u201cdown-to-earth banker,\\u201d who was well liked, charismatic and a contrast to the image of greedy bankers that prevailed after the financial crisis.\", \"His reputation started to unravel after a Swiss finance blog, Inside Paradeplatz, published an article in 2016 detailing the outside deals.\", \"Switzerland\\u2019s banking regulator, FINMA, initiated proceedings against Mr. Vincenz, although it dropped them after he agreed to resign and abstain from executive positions at Swiss financial institutions.\", \"However, in 2018, Swiss prosecutors opened a criminal inquiry of their own, and Mr. Vincenz was held in custody for over 100 days as investigators gathered evidence. Charges were officially filed in 2020.\", \"Raiffeisen (which is unrelated to Raiffeisen Bank International, based in Austria) declined to comment on the criminal proceedings. But it pointed out that, after an independent review of the bank, a number of \\u201cnecessary changes\\u201d were made in 2018, including the replacement of the company\\u2019s executive management and board of directors.\", \"The verdict will be rendered by the case\\u2019s three trial judges. Sabine Gless, a criminal law professor at the University of Basel, said it was hard to predict how the court would rule. \\u201cMany people think what has gone on is immoral, but the question is whether it is criminal,\\u201d she said.\", \" The trial will extend into March, and a verdict is expected about a month later.\", \"Whatever the outcome, the results could be far-reaching for Switzerland\\u2019s business community. Professor Gless said she expected the trial to affect the kind of business opportunities senior management could engage in.\", \"She said the trial had also triggered a public debate about what sorts of activities could or should be expensed to an employer. A sign of changing attitudes may perhaps be seen in the recent resignation of Credit Suisse\\u2019s chairman, Ant\\u00f3nio Horta-Os\\u00f3rio, whose quarantine-skipping conduct and use of private jets caused an embarrassment for the bank.\", \"\\u201cC.E.O.s ought to align their moral compass to that of today\\u2019s Swiss society,\\u201d Professor Gless said.\"]","href_hash":"4018ce2888d011ecbc31c7423c6bc3f4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4018ce2888d011ecbc31c7423c6bc3f4"}},
