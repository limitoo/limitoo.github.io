She was 82.\", \"Her daughter, Eliza Carthy, also a highly regarded singer and musician, announced the death on Facebook but did not say where Ms. Waterson died. She said Ms. Waterson had been in ill health for some time and was recently hospitalized for pneumonia.\", \"Ms. Waterson had a dynastic influence in British folk, not only for her work with the Watersons but also through her collaborations with the singer she married in 1972, Martin Carthy, himself a pivotal figure in British acoustic music, as well as through her joint albums and concerts with Eliza, their daughter.\", \"She formed the Watersons in 1965 with her younger siblings Mike and Elaine (who performed as Lal), along with their second cousin John Harrison. They were driven by a mission to re-enliven overlooked folk music, particularly from the northern Yorkshire region surrounding their home in Hull, England.\", \"\\u201cWhereas people in other countries are proud of their traditions, somehow here in England we got left behind,\\u201d Ms. Waterson once told the British folk magazine Fatea. \\u201cI think that England has as good a tradition as anywhere else, and I think that we should keep it alive.\\u201d\", \"The Watersons did so without vocal fuss or musical adornment. They largely performed a cappella and always took care to keep their harmonies humble.\", \"\\u201cTo bring the audience in to you, instead of projecting your particular personality out to the audience, that\\u2019s the point,\\u201d Ms. Waterson said in \\u201cTraveling for a Living,\\u201d a 1965 BBC documentary about her group.\", \"Despite her ardor for traditional sounds and styles, she reached well beyond them. Her debut solo album, released in 1996 and titled simply \\u201cNorma Waterson,\\u201d featured elaborate arrangements of songs by contemporary writers like Elvis Costello and Ben Harper. On her final album, \\u201cAnchor,\\u201d a joint recording with Ms. Carthy issued in 2018, she followed a cover of Kurt Weill and Maxwell Anderson\\u2019s \\u201cLost in the Stars\\u201d with \\u201cGalaxy Song,\\u201d a whimsical hymn to human irrelevance co-written by Eric Idle of Monty Python.\", \"To all her performances Ms. Waterson brought unquestioned gravitas, signaled by her deep register and enhanced by a brandy-rich tone and a vibrato that roiled like a surging sea. In an email, Rob Young, the author of \\u201cElectric Eden\\u201d (2010), a history of British folk, likened her voice to \\u201ca hand-thrown clay pot, full of character and texture.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt never sounded trained,\\u201d he added.\", \"Norma Waterson was born into a working-class family in Hull, East Yorkshire, on Aug. 15, 1939. Her mother died when Norma was 8. Ten days later, her father died of a stroke. Norma and her siblings were immediately taken in by their maternal grandmother, Eliza, who had belonged to the Irish Travelers, an ethnic group sometimes referred to as Irish Gypsies.\", \"Their grandmother\\u2019s imaginatively superstitious nature encouraged the children to believe in the sort of supernatural phenomena that can haunt English folk songs. Seven generations of the family had gravitated toward music, and she sang to the children, often and eagerly. \\u201cIt was in the genes,\\u201d Ms. Waterson told NPR in 2001.\", \"The first group that Ms. Waterson formed with her siblings and Mr. Harrison played skiffle music, a blend of American folk music, blues and jazz that became hugely popular in Britain in the 1950s. But they soon switched to the kinds of English folk songs they had cherished in their youth.\", \"In 1965, the Watersons signed with Topic Records, which included them in a compilation titled \\u201cNew Voices: An Album of First Recordings\\u201d before issuing the group\\u2019s debut album, \\u201cFrost and Fire: A Calendar of Ritual and Magical Songs.\\u201d\", \"The album showcased Ms. Waterson on the song \\u201cSeven Virgins or the Leaves of Life,\\u201d which she delivered with an authority that seemed almost otherworldly. The British music magazine Melody Maker named \\u201cFrost and Fire\\u201d folk album of the year.\", \"In that same period, the group ran Folk Union One, a club in Hull that contributed to the folk revival by presenting important artists in the genre like Anne Briggs and Mr. Carthy. After releasing their third album, \\u201cA Yorkshire Garland,\\u201d in 1968, the Watersons split, and Ms. Waterson moved to the Caribbean island of Montserrat, where she worked as a radio disc jockey.\", \"By 1972, she had returned to England, and the Watersons reunited (without Mr. Harrison.). Soon after, she fell in love with Mr. Carthy, who had been issuing his own respected folk albums since 1965. He then joined the Watersons and began releasing albums with them when not playing with important electric folk bands of the time, including Steeleye Span and the Albion Country Band. All those efforts made Ms. Waterson and Mr. Carthy British folk\\u2019s ultimate power couple.\", \"Her profile rose further in the 1990s, when her first album, recorded when she was in her mid-50s. was nominated for Britain\\u2019s prestigious Mercury Prize, alongside albums by young rock acts at the time like Pulp (which won) and Oasis. She continued to release albums either on her own or with her husband and daughter, together billed as Waterson: Carthy. But she became significantly less active in the last decade, following an illness that at one point left her in a coma, after which she had to learn to walk and talk again.\", \"Her sister Elaine died in 1998 and her brother Mike in 2011, both of cancer. In addition to her daughter, she is survived by Mr. Carthy and their granddaughters.\", \"Later in life, Ms. Waterson was buoyed by her belief that folk music would last way beyond her, so long as it evolved with the times.\", \"\\u201cWe thought that we\\u2019d all get old and gray and there\\u2019d be nobody left,\\u201d she told The Guardian in 2010. \\u201cThen this new generation of young musicians came up and we all said, \\u2018Thank God.\\u2019 If people say traditional music has got to be \\u2018like that\\u2019 or \\u2018like that,\\u2019 you\\u2019re going to freeze it. You can\\u2019t do that with tradition. You have to hope each generation brings their own thing to it, so it keeps going forever.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3f97e4ea892811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3f97e4ea892811ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
