And he was especially tired of the comments about his weight.\", \"\\u201cYou think you can sit on that chair?\\u201d his classmates would ask.\", \"Other times they were more direct, saying simply: \\u201cYou\\u2019re fat.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSometimes I\\u2019d be so depressed I wouldn\\u2019t eat for three days,\\u201d said Joe, now 25, who was a lineman on his high school\\u2019s football team.\", \"(Joe\\u2019s surname and that of another young person interviewed for this article are being withheld to protect their privacy. Joe is being identified by his middle name.)\", \"He thought about ending his life if the bullying didn\\u2019t stop. Those thoughts eventually became so pervasive that one day he came home from school and took a small handful of pills. But it was enough only to produce a bad stomachache.\", \"Months later, he was still feeling depressed. \\u201cLet me go see a therapist. My head\\u2019s not right,\\u201d he told his father. \\u201cI\\u2019m having these thoughts of killing myself \\u2014 that you\\u2019d all be better without me here.\\u201d\", \"Joe still remembers his father\\u2019s response: \\u201cThat\\u2019s not true. We love you. But you want to talk to somebody and tell someone that? They\\u2019re going to think you\\u2019re crazy.\\u201d\", \"Over the past generation, a mental health crisis has been brewing among Black youths like Joe, one that very few people \\u2014 including Black families \\u2014 have spoken about publicly. Self-reported suicide attempts rose nearly 80 percent among Black adolescents from 1991 to 2019, while the prevalence of attempts did not change significantly among those of other races and ethnicities. Legislators and academics are now pushing for better research to understand why, especially in light of new evidence that suggests Black children may have unique risk factors for self-harm.\", \"One study of high school students, published in September, found that the Black teenagers surveyed were more likely than the white teenagers to have attempted suicide without first having suicidal thoughts or plans. Because suicide screening questionnaires typically ask whether people are having suicidal thoughts or have made plans to hurt themselves, the authors speculated that the questionnaires might fail to identify some Black youths who are at risk of suicide, or that there could be additional factors that might indicate a need for intervention.\", \"More research is needed, but a government study conducted last year suggested that Black children and adolescents who died by suicide were more likely than white youths to have experienced a crisis in the two weeks before they died. They were also more likely to have had a family relationship problem, argument or conflict, or a history of suicide attempts.\", \"Jordan Burnham, who survived a jump from a ninth-story window when he was 18, said that if he had been asked whether he was planning to kill himself that day, the answer would have been no.\", \"\\u201cI couldn\\u2019t even think that far ahead,\\u201d he said.\", \"The fall broke his pelvis, shattered his left leg and fractured his wrist, skull and jaw. It would be four years before he could walk again.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t necessarily want to die,\\u201d added Mr. Burnham, who is now 32 and visits as many as 60 schools a year to speak about suicide prevention and mental illness. \\u201cBut the part of me that had depression and shame and sadness everyday \\u2014 I wanted that pain to die. I wanted that part to go away.\\u201d\", \"On the day of his suicide attempt, he was confronted by his parents about a stash of alcohol that they had found in his car. Although Mr. Burnham was diagnosed with depression as a teenager, he became so good at hiding it that even his own family members, who were loving and supportive, did not fully understand how much pain he held inside \\u2014 or the extent to which he felt like an outsider as one of the few Black students at a mostly white school in suburban Philadelphia.\", \"Suicide and mental illness are often thought of as a \\u201cwhite phenomenon,\\u201d said Michael A. Lindsey, the executive director of the McSilver Institute for Poverty Policy and Research at New York University, who studies the mental health of Black adolescents.\", \"Looking at the raw numbers, it\\u2019s easy to understand why. White deaths by suicide far outnumber those of Black people. But when taking into account youth suicide rates \\u2014 the number of suicides per 100,000 individuals under age 25 \\u2014 a different picture emerges.\", \"\\u201cI think the statistics are shocking,\\u201d said Dr. Lindsey, who was the first to document trends in rising suicide attempts among Black adolescents.\", \"A 2018 study found that while the suicide rate of Black children 5 to 12 was low, it was nearly twice that of white children in the same age group. In one of the most recent examples, a 10-year-old Black girl with autism died by suicide in Utah in early November. Her parents said she had been subjected to racist bullying by her classmates.\", \"Among teenagers and young adults, suicide rates remain highest among whites, Native Americans and Alaska Natives. But while the suicide rate has recently declined among those groups, it has continued to rise among Black youths. From 2013 to 2019 the suicide rate of Black boys and men 15 to 24 years old rose by 47 percent, and by 59 percent for Black girls and women of the same age.\", \"Adolescents of color who identify as L.G.B.T.Q. may be especially at risk of a suicide attempt, according to a national survey conducted by the Trevor Project, a suicide prevention group for L.G.B.T.Q. youth.\", \"Despite the racial disparities \\u2014 and the fact that suicide is the second leading cause of death among all adolescents \\u2014 there has been a dearth of research examining the racial and ethnic differences in youth suicidal ideation, plans or suicide attempts.\", \"This is partly because Black researchers who examine health disparities have been underfunded \\u2014 in March the director of the National Institutes of Health issued a public apology for \\u201cstructural racism in biomedical research\\u201d \\u2014 but also because there are only a handful of academics who study these topics.\", \"\\u201cYou have to bring culture into this, you have to talk about racism, you have to talk about discrimination,\\u201d said Arielle Sheftall, a principal investigator at the Center for Suicide Prevention and Research at Nationwide Children\\u2019s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. \\u201cIt is something that Black youth experience every single day.\\u201d\", \"A report presented to Congress in 2019 identified gaps in research and policy and has resulted in more research dollars flowing to studies related to Black youth suicide, including a program to teach middle schoolers about mental health and a suicide prevention intervention called Success Over Stress, which touches on themes like systemic racism and police brutality to help ninth-grade students at predominantly Black schools develop coping skills.\", \"\\u201cThese kids have stressors that are uniquely different than other kids,\\u201d said LaVome Robinson, the lead investigator of the Success Over Stress study and a professor of psychology at DePaul University in Chicago.\", \"Deaths by suicide are more common among boys than girls overall, but a study published in September found that suicide rates among Black girls increased by an average of 6.6 percent each year from 2003 to 2017 \\u2014 more than twice the increase for Black boys. A diagnosis of depression or anxiety was more common among the girls. Additionally, nearly 20 percent of the girls had engaged in an argument within 24 hours of their deaths.\", \"Denise (her middle name), 19, a high school senior in Cleveland, lives with her mother and six siblings. She struggles with depression and anxiety, largely driven by conflict at home and the lingering trauma of a sexual assault.\", \"\\u201cWhen I told Mom how I was feeling, she didn\\u2019t seem to care,\\u201d Denise said, adding: \\u201cShe said I had nothing to stress about because I\\u2019m a kid.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI just felt like there was nothing nobody could do to change the situation.\\u201d\", \"One evening in September, after a disagreement with her mother, she texted one of her school counselors and told her: \\u201cI don\\u2019t want to be here no more.\\u201d\", \"Her counselor insisted that she go to the hospital to get a psychiatric evaluation.\", \"\\u201cThe first three nights I spent in the hospital, all I could do is cry,\\u201d said Denise, who received her first prescription for psychiatric medication while she was there. \\u201cI just felt relieved that somebody could actually understand what I\\u2019m going through. It felt good to let it all out after holding it in for so long.\\u201d\", \"Suicidal behavior is already a well-known problem in Denise\\u2019s school district, which is about two-thirds Black. In 2019, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that 18 percent of Cleveland high school students had attempted suicide in the previous 12 months, compared with about 9 percent nationally. Many students in Cleveland face chronic stressors, including neighborhood violence and food insecurity. Researchers have found that young people are more likely to die by suicide in high-poverty communities.\", \"Lisa Ellis, a counselor at a high school in Cleveland, developed an eight-week program for first-year students at her school that aims to help reduce the stigma of mental illness, which she sees as a large barrier preventing students of color from getting the help they need.\", \"The curriculum includes videos, like TED talks about mental health, as well as discussions about various mental health diagnoses and healthy coping mechanisms to help students regulate their emotions inside and outside the classroom.\", \"An American Psychological Association report found that only 4 percent of psychologists in the United States in 2015 were Black, even though Black people represent 13 percent of the population. A similar disparity exists among social workers and psychiatrists.\", \"\\u201cThis is a deterrent,\\u201d said Dr. Kali D. Cyrus, a psychiatrist at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., and an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University. Talking about your family\\u2019s business with a white person \\u2014 much less an outsider \\u2014 is often discouraged in the Black community, added Dr. Cyrus, who is Black.\", \"Most mental health care for children takes place in public schools via school psychologists or counselors. This is especially true in low-income districts where other resources are scarce. But these professionals are also in short supply.\", \"Even when mental health professionals are available, research has shown that Black adolescents\\u2019 depression often goes untreated because of negative perceptions of services and providers or feelings of shame about experiencing depressive symptoms.\", \"\\u201cBlack families don\\u2019t typically have literacy in discussing \\u2018feelings\\u2019 with each other,\\u201d Dr. Cyrus said in an email. \\u201cThere is also the strong value of \\u2018keeping your business out of the street.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Ever since Kathy Williams\\u2019s teenage son Torian Graves took his life in 1996, she has been teaching the people in her hometown, Durham, N.C., about the symptoms she missed and the importance of mental health treatment. But the stigma is still strong, she said. Some parents are afraid of being judged and don\\u2019t trust therapists. Sometimes they say: \\u201cJust pray about it. It will go away.\\u201d\", \"Yes, she said, prayer is good. But treating mental illness requires more than that.\", \"After her son died, she found a poem in his room that he had written as a class assignment.\", \"It reads:\", \"Part of me is Carolina Blue,Full of Flavor and Excitement,Like a Wild RollercoasterOn the Loose.But, At times,I\\u2019m mean, dark, lonely,Black, mad at the world,Like a lost dog in the desert,Yet, they are both true,And they are both me.\", \"\\u201cWow, this is the way my child was feeling,\\u201d she recalled thinking at the time.\", \"\\u201cI saw him angry at times and couldn\\u2019t figure out why,\\u201d she said of her son, who was 15 when he died. \\u201cI believe Torian was depressed and we didn\\u2019t know it.\\u201d\", \"To help remove the stigma associated with therapy, Dr. Lindsey has developed a pilot program at five New York City public middle and high schools that recruits Black youths who are experiencing symptoms of depression and enrolls them in therapy with a clinician at a school-based mental health clinic.\", \"When parents are informed that their children have mental health challenges, they often feel as if they did something wrong, Dr. Lindsey said.\", \"\\u201cThe first thing we tell them is this is not your fault, this is not the result of bad parenting,\\u201d he added.\", \"As for Joe, who had been struggling with depression in Boston, he did eventually find a therapist with the help of his mother and his primary care doctor, and started therapy at the beginning of 12th grade.\", \"\\u201cTalking to someone every Wednesday for one hour, it just did something,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt made me feel like a person, like I was wanted.\\u201d\", \"His father and the rest of his family noticed that he wasn\\u2019t as angry anymore.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not that I was crazy,\\u201d Joe said. \\u201cI needed someone to understand what I was going through, to give me a way to deal with it.\\u201d\", \"Now, Joe said, \\u201cI love who I am.\\u201d\", \"This article was produced as part of the USC Annenberg Center for Health Journalism\\u2019s 2021 National Fellowship.\"]","href_hash":"d9a77e5e48a711eca483c36363da073a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d9a77e5e48a711eca483c36363da073a"}},
