The Athletic Commission will be looking into the incident, according to The Associated Press.\", \"The Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said that while they understand that the Clark County coroner ruled Valencia's death as a homicide, they don't expect any criminal charges.\", \"\\\"Although Mr. Valencia's death is tragic, the circumstances surrounding his death are not criminal and no charges will be filed,\\\" the department said in a statement.\", \"Lawyers Ryan Zimmer and Nick Lasso, who represent Valencia's parents, Cynthia and Michael Valencia of Las Vegas, said they will \\\"fully cooperate and share any information necessary\\\" for the Athletic Commission's investigation.\", \"\\\"We will hold those responsible for Nathan's death accountable and ensure that this never happens to another son, daughter, or member of this community,\\\" they said.\", \"Witnesses told Zimmer and Lasso that no emergency medical personnel was present at the event and that participants have been knocked unconscious in the past and \\\"required hospital attention,\\\" the lawyers said.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942891/nathan-tyler-valencia-homicide-charity-boxing-match.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Witnesses told Nathan Tyler Valencia's parents' lawyers, Ryan Zimmer and Nick Lasso, that no emergency medical personnel was present at the event and that participants have been knocked unconscious in the past and \\u201crequired hospital attention,\\u201d the lawyers said.
