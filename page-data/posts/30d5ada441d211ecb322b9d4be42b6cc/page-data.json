Trump to keep secret papers about his actions and conversations leading up to and during the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol by his supporters.\", \"In a 39-page ruling, Judge Tanya S. Chutkan of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia held that Congress\\u2019s constitutional oversight powers to obtain the information prevailed over Mr. Trump\\u2019s residual secrecy powers \\u2014 especially because the incumbent, President Biden, agreed that lawmakers investigating the Jan. 6 riot should see the files.\", \"Mr. Trump \\u201cdoes not acknowledge the deference owed to the incumbent president\\u2019s judgment. His position that he may override the express will of the executive branch appears to be premised on the notion that his executive power \\u2018exists in perpetuity,\\u2019\\u201d Judge Chutkan wrote. \\u201cBut presidents are not kings, and plaintiff is not president.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Trump retained the right to assert that his records were privileged, she added, but Mr. Biden was not obliged to honor that assertion. The incumbent president, she said, is better situated to protect executive branch interests, and Mr. Trump \\u201cno longer remains subject to political checks against potential abuse of that power.\\u201d\", \"The ruling does not necessarily mean that the National Archives will turn over the materials to the House committee investigating Jan. 6 any time soon. The case raises novel issues about the scope and limits of a former president\\u2019s executive privilege authority, and it is likely that it will ultimately be resolved by the Supreme Court.\", \"The Jan. 6 committee has demanded that the National Archives and Records Administration turn over detailed records about Mr. Trump\\u2019s every movement and meeting on the day of the assault, when Mr. Trump led a \\u201cStop the Steal\\u201d rally and his supporters then sacked the Capitol in an attempt to block Congress from certifying Mr. Biden\\u2019s Electoral College victory.\", \"Mr. Trump \\u2014 who pursued a strategy of stonewalling all congressional oversight subpoenas while in office, running out the clock on such efforts before the 2020 election \\u2014 has instructed his former subordinates to defy subpoenas from the Jan. 6 committee and filed a lawsuit seeking to block the National Archives from turning over files from his White House.\", \"Last week, Judge Chutkan, a 2014 Obama appointee, had signaled skepticism about Mr. Trump\\u2019s legal arguments. Mr. Trump\\u2019s lawyer asserted that his residual executive privilege powers meant the courts should block Congress from subpoenaing the files, notwithstanding Mr. Biden\\u2019s decision not to assert executive privilege over them in light of the circumstances.\", \"Mr. Trump\\u2019s lawyer had argued that the public interest would be served by letting Mr. Trump keep the documents secret to preserve executive branch prerogatives. But Judge Chutkan wrote that his arguments did not \\u201chold water\\u201d in light of Mr. Biden\\u2019s support for making them public and Congress\\u2019s need to investigate the attack without undue delays.\", \"Congress and the Biden administration, she noted, \\u201ccontend that discovering and coming to terms with the causes underlying the Jan. 6 attack is a matter of unsurpassed public importance because such information relates to our core democratic institutions and the public\\u2019s confidence in them. The court agrees.\\u201d\", \"Earlier this week, Mr. Trump\\u2019s lawyer, Jesse R. Binnall, demonstrated an intent to keep going by asking Judge Chutkan to impose an emergency injunction on the National Archives barring it from turning over the records while he appealed the matter to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.\", \"Mr. Biden has instructed the head of the National Archives to turn over the first tranche of the materials subpoenaed by the Jan. 6 committee on Nov. 12, unless there is a court order by then blocking him from doing so.\", \"Noting that Nov. 11 is a federal holiday, Mr. Binnall said he wanted to make sure there was an order preserving the status quo by then, and said he would file a request before the D.C. Circuit for such an injunction if Judge Chutkan did not act by Nov. 10.\", \"\\u201cThis case should be decided after thorough but expeditious consideration pursuant to America\\u2019s judicial review process, both before this court and on appeal, not by a race against the clock,\\u201d Mr. Binnall wrote, adding: \\u201cThis is not a game.\\u201d\", \"Judge Chutkan denied that request earlier Tuesday, saying it was premature since she had not yet issued any ruling. But she promised to rule \\u201cexpeditiously in this matter\\u201d and said she would consider a motion for a stay by the losing party at that point.\"]","href_hash":"30d5ada441d211ecb322b9d4be42b6cc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"30d5ada441d211ecb322b9d4be42b6cc"}},
