Jordan and Chanté Adams bring a compelling chemistry to the screen as opposites who fall for each other.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-23T10:56:32.000Z","content":"[\"Jordan Canedy is a wide-eyed baby with excellent lungs at the start of \\u201cA Journal for Jordan.\\u201d At the movie\\u2019s end, he\\u2019s becoming a young man, one with traits that his soldier father, Charles Monroe King, had hoped for when he began writing a yet-to-be-born Jordan advice in a notebook while stationed in Iraq.\", \"In 2006, while on patrol in Baghdad, First Sgt. King was killed by a roadside bomb. Dana Canedy, King\\u2019s fianc\\u00e9 and the mother of their infant son, was then a senior editor at The New York Times. Her 2007 article \\u201cFrom Father to Son, Last Words to Live By,\\u201d led to her to write the elegant book about love, loss and legacy upon which this movie is based, and with which it shares its title.\", \"So don\\u2019t be fooled by that touching title: The journal, in which Canedy added her own stories to King\\u2019s writing, is as much the work of a grieving mother driven to make sure her son knows the love story that brought him into the world as it is a devoted father\\u2019s guide to decency and manhood.\", \"Denzel Washington directs this adaptation (the screenplay is by Virgil Williams) with care, respect and a deep-seated knowledge of the Black love stories that don\\u2019t make it to the big screen nearly enough. The actors Michael B. Jordan and Chant\\u00e9 Adams are similarly attuned, bringing a compelling chemistry as opposites who fall for each other.\", \"In the movie, Dana meets Charles on a visit to her parents\\u2019 home near Fort Knox, Ky. Charles is chiseled, polite and oh-so good looking. He sends a gentle helping of \\u201cma\\u2019ams\\u201d her way. She appraises him. He\\u2019s a 10-and-2 kind of driver. She reaches from the passenger side to blare the horn. Though different, their attraction is palpable. It also helps that they are both single (sort of). He\\u2019s going through a divorce, and she recently ended a relationship.\", \"Michael B. Jordan embraces Charles\\u2019s rigorous ethos as well as his tenderness. Charles might drop for morning push-ups, but he\\u2019ll also bow his head for grace at a restaurant. He travels with push-up bars but also a sketch pad. If Dana sees a flaw, it may be Charles\\u2019s single-minded devotion to his soldiers. She has her own doubts about being a military wife.\", \"Canedy acknowledged her edges (and curves) in her book, and Adams embodies them in her portrayal. When she begins writing her son, Jordan, her anecdotes can be frank, or frisky. She even shares a doozy of an argument, the kind that either breaks up a couple or makes them stronger.\", \"While the movie makes it clear that Dana and Charles are successful, it doesn\\u2019t always get at the labor necessary to get them there, both as a couple and as individuals. While it\\u2019s easy to rely on the shorthand of countless wartime movies to signal Charles\\u2019s ascendancy, Dana\\u2019s own story deserves a few more beats.\"]","href_hash":"f09cbae4642111ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f09cbae4642111ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
