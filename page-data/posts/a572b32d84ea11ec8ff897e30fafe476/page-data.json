Over 22 years, three television seasons and movies on screens big and small, Johnny Knoxville\\u2019s lovable goons have been whacked so often that their orchestra of moans could play \\u201cO Fortuna.\\u201d\", \"In \\u201cJackass Forever,\\u201d the director Jeff Tremaine\\u2019s original cast \\u2014 now solidly middle-aged war horses \\u2014 expands to include younger, more elastic bodies like the rapper Jasper Dolphin (real name: Davon Wilson); an adult man who calls himself \\u201cPoopies\\u201d (Sean McInerney); and the stand-up comic Rachel Wolfson, the franchise\\u2019s first girl, who is dared to lick a stun gun. (The end credits honor the crew\\u2019s old comrade Ryan Dunn, who died in a car crash at 34 in 2011. Another original member, Bam Margera, was fired by Paramount in 2020 for breach of contract. He has since filed a lawsuit claiming wrongful termination.) Knoxville, 50, has said that this will be his final film \\u2014 he sustained a brain hemorrhage from getting flipped upside-down by a bull during filming \\u2014 and his swan song is not for the bashful. Nether regions are pummeled with softballs, hockey pucks, flip-flops and pogo sticks. They\\u2019re bedecked with live bees and painted to look like Godzilla. One willing victim, the performer and punishment glutton Ehren McGhehey, better known as Danger Ehren, is restrained and coated in honey to attract a bear.\", \"\\u201cJackass\\u201d remains the most shocking theatrical experience since the mythic mid-1890s screening of the Lumi\\u00e8re brothers\\u2019 \\u201cArrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station.\\u201d As a test of resolve, it has no rivals. The performers fling themselves into dumb and painful stunts on purpose, and blissfully weak-willed audience members cackle knowing that their laughter is proof that they haven\\u2019t grown up either. Two things continue to hoist \\u201cJackass\\u201d above its legion of imitators, many of whom are now found on TikTok. First, the razor-sharp slow-motion cinematography, which immortalizes writhing men in wet underpants with the devotion of Michelangelo sculpting \\u201cThe Piet\\u00e0.\\u201d Second \\u2014 and more important \\u2014 is the crew\\u2019s friendship, which is evident as they egg on the wounded and apply a healing salve of applause in nearly every scene. Bones get brittle. The heart muscle remains strong.\"]","href_hash":"a572b32d84ea11ec8ff897e30fafe476"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a572b32d84ea11ec8ff897e30fafe476"}},
