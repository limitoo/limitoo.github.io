The budget proposal also calls for increased salaries for both entry level and experienced law enforcement officers.\", \"The budget proposal totals $99.7 billion, which he named the \\\"Freedom First Budget.\\\" He credited the state's financial health to his opposition of COVID lockdowns and mandates.\", \"\\\"Freedom works in Florida. We're proud of that, we're proud of being viewed as a free state, and I think that the economic results are something that have been very, very positive,\\\" said DeSantis during a news conference in Tallahassee.\", \"DeSantis also requested increases in salaries for state employees, allocating nearly half a billion dollars towards it. Moreover, there are $1,000 bonuses for public school teachers and principals and it increases the minimum teacher salary to $47,500. DeSantis didn't request more in tuition and fees at the state's college and tuition.\", \"This is DeSantis' final budget before he is up for reelection. No approval from the Legislature is required.
