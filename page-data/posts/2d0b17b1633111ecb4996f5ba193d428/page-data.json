How exactly are we even using this equipment? We don't have those answers yet.\\\"\", \"The pilot program is the first of its kind for the agency, but it follows a long line of body camera programs rolled out in local and state law enforcement agencies over the past several years.\", \"\\\"My first reaction is, this is long overdue,\\\" said John Amaya, a former ICE deputy chief of staff who served under the Obama administration. \\\"I'm a little underwhelmed by the fact that it's being instituted on such a small scale, but better late than never.\\\"\", \"In August, the Biden administration greenlit the allocation of 6,000 body cameras for U.S. border agents in a massive operational change aimed at \\\"reinforcing trust and transparency\\\" within U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP).\", \"The Department of Justice also announced earlier this year that its federal agents \\u2014 including officers from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, Drug Enforcement Administration, FBI and Marshals Service \\u2014 would be required to wear body cameras when executing search warrants or making pre-planned arrests.\", \"And while the move is largely welcomed by advocates seeking greater transparency in federal law enforcement, experts say the merits of ICE's body camera program will largely depend on its wider implementation.\", \"\\\"The proof will be in the pudding once it's completely rolled out, agency wide to include ERO and HSI,\\\" Amaya said.\", \"\\\"ICE is an agency that is often seen by both sides of the aisle as doing their job poorly,\\\" Amaya added. \\\"There's this sense that no matter what they say, no matter what they do, no matter how transparent they are, it's never going to be enough. So the idea of putting themselves out there has always been one that comes with reservations.\\\"\", \"\\\"There are significant questions around the precise policies that will surround use of body cameras by ICE,\\\" said Jay Stanley, a senior policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union. \\\"The difference between good policies and bad policies is the difference between whether this is something that provides accountability or whether it becomes just another surveillance tool.\\\"\", \"Similar to CBP's body camera program, the contract for the ICE program was awarded to Axon Enterprises Inc., a private technology company led by Ron Vitiello, a former ICE director during the Trump administration. Axon did not respond to CBS News' request for comment.\", \"\\\"If the video remains under the firm control of bureaucracy, then what we will see is what we've seen with police departments that have too much control,\\\" Stanley added. \\\"Video is released when it makes them look good and buried when it doesn't. And that is not something that helps accountability, which should be the primary purpose of body cameras, and what I strongly suspect was Congress' intent when it directed the agency to institute the program.\\\"\", \"CBS News reporter covering homeland security and justice.\"]","href_hash":"2d0b17b1633111ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2d0b17b1633111ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
