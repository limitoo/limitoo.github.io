The article claimed that Kotick was aware of serious sexual assault allegations within the company, despite publically claiming he was unaware of most of them and worked to keep the board in the dark.\", \"In particular, the Journal cited an email sent to Kotick in 2018 in which a lawyer threatened legal action against Activision Blizzard on behalf of their client, a former employee of subsidiary Sledgehammer Games who accused a male supervisor of raping her in 2016 and 2017. The employee also accused the company's human resources department of taking no action after she reported the incidents. Activision Blizzard later settled with the employee out of court, though the terms of the settlement are currently unknown,\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1933539/activision-ceo-bobby-kotick.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Robert Kotick has denied he downplayed allegations of sexual assault at this company.

The WSJ ignores important changes underway to make this the industry's most welcoming and inclusive workplace and it fails to account for the efforts of thousands of employees who work hard every day to live up to their\\u2014and our\\u2014values.\", \"\\\"The constant desire to be better has always set this company apart. Which is why, at Mr. Kotick's direction, we have made significant improvements, including a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate conduct. And it is why we are moving forward with unwavering focus, speed, and resources to continue increasing diversity across our company and industry and to ensure that every employee comes to work feeling valued, safe, respected, and inspired. We will not stop until we have the best workplace for our team.\\\"\", \"Activision Blizzard told the Wall Street Journal that Kotick \\\"reasonably be expected to have been updated on all personnel issues.\\\" The company board also told the outlet that Kotick never attempted to downplay the issue of workplace misconduct and kept it \\\"informed at all times with respect to the status of regulatory matters.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"04a67748471511eca3fd41159d34ad2e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"04a67748471511eca3fd41159d34ad2e"}},
