He said the Hong Kong company was \\\"maligned\\\" and there was still the issue of the outdated aviation medical surveillance system.\", \"An OIA response has revealed CAA spent $208,000 on lawyers and a medical consultant, not including its own internal expenses in the five-year case.\", \"\\\"It's a horrendous amount of money to have spent on something that didn't need to get to get as far as it did,\\\" the pilot told RNZ.\", \"Now retired in Coromandel, he said the CAA was right to look into the allegations, but then went overboard.\", \"The courts found principal medical officer Dougal Watson and its director were \\\"overzealous\\\" in pursuing a misplaced and unsupported view that Lindsay was a narcissist and a possible stalker, and so might deliberately crash a plane.\", \"\\\"If you're not fit to fly, you're not fit to fly, and I have no issue with that,\\\" Lindsay said.\", \"\\\"But they can't pick and choose whose information they take, or how they receive that information.\\\"\", \"Lindsay's lawyer told the CAA he would pursue his concerns over its erroneous processes separately and he was only accepting the costs offer because he wanted the authority to look at overhauling its medical unit and the wider surveillance system.\", \"He said the unit \\\"lacked objectivity\\\" and had performed poorly.\", \"Lindsay said the costs offer did not make a real difference.\", \"\\\"There's no indemnity, there's no damages, there's nothing in there with regards to putting things right.\", \"\\\"The [CAA] director has said that things have changed and things have moved on.

And they actually didn't do their jobs correctly.\\\"\", \"The regulator in Hong Kong, where he was based at the time, was more careful, looking into the case at CAA's instigation. It cleared him and reinstated him promptly, and Lindsay said this was the type of regulator this country needed.\", \"CAA said it did not make administrative decisions lightly, such as pursuing the Lindsay case and \\\"is aware that when this gets challenged, it incurs external costs\\\".\", \"\\\"In this instance it has been confirmed by the court that our approach was not appropriate.
