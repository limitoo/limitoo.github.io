The practice was done to deter migrants from crossing the border.\", \"After the ACLU filed a lawsuit, a judge ordered to end the program. This was six days after Trump signed an executive order halting the policy in June 2018.\", \"There are criticisms against the settlement talks linking migrants increasingly trying to cross the border in the previous year.\", \"\\\"As you can imagine, many Americans think it's a pretty outrageous idea to offer massive taxpayer-funded payments to illegal immigrants who broke our laws, particularly in the middle of a record-shattering border crisis that this administration has created,\\\" Republican Sen.

There are believed to be hundreds, and perhaps as many as 1,000 to 2,000, parents who were separated from their children and still haven't been located.\", \"The settlement talks had been going on quietly for months when The Wall Street Journal reported in October that the Justice Department was considering paying about $450,000 to each person affected. AP later confirmed the figure had been under consideration.\", \"In addition to the payment, settlement talks have also included discussion of granting the families legal U.S. residency and providing counseling services.\", \"Asked about the amount on Nov. 3, Biden appeared to misunderstand the question and said a payment of about $450,000 per person was \\\"not going to happen.\\\" He later said he supported a settlement, without specifying an amount.\", \"\\\"If, in fact, because of the outrageous behavior of the last administration, you coming across the border, whether it was legally or illegally, and you lost your child \\u2014 You lost your child.

He also pointed out that even non-citizens can sue the U.S. government, regardless of their immigration status.\", \"\\\"The truth is that lawyers always settle cases, and it's usually because it's in their financial interest to do so,\\\" he said.\", \"The advocates gave a sense of what a trial might entail, bringing a woman to the call who gave her name only as Leticia and tearfully described having her son taken from her as she sought asylum in 2017. It was 2 1/2 years before they were reunited and she said the boy showed signs of psychological trauma from the separation.\", \"\\\"Even now after being reunited together, we live in fear a day that we could still be separated,\\\" she said. \\\"I could not imagine living through this pain again.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935916/settlement-agreement-us-government-migrant-families.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The U.S. government and families divided at the U.S.-Mexican border have yet to reach a settlement.
