It was midway through Thanksgiving dinner when my phone buzzed with The Times\\u2019s push alert about the new variant. I contemplated not sharing the news with the table \\u2014 better to let them enjoy the meal in peace \\u2014 but I remembered that these were the very people from whom the virus had kept me separated for two years. Here we were, vaccinated and cautiously optimistic, toasting our good fortune at getting to reunite. Here we were, forgetting for a moment that gathering for future holidays was not at all guaranteed.\", \"I told the table about the news alert, and the response was one that many of us have grown familiar with, if not fully accustomed to, this past year and a half: Conversation stopped short and we sat for a couple of beats in silence, each trying to absorb new, confusing information, trying to process, in real time, what it would mean.\", \"Each update about the virus \\u2014 booster recommendations, travel restrictions, a new variant \\u2014 seems to necessitate a mental inventory of plans: plans to go to the movies or out to dinner, to visit friends or family in another state or country, to return to working in an office. Does this mean we will continue to wear a mask in certain social settings? Does this affect my decision enroll my child in an after-school activity? Our minds are like GPS apps, constantly recalculating the route as new traffic data becomes available.\", \"And so uncertainty is normal now. Plans get made and then easily undone. We know to expect the curveball, to beware getting attached to specific outcomes. Does that mean it\\u2019s getting easier? Familiarity isn\\u2019t mastery, but experience is a good teacher. It\\u2019s still tricky to synthesize destabilizing information on the fly, but it\\u2019s possible that, push alert by push alert, we\\u2019re getting better at it.\", \"Keep sending us your catharsis songs and we\\u2019ll compile them into a Spotify playlist. Send them to athome@nytimes.com. Be sure to include your full name and location and we might feature your response in a future newsletter. We\\u2019re At Home and Away. We\\u2019ll read every letter sent. You\\u2019ll find more ideas for passing the time below. I\\u2019ll see you on Friday.\", \"Were you forwarded this newsletter?
