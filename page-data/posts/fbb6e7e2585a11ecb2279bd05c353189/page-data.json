On Labor Day weekend, the couple \\u2014 or rather, their digital avatars \\u2014 held a ceremony staged by Virbela, a company that builds virtual environments for work, learning and events.\", \"Ms. Gagnon\\u2019s avatar was walked down the aisle by the avatar of her close friend. Mr. Gagnon\\u2019s avatar watched as his buddy\\u2019s avatar ambled up to the stage and delivered a toast. And 7-year-old twin avatars (the ring bearer and flower girl) danced at the reception. \", \"How the immersive virtual world known as the metaverse, which few of us understand, will change the traditional wedding is, at the moment, anyone\\u2019s guess. But the possibilities of having an event unfettered by the bounds of reality are interesting enough to consider.\", \"Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, technology is already being incorporated into ceremonies more than ever. Zoom weddings have taken place, and some in-person ceremonies now feature a livestream component for guests who cannot be there. Last year, a couple whose wedding was canceled because of the pandemic staged a (nonlegal) ceremony within Animal Crossing, a popular video game.\", \"Like a ceremony within a video game, though, it is important to note that any weddings that occur solely in the metaverse are currently not legal. (Even virtual weddings by videoconference, which many states allowed during the height of the pandemic shutdowns, have since been outlawed in New York State and elsewhere.) Still, the metaverse will take these virtual celebrations much, much further, experts say, and offer almost boundless possibilities to couples.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s no limitations,\\u201d said Sandy Hammer, a founder of Allseated, which creates digital planning tools for weddings. The company is investing in the metaverse by creating virtual versions of real-world event spaces like the Plaza Hotel in New York. \\u201cIf you really want to do something different, in the metaverse you might as well let your creativity go wild.\\u201d\", \"Think guest lists that number in the thousands. Gift registries that feature NFTs, or non-fungible tokens. Maybe even destination weddings in space.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re going to take their friends on a space rocket,\\u201d Ms. Hammer said, adding that she envisions wedding parties globe-trotting virtually. \\u201cA bride can transport her guests into the metaverse: \\u2018I want my morning session to be in Italy, my evening session to be in Paris.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Nathalie Cadet-James, a wedding planner and designer based in Miami, is approaching the metaverse with \\u201ca beginner\\u2019s mind of excitement,\\u201d and trying to anticipate how her role will change. \\u201cI think my role might be more like a producer or film director,\\u201d Ms. Cadet-James said. \\u201cI could create a set that I\\u2019ve enhanced. Flowers might come out of the ground as you\\u2019re walking into the space. I would add whimsy and fantasy to it \\u2014 because we could.\\u201d\", \"Of course, this would require the skills of a software engineer, a role not in any typical wedding budget at the moment.\", \"The Gagnons had a hybrid wedding of sorts. The couple were married in person Sept. 4 at Atkinson Resort & Country Club in New Hampshire, where they live, in a ceremony officiated by David Oleary, a friend and colleague of theirs ordained by the Universal Life Church, while simultaneously hosting a virtual ceremony in Virbela.\", \"They live-streamed their nuptials for those who could not be there in person. Guests of the virtual ceremony attended via a computer, which required downloading software and then creating an avatar.\", \"[Sign up for Love Letter and always get the latest in Modern Love, weddings, and relationships in the news by email.]\", \"Both Ms. Gagnon, 52, and Mr. Gagnon, 60, work as agents at eXp Realty. The brokerage has embraced virtual work and the metaverse and is part of eXp World Holdings, which also owns Virbela.\", \"Before the couple met in person, their avatars met at a company event in Las Vegas in 2015. And when they announced their engagement in 2019, their co-workers offered to remake Virbela\\u2019s cloud campus into a wedding venue, free of charge. (Ms. Gagnon estimated that it would have cost around $30,000 had they paid for it; representatives for Virbela declined to disclose a price for the event.)\", \"The Gagnons sent pictures of themselves and their wedding d\\u00e9cor to Virbela\\u2019s events team and software engineers, who incorporated personalized details like bird of paradise flowers and images of their in-person venue into the virtual ceremony.\", \"\\u201cThey were able to take my wedding dress and customize it, and take a little flower halo and put it on my hair,\\u201d Ms. Gagnon said.\", \"Patrick Perry, the director of event sales and partnerships for Virbela, said the cost of holding an event in the metaverse \\u201cdepends on what you want,\\u201d adding, \\u201cif there\\u2019s an engineer building out an MGM ballroom or something of that nature, then the cost goes up,\\u201d ranging from a few thousand dollars to well over $10,000.\", \"But, Mr. Perry said, as the metaverse gets built out, \\u201cthere\\u2019s going to be more plug and play assets.\\u201d Wedding couples will be able to select from predesigned venues, flowers, tablescapes, dresses, musical entertainment and other elements.\", \"Virbela was designed to be an immersive platform for organizations to host events and build a sense of community in the metaverse. But users have asked the company to host graduations, bar mitzvahs, weddings and other celebrations. Lately, Mr. Perry said, Virbela has started to explore the wedding market and is in the planning stages with a few couples.\", \"Ms. Hammer said Allseated has not yet worked with a couple interested in having a wedding that only takes place in the metaverse. In addition to the legality of such a ceremony, a hybrid event like the Gagnons\\u2019 is \\u201cmuch more in-demand and realistic,\\u201d she said, \\u201cbecause couples want both in-person and virtual experiences.\\u201d\", \"For Ms. Gagnon, who hired two videographers, one to capture the in-person event and another to simulcast the ceremony to the cloud, the whole point of the metaverse element was the connection it offered.\", \"Her maid of honor, who is ill, was still able to walk her down the aisle, if virtually. And Mr. Gagnon\\u2019s friend, who was unable to attend because his wife has pre-existing health conditions, could deliver his toast. The experience of moving through a virtual world as an avatar \\u2014 a kind of idealized version of yourself \\u2014 creates a more immersive, emotionally satisfying experience than Zoom, said Ms. Gagnon.\", \"\\u201cThere is a different level of connection,\\u201d with the metaverse, she said.\", \"Being a metaverse bride had other benefits, too. \\u201cI\\u2019m always a size 4, even in January,\\u201d Ms. Gagnon said, laughing. \\u201cAnd I never have a bad hair day.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"fbb6e7e2585a11ecb2279bd05c353189"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fbb6e7e2585a11ecb2279bd05c353189"}},
