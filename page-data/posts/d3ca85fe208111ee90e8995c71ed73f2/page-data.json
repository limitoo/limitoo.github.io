So, in this case any other trains in the area were stopped automatically.\\\"\", \"The most recent incident happened just north of Hamilton when the train \\\"stabled\\\" and went a \\\"short distance\\\" past a blocking entry board - equivalent to passing a red signal.\", \"\\\"There were different drivers for each of the incidents and a full investigation is undertaken any time a train passes a red signal. These investigations have not been finalised yet.\\\"\", \"Ashton said KiwiRail took the recent incidents seriously and had fast-tracked getting an Electronic Train Protection (ETP) onto the train.\", \"It is similar to European Train Control System that Auckland Transport trains have, he said.\", \"\\\"[ETP] is an enhancement to the operating system which was in place when the 17 June incident occurred. However, the rail regulator Waka Kotahi has been clear its wants ETSC installed before it will allow Te Huia to travel within the Auckland metro network.\\\"\", \"\\\"We also have a safety case, that allows Te Huia to run, which is approved by Waka Kotahi. It does not require ETCS.\\\"\", \"Ashton said KiwiRail was continuing to work with Waka Kotahi to try and resolve the safety concerns it held, so Te Huia can start travelling to The Strand again.\", \"A regular Te Huia train user - and national coordinator of the Public Transport Forum - said new restrictions would kill the service.\", \"Chris McKellar questioned the fact that Waka Kotahi oversaw the safety and funding of the service.\", \"McKellar also said commuters would stop using the train if they could not go past Papakura.\"]","href_hash":"d3ca85fe208111ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d3ca85fe208111ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
