Due to public upset, Wolf changed his stance saying he'd let district officials decide. But, after most of Pennsylvania's 500 school districts did not impose their own mask mandates, he reinforced the original order.\", \"\\\"Now, we are in a different place than we were\\u202fin September, and it is time to prepare for a transition back to\\u202fa more normal setting,\\\" Wolf said in a statement released by his office.\", \"Pennsylvania Education Secretary Noe Ortega sent a note to school districts and said his department will provide \\\"clarifying guidance\\\" in the coming weeks.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928524/school-districts-are-ready-transition.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf announced that school districts in the state will now decide their own mask mandates.

He said coronavirus cases in his small district have remained low even though mask-wearing has been spotty among students.\", \"\\\"I think schools will shed these mandates rather quickly, and I think that January 17 is about five months too late to return it to a local decision,\\\" he said.\", \"Two pending lawsuits assert the Wolf administration had no legal right to impose the mask mandate. The plaintiffs\\u2014among them, the top leader of the state Senate, President Pro Tempore Jake Corman\\u2014include parents who contend that masks interfere with their children's breathing and cause other problems.
