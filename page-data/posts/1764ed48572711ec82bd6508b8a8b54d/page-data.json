Researchers in South Africa said that their Covid-19 wards were almost unrecognizable from previous phases of the pandemic, with few patients on oxygen machines.\", \"A report from doctors at a major hospital complex in Pretoria, South Africa\\u2019s administrative capital, said that coronavirus patients with the variant were less sick than those they had treated before. Most of their infected patients were admitted for other reasons and had no Covid symptoms. The findings are preliminary, however, and have not been peer-reviewed.\", \"Scientists cautioned against placing too much stock in either the potential good news of less severity, or bad news like early evidence that previous infection offers little immunity to Omicron. The variant was discovered just last month, and hospitalizations and deaths often lag outbreaks considerably. Still, Covid deaths have not yet risen in South Africa despite surging case numbers.\", \"By the numbers: Of the 166 patients with the coronavirus admitted from Nov. 14 to Nov. 29 to the hospital complex, the average stay was 2.8 days, and fewer than 7 percent died. Over the previous 18 months, the average stay for such patients was 8.5 days, and 17 percent died.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"Olaf Scholz will be sworn in tomorrow as Germany\\u2019s ninth postwar chancellor, the first Social Democrat in 16 years to hold the position. He will lead a three-party coalition government with the progressive Greens and the libertarian Free Democrats.\", \"Defying polls and pundits, Scholz led his 158-year-old party from the precipice of irrelevance to an unlikely victory. Now, he wants to show that the center-left can again become a political force in Europe and to further repair the bridge between the Social Democrats and the working class in Germany. Just over 800,000 voters who had abandoned the party for the far left and far right returned in the last election.\", \"Across the E.U., Social Democrats govern in nine of the 27 member states, and lessons from Germany are already proving influential. In France, the Socialist mayor of Paris, Anne Hidalgo, who recently announced her own long-shot presidential bid, has evoked the \\u201crespect\\u201d theme that became the centerpiece of the Scholz campaign.\", \"Background: Once a fiery young socialist who joined his party as a teenager, Scholz has gradually mellowed into a post-ideological centrist. Today he is considered to be to the right of much of the party\\u2019s base, not unlike President Biden, with whom he is sometimes compared.\", \"Cabinet: The incoming German cabinet will, for the first time, have gender parity, with eight women and eight men.\", \"President Biden will attend a video meeting today with Russia\\u2019s leader, Vladimir Putin, in what is most likely the U.S. president\\u2019s highest-stakes leader-to-leader conversation since his term began. The conversation may set the course for Ukraine\\u2019s fate as a fully independent nation.\", \"Biden will tell the Russian president that if he orders his forces to invade Ukraine, Western allies may move to cut off Russia from the international financial system, administration officials said.\", \"In recent weeks, Ukrainians have warned that Russia is erecting the architecture for significant military action, even a full-fledged invasion. U.S. intelligence officials have assessed that Moscow has drawn up plans for an offensive involving an estimated 175,000 troops to begin as early as next year.\", \"Battle plan: If a full-on attack occurs, Ukrainian forces are as ready to face it as they\\u2019ve ever been, a Ukrainian commander said. But without significant assistance from Western countries, specifically the U.S., they will not be able to hold off the Russian military.\", \"The Norwegian archipelago of Svalbard can seem both ethereal and eternal to visitors. But climate change all but guarantees an eventual collapse of its vulnerable ecosystem.\", \"The Times\\u2019s chief film critics, A.O. Scott and Manohla Dargis, put together their lists of the best movies of the past 12 months \\u2014 films that, in the words of Scott, \\u201creward your attention, engage your feelings and respect your intelligence.\\u201d Here\\u2019s a selection from their picks.\", \"\\u201cSummer of Soul,\\u201d a music documentary by Questlove, features performance footage from a series of open-air concerts in Harlem in 1969 along with interviews with musicians and audience members.
