She was very tricky.\\\"\", \"Burel showed plenty of fight and managed to break Muguruza in the opening set, but her own serve was brittle and 12 double faults dug a hole she was always going to struggle to get out of.\", \"The tall Spaniard, who has never lost a first round match in 10 visits to Melbourne Park, came into the net to great effect to go a set and a break up but was broken again when serving for the match.\", \"The 28-year-old broke Burel for a fifth time in the next game to get the job done and moves on to a contest with another Frenchwoman, Alize Cornet.\", \"After losing to Sofia Kenin in the final two years ago, Muguruza took eventual champion Naomi Osaka to three sets in the fourth round last year.\", \"Unless Emma Raducanu reprises her fairytale run at last year's US Open, Muguruza has a reasonably straightforward path to the fourth round, where she could meet another former Melbourne Park finalist in Simona Halep.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"You're always nervous going out there on Rod Laver, which I love, and starting a Grand Slam campaign,\\\" she added. \\\"I'm very happy the way I played and, of course, controlling the nerves.\\\"\", \"In other women's action, former Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova was ousted by Sorana Cirstea for the second successive year at Melbourne Park, the Romanian veteran easing to a 6-2 6-2 victory on John Cain Arena.\", \"Kvitova said she was unsurprised at bowing in the opening round on Tuesday after a difficult month 'down under'.\", \"\\\"I don't think I have much to say,\\\" said Kvitova. \\\"It wasn't really going my way the whole month. That's how it is.
