Pumpkin was the first variety to be associated with the feast, soon joined by other seasonal favorites like apple and pecan. The three work perfectly together \\u2014 creamy, smooth pumpkin, juicy apple and crunchy, candylike pecan \\u2014 each adding a distinct allure. In a perfect world, my Thanksgiving dessert plate would hold wedges of them all, topped with whipped cream and devoured in alternating bites until the last buttery flakes of crust were gone.\", \"I\\u2019ve spent every Thanksgiving of my baking lifetime striving to perfect recipes for these three quintessential pies. But, over the past six months, I\\u2019ve been more methodical about it, building on earlier work and testing my way through different techniques so you don\\u2019t have to (sous-vide apple pie, not a keeper).\", \"There were some tweaks that stuck, like precooking the Ginger Golds for my apple pie and substituting a mix of maple syrup and honey for the corn syrup in pecan pie. And though I\\u2019ve long been a fan of using butternut squash for my pumpkin pie, I improved the roasting method to get the most caramelization and deepest flavor.\", \"Then there\\u2019s the crust. While I\\u2019m still devoted to all-butter dough, I no longer bother parbaking. I\\u2019ve learned that a metal pie pan placed on a hot sheet pan conducts the heat well enough to create a shatteringly crisp, golden-brown crust without having to break out the foil and dried beans. (This doesn\\u2019t work with glass or ceramic pie plates, which aren\\u2019t as good at conducting heat as metal.)\", \"The results of all this testing are three brand-new but still perfectly classic Thanksgiving pie recipes that are the absolute best of their kind. At least until I start tweaking next year.\", \"Have you ever gone to the trouble of slicing, seeding, peeling, cooking and pur\\u00e9eing the flesh of a big orange pumpkin to make a pie \\u2014 only to conclude that, after all that work, it\\u2019s not as good as if you\\u2019d used the pulp from the can?\", \"The reason is a dirty little secret in the canned goods aisle: The pur\\u00e9e in Libby\\u2019s, one the leading supermarket brands, isn\\u2019t made from big orange pumpkins; it\\u2019s made from a variety of squash called Dickinson. (You can watch them being harvested in this video.) Beige-skinned and oblong, they look more like bloated butternuts than anything you\\u2019d carve to make a jack-o\\u2019-lantern.\", \"Though the designation may be misleading, it\\u2019s perfectly legal. According to the Food and Drug Administration, any canned pur\\u00e9e \\u201cprepared from golden-fleshed, sweet squash or mixtures of such squash with field pumpkins\\u201d can be labeled pumpkin.\", \"Meredith Tomason, a senior innovation chef at Nestl\\u00e9 (which owns Libby\\u2019s), said that the Dickinson variety tastes like a cross between a butternut squash and kabocha.\", \"\\u201cButternut squash is a safe bet if you\\u2019re trying to get a similar flavor to Libby\\u2019s at home,\\u201d she said.\", \"All of this means that everything you\\u2019ve heard about canned pumpkin being better than homemade pur\\u00e9e isn\\u2019t exactly true. Yes, canned pumpkin is better than homemade pur\\u00e9ed field pumpkins. (Orange field pumpkins, even the small sugar pumpkin variety, don\\u2019t make great eating.)\", \"But homemade pur\\u00e9ed winter squash is delicious, and a whole lot better than anything in a can \\u2014 sweeter, brighter and fresher. It\\u2019s also a snap to make, especially if you buy a container of peeled, cubed butternut squash.\", \"To get the most flavor, I roast my squash cubes rather than steam or boil them. In the oven\\u2019s high heat, the cubes condense and turn golden, and caramelize at their edges. A sprinkling of sugar and a drizzle of heavy cream aids the cause.\", \"Pur\\u00e9ed with more heavy cream, eggs and spices, roasted butternut squash makes for the best pumpkin pie you\\u2019ve ever had, no pumpkins required.\", \"Although it\\u2019s doubtful that apple pie was served at the first Thanksgiving feast, the tradition of apple pie baking was brought to America with the colonists, who planted apple trees when they arrived.\", \"The earliest apple pie recipes were similar to what we still make today \\u2014 sugared, seasoned apples baked in a crust. In what\\u2019s thought to be the first cookbook published in the United States, \\u201cAmerican Cookery\\u201d by Amelia Simmons (1796), there are two versions of the dessert, one with cooked apples and one with sliced raw apples.\", \"This divide, between cooking the apples before baking and piling raw slices into a crust, was what I focused on when creating my best apple pie recipe.\", \"Most apple pie recipes in the United States today call for raw sliced apples. But once I started precooking, I became a convert, for two reasons.\", \"Raw apples release their liquid into the pie crust as they bake, which steams and pools, making it harder to get a crisp crust, no matter how many vents you cut into the top or how much thickener you add. Raw apple slices also collapse as they bake, creating a gap between the sunken filling and the mounded top of the crust.\", \"Precooking the apple slices helps stabilize them, so they don\\u2019t dissolve into a saucy heap. You end up with glossy, perfectly cooked apples sandwiched in a crunchy, buttery crust.\", \"To get a supple and consistent texture in the filling, use only one kind of apple. You may lose some nuance in flavor, but you gain big in mouthfeel. And if you\\u2019re adding the likes of cinnamon and other spices, you probably won\\u2019t notice the difference between using one kind of apple and several.\", \"I tested pies using Granny Smiths, Ginger Golds (a tangy Golden Delicious hybrid), Honeycrisps and Gala, and all were excellent in their own way. The Granny Smiths were the tartest, but also the softest and most liable to break down. The Honeycrisps and Galas had excellent texture \\u2014 tender but not mushy \\u2014 but were on the sweeter side. And the Ginger Golds split the difference: a little tart, with slices that kept their shape.\", \"You can use any of those apple varieties here, and just balance out the sweeter ones by adding an extra squirt of lemon juice.\", \"Precooking the apples may add a step, but you can do it a few days before baking. This gives you much needed flexibility leading up to Thanksgiving, something every pie-loving cook can appreciate.\", \"Indigenous to North America, pecans had been a staple of Native American cooking for millenniums before European settlers arrived. The nuts made their way into American pies in the 19th century, but it wasn\\u2019t until the 1920s that the pecan pie recipe we know today was popularized \\u2014 by being printed on the back of a can of corn syrup.\", \"Based on a sugar pie, the combination of sugar, eggs and syrup yields a jellylike filling (affectionately called \\u201cthe goo\\u201d) that can be flavored in myriad ways. Whole or chopped pecans, which practically candy in the syrupy mix while baking, add substance and crunch.\", \"The problem with most pecan pie recipes is their toothache-inducing level of sweetness.\", \"This recipe is different. Instead of corn syrup, I use a combination of maple syrup and honey, which makes the mixture less cloying while adding complex earthy and floral notes. Simmering the maple syrup for a few minutes helps concentrate its flavor, making the pie even more intensely maple flavored.\", \"I made another tweak, too. Most pecan pie recipes contain melted butter, but, in my mind, in every pot of melted butter, there\\u2019s brown butter waiting to happen. To make it, just continue to heat the melted butter for a few extra minutes until the milk solids fall to the bottom of the pan and caramelize, turning golden brown. This adds a layer of heady flavor to all sorts of baked goods, pecan pie included.\", \"And finally, there\\u2019s the nut-to-goo ratio. The more nuts you can fit into your pie pan, covered with the least amount of goo to hold them in place, the better the final pie. I don\\u2019t bother toasting the pecans first: They\\u2019ll get somewhat toasty while baking in the pie. But if you love the flavor of deep browned, roasted nuts, consider toasting them for five to 10 minutes at 325 degrees before adding them to the syrup mix.\", \"Of all the Thanksgiving pies I tested, pecan pie holds up the best and is practically as good served the day after baking as it is baked the same day. It also freezes reasonably well. Pop the well-wrapped pie in the freezer for up to a month, then let it thaw at room temperature overnight. The crust won\\u2019t be quite as crisp, but the crunch of all those pecans will more than make up for the lack.\", \"Recipes: Ultimate Pumpkin Pie | Classic Apple Pie | Maple-Honey Pecan Pie\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
