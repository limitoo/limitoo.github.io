Earl\\u2019s more recent releases \\u2014 \\u201cSome Rap Songs\\u201d from 2018; \\u201cFeet of Clay\\u201d from 2019 \\u2014 have represented his music at its most avant-garde, moving through murky, collagelike atmospheres in a constant state of transformation. \\u201c2010,\\u201d though, is more straightforward and sustained, with an understated beat from the producer Black Noise that allows Earl to lock into a hypnotic flow. The succinctly poetic imagery (\\u201ccrescent moon wink, when I blinked it was gone\\u201d) and strangely satisfying plain-spoken admissions (\\u201cwalked outside, it was still gorgeous\\u201d) pour out of him as steadily as water from a tap. LINDSAY ZOLADZ\", \"This song\\u2019s distinctive descending chord progression, dramatic swells and even its lyrics \\u2014 \\u201cthe measure of a hero is the measure of a man\\u201d \\u2014 could make it a James Bond theme. That\\u2019s a sign of FKA twigs\\u2019s overarching ambitions, her willingness to engage carnality and idealism, and how carefully she gauges the gradations of her voice in every phrase. JON PARELES\", \"Call it a meet twee: \\u201cYou leant me \\u2018Nine Stories,\\u2019 while you starred in mine,\\u201d the Australian-born, California-based musician Hazel English sings at the beginning of her ode to every artsy teen\\u2019s favorite J.D. Salinger book. The track is a three-minute dream-pop reverie, obscuring lyrics wryly bookish enough for a Belle & Sebastian song beneath a swirl of jangly guitars and shyly murmured vocals. It\\u2019s also something of an act of nostalgia, finding the 30-year-old conjuring the sounds and memories of her high school days: \\u201cNow that I\\u2019m falling, I can\\u2019t ignore it,\\u201d she sings sweetly, sounding as blissfully crush-struck as a teenager. ZOLADZ\", \"The young Chicago trio Horsegirl is proof that the shaggy-dog spirit of Gen X indie rock is alive and well within a certain subset of Gen Z. Nora Cheng and Penelope Lowenstein\\u2019s overlapping vocals are buried beneath a dissonant avalanche of \\u201cDaydream Nation\\u201d-esque guitars, but enough lyrical imagery comes to the surface to create a strangely poetic impression of their titular character on this stand-alone single, their first release since signing to Matador Records. \\u201cHe washes off his robes in preparation to be crucified,\\u201d Cheng intones, while Lowenstein\\u2019s more melodic vocal line adds additional texture to the song\\u2019s enveloping, shoegaze-y atmosphere. ZOLADZ\", \"On \\u201cTouch. Don\\u2019t Scroll,\\u201d Ben LaMar Gay and Ayanna Woods, two musical polymaths from Chicago, sing about trying to stay connected to each other in an overcorrected world. \\u201cNow, baby, I will never leave you \\u2019lone/Oh, can you hear me or are you on your phone?\\u201d they drone in unison, an octave apart, over a syncopated beat and lightly twinkling electronics. The track is nestled deep within \\u201cOpen Arms to Open Us,\\u201d Gay\\u2019s latest album and probably his most broadly appealing, pulling together influences from country blues, Afro-Brazilian percussion, puckish Chicago free jazz and 2000s indie-rock. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO\", \"\\u201cBet It,\\u201d from the soundtrack to Halle Berry\\u2019s directorial debut \\u201cBruised,\\u201d is only the second solo single Cardi B has released this year. And while it\\u2019s nowhere near as fun or inspired than that previous hit, \\u201cUp,\\u201d \\u201cBet It\\u201d is more like a braggadocios status update on Cardi\\u2019s recent past, taking in her Grammy wins and her memorable Met Gala appearance in a dress with a \\u201ctail so long it drag 30 minutes after.\\u201d ZOLADZ\", \"An impressively feverish turn from Morray, whose 2020 breakout single \\u201cQuicksand\\u201d leaned toward the spiritual. Here, though, he\\u2019s ferocious, rapping with a scratchy yelp and a sense of defiance. He\\u2019s accompanied by Benny the Butcher, who is among the calmest-sounding boasters in hip-hop. An unexpected and unexpectedly effective pairing. JON CARAMANICA\", \"The producer Frank Dukes \\u2014 who\\u2019s made understated, hauntingly melodic work with Frank Ocean, the Weeknd, Rihanna and many others \\u2014 is releasing \\u201cThe Way of Ging,\\u201d his first project under his own name. It\\u2019s an album of beats \\u2014 a beat tape, as they used to say \\u2014 that\\u2019s available for a limited time online, and will eventually be removed from the internet and available only as a set of NFTs. \\u201cLikkle Prince\\u201d channels early \\u201980s electro along with some squelched disco majesty. It\\u2019s spooky and propulsive. CARAMANICA\", \"A rousing and trippy burst of hyperpop mayhem, \\u201cEverybody\\u2019s Dead!\\u201d is a new single from underscores, who earlier this year released \\u201cFishmonger,\\u201d an excellent, scrappy, and puckish debut album. CARAMANICA\", \"The Mexico City sound artist Microhm, born Leslie Garcia, produced \\u201cSpooky Actions\\u201d and its accompanying EP using only modular synths. The result feels like hurtling through a Black Hole, where sound and time warp into quantum dislocation. Ambient textures swirl over the lurch of steady drum kicks, as the moments drip into oblivion. ISABELIA HERRERA\", \"Leon Bridges looks back to Sam Cooke\\u2019s soul; Jazmine Sullivan can go back to the scat-singing of bebop. They trade verses over a slow-motion beat and rhythm guitar in \\u201cSummer Rain\\u201d to evoke endless conjugal bliss, urging each other \\u201cdon\\u2019t stop now,\\u201d for less under minutes of suspended time meant to play on repeat. PARELES\", \"Ibeyi\\u2019s music has always harnessed a sense of ancestral knowledge: The Afro-Cuban French twins grew up listening to Yoruba folk songs that channel the spirit of enslaved people brought to the Caribbean over the middle passage. But their new single, \\u201cMade of Gold,\\u201d featuring the Ghanian British rapper Pa Salieu, trades the simple but potent piano and caj\\u00f3n for a celestial, spectral otherworldliness. Culling references to the Yoruba deities Shango and Yemaya, as well as Frida Kahlo and the ancient Egyptian \\u201cBook of the Dead,\\u201d the duo summons power from intergenerational sources to shield them. \\u201cOh you with a spine, who would work your mouth against this Magic of mine,\\u201d they intone. \\u201cIt has been handed down in an unbroken line.\\u201d HERRERA\", \"Sting\\u2019s new album, \\u201cThe Bridge,\\u201d often harks back to the jazz-folk-Celtic-pop hybrids he forged on his first solo albums in the 1980s; one song, \\u201cHarmony Road,\\u201d even features a saxophone solo from Branford Marsalis, who was central to \\u201cThe Dream of the Blue Turtles\\u201d in 1985. Many of the new songs lean toward parable and metaphor, but not \\u201cLoving You,\\u201d a husband\\u2019s confrontation with the cheating wife he still loves: \\u201cWe made vows inside the church to forgive each others\\u2019 sins,\\u201d he sings. \\u201cBut there are things I have to endure like the smell of another man\\u2019s skin.\\u201d Written with the British electronic musician Maya Jane Coles, the track confines itself to two chords and a brittle beat, punctuated by faraway arpeggios and tones that emerge like unwanted memories; it\\u2019s memorably bleak. PARELES\", \"With patient arpeggios and soothing bass notes, the harpist and composer Mary Lattimore builds a grandly meditative edifice behind Chelsey Coy, the songwriter and singer at the core of Single Girl, Married Girl, in \\u201cScared to Move.\\u201d It\\u2019s from the new album \\u201cThree Generations of Leaving.\\u201d Cale\\u2019s multitracked harmonies promise, \\u201cIn a strange new half-light, I will be your guide\\u201d as Lattimore\\u2019s harp patterns construct a glimmering path forward. PARELES\", \"\\u201cDeciphering the Message,\\u201d Makaya McCraven\\u2019s first LP for Blue Note Records, could easily get you thinking of \\u201cShades of Blue,\\u201d Madlib\\u2019s classic 2003 album remixing old tracks from that label\\u2019s jazz archive. On \\u201cDeciphering,\\u201d McCraven \\u2014 a drummer, producer and beat dissector \\u2014 digs through 13 tracks from the label\\u2019s catalog and attacks them through his personal method of remixing and pastiche. \\u201cDeciphering\\u201d crackles with McCraven\\u2019s sonic signatures: viscid ambience, restlessly energetic drumming, the recognizable sounds of his longtime collaborators (Marquis Hill on trumpet, Matt Gold on guitar, Joel Ross on vibraphone, et al). \\u201cTranquillity\\u201d stems from a track by the vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson, from his 1966 album \\u201cComponents,\\u201d and McCraven\\u2019s intervention is two-pronged: He doubles down on the original\\u2019s curved-glass effect, adding whispery trumpet and fluttering flute atop the original track, but his own drums \\u2014 kinetic, unrelenting \\u2014 keep the energy at a rolling boil.
