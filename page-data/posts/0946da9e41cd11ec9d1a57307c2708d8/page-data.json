He added that about 90 percent of the service\\u2019s workers had received at least two vaccine doses.\", \"The measure, which is subject to parliamentary approval, is due to come into force on April 1. Exemptions will be available for people who are medically prevented from receiving vaccines and for health workers who have no face-to-face contact with patients.\", \"That time frame is intended to ensure that workers who do not want to be vaccinated remain in their jobs during the winter, when the strain on the country\\u2019s overstretched health service is likely to be particularly acute.\", \"Mr. Javid said he had decided against making flu vaccination compulsory for the moment.\", \"England\\u2019s health service employs around 1.3 million workers, though not all are in frontline positions.

Some are thought to have quit their jobs and opted to work instead in the National Health Service.\", \"Mr. Hopson said that, although there was a risk that unvaccinated workers could infect patients and colleagues, staff shortages also posed a danger to public health.\", \"\\u201cThe problem for both social care and the N.H.S. is that we run these systems incredibly hot on very, very fine margins,\\u201d he told the BBC. \\u201cBoth of us have got around 90,000 to 100,000 vacancies.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe are completely reliant on our staff to currently work extra shifts in order to do the work that needs to be done,\\u201d he added, \\u201cso losing significant numbers of staff, particularly given the pressures both systems are under at the moment, is a real, real problem.\\u201d\", \"Trade unions issued more blunt warnings.\", \"\\u201cBulldozing this vaccine will exacerbate the already crushing staffing crisis we face across the N.H.S. and ambulance services,\\u201d said Rachel Harrison, a national officer at the GMB union. \\u201cBoth are operating under extreme pressures, after a decade of austerity and cuts, with an exhausted and demoralized work force who are fearful of what is to come as we head through winter.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"0946da9e41cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0946da9e41cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
