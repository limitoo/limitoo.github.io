All three players have accepted their suspension and declined to appeal, according to the NFL.\", \"\\\"The health and safety of players and personnel is our top priority,\\\" the league and the players association said in a joint statement. \\\"The NFL-NFLPA jointly reinforce their commitment and further emphasize the importance of strict adherence to the protocols to protect the well-being of everyone associated with the NFL.\\\"\", \"The suspension comes weeks after Brown's private chef told The Tampa Bay Times that the wide receiver bought fake vaccination cards for himself and his girlfriend.
