It ended what has been captivating theater for the last nine months, the daily parsing of Rodgers\\u2019s word and deed, his status in everything from coronavirus vaccination to job satisfaction the dominant plot point in the melodrama that is America\\u2019s most popular sport. It also, quite possibly, ended Rodgers\\u2019s tenure in green and gold, 17 seasons of excellence, of individual awards and playoff disappointment, distilled into a championship 11 years ago, back when he must have figured he would win more than just one.\", \"Rodgers lost his last four N.F.C. championship games \\u2014 including last season\\u2019s, to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Tom Brady \\u2014 and he has lost his last four playoff games against the 49ers, dating to the 2011 season. He grew up a 49ers fan in Northern California but has yet to defeat them in the postseason with Green Bay \\u2014 and, perhaps, never will. Rodgers will most likely win his second straight Most Valuable Player Award \\u2014 his fourth overall \\u2014 but it is San Francisco, the No. 6 seed, and its own quarterback playing ahead of a drafted replacement, Jimmy Garoppolo, advancing to next Sunday\\u2019s conference championship at either the Los Angeles Rams or Tampa Bay.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m going to take some time and have conversations with the folks around here and then take some time away and make a decision, obviously before free agency or anything kind of gets going on that front,\\u201d Rodgers said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s fresh right now. It\\u2019s a little shocking for sure. I was hoping to have a nice week after the N.F.C. championship to enjoy the lead-up and then start contemplating some things. I haven\\u2019t even let the moment really sink in yet.\\u201d\", \"For Rodgers and the Packers, this season has abounded with pressure, with urgency, since before training camp, when Rodgers and receiver Davante Adams posted on Instagram the same photo \\u2014 of Michael Jordan dapping up Scottie Pippen, the symbolism undeniable: This, the posts suggested, could be something of a last dance for them in Green Bay.\", \"With brutal candor, Rodgers aired his grievances in a news conference, then promised he would dedicate himself to a fruitful season. So much has changed since April, when a report detailing Rodgers\\u2019s anger with Packers management detonated in the final hours before the N.F.L. draft and turned one of the league\\u2019s tent-pole events into a frenzied unveiling of a will-he-or-won\\u2019t-he-return saga. Many things have not.\", \"Rodgers said that his relationship with the team\\u2019s general manager, Brian Gutekunst, and other members of the Packers\\u2019 front office has improved, but Green Bay will still enter the off-season in salary-cap perdition \\u2014 more than $40 million over \\u2014 and with several important players set to become unrestricted free agents: Adams, who could receive the franchise tag; linebacker De\\u2019Vondre Campbell; cornerback Rasul Douglas; tight end Robert Tonyan; and offensive lineman Lucas Patrick, among others. The Packers also have quarterback Jordan Love, their first-round pick in 2020 who has sat behind Rodgers the last two years.\", \"Rodgers, through concessions Green Bay made with his contract, has the power to determine where he plays next season.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to be a part of a rebuild if I\\u2019m going to keep playing,\\u201d Rodgers said.\", \"Provided he wants to play at all, the question for Rodgers will be whether his desire to join another team toward the end of a sterling career \\u2014 like Brady did after leaving the New England Patriots \\u2014 trumps his desire to stay with a team that could still offer him the best chance to win next season and beyond. Potential suitors like Denver and Las Vegas are searching for new coaches, and their rosters \\u2014 not accounting for the haul it would take to acquire Rodgers \\u2014 pale to the assemblage of talent that Gutekunst has formed and, most likely, will continue to form.\", \"\\u201cCertainly we want him back here,\\u201d Coach Matt LaFleur said. \\u201cI think we would be crazy not to want him back here.\\u201d\", \"As Rodgers spoke on a video conference, dressed in all black, he did not want to reflect on all that comes next or his legacy beyond the friendships he has made. He rued his role in Saturday\\u2019s offensive malfunction \\u2014 Green Bay scored on its opening drive, a 6-yard run by A.J. Dillon, but not again until early in the fourth quarter \\u2014 and also the Packers\\u2019 special-teams collapse.\", \"With one of the league\\u2019s worst units all season, Green Bay had a field-goal attempt blocked just before halftime, then \\u2014 after stuffing San Francisco on fourth down at the Packers\\u2019 19 \\u2014 allowed Jordan Willis to penetrate the line and block Corey Bojorquez\\u2019s punt with less than five minutes remaining. Talanoa Hufanga scooped up the ball and returned it 6 yards to tie the score at 10-10.\", \"Twice before in the postseason, Rodgers had led a game-winning drive. In Week 3 this season, he engineered one against these same 49ers. But in his final possession on Saturday night, the Packers faltered, with Rodgers lofting a deep pass on third down toward Adams into double coverage which, he said later, should have been thrown toward Allen Lazard. With San Francisco taking over on its own 29 with 3:20 left, Garoppolo, playing with a torn ligament in his right thumb and a sprained right shoulder, drove San Francisco 44 yards in nine plays to set up Gould\\u2019s winning kick.\", \"The Packers, who had only 10 men on the field for it, trudged along the sideline. Rodgers shook hands and congratulated the 49ers and headed off the field, for what might have been the final time as a Packer.\", \"Just two months ago, after returning from the 10-day isolation that accompanied his positive coronavirus test, Rodgers proclaimed the joy and gratitude he felt \\u2014 because, he said, he refused to take moments like that for granted. His future, much as it did this time last year, remains a \\u201cbeautiful mystery.\\u201d\", \"And it has arrived much quicker than he expected.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s life sometimes,\\u201d Rodgers said. \\u201cyou think things are going a certain way and they take a big course correction and you just have to keep moving on and moving forward, even when you don\\u2019t think it is possible.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4fd6a0a07cd311ec9063e7b10601f135"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4fd6a0a07cd311ec9063e7b10601f135"}},
