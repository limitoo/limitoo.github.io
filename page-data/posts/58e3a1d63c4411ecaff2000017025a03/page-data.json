Registered Democrats outnumber Republicans in the city nearly seven to one.\", \"It is unclear when a winner will be declared, but in the 2013 election that sent Bill de Blasio to Gracie Mansion, the last open-seat mayoral race in the city, the contest was called less than an hour after polls closed. If Mr. Adams \\u2014 who triumphed in a bruising multicandidate Democratic primary by charting a moderate course \\u2014 wins tonight, he will become the city\\u2019s second Black mayor.\", \"Mr. Adams, 61, a former police captain and state senator, ran a campaign focused on public safety, at a time when the city is struggling with a pandemic-era increase in gun violence. Many voters across the city said that his perspective on safety and crime had won him their support; he has said repeatedly that he pressed for reforms from within the Police Department.\", \"In the Bay Ridge area of Brooklyn, Ahmed Hubabi, 63, a Democrat, said that friends in law enforcement had urged him to vote for Mr. Adams. \\u201cI think he\\u2019s the right person for the job,\\u201d Mr. Hubabi said, adding, \\u201cI think he\\u2019s for the working class, especially for the minorities and the underprivileged.\\u201d\", \"In Kingsbridge in the Bronx, Julia Yarwood, a 35-year-old Democrat, said of Mr. Adams, \\u201cThe way that he spoke, he seemed to represent a lot of New Yorkers.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Adams has promised to lead New York in a more equitable direction, pointing to his working-class roots. Still, in contrast to the message of economic populism Mr. de Blasio rode to victory for two terms (he is barred by term limits from running again), Mr. Adams has made explicit overtures to big-business leaders, arguing that they too have a significant role to play in the city\\u2019s recovery.\", \"After voting in Brooklyn on Tuesday morning, Mr. Adams wiped away tears. \\u201cBecause I\\u2019m standing here, everyday New Yorkers are going to realize they deserve the right to stand in this city also,\\u201d he said. \", \"Mr. Sliwa, a former talk-radio host, has also been keenly focused on public safety and addressing homelessness \\u2014 but on other matters and certainly in personality, he and Mr. Adams have significant differences.\", \"Mr. Sliwa\\u2019s campaign has also been marked by antics and eccentricities that often drew more attention than his policy positions. His trip to the polls on Tuesday became a fracas when he tried to bring one of his many cats with him, then shouted at election officials who asked him to remove his red campaign jacket because it violated electioneering rules.\", \"Mr. Sliwa, 67, who made his reputation as a crime fighter in the streets during the early days of the Guardian Angels, portrayed Mr. Adams as elitist during his campaign.\", \"Another voter in Bay Ridge, Mike Miglino, 65, a retired high school teacher and registered Democrat, said he had crossed party lines to vote for Mr. Sliwa because \\u201cDemocrats have gone too far left.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Sliwa has highlighted still-simmering questions around Mr. Adams\\u2019s residency and his financial dealings. Mr. Sliwa has also tried to harness resistance in parts of the city to vaccine mandates, which he opposes.\", \"In Ozone Park, Queens, Nancy Aldrich, 59 and unvaccinated, said admiringly of Mr. Sliwa, \\u201cHe\\u2019s from the streets \\u2014 he knows the reality of what is going on. He doesn\\u2019t blow smoke in your eyes.\\u201d\", \"Other key races have offered more drama, including several City Council elections where Republicans are fighting to hold, if not grow, their three spots in the 51-member body.\", \"Across the state, a hotly contested rematch in the Buffalo mayor\\u2019s race and a fight for district attorney on Long Island also illustrate nationwide struggles over public safety and criminal justice reform. Taken together, the results on Tuesday may offer a snapshot of the tensions over the direction and identity of the Democratic Party in New York.\"]","href_hash":"58e3a1d63c4411ecaff2000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"58e3a1d63c4411ecaff2000017025a03"}},
