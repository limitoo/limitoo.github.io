Putin of Russia on Tuesday that an invasion of Ukraine would result in heavy economic penalties for him and lead NATO to reposition its troops in Europe, measures that he said would go well beyond the West\\u2019s response to Russia\\u2019s annexation of Crimea seven years ago.\", \"In a two-hour video conference that American and Russian officials both described as tense, but occasionally pierced by humor, Mr. Biden also said an invasion would end Russia\\u2019s hopes of completing the Nord Stream II gas pipeline to Europe, which would be a major source of energy revenue. Hours after the negotiation was over, a senior State Department official, Victoria Nuland, confirmed that in a Senate hearing, saying, \\u201cI think if President Putin moves on Ukraine, our expectation is that the pipeline will be suspended.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere was no finger-wagging, but the president was crystal clear,\\u2019\\u2019 Jake Sullivan, Mr. Biden\\u2019s national security adviser, told reporters after the session, which Mr. Biden conducted from the White House Situation Room and Mr. Putin from his retreat on the Black Sea. But he said that Mr. Biden had told the Russian leader that \\u201cthings we did not do in 2014, we are prepared to do now.\\u201d\", \"In recent days, American officials have said that that list, being composed by the Treasury Department in collaboration with European allies, ranges from blocking Russian companies from access to global capital markets to financial penalties aimed at the Russian elite, especially the oligarchs who have helped finance and support Mr. Putin. The most extreme step \\u2014 one that is still being debated \\u2014 would be to cut Russia off from the global financial settlement system, called SWIFT, but some European officials have feared that step might provoke too harsh a counterreaction.\", \"It is too early to tell whether the much anticipated conversation, whose details were hard to elicit as both the White House and the Kremlin put their spin on it, will alleviate the immediate crisis in Ukraine, where roughly 100,000 Russian troops have massed, with more equipment and personnel arriving every day. Mr. Putin gave no indication of his ultimate intent, officials said, or whether he was actually contemplating an invasion or trying to get the West to pay attention to his demands by manufacturing a crisis.\", \"But it had the feel of a return to the East-West politics of the Cold War, when NATO strategy was focused on how it would halt an invasion from the former Soviet Union, and Moscow was seeking respect and deference. At stake was the continued independence of Ukraine, which won its independence after the fall of the Soviet Union, part of a collapse Mr. Putin has described as a tragedy of 20th century geopolitics. And White House aides were highly aware that while their options were limited \\u2014 there is no discussion of direct military involvement by the United States \\u2014 failure to deter Mr. Putin could be seen as a sign of weakness around the world, especially by China.\", \"While the two men met, Ms. Nuland, who has angered Mr. Putin in past years because of her role in bolstering Ukraine\\u2019s ouster of a leader who was considered a puppet to Moscow, warned that the Russian leader seemed emboldened. \", \"\\u201cMuch of this comes right out of Putin\\u2019s 2014 playbook, but this time, it is much larger, and on a much more lethal scale,\\u2019\\u2019 she told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. \\u201cSo despite our uncertainty about exact intentions and timing, we must prepare with our allies and partners for all contingencies, even as we push Putin to reverse course.\\u201d\", \"The evening before the conference between Mr. Biden and Mr. Putin, the director of the C.I.A., William J. Burns, a former American ambassador to Russia, said in the next few months \\u2014 as the ground freezes in the marshy territory on the Russia-Ukraine border and Russia completes its military buildup \\u2014 Mr. Putin may conclude the time to act is ripe.\", \"\\u201cI think tactically, as President Putin probably looks at this winter at the next few months, he may see a more favorable landscape,\\u201d Mr. Burns said.\", \"Speaking to a Wall Street Journal forum, he said that in Mr. Putin\\u2019s view the major European allies are \\u201cdistracted with the transition beyond Chancellor Merkel in Germany,\\u201d and with France preparing for presidential elections next spring, \\u201che sees himself in a position of relative economic strength compared to where the Russian economy was a couple of years ago.\\u201d \", \"Mr. Biden sought to change that view on Tuesday morning, and Mr. Sullivan argued that because the Nord Stream pipeline was not yet operating, its fate was leverage for the United States and its allies.\"]","href_hash":"2e78bf0a57b311ec80d8afd8a81edc1a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2e78bf0a57b311ec80d8afd8a81edc1a"}},
