In the first ceremony, the glowing athletes ascend the familiar three-tier platform, where Summer Olympians would have a medal placed around their necks.\", \"Instead, the winners in the Beijing Olympics are handed something of a placeholder: A stuffed-animal version of Bing Dwen Dwen, the panda Olympic mascot, dressed in a shell of ice resembling a spacesuit and flanked by a golden fabric wreath of pine, bamboo and plum. All three winners, whether gold, silver or bronze, get the same souvenir, one that is barely distinguishable from those available in fan merchandise stores.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve collected quite a few things at the Olympics so far, so I have a kind of treasure of things to bring home to the family,\\u201d Isabelle Weidemann, a bronze medal winner in the women\\u2019s 3000-meter speedskating event, said of the placeholder.\", \"Getting to hold the actual medal on Sunday, a day after her event, felt \\u201cincredibly different\\u201d from holding the stuffed panda, she said.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a lot more emotional, too,\\u201d she said.\", \"In the second ceremony, held in a venue dedicated solely to handing out medals, the winners are paraded across a stage, as a few hundred fans cheer near the Olympic cauldron. The athletes ascend another three-tier platform before members of the International Olympic Committee hand them their medals, which they put on themselves. They are allowed to remove their masks for a moment.\", \"A similar two-ceremony format was used in the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang.\", \"Arianna Fontana, who won a silver medal as part of Italy\\u2019s mixed team short-track speedskating, said on Sunday after her medal ceremony that it was nice to receive her medal with more people watching, compared to the largely empty short track stadium.\", \"\\u201cNow it\\u2019s real,\\u201d she said. \\u201cYesterday there was a lot of adrenaline, a lot of emotion, and maybe it took a little bit to understand what really happened.\\u201d\", \"She continued: \\u201cToday we have this medal on our necks, and it feels amazing.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"1a3372fa8a9a11ec9c31a7327c81cab6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1a3372fa8a9a11ec9c31a7327c81cab6"}},
