After questioning those two men, police then changed the course of the investigation to look into if Smollett had staged the crime.\", \"Smollett had originally told police in January 2019 that he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack while out late at night in Chicago. He claimed two attackers punched him in the face, poured an \\\"unknown chemical substance\\\" on him, and wrapped a rope around his neck.\", \"The actor also reported the attackers made reference to \\\"MAGA country,\\\" a reference to then-President Donald Trump's slogan of \\\"Make American Great Again.\\\"\", \"Once investigators shifted the focus to Smollett staging the attack, he was arrested in February 2019 but then cleared of all charges a month later. In February 2020, a special prosecutor assigned to the case announced he would seek charges against Smollett.\", \"Smollett was found guilty on five of six counts of disorderly conduct on Thursday. He is still awaiting sentencing.\", \"Smollett's case is expected to still see more legal repercussions. Following the original charge of felony disorderly against Smollett being dropped in 2019, the Osundairo brothers sued Smollett's attorneys for defamation over claims the case damaged their careers and reputations.\", \"A federal judge had stayed their lawsuit until the criminal proceedings were completed for Smollett. Now, they are open to continue their lawsuit as well.\"]","href_hash":"6479a3785c3e11ec9d4eb10f41008685"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6479a3785c3e11ec9d4eb10f41008685"}},
