So, it is a public health risk. Definitely.\\\"\", \"The public health risk is not huge, but there is the chance of picking up illnesses that can be transmitted in human wastewater.\", \"Massey University Professor Nigel French said norovirus and other nasties could live in wastewater.\", \"\\\"We've got things like campylobacter, we have salmonella, and we have some fairly nasty E. coli, which could get into the wastewater,\\\" French said.\", \"\\\"Then again, if people are infected, then things like cryptosporidium and giardia, which are both parasites, could also cause illness in people exposed to that through recreational swimming.\\\"\", \"French said those illnesses tended have similar symptoms.\", \"\\\"Bloody diarrhoea can be a common symptom. Abdominal pain or stomach cramps can be quite common. Nausea and vomiting in some cases, and fever can be, those are the kind of symptoms that you'd see. Many of those are quite common to all of those things that I mentioned.\\\"\", \"Vigar had a message for those who wanted to lower their chances of getting sick from nasties - get in the sea.\", \"\\\"Everything dies off much faster in saltwater.
