(She was the only woman to have walked out on him.) Or her stature as an artist: Her works are exhibited in more than a dozen museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Centre Pompidou in Paris, their prices on the rise.\", \"Some now hang in her home, an airy refuge with barrel-vaulted ceilings, towering bookcases and an outsize window that bathes her canvases in a cool north light. There are works on every wall and stacked along the studio\\u2019s perimeter. Two abstract oils are propped like monuments on easels near the door.\", \"But Ms. Gilot herself is no monument. \\u201cI am not going to make a big deal of being more than what I am,\\u201d she said. \\u201cOr less.\\u201d\", \"Yes, it has been unsettling, if not entirely unwelcome, to find herself courted in recent months by art world pundits and the oddly assorted curiosity seekers who approach her with the kind of reverence one might reserve for a living repository of mid-20th-century culture \\u2014 an idol and \\u201cit girl\\u201d at the unlikely age of 100.\", \"\\u201cThe idea!,\\u201d she said, smiling, perhaps a bit coyly. \\u201cFor me painting is a silent art.\\u201d And an artist\\u2019s work ought to speak for itself, even if, as she added with a self-deprecating chuckle, \\u201cWe are not always sure what we communicate.\\u201d\", \"She is happy to have visitors sketch in the details. \\u201cYou show them whatever they like to imagine about you,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut I am not the way they think I am.\\u201d\", \"Then, with a conspiratorial nod toward Aurelia Engel, her youngest daughter and her archivist, who sat nearby, she signaled that it may be time to drop her guard. Just don\\u2019t ask her to repeat herself.\", \"She has said much of what she has to say in \\u201cLife With Picasso,\\u201d written with Carlton Lake, an American journalist. Her father, an agronomist, made clear to his daughter from an early age that he would have preferred a boy. When she showed a fear of blood and heights, he responded by making her climb tall rocks and jump.\", \"\\u201cMy only possible reaction was anger,\\u201d she writes. \\u201cBut since I could not show my anger, I began to nourish an inner resentment.\\u201d\", \"By the time she was 8, she had toughened. \\u201cI sought out difficulty and danger. I had become another person. I felt the need of going too far simply to prove to myself that I was capable of it.\\u201d\", \"She strayed far from her haute bourgeois upbringing, turning her back on the father who had insisted that she study law, for the bohemian life. As detailed in the memoir, Picasso, 61, and a towering figure when they met, smooth-talked Ms. Gilot, who was 21, into sharing his home on the Rue Saint-Augustin in Paris. He provided her with her own studio and encouraged her to paint. In turn, she doted on him, becoming his bookkeeper, intellectual interpreter and the mother of their children, Claude and Paloma. The relationship flourished \\u2014 for a time.\", \"But family life was not the walk on the beach portrayed in the famous Robert Capa photograph of Ms. Gilot traipsing on the sand at Golfe-Juan in the South of France, Picasso screening her with a colossal parasol. In darker moments, he was given to parading in front of her a string of would-be rivals, most famously Dora Maar, the painter and photographer, and Olga Khokhlova, his first wife, a Russian dancer who trailed the couple wherever they chose to holiday.\", \"Ms. Gilot writes that Picasso showed Gilot great tenderness, but also subjected her to fits of lacerating cruelty. \\u201cYou were a Venus when I met you,\\u201d he tells her soon after the birth of Paloma. \\u201cNow you\\u2019re a Christ \\u2014 and a Romanesque Christ at that, with all the ribs sticking out to be counted.\\u201d Once, at the height of an argument, he threatened to burn her. \\u201cHe took the cigarette he was smoking and touched it to my right cheek and held it there,\\u201d she writes. \\u201cHe must have expected me to pull away, but I was determined not to give him the satisfaction.\\u201d\", \"So attentively did she document his methods and musings that she risked effacing her own personality. In the book she recounts Picasso\\u2019s friend Andr\\u00e9 Gide once chiding him, \\u201cIt\\u2019s easy to see there\\u2019s a dimension to her inner life which has escaped you.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Gilot has since become more forthright. As she spoke, she leaned in to tell me, \\u201cWe are approximately the same age, products of the same generation,\\u201d a remark that prompted Ms. Engel to gently interject, \\u201cMother, you are 100.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Gilot lifted her eyebrows and shrugged.\", \"\\u201cAs young women, we were taught to keep silent,\\u201d she went on. \\u201cWe were taught early that taking second place is easier than first. You tell yourself that\\u2019s all right, but it\\u2019s not all right. It is important that we learn to express ourselves, to say what it is that we like, that we want.\\u201d\", \"She has not always been above using her looks to further her aims. Soon after they met, she writes, she took up Picasso\\u2019s invitation to teach her engraving. \\u201cI arrived on time wearing a black velvet dress with a high white lace collar, my dark red hair done up in a coiffure I had taken from a painting of the Infanta by Vel\\u00e1zquez.\\u201d\", \"When he remarked that her turnout was ill-suited for engraving, she informed him that she knew he had no intention of teaching that day. \\u201cI was simply trying to look beautiful,\\u201d she told him.\", \"\\u201cMaybe I rather like the way I look,\\u201d she said in her apartment. Dressed in a lively m\\u00e9lange of pink and gold stripes, royal blue or her signature red, she can turn heads. \\u201cA sense of style is important,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a pane of glass that makes you seem transparent but at the same time is a barrier.\\u201d\", \"Barriers can be handy. \\u201cYou should not make yourself known that much to other people and keep your most intimate thoughts to yourself,\\u201d she said. Even with a husband? \\u201cEspecially with a husband,\\u201d she said, erupting into peals of laughter.\", \"Leaving Picasso was an attenuated process, the relationship ending in 1953. Two years later, she married Ms. Engel\\u2019s father, the artist Luc Simon. They divorced in 1962, and in 1970 she wed Jonas Salk, the developer of the polio vaccine, the union lasting until Mr. Salk\\u2019s death in 1995.\", \"\\u201cI think you had more power in your marriages to my father and to Jonas,\\u201d Ms. Engel said. \\u201cYou were often very nurturing, helping them find themselves and express themselves.\\u201d\", \"To which Ms. Gilot responded with mock chagrin: \\u201cJust listen to what comes out of the mouths of children.\\u201d\", \"During the interview she was often as wry in her memoir. In the book she recalls a moment when Claude, a small boy, pleaded to be allowed into her studio. Loitering just outside her door, he wheedled, \\u201cI love you, Mama.\\u201d No luck. He liked her painting, he told her, adding after a time, \\u201cIt\\u2019s better than Papa\\u2019s.\\u201d At that, she weakened and welcomed him inside.\", \"Had she ever felt competitive with Picasso or his friends, a cohort that famously included Chagall, Braque, Matisse and Giacometti? \\u201cThat never entered my mind,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI started painting, after all, at 3 years old. As a child, you aren\\u2019t thinking in terms of me, me, me. You are not capable of that.\\u201d\", \"What is more, she said: \\u201cThe people I was with were so evolved. I was full of admiration for them.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBut they also helped me grow\\u201d she added with some cheek. \\u201cI realized, if they are so great, then I am not so small.\\u201d\", \"In the eyes of the art world, Ms. Gilot is substantial indeed. Last May, her painting \\u201cPaloma \\u00e0 la Guitare,\\u201d a 1965 portrait of her with her daughter, sold for $1.3 million at Sotheby\\u2019s in London, at seven times its high estimate.\", \"Shows of her work opened late last year at the Estrine Museum in Saint-R\\u00e9my-de-Provence, France, at Varfok Gallery in Budapest and at Galerie Patrick and Jillian Mac Fine Art in New Orleans. At Christie\\u2019s in Hong Kong, \\u201cLiving Forest,\\u201d an 1977 abstract canvas that was part of a major retrospective at the auction house in November, sold for $1.3 million.\", \"She would have you believe that she takes it all in stride. \\u201cShe is less concerned with her career,\\u201d Ms. Engel said, because, as her mother recently told her, \\u201c\\u2018It is already done.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Ms. Gilot has for the moment laid her brushes aside. But she is still evolving. \\u201cIt\\u2019s very difficult to become who you are,\\u201d she said. \\u201cPeople tell you to be natural. But what is natural, I would like to know?\\u201d\", \"She resists what she calls \\u201ctoo much order,\\u201d too much striving for consistency. \\u201cIt\\u2019s important to be a bit na\\u00efve, to be spontaneous,\\u201d she said. \\u201cOften the first thought that comes to mind is the right one.\\u201d\", \"She underscored the point, referring to her paintings of the early 1960s, a series inspired by the myth of Theseus and Ariadne. \\u201cMaybe they are most representative of who I am now,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI see life as a labyrinth. You don\\u2019t fight it. You go where it takes you.\", \"Or, as she added after a beat, \\u201cYou go the other way.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"12de4232791511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"12de4232791511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
