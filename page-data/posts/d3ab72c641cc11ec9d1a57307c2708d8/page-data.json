Security Council that could help those around the world living on less than $2 a day. He suggested that the thousand wealthiest people, most prominent private companies and the 20 major worldwide economies combine their resources to generate around $1 trillion each year. Only 4 percent of the wealthiest people's income and the most successful companies' profits would be needed to make the plan a reality, along with 0.2 percent of the GDP of successful economies.\", \"\\\"The spirit of cooperation is losing ground to the desire for profit, and this is leading us to slide from civilization into barbarity,\\\" L\\u00f3pez Obrador told the council. \\\"We are moving forward, alienated, forgetting moral principles, and turning our backs on the pain of humanity.\\\"\", \"He cited worldwide COVID-19 vaccine distribution as a significant sign that wealth is dividing the world. Companies involved in creating the vaccines sold 94 percent of their stock, but only 6 percent went to the COVAX program.\", \"\\\"People in the richest countries are getting third doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, while only 5 percent of Africans are fully vaccinated,\\\" U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. \\\"Even before the pandemic, the world's billionaires held more wealth than 60 percent of the global population\\u2014and that gap has widened enormously.\\\"\", \"L\\u00f3pez Obrador criticized the U.N. during the speech for allegedly ignoring poor societies around the world. However, he did say that it is not too late for those in power to begin righting wrongs.\", \"\\\"It is never too late to ensure that justice is done,\\\" he said. \\\"It is time to act today against marginalization, dealing with the causes and not just the consequences.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1929527/andres-manuel-lopez-obrador.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Mexico's president has called on the world's wealthiest to take action to help the poorest.
