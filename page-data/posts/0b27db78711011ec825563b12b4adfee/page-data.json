Only Kane Williamson, Ross Taylor and Martin Crowe have scored more hundreds for the Blackcaps than Latham.\", \"And the New Zealand captain wasn't done there. Batting on after the tea break, Latham pushed on to reach 150, taking 199 balls, and at the same time raising his century stand with Conway for the second wicket.\", \"Fresh from a first-innings century of his own at Mt Maunganui, Conway passed 50 again, taking 83 balls and showing off his array of sweeps and reverse sweeps against the spin of Mehidy Hasan, looking untroubled on this way to another half-century.\", \"Conway's efforts also saw him become the first player in test match history to pass 50 in the first innings of each of his first five tests played.\", \"And as he'd done with Young, Latham again added a record partnership on his home ground, as the second wicket stand with Conway ticked over the 123 runs between England's James Vince and Mark Stoneman.\\u00a0\", \"As his partnership with Latham ticked past 150, and then 200, the only question would be whether or not Conway could join his captain on three figures.\", \"The 30-year-old advanced into the 90s in what felt like no time, and had 98 by the time the last ball arrived.\", \"But a single on the second ball saw Conway stranded at the non-striker's end for the final four balls of the day, and will resume on day two chasing yet another test match hundred.\", \"Bangladesh meanwhile will need to return to the drawing board. Despite the bowler-friendly conditions on offer, only Shoriful Islam (1/50) tasted success in the wickets column, and was the only bowler to concede less than three runs per over.\", \"And as Bangladesh seek their first test series win against New Zealand, Monday's play has almost certainly ensured that the Tigers will have to keep waiting for a few years to come.\", \"Join Newshub for live updates of day two between the Blackcaps and Bangladesh from 11am Tuesday.\"]","href_hash":"0b27db78711011ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0b27db78711011ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
