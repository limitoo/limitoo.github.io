Amid a widespread push to remove monuments of Confederates and Christopher Columbus from our public squares, many people have begun demanding the removal, too, of more subtle reminders of systemic racism inscribed in the names of the places \\u2014 streets and cities, bridges and schools \\u2014\\u00ad by which we orient our lives.\", \"Activists in Brooklyn, for example, have recently highlighted the 70 streets in the borough whose names recall colonial-era New Yorkers who owned slaves. In Upper Manhattan, Representative Adriano Espillat proposed changing the name of Washington Heights (named for the slave-owning founding father) and adjoining neighborhoods to \\u201cQuisqueya Heights\\u201d \\u2014 a name that honors an Indigenous name for the home island, in the Caribbean, of many of the area\\u2019s residents from the Dominican Republic.\", \"Yet at a community meeting this fall, hundreds of area residents turned up to inform Mr. Espillat that they like the name of their neighborhood just fine. (He has altered his resolution to simply recognize the Dominican community\\u2019s presence and contributions to the neighborhood.)\", \"The fallout was telling. We need a more sophisticated way to approach questions of renaming than the one espoused earlier this year by, among others, Eric Adams. During the mayoral primary, Mr. Adams was joined by the other leading Democratic candidates in insisting that New York should rename streets and schools named after people who held slaves. Mr. Adams said, \\u201cWe should not honor people that have had an abusive past.\\u201d\", \"But it\\u2019s essential, in the light of larger debates about how best to confront our collective past, that we give weight not merely to such place-names\\u2019 origins. We need to pay heed, too, to the varied meanings they\\u2019ve gained, across time, from the people who use them and value them for what they have come to mean for their community.\", \"To study the names that make up a city is to access layers of its history \\u2014 to encounter the people and tongues of varied eras whose tags stuck to the city\\u2019s maps. Here in New York, those layers include names derived from the Indigenous Lenape (Manhattan, Canarsie, Rockaway), Dutch names left by settlers from Holland (Bowery, Bleecker, Brooklyn) and English names implanted by the British who seized New Amsterdam in 1664 and rechristened it New York (and then labeled its outlying counties Queens and Kings). After the American Revolution, New York gained streets named for heroes of that war (MacDougal, Greene, Lafayette) and for the founders of the United States (Madison Avenue, after our fourth president \\u2014 who was also a slave owner).\", \"New York was a colonial slave port and is also full of streets named for people who bought and sold humans as chattel. Few historical truths I convey to my N.Y.U. students seem so impactful, for young people who often have no idea that slavery wasn\\u2019t just \\u201cdown south,\\u201d as telling them that Nostrand Avenue in Brooklyn, say, was possibly named for the family of a landowner in the area who, according to New York\\u2019s 1790 census, also owned six slaves. These facts are vital to understanding how modern New York came to be.\", \"But beside that is another truth: John Van Nostrand\\u2019s surname today most resonates among Caribbean immigrants who\\u2019ve long made his old acreage home as the place to go for Brooklyn\\u2019s best Trinidadian doubles or Barbados hot sauce \\u2014 and as a thoroughfare now also bisected with blocks named for heroes of Caribbean history like Toussaint L\\u2019Ouverture.\", \"Place-names have the power to encode history and signal social mores. But we\\u2019ve also always had the power to change what they evoke. The once-marshy part of Upper Manhattan that we know as Harlem got its name from Dutch settlers who thought its wetlands and hills resembled the market town of Haarlem near Amsterdam. Those Dutchmen were affiliated with a commercial enterprise \\u2014 the Dutch West India Company \\u2014 that was intrinsic to the \\u201ctriangle trade\\u201d of Africans into slavery in the New World. But no one today is advocating erasing \\u201cHarlem\\u201d from our maps. And the reason is plain: The name now evokes not its founders nor the Netherlands but an American neighborhood whose name has grown iconic, thanks to its proud residents over the past century and more, of Black freedom and culture.\", \"To study where place-names come from is also to chart resistance and happenstance and convoluted tales that lie behind many place-names in New York \\u2014 ranging from Anglicized riffs on Old Dutch words (\\u201cGramercy\\u201d grows from what the Dutch called that area\\u2019s \\u201ckrom moerasje\\u201d \\u2014 crooked marsh; \\u201cConey Island\\u201d from what they called \\u201cConyne Eylandt\\u201d \\u2014 island of rabbits) to a more recent Puerto Rican play on the Lower East Side. That neighborhood\\u2019s name, once evocative of Jewish life and later of hipster life in Lower Manhattan, is also the inspiration for the Spanglish nickname \\u201cLoisaida\\u201d that now hangs from street signs on Avenue C.\", \"Denizens of the Manhattan Beach section of Brooklyn recently wrestled with what to do with Corbin Place \\u2014 a byway named for the 19th-century developer, Austin Corbin, who built the neighborhood but also headed the American Society for the Suppression of Jews. Wanting to disavow the latter part of his legacy but not the warm memories many have of growing up here, they changed not the street\\u2019s name but its referent: Now \\u201cM. Corbin Place\\u201d officially honors not an old antisemite but rather New York\\u2019s foremost female participant in the Revolutionary War, Margaret Corbin.\", \"Other institutions and communities have adopted clear principles that we\\u2019d do well to consider: when and to what end a place was first named; whether or not its namesake\\u2019s \\u201cprincipal legacy\\u201d could be said to include advocating slavery or racism; whether or not her or his memory\\u2019s presence in public space was designed, or is used now, to uphold white supremacy or other values we reject.\", \"Such criteria make it clear why it\\u2019s entirely apt that sites commemorating old Confederates \\u2014 most of which date not from the Civil War but from the era and ideology of Jim Crow \\u2014 be removed.\", \"But they also remind us why it\\u2019s vital to continue to devote as much energy to making the past visible \\u2014 to commemorating history\\u2019s victims, and celebrating those who fought to change it \\u2014 in new ways. Nowadays when I want to educate my students about how slavery shaped New York, I show them the official plaque that now stands at the corner of Wall Street and Water Street, in the financial district, to mark the site of Manhattan\\u2019s main slave market in the 1700s.\", \"We have a long way to go before the mainstream version of history inscribed on our maps and on many of our streets is balanced by sites hailing figures who sought to change its course, especially members of social groups still rarely hailed in public space: women, people of color, members of the working classes.\", \"One reason historians warn against condescending to the past is to selfishly safeguard our present: Who\\u2019s to say our great-grandchildren won\\u2019t all agree with our vegan friends that eating dead animals was the height of barbarism? But there\\u2019s another, subtler source of danger lurking in such condescension \\u2014 the lack of credit we give to those who\\u2019ve showed us, by attaching new meanings to place-names once redolent of slavery, that part of the power of names lies in our capacity to shift what they mean.\", \"The names we give to places have a mysterious power, the writer Henry Porter observed, to become a part of them. Which is a way of saying they become a part of us. There are names we may decide to change. But we should be careful not to erase the meanings we\\u2019ve vested them with \\u2014 and continue to push to inscribe public space with other histories that need to be made visible and better known.\"]","href_hash":"a7bb19fc574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a7bb19fc574811ecb93b490b32b111b4"}},
