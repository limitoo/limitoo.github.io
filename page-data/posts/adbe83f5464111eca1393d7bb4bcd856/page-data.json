Judge Barbara Bellis took the rare step of defaulting Jones in the defamation lawsuits for his and his companies' \\\"failure to produce critical material information that the plaintiffs needed to prove their claims.\\\"\", \"The default means the judge found in favor of the parents and will hold a hearing on how much damages he should pay.\", \"Lawyers for the parents claimed Jones and his companies, including Infowars and Free Speech Systems, violated court rules by failing to turn over documents to them, including internal company documents showing how, and if, Jones and Infowars profited from talking about the school shooting and other mass shootings.\", \"In a statement following Monday's ruling, one of the parents' lawyers, Chris Mattei, said his clients \\\"remain focused on uncovering the truth.\\\"\", \"\\\"As the Court noted, Alex Jones and his companies have deliberately concealed evidence of the relationship between what they publish and how they make money,\\\" Mattei said. \\\"Mr. Jones was given every opportunity to comply but, when he chose instead to withhold evidence for more than two years, the Court was left with no choice but to rule as it did today.\\\"\", \"Jones' lawyers have denied violating court rules on document disclosure and have asked that Bellis be removed from the case, alleging she has not been impartial.\", \"A Texas judge recently issued similar rulings against Jones in three defamation lawsuits brought by Sandy Hook families in that state, finding Jones liable for damages after defaulting him and his companies for not turning over documents. Hearings on damages also were ordered.\", \"The 2012 school shooting in Newtown killed 20 first-graders and six educators. Jones has since said that he does not believe the massacre was a hoax. In a deposition released in 2019, Jones said \\\"a form of psychosis\\\" made him believe it was staged.\", \"Families of some of the school shooting victims sued Jones, Infowars and others in courts in Texas and Connecticut over the hoax conspiracy, saying they have been subjected to harassment and death threats from Jones' followers.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"adbe83f5464111eca1393d7bb4bcd856"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"adbe83f5464111eca1393d7bb4bcd856"}},
