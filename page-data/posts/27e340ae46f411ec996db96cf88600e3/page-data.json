Parks was born in 1912 as the last of 15 children on the family farm in Kansas. He went on to tell defining chapters in America\\u2019s story through the establishment pages of Life magazine, with a nuanced fidelity to Black experience.\", \"Maggio\\u2019s documentary moves through Parks\\u2019s rich photo essays on a Harlem gang leader, the segregated South, Muhammad Ali and a boy in a Rio de Janeiro favela, as well as bold early work on Ella Watson, a janitor at the Farm Security Administration. A line is drawn from Parks\\u2019s legacy to the cultural narratives being charted by the current photographers Devin Allen and LaToya Ruby Frazier.\", \"This helps avoid a portrayal of Park \\u2014 an avuncular sage in sweater and pipe \\u2014 as a stand-alone figure. He also made history as the first Black artist to produce and direct a major Hollywood film (\\u201cThe Learning Tree,\\u201d from his own book), directed a pop-culture monument in \\u201cShaft,\\u201d composed music and wrote several books. Spike Lee, Ava DuVernay and curatorial critics sound valuable but similar points about his empathy and point of view.\", \"Perhaps no one documentary can do justice to Parks. But \\u201cChoice of Weapons\\u201d ends up streamlining his complexity, and its wind-down looks past his other audiovisual output (screening soon in a retrospective at Anthology Film Archives). Still, as Parks once said, \\u201cI consider this my world,\\u201d and we\\u2019re all still living in it.\"]","href_hash":"27e340ae46f411ec996db96cf88600e3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"27e340ae46f411ec996db96cf88600e3"}},
