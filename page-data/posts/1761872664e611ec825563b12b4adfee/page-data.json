Harris said.\", \"The choice of greens, usually cooked with pork for flavor, comes from the perception among Black Americans that folded collard greens look like paper money, said Adrian Miller, an author and food scholar. Eating greens on New Year\\u2019s Eve or New Year\\u2019s Day is believed to bring about greater financial prosperity. The peas promise good luck, health and abundance.\", \"But while these rituals have become largely associated with the American South, their roots can be traced back to the meeting of West African and European traditions, Mr. Miller said. Collard greens, for instance, originated in Northern Europe.\", \"\\u201cCollards is a corruption of colewort \\u2014 colewort is any non-heading cabbage,\\u201d said Dr. Harris, the author of \\u201cHigh on the Hog: A Culinary Journey From Africa to America.\\u201d \\u201cThey became part of the foodways of African Americans. The Africanism is in the cooking of them \\u2014 not in the green itself. That cooking method of long, low and slow, and with the potlikker being consumed, is a very different thing.\\u201d\", \"And celebrating on the first day of the year, is more of a global tradition, Mr. Miller said. In Italy, for example, lentils \\u2014 said to resemble coins \\u2014 are cooked down with pork and served for luck. In West Africa, he added, \\u201cthere were certainly auspicious days. But this idea that the first day of the calendar year \\u2014 and doing something on that day \\u2014 would bring good luck, to my knowledge, doesn\\u2019t exist in West African societies prior to European contact.\\u201d\", \"West African spiritual practices often revolved around deities who had favorite foods like black-eyed peas, which are native to the continent. The forced migration of enslaved Africans to North America and their interactions with European colonists led to a convergence of customs.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s all kind of messy,\\u201d Mr. Miller said, \\u201cbut you can see this process of cultural diffusion, borrowing, appropriation, all of those things that were happening in previous centuries, to the point where it coalesces into the tradition we have now.\\u201d\", \"Geography also played a role in the variety of interpretations that emerged. In regions of the country influenced by the British, collards or kale might be served on New Year\\u2019s Day, while in states like Louisiana, where there was a stronger German influence, people often enjoyed cabbage. As white Americans looking to take on a wholly American identity began to reject European customs, Black people found ways to transform those customs.\", \"\\u201cWhen people abandon superstitions because they just seem antiquated, that creates a space for new associations to emerge,\\u201d Mr. Miller said. \", \"Black and Southern traditions eventually became inextricable. The first documented Black New Year\\u2019s celebration is recounted in Toni Tipton-Martin\\u2019s \\u201cJubilee: Recipes From Two Centuries of African American Cooking.\\u201d In the book, she shares the origins of Watch Night, when Black Americans congregate at church for song, praise and prayer before the stroke of midnight. During the first such event, on Dec. 31, 1862 \\u2014 or Freedom\\u2019s Eve \\u2014 enslaved people in the South Carolina Lowcountry gathered in churches to await news of their freedom under the Emancipation Proclamation, which was to be signed on New Year\\u2019s Day 1863. Their celebrations included a menu of Hoppin\\u2019 John, collard greens with hog jowls, and ribs.\", \"\\u201cMy point in publishing these stories in \\u2018Jubilee\\u2019 was to be able to tell a broader story about African Americans and New Year\\u2019s Eve,\\u201d Ms. Tipton-Martin said. \\u201cThis allows you to see strains of African myth in things we think about as classic America.\\u201d\", \"The blurring of what Ms. Tipton-Martin calls \\u201cgood-luck food traditions\\u201d can lead to erasure.\", \"Amethyst Ganaway, a Lowcountry chef and writer, notes that people often refer to black-eyed peas and rice and Hoppin\\u2019 John interchangeably. Both make appearances on Black American tables, but Hoppin\\u2019 John is a one-pot meal of rice and field peas \\u2014 a variety of cowpea that\\u2019s largely available only in the Lowcountry. It is also a bit lighter and redder, and has a creamier consistency, than its black-eyed cousin.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s important to make that distinction, because it\\u2019s really the origins of those traditions get lost,\\u201d Ms. Ganaway said. \\u201cSo many people think that Gullah Lowcountry traditions and people are dying off. No. We\\u2019re here.\\u201d She added, \\u201cIt actually starts here, and it\\u2019s important to remember that it starts here for a reason, so our identity, our foodways aren\\u2019t being erased and turned into this mainstream thing.\\u201d\", \"Though New Year\\u2019s culinary traditions persist across the South, Frederick Opie, a professor of history and foodways at Babson College in Massachusetts, noted that they can take on particular significance for Black Americans.\", \"\\u201cIs there a correlation between a society or a culture that has experienced a larger-than-usual sense of being oppressed and marginalized, and that the hope for the next year means possibly experiencing something better? I suspect that there is,\\u201d he said.\", \"How people celebrate the New Year is also essential to bringing in good will. Dr. Harris hosted parties for nearly two decades in the 1980s and \\u201990s, serving a good-luck menu to as many as 70 guests in her Brooklyn home.\", \"\\u201cIt was a grand thing to do, and I very much enjoyed doing it,\\u201d she said.\", \"Black Americans have found celebration in other foods, too. JJ Johnson, the chef and owner of Fieldtrip in New York, takes guidance from his grandmother, a North Carolina native, when he prepares her seafood gumbo \\u2014 with a few alterations \\u2014 on New Year\\u2019s Eve.\", \"\\u201cI was taught that if you were eating good going into the new year, then you would be good, and you will be healthy,\\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \\u201cFor me, a gumbo like this represents family, luxury and joy.\\u201d\", \"Though the menus may vary, the purpose is the same.\", \"The tradition has \\u201clived on because it\\u2019s fun, and it speaks to aspiration,\\u201d Mr. Miller, the food scholar, said. \\u201cYou always hope that no matter what your condition is, that there\\u2019s always a brighter future.\\u201d\", \"Recipes: Collard Greens and Cornmeal Dumplings | Black-Eyed Peas and Rice | Seafood Gumbo\", \"If you are preparing this seafood gumbo as a New Year\\u2019s celebration and want to stick with sparkling wine throughout the meal, why not? This gumbo should go beautifully with sparklers, whether Champagne or the many others that come from around the world. You could also pair this with many different white wines, like riesling (dry or moderately sweet), albari\\u00f1o, various chardonnays, Loire Valley sauvignon blancs, chenin blancs or even white Bordeaux, so long as they are well balanced and not oaky. I would consider many dry Italian whites. The spicier the gumbo the better a slightly sweet wine will be, like a kabinett or sp\\u00e4tlese riesling or a demi-sec Vouvray. I wouldn\\u2019t pick a red, but if you insist, look for something fresh and light, like a Beaujolais or Beaujolais-Villages.
