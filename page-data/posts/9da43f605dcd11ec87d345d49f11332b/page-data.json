Currently, these groups can only donate if they have abstained from sexual activity for the past three months.\", \"The organization, which operates the nation's blood donations in all provinces and territories except for Quebec, is seeking to move towards a sexual behavior-based screening for all donors, rather than only targeting those who have had sex with another man.\", \"\\\"Sexual behavior, not sexual orientation, determines risk of sexual transmission of HIV,\\\" Canadian Blood Services (CBS) said in a December 3 press release. \\\"The change we are proposing would focus on high-risk sexual behaviour among all donors. It would precisely and reliably identify those who may have a transfusion-transmissible infection, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation.\\\"\", \"The policy prohibiting donations from gay men began as an outright lifetime ban in 1992 during the aftermath of the AIDS crisis.\", \"In the 1980s and early 1990s, thousands of Canadians became infected with HIV after being exposed to contaminated blood products stemming from CBS' predecessor, the Canadian Red Cross, failure to properly screen donors.\", \"While the policy has been modified over the years, slowly allowing for gay men to donate blood so long as they are not sexually active for a determined amount of time, Wednesday's application moves to end the ban entirely.\", \"If it is approved, all donors will be asked if they have recently engaged in anal sex with new or multiple partners within a certain time frame.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1952503/canada-blood-donations-gay-men-ban.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Canadian Blood Services has filed an application to move towards a sexual behaviour-based screening for all donors, regardless of sexual orientation..
