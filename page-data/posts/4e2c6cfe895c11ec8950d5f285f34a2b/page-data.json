The announcers called it a major disappointment.\", \"To some fans, it felt like an uncomfortable or even exploitative intrusion in a dark moment. Many observers on social media drew a parallel to Simone Biles, the American gymnast who has openly talked about the burden of Olympic expectations and how they have affected her mental health, and consequently her performance.\", \"It focused attention on how much sensitivity the news media, which must cover Olympic moments both triumphant and devastating, uses to handle the latter.\", \"For many Olympians in the Winter Games, Biles has served as an inspiration, and they hope she has served as an instructive case for fans, journalists and broadcasters.\", \"\\u201cSimone Biles\\u2019s message was that we\\u2019re not just athletes \\u2014 that we are also humans and not robots,\\u201d said Anna Gasser, a gold medalist in snowboarding who is making her third Olympic appearance.\", \"Shortly after Shiffrin\\u2019s fall, Biles tweeted in support of her.\", \"On Wednesday, the American snowboarder Jamie Anderson, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in slopestyle who finished a disappointing ninth in the event at these Games, took to Instagram to express her vulnerabilities.\", \"\\u201cI just straight up couldn\\u2019t handle the pressure,\\u201d she wrote. \\u201cHad an emotional break down the night before finals and my mental health and clarity just hasn\\u2019t been on par. Looking forward to some time off and self care.\\u201d\", \"One by one, and more than ever, Olympic athletes are displaying their vulnerable sides. It is a healthy shift, they say, for competitors who spend most of four years working in relative seclusion and are then expected to be perfect when their Olympic moment comes.\"]","href_hash":"4e2c6cfe895c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4e2c6cfe895c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
