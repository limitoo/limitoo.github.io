Repeated plays won\\u2019t prepare listeners for how wonderfully loud the chorus gets, how suddenly and furiously the song shifts from a brooding, synth-driven sulk to an all-out temper tantrum of the heart. \\u201cYou always know where to find me when you change your mind,\\u201d she adds, and when is the operative word. This album\\u2019s narrative arc is shaped like a dizzying spin through the K\\u00fcbler-Ross stages of grief, and the opener captures the precise moment that denial billows into a conflagration of hot anger.\", \"Jordan was just 18 when she released the debut Snail Mail album, \\u201cLush,\\u201d and it established her (alongside artists like Soccer Mommy and Vagabon) as a crucial voice in a new wave of young women making feelings-forward, guitar-driven indie rock. (Though she started it as a solo project, Snail Mail is now a trio featuring the bassist Alex Bass and the drummer Ray Brown.)\", \"\\u201cLush,\\u201d though searching and potent, was often about unrequited crushes and unconsummated yearning. On the single \\u201cHeat Wave,\\u201d Jordan offered a quintessential Snail Mail blessing to a person identified by the adoring nickname \\u201cGreen Eyes\\u201d: \\u201cI hope the love that you find swallows you wholly.\\u201d Such obliqueness made sense; Jordan was still quite young, and her processes of self-discovery and uncovering her sexuality both found expression in her songwriting. \\u201cI was always a huge fan of songs about women,\\u201d she told The New York Times in 2018. \\u201cSo when I discovered that was who I was predominantly interested in, I was like, can\\u2019t wait to just start writing songs about women.\\u201d\", \"More explicitly than \\u201cLush,\\u201d though, \\u201cValentine\\u201d is unequivocally an album about women loving women \\u2014 as well as women leaving women, and women occasionally trying to numb heartbreak via dalliances with rebound women. \\u201cSometimes I hate her just for not being you,\\u201d Jordan, now 22, admits on the slinky single \\u201cBen Franklin,\\u201d a song that finds her feigning a blas\\u00e9 attitude but almost immediately folding and admitting that she\\u2019s a \\u201csucker for the pain.\\u201d On the sharply affecting \\u201cAutomate,\\u201d which lurches uneasily forward like someone fumbling for a light switch, Jordan paints a piercing picture with a few simple words: \\u201cRed lips, dark room, I pretend it\\u2019s you, but she kissed like she meant it.\\u201d\", \"Jordan\\u2019s voice has changed since \\u201cLush\\u201d; it\\u2019s become hoarse, feral and absolutely heartbreaking. She often sounds like she\\u2019s just been crying, or maybe still is, and \\u201cValentine\\u201d gives off the overwhelming effect that you are listening to someone moving through feelings in real time \\u2014 that the album itself is an immediate expression of raw, unprocessed grief.\", \"Jordan and her co-producer Brad Cook punch up the drama in these arrangements while still reveling in unvarnished textures. Much of Jordan\\u2019s sensibility \\u2014 her penchant for murky effects pedals; her unconventional sense of melody \\u2014 comes from the world of \\u201990s indie rock. She\\u2019s often called Liz Phair\\u2019s heir apparent, but a more direct influence seems to be Mary Timony, the sonically adventurous solo artist and one-time leader of the band Helium.\", \"At one point when Jordan was growing up in Baltimore, Timony was her guitar teacher, and she seems to have inherited (and filtered through her own unique ear) Timony\\u2019s fascination with unusual chords and a certain husky grain in her voice. Jordan\\u2019s lyrics are full of unanswered questions (\\u201cIsn\\u2019t it strange how it\\u2019s just over?\\u201d), and on a song like the acoustic reverie \\u201cLight Blue\\u201d she is not afraid to augment them with chords that, too, hang in the air unresolved.\", \"\\u201cWhen did you start seeing her?\\u201d Jordan asks on the breathtaking \\u201cHeadlock,\\u201d a perfect distillation of the step forward that \\u201cValentine\\u201d represents in all aspects of Jordan\\u2019s songwriting: clear, direct language and wrenching melody used in the service of vivid emotional truths. \\u201cThought I\\u2019d see her when I died,\\u201d Jordan sings, briefly flirting with oblivion, \\u201cFilled the bath up with warm water, nothing on the other side.\\u201d\", \"By the final song, \\u201cMia,\\u201d though, Jordan will have begged, bargained, languished and at last begun to accept reality. \\u201cGotta grow up now, no I can\\u2019t keep holding on to you anymore,\\u201d she sings, while a subtle string arrangement creeps in like the first glimmers of sunlight after a storm. Jordan\\u2019s ability to feel everything so deeply is what previously made her feel like she was dying, but by the end of the album she shows it\\u2019s also what has given her the strength to move on with her life. As \\u201cValentine\\u201d so poignantly illustrates, the surest route out of a terrible feeling is straight through its bleeding heart.\"]","href_hash":"e74a69643e3d11eca86b273d4a1bb699"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e74a69643e3d11eca86b273d4a1bb699"}},
