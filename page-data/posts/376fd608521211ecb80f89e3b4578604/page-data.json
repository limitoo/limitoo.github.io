Why? Because we share roughly the same approaches and principles.\\\"\", \"And amid international speculation that China's own growing military power, including its nuclear weapons, could cause concern for the Kremlin, Putin said that given their increasingly intimate relationship, Russia has no such fears.\", \"\\\"Great Britain, France announce their plans to modernize their nuclear arsenals. Does the U.S. suffer from that and does this cause its concern? No,\\\" he said. \\\"So why do we have to show any concern over the growing defense potential of our nearest neighbor, with which we enjoy an unprecedentedly high level of inter-state relations? No, this does not frighten us because we are ourselves developing our potential.\\\"\", \"The capacity for Moscow and Beijing to broaden their efforts to work together was further elucidated by Russia's second-most powerful figure, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin.\", \"\\\"Russia-China cooperation is developing amid a complicated international situation,\\\" he said during his 26th regular meeting, held virtually, with Chinese premier Li Keqiang.\", \"\\\"Regrettably, some of our foreign partners continue to take unfriendly actions towards us, using unfair competition and frequently violating the basic norms of the multilateral trade system,\\\" Mishustin added. \\\"Both Russia and China have to deal with the challenge of illegal sanctions and political and economic pressure.\\\"\", \"Echoing Putin, he said the two nations shared common principles.\", \"\\\"The best response in this situation will be rallying efforts in the interests of joint development based on the principles of equality, mutual trust and respect,\\\" Mishustin said, then called for \\\"the alignment of the projects underway in the Eurasian Economic Union with China's Belt and Road Initiative,\\\" two international infrastructure initiatives championed by Putin and Xi, respectively.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942457/russia-putin-china-xi-brics-meeting.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Russian President Vladimir Putin (L) greets Chinese President Xi Jinping (R) during their bilateral meeting on the sidelines of the BRICS leaders summit on November 13, 2019 in Brasilia, Brazil.

You'll see Ground Forces Training and increased logistics cooperation,\\\" Karlin said. \\\"And actually, more broadly, across the Indo-Pacific, you'll see a range of infrastructure improvements in Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and Australia. Those will include things more broadly like logistics facilities, fuel storage, munitions storage, airfield upgrades.\\\"\", \"She also said the review \\\"strengthens the combat credible deterrence against Russian aggression in Europe and enables NATO forces to operate more effectively.\\\"\", \"And while Karlin declined to discuss any matters related to Taiwan, with which the U.S. has only unofficial relations despite providing military assistance, Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby said that, when it comes to Ukraine, the U.S. would \\\"continue to provide security assistance items, both lethal and non-lethal.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942583/china-russia-sibu-zapad-interaction-2021-exercise.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Russian Armed Forces coordinate during the joint Zapad/Sibu-Interaction 2021 joint exercises in this photo published August 8.

The U.S. side should abandon the Cold-War mentality of creating imaginary enemies and stop words and deeds that threaten international peace and security.\\\"\", \"Moscow has also dismissed both Washington and Kyiv's allegations of a Russian military buildup near the border with Ukraine, where war continues between security forces and eastern separatists accused of receiving Russian backing. Putin said Tuesday that it was those living in the two unrecognized breakaway republics that faced \\\"constant threats,\\\" and that the Kremlin too \\\"is concerned to an extent over major military exercises carried out near its borders.\\\"\", \"These drills include those carried out \\\"in the Black Sea just recently, when strategic bombers were flying just 20 kilometers away from our border, armed with precision weapons and potentially even nuclear weapons,\\\" Putin added. \\\"All this poses a threat to us.\\\"\", \"Lavrov too warned that \\\"significant units and military equipment of NATO countries, including those of the U.S. and the U.K., are being deployed closer to our borders,\\\" and suggested Ukraine may be gearing up for an attack.\", \"\\\"In Ukraine itself, near the line of engagement in Donbass, increasingly more forces and equipment are being accumulated with the support of the growing number of Western instructors,\\\" Lavrov said. \\\"Heavy armaments, including drones, directly banned under the Minsk Agreements, are being used against Donetsk and Lugansk.
