His manager thought the outing was a fluke; Fried thought he had failed.\", \"Whether he did or not is no longer relevant: Fried won Game 6 on Tuesday night and Atlanta captured its first World Series title in 26 years. In six innings, the left-hander allowed four hits and held a mighty Houston offense \\u2014 one that had led the majors in runs, hits and batting average \\u2014 scoreless. He recorded six strikeouts and walked no one in his ninth career postseason start.\", \"And in a series where relievers found plenty of work, whether by managerial design or desperation or both, Fried did not reach 70 pitches until there were two outs in the sixth. In the end, he threw 74. Two more Atlanta pitchers, Tyler Matzek and Will Smith, finished off the Astros, who were also done in by mighty swings from Jorge Soler, Dansby Swanson and Freddie Freeman.\", \"\\u201cI just told myself that I was going to go out there and be 100 percent me and just try to pitch and try to win a ballgame,\\u201d Fried said. \\u201cJust kind of the same mentality that I had in the second half: just go out there and keep guys off-balance, just kind of pitch unorthodox and pitch with my eyes.\\u201d\", \"He used a slider to strike out Carlos Correa, Houston\\u2019s All-Star shortstop. Yuli Gurriel, the American League batting champion, went down on three straight fastballs. Alex Bregman, with a Silver Slugger Award on his r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9, also faltered when he faced Fried\\u2019s fastball.\", \"\\u201cHe was way better than the first game,\\u201d said Jose Altuve, who has spent his entire career in Houston and is one of the game\\u2019s best batters. \\u201cHe pitched good. He didn\\u2019t use his curveball too much tonight, but fastball, slider, changeup was really good. He was almost unhittable.\\u201d\", \"Tom Glavine, the winning pitcher in the Game 6 that clinched the World Series for Atlanta in 1995, zeroed in on how Fried had gone after right-handed hitters.\", \"\\u201cThought he made a nice subtle adjustment by using FB and changeup away tonight to keep those righties honest,\\u201d he wrote in a text message, referencing Fried\\u2019s fastball, the very first pitch he fired on Tuesday night.\", \"Indeed, Fried, 27, had made clear before Game 6 that he had no intention of overhauling his approach to Houston\\u2019s lineup. He was looking to make tweaks, though he did throw harder on Tuesday night than he had at any other point in the season.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s just sticking with your strengths, pitching my game and really just trusting what we see with our eyes,\\u201d he said this week. \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to make adjustments. At this time of year, it\\u2019s about just getting outs. So whatever we can do to get outs is what the plan of attack is going to be.\\u201d\", \"Atlanta\\u2019s pitching coach, Rick Kranitz, said that Fried was among the best he had seen at drawing up his own game plan.\", \"\\u201cHe knows exactly what he wants to do \\u2014 exactly,\\u201d Kranitz said on the infield dirt after the game. \\u201cNow it\\u2019s time to get into the flow of the game, like a lot of starters, because if you don\\u2019t get him early, you\\u2019re probably not going to get him and he showed that tonight.\\u201d\", \"But Fried\\u2019s night could have very ended in the first inning, when he galloped backward toward first base to help play a ground ball. He extended his right foot toward the bag \\u2014 and then the right foot of Michael Brantley, who had scurried up the line, slammed into the back of Fried\\u2019s foot and onto his ankle.\", \"It could have become a nightmare revisited for Atlanta, which lost its starting pitcher in Game 1, Charlie Morton, to a broken leg. But after a trainer evaluated Fried, Tuesday\\u2019s starter stuck around.\", \"With two runners on, no one out and a pitcher who was, at the very least, likely to be left feeling the play, it was a gamble for Atlanta. Fried responded by striking out two of the next three hitters, and provoking a grounder from the other.\", \"\\u201cWhen that happened, I think he just locked it in,\\u201d Kranitz said of the collision that, he joked, threatened to send the pitcher and his coach to the hospital together.\", \"Fried retired the Astros in order for four consecutive innings. In the sixth, his last frame of the night, Brantley managed an infield single with two outs. Then Fried struck out Correa again.\", \"And Smith, watching from the Atlanta bullpen, was unsurprised. He had sensed earlier Tuesday that Fried would harass the Houston lineup for as long as he was on the mound.\", \"\\u201cIf Max has a bad one, he\\u2019s more driven and really wants to get it done the next time out,\\u201d Smith said. \\u201cHe had this look on his face all day. He was nice and relaxed when he first got in the clubhouse today, but he was motivated, he was driven. He looked like a different Max, honestly.\\u201d\", \"Different enough to go from loser to winner \\u2014 and World Series champion \\u2014 in six days.\"]","href_hash":"77c7397a3cd811ec8415000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"77c7397a3cd811ec8415000017025a03"}},
