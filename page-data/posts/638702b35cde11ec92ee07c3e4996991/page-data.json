She said it can be extremely difficult for a woman who has just given birth to comply with the laws, when different states have different rules about where a child can be left and in a small window of time.\", \"\\\"They make it sound like as you can have a baby and you can drop it off and never have to worry about that baby again,\\\" she said. \\\"That is the myth, that is the hoax.\\\"\", \"Mississippi's safe haven law, for instance, requires an infant no older than 72 hours to be left at an emergency medical services provider, defined as a licensed hospital operating an emergency department or an adoption agency licensed by the Department of Human Services.\", \"\\\"Let's say you are desperate mother who gave birth\\u2026 you drop the baby off at the fire station in Mississippi instead of an emergency medical service provider. You can be guilty and arrested for abandonment of a child, desertion, or non-support of a child, contributing to the neglect or delinquency of a child,\\\" Paltrow said. \\\"These are not panaceas, where you drop off your child and the state of Mississippi raise it with respect and care for you.\\\"\", \"Elizabeth Bartholet, a professor at Harvard Law School, agreed that Barrett's remarks are \\\"ignorant and misleading about the reality of the abortion decision.\\\"\", \"However, she noted that safe haven laws are \\\"infinitely better than having such women feel pressured into abandonment of the baby in unsafe ways or, worst case, murdering the baby.\\\"\", \"But she pointed to disadvantages that include leaving a child \\\"without any ability later in life to know who its forebears were.\\\"\", \"In any case, safe haven relinquishments are incredibly rare, Sisson said, and it's impossible to know the circumstances in which they are used.\", \"She said her research has found that most women who are denied an abortion don't give their child up for adoption, but choose to parent instead. A study she conducted with other researchers found 91 percent of women who were denied an abortion chose to parent, while just nine percent placed the infant for adoption.\", \"\\\"What we know is that women who want to have abortions are uninterested in adoption,\\\" she said. \\\"It's not a function of just avoiding parenting, it's about not wanting to continue their pregnancies.\\\"\", \"And for those who do choose adoption, Sisson says her ongoing research shows that there is \\\"almost universally\\\" a sense of mourning and grief involved.\", \"\\\"It's important to remember that the anti-abortion movement in the United States tells birth mothers and women who relinquish that they're heroes and they're selfless and they've made a brave and loving choice,\\\" she continued. \\\"So some of them will come out of that grief and feel really quite good about their decision.\\\"\", \"But Sisson said those who initially felt positively about their decision rarely felt as good when she returned to interview them years later.\", \"\\\"Even when an adoption works out well, as it did in my case, it is still fraught,\\\" Elizabeth Spiers wrote in a recent guest essay for The New York Times, describing how her biological mother found the choice \\\"traumatizing and still feels that pain\\\" decades later.\", \"Spiers added: \\\"The right likes to suggest that abortion is a traumatic experience for women\\u2014a last resort, a painful memory. But adoption is often just as traumatic as the right thinks abortion is, if not more so, as a woman has to relinquish not a lump of cells but a fully formed baby she has lived with for nine months.\\\"\", \"Paltrow said adoption should always be available as a choice for birth parents, but it \\\"has to be because it is done for reasons that they're comfortable with, not because it's the only option they're left with.\\\"\", \"Howell added: \\\"The ultimate problem that we're looking at is whether or not women have the right to make decisions about their own bodies.
