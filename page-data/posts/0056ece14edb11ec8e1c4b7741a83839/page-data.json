Only several dozen cases have been fully identified so far in South Africa, Botswana, Hong Kong and Israel.\", \"The new variant, B.1.1.529, has a \\u201cvery unusual constellation of mutations,\\u201d with more than 30 in the spike protein alone, according to Tulio de Oliveira, director of the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform.\", \"On the ACE2 receptor \\u2014 the protein that helps to create an entry point for the coronavirus to infect human cells \\u2014 the new variant has 10 mutations. In comparison, the Beta variant has three and the Delta variant two, Mr. de Oliveira said.\", \"The variant shares similarities with the Lambda and Beta variants, which are associated with an innate evasion of immunity, said Richard Lessells, an infectious diseases specialist at the KwaZulu-Natal Research and Innovation Sequencing Platform.\", \"\\u201cAll these things are what give us some concern that this variant might have not just enhanced transmissibility, so spread more efficiently, but might also be able to get around parts of the immune system and the protection we have in our immune system,\\u201d Dr. Lessells said.\", \"The new variant has largely been detected among young people, the cohort that also has the lowest vaccination rate in South Africa. Just over a quarter of those ages between 18 and 34 in South Africa are vaccinated, said Dr. Joe Phaahla, the country\\u2019s minister of health.\", \"While cases of the variant are mainly concentrated in the country\\u2019s economic hub, particularly in the country\\u2019s administrative capital, Pretoria, it is \\u201conly a matter of time\\u201d before the virus spreads across the country as schools close and families prepare to travel for the holiday season, Dr. Phaahla said.\"]","href_hash":"0056ece14edb11ec8e1c4b7741a83839"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0056ece14edb11ec8e1c4b7741a83839"}},
