Russian planes are currently flying about 300 sorties a day.\", \"Further, Russian forces appear to be running lowest on air-launched cruise missiles and may be trying conserve those missiles, the official said. Though they still have about 50% of their stockpile remaining, the declining stocks of precision-guided missiles is a factor in the increasing use of dumb bombs.\\u00a0 Russia's assault on Ukraine, now in its 30th day, has fired 1,260 missiles, according to the official.\\u00a0\", \"It appears that Russia, for the moment, is not pursuing a ground offense against Kyiv, though the capital continues to be hammered by missile and artillery fire.

From the images available, officials believe that Ukraine destroyed the ship.\\u00a0\", \"The heaviest fighting continues to be taking place in Mariupol, Donbass, Mykolaiv and Chernihiv.
