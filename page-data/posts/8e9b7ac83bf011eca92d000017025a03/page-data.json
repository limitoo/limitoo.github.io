The 43,122 Atlanta fans filling Truist Park, early arrivals and in the mood to party with a clinching World Series win within reach, exploded into a raucous din. They believed the grand slam, only the 21st in World Series history, signaled their divine right to celebrate.\", \"It was the first inning.\", \"As Atlanta quickly found out, the Houston Astros are here for a reason, too, even if they hadn\\u2019t exhibited it much lately. But they finally found their offensive groove just when they needed it, facing elimination in Game 5. A shake-up in the lineup and a big day by a light-hitting catcher produced a series-saving 9-5 victory for the Astros.\", \"\\u201cToday really felt like the World Series because they got to go on the field and see all the people and see all the media,\\u201d Houston Manager Dusty Baker said. \\u201cIt felt like the World Series, where the others felt like we were coming out of the dungeon and just going to play.\", \"\\u201cSo that was big, the fact that we got to get on the field.\\u201d\", \"It had been a tough few days for the Astros. They hadn\\u2019t played in Atlanta since 2017 and, because of cold and rainy conditions, not only was their planned workout on Thursday evening canceled, but pregame on-field batting practice before Games 3 and 4 was wiped out, too. So the only time the Astros were on the unfamiliar field was during the games themselves.\", \"Offensively, it showed. They scored only two runs over the first 18 innings here, losing games 2-0 and 3-2 and having a terrible time throughout. Including the games in Houston, the Astros were 4 for 31 with runners in scoring position for this series.\", \"But Baker stubbornly said \\u201cI believe in miracles\\u201d before Game 5 and it seemed as if his team might need one as the Astros had left 17 runners on base during the first two games in Atlanta.\", \"One fact Baker cited before Game 5 was the fact that as recently as the 2016 World Series, the Chicago Cubs trailed Cleveland three games to one but came back to win the title.\", \"Houston\\u2019s offense woke up, finally, on Sunday when the skies cleared and the area dried. The Astros scheduled some early work on the field for midafternoon, before Atlanta\\u2019s batting practice session. Whether that alone brought change, or whether the Astros\\u2019 hitters are simply too good to be held down for too long, things changed dramatically in Game 5.\", \"Down by 4-0 early, Houston scratched across two runs in the second when Yuli Gurriel drove a one-out single to center, Kyle Tucker walked and Alex Bregman, struggling so badly that Baker dropped him to seventh in the lineup, knocked an R.B.I. double. Tucker then scored on catcher Mart\\u00edn Maldonado\\u2019s fly ball to center field.\", \"It was a beginning to some, more than that to others.\", \"\\u201cI think that was the key of us winning the game right there, bouncing back right away, those two runs,\\u201d Houston shortstop Carlos Correa said. \\u201cBregman getting that huge double. Getting the confidence all the way up.\\u201d\", \"Bregman had gone 0 for 5 in Game 4, striking out twice and failing to hit the ball out of the infield. He is hitting only .111 (2 for 18) in this World Series even after his Game 5 double, and .171 (7 for 41) since the start of the A.L. Championship Series. Baker dropped him from third to seventh in the lineup, and Bregman was one of the Astros out early to hit on the field Sunday.\", \"\\u201cA few guys hit early who needed work,\\u201d Baker said, before flashing a knowing grin and continuing: \\u201cLike Bregman.\\u201d\", \"Scoring two runs immediately after Duvall had brought the crowd to its feet didn\\u2019t even the score quite yet, but it energized the Houston dugout.\", \"\\u201cFrom the moment we scored those two runs we said, \\u2018all right, it\\u2019s time to go. Let\\u2019s go,\\u2019\\u201d Correa said. \\u201cLet\\u2019s put great at-bats together. Let\\u2019s fight. Let\\u2019s battle.\\u201d\", \"Said Baker: \\u201cThat was a shutdown inning for them, but we answered back with two and that made it a 2-0 game versus a 4-0 game.\\u201d\", \"From the Atlanta dugout, despite the sensational autumn work of his bullpen, Manager Brian Snitker was far from comfortable in the immediate aftermath of Duvall\\u2019s grand slam because \\u201cI\\u2019d rather score those runs in the seventh inning when you don\\u2019t have so much time to cover.\\u201d\", \"The Astros tied it, 4-4, with two more runs in the third. Atlanta shortstop Dansby Swanson booted a ground ball to give Houston a start there. Then the Astros shook off a Freddie Freeman homer that briefly put Atlanta on top, 5-4, by scoring three more times in the fifth. Correa and Yuli Gurriel rapped base hits, Bregman was intentionally walked and Maldonado followed by working a clutch, bases-loaded walk against Atlanta reliever A.J. Minter.\", \"Maldonado said he was expecting Bregman to get the intentional pass, and he was ready.\", \"\\u201cI wasn\\u2019t going to swing to get a strike,\\u201d Maldonado said. \\u201cIt was pretty much try and be patient. I know he\\u2019s got a good cutter. He\\u2019s been amazing this year so far with that pitch. And you try to see him out for the most part.\\u201d\", \"Maldonado, the defensive stalwart at catcher who typically contributes little offensively, had drawn only one walk in 47 plate appearances this postseason at the time. But on a night when Houston was desperate for help from all corners of its roster, Maldonado stepped up. The player who finished with the worst batting average during the regular season of all big league catchers with at least 400 plate appearances (.172) finished with three RBIs the third coming on a base hit in the seventh two batters after a Bregman double.\", \"Correa chipped in an R.B.I. single in the eighth that was an unnecessary, but welcome, insurance run. It was Houston\\u2019s fifth Game 5 hit with runners in scoring position \\u2014 one more than the Astros produced in the first four games combined.\", \"It all wiped out the Duvall grand slam that so many here figured was a sure sign that Atlanta was going to clinch its first World Series title since 1995. It was the first World Series grand slam in the first inning since the Yankees\\u2019 Bobby Richardson hit one in the 1960 World Series.\", \"That, and the fact that Atlanta was a perfect 7-0 at home this postseason, seemed to be premonitions for a big celebration in this town overnight Sunday. Instead, the World Series now will move back to Houston for Game 6 on Tuesday night, with the Astros\\u2019 offense showing signs of life and at least some indication that, perhaps, there may be a long way to go yet in this series.\"]","href_hash":"8e9b7ac83bf011eca92d000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8e9b7ac83bf011eca92d000017025a03"}},
