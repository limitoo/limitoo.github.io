The school\\u2019s online M.B.A. program was ranked best in the country by U.S. News & World Report in the years that he falsified data.\", \"Prosecutors said Mr. Porat had conspired with Isaac Gottlieb, then a business professor, and Marjorie O\\u2019Neill, then the school\\u2019s finance and accounting manager, to submit inflated metrics to the publication about enrollment, test scores and student work experience.\", \"A date has not been set for Mr. Porat\\u2019s sentencing, said Jennifer Crandall, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney\\u2019s office. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years in prison and a $500,000 fine, prosecutors said in April.\", \"Mr. Gottlieb pleaded guilty in June and Ms. O\\u2019Neill in May to a count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. Mr. Gottlieb is scheduled to be sentenced in March and Ms. O\\u2019Neill in December, Ms. Crandall said. They each face a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $500,000 fine, prosecutors said in a statement in April.\", \"A lawyer for Mr. Porat did not respond to emails and phone calls on Monday. It was not clear which lawyers represented Mr. Gottlieb and Ms. O\\u2019Neill.\", \"\\u201cThis case was certainly unusual, but at its foundation it is just a case of fraud and underlying greed,\\u201d Jennifer Arbittier Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, said in the statement on Monday. She said Mr. Porat had misrepresented information to \\u201cdefraud the rankings system, potential students and donors.\\u201d\", \"Between 2014 and 2018, because of the fraudulent data, the business school\\u2019s online and part-time M.B.A. programs saw an abrupt lift in the rankings from U.S. News & World Report, prosecutors said. Colleges and universities often jockey for a high position in the publication\\u2019s yearly college rankings, which are closely followed, so they can draw talented students and raise fund-raising dollars.\", \"Temple\\u2019s part-time M.B.A. program rose from 53rd in the country in 2014 to seventh in 2017, prosecutors said. It is now ranked 41st. The online M.B.A. program was rated the best in the country between 2015 and 2018, but it is now ranked at 100 out of more than 300.\", \"Prosecutors said Mr. Porat \\u201cboasted about these rankings\\u201d in marketing material for the business school.\", \"\\u201cEnrollment in Fox\\u2019s O.M.B.A. and P.M.B.A. programs grew dramatically in a few short years, which led to millions of dollars a year in increased tuition revenues,\\u201d prosecutors said in the statement on Monday.\", \"In a statement in April, Terry Harris, a special agent in charge of the Education Department\\u2019s Office of Inspector General, said Mr. Porat abused his position of trust to defraud students.\", \"\\u201cWe will continue to aggressively pursue those who scam students or rig the system for their selfish purposes,\\u201d she said.\", \"Mr. Porat, of Bala Cynwyd, Pa., was the business school dean between 1996 and 2018, until he was fired for falsifying the data, prosecutors said. The school reported to U.S. News & World Report in 2018 that it had misrepresented data. Temple hired the law firm Jones Day to review the business school\\u2019s data reporting process, and the firm found that the school had misreported data as far back as 2014, according to the university\\u2019s website.\", \"Temple has paid around $17 million in settlements to former students, the U.S. Department of Education and the Pennsylvania attorney general\\u2019s office, a university spokesman said on Monday.\", \"In a statement on Monday, a university spokesman said, \\u201cThis is an unhappy moment for our students and alumni.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe evidence presented at the trial speaks for itself, but is not representative of Temple,\\u201d he said.\", \"Temple University is not the only institution that has been caught manipulating the college ranking system \\u2014 in particular, the avidly watched U.S. News & World Report rankings \\u2014 by twisting the meanings of rules, cherry-picking data or just lying.\", \"In 2011, Iona College in New Rochelle, north of New York City, acknowledged that its employees had lied for years not only about test scores, but also about graduation rates, freshman retention, student-faculty ratio, acceptance rates and alumni giving.\", \"Claremont McKenna College, a small, prestigious California school, admitted in 2012 that it had submitted false SAT scores for years to publications like U.S. News & World Report.\"]","href_hash":"7f14072a518811ecb7f95fd2509649cc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7f14072a518811ecb7f95fd2509649cc"}},
