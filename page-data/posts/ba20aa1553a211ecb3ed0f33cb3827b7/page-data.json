power is already here \\u2014\\u00a0at least sometimes.\", \"Last Saturday\\u00a0in South Australia, renewables accounted for a staggering\\u00a0135\\u00a0per cent of total demand, breaking the world record for the\\u00a0proportion\\u00a0of solar and\\u00a0wind supplied to a\\u00a0large grid.\", \"As a result of all this excess generation, the spot price of power fell to\\u00a0minus $35.95 per megawatt hour.\", \"Energy generation was curtailed, batteries charged up, and the excess exported to Victoria, which is connected to the SA grid.\", \"\\\"It's a glimpse of the future,\\\" says Frank Jotzo, a professor of climate change economics at Australian National University (ANU).\", \"The decline in electricity\\u00a0prices is largely thanks to new solar, wind and battery\\u00a0projects

cheaper generation doesn't entirely flow through to consumers is the cost of building transmission links to new renewables projects, as well as adding storage\\u00a0(big batteries or pumped hydro).\", \"The storage is necessary to \\\"firm\\\" the grid,\\u00a0so that stored energy can be used when renewables cannot meet demand.\", \"This cost will increase as renewables contribute a greater share

consumption\\u00a0from his phone.\", \"As you might guess, it's easy to lose yourself in watching the market.\", \"If Mr Scanlon allowed it to, the retailer could also use the smart inverter to turn\\u00a0off his energy-intensive appliances, like the air conditioner\\u00a0or the pool pump, in response to increases\\u00a0in the price of electricity.\", \"All these gizmos add up to a new kind of relationship between the energy consumers, retailers,\\u00a0the grid, and the generators.\", \"Instead of paying a standard monthly bill for access to electricity generated at a\\u00a0central power station, households\\u00a0will have the opportunity to be minor electricity moguls, taking advantage of negative price events, such as the one in South Australia last Saturday.\", \"A fully charged\\u00a0electrical vehicle battery\\u00a0can power a standard home for three days, so with the right charging infrastructure, households could conceivably scoop up vast amounts of free power a few times a week and get away with paying nothing the rest of the time.\", \"\\\"I'm happy to keep refining our energy consumption,\\\" Mr Scanlon said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">I don't own a
