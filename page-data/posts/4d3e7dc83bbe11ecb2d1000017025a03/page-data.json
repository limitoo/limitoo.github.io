Morris, 61, an assistant professor of nursing at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. You don\\u2019t need to be an accomplished writer with perfect penmanship and spelling; the words are for you. Try to establish a routine in which you write for 15 minutes several times a week, even if you get just one or two sentences down in a session. Put writing in your calendar as you would other things you schedule. Morris is always urging her students to journal, a practice she calls \\u201cCPR for the soul.\\u201d\", \"Self-reflective writing can be especially beneficial if your work requires constant caretaking, empathy or an outpouring of emotional energy. In a study of 66 registered nurses, six weeks of journaling was found to decrease burnout and compassion fatigue and increase feelings of satisfaction. To get started, just start. \\u201cWrite by hand,\\u201d Morris says. If you find yourself ruminating on something negative that happened during your day \\u2014 a mistake you made, an argument, a patient you couldn\\u2019t help \\u2014 jot down what happened and how it made you feel. \\u201cGet it out of your head and onto the page,\\u201d Morris says. Remember, though: A journal is more than a dumping ground for bleakness. It can be a repository of lightness too. Sometimes it helps to give yourself a prompt \\u2014 like, write down three things you are grateful for today or three things that brought you joy. It might feel corny at first, but tilting your thinking toward positivity can alter the chemistry of your brain.\", \"Date your entries so you can go back, should you choose to. If you are worried about someone else\\u2019s reading your journal, find a place to hide it or lock it away. \\u201cWrite it down and burn it if you have to, but do write it down,\\u201d Morris says. You will begin to forget things otherwise; details of events that seem sharp and extraordinary now will begin to erode. A journal, even an imperfect and sparse one, can pull particulars back into focus. Morris became a nurse in 1983 and spent many years assisting with births. She wishes she had written down more about those experiences \\u2014 each birth so specific, miraculous, sometimes harrowing but now blurred and mostly unretrievable. \\u201cYou think you won\\u2019t forget,\\u201d Morris says. \\u201cBut you do.\\u201d\", \"\"]","href_hash":"4d3e7dc83bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4d3e7dc83bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}},
