People might still get hospitalized, but the level would be so low that we don't think about it all the time and it doesn't influence what we do.\\\"\", \"\\\"Look what other countries are doing now about adopting a booster campaign virtually for everybody. I think if we do that, and we do it in earnest, I think by the spring we can have pretty good control of this,\\\" the infectious disease expert added.\", \"However, a day earlier, Fauci also warned that the virus is starting to climb in some areas after stabilizing from this summer's delta surge. On Sunday, the U.S. reported a seven-day average of more than 82,000 new cases, up 11 percent from the week before, according to a CNBC analysis of data.\", \"\\\"The only thing that's a little bit disconcerting is that we're beginning to plateau,\\\" Fauci said during a Monday interview hosted by the Bipartisan Policy Center. \\\"In other words, the deceleration of cases is now plateaued, and in some areas of the country, we're starting to see a bit of an uptick.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1933915/dr-anthony-fauci-pandemic-end.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Dr. Anthony Fauci said this week that COVID-19 cases are rising in some areas, but the pandemic may come to an end by next year if enough Americans are vaccinated.

However, the infectious disease expert said that those who have been vaccinated should feel comfortable to gather with loved ones for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday.\", \"\\\"When you're with your family at home, goodness, enjoy it with your parents, your children, your grandparents,\\\" he said. \\\"There's no reason not to do that.\\\"\", \"So far, over 68 percent of the U.S. population has received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine, while nearly 59 percent are fully vaccinated, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.\"]","href_hash":"c8815011472f11ecae9abf5c74a1122a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c8815011472f11ecae9abf5c74a1122a"}},
