But Mr. Bottura\\u2019s executive chef, Mattia Agazzi, worked with a panettone master, Roy Schvartzapel, on two versions of the tall eggy dome of Christmas cake for the restaurant on Rodeo Drive that they\\u2019re also selling online. One is studded with candied orange and raisins, the other with orange and hazelnut gianduja, each in a decorative tin designed by Gucci. And if you would like to explore other panettone options, this year the first New York City panettone festival will be held in Queens, with more than a dozen chefs baking varieties like white fig with chocolate; saffron; or apricot, along with other holiday treats for sampling and sale.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook and Pinterest.
