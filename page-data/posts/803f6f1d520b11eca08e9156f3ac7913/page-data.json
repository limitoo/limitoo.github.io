Airy, light-filled and glass-walled, it provides a sharp contrast to the low-ceiling, brick-walled original, which opened 10 years ago. Inside, there\\u2019s an open kitchen and 60 seats, with another 60 on the sidewalk. As different as the space looks, the menu is a near copy of what Mr. Stupak serves downtown, with queso fundido, guacamole, quesadillas and tacos with fillings like fish tempura with cabbage and tartar sauce, brussels sprouts with spicy almonds, and shrimp with avocado and pumpkin seeds. Tequilas and mezcals fuel a large share of the drinks by Noah Small, who has been with Mr. Stupak\\u2019s organization for years. (Opens Friday) \", \"The chef Christian Rowan, an alumnus of Bouley, Le Bernardin and Eleven Madison Park, created this American bistro, which takes creative liberties with comfort classics. He named the restaurant for his grandmother. On his menu are clam chowder potpie, caramelized onion focaccia with assorted toppings, grilled calamari with spiced almond dip, honey and miso-brined chicken, hangar steak with brussels sprouts and cheesy potato pur\\u00e9e, and warm homemade \\u201cpop tarts.\\u201d Beyond a 12-seat bar with some high-top tables nearby is the dining room, done with velvet banquettes and floral details. (Wednesday) \", \"This 10-year-old Chinese restaurant, which was awarded a Michelin star, has reopened after a pandemic hiatus a block to the east in Murray Hill. Yiming Wang and her husband, Xian Zhang, have moved it into a brick building that\\u2019s nearly 100 years old. The restaurant occupies three floors with a spacious main-floor dining room and bar; a mezzanine on the second floor with wraparound counter seating and some tables in a library-style setting; rooms for private events; and a skylighted top floor with communal tables for parties or dining. The d\\u00e9cor reflects Ms. Wang\\u2019s sense of Shanghai style with Western touches. Caf\\u00e9 China\\u2019s popular tea-smoked duck is back, and new to the menu are boneless pork trotters and short ribs in a clay pot. Though their TriBeCa restaurant, China Blue, closed permanently during the pandemic, their Birds of a Feather in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, remains open. (Wednesday)\", \"\", \"Stephen Starr is reopening this high-end restaurant in the New York Edition hotel at Madison Square Park. The restaurant returned from its pandemic closing in September but with a temporary menu. Now the original chef, Jason Atherton from England, is back. He\\u2019s replacing his old menu, a mix of English, French and American influences, with one he\\u2019s calling \\u201c100 percent British, like the food back home.\\u201d Scotch egg with walnut ketchup, London gin-cured salmon with an English muffin, braised lamb shepherd\\u2019s pie, beef Wellington, and beer-battered cod with mushy peas and seaweed tartar sauce are on the savory side, with English custard tart and banoffee baked alaska among the sweets. \", \"Mark Fox\\u2019s collection of bars and lounges now includes this stylishly elegant den next door to his Ragtrader, a more industrial-looking space in a former garment district factory. Though big, with 180 seats, it\\u2019s divided into more intimate nooks. Food- and drink-themed vintage art hangs on the walls. Whiskey is featured with more than 400 labels, including rarities, poured individually, in flights or, with a $275 Whiskey Passport, a choice of any 10 from a curated list of 28. David Orellana, who was the beverage director at Zuma and Quality Italian, is in charge of beverages; Justin Ottervanger, who was at Ragtrader, is executive chef with David Sokolov as chef de cuisine, preparing dishes like hamachi crudo, beef tartare with Buffalo wing seasonings, lamb samosas and dirty rice arancini. (Wednesday) \", \"This Williamsburg pizzeria has opened a branch on the lower level of Rockefeller Center. It will operate until the end of the year. A more permanent installation will open early next year. For now, they\\u2019re selling the Detroit-style pies for which they\\u2019re known, Grandma pizza slices and sandwiches like meatball and chicken parm subs, which they do not have at their Brooklyn location. (Friday)\", \"This Australian bakery group specializing in sourdough loaves, baguettes, pastries and so forth, has opened a second location, this time in Chelsea. (It made its American debut, on East 28th Street, more than two years ago.) The new bakery has seating indoors and out for baked goods, sandwiches and sausage rolls. Jessica Grynberg, who owns the bakeries with her husband, the chef and baker Paul Allam, said Fine Food Frozen, the group\\u2019s line of frozen items, was so successful during the pandemic that they expanded the inventory in the new store. They also plan a third iteration on the Upper West Side near the Beacon Theater, to open soon. \", \"The coffee company\\u2019s first cafe with roasting on the premises has opened on the Lower East Side, in a spacious area at Whole Foods Market. \", \"As the weather chills, the appeal of dining outdoors, a pandemic solution, is likely to diminish. But there\\u2019s a newfangled version of the streetside cabana. Called the Cube from Podnology, a company based in Providence, R.I., it is higher tech than most, with heat from solar panels, high-quality ventilation, air-conditioning, Bluetooth sound system, soundproofing and seating for up to 10. The first example in the United States is in front of Empanada Mama\\u2019s Hell\\u2019s Kitchen location at 765 Ninth Avenue (51st Street). \", \"The Association of Les Grandes Tables du Monde, an organization founded in Paris in 1954, has awarded Mr. Boulud, the New York-based chef and restaurateur with a global presence, the Bernardaud Prize for best restaurateur in the world.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
