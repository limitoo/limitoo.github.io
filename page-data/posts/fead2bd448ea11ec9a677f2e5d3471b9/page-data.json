After decades of isolation, internet use became widespread in Cuba in 2018 \\u2014 many young Cubans are now highly active on social media, where the anthem spread like wildfire. The accompanying video has been viewed more than 9 million times on YouTube.\", \"The song\\u2019s release came just a few months after hundreds of artists, intellectuals and others demonstrated outside the Ministry of Culture in Havana to protest a slew of recent arrests, including that of the rapper Denis Sol\\u00eds.\", \"\\u201cThat protest transformed the narrative of the opposition in Cuba,\\u201d said Rafael Escalona, the director of the Cuban music magazine AM:PM. \\u201cThere was fertile ground for someone to reap the fruits and create a protest anthem.\\u201d\", \"On July 11, \\u201cPatria y Vida\\u201d was transformed into a rallying cry, when Cuba witnessed its largest protests in decades, with Cubans protesting over power outages, food shortages and a lack of medicines.\", \"\\u201cThis is my way of telling you, my people are crying out and I feel their voice,\\u201d the song says. \\u201cNo more lies, my people ask for freedom. No more doctrines, let\\u2019s not sing of homeland or death but homeland and life.\\u201d\", \"Hundreds of people were jailed after the July demonstrations, and at least 40 more were detained on Monday as the regime moved to stifle another planned march.\", \"The risks extended to the songwriters too.\", \"While most of the artists who collaborated on the song were well known internationally before the track\\u2019s release and were also living outside of Cuba, Maykel Osorbo and El Funky still lived on the island: Both were arrested earlier this year, and Osorbo remains in jail. Romero, who lives in Miami, said that he cannot return to the island for fear of arrest.\", \"But despite the crackdown, Romero said he is confident that the emerging movement fomented by Cuba\\u2019s youth and given a soundtrack by \\u201cPatria y Vida\\u201d is only just getting started.\", \"\\u201cThis is no longer a movement, it\\u2019s generation. It\\u2019s the generation patria y vida,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe generation patria y vida has come to bury the generation patria o muerte.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"fead2bd448ea11ec9a677f2e5d3471b9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fead2bd448ea11ec9a677f2e5d3471b9"}},
