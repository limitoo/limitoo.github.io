Over and over again, immigration has proved to be politically problematic for Democrats. As far back as 2007, when he was chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Rahm Emanuel warned that immigration had become the new \\u201cthird rail of American politics.\\u201d\", \"Mary C. Waters, a sociologist at Harvard whose work focuses \\u201con the integration of immigrants and their children, the transition to adulthood for the children of immigrants, intergroup relations, and the measurement and meaning of racial and ethnic identity,\\u201d concisely described the immigration paradox in an email:\", \"While those \\u201cwho favor immigration favor a lot of other issues,\\u201d Waters continued,\", \"Waters is chairman of the National Academy of Sciences panel on the integration of immigrants into American society. Americans, she points out,\", \"The reality of the politics of immigration stands in contrast to the more positive Gallup findings that the percentage of people describing immigration as a \\u201cgood thing\\u201d grew from 52 to 75 percent from 2001 to 2021, and the percentage describing it as a \\u201cbad thing\\u201d fell from 31 to 21 percent. Over the past 20 years, the percentage of voters who say immigration should be increased grew from 10 to 33 percent, while the share who said it should be decreased fell from 43 to 31 percent. The percentage saying immigration levels should be left unchanged remained relatively constant over these two decades, ranging from the mid-30s to the low 40s.\", \"Despite these ostensible leftward trends, however, there is no question that immigration has become a worsening problem for President Biden, and that surging illegal border crossings are weighing down his administration. \\u201cA record 1.7 million migrants from around the world, many of them fleeing pandemic-ravaged countries, were encountered trying to enter the United States illegally in the last 12 months, capping a year of chaos at the southern border,\\u201d two of my Times colleagues, Eileen Sullivan and Miriam Jordan, reported on Oct. 22.\", \"The percentage of adults who disapprove of Biden\\u2019s handling of immigration grew from 39 percent when he took office to 59 percent in late September, according to YouGov tracking surveys. The disappointing showing of Democrats up and down the ticket on Tuesday, in Virginia, in Pennsylvania judicial races and in the closer-than-expected New Jersey governor\\u2019s race collectively signal substantial problems for Democrats going forward.\", \"The predicament immigration poses goes well beyond politics. Roger Waldinger, a professor of sociology at U.C.L.A., described the broader implications in an email:\", \"As the Gallup world poll has repeatedly shown, Waldinger continued, \\u201ca very large share of the world\\u2019s population has an interest in migrating abroad,\\u201d especially to countries \\u201cwhere migration yields a very significant payoff.\\u201d\", \"The incentives are not limited to economics:\", \"All of these factors, Waldinger added, \\u201care compounded by the effects of climate change and the political insecurities that are driving displacement worldwide.\\u201d\", \"These forces, in turn, work to the advantage of the political right, Waldinger continued, and \\u201cunfortunately for the left, I don\\u2019t see how it can altogether avoid immigration.\\u201d\", \"Waldinger notes that\", \"At the same time, Waldinger argues, there is a hidden\", \"The United States, more than any other nation, cannot avoid the conflicts and disputes provoked by immigration. This country is not only has the most immigrants of any country in the world, it is also the first-choice destination of most potential immigrants and, possibly most confounding, it has become inextricably dependent on foreign-born workers to perform essential tasks.\", \"The federal Bureau of Labor Statistics published data in the May 2021 bulletin establishing that\", \"The bureau reported that significantly higher percentages of foreign born than native born workers are employed in health care, food preparation, farming, construction and extraction occupations.\", \"A Nov. 12, 2019 headline in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel captured the situation succinctly: \\u201cWisconsin\\u2019s dairy industry would collapse without the work of Latino immigrants \\u2014 many of them undocumented.\\u201d\", \"Evidence of the dependence on immigrant workers became glaringly apparent during the Covid pandemic.\", \"An April 2020 study \\u201cImmigrant Workers: Vital to the U.S. Covid-19 Response, Disproportionately Vulnerable\\u201d released by the Migration Policy Institute stated that\", \"A separate December 2020 study, \\u201cImmigrant Essential Workers are Crucial to America\\u2019s Covid-19 Recovery,\\u201d put together by the pro-immigrant group, Fwd.us, showed that\", \"Ren\\u00e9 D.

In response to my inquiry, Flores wrote by email that in survey and focus group research, he and his colleagues have observed that \\u201cjust mentioning the term \\u2018immigrants\\u2019 is a negative prime among U.S. individuals. It leads them to express more restrictionist views.\\u201d\", \"Compounding the problem for pro-immigration Democrats, Flores wrote, is that \\u201cexposing U.S. individuals to positive messages about immigration has no effect on their policy attitudes\\u201d because when \\u201cindividuals read negative messages on immigrants, they become motivated to express restrictionist views, particularly conservative and low-educated individuals.\\u201d\", \"Democrats, Flores said, carry \\u201ca bigger burden\\u201d in the debate over immigration:\", \"In a recently presented paper, \\u201cThe American Immigration Disagreement: How Whites\\u2019 Diverse Perceptions of Immigrants Shape their Attitudes,\\u201d Flores and Ariel Azar, a graduate student in sociology at the University of Chicago, found that white attitudes toward immigrants could be broken up into \\u201cfive main classes or \\u2018immigrant archetypes\\u2019 that come to whites\\u2019 minds when they respond to questions about immigrants in surveys.\\u201d\", \"The authors, describing in broad outline the various images of immigrants held by whites, gave the five archetypes names: \\u201cthe undocumented Latino man\\u201d (38 percent), the \\u201cpoor, nonwhite immigrant\\u201d (18.5 percent), the \\u201chigh status worker\\u201d (17 percent), the \\u201cdocumented Latina worker\\u201d (15 percent) and the \\u201crainbow undocumented immigrant\\u201d (12 percent).\", \"Two groups elicit the highest levels of opposition to immigration, the authors write:\", \"The authors identify the survey respondents who are most resistant to immigration:\", \"A forthcoming paper in the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, \\u201cIntervening in Anti-Immigrant Sentiments: The Causal Effects of Factual Information on Attitudes Toward Immigration,\\u201d by Maria Abascal, Tiffany J.
