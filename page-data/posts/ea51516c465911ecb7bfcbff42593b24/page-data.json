The F.B.I. special agent, Thomas P. Joy Jr., said footage showed the distinct glow of a fire ignition moments later.\", \"Mr. Sechriest\\u2019s face was covered in the video, but investigators said that he had been driving the same black 2021 Jeep Cherokee that had appeared on security camera footage from three nights earlier when he canvassed the synagogue.

Now the building faces a lengthy cleanup.\", \"\\u201cThe sanctuary is not going to be available to us for some time,\\u201d Rabbi Folberg said.\", \"No one was injured in the fire, which the rabbi said might have been worse. He credited a driver with spotting the flames and calling 911, which he said saved the synagogue.\", \"Rabbi Folberg, who has been at Congregation Beth Israel for 30 years, said that he initially wondered if the fire had been a prank because it happened on Halloween. As the details started to emerge from the security camera footage and the F.B.I. report, the rabbi said it became disturbing.\", \"\\u201cYou start asking all kinds of questions about what\\u2019s going on in the life of somebody that would do something like this,\\u201d he said.\", \"Texas State University said in a statement that it was helping the investigation.\", \"\\u201cOur university decries this hateful act of bigotry and violence and all the antisemitic events perpetrated recently in Austin, San Antonio and San Marcos,\\u201d it said. \\u201cThe Texas State University community stands in solidarity with our Jewish students, faculty, staff, alumni and community members who have been impacted.\\u201d\", \"Since the arson, the rabbi said, people from various faiths have rallied around the congregation, contributing more than $100,000 toward the cleanup.\", \"At a rally outside the State Capitol in Austin on Sunday to promote kindness and denounce acts of antisemitism, the rabbi said that an imam from the North Austin Muslim Community Center expressed his solidarity \\u2014 in more than just words.\", \"\\u201cHe took an envelope out of his robe and handed me a check that was raised by the mosque,\\u201d Rabbi Folberg said.\", \"The imam, Islam Mossaad, said on Monday that the check was for $5,000 but that what it stood for was more significant.
