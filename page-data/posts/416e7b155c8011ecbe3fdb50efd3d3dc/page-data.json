They turned around and he was gone,\\u201d said Pete Jackson, chief deputy at the Graves County Jail. Long after the storm had passed, he said, Mr. Daniel\\u2019s body was found under the shattered building. The workers he had ushered to safety survived.\", \"\\u201cHe put his life in danger to help others. There is no other way to put it,\\u201d Mr. Jackson said on Monday, as the authorities across six states began to identify dozens of people killed over the weekend in the powerful tornadoes that leveled the candle factory and destroyed neighborhoods as far away as Arkansas and Illinois.\", \"At least 74 people were confirmed dead in Kentucky alone, the youngest 5 months old, the oldest 86 years. So severe were the injuries and so remote some of the areas damaged that officials in Kentucky have not been able to identify 18 of those who died. Among the dead were a district judge in Bremen, Ky., a dispatcher at an Amazon warehouse in Illinois and at least 15 people who were killed on a single street in the town of Bowling Green, Ky.\", \"So wide was the swath of destruction wrought by four separate tornadoes in Kentucky \\u2014 one of them a monster that cut a 223-mile path through the state \\u2014 that deaths were tallied in eight counties. With more than 8,000 power poles down, about 25,000 customers were still without power on Monday evening.\", \"\\u201cThousands of homes are damaged if not entirely destroyed. It may be weeks before we have final counts on both deaths and levels of destruction,\\u201d Gov. Andy Beshear told reporters on Monday. \\u201cYou stand in the middle of Mayfield or Dawson, where two-thirds of the town are gone, or in that town in Muhlenberg County, and it\\u2019s almost crushing how it feels.\\u201d\", \"For the moment, family members were phoning loved ones and gathering in living rooms across the American heartland, mourning those who had not survived the storms\\u2019 swift, furious rampage.\", \"One of them was Bobby Spradling Jr., a 50-year-old carpenter from Mayfield who had been urged by his children to leave his home during the tornado warnings but had elected to stay there \\u2014 until it was too late.\", \"\\u201cHe tried to wait it out because we don\\u2019t get these things here,\\u201d said his niece Melissa Rayo, who said there were signs her uncle had tried to leave the house at the last minute.\", \"\\u201cHe was so adventurous and caring and really loved Halo game nights on Xbox,\\u201d Ms. Rayo said. When her mother died during her senior year of high school, she said, Mr. Spradling took her into his own home when she needed a break from her grandmother\\u2019s house and bought her school supplies when she could not afford them.\", \"When she graduated, he invited her on a vacation with his family to the Garden of the Gods national landmark in Colorado. \\u201cMost of all, I\\u2019ll remember how kind he was and how he helped me through the hardest time,\\u201d she said.\", \"Stories of heroism and happenstance were unfolding across the region.\", \"Eleven of the 15 people who died in Warren County, Ky., lived on a single street, Moss Creek Avenue, in Bowling Green, the county coroner said Monday. The youngest was 4 years old.\", \"At the Amazon warehouse in Edwardsville, Ill., Kevin Dickey, a dispatcher, found himself in the path of the tornado as he was trying to get drivers to safety, according to his daughter, Kristen Anastasi. He did not survive.\", \"\\u201cHe deserved a little bit longer,\\u201d Ms. Anastasi said.\", \"Mr. Dickey grew up in Wayne City and lived in Carlyle, both east of St. Louis. His daughter said she would always remember how he would make the \\u201cI love you\\u201d sign in American Sign Language \\u2014 pinkie and index finger raised, middle and ring fingers folded down, his thumb out \\u2014 each time they parted ways, even though no one in the family was deaf.\", \"\\u201cAt 42, that still happened,\\u201d she said.\", \"Brian Crick, a district judge for Muhlenberg and McLean Counties, died on Saturday in Bremen, Ky., at age 43. Judge Crick\\u2019s wife, Amanda, and two of their children were treated for injuries. His youngest child was not home when the storms hit.\", \"The judge, an elder and Sunday school teacher at Cumberland Presbyterian Church in Sacramento, Ky., was known for his love of children, said Dana Brantley, a close friend of the Crick family.\", \"\\u201cHe always had a kid turned upside down, tossing them in the air,\\u201d Ms. Brantley said. \\u201cIf something like this happened to someone else, he would have been leading the cleanup, he would have his work gloves on, be digging through the rubble, out with his saw helping. That\\u2019s just who he was.\\u201d\", \"For the family of Mr. Daniel, the Mayfield corrections officer, Monday was a day for gathering at the Brown Funeral Home \\u2014 one of the few structures in town unscathed by the widespread destruction \\u2014 to make preparations for a final goodbye.\", \"\\u201cHe died helping people until the very end,\\u201d said a younger brother, Alonzo Daniel, 43. \\u201cThat\\u2019s who he was.\\u201d\", \"An officer for the Graves County Jail for eight years, Mr. Daniel had started a new job supervising inmates assigned to work at the candle factory last week \\u2014 just days before the tornado struck.\", \"Inmates and others who worked at the factory told county officials that after the sirens blasted, signaling that a tornado was on its way, Mr. Daniel quickly set to work getting people to the designated shelter area.\", \"\\u201cHe led many people to safety,\\u201d the younger Mr. Daniel said. \\u201cWhen they turned around, they did not see him anymore.\\u201d\", \"Hearing that the tornado had struck, Alonzo Daniel and one of his brother\\u2019s seven children, Zach Daniel, rushed to the factory hoping for any signs of life. They found the building a shambles. Cars were piled on top of one another, others were on the remains of the building, and heavy equipment from a nearby John Deere store was scattered about.\", \"\\u201cIt was chaos,\\u201d Zach said. \\u201cI kept yelling: \\u2018Pops! Pops!\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Alonzo Daniel said he also called out his brother\\u2019s name, hoping to hear his voice from the ruins. \\u201cBut nothing,\\u201d he said.\", \"Hours later, he was asked to identify the remains of a man whose body had been found at the site. His throat tightened when he recognized his brother, who was six feet tall and about 280 pounds, inside a body bag.\", \"\\u201cMy brother was a big man; I knew it was him before they unzipped the bag,\\u201d he said\", \"He mustered the courage to call all seven of his brother\\u2019s children and other relatives to share the news. \\u201cI had to tell them, \\u2018Your daddy is no longer here.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"One of Mr. Daniel\\u2019s other sons, Tyce Daniel, 22, who plays tight end for Southern Illinois University Carbondale, said his father almost never missed his football games. \\u201cWe talked after every home game. He would tell me, \\u2018Keep doing you. You can go as high as you want,\\u2019\\u201d he said. \\u201cHe wanted to see me in the N.F.L. I have to try and get there for him.\\u201d\", \"Hours before he headed to work at the factory, Mr. Daniel stopped by the barbershop where Zach worked to deliver an early Christmas present. It was a messenger bag, Zach said. Then he waved goodbye and told his son that he would see him soon.\", \"\\u201cYou never imagine that\\u2019s the last time you are going to see him,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou just don\\u2019t think like that.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"416e7b155c8011ecbe3fdb50efd3d3dc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"416e7b155c8011ecbe3fdb50efd3d3dc"}},
