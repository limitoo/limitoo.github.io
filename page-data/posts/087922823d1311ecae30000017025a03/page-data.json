Last year's 2020 edition featured seven scenarios: \\\"Formal declaration of Taiwan independence; Undefined moves toward Taiwan independence; Internal unrest in Taiwan; Taiwan's acquisition of nuclear weapons; Indefinite delays in the resumption of cross-Strait dialogue on unification; Foreign intervention in Taiwan's internal affairs; and, Foreign forces stationed on Taiwan.\\\"\", \"This year, however, the final scenario was omitted, leaving six other \\\"circumstances under which the PRC has historically indicated it would consider the use of force.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1925918/us-green-berets-japan-military-guam.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">U.S. Army Green Berets with 1st Battalion, 1st Special Forces Group (Airborne), descend on a drop zone alongside members of the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force after flying from Yokota Air Base, Japan as part of Exercise Forager 21 on July 30.

The two lines regarding nuclear weapons and internal unrest premiered in 2002 and the formal declaration of independence and foreign intervention have been seen since the debut report.\", \"China has vowed to reclaim Taiwan, with officials saying they prefer diplomacy but never renouncing the use of force.\", \"The island's sovereignty has been a matter of debate since a civil war ended in 1949 with a Communist victory on the mainland that forced nationalists into exile on Taiwan, where a rival government was formed. International recognition was initially divided, but over the decades diplomatic ties increasingly favored the People's Republic and the U.S. ultimately shifted its relations in 1979.\", \"Since then, however, the U.S. has maintained an unofficial relationship with Taiwan, including both political contacts and military assistance. These ties saw an uptick under former President Donald Trump and have continued to tighten under President Joe Biden, though his administration has vowed to uphold the commitments encoded in the formative understandings reached by Washington and Beijing more than four decades ago.\", \"After Tsai appeared to publicly acknowledge the presence of U.S. troops in Taiwan during an interview with CNN last month, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian urged the U.S. to adhere to these prior commitments.\", \"\\\"The one-China principle is the political foundation of China-U.S. relations,\\\" Zhao told reporters at the time. \\\"On the Taiwan question, the U.S. should abide by the one-China principle and the stipulations of the three China-U.S. joint communiqu\\u00e9s, rather than something unilaterally concocted by itself.\\\"\", \"He voiced China's opposition to \\\"official and military ties in any form between the US and the Taiwan region\\\" as well as any \\\"U.S. interference in China's internal affairs.\\\" He also accused U.S. warships that occasionally pass through the Taiwan Strait of having \\\"flexed\\\" their \\\"muscles to make provocations and stir up troubles sending gravely wrong signals to the 'Taiwan independence' forces and threatening cross-Strait peace and stability.\\\"\", \"\\\"The cross-Strait reunification is an overriding historical trend and the right course, while 'Taiwan independence' is a retrogression leading to a dead end,\\\" Zhao said.\", \"He also lashed out against Tsai's Democratic Progress Party, accusing it of making moves toward independence. Such actions he, argued \\\"can not change the iron-clad fact that Taiwan is a part of China, neither will it shake the international community's universal and firm commitment to the one-China principle.\\\"\", \"\\\"Those who forget their heritage, betray their motherland, and seek to split the country will come to no good end,\\\" Zhao said. \\\"Seeking 'Taiwan independence' leads to a dead end. So does supporting 'Taiwan independence.' No country and no one should underestimate the resolve, the will, and the ability of the Chinese people to defend their national sovereignty and territorial integrity.
