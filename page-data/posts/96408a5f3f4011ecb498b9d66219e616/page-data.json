Hobart, which has\\u00a0largely avoided the harsh lockdowns experienced by other Australian capital cities.\", \"But as national cases started picking up in late April\\u00a0this year, her parents in China interpreted it as a sign of Australia losing control of the pandemic and demanded that she return\\u00a0home.\", \"Ms Guo's parents insisted that China's \\\"COVID zero\\\" policy was the best way to keep her and everyone else in the country safe.\", \"So the former temporary resident, who works as an interpreter, packed up her life in Australia and moved back to China permanently after being separated from her family for two years.\", \"Even when Ms Guo had to quarantine for four weeks after landing in China, her family's support for the country's\\u00a0strict COVID-19 strategy did not waver.\\u00a0\", \"And while there have been some protests and criticism from stranded domestic travellers and in cities facing extended lockdowns to contain the Delta variant, many\\u00a0in

out of control, and then testing millions of residents within days.\", \"Everyone also has to travel with COVID QR codes, which are coloured green, yellow or red, to show\\u00a0someone's\\u00a0health status.\", \"A resident identified as a close contact of a confirmed case would receive a red status, those needing to quarantine would receive a yellow status, and healthy or recovered patients would get a green status.\", \"Not long after Ms Guo returned to her hometown in south-west Sichuan province after a job interview on the other side of the country, her QR code turned yellow because she had been at a location close to an exposure site.\", \"The local health officer was alerted, and within an hour she was sent to a nearby hospital to start her quarantine.\", \"But after testing negative twice in two days, she was released.\", \"She said this swift testing and quarantine process was partially why China's policy wasn't too hard to follow.\", \"Ms Guo felt the lockdowns in China were mostly brief and targeted, and people could live normally as long as they did not travel.\", \"\\\"And there is no such thing like in Australia that one venue allows only a certain number of
