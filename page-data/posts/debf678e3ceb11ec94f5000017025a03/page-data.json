Giuffre.","country":"au","create_time":"2021-11-03T13:20:44.000Z","content":"[\"Prince Andrew has \\\"unequivocally\\\" denied allegations he sexually abused a woman while she was under the age of 18 \\u2013 in turn accusing her of profiting from \\\"frivolous\\\" lawsuits and \\\"salacious\\\" media coverage.\", \"A judge in New York has now indicated the case could go to trial late next year.\", \"Here's what we know so far.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">The Hollywood tactics being used by Andrew's lawyers</div>\", \"In early August, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who now lives in Australia, brought a lawsuit against the Duke of York claiming he sexually abused her on multiple occasions, facilitated by late disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, dating back to 2001 when Ms Giuffre was 17.\", \"Prince Andrew has consistently denied the claims and recently hired high-profile Hollywood attorney Andrew Brettler, who has a history of defending celebrities accused of sexual misconduct, including Bohemian Rhapsody director Bryan Singer and actor Armie Hammer.\", \"After initially trying to sidestep the US civil suit on procedural grounds, Mr Brettler then pivoted onto the offensive, opting for mud-slinging tactics to discredit his famous client's accuser.\", \"\\\"Most people could only dream of obtaining the sums of money that Giuffre has secured for herself over the years,\\\" Mr Brettler wrote in court documents.\", \"\\\"This presents a compelling motive for Giuffre to continue filing frivolous lawsuits against individuals such as Prince Andrew, whose sullied reputation is only the latest collateral damage of the Epstein scandal.\\\"\", \"Mr Brettler then wrote Ms Giuffre had initiated the \\\"baseless\\\" lawsuit to \\\"achieve another payday at his expense and at the expense of those closest to him\\\".\", \"The Prince's team also filed several tabloid articles attacking her character, including a New York Daily News story that referred to her as a \\\"money-hungry sex kitten\\\".\", \"In 2009, Ms Giuffre reached a confidential settlement with Epstein, a convicted sex offender, which Mr Brettler argued in September also effectively absolved Prince Andrew \\\"from any and all liability\\\".\", \"The same agreement was cited by criminal defence lawyer Alan Dershowitz, who Ms Giuffre has also accused of abuse, to have a battery claim against him struck out in August.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">The latest from the court case</div>\", \"<img

Brendan Mounter)</div>\", \"In a hearing lasting less than 10 minutes on Wednesday, lawyers for the Duke of York and Ms Giuffre revealed they each expected to depose around eight to 12 people as part of the case.\", \"Mr Brettler referenced a new lawsuit against Ms Giuffre lodged by artist Rina Oh Amen, who alleges that Ms Giuffre defamed her on Twitter in 2020 by saying she had recruited girls for Epstein to abuse.\", \"Mr Brettler suggested that case would touch on \\\"similar issues\\\" and that witnesses could overlap across them both.\", \"US District Judge Lewis Kaplan said he was unable to set an exact trial date\\u00a0because of complications in accommodating juries safely during the pandemic.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What happens next?</div>\", \"Ms Giuffre's lawyer, David Boies, told the hearing his team would be ready to start depositions \\\"relatively promptly\\\", although some witnesses may not be identified for another two months.\", \"Ahead of any trial, both the Prince and Ms Giuffre would need to be questioned under oath by opposing lawyers by mid-July next year.\", \"In the meantime, another high-profile court case is about to get underway in New York, with Ms Maxwell, Epstein's long-time associate and ex-girlfriend, due to stand trial on November 29.\", \"She is accused of helping to recruit and groom three underage girls for Epstein to abuse and of engaging in sex trafficking of a 14-year-old girl.\", \"Ms Maxwell, who has been in jail in Brooklyn since her arrest in 2020, has pleaded not guilty to eight criminal counts.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What we know about Virginia Roberts Giuffre</div>\", \"Ms Giuffre, now 38, is an American-Australian who alleges she was trafficked to the UK when she was 17 and sexually abused by Prince Andrew at Ms Maxwell's London home in 2001.\", \"Despite Prince Andrew initially claiming to have no recollection of meeting Ms Giuffre, a photo shows him with his arm around her in a setting likened to Ms Maxwell's home by Ms Maxwell's\\u00a0own brother.\", \"In a lawsuit filed in August, she also accused the prince of abusing her in Epstein's New York mansion and on his private island in the US Virgin Islands.\", \"\\\"Twenty years ago, Prince Andrew's wealth, power, position\\u00a0and connections enabled him to abuse a frightened, vulnerable child with no-one there to protect her,\\\" the case documents read.\"]","href_hash":"debf678e3ceb11ec94f5000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"debf678e3ceb11ec94f5000017025a03"}},
