His new Lucid Air sedan is a direct challenge to Tesla’s dominance.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-18T02:17:33.000Z","content":"[\"It celebrated the production of its first cars less than two months ago. Deliveries have just begun. But for a company with so few vehicles on the road, Lucid Motors is generating a lot of buzz.\", \"Its debut sedan, the $169,000 Lucid Air Dream Edition, has been hailed for its workmanship and the ability to travel a record 520 miles on a single charge. MotorTrend magazine declared it the car of the year. And Lucid\\u2019s shares have more than doubled in the last month, putting the company\\u2019s worth at $85 billion \\u2014 a valuation higher than Ford Motor\\u2019s.\", \"The accolades are a tribute to Lucid\\u2019s chief executive, Peter Rawlinson, an auto industry veteran who engineered the Model S, the sedan that established Tesla as a serious carmaker. Now, he hopes that the Air will do the same for Lucid.\", \"\\u201cThe first product defines the brand,\\u201d he said recently in an interview at Lucid\\u2019s factory in the Arizona desert. \\u201cWe\\u2019ll need to create a technological tour de force, and I think that\\u2019s what we\\u2019ve got in Lucid Air. We define our brand, we define our future.\\u201d\", \"Along with Rivian Automotive, the neophyte manufacturer of electric trucks that is worth roughly $130 billion a week after listing its shares, Lucid illustrates investors\\u2019 enthusiasm for everything having to do with electric vehicles.\", \"But the list of things that could go wrong is long \\u2014 44 pages long, in the mandatory disclosure of potential risks in Lucid\\u2019s stock offering prospectus. The document notes that the company lacks experience mass producing cars, that it has no service network and that it is highly dependent on Mr. Rawlinson, a 64-year-old Welshman who is, after all, mortal.\", \"And there are also plenty of investors who see a tech bubble in the making and are betting it will burst. Short sellers, who use borrowed stocks to make money if a company\\u2019s share price goes down, have wagered $2.35 billion that Lucid won\\u2019t be able to maintain its lofty valuation, according to data from S3 Partners, a New York firm that tracks short sales.\", \"Lucid shares languished for several months after the company made its stock market debut in July through a merger with a so-called blank-check corporation known as Churchill Capital Corp IV. They began climbing in October, after Road & Track declared that the Air was \\u201cso good it should make Tesla sweat.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Rawlinson\\u2019s credibility with investors stems largely from his r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9. He worked at Jaguar and was chief engineer of Lotus, the British sports car maker. His name is on dozens of patents for battery technology or other innovations. Mr. Rawlinson oversaw Lucid\\u2019s development of the battery used by all the teams in the Formula E electric-vehicle racing circuit.\", \"But mass producing automobiles is a challenge of a different magnitude. Initial versions of the Air cost almost $35,000 more than a top-of-the-line Tesla Model S Plaid. To be profitable, Lucid must appeal to more than just a superwealthy elite.\", \"\\u201cLucid\\u2019s biggest risks are getting to scale and capacity,\\u201d said Daniel Ives, a senior analyst at Wedbush Securities who follows the electric car industry. \\u201cThe first phase has been significantly successful. Now it\\u2019s about the next level of adoption.\\u201d\", \"Lucid plans to offer a version of the Air next year that will cost $70,000 after a federal tax credit, and produce 500,000 cars a year by 2030, with a lineup that will include a sport utility vehicle and a pickup. The company had burned through $4.2 billion by June, and its prospectus noted that it might be years away from making money.\", \"To avoid the problems that plagued Tesla in its early days, when for a while it was assembling cars in tents, Mr. Rawlinson is relying on people like Eric Bach, Lucid\\u2019s chief engineer. Mr. Bach, another Tesla refugee, has worked at Volkswagen and takes a very German approach to manufacturing. He can expound at length on the art of achieving narrow body gaps, the spaces between sheet metal that to engineers are a measure of quality.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re not intending to put any tents up,\\u201d Mr. Bach said, except perhaps \\u201cto have a party.\\u201d\", \"At the same time, the market is increasingly crowded. Automakers like Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen have invested heavily in electric vehicles.\", \"Mr. Rawlinson has confounded naysayers before. He points out that some people doubted that the Model S would be a success, or said Lucid could not build a car with a range of 500 miles and get it out the factory door this year. \\u201cThere is a track record here of me making claims which seem unrealistic but are absolutely based on science,\\u201d he said.\", \"Success would have an extra bit of sweetness for Mr. Rawlinson, who left Tesla amid rancor with Elon Musk, the company\\u2019s mercurial chief executive.\", \"The main reason he quit Tesla in 2012, Mr. Rawlinson said, was to care for his ailing mother in Wales. But he added that he had also felt mistreated by Mr. Musk. \\u201cI had a mom who needed me, and I had a boss who wasn\\u2019t treating me very well,\\u201d he said, declining to elaborate on the nature of the mistreatment.\", \"Mr. Rawlinson, who comes across as good humored but intense and detail oriented, is self-effacing in a way that Mr. Musk is not. He says, for example, that he wants to hire people who are smarter than he is.\", \"\\u201cIf I\\u2019ve done my job right, I\\u2019ll be the dumbest guy left in the room and I can walk out and throw away the key and leave them to it,\\u201d Mr. Rawlinson said with a laugh.\", \"After it began in 2007 as a battery maker named Atieva, the company had several near-death experiences. Atieva shifted focus toward building electric vehicles in 2014 and changed its name to Lucid two years later. It struggled to raise enough money for the capital-intensive business of building cars, but was saved in 2018 by a $1 billion investment from the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, which remains a majority shareholder.\", \"\\u201cEveryone says, \\u2018Oh, the tough thing about a start-up is getting an assembly line going,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Rawlinson said. \\u201cLet me tell you what\\u2019s tough: getting finance for the start-up not to go bankrupt.\\u201d\", \"Stock bonuses tied to Lucid\\u2019s share price are likely to make Mr. Rawlinson a billionaire if he isn\\u2019t already. But Alejandro Agag, the founder and chairman of Formula E, said he did not think that Mr. Rawlinson was motivated by money.\", \"\\u201cOf course, it\\u2019s nice to have money,\\u201d Mr. Agag said. \\u201cWhat drives him is to make the best car.\\u201d\", \"Lucid started delivering the first of 520 Air Dream Edition cars to customers late last month, with plans to ramp up production and deliveries of three other Air models soon. The performance version of the sold-out Dream Edition boasts 1,111 horsepower, while another version focused on distance driving can travel 520 miles between charges, more than any other car tested by the Environmental Protection Agency. Lucid received that rating in September, when its vehicles seized the top six spots in the E.P.A.\\u2019s battery-range ranking, unseating the previous record-holder: the Model S Long Range, which can go 405 miles between charges.\", \"The endurance is the product of Mr. Rawlinson\\u2019s obsession with reducing the weight of the components that move the car forward, including an electric motor that he likes to show off by rolling it to presentations in a carry-on suitcase.\", \"Tyler Schilling, the retired founder of a robotics company, reserved a Lucid after attending a launch event in December 2016 and was one of the first to receive his car last month.\", \"He immediately put the vehicle to the test on California\\u2019s winding coastal roads.\", \"\\u201cI was shocked,\\u201d Mr. Schilling, who owns 14 cars and a pickup truck, said of the Lucid Air. \\u201cThat car handles a good 1,500 pounds lighter than it actually is. It\\u2019s super impressive.\\u201d\", \"The company said this month that it had more than 17,000 reservations and was aiming to make 20,000 vehicles next year.\", \"Mr. Rawlinson justifies the high cost by saying that early, superluxury versions will establish that Lucid can deliver meticulous workmanship. Road & Track thinks Lucid has succeeded.\", \"\\u201cLucid\\u2019s posh quarters make a Tesla\\u2019s interior look like the mismatched Tupperware in the back of your cupboard,\\u201d the magazine wrote last month after a test drive. Ouch.\", \"Mr. Rawlinson\\u2019s compact motors freed up interior space for passengers, and the car includes frills like an optional solid glass roof and seats that give passengers a massage. The most powerful version can outrun a Ferrari.\", \"In Mr. Rawlinson\\u2019s telling, the luxury cars are just a steppingstone to his ultimate goal: making battery-powered mobility accessible to everyone. Lucid is open to selling its technology to companies that can produce millions of vehicles at low cost.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m not here to sell ultraluxury cars,\\u201d Mr. Rawlinson said. \\u201cI want to mass-industrialize electric cars.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"93c1125b485811ec885e27dac71e361a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"93c1125b485811ec885e27dac71e361a"}},
