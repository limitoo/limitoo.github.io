The ruling leaves Mr. Bezos\\u2019 company with few other legal avenues to challenge the contract, making it more likely that whenever American astronauts return to the lunar surface, they will be traveling in a spacecraft built by Mr. Musk's company.\", \"But NASA has been unable to work on the program with SpaceX for the duration of Blue Origin\\u2019s legal challenges, which may delay the return to the moon.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s been disappointing to not be able to make progress,\\u201d said Pam Melroy, NASA\\u2019s deputy administrator, in an interview on Wednesday before the ruling was announced. She added that meeting with the company to assess the timeline for the moon mission was a \\u201cvery high priority\\u201d for NASA.\", \"Mr. Bezos\\u2019 space company, Blue Origin, sued NASA in August, contending that the agency unfairly awarded to SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract in April to conduct the first two missions to the moon. The launches are to be part of Artemis, NASA\\u2019s flagship effort to build an American presence on the lunar surface.\", \"Judge Richard A. Hertling of the U.S. Court of Federal Claims denied Blue Origin\\u2019s arguments and sided with NASA on Thursday. But his full order was sealed, leaving his reasoning for the ruling so far unknown.\", \"A spokesman for Blue Origin said the company\\u2019s lawsuit highlighted what it considered \\u201cimportant safety issues\\u201d in NASA\\u2019s effort to award funds for a lunar lander \\u201cthat must still be addressed,\\u201d but added: \\u201cWe look forward to hearing from NASA on next steps\\u201d for future moon lander competitions under the Artemis program.\", \"NASA did not immediately comment on the ruling.\", \"While SpaceX did not comment, Mr. Musk, reacting to the ruling, posted an image on Twitter referencing \\u201cJudge Dredd,\\u201d a dystopian science fiction comic book and film, that said: \\u201cYou have been judged.\\u201d\", \"The contract feud was one of many industry conflicts that reflected the clashing ambitions of two billionaire entrepreneurs who are pouring billions of dollars into rival efforts to normalize space transportation.\", \"Mr. Musk, the chief executive and founder of SpaceX and Tesla, which makes electric cars, started the space company in 2002 with dreams of making humanity a \\u201cmultiplanetary\\u201d species. And Mr. Bezos, the founder and former chief executive of Amazon, started Blue Origin in 2000 with the goal of having \\u201cmillions of people living and working in space.\\u201d\", \"Those lofty pursuits underpinned six months of legal jostling, rigorous lobbying and public complaining waged by Blue Origin after it lost to SpaceX in NASA\\u2019s moon lander program. That coveted contract to put humans on the moon would have provided a crucial boost to the credibility of Blue Origin, which has flown humans to the edge of space but never into Earth\\u2019s orbit or beyond.\", \"Blue Origin had partnered with Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman and Draper to develop and offer its Blue Moon lunar lander for $5.9 billion, assembling a team of aerospace heavyweights that it thought would be too good for NASA to turn down and betting that the space agency would be willing to negotiate a lower price if necessary.\", \"NASA initially wanted to pick two different lunar lander systems, in case one fell behind during development, but was limited by funding from Congress, which last year allocated only a quarter of what the White House requested for the program. NASA ended up giving a contract to SpaceX alone, as the company\\u2019s bid was half the price of Blue Origin\\u2019s Blue Moon proposal.\", \"The NASA funds, now unlocked by the agency\\u2019s court victory, will help fuel the whirlwind development of Starship, a fully reusable system that is the centerpiece of Mr. Musk\\u2019s ambitions to eventually send people to Mars. The company has been developing and test launching the rocket at its rapidly expanding facilities in South Texas. After several tests of the vehicle that ended in explosions, the company completed a high-altitude flight that landed successfully in May. In the near future, the company plans an orbital test of the spacecraft with no passengers aboard.\", \"The NASA contract calls for two Starship trips to the moon and back, with the second mission carrying American astronauts. NASA\\u2019s stated deadline for the lunar landing, first announced by the Trump administration, is 2024.\", \"But that was widely viewed as unrealistic even before Blue Origin\\u2019s legal challenges, which forced NASA to pause work with SpaceX while the litigation played out for six months.\", \"In an initial Blue Origin protest with the Government Accountability Office filed in April, the company argued that NASA should have canceled or changed the rules of the program when it realized it couldn\\u2019t afford two lander systems (another company, Dynetics, filed a similar complaint). The office rejected that argument, and dozens more, ruling NASA had fairly evaluated all the proposals.\"]","href_hash":"7246c3663d8811ec84b8000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7246c3663d8811ec84b8000017025a03"}},
