I can't wait for your arteries to clog. They're not doing it fast enough. And Nathan [Fletcher], you should kill yourself, a dishonorable discharge would be you blowing your brains out. [Terra] Lawson-Remer, I like to call you a little monkey. I'd like to see you hang from a tree. And [Dr. Wilma] Wooten, you're a f**king Aunt Jemima,\\\" Robo said during a Tuesday meeting held by the San Diego County Board of Supervisors concerning the COVID vaccine mandate.\", \"The vice chairwoman and board supervisor at San Diego County, Nora Vargas, immediately interrupted Robo after he insulted Wooten and demanded that his microphone would be turned off.\", \"The comedian is prone to losing his radio show in Humboldt County because of his racially-charged remarks, according to the Times of San Diego. Robo's two-hour show used to air on Saturdays on the KMUD radio station.\", \"After knowing of Robo's comments, KMUD's news director Lauren Schmitt said in a statement that \\\"immediate action is being taken.\\\"\", \"Though it is not yet confirmed whether Robo's show will be canceled, Schmitt said that the station denounced the \\\"several deplorable statements\\\" that Robo, a volunteer at KMUD, made during the meeting and that it is discussing the fate of his future shows.\", \"\\\"The volunteer programmer in question has little to no direct relationship to the station, as their pre-recorded show is submitted,\\\" said the statement, according to the Times of San Diego. \\\"We would like to be clear that their opinions do not reflect our values. While these statements were made on an outside platform, we have begun the discussion into their future as a volunteer.\\\"\", \"\\\"While we understand the importance of free speech, we recognize the difference between that and hate speech. KMUD is dedicated to diversity, acceptance and understanding,\\\" KMUD's news director said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926672/comedian-might-lose-show-over-racial-slurs.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Comedian Jason Robo might lose his radio show after his racially-charged comments against a Black public health officer in San Diego.

It is unfortunate that some commenters at our Board of Supervisors meetings have taken an escalating low road in attacking county staff and members of the board,\\\" he said.\"]","href_hash":"409d20d43dc011ecbb30000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"409d20d43dc011ecbb30000017025a03"}},
