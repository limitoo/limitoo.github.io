The plan is to build the reactor on Earth, then send it to the moon.\", \"Fission surface power systems could provide sustained power no matter the moon's environmental conditions, according to AP. If the power plant is successful on the moon, NASA's next goal would be to put one on Mars.\", \"\\\"I expect fission surface power systems to greatly benefit our plans for power architectures for the moon and Mars and even drive innovation for uses here on Earth,\\\" Jim Reuter, associate administrator for NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate, said in a statement.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936875/moon-eclipse-nasa.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">NASA wants to put a nuclear fission power plant on the moon by the end of the decade.

It should not weigh more than 13,200 pounds (6,000 kilograms).\", \"The Idaho National Laboratory has worked with NASA on various projects in the past. Most recently, the lab helped power NASA's Mars rover Perseverance with a radioisotope power system, which converts heat generated by the natural decay of plutonium-238 into electrical power.\", \"The car-sized rover landed on Mars in February and has remained active on the red planet.\", \"The Energy Department has also been working to team up with private businesses on various nuclear power plans, notably on a new generation of smaller power plants that range from small modular reactors to small mobile reactors that can quickly be set up in the field and then removed when not needed.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936878/idaho-national-laboratory.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">NASA is working with U.S. Department of Energy's Idaho National Laboratory on a request for proposals for a fission surface power system.
