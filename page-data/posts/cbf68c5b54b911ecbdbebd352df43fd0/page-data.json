I mean, everything. There's a lot more to that story. I just hope they don't stop looking.\\\"\", \"Arians said his team has done just as good of a job as any other team in the league of managing any COVID cases they have encountered, and said other teams in the league could have the same problem on their rosters and it just hasn't become public yet.\", \"The suspensions came as a result of a league investigation opened after Brown's former personal chef Steven Ruiz, who Brown allegedly owed $10,000 to, told The Tampa Bay Times Brown's girlfriend offered to pay him if he could get a fake vaccination card for Brown in July.\", \"Ruiz reportedly couldn't get a fake card for Brown, but he said Brown showed him the fake cards he bought from someone else weeks later.\", \"Brown has missed the past five games with an ankle injury and was likely to be out the next two games before the suspension was announced.

They'll just be working out, and we'll address their future at that time. Other than that, there's really nothing to say.\\\"\", \"\\\"This is a setback because of what happened, but we have done an amazing job. We haven't had an outbreak in a position room, so I'm very happy with that part,\\\" Arians said.\", \"Asked if he thinks there may be issues with the vaccination status of other players around the league, the coach replied, \\\"maybe.\\\"\", \"Brown will lose a little over $181,000 during the suspension. The Bucs are 5-0 with him in the lineup this season, 3-3 without.
