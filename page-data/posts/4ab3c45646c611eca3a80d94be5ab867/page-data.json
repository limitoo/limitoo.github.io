When directing a film, she works sometimes for years to ready the environment \\u2014 and herself. Before she began shooting her new feature, \\u201cThe Power of the Dog,\\u201d she returned again and again to the mountain range in New Zealand she had chosen as a location, checking what the light was like at different times of day, in different weather, across seasons. She went to visit the ranches in Montana where Thomas Savage, who wrote the novel on which the film is based, grew up. She sent Benedict Cumberbatch \\u2014 who stars as Phil, a vicious, hypermasculine rancher \\u2014 to Montana as well, to learn roping, riding, horseshoeing, whittling, banjo and bull-calf castration.\", \"But in rehearsals, her approach tends to be more oblique. For \\u201cThe Power of the Dog,\\u201d she gathered the actors for a few weeks to hike, improvise and do exercises. They ate together, cooked together or just sat in rooms, in character, not talking. She asked Cumberbatch to write a letter as Phil to Phil\\u2019s dead lover, Bronco Henry. Then she had him write back as Bronco Henry. She asked Cumberbatch and Jesse Plemons, who play brothers, to waltz together, to help them learn intimately how the other\\u2019s body smelled, felt and moved, visceral qualities that boys who\\u2019ve grown up together would know.\", \"Campion also tried something new: She went to see a Jungian dream analyst out of Los Angeles, hoping to more deeply connect with Phil\\u2019s psychology, and she suggested Cumberbatch do the same. Campion normally doesn\\u2019t dream much, but soon she began having the same nightmare over and over. She was riding a black horse, beautiful and skittish, down a steep, narrow pathway along the face of a cliff. As they went farther down the trail, she realized that the path was vanishing into nothing, that the horse\\u2019s hooves would inevitably hit an angle too sheer to support their weight. We\\u2019ve got to back up, she thought. But the horse, too frightened and not yet trusting her, wouldn\\u2019t listen. It pressed forward, toward the vanishing point.\", \"Oh, this is certain death, she thought, and she woke up.\", \"\\u201cOf course Jane Campion\\u2019s dreams are so rich in imagery,\\u201d Cumberbatch joked on the phone. \\u201cSexual, fantastical, spiritual, just exploding orchids of blood. Whereas I\\u2019m dreaming that I can\\u2019t quite climb the tree.\\u201d\", \"Campion was more self-effacing. \\u201cYour dreams are inscrutable to yourself for a good reason,\\u201d she told me when we met in New York. \\u201cThey\\u2019re keeping secrets from the mind, you know?\\u201d We were walking west in Central Park on one of those glowing days in late September that look like the set of some movie \\u2014 not a Campion movie, maybe a Nora Ephron.\", \"Campion tends to seek eye contact, and she is quick to ask fourth-date questions. (During our walk, she asked whether I liked being married, really wanting to know. She is divorced and a bit skeptical of the institution.) She laughs raucously and frequently, and she inserts impish comments into every conversation in her clipped New Zealand accent. She has the drape of fine, silver hair you might associate with a mystic, but everything else about her \\u2014 the square, chunky black glasses and understated, monochromatic outfits \\u2014 indicates, aesthetically speaking, what she is: the most decorated female filmmaker alive, an auteur in the lineage of Luis Bu\\u00f1uel, Fran\\u00e7ois Truffaut and Pedro Almod\\u00f3var.\", \"Campion\\u2019s work is both ethereal and brutal. This is a woman who conceived of a television show that deals with incest and pedophilia but set it in the most transcendently beautiful place in the world. For another movie, she wrote a scene in which poor, sweet Meg Ryan cradles her sister\\u2019s decapitated head.\", \"Despite the grim realities faced by her characters, her films often resemble allegories or myths \\u2014 or, actually, dreams. They are so densely layered with visual metaphor, so flush with archetypes and symbols, that they operate like their own semiotic systems. A cat is never just a cat. There is often someone missing or just out of sight. The action sometimes seems to proceed according to dream logic, both bewildering and inevitable. The films are radiant and even psychedelic in their detail, so intense in their gaze \\u2014 at the back of a neck, the twitch of a curtain, the color of water \\u2014 that they seem transmitted directly from the subconscious or directly into the subconscious. They come back to you at odd times, like a puzzle your mind keeps trying to solve.\", \"Campion is probably best known for \\u201cThe Piano,\\u201d from 1993, for which she was the first woman to win the Palme d\\u2019Or at Cannes and the second female director to be nominated for an Academy Award; the film also won her the Oscar for best original screenplay. She started writing it when she was 31 or 32, an ode to Emily Bront\\u00eb, a longtime hero. (She told me she admired Bront\\u00eb\\u2019s \\u201cfierce independence\\u201d and her ability to create \\u201ca character like Heathcliff out of her imagination, with no experience of men whatsoever personally.\\u201d) In the film, Holly Hunter plays Ada, a mute Scottish woman who communicates her emotional life by playing her piano. Ada arrives in New Zealand with her young daughter to marry a man she has never met. Her husband takes her to live in a forest and sells her piano. When he learns that she has fallen in love with the piano\\u2019s new owner, he cuts off one of her fingers so she can never play again.\", \"\\u201cThe Piano\\u201d offers a blueprint to Campion\\u2019s creative preoccupations: the feminine confronting the masculine in exchanges marked by both violence and desire; the use of landscape to evoke psychological states; mothers and daughters; family units struggling with feelings of love, alienation and betrayal. Her films \\u2014 and her one foray into prestige television, \\u201cTop of the Lake\\u201d \\u2014 have in common a series of traumatized heroines in confrontation with terror, desire and the sublime. Domestic spaces are full of intimacy and danger; sex blows life wide open in starshine or devastation; the threat of violence glimmers around the edges of daily life, irradiating it.\", \"While there are consistent themes running through Campion\\u2019s work, she seems resistant to repeating herself. She works only when she wants to, on the stories she wants to tell, in precisely the way she wants to tell them. After \\u201cThe Piano,\\u201d Campion made the sexual, somewhat campy \\u201cHoly Smoke!\\u201d before moving on to an experimental, psychological adaptation of Henry James\\u2019s \\u201cThe Portrait of a Lady.\\u201d Her next two films after that were \\u201cIn the Cut,\\u201d a gory, erotic thriller about a woman who starts sleeping with a cop she begins to suspect is serially murdering and dismembering women, and \\u201cBright Star,\\u201d a film about Fanny Brawne and John Keats that is pure Romanticism.\", \"\\u201cThe Power of the Dog\\u201d is another departure: an American Western, set in the 1920s. The Western is an unexpected choice for Campion. Not because it\\u2019s an archetypally masculine film genre \\u2014 Campion has often been the lone woman in male-dominated spaces \\u2014 but because it\\u2019s her first feature in which the protagonist is the violent figure, as opposed to the violated. Much has been made of the fact that it\\u2019s also her first project centered on a male leading actor. (She waved this off. \\u201cThey obviously haven\\u2019t met Benedict,\\u201d she joked.)\", \"Like many of Campion\\u2019s films, \\u201cThe Power of the Dog\\u201d dramatizes a clash between the masculine and the feminine \\u2014 Phil\\u2019s own sense of manliness is bound up with emotional remoteness and animosity toward softness. He is a classic American cowboy, skulking around in enormous sheepskin chaps, though he lacks the instinct for chivalry that\\u2019s sometimes a hallmark of that type. He hates and terrorizes Rose (played by Kirsten Dunst), the sensitive woman his brother has married and brought to live in their shared home, as well as her son, an excruciatingly willowy, delicate teenager whose walk alone is an affront to the ranch hands. The film is full of inversions and queerness \\u2014 Phil, it turns out, is a sensualist and attracted to men, and the boy, it turns out, has more violence in him than we think.\", \"Campion read Savage\\u2019s \\u201cThe Power of the Dog,\\u201d which was published in 1967, for fun, not thinking initially of adapting it for film, but the story stayed with her. \\u201cI couldn\\u2019t stop thinking about the themes in the book,\\u201d she told Sofia Coppola onstage at the New York Film Festival this year. She was also impressed with the opening scene, in which a rancher castrates a bull. \\u201cI just\\u00a0went, Oh, my God. OK, so we\\u2019re neutering masculinity. That\\u2019s pretty interesting, right off.\\u201d\", \"Even Campion\\u2019s softest works have a touch of, as she once described it, \\u201cwhat was nasty, what isn\\u2019t spoken about in life.\\u201d In the director\\u2019s commentary for her first feature-length film, \\u201cSweetie,\\u201d she describes an urge that has shaped her oeuvre, one that is on display in new ways in \\u201cThe Power of the Dog.\\u201d She wanted to make work, she said, about what \\u201chas always been on those margins of what\\u2019s acceptable \\u2026 what we as wild creatures really are, as distinct from what society wants us to buy into.\\u201d\", \"When she writes, she often sits on the great island of her bed and does nothing else. One reason she liked the Jungian dream work, she said, is that the analyst\\u2019s language matched some of her own philosophy. \\u201cShe says it\\u2019s like throwing chum out, seeing what surfaces,\\u201d she said. This is what writing feels like for her. \\u201cIt\\u2019s an amazing moment when you realize there\\u2019s a channel. In my case it was just like sitting down for four hours. That was it. Something comes to you. You write. You don\\u2019t read, you don\\u2019t use the phone, you don\\u2019t do anything else, because then the psyche starts to trust the time.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSo many writers have an aversion to just sitting down and waiting,\\u201d I said.\", \"Campion nodded and then paused. \\u201cI think it makes them afraid.\\u201d\", \"When she is not working, Campion divides her time between Australia and New Zealand. She likes walking, especially walking tours, as well as the Bront\\u00ebs, the short stories of Lucia Berlin and YouTube, where she has spent more time than she wants to specify. She drafts by hand into large, cheap notebooks. Anything more expensive, anything \\u201cfancy,\\u201d makes her nervous.\", \"She makes all her notes on paper, which she then stacks into piles and saves. She likes to draw and storyboard while she\\u2019s thinking through a scene \\u2014 she studied painting at art school, in her 20s, before switching to filmmaking. \\u201cI just draw little expressions on their faces, or just the feeling of the work. I\\u2019m thinking about the feeling while I\\u2019m drawing.\\u201d All directors have a way of \\u201cbringing the work inside,\\u201d she said. She takes the drawings to set as references for the director of photography.\", \"She picked up her habits of careful preparation after overworking herself so aggressively on one of her first short films that she landed in intensive care. She had been staying up all night to prepare for the next day\\u2019s shoot, working long days and existing in a more or less constant state of stress. She got bronchitis, which worsened the asthma she has had since childhood, \\u201cand then I just couldn\\u2019t breathe.\\u201d It took most of a year to fully recover.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m a little bit like a machine,\\u201d she said, smiling. \\u201cLike, if it can be done, I will do it. I will do it as best as can be done by me. I can\\u2019t stand if I\\u2019ve got an idea how to improve something not to do it.\\u201d\", \"The student film that made her sick, \\u201cPeel,\\u201d was eventually screened at Cannes, where it won the Palme d\\u2019Or for best short film, making Campion the first New Zealander to win that distinction. But Campion knew that if a seven-minute film wrecked her so completely, she would need a different way of working. \\u201cI thought, God, if anyone finds out I\\u2019m in the hospital trying to make a seven-minute film \\u2014 it\\u2019s actually nine with credits \\u2014 no one\\u2019s ever, ever going to hire me!\\u201d\", \"So she undertook a mission to come down into her body. \\u201cI really noticed that if I got panicky or in my head about things \\u2014 I don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019ve ever had that experience.\\u201d She looked at me with a little grin.\", \"\\u201cOnce or twice,\\u201d I said.\", \"She burst out laughing. \\u201cYou just can\\u2019t think at all! It\\u2019s just the most horrible frightening feeling. Your mind is frozen. So, I had to learn to bring my energy down. Down into the body.\\u201d She did yoga every day for about 20 years. Now she meditates an hour most days. She knows she has to sleep full nights when shooting and have reasonable workdays. She has to be grounded and relaxed and strong. \\u201cIt\\u2019s really strange having a really strong will and yet a fragile \\u2014 \\u201d She paused to look down at her arms and legs. \\u201cThese bodies are fragile. And you have to learn to listen. And make friends with that.\\u201d\", \"If as a screenwriter Campion is interested in uncovering what lies hidden from our conscious minds, as a director she is interested in presence. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re watching on set and you\\u2019re in your head,\\u201d she told me, \\u201cyou can\\u2019t actually feel the impact of what they\\u2019re doing, the actors. And you\\u2019re the only person who\\u2019s looking from that point of view.\\u201d She half-gestured, opening her palms outward slightly, squaring her shoulders. \\u201cYou\\u2019ve got to be relaxed, like an audience would be \\u2014 just relaxed and open. You\\u2019ve just got to watch and then figure, Where\\u2019s my attention? If my attention wanders, I know it didn\\u2019t work.\\u201d Without being calm, focused and in the moment with the actors performing, she can\\u2019t do what she sees as her primary job, which is to sense whether the moment feels right.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve never worked so much in parallel with the director on a project to create a character,\\u201d Cumberbatch said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve had support before, for sure, and a great deal of attention and love, but never somebody who wants to understand \\u2014 and deeply understand \\u2014 a character at the same time as an actor going through his process.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYou really are working on your trust relationship between you and the actors,\\u201d Campion told me. \\u201cYou\\u2019re creating a situation where they feel relaxed and confident that you are with them, that you\\u2019re never going to judge them or go against. You\\u2019ll just try in every way to help.\\u201d\", \"A result is a quality of unguardedness in the performances so acute it\\u2019s almost painful to watch. In \\u201cBright Star,\\u201d for example, Abbie Cornish and Ben Whishaw, as Fanny Brawne and John Keats, are so brimming with \\u2026 something that they can be sitting on camera doing practically nothing and you are just about brought to tears.\", \"Campion said that she wanted, in that film, to convey to the actors \\u201cthat it\\u2019s OK to do nothing. That that\\u2019s presence, and that\\u2019s actually richer than all the pretending in the world.\\u201d She described how all the actors came to rehearsal with their pretty accents and period-piece formality. \\u201cI just felt \\u2026 nothing. I felt sort of sick.\\u201d So she waited, offering no real notes, no expression, just having them do little tasks, like write a letter. \\u201cNo encouragement,\\u201d she said, laughing, \\u201cbecause I kept wanting them to look for something else.\\u201d The actors, confused, would try again and again, getting first nervous, then frustrated, then bored. Eventually, they would give up on pleasing her, or doing much of anything, and something would happen. \\u201cI would just wait till I was interested in them, and then go, Oh! Something true is happening here. I would say: \\u2018I\\u2019m really interested in what you\\u2019re doing right now. Where are you right now?\\u2019 And they started to get it.\\u201d\", \"Campion had mentioned she was fascinated by horses, and I suggested to her that the tactic she was describing with her actors \\u2014 give no feedback until they do what you want, and then praise; let them slowly learn, through comfort and encouragement, what they are supposed to do \\u2014 resembles the method many people use to train horses.\", \"She shrugged. \\u201cWell, we are animals.\\u201d\", \"A documentary about the making of \\u201cThe Portrait of a Lady\\u201d shows Campion speaking softly to a frustrated, weeping Nicole Kidman as they work through an emotionally fraught scene. At one point, she takes Kidman in her arms and rocks her slightly from side to side. Elsewhere, we see her soothing Shelley Winters, who seems to be somewhere between panicking and throwing a tantrum. \\u201cWill somebody pull my socks up?\\u201d Winters complains, and Campion stoops to do it herself.\", \"In each of our conversations, Campion brought up the subject of tenderness. \\u201cTenderness is very important to me,\\u201d she said, sort of hesitating.\", \"\\u201cWhy is that your word,\\u201d I asked, maybe the third time it came up.\", \"\\u201cBecause it is what brings me to my vulnerability, I guess. And I feel like that\\u2019s probably a hard place for me to go to, and it is the place where I feel most touched by life. I guess it\\u2019s the leading edge, you know, of my experience.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cTenderness\\u201d is not the first word I think of when I consider Campion\\u2019s work. I cannot shake the image of the title character in her first feature, \\u201cSweetie,\\u201d shoving porcelain horse figurines into her mouth and chewing them until blood spills out of her smile. But after a while, the tenderness starts to emerge. It\\u2019s a bit like the experience of looking for a long time at a portrait and then realizing, as you look, that the reason the portrait makes you feel so much is the way the painter worked with the negative space, the shadows, the things you don\\u2019t immediately know you\\u2019re looking at. Tenderness may not be the first thing you see in a Campion film, but it is fundamentally what she\\u2019s painting with.\", \"This is especially true in \\u201cThe Power of the Dog,\\u201d where tenderness and brutality amplify each other painfully. There\\u2019s the castration, the cruelty, the extremity of suffering, but there\\u2019s also the gentle way a teenage boy\\u2019s hands shape the paper flowers he likes to make; Dunst\\u2019s trembling lip and the soft way she dances with her husband in the sunset on the day of their marriage; the nakedly sensual, gentle scene of Phil lying in the tall grass, communing with a lost lover by trailing the dead man\\u2019s scarf so that it caresses his face and body; the way he begins to make room for the boy whose paper flowers he mocked. Where there is tenderness, something is unguarded. Tenderness invites a moment of suspense: Care or real hurt can happen next. Campion\\u2019s gift is showing the chaotic mix of wounding and care in human activity, and how the terrifying moment of being opened to both possibilities is an experience of the sublime.\", \"One of the eerier achievements of \\u201cThe Power of the Dog\\u201d is how precisely it captures the way the fear of violence can seep throughout a house, and a life. Phil terrorizes Rose without being anywhere near her. Strains of his banjo floating down the stairs mock her as she plays the piano. His gaze, judgment, even the smell of him seems to be everywhere.\", \"Campion didn\\u2019t realize the depth of her personal connection to the material until late in the process \\u2014 \\u201ca lot later,\\u201d she said, \\u201cuntil I remembered about some stuff in my own childhood.\\u201d When she and her sister, Anna, were young, and their brother was a newborn, their parents hired a nanny, \\u201ca really disturbed woman,\\u201d who abused and terrorized them. On one occasion, she whipped Jane until there were welts on her back. At first, both girls kept silent about how they were treated. \\u201cIt was like this secret world, this secret dark world that was parallel to life. She was with us from when I was about 5 until 10 or 11. And there was just no getting away from it.\\u201d\", \"She paused a moment before continuing. \\u201cWe were really little, and it was a lot to carry when you\\u2019re really little. But it did make me think, That\\u2019s how I understand the terror of Phil. I would always know where she was in the house.\\u201d\", \"I asked if she or her sister ever told her parents about the abuse.\", \"\\u201cYes, we did.\\u201d She has a vivid memory of standing with her sister outside her parents\\u2019 room, getting ready to go in and tell them about the nanny. She balked at the last minute. \\u201cI just can\\u2019t bear that they may not do anything about it. I couldn\\u2019t live with that. I could live with \\u2014 you know \\u2026\\u201d She swallowed. \\u201cBut I couldn\\u2019t bear that they would be told and then they wouldn\\u2019t act. I don\\u2019t know, I was probably 6 at the time. I feel really bad now that I didn\\u2019t support her, but that was the reason.\\u201d Anna went in alone and came out a few minutes later, shaking her head.\", \"They lived with the nanny for another five or so years, until she died. Anna and Jane refused to go to her funeral. Over the years, they tried to convince their parents what it had been like for them, and they were never quite believed.\", \"Campion describes her parents as loving but fundamentally absent during her childhood. The Campions were an important couple in New Zealand theater. They became founders of the first professional touring company in the country, the New Zealand Players, shortly before Jane was born. Richard Campion was a director, and Edith was one of the great New Zealand actresses of her generation. In 1959, she was awarded the M.B.E. for her theatrical work. But it was a troubled household \\u2014 Richard was engaged in a series of affairs, and Edith suffered from depression, which led her to multiple suicide attempts and several stays in institutions throughout her adult life.\", \"Edith appeared in an early film of Campion\\u2019s, \\u201cAn Angel at My Table.\\u201d (More than two decades later, Campion\\u2019s daughter, Alice, had a lead role in \\u201cTop of the Lake.\\u201d) Campion remembers her mother as delicate, sensitive and witty. When her children were young, she turned to writing, eventually publishing a collection of short stories and a novella. She encouraged Campion\\u2019s creative pursuits, but she was also moody and remote. When Campion was little and visited friends\\u2019 houses, she would interview the mothers, trying to get a sense of their schedules, their habits, what they did. What were mothers like?\", \"Campion told me about the day that her mother took her out of school for a dentist appointment. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t do very many things by ourselves together, so I was very excited to show her where I hung my coat.\\u201d After the dentist, they had a picnic in a park, and Campion could sense that her mother\\u2019s mind was elsewhere. \\u201cI tried to do all sorts of amazing things \\u2014 somersaults and handstands, to entertain her, to get her attention \\u2014 but she still looked off into the distance. It probably was depression. I remember she had an egg on her lap, and it just \\u2026 rolled off.\\u201d\", \"There was a time when Campion was so bewildered and persuaded by her mother\\u2019s despair that she told her she would understand if she wanted to die. \\u201cIt really scared me to be close to her complete lack of hope,\\u201d she told an interviewer in 1995. At university, she decided to study structural anthropology, examining the ways humans use myth and social structures to resolve the fundamental oppositions of existence: life and death, light and darkness.\", \"Campion said that feeling vulnerable is harder for her than for most people: \\u201cI associate it with fear.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re so averse to feeling vulnerable,\\u201d I said, \\u201cbut tenderness is the core of your work!\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWell, if it didn\\u2019t have much meaning for me, it wouldn\\u2019t matter,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s got power. And really, my attention decides: What do I pay attention to in the world? Can you fake that, really? Can you really fake attention? Attention is love.\\u201d\", \"In October, I met Campion in Paris. She had just come from the New York Film Festival and then the Lumi\\u00e8re film festival in Lyon, where she received the Prix Lumi\\u00e8re. (In September, she also won the Silver Lion at Venice, one of the top honors a filmmaker can achieve.) We exchanged emails as she arrived in Paris. How was Lyon? I asked. \\u201cLyon was a mosh pit where I became very briefly a rock star!\\u201d she wrote. There were a huge number of women at the festival, many of whom came, it seemed, because they wanted to see a female filmmaker awarded the Prix Lumi\\u00e8re for the first time.\", \"Our plan was to have a long lunch and then go to the Picasso Museum. (I had wanted to watch YouTube together; she demurred.) As we got settled at our table, I asked her how she was dealing with the outpouring of emotion from women who seem so invested in successes, and she threw up her hands. \\u201cDefense and denial,\\u201d she joked. \\u201cI\\u2019m a New Zealander; we don\\u2019t do this sort of stuff. It\\u2019s something you can go to jail for, thinking too much of yourself.\\u201d She shot me a smile. \\u201cI mean, I try to listen to them. To some extent they\\u2019re giving their testimony.\\u201d She has spent a long time being one of the only women at the forefront of her field, a mantle she took up with ambivalence. (A second female director, Julia Ducournau, finally received the Palme d\\u2019Or this year.) Once, after \\u201cThe Piano\\u201d came out, a woman working in a pharmacy approached Campion and told her, in a quivering voice, that seeing the film was the most amazing experience of her life.\", \"\\u201cAnd I was, like, quipping,\\u201d Campion said. \\u201cAnd then I just saw how I hadn\\u2019t received it, and how shattered she looked for not being heard with respect. And I learned something from her, that she really needed me to hear it in a better way than I was doing.\\u201d\", \"It has gotten easier over the years to feel comfortable with what her work means to the world. She pulled up an email from one of her own heroes, Annie Proulx, who wrote an afterword to a 2001 edition of Savage\\u2019s novel. After Campion visited Proulx during her research for \\u201cThe Power of the Dog,\\u201d the two kept up their correspondence. \\u201cThe 60s and 70s can be pretty good years,\\u201d Proulx wrote. \\u201cOne is still agile, nothing major crouched on the bedposts at night; and one\\u2019s sense of judgment and understanding is probably at maximum power. You \\u2018get\\u2019 most situations with a depth and understanding unknown to the more youthful. But some of the gilt wears off in the 80s and you tend to see the hard rusted iron under the fancy metals.\\u201d\", \"Campion, still in her 60s, is in the former state \\u2014 feeling very much at the height of her powers. She doesn\\u2019t know if she\\u2019ll make another film, but for the first time in a while she feels energized and inspired to keep working. She is starting a film school in New Zealand, where filmmakers will study for free under her and a few other friends. (Onstage at the New York Film Festival, Sofia Coppola volunteered to teach as well.)\", \"After lunch, we zipped around the Picasso Museum for half an hour while she waited for a friend and his week-old baby, whom she was eager to meet. The museum was collaborating on a joint exhibit with the nearby Rodin Museum, so there were sculptures from various parts of Rodin\\u2019s career. We stood together for a bit in front of \\u201cThe Thinker.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s definitely a brutish quality to the muscularity, isn\\u2019t there,\\u201d she said quietly after a minute.\", \"I agreed. \\u201cDoesn\\u2019t it look like his head is kind of too small for his body?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cLike a kind of Neanderthal,\\u201d she said.\", \"\\u201cExactly.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cPoor guy. Seems puzzled, like he can\\u2019t figure it out.\\u201d She chuckled. \\u201cIt\\u2019s actually quite moving.\\u201d\", \"She had been showing me photos of a few of the marble Rodin sculptures she admired, and she pulled me over to look at a few similar pieces on display nearby. She preferred them to the big bronze casts. They were of children\\u2019s faces, or women, emerging from the stone with a hazy, dreamlike quality. These pieces were so different from Rodin\\u2019s more famous sculptures of men, in which every muscle and vein was articulated. It was incredible, she thought, taking more pictures, how you could get that kind of softness out of marble.\"]","href_hash":"4ab3c45646c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4ab3c45646c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
