Put one onstage and the artiest notions immediately dissolve into Instagram moments.\", \"Or at least that was my experience with a play called \\u201cThe Art of Theater,\\u201d running through Sunday on a double bill with one called \\u201cWith My Own Hands\\u201d at PS21 in this Hudson Valley town. \\u201cThe Art of Theater\\u201d stars Jim Fletcher \\u2014 a stalwart of the New York avant-garde scene \\u2014 and Delia, a local newcomer best known (according to her owners) as \\u201ca smart if goofy black Labbish sort of beast.\\u201d\", \"You don\\u2019t have to be W.C. Fields to know who wipes the floor with whom.\", \"Even without canine competition, the avant-garde has been having a hard time of late. By \\u201cof late\\u201d I mean both the last several decades and the last two years. The political, aesthetic and social disruptions that have often bred theatrical experimentalism can just as easily suppress it; take a look at the plight of the Belarus Free Theater, banned by the Lukashenko government in its home country, forced into exile and now seeking a new base in Europe.\", \"But the Covid pandemic has done even more than dictators to push avant-garde theater off the map. In New York, the three big January showcases of experimental work were once again radically curtailed: the Exponential Festival retreating to online production; Prototype and the Public Theater\\u2019s Under the Radar festival folding entirely.\", \"Well, almost entirely. \\u201cThe Art of Theater\\u201d and \\u201cWith My Own Hands,\\u201d both by the French playwright, director and choreographer Pascal Rambert, survived the Under the Radar cancellation at this supercool avant-garde hothouse in Columbia County.\", \"And supercool it was on Saturday afternoon \\u2014 just 4 degrees outside \\u2014 when, despite free hot toddies and cocoa, an audience of about 25 sat not just masked but variously scarved, coated and hatted as the program began in PS21\\u2019s black box theater.\", \"\\u201cWith My Own Hands,\\u201d which came first, is not exactly a warming experience. This 1993 specimen of the classic avant-garde \\u2014 if that isn\\u2019t a paradox \\u2014 consists of an intense, disturbing and mostly impenetrable 45-minute monologue delivered at breakneck speed by a character bent on suicide. At least that\\u2019s what I think was going on; the script, mimicking the disorderly and pressurized output of a mind in fatal distress, speeds right past pauses and punctation as it twists multiple points of view into a furious screed:\", \"\\u201cM. says to me you\\u2019re getting on everyone\\u2019s nerves you smother anyone\\u2019s slightest desire to listen stop bawling someday I won\\u2019t stand for it anymore and I\\u2019ll lock you up pants down in a dark room facing yourself facing myself I write to Hans facing myself here I am facing myself while the bombs come down around me I sunbathe here.\\u201d\", \"As a technical matter, speech like that cannot be easy to perform, but Isma\\u00efl ibn Conner, under the playwright\\u2019s direction, shapes each clause, no matter how bewilderingly it butts up against others, into razor-edged shards of anguish. Grandiosity, paranoia and pathos flicker like pages in a flipbook, sometimes (in Nicholas Elliott\\u2019s suitably grim translation) coalescing into memorably awful images. \\u201cTear all the memory wires out of your head,\\u201d the character begs himself, or perhaps the audience.\", \"But if the actor\\u2019s grasp on the character is astonishing, the character\\u2019s grasp on the audience \\u2014 as is too often the case with the avant-garde \\u2014 is weak. To make up for it, the playwright eventually brings out the gun you\\u2019ve been expecting all along.\", \"In a way, a gun onstage is not unlike a dog: It rips the fabric of theatrical artifice, replacing it with its own kind of drama. A gun\\u2019s drama, though, is usually dull, with only two possible outcomes: It gets used or it doesn\\u2019t. But as \\u201cWith My Own Hands\\u201d transitioned (cleverly) into \\u201cThe Art of Theater\\u201d \\u2014 a 30-minute monologue from 2007, in which an actor played by Fletcher muses aloud to his dog about acting \\u2014 it was the dog\\u2019s drama that took on living dimension.\", \"Not just because the script invests her with human intelligence. (\\u201cTheater is low,\\u201d the actor instructs. \\u201cSpeak low. And if you bark \\u2014 bark low.\\u201d) Rather, Delia, a 4-year-old rescue with a sweetheart face and very good manners, can\\u2019t help insisting on the canine kind of intelligence. Though she generally sits and listens as required, there is no suppressing her brilliant improvisational skills. Do I smell peanut butter? Let\\u2019s get some! Was that a noise in the audience? Let\\u2019s investigate! She is less the straight man in the actor\\u2019s tale than he is in hers.\", \"Fletcher, best known to New York playgoers as Jay Gatsby in the Elevator Repair Service production of \\u201cGatz,\\u201d speaks beautifully and never barks. Still, I didn\\u2019t find the actual text of \\u201cThe Art of Theater\\u201d \\u2014 again translated by Elliott and directed by Rambert \\u2014 very fascinating. The actor\\u2019s thoughts about his art, and the theater types he usually works with, are unsurprising except when occasionally off-putting.\", \"\\u201cI never liked old women,\\u201d he says. \\u201cOld women are so boring.\\u201d\", \"But the contrast Rambert draws between this self-involved sourpuss and a good girl like Delia is a brilliant way of making you think about performance. Not just what it costs the performer \\u2014 though it\\u2019s poignantly true, as he says, that \\u201cas an actor you have understood that you are a dog and that you will be abandoned.\\u201d In that sense, all people are at the mercy of masters; even the character in \\u201cWith My Own Hands\\u201d is \\u201ca man trapped in a dog\\u2019s body.\\u201d\", \"A dog is not trapped in a dog\\u2019s body, though. She is her body. She doesn\\u2019t have actorly affectations or a good side to turn to the light. She is simply happy to make her people happy; in a way, that\\u2019s her job, and Delia is very good at it. When, late in the play, Fletcher picks her up in his arms for a slow dance, she licks his face as they sway.\", \"On a very cold day in a rather cold genre, that was finally warmth enough.\"]","href_hash":"fdebaab677c711ecaa996125aba45970"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fdebaab677c711ecaa996125aba45970"}},
