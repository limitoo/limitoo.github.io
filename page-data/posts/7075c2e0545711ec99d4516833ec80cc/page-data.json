It\\u2019s cookie season, our Genevieve Ko reports, and her team has assembled an incredible calendar of holiday recipes (above) to enjoy this weekend and for the rest of the month, either for yourself or for gift packages to distribute to family and friends.\", \"Behold the array! We\\u2019ve got gingerbread biscotti and iced oatmeal cookies from Jerrelle Guy, and no-bake chocolate clusters from Dorie Greenspan. Genevieve contributed recipes for guava and cream cheese twists and peanut butter cookies.\", \"Yewande Komolafe brought us hibiscus-spiraled ginger cookies and spiced orange crumble cookies. In keeping with his exploration of commodity deliciousness, Eric Kim delivered a fine recipe for M&M cookies.\", \"Here\\u2019s Vaughn Vreeland\\u2019s recipe for peppermint brownie cookies, and Melissa Clark\\u2019s for almond spritz cookies and chocolate babka rugelach. Samantha Seneviratne came through with fig and cherry cookie pies, and New York Times reader Naomi Donabedian offered her stunner for the Finnish cookie known as piparkaut.\", \"Claire Saffitz\\u2019s minty lime bars are in the mix as well, along with Alexa Weibel\\u2019s raspberry slices and, for the savory-cookie crowd, there are Kay Chun\\u2019s Cheddar cheese coins and Ali Slagle\\u2019s mixed-nut shortbread.\", \"Try Margaux Laskey\\u2019s Italian rainbow cookies adapted from Mary Carpino and Krysten Chambrot\\u2019s torticas de Mor\\u00f3n, a Cuban favorite. Also, Yossy Arefi is here with recipes for tahini thumbprints with dulce de leche and chocolate-cherry ginger cookies, and Sohla El-Waylly with brown-butter toffee sandwich cookies, chewy gingerbread cookies and fruity meltaways.\", \"That\\u2019s a lot of cookies! I hope some of you make them all this month. (For help in that pursuit, make sure to sign up for our December newsletter, \\u201cYour Daily Cookie.\\u201d We\\u2019ll send you a cookie recipe every day until Christmas.)\", \"For sustenance as you bake, please consider our recipe for the chef Thomas Keller\\u2019s butternut squash soup with brown butter. Or for kimbap. Or for this remarkable dish of pan-roasted chicken in cream sauce, which the chef Angie Mar taught me to make in her tiny kitchen at the Beatrice Inn in Manhattan, before she decamped for a more commodious and luxe space next door at Les Trois Chevaux.\", \"Maybe you\\u2019d prefer garlicky beef tenderloin with orange horseradish sauce? Or tofu makhani?\", \"There are many thousands more recipes to consider making this weekend waiting for you on New York Times Cooking. (As we\\u2019ve discussed a few times, I believe, you need a subscription to access them. Subscriptions are what allow us to continue to do this work that we love. If you haven\\u2019t gotten one already, I hope you will subscribe today. You can also buy gift subscriptions.) Further inspiration is on our Instagram page and our YouTube channel, where some of our cookies contributors will be showing off their recipes over these next few days.\", \"And do reach out if you find yourself flummoxed in the kitchen or by our technology. Just write cookingcare@nytimes.com and someone will get back to you.\", \"Now, it\\u2019s nothing to do with ranch dressing or chicory, but you should read Ian Urbina\\u2019s harrowing story, in The New Yorker, about the brutal system of migrant jails in Libya and the complicity of the European Union in what the United Nations recently formally labeled state-directed crimes against humanity. Urbina and his team paid a heavy price for their reporting, as you\\u2019ll see.\", \"Here\\u2019s a lovely fish story in Experience, by Matt Crossman, on a legendary strain of California trout that\\u2019s found in Crane Creek in Missouri and how it might have gotten there. (A tip of the hat to the essential Longreads for highlighting it.)\", \"Are you following us on TikTok yet? Y\\u2019oughta.\", \"Finally, as we continue to reflect on the life and legacy of Stephen Sondheim, who died last week at 91, here\\u2019s Sarah Vaughan with his \\u201cSend in the Clowns.\\u201d Haunting. I\\u2019ll see you on Sunday.\"]","href_hash":"7075c2e0545711ec99d4516833ec80cc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7075c2e0545711ec99d4516833ec80cc"}},
