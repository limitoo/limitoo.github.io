There was no immediate reply to requests for comments from representatives for Jones or Owens.\", \"On right-wing social media groups, some Trump voters argued that he is acting strategically to keep hostile media at bay. Others, however, professed dismay.\", \"\\\"I no longer can support him,\\\" Daniel McLean, 42, who works in the cannabis industry in Oregon, said in an interview.\", \"McLean said he had steadily grown disappointed with what he views as Trump's embrace of the political establishment. The pro-vaccine comments were a tipping point, added McLean, who said he was not inoculated and repeated debunked theories about thousands of people dying from the shots.\", \"Republicans and Republican-leaning independents now account for 60% of unvaccinated adult Americans, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis.\", \"That makes Trump's comments all the more surprising, said Republican Martin Hyde, who is running as a challenger to Florida Congressman Vern Buchanan in the 2022 elections. \\\"I don't think that's a message which will resonate with the base,\\\" Hyde told Reuters.\", \"Trump continues to have a near-iron grip on Republican voters.\", \"Candidates in the 2022 midterm elections are vying for his endorsements; he is the clear favorite for the 2024 presidential race; and he is preparing to launch a social media site that has reportedly entered into agreements to raise about $1 billion.\", \"\\\"I'm with Trump all the way,\\\" wrote a user under the name Crockett on a Telegram app chat about Trump's vaccine comments. \\\"Trump knows things we don't.\\\"\", \"There is no polling yet to ascertain whether Trump's vaccine comments have hurt his standing with the base.\", \"Nicholas Valentino, a professor specializing in political psychology at the University of Michigan, said it is unlikely to create a serious rift.\", \"\\\"The more extreme faction in this group doesn't have anywhere else to go politically,\\\" said Valentino. McLean in Oregon, for instance, said he still prefers Trump over Biden.\", \"Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a key Trump ally, on Monday appeared to try to smooth over the issue, urging supporters to focus on COVID-19 originating in China. \\\"We should be holding those who made the virus accountable, not fighting one another,\\\" she said on Twitter.\", \"Still, Ron Filipkowski, a former federal prosecutor and Trump critic who monitors the extreme right, said Trump going out of his way to tout the vaccines has sent \\\"shockwaves\\\" through his base.\", \"\\\"A year ago, you would never hear any dissent whatsoever among them,\\\" said Filipkowski. \\\"Now you're at least hearing the grumbling and the griping.
