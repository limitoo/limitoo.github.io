Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, successfully argued that he had acted in self-defense.\", \"Protesters who gathered to decry Rittenhouse's acquittal on Sunday also invoked Kizer's name, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938434/activists-protest-kyle-rittenhouse-acquittal.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Activists protest the verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial on November 21, 2021 in Kenosha, Wisconsin. </div>\", \"They argue that her case should have the same outcome as Rittenhouse's.\", \"\\\"Show Chrystul Kizer the same attention,\\\" Bishop Tavis Grant, of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition, said on Sunday, according to WUWM. \\\"Show her the same sympathy. Make her a hero.\\\"\", \"State Rep. David Bowen, a Democrat, called on protesters to take up Kizer's cause with the same energy they put into Rittenhouse and Blake.\", \"\\\"Now you've got a chance to change the narrative,\\\" he said, according to the Journal Sentinel. \\\"That if you truly believe in justice, just like the Lord believes in justice, then you too can fight for justice for that Black woman, who deserves it.\\\"\", \"Kizer is awaiting trial on charges in the 2018 killing of 34-year-old Randall Volar III. Prosecutors allege Kizer went to his home in Kenosha, shot him in the head, set his house on fire and stole his car. At the time of his death, Volar was under investigation for sex trafficking underage girls.\", \"Prosecutors contend Kizer's killing of Volar was premeditated and that she wanted to steal from him, but her attorneys are arguing that she acted in self-defense. Wisconsin law provides an affirmative defense for any crime committed as a \\\"direct result\\\" of being trafficked, but it has never been argued in a homicide case.\", \"A Kenosha County judge had ruled in 2019 that Kizer couldn't use that defense. But that decision was reversed earlier this year by an appellate court, which ruled that Kizer could argue her actions resulted from being trafficked. The Wisconsin Supreme Court is reviewing the decision.\", \"Julius Kim, an attorney and former criminal prosecutor in Wisconsin, told NPR that invoking an affirmative defense shifts the burden of proof onto the prosecution.\", \"If the defense proves Kizer was a sex trafficking victim, then it falls on the state to \\\"prove beyond a reasonable doubt that either she wasn't a victim of human sex trafficking or that the crime that she committed was not a direct result of that human sex trafficking,\\\" Kim said.\", \"Kizer was released from jail in June last year after the Chicago Community Bond Fund and other supporters raised money to post her $400,000 bond.\", \"A Change petition calling for the charges against her to be dropped has amassed more than 1.4 million signatures.\"]","href_hash":"6a7554e44c5211ec8479a70135c7437b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6a7554e44c5211ec8479a70135c7437b"}},
