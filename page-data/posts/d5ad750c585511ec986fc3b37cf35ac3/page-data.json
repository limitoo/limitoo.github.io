In Denver, more than 230 days have passed without snow, the city\\u2019s second-longest such stretch in more than a century. The snow, when it does come, will the be latest ever to fall in Denver.\", \"Colorado\\u2019s mountain resorts are looking to storm systems predicted for Thursday and Friday to reset the pace for the season. They are hoping for several feet of snow in some areas. In Denver, only a few inches may fall, but it\\u2019s the \\u201cbest chance we\\u2019ve seen for snow in a while,\\u201d Bernie Meier, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Boulder, said.\", \"Mr. Meier said the state\\u2019s snowpack, the layers of snow accumulated in the mountains, is about half of what it should be.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re not very far into the snow season at least, so there is time to make up that deficit,\\u201d he said. \\u201cRight now, it\\u2019s been a slow start.\\u201d\", \"This year is shaping up to be among the five hottest years in Colorado history, Brad Rippey, a meteorologist at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, said.\", \"More than half the country experienced drought conditions through the end of November, and this fall was the third warmest recorded, according to data released Wednesday by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It was the second-warmest fall in Colorado, as well as in Montana and Wyoming, which are also popular with skiers.\", \"Russ Schumacher, the director of the Colorado Climate Center, said the state had experienced a warming trend over the past two decades. This is \\u201cthe climate change signal in its clearest form,\\u201d he said, adding that Colorado\\u2019s exacerbated drought conditions affected other states that rely on its water.\", \"\\u201cWe have a long history of water challenges in the West, of course, and climate change is making those worse,\\u201d Mr. Schumacher said. \\u201cThe snow that falls in our mountains in Colorado is the biggest natural reservoir of water that ends up running downstream to many other states.\\u201d\", \"Colorado\\u2019s ski resorts often depend on snow machines early in the season. This year\\u2019s warm temperatures statewide have sharply limited snow-making, which can be conducted only at colder temperatures. This has led resorts to delay opening dates and significantly reduce the amount of terrain open to the public.\", \"Despite warm temperatures in southwestern Colorado, Purgatory Resort in the San Juan Mountains opened on time the weekend before Thanksgiving after some \\u201cfairly good snow-making,\\u201d Dave Rathbun, the resort\\u2019s general manager, said. The resort\\u2019s season generally lasts through mid-April, he added.\", \"\\u201cThe technology improvements have really helped us outwit Mother Nature,\\u201d Mr. Rathbun said. \\u201cWe are basically snow farmers. We always play the cards we are dealt.\\u201d\", \"About 5 percent of the mountain is open, although snow showers predicted for the remainder of this week could soon change that.\", \"At Steamboat Ski Resort in northwestern Colorado, five of the mountain\\u2019s 170 trails are open. Loryn Duke, a spokeswoman for the resort, said this season had been the warmest that she could recall in the decade and a half that she had worked there.\", \"Ms. Duke said that all the snow at the resort so far this season had been artificially produced, although more than two feet of snow was expected to fall this week. \", \"\\u201cI always think it\\u2019s incredible that it\\u2019s a billion-dollar industry that depends on something you have zero control over,\\u201d Ms. Duke said.\", \"Skiers said they were cautiously eying the weather and forecasts of snow.\", \"Phillip Luxner, 44, of Denver, said he waited until the \\u201clast minute\\u201d to purchase an Epic ski pass, which grants access to numerous resorts throughout the season. He said he had bought his passes on Sunday, while sitting on his patio in 60-degree weather wearing shorts and sandals.\", \"\\u201cBuying ski passes in flip-flops feels weird,\\u201d Mr. Luxner said, noting that he did not plan to head out to the slopes soon. He said he would wait for a series of significant snowstorms to hit and for the resorts to open more terrain.\", \"\\u201cI have no desire to ski up there on a green run with a thousand people,\\u201d he said.\", \"Collin Race Fenimore, 27, said his first ski trip of the season on Friday at Summit County\\u2019s Copper Mountain Resort had been uncomfortably hot. The slopes had started out icy in the morning and then turned to slush, he said, adding that only a few lifts and ski runs had been open.\", \"\\u201cIt was probably a high of 50 degrees, but it really felt like 75 with your ski clothes on,\\u201d Mr. Fenimore said. \\u201cEarly season is never great snow, but I\\u2019ve never really been a part of one that\\u2019s been this bad. So it\\u2019s definitely a bummer, and I\\u2019m hoping we get some more snow.\\u201d\", \"Resorts are hoping to make up for the steep losses they incurred when pandemic restrictions shut down all Colorado ski areas in March 2020, during the high season. The closings reduced ski visits by about four million, Melanie Mills, president and chief executive officer of Colorado Ski Country USA, said.\", \"That season was devastating, said Alan Henceroth, chief operating officer of Arapahoe Basin in the Rocky Mountains.\", \"\\u201cThis is a really big year for us,\\u201d he said. Referring to the 2019-20 and 2020-21 seasons, he added, \\u201cWe were coming off a horrible year and then a year that was pretty good, considering, and we need to have a good year.\\u201d\", \"Mountain resorts did steady business last season, operating through midspring under local and state Covid-19 restrictions, Ms. Mills said. These mandatory regulations, such as capacity limits and reservations, have since been lifted.\", \"Mr. Henceroth said that sales at Arapahoe Basin were stronger than expected last year. The resounding message was that people wanted to be on the slopes, he said.\", \"\\u201cI think people really wanted to ski, or ride their bike, do whatever,\\u201d Mr. Henceroth said. \\u201cSo many parts of all of our lives were thwarted, they wanted to get out and do stuff.\\u201d\", \"Every ski season is important, Mr. Luxner said, adding that he didn\\u2019t want his children to miss out on a cherished pastime.\", \"\\u201cI want to make sure my kids have the same opportunities I did when I was growing up out here, which is to get out to the mountains,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe don\\u2019t have the beach. We\\u2019ve got this.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"d5ad750c585511ec986fc3b37cf35ac3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d5ad750c585511ec986fc3b37cf35ac3"}},
