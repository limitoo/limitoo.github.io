So I think that particular trial is off to a bad start,\\\" Bass said.\", \"Bass' comments come after a jury composed of 11 white members and just one Black person was chosen last week in Glynn County, Georgia. The jury will oversee the trial against white defendants Gregory McMichael, Travis McMichael and William \\\"Roddie\\\" Bryan, who are accused of murdering Arbery\\u2014a 25-year-old Black unarmed jogger\\u2014after they allegedly chased him down in a residential neighborhood in February 2020.\", \"The suspects each pleaded not guilty and claimed they pursued Arbery believing he was involved in several break-ins in the local area, and that Travis McMichael fired a shotgun in self-defense following an altercation when they caught up with Arbery.\", \"During the jury selection process, the pool of possible candidates was initially composed of 36 white people and 12 Black people. However, the defense team used 11 of its strikes to remove all but one of the Black jurors \\u2013 a move that even Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley said appeared to show \\\"intentional discrimination.\\\"\", \"Nonetheless, Walmsley said that he would allow the jury to continue because the defense team was able to provide \\\"legitimate, nondiscriminatory, clear, reasonably specific and related reason,\\\" for why it struck each candidate. The decision has since sparked outrage from the prosecution team and civil rights attorneys.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932097/ahmaud-arbery-trial-white-jury.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Rep.
