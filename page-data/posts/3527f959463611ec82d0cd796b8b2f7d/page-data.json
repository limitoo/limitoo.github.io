Turin police officers told AP that this Telegram chat had tens of thousands of members and that the searches turned up weapons and flammable acid.\", \"The chat served as a \\\"prime forum\\\" for organizing protests against Italy's Green Pass requirements.\", \"The Green Pass shows proof of COVID-19 vaccination, recent negative test or already having and being cured of the virus. Italy and several other European countries require people to show their pass to enter restaurants, museums, movie theaters and long-distance public transport.\", \"Protests grew last month after Italy began to require the pass to access workplaces, becoming the first Western country to do so. Nearly every weekend, there is a new anti-vaccine or anti-pass protest in the country's major cities.\", \"AP reported that Turin police monitored the Basta Dittatura chat for weeks. The 17 extremists searched were deemed the most dangerous, making threats to people like Prime Minister Mario Draghi.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932412/italy-anti-vaccine-protest.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Police conducted searches across Italy on Monday against 17 anti-vaccine activists who were affiliated with a Telegram chat group that espoused violence against government, medical and media figures for their perceived support of COVID-19 restrictions.

In one protest October 9 in Rome, extremists trashed the headquarters of Italy's main labor union. A protest this past weekend in Milan featured American anti-vaccine activist Robert F. Kennedy.\", \"Last week, the Interior Ministry issued guidance to police departments nationwide advising them to restrict protests from being staged in congested city centers. The ministry reaffirmed the right of protesters to gather, but cited the potential threat to public security and contagion in recommending protests be allowed only farther afield.\", \"Italy, where the coronavirus outbreak first erupted in Europe in February 2020, is seeing a steady increase in its daily caseload amid a new wave of infections. Authorities registered 62 cases per 100,000 inhabitants last week, the third consecutive week of increased incidence.\", \"But Italy for now is doing better than many other western European countries. Nationwide, hospital bed capacity is well below the critical threshold and, while Italy's official death toll of 132,775 remains one of the highest in Europe, daily deaths have remained under 100 for months.
