As he slows down, the past keeps catching up. His memories, visions and daily struggles all run together in Yogi\\u2019s twilight story about coming to terms with death and finding love\\u2019s embrace.\", \"Masao lives humbly with his dog, but his daughter and one of his sons step in to help when he falls ill. He hasn\\u2019t accepted that his body is ailing, and we gather that his children have not forgotten his failings as a parent. A grandson who\\u2019s called upon to help seems to feel disconnected from his elder, and vaguely embarrassed by him.\", \"Yogi peels back some of the layers of the family tensions with flashbacks to Masao\\u2019s prior selves. We see Masao after his wife, Grace, has died, when he\\u2019s younger and pushing away the responsibility of parenting. Farther back, shortly after World War II, a teenage Masao faces his family\\u2019s objections to Grace\\u2019s Chinese background.\", \"In the present, Masao is visited by the conciliatory ghost of Grace (Constance Wu, a healing presence). The stillness of the island setting breathes with an unforced spirituality. But as appealing as Yogi\\u2019s ethereal aims are, the film\\u2019s highly variable performances and on-the-nose scenes sap the film of intensity, which its often slack assembly doesn\\u2019t supply either.\", \"The film ends with a wondrous tableau well suited to expressing the strangeness of life and death, but it might have captivated more by saying less.\"]","href_hash":"be6db53e486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"be6db53e486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}},
