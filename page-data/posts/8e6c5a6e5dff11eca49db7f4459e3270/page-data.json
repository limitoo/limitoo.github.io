Still, the cast and crew stayed in touch, regularly video chatting and sharing their ongoing research.\", \"But in August, when the United States ended its longest war and the Taliban took over, their conversations changed. What did their play mean now, in this new geopolitical reality? Had their duty to their characters changed? What memories and frustrations would audiences now be bringing to the performance?\", \"\\u201cWe were in almost daily contact about the changing situation in Afghanistan,\\u201d the director, Tyne Rafaeli, said, \\u201cand starting to understand and analyze how that changing situation was going to affect our play.\\u201d\", \"Sylvia Khoury, the playwright, also wrestled with the new resonance of her work. Ultimately, she decided not to alter the text, wanting to honor the historical moment and the individual experiences that had generated it.\", \"\\u201cThe time that we\\u2019re in really colors certain moments of the play in different ways,\\u201d Khoury said in a video interview last month after the show began previews. \\u201cI haven\\u2019t changed them. A play is a fixed thing, as history continues.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSelling Kabul\\u201d takes place in 2013, as the Obama administration began its long withdrawal of troops. Khoury wrote it in 2015, after speaking with several interpreters waiting for Special Immigrant Visas. And because that visa program, created by Congress to give refuge to Afghans and Iraqis who helped the U.S. military, requires rigorous vetting, many have been stuck in bureaucratic limbo for years. Now many American allies and partners remain in the country, potentially vulnerable to Taliban reprisals.\", \"\\u201cThat time elapsed really speaks to a profound moral failure,\\u201d Khoury said. \\u201cThat time elapsing, in itself, really showed us our own shame.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSelling Kabul,\\u201d a Playwrights Horizons production that opened earlier this month and is scheduled to close Dec. 23, shines a light on the human cost of America\\u2019s foreign conflicts. It neither reprimands its audience nor offers catharsis. Instead, Khoury delivers an intense, intimate look at four people caught in a web of impossible choices.\", \"\\u201cIf I still bit my nails I would have no nails left now,\\u201d Alexis Soloski wrote in her review for The New York Times.\", \"In the play, Taroon, who was an interpreter for the U.S. military, is waiting for a promised visa. He has just become a father \\u2014 his wife had their son just before the play starts \\u2014 but he cannot be with them. He\\u2019s in hiding at his sister Afiya\\u2019s apartment, where he has been holed up for four months hoping to evade the Taliban. But on this evening, they seem to be growing closer and closer.\", \"Taroon has to leave Kabul. And he has to leave soon.\", \"\\u201cBeyond the headlines, this play homes in on the detail, the intense detail of how this foreign policy affects these four people, on this day, in this apartment,\\u201d Rafaeli said.\", \"Told in real time, the 95-minute play is performed without an intermission. As fear intensifies and violence creeps closer, the four characters fight to keep secrets, and to keep one another alive, but they are also forced to make decisions that could endanger the others.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s not really one bad person, and they\\u2019re not just in a difficult circumstance; they\\u2019re in an impossible circumstance,\\u201d said Marjan Neshat, who plays Afiya. \", \"The coronavirus pandemic has changed the tone of the play, too. During an earlier run in 2019 at the Williamstown Theater Festival, audiences could only imagine Taroon\\u2019s claustrophobia. Now, they can remember. Khoury said she hopes that viewers come away with an understanding of how their individual actions can affect people they will never meet.\", \"\\u201cAs Americans, we used to think it was enough to tend our own gardens,\\u201d Khoury said. \\u201cNow, I think we\\u2019re realizing: It\\u2019s not even close to enough.\\u201d \", \"Khoury wrote \\u201cSelling Kabul\\u201d while in medical school at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Pulling from conversations with Afghan interpreters, and from her own family history, she weaves a nuanced portrait of the myth of America.\", \"\\u201cNo one that I ever spoke to was ever unclear that they wanted to come to America,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt was safer for them.\\u201d\", \"In the play, Afiya\\u2019s neighbor Leyla remembers the soldiers as fun, even handsome. Afiya \\u2014 who speaks English better than Taroon does, despite being forced out of school when the Taliban took control in the 1990s \\u2014 thinks Americans are untrustworthy. \", \"\\u201cTo me, America is just the great abandoner,\\u201d said Neshat, explaining her character\\u2019s view. \\u201cLike, \\u2018You promised this thing that you could never fulfill. And, how dare you?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"And for Taroon, America is a promise. \\u201cAmerica, their word is good,\\u201d he tells Afiya.\", \"When \\u201cSelling Kabul\\u201d was first performed at the Williamstown Theater Festival, Donald Trump was president. That was a laugh line. Now, there aren\\u2019t many chuckles, but Taroon\\u2019s conviction still stings.\", \"\\u201cOur word still is not good,\\u201d Khoury said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s something that\\u2019s difficult to admit on this side of the political spectrum.\\u201d\", \"Realizing that her play might leave audience members wondering what they can do to help, Khoury started a private fund-raiser for the International Refugee Assistance Project, which will follow the play as it moves to other cities. Information about the charity is tucked inside each Playbill.\", \"\\u201cNot giving people somewhere to go after felt like a missed opportunity,\\u201d Khoury said.\", \"The playwright also held up a moral mirror to audiences in \\u201cPower Strip,\\u201d a story about Syrian refugees at a migrant camp in Greece, which debuted at Lincoln Center in 2019. In \\u201cSelling Kabul,\\u201d her characters also stand on the precipice of leaving almost everything they know.\", \"\\u201cThe stories of how we left are the fabric of my childhood, from country to country, in pretty extreme circumstances,\\u201d said Khoury, who is of Lebanese and French descent, and whose family has been affected by colonial and imperial shifts across the Middle East and North Africa.\", \"\\u201cWho are you, before you leave? Who is the person who makes the decision to go?\\u201d she said, adding, \\u201cAnd it\\u2019s without saying goodbye, in most of the stories I know. It\\u2019s immediately. It\\u2019s taking the first truck you can.\\u201d\", \"As audiences filed out of the theater after a recent performance, one friend turned to another. Where do you think they are now? she wondered. What happened to them?\", \"For Neshat, who was born in Iran and moved to the United States when she was 8, that\\u2019s almost too painful to think about. \", \"\\u201cHow do you choose between your best friend neighbor and your brother?\\u201d she said of the play\\u2019s excruciating dilemmas. \\u201cLike, how do you do that?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8e6c5a6e5dff11eca49db7f4459e3270"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8e6c5a6e5dff11eca49db7f4459e3270"}},
