And yet she thrived.\", \"\\u201cI was more Don Draper than Peggy Olson,\\u201d Ms. Cutler wrote in an unpublished memoir in 2016, referring to the creative force at the center of the television series \\u201cMad Men\\u201d and to his female underling, who struggled to be taken seriously.\", \"During her five-decade career on Madison Avenue, Ms. Cutler was indeed a force. She was the only woman on Fortune magazine\\u2019s list of 11 \\u201cseminal thinkers\\u201d of the 1980s. (Others included Milton Friedman, Peter Drucker and T. Boone Pickens.) Ladies\\u2019 Home Journal called her one of the 50 most powerful women in America in 1990, noting that she was not just a figurehead but someone who left a lasting impression and could get her phone calls returned.\", \"The Advertising Federation of America (now the American Advertising Federation) named her \\u201cWoman of the Year\\u201d in 1985. And in a sly twist, 10 years later she was the first woman the federation named \\u201cMan of the Year.\\u201d She was inducted into the Advertising Hall of Fame in 2011.\", \"Ms. Cutler died on Nov. 28 at her home in Manhattan. She was 94. Her daughter, Amy Bernstein, confirmed the death.\", \"A high-powered career woman and for a time a single mother of three, Ms. Cutler cracked Madison Avenue\\u2019s glass ceiling during advertising\\u2019s Golden Age, when women were rarely seen as more than secretaries.\", \"In the 1960s, she was a creative director at McCann Erickson, the global agency that was depicted in \\u201cMad Men\\u201d as buying out the fictitious Sterling Cooper.\", \"Ms. Cutler was also a futurist, forecasting trends for major corporations. Lee Iacocca, Chrysler\\u2019s hard-charging chairman, was so impressed with her insights that he appointed her a corporate officer in 1988 \\u2014 even allowing her to retain her senior management position at FCB/Leber Katz Partners, her home ad agency in New York.\", \"While Ms. Cutler knew nothing about cars \\u2014 she never drove, even after finally getting a driver\\u2019s license \\u2014 she had a keen sense of what consumers wanted. She told Chrysler to stop aiming its ads at car dealers and instead to talk directly to consumers, which she helped it do. She also helped set in motion one of Chrysler\\u2019s boldest moves: its acquisition of American Motors, the makers of Jeep. Asked during a board meeting to name the best-known car brand in the world, she had blurted out \\u201cJeep.\\u201d\", \"Flying to Detroit every week to work for two or three days for the automaker while also holding a high-level job in New York took its toll. After three years, she was exhausted and stepped down from Chrysler.\", \"At FCB/Leber Katz Partners, her clients included Campbell Soup, Citicorp, RJR Nabisco and Marriott. There, she demonstrated a talent for identifying opportunities in the marketplace and helping her clients fill them.\", \"One of her big successes was Prego spaghetti sauce, a Campbell product. The most important role she played in the Prego campaign, she told Inc. magazine in 1987, \\u201cwas convincing them to change the name from Campbell\\u2019s Very Own Spaghetti Sauce, which was very much a 1970s concept, to Prego, which was much more \\u201980s.\\u201d The day before she had to present her proposal for a name, she scanned an English-Italian dictionary and plucked out \\u201cprego,\\u201d which means both \\u201cplease\\u201d and \\u201cyou\\u2019re welcome.\\u201d\", \"She also spared her clients embarrassment. At one point, a tire manufacturer, upon hearing that women made most car and tire purchases, rolled out for her inspection a tire that was pink. She was aghast.\", \"\\u201cWhat were you thinking?\\u201d she asked. When it comes to carting around their families, she informed the clueless executive, women want safety and reliability, not nail-polish hues.\", \"As a futurist, she foresaw dynamics that characterize the consumer marketplace today. Faced with an increasing number of options, she said, consumers would no longer shop exclusively at upscale or downscale stores. \\u201cThe very same people would buy at Neiman Marcus in the morning and Kmart in the afternoon,\\u201d she told Inc.\", \"\\u201cWe are dealing with the smartest consumer we\\u2019ve ever dealt with,\\u201d she added. \\u201cShe\\u2019ll pay the difference if she can see it, taste it, smell it, feel it or show it off somehow. But if she can\\u2019t, she won\\u2019t.\\u201d\", \"Laurel Eve Cutler was born on Dec. 8, 1926, in Manhattan. Her father, Aaron Smith Cutler, was a trial lawyer in New York and a partner of Fiorello H. La Guardia, the future New York mayor. Her mother, Dorothy (Glaser) Cutler, was a schoolteacher and homemaker.\", \"Laurel grew up in Manhattan and Great Neck, on Long Island. She skipped two grades in elementary school and entered Wellesley College at 15.\", \"When she graduated in 1946 with a double major in English composition and philosophy, she wanted to be a lawyer. Not only was her father a top litigator, but her older brother, Lloyd, fresh out of Yale Law School, would go on to become a highly successful lawyer in Washington and counselor to Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton.\", \"Her brother and father, however, quashed her desire to follow them. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want to be a lawyer,\\u201d she recalled her brother telling her, \\u201cyou want to marry a lawyer.\\u201d\", \"She did not pursue a legal career, but what drew her to the law also drew her to advertising. \\u201cShe loved the art of persuasion,\\u201d her daughter said in an interview. \\u201cShe liked weaving an argument that could win somebody over.\\u201d\", \"Out of college, she landed at Reuben Donnelly, a marketing firm, as a contest judge for 80 cents an hour. While there, she learned the basics of advertising.\", \"She recalled judging a contest in which the contestants had to finish this sentence about a fabric brightener: \\u201cI like LaFrance Bluing Flakes because. \\u2026\\u201d The winner wrote, \\u201cI washed a pair of curtains two weeks apart, and they came out the same shade of white.\\u201d That entry won, Ms. Cutler concluded, \\u201cbecause it was concrete and specific and contained a demonstration,\\u201d principles that stuck with her as she climbed the ladder.\", \"She went on to work as a typist at the J. Walter Thompson agency in the late 1940s before being promoted to copywriter. She left to do publicity for Walter Winchell, the nation\\u2019s reigning gossip columnist, then joined McCann Erikson in 1964, deep into the \\u201cMad Men\\u201d era.\", \"\\u201cYes, there were plenty of three-martini lunches,\\u201d she wrote in her memoir. But she worked her way up to creative director on food and pharmaceutical accounts, which were considered a step up from fashion and beauty, where the fictional Peggy Olson was stuck.\", \"When Ms. Cutler was in her 20s, her hair started turning prematurely gray. Clairol, one of her clients, nudged her to color it. But that would have required her to spend three hours every three weeks at the hairdresser \\u2014 too much time, she decided. She stayed gray and eventually lost the Clairol account.\", \"Ms. Cutler did marry a lawyer, Stanley Bernstein, in 1952. Still, she was the primary breadwinner in the family, and they later divorced. She married Theodore J. Israel, an investor, in 2002; he died in 2015.\", \"In addition to Ms. Bernstein, she is survived by two sons, Jon and Seth Bernstein; six grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter. Lloyd Cutler, her brother, died in 2005.\", \"She adored her brother, even if she felt overshadowed by him. She recalled in her memoir being at a reception in Washington, where she was introduced to Katharine Graham, publisher of The Washington Post, as \\u201cLloyd\\u2019s sister.\\u201d At that, Edward N. Ney, chairman of Young & Rubicam, the global marketing agency, stepped in to tell Mrs. Graham, \\u201cIn our world, he\\u2019s Laurel\\u2019s brother.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cLloyd told that story for the rest of his life,\\u201d Ms. Cutler wrote. \\u201cAnd he always said I made more money than he did, which was probably true.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6a5fdb82794d11eca8c07fe6f67ff85e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6a5fdb82794d11eca8c07fe6f67ff85e"}},
