Lawyers working in M\\u0101ori and Te Tiriti o Waitangi law spent nearly twice as much time providing free legal services (on average) as most lawyers.\", \"\\\"Legal aid lawyers who identify as Pacific peoples are also more likely to have done legal aid work in the last 12 months and are working excessive hours; 54 hours a week compared with 50 hours for legal aid lawyers and 47 for all lawyers.\\\"\", \"Other reasons for giving up or reducing legal aid work included the work being high stress and the administrative burden.\", \"The survey also highlighted a difference in the number of approved legal aid providers and those who were taking on cases. Of 482 lawyers approved to do civil legal aid work, only 164 were actively taking on clients.\", \"Covid-19 had made existing issues worse, Epati said. Around 47,000 court cases had been adjourned since the latest lockdown began.\", \"She said the backlog from last year's lockdown was cleared by the goodwill of legal aid lawyers.\", \"\\\"This year, faced with an even bigger backlog and an exhausted, over-stretched legal aid pool, the goodwill of lawyers has been drained dry. It is very unclear how this mountain of work will be tackled, or by whom.\\\"\", \"The legal aid system is supposed to be reviewed every three years.\", \"The last review in 2018 raised several issues, including remuneration.
