They estimate in today's market, the pre-1989 home would command a tidy $449,900.\", \"They wrote: \\\"Beautiful two-story home with basement. Through the arched, front door you are welcomed into the foyer. To the left is a cozy sitting room with a bay window, and to the right, is the dining room that also features a nice bay window. Towards the back of the home, is the living room and kitchen.\", \"\\\"The second storey features four bedrooms! A master bedroom that offers a nice ensuite bathroom. There is also an additional bathroom upstairs. The backyard is surrounded by a wooden picket fence and a low box hedge. Also a patio and a custom treehouse!\\\"\", \"They also pointed out the family home is close to a number of amenities, including Springfield International Airport, the General Hospital, The Wax Museum, Springfield Elementary and the mall.\", \"Garretts' used creator Matt Groening's home state\\u2014Oregon\\u2014as a comparison, looking at a real Springfield in the Beaver State.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926122/screengrab-simpsons.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Screengrab from The Simpsons.

We found a handful of comps that would be a good match and used the same approach when determining how much a home is worth.\\\"\", \"Their comparisons ranged from a three-bed snapped up for $436,000, and a five-bed sold for $400,000.\", \"\\\"Taking the average price per square foot into account ($213) and multiplying by the presumed Simpson home size of 2200 sq/ft, we arrive at the number $449,900. While Homer may be a bumbling fool, he does have an excellent job at the local power plant that likely pays him somewhere between $75,000 and $85,000 per year.\", \"\\\"Also factoring in that they have been in the house since the late 1980s, Homer has some serious equity and likely paid far less for the home than its current value,\\\" they added.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926109/infographic-simpsons-house-price.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Infographic of The Simpsons' house price.
