Do any of you have any ideas on how I could get the monoclonal antibodies sent to me here?\\\" the message added.\", \"\\\"We had somebody looking into it,\\\" Sen. Phil Fortunato told the publication, adding \\\"it's obviously a more complex matter than just sending it through FedEx.\\\"\", \"Regeneron, which has been approved by the FDA to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms, was administered to former President Donald Trump when he got the disease in October 2020.\", \"The Times reported that it was not clear what efforts were being made regarding the lawmaker's request and that it was unclear why Ericksen was visiting El Salvador.\", \"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends against traveling to El Salvador unless fully vaccinated where COVID rates are high.\", \"Ericksen's spokesman Erik Smith told The Bellingham Herald he was not sure if Ericksen had been vaccinated against COVID and that he had not had direct contact with the lawmaker.\", \"\\\"We have been unable to get ahold of Sen. Ericksen but we believe (the message) to be true,\\\" Smith said.\", \"Ericksen sponsored a bill to protect the rights of those who refuse a COVID-19 vaccine which never got a hearing in the Democratic-controlled Legislature.\", \"He has also been critical of state measures limiting the spread of the virus including social distancing and masking.\", \"In October, the Freedom Caucus which along with Fortunato, Ericksen is a part of, called on Inslee to resign after state workers lost their jobs for not complying with the governor's vaccine mandate.\", \"In a statement, the caucus said Inslee, \\\"has used COVID emergency powers to establish autocratic rule.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931956/washington-state-capitol.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Washington State Capitol in Olympia.
