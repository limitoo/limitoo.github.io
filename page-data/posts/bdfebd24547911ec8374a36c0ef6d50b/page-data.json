Kathy Hochul said this week. At the same time, tens of thousands of health care workers have left their health care jobs, for reasons ranging from pandemic burnout to a refusal to get vaccinated in spite of the state\\u2019s strict mandate for health care workers, and some systems have posted hundreds of available job openings.\", \"The result has been a decrease in upstate hospital capacity of about 10 percent. And a perfect storm of high patient volumes, reduced staff and an inability to discharge patients to nursing homes \\u2014 which are themselves full \\u2014 has begun to overwhelm some facilities, particularly in Western New York, the Finger Lakes region and a swath of the state north of Albany, hospital executives said.\", \"With Omicron now detected in New York City and on Long Island and the variant expected to spread, and few hospital beds upstate available for patients if Covid hospitalizations spike even higher, Ms. Hochul has declared a state of emergency.\", \"On Wednesday, she announced that 120 National Guard troops would be deployed to back up nursing home staffs around the state. The governor\\u2019s office has so far announced nine facilities \\u2014 nursing homes in Rochester, Buffalo, on Long Island and elsewhere \\u2014 where soldiers will work. More locations will be announced soon.\", \"The governor also said that all hospitals at over 90 percent capacity may be ordered to stop elective surgeries to deal with the surge. There were 56 hospitals in that category on Friday, including 10 in New York City, some of which had already taken that step.\", \"\\u201cHospitalizations are up, get this number, 150 percent upstate versus downstate,\\u201d Ms. Hochul said on Monday, of the rise in Covid hospitalizations since August. \\u201cNot that I\\u2019m trying to create an upstate-downstate divide in our state,\\u201d she added, \\u201cbut these are the numbers we\\u2019re seeing and they\\u2019re very troubling.\\u201d\", \"At Glens Falls Hospital in Warren County, about an hour north of Albany, patient volumes are at their highest since the start of the pandemic. About one-quarter of the beds are filled with Covid patients, the rest with patients with other ailments, including some who could typically be released to nursing homes but cannot be because of a lack of beds.\", \"Covid-19 is widespread in Warren County, where there are 93 cases per 100,000 residents, about 5 times the rate in New York City. The virus test positivity rate is 12 percent, compared to 2 percent in New York City.\", \"Yet masking in local stores in Glens Falls appeared uncommon, even as urgent care centers and hospitals fill with patients seeking tests and appointments. The county\\u2019s vaccination rate for all residents is 72 percent, which is actually above the state average of 69 percent, but a combination of relaxed precautions, waning immunity and the increased infectiousness of Delta is propelling cases there, as elsewhere.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s so bad in this area,\\u201d said Dr. Jeremy Di Bari, a family physician who works at Glens Falls Hospital and two local urgent care centers, and who himself currently has Covid, despite being fully vaccinated. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s going to get better. I hope it won\\u2019t get much worse.\\u201d\", \"Erie County, which encompasses Buffalo, has seen one of the state\\u2019s steepest rises in hospitalizations in recent weeks. The Erie County Medical Center is completely full, with patients waiting in the emergency room to be admitted. At the same time, there are 500 job openings at the hospital, which has a current work force of about 3,600, hospital executives said.\", \"In the same pattern as in Glens Falls, there are patients \\u2014 52 of them \\u2014 who could be discharged if there were only nursing homes or group homes that had space for them. While the hospital is not turning away people seeking care, between 10 and 20 percent of people coming to the emergency room are walking out without being seen because wait times are so long, officials said.\", \"\\u201cThe convergence of issues is the worst I\\u2019ve ever seen it,\\u201d said Tom Quatroche, the medical center\\u2019s chief executive officer. \\u201cWe had these high volumes previously, but we could discharge them to other settings, and we had the staff to handle the volume. We are finding ourselves in a situation where the lack of staffing in the broader community, and in the hospital, is just creating a perfect storm.\\u201d\", \"Marty Boryszak, senior vice president for acute care at Catholic Health, which operates five hospitals and a number of outpatient and in-patient treatment centers in Erie County and settled a contract last month after 2,500 workers went on strike. He said hospitals in Buffalo were reaching a critical stage. \\u201cWe\\u2019re knocking on 100 percent, and it\\u2019s not over,\\u201d he said.\", \"The state estimates that 33,000 health care workers, or just 3 percent of New York\\u2019s overall health care work force, left their jobs because of the vaccine mandate, which does not allow for testing in lieu of vaccination or religious exemptions. But because the sector as a whole was already short staffed, the additional job losses have hit hard. Ms. Hochul is being cautious about imposing additional mandates in other areas in light of the experience, she said Thursday at a news conference.\", \"At F.F. Thompson Hospital, a rural hospital on the shores of Lake Canandaigua in the Finger Lakes, 15 people stayed overnight in the emergency room one night this week because there were no regular beds available, said Michael Stapleton, the hospital\\u2019s chief executive officer. As of earlier this week, less than one-quarter of the hospital\\u2019s 115 patients had Covid, but it was enough to overstress an already taxed facility.\", \"For weeks, the hospital had been trying to discharge 17 stable patients to nursing homes, but could not find any space. One patient was recently transported by ambulance 300 miles to a nursing home bed in New York City, Mr. Stapleton said, the closest facility that had an opening. The patient, who had several chronic conditions, had been at the hospital for three months.\", \"About 150 staff members left rather than comply with the state\\u2019s vaccine mandate, including people with decades of institutional knowledge, Mr. Stapleton said. Things got so bad that the week before Thanksgiving, the hospital diverted ambulances for two days to other hospitals just to relieve some of the pressure.\", \"\\u201cThis is status quo now,\\u201d Mr. Stapleton said. \\u201cThis is what we are dealing with. It is just an incredible number of patients.\\u201d\", \"Kathy Parrinello, the chief executive officer of UR Medicine, the University of Rochester\\u2019s affiliated health care system, said that all six of the system\\u2019s hospitals in the Finger Lakes region, including F.F. Thompson, are operating above their licensed capacity.\", \"Fewer staff members are working now than this time last year, because of hundreds of unfilled openings, but patient volumes are higher. Those who are working, Ms. Parrinello said, are feeling \\u201ca combination of exhaustion and \\u2018I can\\u2019t believe we are here again.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"In Syracuse, Upstate University Hospital recently closed nearly 20 percent of its beds and stopped doing elective surgeries because it has about 400 vacant nursing positions, a spokesman said. More than 100 staff members left rather than comply with the vaccine mandate.\", \"\\u201cThe most pressing issue for Upstate at this time is staffing,\\u201d said Darryl Geddes, the spokesman. The hospital has raised overtime pay and is \\u201cpursuing aggressive advertising for new staff\\u201d in an effort to find more people to work.\", \"Several counties have declared states of emergency, including Ulster County in the Hudson Valley and Wyoming County in Western New York, as virus cases have risen.\", \"But except for Erie County, which has reinstituted a mask mandate for indoor public places, regardless of vaccination status, no local counties seem to have instituted additional virus-related restrictions for the public.\", \"New York City remains the only jurisdiction in the state that requires people to have received at least one vaccine dose to visit indoor bars and restaurants.\", \"Ms. Hochul has so far resisted any new statewide restrictions, saying it is up to local officials to set them.\", \"The contrast between the brewing crisis inside hospitals and the relatively regular pace of life outside them can be stark. In Buffalo, the resurgence of cases didn\\u2019t appear to slow down post-Black Friday shopping at busy malls, though most shoppers did appear to be complying with the new mask mandate.\", \"And at the Aviation Mall in Glens Falls on Wednesday, where the state just opened a new testing and vaccination center, few shoppers wore masks inside stores.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s hard to ignore what\\u2019s going on with cases, but the social resolve of the population to continue the good fight with mitigation measures is a bit broken,\\u201d said Dr. Thomas A. Russo, the chief of infectious disease at the Jacobs School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences at the University at Buffalo.\", \"Concerned about the lack of urgency among the public, some medical workers have taken to trying to warn people directly.\", \"\\u201cLet me be blunt,\\u201d Dr. Howard Fritz, the chief medical officer at Glens Falls Hospital, wrote in a press release issued by area doctors just before Thanksgiving. \\u201cIf you are not vaccinated, get the vaccine immediately.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cYour life, your loved one\\u2019s lives, and those of your friends and neighbors depend on it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"bdfebd24547911ec8374a36c0ef6d50b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bdfebd24547911ec8374a36c0ef6d50b"}},
