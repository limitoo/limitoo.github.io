He also said that Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and himself want civilians \\\"if they can and if they qualify, to get the booster.\\\"\", \"Around 96.4 percent of all active-duty military are at least partially vaccinated. This percentage includes members of the National Guard and Reserves. Around 74 percent of the military force is fully vaccinated. Although the full inoculation period has already passed for some branches, the Army Guard still has until June to get fully vaccinated. There are no current plans to adjust this deadline.\", \"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended fully-vaccinated adults receive a booster shot against COVID-19. This recommendation received further attention after the Omicron variant of the coronavirus was detected in the U.S.\", \"Around 257,000 military members have contracted COVID-19, with 79 members dying from the virus.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949659/fort-drum.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">U.S. Army soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division arrive home from a 9-month deployment in Afghanistan on Dec. 8, 2020 in Fort Drum, New York.</div>\", \"The defense department in August announced that it would begin requiring all members of the military \\u2014 including National Guard and Reserves \\u2014 to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
