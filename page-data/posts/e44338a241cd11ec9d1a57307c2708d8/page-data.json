If you get a drought, or you get a flood or you have some sort of pest for the most part, you can adapt, you can get through the year.\", \"\\\"But I think what we do is we get locked into that sort of incremental coping with sort of year to year climate variability but we need to look ahead to what will be coming. And what can we do now in order to be prepared when the changes do arrive, you know, things like changing land use, or creating new opportunities to diversify.\\\"\", \"Cradock-Henry said those examples do not happen overnight and involve significant capital investment but there are smaller things that can be done immediately.\", \"\\\"If you're farming in a dry land region, there's been a lot of interest over the last number of years, for instance, with planting things like lucerne, which are much more tolerant of dry conditions than ryegrass and clover.\", \"\\\"If you're in viticulture, you might look at shifting pruning practices. So with warmer temperatures, increased variability, changing the timing of pruning can reduce your risk to getting exposed to unseasonable floods or frosts.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"e44338a241cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e44338a241cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
