Lori Daybell is also charged in Arizona with conspiring to kill her former estranged husband, Charles Vallow, with the help of her now-deceased brother, Alex Cox.\", \"Chad Daybell pleaded not guilty to the charges months ago, but the case against Lori Daybell was stalled after a judge found her mentally incompetent to aid in her own defense and ordered her to undergo treatment at a mental health facility. Last week, the judge said Daybell had been made competent and the case could go forward.\", \"Lori Daybell kept her head down as she entered the courtroom and spoke quietly during her arraignment on Tuesday. The courtroom was mostly full, with JJ Vallow's grandparents, Kay and Larry Woodcock, seated in one of the front rows. The Woodcocks wiped away tears as 7th District Judge Steven Boyce read the murder charge related to the young boy's death.\", \"Lori Daybell, wearing a light blue blouse and glasses, opted to stand silent when she was asked to enter a plea to the charges. Boyce, who told her she could face the death penalty or life in prison if convicted, entered a not guilty plea on her behalf.\", \"Investigators say Chad and Lori Daybell began espousing an unusual, doomsday-focused system of religious belief involving \\\"zombies,\\\" teleportation and communication with other spiritual realms starting in 2018, when both were still married to other people. The Idaho prosecutors say they used their religious beliefs to justify or encourage the murders.\", \"Lori Daybell's brother Alex Cox shot and killed her estranged husband, Charles Vallow, in suburban Phoenix, according to an indictment in Arizona. At the time, Charles Vallow was seeking a divorce, and wrote in court filings that his wife believed she had become a god-like figure responsible for ushering in the biblical apocalypse.\", \"Cox told police the shooting was in self-defense, and he was never charged. He later died of an apparent blood clot in his lung.\", \"Shortly after Charles Vallow's death, Lori Daybell \\u2014 who then had the last name Vallow \\u2014 and her children moved to the rural eastern Idaho community of Rexburg, near where Chad Daybell lived. At the time, Chad Daybell was married to Tammy Daybell. She died in October 2019.\", \"Though Tammy Daybell's obituary said her death was from natural causes, authorities grew suspicious when Chad and Lori Daybell married just two weeks later. Investigators had Tammy Daybell's body exhumed for an autopsy, though authorities have not formally released her cause of death.\", \"Police began searching for Lori Daybell's youngest two children a few weeks later in November 2019 after relatives raised concerns. The Daybells quickly left town, and they were found months later in Hawaii without the children.\", \"The children's bodies were eventually found buried in Chad Daybell's yard back in Idaho.\"]","href_hash":"62c5ae70c02311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"62c5ae70c02311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
