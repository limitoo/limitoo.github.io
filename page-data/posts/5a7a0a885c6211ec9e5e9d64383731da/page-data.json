The storms were part of an intense weather system that experts said was highly unusual to happen so late in the season. \", \"Search and rescue missions are still being conducted to determine if more people if there are more survivors; so far, at least 64 people have died in Kentucky. That makes the weather event the deadliest one-day period in December for tornadoes since records were first kept in 1950.\", \"Additionally, more than 100 tornado warnings were issued on Friday before midnight, breaking records as the most tornado warnings ever recorded on a single day in December, according to CNN.\", \"Researchers are also still working to determine if one tornado that wreaked havoc across Arkansas, Missouri, Tennessee and Kentucky touched down for more than 230 miles, which would make it the longest continuous tornado in U.S. history. Currently, the record for the longest single-track tornado occurred in 1925 and it touched the ground for 219 miles.\", \"On Sunday, Federal Emergency Management Agency Administrator Deanne Criswell said that the weather event was \\\"incredibly unusual.\\\" Tornado events are not unheard of for that part of the country, but experts have noted that such a powerful storm system in December is not typical.\", \"\\\"We do see tornadoes in December, that part is not unusual, but at this magnitude, I don't think we've seen one this late in the year. But it's also historic. Even this, the severity and the amount of time this tornado, or these tornadoes, spent on the ground is unprecedented,\\\" she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950818/tornado-kentucky.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">This was the deadliest one-day period in December for tornadoes since records were first kept in 1950.

If the final death toll ends up above 90, it will become one of the top 10 deadliest days for tornadoes in more than 70 years, CNN reported.\", \"Preliminary reports have so far found that several of the tornadoes were likely in the strongest or most violent categories of the Enhanced Fujita Scale, which is used to measure the scale of a twister. Since 1950, there have been only 21 tornadoes in the U.S. that were considered \\\"violent\\\" during the month of December, according to NBC.\", \"\\\"This has been the most devastating tornado event in our state's history. What it has done here is indescribable. The level of devastation is unlike anything I've ever seen,\\\" Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said on Saturday.\"]","href_hash":"5a7a0a885c6211ec9e5e9d64383731da"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5a7a0a885c6211ec9e5e9d64383731da"}},
