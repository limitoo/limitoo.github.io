Carbone died at the scene and Pittman was later declared dead at a hospital.\", \"Authorities said Pittman, Reese and another employee, Pourdeye Kegbeh, had been in an argument on the factory floor prior to the shooting. Management ordered Reese to leave, but he returned shortly after and confronted Pittman, Kegbeh said.\", \"Kegbeh told police that Reese pulled out a handgun and shot Pittman numerous times before he turned and fired multiple shots at Carbone.\", \"According to Valley News Live, several sources said Reese was fired Wednesday morning, just hours before he opened fire.\", \"Reese has prior convictions and is registered as a sex offender until 2029. On the North Dakota Sex Offender Registry, Reese's employer is listed as 401 27th Street North, which is the same address as the homicide.

Reese told officers that he had ditched the gun in a residential neighborhood, and investigators later found the 9mm semi-automatic pistol. Detectives also recovered multiple 9mm cartridge casings at the crime scene.\", \"In 2014, Reese was convicted of third-degree criminal sexual conduct in Benton County, Minnesota.
