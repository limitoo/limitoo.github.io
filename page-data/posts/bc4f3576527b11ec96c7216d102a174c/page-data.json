But one lucky player in Texas matched the five white balls, which earned them the second prize, valued at $1 million. Their second prize winning would have been worth $2 million had the winner purchased the Megaplier for an extra $1.\", \"Eighteen players correctly matched four white balls plus the Mega Ball, winning them each $10,000. Five of them opted for the Megaplier, doubling their third prize to $20,000.\", \"There were 341 ticket holders who matched four of the five white balls, but not the Mega Ball, each earning $500, with 63 of them each bagging the Megaplier prize of $1,000.\", \"A group of 810 players matched three white balls, each winning $200, with 185 of them each obtaining the Megaplier prize of $400.\", \"The next Mega Millions drawing will be on Friday, December 3, at 11 p.m. ET, for a jackpot prize of $112 million, with a cash-value option of $81.5 million.\", \"Last Friday's game also saw no grand prize winner.

Five white balls are drawn from a set of balls numbered 1 through 70, while one yellow Mega Ball is drawn from balls numbered 1 through 25. You win if the numbers on your lottery ticket match the numbers of the balls drawn on that date.\", \"Mega Millions tickets cost $2 per play. If no one wins the jackpot prize, the money is added to the top prize for the following drawing.\", \"Most states offer a Megaplier option, which costs an additional $1 per play and increases non-jackpot prizes by two, three, four or five times. Before each Mega Millions drawing on Tuesdays and Fridays, the Megaplier is drawn from a pool of 15 balls. Five of these balls are marked with 2X, six with 3X, three with 4X and one with 5X.\", \"The odds of winning with a $2 Mega Millions ticket are one in 303 million.
