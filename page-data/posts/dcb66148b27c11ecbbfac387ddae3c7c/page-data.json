In a few weeks, his son turns 18 and will join him in the fight \\u2014 Russian brutality serving only to strengthen their resolve.   \", \"Ukraine and its allies warned that the Kremlin is not de-escalating to promote trust at the bargaining table, as it claimed, but instead resupplying and shifting its troops to the country's east. Those movements appear to be preparation for an intensified assault on the mostly Russian-speaking Donbas region in the country's east, which includes the city of Mariupol.\", \"There are still more than 150,000 residents left inside that city \\u2014 unable or unwilling to leave as Russian tanks continue to pound what's left of it. On Saturday, another Red Cross convoy will attempt to evacuate more residents from the city, which has been under siege for five weeks.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"dcb66148b27c11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dcb66148b27c11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
