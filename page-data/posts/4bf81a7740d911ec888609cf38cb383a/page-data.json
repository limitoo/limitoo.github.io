Grosskreutz said he approached the teenager with his arms raised and had no intention of shooting him.\", \"\\\"That's not the kind of person that I am. That's not why I was out there. It's not who I am. And definitely not somebody I would want to become,\\\" he said according to the AP.\", \"Grosskreutz also testified he thought he was going to die that night. Rittenhouse defense attorney Corey Chirafisi later asked if his client only shot at Grosskreutz once he pointed a gun at Rittenhouse. Grosskreutz said that was correct, but that he never intended to point his pistol at the teenager.\", \"The defense also presented a photo showing Grosskreutz pointing the gun at Rittenhouse, who was on the ground with his rifle pointed up at Grosskreutz.\", \"Prosecutors are arguing in the trial that Rittenhouse was the instigator of all the violence from the night, meanwhile then teenager's lawyers are saying he only acted in self-defense due to threats to his life.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928428/grosskreutz-rittenhouse-trial.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Gaige Grosskreutz talks about the permanent injuries to his right arm and hand as he testifies about being shot, during the Kyle Rittenhouse trial at the Kenosha County Courthouse in Kenosha, Wis., on Monday, Nov. 8, 2021.

I'm for people's right to carry and bear arms,\\\" he said, explaining why he was armed. \\\"And that night was no different than any other day.
