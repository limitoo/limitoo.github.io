The worker was wearing gloves and a face mask at the time, and nobody was exposed to the contents of the vials, according to the agency.\", \"\\\"The freezer facility was immediately secured and staff followed standard protocols for notifying CDC of such a potential discovery. The vials were sent securely to CDC for testing on November 18 to determine what they contained,\\\" the CDC said in a statement.\", \"Upon investigation, health officials were able to determine that the vials \\\"contain no trace of virus known to cause smallpox.\\\" The vaccinia virus that was detected inside the vials is used to produce smallpox vaccine and is the origin of the word \\\"vaccine,\\\" CNN reported.\", \"The CDC said that it \\\"is in close contact with state and local health officials, law enforcement, and the World Health Organization about these findings.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1936425/vials-do-not-contain-smallpox.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Frozen vials labeled as \\u201cSmallpox\\u201d that were found in a Pennsylvania vaccine research facility\\u2019s freezer did not contain the virus that causes smallpox infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday.
