Critics of the current Belarusian government, led by President Alexander Lukashenko, have compared it to North Korea.\", \"\\\"The authorities are continuing to destroy Belarus' independent media, calling everyone extremist,\\\" said Belarusian Association of Journalists head Andrei Bastunets. \\\"The situation in Belarus is worse than in Cuba or Iran and is getting close to North Korean standards.\\\"\", \"Nasha Niva, despite being mentioned as part of Belarus's national heritage in school textbooks, covered anti-government protests in the country in 2020 after Lukashenko was given a sixth term in office. Critics, both in Belarus and the West, alleged that the August 2020 election was rigged in his favor. During the protests, more than 35,000 people were arrested.\", \"This ban was the latest move against the newspaper from the Belarusian government. Authorities had blocked its online newspaper from updating in July, arresting its chief editor Yahor Martsinovich and journalist Andrei Skurko. The two, along with 27 other Belarusian journalists including blogger Roman Protasevich, remain in custody.\", \"Despite the bans, Nasha Niva is currently being kept alive by former employees. The majority have fled the country and continue to update the website with news. They are able to bypass the blocking by regularly changing its domain.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939141/belarus-pre.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">On its 115 anniversary, The Nasha Niva was banned from publication by the Belarus government.
