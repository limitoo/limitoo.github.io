We want them to take a proactive approach themselves in ensuring gender equality rather than waiting for courts to intervene,\\\" the Supreme Court said.\", \"In August, the court had criticised the government of having a \\\"regressive mindset\\\" for not allowing women to sit for NDA examinations. \\\"It is a policy decision which is based in gender discrimination,\\\" the court had said.\", \"Women at the moment are inducted into the army through the Short Service Commission (SSC) and don't qualify for a permanent commission - which allows an officer to serve a full tenure.\", \"So women are initially meant to serve for five years, but have the option of extending their tenure.

They have treated soldiers on battlefields, handled explosives, detected and removed mines, and laid communication lines.\", \"Experts say women have ended up doing almost everything except combat roles: they are still not allowed to serve in infantry and the armoured corps. \", \"In 2019 the government agreed to give permanent commissions to women but said this would only apply to those officers who had served less than 14 years, citing physical limitations of older women officers.\"]","href_hash":"ed529ffc109311eca195020017029e60"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ed529ffc109311eca195020017029e60"}},
