These assignments will be handed out along with those to students who are currently working and did not choose to strike.\", \"However, any striking students who do not return by December 10 could potentially lose their positions, according to the email. These workers will receive a job assignment only if there is a vacancy.\", \"\\\"Please note that striking student officers who return to work after December 10, 2021 will be appointed/assigned to suitable positions if available,\\\" the email read.\", \"The 3,000 striking workers at Columbia have been on a work stoppage for approximately the last five weeks. The picket line began in protest of reported low wages and a lack of support by the school towards the workers on campus.\", \"The protesters have also filed a pair of unfair labor practice (ULP) charges against the university as a result of the conditions.\", \"The workers had previously gone on strike in March, with the picket lasting over one month.
