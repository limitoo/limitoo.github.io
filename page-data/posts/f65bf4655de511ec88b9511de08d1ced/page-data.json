plague originally exploded after the winter crop harvest in the late spring of 2020 because mice had an abundance of feed due to the grain left on the ground after crops were stripped.\", \"\\\"The\\u00a0wet weather has led to a lot of crop being laid over on the ground and that makes it really hard to pick up,\\\" Mr Henry said.\", \"\\\"When farmers have an opportunity to harvest crops that are still standing, they're\\u00a0working really hard to get that crop off.\", \"\\\"The potential is that they'll leave a lot of grain behind for mice for food.\", \"\\\"So through the summer, we're saying while it's good that there aren't very many mice there now, we need to keep looking and make sure that they're not building up again through the summer, and be prepared to bait
