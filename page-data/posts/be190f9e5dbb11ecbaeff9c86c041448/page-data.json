The stage set is usually round, as if to represent the planet on which we\\u2019re all stuck, and the performers gravitate to circular motion. They whirl and tumble in wheeling patterns. They spin while suspended in the air. Most distinctively, beginnings and endings \\u2014 of movements, of sections \\u2014 roll together in a vision of continual metamorphosis, a vision that presents change as both natural and beautiful.\", \"Such a vision was what the company\\u2019s director and choreographer, Fanny Soriano, intended 10 years ago, when she first conceived of \\u201cFractales,\\u201d the work that Libertivore is bringing to Peak Performances at Montclair State University for the troupe\\u2019s United States debut, Thursday through Sunday. She was finishing a solo, \\u201cH\\u00eatre\\u201d (\\u201cBeech\\u201d), centered on a hanging beech-tree branch, and she was starting to make another solo, \\u201cFractales,\\u201d meant to show her children how change can be positive. But then her own body began to alter.\", \"First her back and left shoulder froze up. \\u201cIn circus, you\\u2019re always working with pain, so it was normal to continue,\\u201d Soriano, 43, said in a video call from her home in Aubagne, in the south of France. She couldn\\u2019t hang from her left arm, so she did everything with her right one \\u2014 until that became too painful. One knee stopped bending, then the other. \\u201cIt got to the point where I couldn\\u2019t do anything.\\u201d\", \"For months, she tried physical therapy, but the pain kept spreading to new places on her body. It took a year and half to get a clear diagnosis: ankylosing spondylitis, an inflammatory arthritis affecting the spine and joints.\", \"\\u201cI thought I was going to be able to get back to performing, but it never happened,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI had to give up on my acrobatic career, the only thing I knew how to do, the only thing I wanted to do. I felt trapped in my own body.\\u201d\", \"Although she finished \\u201cH\\u00eatre,\\u201d she was never able to perform it. And as for \\u201cFractales,\\u201d the idea of positive change now seemed like a lie. She burned her notebook and abandoned the project.\", \"What brought her back to it was a realization of what had attracted her to circus in the first place. As a shy 10-year-old who had trouble fitting in, she said, she became obsessed with circus because circus camp was where she felt free: \\u201cThere was no competition, and everyone had a place. In circus, everyone is attentive to each other because we put our lives in each other\\u2019s hands.\\u201d\", \"At 15, she enrolled in the French national circus school, the Centre National des Arts du Cirque. But there, too, she didn\\u2019t quite fit in.\", \"\\u201cI was kind of the black sheep,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019m not an amazing acrobat. When they allowed me to improvise and invent alone with a partner, it was much easier because then I felt my soul could be involved. I love technique, but I need my soul to be involved.\\u201d\", \"While most teachers found fault with her, a guest teacher, Francis Viet, who was a member of Pina Bausch\\u2019s company, Tanztheater Wuppertal, told her that the simple things she was doing were beautiful \\u2014 that they were a kind of dance theater. \\u201cAnd that made a switch in how I saw myself and how my teachers saw me,\\u201d Soriano said. She was the only person in her class to be awarded the highest honors: \\u201cIt was such revenge.\\u201d\", \"After graduation, she worked with many circus companies, big and small. In 2005, she founded Libertivore with her life partner, Jules Beckman. \\u201cBut it was too much for us to be a couple and have two small children and also work together,\\u201d she said. So Beckman started his own troupe, Transminuko, and Soriano continued with Libertivore, concentrating on a poetic exploration of the natural world and a hypnotic, dance-like flow.\", \"That was the path that led to the creation of \\u201cH\\u00eatre\\u201d and her positive view of big changes, the path that her condition seemed to block. \\u201cI felt like someone cut my wings,\\u201d she said.\", \"The way forward was putting her life in the hands of other people, creating what she called the \\u201cmini-society\\u201d of the circus onstage. First, in 2015, she allowed someone else to perform \\u201cH\\u00eatre\\u201d: the aerialist Kamma Rosenbeck. \\u201cTo replace me, I needed someone that I love,\\u201d Soriano said.\", \"Then Soriano began working on a duet with the French circus artist Vincent Briere and the Cambodian-born acrobat Voleak Ung. Briere is nearly twice as tall as Ung, and in \\u201cPhasmes\\u201d (\\u201cStick Insects\\u201d), they roll amid dry leaves, insectlike, her body nested in his. She climbs him as one might climb a tree, and she even does a handstand atop one of his arms raised high. But he also climbs on her, and the focus is never on acrobatic feats for their own sake.\", \"\\u201cThey have personalities,\\u201d Soriano said, \\u201cand I want to show people the beautiful things I see about them. I don\\u2019t want them to disappear behind the choreography or technique. I want people to see them, to feel their souls.\\u201d\", \"This, she decided, was what was missing from her original conception of \\u201cFractales.\\u201d She said, \\u201cI had this idea of change, of being part of the landscape, but in a landscape there are usually other human beings.\\u201d\", \"So she revisited \\u201cFractales\\u201d as an ensemble piece, with L\\u00e9o Manipoud and Nina Harper joining Rosenbeck, Briere and Ung, all artists whose \\u201csouls are involved.\\u201d In a sense, the work is a continuation or combination of \\u201cH\\u00eatre\\u201d and \\u201cPhasmes.\\u201d As in \\u201cH\\u00eatre,\\u201d the performers hang in the air, here from the roots of a tree suspended above the stage. As in \\u201cPhasmes,\\u201d they climb one another and tumble together.\", \"\\u201cH\\u00eatre\\u201d and \\u201cPhasmes\\u201d work as a diptych, and Libertivore was scheduled to perform them that way at PS21 in Chatham, N.Y., on Dec. 21 and 22. But because Ung contracted the coronavirus, \\u201cPhasmes\\u201d will be replaced by another work, as yet unannounced. (Emily Zuckerman will replace Ung in \\u201cFractacles.\\u201d)\", \"\\u201cNouveau cirque like this is where innovation is happening,\\u201d said PS21\\u2019s executive director, Elena Siyanko. \\u201cFanny is among the most sophisticated in her blend of concept and choreography.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cFractales\\u201d takes that blending further, introducing a darkness that feels hard-earned: Someone is buried, the tumbling becomes a tug of war, there\\u2019s a strong suggestion of ecological catastrophe. But the overall impression is still of perpetual transformation, and of change as creative and beautiful.\", \"For Soriano, discovering the beauty even in ugly or frightening things is an act of resistance, of hope against despair. \\u201cI know that it can be hard to see the beauty in something,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI know because of what happened to me.\\u201d For the same reason, she knows why it\\u2019s necessary.\"]","href_hash":"be190f9e5dbb11ecbaeff9c86c041448"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"be190f9e5dbb11ecbaeff9c86c041448"}},
