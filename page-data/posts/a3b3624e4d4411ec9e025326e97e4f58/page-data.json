Without the adjustments, claims increased by more than 18,000 to almost 259,000.\", \"Unemployment claims and applications reflect layoffs, which became much more common when the pandemic hit. The four-week average of claims decreased by 21,000 to a little over 252,000, the lowest rate since mid-March of last year.\", \"Applications have fallen steadily since they surpassed 900,000 in early January, and they now are even lower than the average level of 220,000 a week from before the pandemic, according to AP.

Including the federal programs, the number of Americans receiving some form of jobless aid peaked at more than 33 million in June of 2020.\", \"The job market has staged a remarkable comeback since the spring of 2020 when the coronavirus pandemic forced businesses to close or cut hours and kept many Americans at home as a health precaution. In March and April last year, employers slashed more than 22 million jobs.\", \"But government relief checks, super-low interest rates and the rollout of vaccines combined to give consumers the confidence and financial wherewithal to start spending again. Employers, scrambling to meet an unexpected surge in demand, have made 18 million new hires since April of 2020 and are expected to add another 575,000 this month. Still, the United States remains 4 million short of the jobs it had in February of 2020.\", \"Companies now complain that they can't find workers to fill job openings, a near-record 10.4 million in September.
