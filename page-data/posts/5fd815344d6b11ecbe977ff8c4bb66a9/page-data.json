Canada is the first country to fully authorize the Johnson & Johnson shot.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Today marks the first major regulatory approval for the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine and an important moment to recognize the dedication of everyone involved in our COVID-19 vaccine development, our partners, the regulators and clinical study participants,\\\" Johnson & Johnson's vice chairman of the executive committee and chief scientific officer Paul Stoffels, M.D. said in a statement.\\u00a0\", \"Health Canada granted the company's vaccine full authorization after initial data from a clinical study showed that it was 85% effective in preventing severe disease, and, starting 28 days after vaccination, it provides protection against hospitalization and death due to COVID-19. The data also revealed that protection against COVID-19 increases when a booster shot of Johnson & Johnson's vaccine is administered and that booster shots are safe and generally well-tolerated. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"Our decisions are based only on scientific and medical evidence showing that vaccines are safe and effective.\\\" Health Canada writes on its vaccine webpage. \\\"The benefits must also outweigh any risks.\\\"\", \"In March, Canada granted emergency use authorization for the Johnson & Johnson shot under an interim order.
