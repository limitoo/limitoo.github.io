The video, posted by user @mikeyp93 on TikTok, has received over 740,000 views since it was posted on Monday.\", \"While it is unclear what occurred before the video started, the footage shows a security guard telling a girl not to come in. After what looked like her picking her foot up to climb over the rope, the security guard took his entire body and forced the woman down to the pavement.\", \"\\\"Level two bar & rooftop in downtown Detroit, security man handling females! Reposting this till something happens! Absolutely disgusting,\\\" the caption of the video read.\", \"In the video, the security guard could be heard telling the woman to \\\"go\\\" while she lay on the pavement.\", \"In the comments, @mikeyp93 said that the woman did not kick the security guard, her foot was up because she was attempting to step over the rope to get back in line. He also claimed the woman was not talking \\\"sh*t\\\" to the security guards but that it was the lady behind her.\", \"Others in the comments, though, said it did look like the woman kicked the security guard. Others said the woman was being \\\"openly belligerent\\\" and looked like she was going to come at the guard and that he handled the situation \\\"perfectly.\\\"\", \"\\\"Don't blame him one bit,\\\" one user commented.\", \"\\\"As a former bouncer, he is in the right,\\\" another user wrote. \\\"Literally his job is to be the 'law & order' for said place.\\\"\", \"But some users thought the altercation went way too far and that the security guard should not have laid his hands on the woman.\", \"\\\"He had no reason to touch her so aggressively,\\\" a user commented. \\\"That's not his job.\\\"\", \"According to writers at Bevspot, the most common reason people get kicked out of bars, besides closing time, is harassment of another customer or guest. People who are overly intoxicated only made up for about 12 percent of people who were kicked out of bars, Bevspot reported.\", \"Bevspot also recommended that when kicking people out of a bar, a person with high authority should do so in order to avoid triggering an emotional response.\", \"They also said it's a good idea to gather all employees together after kicking someone out to explain what happened and how to better deal with the situation in the future.\", \"People in the comments of the now-viral video were debating whether or not the security guard's actions were altogether inappropriate or if it was just part of his job. While it is unclear what happened before the video started to be recorded, a lot of people were supporting the security guard.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1917461/tiktok-logo-phone-screen.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A viral video shows the moment a security guard at a bar threw a woman to the pavement after she attempted to enter. People in the comments are divided as to if the security guard is in the right or wrong. </div>\", \"Many users in the comments said the security guard was just using self defense and others said he was just doing his job. But on the other side, many people claimed this was a prime example of assault and people taking advantage of their authority.\", \"\\\"No one owns the walkways outside clubs or bars on a streetfront except the city,\\\" one user said. \\\"Security is in the wrong. That is assault.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"2ee0d39c43f611ec9b1c6920cbb7425e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2ee0d39c43f611ec9b1c6920cbb7425e"}},
