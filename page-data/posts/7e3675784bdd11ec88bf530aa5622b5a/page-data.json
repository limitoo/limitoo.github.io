It is the first lockdown of its kind in Europe this winter and comes after months of struggles to limit cases through widespread testing and partial restrictions. Austria has also announced that vaccination will be compulsory as of Feb. 1, the first Western country to take that step.\", \"Germany has said it is not ruling out a lockdown, with officials calling it the worst Covid wave yet. Chancellor Angela Merkel said vaccinations alone were not enough, according to Bloomberg.\", \"Other countries, including Slovakia and Greece, were imposing restrictions on unvaccinated populations.\", \"Opposition: Protests erupted in Austria, the Netherlands, Belgium, Denmark, Italy, Switzerland and Croatia over the weekend against official crackdowns and vaccine requirements. The crowd in Vienna numbered 40,000, officials said.\", \"Data: Austria, where 66 percent of the population is vaccinated, reported more than 14,000 new cases within 24 hours on Sunday. Over the past week, the Netherlands has been averaging more than 20,000 cases. Germany has reported roughly double that number of infections.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"At 35, Peng Shuai is one of her country\\u2019s most recognized athletes, a doubles champion at Wimbledon and the French Open. State news outlets once hailed her as \\u201cour Chinese princess,\\u201d but she fought the state for control of her career \\u2014 and won.\", \"If anyone were able to break through the country\\u2019s icy resistance to #MeToo allegations, it would be someone like her. But she has been silenced by Beijing, and support for her online has been censored since she accused a former vice premier of sexual assault.\", \"Over the weekend, the state\\u2019s propaganda apparatus produced a series of photographs and videos purporting to show Peng carrying on as if nothing had happened. And she appeared in a video call with the head of the International Olympic Committee.\", \"But the rights group Amnesty International said the I.O.C. should be \\u201cextremely careful not to participate in any whitewash of possible human rights violations.\\u201d A #WhereisPengShuai campaign has taken root, and the official responses to her accusations have inflamed the criticism and frustration.\", \"Quotable: \\u201cThese photos and videos can only prove that Peng Shuai is alive, but nothing else. They cannot prove that Peng Shuai is free,\\u201d Teng Biao, a prominent Chinese civil rights lawyer, said in a telephone call from his home in New Jersey.\", \"The Kremlin is taking aim at Russia\\u2019s most prominent human rights organization, Memorial International.\", \"The group, which preserves the memories of those persecuted in the gulags of the former Soviet Union, grew in the period after the bloc\\u2019s collapse, when free expression could flourish. Now prosecutors are moving to liquidate Memorial International\\u2019s archive and human rights center. Two court hearings may decide the center\\u2019s fate.\", \"Activists and dissidents consider the threat to Memorial a watershed moment for independent thinkers in Russia \\u2014 a sobering example of the government\\u2019s determination to silence its critics and sanitize the narrative surrounding the Soviet Union.\", \"Quotable: \\u201cPutin\\u2019s Russia builds itself on the denial\\u201d of the reform and social upheaval of the 1990s, said Aleksandr Baunov, editor in chief of the Carnegie Moscow Center\\u2019s website.\", \"Details: On Tuesday, Moscow\\u2019s City Court will consider allegations that the center \\u201cjustifies terrorist activities\\u201d because it included members of imprisoned religious groups as political prisoners. Later in the week, the Supreme Court will take up charges that the center violated a draconian \\u201cforeign agent\\u201d law.\", \"A Cambodian temple looter sold away his people\\u2019s heritage. He\\u2019s trying to redeem himself.\", \"From the first photos of Lady Gaga and Adam Driver in over-the-top, apr\\u00e8s-ski looks on set, it was clear that the biopic \\u201cHouse of Gucci\\u201d would be a spectacle. Gaga plays Patrizia Reggiani, the former wife of Maurizio Gucci, heir to the luxury brand\\u2019s fortune. In 1998, Reggiani \\u2014 called \\u201cthe Black Widow\\u201d in the Italian press \\u2014 was convicted of plotting Gucci\\u2019s murder.\", \"Before her divorce from Gucci, Reggiani was an eccentric among the Italian jet set \\u2014 she once said, \\u201cI would rather weep in a Rolls-Royce than be happy on a bicycle.\\u201d After Gucci was shot outside his Milan office in 1995, Reggiani told friends and reporters that she had wanted him dead. In her diary, on the day Gucci was killed, there was a single-word entry: \\u201cParadeisos,\\u201d the Greek word for \\u201cparadise.\\u201d\", \"In 1998, The Times called Reggiani\\u2019s trial \\u201cthe ultimate real-life soap opera.\\u201d It combined \\u201csome of the country\\u2019s favorite obsessions: sex, money, designer footwear and astrology.\\u201d (Reggiani\\u2019s personal psychic was among the co-conspirators, admitting that she helped hire the man who shot Gucci at her client\\u2019s instruction.)\", \"Reggiani spent 16 years in prison.
