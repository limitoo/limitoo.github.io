Consumers see the high prices for fruit and vegetables and think it's expensive but it doesn't always mean the growers are getting a higher return.\\\"\", \"Schreuder said he had spoken to a lot of growers and many were thinking of getting out of the game this year because it was not feasible to grow vegetables.\", \"\\\"Increasing rates bills are another problem, some of the key growing regions around Pukekohe and on the outskirts of Christchurch are deemed urban which means the rates are high. I think we will see a lot more growing land being sold to developers.\", \"\\\"It's a very sad situation, New Zealand is a nation of fruit and vegetables, it's got the best soils in the world and we get plenty of rain yet it's becoming unviable to grow produce here. If nothing's done we will end up relying more heavily on imports.\\\"\", \"Vegetables NZ chief executive John Murphy, who also is a garlic grower, said increasing costs could not simply be passed onto the consumer.\", \"\\\"That's difficult to do because it's such a competitive market, we really need regulators to look at whether tightening controls is going to limit fresh healthy New Zealand grown vegetables because I don't think anyone really wants to do that.\", \"\\\"In the last week alone I've had three emails from freight companies indicating general freight increases of between 7 and 9 percent, so it's always constant increases for everything. Growers are doing everything they can to be as efficient as possible but if increases keep coming there's only so efficient you can be.\\\"\", \"Murphy said the pandemic had shown the importance of growing food here because imported produce was more expensive and harder to source.\"]","href_hash":"bcb74479a17111ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bcb74479a17111ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
