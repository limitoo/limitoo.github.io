The daughter told her mum to stop the phone call, they would talk later, but to hurry, take the kids and to run to a higher point, just in case.\", \"\\\"That was the last time they spoke to each other.\\\"\", \"Reverend Finau said everyone had been affected by the disaster.\", \"\\\"I've got a brother, who is paralysed and who lives in a low-lying area in the western part of the main island of Tongatapu, from our village of Nukunuku, and he was a bit reluctant to evacuate.\", \"\\\"This was before the explosion. On Saturday, he had a conversation with my sister, who is in Wellington. And that was the last time that we heard from them.\", \"\\\"Even though he was reluctant, we agreed that they had to go.\\\"\", \"He said his congregation were worried, but understood communication had been cut off.\", \"Prayers and community spirit were getting them through, but he encouraged anyone waiting to hear from loved ones to seek support.\", \"Panmure-\\u014ct\\u0101huhu MP Jenny Salesa yesterday met with Tongan community leaders and formed the Aotearoa Tonga Relief Committee.\", \"\\\"It will be very different to the assistance that the government provides,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Of course, that would go through the official process. This is basically helping families in New Zealand to send their own care packages to their own family members in Tonga.\\\"\", \"The New Zealand Defence Force is preparing a C-130 Hercules to fly to Tonga today to deliver aid, provided it is safe to land on the main island of Tongatapu.
