Similarly, U.S. bombers have been organizing nearby drills, prompting Russia and China to strengthen military ties. Putin called such drills, regardless of affiliation, a \\\"threat.\\\"\", \"As a result, he added that Moscow is developing hypersonic missiles that could reach nearby targets in five minutes. The missiles will be added to the Russian navy early next year. Putin implied that he had little choice but to develop the missiles due to surrounding threats.\", \"\\\"What should we do? We would need to develop something similar to target those who threaten us,\\\" he said, \\\"and we can do that even now.\\\"\", \"Russia has been accused of planning to invade Ukraine, prompting the arrival of NATO. According to AP, NATO representatives have reached out to Putin saying that \\\"any attempt to further destabilize Ukraine would be a costly mistake.\\\"\", \"Russia has denied all allegations of a planned Ukrainian invasion.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942356/vladimir-putin-vtb.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Russian President Vladimir Putin said the emergence of NATO officers conducting bomber drills in Ukraine could threaten his country's security.

Putin hailed the discussions on cyber security between Russian and U.S. experts, saying \\\"just as with the pandemic, it's necessary to pool efforts to work efficiently.\\\"\", \"Asked about Biden's bid to seek a second term, Putin hailed it, saying it would help the U.S. political stability.\", \"The Russian leader also drew a parallel with his own reelection plans, saying that even though he hasn't decided yet whether to seek reelection when his current six-year term ends in 2024, the possibility of him staying on has helped stability.\", \"The 69-year-old Russian president has been in power for more than two decades\\u2014longer than any other Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. Constitutional amendments approved in 2020 reset Putin's previous term limits, allowing him to run for president two more times and hold onto power until 2036.\", \"\\\"In line with the constitution, I have the right to get elected to seek a new term, but I haven't yet made up my mind whether to do it or not,\\\" Putin said. \\\"But the very existence of that right already stabilizes the domestic political situation.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1942364/russian-missile.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Russian President Vladimir Putin said the emergence of NATO officers conducting bomber drills in Ukraine could threaten his country's security.
