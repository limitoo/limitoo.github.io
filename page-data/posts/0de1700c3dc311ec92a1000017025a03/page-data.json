This research, referred to as P3CO, is defined as \\\"research that may be reasonably anticipated to create, transfer or use potential pandemic pathogens resulting from the enhancement of a pathogen's transmissibility and/or virulence in humans.\\\"\", \"Paul accused Fauci and the NIH of \\\"defining away gain of function ... saying it doesn't exist because you change the definition ... What you've done is change the definition on your website to try to cover your ass.\\\"\", \"Paul also said that a \\\"preponderance of evidence\\\" now points towards COVID-19 emerging from the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV). But thus far, no concrete evidence has shown that the virus actually emerged from the WIV lab.\", \"When given time to speak, Fauci said, \\\"There were so many things that are egregious misrepresentation here ... that I don't think I'd be able to refute all of them.\\\"\", \"Fauci then said, \\\"I'm unwilling to take any responsibility for the current pandemic. I have no responsibility for the current pandemic.\\\"\", \"Fauci added that \\\"most card-carrying viral phylogeneticists and molecular virologists would disagree with\\\" Paul's assertion that COVID-19 came from the WIV lab. \\\"It's much more likely that this was a natural occurrence,\\\" Fauci said.\", \"Paul's assertions came in part because of recently revealed email correspondence between EcoHealth Alliance (EHA) and the NIH, discussing the EHA's virus research funded by the NIH.\", \"The EHA has spent years researching bat coronaviruses with the WIV, the Chinese laboratory in the city where the first COVID cases emerged.\", \"The WIV conducted GoF experiments to understand how animals can transmit new viruses to humans. Fauci said that such research is necessary to prevent future pandemics.\", \"A May 2016 email from the NIH expressed concern that an EHA study on\\nMERS or SARS viruses might include GoF research. The study commenced with NIH funding at the WIV after the EHA said that it wouldn't violate the government's ban on GoF.\", \"Last month, the NIH accused EHA of failing to uphold its side of the bargain when viral growth was observed in 2018 but was not reported by the organization. EHA has denied that this was the case and has claimed it did disclose the finding.\", \"He said that the purpose of the study was to see if the bat viruses would be able to infect mice despite EHA believing it to be \\\"highly unlikely.\\\"\", \"Paul said in his Thursday questioning that he wasn't accusing the NIH of creating COVID-19, but rather was worried that its funding of GoF research could contribute to a deadlier pandemic in the future.\"]","href_hash":"0de1700c3dc311ec92a1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0de1700c3dc311ec92a1000017025a03"}},
