The photo, which was published by scientists at Durham University, shows an incredibly detailed picture of millions of galaxies and space objects.\", \"Many of the 4.4 million galaxies captured in the photo hold massive black holes, or are generating new stars at high speeds. Most of the specks of light visible in the image are billions of light years away from Earth, according to the scientists. Some of the rarer objects captured in the image include colliding galaxies and flaring stars in the Milky Way.\", \"The researchers used a European radio telescope to capture 3,500 hours of observations \\u2014 that's enough data to fill 20,000 laptops.
