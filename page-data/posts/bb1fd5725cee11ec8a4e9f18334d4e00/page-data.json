Billed as a New Year\\u2019s catharsis with a heaping serving of debauchery, the show melds songs and stories about the making of \\u201cHedwig\\u201d with newer material like \\u201cNation of One,\\u201d the duo\\u2019s first song in 20 years and part of Mitchell\\u2019s lockdown album \\u201cNew American Dream.\\u201d\", \"It also includes \\u201cCall Me Joe,\\u201d an ode to Joe Exotic, the gay, polygamist, now-imprisoned zoo owner immortalized in Netflix\\u2019s \\u201cTiger King,\\u201d a character so delicious that it inspired him to audition for the first time in 27 years.\", \"A mulleted Mitchell will star in \\u201cJoe Exotic,\\u201d a fictional series coming out on Peacock in 2022. He intends it to be a fully rounded portrayal, with fewer of the \\u201ceye-catching hooks\\u201d that reduced him to \\u201cthat crazy guy over there.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI almost feel like I was playing Richard III \\u2014 an antihero who\\u2019s clearly out of his mind, but strangely admirable,\\u201d Mitchell said.\", \"Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"1. \\u201cVeneno\\u201d\", \"Television has rocked lately. I was most moved by the Spanish series \\u201cVeneno\\u201d on HBO Max. \\u201cVeneno\\u201d means \\u201cpoison,\\u201d and it\\u2019s brilliant, just brilliant, about the legendary trans celebrity Cristina La Veneno, whose life was equally inspirational and cautionary. Simply the best series in 15 years and criminally unsung. I\\u2019ve become friends with Los Javis [the duo Javier Ambrossi and Javier Calvo], who are making it, and they\\u2019re going to present our Origin of Love Tour in Spain.\", \"2. Silvio Rodr\\u00edguez\", \"I\\u2019ve been marinating in the songs of the great Cuban trovador Silvio Rodr\\u00edguez. I was looking for a song in Spanish to sing in Mexico City, and my Mexican singer friend said, \\u201cListen to this song called \\u2018Ojal\\u00e1\\u2019\\u201d \\u2014 which was stunning. And I was like, \\u201cWho is this guy?\\u201d He really is in the Latin American world as important as Dylan. He\\u2019s connected to Castro\\u2019s revolution, but the purview is larger and is very much about the heart. I cover his song \\u201cCasiopea,\\u201d about an extraterrestrial stranded on Earth, on \\u201cNew American Dream.\\u201d\", \"3. \\u201cThe Gnostic Gospels\\u201d by Elaine Pagels\", \"It\\u2019s a formative text for me, about the Christian texts which never made it into the Bible. [Her scholarship] spoke to me as a lapsed queer Catholic. I saw a much less misogynistic church, the idea of androgyny being the highest level of humanity and finding the divinity within. And along with Plato\\u2019s \\u201cSymposium,\\u201d it inspired \\u201cHedwig and the Angry Inch.\\u201d\", \"4. My House in New Orleans\", \"Covid made me question my monogamous relationship with New York, and I traveled widely. New Orleans kept drawing me back. That city groans under climate change, poverty and drugs but also shimmers with music, art, a neighborly walk-around culture and crawfish. I bought a house there from a chapter of the Order of the Oriental Templars once run by Aleister Crowley, who had his own take on Gnosticism. The energy in the house is powerful, and we\\u2019re adding our queer arty vibes to create a destination for community creativity.\", \"5. Sci-Fi Fantasy\", \"I acted up a storm in the last year, but in my downtime, I reverted to my youth and devoured dozens of sci-fi fantasy books. My favorite authors have always been women. They\\u2019re less into the hardware and more focused on emotion and theme. When I was very young, Andre Norton was my favorite. She took on a male name because boys wouldn\\u2019t read a book by a woman. I\\u2019d always heard of Octavia Butler but only started reading her in the last couple of years. She\\u2019s very much about creating community in adversity, being Black and a little gender-nonconforming herself.\", \"6. Douglas Stuart\\u2019s Novels\", \"I\\u2019m deep into the galleys of Stuart\\u2019s upcoming \\u201cYoung Mungo,\\u201d the follow-up to his gorgeous Booker Prize-winner, \\u201cShuggie Bain.\\u201d \\u201cMungo\\u201d follows a Glaswegian 15-year-old in a similar poverty-stricken setting as \\u201cShuggie.\\u201d Stuart\\u2019s aching empathy and sublime images really got their hooks in me like an ancestral tug. My wonderful and difficult mum, Joan Cameron, grew up in Glasgow. Both she and her sister, sweet Aunt Mary, passed recently, and reading Stuart inspired me to create a song with Ted Nash called \\u201cYou Can Go Now,\\u201d featuring Wynton Marsalis and Catherine Russell as my mum.\", \"7. Mavis Staples\", \"I was floored by Questlove\\u2019s doc, \\u201cSummer of Soul.\\u201d When Mahalia Jackson and Mavis Staples tear into \\u201cTake My Hand, Precious Lord,\\u201d I was transported to heaven \\u2014 not the airy-fairy buffet staffed by winged cater-waiters, but to the mountaintop accessed by a steep and bloody path. I\\u2019m presently commissioning a stained-glass portrait of Ms. Staples by the great Hadyn Butler. I worship the ground that she walks on.\", \"8. Modern Fairy Tales\", \"My own nonbinariness \\u2014 such a clinical word for a natural state \\u2014 was recently stirred and shaken by two brilliant books: \\u201cPaul Takes the Form of a Mortal Girl\\u201d by Andrea Lawlor and \\u201cVenus as a Boy\\u201d by Luke Sutherland. The former is a punk fable about a femboy who finds he can alter his body and gender at will. The protagonist of \\u201cVenus,\\u201d however, alters his body and gender at someone else\\u2019s will. Both are lonely \\u2014 and heroic.\", \"9. Films by Stephen Winter\", \"My buddy Stephen was finally acknowledged as one of our most courageous filmmakers by the inclusion of two of his films on the Criterion Channel. He produced Jonathan Caouette\\u2019s surreal auto-doc \\u201cTarnation.\\u201d But more important, he created two seminal queer Black features: \\u201cChocolate Babies\\u201d (1996), about a gang of H.I.V. positive \\u201cterrorists\\u201d fighting AIDS by any means necessary; and \\u201cJason and Shirley\\u201d (2015) about the dark symbiotic relationship between the Jewish filmmaker Shirley Clarke and her gay Black cabaret artist muse, Jason Holliday.\", \"10. Lockdown Podcasts\", \"While luxuriating in \\u201cDolly Parton\\u2019s America,\\u201d I rereleased Bryan Weller\\u2019s and my musical \\u201cAnthem: Homunculus,\\u201d starring Cynthia Erivo, Glenn Close and Patti LuPone, as a free podcast. I play a guy crowdfunding his cancer care who finds that his brain tumor is sentient \\u2014 voiced by Laurie Anderson, naturally. I also provided voices for my brother Colin MacKenzie Mitchell\\u2019s [upcoming] \\u201cThe Laundronauts,\\u201d starring the late great Ed Asner, about a boy who is stuffed into a washer by a bully and disappears. His friends, the Laundronauts, must go in and rescue him. I play the Spirit of Absentia, the land beyond the washer where all the lost things go: socks, coins and boys. Along with their hopes, fears and dreams. Lockdown metaphors abound.\"]","href_hash":"bb1fd5725cee11ec8a4e9f18334d4e00"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bb1fd5725cee11ec8a4e9f18334d4e00"}},
