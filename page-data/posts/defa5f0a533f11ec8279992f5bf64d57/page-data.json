We look at the present.\", \"\\\"We have the sense of self-belief that we can cause upsets anywhere and we've done that recently to kind of be able to take the World Test Championship.\\\"\", \"Both teams were forced to cancel their training sessions on Wednesday due to unseasonal rain and Patel said his team mates would not mind an extra day's rest.\", \"The 33-year-old left-arm spinner, who expects a lot of family members in the stands during the test, said adapting to the Wankhede Stadium pitch will be the key for New Zealand.\", \"\\\"I guess the red clay has a bit more bounce and pace,\\\" said Patel, who has rolled his arm over at a few practice sessions in the past at the stadium for the Indian Premier League side Mumbai Indians.\", \"\\\"We've just got to assess the wicket that's given to us and how it's responding, and we've got to set up a game plan according to that now.\", \"\\\"The beauty about Indian conditions is that you have to adapt very quickly and we know how good these guys are at playing spin, how adept they are in their home conditions. So it is a great challenge and something we look forward to.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/281487/eight_col_si.jpg?1638114547\\\" alt=\\\"Shreyas Iyer of India celebrates.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nShreyas Iyer \\nPhoto: PHOTOSPORT\\n</div>\", \"Meanwhile India will hope the return of regular captain Virat Kohli proves to be the difference for the hosts.\", \"While Kohli's return after a rest will be a welcome boost for the second-ranked test side's batting, it will also leave them with a selection headache.\", \"In Kohli's absence, Mumbai batter Shreyas Iyer made a dream test debut with a first-innings 105 followed by a crucial 65 in the second.\", \"Calls have grown to drop either Ajinkya Rahane, who led India in Kanpur, or Cheteshwar Pujara - both of whom have been short of runs - to vacate a spot for Kohli and allow Iyer to retain his place.\", \"\\\"Both with Ajinkya and obviously Pujara, we know that there's lot of experience behind them,\\\" India's bowling coach Paras Mhambrey said.\", \"\\\"We also know as a team that they're one inning away from coming into form. So as a team everyone is behind them, backing them. We know the value they bring to the team, the experience that they have will come good.\", \"\\\"So in that sense, we are really not having those discussions around them.
