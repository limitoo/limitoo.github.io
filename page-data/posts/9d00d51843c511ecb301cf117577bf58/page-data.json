P\\u00d6LTEN, Austria \\u2014 \\u201cSpeak of me as I am,\\u201d Othello urges in the wrenching final scene of Shakespeare\\u2019s tragedy. Yet for centuries, those words \\u2014 a plea for accurate representation \\u2014 were spoken, by and large, by white actors.\", \"Nicholas Monu, who stars in a new production of \\u201cOthello,\\u201d running through Dec. 4 at the Landestheater Nieder\\u00f6sterreich here, is pretty sure that he is only the second Black performer to play the role in Austrian theater history. The last time was nearly 170 years ago, in 1853, when the pioneering African-American actor Ira Aldridge held Viennese audiences spellbound as the Moor of Venice.\", \"As directed by the young Black British director Rikki Henry, this new \\u201cOthello\\u201d breaks ground in a country where artists of color remain a rarity onstage.\", \"The majority of Austria\\u2019s population of around nine million is white and was born here, although the percentage of foreigners and people with migration backgrounds has been rising steadily in recent years. Like its larger and more ethnically varied neighbor Germany, Austria has a robust system of state-funded theaters that employ full-time acting ensembles; these, like the country at large, are overwhelmingly white.\", \"With its new \\u201cOthello,\\u201d the Landestheater is jump-starting a conversation about racism in Austrian society and the need for diversity on the country\\u2019s stages. According to the theater, there has never been a German-language production of \\u201cOthello\\u201d with both a Black director and star before, and it seems significant that the first is taking place not in a major cultural metropolis, but in St. P\\u00f6lten, a small city 40 miles outside Vienna.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s often said that innovation comes from the provinces,\\u201d Marie R\\u00f6tzer, the Landestheater\\u2019s artistic director since 2016, said in an interview. Recently, her playhouse has been punching above its weight, with productions including a stellar 2019 staging of the Nobel Prize-winning author Elfriede Jelinek\\u2019s allegory of the Trump presidency, \\u201cAm K\\u00f6nigsweg,\\u201d and a 2020 \\u201cHamlet\\u201d that was Henry\\u2019s house debut, and which won a Netroy, the prestigious Austrian theater award.\", \"Although Shakespeare has long been venerated in the German-speaking world, \\u201cOthello\\u201d is a comparative rarity on its theater programs.\", \"\\u201cNormally, nobody here wants to touch it,\\u201d said Tim Breyvogel, the German actor who plays Iago, in an interview after a recent matinee performance. In the wrong hands, he said, an \\u201cOthello\\u201d production can legitimize stereotypes about Black men. And then there\\u2019s the issue of casting, he added: Even in Austria, most theaters now realize that presenting the title role in blackface was unacceptable.\", \"R\\u00f6tzer said she knew her theater\\u2019s \\u201cOthello\\u201d must have a Black actor in the title role. After Henry\\u2019s success with \\u201cHamlet,\\u201d she approached him about directing the show. Henry and Monu\\u2019s experiences as Black men helped the theater to \\u201cdevelop an awareness about how to treat topics that are part of the Black community,\\u201d she said.\", \"\\u201cWith this \\u2018Othello,\\u2019 we\\u2019re addressing wounds: the wounds of racism, hostility towards refugees, xenophobia and the isolationism that you often find in Austria,\\u201d R\\u00f6tzer said.\", \"Henry, 33, said in an interview that it was \\u201ca challenge to try to work out what the story would now tell in Austria \\u2014 because, of course, race relations are different in Austria than they are in England.\\u201d\", \"His strikingly contemporary production is set in the world of professional boxing, where Othello is a heavyweight prizefighter. \\u201cMy idea was of someone who was incredibly lonely and someone who was isolated,\\u201d Henry said.\", \"That sense of exclusion and alienation, the director said, was something that everyone, regardless of their skin color, could relate to. The boxing frame also helped to motivate Iago\\u2019s machinations and reveal the character\\u2019s racism, he added. \\u201cIago\\u2019s manipulations and reasonings became more alive, because boxing is so competitive and relies on intrigue,\\u201d Henry said.\", \"The Black Lives Matter movement was heating up as he worked on the show last year, but Henry said he was careful not to take the production in an overtly political direction. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t want to say to the audience, \\u2018You\\u2019re racist!\\u2019\\u201d Henry said. \\u201cTheater isn\\u2019t supposed to be accusing anyone. It\\u2019s supposed to be supporting and maybe ennobling them in some way.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMaybe it just sparks some interesting questions that you haven\\u2019t asked before, like, \\u2018How do I treat that brown person who delivers my mail every morning?\\u2019\\u201d he added.\", \"Monu, 56, who was born in Nigeria but lives in Salzburg, Austria, said that racism in Austrian society largely lay beneath the surface. \\u201cPeople don\\u2019t give it a lot of thought. There hasn\\u2019t been that journey that America has been forced to make, because of slavery, Jim Crow, etc. \\u2014 or that Germany has been forced to make, because of the Second World War,\\u201d he said.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not an aggressive form of racism,\\u201d he added. \\u201cYou\\u2019re just not taken seriously or not seen as on quite the same level as a human being.\\u201d\", \"Monu, who began his acting career in England, is a former ensemble member of two of the most significant theaters in the German-speaking world: the Schaub\\u00fchne in Berlin and the Burgtheater in Vienna. Yet despite having benefited from the ensemble system, he said it would need updating if it hoped to reflect the increasingly multiethnic reality of Europe today.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a fantastic system, designed for brothers like this,\\u201d he said, gesturing toward Breyvogel, who sat next to him during the interview, \\u201cto be able to go from here to Berlin to Vienna, and be able to fit straight in, because the system is pretty much the same everywhere.\\u201d\", \"In order for things to change, Austrian theater administrators and audiences will need to become more familiar with seeing actors of color and hearing different accents onstage, Monu said. He saw some encouraging signs, he added: When he joined the Burgtheater in the early 2000s, he was the only Black actor in the ensemble; today, there are three.\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re going to be truly diverse, then you\\u2019ve got to open up your doors towards people who don\\u2019t sound like you, look like you,\\u201d Monu said. \\u201cSometimes the journey\\u2019s going to be unpleasant or uncomfortable.\\u201d\", \"Monu said he hoped that this \\u201cOthello\\u201d might inspire local audiences take that journey. \\u201cI can try my best to touch as many people as I can, just by saying, \\u2018Hey, you know what, I\\u2019m the first Black guy you\\u2019ve ever seen onstage \\u2014 and speaking German.\\u2019\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9d00d51843c511ecb301cf117577bf58"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9d00d51843c511ecb301cf117577bf58"}},
