And I'm talking about every member of the left. 'Don't trust a vaccine, don't get the vaccine, you're gonna die from the vaccine.'\\\"\", \"Rodgers continued, \\\"And then what happens? Biden wins and everything flips...isn't this s*** about health and not about like, politics.\\\"\", \"\\\"I'm gonna critically think about what's best for my own health. I'm not judging anybody else. I'm not saying 'you shouldn't do this, you shouldn't do that.' I'm making a decision that's based on what's best for me and my health,\\\" Rodgers added.\", \"Earlier this week, the Packers announced that Rodgers was placed on the COVID-19 list after he contracted the virus. Rodgers previously claimed that he was \\\"immunized\\\" but during his recent interview on The Pat McAfee Show, he explained that he is allergic to something in the mRNA (Pfizer and Moderna) vaccines, which has prompted him to find his own treatment plan.\", \"Rodgers also spoke about the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine but said he was opposed to receiving it due to some of the previous issues with it causing blood clots.\", \"\\\"I realize I'm in the crosshairs of the woke mob right now,\\\" Rodgers said in regard to the criticism he has received since contracting the novel coronavirus. \\\"I believe strongly in bodily autonomy and ability to make choices for your body: Not have to acquiesce to some woke culture or crazed group of individuals who say you have to do something. Health is not a one-size-fits-all for everybody.\\\"\", \"During the interview, Rodgers also said that he spoke with popular podcast host Joe Rogan, who also recently contracted COVID-19 and said he used ivermectin to treat his symptoms.\", \"While ivermectin has been praised by some as a COVID-19 treatment, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has warned that it is not an approved option to combat the coronavirus.\", \"\\\"There are approved uses for ivermectin in people and animals but it is not approved for the prevention or treatment of COVID-19,\\\" the FDA said on its website.\", \"Since Rodgers tested positive for COVID-19, under the NFL's policy, he will miss 10 days.
