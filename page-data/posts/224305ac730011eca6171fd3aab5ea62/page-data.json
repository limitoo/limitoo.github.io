(The survey was created in partnership with Origin, a pelvic floor physical therapy company.)\", \"All 60 companies had ads rejected by Facebook, and about half of them said their accounts had been suspended at some point, according to the report, which was released on Tuesday. In most cases, Facebook had labeled the ads as containing \\u201cadult content\\u201d or promoting \\u201cadult products and services.\\u201d\", \"In its advertising policies, Facebook says that \\u201cads promoting sexual and reproductive health products or services, like contraception and family planning must be targeted to people 18 years or older and must not focus on sexual pleasure.\\u201d\", \"On its website, Facebook provides examples of ads that are not permitted (\\u201cbuy our sex toys for your adult pleasure\\u201d) and those that are (\\u201cnew moisturizing lube to relieve vaginal dryness on a day to day basis\\u201d and \\u201cpractice safe sex with our brand of condoms\\u201d).\", \"Still, Ms. Rotman found many ads targeting men that were accepted by Facebook despite appearing to break the social media platform\\u2019s policy: an ad for condoms that promises \\u201cpleasure\\u201d; one for lubricant (\\u201clotion made just for men\\u2019s alone time\\u201d); and another for an erectile dysfunction pill that promises a \\u201cwet hot American summer.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cRight now, it\\u2019s arbitrary where they\\u2019ll say a product is or isn\\u2019t allowed in a way that we think has really sexist undertones and a lack of understanding about health,\\u201d Ms. Rotman said. She said that it was \\u201ca systemic problem\\u201d and added that it is especially detrimental to small businesses.\", \"\\u201cWe welcome ads for sexual wellness products but we prohibit nudity and have specific rules about how these products can be marketed on our platform,\\u201d a spokesperson for Meta, Facebook\\u2019s parent company, wrote in an email. \\u201cWe have provided detail to advertisers about what kinds of products and descriptions we allow in ads.\\u201d\", \"The spokesperson added that Facebook makes mistakes in enforcing its advertising policies and that it has overturned several ad rejections that some of the companies mentioned in the report experienced.\", \"One company that has struggled to get ads approved by Facebook is Joylux, which sells menopausal health products, including a device that is inserted into the vagina and is used to strengthen the pelvic floor.\", \"\\u201cOur consumer is a Facebook consumer,\\u201d said Colette Courtion, the chief executive of Joylux, who founded the company in 2014. \\u201cShe\\u2019s a 50-year-old woman. Facebook is the best place for her to be educated on menopause-related topics.\\u201d Ms. Courtion added that Facebook is Joylux\\u2019s top customer-acquisition channel.\", \"But, she said, Joylux employees have long been confused by Facebook\\u2019s policies and how they are applied.\", \"\\u201cBecause of the nature of our product, the look of it,\\u201d she said, Facebook and other companies believe it is \\u201cpornographic.\\u201d\", \"Since 2017, Joylux\\u2019s Facebook account has been shut down twice, Ms. Courtion said. The company did not tell her why.\", \"Heather Dazell, the vice president of marketing at Joylux, said she has found that \\u201cany ad going directly to our site would be automatically denied because of the word \\u2018vagina.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"A spokesperson for Meta said that Facebook does not have a blanket ban on words like \\u201cmenopause\\u201d or \\u201cvagina\\u201d but considers \\u201chow each ad is positioned.\\u201d\", \"Over the years, Joylux has pulled back its approach to Facebook ads. But even with the changes Joylux has made to its copy and imagery, many of its ads are still rejected in the initial review process. Two years ago, Joylux started working with an agency that helps the company appeal ad rejections. Usually, after the appeal, the ads are approved.\", \"But the process is time-consuming and expensive, Ms. Courtion said, and the resulting ads are not helpful to consumers. \\u201cWe can\\u2019t show what the product looks like and we can\\u2019t say what it does,\\u201d she said.\", \"Intimate Rose, a company in Kansas City, Mo., that sells vaginal dilators and pelvic-floor weights and wands, has faced similar issues. \\u201cWe\\u2019re normally always rejected,\\u201d said Adrienne Fleming, the company\\u2019s digital media manager.\", \"She provided several examples, including an ad with a fully clothed, laughing couple (\\u201clive, laugh, and love again with pelvic health products from Intimate Rose,\\u201d its copy reads). Two other ads featured videos of women discussing how Intimate Rose weights have helped them with incontinence. Ms. Fleming said all of the ads were rejected because Facebook categorized them as \\u201cadult products or services.\\u201d\", \"In the adult products section of its commerce policy, Meta gives several examples of items that are banned: \\u201csex toys, sexual enhancement products, sexually oriented adult products such as pornography, or used or worn underwear, images of nudity including partial child nudity, even if not sexual in nature.\\u201d\", \"But the policy states that \\u201cproducts such as lubricants or condoms, which do not focus on sexual pleasure or sexual enhancement\\u201d are allowed.\", \"In an exchange with Facebook that she shared with The New York Times, Ms. Fleming pointed out that the company\\u2019s products are not intended for intercourse or pleasure. In response, the Facebook representative pointed to the commerce policy and said that the ad was correctly rejected, and that he would not be able to reveal any more details because they could be used to circumvent the policy in the future. \", \"\\u201cIt comes down to the reviewer\\u2019s judgment,\\u201d said Aaron Wilt, one of the founders of Intimate Rose.\", \"Businesses are not the only entities that use Facebook ads. RNW Media, a nonprofit in the Netherlands, builds online communities for social change \\u2014 including Love Matters, which is focused on sexual and reproductive health and rights, and relies on Facebook ads to reach its audience.\", \"During a span of six years, nearly 1,800 ads that Love Matters posted to Facebook were rejected, according to a report on the sustainability of journalism and news media that was presented at the United Nations Internet Governance Forum in 2020. Most often, the reason was that the ads were categorized as \\u201cadult content\\u201d or as \\u201csex toys.\\u201d\", \"Michael Okun Oliech, the social media director for Love Matters Kenya, said Facebook recently rejected two ads he submitted for promoting an \\u201cescort service.\\u201d One of them was about consent; the other was about living with H.I.V.\", \"He said that the appeals process takes him anywhere from a week to months and that he rarely has the opportunity to speak with \\u201ca real human being.\\u201d To avoid rejection, Mr. Okun Oliech has started using slang and substituting fruit emojis for words that describe certain body parts (a tactic that has been successful for companies such as Hims, which sells Viagra).\", \"But Charlotte Petty, a human rights expert at RNW Media, is worried about the consequences of being indirect or euphemistic. \\u201cThere are ways we can mitigate the censorship, but at one point, we\\u2019re compromising our own work,\\u201d she said.\", \"Facebook\\u2019s ad platform has been criticized repeatedly in recent years. In 2018, a Washington Post investigation found that dozens of ads for L.G.B.T.Q.-related events, companies and nonprofits were blocked by the social network because they were deemed \\u201cpolitical.\\u201d Facebook, which requires advertisers focusing on politics or social issues to go through several additional layers for ad approval, called the majority of the ad rejections a mistake.\", \"In November, Meta said it would stop advertisers from targeting people with promotions based on their engagement with content related to health, race and ethnicity, political affiliation, religion, and sexual orientation, among other identifiers. The tools have been used to discriminate against specific groups and to spam people.\", \"When it comes to the sexual health and wellness companies, Ms. Rotman is hopeful that Facebook can act quickly. \\u201cThis is a fixable problem,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not as complicated as protecting democracy or elections. It\\u2019s about finding a way to make sure that women\\u2019s health ads aren\\u2019t being blocked. It\\u2019s simply a matter of Facebook deciding that this is something they\\u2019re going to fix.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"224305ac730011eca6171fd3aab5ea62"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"224305ac730011eca6171fd3aab5ea62"}},
