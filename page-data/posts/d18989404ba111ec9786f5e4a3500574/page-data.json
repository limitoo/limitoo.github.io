Brainard was the preferred alternative to Powell  among many progressives.\", \"The president said he will fill  the three remaining slots on the board, including a vice chair for  supervision, a bank regulatory post, in early December.\", \"\\\"I'm confident that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard's focus on keeping  inflation low, prices stable, and delivering full employment will make  our economy stronger than ever before,\\\" Mr. Biden said in a statement. \\\"I have full confidence after their trial by fire over the  last 20 months that Chair Powell and Dr. Brainard will provide the  strong leadership our country needs.\\\"\", \"Biden's decision, reached after extensive consideration, strikes a  note of continuity and bipartisanship at a time when surging inflation  is burdening households and raising risks to the economy's recovery. In  backing Powell \\u2014 a Republican who was first elevated to his post by  President Donald Trump \\u2014 Biden brushed aside complaints from progressives  that the Fed has weakened bank regulation and has been slow to take  account of climate change in its supervision of banks.\", \"Last week, top Democratic senators Sheldon Whitehouse and Jeff Merkley wrote  to Mr. Biden to oppose Powell's renomination, saying he \\\"refuses to  recognize climate change as an urgent and systemic economic threat.\\\"\", \"Powell's  term ends on February 5, 2022. His nomination for a second term is  expected to enjoy a smooth passage both in the Senate Banking Committee  and the wider chamber, which must hold a vote.\", \"If reconfirmed to his post, Powell would remain one of the most  powerful economic officials in the world. By either raising or lowering  its benchmark interest rate, the Fed seeks to either cool or stimulate  growth and hiring, and to keep prices stable. Its efforts to direct the  U.S. economy, the largest in the world, typically have global  consequences.\", \"The Fed's short-term rate, which has been pegged near zero since the  pandemic hammered the economy in March 2020, influences a wide range of  consumer and business borrowing costs, including for mortgages and  credit cards. The Fed also oversees the nation's largest banks.\", \"In a second term, to begin in February, Powell would face a difficult  and high-risk balancing act. Rising inflation is causing hardships for  millions of families, clouding the economic recovery and undercutting  the Fed's mandate to keep prices stable. But with the economy still 4  million-plus jobs shy of its pre-pandemic level, the Fed has yet to meet  its other mandate of maximizing employment.\", \"If the Fed moves too slowly to raise rates, inflation may accelerate  further and force the Fed to take more draconian steps later to rein it  in, potentially causing a recession. Yet if the Fed hikes rates too  quickly, it could choke off hiring and the economic recovery.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"d18989404ba111ec9786f5e4a3500574"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d18989404ba111ec9786f5e4a3500574"}},
