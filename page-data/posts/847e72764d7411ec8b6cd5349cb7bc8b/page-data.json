Our conversation has been condensed and edited.\", \"Jonathan: We spoke almost exactly one year ago, before Thanksgiving 2020. Now we have the vaccines, but the U.S. is still averaging more than 90,000 cases per day, and we\\u2019re trending up again before the holidays. Where do you think we are headed during the next few months?\", \"Fauci: The big difference between now and our conversation one year ago is what you yourself mentioned, and that is the vaccines. That\\u2019s the really good news. It is unambiguous that someone who is vaccinated has a very higher likelihood of being protected against infection, hospitalization and death compared to a very vulnerable, unvaccinated person.\", \"The sobering news is that what we are starting to see, as the Israelis have seen before us, is that over time, usually measured in several months, immunity wanes. You start to see an uptick in infection, hospitalizations and deaths across all age groups \\u2014 although it\\u2019s more pronounced with the elderly. When you look at the Israelis, when they boosted, they found a rather dramatic enhancement of protection that reverses the waning and gets you to the point where people who have been boosted are like 10 times less likely to get infected than unboosted people.\", \"This means there is another moving target for us in the United States. If we want to start mitigating against a winter surge, we\\u2019ve got to start right now. We\\u2019re doing a good job because right now 30 million people have been boosted. We got to get that up to hundreds of millions of people boosted and vaccinated.\", \"Adam: Do you think there\\u2019s a scenario where we would need another round of boosters, given the course of the virus?\", \"Fauci: We don\\u2019t know because we\\u2019ve never been in this situation with this virus before. There were still many gaps in our knowledge. What are the possibilities?\", \"It is conceivable that the third boost of an mRNA vaccine might actually be what should have been the original full components of an immunization regimen. But we didn\\u2019t know that because, when we were making the vaccine and testing it, we did not have the time to spend a year trying to figure out what the best dose of the best interval was. That\\u2019s one scenario.\", \"The second scenario is that when we give a boost, that we get people through this winter and the spring, and then, all of a sudden a year later, you find out that my hope for durability of response isn\\u2019t true, and we need to be boosting somebody next year, or a year and a half, or two years later.\", \"Adam: There have been more boosters given out in rich countries than there have been first doses in many poor countries. So how do you balance the benefit of the boosters against the potential rise of more variants when you have huge unvaccinated populations in the developing world?\", \"Fauci: I think it is absolutely essential, and we have a moral responsibility to the developed world, to make sure that there\\u2019s equity in the global distribution of vaccines. We need the developed world to make sure that at the same time that they boost themselves, they have equity for the low- and middle-income countries. And in fact, in the United States, for every one dose that we give as a boost, or any one dose of vaccine, we give three doses to the developing world.\", \"Adam: But isn\\u2019t vaccine manufacturing a zero-sum game? Ultimately, if we wanted to direct even more doses to the developing world, we could do that if we had a lower booster supply.\", \"Fauci: Well, no, actually. Right now, unfortunately, many of the doses that are getting sent are not even being used, because of the lack of ability in distribution capability. I\\u2019m not saying that that\\u2019s an excuse, but you\\u2019ve got to look into that. That is a problem. So, I personally, and the government now is very keenly aware that we need to do both. We need to optimize the protection here with boosting at the same time \\u2014 not before, or after, but at the same time \\u2014 as we provide primary immunization doses to the low- and middle-income countries.\", \"Jonathan: Do you think boosters are going to have a big impact on the pandemic if, one, not everyone\\u2019s getting them \\u2014 uptake has been generally slow \\u2014 and, two, if they\\u2019re not adopted by a wide cross-section of society?\", \"Fauci: When you have a number of moving parts, with disparities of different groups, who \\u2014 either willingly or because of lack of access \\u2014 either don\\u2019t get vaccinated or don\\u2019t get boosted, then you\\u2019re going to have a disparity of the impact of the pandemic on different groups of people.\", \"So if you look at the pandemic as a broad 40,000-foot phenomenon, and you have 62 million people, the way we have right now, who are not yet vaccinated \\u2014 and many more people who might not get boosted \\u2014 that\\u2019s going to have an impact on the broad concept of the outbreak. But if you take people who are vaccinated and boosted, they\\u2019re going to be walking through the outbreak and have much less of a risk than anybody else.\", \"Adam: Why have we not seen a major variant since Delta that has really spread through the global population?\", \"Fauci: It\\u2019s pure virology. Delta has adapted itself to be a highly, highly transmissible virus that has essentially bumped off the radar screen virtually every other one. We knew that when you look at how rapidly Delta took over the United States. It depends on the fitness of the virus to transmit. And it just so happens that even though there are a lot of other viruses out there that have different variants, Delta has emerged as the big bully on the block.\", \"Jonathan: What do you think the virus becoming endemic looks like and when is this going to happen?\", \"Fauci: You know, guys, I don\\u2019t know. We don\\u2019t know. The one thing I\\u2019ve said multiple times is that the multiple phases of an outbreak are pandemic deceleration, control, elimination and eradication.\", \"There\\u2019s no way we\\u2019re going to eradicate, I doubt, because of the transmissibility that we just mentioned. I doubt very seriously whether we\\u2019re going to eliminate it, like we\\u2019ve eliminated polio, and we\\u2019ve eliminated measles, and a century ago we eliminated malaria from the United States. But there\\u2019s control and it\\u2019s going to be up to us what level of control that we are willing to accept.\", \"If you\\u2019re willing to accept control at 70,000 per day, that\\u2019s wrong. No way we can accept 70,000, 80,000 infections a day. You have to get it down so low that it doesn\\u2019t impact, in a negative way, society. So we don\\u2019t worry about getting sick and dying. Our economy is essentially held hostage to it. That\\u2019s the control. When we get there, I can\\u2019t predict. I hope it\\u2019s relatively soon, and it\\u2019s going to depend a lot on how well we do in vaccinating the population.\", \"Jonathan: How should people approach the holidays?\", \"Fauci: What an individual can feel comfortable in doing depends on their status. So if you\\u2019ve got a family where people are vaccinated \\u2014 the family\\u2019s vaccinated, the children who can be vaccinated are vaccinated, that kind of situation \\u2014 people should feel very, very free and un-anxious about having an enjoyable Thanksgiving holiday. Those who are unvaccinated, they can also have an enjoyable holiday. They\\u2019re just going to do it at a greater risk.\", \"For very young children who can\\u2019t yet be vaccinated because it\\u2019s not authorized yet, the best way to protect them is to surround them with vaccinated adults.\", \"Adam: Last year we asked you what you\\u2019re thankful for, you very sweetly talked about your wife. What in the last 12 months are you thankful for \\u2014 personally, professionally, or both?\", \"Fauci: Well, I\\u2019ll give you one of each. I\\u2019m professionally thankful that we successfully did something that was unprecedented in the history of vaccinology. And that is, we went from the sequence of a virus to a vaccine that was highly effective and safe. And we\\u2019ve been able to vaccinate a substantial proportion, although not as much as I would want, but a substantial proportion of the of the population. That\\u2019s professional.\", \"Personally, it\\u2019s the same thing. It\\u2019s no secret that I have been clearly targeted by rather radical elements who just keep attacking me every day, all day \\u2014 Fox News, Breitbart \\u2014 all those other crazies. And what I\\u2019m thankful for is what I said last year, that I have an incredible partner who is really amazing in her understanding of me and just keeps me grounded in reality when you have hand grenades being thrown at you every day. To have somebody that reminds you that what you\\u2019re doing is absolutely important for the health and the safety of the country, so don\\u2019t pay any attention to all that nonsense. That\\u2019s what I\\u2019m thankful for.\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic. Send us a response here, and we may feature it in an upcoming newsletter.\", \"Sign up here to get the briefing by email.\", \"We\\u2019re off tomorrow for the holiday, but will be back Friday. Have a safe and Happy Thanksgiving!\", \"Email your thoughts to briefing@nytimes.com.\"]","href_hash":"847e72764d7411ec8b6cd5349cb7bc8b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"847e72764d7411ec8b6cd5349cb7bc8b"}},
