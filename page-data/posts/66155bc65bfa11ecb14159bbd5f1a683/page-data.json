That's according to a contempt report released Sunday night by the House of Representatives panel investigating the January 6 Capitol riot.\", \"The report comes just days after Meadows launched legal proceedings against the panel and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Meadows filed a lawsuit in a Washington, D.C. federal court on December 8 after the committee said it would proceed with a contempt case against him for his refusal to appear for a deposition.\", \"Among other issues, the committee said Meadows sent emails and texts about sending \\\"alternate electors\\\" to Congress in November 2020, allegedly saying \\\"I love it\\\" about the idea to an unidentified member of Congress.\", \"\\\"Mr. Meadows received text messages and emails regarding apparent efforts to encourage Republican legislators in certain States to send alternate slates of electors to Congress, a plan which one Member of Congress acknowledged was 'highly controversial' and to which Mr. Meadows responded, 'I love it,'\\\" the committee report said.\", \"\\\"Mr. Meadows responded to a similar message by saying '[w]e are' and another such message by saying 'Yes. Have a team on it,'\\\" it said.\", \"The committee also said in its report that Meadows introduced former President Donald Trump to then-Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark as part of efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\", \"\\\"Mr. Clark went on to recommend to Mr. Trump that he be installed as Acting Attorney General and that DOJ should send a letter to State officials urging them to take certain actions that could affect the outcome of the November 2020 election by, among other things, appointing alternate slates of electors to cast electoral votes for Mr. Trump rather than now-President Biden,\\\" the report said.\", \"Meadows also sent a January 5 email recommending the National Guard be on \\\"standby,\\\" and that troops be \\\"present to protect pro-Trump people,\\\" according to the report.\", \"\\\"Mr. Meadows exchanged text messages with, and provided guidance to, an organizer of the January 6th rally on the Ellipse after the organizer told him that '[t]hings have gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction. Please,\\\" the report said.\", \"The report comes with Meadows under fire for refusing to cooperate with the panel probing the events that unfolded on January 6.\", \"Committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-MS) said in a December 8 letter to Meadows' attorney, George Terwilliger, that the panel \\\"is left with no choice but to advance contempt proceedings and recommend that the body in which Mr. Meadows once served refer him for criminal prosecution.\\\"\", \"Former Trump adviser Steve Bannon has been charged with contempt of Congress, while the committee has said it is weighing similar charges against Clark.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950008/former-trump-chief-staff-mark-meadows.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows speaks to members of the press outside the West Wing of the White House on August 28, 2020 in Washington, DC. </div>\"]","href_hash":"66155bc65bfa11ecb14159bbd5f1a683"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"66155bc65bfa11ecb14159bbd5f1a683"}},
