Ten people were killed, as shoppers and employees ran for cover. Mr. Alissa, who lived in Arvada, Colo., a nearby suburb, was charged with 10 counts of first-degree murder, which in Colorado carries a penalty of life imprisonment without parole.\", \"At Mr. Alissa\\u2019s first court appearance in March, Kathryn Herold, a public defender who was among those assigned to represent him, raised the possibility that he had a mental illness when she asked the judge to postpone the next court date.\", \"\\u201cWe cannot do anything until we are able to fully assess Mr. Alissa\\u2019s mental illness,\\u201d Ms. Herold said at the hearing.\", \"Ms. Herold did not immediately respond to a message on Friday night.\", \"According to court records, two doctors who evaluated Mr. Alissa concluded that his \\u201csuperficial responses\\u201d to hypothetical legal situations indicated a \\u201cpassive approach to his defense\\u201d and \\u201cpotential overreliance on his attorneys.\\u201d\", \"On Friday, Judge Ingrid S. Bakke of the 20th Judicial District of Colorado ordered the Colorado Department of Human Services to provide updates on Mr. Alissa every 30 days, according to the district attorney\\u2019s office. She also scheduled a hearing on March 15, 2022, to review his case, prosecutors said.\", \"\\u201cOnce the defendant\\u2019s competency is restored, he will be returned to Boulder and this case will progress forward,\\u201d the district attorney\\u2019s office said. \\u201cOur office will continue to fight for justice in this case.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"2dbec02854ac11ecb570bd841142011b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2dbec02854ac11ecb570bd841142011b"}},
