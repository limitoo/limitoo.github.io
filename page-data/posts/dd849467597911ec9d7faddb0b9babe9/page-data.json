Jerry Brown\\u2019s chief of staff.\", \"Mr. Viswanathan, who holds a chartered financial analyst designation, in January 2021 began working remotely as a senior policy adviser on the White House National Economic Council, and now travels between Washington and Sacramento. After graduating summa cum laude from Harvard, he received a master of philosophy degree in historical studies from the University of Cambridge and a law degree and M.B.A. from Stanford.\", \"Dr. Huynh is now the chief fellow in the division of hematology and oncology at the UC Davis Medical Center, and is also completing a master of advanced study in clinical research at the University of California, Davis. She graduated cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, and received a medical degree from Tulane University.\", \"On their first date, they sat at a table shaped like the state of California and identified with each other as children of immigrants \\u2014 his parents came from India and hers from Vietnam. (Her parents escaped by boat to Hong Kong in 1980 and now live in Fremont, Calif.)\", \"\\u201cThat was a common thread,\\u201d Dr. Huynh said.\", \" Afterward, they walked around Capitol Park, and before she got into her car, he surprised her with a kiss.\", \"[Click here to binge read this week\\u2019s featured couples.]\", \"\\u201cWhat just happened,\\u201d she recalled thinking. \\u201cI don\\u2019t think I ever kissed anyone on a first date before.\\u201d\", \"A couple of weeks later they met for breakfast at Mimosa House in East Sacramento around 7 a.m. She was coming off the night shift and he was on his way to work.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s going to take a lot of effort to find out when we\\u2019re both awake and free at the same time,\\u201d he recalled thinking.\", \"As they continued to date, Mr. Viswanathan tried to persuade Dr. Huynh, an avid runner, to go running with him. At first, she said she felt that her time running was better spent alone. \\u201cI thought it should be a solitary activity,\\u201d she said.\", \"But that fall she reluctantly joined Mr. Viswanathan for a run around McKinley Park, and it became a weekly activity. Dr. Huynh later cheered him on when he ran the California International Marathon in December 2017; he cheered her on when she ran it a year later.\", \"In January 2018, Mr. Viswanathan entered the primary race for treasurer of the State of California, running as a Democrat.

Gavin Newsom.\", \"The couple became engaged in January 2020. Mr. Viswanathan proposed inside a yurt on the roof of Ample Hills Creamery, their favorite ice cream shop, in Gowanus, Brooklyn, while they were on a trip to visit his parents in New Hyde Park, N.Y. Inside the yurt, on a sofa, was a tiny pillow embroidered to read: \\u201cA fianc\\u00e9 is one of the nicest things to have, and the nicest thing to be.\\u201d\", \"They first planned to get married in July 2021, but postponed the wedding because of the pandemic.
