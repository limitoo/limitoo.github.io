The agency\\u2019s director is now expected to accept the recommendation and children could start getting shots this week.\", \"To prepare, the Biden administration has enlisted more than 20,000 pediatricians, family doctors and pharmacies to administer the shots. About 15 million doses are being packed and shipped to vaccination sites across the country.\", \"My colleague Apoorva Mandavilli said the endorsement is timely, as Americans begin to plan for the winter holidays.\", \"\\u201cAlthough cases in the U.S. have been falling steadily for weeks, experts have warned that once you start gathering for the holidays, the numbers can easily go up again, even if they might not be as bad as they were last year,\\u201d Apoorva said. \\u201cWe are not anywhere near the percentage of the population that we need to vaccinate, so the more unvaccinated people we can protect, including children, the better off we\\u2019ll be.\\u201d\", \"The big question now is whether hesitant parents will immunize their children.\", \"About three in 10 parents say they will definitely not get the vaccine for their 5- to 11-year-old children, according to a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation. A similar percentage of parents said that they would immunize their children \\u201cright away,\\u201d a figure that has barely budged since similar polls in July and September.\", \"Still, the rollout of the vaccine should lessen the headaches of parents and administrators frustrated by frequent school shutdowns \\u2014 there have been about 2,300 between early August and October, affecting more than 1.2 million kids \\u2014 and it should make life a bit more manageable for families with young children.\", \"Apoorva, for one, was already setting up an appointment for her 9-year-old daughter.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be such a welcome change for parents trying to navigate having only part of their family vaccinated,\\u201d Apoorva said.\", \"Side effects: Apoorva looked into the latest research on Covid vaccines and heart problems in children and found the data to be reassuring.\", \"The U.S. military has fully vaccinated roughly 87 percent of active-duty troops since it announced its vaccine mandate two months ago.\", \"How did it achieve such a high number? \", \"By rejecting requests for religious exemptions, my colleague Jennifer Steinhauer reports.\", \"Military officials say that no one is actively discouraging members of the military from seeking an exemption based on religious beliefs. But most leaders of major religious organizations have recommended that people get the vaccine, and for anyone seeking a religious exemption from the military or the Department of Veterans Affairs, officials said they would likely have to establish a history of adherence to a religion that prohibits vaccines, among other things.\", \"The Defense Department has granted a smattering of exemptions for other reasons \\u2014 such as for people who are already leaving the military or who have certain medical issues \\u2014 though some of these exemptions may soon be reversed. It isn\\u2019t clear how many service members have requested exemptions from the vaccine \\u2014 officials would not provide those numbers \\u2014 but they did say the numbers were not large.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t see the courts interfering with the vaccines in any other context than possibly religious exemptions,\\u201d said Dorit Rubinstein Reiss, a law professor and expert on vaccine mandates at the University of California, San Francisco. \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t know if courts will be wiling to second-guess the military.\\u201d\", \"November is shaping up to be an emotional month.\", \"On Nov. 8, after more than a year and half of restrictions, vaccinated international travelers will finally be allowed back into the U.S. \\u2014 including at land borders with Canada and Mexico. The end of the ban on international visitors has kicked off a surge of travelers booking trips to the U.S.\", \"Cue the tearful reunions.\", \"As the U.S. opens up to international travel, we\\u2019d like to know: What are your reunion plans?\", \"If you\\u2019re planning to reunite with friends or relatives from abroad in the coming months, tell us what you\\u2019re planning and what this moment means to you. We may use your response in upcoming Times coverage.\", \"If you\\u2019d like to participate, you can fill out this form here.\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic.
