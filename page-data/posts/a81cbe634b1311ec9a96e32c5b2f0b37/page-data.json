group of medical researchers is closing the gap on COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant women, after collating resources on how to discuss the vaccine and frequently-asked questions tailored for pregnant women.","country":"au","create_time":"2021-11-21T21:40:50.000Z","content":"[\"Just as Australia's vaccine rollout was gathering steam, a group of medical researchers from across the country identified a concerning trend.\", \"Of the almost 400 midwives they surveyed between late March and early May, fewer\\u00a0than half felt they were receiving enough information about COVID-19 vaccination.\", \"Notably, that compared to 80 per cent of doctors who felt well-informed.\", \"At the time, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) was recommending pregnant and breastfeeding women consult with their doctor if they had comorbidities.\", \"It was not until June that ATAGI and the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RANZCOG)\\u00a0recommended all pregnant women be offered Pfizer at any stage of their pregnancy.\", \"The study's lead researcher, Zoe Bradfield, said that, while the vaccine was not available to many women at the time, it identified an important gap.\", \"She said the government was doing a great job at getting advice out to practitioners, and the public.\", \"\\\"But for them to be so good, they need to be comprehensive, and therein lies the rub,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Our resources really needed to be brief, targeted.\\u00a0We needed specific resources to the maternity sector.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Advice likened to 'a\\u00a0cold drink of water on a hot day'</div>\", \"After realising the information gap existed, the research team started working with others on a collection of resources to help practitioners.\", \"That\\u00a0included advice on how to discuss the vaccine with patients\\u00a0and frequently-asked questions tailored for pregnant women.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/e8921a9f149d85ed974ebe48d842dbfa\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Dr Zoe Bradfield says the information has been viewed by about 50,000 practitioners across the country.(Supplied: Curtin University)</div>\", \"Dr Bradfield described the resources as like \\\"a cold drink of water on a hot day\\\".\", \"\\\"They're clear, they're concise, they provide exactly the information that we need to be able to communicate to women,\\\" she said.\", \"Dr Bradfield\\u00a0estimated the resources\\u00a0had been viewed by about 50,000 practitioners across the country and said they made a meaningful impact on the vaccine rollout.\", \"\\\"Providing education to a pregnant woman around uptake of vaccination is different to how we might provide it to other general members of the public because, of course, a pregnant woman is concerned not only for her own health, but for the wellbeing of her baby,\\\" she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7aec6f1d8055c362e58b6c4f2c75e52d\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> As a result of the research, the Australian College of Midwives developed and distributed resources targeted at its members.\\u00a0(ABC News: Keane Bourke)</div>\", \"Dr Bradfield said the research would also provide an important point of comparison for research further down the track.\", \"\\\"It's been really rewarding to see the findings of our research, not just provide the benchmarking data that we need, but also to see us pivot really quickly to get the resources straight to the clinicians that need them,\\\" she said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">GPs\\u00a0leverage 'very trusted position'</div>\", \"Ramya Raman is the chair of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners in WA, and said, as someone who sees a lot of pregnant women, there was a short time at the beginning of the rollout when there was a gap in the information being made available.\", \"But, she said, the joint statement between ATAGI and RANZCOG in June was exactly what practitioners had been looking for.\", \"\\\"[It] was quite useful, short, to the point, which was released with good confidence,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"As GPs, we're placed in a wonderful position to do that, because our patients place a lot of trust in us, in coming in and having a chat with us, regarding these things.\", \"\\\"So having very clear guidelines in relation to this makes a huge difference.\\\"\", \"Dr Raman said question-and-answer style resources, which were produced by both RANZCOG and the Australian College of Midwives (ACM), were useful because they provided direct answers to questions patients ask their doctors.\", \"But, she said, that did not mean more detailed advice was useless.\", \"\\\"Short, succinct statements are very essential and important for very busy practitioners,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"So yes, it's absolutely essential and important to have both those documents, so that, if those questions arise, we can actually refer back to it and it gives us reliable, valid information.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Data unclear on pregnancy vaccination rate</div>\", \"It is not\\u00a0 clear how Australia's vaccine rollout is progressing when it comes to pregnant women.\", \"The Australian Immunisation Register only includes a person's age, sex and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander status, and not whether they are pregnant.\", \"\\\"So there is currently no comprehensive means to determine the proportion of all pregnant women vaccinated against COVID-19,\\\" a WA Health spokesperson said.\", \"\\\"Capturing data on COVID-19 vaccination among pregnant women is complicated by the fact that a\\u00a0woman may have a first dose before becoming pregnant and a second dose while pregnant, or a first dose while pregnant and a second dose after the baby has been born.\\\"\", \"Current estimates put the proportion of pregnant women fully vaccinated against COVID-19 at anywhere between 30 and 70 per cent of the population, depending on the jurisdiction.\\u00a0\", \"In the US, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\\u00a0reports\\u00a0a 35.3 per cent double-dose rate among pregnant women.\", \"Those rates are concerning for researchers such as\\u00a0Dr Bradfield, who said the message was simple.\", \"\\\"Pregnant people are a priority group for vaccination, and they're recommended to be vaccinated as soon as possible,\\\" she said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Vaccine perceptions held by\\u00a0midwives important</div>\", \"Joanne Gray is the president of the ACM and has been among those leading efforts to get as many pregnant women vaccinated as possible.\", \"\\\"We know that, when pregnant women get infected with COVID, they become very unwell,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"It does cause potential harm to their unborn baby, and it can lead to complications that are quite serious, more so than the general population.\\\"\", \"She said the study was also important because it identified the motivations of both professionals and expectant mothers.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/537c1628a96efa24369976eb452c2bd0\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Dr Joanne Gray says it is important to understand midwives' understanding to deliver the right information.(Supplied: University of Technology Sydney.)</div>\", \"\\\"We know that women, they seek information when they're pregnant,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"If we were able to have midwives have the knowledge to deliver to women, to answer the very questions they were asking, then we knew we were in a better position to be able to assist that woman to come to a decision around vaccination.\\\"\", \"Professor Gray said it was also significant that the researchers could understand the factors making midwives and other practitioners hesitant at that stage of the rollout.\", \"\\\"So the importance of this research was understanding the perceptions of midwives and then the information that they were likely to give women.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'We talked about the numbers'</div>\", \"Cindy Asselman's baby boy was only six weeks old when she decided to get vaccinated with AstraZeneca in Melbourne.\", \"She said she was not concerned by reports of a rare blood-clotting disorder, but said it was still reassuring to be able to talk the decision through with her GP.\", \"\\\"I was probably three-quarters of the way there anyway, and just wanted the chat because it was advised to talk to your doctor about it,\\\" she said.\", \"<img

birth to get vaccinated, but wasn't put off by rare side effects of the AstraZeneca vaccine.(Supplied: Cindy Asselman)</div>\", \"\\\"There were risks, we talked about that, we talked about the numbers.\", \"\\\"She gave me that information for me to go away and make that decision myself.\\\"\", \"Ultimately, Ms Asselman said, it was helpful to have a doctor who felt confident making the recommendation.\", \"\\\"So it was just a really quick discussion with my GP,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"I just sort of asked her if she thought it was a good idea, and yes, she did.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Reputable source key to decision-making</div>\", \"Kirsty Suffield was 38 weeks' pregnant when she made the decision to get her first dose of Pfizer.\", \"With her partner, she had spent the last six-and-a-half years trying for a baby using IVF.\", \"\\\"After spending so much time and money and emotions just getting the pregnancy, we were always going to be risk-averse,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"While the case number numbers were really low in Melbourne, I guess I held off for a bit in getting the vaccine because \\u2026 it was that sort of apprehension in the back of my mind, versus doing nothing at all and feeling relatively safe at home.\\\"\", \"But a number of factors combined, including rising case numbers, media reports of pregnant women being hospitalised\\u00a0and conversations with health professionals.\", \"\\\"It was always a risk-versus-benefits, and also the risk of not being vaccinated as well and seeing that there were a number of pregnant women in ICU on ventilators, things like that, that was obviously a fairly big motivator.\", \"\\\"But\\u00a0coming from a reputable source was very important.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"a81cbe634b1311ec9a96e32c5b2f0b37"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a81cbe634b1311ec9a96e32c5b2f0b37"}},
