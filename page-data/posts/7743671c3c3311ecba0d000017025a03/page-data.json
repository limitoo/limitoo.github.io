growing concerns about the technology and its misuse.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"This change will represent one of the largest shifts in facial recognition usage in the technology's history,\\\" Jerome Pesenti, vice-president of artificial intelligence for Facebook's new parent company, Meta, wrote in a blog post.\", \"Mr Pesenti\\u00a0said the company was trying to weigh the positive use cases for the technology \\\"against growing societal concerns, especially as regulators have yet to provide clear rules\\\".\", \"<img

Facebook as it faces heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny.\\u00a0(AP:\\u00a0Mark Lennihan)</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Ethics of technology in spotlight</div>\", \"The removal of face recognition by the world's largest social media platform came after the industry faced a reckoning in recent years over the ethics of using the technology.\", \"Critics say facial recognition technology,\\u00a0which is popular among retailers, hospitals and other businesses for security purposes, could compromise privacy, target marginalised groups and normalise intrusive surveillance.\", \"IBM has permanently ended facial recognition product sales, while Microsoft and Amazon have suspended sales to police indefinitely.\", \"Facebook's face-recognition system was introduced more than a decade ago and more than a third of the social network's daily active users have opted to have their faces recognised by the software.\", \"But the system has long been the subject of scrutiny.\\u00a0\", \"In 2019, the US Federal Trade Commission included it among its concerns when it fined Facebook $US5 billion ($6.75 billion) to settle privacy complaints.\", \"The company subsequently ended its practice of using the software to identify users' friends in uploaded photos and automatically suggest\\u00a0they 'tag'\\u00a0them.\", \"A US judge this year approved Facebook's $US650 million ($875 million) settlement of a class action in Illinois over allegations it collected and stored biometric data of users without proper consent.\", \"The decision to scrap the software\\u00a0comes as the social media giant faces both a public relations crisis and heightened legislative and regulatory scrutiny over leaked documents dubbed the Facebook Papers.\", \"The documents support claims the social network\\u00a0has prioritised financial success over user safety.\", \"The company\\u00a0last week renamed itself Meta\\u00a0to focus on building technology for what it envisions as the next iteration of the internet, the 'metaverse'.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/75f8bc286f1d6c84ad19f1c2243bacd9\\\"

announcement.\\u00a0\", \"The decision was \\\"a good example of trying to make product decisions that are good for the user and the company\\\", said Kristen Martin, a professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame.\", \"She said the move also demonstrates the power of regulatory pressure, since the face recognition system had been the subject of harsh criticism for over a decade.\", \"Alan Butler, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said \\\"for far too long Internet users have suffered personal data abuses at the whims of Facebook and other platforms\\\".\\u00a0\", \"Adam Schwartz from the Electronic Frontier Foundation said although Facebook's action came after moves from other tech companies, it could mark a \\\"notable moment in the national turning away from face recognition\\\".\", \"But\\u00a0Meta Platforms Inc, Facebook's parent company, appears to be looking at new forms of identifying people.\", \"Mr Pesenti said Tuesday's announcement involved a \\\"company-wide move away from this kind of broad identification, and toward narrower forms of personal authentication\\\".\", \"The company did not rule out using facial recognition technology in other products, saying it still saw it as a \\\"powerful tool\\\", for identity verification for example.\", \"\\\"Facial recognition can be particularly valuable when the technology operates privately on a person's own devices,\\\" he wrote.\",
