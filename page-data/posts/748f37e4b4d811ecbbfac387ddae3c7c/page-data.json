He's not facing a homicide charge.\", \"Investigators say they don't know if the attack was targeted or if there was an exchange of gunfire or if the attack was gang-related.\", \"Police say they believe Martin is one of several shooters, CBS Sacramento points out.\", \"\\\"As far as his exact role,\\\" Sgt. Zach Eaton said, \\\"the investigators are still working into where he fits into the actual shooting.\\\"\", \"Investigators say they're not sure if he allegedly shot first or shot back after someone else opened fire.\", \"A social media post dated after the shooting Sunday on a profile matching Martin's description and name said \\\"SMH I'm hit.\\\" Several in the comments asked if he was OK, CBS Sacramento notes.
