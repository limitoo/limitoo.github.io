I probably spend about 20 percent of my time in the kitchen thinking about how much better life would be if I had a new stove. A different stove, at any rate, one without balking burners and rusting-through grate supporters, one without pinholes in the oven floor, one where if you set the temperature to 400, it\\u2019s 400, not 475 or 350, depending on the phase of the moon.\", \"It\\u2019d be great to be able to simmer a sauce \\u2014 really simmer it, on the lowest of heats. Likewise to get a pan screaming hot. The other day I saw flames licking out of a space on the stovetop where that should not be happening. It\\u2019d be great not to see that at any time.\", \"On the other hand, I know this stove well in its strengths and weaknesses, and I\\u2019ve cooked a gajillion great meals on it. I\\u2019ve felt the same about every stove I\\u2019ve ever used regularly, gas or electric, new or very old: could be better, but it\\u2019s mine and I use it to the best of my and its abilities.\", \"Maybe you feel similarly, at least some of the time? Here are some great recipes for a not-great stove. I like these instructions for pork chops in cherry-pepper sauce (above) for the way they don\\u2019t require much in the way of temperature extremes. It\\u2019s a forgiving recipe. Same deal for this soup joumou and this fabulous preparation of long-cooked broccoli. Three-cup chicken and three-cup vegetables, same.\", \"These peanut butter and miso cookies are tolerant of my oven. So is Laurie Colwin\\u2019s roast chicken and this potato and radicchio tart.\", \"I love a one-pot pasta with ricotta and lemon on my wonky old stove, too, as I do this Spanish-style lamb stew. Also, this sweet potato and garlic soup with chile oil. And always, always, chicken Proven\\u00e7al.\", \"Thousands and thousands more recipes to cook on whatever stove stands in your kitchen are compiled on New York Times Cooking.
