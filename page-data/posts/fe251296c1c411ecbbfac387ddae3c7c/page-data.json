General manager of sales and marketing Rick Walker said frozen meat makes up the majority of its exports to China but demand for chilled and fresh meat is growing.\", \"\\\"Touch wood, we have not had any issues with fresh and chilled products getting into China but obviously it's a concern so we are looking at pulling back on how much we are sending. We're really having to micromanage the situation.\\\"\", \"He said China was ANZCO's major market and with ongoing order commitments the company had not diverted product to other markets.\", \"\\\"We are talking to our customers all the time and we are looking at moving more product to other ports in China. The issue there is that everyone is trying to do the same so it becomes a domino effect.\", \"\\\"But we're confident that we can work our way through this. We're watching it very, very closely, we're constantly looking at our production plans, looking at our supply chain challenges and determining what the best fit is.\\\"\", \"Walker said the delays caused by Shanghai's lockdown were making exporting meat more expensive.\", \"\\\"It does add additional cost in terms of just managing the supply chain. Shipments are slower which means we're storing product for longer here to make sure we can get it on containers and get it on the boats to move them out of New Zealand.\", \"\\\"And then there's the value chain as well. Your customers don't pay for that product until they see it arrive and they can clear that product. So that just slows cashflow.\", \"\\\"If it takes a while to clear the backlog at Shanghai Port which we are expecting it will do - it will delay the value chain in terms of money coming back into our bank account.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"fe251296c1c411ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fe251296c1c411ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
