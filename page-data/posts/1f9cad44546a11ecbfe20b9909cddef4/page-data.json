It depends. Hereâ€™s what you need to know.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-03T10:53:01.000Z","content":"[\"While the pandemic has depressed travel, it may have encouraged travel insurance, say those in the industry.\", \"\\u201cThe biggest question we get from customers is: \\u2018What happens if I get Covid during travel and what if I have to quarantine?\\u2019\\u201d said Jeremy Murchland, the president of Seven Corners, a travel insurance management company. \\u201cCovid has created a much broader awareness of travel insurance.\\u201d\", \"But will it help you in light of the new Omicron variant, which has already led to new travel restrictions and requirements? In the early days of the pandemic, travel insurance largely failed to protect travelers who wanted or needed to cancel as the world shut down. The following are answers to common questions about travel insurance now.\", \"For the most part, yes, travel insurance policies now treat Covid-19 in all its variants \\u2014 including Omicron \\u2014 like any other medical emergency.\", \"\\u201cConsumers should know that most travel insurance plans with medical benefits now treat Covid like any other illness that you could contract while traveling or that could prohibit you from going on your trip,\\u201d said Carol Mueller, a vice president of Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection. \\u201cIf you become ill before your trip, you\\u2019ll need a doctor\\u2019s note confirming your illness and that you are unable to travel in order to be eligible for benefits. The benefits are the same regardless of whether you contract Omicron, another variant of Covid or any illness for that matter.\\u201d\", \"Buyers should read the policies carefully and look out for those that exclude pandemics, Covid-19 and its variants. To make a claim, you must have had travel insurance before becoming ill.\", \"\\u201cWe always say, you can\\u2019t buy auto insurance after you\\u2019ve already had an accident,\\u201d said Meghan Walch, the product manager of InsureMyTrip, an insurance sales site. \\u201cIt is designed for unforeseen issues. You have to purchase it before an event.\\u201d\", \"No, most policies do not cover you if your foreign destination closes its borders to visitors, as Israel did recently. With a few exceptions, that also goes for a government-issued travel warning to a destination, which is generally not a covered reason to make a claim.\", \"Cancel for Any Reason, or C.F.A.R., provisions would allow you to claim some of your nonrefundable costs if you decide not to go on a trip for any reason, including border closures or fear of contracting Covid. The rub is that this form of insurance \\u2014 in addition to being more expensive \\u2014 must generally be purchased within a day or two of booking the trip and will only return 50 to 75 percent of nonrefundable trip costs.\", \"\\u201cMost travel insurance policies do not cover you for wanting to cancel out of fear of Covid. We say this 10 times a week,\\u201d said Sarah Groen, the owner of the agency Bell and Bly Travel. She counsels clients to consider their worst fears \\u2014 illness, for example, or quarantine \\u2014 in troubleshooting travel insurance. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve become like therapists,\\u201d she said.\", \"Make sure the policy you choose covers these. In the case of medical coverage, check with your regular health insurer; many policies will not cover you abroad, which is an additional reason to consider coverage if you are traveling internationally.\", \"\\u201cWhat travel insurance can do is cover additional hotel stays if you are able to self-quarantine and additional airfare when you\\u2019re able to come home,\\u201d said Megan Moncrief, the chief marketing officer for Squaremouth, a travel insurance sales site. She added that most policies will extend to seven days past your originally scheduled return date, effectively covering only about seven days in case of quarantine.\", \"Yes, primarily to cover medical care or quarantine accommodations in the event that a traveler tests positive for Covid-19. For example, Singapore requires medical insurance with a minimum coverage of 30,000 Singapore dollars, or about $22,000. Fiji requires travel insurance to cover potential treatment for Covid-19, and makes it available from about $30. Some destinations, such as Anguilla, recommend rather than require travel insurance. InsureMyTrip.com has a page devoted to countries that require travel insurance.\", \"It bears thinking about what it would take to get home for treatment should you contract Covid-19 abroad. Thailand, for example, requires travelers to have medical insurance with the minimum coverage of $50,000. \\u201cEvacuation out of Thailand would be higher,\\u201d said Sasha Gainullin, the chief executive of Battleface, a travel insurance start-up that unbundles benefits. In the case of a Thailand trip, he advised taking medical coverage up to $100,000 for treatment locally and $500,000 for medical evacuation and repatriation.\", \"Probably not, if you have hotel reservations that allow free cancellation 24 to 48 hours in advance. The same with flights; if your flight is changeable and will provide a voucher or refund in case of cancellation, you\\u2019re covered.\", \"Yes. Vacation home rentals from Airbnb and the like can be treated just like other accommodations that do not offer refunds. In this case, you would want to get a policy in the amount you would forfeit if you had to cancel for a covered reason like illness. Again, fear of travel is not a covered reason; for that, you would need C.F.A.R.\", \"Follow New York Times Travel on Instagram, Twitter and Facebook.
