Barry told reporters that the company is seeing thefts increase across the country, but especially in San Francisco.\", \"\\\"We are definitely seeing more and more particularly organized retail crime and incidents of shrink in our locations,\\\" Barry told analysts during a conference call Tuesday. \\\"This is a real issue that hurts and scares real people.\\\"\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938985/san-francisco-louis-vuitton-theft.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Groups of thieves, some carrying crowbars and hammers, smashed glass cases and window displays, ransacking high-end stores throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, stealing jewelry, sunglasses, suitcases and other merchandise before fleeing in waiting cars during a weekend of brazen organized theft that shocked holiday shoppers and prompted concerns about the busy retail season.

Experts and law enforcement officials say the thefts are ratcheting up as the holiday shopping season gets underway.\", \"Barry said Best Buy is hiring security guards and working with its vendors on creative ways to stage the product.\", \"Yet loss prevention agents and security guards are generally trained not to engage with thieves, said mall and retail security expert David Levenberg.
