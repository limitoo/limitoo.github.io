But the perils of red tape have drawn new attention since the coronavirus pandemic left millions of Americans seeking government help, many for the first time.\", \"The government approved vast increases in spending but often struggled to deliver the assistance. While some programs reached most households quickly (stimulus checks), others buckled under soaring demand (unemployment benefits) or daunting complexity (emergency rental aid).\", \"\\u201cThe pandemic highlighted how difficult these programs can be to access,\\u201d said Pamela Herd, a professor at Georgetown and an author, with Donald P. Moynihan, of \\u201cAdministrative Burden,\\u201d which argues that excessive bureaucracy deepens poverty and inequality.\", \"The share of eligible people receiving benefits varies greatly by program: It is about 82 percent for food stamps, 78 percent for the earned-income tax credit and 24 percent for Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, or cash welfare, according to government estimates. That means billions of dollars go unclaimed.\", \"On his first day in office, President Biden issued an executive order asking agencies to identify \\u201csystemic barriers in accessing benefits,\\u201d with the results due in January.\", \"Shaped by forces as diverse as the tech revolution, welfare rights and behavioral psychology, the movement to create a more user-friendly safety net was underway before the pandemic underscored the perils of bureaucracy.\", \"Code for America, a nonprofit group, spent years devising a portal that makes it easier for Californians to apply for food stamps. Civilla, a Detroit-based nonprofit, helped Michigan shrink its 42-page application by 60 percent.\", \"In an age of ambitious social movements, the cry of civic tech \\u2014 power to the portals \\u2014 may seem obscure, but Mr. Chen, 34, says democratizing technology\\u2019s rewards is essential to social justice.\", \"\\u201cFor someone like me, a phone is like a magic wand,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf I want to call a cab, there\\u2019s an app; if I want to book a hotel, there\\u2019s an app; if I want to get a date, there\\u2019s an app. It\\u2019s just incredibly unfair that we don\\u2019t apply more of this sophisticated knowledge to the problems of lower-income Americans.\\u201d\", \"Among those drawn to the app \\u2014 recently renamed Providers, from Fresh EBT \\u2014 is Kimberly Wilson, a single mother in Spindale, N.C., who has a 7-year-old son and cleans vacation rental homes. With her work interrupted by the pandemic, she turned to food stamps, which is also known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP.\", \"What Ms. Wilson said she likes most about the SNAP app is the ability to instantly check her balance, which she does almost daily. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a comfort knowing I\\u2019m going to be able to feed my kid,\\u201d she said.\", \"The app also explains the timing and amounts of her payments better than the state, she said, and it steered her to a broadband subsidy that saved $50 a month.\", \"But the app\\u2019s rewards transcend the particulars, Ms. Wilson said: It leaves her feeling respected.\", \"\\u201cIt makes you feel like it\\u2019s normal to need help,\\u201d she said, which is especially welcome because she has relatives who post memes depicting people on SNAP as lazy and overfed. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like somebody behind the screen is looking out for us. You feel like they care.\\u201d\", \"Andrea Young, a Providers user in Charlotte, N.C., goes as far as to say the app \\u201cmakes us feel like we\\u2019re Americans, too.\\u201d\", \"With 42 million Americans receiving SNAP, many conservatives dispute the notion that aid is elusive. They see dependency as a greater concern than red tape and argue that administrative contact serves important goals, like deterring people who do not really need help or letting caseworkers encourage the jobless to find work.\", \"\\u201cThe system should be striving to help individuals achieve self-sufficiency through employment\\u201d rather than maximize benefits, said Jason Turner, who runs the Secretaries Innovation Group, which advises conservative states on aid policy. \\u201cWhen you pile benefit on top of benefit, you make it harder to break free.\\u201d\", \"Poverty has long been linked to oppressive bureaucracy. \\u201cLittle Dorrit,\\u201d the 1857 novel by Charles Dickens, lampoons the omnipotent \\u201cDepartment of Circumlocution,\\u201d whose stupefying procedures keep the heroine down. The 1975 documentary film \\u201cWelfare\\u201d offers a modern parallel with footage that one critic called \\u201cunbearable in its depictions of frustration and anger\\u201d among caseworkers and clients.\", \"Sometimes barriers to aid are created deliberately. When Florida\\u2019s unemployment system proved unresponsive at the start of the pandemic, Gov. Ron DeSantis told CBS Miami last year that his predecessor\\u2019s administration devised it to drive people away. \\u201cIt was, \\u2018Let\\u2019s put as many kind of pointless roadblocks along the way, so people just say, oh, the hell with it, I\\u2019m not going to do that,\\u2019\\u201d he said. (Mr. DeSantis and his predecessor, Rick Scott, are both Republicans.)\", \"Other programs are hindered by inadequate staffing and technology simply because the poor people they serve lack political clout. Historically, administrative hurdles have been tools of racial discrimination. And federal oversight can instill caution because states risk greater penalties for aiding the ineligible than failing to help those who qualify.\", \"To show that Michigan\\u2019s application was overly complex, Civilla essentially turned to theater, walking officials through an exhibit with fake clients and piped-in office sounds meant to trace an application\\u2019s bureaucratic journey. Working with the state, the company created a new application with 80 percent fewer words; the firm is now working in Missouri.\", \"Michael Brennan, Civilla\\u2019s co-founder, emphasized that the Michigan work was bipartisan \\u2014 it began under a Republican governor and continued under a Democrat \\u2014 and saves time for the client and the state.\", \"\\u201cChange is possible,\\u201d he said.\", \"With its California portal, Code for America cut the time it took to apply for food stamps by three-quarters or more. The portal was optimized for mobile phones, which is how many poor people use the internet, and it offers chat functions in English, Spanish and Chinese. In counties with the technology, applications increased by 11 percent, while elsewhere the number fell slightly.\", \"During the pandemic, Code for America built portals to help poor households claim stimulus checks and the expanded child tax credit. The latter alone delivered nearly $400 million. David Newville, who oversaw the work, quoted a colleague to explain why web design matters: \\u201cImplementation is justice.\\u201d\", \"As the son of struggling immigrants from China, Mr. Chen, the founder of Propel, understood hardship before he understood technology. \\u201cThere wasn\\u2019t always enough to eat\\u201d in an otherwise happy Kansas City childhood, he said. (The family did not receive SNAP, though Mr. Chen does not know why.) He graduated from Stanford, worked at Facebook and left at 26 for a fellowship in New York, hoping to produce software for people in poverty.\", \"Mr. Chen founded Propel in 2014 with $11,000 from a Kickstarter campaign, pitched about 60 investors without success and went two years without a salary. After planning to work on SNAP applications, he shifted to focus on people who were already enrolled and developed the balance display.\", \"The existing technology did allow people to check their balances, but it did not work well on mobile phones, and a phone line required a 16-digit number. While studying how poor people shop, Mr. Chen saw them buy cheap items \\u2014 often a banana \\u2014 to check the balance on their receipts. It struck him as \\u201cdisrespectful,\\u201d one more hassle that they did not need.\", \"In tech terms, a balance display was no special feat, but reaching SNAP recipients was. Mr. Chen said the app\\u2019s users checked it on average 17 times a month. Ms. Young, 54, said she checked it more frequently than that.\", \"\\u201cI check it all day, every day,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt makes me reassured, knowing that I\\u2019m going to have food.\\u201d Ms. Young, who gets by on a disability payment of about $800 a month after injuring her back, said she had run out of funds at the register; discarding items while others watched \\u201cmakes you feel like you\\u2019re just pitiful.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Wilson is so concerned about her balance that she keeps it in her head: It was $14.02 the other day.\", \"While the app does not let users talk to each other, she said it still created a sense of belonging among those who felt stigmatized. \\u201cIt just made me see there were a whole group of people out there in the same circumstance,\\u201d she said.\", \"The app also tells people how much they have spent and where they spent it; offers recipes and budgeting tools; and provides news about other benefits. It generates revenue by selling ads, often to grocers offering discounts or employers offering jobs; Mr. Chen said the goal was to align the company\\u2019s financial interests with those of its users.\", \"In early 2016, the app had a few thousand users. A year later, it had about 200,000. Propel landed investments from Andreessen Horowitz, a top venture capital firm, and the sports stars Kevin Durant and Serena Williams. Forbes estimated that the company was worth $100 million, a sum that Mr. Chen called \\u201cnot far off.\\u201d\", \"Partnering with a charity, Give Directly, during the pandemic, Propel distributed $180 million to randomly selected app users, offering them $1,000 each. It also moved into advocacy, adding a feature that lets users ask their members of Congress to extend the temporary child tax credit expansion.\", \" The app now offers an account that can receive paychecks and other government benefits, prompted in part by the difficulties that the poorest households experienced in collecting stimulus checks, because they often lack stable bank accounts.\", \"However they make ends meet, Mr. Chen said, poor people should know where they stand without having to buy a banana.\", \"\\u201cWe pay hundreds of billions of dollars to fund these programs,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWhy not make them work well?\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f1117382584811ec89f497f9aa3641ea"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f1117382584811ec89f497f9aa3641ea"}},
