Older detainees were six times as likely to die while incarcerated as younger ones. And they had little access to the specialized care they needed.\", \"Now Dr. Bedard is the director of Geriatrics and Complex Care Services for New York City\\u2019s jail system and is perhaps the only dedicated jail-based geriatrician in the country. She and her colleagues, who work with patients\\u2019 lawyers to coordinate their care with the courts, have secured the compassionate release of more than 150 gravely ill detainees.\", \"Last month, Dr. Bedard spoke with The New York Times. The following interview has been edited and condensed.\", \"Q. What is a typical workday for you?\", \"A. There are eight functioning jails on Rikers Island, and each has a clinical space. Like a primary care office, we have scheduled appointments. And we see people with urgent care issues. There is also an infirmary where we have the 110 sickest folks. It\\u2019s much closer to a nursing home, where nurses and doctors can walk around to somebody\\u2019s bed. I will go there and talk to the primary care providers and say, \\u201cWho are you worried about?\\u201d And then I can see those folks.\", \"How closely do you work with detainees\\u2019 family members?\", \"Quite a bit. It\\u2019s critical that people are in touch with their loved ones when they\\u2019re seriously ill, but jail makes that very hard; just the fact that family members can\\u2019t call their incarcerated loved ones directly is a huge barrier. We\\u2019ll advocate for families to have expanded access to people who are hospitalized and very ill. And we are in touch with families a lot when making re-entry plans.\", \"Are your patients\\u2019 stays in jail generally brief?\", \"They should be, but they\\u2019re not. Remember that it\\u2019s not prison: The vast majority of our folks are in pretrial detention, which means that their arrest was relatively recent. The idea is that they\\u2019re going to have their speedy trial and they\\u2019re either going to be sentenced or released.\", \"In practice, however, we have tons of folks who stay for months or even years. And people who are older actually tend to stay longer than their younger counterparts, in part for reasons having to do with their poor health. For example, when people are sick or hospitalized, they miss court dates. We also see this issue where the courts are uncomfortable with an older person going back to the community without a plan that they think is safe for them.\", \"Can you give an example of what can happen?\", \"One of my first cases was a guy in his early 80s. It was his first arrest since he had been a very young man. He had pretty significant dementia and had hurt a family member. When the family called the police, the police arrested him rather than taking him to the hospital, and he was sent to jail.\", \"Everybody lamented this outcome. The courts didn\\u2019t want to sentence this guy to prison, but they also felt that he wasn\\u2019t safe to go home to his family. So they wanted him to go to a nursing home, and it\\u2019s very hard to get people from jail directly into nursing homes. So this guy got stuck for three years in pretrial detention while we tried to figure out a discharge plan.\", \"How is providing health care in a correctional setting different?\", \"Jails and prisons are places where interactions between staff and patients are fundamentally characterized by mistrust. People don\\u2019t get to choose who their provider is. They don\\u2019t get to control when they\\u2019re seen or how they\\u2019re seen. So, the entire interaction starts from a place where you are representing a system that is oppressing them, and they need something from you and don\\u2019t trust that you\\u2019re going to be able to deliver it.\", \"Do the circumstances limit what you can offer clinically?\", \"There\\u2019s this tension \\u2014 this potential dual loyalty \\u2014 where on the one hand, as physicians our primary concern is for our patients, and on the other hand, we work within a system that has different priorities around security and safety.\", \"I take care of people with advanced illness who sometimes have significant pain, like an advanced cancer. In the community, if I was that person\\u2019s hospice doctor, I would likely be prescribing them opioids that could be available to them as frequently as every two hours and that could be escalating in dose. In the jail setting, people can\\u2019t just walk around with oxycodone in their pocket.\", \"You\\u2019ve voiced support for legislation that would make people 55 and over who have served 15 years of their sentence eligible for parole.\", \"I\\u2019ve had this incredibly intimate exposure to what it\\u2019s like for older people to be incarcerated. I carry a greater sense than most people do of their suffering, which is acute and extensive, and also of what it means about us as a society that we are willing to keep 85-year-olds in chains. That doesn\\u2019t feel like the world I want to live in.\", \"The other side of this coin is a public safety question. And the data are incredibly clear that recidivism rates for people who have served over a decade in prison and who are older are very, very low.\", \"You took this job because of the city\\u2019s shift to a public, independent provider of correctional health care. What has been the impact of that change?\", \"In 2019, New York City had three in-custody deaths. This was the lowest in-custody mortality rate for any jail system in the country, and the lowest in New York City\\u2019s history. More than anything, that was a testament to the suicide prevention efforts, the overdose prevention efforts that my colleagues have done.\", \"But this year, at least 14 people in New York City jails have died so far, including three aged 55 or older.\", \"Correctional health alone can\\u2019t mitigate all of the harms of incarceration when security is not functional.\", \"We are practicing, fundamentally, in an environment that puts people at risk: Jails are incredibly dangerous places where you are concentrating folks who are in crisis. And harm reduction can only go so far if the situation\\u2019s dangerousness escalates. So my perspective on the last year has been that as the relative dangerousness of being incarcerated in New York has escalated, correctional health\\u2019s ability to mitigate that has been compromised.\"]","href_hash":"3ea69cd043a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3ea69cd043a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}},
