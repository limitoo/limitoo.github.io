But after Rodgers tested positive for the virus earlier this week, the NFL Network and ESPN reported that sources told them Rodgers was not vaccinated against the virus as members of the public previously thought.\", \"While a person who recovers from a COVID-19 infection is believed to have some level of immunity to protect them from re-infection, the CDC released a study last month that indicated vaccination provided better protection than an immune response fueled only by a prior infection.\", \"The CDC recommends all eligible individuals get vaccinated against COVID-19 regardless of whether they've tested positive for it in the past.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926622/cdc-immunized-versus-vaccinated.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The CDC defines being \\\"immunized\\\" slightly differently than it does being \\\"vaccinated,\\\" though the agency notes the terms are often used interchangeably.
