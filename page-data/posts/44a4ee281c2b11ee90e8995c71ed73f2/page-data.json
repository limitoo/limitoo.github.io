I don't think anybody is going to begrudge someone the birth of their child, so we are fully supportive on that one. We know what we're going to do if he doesn't come, so I'm just going to give him every chance.

I want Parramatta to have to think about it.\\\"\", \"Webster said Johnson's resurgence has been a key to the sides success this season.\", \"\\\"Shaun's a quality player. He's been one of our best, if not our best but we've got to plan for both scenarios.
