Last week, Neil Young and Joni Mitchell \\u2014 two musical icons whose cultural influence is far greater than their streaming numbers \\u2014 removed their music from Spotify to protest the platform\\u2019s support of Rogan.\", \"\\u201cWe know we have a critical role to play in supporting creator expression while balancing it with the safety of our users,\\u201d the CEO, Daniel Ek, who is also one of Spotify\\u2019s founders, wrote in a public letter. \\u201cIn that role, it is important to me that we don\\u2019t take on the position of being content censor while also making sure that there are rules in place and consequences for those who violate them.\\u201d\", \"Ek made no specific mention of Rogan, who has drawn complaints for his interviews with vaccine skeptics. This month, a group of more than 200 professors and public health officials called on Spotify to remove a recent episode featuring Dr. Robert Malone, an infectious-disease expert, that included \\u201cseveral falsehoods about Covid-19 vaccines,\\u201d according to the experts\\u2019 letter.\", \"Last week, Young and Mitchell cited those complaints when removing their music from Spotify, sparking debate throughout the music industry about what role artists can have in deciding where their music is heard. Young called Spotify \\u201cthe home of life threatening Covid misinformation\\u201d; Mitchell wrote, \\u201cIrresponsible people are spreading lies that are costing people their lives.\\u201d In response, many users have swarmed social media to show support for Young and Mitchell and to say they were canceling their subscriptions to Spotify, though the service has not said how many accounts were canceled.\", \"More widely, the issue has also ignited new debate over questions about free speech on the internet, and about political polarization in the coronavirus era. Technology and social media platforms, like Facebook, YouTube and Twitter, have been widely accused of playing a prominent role in spreading untruths about the disease and its vaccines. But free speech advocates have also defended those outlets for allowing open debate, and services like Facebook and YouTube have touted their records of taking down what they view as clear misinformation.\", \"Ek said that Spotify would add a \\u201ccontent advisory\\u201d notice to any podcast episode that includes a discussion about the coronavirus, directing listeners to a \\u201cCovid-19 hub\\u201d with facts and information. That hub includes links to health authorities like the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as podcasts from news sources like the BBC, CNN and ABC News.\", \"Ek also wrote that for the first time, the service is publishing its platform rules, which address dangerous, deceptive, sensitive and illegal content. Among them are rules barring \\u201ccontent that promotes dangerous false or dangerous deceptive medical information that may cause offline harm or poses a direct threat to public health,\\u201d including denial of the existence of Covid-19 or that \\u201cpromoting or suggesting that vaccines approved by local health authorities are designed to cause death.\\u201d\", \"On Wednesday, when Spotify began removing Young\\u2019s music, the company said that it has \\u201cremoved over 20,000 podcast episodes related to Covid since the start of the pandemic.\\u201d Rogan\\u2019s episode with Dr. Malone remains available on Spotify.\"]","href_hash":"77756cb0821711ecb441894e12bc1781"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"77756cb0821711ecb441894e12bc1781"}},
