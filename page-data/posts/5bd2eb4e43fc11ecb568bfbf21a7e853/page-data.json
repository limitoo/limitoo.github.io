The first week after daylight saving time ends is always a bit disorienting, isn\\u2019t it? Days feel abbreviated, it\\u2019s always dinnertime again.\", \"This weekend, the shorter days will start to feel more comfortable. Settle in. Try one of the new black-and-white films that our critics recommend: \\u201cPassing,\\u201d \\u201can anguished story of identity and belonging\\u201d adapted by Rebecca Hall from Nella Larsen\\u2019s 1929 novel, or Kenneth Branagh\\u2019s \\u201cBelfast,\\u201d a \\u201ccinematic memoir\\u201d of growing up in Northern Ireland. (\\u201cPassing\\u201d is on Netflix; \\u201cBelfast\\u201d is only in theaters.)\", \"\\u201cYellowjackets,\\u201d about a girls\\u2019 soccer team whose plane crashes in the Canadian wilderness en route to a tournament, premieres on Showtime on Sunday. I\\u2019ll definitely be tuning in for \\u201ca shivery synthesis of folk horror, survival story and then-and-now mystery.\\u201d\", \"If you\\u2019re firming up holiday travel, I sincerely hope you don\\u2019t spend 275 minutes \\u2014 or, really, any minutes \\u2014 on hold with airline customer service this weekend. Better you consider Padma Lakshmi\\u2019s slow-roasted turkey recipe, or gather ingredients for some of our vegetarian side dishes. Eric Asimov will help you select wines for the feast.\", \"Are you looking forward to the holidays? Dreading them? Watching them approach with indifference? Tell us: athome@nytimes.com.
