lead trainer for the Canberra Alliance for Harm Minimisation and Advocacy's (CAHMA) naloxone program.\", \"The program is funded by the ACT government, and\\u00a0supplies the family and friends of

\"Within\\u00a0the first six months of the program, up to 40 people said they\\u00a0had used their kits.\", \"And, in the 12 months to June 2021, more than 320 Canberrans were given take-home

found most opioid deaths in Australia involved prescription opioids \\u2014\\u00a0used by 3 million Australians.\", \"The study found that scaling up the take-home naloxone program to include other states, and reaching 90 per cent of people who were prescribed medium and high opioids would save over 650 lives.\", \"<img
