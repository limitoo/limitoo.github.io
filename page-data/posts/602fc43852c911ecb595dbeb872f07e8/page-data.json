Nurse said in a lawsuit that she was stopped in November 2016 when trying to leave a Walmart with groceries she said she already paid for, according to AL.com. She said she used self-checkout but the scanning device froze. Workers didn't accept her explanation and she was arrested for shoplifting. \\u00a0\", \"Her case was dismissed a year later, but then she received letters from a Florida law firm threatening a civil suit if she didn't pay $200 as a settlement, according to her lawsuit. That was more than the $48 in groceries she was accused of stealing \\u2014 11 items in all, including Christmas lights, a loaf of bread and Cap'n Crunch cereal, CBS affiliate\\u00a0WKRG reported.\\u00a0\", \"In her suit against the retail giant, filed by Mobile attorney Vince Kilborn\\u00a0in 2018, Nurse said Walmart instructed the law firm to send the letters and that she wasn't the only one receiving them.\", \"\\\"The defendants have engaged in a pattern and practice of falsely accusing innocent Alabama citizens of shoplifting and thereafter attempting to collect money from the innocently accused,\\\" the suit contended.\", \"Defense attorneys for Walmart said the practice is legal. Under Alabama law, shoplifters can be ordered to reimburse a store owner for up to\\u00a0$200. However, some of those people may have been falsely accused.\", \"\\\"At first you think, well, I'll pay it and it will all go away. But then, I'm like, I didn't do anything wrong \\u2014 why would I pay for something I didn't do?\\\" Nurse told Bill Riales, who reported on the story for\\u00a0WKRG.\\u00a0\", \"WKRG reported that the trial featured testimony that Walmart and other major retailers routinely use such settlements in states where laws allow it, and that Walmart made hundreds of millions of dollars this way in a two-year period.\", \"Defense attorneys declined to comment on the verdict to WKRG.\\u00a0\", \"In a statement released on Tuesday, a spokesperson for Walmart said the company plans to appeal the ruling.\", \"\\\"We continue to believe our associates acted appropriately. We don't believe the verdict is supported by the evidence and the damages awarded exceed what is allowed by law. We will be filing post-trial motions,\\\" the statement read in part.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"602fc43852c911ecb595dbeb872f07e8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"602fc43852c911ecb595dbeb872f07e8"}},
