What are pediatricians worrying about most right now? And how do teenage girls adjust to their changing bodies?\", \"As a gunman began firing at Oxford High School in Michigan, students and educators remembered the chilling training they received from their school\\u2019s regular active shooter drills.\", \"They barricaded doors with desks and chairs. They covered windows and then huddled silently in corners or bathroom stalls. Some armed themselves with makeshift weapons like scissors and calculators. When a pathway looked clear, they ran.\", \"Some students, like Joyeux Times, 16, praised the drills.\", \"\\u201cI think the training is helpful,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt saved a lot of students\\u2019 lives.\\u201d\", \"Yet four students died.\", \"My colleague Dana Goldstein looked into this training and the questions about it. Students at more than 95 percent of American schools practiced such drills before the pandemic. Most states require safety drills. And the school safety industry is a big business.\", \"Jaclyn Schildkraut, a professor of criminal justice at the State University of New York at Oswego, studies school lockdown drills.\", \"The drills were necessary, she said, because adolescents felt \\u201cmore prepared and more empowered. It is better to have it and not need it than need it and not have it.\\u201d\", \"But the drills may harm the mental health of students, while doing little to prevent mass shootings.\", \"\\u201cThere hasn\\u2019t been a strong body of evidence that these drills are helping,\\u201d Megan Carolan, vice president of research at the Institute for Child Success, said.\", \"In fact, some critics say, the focus on \\u201chardening\\u201d schools could detract from strategies that could actually prevent shootings from taking place. Those measures could include stricter gun laws, better threat assessment and more mental health counseling in schools to help students cope with strong emotions.\", \"\\u201cThe response was executed perfectly, yet four children were killed and multiple injuries occurred,\\u201d said Karen McDonald, the Michigan prosecutor whose office is overseeing the criminal case. \\u201cWe really can\\u2019t train ourselves out of this tragedy.\\u201d\", \"Here are other updates on the recent school shooting in Michigan:\", \"In the weeks since 5- to 11-year-olds became eligible for Covid-19 vaccines, many eager parents took their children to receive a shot. But much of the upfront demand has already been met.\", \"Doctors are now struggling to reach hesitant and undecided parents, even as they try to treat health problems that have gone unchecked during the pandemic.\", \"At the Charlotte Community Health Clinic, which serves low-income children in North Carolina, Dr. Anne Steptoe tries to approach vaccine fears with patience and understanding.\", \"Her patients \\u2014 who often have chronic medical conditions or live in crowded housing arrangements with vulnerable family members \\u2014 are among the children most in need of the shot.\", \"Yet most parents who have brought their children to the clinic over the past month have declined it. Often, parents are more focused on getting treatment for mental and physical problems that had gone unchecked for much of the pandemic.\", \"Those can be overwhelming.\", \"In the days immediately after the vaccines became available, Dr. Steptoe spoke to patients with a wide range of health challenges. One girl was sleepless and suicidal. Another was anemic. Several young boys had gained weight during the pandemic. And a 10-year-old had been experiencing asthma attacks and was using her inhalers incorrectly.\", \"Throughout it all, Dr. Steptoe answers questions about the vaccine, sometimes speaking to families two or three times before they feel ready to vaccinate their children.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s building a plane in flight,\\u201d Carolyn Allison, the clinic\\u2019s chief executive, said of its efforts to get children vaccinated. \\u201cIt may not be anti-vaccine, but \\u2018What is practical in my universe?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Details: Only five million of the 28 million children in the 5-to-11 age group \\u2014 roughly 18 percent \\u2014 have received at least one dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. \", \"K-12\", \"College\", \"In \\u201cJust Girls,\\u201d a Times Op-Doc, girls ages 14 to 17 talked candidly about their changing bodies.\", \"On puberty: \\u201cI wanted be a child, and I wanted to still have fun. But at the same time, I wanted to get older, and I wanted to get bigger.\\u201d\", \"On social anxiety: \\u201cThe whole thing going on in my mind is, like: \\u2018What are other people thinking? Are they laughing at me in their heads? Do they think I look weird? Do they think I look fat?\\u201d\", \"On catcalling: \\u201cI got mistaken for an older woman. I\\u2019m pretty sure I was hit on by a 25-year-old male. It\\u2019s crazy because at the time, I was 14.\\u201d\", \"And that\\u2019s just in the first four minutes of the 13-minute-long documentary, directed by Bronwen Parker-Rhodes.\", \"For me, the documentary was a helpful reminder \\u2014 amid all the partisan fights about school policy and parents\\u2019 fears about the pandemic \\u2014 that it\\u2019s just plain weird to be a teenager. Here\\u2019s the link to \\u201cJust Girls,\\u201d which is well worth your time.\", \"That\\u2019s it for the briefing.
