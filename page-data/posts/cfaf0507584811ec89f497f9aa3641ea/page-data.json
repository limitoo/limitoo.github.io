Indicted by a federal grand jury, they face a multitude of charges, including extortion and conspiracy to commit hostage-taking resulting in death. Yera, Ballardo and Lopez face an additional count of hostage-taking resulting in death and extortion.\", \"Six of the nine kidnapping victims allegedly were killed by the group.\", \"According to prosecutors, the group's method of kidnapping began with an abduction. The group would hold the victim at gunpoint before tying and beating them. Ring members would then contact the families of their victims and demand ransom payments, which would be claimed by an undisclosed co-conspirator in the United States.\", \"Of the six victims killed, three did not have families that were able to pay the ransom, while another three were killed despite the money being sent and processed.\", \"One incident, according to the Department of Justice, occurred when a co-conspirator traveled to a McDonald's to collect the ransom. However, the victim whose family was paying the sum was already killed. Victims, not identified in court documents, were given pseudonyms such as \\\"Victim A.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1616286/fbi-crime-wire-fraud-theft-embezzlement.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Six people in a Tijuana-based ring are accused of kidnapping nine people and demanding ransom from their families.

The victim's mother struggled to obtain the ransom money but agreed to pay the hostage takers $1,000\\\" along with the man's car for his release, according to the U.S. attorney's office.\", \"But the man was killed on the same day that his mother met with the ransom collector in Norwalk, the indictment alleged.\", \"If convicted, all members of the group face life in prison or the death penalty. They are currently being held in Mexico, with their attorney status unknown.\", \"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\"]","href_hash":"cfaf0507584811ec89f497f9aa3641ea"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cfaf0507584811ec89f497f9aa3641ea"}},
