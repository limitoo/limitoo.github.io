But in some cases, those people will still be able to isolate for what at that time will be the seven-day period if they are a contact.\\\"\", \"The list was expected to be available either this week or next, he said.\", \"The government has been accused of having \\\"commandeered\\\" supply of rapid antigen tests (RATs). But Bloomfield denies re-directing the orders that private businesses had placed, saying the government had also pre-ordered and simply asked suppliers for priority.\", \"\\\"I've asked my team to get the list of who those companies [who had pre-ordered RATs] were and how many they had ordered so we can engage directly with them over the next couple of days and just see what their needs might be right now.\", \"\\\"The challenge at the moment is getting clear information from the companies [supplying RATs] about how much and when they can deliver.\", \"\\\"I didn't exercise any specific legal power, I was in discussion with one of the companies and then my team followed up with the others and just created an expectation with them that they would fulfil the government's orders, and again this is an order that is for the entire country, including private businesses.\\\"\", \"He said they wanted to ensure they had enough RATs, not just to support critical workers, but also in phase three for use in households for diagnostic purposes.\", \"\\\"I should say over the weekend, we sent out several hundred thousand to health sector providers, GPs, M\\u0101ori and Pacific providers, so we have already got rapid antigen tests out there, ready for use, where needed.\\\"\", \"RNZ\"]","href_hash":"d8af02427e7b11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d8af02427e7b11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
