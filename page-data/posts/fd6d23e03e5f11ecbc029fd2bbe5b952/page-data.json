But this is doable if we follow through.\\u201d\", \"The first week of the climate summit saw a flurry of new climate pledges. India vowed to reach net-zero emissions by 2070, the first time it has set such a target. At least 105 countries signed an agreement to slash emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas, by 30 percent this decade. Major financial institutions said they would use their resources to fund a shift to clean energy.\", \"On paper, at least, those promises appear significant. The International Energy Agency issued an analysis on Thursday suggesting that if nations followed through on their newest climate pledges and long-term plans, the world could potentially limit global warming to 1.8 degrees Celsius, or 3.2 degrees Fahrenheit, above preindustrial levels by 2100.\", \"That would still fall considerably short of holding warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius the threshold beyond which many scientists say the planet will experience catastrophic effects from heat waves, droughts, wildfires and flooding. (The planet has already warmed 1.1 degrees.) But it would put the world much closer to that goal than before.\", \"Yet the agency\\u2019s analysis comes with huge caveats. It assumes that dozens of countries, including China, Brazil, Australia and Saudi Arabia will all fulfill their promises of reaching net zero emissions by around midcentury. Many of those nations have not still put in place concrete policies or even detailed plans to cut emissions sharply this decade and stay on track to achieve those goals.\", \"\\u201cGovernments are making bold promises for future decades, but short-term action is insufficient,\\u201d wrote Fatih Birol, executive director of the International Energy Agency.\", \"Mr. Kerry acknowledged that many of the promises being put forward at Glasgow were still only that \\u2014 promises. \\u201cThe words don\\u2019t mean enough unless they are implemented,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAll of us have seen years of frustration for promises that are made but not kept. We understand that. But I believe what is happening here is far from business as usual.\", \"\\u201cThe alternative,\\u201d he said, \\u201cis you don\\u2019t say anything, you don\\u2019t do anything, you don\\u2019t have any promises or commitments, and you\\u2019re sitting there just waiting for the deluge.\\u201d\", \"The climate summit has been overshadowed by the fact that some major leaders have not shown up in person, including President Xi Jinping of China, the world\\u2019s largest emitter of greenhouse gases, and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.\", \"But Mr. Kerry said that he was continuing to talk with representatives from both countries at Glasgow in the hopes of finding \\u201ca way to try to move forward.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAre we going to have all countries at the sufficient level we need at the end of this next week? No. And we know that,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut we do know that we could have a critical mass of countries moving in a way that keeps\\u201d the goal of 1.5 degrees \\u201calive.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"fd6d23e03e5f11ecbc029fd2bbe5b952"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fd6d23e03e5f11ecbc029fd2bbe5b952"}},
