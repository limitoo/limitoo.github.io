New boundaries for state legislative districts and for North Carolina\\u2019s 14 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives face three lawsuits filed by Democrats and voting-rights advocates in a state court in Raleigh.\", \"In a state split almost evenly between Republican and Democratic voters, the new maps give Republicans a sweeping political advantage. The new House map, for example, would all but ensure victory for G.O.P. candidates in 10 of the 14 districts, with a decent shot at winning an 11th seat.\", \"The legal struggle over the new boundaries appears to have split state judges along political lines as well. On Monday, Republicans had secured a ruling in the state Court of Appeals, which is dominated by Republican judges, upholding the March 8 primary date. The state Supreme Court, which overruled the decision, is narrowly controlled by Democratic justices.\", \"The Southern Coalition for Social Justice, which is representing the plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits, hailed the ruling as a victory for voters.\", \"\\u201cIt sends a clear message that North Carolinians deserve to cast their ballots in elections held in fair, constitutional voting districts,\\u201d Hilary Harris Klein, the group\\u2019s senior voting rights lawyer, said in a statement.\", \"Republican state legislators issued a news release calling the ruling a political power grab. \\u201cThe Democrats on the Supreme Court want districts that elect more Democrats, so they\\u2019re blocking every election in the state until they get their way,\\u201d one Republican, State Senator Ralph Hise, said.\", \"Delays in primary elections resulting from gerrymandering lawsuits are not unusual. Federal judges twice postponed the 2012 primary election in Texas as part of a redistricting dispute. North Carolina, where there have been more lawsuits over redistricting than in many other states, also has a history of postponement: The State Board of Elections ordered the 2004 primaries delayed during one of those court battles.\", \"The state Supreme Court issued a vastly expedited schedule for resolving the gerrymandering litigation, beginning with an order that the state Superior Court in Raleigh hand down an initial ruling next month. The Supreme Court also has signaled that appeals of that ruling will be accelerated as well.\", \"The order to delay primary elections seems likely to further fuel Republican outrage over Supreme Court rulings that have gone against the party\\u2019s wishes.\", \"A former state Republican Party chairman suggested last month that the justices should be impeached for a ruling in a long-running dispute over state funding for education. The legislature appears to agree and has added impeachment to its agenda for a special legislative session starting late this month.\"]","href_hash":"b6493ef6589d11ec9e2c710f6eef757c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b6493ef6589d11ec9e2c710f6eef757c"}},
