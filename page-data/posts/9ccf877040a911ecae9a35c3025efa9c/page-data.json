As the baker behind Cakes for No Occasion, she sees her offerings more as sculptures than comestible commodities: The tiered monstrosities ooze and drip. Her neon or pastel buttercream is often pocked with bulbous orbs that Belo, 38, doesn\\u2019t define as, say, truffles or cream puffs; in her decorating language, they\\u2019re simply balls, in flavors like lychee or raspberry, and they make her desserts seem not just alive but unwell. After studying painting at New York\\u2019s Grand Central Atelier, she began baking for her friends\\u2019 restaurant, Lil\\u2019 Deb\\u2019s Oasis, in Hudson, N.Y., a few years ago, then started her online business \\u2014\\u00a0each one-of-a-kind cake is sold by email from her Manhattan apartment \\u2014 in 2018 after refining an impasto style that betrays what she calls the \\u201ctight\\u201d Victorian look of traditional cakes, where lines are clean and excess frosting is swept away. \\u201cThere\\u2019s just so much caution in [that] realist style, and I felt imprisoned by it,\\u201d she says. \\u201cWith cake, I want it to explode.\\u201d\", \"Belo is part of a school of Instagram-native bakers espousing a messier, bespoke confectionary style: Among them are the self-taught Brooklyn ceramist Alli Gelles, 34, who launched Cakes4Sport last year to sell shimmering, swirling masses, and recently collaborated on hats with the outr\\u00e9 downtown fashion brand Puppets and Puppets; Hannah Mandel, a 31-year-old archivist at the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College in upstate New York, whose Forsythia Forsythia cakes are slightly less chaotic but still tend toward whimsical buttercream blobs, as well as pools of curd in tangy flavors like pineapple and blood orange; and Julie Saha, a 24-year-old vegan cheese affineur in Philadelphia, who, as @foodbebo, orients her practice less around finished products than her own spontaneous spirit of play, in which her decorating will change based on how she feels \\u2014 rarely is the final product the same as the initial concept.\", \"While their work is aesthetically distinct, these bakers are unified not only in their zany, maximalist approaches but in their rejection of their discipline\\u2019s traditions,\\u00a0whether it\\u2019s the recent fondant-covered smoothness evangelized on TV by so-called (and often male) cake bosses, or the standard fare of the suburban American bakery, where piped filigree and buttercream rosettes were popularized over the course of the 20th century. Nor are they making the naked cakes of recent rustic wedding dominance, with their carefully combed-away frosting perimeters \\u2014 in fact, what most sets these new pastry chefs apart is their complete disavowal of neatness, which has defined American cake making since the first recipes migrated from France by way of English colonists in the late 1700s. Instead, these cakes allude to the millennial childhood aesthetic of Nickelodeon slime and neon signs, of brightly beaded anklets and painted macaroni necklaces; in that way, they reflect a kind of colorful, seemingly synthetic 1990s postmodernism that has likewise influenced many of today\\u2019s rising furniture and jewelry designers.\", \"That veneer of silliness doesn\\u2019t mean, however, that these bakers shouldn\\u2019t be taken seriously. Though the cakes may seem at first glance like joyous follies, ready to topple under the weight of their own Rainbow Brite frosting, the women behind them say they\\u2019re rallying against nostalgia and perfection in part because there\\u2019s no use looking back, because things are neither clean nor ideal as a pandemic rages on and fires or floods overtake America\\u2019s coasts. We must still take sweetness where we can get it, of course, even if these cakes also provide a way of expressing rage at \\u2014\\u00a0and taking respite from\\u00a0\\u2014 the uncertainty and disappointments of the modern world. And because these bakeries are all side jobs, they provide their owners a much-needed sense of control: \\u201cI\\u2019m not beholden to someone being like, \\u2018I want a cake that looks like Cookie Monster,\\u2019\\u201d says Mandel, \\u201cbecause I get to curate what I make.\\u201d\", \"Ultimately, though, a cake\\u2019s appeal rests in its ephemerality \\u2014\\u00a0that moment before it\\u2019s cut into and forever destroyed \\u2014 particularly at a time when young artists in all mediums are reckoning with human consumption and the material waste their work may produce. \\u201cWe\\u2019re still finding pottery from whatever B.C.,\\u201d Gelles says, discussing the crumply vases she also produces. \\u201cAm I just making more incredibly permanent trash?\\u201d Yet with her cakes \\u2014\\u00a0which she describes as \\u201cgrotesque\\u201d\\u00a0\\u2014 there\\u2019s no concern that they might outlast their maker or buyer, which is partly the idea. \\u201cIt doesn\\u2019t matter, at the end of the day,\\u201d Belo says.\\u00a0\\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be eaten, and it\\u2019s going to be good.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9ccf877040a911ecae9a35c3025efa9c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9ccf877040a911ecae9a35c3025efa9c"}},
