He was depressed — then determined to return.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-08T05:17:40.000Z","content":"[\"In April, Nets center LaMarcus Aldridge was staring into the abyss. He stunned the basketball world by announcing his retirement from the N.B.A. after experiencing an irregular heartbeat during a game. Aldridge had learned during his rookie season in 2006-7 that he had Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome, which causes a rapid heartbeat, but that night in April, he said, was \\u201cone of the scariest\\u201d in his life.\", \"By his own telling, he was depressed about having his career cut short. Except it turned out that he had more basketball left in him. In the off-season, Aldridge, 36, was medically cleared to return to the N.B.A., which was almost as surprising as his retirement. He came back to the Nets.\", \"\\u201cI wanted to fight through and come back and show that I still can play this game,\\u201d he said in a recent interview, adding that he wanted to win a championship and \\u201cbe a part of something special.\\u201d\", \"The early returns have been strong. He has been one of the team\\u2019s most productive players, averaging 11.6 points and 5 rebounds on 62.9 percent shooting over nine games off the bench through the Nets\\u2019 116-103 win over the Raptors on Sunday. He recently scored his 20,000th point, making him one of seven active players to reach the milestone. Despite a basketball r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 with seven All-Star and five All-N.B.A. selections, Aldridge has never received the attention of the others in the 20,000-point club, like his teammates Kevin Durant and James Harden.\", \"In part, it is because Aldridge has largely eschewed some of the perks that come with N.B.A. stardom and has avoided the media spotlight. His best years came in Portland, where he spent the first nine years of his career. There, playing with teammates such as Brandon Roy, Greg Oden and Damian Lillard, Aldridge has said that he felt uncertain of his place in the pecking order, despite being near the top of the franchise\\u2019s career leaderboards in most categories.\", \"He surprised many by leaving Portland before the 2015-16 season for San Antonio, where he helped lead the Spurs to the Western Conference finals in 2017.\", \"In a recent interview at the Nets\\u2019 practice facility, Aldridge discussed his retirement that wasn\\u2019t, his future plans and his new lease on basketball.\", \"This interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\", \"You told The Athletic after the announcement that you were depressed after retiring. Describe to me the feelings you have now. Is there fear?\", \"No. I feel excitement, joy, to be back doing what I love to do. And to have what happened and have it taken away so quickly, and to now be back in it, I feel joy. I\\u2019m thankful. I\\u2019m enjoying every minute of it as I\\u2019m out there. No fear. I went through enough testing where fear is no factor.\", \"What was that first day of training camp like, where you\\u2019re running up and down the floor?\", \"It was exciting to be back with the group that I knew the previous year. It was exciting to show that I still can play this game. I wasn\\u2019t gone long, but I feel like people feel like I was gone for, like, a whole year, and it was like five months. I feel like everyone was like questioning, \\u201cCan he still play after retiring?\\u201d\", \"Do you remember what the first day of retirement was like?\", \"The first day didn\\u2019t feel real. The first day felt like I had an off day. And then your second day, you feel like it\\u2019s a game day, so you\\u2019re just at home. And after like a week or two, you\\u2019re like: \\u201cMan, I\\u2019m not at the gym. I\\u2019m not with the fellas. I\\u2019m not traveling, not playing.\\u201d Like two weeks in, I was like: \\u201cMan, this is what it is. I have to find my new interest, shift my focus to something else.\\u201d That\\u2019s when it hit me, like, \\u201cMan, what\\u2019s next?\\u201d\", \"You said a couple years ago you\\u2019re probably one of the most misunderstood players in the league. Do you still feel that way?\", \"Not here, no. I think as people get to know me, they realize I\\u2019m not about any drama. I\\u2019m not about any friction. I just want to be appreciated for what I do, and let\\u2019s go win. That\\u2019s all. I feel like clickbait and television, it was things that were made up over the years to make me out to be some type of person, but I\\u2019m not that person.\", \"Once I\\u2019m on your team, I\\u2019m on your side. I\\u2019m down the whole way. I\\u2019ve got your back, no matter what. And I feel like, as people have gotten to know me, they\\u2019ve seen that, so I\\u2019m not worried about that anymore. I\\u2019m the guy that would give you the shirt off my back if you needed it, and I was being painted as this selfish guy, which I\\u2019m not nowhere near that.\", \"I\\u2019ve seen you describe yourself as an introvert. I\\u2019ve seen other people describe you as quiet and reserved. But I don\\u2019t actually see that. I see you pretty chatty with teammates. Have you become more outgoing over time?\", \"This is my comfort zone. This is my safe space. We go to war together. We\\u2019re in the trenches together. We\\u2019re battling together. So then you get that extra chemistry. You get that extra connection with them. But no, they would definitely tell you, other than that, I\\u2019m pretty quiet. On the bus, I don\\u2019t really talk.\", \"You\\u2019ve talked about feeling overlooked in the past, in spite of your sterling basketball r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9, because you don\\u2019t do as much media. You don\\u2019t do the red carpet stuff. You\\u2019re not doing commercials and interviews.\", \"Introvert! [LAUGHTER]\", \"Exactly. Is there a part of you that wishes you did more of that?\", \"No. I am who I am, and I don\\u2019t have any regrets of the things I\\u2019ve done with my career as far as more cameos. When I was in \\u201cPortlandia,\\u201d that was fun. I did, like, little things that I thought would be fun for me. But no, I don\\u2019t regret that, because that\\u2019s not really my brand. I\\u2019m more about hard hat and just go to work.\", \"Chris Bosh, after he retired early, talked about how, in retirement, one of the hardest things to come to grips with is not having a full schedule anymore. And not being around teammates or cheered by fans. And the guys that were texting you every day and aren\\u2019t texting you as much because you\\u2019re not part of the crew anymore. How did you deal with that?\", \"I\\u2019m to myself more than most, so the guys not texting me didn\\u2019t affect me. I don\\u2019t really text with guys now. But the whole traveling and your schedule, you have to figure out how to do it, how to fill that void. Because if you don\\u2019t, you end up feeling lost and kind of like, \\u201cWhat\\u2019s next?\\u201d That was very, very tough.\", \"Your first week or two is tough, because you go from busy, busy, busy to just \\u2014 your phone\\u2019s quiet. Not even just from teammates. Just like, \\u201cBe at practice\\u201d or \\u201cBe at shootaround.\\u201d It goes from that to just this tranquil quietness that you could enjoy, but you\\u2019re also uncomfortable with, because you never had it.\", \"You\\u2019ve said you\\u2019ve talked to Damian Lillard about finishing your career in Portland. That seems to suggest to me that there may be some more years left after this one. Is that fair to say?\", \"I\\u2019m going year to year, but I definitely, how I feel now, how I\\u2019m moving now, I definitely have some more years in me. I feel rejuvenated, refreshed and just ready to go.\"]","href_hash":"1c99fd84405311eca5a6e36ce3599004"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1c99fd84405311eca5a6e36ce3599004"}},
