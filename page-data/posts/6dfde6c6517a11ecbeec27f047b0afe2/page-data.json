a review found the move could protect 80 per cent of hatchlings from vehicle impacts.\", \"The ban is the recommendation of the\\u00a0Yawuru Park Council, which manages conservation issues on Cable Beach and includes Yawuru native title holders, the Broome Shire and Parks and Wildlife.\", \"The Yawuru Parks coordinator with Parks and Wildlife, Wil Bennett, said the Broome Shire would\\u00a0make the final decision in coming months.\", \"\\\"The vehicle ramp closures for two months come into place in December 2022, subject to a final decision by the shire, given that it is shire land where the access ramp is,\\\" he said.\", \"The proposal is aimed at providing the greatest benefit for nesting flatback and green sea turtles, while having the minimum impact on the popular\\u00a0tradition of driving\\u00a0cars on Cable Beach.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7e7f879878b8a351275a98c61f28d8ce\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> In peak tourist season,\\u00a0Cable Beach can become a tangle of cars, tourists, locals, camels\\u00a0and dogs.(ABC News)</div>\", \"\\\"To ensure that there's still maintenance of recreational access down to the beach, we looked at targeting the closure for when most of the hatching events are taking place,\\\" Mr Bennett said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Cars versus turtles</div>\", \"Cable Beach has 25 kilometres of white sand bordered by rolling sand dunes on one side and the Indian Ocean on the other, offering spectacular sunsets that draw visitors from across Australia, and the world when international tourism is possible.\", \"So loved is Cable Beach that it regularly features in declarations of Australia's best beaches, and attracts large crowds of tourists, locals, camel rides, cars and nudists.\", \"But as the weather heats up ahead of the tropical wet season, female sea turtles start to haul themselves ashore in search of nesting locations and this is where potential problems begin.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/db5af19315c55c0d874a887ed3ecb691\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> A hatchling sea turtle

there's the risk of direct impact to a nesting turtle as well which is not what anybody wants.\\\"\", \"Of even greater concern is the impact cars can have when the hatchlings emerge seven weeks after the eggs are laid.\", \"Deep tyre tracks create significant obstacles for the tiny hatchlings as they try to reach the sea.\", \"Mr Bennett said the palm-sized baby turtles hatch with a limited supply of energy that needs to last them for their first three days before they start feeding.\", \"\\\"It leaves them with a lot less energy once they hit the water if they make it, and [then] they're at far greater risk of predation in the water.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b0bb383d35065895b7ea34eaf0dc0ae6\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

Wildlife staff have spent the past year reviewing the impact cars are having on turtles on Cable Beach and have found the overnight closure is helping the turtles.\", \"\\\"We've gone pretty deep dive into the issue, and what we've determined is that the overnight closures are a great success,\\\" Mr Bennett said.\", \"But volunteers and wildlife managers are regularly finding hatchlings trapped in the tyre tracks of cars and other vehicles.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Our recommendation was that the best way to [help the hatchlings] is\\u00a0to get the ruts off the beach, get the vehicles off the beach,\\\" Mr Bennett said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/bee3aad201a313f4571f3ba859935574\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> A flatback

December and January, with the exception of the southern most section near Gantheaume Point.\", \"Mr Bennett said this would protect the majority of hatchlings as well as many of the nesting adults.\", \"\\\"Half of all nesting events happen in December and January as well, so a full closure for those two months only, in addition to the continuation of the existing overnight closures, will give really strong protection to those hatchlings,\\\" he said.\", \"The new rules are expected to come into place from December 2022, and in the meantime Mr Bennett said people can help hatchlings by giving them plenty of space to ensure the marine reptiles continue to call Cable Beach home.\", \"\\\"Stay well away from those nests, don't walk over them, and drive below the high tide mark,\\\" he said.\"]","href_hash":"6dfde6c6517a11ecbeec27f047b0afe2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6dfde6c6517a11ecbeec27f047b0afe2"}},
