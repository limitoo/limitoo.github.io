At the moment we're sitting at first vaccine on all ethnicities at 84 percent and on second 73 percent so that doesn't cut the mustard but for M\\u0101ori in particular it's even worse.\\\"\", \"Taupo has its first case too, bringing the Lakes District tally to five.\", \"Further south, Covid-19 has invaded the Tararua District which encompasses seven towns, to the east of Palmerston North.\", \"Mayor Tracey Collis said two confirmed cases were isolating at their home in Woodville, where there are two locations of interest.\", \"\\\"Not surprised to see two towns with locations of interest there.
