It will come into effect from 8 April.\", \"\\\"We want everyone who uses our roads to get to where they're going safely. High Street is a busy road with lots of people driving, walking and cycling. It includes the town centre for Motueka, and a number of schools, homes and businesses on the way.\", \"\\\"Most crashes are caused by a number of contributing factors. But even when speed doesn't cause the crash, it is most likely to determine whether anyone is killed, injured, or walks away unharmed. A small reduction in speed can make a big difference, especially when people riding bikes or walking are involved.\\\"\", \"Red painted strips on the road will define where in the town centre the 30 kilometre per hour limit is in place.\", \"There will also be sharrow markings, enabling cyclists to take the middle of the lane through the town centre.\", \"Speight said this would prevent drivers trying to pass cyclists where the road is too narrow to pass safetly.\", \"\\\"It will also mean people on bikes are less likely to get hit by people opening car doors as they get out of their parked cars.\\\"\", \"Waka Kotahi will also install advanced stop boxes (a green box with a bike symbol in it) at both signalised intersections and signalised pedestrian crossing locations, to provide a safe stopping space in front of cars and trucks.\", \"It will make people on bikes more visible to drivers, giving them a physical head-start when the traffic signal turns green and safe opportunities to change lanes during the red phase.\", \"Waka Kotahi are working through a separate approval process to be able to install a 30km/h variable school speed limit with a 50km/h limit outside peak school times.\", \"Speight said the reduced limit in the town centre, alongside the new traffic and pedestrian signals and recently built roundabout, will help to make High Street safer for everyone, especially people walking or cycling within the busy town centre.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"2996ac3caa5a11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2996ac3caa5a11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
