Spin also has a role, as Nathan Lyon's six wickets in 2017 showed.\", \"Adelaide Oval curator Damian Hough said England would be missing a trick if they did not pick a specialist spinner.\", \"\\\"History says that the pitch will spin,\\\" Hough told reporters on the eve of the test on Wednesday.\", \"\\\"Nathan's always played a role out there. So from our end we believe that spin at Adelaide needs to play a part.\\\"\", \"This leaves England's selectors with a conundrum after spinner Jack Leach conceded 1-102 at nearly eight runs an over in Brisbane.\", \"The dilemma is compounded by the team's sluggish bowling.\", \"Even with Leach bowling in Brisbane, England failed to get through their required overs and were docked five World Test Championship points and all of their match fees.\", \"An all-seam attack would put their bowlers under more pressure to speed things along, which may be a tough ask if required to field first given the forecast for a hot opening day on Thursday and a scorching day two before a cool change.\", \"England's batters are also in the firing line after managing 147 in the first innings of the series-opener and losing eight wickets in a session on day four.\", \"Australia, by comparison, have had little to keep them awake at night.\", \"The hosts may miss the suffocating line-and-length of the sidelined Josh Hazlewood but are excited to see what replacement quick Jhye Richardson might do.\", \"Richardson has waited nearly three years since his debut series against Sri Lanka in 2019 and finally gets another chance after impressive form in the Sheffield Shield.\", \"Opener David Warner, who scored 94 at the Gabba, has a bruised rib but has been cleared to play at Adelaide where he has scored four test centuries and averages over 80.\", \"- Reuters\"]","href_hash":"c583b25c5e1a11ecabec87e1beb175d4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c583b25c5e1a11ecabec87e1beb175d4"}},
