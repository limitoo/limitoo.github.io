In the 12 states that have completed the mapping process, Republicans have gained an advantage for seats in Iowa, North Carolina, Texas and Montana, and Democrats have lost the advantage in districts in North Carolina and Iowa.\", \"All told, Republicans have added a net of five seats that the party can expect to hold while Democrats are down one. Republicans need to flip just five Democratic-held seats next year to seize a House majority.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re really taking a whack at competition,\\u201d said Michael Li, a redistricting expert at the Brennan Center for Justice. \\u201cThe path back to a majority for Democrats if they lose in 2022 has to run through states like Texas, and they\\u2019re just taking that off the table.\\u201d\", \"Competition in House races has decreased for years. In 2020, The New York Times considered just 61 of the 435 House elections to be \\u201cbattleground\\u201d contests. The trend is starkest in places like Texas, where 14 congressional districts in 2020 had a presidential vote that was separated by 10 percentage points or less. With the state\\u2019s new maps, only three are projected to be decided by a similar margin.\", \"Redistricting, which happens every 10 years, began late this summer after states received the much-delayed results of the 2020 census. The process will continue, state by state, through the winter and spring and is to be completed before the primary contests for next year\\u2019s midterm elections.\", \"In most states, the map drawing is controlled by state legislators, who often resort to far-reaching gerrymanders. Republicans have control over the redistricting process in states that represent 187 congressional seats, compared with just 84 for Democrats. The rest are to be drawn by outside panels or are in states where the two parties must agree on maps or have them decided by the courts.\", \"Gerrymandering is carried out in many ways, but the two most common forms are \\u201ccracking\\u201d and \\u201cpacking.\\u201d Cracking is when mapmakers spread a cluster of a certain type of voters \\u2014 for example, those affiliated with the opposing party \\u2014 among several districts to dilute their vote. Packing is when members of a demographic group, like Black voters, or voters in the opposing political party, are crammed into as few districts as possible.\", \"The Republican gains this year build on what was already a significant cartographic advantage. The existing maps were heavily gerrymandered by statehouse Republicans after the G.O.P.\\u2019s wave election in 2010, in a rapid escalation of the congressional map-drawing wars. This year, both parties are starting from a highly contorted map amid a zero-sum political environment. With advancements in both voter data and software, they have been able to take a more surgical approach to the process.\", \"Republicans are cautious about doing a premature victory lap in case the country\\u2019s political mood shifts again over the next year. Democrats believe that while keeping their House majority will be an uphill battle, they have a stronger chance of maintaining control in the Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris currently breaks a 50-50 tie.\", \"Republicans also argue that there could in fact be many newly competitive House districts if Mr. Biden\\u2019s approval ratings remain in the doldrums and voters replicate the G.O.P.\\u2019s successes in elections this month.\", \"Democrats, without much to brag about, accuse Republicans of being afraid of competitive elections.\", \"\\u201cFear is driving all of this,\\u201d David Pepper, a former Ohio Democratic Party chairman, said on Wednesday at a hearing to discuss a proposed map that would give Republicans 13 of the state\\u2019s 15 congressional seats. \\u201cFear of what would happen if we actually had a real democracy.\\u201d\", \"More districts are certain to shift from Democratic to Republican in the coming weeks. Republican lawmakers in Georgia and Florida will soon begin debating new maps.\", \"Several other states have completed maps for the 2020s that entrench existing Republican advantages. Republicans in Alabama and Indiana shored up G.O.P.-held congressional districts while packing their state\\u2019s pockets of Democrats into uncompetitive enclaves. In Utah, a new map eliminates a competitive district in Salt Lake City that Democrats won in 2018. Republicans have made an Oklahoma City seat much safer, while Colorado\\u2019s independent redistricting commission shored up the district of Representative Lauren Boebert, a Republican and Trump ally, so much that her leading Democratic opponent, who had raised $1.9 million, dropped out of the contest to defeat her.\", \"And in Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law a map that protects the state\\u2019s 23 Republican incumbents while adding two safely red seats, a year after the party spent $22 million to protect vulnerable House members.\", \"\\u201cThe competitive Republican seats are off the board,\\u201d said Adam Kincaid, the executive director of the National Republican Redistricting Trust, the party\\u2019s clearinghouse for designing new maps.\", \"In one of the few states where Democrats are on offense, Illinois will eliminate two Republican seats from its delegation and add one Democratic one when Gov. J.B. Pritzker signs the map that the state\\u2019s Democratic-controlled Legislature approved last month. New York is likely to add seats to the Democratic column once the party\\u2019s lawmakers complete maps next year, and Maryland Democrats may draw their state\\u2019s lone Republican congressman out of a district. \", \"Democrats in Nebraska also managed to preserve a competitive district that includes Omaha after initial Republican proposals sought to split the city in two.\", \"Calling the Republican moves an \\u201cunprecedented power grab,\\u201d Kelly Burton, the president of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, said that the G.O.P. was \\u201cnot successfully taking over the battleground\\u201d but instead \\u201cproactively and intentionally trying to remove competitive seats.\\u201d\", \"Several other states where Republicans drew advantageous districts for themselves a decade ago will now have outside commissions or courts determining their maps.\", \"Wisconsin Republicans on Thursday passed a congressional map that would shift a Democratic seat to certain Republican control, though Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, promised to veto it. Michigan and Virginia, which had gerrymandered districts, have adopted outside commissions to draw new lines. Pennsylvania has a Democratic governor certain to veto Republican maps.\", \"And it\\u2019s not clear what California\\u2019s independent commission will do when it completes the state\\u2019s process later this year.\", \"Representative Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, the chairman of House Democrats\\u2019 campaign arm, said the party still had a path to hold its majority.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve got a battlefield that we can win on; I think we are very much in the fight,\\u201d he said in an interview. \\u201cNo one is declaring victory just yet.\\u201d\", \"Still, Republicans have far more opportunities to press their advantage. G.O.P. lawmakers in New Hampshire proposed changing a congressional map largely unaltered since the 1800s to create a Republican seat. In Georgia, Republicans are set to place Representatives Lucy McBath and Carolyn Bourdeaux, Democrats who hold seats in Atlanta\\u2019s booming northern suburbs, into a single Democratic district while forming a new Republican seat.\", \"Officials in both parties are preparing for years of legal fights over the maps, with the potential for courts to order the redrawing of maps well into the decade. Lawsuits have already been filed over maps in Oregon, Alabama, North Carolina and Texas.\", \"But the legal landscape has shifted since the last redistricting cycle: The Supreme Court ruled in 2019 that federal courts were not the venue to bring lawsuits regarding partisan gerrymandering. (Lawsuits claiming racial gerrymandering under the Voting Rights Act are still an option.)\", \"\\u201cThis is always in every decade a very accelerated process in the courts, but it is even more so this year because of the four months that were lost because of the delayed release,\\u201d said Thomas A. Saenz, the president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, a group involved in multiple redistricting lawsuits. \\u201cThe question is, will the courts run out of time and allow even maps that are legally flawed to be used for one election cycle in 2022?\\u201d\", \"Among the states with completed maps, nowhere more than North Carolina represents the vigorous Republican effort to tilt the scales of redistricting in the party\\u2019s favor.\", \"Republicans who control the Legislature in North Carolina, the only state forced by courts to completely redraw its congressional maps twice since 2011 for obvious partisan gerrymandering, this month approved highly gerrymandered districts that essentially revert the state to a map similar to the ones thrown out by the courts.\", \"The map Republicans passed gives the G.O.P. an advantage in 10 of the state\\u2019s 14 congressional districts, despite a near 50-50 split in the statewide popular vote for president in 2020. Former President Donald J. Trump carried the state by 1.3 percentage points. (The current congressional breakdown is eight Republicans and five Democrats, the result of a court-ordered redrawing of the map for the 2020 election.)\", \"The map packs Democrats into three heavily blue districts around Raleigh, Durham and Charlotte, as well as one competitive district in the northeast with a significant Black voting population that would put a Black congressman, G.K. Butterfield, in danger of losing his seat.\", \"Republicans in the state argued that their redistricting process had been \\u201crace blind\\u201d because they drew maps without looking at demographic data. But the result, critics say, was even worse.\", \"\\u201cTo pretend to be race-neutral and then draw these districts that are so harmful to Black voters flies in the face of why we even have federal law,\\u201d said Allison Riggs, an executive director of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, which is suing the state. \\u201cThe process is so broken.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e9368f3045ec11ecac73019dc4e62e6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e9368f3045ec11ecac73019dc4e62e6f"}},
