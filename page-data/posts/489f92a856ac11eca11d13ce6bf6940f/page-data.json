Italy's law enforcement is able to access information on an individual's vaccination or testing status through its multitiered Green Pass.\", \"A \\\"super\\\" Green Pass, obtained through vaccination or recent recovery from the virus, is required for entry into the restricted indoor areas. People are also required to present at least a \\\"basic\\\" Green Pass, obtained through a recent negative test, to use local public transportation and check into hotels, AP reported.\", \"Dozens of police officers in Rome were stationed at transportation hubs Monday to verify travelers' Green Passes and personal identification.
