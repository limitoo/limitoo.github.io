A high positivity rate suggests a higher number of infections that aren't being detected.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Several European countries are now in the middle of their fourth wave of corona. In Denmark we are heading into our third corona wave,\\\" Health Minister Magnus Heunicke said during a televised briefing on Monday.\", \"The corona pass, which is usually presented via an app on Danes' phones, is used to verify that the holder is vaccinated or has tested negative for the coronavirus.\", \"The measure presented by the Government, which is subject to Parliamentary approval, will also require the pass to be presented for indoor gatherings over 200, such as in cinemas and museums.\", \"\\\"It can't be said clearly enough: those of you who have not been vaccinated, do so,\\\" said Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The government stands on the side of the 90 percent or so that does what one should do. The others should not destroy it for the rest.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"If the Danish government decides to declare COVID-19\\u00a0 'critical threat to society' again would unlock the ability to close schools and order masks mandates, the Financial Times reported.\", \"\\\"The move to declassify COVID-19 was never communicated as an irreversible thing,\\\" Soren Riis Paludan, professor of biomedicine at Aarhus University told the paper.\", \"\\\"The fact that cases are going up is seen by many as evidence for the argument that unvaccinated people have extra responsibility for keeping COVID-19 circulating. Therefore, reintroducing the COVID pass can also serve the purpose to force more people to get vaccinated.\\\"\", \"New Zealand's target for lifting most restrictions on movement is 90 percent of those eligible - Denmark is already at over 88 percent. The difference is we won't have our equivalent of the 'corona pass' in place until regions hit 90 percent.\\u00a0\", \"Denmark has 76 percent total coverage, compared to our 65 percent, according to Our World in Data.\\u00a0\", \"Reuters / Newshub.\", \"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"fd5127d541f811ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fd5127d541f811ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
