Mr. Baldwin, who has a home in Suffolk County, handed the phone over to the police himself, his lawyer, Aaron Dyer, said.\", \"Neither the Suffolk County police department nor the Sheriff\\u2019s office were immediately able to confirm they had received the device.\", \"According to the terms of the search agreement, officials in Suffolk County will review the phone\\u2019s communications \\u2014 including texts, emails, call records, voice mail messages, digital images and internet browser history \\u2014 between June 1 and Dec. 5 last year, and will exclude any communications with his lawyers or his wife, Hilaria, which are protected by privilege.\", \"\\u201cMr. Baldwin has a right to privacy regarding the contents of the iPhone, as well as regarding communications with his attorneys and with his spouse, which communications are protected by the attorney-client privilege and the marital communications privilege respectively,\\u201d the agreement states.\", \"The police in Suffolk County are to create a \\u201cforensic download\\u201d of the iPhone \\u201cin its entirety,\\u201d according to the agreement, before the device is returned to Mr. Baldwin.\", \"The fatal shooting occurred on Oct. 21, while Mr. Baldwin was practicing drawing an old-fashioned revolver from a shoulder holster. He had been told that the gun did not contain any live rounds, but it did, and it discharged a bullet that killed the cinematographer, Halyna Hutchins, and wounded the movie\\u2019s director, Joel Souza. Investigators looking into the shooting, and seeking to determine how a live round got into the gun, secured a search warrant for Mr. Baldwin\\u2019s phone on Dec. 16.\", \"The agreement to turn over Mr. Baldwin\\u2019s phone states that the search warrant is not enforceable in New York \\u2014 where he lives \\u2014 and that without Mr. Baldwin\\u2019s consent to search the phone, the authorities would be required to seek a separate warrant in the state. To avoid that, the agreement says, Mr. Baldwin has agreed to proceed \\u201cas if the NM Warrant had been obtained in New York.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAlec voluntarily provided his phone to the authorities this morning so they can finish their investigation,\\u201d Mr. Dyer said in a statement. \\u201cBut this matter isn\\u2019t about his phone, and there are no answers on his phone. Alec did nothing wrong.\\u201d\", \"While generally limiting their search to communications between June 1 and Dec. 5, officers will be able to access communications with Matthew Hutchins, Ms. Hutchins\\u2019s widower, and Santa Fe law enforcement officials from any date, according to the search agreement. It said that Mr. Baldwin had agreed to provide a list of telephone numbers for \\u201cindividuals and entities connected with the production of the film.\\u201d The officials \\u201cmay only extract call records for calls to or from those numbers during the relevant time period,\\u201d according to the agreement.\", \"After media outlets reported last week that the Santa Fe authorities did not have Mr. Baldwin\\u2019s phone three weeks after the warrant was granted, Mr. Baldwin posted a video on his Instagram account saying that any suggestion that he was not cooperating with investigators was \\u201ca lie.\\u201d He said that the process would take time and that the authorities \\u201chave to specify what exactly they want.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThey can\\u2019t just go through your phone and take, you know, your photos or your love letters to your wife or what have you,\\u201d Mr. Baldwin said in the video.\", \"In a television interview last month, Mr. Baldwin denied responsibility for Ms. Hutchins\\u2019s death, saying that he did not know how live rounds got onto the film set and that he did not pull the trigger before the gun went off.\", \"Before handing Mr. Baldwin the gun on set, the movie\\u2019s first assistant director, Dave Halls, called out \\u201ccold gun,\\u201d an industry term implying that a firearm does not have live rounds and is safe to use. Mr. Baldwin said in the interview that Ms. Hutchins had been instructing him on where to point the gun when it discharged.\", \"\\u201cIt is clear that he was told it was a cold gun, and was following instructions when this tragic accident occurred,\\u201d Mr. Dyer said in the statement. \\u201cThe real question that needs to be answered is how live rounds got on the set in the first place.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f80963ac756211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f80963ac756211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
