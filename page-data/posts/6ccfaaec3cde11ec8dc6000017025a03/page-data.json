Carl did a lot for New Zealand rugby and it's just a real sad situation for him to be struggling with dementia at such an early age. We've got a lot of empathy for that. I know he's been a popular character in this All Blacks environment. So, it's not nice to hear those stories.\\\"\", \"Plumtree feels terrible for Hayman and his family, but he believes World Rugby, New Zealand Rugby and the All Blacks are taking steps to reduce the number of head injuries in the game.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/268963/eight_col_John_Plumtree.jpg_16x10.jpg?1626141596\\\" alt=\\\"All Blacks assistant coach John Plumtree.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nAll Blacks assistant coach John Plumtree. \\nPhoto: Photosport\\n</div>\", \"\\\"Our laws now they really protect the head. The way that we coach, obviously the head is a protected area. If you look at the forwards coach and the defence coach and attack coach we're trying to coach perfect technique.\", \"\\\"Whether it's the high ball or a tackle situation or a breakdown, the head is a protected area. We know that [head injuries] are not good for our game and we know we have to protect our players, whether at training or during a game.\", \"Plumtree is confident the numbers of players being concussed is coming down.\", \"\\\"I hate seeing the head injuries. If you look at his tour we've been on, I don't think we've had a concussion. So, I think we're going in the right path with the way we look after our athletes. And, if you look at the stats now, hopefully they'll say there's less of it [concussion].\", \"\\\"I feel sorry for Carl and any other players that are affected.\\\"\", \"Plumtree, a former Taranaki, Hawkes Bay, Sharks and South Africa Sevens player, believes things have changed a lot in his 23 years of coaching.\", \"\\\"There's a greater awareness around it in all parts. From the top level, right down to us as coaches. We're trying to minimise accidents around the head as much as we can.\", \"\\\"We know the game is under pressure to make sure that we do that. We've got a responsibility as coaches to make sure we do that. To make sure the game is safe. We've got a responsibility to make sure that the game is safe and that parents want their kids to play.\\\"\", \"In a statement, World Rugby said they couldn't comment specifically on Hayman's case.\", \"\\\"We are saddened by the accounts of former players and their experiences. It is not easy to speak so candidly about their personal circumstances and we appreciate what it takes for them to do so.\", \"\\\"We care deeply about every member of the rugby family, which is reflected in our six point plan to further cement rugby as the most progressive sport on player welfare. This commitment has former players at its heart.\", \"\\\"We cannot comment on the specifics of any potential legal action involving nine former players in England and Wales. As we have not been contacted directly by Carl Hayman, we are not yet clear how his case relates to the current proceedings.\", \"New Zealand Rugby chief executive, former All Black Mark Robinson, who played alongside Hayman, said in a statement.\", \"\\\"As both a former teammate and CEO of New Zealand Rugby, my thoughts are first and foremost with Carl and his wh\\u0101nau. I've toured and been a part of All Blacks teams with Carl and have seen first-hand how proud he was to represent his country at the highest level. He represented the black jersey with distinction and was always up for the challenge when you played against him.\", \"\\\"It's certainly sad to hear about anyone in our rugby community who is struggling - for whatever reason. It's important to continue to stress that player safety and welfare is New Zealand Rugby's number one priority.\", \"\\\"We are committed to making rugby as safe as possible for our participants and being at the forefront globally on player welfare initiatives, from law trials at the community level, workload management in the professional game, and scientific research.\", \"\\\"The issue of the link between concussion and long-term cognitive issues is extremely complex and the science is evolving. New Zealand Rugby will continue to prioritise player welfare and making the game safer for all.\\\"\", \"-RNZ\"]","href_hash":"6ccfaaec3cde11ec8dc6000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6ccfaaec3cde11ec8dc6000017025a03"}},
