The answers do come with a caveat: There is still a lot of uncertainty about almost every aspect of the variant. As scientists learn more, I\\u2019ll continue to update you.\", \"Does Omicron spread faster than earlier variants? Yes, in all likelihood.\", \"The number of Covid cases is soaring in South Africa, for example. It\\u2019s still possible that this will be a mirage \\u2014 and that the world is confusing a more normal surge in cases with the effects of a new variant. (Surges do often happen for mysterious reasons.) But the evidence for faster spread of Omicron seems strong.\", \"\\u201cThe data out of South Africa suggest that the Omicron variant is spreading more quickly than Delta,\\u201d Janet Baseman, an epidemiologist at the University of Washington, told me. Dr. Rebecca Wurtz of the University of Minnesota said, \\u201cOmicron is more contagious.\\u201d\", \"A bigger unknown is why it\\u2019s spreading rapidly, and there are two plausible answers. The first is that Omicron is more contagious in a technical sense \\u2014 that it spreads more rapidly among people with no immunity than earlier variants did. The second is known as immune evasion; it describes the notion that vaccinated people and those who were previously infected contract Omicron more often than they contracted earlier versions of the virus.\", \"Both explanations could be true, and many scientists think they probably both are. But the facts are not clear, and one of the two explanations may turn out to be much more significant than the other. \\u201cBottom line: Not much doubt that Omicron spreads faster than Delta; we\\u2019re still not 100 percent sure why,\\u201d Dr. Robert Wachter of the University of California, San Francisco, told me.\", \"Is Omicron more severe than earlier variants? Probably not. But there is less consensus on this than the first question.\", \"Some scientists think it\\u2019s simply too early to know whether the average person who contracts Omicron becomes sicker than the average person who contracted earlier versions of the Covid virus. \\u201cIt\\u2019s all speculation at this point,\\u201d Dr. Paul Sax of Brigham and Women\\u2019s Hospital in Boston told me.\", \"Severe Covid illness often takes a week or more to develop, and the world has been aware of Omicron for less than two weeks. \\u201cWe may just not have had enough time to see severe disease develop,\\u201d Dr. Aaron Richterman of the University of Pennsylvania said. The initial studies of Omicron patients have also come disproportionately from South Africa, where the population skews young and many people were previously infected with Delta. Both groups are unlikely to get very sick.\", \"\\u201cWhat is hard to assess right now,\\u201d Jennifer Nuzzo of Johns Hopkins University said, \\u201cis how this will play out if or when older and more vulnerable people become infected.\\u201d\", \"But other scientists believe that the early signs are clearer and more positive. If anything, they say, Omicron may be milder than previous variants. Hospitalization and death rates in South Africa have not soared even as cases have. Intriguingly, patients are reporting less loss of taste and smell.\", \"Dr. David Dowdy, another Johns Hopkins epidemiologist, told me that he happened to have a close research collaboration with scientists in Tshwane, a South African city at the epicenter of the outbreak. His colleagues there have told him that hospitalizations and oxygen demand are lower than during previous waves. \\u201cI think the signs are actually extremely optimistic,\\u201d he said.\", \"You\\u2019ll hear some similar messages in these Bloomberg interviews with South African scientists. \\u201cIt\\u2019s early days, but I\\u2019m less panicked,\\u201d said Richard Friedland, the chief executive of the country\\u2019s largest network of private health care providers. \\u201cIt feels different to me on the ground.\\u201d\", \"Either way, I think it\\u2019s a mistake to assume that Omicron is more severe than earlier versions of the virus \\u2014 as people often do when they hear about a new variant. \\u201cThus far, the signals are a bit encouraging regarding the severity,\\u201d Dr. Anthony Fauci said this weekend on CNN.\", \"So are vaccinated people protected or not? The answer depends on the meaning of \\u201cprotected.\\u201d Is it protected from any Covid infection \\u2014 or from severe illness?\", \"The evidence so far suggests that Omicron may be more likely to infect vaccinated people than earlier versions of the virus, as I mentioned above. Yet there is still no sign that Omicron will cause a significant share of vaccinated people to get severe versions of Covid.\", \"\\u201cI do think vaccines will hold up, not so much for getting infections but for severe illness,\\u201d Dr. Eric Topol of Scripps Research told me. Dowdy, of Johns Hopkins, put it this way: \\u201cOur immune systems are designed to protect us from getting sick, not from getting any infection whatsoever.\\u201d\", \"The situation may be similar for unvaccinated people who have had a prior infection \\u2014 or they may be more vulnerable than the vaccinated to serious Covid. It\\u2019s not clear.\", \"One worrisome postscript is that even seemingly mild Covid infections can prove deadly for vulnerable people, like the elderly. The flu kills large numbers of elderly people for the same reason.\", \"A second problem is that immunity among the vaccinated and previously infected really does seem to be waning over time. \\u201cOur effective vaccination rate is dropping\\u201d because of waning immunity, Topol noted.\", \"All of this argues for getting vaccinated, even if you have been infected, and getting boosted, if you\\u2019re eligible. \\u201cPeople need to be told to get boosted now and not wait the three to four months for a specific Omicron vaccine,\\u201d Wachter said.\", \"Do Covid tests \\u2014 including both PCR tests and rapid at-home tests \\u2014 still work? Yes, based on the signs so far.\", \"Assuming that remains true, it will be very helpful. \\u201cOmicron\\u2019s spread will put a much greater premium on rapid testing, as will the new oral drugs,\\u201d Wachter said.\", \"The early signs may prove misleading, and we will know more within a few weeks.\", \"For now, vaccinated people can reasonably continue to behave as they were \\u2014 but many should feel urgency about getting booster shots. Older people and others who are vulnerable, like people receiving cancer treatment, should continue to be careful and ask people around them to test frequently.\", \"Unvaccinated people remain at substantial risk of serious illness. About 1,000 Americans have been dying each day of Covid in recent weeks, the vast majority of them unvaccinated.\", \"Look up case and deaths counts for your county here.\", \"More virus news:\", \"Erika Bachiochi didn\\u2019t vote for Trump. But with the Supreme Court poised to overturn Roe v. Wade, she\\u2019s grateful to those who did.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t turn into aliens.\\u201d Five teen girls talk about the trials of growing up, including period pains and catcalling.\", \"Stars: Meet NASA\\u2019s next astronauts.\", \"Sticker shock: Chanel, TikTok and the $825 Advent calendar.\", \"Inside Tesla: How Elon Musk pushed an unflinching vision for self-driving cars.\", \"Health: After prostate cancer treatment, gay and bisexual men need a different kind of support.\", \"Advice from Wirecutter: Winter picks for running gear, warm bedding and snow blowers.\", \"Lives Lived: Fred Hiatt, the longtime leader of The Washington Post\\u2019s opinion section, used his position to support justice and human rights.
