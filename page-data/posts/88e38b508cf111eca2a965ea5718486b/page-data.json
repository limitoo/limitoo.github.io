A phalanx of police officers warned the protesters they would be charged with criminal mischief, before closing in the small crowd and making arrests. A tow truck was used to removed a pair of parked pickup trucks blocking the approach to the bridge.\", \"\\u201cThere will be zero tolerance for illegal activity,\\u201d the Windsor Police warned in a statement.\", \"The authorities also urged members of the public to avoid the area \\u2014 but at least some appeared to have other ideas. On Sunday, a Facebook group supporting the protesters issued \\u201curgent announcements\\u201d calling on people to make their way to the bridge.\", \"In ordinary times, the bridge, which spans the Detroit River, is a main avenue of international commerce, with goods moving steadily between the United States and Canada. The nearly weeklong blockade has cost American automakers, in particular, millions of dollars.\", \"In a meeting with senior officials on Saturday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \\u201cstressed that border crossings cannot, and will not, remain closed, and that all options remain on the table,\\u201d according to a government statement.\", \"Mayor Dilkens, too, said Sunday that some lines could not be crossed.\", \"\\u201cCanada is nation that believes in the right to freedom of speech and expression,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut we are also bound by the rule of law.\\u201d\", \"On Sunday, the police defended their patient approach.\", \"\\u201cPolice used discretion during the course of the demonstration to avoid creating an unstable situation and potentially putting the public at risk,\\u201d they said. \\u201cThis exercising of police discretion should not be confused with lack of enforcement.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"88e38b508cf111eca2a965ea5718486b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"88e38b508cf111eca2a965ea5718486b"}},
