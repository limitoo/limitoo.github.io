According to local media, the dessert was added to their restaurant's menu in the 1970s.\", \"According to the BBC, Alba Campeol and chef Roberto Linguanotto\\u00a0came up with the idea\\u00a0for the dessert after Linguanotto accidentally dropped some mascarpone cheese into a bowl of eggs and sugar.
