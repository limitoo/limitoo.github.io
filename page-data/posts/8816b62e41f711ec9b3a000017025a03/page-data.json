I once worked a kitchen station next to a wry Boston teenager who couldn\\u2019t believe his good fortune, to work where we did and not where he used to. \\u201cBeats stuffing mushroom caps at a sports bar in Allston,\\u201d he\\u2019d say about three times a day. It put me off mushroom caps for years.\", \"Kay Chun\\u2019s bringing me back to them, though, with her awesome new recipe for stuffed mushrooms (above) with an escargot-flavored filling \\u2014 shallots, parsley and lots of garlic with buttery crumbs \\u2014 that really evokes the classic French dish, though with no snails. (\\u201cEscar-no,\\u201d said my colleague Tejal Rao, when we first heard about it.) I could see serving them as a Thanksgiving appetizer if I served Thanksgiving appetizers (I don\\u2019t) or as part of a game-day spread in front of the television, in advance of some bespoke chicken wings and the Steelers game.\", \"I like Hetty McKinnon\\u2019s new recipe as well, for stir-fried peanut rice cakes with hoisin, inspired by the Cantonese dim sum dish cheong fun, steamed noodle rolls, with hoisin and sesame sauces. Hetty\\u2019s dish puts those flavors onto chewy rice cakes, which is reason No. 273 to rely on rice cakes as a freezer staple when you want a quick stir-fry. (More Hetty, more mushrooms: this terrific mushroom Stroganoff!)\", \"And I absolutely want to give Vallery Lomas\\u2019s new one-bowl cranberry cornbread a try \\u2014 the fresh cranberries scattered across the top sink into the batter and add tangy pops to each bite. It\\u2019d be a nice Thanksgiving breakfast or snack, perhaps even a Thanksgiving side dish.\", \"Speaking of the holiday, my mailbox is starting to fill with requests for turkey inspiration, menu planning tips and vegan and vegetarian Thanksgiving options. They are legion! You might try on this vegetarian mushroom Wellington for size; you should absolutely consider a meal that includes vegan stuffing and vegan mashed potatoes with vegan mushroom make-ahead gravy and some vegan quick biscuits to mop it up. And here\\u2019s a vegan pumpkin cheesecake for dessert.\", \"There are thousands more recipes for right now and for Thanksgiving waiting for you on New York Times Cooking, at least once you\\u2019ve gotten yourself a subscription that allows you to access them all.

I read every letter sent.)\", \"Now, it\\u2019s nothing to do with nutritional yeast or the excellence of tempeh, but you\\u2019ve got to read Rembert Browne on H. Rap Brown, in Time.\", \"Also, here\\u2019s Dorie Greenspan in The New York Times Magazine with a fantastic recipe for a savory sweet potato galette with apples, cream cheese and a chile powder kick. Yes, please.\", \"For Hakai, Larry Pynn wrote about the necropsy of a humpback whale that washed up on the beach on an island in British Columbia. It\\u2019s a fascinating tale.\", \"Finally, a love letter to New York City. Here\\u2019s Bill Callahan and Bonnie \\u201cPrince\\u201d Billy covering John Prine\\u2019s \\u201cShe Is My Everything\\u201d with Sir Richard Bishop.
