Gov. Mike DeWine signed the legislation Monday, a move likely applauded by the fireworks industry and condemned by child safety advocates and health care groups that were long opposed to the measure.\", \"Under the new law, people in the state can set off fireworks on select holidays such as New Year's Eve, New Year's Day, the Chinese New Year, Cinco de Mayo, Labor Day, Diwali and days on and around July 4. More than 20 days total are included in the legislation.\", \"The previous law permitted residents to purchase consumer-grade fireworks, like Roman candles and firecrackers, within state borders, but they were required to move them out of Ohio within 48 hours. That rule was widely ignored by Ohioans, and the ignition of fireworks was often heard in state neighborhoods on holidays despite the law, the AP reported.\", \"The former law only permitted state residents to use sparklers and other types of pyrotechnics on private property. The state fire marshal will be charged with making rules for consumer use, while local communities can opt out or add restrictions in the dates or times fireworks can be ignited, The Cincinnati Enquirer reported.\", \"Ohio was among the handful of states with the most restrictive fireworks laws in the country before DeWine signed the legislation. Fireworks are fully banned in Massachusetts, and anyone who breaks the law could be subject to fines and confiscation.\", \"Illinois' Pyrotechnic Use Act bans the sale, use and possession of any consumer fireworks like bottle rockets and Roman candles. Only smaller novelty devices are permitted, such as sparklers, snakes or glow pellets, smoke devices and party poppers, according to Illinois Legal Aid.\", \"Vermont is similarly restrictive, barring any sale, use or possession of consumer-level firework products without a permit. The state also does permit certain smaller novelty devices, like sparklers, snakes, party poppers, smoke devices, string poppers and snappers, according to Vermont's government website.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928471/ohio-permits-fireworks-holidays.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A new Ohio law will permit residents of the state to set off fireworks on certain holidays, effectively ending an era of illegality that was long-ignored by Ohioans.

Since, lawmakers moved the date for first use to July 1, 2022, set the maximum size of fireworks showrooms at 7,500 square feet, and required showrooms expanded to that size to employ sprinkler systems meeting specific state standards.\", \"The new law also prohibits setting off fireworks while under the influence or on someone else's property without permission. In addition, the law allows local communities to restrict or ban the use of fireworks.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928496/man-purchases-fireworks.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Ohio's former fireworks law only permitted state residents to use sparklers and other minor types of pyrotechnics.
