High uptake of the booster dose was likely to mitigate the impact of the Omicron wave, the researchers said.\", \"\\\"This latest data from the UK show that cases of Omicron there are doubling every two to three days at the moment which is incredibly fast.\", \"\\\"If it spreads that quickly you get such a large number of cases that even if the majority of those cases are relatively mild it could still put significant numbers of people in hospital.\\\"\", \"Early real-world studies by the UK Health Security Agency estimated two doses of a vaccine gave limited protection against developing Omicron symptoms, but a booster dose raised it up to 75 percent, the BBC reported.\", \"Plank said there would likely be a case for New Zealand to delay international border reopening, though there was no need to make a decision for a few weeks.\", \"\\\"If we can keep it out for just a couple of months longer that will enable us to get those booster doses out to people and that will give us a much better level of protection,\\\" Plank said.\", \"\\\"The data from the UK is showing there's a significant drop in the vaccine effectiveness if you've had two doses but you have a much better level of protection after that booster dose.\", \"\\\"If we've only got half of our adult population with boosters that will still leave us quite vulnerable, Plank said.\", \"\\\"If we're trying to keep this Omicron variant out until we've got more people boosted, even one case would likely be the end of that.\\\"\", \"Under current plans, MIQ stays will no longer be required for fully vaccinated Kiwis and other eligible travellers from Australia from mid-January, then a month later for those groups arriving other countries. From 30 April it would begin to apply to all travellers, phased over time.
