When Amanda Gorman took the stage on Jan. 20, there was a collective swiveling of heads: Who\\u2019s that? The inaugural poet was 22 years old and recited a work of about 700 words. The register of the poem was optimism, the language was direct and the imagery simple: light, dawn, shade, sea. The poem\\u2019s prescription to \\u201clet us leave behind a country better than the one we were left\\u201d plowed deliberately into clich\\u00e9, but Gorman stuck the landing \\u2014 partly because of the context and mostly because of her delivery. It was exactly the right text for the occasion.\", \"That poem, \\u201cThe Hill We Climb,\\u201d drew on Gorman\\u2019s strengths: the rhythm of her syllables, the vigor of her performance, and her gift for concealing razor blades in lines of pillowy hope. Take the following stanza:\", \"The blade, if you overlooked it, is \\u201cOnly to find herself reciting for one,\\u201d which can be read in at least two ways. Maybe it\\u2019s a plain acknowledgment of Gorman\\u2019s triumph; she was one of just six poets to read at an American inauguration, and by far the youngest. Maybe it\\u2019s a tart observation about performing a service (an honorable and prestigious service, but a service) for a politician with a troubled record on, among other things, race \\u2014 something that Gorman, who is keenly interested in American history, would not have missed. That \\u201conly\\u201d is either an expression of wonderment or, read in the sense of \\u201cmerely,\\u201d a skeptically raised eyebrow. Nested inside the line\\u2019s ambiguity is yet another one, embedded within the phrase \\u201cto find herself.\\u201d To find oneself is an act of self-invention; to find oneself doing something suggests the passive and aimless opposite of self-invention.\", \"All of which is to say: If Gorman\\u2019s performance was widely perceived as existing in one mode \\u2014 an exuberant call to action and, per the assignment, a meditation on unity \\u2014 its effect on the page is more subtle, and strewn throughout with subversive detonations. \\u201cThe Hill We Climb\\u201d is the final poem in \\u201cCall Us What We Carry,\\u201d a sprawling collection with references ranging from \\u201cGhostbusters\\u201d to Shakespeare to Carly Simon to Plato and influences that include Anne Carson, Lucille Clifton, Abraham Lincoln and Homer.\", \"It is not Gorman\\u2019s first book but it functions like a debut, coming in the wake of her instant elevation to the rare status of \\u201ccelebrity poet.\\u201d (In case there\\u2019s any confusion, that\\u2019s not a dig. The more celebrity poets, the better.)\", \"The poet and professor Stephanie Burt has written that \\u201cthere is no one purpose to all poetry; there are only poems, lots of them, memorable and ridiculous and calm and volatile and heartbreaking and fascinating poems.\\u201d Gorman packs all of the above into one volume. There are focused and pithy poems. There are poems arranged in playfully heretical formats: a \\u201cRoses are red, violets are blue\\u201d poem, a poem in the shape of a face mask, a poem in the form of a text exchange. There is reverence and effervescence; gravity and impishness, strong poems and weak poems.\", \"The weak poems suffer from a reliance on dusty imagery. (\\u201cSome griefs, like rivers, are uncross / able. They are not to be waded across / but walked beside.\\u201d) The strong poems are those in which Gorman unsheathes her blade, calling the crescent moon \\u201cnight\\u2019s lucent lesion\\u201d or offering a phrase that would seem to uplift \\u2014 \\u201cThe earth is a magic act; / Each second something beautiful\\u201d \\u2014 only to pierce the balloon after a line break:\", \"An idiosyncrasy of the book is Gorman\\u2019s fondness for didactic digressions. One poem contains a note on Spanish verb conjugation, another features an explanation of stereotypic behavior in captive animals, a third includes a pocket history of the 1918 influenza pandemic. When these work, it feels as though Gorman is picking shiny apples of knowledge and presenting the best specimens in a basket for the reader\\u2019s enjoyment. When they don\\u2019t work \\u2014 one poem contains a footnote directing readers to a David Brooks article from The Atlantic about collapsing levels of social trust \\u2014 they feel like excruciating intrusions.\", \"I could imagine a world in which \\u201cCall Us What We Carry\\u201d were split into two or three separate books, each more narrowly adhering to one of Gorman\\u2019s many modes. Maybe those books would have been easier to digest. But I don\\u2019t get the sense that \\u201cdigestibility\\u201d is high on the poet\\u2019s list of writerly priorities, and I found the variation in \\u201cCall Us What We Carry\\u201d to be mostly stimulating rather than discombobulating \\u2014 an act of both courage and mischief. Why not experiment, mess around a little, throw your voice, ventriloquize, pick up one form and put it down and move on to another?\", \"One of Gorman\\u2019s themes is that the body is a work in progress: the body politic as much as our fleshy forms. Given that conviction, it follows that she\\u2019d configure her body of work along similarly volatile lines.\", \"Yeats said we produce rhetoric out of the quarrel with others and poetry out of the quarrel with ourselves. Gorman makes the case \\u2014 often convincingly \\u2014 that poetry may come from both.\"]","href_hash":"c00cb234578411ec8b3bd348637dd702"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c00cb234578411ec8b3bd348637dd702"}},
