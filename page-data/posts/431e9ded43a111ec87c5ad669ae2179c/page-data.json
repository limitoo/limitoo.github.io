To be its dwindling self, the G.O.P. has to also be at war with the press, unless of course the press folds under pressure.\\u201d\", \"[You can listen to this episode of \\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\\u201d on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]\", \"Rosen is a professor of journalism at N.Y.U., author of the blog \\u201cPressThink,\\u201d and one of America\\u2019s sharpest contemporary media critics. And his argument is a simple one: The media\\u2019s implicit model of American politics \\u2014 of two coequal parties with competing governing philosophies \\u2014 is fundamentally broken. Today, the most important axis of political conflict is not between left and right, but between pro- and anti-democracy forces.\", \"The way Rosen sees it, the American mainstream press must make a choice: Will it double down on its commitment to detached, nonpartisan neutrality? Or will it choose instead to boldly and aggressively defend truth and democracy?\", \"These days, Rosen\\u2019s view seems almost common-sensical. But he\\u2019s been critiquing \\u201cboth sides\\u201d journalism \\u2014 and the model of politics underlying it \\u2014 for years now, long before such arguments came into vogue. As a result, he\\u2019s done some of the most original thinking about what an alternative model of journalism would look like, and wrestled with the inevitable political, social and economic tensions that come with it.\", \"So this conversation is about what pro-democracy journalism could look like in practice and the thorny questions that this approach to coverage raises. But it also touches on the drawbacks of the press\\u2019s focus on Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema; how journalists should cover Donald Trump and Tucker Carlson; why Rosen believes \\u201cmoderate\\u201d and \\u201ccentrist\\u201d are \\u201ctwo of the most ideology-soaked terms\\u201d in political journalism; the consequences of an economy where political news has to compete for attention with Netflix, Xbox and TikTok; and why Substack and podcasting may hold one of the keys to restoring trust in the media.\", \"You can listen to the whole conversation by following \\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\\u201d on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.
