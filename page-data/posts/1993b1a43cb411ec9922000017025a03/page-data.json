Holder. It also seeks to bolster safeguards against discriminatory election practices that were limited this year by the court\\u2019s ruling in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee.\", \"\\u201cWe wouldn\\u2019t be dealing with some of these terrible, draconian measures in Georgia right now if preclearance were on the books,\\u201d said Senator Raphael Warnock, a Democrat, whose home state has seen new voting restrictions imposed by Republicans after his victory in Georgia in January and President Biden\\u2019s win in November. \\u201cAnd so, let\\u2019s get this done.\\u201d\", \"Considered the crown jewel of civil rights legislation, the Voting Rights Act traditionally enjoyed broad bipartisan support after its enactment in 1965 and was renewed under a succession of Republican presidents. But just one Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, has announced that she will join all 50 Democrats in voting to open debate on a compromise measure that also has the support of Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, who helped negotiate the new version.\", \"It would take 60 votes \\u2014 a minimum of 10 Republican votes \\u2014 to overcome the filibuster and take up the bill.\", \"\\u201cVoting rights are fundamental to our democracy and how we protect them defines us as a nation,\\u201d Ms. Murkowski said in a statement. \\u201cI have supported this particular legislation in previous Congresses and continued to work with my colleagues on it because it provides a framework through which legitimate voting rights issues can be tackled.\\u201d\", \"The measure incorporates provisions intended to improve ballot access for Native Americans, an important constituency of Ms. Murkowski\\u2019s.\", \"The John Lewis measure is distinct from an earlier voting rights measure, the Freedom to Vote Act, which Republicans have thrice thwarted through filibusters, most recently in October. That measure sets new voting standards meant to counter Republican-led efforts around the country to impose voting restrictions that Democrats regard as efforts to limit voting in minority communities. No Republican supported bringing that measure to the floor.\", \"\\u201cThe Freedom to Vote Act puts the fire out in this 911 state of emergency in our democracy,\\u201d Mr. Warnock said. \\u201cThe John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act is about building a fire station for future fires.\\u201d\", \"Top Republicans, though, portray both measures as unnecessary and say they represent an effort by Democrats in Washington to set election parameters to their advantage. They argue that the Supreme Court eliminated only parts of the Voting Rights Act that it considered outdated, and note that governments that discriminate can still be pursued by the Justice Department.\", \"\\u201cLook, the voting rights law is intact,\\u201d Senator Mitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and minority leader, told reporters last month. \\u201cThe Supreme Court did not strike down the Voting Rights Act. It is against the law to discriminate against Americans on the basis of race. It has been since the Voting Rights Act in 1965.\\u201d\", \"Democrats were well aware that they were likely to again hit a Republican wall when it comes to voting rights. But part of their calculation has been to demonstrate to Mr. Manchin, who has been deeply involved in crafting both measures, that Republicans are determined to obstruct the bills, making a change in filibuster rules the only route to enacting the measures he helped author. Mr. Manchin has expressed deep reservations about tinkering with the filibuster, which he says fosters bipartisanship.\", \"Top Democrats say they cannot stand by and let minority Republicans shelve measures that Democrats see as fundamental to protecting the right to vote.\", \"\\u201cAt some point, our democracy has to move along,\\u201d said Senator Amy Klobuchar, Democrat of Minnesota and chairman of the Rules Committee. \\u201cAnd that\\u2019s the discussion we\\u2019ll be having.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"1993b1a43cb411ec9922000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1993b1a43cb411ec9922000017025a03"}},
