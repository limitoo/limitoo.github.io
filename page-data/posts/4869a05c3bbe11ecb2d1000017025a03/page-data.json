In particular, \\u201cOur search was in elevator buildings only,\\u201d said Ms. Burns, 34, a daughter of the filmmaker Ken Burns, who, along with Mr. Hernandez, 46, is a partner in Jax Media, a television and film production company that has worked on shows like \\u201cRussian Doll,\\u201d \\u201cEmily in Paris\\u201d and \\u201cSearch Party.\\u201d\", \"What the couple didn\\u2019t anticipate was that their search would also turn up single-family homes with elevators.\", \"\\u201cWe were not thinking we wanted to live in a townhouse,\\u201d Ms. Burns said. But when they discovered a listing for a newly constructed house in Boerum Hill \\u2014 with 5,000 square feet, four stories and its own elevator \\u2014 they began to entertain the option.\", \"\\u201cIt was truly an accident of the search settings,\\u201d she said.\", \"After seeing the home in person, there was no turning back. \\u201cWe came and looked at it, and it was just a little bit undeniable in terms of lifestyle,\\u201d she said, particularly as she and Mr. Hernandez had plans to expand their family. (They now have two children \\u2014 Jax, 12, and Lou, 2 \\u2014 and Ms. Burns is expecting again.) \\u201cAs someone who has lived in the city for a really long time, it had these kind of inconceivable elements, like a parking space, a backyard, all these windows, this huge space and this giant basement.\\u201d\", \"The couple bought it that March for about $5.9 million. While they loved the architecture of the space, which includes a dining room with a section of glass flooring that allows sunlight from skylights to flood the basement media room, they wanted to make sure the interiors had personality. So before moving in, they brought in Denise Davies, of D2 Interieurs, a design firm based in Weston, Conn.\", \"Ms. Burns and Mr. Hernandez had met Ms. Davies a couple of years earlier, when they commissioned D2 to design their country house in Redding, Conn. During that project, they were impressed with Ms. Davies\\u2019s ability to divine their sense of style with little guidance, delivering a turnkey home with every last throw pillow in place.\", \"\\u201cWith the Connecticut project, we were so busy with work that we just made all decisions over email,\\u201d Ms. Burns said. \\u201cShe is amazing at managing, sending options, overseeing it all, making all the right decisions and serving as a proxy.\\u201d\", \"For the couple\\u2019s Brooklyn home, Ms. Burns told Ms. Davies that they were hoping for a slightly Parisian vibe, with modern furnishings set off by classic architectural details. And they wanted every room to feel extremely comfortable.\", \"As Ms. Davies said, \\u201cWe really wanted it to look like everything had been there for a while, not like a brand-spanking-new townhouse that just went up.\\u201d\", \"For character, Ms. Davies added touches like trompe l\\u2019oeil wallpaper resembling three-dimensional wood to the ceiling of the entrance hall, and a slate backsplash along with open wood shelves to the kitchen. She also lined the walls of the elevator with colorful geometric Kravet wallpaper for a blast of pattern.\", \"For comfort, and to encourage casual family hangouts, she designed a deep built-in sofa for one side of the kitchen. In the media room, she installed an enormous custom sectional similar to the one she put in the couple\\u2019s Connecticut house, because she already knew they loved it.\", \"Then she added many pieces from local designers and manufacturers, including Well pendants by Allied Maker above the kitchen island, and Circuit sconces from Apparatus and a Modo chandelier from Roll & Hill in the living room.\", \"Ms. Burns and Mr. Hernandez brought their own eclectic art collection to the mix, which includes pieces by Henri Matisse and a work by Alia Shawkat, the star of \\u201cSearch Party.\\u201d\", \"Compared with the colorful, high-energy vibe of the other rooms, the couple\\u2019s bedroom feels calm, with a palette of off-whites and pink-y taupe. \\u201cWe were hoping to create a master that felt like a hotel room,\\u201d Ms. Burns said. \\u201cMy husband and I both love to stay in hotels, and whenever we travel for work that\\u2019s a real plus of the experience.\\u201d\", \"Most of the work was completed in a few months, before the family moved in during the summer of 2018, although Ms. Davies continued to fine-tune and add finishing touches until the end of that year. In total, Ms. Burns and Mr. Hernandez spent about $500,000 on the interior design.\", \"Now they are thrilled with the townhouse they didn\\u2019t know they wanted \\u2014 as well as the elevator that helped them find it.\", \"\\u201cThis crazy elevator is something we wouldn\\u2019t have ever thought we would want or need, but somehow use all the time,\\u201d Ms. Burns said, especially for schlepping laundry and luggage. \\u201cNever underestimate your laziness.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4869a05c3bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4869a05c3bbe11ecb2d1000017025a03"}},
