It's a very different situation and things could go crazy quickly.\\\"\", \"Asked whether there was a scenario that could prompt him to send troops to rescue fleeing Americans, Biden replied: \\\"There's not. That's a world war when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another. We're in a very different world than we've ever been.\\\"\", \"World leaders, meanwhile, continued their frenzied diplomacy to defuse the current crisis over Ukraine.\", \"Russia and Ukraine announced late on Thursday that they had failed to reach any breakthrough in a day of talks with French and German officials aimed at ending the separatist conflict in eastern Ukraine.\", \"The current tensions come eight years after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula. Since then, Ukraine's military has been locked in a war with Russian-backed rebels in eastern areas near Russia's borders.\", \"Earlier, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped \\\"strong deterrence\\\" and \\\"patient diplomacy\\\" could find a way through the crisis but the stakes were \\\"very high\\\".\", \"In a joint news conference in Brussels with Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, Johnson said he did not believe Russia had yet taken a decision on whether to invade Ukraine but the UK's intelligence \\\"remains grim\\\".\", \"Asked whether the UK would consider going further in its support for Ukraine, including military support for an insurgency if Russia invades, Johnson said he would \\\"consider what more we can conceivably offer\\\".\", \"\\\"It's possible, I don't want to rule this out, but at the moment we think the package is the right one,\\\" he said.\", \"Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said during a frosty news conference with his British counterpart Liz Truss that the talks had been \\\"disappointing\\\".\", \"He said relations between the UK and Russia \\\"leave much to be desired\\\" and are at the \\\"lowest point over the past few years\\\".\", \"Truss accused Russia of \\\"Cold War rhetoric\\\".\", \"UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace will meet his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu in Moscow on Friday.\", \"Before the trip, Wallace confirmed that the UK was providing more defensive equipment - including body armour, helmets and combat boots - to the Ukrainian government. He also said it was important to show that Nato countries \\\"won't let threats push us around\\\".\", \"Meanwhile, Ukraine accused Russia of blocking its access to the sea as Russia prepares for naval exercises.\", \"Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said the Sea of Azov was completely blocked and the Black Sea almost fully cut off by Russian forces.\", \"Russia's naval exercises will take place next week in the two seas to the south of Ukraine, the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov.
