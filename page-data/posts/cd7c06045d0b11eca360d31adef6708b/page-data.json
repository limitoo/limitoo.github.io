That was eight years ago. Since then, Dani Garcia, his restaurant in Marbella, Spain, picked up a third Michelin star (it\\u2019s now closed), and the chef formed his own company, Grupo Dani Garcia. Now, he has returned to New York and is on the marquee of Casa Dani in the Manhattan West complex, west of the Moynihan Train Hall. \\u201cWhat I\\u2019m doing at Casa Dani is not fine dining,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI want to showcase the culture of Spain, making it easy, fresh and fun, more like home cooking.\\u201d He said a great deal had changed since he was first in New York, especially the increasing availability of ingredients. His thinking has also changed, he said. \\u201cTwenty-five years of fine dining, which is more conceptual and less from the heart, is enough,\\u201d he said. What hasn\\u2019t changed is having Alberto Carballo, the chef de cuisine, at his side. A soaring 180-seat dining room, a sea of beige designed by David Rockwell, sits on a level below the bar and open kitchen. There are tapas; fried items like cod fritters; bigger portions (raciones), many with seafood; and rice and noodle specialties. There are also a few main dishes, including daurade and hanger steak, and even larger-format platters for the table like whole Spanish turbot. A section on the menu is devoted to fresh tuna prepared several ways, which Mr. Garcia considers to be representative of the soul of Spanish cooking. Near the entrance to Mr. Garcia\\u2019s restaurant, which he runs with Sam Nazarian, is his Pollo Verde, a casual spot in the Citizens NY food hall at the complex.\", \"What was the sleek, art-filled Brasserie 8\\u00bd, serving French fare, in the slope-sided Solow Building on West 57th Street is now an Italian restaurant with this new name. Considering the Fellini film \\u201c8\\u00bd,\\u201d the name may have been more fitting for an Italian restaurant anyway. It also has a new team led by August Ceradini, a hospitality veteran, and a new chef, John Villa, formerly at the TAO Group and Merchants Hospitality. Among the starters are crudo, with local fish selected by the chef Dave Pasternack. There are also assorted pastas, and Italian-American favorites like baked clams oreganata, penne alla vodka, chicken Parm, Caesar salad and zabaglione. Some chicken, steak and fish dishes round out the menu. A swooping staircase leads to the spacious, 250-seat dining room and bar. (Opens Wednesday) \", \"Greg Baxtrom, the chef and an owner of Olmsted and Maison Yaki, is adding this bakery and cafe to his lineup on Vanderbilt Avenue in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn. He has teamed up with Alex Grunert, a native of Vienna, who worked at Bouley and Blue Hill at Stone Barns, to produce treats like Christmas stollen, doughnuts, Sacher torte, cookies, baguettes and loaves of bread seasoned with sauerkraut or caraway. The place, named for Mr. Grunert\\u2019s mother, Evelyn Grunert, also serves soups, sandwiches and coffee, as well as a small array of grocery items like sauces and preserves. (Wednesday)\", \"Sungchul Shim, the chef and owner of Kochi in Hell\\u2019s Kitchen, has added this restaurant nearby. At this new restaurant, the spotlight is on Korean hand rolls.

Dessert involves a Korean Choco Pie with chocolate sponge cake, black sesame marshmallow and strawberry jam. An open kitchen bordered by a 20-seat counter and a small dining room define the space. \", \"Serena Bass and Susannah Koteen, who own Lido and Bixi in Harlem, have added this casual restaurant featuring bright sports club colors to their growing presence. Ms. Bass\\u2019s food looks across the pond with sausage rolls, pub-style grilled cheese sandwiches with traditional mango chutney, pasta and cauliflower gratin, and fish and chips. Coming soon are desserts like Eton mess, trifle and sticky toffee pudding. \", \"This seasonally decorated open-air pop-up in the Seaport District, from the esteemed Greenwich Village bar Dante, has several elements. An aperitivo bar specializes in spritzes. The Dante Bar mixes negronis, as well as hot and cold cocktails and eventually will have food like pasta. A food truck serves flatbreads with toppings, and another food truck has affogatos. (Wednesday through March 2022) \", \"Endless Hospitality, the company that owned Wild Son, the previous tenant in this space, has turned it into a restaurant that looks to Mexico. The executive chef, Luigi Petrocelli, and his second in command, Ricardo Arias, apply French techniques to dishes like beef tartare with salsa macha, charred prawns with poblano aioli, mussels escabeche with saffron, and braised lamb neck with masa crepes. \", \"This corner of France, with an emphasis on Alsace, has moved half a block uptown, into the former Writing Room space that also once housed Elaine\\u2019s. The original Caf\\u00e9 d\\u2019Alsace location is being demolished for a high-rise. The d\\u00e9cor has been updated but the chef and partner, Philippe Roussel, is the same, as is his menu.

It\\u2019s compact but has a coffee window to the street. \", \"This company, known for its dosas, got its start in the Hamptons and opened a cafe in 1997. Now after 24 years in Amagansett Square, it has moved to East Hampton, the result of a rent hike. It also had cafes in SoHo and on the Upper West Side, all closed now. (Friday)\", \"A seasonal magnet on the highway leading to Montauk for decades, it has opened a year-round branch in a former diner some 20 miles to the west, in Southampton.

He will spend time in Chicago, especially around the opening but will not be moving there. He remains committed to running the kitchen at Le Coucou, where he said he has \\u201ca tremendous crew,\\u201d as well as his Paris restaurants. \", \"Mr. Watanabe, a drinks expert who started his career in Tokyo and became head bartender, then manager of Angel\\u2019s Share in the East Village, is now the consultant creating cocktails at Em Vietnamese Bistro in Dumbo, which just received its liquor license. \", \"The inspectors for this guide have added four restaurants this year.
