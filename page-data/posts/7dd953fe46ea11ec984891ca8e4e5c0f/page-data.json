She can engage the personal and the political; she can coo a romantic ballad or spearhead a hard-rock attack. Her voice can tease, bite, whisper, croon, rasp or rise to a banshee wail. It can, and does, go straight to the heart.\", \"In Latin America, Laferte, 38, has built a career that began with pop cover songs in 2003, moved into hard rock and has since spanned rockabilly, salsa, bolero, ranchera and psychedelia, just for starters. She often performs wearing vintage-style formal dresses with a flower in her hair, while her bare shoulders show off her tattoos.\", \"\\u201cEvery person is a universe,\\u201d Laferte said on a video call, speaking through a translator. \\u201cI love to do these different voices because it represents all of my personalities: when I\\u2019m fragile, when I\\u2019m stronger, when I\\u2019m fun, when I\\u2019m upset. And that is what I want to do. That is what art is. I want to transmit all of these feelings and have people feel as much as I do. And I want them to get goose bumps when they hear my songs.\\u201d\", \"Laferte \\u2014 her full name is Norma Monserrat Laferte Bustamente \\u2014 was productive through the pandemic. This year, she has released two very different albums, and she is now touring North America. On Thursday, she will perform at the Latin Grammy Awards, where she is nominated in four categories, including song of the year and best singer-songwriter album.\", \"She recorded \\u201cSeis\\u201d (\\u201cSix\\u201d) in 2020 as the quarantine was beginning in Mexico. Released in April, the album delves into vintage Mexican regional styles \\u2014 norte\\u00f1o, banda, mariachi \\u2014 backed largely with acoustic instruments. And on Oct. 29 Laferte released the very distinct \\u201c1940 Carmen,\\u201d named after the Airbnb in Los Angeles where she recorded it. The new album embraces Southern California folk-pop and includes her first songs in English.\", \"Metallica invited Laferte to contribute to \\u201cThe Metallica Blacklist,\\u201d a benefit album with remakes of the metal band\\u2019s songs on the 30th anniversary of \\u201cMetallica,\\u201d widely known as the Black Album. Her Spanish-language version of \\u201cNothing Else Matters\\u201d \\u2014 the first song she learned on the guitar she got when she was 9 years old \\u2014 turns it into an Andean-flavored waltz with traditional Chilean instruments.\", \"In 2020 Laferte, who has lived in Mexico for more than a decade, had moved to the rural town of Tepoztl\\u00e1n, where one of Mexico\\u2019s most cherished ranchera singers, Chavela Vargas, spent her last years. A documentary about Vargas seized Laferte\\u2019s imagination, and during quarantine, she set up a studio at her house, later adding orchestral and brass-band arrangements via remote sessions. The guitarist Sebasti\\u00e1n Aracena, who is in Laferte\\u2019s touring band, co-produced \\u201cSeis\\u201d and also played on \\u201c1940 Carmen,\\u201d which Laferte produced herself.\", \"\\u201cWith \\u2018Seis,\\u2019 it was March and April of last year,\\u201d Aracena said via video call. \\u201cWe didn\\u2019t know what was going to happen. There was no vaccine, no nothing. Mon told me, \\u2018Can you come to the house for a week and maybe just hang out and see what we can do?\\u2019 And I stayed for four months. It was all very natural. It\\u2019s so easy because she knows what she wants.\\u201d\", \"On \\u201cSeis,\\u201d Laferte harks back to the volatile drama of Vargas\\u2019s performances for songs of her own about women\\u2019s power, desire, pain and perseverance, both in relationships and in larger struggles. \\u201cSe Va la Vida\\u201d (\\u201cLife Goes Away\\u201d) is about women prisoners in Chile, and in \\u201cLa Democracia\\u201d (\\u201cDemocracy\\u201d), Laferte growls, \\u201cWhere did it go? Somebody stole it.\\u201d\", \"Aracena said, \\u201cHer social awareness makes her special. She\\u2019s very smart in terms of looking at society and understanding the sociocultural emotion, and her lyrics can really teach you to feel the people\\u2019s emotion.\\u201d\", \"Laferte has long been outspoken. At the Latin Grammys in 2019, where she won best alternative album for her 2018 release \\u201cNorma\\u201d \\u2014 a tour-de-force album that riffled through diverse Latin idioms but was recorded live in the studio in a single day \\u2014 Laferte protested human-rights violations in Chile by baring her chest on the red carpet to reveal the written words, \\u201cIn Chile, they torture, rape and kill.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSeis\\u201d includes \\u201cLa Mujer\\u201d (\\u201cThe Woman\\u201d), a duet with the Mexican pop star Gloria Trevi, which is nominated for a Latin Grammy as best pop song. Laferte wrote and performed it years ago, when she was going through \\u201ca very depressive stage of my life,\\u201d she said. But she eventually decided that its clinging, despondent lyrics were \\u201ctoxic.\\u201d Her rewritten version with Trevi spurns the \\u201csad coward\\u201d who had tried to control her; it\\u2019s about \\u201cending a relationship and about survival instinct,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt was a healing process. It made it a better song.\\u201d\", \"The songs on \\u201c1940 Carmen,\\u201d reflect a different, more relaxed environment. Much of the music invokes sunny Southern California folk-pop and the guitar reverb of 1950s R&B. In \\u201cPlacer Hollywood\\u201d (\\u201cHollywood Pleasure\\u201d), a trilingual song that opens the album, Laferte blithely stretches the word \\u201cyou\\u201d into a 38-note melisma; on tour, she has been playfully testing whether audiences can sing along. The album\\u2019s first single, \\u201cAlgo Es Mejor\\u201d (\\u201cSomething Is Better\\u201d), radiates optimism, while \\u201cNi\\u00f1a\\u201d (\\u201cGirl\\u201d) is a fond lullaby that promises an unborn child \\u201cI have waited for you so long/And I will take care of you.\\u201d (After years of trying, she got pregnant, with a child due in March.) But other songs on the album exorcise deep trauma.\", \"The main reason Laferte visited Los Angeles was to get hormone therapy to become pregnant; radiation treatment for thyroid cancer in 2009 had also damaged her ovaries. But the hormone treatments brought massive mood swings. \\u201cOne day would be very happy with positive emotions, and another day would be angry and depressive,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI connected with a part of myself I didn\\u2019t know about at the time.\\u201d\", \"For Laferte, writing lyrics in English was a matter of self-protection, not crossover. On \\u201c1940 Carmen,\\u201d one of the three songs in English is \\u201cA Crying Diamond,\\u201d about a poor teenager who wants to be a singer and is sexually exploited by a 40-year-old man. \\u201cI will be your savior and I will make you a superstar,\\u201d he tells her. Years later, with her dreams gone, she keeps the secret, Laferte sings, because \\u201cNo one was going to believe a small town girl who went/Out at night with her shiny dress and broken shoes.\\u201d\", \"She had tried to write a song about it in Spanish, she said, but couldn\\u2019t. \\u201cI was going to say something that makes me vulnerable,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere were a lot of things that I wanted to say but I was ashamed to say in my own language. I feel more courageous doing it in another language. I can have a simple conversation in English, or order a coffee, but I can\\u2019t go deeper in English. So I can say a lot of things in the song, but I don\\u2019t have to feel it because it\\u2019s not in my own language.\\u201d\", \"Regardless of language, Laferte\\u2019s intensity and commitment are unmistakable. \\u201cEvery album is a life journal,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI write what I\\u2019m going through.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"7dd953fe46ea11ec984891ca8e4e5c0f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7dd953fe46ea11ec984891ca8e4e5c0f"}},
