She said Cook was angered by her request that he help her gather her belongings. She said Cook then \\\"grabbed her arm, and slung her whole body over the couch, slamming her face into the coffee table and causing her lower forehead and the bridge of her nose to bust open.\\\"\", \"The Star Tribune also reported that the lawsuit, which was filed in Dakota County District Court, includes as evidence messages sent from Cook to the woman after the fight apologizing for his actions. She said she suffered a concussion, deep cuts to her face and other bruising.\", \"In a statement sent to The Associated Press and other media outlets, Valentini said Cook had the legal right to defend himself per Minnesota's \\\"castle doctrine.\\\" He said the woman entered Cook's home with a stolen garage door opener, punched him and sprayed mace in his face without provocation. The woman also sprayed mace on two guests of Cook's, Valentini said, and forced the three of them at gunpoint to remain in his home for \\\"several hours.\\\"\", \"The injuries to the woman's face, Valentini said, occurred when Cook tried to stop his ex-girlfriend from assaulting one of his female guests. Valentini said the woman had also previously caused damage to Cook's property.\", \"Sources told CBS station WCCO-TV that attorneys for both parties could have settled the matter Tuesday afternoon, but Cook backed out, and he feels confident that their story of what unfolded will be corroborated.\", \"\\\"We are confident a full disclosure of the facts will show Mr. Cook did nothing wrong,\\\" Valentini said.\", \"The Vikings said late Tuesday they were recently notified by Valentini about the situation.\", \"\\\"Upon learning of this, we immediately notified the NFL,\\\" the team said in its statement. \\\"We are in the process of gathering more information and will withhold further comment at this time.\\\"\", \"The Vikings play at the Los Angeles Chargers this weekend. \", \"The Vikings drafted Cook in the second round in 2017. He's since developed into the focal point of their offense, totaling 5,575 yards and 38 touchdowns in 49 games.\", \"If you are in an abusive relationship and stuck at home with a dangerous partner, call 911 or The National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233.
