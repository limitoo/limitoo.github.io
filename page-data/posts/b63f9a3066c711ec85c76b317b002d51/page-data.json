The things that haunt you might be the things you need to explore. In the final episode of the final season of \\u201cInsecure,\\u201d we see this happen in the lives of the characters we have come to love.\", \"We start this episode where we left off in the last. Issa is on her way home with Nathan, after he almost fought Lawrence at Tiffany\\u2019s going away party. When he drops Issa off, he breaks up with her.\", \"\\u201cI was wrong \\u2014 this ain\\u2019t good for me,\\u201d he tells Issa, his eyes teary. \\u201cI gotta take a step back.\\u201d\", \"He chooses his sanity over the toxicity of Issa\\u2019s messiness. It\\u2019s important to note that Nathan is looking after himself: He realizes that he is constantly triggered by Issa and he needs to check in with himself. Issa\\u2019s open-ended relationship with Lawrence seems to spill all over the place and he does not want to be a part of that. Issa seems to take the breakup in stride and goes home. She doesn\\u2019t fight it.\", \"The next day Molly wakes her with food and love. She wants to make sure her friend is OK, but she does not know that Nathan has already broken up with her. In the bathroom, Issa gets dragged by her reflection: \\u201cYou\\u2019re down bad. I don\\u2019t know where you go from here. You were tripping about all these decisions and choices, just to end up here.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI just want to fast forward to the part of my life where everything is OK,\\u201d Issa tells her reflection.\", \"That is exactly what happens next, sort of. We fast forward to Molly\\u2019s birthday. Her mother, siblings, Taurean and Taurean\\u2019s parents are at her place to celebrate her. It is the last time Molly will celebrate a birthday with her mother, but she does not know it yet. Tiffany is in town from Denver, and Kelli has a tall hunk by her side named Desmond. The girls all seemed to have moved on in life, but not Issa. She is contemplating leaving Los Angeles. Molly encourages Issa to consider her personal growth.\", \"Molly seems to have found her tribe, her community, but so has Issa. We fast forward again to Issa\\u2019s birthday, thrown at Crenshawn headquarters, which lets us know that she chose to collaborate with him instead of going to MBW. In lieu of gifts, her assistant asked people to donate to The Blocc, and her friends donated $5,000. It is clear that Issa\\u2019s community supports her. At the party, Nathan shows up, and it is the first time they are seeing each other since his fight with Lawrence. He explains his behavior and donates some money to her in person. They iron out their wrinkles. It is nice to see them accept that they are not a good fit and walk away from each other in peace and with love.\", \"This frees Issa up. Another montage of aerial shots of Los Angeles moves us forward in time again, and the girls are finally in Denver visiting Tiffany for her birthday. Tiffany hates Denver but she is also working on figuring it out. At Tiffany\\u2019s, Lawrence is haunting Issa again.\", \"\\u201cYou know what I always wondered, what would you have said to Lawrence if Nathan hadn\\u2019t interrupted?\\u201d Molly asked Issa.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s too late, anyway!\\u201d Issa responds.\", \"\\u201cGirl it\\u2019s not too late if that\\u2019s what you really want,\\u201d Molly tells her.\", \"It is the voice in Issa\\u2019s head that tells her she can\\u2019t do the things she wants to do, that holds her back. She knows how she feels about Lawrence, yet she ignores it to be safe, to fit in, to not be out of pocket. Molly reminds her she can just do her thing.\", \"\\u201cSometimes it\\u2019s not that hard,\\u201d Molly says.\", \"Between Molly\\u2019s mother passing away and Issa learning that Kelli is pregnant, after telling everyone that she doesn\\u2019t want to have children, something shifted in Issa. That voice became smaller. The urgency of the first few episodes seems to have tripled for Issa, who is watching her peers grow, personally and professionally.\", \"That is how Issa ended up with Lawrence by the end of \\u201cInsecure.\\u201d She let go of the ideas that she had of herself and the expectations she thought her friends had for her. It was all in Issa\\u2019s head. That is where her reflection comes in: She was always talking to the mirror because her thinking was internal. In the real world, there were no expectations.\", \"What I didn\\u2019t expect in the final episode was a wedding. Even though Molly married Taurean \\u2014 and I am so happy for her \\u2014 the wedding seemed like more of a celebration between Issa and Molly, the true soul-mates on the show. We see Molly walk out of a church with Taurean and hit the dance floor, but it isn\\u2019t until Issa is helping her out of her dress that we see a ceremony of sorts. Issa is unwraps the corset of Molly\\u2019s dress, tells her that she is happy for her and we get to see their relationship become even more layered.\", \"\\u201cThere goes my girl,\\u201d Issa tells Lawrence at the wedding while staring at Molly.\", \"In this episode, at Issa\\u2019s birthday party, before she tries to kick it to a very handsome man, Kelli yells out:\", \"\\u201cShe woke up today and chose confidence!\\u201d\", \"May we all learn from Kelli, Issa, Tiffany and Molly, who each came to realize, through many tough trials and errors, that opening yourself up to the unexpected is a form of strength. Resisting such matters, whether it is a boyfriend that had a child during a breakup, a move to a place outside of what you know, changing your mind about wanting children or finally letting your guard down, does not lead to a full life \\u2014 we must remain open as people to move forward. May we all leave our insecurities behind and choose confidence.\"]","href_hash":"b63f9a3066c711ec85c76b317b002d51"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b63f9a3066c711ec85c76b317b002d51"}},
