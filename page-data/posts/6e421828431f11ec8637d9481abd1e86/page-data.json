Intermittent rain and clouds over the Cape earlier in the day had cast doubt on launch prospects, but the weather cleared by flight time, Nasa said.\", \"Live video footage webcast by Nasa showed the four crew members seated calmly and strapped into the pressurised cabin of their gleaming white SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule, wearing their helmeted white and black flight suits several minutes after liftoff.\", \"Within about 10 minutes of liftoff, the rocket's upper stage had delivered the crew capsule to Earth orbit, according to launch commentators.
