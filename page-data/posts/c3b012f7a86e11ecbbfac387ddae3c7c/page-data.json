Darlan was better than all of us on the day and he deserves it,\\\" Walsh said.\", \"\\\"The first round throw was one of the easiest of my life so to go that far was pretty cool. Not sticking one or two more together after that was frustrating because I was here in good enough shape to win it.\", \"\\\"I always hold myself in high regard for always showing up at major championships, and I've done that for seven or eight years now. It is great to get a season's best out and know I've still got it.\", \"\\\"Today I threw the same distance as I did when I won this title four years ago to win it, so that shows men's shot put has come on leaps and bounds. If you don't go with it, you get left behind. I know I'm a better thrower and a better athlete than four years ago and it is now about me and my team figuring out how to throw even further.\\\"\", \"Aucklander Olivia McTaggart claimed sixth in the women's pole vault courtesy of her ice cool third time clearance at 4.60m.\", \"Despite being given a late invite, only arriving in Belgrade a little over 48 hours before the competition and competing in brand new poles, the 22-year-old vaulter shrugged off the challenges to perform in the biggest competition of her life.\", \"Comfortably soaring over her opening two heights at 4.30m and 4.45m, McTaggart then survived a scare at 4.60m before a clutch third time clearance guaranteed a top six finish.\", \"The 4.70m height - which would have been a 5cm PB plus an automatic entry standard for the 2022 World Championships - was beyond her.\", \"Sandi Morris, the US vaulter, mounted a successful defence of her title winning with a best of 4.80m to defeat her compatriot Olympic champion Katie Nageotte (4.75m), who had to settle for silver.\", \"\\\"I'm very happy, it was awesome to come out at my first major and get a result like that,\\\" McTaggart said.\", \"Unable to take her regular competition poles because airlines could not transport them, she competed on brand new poles which had been bought in Europe.\", \"Despite this she cleared her first two heights with the minimum of fuss.\", \"\\\"It was a massive relief to come out at 4.30m and make a first-time clearance and I knew after my 4.45m clearance I had 4.60m in me. Although, I was sweating in my boots a bit needing a final attempt to clear hat height.\", \"\\\"Competing here was completely on another level to any other competition I've been at, and I was nervous coming in feeling I might not belong here. But I had been given an invite, so to come away with sixth against girls I've looked up to for years was an awesome experience. I just wanted to make people back home very proud of me and I think I've done that.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"c3b012f7a86e11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c3b012f7a86e11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
