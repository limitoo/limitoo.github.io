Here are some of the shows, specials and movies coming to TV this week, Nov. 29-Dec. 5. Details and times are subject to change.\", \"WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY (1971) 7 p.m. on AMC. When the reclusive, illusive candy man Willy Wonka (Gene Wilder) opens the doors to his chocolate factory, a young, impoverished boy, Charlie (Peter Ostrum), joins four spoiled children for a wild, mysterious ride. Consider this your golden ticket, granting you entry into the world of magical chocolate-coated trinkets and confections of unusual design, where teacups you can sip from and take a bite out of grow from the ground, and where nothing is as it seems \\u2014 not even the wallpaper.\", \"AN AFFAIR TO REMEMBER (1957) 10:15 p.m. on TCM. While en route to reunite with their respective partners, Nickie Ferrannte (Cary Grant) and Terry McKay (Deborah Kerr) meet, fall passionately in love and devise a plot to rendezvous at the top of the Empire State Building in six months. Will this be time enough to sort out all their current affairs and stay in love? Or will their story of love, like so many others, also be one of heartbreak? (One might notice the parallels between this sentimental classic and the 1993 film \\u201cSleepless in Seattle,\\u201d with Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan.)\", \"89TH ANNUAL CHRISTMAS IN ROCKEFELLER CENTER 8 p.m. on NBC. Join the festivities celebrating the annual lighting of the Christmas tree in Rockefeller Center. This year\\u2019s tree is a 79-foot-tall, 46-foot-wide Norway spruce from Elkton, Md., that weighs nearly 12 tons. It will be speckled with over 50,000 lights and topped with a Swarovski star. The NBC anchors Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb, Al Roker and Craig Melvin will host, with performances by the Radio City Rockettes, Alessia Cara, Norah Jones, Brad Paisley, Rob Thomas, Carrie Underwood and more.\", \"ANNIE LIVE! 8 p.m. on NBC. Taraji P. Henson plays the domineering orphanage matron Miss Hannigan in this live production of the beloved, Tony-winning musical \\u201cAnnie!\\u201d The story follows a spunky little orphan, Annie (Celina Smith), who is determined to find her family. She is taken under the wing of a billionaire, Oliver Warbucks (Harry Connick Jr.), and charms her way around New York City \\u2014 until her quest to find her parents is interrupted by a wicked plan. In this live production, Tituss Burgess plays Miss Hannigan\\u2019s weasel of a brother, Rooster.\", \"THE MASK (1994) 8 p.m. Syfy. Stuck in a daily routine of humdrum, menial tasks, a bank clerk, Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey), is at his wit\\u2019s end. Then a mysterious mask appears, giving him the ability to transform into a zany, devil-may-care alter ego. His world spins out of control. Stanley hopes to win over a nightclub performer, Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz). But as he falls deeper into the mask\\u2019s allure, he risks forgetting who he really is.\", \"MICHAEL JACKSON\\u2019S THIS IS IT (2009) 4 p.m. on Showtime. Created from over a hundred hours of footage, this documentary follows Michael Jackson from April 2009 until his death in June of that year, as he rehearsed for a string of shows which had sold out the O2 arena in London. B-roll footage of behind-the-scenes moments and recordings of dress rehearsals capture creativity and determination during the final months of the superstar\\u2019s life, though the documentary, released months after Jackson\\u2019s death, steers clear of the descriptions of abuse that have become central to his legacy. In her review for The New York Times, Manohla Dargis called the film \\u201cweird and watchable, by turns frustrating and entertaining, and predictably a little morbid.\\u201d\", \"KINGDOMS OF THE SKY: HIMALAYA 10 p.m. on PBS (check local listings). Set aside an hour to trek across the highest mountain range on earth. Yes, it only takes an hour \\u2014 if you\\u2019re watching from home, that is. Follow along as this episode of \\u201cKingdoms of the Sky\\u201d brings the wildlife and the people of the Himalayan mountain range into view.\", \"DIE HARD (1988) 6 p.m. on Syfy. When a New York cop attends a Christmas party in Los Angeles at the exact time its guests are taken hostage, what happens? He takes matters into his own hands. Bruce Willis stars as John McClane, opposite Alan Rickman as McClane\\u2019s rival, Hans Gruber, in this action-packed, tongue-in-cheek, take-down-the-bad-guys movie. \\u201cThe film is largely a special-effects carnival full of machine-gun fire, roaring helicopters and an exploding tank,\\u201d Caryn James wrote in her review of the film for The Times in 1988. If the first round isn\\u2019t enough, continue the evening with DIE HARD 2 (1990), which follows on Syfy at 9 p.m.\", \"SOMETHING\\u2019S COMING: WEST SIDE STORY - A SPECIAL EDITION OF 20/20 7 p.m. on ABC. Before Steven Spielberg\\u2019s film adaptation of \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d hits theaters on Dec. 10, this prime-time program will revisit the history and making of that musical. Catch interviews with artists who helped shape the show, historians and performers from productions both old and new, including Rita Moreno, Chita Rivera, Ansel Elgort, Rachel Zegler, and Ariana DeBose, who, in Spielberg\\u2019s movie, has the formidable task of taking on a role once played by Moreno. \\u201cNot only am I remaking \\u2018West Side Story,\\u2019\\u201d DeBose recently told The Times Style Magazine, \\u201cbut I\\u2019m stepping into Rita Moreno\\u2019s shoes \\u2014 and she is beloved not only by Latinos but by the entire industry and musical fandom.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"82ef7f1850da11ec971f6b3fa30964c2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"82ef7f1850da11ec971f6b3fa30964c2"}},
