It's made the affordability test so hard now that the average New Zealander who was not vulnerable cannot obtain the credit they could previously.\\\"\", \"In some cases, Shanks said banks were refusing loan applications or drastically cutting the amount they would lend because people were spending too much on takeaway food and coffees.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/97123/eight_col_99049780_l.jpg?1582785724\\\" alt=\\\"Seal denied stamped on a document and fountain pen.
