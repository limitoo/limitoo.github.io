Kushner is an enthusiastic quoter, citing famous and obscure people from the past as if they were old friends; de Cleyre, an associate of the turn-of-the-20th-century American revolutionary Emma Goldman, was a fervent advocate for workers\\u2019 rights and sexual equality \\u2014 exactly the kind of little-known but nonetheless consequential figure that occasionally shows up in Kushner\\u2019s writing. The sentence in question, it will turn out, may or may not be from de Cleyre, and may or may not be exactly as Kushner cites it \\u2014 we were on a park bench, after all, not in a library \\u2014 but whoever said it first, it\\u2019s now among my favorite Kushner quotes: \\u201cDare to participate in the great historical mistake of your time.\\u201d\", \"The particular mistake he has in mind is \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d a new movie, directed by Steven Spielberg, based on the beloved, problematic 1957 Broadway musical set among the white ethnic and Puerto Rican youth gangs of Manhattan. The screenplay, which revises Arthur Laurents\\u2019s original book, is by Kushner, who has been collaborating with Spielberg for nearly 20 years, through \\u201cMunich\\u201d (2005), \\u201cLincoln\\u201d (2012) and other unconsummated and upcoming films.\", \"Kushner doesn\\u2019t mean that he regrets the project. On the contrary, he\\u2019s intensely proud of the ways he, Spielberg and the rest of the creative team have reimagined a show that\\u2019s itself a reimagining of William Shakespeare\\u2019s \\u201cRomeo and Juliet.\\u201d Citing de Cleyre seems to be his way of acknowledging the risks and contradictions inherent in any ambitious work of art that tackles the thorny American realities of race, class, immigration and identity. But he\\u2019s also, in the spirit of the present time, anticipating some of the criticism that might greet a 65-year-old white man\\u2019s attempt to tell a story largely about Latino teenagers.\", \"Before we move on from de Cleyre, we\\u2019re interrupted by one of those New York encounters that are the city\\u2019s way of mocking the idea of coincidence. \\u201cHey, there\\u2019s Tony,\\u201d someone calls out. I also go by Tony, so Kushner and I turn our heads in unison to see a distinguished-looking couple approaching, accompanied by an equally distinguished-looking dog. For a moment, I think the silver-haired man with the neatly trimmed beard is one of my in-laws or former editors but, in fact, it\\u2019s Steven Spielberg, out on a stroll with his wife, the actress Kate Capshaw, in town from California to celebrate their 30th anniversary.\", \"A few days before, Spielberg and Kushner had been in Los Angeles, wrapping production of \\u201cThe Fabelmans,\\u201d a story based on Spielberg\\u2019s own childhood. They had written the script together on Zoom over eight weeks in late 2020. \\u201cThe fastest Tony Kushner has ever written anything in his entire life,\\u201d Spielberg says by phone a week later, describing the process for their previous collaborations: \\u201cTony and I would meet about a story, I would download my entire position on the story and how I felt about it and Tony would go away and he\\u2019d write. He\\u2019d come back in seven years or five years with a script.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cVery Steven Spielberg\\u201d is a famous line from \\u201cAngels in America,\\u201d the two-part, more-than-seven-hour play that established Kushner as one of the leading dramatists of our time. \\u201cAngels\\u201d premiered in 1991, long before his creative partnership with Spielberg began; in the play, the filmmaker\\u2019s name is invoked to signal that something spectacular and cinematic is happening onstage\\u00a0\\u2014 the arrival of a literal angel in America. The sudden appearance of Spielberg himself in Central Park strikes me, by contrast, as very Tony Kushner.\", \"He has an imagination that brings to vivid life characters from history and fantasy, whether the 16th president Abraham Lincoln, the ghost of the 20th-century convicted Soviet spy Ethel Rosenberg in \\u201cAngels\\u201d or even a singing 1960s-era washing machine in \\u201cCaroline, or Change,\\u201d his 2004 Broadway musical that returned this season after Covid-19 delayed the revival\\u2019s opening last year. These characters\\u2019 presence makes the world feel at once bigger and smaller, as the grand dramas and abstractions of history and politics settle into ordinary human interactions. The moment in Central Park feels similar: Here\\u2019s the most important living American playwright and the most successful living American filmmaker conversing in the shadow of the greatest writer in the English language. But it\\u2019s also just four people chatting in the park \\u2014 about politics, movies, family, the weather \\u2014 while a dog at their feet studies the pigeons and the passing toddlers doze in their strollers.\", \"CENTRAL PARK LIES adjacent to the Upper West Side of \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d where, six decades of urban renewal and gentrification later, Kushner lives with his husband, the film historian and journalist Mark Harris. They met at a party \\u2014\\u00a0and also, around the same time, in an AOL chat room \\u2014 in 1998, then married in 2007. (Harris and I are professional acquaintances and share a book editor, and he contributes to this magazine.) In its in-between, mid-80s incarnation, Central Park figures prominently in \\u201cAngels in America\\u201d; the last scene, a poignant, defiant invocation of resilience and solidarity in the face of AIDS, takes place at the Bethesda Fountain, at 72nd Street midway between the East and West Sides, where the 19th-century sculptor Emma Stebbins\\u2019s eight-foot bronze statue, \\u201cAngel of the Waters,\\u201d seems to float above the surface.\", \"\\u201cAngels,\\u201d despite its continent-spanning title and scenes set in Utah and heaven, is a quintessential New York play. It draws on the specific demographic and geographic contours of the city to advance its capacious, intricate ideas about identity, ethical responsibility and human survival in a time of pandemic and political retrenchment. Kushner\\u2019s New York is a magnet for misfits of all kinds \\u2014 Jewish, queer, renegade Mormon \\u2014 but hardly an earthly paradise. Heaven is described as \\u201ca city much like San Francisco\\u201d (where \\u201cAngels\\u201d premiered at the Eureka Theater Company), though that\\u2019s where you go when you\\u2019re dead. New York is where everyone lives. In fact, the play\\u2019s rallying cry is \\u201cmore life!\\u201d \\u2014 a political demand during the AIDS crisis that might as well be the city\\u2019s motto. In what other place does such a cross-section of humanity \\u2014 drag queens, underemployed intellectuals, lonely housewives, closeted Republicans, actual angels \\u2014 commingle and contend? Where else does Kushner\\u2019s blend of high eloquence and borscht belt timing sound like the local vernacular? Nowhere but the city, where Kushner has lived since he arrived to attend college in 1974. (Speaking of God, one of the characters says to an audience of angels: \\u201cIf after all this destruction, if after all the terrible days of this terrible century, He returned to see ... how much suffering His abandonment had created, if all He has to offer is death. ... You should sue the bastard.\\u201d)\", \"Kushner grew up in Lake Charles, La., the setting of \\u201cCaroline, or Change,\\u201d the Broadway production of which had just started previews when we met, but even after five decades here, he is not, in any provincial, Woody Allen sense, a New York writer, obsessed with the social minutiae of a few select codes. And yet he\\u2019s undoubtedly a New York character. That isn\\u2019t code for Jewish or gay, though what the city owes its gay and Jewish citizens is beyond measure: It includes, among much else, the original \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d created by Laurents, Leonard Bernstein, Stephen Sondheim and Jerome Robbins, all of whom can be claimed by both tribes.\", \"But it\\u2019s Kushner\\u2019s voice, in person and on the page, that is New York: erudite and profane, ironic and earnest, a brilliant cascade of points and counterpoints, jokes and footnotes. Jeanine Tesori, 60, who composed the music for \\u201cCaroline\\u201d and was part of the new \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d team, told me that \\u201cthere\\u2019s no better debater than Tony Kushner.\\u201d This is true less in the high school forensic squad sense \\u2014 though he was on the debate team as a teenager \\u2014 than in the park-bench, deli-counter sense. Also in the passionate and demanding artistic-collaborator sense, which was Tesori\\u2019s point; she was referring to how intently he focused on every nuance in the \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d libretto. Argument is synonymous with many things: thought, breath, democracy, life. But argument is also secular Jewish scripture, encapsulated in the old joke that for every two Jews, there are three shuls. It\\u2019s likewise an undeniable element of gay style. The counterpointing of quasi-rabbinical disputation with camp-tinged sarcasm remains one of the central literary achievements of \\u201cAngels in America.\\u201d\", \"Not that the play or its author is in any way parochial. \\u201cI\\u2019m not a tribalist,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI believe absolutely in identity politics as a great strategy for organizing power. I believe that oppression can create distinct cultures.\\u201d A brief pause. \\u201cAt least recognizable cultures. They\\u2019re not distinct, because all boundaries are always blurred and are meant to be crossed.\\u201d This is an abstract way of explaining something that, throughout his work (including the six major plays, the Spielberg scripts and a steady stream of translations, adaptations, opera libretti and occasional essays), is breathtakingly specific \\u2014 his ability to cross into the mental, emotional and experiential worlds of people who aren\\u2019t like him in a demographic or ideological sense. He isn\\u2019t Walt Whitman. He doesn\\u2019t mystically contain multitudes. He listens and studies and thinks.\", \"Even in his 60s, his curly hair still dark and his short beard mostly gray, Kushner has a youthful energy that isn\\u2019t quite boyish but that might be described as studentlike. Maybe it\\u2019s the small round frames of his spectacles, or the iron gray denim jacket over the black T-shirt or the effortless, enthusiastic erudition of his speech, but he seems close to the Platonic ideal of a graduate teaching assistant, a guy you might encounter just uptown in a Columbia University classroom. The one who is a better teacher than the professor, and also much kinder and who is 100 times smarter than you, even though he couldn\\u2019t be that much older. Spielberg, recalling the research that went into \\u201cLincoln,\\u201d quantified it this way: \\u201cI only read a dozen books on Lincoln. Tony read 400.\\u201d\", \"KUSHNER HIMSELF WENT to Columbia, where he started as a medieval studies major before switching to English literature. But his New York roots go deeper than that. His maternal grandmother, a former seamstress, once heard Emma Goldman give a speech in Yiddish in Lower Manhattan (a detail that made its way into \\u201cAngels in America\\u201d). Kushner eventually learned that, around the same time, \\u201cshe was living in a boardinghouse on St. Marks Place, and she was probably working as a seamstress in the area. This would have been 1911, so she would have been there during the Triangle Shirtwaist fire\\u201d \\u2014 a grim incident in American labor history that took the lives of 146 mostly female, mostly immigrant garment workers.\", \"This speculation, recounted as we were comparing notes about our left-wing Jewish ancestors, hints at how Kushner thinks about history and geography. The important events we learn about in textbooks \\u2014 the Triangle fire, the battle to ratify the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery in the United States and is central to the plot of \\u201cLincoln\\u201d\\u2014 are never distant from the everyday lives of actual people. Even works of imagination have an obligation to the truth of the past. \\u201cTony doesn\\u2019t make up the history,\\u201d Tesori says. \\u201cThe history is there.\\u201d\", \"This can get complicated. For instance: \\u201cWest Side Story.\\u201d Spielberg first proposed the project to Kushner over breakfast in 2014 at Cafe Luxembourg, a stalwart bistro on West 70th Street. After several years and five drafts, they had run into a wall on a different project, an adaptation of David I. Kertzer\\u2019s 1997 book \\u201cThe Kidnapping of Edgardo Mortara,\\u201d a grand historical epic about an antisemitic crime perpetrated by the Vatican, set during the Italian Risorgimento. That morning, Spielberg switched tracks, in part because \\u201che likes to scare himself,\\u201d Kushner says \\u2014\\u00a0and the playwright was, to say the least, a bit startled: \\u201cI went home and I said to Mark, \\u2018You\\u2019re not going to believe this. He\\u2019s lost his mind. He wants to do \\u2018West Side Story.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The challenge was not only recapturing some of the power of the original Broadway show and of the 1961 movie musical \\u2014 which Kushner says has \\u201cthe greatest cultural impact in various ways, except for maybe \\u2018The Wizard of Oz,\\u2019\\u201d in cinematic history \\u2014 but also to right some of their wrongs, notably with respect to casting. The film, directed by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins, earned an Oscar for Rita Moreno in the supporting role of Anita, but she was the only Puerto Rican member of the main cast: Mar\\u00eda, the lead, was played by the white actress Natalie Wood. In the decades since, even as the film has remained popular and the stage show a fixture of high school auditoriums, \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d has come to seem dated, even offensive. Last year, the Puerto Rican writer Carina del Valle Schorske published an op-ed in The New York Times with the headline, \\u201cLet \\u2018West Side Story\\u2019 and Its Stereotypes Die,\\u201d in which she argued that \\u201cthe show\\u2019s creators didn\\u2019t know, or didn\\u2019t seem to care to know, much about their own material.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI was aware that there was a degree of criticism among Puerto Rican thinkers and artists about the representation of Puerto Ricans in West Side Story. [But] I didn\\u2019t really feel, and I don\\u2019t feel, that the musical is racist at all,\\u201d Kushner continues. \\u201cI would never have done it if I did.\\u201d Still, he knows there\\u2019s room for improvement: He cited, in particular, the way the lyrics of the anthem \\u201cAmerica\\u201d express a view of Puerto Rico as a place of unmitigated hardship \\u2014\\u00a0\\u201cyou ugly island, island of tropic diseases\\u201d \\u2014\\u00a0one that\\u2019s based in Jewish immigrants\\u2019 (and, potentially, its creators\\u2019) own feelings about Eastern Europe, which were shaped by recent memories of poverty and pogroms.\", \"The cast, which features the newcomers Rachel Zegler as Mar\\u00eda and David Alvarez as Bernardo, is more culturally diverse and younger than before \\u2014\\u00a0appropriately, since they portray teenagers who aren\\u2019t old enough, as Kushner explains, \\u201cto know what death is.\\u201d Tony and Mar\\u00eda, the Romeo and Juliet equivalents, fall in love across boundaries of communal hatred. When Tony takes the life of Mar\\u00eda\\u2019s brother Bernardo (Tybalt in Romeo and Juliet), the young couple\\u2019s fate is sealed. Kushner\\u2019s book emphasizes that tragedy partly by restoring the original Broadway order of the songs, which the 1961 film had changed. \\u201cTony felt that \\u2018West Side Story\\u2019 had very valuable things to contribute to our understanding of the consequences of racism, xenophobia and poverty,\\u201d Spielberg says. \\u201cHe kept saying that this is going to be more relevant now than it was in 1957. And that turned out to be the case.\\u201d And Kushner signed on, in part, because he wanted to explore not only the persistence of intergroup hatred but also the way the story is framed by gentrification and economic striving. In the late 1950s, a working-class Puerto Rican neighborhood is about to be uprooted by the cranes and bulldozers of the ruthless city planner Robert Moses, disrupting the life of the community to make way for, among other developments, the gleaming Lincoln Center arts complex.\", \"Still, their update isn\\u2019t about improving the past, or even casting a judgmental shadow over a beloved classic, which both collaborators grew up on. \\u201cI was a good little gay boy,\\u201d Kushner says, noting that he and his two siblings (he\\u2019s the middle kid) were the children of musicians: His father, William, was a conductor and clarinetist; his mother, Sylvia, played the bassoon. Spielberg, now 74, recalls that the album \\u201cwas the first musical theater record my parents ever brought home.\\u201d Tesori says she remains in awe of the \\u201cradicalism\\u201d of what Bernstein and his collaborators accomplished. Kushner goes even further, inscribing their gesamtkunstwerk \\u2014 a heady fusion of ballet, opera, Shakespearean tragedy and nascent youth culture \\u2014 in a pantheon of revolutionary modernist masterpieces. \\u201cYou know, like [Igor Stravinsky\\u2019s] \\u2018The Rite of Spring\\u2019 [1913], or [Stephen Sondheim\\u2019s] \\u2018Company\\u2019 [1970] \\u2014\\u00a0these moments when people come up with something brand-new, and there\\u2019s some daring, radical energy trapped inside it,\\u201d he says. \\u201cA lot of [Jean-Luc] Godard. \\u2018Jaws.\\u2019 \\u2018Close Encounters.\\u2019 \\u2018Taxi Driver.\\u2019 \\u2018Mean Streets.\\u2019 \\u2018Badlands.\\u2019 I\\u2019m sorry \\u2014 I\\u2019ll stop, but you know these things where somebody\\u2019s doing something that\\u2019s never been done before and you just can feel it, and it will always be there.\\u201d\", \"I do know. There\\u2019s one title to add to the list, a seismic event in the history of American theater that I happen to have seen myself.\", \"IN THE EARLY 1990s, when I was in my mid-20s and he was just past 50, my father came out as gay. How that came to pass \\u2014 the years in the closet and the decision to exit \\u2014 is his story to tell, not mine. But one of the ways he told it at the time, to the people who loved him, was through \\u201cAngels in America.\\u201d\", \"When \\u201cMillennium Approaches,\\u201d the first part of Kushner\\u2019s now-canonical \\u201cGay Fantasia on National Themes,\\u201d opened on Broadway in 1993, my father started buying tickets, for himself and everyone else. Throughout the rest of the run, as \\u201cMillennium\\u201d was joined later that year by its companion, \\u201cPerestroika,\\u201d there would be more tickets. As I recall, we could go back whenever we wanted \\u2014 my mother, my sister, my wife and I, other friends and relations. In the decades since, I\\u2019ve lost track of how many times I went, and stopped trying to calculate my father\\u2019s credit card bills. What I\\u2019m certain of is that I saw three of the four Roy Cohns in that first New York run (Ron Liebman, Larry Pine and F. Murray Abraham), and that some of the characters (Prior Walter, Belize, Hannah Pitt) now seem like people who have always been in my life. I can\\u2019t think of a play I know better.\", \"Or maybe I should say that knows me better. This isn\\u2019t a matter of literal identification, though like most people who qualify as complicatedly Jewish and vaguely intellectual, I inevitably see a lot of myself in the character of Louis Ironson, the perpetually guilt-ridden overthinker with a theoretical answer for everything and a practical inability to do what\\u2019s right. For a while I wondered if my father, who is not Jewish, saw himself more as the visionary Mayflower descendant Prior Walter or the self-negating Mormon Joe Pitt, but that was the wrong question.\", \"The sense of recognition \\u2014 which is to say of being recognized \\u2014 that \\u201cAngels in America\\u201d has elicited from so many people over the years comes from how clearly and specifically it represents experiences that might have seemed both too intimate and too enormous to contemplate: the devastation of the AIDS pandemic and the politics of gay visibility that emerged in response to it; the cynicism and disenchantment, felt across various American liberal and leftist denominations, of the Reagan years; the weird intimation that, with the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, history had either reached its terminus or opened a confusing new chapter.\", \"\\u201cAngels\\u201d was, in part, a re-enchantment of the American story, an attempt, by sheer force of imaginative and rational will, to square a tragic reality with an ideal of human progress. \\u201cThe play doesn\\u2019t describe a time of great triumph,\\u201d Kushner said, in an interview for \\u201cThe World Only Spins Forward,\\u201d a 2018 oral history of the production. \\u201cIt describes a time of great terror, beneath the surface of which the seeds of change are beginning to push upward and through.\\u201d Capturing that movement required a fusion of political didacticism, unabashed melodrama, stage supernaturalism and sitcom beats. The scale of the play is grand, but the tone is conversational, the epic gestures grounded in the bedrock of the everyday, the soaring themes articulated through arguments among friends, lovers, ex-friends, ex-lovers, enemies and chance acquaintances. Roy Cohn (an actual person, a lawyer, fixer and notorious hatchet man for Joseph McCarthy, whom Kushner transformed into a charismatic literary villain on the order of John Milton\\u2019s Satan) spars with Belize, a Black nurse, who mixes it up with Louis, an avatar of ambivalence, whose lover Prior Walter literally wrestles with an angel.\", \"Change is visited upon all of them, whether they embrace it or struggle against it. There may have been references, idioms and moments that resonated with my own family history \\u2014 the entwining of lefty-Jewish and high-goyish styles is a cultural double helix not far removed from my own DNA \\u2014 but in 1993, the power of \\u201cAngels\\u201d came from a more primal source. My family was changing. I was changing. The world was changing. And here was a play \\u2014 a playwright \\u2014 able to perceive how those changes might be connected, to capture a frequently dissonant, occasionally harmonious counterpoint of personal destinies, collective histories and metaphysical principles in a way that felt like the truth.\", \"\\u201cAngels in America,\\u201d Kushner\\u2019s second full-length play, after \\u201cA Bright Room Called Day\\u201d (1985), is one of those early works that define an artist\\u2019s legacy no matter what else follows. But as the play itself reminds us, the world only spins forward. In \\u201cCaroline, or Change,\\u201d completed a decade later, the personal lives of two families in Lake Charles intersect with the public dramas of 1963: the Kennedy assassination; the civil rights movement; Vietnam. The action mostly unfolds on three levels of a typical middle-class house: the upper floors, where the distant clarinetist Stuart Gellman and his wife, Rose Stopnick Gellman, struggle to raise Stuart\\u2019s sulking 8-year-old son, Noah; and the basement, where the family\\u2019s maid, Caroline Thibodeaux, keeps company with a washing machine, a dryer and a radio (all of whom find occasion to burst into song). Noah\\u2019s mother, Betty, a bassoonist, has recently died of cancer, and Rose is his new stepmother, an old friend of Stuart and Betty\\u2019s from New York struggling to heal the family and maintain her own equilibrium in alien surroundings. There are some overt parallels with Kushner\\u2019s own family: His parents were both musicians. (His mother, Sylvia, died of lung cancer at 67 in 1990, while Kushner was writing the second part of \\u201cAngels.\\u201d) Noah, a sensitive, hyperarticulate proto-gay child, is a pretty clear authorial surrogate.\", \"The center of the story, though \\u2014 the person whose capacity and resistance to change the audience comes to feel most deeply \\u2014 is Caroline, a divorced mother of four contending with her own pain. She is one of Kushner\\u2019s most incandescent creations, an operatic heroine whose passions and disappointments take shape in the interplay of performance, music and language. \\u201cThe music lets you know how uncomfortable you should be feeling,\\u201d says Sharon D Clarke, the 56-year-old British stage star who plays Caroline with volcanic intensity and heroic restraint in the latest production.\", \"Caroline is a character who courts misunderstanding, whose very presence onstage evokes painful racial tropes. \\u201cI knew that when I was writing the show that I was playing around with at least two things that were really scary,\\u201d Kushner says. \\u201cOne is a Black woman in a white maid\\u2019s uniform ... and a show that was on a very important level about money, and about Blacks and Jews, and that also can push a lot of triggering things for Jewish people.\\u201d The \\u201cchange\\u201d in the title literally refers to what\\u2019s left each week of Noah Gellman\\u2019s allowance, which Caroline retrieves from his pockets when she does the laundry. Rose tells Caroline to keep the money, both a clumsy attempt to teach the boy a lesson and a way to give Caroline a little something on top of her $30-a-week wages without actually giving her a raise.\", \"\\u201cThe first time it was on Broadway,\\u201d Kushner says, \\u201cpeople would come up to me and say things that made me want to crawl under a seat. \\u2018Oh, I was raised by a Caroline, too,\\u2019 or \\u2018My best friend was my maid also when I was a little kid.\\u2019\\u201d Never mind that one of the last things Caroline says to Noah is that they \\u201cweren\\u2019t never friends,\\u201d and that the show works to subvert, at every turn, the sentimental clich\\u00e9s that its premise seems to summon, what Clarke calls the expectation of \\u201cnatural nurturing.\\u201d \\u201cIt is not about a magical Black person who comes to take care of a bunch of sad white people,\\u201d Kushner adds. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about her. It doesn\\u2019t end with them. She doesn\\u2019t heal them. ... I defend this very heatedly, but it\\u2019s good to remember that, when you dabble with these things, you are playing around with images of immense power and force.\\u201d\", \"You also land yourself, in 2021, in a swirl of ongoing debates about representation, about how, to what extent \\u2014 and, for that matter, whether \\u2014 white artists can tell Black or Latino stories. Criticism has of late been leveled at works like Kathryn Bigelow\\u2019s \\u201cDetroit,\\u201d a 2017 film about the murder of three Black men during the city\\u2019s 1967 race riots; Jeanine Cummins\\u2019s 2020 novel, \\u201cAmerican Dirt,\\u201d about a family\\u2019s migration from Mexico to the United States; and the 2019 Best Picture-winning \\u201cGreen Book\\u201d (2018), an interracial buddy movie set in the segregated South. Meanwhile, calls for greater inclusion and representation across the arts have grown more insistent. As Kushner himself admits, \\u201cIf Steven had come to me in 2020, after George Floyd\\u2019s murder, and said, \\u2018I want to do \\u201cWest Side Story,\\u201d and I want you to write it,\\u2019 I would certainly have asked a very different set of questions.\\u201d\", \"But he wouldn\\u2019t necessarily have turned it down. And even as he acknowledges the history of exclusion and misrepresentation in movies and theater, he is troubled by the impulse to erect hard boundaries and strict rules: \\u201cI have a profound disagreement,\\u201d he says, \\u201cwith anyone who says that a person imagining another kind of person, another culture, is an act of violence or supremacism or appropriation. I absolutely believe that one of the great pleasures of art, and one of the great reasons that we have it, is to be able to witness leaps of empathic imagination.\\u201d\", \"ONE WAY TO see beyond yourself is to look backward. In a section of his 1940 \\u201cTheses on the Philosophy of History,\\u201d a key text in the composition of \\u201cAngels in America,\\u201d the German-Jewish critic Walter Benjamin imagines the angel of history flying into the future with his face \\u201cturned toward the past.\\u201d\", \"Indeed, Kushner\\u2019s best work is frequently retrospective, taking an angel\\u2019s-eye view of catastrophe and progress \\u2014 of terror and darkness and the inklings of change sprouting in the gloom. All of his collaborations with Spielberg have been set in the past, and one of the reasons the scripts take so long to write is that he treats the conventions of period filmmaking with the rigor of a historian.\", \"When it premiered on Broadway, \\u201cAngels\\u201d already had a rearview quality to it. Up until the very end, when the story moves into the \\u201990s, the scenes are set in 1985 and \\u201986, in the midst of an era that already seemed, in 1993, to be fading. The G.O.P. was no longer in the White House. Americans were still dying of AIDS in large numbers, but persistent activism had compelled the political and medical establishments to start paying attention to the epidemic. When I taught the play to a class of college freshmen a few years later, they read it as a period piece, something from \\u201cback in the \\u201980s.\\u201d On a higher-brow note, the Yale literary panjandrum Harold Bloom included the play in his idiosyncratic, best-selling \\u201cThe Western Canon: The Books and School of the Ages\\u201d in 1994, a sign that the test of time had already been stood. The 2003 HBO screen adaptation, directed by Mike Nichols, confirmed that impression, identifying the characters with movie stars \\u2014 Al Pacino as Roy Cohn, Meryl Streep as Ethel Rosenberg and Hannah Pitt \\u2014 and giving the luster and permanence of cinema to their stories.\", \"But then, in the late 2010s, a few years after Barack Obama draped the National Medal of Arts over Kushner\\u2019s neck, \\u201cAngels\\u201d surged back into the present tense. A major revival in 2017 galvanized audiences in London and then, the next year, in New York, where the play once again felt undeniably relevant: raw, uncanny and unavoidable. Prior Walter\\u2019s closing vow that \\u201cwe will be citizens\\u201d \\u2014 an assertion of gay visibility that seemed to have been confirmed by the victory of marriage equality in much of the Western world \\u2014 took on a different inflection against a backdrop of anti-immigrant agitation. Roy Cohn\\u2019s prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9, Donald Trump, was president, and lamenting his erstwhile mentor\\u2019s absence even as Cohn\\u2019s brand of cynical, mendacious, power-obsessed politics moved from behind the scenes into broad daylight, where it proved impervious to shame, mockery or indignant appeals to decency.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s infinitely more frightening now than it was back in the \\u201980s,\\u201d Kushner says of his masterwork today. \\u201cComplete with the plague.\\u201d Having identified an aspect of our \\u201cone single catastrophe,\\u201d he is still observing it. What happens now is a new iteration of what was already happening. And so, the 1963 of \\u201cCaroline, or Change\\u201d is not a version of the past that an audience in 2021 can look at with complacency, congratulating ourselves on how far we\\u2019ve come. The first thing you see on the revival\\u2019s stage is a Confederate monument, a statue of \\u201cthe South\\u2019s Defender\\u201d whose presence signifies the not-even-pastness of the past. And while there are some charming period details \\u2014 and echoes of the soul, pop and gospel sounds of the time in Tesori\\u2019s score \\u2014 there is nothing dated in the play itself. \\u201cTony is quite prophetic,\\u201d Clarke says. When the play transferred to London in 2018 after its original run in Chichester, England, the actress remembers passing by far-right, racist demonstrators on her way to the theater. \\u201cAfter growing up as a Black British child dealing with the National Front and the British National Party,\\u201d she says, \\u201cnow I was coming into work and dealing with Caroline and feeling the eyes of English Defense League guys looking at me, wanting me not to be on the street, and just feeling, \\u2018We ain\\u2019t moved on.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"During the show\\u2019s long pandemic pause between London and Broadway, the United States was convulsed by the Black Lives Matter protests and plunged into another round of arguments on old themes: the relationship between law and order and white supremacy; the persistence of structural racism and racial inequality; the deep historical roots of present-day injustice. The people onstage discuss these same issues, very much in the present tense and with their eyes turned toward an ever-elusive future. Caroline\\u2019s teenage daughter, Emmie, is drawn toward activism, and the boldness with which she expresses her opinions worries her mother, who has learned to keep her head down and her thoughts to herself, at least around white people. At a Hanukkah dinner, where Emmie is helping her mother serve latkes to the extended Gellman clan, Emmie is lured into debate with Rose\\u2019s father, a dyed-in-the-wool old leftist visiting from New York. He scolds her for being insufficiently militant, and scorns the civil rights movement for being too pacific, too slow-moving, to effect real change.\", \"The ironies and tensions that ripple through the scene \\u2014 the unexamined privilege of the white radical; Caroline\\u2019s unease among the employers who imagine themselves to be her allies; the impatience of the younger generation \\u2014 will be familiar to anyone whose dinner table has been a site of political struggle. And no resolution to the conflict is offered, even as some small changes are visible. \\u201cSecret little tragedies\\u201d coexist with \\u201ccostly, quiet victories.\\u201d Those phrases are sung one after the other near the end of the show, providing a musical landing place without settling the big issues. It\\u2019s not that the tragedies cancel out the victories but that they are bound up together.\", \"IN ACT III, Scene 2 of \\u201cMillennium Approaches,\\u201d Louis asks, \\u201cWhy has democracy succeeded in America?\\u201d It\\u2019s not exactly a rhetorical question, and Louis\\u2019s rambling attempt to answer it isn\\u2019t entirely persuasive, certainly not to his friend Belize, a Black, gay nurse who cares for men dying from AIDS-related illnesses, and who possesses an acute sense of the failures and compromises of the American experiment. (Louis\\u2019s monologue only ends when Belize, after trying to participate in the debate, finally responds, \\u201cPOWER to the people! AMEN! ... OH MY GOODNESS! Will you look at the time, I gotta. ...\\u201d)\", \"When we meet in Central Park for a second conversation (with no surprise appearances from major filmmakers), I tell Kushner that I think the argument between Louis and Belize \\u2014 a defense of good intentions and progressive tendencies countered by an insistence on the hard structural facts of exclusion, oppression and hatred \\u2014 is still ongoing, perhaps with more intensity and harder feelings than before.\", \"We talk about that for a while, and also about how the censoriousness of the left isn\\u2019t symmetrical with the authoritarianism of the right, about what Kushner calls the \\u201cradical impatience of the young,\\u201d about Twitter and TikTok and the early 20th-century German playwright Bertolt Brecht, a hero of Kushner\\u2019s, who once said, \\u201cDon\\u2019t start from the good old things but the bad new ones.\\u201d We agree more than we disagree, but the conversation nonetheless has a bracing, combative energy.\", \"Kushner\\u2019s stage and screenwriting consists of a great many family quarrels \\u2014 passionate debates among people who are fundamentally on the same side. Louis and Belize share not only their love of Prior, Louis\\u2019s former lover, who they are afraid will die of complications from AIDS, but a wary, queer New York kinship. In \\u201cLincoln,\\u201d much of the dramatic conflict takes place within the cabinet, the Congress and the Republican Party, people committed at least in principle to the defense of union and the abolition of slavery. In \\u201cCaroline, or Change,\\u201d the Southern white supremacist position is represented by that silent statue; the Gellmans are outsiders, some of whom imagine themselves to be on the angelic side of history. Kushner\\u2019s ability to call forth those family quarrels within liberalism \\u2014 their endlessness, their passion \\u2014 may ultimately be what marks him as a great New York voice. That\\u2019s the music of the city, after all. It\\u2019s also the music of democracy, the soundtrack to the perpetually embattled American experiment.\", \"Which is in a scary place right now. Eventually, Kushner jokes that Louis\\u2019s rhetorical question might have to be amended or scrapped altogether. Democracy may not be succeeding in America, and the grand argument that connects President Lincoln to Caroline Thibodeaux may be heading toward a murderous Jets and Sharks rumble.\", \"Neutrality, for Kushner, is never an option. \\u201cI always get annoyed when people talk about theater that preaches to the converted,\\u201d he says. \\u201cThat\\u2019s so stupid. Who do you expect to find in your synagogue?\\u2009... When I teach playwriting, I always tell my students \\u2014 and it\\u2019s almost impossible to do this particular thing without having some sort of phantom audience in your head \\u2014 that you should work really hard to populate that audience with people who fundamentally agree with you about certain things. Because if you don\\u2019t, then you start from a position of needing to educate them about that which you already know, which I think guarantees didacticism and a certain dullness. The place that you want to start is those great arguments that you have with your friends.\\u201d\", \"What you want to do, in other words, is dare to participate in the great historical mistake of your time.\"]","href_hash":"ab99adf651c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ab99adf651c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}},
