Trump are trying to overhaul elections \\u2014 takes direct aim at the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission, an agency Republicans created half a decade ago that has been under attack since the chaotic aftermath of last year\\u2019s election.\", \"The firestorm picked up late last month after a long-awaited report on the 2020 results that was ordered by Republican state legislators found no evidence of fraud but made dozens of suggestions for the election commission and the G.O.P.-led Legislature, turbocharging Republican demands for more control of elections.\", \"Then the Trump-aligned sheriff of Racine County, the state\\u2019s fifth most populous county, recommended felony charges against five of the six members of the election commission for guidance they had given to municipal clerks early in the pandemic. The Republican majority leader of the State Senate later seemed to give a green light to that proposal, saying that \\u201cprosecutors around the state\\u201d should determine whether to bring charges.\", \"And last week, Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican, said that G.O.P. state lawmakers should unilaterally assert control of federal elections, claiming that they had the authority to do so even if Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, stood in their way \\u2014 an extraordinary legal argument debunked by a 1932 Supreme Court decision and a 1964 ruling from the Wisconsin Supreme Court. His suggestion was nonetheless echoed by Michael Gableman, a conservative former State Supreme Court justice who is conducting the Legislature\\u2019s election inquiry.\", \"Republican control of Wisconsin elections is necessary, Mr. Johnson said in an interview on Wednesday, because he believes Democrats cheat.\", \"\\u201cDo I expect Democrats to follow the rules?\\u201d said the senator, who over the past year has promoted fringe theories on topics like the Capitol riot and Covid vaccines. \\u201cUnfortunately, I probably don\\u2019t expect them to follow the rules. And other people don\\u2019t either, and that\\u2019s the problem.\\u201d\", \"The uproar over election administration in Wisconsin \\u2014 where the last two presidential contests have been decided by fewer than 23,000 votes each \\u2014 is heightened by the state\\u2019s deep divisions and its pivotal place in American politics.\", \"Some top Republican officials in Wisconsin privately acknowledge that their colleagues are playing to the party\\u2019s base by calling for state election officials to be charged with felonies or for their authority to be usurped by lawmakers.\", \"Adding to the uncertainty, Mr. Johnson\\u2019s proposal has not yet been written into legislation in Madison. Mr. Evers has vowed to stop it.\", \"\\u201cThe outrageous statements and ideas Wisconsin Republicans have embraced aren\\u2019t about making our elections stronger, they\\u2019re about making it more difficult for people to participate in the democratic process,\\u201d Mr. Evers said Thursday. The G.O.P.\\u2019s election proposals, he added, \\u201care nothing more than a partisan power grab.\\u201d\", \"Yet there is no guarantee that the Republican push will fall short legally or politically. The party\\u2019s lawmakers in other states have made similar moves to gain more control over election apparatus. And since the G.O.P. won control of the Wisconsin Legislature in 2010, the state has served as an incubator for conservative ideas exported to other places.\", \"\\u201cIn Wisconsin we\\u2019re heading toward a showdown over the meaning of the clause that says state legislatures should set the time, manner and place of elections,\\u201d said Kevin J. Kennedy, who spent 34 years as Wisconsin\\u2019s chief election officer before Republicans eliminated his agency and replaced it with the elections commission in 2016. \\u201cIf not in Wisconsin, in some other state they\\u2019re going to push this and try to get a U.S. Supreme Court ruling on this.\\u201d\", \"Next year, Wisconsin will host critical elections for Mr. Johnson\\u2019s Senate seat and for statewide offices, including the governor. Rebecca Kleefisch, the leading Republican in the race to challenge Mr. Evers, is running on a platform of eliminating the state election commission. (On Monday, she filed a lawsuit against the agency asking the Wisconsin Supreme Court to declare that the commission\\u2019s guidance violates state law.)\", \"The Republican anger at the Wisconsin Elections Commission, a body of three Democrats and three Republicans that G.O.P. lawmakers created in part to eliminate the investigatory powers of its predecessor agency, comes nearly 20 months after commissioners issued guidance to local election clerks on how to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.\", \"Republicans have seized in particular on a March 2020 commission vote lifting a rule that required special voting deputies \\u2014 trained and dispatched by municipal clerks\\u2019 offices \\u2014 to visit nursing homes twice before issuing absentee ballots to residents. The special voting deputies, like most other visitors, were barred from entering nursing homes early in the pandemic, and the commission reasoned that there was not enough time before the April primary election to require them to be turned away before mailing absentee ballots.\", \"The vote was relatively uncontroversial at the time: No lawsuits from Republicans or anyone else challenged the guidance. The procedure remained in place for the general election in November.\", \"But after Joseph R. Biden Jr. won Wisconsin by 20,682 votes out of 3.3 million cast, Republicans began making evidence-free claims of fraudulent votes cast from nursing homes across the state. Sheriff Christopher Schmaling of Racine County said the five state election commissioners who had voted to allow clerks to mail absentee ballots to nursing homes without the visit by special voting deputies \\u2014 as is prescribed by state law \\u2014 should face felony charges for election fraud and misconduct in office.\", \"Robin Vos, the Republican speaker of the State Assembly, who represents Racine County, quickly concurred, saying that the five commissioners \\u2014 including his own appointee to the panel \\u2014 should \\u201cprobably\\u201d face felony charges.\", \"The commissioners have insisted they broke no laws.\", \"Ann Jacobs, a Democrat who is the commission\\u2019s chairwoman, said she had no regrets about making voting easier during the pandemic and added that \\u201ceven my Republican colleagues\\u201d were afraid about the future of fair elections in the state.\", \"\\u201cWe did everything we could during the pandemic to help people vote,\\u201d she said. \", \"Mr. Johnson \\u2014 a two-term senator who said he would announce a decision on whether to seek re-election \\u201cin the next few weeks\\u201d \\u2014 is lobbying Republican state legislators, with whom he met last week at the State Capitol, to take over federal elections.\", \"\\u201cThe State Legislature has to reassert its constitutional role, assert its constitutional responsibility, to set the times, place and manner of the election, not continue to outsource it through the Wisconsin Elections Commission,\\u201d Mr. Johnson said. \\u201cThe Constitution never mentions a governor.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Johnson acknowledged that his proposal could leave the state with dueling sets of election regulations, one from the Wisconsin Elections Commission and another from the Legislature.\", \"\\u201cI suppose some counties will handle it one way and other counties will handle it another,\\u201d he said.\", \"Even if Republican lawmakers adopted Mr. Johnson\\u2019s proposal, it would apply only to federal elections, not those for state office.\", \"Mr. Vos told reporters in Madison he had not studied whether Wisconsin legislators could take control of federal elections without the governor\\u2019s input. Devin LeMahieu, a Republican who is the State Senate majority leader, has expressed doubts about Mr. Johnson\\u2019s legal theory.\", \"The state\\u2019s grass-roots conservatives remain angry about Mr. Biden\\u2019s victory and the failure of Republicans to undertake an Arizona-style review of ballots cast in Wisconsin last year. At least 10 Republican state lawmakers have called for the resignation of Meagan Wolfe, the commission\\u2019s nonpartisan administrator, or of the election commissioners, according to The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\", \"If Ms. Wolfe were to resign, her replacement would require a majority vote of the evenly split commission. If it could not reach agreement in 45 days, the State Senate, controlled by Republicans, would choose.\", \"\\u201cThe current director of W.E.C. needs to step down,\\u201d State Senator Duey Stroebel, a Republican who sits on his chamber\\u2019s elections committee, said in an interview. \\u201cMaybe we give it another try with the W.E.C., but this administrator has proved to be incompetent and not always willing to follow the law.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Wolfe said on Thursday that Republicans\\u2019 goal was \\u201cto pressure nonpartisan election administrators like me into resigning or vacating the election space so we can be replaced by political actors who can be convinced to carry out a partisan mission.\\u201d\", \"At the same time, some Wisconsin Republicans continue to challenge the 2020 outcome.\", \"On Wednesday, Timothy S. Ramthun, a Republican member of the State Assembly, formally proposed decertifying Wisconsin\\u2019s election results, reclaiming the state\\u2019s \\u201c10 fraudulent electoral ballots\\u201d cast for Mr. Biden and conducting \\u201ca full forensic physical and cyber audit\\u201d of the election.\", \"Anticipating Mr. Ramthun\\u2019s proposal, the Legislature\\u2019s lawyers issued a report on Nov. 1 stating that there was \\u201cno mechanism\\u201d under the law to reverse a certified election.\", \"\\u201cI invite you to see it from the eyes of the people,\\u201d Mr. Ramthun wrote to fellow legislators, urging them to correct \\u201cthe most egregious injustice we have seen in our time.\\u201d\", \"The next day, Mr. Trump publicly congratulated Mr. Ramthun.\", \"Wisconsin Democrats, exasperated and locked out of power in the Legislature, have been left to issue increasingly dire warnings.\", \"\\u201cIf this was some kind of Hollywood farce or a madcap political comedy, you would say that\\u2019s not credible even for a fake show,\\u201d said Kelda Roys, a Democratic state senator. \\u201cThere\\u2019s real consequences to this. It\\u2019s designed to take away the guardrails to our democracy that keep us fair and free.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8b955ffe492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8b955ffe492111ecb5e70f5f1e0d22c9"}},
