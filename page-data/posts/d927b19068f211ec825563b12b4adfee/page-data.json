Hospitality outlets must be contactless only.\", \"Epidemiologist professor Michael Baker urges people to stay vigilant while having more freedom and to get a test if they have symptoms.\", \"\\\"Some people will be infected without having symptoms so it is important everyone is alert to getting tested if they have any symptoms.
