But now the Cupertino, California, company can't seem to keep up with the steadily surging demand for a device that has become even more crucial in the burgeoning era of remote work.\", \"Apple's inability to fully satisfy the voracious appetite for iPhones stems from a pandemic-driven shortage of chips that's affecting the production of everything from automobiles to medical devices.\", \"But Apple so far has navigated the shortfalls better than most companies. That deft management enabled Apple to report iPhone sales of $71.6 billion for the October-December period, a 9% increase from the same time in the previous year.\", \"Those sales gains would have likely been even more robust if Apple could have secured all the chips and other components needed to make iPhones. That problem plagued Apple's July-September quarter\\u00a0when management estimated\\u00a0that supply shortages reduced its iPhone sales by about $6 billion. The company may address how supply shortages affected its performance in the most recent quarter during a conference call with analysts scheduled later Thursday.\", \"Despite what drag the shortages caused, Apple still earned $34.6 billion, or $2.10 per share, a 20% increase from the same time in the previous year. Revenue climbed from the previous year by 11% to $123.95 billion. Both its revenue and profits are a quarterly record for the tech giant.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We would characterize this quarter as a major statement on iPhone/services demand and Cupertino's ability to navigate a supply chain shortage in almost Teflon-like fashion,\\\" Wedbush analysts Daniel Ives and John Katsingris said in a research note.\", \"Apple's ongoing success help push the company's market value above $3 trillion for the first time earlier this month. But its stock price has tumbled 13% since hitting that peak amid worries about a projected rise in interest rates aimed at dampening the torrid pace of inflation that has been fueled in part by supply shortages.\", \"Its shares gained more than 3% in Thursday's extended trading after the Apple's fiscal first-quarter numbers came out.\", \"The supply issues looming around Apple's devices have magnified the importance of the company's services division, which is fueled by commissions from digital transactions on iPhone apps, subscriptions to music and video streaming and repair plans.\", \"The up to 30% commissions collects from apps distributed through Apple's exclusive app store have become a focal point of a fierce legal battle that unfolded in\\u00a0a high-stakes trial year, as well as proposed reforms recently introduced in the U.S. Senate that tear down the company's barriers that prevent consumers from using alternative payment systems.\", \"For now, though, the services division is still booming. Its revenue in the past quarter hit $19.52 billion, a 24% increase.\", \"Apple is widely believed to be maneuvering toward another potentially huge money-making opportunity with the introduction of an augmented reality headset that would project digital images and information while its users interact with other physical objects and people. True to its secretive form, the company has never said it is working on that kind of technology.\", \"But Apple CEO Tim Cook has openly shared his enthusiasm for the potential of augmented reality in public presentations, and analysts believe the long-rumored headset could finally roll out later this year \\u2014 unless it's delayed by supply shortages.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"3c2a2f167fcd11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3c2a2f167fcd11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
