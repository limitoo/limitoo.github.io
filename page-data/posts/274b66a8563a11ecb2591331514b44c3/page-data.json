Longtime slugger Dick Allen, who died last December, fell one vote shy of election.\", \"The six newcomers will be enshrined in Cooperstown, New York, on July 24, 2022, along with any new members elected by the Baseball Writers' Association of America. First-time candidates David Ortiz and Alex Rodriguez join Barry Bonds, Roger Clemens and Curt Schilling on the ballot, with voting results on Jan. 25.\", \"Passed over in previous Hall elections, the new members reflect a diversity of accomplishments.\", \"This was the first time O'Neil, Mi\\u00f1oso and Fowler had a chance to make the Hall under new rules honoring Negro League contributions. Last December, the statistics of some 3,400 players were added to Major League Baseball's record books when MLB said it was \\\"correcting a longtime oversight in the game's history\\\" and reclassifying the Negro Leagues as a major league.\", \"\\\"Jubilation,\\\" said Bob Kendrick, president of the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, Missouri, that O'Neil helped create, after the voting results were announced.\", \"O'Neil was a two-time All-Star first baseman in the Negro Leagues and the first Black coach in the National or American leagues. He became a remarkable ambassador for the sport until his death in 2006 at 94 and already is honored with a life-sized statue inside the Hall of Fame in Cooperstown.\", \"For all O'Neil did for the game his entire life, many casual fans weren't entirely familiar with him until they watched the nine-part Ken Burns documentary \\\"Baseball,\\\" which first aired on PBS in 1994.\", \"There, O'Neil's grace, wit and vivid storytelling brought back to life the times of Negro Leagues stars Satchel Paige, Josh Gibson and Cool Papa Bell, plus the days of many more Black ballplayers whose names were long forgotten.\", \"Kendrick said it was too bad O'Neil won't be in Cooperstown for the induction ceremonies next July 22, \\\"but you know his spirit is going to fill the valley,\\\" he said on MLB Network.\", \"Mi\\u00f1oso was a two-time All-Star in the Negro Leagues before becoming the first Black player for the Chicago White Sox in 1951. Born in Havana, \\\"The Cuban Comet\\\" was seven-time All-Star while with the White Sox and Indians.\", \"There was nothing mini about Saturnino Orestes Armas Mi\\u00f1oso on the field. He hit over .300 eight times with Cleveland and Chicago, led the AL in stolen bases three times, reached double digits in home runs most every season and won three Gold Gloves in left field.\", \"Mi\\u00f1oso finished up, or so it seemed, in 1964. He came back at age 50 for the White Sox in 1976 \\u2014 going 1 for 8 \\u2014 and batted twice in 1980, giving him five decades of playing pro ball.\", \"The White Sox retired his No. 9 in 1983 and he remained close to the organization and its players before his death in 2015.\", \"Fowler, born in 1858, is often regarded as the first Black professional baseball player. The pitcher and second baseman helped create the popular Page Fence Giants barnstorming team.\", \"Hodges became the latest Brooklyn Dodgers star from \\\"The Boys of Summer\\\" to reach the Hall, joining Jackie Robinson, Duke Snider, Roy Campanella and Pee Wee Reese.\", \"An eight-time All-Star and three-time Gold Glover at first base, Hodges enhanced his legacy when he managed the 1969 \\\"Miracle Mets\\\" to the World Series championship, a startling five-game win over heavily favored Baltimore.\", \"Hodges was still the Mets' manager when he suffered a heart attack during spring training in 1972 and died at 47.\", \"Oliva was a three-time AL batting champion with the Twins whose career was cut short by knee problems. Kaat was 283-237 in 25 seasons and a 16-time Gold Glove winner.\", \"O'Neil and Fowler were selected by the Early Days committee. Hodges, Mi\\u00f1oso, Oliva and Kaat were chosen by the Golden Days committees.\", \"The 16-member panels met separately in Orlando, Florida. The election announcement was originally scheduled to coincide with the big league winter meetings, which were nixed because of the MLB lockout.\", \"It took 12 votes (75%) for selection: Mi\\u00f1oso drew 14, O'Neil got 13 and Hodges, Oliva, Kaat and Fowler each had 12. Allen had 11.\", \"O'Neil played 10 years in the Negro Leagues and helped the Kansas City Monarchs win championships as a player and manager. His numbers were hardly gaudy \\u2014  a .258 career batting average, nine home runs.\", \"But what John Jordan O'Neil Jr. meant to baseball can never be measured by numbers alone.\", \"O'Neil became the first Black coach in American League or National League history with the Chicago Cubs and enjoyed a prolific career as a scout.\", \"His impact is visible to this day.\", \"Along with his statue in Cooperstown, the Hall's board of directors periodically present the Buck O'Neil Lifetime Achievement Award to a person whose \\\"whose extraordinary efforts enhanced baseball's positive impact on society ... and whose character, integrity and dignity\\\" mirror those shown by O'Neil.\", \"In 2006, it appeared O'Neil would get to soak in the praise earned for his work when the Special Committee on Negro Leagues convened to study candidates for the Hall of Fame. The panel indeed elected 17 new members but O'Neil was not among them, narrowly missing out.\", \"O'Neil was chosen to speak on behalf of those 17 newcomers, all deceased, on induction day at Cooperstown. True to his nature, he didn't emit a single word of remorse and regret about his own fate of being left out.\", \"Two months later, O'Neil died in Kansas City.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"274b66a8563a11ecb2591331514b44c3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"274b66a8563a11ecb2591331514b44c3"}},
