Ms. Fields called and waited by the car. Soon, the landlord came downstairs.\", \"\\u201cI started panicking,\\u201d Ms. Fields said, choking back tears. \\u201cAll I could do was just stand there, like if I was frozen. I could not believe what he was telling me, that my baby was gone.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Fields\\u2019s daughter, Lauren Smith-Fields, had been found dead the day before. Ms. Fields said the Bridgeport Police Department never informed her family about the death.\", \"The landlord gave them the number for a detective, who told her son in a phone call that Ms. Smith-Fields, 23, had been on a Bumble date with an older man before she died. But the detective provided little additional information, Ms. Fields said, and hung up abruptly during a subsequent phone call.\", \"The family had to beg the detective to collect evidence found in the apartment, their lawyer said. The detective also told the family not to worry about the man who had been there that night, saying that he was \\u201ca really nice guy,\\u201d Ms. Fields said.\", \"\\u201cMy daughter\\u2019s laying there dead and he gets to walk away,\\u201d she said.\", \"The man, whom The New York Times is not naming because he has not been charged with a crime, spoke to the authorities when they arrived on the scene on Dec. 12, the day Ms. Smith-Fields was pronounced dead.\", \"The police would not say whether he had been taken in for questioning, or if he was considered a person of interest in the case. His lawyer said he cooperated with the police that day and declined to comment further.\", \"Ms. Smith-Fields graduated from Stamford High School, and was studying physical therapy at Norwalk Community College. She was active on social media, posting about beauty and travel.\", \"Weeks passed after her death, her family said, with few updates provided by the authorities. On Sunday, which would have been her 24th birthday, they were joined by friends, community members and activists as they marched to the Bridgeport mayor\\u2019s office, demanding that something be done. They had a cake, sang \\u201cHappy Birthday\\u201d and released pink and red balloons into the sky.\", \"Following the march, the mayor, Joseph P. Ganim, made what appeared to be his first substantive remarks about the case.\", \"He confirmed an earlier statement by the Police Department that the handling of Ms. Smith-Fields\\u2019s death was being investigated by the Office of Internal Affairs. A spokeswoman for the police said that the detective who had spoken to the family, Kevin Cronin, had been moved off the case.\", \"\\u201cDeath notifications should be done in a manner that illustrates dignity for the deceased and respect and compassion for the family,\\u201d Mr. Ganim said.\", \"Ms. Smith-Fields\\u2019s family has said they plan to sue Mr. Ganim, the police chief and several detectives. They filed a notice of intention last week, arguing that the Police Department violated the Civil Rights Act by failing to provide Ms. Smith-Fields and her family due process.\", \"As attention increased on the case, galvanized by social media, the Connecticut Office of the Chief Medical Examiner on Monday released the cause of Ms. Smith-Fields\\u2019s death: an overdose of fentanyl combined with prescription medication and alcohol. The office ruled her death an accident.\", \"A day later, in response to the medical examiner\\u2019s findings, the Bridgeport Police Department opened a criminal investigation into the death.\", \"More than 1,350 people died from drug overdoses in Connecticut in 2021, according to state data. Fentanyl was the most common drug involved in those deaths.\", \"\\u201cThe Bridgeport Police Department continues to treat the untimely death of Lauren Smith-Fields as an active investigation,\\u201d Rebeca Garcia, the chief of police, said in a statement.\", \"Darnell Crosland, the family\\u2019s lawyer, believes the criminal investigation should have been opened as soon as Ms. Smith-Fields was found dead.\", \"\\u201cWe thought from the beginning that there was foul play here,\\u201d Mr. Crosland said.\", \"He added: \\u201cWhen you launch an investigation, that investigation must start with and include the last living person that reported the death of the other person.\\u201d\", \"The slow response from law enforcement and delayed news coverage of the death of Ms. Smith-Fields, who was Black, has renewed conversation around \\u201cMissing White Woman Syndrome,\\u201d a phrase, coined by the PBS anchor Gwen Ifill nearly two decades ago, that describes the attention paid to white women who appear to be in harm\\u2019s way while Black women in similar situations are often ignored.\", \"\\u201cAfter the Gabby Petito case, I felt, just from my perspective, that we were starting to see more equitable coverage,\\u201d said Danielle Slakoff, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Sacramento State University. Ms. Petito was a 22-year-old white woman who went missing last September and was later found to have been strangled to death. Her case had the media transfixed.\", \"\\u201cBut then Lauren\\u2019s case happened and I saw that really it was the family and social media that were keeping this case going, that were keeping the interest going, and it was disappointing,\\u201d Dr. Slakoff said. \\u201cThe family deserves the space to grieve, and instead they are, in this story, trying to get justice for her.\\u201d\", \"The bulk of the information the family has received about the death of Ms. Smith-Fields comes from an incident report by the Bridgeport Police Department.\", \"According to those records, her date, who is 37 and white, told investigators that he had first connected with Ms. Smith-Fields on Bumble, a popular dating app.\", \"She invited him over to her apartment after three days of chatting. On the evening of Dec. 11, they ate food, drank tequila with mixers, played games and began to watch a movie.\", \"At one point, he told investigators, she went outside to meet with her brother, and when she returned, she went to the bathroom for 10 to 15 minutes.\", \"Her date told investigators that they continued to watch the movie and Ms. Smith-Fields then fell asleep on the couch, and he carried her to her bedroom. He fell asleep beside her, he said, adding that when he woke up at 3 a.m. to use the bathroom, she was asleep and snoring.\", \"But when he woke up again at 6:30 a.m., \\u201cshe was lying on her right side, blood was coming out of her right nostril onto the bed, and she was not breathing,\\u201d he told investigators. He called 911.\", \"\\u201cHe was trembling and visibly shaken,\\u201d the responding officer, Carla Remele, said in the report.\", \"She found Ms. Smith-Fields lying on her back on the bedroom floor. Ms. Smith-Fields wasn\\u2019t breathing and she had dried blood in and around her right nostril, according to the police report, which also noted that $1,345 in cash was found in the apartment.\", \"When Ms. Fields arrived at her daughter\\u2019s apartment on Dec. 13, the landlord put the family in touch with Detective Cronin.\", \"\\u201cMy son talked to him and he was asking him what happened,\\u201d said Ms. Fields. \\u201cCronin said that she met a white guy on Bumble, \\u2018but don\\u2019t worry about that, he\\u2019s a really nice guy.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The family waited for Detective Cronin to arrive, but after repeated calls, they went inside the apartment to pack up Ms. Smith-Fields\\u2019s belongings. They found a used condom, a pill and bloody bedsheets.\", \"\\u201cI looked and I just broke down,\\u201d Ms. Fields said. The family asked the Police Department to collect the evidence and begin an investigation, starting with the man Ms. Smith-Fields was on a date with.\", \"Bumble works alongside the authorities in investigations, but it does not initiate them. A spokesman for the company said law enforcement had not requested user data in the case as of Thursday afternoon.\", \"\\u201cAs the circumstances around Lauren\\u2019s untimely death are still under investigation, our team has offered our full support to Lauren\\u2019s family as well as the Bridgeport police,\\u201d the company\\u2019s chief executive, Whitney Wolfe Herd, wrote in an Instagram post.\", \"Maria Pereira, a City Council member who represents Ms. Smith-Fields\\u2019s district, wondered how the Police Department would treat a wealthy white mother and father who had lost their 23-year-old daughter, particularly if the last person she had been with was a 37-year-old Black man she had met on a dating app.\", \"\\u201cI believe wholeheartedly this would have never happened if it was an affluent white family\\u2019s daughter,\\u201d said Ms. Pereira.\", \"The hashtag #laurensmithfields has been viewed more than 27 million times on TikTok. In videos about the case, amateur sleuths have tried using the police report to piece together what happened, and have encouraged viewers to call both the Bridgeport mayor\\u2019s office and the Police Department. They lambasted national media outlets for not covering Ms. Smith-Fields\\u2019s death sooner.\", \"Her friends have used the platform to post videos of Ms. Smith-Fields, showing her smiling, dancing and joking around. \\u201cSometimes when things get reported you forget that a person had a whole life beyond what happened to them,\\u201d a user commented on one of the videos.\", \"The rapper Cardi B tweeted about Ms. Smith-Fields too, writing, \\u201cConnecticut you have failed that young lady!!\\u201d\", \"Ms. Smith-Fields\\u2019s family hopes that the investigation will provide some clarity about what happened to her. In the meantime, they\\u2019re replaying their memories. Ms. Fields recalled the \\u201cmommy-daughter\\u201d days when they would get their nails done, with Ms. Smith-Fields opting for acrylic nails with intricate designs.\", \"\\u201cThe nail salon we go to, everybody loves her,\\u201d Ms. Fields said, adding that her daughter was \\u201cvery bubbly\\u201d and a \\u201chugger.\\u201d She loved traveling, working out regularly at a nearby LA Fitness, and ordering matcha tea.\", \"She had notes around her mirror, her mother said, spelling out what she wanted to do with her life: finish college, become a physical therapist.\"]","href_hash":"b7ad9c52805111ecb3da7f5d7f208d21"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b7ad9c52805111ecb3da7f5d7f208d21"}},
