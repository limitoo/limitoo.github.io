Lawson, who is an appointee of former Gov. Jerry Brown and has served on the board for six years, was the target of a group called America\\u2019s Frontline Doctors, a spokesman for Ms. Lawson said on Friday.\", \"The group, which did not immediately respond to a message from a reporter, has shared debunked and misleading claims about the virus, including that hydroxychloroquine was an effective coronavirus treatment and that masks did not slow the spread of Covid-19.\", \"The group\\u2019s videos have been promoted on Twitter by former President Donald J. Trump and have spread through Facebook groups dedicated to anti-vaccination movements and conspiracy theories such as QAnon, racking up tens of millions of views.\", \"Ms. Lawson\\u2019s account comes as public officials across the country, including school board members, have faced vitriolic backlash from parents and others who are opposed to pandemic mandates.\", \"Ms. Lawson said on Twitter that she was concerned on Monday morning when she saw someone flying a drone over her house and saw a white vehicle parked outside. That evening, when she left the law firm where she works, her concern turned to terror, she said.\", \"Four men hopped out of the white S.U.V. with cameras and recording equipment and confronted her as she tried to get into her car, she said. Her spokesman said they announced themselves to her as being with America\\u2019s Frontline Doctors, and they had the group\\u2019s logos on their jackets and microphones.\", \"In her Twitter thread, Ms. Lawson said that members of the group, when contacted by law enforcement, had indicated they just wanted to interview her for a video they were producing. Ms. Lawson said that the group never contacted her for an interview.\", \"\\u201cInstead, they ambushed me in a dark parking garage when they suspected I would be alone,\\u201d she wrote.\", \"In a statement, Ms. Lawson, a former mayor of Walnut Creek, which is in the Bay Area about 15 miles east of Oakland, described herself as the daughter of a physician who believes in robust public dialogue but that the group\\u2019s behavior is \\u201cbeyond the pale.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAs a mother, I felt deeply violated and scared for my kids in our own home \\u2014 and I feared for my own personal safety as a woman being surrounded by strange men in a dark parking garage,\\u201d she said.\", \"The police said they were looking into a man who had called the department earlier in the day, claiming to be a \\u201cstate detective\\u201d from Georgia who was \\u201cconducting surveillance\\u201d in the area.\", \"Lt. Holley Connors, a spokeswoman for the Walnut Creek Police Department, said investigators believe the man was \\u201clikely involved\\u201d in the incident involving Ms. Lawson.\", \"\\u201cAt this time, there is no evidence of a crime,\\u201d she said, \\u201cbut the Walnut Creek Police Department will continue to follow up on the incident.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"905b56885af611ec8d8e8d1c451b3e4a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"905b56885af611ec8d8e8d1c451b3e4a"}},
