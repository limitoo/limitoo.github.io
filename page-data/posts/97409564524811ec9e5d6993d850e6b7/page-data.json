The circumstances of its recovery, however, remain a mystery, said Lindsey Driebergen, the interim communications manager for the Boise Public Library system.\", \"\\u201cWe don\\u2019t have any info about where it was from,\\u201d she said.\", \"All that\\u2019s known, she said, is that the book was returned either in late October or early November to a library in nearby Garden City. The librarians there sent the book to the main library in Boise because it still had inserts from an old library in the city that has since closed.\", \"It was not clear who had checked out the copy, who had returned it or where it was all this time. One theory is that the book, a sequel to a tale about a village girl in Maine, could have spent the last century in an attic, \\u201cbecause it was really well taken care of,\\u201d Ms. Driebergen said.\", \"Whoever had the book kept it in \\u201cimmaculate\\u201d condition, she said.\", \"\\u201cThe cover was in great shape, all of the pages were crisp, nothing was missing, all the images were there,\\u201d she said.\", \"There have been other cases of books being returned decades overdue, but 110 years is an unusually long time. This year, a Wisconsin woman mailed a book that was 63 years overdue to the Queens Public Library in New York. In 2016, a 72-year-old Manhattan woman returned a book that was 57 years overdue.\", \"Ms. Driebergen said copies of \\u201cNew Chronicles of Rebecca\\u201d sold for about $1.50 when it was published in 1907.\", \"The person who checked out \\u201cNew Chronicles of Rebecca\\u201d in 1911 can rest peacefully, as the Boise Public Library scrapped late fees for overdue books in 2019. Otherwise, the person would have owed around $800, because the library charged a fine of two cents per day, the library said on Facebook.\", \"However, even in the early 20th century, the library never charged fines more than the cost of the book, said Anne Marie Martin, a library assistant at the main library.\", \"\\u201cBooks may be kept two weeks without renewal, unless otherwise labeled,\\u201d one of the book inserts said. The book\\u2019s checkout record showed it was due in November 1911, not 2021. It was listed as missing in 1912, Ms. Martin said.\", \"Several library systems across the country have done away with overdue fines in recent years to encourage people to keep coming back.\", \"\\u201cNew Chronicles of Rebecca\\u201d was a sequel to the more popular 1903 novel \\u201cRebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\\u201d by Wiggin, an author, teacher and composer. The stories follow the life of Rebecca Rowena Randall, a cheerful Maine girl who was sent to live with her two aunts. \\u201cRebecca of Sunnybrook Farm\\u201d was made into a 1938 movie of the same name starring Shirley Temple.\", \"It doesn\\u2019t appear that the copy of \\u201cNew Chronicles of Rebecca\\u201d that was returned to the Boise library is rare. Eric E. Wiggin, a distant cousin of the author\\u2019s husband who wrote a third installment of the series, said in an interview that there were many early edition copies of the book in circulation. In fact, he has many himself.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m trying to get rid of them,\\u201d said Mr. Wiggin, 82.\", \"However, the library\\u2019s copy may be the only one with a book binding that says the author\\u2019s last name is \\u201cWiggins.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cProbably that was a mistake from the Pioneer Library Bindery,\\u201d Ms. Martin said.\", \"Library books are typically rebound with a stiffer binding, and this one was likely rebound sometime before it was first checked out, she said.\", \"Now that the Boise Public Library\\u2019s copy of \\u201cNew Chronicles of Rebecca\\u201d has finally been returned, it will be displayed in a special room at the main library, Ms. Driebergen said.\", \"The librarians do not know the name of the person who checked out the book in 1911 because they no longer save the paper files that were used a century ago, she said.\", \"But the library is hoping that someone with knowledge of the book\\u2019s former whereabouts might let the staff know. \\u201cWe\\u2019re hoping someone comes forward and says, \\u2018Hey, it was my grandma\\u2019s book,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Driebergen said.\", \"\\u201cIf we had a little bit of understanding as to the history of it, we\\u2019d love to hear it,\\u201d she added, promising, \\u201cThere\\u2019s obviously no fines or anything that would be implemented.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"97409564524811ec9e5d6993d850e6b7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"97409564524811ec9e5d6993d850e6b7"}},
