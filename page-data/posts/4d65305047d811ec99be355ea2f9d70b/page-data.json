People will have to show proof that they are fully vaccinated to attend.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-17T18:58:57.000Z","content":"[\"As the clock runs out on 2021, New York City will ring in the new year with festivities meant to signal its post-pandemic rebirth: Once again, an untold number of hardy souls will descend on Times Square, braving the cold, the crowds and the police cordons to watch the ball drop at midnight on New Year\\u2019s Eve.\", \"After a scaled-down celebration last year, the famously frigid event will return at \\u201cfull strength,\\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Tuesday. It will be Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s final act running New York City, after eight years in office, and serve as a prelude to his possible bid for governor next year.\", \"\\u201cWe want to welcome all those hundreds of thousands of folks, but everyone needs to be vaccinated,\\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \\u201cJoin the crowd, join the joy, join a historic moment as New York City provides further evidence to the world that we are 100 percent back.\\u201d\", \"The New Year\\u2019s celebration will come four months after lightning cut short a star-studded \\u201chomecoming concert\\u201d that was also designed to signify the city\\u2019s comeback. Proof of vaccination was also required to attend that event, which drew thousands to Central Park.\", \"The New Year\\u2019s celebration will present a logistical, and perhaps philosophical, puzzle for the city\\u2019s police officers, who fought the mayor\\u2019s vaccination mandate for public servants. The police will have to not only contend with crowd control, but also confirm that people are vaccinated.\", \"\\u201cWe defer to the Police Department on operational issues like this, unless it impacts the guy and gal on the street,\\u201d said John Nuthall, a spokesman for the Police Benevolent Association, the union that represents the city\\u2019s police officers.\", \"In Times Square, news that the ball drop would be open to the public again was met with enthusiasm, at least among tourists. For Johnnica Watson, 47, who was visiting from Alabama, watching the event on television wouldn\\u2019t be enough: When she heard the news on Tuesday morning, she immediately decided to book another trip to the city.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m very excited for the New York people who live here, but even more for us who don\\u2019t live here,\\u201d Ms. Watson said. \\u201cOut in Alabama, we don\\u2019t have a drop.\\u201d\", \"Anyone who is unable to be inoculated because of a disability will have to show proof of a negative coronavirus test within 72 hours of the event. Children younger than 5, who are not yet eligible for vaccines, will have to be accompanied by a vaccinated adult. Masks will be required for anyone who is not vaccinated, said Tom Harris, the president of the Times Square Alliance.\", \"Asked at a news conference why vaccination would be mandatory to attend the ball drop when it is not required for many other outdoor activities in New York, Mr. de Blasio said a crowded, hourslong event drawing people from around the country and the world required greater precaution.\", \"\\u201cWhen you\\u2019re outdoors with a few hundred thousand people packed close together for hours on end, it\\u2019s a different reality,\\u201d Mr. de Blasio said. \\u201cYou\\u2019re talking about a lot of people really close for long periods of time. It makes sense to protect everyone.\\u201d\", \"The announcement comes as Mr. de Blasio is preparing for his successor, Eric Adams, to take over as the next mayor of New York City, and the ball drop will coincide with Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s final day in office. That will leave any fallout from the event in the hands of Mr. Adams, who will be inaugurated on Jan. 1. A spokesman for Mr. Adams did not respond to a request for comment.\", \"Several public health experts have cautioned that the constantly changing nature of the coronavirus makes it difficult to predict where the city might be in terms of cases by the end of the year. Of course, many who flock to watch the ball drop aren\\u2019t actually from New York at all.\", \"As of Tuesday, 74.6 percent of New Yorkers had received at least one dose of a vaccine and 68.2 percent were fully vaccinated. The number of coronavirus cases in the city has increased recently and remains very high, but hospitalization rates have stayed low.\", \"Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said Mr. de Blasio\\u2019s plans for New Year\\u2019s Eve seemed \\u201cvery reasonable.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cVaccines make outdoor events, which are already pretty low risk, exceedingly low risk,\\u201d Dr. Jha said.\", \"He pointed to the Lollapalooza music festival over the summer in Chicago as evidence.\", \"\\u201cIt was an incredibly crowded gathering, and everyone in that context was required to be vaccinated or have one negative test,\\u201d Dr. Jha said. \\u201cWe have evidence that there was little to no spread.\\u201d\", \"But Dr. Jha did caution Mr. de Blasio to give himself an escape clause should cases increase sharply in the days before New Year\\u2019s Eve, requiring the return of the celebration to be pushed to next year.\", \"Some experts pointed out that the risk might not be contained within Times Square. People will also have to consider what happens before and after the ball drop, with people going in and out of nearby bars and restaurants to eat, warm up and use the restroom. But New York City, unlike many locales, requires those eating and drinking indoors to provide proof of vaccination.\", \"Some major restrictions against international travelers were recently eased by the United States, so the ball drop is likely to attract revelers from around the world, drawing together people from areas of both lower and higher rates of the virus.\", \"Denis Nash, a professor of epidemiology for the City University of New York Graduate School of Public Health & Health Policy, said that although the vaccination requirement meant the risk of transmission at the event would be greatly reduced, those who travel from outside the city to attend the ball drop should consider the possibility of bringing the virus back to their hometowns.\", \"\\u201cThere will be people coming from places that don\\u2019t have much Covid going on right now,\\u201d Mr. Nash said. \\u201cWe need to be thinking about seeding, outbreaks and spread, not just in our own backyards but everywhere.\\u201d\", \"Given the safety guidelines, attending the ball drop would not be an irrational choice, Mr. Nash said. But people will have to weigh their individual comfort levels and the amount of risk they may pose to others, he said, advising revelers to wear a mask the entire time.\", \"The news prompted a range of reactions from New Yorkers in Times Square on Tuesday. Dustin Etheridge, 38, a journalist from Brooklyn, said that although he wouldn\\u2019t be coming out to watch the ball drop, the announcement signified a welcome return to normalcy.\", \"\\u201cI think it\\u2019s good for the city,\\u201d said Mr. Etheridge, who was snacking on Pringles at a red table with his 5-year-old son, Noah. \\u201cI think it\\u2019s really good for the local economy to have that influx of people that are coming in.\\u201d \", \"But Javier Marte, 26, of the Bronx said he wasn\\u2019t disappointed that the event didn\\u2019t happen last year, and that he wasn\\u2019t planning to attend this year, adding that many New Yorkers didn\\u2019t care about it.\", \"\\u201cIt is what it is,\\u201d said Mr. Marte, who was passing through Times Square after finishing a shift at a coronavirus testing site. \\u201cIt\\u2019s cool, though. I respect everybody that comes out and celebrates it.\\u201d\", \"New Year\\u2019s Eve typically brings a boost in business to Times Square, said Mr. Harris of the Times Square Alliance, adding that he hoped the holidays would bring a much-needed jolt to a district that has seen many restaurants and hotels shuttered during the pandemic. Foot traffic, hotel bookings and restaurant reservations have been increasing as international travel restrictions have eased, he said.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s one of the busiest times in the Times Square area,\\u201d Mr. Harris said. \\u201cPeople are tired of dreaming and eager to do, and they are eager to do it in Times Square.\\u201d\", \"Tim Dolan, who owns Broadway Up Close, which offers tours of the theater district, said his office building faced the infamous crystal ball. He said he hoped it would never again be necessary to scale back the New Year\\u2019s Eve celebration.\", \"\\u201cTo be in a building that stares up to the building where the ball drops all day, it makes us very happy to see that it\\u2019ll come back,\\u201d Mr. Dolan said. \\u201cIt will still be freezing, I\\u2019m sure, but we love traditions and can\\u2019t wait for this one to return.\\u201d\", \"Other major cities around the world have called off their New Year\\u2019s Eve celebrations. In October, London\\u2019s mayor said that the city\\u2019s end-of-year fireworks display would be canceled and replaced with a different kind of celebration, while Amsterdam this week canceled its celebrations in response to a surge in coronavirus cases.\", \"Munich has also canceled its celebrated Christmas market. \\u201cThe dramatic situation in our hospitals and the exponentially increasing infection figures leave me no other choice,\\u201d the city\\u2019s mayor, Dieter Reiter, told reporters on Tuesday.\", \"But Dr. Jha said that he believed it made sense for New York City to move forward.\", \"\\u201cWe have to get back to doing things that are really meaningful,\\u201d Dr. Jha said. \\u201cNew Year\\u2019s Eve in Times Square is kind of an iconic American celebration, and I think we\\u2019re at the point in the pandemic where we can do it safely.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4d65305047d811ec99be355ea2f9d70b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4d65305047d811ec99be355ea2f9d70b"}},
