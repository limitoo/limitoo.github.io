Rather, it was intended to fill in lingering gaps in the public record regarding the killing of Mr. Garner, a 43-year-old from Staten Island, and the multiple investigations that followed.\", \"Even with the hearing now over, Mr. Garner\\u2019s case is unlikely to fade from public view. His killing became emblematic of the tensions between Mayor Bill de Blasio and some members of the public over police issues. And his final pleas of \\u201cI can\\u2019t breathe\\u201d are still chanted by protesters of police violence nationwide.\", \"Here are five takeaways from the inquiry:\", \"Over eight days of testimony from a dozen witnesses from the Police Department, the hearing addressed several longstanding questions in the case. But advocates and relatives of Mr. Garner said it failed to provide true transparency.\", \"Lawyers for the family argued that the testimony of certain witnesses \\u2014 including Police Commissioner Dermot F. Shea and two of his predecessors, members of the department office that imposes discipline, and Mr. de Blasio \\u2014\\u00a0was essential to obtain a complete portrait of what happened.\", \"But Judge Erika M. Edwards, a Manhattan Supreme Court justice, repeatedly denied those requests, saying that others had more direct knowledge. (Lawyers could still file motions for additional witnesses if new information arises.)\", \"Gwen Carr, Mr. Garner\\u2019s mother, expressed particular frustration with the inquiry, saying she did not find much of the testimony to be credible. She maintains that the officers involved in her son\\u2019s death and what she calls a cover-up of its details should be fired.\", \"\\u201cWe didn\\u2019t have what we thought we would get out of this. We need more,\\u201d Ms. Carr said on Friday. \\u201cI had to sit through and listen to the bunch of lies that continues to go on.\\u201d\", \"Officials rejected her assertions that the inquiry was a failure. Sgt. Jessica McRorie, a spokeswoman for the Police Department, said in a statement that the case had been \\u201cthoroughly investigated on multiple levels.\\u201d\", \"Nicholas Paolucci, a spokesman for the New York City Law Department, added that \\u201cso much information\\u201d about Mr. Garner\\u2019s death has become public and that officials hope the hearing offered a measure of closure for relatives.\", \"Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who used a prohibited chokehold on Mr. Garner, was fired from the police force in 2019. Only one other person faced penalties in the incident: Sgt. Kizzy Adonis lost 20 vacation days after the department charged her with failing to properly supervise officers involved in the arrest.\", \"Some family members and activists have questioned the decision to discipline only Sgt. Adonis. She testified that she was only at the scene \\u201ctemporarily\\u201d and had been traveling to a meeting when she received a radio call directing her there.\", \"Dhanan Saminath, another police sergeant, was in charge of the scene \\u2014 though he arrived later \\u2014 and was \\u201cresponsible for whatever took place,\\u201d Sgt. Adonis said, adding that she had not seen officers use unnecessary force.\", \"Deputy Inspector Charles Barton, the supervisor who oversaw the Police Department\\u2019s internal review of the case, said that Sgt. Adonis faced penalties because \\u201cshe did absolutely nothing\\u201d and took \\u201cno proactive steps\\u201d to help.\", \"\\u201cShe acted as an observer,\\u201d Inspector Barton said. \\u201cShe did not take control of the situation.\\u201d\", \"But Judge Edwards appeared skeptical about the disciplinary decisions.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m trying to figure out, and I think I\\u2019m not the only one: How is it that Sgt. Adonis is the only one who got reprimanded out of everybody there \\u2014 and it wasn\\u2019t even her assignment at the moment?\\u201d Judge Edwards asked during her testimony.\", \"When a lawyer asked Sgt. Adonis for her reaction to the penalties she faced, she said, \\u201cTo be honest, I don\\u2019t know why I was charged at all. I\\u2019m still questioning it.\\u201d\", \"Judge Edwards responded, \\u201cMe too.\\u201d\", \"The Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent oversight agency that investigates police misconduct, had recommended charges against several officers at the scene, including Sgt. Saminath, citing a failure to supervise.\", \"He was responsible for reporting the misuse of force by officers, lawyers noted. But in his initial interview with investigators, the sergeant did not mention the prohibited chokehold used by Mr. Pantaleo. And when calling for an ambulance, he said that Mr. Garner was \\u201cjust having some trouble breathing.\\u201d An operator categorized the call as a low priority.\", \"Sgt. Saminath said that he did not \\u201cmean anything by \\u2018just\\u2019\\u201d and that at the time, he did not believe excessive force was used. Internal Affairs investigators rejected the review board\\u2019s recommendation, concluding that Sgt. Saminath had acted appropriately. \", \"The review board had also suggested charges against Mr. Pantaleo\\u2019s partner, Justin D\\u2019Amico, for failing to intervene after the chokehold was used.\", \"Officer D\\u2019Amico testified that, at the time, he did not hear Mr. Garner say \\u201cI can\\u2019t breathe\\u201d and that he did not believe the restraint used was a chokehold. Investigators rejected the review board\\u2019s recommendation, and did not address the board\\u2019s notes that Officer D\\u2019Amico pushed Mr. Garner\\u2019s head into the ground at one point during the arrest.\", \"Investigators said they also found that officers provided adequate medical care to Mr. Garner before emergency medical workers arrived. Officer William Meems, who had training as an E.M.T., testified that he did not check Mr. Garner\\u2019s airway or heart rate. But he said he turned Mr. Garner on his side to help him breathe after he was handcuffed and found a pulse.\", \"Lt. Luke Gasquez, a former lead investigator in the unit of Internal Affairs that probes use-of-force complaints, said it was clear that Officer Meems \\u201cimmediately\\u201d started providing aid once the arrest was in control and that, overall, he saw no issues with the care offered. \", \"Officer D\\u2019Amico faced additional scrutiny from lawyers. He is the only person to say that he saw Mr. Garner make two cigarette sales before moving to make an arrest.\", \"He said he thought he was about 350 feet from Mr. Garner when he saw a \\u201chandoff of a cigarette for what appeared to be money.\\u201d He said he saw another exchange as the officers drove closer.\", \"But several eyewitnesses at the scene said they did not see Mr. Garner make a cigarette sale, according to investigators. \\u201cIn circumstances like this where it\\u2019s the word of a single officer, against eight New York City residents, does the officer just win?\\u201d Gabriel Jaime-Bettan, a lawyer for the petitioners, asked Lt. Gasquez.\", \"Judge Edwards said the question was inappropriate for the nature of the inquiry. And Lt. Gasquez said that his group still viewed Officer D\\u2019Amico\\u2019s statements as credible and had found that it was possible for him to see a cigarette sale from his location at the time.\", \"After Mr. Garner\\u2019s death, news outlets including The New York Times reported details from the police about his full arrest record. Several reports noted that he had been arrested more than 30 times.\", \"One document from Internal Affairs said that Mr. Garner had been arrested 33 times since 1988; 10 of those arrests had been sealed, another document showed.\", \"Lawyers said those documents demonstrated that the police had violated state law by releasing information about criminal cases that had been dismissed and sealed.\", \"The leaks represented a major focus of the inquiry. But the matter went largely unresolved, as witnesses including Stephen Davis, the department\\u2019s top spokesman at the time of Mr. Garner\\u2019s death, said they did not know who had provided the information on the sealed arrests.\", \"Investigators in Internal Affairs said that they did not probe the matter and did not know of accusations related to leaks at the time. \\u201cI was not aware of any of this,\\u201d Lt. Gasquez said.\"]","href_hash":"435bd6fe3ed211ec912b4b0ba2ff81c5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"435bd6fe3ed211ec912b4b0ba2ff81c5"}},
