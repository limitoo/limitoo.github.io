We become that target,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s not my role \\u2014 I\\u2019m not a policymaker, I\\u2019m a business owner who loves working in my own neighborhood.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s particularly difficult for historically marginalized neighborhoods like Crenshaw, where fewer people are vaccinated than in Los Angeles County overall.\", \"Ms. Prince said she thought much of the problem could be solved if the city did a better job of communicating the restrictions so that restaurant workers aren\\u2019t required to explain them to hungry, unsuspecting customers. She likened it to going to the airport: Travelers don\\u2019t expect to get on a jet without a boarding pass.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019ve just got to get it in their face in as many ways as possible,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIf you\\u2019ve got to write it in the sky, then send the plane up.\\u201d\", \"Some residents viewed the restrictions not as a mere logistical burden but as an unfair encroachment. At a protest outside City Hall on Monday, The Los Angeles Times reported that thousands of demonstrators voiced anger with vaccine mandates more broadly, especially those for public employees.\", \"Still, across much of Los Angeles, the mandate took effect with little incident. Many bars, restaurants and fitness studios were already asking patrons to submit proof of vaccination if they planned to spend time indoors. In many cases, they said they hoped to lure back customers who might otherwise feel uncomfortable.\", \"Allie Tichenor, the owner of Pilates Punx in the Echo Park neighborhood, said that even before the mandate went into effect, clients had asked whether instructors were vaccinated. Some volunteered their own vaccination status, and no one questioned the studio\\u2019s mask policy.\", \"So, although she didn\\u2019t hear from the city about the new law until just before it went into effect, she quickly emailed clients asking them to send proof of vaccination.\", \"\\u201cIt helps the clients feel really safe,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI\\u2019m happy to err on the side of caution, and I\\u2019ve figured if somebody wants to push back, maybe this isn\\u2019t the studio for them.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"0ace4e7341cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0ace4e7341cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
