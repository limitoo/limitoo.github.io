But roast turkey joins the chicken dinner for the holidays, and this Thursday is expected to be the busiest day of the year for the two \\u201cFrankenmuth dinner\\u201d restaurants that face each other across South Main Street: Bavarian Inn and Zehnder\\u2019s of Frankenmuth. Nearly 30,000 diners are expected during the four-day holiday weekend.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s the food,\\u201d said Dorothy Zehnder, a founder of the Bavarian Inn, who will turn 100 on Dec. 1. \\u201cThey know they get good food, and Thanksgiving and Christmas are really family affairs, family days.\\u201d\", \"They also get nostalgia by the acre, served up with the gusto of Lawrence Welk at Champagne-bubble time. Like those who travel to Solvang, Calif., or Leavenworth, Wash., visitors to Frankenmuth experience a simulacrum of another place \\u2014 or in this case, many places, from old Bavaria to colonial America to the North Pole \\u2014 filled with polka music, wine tastings, water slides and reminders that the rock band Greta Van Fleet started here.\", \"Frankenmuth\\u2019s German heritage is woven through the city, in the Bavarian Inn\\u2019s 50-foot Glockenspiel tower, in the hotel rooms named for founding families and in the Fraktur lettering everywhere. The front of the post office sports larger-than-life cutouts of Hummel figurines mailing porcelain letters straight, one imagines, to a visitor\\u2019s heart.\", \"The tug at the heartstrings is strongest at Thanksgiving and Christmas. A family-style dinner, followed by a visit to Bronner\\u2019s Christmas Wonderland, which bills itself as the world\\u2019s largest Christmas store, is a ready-made memory lying in wait.\", \"This year, hopes are high. Michigan\\u2019s restaurants reopened to full capacity just this summer, and this month the border opened to Canadian visitors, who before the pandemic made up a sizable portion of the out-of-town guests. The spacious dining rooms, which can seat 1,200 or more, were dark last Thanksgiving. Takeout was the only option, with only a small fraction of the staff running the show; the number of employees at the Bavarian Inn is still below prepandemic levels, while Zehnder\\u2019s has just about returned to normal.\", \"\\u201cTakeout, for us, is like telling a car dealer, \\u2018You can\\u2019t sell cars but you can do oil changes,\\u2019\\u201d said Al Zehnder, the chief executive of Zehnder\\u2019s of Frankenmuth.\", \"Mention Frankenmuth to a Michigander and she\\u2019ll be quick to note whether she comes from a family of Zehnder\\u2019s loyalists or Bavarian Inn fans. The two restaurants have clear stylistic differences, starting with the facades. Zehnder\\u2019s looks like Mount Vernon, if George Washington advertised with neon. The Bavarian Inn has a \\u201chills are alive\\u201d feel.\", \"Servers at the Bavarian Inn wear dirndls or lederhosen. Those at Zehnder\\u2019s dress in the restaurant\\u2019s colonial theme, with women in mobcaps and white aprons, and men in banded-collared shirts with knickers.\", \"The meal at Zehnder\\u2019s starts with garlic toasts and orbs of spreadable cheese and p\\u00e2t\\u00e9, while at the Bavarian Inn, the opening attraction might be an accordion serenade by Linda Lee, an honoree of the Polka Hall of Fame. \\u201cThey have more American food, and we have more German food,\\u201d said Mrs. Zehnder, of the Bavarian Inn.\", \"But the all-you-can-eat menus are largely the same. Both restaurants offer chicken noodle soup and stollen slices the size of sandwich bread, conservatively studded with candied fruits. And both end their bottomless meals with soft-serve ice cream. At Zehnder\\u2019s, the dessert is topped with a translucent plastic animal the restaurant calls a Zoo Pick. At the Bavarian Inn, it\\u2019s a pick of a boy or girl dressed in Alpine clothing.\", \"Mr. Zehnder once thought of saving a few bucks by getting rid of the Zoo Picks. Customers howled. \\u201cWe had to get them back,\\u201d he said, adding, \\u201cThe expectation of the guests is really singular.\\u201d\", \"And there\\u2019s more. Beneath each restaurant is an underground warren of shops selling toys, collectibles, cookware and Frankenmuth favorites like fresh butterhorns, sweet rolls that will survive a long car ride home. The idea is to keep guests entertained while they wait for a table.\", \"\\u201cWe live in an \\u2018Ozzie and Harriet\\u2019 kind of a town,\\u201d said Wayne Bronner, the chief executive of Bronner\\u2019s Christmas Wonderland. \\u201cI explain that to people, and the younger people, they say, \\u2018Who are Ozzie and Harriet?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"How this predominantly German American city in the Saginaw Valley, near the base of the Michigan \\u201cthumb,\\u201d became a destination for satiation is a saga worthy of a James Michener novel, complete with religious fervor, tinsel, beer and a family dynasty that is synonymous with the chicken dinner.\", \"With the city\\u2019s focus on German heritage, though, it\\u2019s easy to miss the other group at the beginning of the story.\", \"This stretch of farmland was once oak, hickory and white-pine forest, the hunting grounds of the Chippewa. The Treaty of Saginaw, an 1819 agreement with the United States government, stripped the Saginaw, Swan Creek and Black River Bands of six million acres in Michigan, though subsequent treaties put some land in a trust, the sales of which were supposed to benefit Native Americans.\", \"Frankenmuth was founded by 15 Lutherans, led by August Craemer, who immigrated with the stated purpose of converting Native Americans to Christianity. In 1845, the group bought 680 acres of former Native American land from the government for $1,700, or about $62,000 today.\", \"The first Zehnders, including Johann Stephan Zehnder, arrived in Frankenmuth the following year with a second group of German Lutherans. Those first few years, Craemer ran a missionary school in Frankenmuth, and taught religious doctrine in German to a few dozen Chippewa children.\", \"Today, fewer than 20 of Frankenmuth\\u2019s roughly 5,000 residents identify as Native American, according the 2020 census. A marker in the city\\u2019s Memorial Park notes Frankenmuth\\u2019s connection to the Chippewa; the Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan has a reservation 70 miles to the west, in Mount Pleasant.\", \"\\u201cThe Saginaw Chippewa Indian Tribe celebrates all others who take the time to remember where they came from and maintain those connections to old traditions and celebrations,\\u201d Frank Cloutier, the public relations director for the tribe, wrote in an email. \\u201cAs we near the Thanksgiving holiday we are mindful of the fall harvest celebration of the late 1600s when the pilgrims from Europe were invited to break bread with the aboriginal natives. As they shared their culture then, we still do today.\\u201d\", \"Frankenmuth\\u2019s culture of hospitality, or Gem\\u00fctlichkeit, dates to the late 19th century, when a brewery and hotels nourished travelers journeying between Saginaw and Flint. In 1928, William Zehnder Sr., Johann\\u2019s grandson, bought a hotel on Main Street opposite Fischer\\u2019s Hotel, where most travelers at the time stopped for a chicken dinner.\", \"An admirer of George Washington, William Zehnder remodeled his hotel to look like Mount Vernon, and it opened as the family\\u2019s first restaurant on Mother\\u2019s Day in 1929. \\u201cWhat a terrible time to start a business,\\u201d Al Zehnder said, \\u201cduring Prohibition and just on the doorstep of the Depression.\\u201d\", \"Visitors continued to stop in Frankenmuth, though, because the beer continued to flow. \\u201c\\u2018A kettle of tea\\u2019 was the code word,\\u201d said Heidi Chapman, director of the Frankenmuth Historical Association. The government levied heavy fines against the Zehnders and the Fischers, and federal agents destroyed both bars.\", \"After World War II, Wally Bronner, a sign painter who had won renown for his work decorating businesses around the region in Christmas splendor, added the tinselly twinkle to Frankenmuth\\u2019s tourist industry by opening his first Christmas store.\", \"\\u201cRed shiny ornaments are our No. 1 seller,\\u201d said Wayne Bronner, his son. Bronner\\u2019s Christmas Wonderland employees 75 people, a tenth of its usual staff, just to paint customers\\u2019 names on ornaments. The 320,000-square-foot store \\u2014 about 100,000 of it shopping space \\u2014 is the size of five football fields and sells everything from velvet Santa suits to job-specific baubles (\\u201cLawyers never lose their appeal!\\u201d \\u201cPlumbers go with the flow.\\u201d).\", \"The Zehnder family bought the restaurant Fischer\\u2019s Hotel in 1950. Mrs. Zehnder and her husband, William Zehnder Jr. (a.k.a. Tiny \\u2014 he was a small baby), built an addition, in 1959, designed by an architect who agreed to work on the project only if he could do it in a German style.\", \"\\u201cThe day we opened up, business boomed,\\u201d Mrs. Zehnder said. \\u201cIt really flourished, and then, of course, we went German. We had to.\\u201d\", \"Tiny Zehnder persuaded town elders to weave the Old World motif throughout the city. There\\u2019s faux fachwerk (half-timbering) and the blue-and-white diamond pattern of Octoberfest all along Main Street.\", \"The Zehnder family ran both restaurants until the 1980s, when the second generation split the enterprise into two entities to pursue differing business interests. Dorothy Zehnder\\u2019s family runs the Bavarian Inn and a shopping center; Al Zehnder, his sisters Martha and Susan and their families operate Zehnder\\u2019s restaurant and a golf course. Each has a bakery and a hotel with a water park.\", \"In 2020, the James Beard Foundation honored Zehnder\\u2019s as one of its America\\u2019s Classics, beloved regional restaurants that are often run by families.\", \"\\u201cOur whole focus has really been to create a four-season family vacation destination,\\u201d Mr. Zehnder said. \\u201cThe focus on family really hasn\\u2019t changed since the founding.\\u201d\", \"One family, the Murins of Irwin, Pa., has been planning its Thanksgiving trip to Frankenmuth since the summer. Emily Murin and her husband, Jonathan, love the Christmas season (\\u201cIt is the one thing that bonds us together,\\u201d she said) and wanted to take their daughters, Gianna, 5, and Gabriella, 4, on a holiday trip in their new camper trailer.\", \"They chose Frankenmuth over Dollywood, in Tennessee, because the drive to Michigan would be on flatter terrain. They plan to arrive on Wednesday, eat Thanksgiving dinner on Thursday, shop at Bronner\\u2019s on Friday and maybe fit in a trip to Splash Village on Saturday before heading home, where four decorated Christmas trees await their return.\", \"Ms. Murin polled Facebook groups run by Frankenmuth fans before deciding where to eat.\", \"\\u201cI posted on the local groups to say, \\u2018OK, well, which one is it going to be: Zehnder\\u2019s or Bavarian Inn? Who is the winner?\\u2019 And it was actually a very, very dead heat,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSo it came down to reservation time.\\u201d\", \"When the Murins sit down to Thanksgiving dinner at the Bavarian Inn, they\\u2019ll find a style of dining that hasn\\u2019t changed all that much since Mrs. Zehnder began her career as a waitress in 1937.\", \"Even so, not all diners are bound by tradition. \\u201cYou\\u2019d be surprised,\\u201d Mrs. Zehnder said, \\u201cby how many steaks we serve on Thanksgiving.\\u201d\", \"Recipe: Butterhorns\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
