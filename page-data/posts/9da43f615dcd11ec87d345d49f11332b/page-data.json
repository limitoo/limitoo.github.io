It's ridiculous to have a gender reveal for a lizard.\\\"\", \"Since being posted on Tuesday, the post has amassed more than 16,000 upvotes, as the mom added an update to clarify a few points.\", \"She confirmed the lizard was a girl, called Ellie, adding: \\\"My issue is that she said the party was a gender reveal, if she had called it just a party I would have come. But calling it a gender reveal makes it sound like it's for the lizard, and I'm not going to that even if it is a 'joke.'\\\"\", \"Although she claimed, while being supportive of her daughter's decision not to have kids, she's admitted showing \\\"mild frustration.\\\"\", \"\\\"I just didn't want to go to a party with a lizard, and if it wasn't for the lizard she should've called it a party instead of a gender reveal,\\\" she added.\", \"In the comments she claimed her daughter seemingly went all out, saying: \\\"She bought a cake that says 'It's a girl' and popped a pink sparkly glitter popper too, which I think is ridiculous, the lizard can't appreciate or love this, it can't even feel emotions.\\\"\", \"And the mom revealed her true feelings for Ellie, venting: \\\"I will be honest I don't have any particular feelings for the lizard. I think it looks like a snake and that freaks me out, and it is incapable of feeling emotions so I don't know why she feels a bond with it.\", \"\\\"She even named it Ellie, a human name, so she can tell people 'I have to get home to Ellie' so she can act like she's busy with a kid at home which I believe is an unhealthy way to cope with her social anxiety, she should learn to get comfortable with saying no instead of using a lizard as an excuse to neglect social obligations.\\\"\", \"But people claimed the mom was in the wrong, with Cake_agent2101 saying: \\\"Yep. She is completely bitter that her daughter isn't going to 'give' her grandkids.\\\"\", \"Tracy27 wrote: \\\"Yeah, after it was clear that the 'gender reveal' was just a fun pretext for seeing human faces she loves, you became a true blue AH for continuing to be pedantic and petty about it just to punish her for not using her uterus as your dream factory.
