But the family was later told that Mr. Parvez had been arrested and would be transferred to New Delhi.\", \"A copy of the arrest memo showed that Mr. Parvez was being charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, an antiterrorism law with roots in the British colonial era that makes being freed on bail extremely difficult.\", \"\\u201cThey took Khurram\\u2019s mobile and laptop,\\u201d Mr. Shariyar said. \\u201cAt six in the evening they called me and told me that they had arrested him.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Parvez is a leading member of the Jammu Kashmir Coalition of Civil Society, a group that has frequently published reports on human rights abuses in the region, including disappearances, torture and mass graves. Kashmir, disputed between India and Pakistan, remains one of the world\\u2019s most heavily militarized areas, with hundreds of thousands of troops on the Indian side of the valley alone.\", \"In 2016, Mr. Parvez was prevented from boarding a flight to Geneva to attend the Human Rights Council and arrested days later. He was released after 76 days; a judge called the arrest illegal and arbitrary.\", \"The work of the Jammu Kashmir Coalition was recognized by the Norway-based Rafto Foundation for Human Rights in 2017 for documenting \\u201chuman rights violations in Kashmir under very difficult circumstances.\\u201d\", \"The foundation, in a statement, said its members had worked closely with Mr. Parvez\\u2019s organization and knew well that its work was \\u201cdirected towards raising awareness about human rights violations by peaceful and democratic means.\\u201d\", \"They described the accusations made in the arrest memo as \\u201cwholly implausible\\u201d and said that the episode was an \\u201caggressive invasion into and constriction of the space of human rights defenders and their organizations\\u201d that \\u201cunfortunately fits a pattern of behavior by the Indian government.\\u201d\", \"Jostein Hole Kobbeltvedt, the director of the Rafto Foundation, also criticized the government, saying: \\u201cWe observe with regret that the Indian government intimidates citizens working to secure the values and norms enshrined both in the constitution of India and in international treaties ratified by the government itself.\\u201d\", \"Mary Lawlor, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights defenders, said she was disturbed by the reports of the arrest.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s not a terrorist, he is a Human Rights Defender,\\u201d she wrote on Twitter. Amnesty International also weighed in.\", \"India\\u2019s Supreme Court is reviewing a petition on concerns that the antiterrorism law, known as U.A.P.A., is widely abused by the administration of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to suppress dissent.\", \"A group of former government officers have filed a petition arguing that the prosecution rates under the law remain abysmally low \\u2014 about 2 percent, according to the government\\u2019s own admission in Parliament.\", \"Still, those charged under the law sometimes end up spending years in jail, some even dying there, before their trial has begun or resulted in a conviction.\"]","href_hash":"3596d1184c6a11ec878d71c16a0bb135"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3596d1184c6a11ec878d71c16a0bb135"}},
