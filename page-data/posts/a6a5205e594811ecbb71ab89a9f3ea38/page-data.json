Wade and the entry of Dr. Mehmet Oz into the race\\u2019s Republican primary \\u2014 may give her underdog campaign new momentum.\", \"Dr. Arkoosh, a physician in obstetric anesthesiology and a top elected official in Montgomery County in the Philadelphia suburbs, is trying to pitch herself as a kind of anti-Dr. Oz.\", \"\\u201cIt really does take a doctor to stand up to a doctor,\\u201d Dr. Arkoosh told me. \\u201cI don\\u2019t even know how he still has a license, with some of the stuff that comes out his mouth,\\u201d she said of his promotion of unproved Covid-19 treatments early in the pandemic.\", \"Dr. Oz, a celebrity doctor who, until recently, hosted \\u201cThe Dr. Oz Show,\\u201d is well positioned, thanks to personal wealth and high name recognition, to become a front-runner in a G.O.P. field where no one has yet nailed down voters\\u2019 allegiance. The contest to fill Pennsylvania\\u2019s open Senate seat will be one of the hardest fought in the country in 2022, with majority control of the Senate at stake.\", \"Dr. Oz, who jumped into the race last week, is framing his candidacy as a conservative\\u2019s response to the pandemic, pushing back against mandates, shutdowns and limits to \\u201cfreedom.\\u201d \", \"Dr. Arkoosh, on the other hand, helped lead an aggressive response to the pandemic as the leader of the Montgomery County board of commissioners. In an interview, she contrasted her efforts to ensure the safety of students in her county to Dr. Oz\\u2019s position on schools at the time: During the same month that she canceled graduation ceremonies last year, Dr. Oz urged on Fox News that schools should be open because it \\u201cmay only cost us 2 to 3 percent in terms of total mortality\\u201d of the population. \", \"He later said he \\u201cmisspoke.\\u201d\", \"In response to Dr. Arkoosh\\u2019s criticism, a spokeswoman for Dr. Oz\\u2019s campaign, Erin Perrine, pointed to his success as a heart surgeon and to his TV show and books, which she said \\u201cempowered millions to make better health care choices \\u2014 even if it meant going against the medical establishment.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Arkoosh, 61, has struggled for attention from Democratic voters and donors in the shadow of the leaders of her primary: Mr. Fetterman, the lieutenant governor, and Mr. Lamb, a congressman. The two men are usually contrasted against one another as a progressive (Mr. Fetterman, who supported Bernie Sanders in 2016) versus a moderate (Mr. Lamb, who won a congressional district that voted for President Donald J. Trump). \", \"Dr. Arkoosh is liberal on issues \\u2014 she wants to ban fracking and to add a public option to the health care marketplace \\u2014 but what sets her apart may be demographics. \", \"Mr. Fetterman and Mr. Lamb are both from Allegheny County in Western Pennsylvania. They each argue that they are best suited to make inroads with white blue-collar voters. Meanwhile, Dr. Arkoosh\\u2019s base, Montgomery County \\u2014 the state\\u2019s third most populous and the second richest \\u2014 is ground zero for the suburban shift to Democrats in recent years. In all, Philadelphia and its suburbs in southeast Pennsylvania contribute 50 percent of the state\\u2019s Democratic primary voters.\", \"\\u201cIn Montgomery County in 2020, we gave President Biden 66,000 more votes than we gave Hillary Clinton,\\u201d Dr. Arkoosh said. \\u201cIt is where my base is, where my strength is.\\u201d\", \"Still, J. J. Balaban, a Democratic strategist in Pennsylvania, said that Dr. Arkoosh\\u2019s campaign had been underwhelming so far and that she was little known outside Montgomery County.\", \"\\u201cIt costs a lot of money to get known statewide in Pennsylvania, and she appears to be coming up short,\\u201d Mr. Balaban told me. \\u201cAt the moment, she doesn\\u2019t have enough funds to win the Philly market, let alone the state.\\u201d\", \"As of October, Dr. Arkoosh had $1 million in her campaign account, which includes a $500,000 personal loan, and she trails Mr. Fetterman\\u2019s $4.2 million on hand and Mr. Lamb\\u2019s $2.1 million. Her endorsement by Emily\\u2019s List, the abortion rights group, did not seem to have boosted her fund-raising much through September.\", \"Even so, the rising prominence of abortion as a potential motivator of Democratic voters in the midterm elections plays to Dr. Arkoosh\\u2019s strengths as a doctor. Her specialty means she administers anesthesia to women giving birth and women having abortions.\", \"\\u201cAs a physician who has sat at the bedside of women who have had to make some of the most difficult decisions of their lives,\\u201d she said, \\u201cthere is no place for any politician in those decisions.\\u201d\", \"Arguments before the Supreme Court last week suggested the conservative majority was ready to reverse or severely limit Roe v. Wade in a ruling next year.\", \"\\u201cI think this is going to be a very big issue,\\u201d Dr. Arkoosh said. \\u201cAnd I think this is going to be an issue that gets women, and particularly suburban women, out in numbers.\\u2019\\u2019\"]","href_hash":"a6a5205e594811ecbb71ab89a9f3ea38"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a6a5205e594811ecbb71ab89a9f3ea38"}},
