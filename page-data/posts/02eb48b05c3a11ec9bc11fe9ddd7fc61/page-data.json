According to Cope, once she heard about the storm's trajectory on TV, she called her son to try and warn him.\", \"\\\"We told him it looked like the storm was heading that way and that he needed to get to shelter,\\\" Cope.\", \"Clayton Cope promised to leave the building, as his mother said, but only after warning his coworkers about the impending danger.

Once the storm passed, Cope became worried as her son stopped answering her calls. She and other family members drove to the warehouse to see what had happened.\", \"\\\"We were lucky enough to get there before they blocked the way, before no one could get up there,\\\" Cope said. \\\"We parked and walked close, as close as we could, to the building. We could see all the damage on the building, and it was on the south end where he would've been.\\\"\", \"Company representatives confirmed that the warehouse has a designated tornado shelter area. It is unclear, however, how many employees were able to get to it on Friday night. Cope said that, due to the building's size, it might have been unlikely that her son and others were able to get to the shelter in time.\", \"\\\"There's nothing that you can experience like getting that information,\\\" Cope said. \\\"We're all in the same boat. There's no amount of sympathy that can make you feel any better. It's just going to take time.\\\"\", \"The other workers who died in the collapse were Deandre Morrow, Etheria Hebb, Kevin Dickey, Larry Virden, and Austin McEwen. McEwen reportedly died while attempting to shelter in a bathroom with other employees. Some workers told Reuters that they had been told to shelter in bathrooms, but others gave conflicting reports.\"]","href_hash":"02eb48b05c3a11ec9bc11fe9ddd7fc61"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"02eb48b05c3a11ec9bc11fe9ddd7fc61"}},
