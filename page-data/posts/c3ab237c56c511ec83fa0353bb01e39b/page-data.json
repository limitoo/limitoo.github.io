Or rather, all over its Instagram page.\", \"In one way, this is merely the latest example of the vigilante justice meted out against powerful global brands by individuals willing to point out perceived injustice, including cultural appropriation, copying designs and other forms of misbehavior, and of the shifting balance of power between brands and audience.\", \"But the emotions around this anti-advent calendar campaign have been particularly high, in part, perhaps, because of the holiday involved, and the idea that rather than representing good will toward customers, this particular gift item suggests they\\u2019re being played for suckers.\", \"Here\\u2019s what happened: On Dec. 3, Elise Harmon, a Tiktoker in California, posted a video of herself unboxing a Chanel advent calendar in the shape of the Chanel No. 5 bottle.\", \"\\u201cAm I crazy?\\u201d she asked. \\u201cAbsolutely. But I\\u2019ve never seen a Chanel advent calendar, so let\\u2019s see if it\\u2019s worth the hype.\\u201d\", \"(She had never seen a Chanel advent calendar before because there had never been one. This was a special holiday initiative to celebrate the 100th birthday of Chanel No. 5.)\", \"Ms. Harmon gave the calendar \\u201ca 10 out of 10\\u201d for packaging, but she was upset to open a box and discover what she appeared to be Chanel stickers. A hand cream, on the other hand, she liked.\", \"And so it went with the unboxing over eight more posts, in which Ms. Harmon revealed perfumes (good), key chains (not so much), lipstick and nail polish (mostly good, even if they were also mostly sample size), a mirror (not), a rope bracelet with a CC wax stamp (huh?), a plastic mini snow globe and \\u2026 a Chanel dustbag, the cotton bags used for shoes or bags. It was the dustbag that really set people off.\", \"As of Dec. 6, the series has been viewed more than 50 million times, and each post has thousands of comments, mostly along the \\u201cyou wuz robbed\\u201d or \\u201cwho do they think they are?\\u201d lines. To cap it all off, Ms. Harmon told her followers that she had been \\u201cblocked\\u201d by Chanel.\", \"Though Chanel has a TikTok page, it is inactive and set to private, with no followers, so it was unclear where Ms. Harmon had been blocked \\u2014 she did not respond to requests for comment \\u2014 but that did not stop her audience from descending on Chanel\\u2019s Instagram account, which has more than 47 million followers and which has been posting about the M\\u00e9tiers d\\u2019Art show to be held in Paris on Dec. 7.\", \"Under each photo of the work of the various specialty ateliers Chanel now sponsors \\u2014 the flower maker Lemarie, the embroidery atelier Montex, among others \\u2014 and promotional clips for the collection film, are hundreds of comments: \\u201cDon\\u2019t ignore the inevitable! We want some answers!\\u201d And, \\u201cIs the film funded by the advent calendar sales?\\u201d\", \"As of Monday, four days after Ms. Harmon\\u2019s original video, the action was still going strong \\u2014 and her follower count was growing. (A similar backlash has occurred in China, where a blogger also called out the brand\\u2019s advent calendar as not worth the money.)\", \"As for Chanel, it has not publicly addressed the issue, but Gregoire Audidier, the international communication and client experience strategy director at Chanel Fragrance and Beauty, wrote in an email: \\u201cThe recent claim of a person being blocked by Chanel on TikTok is inaccurate. We have never blocked access to the Chanel TikTok page to anyone, because it is not an active account and no content has ever been published. We are committed to sharing our creations with our followers on all social networks we are active on. Our pages are open to everyone, and our followers are free to express their feelings and opinions, whether they are enthusiastic or critical.\\u201d\", \"Chanel is not, as it happens, the only luxury brand to offer an expensive beauty advent calendar, though it is the most expensive. Indeed, it\\u2019s actually late to the game, which took off about a decade ago.\", \"Now there are a plethora of such limited-edition Christmas calendars, including ones from La Mer, Guerlain and L\\u2019Occitane. Dior ($550), Armani ($310) and Saint Laurent ($300) also have beauty advent calendars. None of them are cheap, and most contain a mix of beauty samples \\u2014 the mini versions of products often given free with a purchase \\u2014 and full-size or limited edition offerings.\", \"And the beauty versions are just the latest iteration of the way advent calendars, invented in the mid-19th century in Germany to teach children about the catechism and spirituality, have been commercialized over the years. Even the Nazis created their own as a form of propaganda.\", \"(The priciest advent calendar on the market is probably the new $150,000 Tiffany version, a four-foot-tall cabinet with a reproduction of the Jean-Michel Basquiat painting from Tiffany\\u2019s recent \\u201cEquals Pi\\u201d ad campaign on the front and 24 gifts inside.)\", \"So why has the Chanel version gotten people so het up? After all, luxury brands have never been shy about the fact that, in large part, what their customers are buying is the brand equity itself. A dustbag with \\u201cChanel\\u201d on it is worth more than a dustbag with nothing on it.\", \"Moreover, Chanel does lay out all the contents of the calendar on its website, so it\\u2019s not a secret what anybody is getting for their money. It\\u2019s not apparent that their offering is any more flimflam than that of other brands.\", \"But because it was new, and because it cost so much, and because it was Chanel, with all the mythology built into the name, the stakes and expectations may have been higher. And the sense of betrayal when those expectations were not met, greater \\u2014 and, it would seem, the desire to publicly pile on in response, irresistible.\", \"Those who profit from perception can also lose because of it. What Ms. Harmon opened up wasn\\u2019t just a new mini perfume. It was a new reality, now completely out of the box.\"]","href_hash":"c3ab237c56c511ec83fa0353bb01e39b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c3ab237c56c511ec83fa0353bb01e39b"}},
