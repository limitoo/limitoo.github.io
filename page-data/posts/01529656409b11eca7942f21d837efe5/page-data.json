But the measures have been widely assailed by Democrats (and a few conservatives) as a threat to liberal education and to the teaching of even some of the most basic facts about American history.\", \"In a new report released Monday, the free expression group PEN America emphasizes what it says is another threat they pose: to the free speech guaranteed in the First Amendment.\", \"\\u201cThese bills appear designed to chill academic and educational discussions and impose government dictates on teaching and learning,\\u201d the report says. \\u201cIn short: They are educational gag orders.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cTaken together,\\u201d it continues, \\u201cthe efforts amount to a sweeping crusade for content- and viewpoint-based state censorship.\\u201d\", \"In invoking free speech, PEN is staking its approach on a principle that has lost its luster for some on the left, even while many on the right \\u2014 including politicians advocating these bills \\u2014 have invoked it as a mantra.\", \"In an interview, Suzanne Nossel, PEN America\\u2019s executive director, said the intention wasn\\u2019t to endorse any particular curriculum or pedagogy, but to appeal to \\u201chigher principles\\u201d amid an increasingly polarized discussion.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re not asking people to fall silent in terms of deliberation over how this racial reckoning is transpiring,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBut the speed of the resort to censorship, without any apparent awareness of the contradictions, is part of the broader erosion of free speech in our society.\\u201d\", \"The impetus behind these laws dates to last September, when President Donald J. Trump issued an executive order banning federal agencies and contractors from conducting diversity trainings that draw on \\u201crace or sex scapegoating\\u201d or promote \\u201cdivisive concepts,\\u201d such as the claim that \\u201cthe United States is fundamentally racist or sexist.\\u201d\", \"That order was rescinded by the Biden administration. But the campaign against critical race theory \\u2014 an analytical framework originally developed by legal scholars that has been adopted by conservative activists as a catchall term for various teachings about race \\u2014 has only intensified as it has moved to state legislatures and local school boards.\", \"Since January, according to PEN, legislatures in 24 states have introduced 54 separate bills aimed at restricting teaching and training in K-12 school, higher education and state agencies and institutions, by banning various \\u201cprohibited\\u201d or \\u201cdivisive\\u201d concepts, mostly relating to race, racism, gender and American history.\", \"Many are framed as protecting sound teaching, free of \\u201cindoctrination.\\u201d In June, for example, Florida\\u2019s state board of education passed new rules banning \\u2018critical race theory, which stated that instruction on required topics \\u201cmust be factual and objective and may not suppress or distort significant historical events.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe need to be educating people, not trying to indoctrinate them with ideology,\\u201d Florida\\u2019s governor, Ron DeSantis, said before the vote.\", \"Governments and school boards have wide leeway in setting curriculums in K-12 public schools, where courts have generally held that teachers do not have the same degree of academic freedom as those in universities. But many of these bills, PEN argues, are written so vaguely that they may chill a broad range of speech.\", \"\\u201cThis over-breadth and ambiguity is why they are so alarming,\\u201d Jonathan Friedman, PEN\\u2019s director of free of expression and education, said. \\u201cThe truth is, most administrators and general counsels will quickly say, \\u2018let\\u2019s not run afoul of this.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Erwin Chemerinsky, a First Amendment expert and the dean of the law school at the University of California, Berkeley, who previewed the report, agreed. \\u201cWhenever the government regulates speech, it has to be clear about what\\u2019s prohibited and what\\u2019s allowed,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThese laws are so vague in their wording that a teacher can\\u2019t tell.\\u201d\", \"According to PEN, nine bills specifically target critical race theory. Eleven bills explicitly ban lessons based on the 1619 Project, an initiative by The New York Times Magazine exploring the history and continuing legacy of slavery that has been adapted into a classroom curriculum.\", \"So far, by PEN\\u2019s count, 11 bills have become law, in nine states, sometimes within days of being introduced. Another 18 are pending from the 2021 legislative session, and six more have already been drafted for consideration for 2022.\", \"Many of the bills, according to PEN, include language that purports to affirm freedom of speech and thought. Ten bills prohibit schools or teachers from \\u201ccompelling\\u201d a person to affirm belief in a \\u201cdivisive concept,\\u201d while eight mandate \\u201cbalanced\\u201d teaching of \\u201ccontroversial\\u201d topics. (In Texas, such a law recently led one school official last month to suggest that educators who teach the Holocaust should make sure to have books that offer \\u201copposing\\u201d views.)\", \"Jonathan Zimmerman, a historian of education at the University of Pennsylvania who previewed an early draft of the PEN report, called it \\u201cthe single best description and analysis of these laws.\\u201d And he pointed to the irony of conservatives who complain about \\u201ccancel culture\\u201d promoting such bills, which he called \\u201cthe most profound and troubling example of cancel culture\\u201d today.\", \"But he said liberals and progressives needed to wrestle with another irony. If you dig into the text of the laws, he said, they echo one of the arguments that have increasingly been used to justify limiting speech on college campuses \\u2014 the idea that if speech upsets people, it should be forbidden.\", \"\\u201cAn idea that took root on the campus left is now being weaponized by the right,\\u201d he said.\", \"Zimmerman also questioned the claim, common among critics of the laws, that critical race theory is an advanced concept that is not actually being taught in K-12 schools. Texts by legal scholars like Derrick Bell or Kimberl\\u00e9 Crenshaw may not be on the syllabus, he said. But some of its basic tenets \\u2014 for example, that colorblind laws can strengthen structural racism \\u2014 are broadly influential in many lessons and training materials, where they are sometimes stated as axiomatic truths.\", \"\\u201cSome of the oxygen for these laws, as despicable as they are, comes from a suspicion there are people on left who do want to impose an orthodoxy,\\u201d Zimmerman said.\", \"Last month, a group of educators and civil rights organizations filed suit against Oklahoma\\u2019s ban on critical race theory, on the grounds that it violates the First Amendment.\", \"But the battle over critical race theory may be more political than legal.\", \"In an interview, R.R. Reno, the editor of the conservative journal First Things, called the laws \\u201ca response to bureaucratic capture\\u201d of the education system by \\u201cradical voices\\u201d who do not represent the majority.\", \"\\u201cMost voters will not be swayed by these nuances,\\u201d he said of PEN\\u2019s free speech arguments, which were summarized by a reporter. Some of the bills might be \\u201cterribly defective,\\u201d Reno continued. \\u201cBut if that\\u2019s not the way to regain control of the educational establishment, tell us what the right way is?\\u201d\", \"Nossel and Friedman of PEN said that the goal wasn\\u2019t to shut down public debate over how race and other contentious subjects are taught, but to ensure that debate can happen, including in the classroom itself.\", \"\\u201cYou can\\u2019t say you support free speech and say you support these bills,\\u201d Friedman said.\", \"Nossel added: \\u201cOr even be silent about them.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"01529656409b11eca7942f21d837efe5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"01529656409b11eca7942f21d837efe5"}},
