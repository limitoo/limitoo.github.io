The house was designed by the renowned Mexican architect Miguel \\u00c1ngel Aragon\\u00e9s and completed last year, said Laura de la Torre de Skipsey, an agent with Mexico Sotheby\\u2019s International Realty, which has the listing.\", \"\\u201cThe design is very vertical,\\u201d she said, with more than 14,000 square feet of living space distributed across five floors. The spare white interiors, floor-to-ceiling glass walls, and neutral marble flooring can be lit up at night in soothing neon hues. Electronic shades throughout the house allow for sun cover and privacy.\", \"The main entrance from the driveway opens into a hallway with stairs leading to the fourth-floor living area, an open, glass-walled space with sweeping bay views and 16-foot ceilings. An adjoining patio has an infinity pool. A wall separates the sleek Italian kitchen, which has a large center island and high-end appliances, from the living area.\", \"Above the living area, on the roof, is a garden with a stone patio and marble bar. Below, on the third floor, there are two bedrooms large enough for king-size beds, as well as a family room with a kitchenette, a fully equipped cinema room and a small exercise room with a massage table.\", \"Two more bedrooms are on the second floor. One is sized for two double beds, and the other has room for four twins \\u2014 two on the floor and two on a sleeping loft above.\", \"The main bedroom suite, on the ground floor, has sliding glass doors that open to a courtyard with a shaded seating nook and a second pool.\", \"Among the neighboring properties, Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey said, is the notable Casa Arango, a circular concrete house with a deep, open terrace designed in the 1970s by the American architect John Lautner, an early apprentice of Frank Lloyd Wright.\", \"The iconic Las Brisas resort, which dates to the 1950s and is known for its white-and-pink color palette, has a private beach club. \\u201cSixty years ago,\\u201d Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey said, \\u201cLas Brisas was the most important place to be. All the famous actors and billionaires had houses there. It\\u2019s a hill, so all of the houses have these amazing views of the bay.\\u201d\", \"Acapulco International Airport is about 20 minutes away. Mexico City International Airport, which has more international flights, is a three-hour drive.\", \"Acapulco, the largest city in the Mexican state of Guerrero, has a population of roughly 780,000, according to the National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Informatics. A favorite getaway destination for the Hollywood elite and British royalty in the 1950s and \\u201960s, the area has been plagued by violence in recent years, though it remains a popular vacation spot for Mexican tourists.\", \"The average sale price of a home in Mexico rose 7.1 percent in the first half of 2021 compared with the same period in 2020, to 1.324 million pesos ($64,300), according to the country\\u2019s Federal Mortgage Society, which tracks the price of homes with mortgage credit. (Mexico does not have a multiple listing service.) Guerrero, one of Mexico\\u2019s 32 Federal Entities, saw prices rise 7.3 percent; in Acapulco, they were up 7.6 percent.\", \"The price range for homes in Acapulco is very wide, said Lola Aguirre Gutierrez, the broker at Century 21 Lol and Associates. \\u201cThere are properties facing the sea from $25,000 to $3.5 million,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt is a versatile market \\u2014 Acapulco is for all budgets.\\u201d\", \"Most properties are for resale, she said. New condos are in short supply, except in what\\u2019s called the \\u201cDiamond Zone,\\u201d a newer, upscale resort area in the south of the city. (Las Brisas sits within this zone.)\", \"The average price per square meter in Las Brisas is about $2,500 ($232 a square foot), Ms. de la Torre la Skipsey said. (Many properties in Mexico, including this one, are marketed in U.S. dollars.)\", \"Ivan Castillo, a real estate attorney and general manager of Secure Title Riviera Maya, said that the Acapulco housing market is largely a local one. \\u201cOne reason is that the Acapulco airport barely has any international flights,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo it\\u2019s more common that people from Mexico City enjoy that area. There are foreigners there, but you can hardly see any.\\u201d\", \"The pandemic caused a sharp decline in international travel to Mexico. During the first quarter of 2021, the 11.4 million visitors recorded by the economic affairs unit of the Embassy of Mexico to the United States were about half the number recorded in Q1 2020.\", \"The U.S. State Department currently advises against travel to Guerrero state because of crime and kidnapping.\", \"About 85 percent of buyers in Acapulco are from Mexico, particularly from Mexico City, Puebla, Morelos, Pachuca and Quer\\u00e9taro, Ms. Gutierrez said. \\u201cWe still retain the interest of some North Americans, but very few Europeans,\\u201d she said.\", \"Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey said several high-end hotels in Acapulco are registering record bookings of foreigners, which may suggest rising interest in investing in vacation homes.\", \"Foreign buyers must obtain a permit from Mexico\\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Additionally, Mr. Castillo said, foreign buyers purchasing within 30 miles of the coast or 60 miles of the border must buy through a Mexican bank trust or a Mexican corporation.\", \"Transactions are completed through a notary, and buyers must also fulfill government requirements put in place to prevent money laundering. \\u201cThe notary needs to verify that the money being paid for the property comes from the buyer\\u2019s own account,\\u201d Mr. Castillo said.\", \"The agent\\u2019s commission in Acapulco is usually between 4 and 6 percent of the sale price, and is paid by the owner or developer, Ms. Gutierrez said.\", \"Spanish; Mexican peso (1 peso = $0.05)\", \"The transfer tax in Acapulco is 2 percent of the purchase price, Mr. Castillo said. Closing costs, including the cost of setting up the trust, usually total between 4 and 7 percent.\", \"The annual property taxes on this home are around $1,390, and the yearly maintenance fees are $7,650, Ms. de la Torre de Skipsey said.\", \"Laura de la Torre de Skipsey, Mexico Sotheby\\u2019s International Realty, 011-52-55-3466-6198; sothebysrealty.com\"]","href_hash":"c8df36e63cab11ec9602000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c8df36e63cab11ec9602000017025a03"}},
