Those individuals then used their smartphone to detect the chip's presence or swiped the portion of their body that contained the chip over door sensors to demonstrate how it worked.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945271/covid-vaccine-record-microchips.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">People in Sweden are increasingly seeking to have microchips implanted that contain their COVID-19 vaccination information, local reports say.

When these gatherings do not require proof of vaccination, event organizers are encouraged to assign seats for attendees, ensure social distancing measures are in place and restrict groups seated together to eight or fewer people. Events that do require proof of vaccination are instructed to have a \\\"routine\\\" in place for checking attendees' vaccination records.\", \"Nearly 80 percent of people eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccination in Sweden have been fully vaccinated, according to government data. Public health officials in the country have recently urged citizens to get a COVID-19 booster shot as the virus's spread continues internationally. Those encouragements continued as Swedish officials reported earlier this week that Omicron, the latest strain identified as a \\\"variant of concern\\\" by the World Health Organization, was detected in Sweden.\", \"The wider trend of inserting under the skin microchips containing personal information has developed over the past few years, gaining popularity in Sweden. People there began using the chips to gain access to their homes, offices, gyms and more without the use of handheld keys.\", \"A 2018 NPR report said the microchips are about the size of a single grain of rice and were becoming so popular at the time that one of the main companies producing them reported difficulty keeping up with the demand. In 2017, a railway company in Sweden began allowing travelers to load their ticket information onto the microchips implanted in their bodies, according to BBC News. Railway conductors were then able to use smartphones to detect the chip and confirm the travelers' tickets.\"]","href_hash":"75255826547711ec8059f7d26a552daa"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"75255826547711ec8059f7d26a552daa"}},
