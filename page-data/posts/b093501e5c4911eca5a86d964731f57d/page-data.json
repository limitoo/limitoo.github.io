It also doesn't provide any visual tools such as graphs and maps, leaving many Hungarian journalists to try to create their own.\", \"Illes Szurovecz, who works for Hungarian news site 444.hu, told the Associated Press that if he and fellow journalists were not recording trends, \\\"it would be virtually impossible to look back in Hungary today and see how the pandemic has gone.\\\"\", \"When the government refused to release more detailed data, journalists began entering COVID-19 wards in hospitals to get their own, until the government banned it.\", \"In addition to regional statistics, experts have requested data on how many hospitalized COVID-19 patients have been vaccinated.\", \"Andras Falus, immunologist and professor emeritus at Semmelweis University in Budapest, told AP that a lot of Hungarians no longer pay attention to the data they are given because it has been so \\\"inconsistent and unreliable\\\" in the past.\", \"\\\"If there had been more data...the responses would have been much more effective,\\\" Falus said. \\\"We could have known which cities and which counties had particularly virulent infections.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950626/budapest-hungary-crowd.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">As coronavirus infections and deaths soar in Hungary, the country's journalists and public health professionals are demanding more detailed data on the outbreak from the government, with some experts saying that greater transparency might boost lagging vaccination rates.

That hesitancy is something Falus said can be partly attributed to official communications about the pandemic released by the conservative government of Prime Minister Viktor Orban being \\\"extremely poor, inconsistent and totally incapable of maintaining trust.\\\"\", \"On Friday, the government's official coronavirus website reported 166 daily deaths, 6,884 new infections and 6,939 virus patients being treated in hospitals, 573 of whom were on ventilators.\", \"Hungary's government defended its data practices, saying in an email that it was \\\"setting an example by communicating on a daily basis epidemiological data.\\\"\", \"\\\"This is one of the reasons behind the cooperation of the population, successful disease control and the fact that we are the first in the EU in terms of booster vaccination,\\\" a government spokesperson wrote, adding that criticisms of its pandemic response were \\\"politically motivated.\\\"\", \"Yet last month, Hungary's National Authority for Data Protection and Freedom of Information asked the government to release infection data at the municipal level to mayors, writing that both local leaders and the public \\\"need to know the figures in order to make informed decisions about how to protect themselves against the pandemic.\\\"\", \"Similar problems were reported earlier in the pandemic in the Czech Republic, where mayors said they lacked details about the numbers of infected people in their communities that harmed mitigation efforts like distributing personal protective equipment.\", \"Those issues were ultimately remedied late last year.\", \"Trust of official statistics also has been a problem in Russia, where some experts have criticized official data on COVID-19 infections and deaths provided by the state coronavirus task force, arguing the reported numbers were likely an undercount.\", \"Data analysts have pointed to inconsistencies in Russia's virus statistics that they say suggest manipulation.
