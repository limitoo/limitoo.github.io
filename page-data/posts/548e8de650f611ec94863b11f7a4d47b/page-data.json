This time it came calling for major championship winners with golf\\u2019s most out-in-the-open conflict, Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau.\", \"The matchup came after a highly public summer feud that existed largely on social media and that fans hoped would move to the course. But the two were then never paired in a major championship or a PGA Tour tournament, so in came this lower-stakes, 12-hole event at the Wynn Golf Club in Las Vegas.\", \"\\u201cThis is what the world\\u2019s been waiting for,\\u201d Koepka told the TNT broadcast on the third tee Friday afternoon. Koepka, a strong player at the major championships, later said the match was \\u201ckind of like my major right now,\\u201d as he hit a precise approach shot to close it out with a 4 and 3 victory on the ninth hole. There were no significant moments of tension or any real contretemps, just the usual pleasantries, mild encouragements and civil interactions accompanying a golf round.\", \"Koepka and DeChambeau spent much of the summer engaged in public sniping and expressions of distaste for each other. The feud reaches back further, into 2019, when a putting green confrontation occurred at the Northern Trust regarding Koepka\\u2019s disapproval of DeChambeau\\u2019s pace of play. There have been subtle comments and social media posts for a couple of years, with DeChambeau at one point mocking Koepka\\u2019s physique on display in the body issue of ESPN the Magazine, saying he \\u201cdidn\\u2019t have any abs.\\u201d Koepka promptly replied with a tweeted image of his four major championship trophies, captioned, \\u201cI am 2 short of a 6 pack!\\u201d\", \"The dispute was a source of occasional drama and consistent amusement among the smaller golf audience. It expanded to a much larger audience this year when footage of a Koepka interview with the Golf Channel from May\\u2019s P.G.A. Championship leaked on Twitter. In the video, Koepka loses his train of thought and lets loose a string of expletives as an unaware DeChambeau loudly passes by in his metal spikes. The video racked up 10 million views on Twitter before it was removed, and the image of Koepka\\u2019s eye-rolling annoyance became a meme.\", \"The video ignited a summer of back-and-forth between the two, with fans getting in on it, too. Security at the Memorial Tournament in June occasionally approached fans shouting \\u201cBrooks-y!\\u201d near DeChambeau. The PGA Tour said that security was informed of the heckling but that DeChambeau did not request the tour to remove fans from the grounds. Koepka responded to the development that night with a video offering free beer from his sponsor to any fans whose stay was \\u201ccut short.\\u201d The jeer then became a staple wherever DeChambeau played, leading to Jay Monahan, the PGA Tour commissioner, saying in August that it would be classified as \\u201charassing behavior\\u201d under the tour\\u2019s fan code of conduct and not be tolerated.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s disgusting the way the guy has tried to knock me down,\\u201d DeChambeau said during promotional interviews for the match. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no need for it in the game of golf. He\\u2019s just tried to knock me down at every angle, every avenue. For what reason, I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d\", \"DeChambeau continued, offering one reason: that Koepka may be motivated by benefiting from the tour\\u2019s Player Impact Program. The program distributes a $40 million bonus pool to 10 players based on a number of metrics, including popularity in Google searches. The feud, and Koepka\\u2019s pinpoint comments and social media tactics, certainly boosted both players\\u2019 profiles this year.\", \"Koepka reiterated his distaste for his opponent during the run-up to this match, adding, \\u201cI\\u2019ve said it like 10 different times: I\\u2019ve never really liked him.\\u201d There is an authentic dislike and irritation there, even if a made-for-TV match heavy on commercial breaks felt like a reductive attempt to display and resolve that.\", \"There were several charitable components to the match, and the overall series of matches had donated $30 million to various charities before this week\\u2019s edition. But this was a more commercial endeavor, hyped around a competitive beef. A lush green golf course with ornate man-made waterfalls set aside the Las Vegas Strip in the middle of the desert was an apt venue. Various one-liners and moments from their feud were emblazoned on Koepka\\u2019s cart with his beer sponsor. There were closest-to-the-hole side competitions sponsored by a sports book, a private jet company, an automobile and a recruiting service, and a long-drive challenge sponsored by a bank.\", \"Frustrations about a \\u201clong-drive challenge\\u201d most likely started this beef, more so than any publicized tweet or putting green confrontation. It was at the 2019 P.G.A. Championship that DeChambeau felt flustered by the major championship style of golf, where Koepka had so excelled. \\u201cIf you really want to prove who the best champion is, it\\u2019s not a long-drive contest,\\u201d DeChambeau told the Golf Channel about the Bethpage course setup. \\u201cThat\\u2019s why they have long-drive contests out here. It\\u2019s about precision. So when you start making it really tight, I get the tight part. But when you start lengthening it to the amounts that they\\u2019ve been lengthening it to, I just personally think that it\\u2019s a mess-up.\\u201d\", \"DeChambeau argued against major championship setups that simply use length as the primary test and defense of the course. \\u201cThat tests the best ball-striker,\\u201d he said then in May 2019. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what majors are supposed to be about. It\\u2019s not supposed to be a driving contest.\\u201d\", \"Koepka won his fourth major that week at Bethpage. DeChambeau, who walked away frustrated, would soon undergo a complete body transformation that made him the PGA Tour\\u2019s driving distance leader the last two years, and a major champion at last fall\\u2019s U.S. Open at Winged Foot in New York.\", \"The match was nothing like that crucible of a major that both have won, but Koepka will walk away with some form of bragging rights that will certainly provide more social media fodder.\"]","href_hash":"548e8de650f611ec94863b11f7a4d47b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"548e8de650f611ec94863b11f7a4d47b"}},
