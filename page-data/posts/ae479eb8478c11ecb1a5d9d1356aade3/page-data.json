But I know he's deaf as well. So he wasn't responding. So I was like, something's happened down downstairs.\\\"\", \"Mr Fletcher said he and his housemate then walked down to his house to find his 92-year-old neighbour, and his wife, walking around on broken glass.\", \"\\\"We just took control and tried to look after them to get to get the glass out of their feet, get some shoes on and start cleaning up,\\\" he said\", \"\\\"We were there for about 10 minutes and it wasn't until I started cleaning the glass that I noticed that there was a paver that had been thrown through the window or through the door.\", \"\\\"So I was like OK, someone's trying to break in here, you know, they [his neighbours] were a bit shocked and didn't know exactly what happened either.\\\"\", \"He said once he saw the paver he went outside to check on his own house, which he had left open, and grab a first aid kit for his neighbours.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'He pulled the knife out but I came with it'</div>\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/680b4524b56828a51a48d958d598b6fb\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Mr Fletcher said he thought initially he had been punched until the attacker pulled the knife out.(Supplied)</div>\", \"\\\"And as I turned into my driveway, a guy yelled out from across the road, and he said, like, did you hear the big bang? Is everyone OK?\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"And he walked toward me and as soon as he sort of walked past me, spun around and rammed a knife into my chest.\\\"\", \"Mr Fletcher said the 15-centimetre\\u00a0blade went through his rib cartilage and lodged in his sternum.\", \"\\\"I'll never forget that. Like, the ferocity and the anger and the intent that that was delivered with,\\\" he said.\", \"He said he thought initially he had been punched, until his attacker tried to pull the knife out.\", \"\\\"And then his hand slipped off and then I sort of reached for my chest, and then I had the knife in my hand, and then he saw that and ran.\\\"\", \"He said he knew immediately he was in trouble, but that as a physiotherapist trained in trauma\\u00a0he knew what to do.\", \"\\\"My job was to stay alive. I was just trying to regulate my breathing and I could still feel [the knife] in my chest and I didn't want to look at it,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"I was like, alright, compression, and I walked back to where my roommate was, where he was tending to my neighbours, and laid down on the ground while they called an ambulance,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"But I still didn't know what was actually going on\\u2026 I knew I had a big hole\\u2026 and then the knife actually fell out of my chest when I went to sit up to get into the ambulance.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Knife just missed lungs and heart</div>\", \"He said when they arrived at the Gold Coast hospital the surgeons were ready to operate, but the knife had missed all his vital organs.\", \"\\\"It missed my lungs. It nicked my pericardium, which is the sack that contains my heart, but it didn't touch my heart, missed my spleen and missed all the large vessels,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"It's, you know, one in a million, just complete luck or, you know, someone was guiding that to like miss everything but then also to be lodged in my sternum so that he [the attacker] couldn't pull it out again.\\\"\", \"Mr Fletcher spent the day providing his statement to officers, but police say there have been no arrests yet.\", \"Mr Fletcher says he only hopes his attacker gets the help he needs.\", \"\\\"That for me is the big lesson out of this. This guy, I'm sure he has a mental health condition. And I'm sure that it's unmanaged or he's\\u00a0been unable to access resources. And he's out there in the community.
