While treatments have improved and mortality rates have gone down, minorities are not seeing those benefits at the same rates as White patients.\", \"Tracy Tomer had her first mammogram at age 53, after feeling a lump in her breast. She was diagnosed with breast cancer, but there were delays before the treatment began.\", \"\\\"In this area that I live in, there's no mammogram service over here, there's no chemo service over here, there's no radiation,\\\" Tomer said.\\u00a0\", \"Black Women are more likely than White women to have tumors missed during screening and to have delays in diagnosis and treatment. One reason is access to care.\", \"\\\"All the appointments were so far away from one another,\\\" Tomer said. \\\"It's really a bad situation for women of color in this neighborhood.\\\"\", \"When it comes to breast and other cancers, the hard truth is there is a racial divide. While Black and White women have the same chance of getting breast cancer, Black women are more likely to be diagnosed with advanced cancer and are 40% more likely to die from it.\", \"Tomer's surgeon, Dr. Vivian Bea, chief of breast surgical oncology at New York-Presbyterian Brooklyn Methodist Hospital, is trying to change that equation.\", \"\\\"There are biases, there are implicit and explicit biases that exist in the health care system,\\\" she said. \\\"We have to look at the finances, the transportation.
