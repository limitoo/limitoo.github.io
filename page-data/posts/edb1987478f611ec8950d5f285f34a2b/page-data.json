Earlier this month, the Trumps filed a motion to quash these interviews, and the papers filed today by the Attorney General oppose that motion,\\\" her office said.\", \"In the court documents, James' office gave its most detailed accounting yet of its investigation into allegations that Trump's company repeatedly misstated the value of assets to get favorable loan terms or slash its tax burden.\", \" The Trump Organization, it said, had overstated the value of land donations made in New York and California on paperwork submitted to the IRS to justify several million dollars in tax deductions.\", \" The company misreported the size of Trump's Manhattan penthouse, saying it was nearly three times its actual size - a difference in value of about $200 million, James' office said, citing deposition testimony from Trump's longtime financial chief Allen Weisselberg, who was charged last year with tax fraud in a parallel criminal investigation.\", \" Investigators, the court papers said, had \\\"developed significant additional evidence indicating that the Trump Organization used fraudulent or misleading asset valuations to obtain a host of economic benefits, including loans, insurance coverage, and tax deductions.\\\"\", \"Trump's legal team has sought to block the subpoenas, calling them \\\"an unprecedented and unconstitutional maneuver.\\\" They say James is improperly attempting to obtain testimony that could then be used in a parallel criminal investigation being overseen by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg.\", \" Trump sued James in federal court last month, seeking to put an end to her investigation. In the suit, his lawyers claimed the attorney general, a Democrat, had violated the Republican's constitutional rights in a \\\"thinly-veiled effort to publicly malign Trump and his associates.\\\"\", \" In the past, the Republican ex-president has decried James' investigation and Bragg's probe as part of a \\\"witch hunt.\\\"\", \" In a statement late Tuesday, James office said it hasn't decided whether the evidence outlined in Tuesday's court papers merits legal action, but that the investigation should proceed unimpeded.\", \" \\\"For more than two years, the Trump Organization has used delay tactics and litigation in an attempt to thwart a legitimate investigation into its financial dealings,\\\" James said. \\\"Thus far in our investigation, we have uncovered significant evidence that suggests Donald J.
