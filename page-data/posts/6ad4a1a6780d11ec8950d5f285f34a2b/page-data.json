He's able to take the line on, which he enjoys, and he loves the physicality, so he's enjoying the defensive side of it as well.\", \"\\\"At the moment, it looks like it suits him.\\\"\", \"The Blues haven't been able to settle on a regular at the position in recent seasons, where the likes of Harry Plummer and TJ Faiane have been among the players through that rotating door. All Blacks selectors have had similar issues, and will undoubtedly have a keen eye trained on Tuivasa-Sheck's progress.\", \"With Plummer now specified as a first-five and TJ Faiane heading to Japan, Tuivasa-Sheck's main competition for the spot will come from rookie Corey Evans and Tanielu Tele'a.\", \"MacDonald will have his fingers crossed Tuivasa-Sheck will be the answer he's been searching for to complete his star-studded backline, where the prospect of him slotting in next to All Blacks kingpins Beauden Barrett and Rieko Ioane is mouthwatering for the Blues faithful.\\u00a0\", \"Since pre-season training began in November, reviews have been overwhelmingly positive for Tuivasa-Sheck from both teammates and coaching staff.\\u00a0\", \"Emboldened by his coaches, the former Warriors and Kiwis captain has naturally gravitated towards a leadership role amongst the squad, and McDonald says his wealth of rugby league knowledge and experience have been a valuable resource.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's one of the things we encouraged right from the start is he needs to have a voice and although he might feel like he's a rookie in terms of rugby experience, he's experienced in the game,\\\" says McDonald.\", \"\\\"The game of league and rugby have a lot of similarities. Communication is important, getting set early and getting your eyes up and looking for space, they're all the same.\", \"\\\"In some areas we're learning off him, around some of the things he learnt during his league days.\", \"All that remains now is for Tuivasa-Sheck - who e whose boots have never been itchier - to be let loose on a rugby field. He hasn't played rugby since 2011, when he starred at schoolboy level for Otahuhu College.\", \"\\\"He's contributing really well. He's contributing well in the meeting rooms as well and I think he now just wants to get out there and play a game of rugby.\\\"\", \"\\\"It just feels like forever. He's had the carrot in front of him a few times and it just keeps being pulled away.\", \"\\\"He just wants to play.\\\"\", \"His first opportunity to do so will come against the Hurricanes in Warkworth in the Blues' opening pre-season match in Mahurangi on February 5.\", \"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"6ad4a1a6780d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6ad4a1a6780d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
