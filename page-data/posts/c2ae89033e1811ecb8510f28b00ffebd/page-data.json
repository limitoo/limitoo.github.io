The organization, which maintained a whites-only policy for performing artists, refused. A public pressure campaign to get the group to reverse its decision came to nothing, but Eleanor Roosevelt resigned her membership in protest, and through the efforts of Harold L. Ickes, the secretary of the interior, the Lincoln Memorial was approved as a new location.\", \"But the controversy surrounding the event swirled in newspapers around the country. No longer just a concert, it had become a civil rights battlefield. The pressure on Anderson was overwhelming.\", \"The Daughters\\u2019s discriminatory actions had stung Anderson deeply, taking her back to formative events in her life \\u2014 especially when, at 17, she went to the Philadelphia Musical Academy seeking admission and a snippy secretary would not even hand her an application.\", \"But that was then. She had spent five rewarding years in Europe in the early 1930s, with more welcoming audiences and institutions. She found mentors, coaches and supporters; she began performing to acclaim. During one seven-month tour of Scandinavia, she gave more than 100 concerts.\", \"Returning to the United States in 1935, she began performing extensively, doing circuits of colleges and concert halls where she was welcomed, starting with a crucial recital at Town Hall in New York. The New York Times critic Howard Taubman wrote, \\u201cLet it be said at the outset: Marian Anderson has returned to her native land one of the great singers of our time.\\u201d She made recordings, and she became wealthy: In 1938 her income was $238,000 (roughly $4.5 million today), though she was still a second-class citizen in her own country who on tour often ate dinner alone in her hotel room to avoid segregated restaurants.\", \"Anderson feared that her Lincoln Memorial concert would come to define her. And to a large extent, it did. But the full breadth of her artistry is newly evident with the release, from Sony Classical, of a new commemorative book, offering her complete RCA Victor recordings from 1924 to 1966 on 15 discs \\u2014 timed to the 125th anniversary, coming in February, of Anderson\\u2019s birth in Philadelphia.\", \"The recordings are magnificent. There is her 1950 account of Mahler\\u2019s \\u201cKindertotenlieder\\u201d with the San Francisco Symphony, conducted by Pierre Monteux. Her splendid voice \\u2014 a true (and rare) example of a contralto, the lowest-range female voice \\u2014 is ideal for this music, Mahler\\u2019s settings of five piercing ruminations on the death of children.\", \"Deep, mellow tones provide the foundation of her voice. Even when she shapes midrange lyrical phrases and soars up to high passages with soprano-like radiance, the sound still somehow emanates from those awesome low tones. Her slightly tremulous vibrato can sometimes seem like shakiness. Yet the wavering more often exudes richness and warmth, and a touch of vulnerability. The feelings and emotions she draws from the words are overwhelming.\", \"Arturo Toscanini heard Anderson in 1935 in Salzburg, Austria \\u2014 when, excluded from official Salzburg Festival performances because of her race, she performed in a hotel ballroom. Afterward the imposing maestro approached her and said, famously, that what he had just heard \\u201cone is privileged to hear once in a hundred years,\\u201d responding to the singular shadings and textures of her deep-set sound, and the extraordinarily nuances she could create through her wide range. (Naturally, Hurok seized Toscanini\\u2019s words and thereafter billed Anderson as the \\u201cvoice of the century.\\u201d)\", \"Those qualities run through a recording of Schubert lieder, paired here with a sternly beautiful account of Schumann\\u2019s cycle \\u201cFrauenliebe und -leben,\\u201d mostly recorded in 1950 and \\u201951 and accompanied sensitively by the German pianist Franz Rupp, Anderson\\u2019s recital partner from the \\u201940s on. In Schubert\\u2019s \\u201cSt\\u00e4ndchen\\u201d the long melodic arcs flow with wistful grace while never sacrificing tautness. In \\u201cGretchen am Spinnrade,\\u201d Anderson truly becomes the young woman in the Goethe text, both terrified and thrilled at the desire a handsome stranger has aroused in her. There is a haunting, internal quality to Anderson\\u2019s performance, suggesting an innocent girl brooding over her confusions.\", \"There are many finely detailed lieder singers, though. What finally made Anderson so exceptional is a quality hard to define but impossible to miss: the authenticity that permeates her singing. In this regard, the most revealing recording in the new set may be a program featuring arias by Bach and Handel, mostly dating from the mid-1940s. (Robert Shaw and Charles O\\u2019Connell are the conductors).\", \"In \\u201cErbarme dich, mein Gott,\\u201d a sublimely sad aria from Bach\\u2019s \\u201cSt. Matthew Passion,\\u201d Anderson\\u2019s singing is direct and honest, steady and true, at once calm and intense. Her performance of \\u201cHe was despised\\u201d from Handel\\u2019s \\u201cMessiah\\u201d comes across as a fully lived-in experience. Indeed, when she sang this solo in a \\u201cMessiah\\u201d performance in Philadelphia in 1916, when she was still in her teens, a critic wrote that Anderson \\u201cfelt with her soft, strong voice the sorrows of God.\\u201d\", \"Anderson grappled with hardships in her youth, especially the death of her father following a severe head injury while selling ice and coal at a train terminal, leaving a wife and three daughters. Just 12 at the time, Anderson, the eldest, was forced to delay high school for several years and take odd jobs. Her beloved grandfather \\u2014 who was born enslaved in Virginia and, once freed, became a farm laborer and the first Anderson to settle in Philadelphia \\u2014 died the following year.\", \"These events stayed with her as she learned to confront every challenge with affecting dignity. Was this the source of what I\\u2019m calling authenticity? It\\u2019s hard to say. But it surely accounts for her identification with spirituals \\u2014 repertory she sang on every recital she gave, and works she invested with the same care she brought to German art songs. Several of the recordings in the new set offer her in affecting performances of spirituals. There are also collections of Christmas carols; an album titled \\u201cSongs of Eventide\\u201d; and more.\", \"Anderson\\u2019s way of confronting racism had been to offer herself as a model of Black excellence, rather than speaking out explicitly about politics. But by the 1950s, a new generation of activists began challenging segregation more directly. In 1951, the N.A.A.C.P. called for a boycott of a recital she was to give in Richmond, Va., because the audience was to be segregated.\", \"The action worked: Three-quarters of the seats in the hall were empty. And soon after, Anderson became more outspoken and vowed not to appear before segregated audiences. (The roiling social, racial and political currents that affected her life and career are presented in an insightful documentary, \\u201cVoice of Freedom,\\u201d broadcast earlier this year and part of PBS\\u2019s American Experience series.)\", \"There was one more milestone to come. In 1955 Anderson broke the color barrier for soloists at the Metropolitan Opera, singing the small but crucial role of the fortune teller Ulrica in Verdi\\u2019s \\u201cUn Ballo in Maschera.\\u201d In earlier years, European houses had approached her about performing in opera, but she declined, having had no opportunity to learn the repertory or develop her acting skills.\", \"But as the civil rights movement gained headway in America, Rudolf Bing, the Met\\u2019s general manager, realized that the company had to respond. He wanted an artist without controversy to be the first. And by then, who didn\\u2019t admire Marian Anderson?\", \"She was very hesitant. But, after some encouraging work with opera coaches, she decided to proceed; received $1,000 per performance, the highest fee at the house at the time; and came to embrace her pioneering role.\", \"When the production opened, the starry cast included Zinka Milanov, Richard Tucker, Leonard Warren and the young Roberta Peters, with Dimitri Mitropoulos conducting. Recalling the moment when the curtain went up, Anderson later wrote, \\u201cI trembled, and when the audience applauded and applauded before I could sing a note I felt myself tightening into a knot.\\u201d\", \"She was almost 58, past her vocal prime. But she did it, won solid reviews and a place in history. Sony\\u2019s set includes an album of excerpts from the opera recorded in a studio around the same time (though Jan Peerce replaced Tucker). Compelling moments in Anderson\\u2019s singing of the role suggest what her career in opera might have been.\", \"The American Experience documentary opens with poignant footage of Anderson on the morning of her Lincoln Memorial concert, going though sound checks on the platform, looking nervous and wary. For all her fears, the concert was a triumph. A mixed crowd of 75,000, more people than had ever gathered on the Mall, heard Anderson sing a 30-minute program that opened with \\u201cMy Country \\u2019Tis of Thee,\\u201d included Schubert\\u2019s \\u201cAve Maria\\u201d and a Donizetti aria, and ended with a group of spirituals. Millions more heard it broadcast on the radio.\", \"In time, the Daughters of the American Revolution dropped its exclusionary policy at Constitution Hall. Anderson performed there in a war relief benefit in 1943. And it was sweet justice when, in 1964, she began an extended farewell tour with a recital there, too.\"]","href_hash":"c2ae89033e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c2ae89033e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}},
