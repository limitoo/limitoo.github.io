He explained that in the wild, these animals are often swallowed whole by predators thus not needing the ability to to detect pain.\", \"Though despite Ayers insight, the new report from LSE says otherwise:\", \"\\\"I'm pleased to see the government implementing a central recommendation of my team's report,\\\" Dr. Jonathan Birch, Associate Professor at LSE's Centre for Philosophy of Natural and Social Science and principal investigator on the Foundations of Animal Sentience project, said in a report released by the school. \\\"After reviewing over 300 scientific studies, we concluded that cephalopod molluscs and decapod crustaceans should be regarded as sentient, and should therefore be included within the scope of animal welfare law.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937982/lobster-fishing.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A study from LSE found significant evidence to support that lobsters do feel pain thus recommending against boiling alive. Here, a man holds a lobster. </div>\", \"The Foundations of Animal Sentience project (ASENT) is a five-year European Research Council-funded project led by Birch that looks to examine the way in which sentience is attributed to certain types of animals.\", \"The report also recommended against practices that might be considered inhumane given the findings. The recommendations advise against \\\"declawing, nicking, eyestalk ablation, the sale of live decapod crustaceans to untrained, non-expert handlers, and extreme slaughter methods such as live boiling without stunning.\\\"\", \"In a statement published by the U.K. government on November 19, they explained that this announcement will not impact \\\"any existing legislation or industry practices such as fishing.\\\"\", \"\\\"There will be no direct impact on the shellfish catching or restaurant industry,\\\" the statement said. \\\"Instead, it is designed to ensure animal welfare is well considered in future decision-making.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"98c2cc924bd911eca675cd48c0f4e854"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"98c2cc924bd911eca675cd48c0f4e854"}},
