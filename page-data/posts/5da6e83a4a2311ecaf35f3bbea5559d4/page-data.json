Although Lindell and others continue to spread the misinformation, the \\\"evidence\\\" they have brought forward to support their theory has been consistently discredited and debunked.\", \"During an August cyber symposium organized by Lindell, screen shots from a Lake County computer system not involved in conducting elections were shared as alleged \\\"evidence\\\" of election fraud, The Washington Post first reported on Friday.\", \"Lake County official quickly began looking into the issue, confused by how and why the information was used in Lindell's event.\", \"\\\"We were shocked that sleepy little Lake County, where nobody had ever made a suggestion of election malfeasance, was suddenly being splashed around a cyber symposium,\\\" Lake County auditor Christopher Galloway told Cleveland.com.\", \"Galloway said he quickly began working with county and state officials to see how the data had been accessed and shared.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937153/mike-lindell.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Data from an Ohio county computer system was shared at My Pillow founder Mike Lindell's cyber symposium in August.

However, they have confirmed that no significant data was compromised.\", \"\\\"We are thrilled that our infrastructure stayed strong,\\\" Ross McDonald, director of the Lake County Board of Elections, told the Post.\", \"McDonald also explained to Cleveland.com that the Elections Board's data is \\\"fully segmented from the county networks,\\\" asserting that there's no way someone could breach the elections system.\", \"\\\"Cybersecurity has taken a strong hold in Ohio's boards of elections,\\\" he said.\", \"Lindell told the Post that the data was circulated at the symposium by a \\\"rogue\\\" attendee without his approval.\", \"\\\"It's concerning that somebody would\\u2014especially somebody in a government office, somebody who is an elected official, or somebody who's part of county government\\u2014would not realize all of those safeguards exist and would try to engage in some sort of a vigilante investigation,\\\" Ohio Secretary of State Frank LaRose, a Republican, told the Post. \\\"The good news is that our system of cyber security in Ohio is among the best in the nation.\\\"\", \"Although Lindell's efforts have not uncovered credible evidence of widespread election fraud, he continues to claim that he will file a challenge to the 2020 election results directly with the Supreme Court with the support of states' attorneys general. He has asserted that he believes the high court will rule 9-to-0 to throw out the presidential election results.\", \"Despite the claims of Trump and Lindell, no evidence has been brought forward to substantiate their theories. On the contrary, more than 60 election challenge lawsuits have failed in state and federal courts. Even judges appointed by Trump and other Republicans have rejected the allegations. Meanwhile, audits and recounts across the country have consistently reaffirmed Biden's victory.\", \"Former U.S. Attorney General William Barr, who was widely viewed as one of Trump's most loyal Cabinet members, said in December that there was \\\"no evidence\\\" of widespread fraud that would change the election results.\", \"Additionally, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency at the Department of Homeland Security asserted that the 2020 election was the \\\"most secure in American history\\\" while it was still led by a Trump appointee last year.\"]","href_hash":"5da6e83a4a2311ecaf35f3bbea5559d4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5da6e83a4a2311ecaf35f3bbea5559d4"}},
