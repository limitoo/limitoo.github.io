will no longer perform laparoscopic surgery at another without a senior clinician present.\", \"The Queanbeyan Public Hospital told the ABC Dr Omar Adham stopped working there following notification of an investigation into Dr Adham by the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA)\\u00a0and a review of internal complaints.\", \"Meanwhile, The Canberra Hospital (TCH) has entered an agreement with the gynaecologist.\", \"Lawyers for Dr Adham, lead gynaecologist at TCH's Endometriosis Centre, told the ABC he initiated the arrangement with the ACT hospital to \\\"act in a manner that is transparent\\\" and to \\\"show the community and patients that he has nothing to hide in respect of his clinical competence\\\".\", \"ACT Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said Dr Adham made the decision \\\"of his own volition and with agreement of CHS [Canberra Health Services]\\\".\", \"Concerned Canberrans and former patients who complained about treatment with Dr Adham were told the news last week in a letter from Ms Stephen-Smith.\", \"The letter, seen by the ABC, said Dr Adham's complication rates had been reviewed by CHS which \\\"conducted internal and external benchmarking on other gynaecologists who perform similar procedures\\\", and were not found to be outliers compared to those of other gynaecologists.\", \"The arrangements follow a report by the\\u00a0ABC's 730 about three women who experienced serious complications following surgery with Dr Adham and repair surgery with other doctors.\", \"AHPRA has confirmed it is investigating a number of complaints from former patients of the gynaecologist, and the minister's letter said a response from the regulator was expected \\\"imminently\\\" and CHS would act on \\\"any recommendations that may arise from its investigation.\\\"\", \"The ABC is aware of nine complaints currently under investigation by AHPRA spanning procedures undertaken between 2013 and 2019, and an earlier complaint that was referred to the regulator in 2010.\", \"Dr Adham's lawyers said the arrangement to have another specialist attending procedures applied\\u00a0at The Canberra Hospital only.\", \"CHS told the ABC: \\\"The arrangement will continue until Dr Adham wishes for it to cease.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/6c565fbb2acdc14cec2494521feaee0d\\\"

AHPRA/Medical Board \\u2026 investigation and a review of internal complaints.\\\"\", \"Through his solicitor, Dr Adham told the ABC that, to the best of his knowledge, \\\"AHPRA's investigations all relate to matters arising in the ACT and not in Queanbeyan.\\\"\", \"\\\"Dr Adham has not been made aware by the SNSWLHD of the substance of any internal complaints.\\\"\", \"<img

and are subject to reinstatement following a positive outcome of the hospital's review process.\\\"\", \"AHPRA told the ABC it was not involved in Dr Adham's agreement with CHS and there would be no notification posted on his registration about the arrangement.\", \"\\\"The Health Practitioner Regulation National Law does not require inclusion on the public register of employment arrangements

surgery were not found to be outliers compared to complications rates published in the literature\\\".\", \"\\\"[T]he complication rates relating to Dr Adham's laparoscopic surgery were consistent with other practitioners,\\\" Ms Stephen-Smith told the ABC.\", \"The majority of former patients of Dr Adham who have contacted the ABC about complications they experienced after their operations, were operated on laparoscopically.\", \"The letter said \\\"one in seven patients will experience a complication from this type of surgery, with one in 20 having a major complication.\\\"\",
