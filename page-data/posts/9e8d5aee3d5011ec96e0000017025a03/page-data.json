Think of how so many of us have been named convict and number. I know his state number, but will keep it to myself. Now Juvie has died just months after freedom and Tracy K. Smith reminds me that, \\u201cbeing called all manner of things / from the dictionary of shame,\\u201d we do learn to become something mighty, with the memories of those fallen. Selected by Reginald Dwayne Betts\", \"By Tracy K. Smith\", \"Being called all manner of thingsfrom the Dictionary of Shame \\u2014 not English, not words, not heard,but worn, borne, carried, never spent \\u2014 we feel now a largeness coming on,something passing into us. We knownot in what source it was begun, butrapt, we watch it rise through our fallen,our slain, our millions dragged, chained.Like daylight setting leaves alight \\u2014 green to gold to blinding white.Like a spirit caught. Flame-in-flesh.I watched a woman try to shake it, once,from her shoulders and hips. A wildannihilating fright. Other womenformed a wall around her, holding backwhat clamored to rise. God. Devil.Ancestor. What Black bodies carrythrough your schools, your cities.Do you see how mighty you\\u2019ve made us,all these generations running?Every day steeling ourselves against it.Every day coaxing it back into coils.And all the while feeding it.And all the while loving it.\", \"\"]","href_hash":"9e8d5aee3d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9e8d5aee3d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}},
