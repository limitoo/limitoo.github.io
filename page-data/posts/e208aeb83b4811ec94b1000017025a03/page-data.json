The cryptocurrencies are issued by a new breed of financial technology companies like Tether and Circle. They are not banks, at least so far, and they are not simply tech companies that sell online services. They operate as both and have few rules to guide them.\", \"Regulators made clear Monday that they want a new law that forces these types of issuers to be subject to requirements like those of traditional banks and financial institutions. Such a designation would require an issuer to have adequate reserves to ensure it could meet demands by customers to cash out quickly, to avoid destabilizing runs.\", \"But the working group has determined that such authority would have to come from an act of Congress and that it could not currently mandate standards for digital payments reliant on stablecoins. That lack of authority, the report said, makes these types of crypto-based transactions more vulnerable to \\u201chuman errors, management failures or disruptions\\u201d that could result in consumers losing money, being victims of fraud or unable to access money.\", \"Federal law also cannot now prevent retailers and other commercial companies from issuing their own stablecoins, potentially creating risky overlaps between commerce and banking.\", \"\\u201cStablecoins and stablecoin arrangements raise significant concerns from an investor protection and market integrity perspective,\\u201d the report says.\"]","href_hash":"e208aeb83b4811ec94b1000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e208aeb83b4811ec94b1000017025a03"}},
