Foley will become executive chair.\", \"Moving to cut costs, Peloton also said it would lay off 2,800 workers across its global operations. The cuts will include corporate, warehouse and delivery jobs.\\u00a0\", \"The management change comes as rumors swirl that a range of big-name suitors may be weighing a bid for Peloton, whose financial performance has flagged over the last year after its stock soared in 2020 during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic.\", \"Peloton shares surged on Monday on reports that Apple, Amazon, Disney, Microsoft or Nike may make a play for the maker of internet-enabled exercise bikes and treadmills.
