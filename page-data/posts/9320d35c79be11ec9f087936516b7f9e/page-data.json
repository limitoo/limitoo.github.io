They have a remote sensor that sends a signal via satellite if an animal is caught in the trap which avoids the need for daily checks.\", \"A motion sensor camera identifed a cat within 500 metres of one nest and a possum making regular visits.\", \"DOC ranger Ricki Mitchell, whose does some of the monitoring work, put a trap close to the nest which caught two possums in quick succession, after that no further possum visits were recorded.\", \"The other monitored nest was in the Rotoiti Nature Recovery Project area in Nelson Lakes National Park and is also protected by a number of traps.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/136974/eight_col_Two_kea_chicks_Rainbow_Conservation_Area_2_Photo_DOC.png?1642644580\\\" alt=\\\"Motion sensor cameras outside monitored nests capture images of kea and any predator activity at the nest.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nMotion sensor cameras outside monitored nests capture images of kea and any predator activity at the nest. \\nPhoto: Supplied / Department of Conservation\\n</div>\", \"Last year's breeding season also started out with six chicks in two nests, but only one survived.\", \"A stoat is thought to have predated three chicks in a monitored nest on the Raglan Range.
