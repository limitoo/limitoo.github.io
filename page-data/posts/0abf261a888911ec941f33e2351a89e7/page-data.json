The K.S.O.C. said in the statement that the relationship between the international sports community and the referees was \\u201cwas biased and not transparent,\\u201d and also cited the emotional distress of the athletes who had \\u201cshed blood, sweat and tears\\u201d in preparation for the Games.\", \"The skaters, Hwang Dae-heon and Lee June-seo, were disqualified in the 1,000-meter semifinals on Monday evening. Hwang, who had been a strong medal contender, is the second-ranked 1,000-meter skater in world this season.\", \"Hwang won his semifinal with an audacious pass of two Chinese skaters but was disqualified when referees determined that his pass was late and caused contact. In the other semifinal, Lee was penalized for a lane change that caused contact. Both Hwang and Lee were seemingly distraught by the decisions, blowing through the media zone after their races without stopping to speak with the South Korean journalists who were chasing after them.\", \"The International Skating Union, the sport\\u2019s governing body, said in a statement that the South Korean team had protested only the penalty against Hwang. The referee reaffirmed his decision, and the I.S.U. said that, according to the applicable rules, protests were not even allowed.\", \"The Hungarian team also lodged a protest after one of its skaters, Shaolin Sandor Liu, was disqualified and given a yellow card minutes after finishing first in the men\\u2019s 1,000-meter final, both for causing contact and for blocking another skater with his arm. That protest was similarly rejected.\", \"Important referee rulings and controversial disqualifications are the norm in short-track speedskating, where some contact is allowed and falls happen regularly. But the calls at these Olympics have received particular scrutiny because a number of them have seemingly benefited the home nation, allowing it to win three medals, two of them gold, so far.\", \"In the men\\u2019s 1,000-meter finals, the Chinese skater Ren Ziwei won gold and his countryman Li Wenlong won silver, each moving up a place after Liu\\u2019s disqualification. The Chinese mixed-gender relay team also won a gold medal, even after it finished last in its semifinal. But it was able to advance to the finals after both the United States and Russia were disqualified, with the Americans in particular baffled by the blocking penalty called on them.\", \"After the event, the backlash in the South Korean news media was strong. The major broadcaster SBS aired a video package titled \\u201cTop 10 worst moments of cheating by China\\u201d in which clips showed Chinese speedskaters interfering with other athletes. A Seoul newspaper published an article with the headline, \\u201cJust let China take all the medals, just let China take all the medals.\\u201d\", \"Short-track speedskating is extremely popular in South Korea. Four years ago, short trackers won six of the 17 medals South Korea captured as the host country of the Games in Pyeongchang, including a silver for Hwang in the 500-meter race.\"]","href_hash":"0abf261a888911ec941f33e2351a89e7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0abf261a888911ec941f33e2351a89e7"}},
