He searched the word \\u201ctennis,\\u201d but Ms. Peng \\u2014 one of China\\u2019s most famous athletes \\u2014 appeared in barely any results. With stunning efficiency, China\\u2019s censors had began scrubbing references to her allegations from the internet.\", \"\\u201cAll of a sudden, it became a forbidden topic,\\u201d Mr. Chen said.\", \"Ms. Peng is not the first celebrity in China to be almost entirely erased by censors. The country\\u2019s online propaganda machine can make just about any story \\u2014 or person \\u2014 vanish. Yet her international profile has made the task harder, and China\\u2019s attempt to brush her allegations aside has been met with deep criticism around the world.\", \"On Wednesday, the Women\\u2019s Tennis Association Tour suspended its future tournaments in the country, prompting China\\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs to reiterate that China was \\u201copposed to the politicization of sports.\\u201d But Chinese tennis fans are pushing back as well, using subtle, sometimes tongue-in-cheek language to voice their frustration online while trying to outmaneuver censors.\", \"On Chinese social media, there has been little outright discussion about Ms. Peng. A popular online tennis fan club in China, a forum called Tennis Post Bar, hasn\\u2019t been updated since Nov. 2, the day Ms. Peng, a three-time Olympian, publicly made her accusations against Zhang Gaoli, a former vice premier.\", \"To evade the censors, Chinese tennis fans have started to use obscure references to call more attention to Ms. Peng\\u2019s silence. Instead of identifying her Chinese name and specifying the details of her allegations, some people have used the vague references like \\u201ca tennis player\\u201d and \\u201cthe spat.\\u201d\", \"There was a seemingly unrelated post about art that used the expression \\u201chitting an egg against a rock.\\u201d It echoed a line in Ms. Peng\\u2019s original allegation, in which she wrote that going up against someone as powerful as Mr. Zhang was like \\u201chitting a rock with an egg.\\u201d\", \"Even state media figures have found themselves challenged by how to discuss Ms. Peng without setting off alarms. Commenting on Twitter, which is banned in the country, Hu Xijin, the editor in chief of the Chinese Communist Party\\u2019s official state newspaper, referred to Ms. Peng\\u2019s accusations as \\u201cthe thing people talked about.\\u201d\", \"Two weeks into the media blackout, some of the biggest names in tennis began to wonder aloud about Ms. Peng\\u2019s safety. Chinese state media responded by releasing a flurry of content for international viewers purporting to confirm that she was happy and in no harm. One of the stories managed to reach the domestic audience in China.\", \"It included pictures of Ms. Peng signing giant tennis balls for fans at a youth tennis tournament. A post on the verified account of China Open, a professional tennis tournament in Beijing, was shared nearly a thousand times, and caught the attention of exasperated commenters.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s the most reposted youth tournament event post I\\u2019ve ever seen in my career,\\u201d Zhang Bendou, a veteran tennis expert in China, wrote on Weibo, the Chinese social media platform. Others made more mocking remarks. \\u201cAlmost everyone is asking \\u2018where is **\\u2019?\\u201d one person wrote, leaving Ms. Peng\\u2019s name out of the comment. \\u201cShe showed up.\\u201d\", \"For Lucy Wang, a dentist and a tennis fan in Beijing who watched one of Ms. Peng\\u2019s singles matches in person at the China Open in 2017, the photos were enough to put her mind at ease. \\u201cKnowing that she\\u2019s back is enough for me,\\u201d said Ms. Wang, 37. \\u201cI have no idea why people outside China are still not satisfied.\\u201d\", \"The International Olympic Committee later published a statement and photo of Ms. Peng smiling in a live video call with the organization\\u2019s president. China, which is set to host the Winter Olympics in February, seized on the moment to complain that most Western media and sports organizations had been biased and dishonest about the case.\", \"On Thursday, the I.O.C. released another statement, saying members of the organization had held a second videoconference with Ms. Peng this week, but offered no details about the conversation. It said it was using \\u201cquiet diplomacy\\u201d with Chinese sports organizations to address the matter.\", \"Steve Simon, the chief executive of the W.T.A. Tour, has been one of the most outspoken critics of the Chinese authorities, demanding an investigation into the #MeToo allegations. News of the W.T.A. Tour suspension circulated briefly on the Chinese internet Thursday morning.\", \"Some users on Weibo expressed support for the decision before their comments were removed. \\u201cThis time I\\u2019m with the W.T.A.,\\u201d one wrote. Another was puzzled by the fact that Mr. Zhang had not yet been detained. \\u201cHe really has very strong backing,\\u201d the post said. \\u201cRidiculous.\\u201d\", \"While these anonymous online commenters have tried to use the internet to push back against the censors, the seriousness of the allegations has made many in China hesitant to talk about Ms. Peng in public.\", \"Ashley Tian did not find out about Ms. Peng\\u2019s accusation until Nov. 3, the day after it was posted. At that point, \\u201conline discussions were as clean as a blank sheet of paper,\\u201d she said. Ms. Tian, a former sportswriter in Shanghai, heard about from a former colleague, who explained the details in a voice message.\", \"At dinner that evening, Ms. Tian shared the message with some friends, who leaned in closely for the discussion. \\u201cShould we talk about it here?\\u201d Ms. Tian recalled one friend asking nervously. They changed the subject.\", \"\\u201cPeople don\\u2019t even dare to discuss it in public,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI guess what Peng really went through would remain a mystery forever.\\u201d\", \"As an avid fan who had seen Ms. Peng play tennis at tournaments in Zhuhai and Shenzhen, Mr. Chen said his experience of trying to find out what had happened to her that evening was both frustrating and an eye-opener. \\u201cI was shocked and clueless how fast these things evolve,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Chen is still unsettled by the whole experience and said he was disappointed with the W.T.A. Tour\\u2019s announcement on Wednesday, saying he prefers to watch female tennis players because he believes women have more diverse skills on the court than men do.\", \"He said especially loved to watch Ms. Peng\\u2019s powerful serves, but questioned whether her allegations would ever be investigated in China. \\u201cWe know these kinds of things happen and we care about them,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut most of us choose to remain silent.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cThat\\u2019s the reality in China.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"1d5d63c2535f11ecacd83f1311f0cd4c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1d5d63c2535f11ecacd83f1311f0cd4c"}},
