covered in dots out of the tusk of a woolly mammoth.\", \"When placed together, the two 4.5-centimetre-long incomplete fragments appear to make up a pendant, according to an international team of archaeologists.\", \"\\\"When you see the piece, it is amazing,\\\" said Sahra Talamo of the University of Bologna.\", \"The series of dots on the two fragments of\\u00a0ivory\\u00a0may count the number of animals hunted, or keep track of the Moon or Sun.\", \"Whatever their meaning, the piece\\u00a0is the earliest-known\\u00a0decorated jewellery created by modern humans in\\u00a0Eurasia, according to Professor Talamo and colleagues in a\\u00a0study\\u00a0published today in Scientific Reports.\", \"\\\"It is the first\\u00a0time ever that a pendant\\u00a0or something that is considered symbolic behaviour from Homo sapiens\\u00a0has been\\u00a0directly dated [in Eurasia],\\\" Professor Talamo said.\", \"But while the team believe the object is jewellery, Australian\\u00a0expert Michelle Langley thinks it may be something even more intriguing.\", \"\\\"I think that's a fragment of a repaired boomerang,\\\" Dr Langley said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Sifting through layers of history</div>\", \"The fragments\\u00a0were\\u00a0discovered\\u00a0in 2010 from the Stajnia Cave in southern Poland, along with a 6cm-long\\u00a0awl \\u2014\\u00a0a needle-like tool used to make holes,\\u00a0crafted from horse bone.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3e79b5dac4999d4254a553b5841eda07\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> The bone pendant was discovered in the Stajnia Cave in Poland.(Supplied: Marcin Zarski)</div>\", \"The cave contains layers of\\u00a0Neanderthal remains\\u00a0as well as tools made by modern humans.\", \"When the pendant fragments and awl were first discovered, it was thought they might have been created by Neanderthals, Professor Talamo said.\", \"The\\u00a0pendant and awl were found alongside Neanderthal teeth, but the layers of the site were so mixed up no-one was sure how old they were.\", \"\\\"The site was a mess,\\\" Professor Talamo said.\", \"\\\"The only way to attribute this [object] to Neanderthal\\u00a0or Homo sapiens\\u00a0was to directly date them.\\\"\", \"Radiocarbon dating of small samples of collagen taken from the ivory\\u00a0showed\\u00a0the artefacts\\u00a0were\\u00a0between 42,000 and 37,000 years old.\", \"While older jewellery has been found elsewhere in Eurasia, such as carved bear teeth in 46,000-year-old sediment in\\u00a0Bacho Kiro\\u00a0Cave in Bulgaria, it is not engraved with patterns like the ivory from Poland.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What does this tell us about early humans in Eurasia?</div>\", \"The date of the artefacts coincides with the push of\\u00a0our species, Homo sapiens,\\u00a0into Europe at a time when\\u00a0Neanderthals had almost disappeared.\", \"While Neanderthals did make jewellery out of bone, the pattern on the ornament is distinctly Homo sapien.\", \"Professor Talamo said there were almost certainly older examples of the dotted style on artefacts in Africa.\\u00a0\", \"But just where and when modern humans brought this style of art with them into Europe is still a mystery.\", \"Ivory ornaments with dots depicting animals, such as lions, fish and a horse, and thought to be about 40,000 years old, have\\u00a0been found\\u00a0in shelters associated with Homo sapiens in France and Germany.\", \"But they have not been directly dated, Professor Talamo said.\", \"\\\"Most of the sites where these figurines or flutes or other things were found \\u2026\\u00a0were\\u00a0 excavated long ago, so that means that most of the time the layers are contaminated.\\\"\", \"Professor Talamo said the only way to get a better picture of how the people and their art\\u00a0spread throughout Europe would be to directly date the collection of patterned objects.\", \"\\\"Nobody wants to give such beautiful jewellery for dating, because radiocarbon dating is a destructive method.\\\"\", \"But it's\\u00a0much better than it used to be, said Professor Talamo, who developed a method to ensure only a tiny amount \\u2014\\u00a0about 1/8th of a teaspoon \\u2014\\u00a0of collagen was removed from the artefact.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Jewellery or a boomerang?</div>\", \"As they say, the meaning of art is in the eye of the beholder.\", \"With its creator long gone, it is hard to know why they made the artefact.\", \"\\\"We can only suppose [what it was] based on our way of thinking right now, but their\\u00a0way of thinking was totally different,\\\" Professor Talamo said.\", \"\\\"It could be anything, but we like to say it is like [a pendant], because this is our imagination on things,\\\" she said, adding that as an Italian, she had a soft spot for\\u00a0jewellery.\", \"But as soon as Dr Langley,\\u00a0an archaeologist at Griffith University who was not involved in the study, saw the images, she was reminded of artefacts found in Australia.\", \"\\\"The perforations are how Indigenous Australians repair a\\u00a0crack in their hardwood boomerangs,\\\" she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/bcf5d08f4c07b3c84fa1c843dc8f0eb0\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> A repaired hardwood boomerang

use-wear on the curved edge and comparing that with boomerang stuff.\\\"\", \"While we think of boomerangs as being Australian, they have been found elsewhere in the world.\", \"In fact, an ivory boomerang dated to around 23,000 years\\u00a0was found in the 1980s at a site not too far away in Poland.\", \"\\\"Ornaments are cool, but if you've got a 41,000-year-old piece of an ivory boomerang, that's more interesting, especially if they are repairing the object the same way they do here,\\\" Dr Langley said.\", \"It is an interesting idea, said Professor Talamo, who's\\u00a0also in charge of studying the ivory boomerang found at the other site.\", \"\\\"I simply do not know;\\u00a0it could be, why not?
