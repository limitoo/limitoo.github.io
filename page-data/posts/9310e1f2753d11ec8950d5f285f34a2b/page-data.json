Around 20 elephants have died over the last eight years after consuming plastic trash in the dump in Pallakkadu village in Ampara district, about 130 miles east of the capital, Colombo.\", \"Examinations of the dead animals showed they had swallowed large amounts of nondegradable plastic that is found in the garbage dump, wildlife veterinarian Nihal Pushpakumara said.\", \"\\\"Polythene, food wrappers, plastic, other non-digestibles and water were the only things we could see in the post mortems. The normal food that elephants eat and digest was not evident,\\\" he said.\", \"In 2020, drone footage captured more than a dozen hungry elephants scouring for food in the landfill.\", \"Drone footage captured more than a dozen hungry elephants scouring for food in a landfill in eastern Sri Lanka. Along with food scraps, the elephants were eating plastic which is slowly killing them, local officials said https://cbsn.ws/37bSHhv\", \"Elephants are revered in Sri Lanka but are also endangered. Their numbers have dwindled from about 14,000 in the 19th century to 6,000 in 2011, according to the country's first elephant census.\", \"They are increasingly vulnerable because of the loss and degradation of their natural habitat. Many venture closer to human settlements in search of food, and some are killed by poachers or farmers angry over damage to their crops.\", \"According to the World Wildlife Fund, \\\"the Sri Lanka elephant is protected under the Sri Lankan law and killing one carries the death penalty.\\\"\", \"Hungry elephants seek out the waste in the landfill, consuming plastic as well as sharp objects that damage their digestive systems, Pushpakumara said.\", \"\\\"The elephants then stop eating and become too weak to keep their heavy frames upright. When that happens, they can't consume food or water, which quickens their death,\\\" he said.\", \"In 2017, the government announced that it will recycle the garbage in dumps near wildlife zones to prevent elephants from consuming plastic waste. It also said electric fences would be erected around the sites to keep the animals away. But neither has been fully implemented.\", \"There are 54 waste dumps in wildlife zones around the country, with around 300 elephants roaming near them, according to officials.\", \"The waste management site in Pallakkadu village was set up in 2008 with aid from the European Union. Garbage collected from nine nearby villages is being dumped there but is not being recycled.\", \"In 2014, the electric fence protecting the site was struck by lightning and authorities never repaired it, allowing elephants to enter and rummage through the dump. Residents say elephants have moved closer and settled near the waste pit, sparking fear among nearby villagers.\", \"Many use firecrackers to chase the animals away when they wander into the village, and some have erected electric fences around their homes.\", \"But the villagers often don't know how to install the electric fences so they are safe and \\\"could endanger their own lives as well as those of the elephants,\\\" said Keerthi Ranasinghe, a local village councilor.\", \"\\\"Even though we call them a menace, wild elephants are also a resource. Authorities need to come up with a way to protect both human lives and the elephants that also allows us to continue our agricultural activities,\\\" he said.\", \"Last year, an elephant gave birth to male twins for the first time in nearly 80 years in Sri Lanka.\", \"An elephant gave birth to male twins on Tuesday for the first time in nearly 80 years in Sri Lanka. pic.twitter.com/BFRX0TwxB8\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"9310e1f2753d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9310e1f2753d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
