Then, the Arizona Cardinals and Los Angeles Rams, two of the five N.F.C. teams jostling for home-field advantage in the playoffs will headline Monday night\\u2019s matchup.\", \"Below is a look at N.F.L. Week 14, with all picks made against the spread.\", \"Byes: Colts, Dolphins, Eagles, Patriots\", \"All times are Eastern.\", \"Last Week\\u2019s record: 9-5\", \"Pittsburgh Steelers at Minnesota Vikings, 8:20 p.m., Fox and NFL Network\", \"Line: Vikings -3 | Total: 44.5\", \"It took a fourth-quarter rally \\u2014 and the Ravens just failing to convert a 2-point conversion attempt \\u2014 to keep the Steelers (6-5-1) in the playoff hunt last week, their chances of reaching the postseason bounced to 20 percent, according to the playoff predictor. Every remaining game of what could be Ben Roethlisberger\\u2019s final season is essentially a must-win.\", \"Against the Vikings (5-7), who now bear the Scarlet Letter of losing to the Detroit Lions, Pittsburgh has a good chance. Adam Thielen, the team\\u2019s second leading receiver, was ruled out on Wednesday with an injured ankle and running back Dalvin Cook (shoulder) was listed as questionable to play. With the Pro Bowl receiver Justin Jefferson left to carry the Vikings\\u2019 offense, the Steelers should be able to get a road win. Pick: Steelers +3\", \"Buffalo Bills at Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 4:25 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Buccaneers -3 | Total: 52\", \"Expect the Bills (7-5) to play motivated. While it won\\u2019t be as cold as last week\\u2019s game in Western New York, Sunday\\u2019s forecasts call for windy and rainy weather in Tampa, Fla., where the Buccaneers (9-3) will certainly pass more than the Patriots did. Tom Brady leads the league in yards (3,771) and touchdowns (34), and should test the Bills\\u2019 top-ranked passing defense, which has allowed only 1,983 yards.\", \"Despite the absence of the top cornerback Tre\\u2019Davious White and potentially playing without linebacker A.J. Klein (Covid-19), Buffalo should get back on track, or at least keep the score close. Pick: Bills +3\", \"Baltimore Ravens at Cleveland Browns, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Browns -2.5 | Total: 42.5\", \"A bye last week should mean Baker Mayfield will return rested, if not completely healed, of the shoulder and foot injuries that diminished his recent performances. An emphasis on the passing attack for the Browns (6-6) could exploit the Ravens (8-4), who lost for the season their third member of the secondary, cornerback Marlon Humphrey (torn pectoral muscle).\", \"Lamar Jackson threw four interceptions against Cleveland two weeks ago, but the Ravens still won because the Browns wasted possessions and rushed for only 40 yards. If Baltimore\\u2019s front seven can again hinder the Browns\\u2019 running and play-action passing, the hallmarks of the offense, Mayfield will have fewer opportunities to play where he\\u2019s comfortable. Pick: Ravens +2.5\", \"Dallas Cowboys at Washington Football Team, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Cowboys -4 | Total: 43\", \"Washington (6-6) has slowly crept into the playoff conversation, with three N.F.C. East teams in as of Thursday morning. A win against the Cowboys (8-4) could further shake the division race as January approaches. Washington has won four consecutive games, a stretch in which Taylor Heinicke has completed over 70 percent of his passes. The Footballers\\u2019 defense has also not allowed more than 100 rushing yards in three of those four games.\", \"The Cowboys\\u2019 offense has underperformed in recent weeks largely because of questionable play-calling and a failure to run the ball well (Dallas had fewer than 100 rushing yards in two of the last three games). If they can revert to their prolific running in the first half of the season and if the defense, led by Micah Parsons and Trevon Diggs, continues to create turnovers, the Cowboys should win. Pick: Cowboys -4\", \"Las Vegas Raiders at Kansas City, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Kansas City -9.5 | Total: 49\", \"After thoroughly dispatching the Broncos, Kansas City (8-4) could increase its distance from the rest of the A.F.C. West by beating the Raiders (6-6), who currently have a 14 percent chance of reaching the postseason, according to the playoff predictor.\", \"Kansas City\\u2019s defense has improved after a slow start to the season and has held each of its last five opponents \\u2014 including the Raiders in Week 10 \\u2014 to under 20 points. Meanwhile, the offense seems to have adjusted to feasting on sure gains since opponents have limited Patrick Mahomes\\u2019s downfield strikes. Kansas City is clearly the better team and should easily dole Las Vegas its fifth loss in six games. Pick: Kansas City -9.5\", \"San Francisco 49ers at Cincinnati Bengals, 4:25 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: 49ers -1 | Total: 47.5\", \"Both the 49ers (6-6) and the Bengals (7-5) lost key games last week just as they were gaining momentum ahead of the playoffs. Cincinnati quarterback Joe Burrow dislocated the pinkie finger on his throwing hand against the Chargers, but played through the injury and should not miss any time. It\\u2019s unclear, though, how that will affect his performance going forward.\", \"For San Francisco, cornerback Emmanuel Moseley is questionable with a high ankle sprain and running back Elijah Mitchel is in the concussion protocol. It\\u2019s also unknown whether receiver Deebo Samuel (groin) and linebacker Fred Warner (hamstring), two of the team\\u2019s top four players, will return after missing last week. This game should be competitive, but the Bengals should win at home against a 49ers team contending with injuries. Pick: Bengals +1\", \"Jacksonville Jaguars at Tennessee Titans, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Titans -10 | Total: 45.5\", \"It seems like the Jaguars (2-10) are the league\\u2019s universal \\u201cget-right\\u201d opponent. A week after taking a beatdown from the Rams, Jacksonville must play the Titans (8-4), who lost back-to-back games before their bye. Tennessee designated receiver Julio Jones to return from injured reserve, which should help the team\\u2019s passing attack operate without A.J. Brown, who is still recovering from a chest injury. The Titans\\u2019 replacement cast of running backs has also shown it can operate respectfully while Derrick Henry rehabs his foot injury. Jacksonville\\u2019s recent performances offer no reason to think that taking the over makes sense. Pick: Titans -10\", \"New Orleans Saints at Jets, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Saints -6 | Total: 43.5\", \"Taysom Hill is expected to start again at quarterback for the Saints (5-7) and play through a finger injury. New Orleans is also hopeful to return running back Alvin Kamara, who has missed four games with a knee injury. If Hill can reduce his turnovers (he threw four interceptions against the Cowboys), the Saints should beat the Jets (3-9), who lost Corey Davis, the team\\u2019s second-leading receiver, to season-ending core muscle surgery. A loss to the Jets, though, would be unacceptable for New Orleans. Pick: Saints -6\", \"Atlanta Falcons at Carolina Panthers, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Panthers -3 | Total: 43.5\", \"After starting 3-0, the Panthers (5-7) have struggled offensively, ranking 24th in points scored per game (19.7) and 29th in yards per game (308.7). That is unlikely to improve as their best weapon, running back Christian McCaffrey, was placed on injured reserve with an ankle injury.\", \"The inefficiency caused Coach Matt Rhule to fire offensive coordinator Joe Brady, who was viewed last off-season as a blossoming head coach candidate. Despite the Panthers\\u2019 offensive troubles, Carolina\\u2019s defense, which ranks second in fewest yards allowed, should be able to contain the Falcons (5-7), whose offense relies on just three players \\u2014 receiver Cordarrelle Patterson, tight end Kyle Pitts and quarterback Matt Ryan. Neither of these teams are likely to make the postseason, but in an N.F.C. South rivalry, Carolina should have bragging rights after this one. Pick: Panthers -3\", \"Seattle Seahawks at Houston Texans, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Seahawks -7.5 | Total: 42.5\", \"Why would you watch this game, let alone bet on it?\", \"The Seahawks (4-8) have drastically underwhelmed this season and have become one of the worst teams in the league on offense and defense. The Texans (2-10) have been as bad as predicted. Houston\\u2019s journeyman quarterback, Tyrod Taylor, was benched for the rookie Davis Mills in a blowout loss to the Colts, and Coach David Culley said he will \\u201cevaluate everything\\u201d regarding which passer starts for the remainder of the season.\", \"The Seahawks, meanwhile, signed the future Hall of Fame running back Adrian Peterson to revive a pedestrian rushing attack, and are motivated to finish the season strong. It\\u2019s tempting to take the over, but Houston\\u2019s holistic performances have been so poor that Seattle, despite its many offensive deficiencies, should cover. Pick: Seahawks -7.5\", \"Detroit Lions at Denver Broncos, 4:05 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Broncos -8 | Total: 42\", \"The Broncos (6-6) are a quarterback away from truly contending. Teddy Bridgewater can lead the team under ideal circumstances, but in less perfect scenarios his mediocre play is wasting a talented crop of skill-position players and a respectable defense. The Lions (1-10-1), finally won a game last week after having been on the verge of other victories that they squandered with untimely turnovers, bad luck and inexcusable coaching decisions. Detroit has played competitively against teams that are better than Denver, which makes the Lions a safe bet to keep the score within the spread. Pick: Lions +8\", \"Giants at Los Angeles Chargers, 4:05 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Chargers -10 | Total: 45.5\", \"Justin Herbert may be without his top two receivers, Keenan Allen and Mike Williams, because the Chargers (7-5) placed them on the Covid-19 list. The Giants (4-8) may also be short-handed as quarterback Daniel Jones is likely to sit for a second consecutive game with a neck injury. It is unclear whether Mike Glennon, who is in the concussion protocol, or Jake Fromm, whom the Giants recently signed, will start. Regardless, Los Angeles\\u2019s defense ranks seventh in fewest passing yards allowed per game (209.5) and should be excited to face either quarterback. Pick: Chargers -10\", \"Chicago Bears at Green Bay Packers, 8:20 p.m., NBC\", \"Line: Packers -12.5 | Total: 44\", \"The N.F.L. flexed last week\\u2019s Sunday night game and would be wise to do so again. Even with the storied rivalry between the Packers (9-3) and the Bears (4-8), this iteration is unappealing. Chicago\\u2019s offense is putrid, scoring the third-fewest points per game (16.8) and ranking 30th in yards per game (298.8). They\\u2019ll be outmatched by the Packers, one of the best teams in the league, who could realistically put the game out of reach by halftime. Temperature at kickoff is expected to hover near freezing, but with little chance of snow and no wind expected, there won\\u2019t be any impediment to Green Bay\\u2019s onslaught, regardless if Andy Dalton starts at quarterback or if Justin Fields (ribs) returns from injury. Pick: Packers -12.5\", \"Los Angeles Rams at Arizona Cardinals, 8:15 p.m., ESPN\", \"Line: Cardinals -2.5 | Total: 52\", \"In their Week 4 meeting, the Cardinals (10-2) unknowingly offered the rest of the league an early blueprint to beat the Rams (8-4): Arizona rushed for over 200 yards, forced two turnovers, including an interception, and schemed its offense away from Aaron Donald and Jalen Ramsey. In later weeks San Francisco, Tennessee and Green Bay mimicked that strategy, and the Rams\\u2019 new additions, receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and the pass rusher Von Miller, have not been able to change the outcome, putting Los Angeles in jeopardy of a fourth prime-time embarrassment in six weeks.\", \"Arizona has shown few weaknesses and looked re-energized with Kyler Murray and DeAndre Hopkins back last week after each missed multiple games. The Rams\\u2019 recent performances against strong competition makes them a risky bet, especially on the road. Pick: Cardinals -2.5\", \"A quick primer for those who are not familiar with betting lines: Favorites are listed next to a negative number that represents how many points they must win by to cover the spread. Raiders -5.5, for example, means that Las Vegas must beat Chicago by at least 6 points for its backers to win their bet. Gamblers can also bet on the total score, or whether the teams\\u2019 combined score in the game is over or under a preselected number of points.\"]","href_hash":"e6b7d81a58af11eca063e73eaf707b7e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e6b7d81a58af11eca063e73eaf707b7e"}},
