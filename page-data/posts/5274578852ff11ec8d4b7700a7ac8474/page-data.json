A paleoanthropologist\\u2019s suggestion that they could have been bear tracks only diminished interest in the discovery, and the prints had largely been forgotten by archaeologists until now.\", \"But a study based on a new analysis of those prints, published in the journal Nature on Wednesday, indicates that they were made by an unidentified hominin, or early human. The findings suggest that Lucy\\u2019s species, Australopithecus afarensis, was not the only hominin walking the earth 3.6 million years ago.\", \"\\u201cUpright walking is a defining characteristic of our lineage,\\u201d said Jeremy DeSilva, an associate professor of anthropology at Dartmouth and a senior author of the study. \\u201cIt is a hallmark of being humans. Despite that, our understanding of the origins and evolution of bipedal locomotion is still something we\\u2019re trying to figure out.\\u201d\", \"Ellison McNutt, an assistant professor at the Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine at Ohio University and the lead author of the study, was seeking a better understanding of the postures that preceded bipedalism. Through her research into bears and their movements, she came across the set of five footprints that had been partially excavated in 1976 and thought they could help untangle the mystery of what led humans to walk on two legs.\", \"The prints, known as the A trail, were an unusual shape, like a shorter and more stout version of a modern human\\u2019s footprint. They showed a cross-step walking movement \\u2014 not unlike a model on a catwalk \\u2014 in which each foot crosses the body\\u2019s midline to touch down in front of the other.\", \"The researchers said that the prints\\u2019 ratio of foot width to length indicated that they had been made by a different species than Lucy\\u2019s, one that did not share an evolutionary trajectory with chimpanzees. The foot is wider than that of a typical early human, the researchers said, and the cross-walk pattern that the prints show can happen only if a species walks on two legs, with the aid of the hips.\", \"The researchers recorded almost 60 hours video of wild American black bears. Unsupported bipedal posture and movement occurred only 0.09 percent of the time, they said. Only once did a bear take four unassisted bipedal steps, according to the study. The archaeologists concluded that this \\u201cmakes it unlikely\\u201d that the fossilized prints belonged to a bear.\", \"Having more than one hominin species living during the same time period, walking a little differently with different foot sizes, \\u201ctells us that there wasn\\u2019t sort of a one-track way to our evolution,\\u201d Dr. McNutt said. \\u201cAnd it just turns out the kind of way that we do is the only one that still survives today.\\u201d\", \"The study comes as more research is challenging and changing the understanding of how many early human species occupied the earth three million to 3.7 million years ago, during what is known as the Pliocene Epoch, said Stephanie M. Melillo, a paleoanthropologist with the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. Dr. Melillo was not a part of the study, but summarized its findings for Nature.\", \"William Harcourt-Smith, an associate professor of anthropology at Lehman College and a resident research associate at the American Museum of Natural History, said that both sets of footprints could have been made within days of each other.\", \"\\u201cWhat\\u2019s news about this particular finding is that these are footprints made in almost exactly the same time,\\u201d said Dr. Harcourt-Smith, who was not involved with the study.\", \"\\u201cThis is this is the real deal,\\u201d he added. \\u201cIt is the smoking gun of two different fossil hominins at the same time in the same landscape, if they are indeed both hominins.\\u201d\", \"But Tim D. White, a paleoanthropologist and a professor of integrative biology at the University of California, Berkeley, was skeptical, saying that it was \\u201ca step too far\\u201d to conclude that a new hominin species had been identified.\", \"Dr. White, who was present at the excavations of both sets of footprints in Laetoli, said that the differences between them were minimal, and not enough to definitively indicate the existence of another bipedal species. When footprints are made in volcanic ash, as these were, the prints at their deeper layers can become deflected, flatter or broader, changing their size and shape, he said.\", \"The experts did agree that the new research disproves the original hypothesis that the A trail prints had been made by bears. There are no bears in the fossil record at Laetoli, Dr. White said.\", \"The researchers said they planned to continue to excavate the site in search of more footprints.\"]","href_hash":"5274578852ff11ec8d4b7700a7ac8474"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5274578852ff11ec8d4b7700a7ac8474"}},
