I remember sitting in the waiting area with my mum, feeling nervous.\\\"\", \"She says she remembers vividly having to lie on a cold table as a female doctor examined her.\", \"Ms Dembele says that it was \\\"either on this day or soon after, my mum's worst fear was confirmed\\\"\\u00a0\\u2014 that she had been raped.\", \"Ms Dembele says her mother is the hero of her story, but she recalls the judgement she felt against her mother, and herself.\", \"\\\"I remember feeling like I wanted to protect my mum from their judgement. My mother was fighting against so many barriers, internal and external, trying to act in my best interest and still she was judged.\\\"\", \"This is part of a statement Ms Dembele has shared online to help remove the burden of violence and shame from victims.\", \"Part of sharing her story, Ms Dembele says\\u00a0is to demonstrate how suburban and mundane the settings can be when these kinds of life-changing traumas occur.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Sixteen\\u00a0days of activism</div>\", \"Ms Dembele is now a survivor advocate and one of the voices for a new campaign against gender-based violence and the need for trauma to be treated as an injury.\", \"\\\"Trauma is a physiological response that happens when we have a high-threat environment like in war zones,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"And that is what is happening to women and children's bodies when they are exposed to constant abuse and violence in the home, and we need it recognised as an injury through our health system and though our justice system.\\\"\", \"The 16 days of activism launching today\\u00a0with Domestic Violence NSW, the Illawarra Women's Health Centre, and\\u00a0Doctors Against Violence Towards Women involves eight community leaders alongside eight victim survivor advocates.\", \"The group wants trauma from gender-based violence recognised as an injury in the same way it is for first responders and soldiers.\", \"The campaign is calling for victim survivors to have access to a range of trauma-specific, evidence-based therapies through the Medicare Benefits Schedule.\", \"It also wants 20 community-based Women's Trauma Recovery Centres to be established across Australia and ensuring mandatory trauma and gendered violence education and training programs for all health and justice workers.\", \"It is based on an open letter from more\\u00a0than 100 health and education experts released in September calling on the federal government to adopt\\u00a0nine actions in response to\\u00a0domestic and family violence.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/6d7badfad05a71f8e63f8d2630994f47\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">

Doctors Against Violence Towards Women\\u00a0Karen Williams said she hoped\\u00a0the campaign would highlight\\u00a0that violence in the family against women and children was another form of post-traumatic stress disorder.\", \"She said recognising trauma care through the Medicare Benefits Schedule was essential.\", \"\\\"You are really looking at a complete overhaul of the way we look at trauma,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"We need to recognise that it is a mental health condition that sometimes does require in-patient care, or intensive psychological care, just like PTSD in a soldier.\\\"\", \"Dr Williams said victims often felt the health and justice systems did not recognise the impact the violence had upon them.\", \"\\\"A lot of times women who have been traumatised by violence may forget incidents\\u00a0and may present as shaky, may miss certain details, and that will be used against them,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"If the judicial system was trauma-informed, it may understand why women present in a particular way on the stand and not dismiss their testimony.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Bipartisan support for trauma recovery centre</div>\", \"In April, a federal bipartisan report into family and domestic violence urged the Morrison government to provide funding for a proposed Women's Trauma Recovery Centre in the Illawarra.\", \"At the time, the inquiry chair and Queensland Liberal and National MP, Andrew Wallace,\\u00a0said it was too late to be included in the May federal budget, but could be included in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in December.\", \"\\\"The committee felt that this was a stand-out approach to try and deal with the scourge of family, domestic, and sexual violence,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"And if it is successful the committee has recommended funding for a five-year pilot program and if that is successful we think it is something that should get rolled out across the country.\\\"\", \"<div
