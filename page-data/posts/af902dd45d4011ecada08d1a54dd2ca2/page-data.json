The game between his team, Marseille, and the host, Lyon, was young and still formless. There had been no goals. There had barely been time for a chance. Everybody, fans and players alike, was still settling in.\", \"In the stands above him, Wilfried Serriere, 32, a food delivery driver, looked down and saw a half-liter bottle of water at his feet. It was full. Payet was placing the ball for a corner. His back was turned. In images captured by the stadium\\u2019s security cameras and later played in a courtroom, Serriere can be seen picking up the bottle, lowering his hood, and throwing it.\", \"A beat later, Payet fell to the grass, clutching his face. The bottle had caught him flush on the cheek.\", \"Payet\\u2019s teammates rushed to his aid. Anthony Lopes, Lyon\\u2019s goalkeeper, gestured at his own fans, pleading for calm. Later, Serriere told a court that he did \\u201cnot know what went on in my head: euphoria, I don\\u2019t know.\\u201d He accepted he had thrown the bottle that struck Payet, but he could not explain why.\", \"The rest of France has spent the opening months of the soccer season asking itself the same question. A wave of violence has washed over Ligue 1, the country\\u2019s top division, since fans returned to its stadiums in August after a yearlong absence caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\", \"Two games, both involving Marseille, have been suspended \\u2014 and eventually postponed \\u2014 after Payet was struck by an object thrown from the stands. In Lyon, the players were taken off the field quickly. In the previous incident, at Nice, there was an angry confrontation on the field between Marseille\\u2019s players and hundreds of opposition fans. That confrontation also had consequences: A Nice fan was given a 12-month suspended sentence for kicking Payet, and a Marseille coach was barred for the rest of the season for punching a field invader.\", \"Those, though, were only the two most high-profile incidents. Fans have invaded the field during games at Lens and Angers. There have been pitched battles between rival groups of ultras before and after games in several cities. Missiles have been thrown at Montpellier and Metz and the Parc des Princes, home of Paris St.-Germain.\", \"In all, nine games in Ligue 1 have been afflicted this season by what the newspaper Dauphin\\u00e9 Lib\\u00e9r\\u00e9 has described as an \\u201cepidemic\\u201d of violence, one so rampant that France\\u2019s soccer authorities have come to regard it as an existential threat. Vincent Labrune, the president of the French league, has called it nothing less than \\u201ca question of survival for our sport.\\u201d\", \"If that sounds hyperbolic, it is at least rooted in realism. There is a fear the violence could have financial ramifications; Roxana Maracineanu, the country\\u2019s sports minister, has said French soccer cannot \\u201ccollectively afford\\u201d to fail to deliver the content the league\\u2019s broadcasters have paid for. But there is also concern that it could make France an inhospitable place for players to work, too.\", \"At Serriere\\u2019s sentencing, Axel Daurat, a lawyer representing Payet and Marseille, testified that the player had suffered \\u201csignificant\\u201d psychological impact as a result of being attacked twice in three months. \\u201cThe fear will be there every time he puts the ball down for a corner,\\u201d Daurat said.\", \"But while the potential consequences are clear, there has been less progress on the causes. Labrune has suggested that the increase in disorder is best read as a reflection of the state of post-pandemic French society: \\u201cAnxious, worried, fractured, argumentative and \\u2014 I have to say \\u2014 a little crazy.\\u201d\", \"And yet that explanation does not quite withstand scrutiny. France is hardly alone in feeling a certain civic fractiousness as it emerges, haltingly and uncertainly, into an uncomfortable new reality. Most of Europe\\u2019s other major leagues, greeting that same reality, have not seen anything like the upsurge in violence Ligue 1 has faced.\", \"\\u201cIt feels a little bit like cod psychology to say that it is to do with a tension in society manifesting in the stadium,\\u201d said Ronan Evain, the executive director of Football Supporters Europe. More likely, he said, is that the violence illustrates a structural, institutional failing.\", \"\\u201cIt is like the clubs have lost a little bit of expertise,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIn the incident between Lens and Lille, there was no buffer zone between the home and away fans. I have not seen that at a game in 20 years, maybe more. The clubs put a lot of emphasis on the Covid protocols for returning to the stadiums. Perhaps there was not enough focus on security.\\u201d\", \"Evain argued that may be connected to the loss of experienced stewards and security staff members during the pandemic, and he drew a parallel between the French experience and the scenes at Wembley Stadium in London in July, when thousands of ticketless fans stormed the gates when England played Italy in the Euro 2020 final. A sharply critical report this month documented how policing failures had left stadium security employees in an impossible \\u2014 and potentially deadly \\u2014 situation that day. \\u201cYou cannot ask someone who is underpaid, undertrained and in poor working conditions to risk their health to stop someone going on the field,\\u201d Evain said.\", \"Nicolas Hourcade, a sociologist at the \\u00c9cole Centrale de Lyon who specializes in fan movements, suggested that lack of expertise has been compounded by the financial difficulties faced by French teams. France, alone among Europe\\u2019s major leagues, chose not to conclude its pandemic-interrupted 2019-20 season, and its teams are still reeling from the subsequent collapse of the league\\u2019s broadcast deal.\", \"\\u201cIt is possible the clubs did not invest enough in security,\\u201d he said, \\u201cwhich would explain why the measures were sometimes insufficient.\\u201d\", \"But while that provides a possible explanation for why French soccer has provided such fertile ground for the violence, it does not offer insight into the root of it. Maracineanu, the sports minister, has laid blame at the door of France\\u2019s ultra groups, urging their leaders to \\u201ccontrol your troops.\\u201d But it is not quite so simple.\", \"At Serriere\\u2019s hearing, it emerged that he had been a Lyon fan for 15 years \\u2014 though news reports noted he attended court in a Bayern Munich jersey \\u2014 but was not a member of any organized group. He was not, in other words, an ultra.\", \"\\u201cThere have been incidents involving ultra groups,\\u201d said Pierre Barth\\u00e9lemy, a lawyer who has acted on behalf of the ultra movement. He cited two, specifically, including the field invasion at Lens, which he said had been triggered by the presence of \\u201cBelgian hooligans\\u201d among the visiting Lille fans, and an incident at a game in Montpellier that the ultras were boycotting.\", \"\\u201cWhen the game was suspended at Nice, it was because the authorities had let people throw missiles on the field for 40 or 50 minutes,\\u201d Barth\\u00e9lemy said. \\u201cThese are not organized incidents. They are spontaneous, and most are not coming from the ultras.\\u201d\", \"That, however, only makes them harder to police. France has some of the most draconian punishments for crowd disorder in Europe, Evain said, including the ability to close grandstands or even entire stadiums.\", \"He fears the current outbreak will be met by a \\u201cpopulist\\u201d response: increased calls for monitoring of fans in stadiums, and the greeting of any incident, even an individual action, with a collective punishment. At least one club owner has confided privately that he would agree to play behind closed doors if the issues continued.\", \"But perhaps more significant, the atomized nature of the incidents in France makes them harder to understand. \\u201cViolence caused by ultras and incidents caused by other fans are not related,\\u201d said Hourcade, the sociologist.\", \"Violence may be an organizational failure, he said. Or perhaps long-running grievances between ultra groups are resurfacing after lying dormant during the pandemic.\", \"But threading through it all is the sense that the stadium has become a place where lines can be crossed and taboos broken, and 3:54 into a game, when the trill of the whistle has barely faded and the game has barely begun, a fan can look at a bottle and, without ever knowing why, pick it up and hurl it at a player, and land another blow on the image French soccer presents to the world.\"]","href_hash":"af902dd45d4011ecada08d1a54dd2ca2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"af902dd45d4011ecada08d1a54dd2ca2"}},
