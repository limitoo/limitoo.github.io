A grown-up novel may make all its points with action and emotion, but some underlying force of fable or allegory, of educational purpose, seems necessary to illuminate a permanent book for younger readers. \\u201cMary Poppins\\u201d and \\u201cCharlotte\\u2019s Web,\\u201d in addition to the stories they tell, have not merely a moral to impart but a view of life to offer \\u2014 in \\u201cMary,\\u201d that the strictest and most severe people often have the most passionate connection to life\\u2019s mysteries; in \\u201cCharlotte,\\u201d a still deeper one, that death is as much a starting point as it is an end.\", \"But few classics for young readers are as entirely philosophical and contemplative, as engineered to instruct, as Genzaburo Yoshino\\u2019s \\u201cHow Do You Live?\\u201d Apparently nearly compulsory reading in Japan \\u2014 one Japanese reader assures me that every summer list for 13-year-olds includes it \\u2014 it has sold more than two million copies there since its original publication in 1937 (the same year in which the novel is set), but it is only now appearing for the first time in an English translation. (The ostensible reason for the new edition is that the book is to be the basis for a final film by the great animator Hayao Miyazaki.)\", \"In his foreword, Neil Gaiman gently prepares readers \\u2014 against expectations that his patronage might create, given his own vivid, kinetic style \\u2014 for any disappointment they may feel with this book. Had he been given it to read as a boy, he admits, \\u201cI suspect I would have found it puzzling or even dull.\\u201d Indeed, where most classics aimed at the younger mind have some pleasurable lake of cool stuff on which to float the oil of philosophy, this one is nearly all philosophy \\u2014 and a fairly dense and demanding kind, centered on what we would now call the philosophy of science, with excursions into modern economic theory, French military history and the dissemination of Hellenistic style in Indian sculpture. These mini-treatises, absorbing on their own terms and written in a tone of sweetly patient explanation, are not exactly what a mind shaped by horcruxes and lightning thieves expects to find thrilling.\", \"Yet in another way, nothing is more engrossing than the story of an education shared, the true subject of this book. The premise, or pivot, that justifies the philosophizing is a series of exchanges between a young boy, appealingly named Copper, and his thoughtful uncle, who lives in the same Tokyo suburb to which Copper and his harried mother moved after his father died two years earlier. Copper goes to school in the center of the city, and one of the not-incidental pleasures of the book is its evocation of Tokyo in the 1930s, as in this view from the roof of a department store: \\u201cThe trolleys looked as small as toys, and their roofs were slick with rain. The cars, too, and the asphalt road surface and even the trees lining the road and all else that was there were dripping wet and gleaming with the brightness of daylight shining from who knew where.\\u201d\", \"Copper, we learn, has earned his nickname not from a metal or a color but from the Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus, whose courage in insisting on the heliocentric model of the solar system has become the boy\\u2019s benchmark. (It isn\\u2019t clear if \\u201cCopper\\u201d has the punning presence in Japanese that it does in English.) This lesson is one supplied by his uncle, whose letters of instruction on many subjects take up at least a third of the book, and act as a kind of counterpoint to the more mundane though neatly described escapades of Copper at his school. As he reports back to his uncle on these hyper-normal events \\u2014 friendships made, teachers defied, bullies avoided \\u2014 his uncle digs deep into an apparently bottomless bag of erudition and finds apropos examples for his nephew to consider as his adolescence unfolds. These include the difference between the interests of consumers and producers; molecular and atomic theory; the question of whether Napoleon Bonaparte\\u2019s heroism justified his sacrifice of French soldiers in Russia; and the dispute about the reality of Isaac Newton\\u2019s falling apple.\", \"This all sounds \\u2026 odd, not to say potentially tiresome. And it is odd, but tiresome it isn\\u2019t, chiefly because Yoshino has given the instruction a touching emotional root. On his deathbed, we learn, Copper\\u2019s father asked his wife\\u2019s younger brother to make sure his son became \\u201ca great man,\\u201d with a definition of greatness that was humble and startling: He wanted his son to be \\u201ca fine example of a human being.\\u201d And so his uncle\\u2019s philosophizing, far from being random, is designed to instruct the boy in the values of life. When Copper contemplates molecular theory, he is learning to see himself as an interchangeable part of a larger stream of life, to dislocate his own egotism, but the lessons in global economics that come soon after also teach that each molecule depends on all the others. We are nothing; we are everything.\", \"One is put in mind, at times, of Antoine de Saint-Exup\\u00e9ry, writing \\u201cThe Little Prince,\\u201d and also, in a desperate time of war, using children\\u2019s literature to instruct readers in the necessity of pluralism and a dislocated love of others. Much of the content of \\u201cHow Do You Live?,\\u201d a Western reader suspects, is in a similar way cagily related to the politics, and indeed the desperation, of a left-wing humanist responding to the tragic rise of militarized imperialism in Japan in the years immediately before World War II. (Yoshino was long a professor at Meiji University, and was imprisoned before the war as a leftist. The economic passages here bear the imprint of his Marxism, helpfully hybridized with Buddhist temperance and a love of Western science.)\", \"Two things are apparent in Yoshino\\u2019s tale: how complete the \\u201cWesternization\\u201d of Japan was by 1937 and how complete it wasn\\u2019t. The comic highlight of the book involves a gaily improvised baseball \\u201cbroadcast\\u201d by Copper; but the extreme deference and courtesy that informs Copper\\u2019s exchanges with his uncle feels very removed from the world of Babe Ruth and Ring Lardner. Everyone in 1930s Japan, it seems, a little shockingly, is expected to know about Napoleon, but what they know is his dignity in defeat.\", \"The book concludes with a beautifully realized double climax that\\u2019s a remarkable twinning of its micro and macro worlds. In the schoolyard, Copper fails to come to the rescue of a friend who is being bullied by brutal older boys. Guilt-ridden, he is urged by his uncle to write a letter of apology, with no expectations of reward. The tone of the letter seems, to this reader, overly filled with shame, but it works to anneal the injury. Soon after, the uncle offers a disquisition on, of all seemingly abstruse subjects, the development of Greco-Buddhist art \\u2014 the \\u201cGandhara\\u201d style \\u2014 which even this not-entirely-art-ignorant reader knew little about. (It is worth Googling for a peek at the extraordinary work, in which Hercules stands beside the Buddha.) Copper\\u2019s uncle untangles the mystery of the style\\u2019s creation, showing how Greek artists brought east by Alexander the Great took up Buddhist subjects, which turned the physical affirmations of their own work more mystically inward. \\u201cAnd so, Copper,\\u201d his uncle says, \\u201cthe Buddhist art we know doesn\\u2019t arise from Buddhist ideas alone. Nor was it produced using Greek sculptural techniques alone. It\\u2019s something that was created by joining the two things together.\\u201d\", \"What begins as a seemingly abstract art-historical lecture becomes a moving, appropriately climactic plea \\u2014 never more relevant than today \\u2014 for hybrid humanism, for an understanding of the mixed and heterogenous nature of all human culture. Here again, one suspects that, in its time and place, this was not merely as moving as it remains, but also unusually courageous and dissident.\", \"At the very end of the book, the omniscient narrator suddenly turns to the reader and asks, in a final single-sentence paragraph, \\u201cHow will you live?\\u201d (The italics are mine, but the emphasis is implicit.) A hard book to assess via the blunt thumbs-up or thumbs-down rating system on which we\\u2019ve lazily come to depend, \\u201cHow Do You Live?\\u201d is nonetheless not easily forgotten. Many American 13-year-olds will doubtless find it \\u201cdull,\\u201d as Gaiman worries, with too little narrative action \\u2014 or action of any kind really. But some may feel, as this reader did upon closing it, inclined to affirm an unusual truth: \\u201cI am wiser for having read this book.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b65b502243d611ecb938b37873fd234c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b65b502243d611ecb938b37873fd234c"}},
