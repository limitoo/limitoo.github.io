Some Democrats are asking if he could be making better use of his White House pulpit.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-23T14:20:13.000Z","content":"[\"As president, Donald J. Trump was a media maximalist whose unavoidable-for-comment style helped generate saturation news coverage, for better or worse.\", \"President Biden has taken a stingier approach to his dealings with the press \\u2014 and not all his allies believe it\\u2019s working out.\", \"After nine months in office, Mr. Biden has conducted roughly a dozen one-on-one interviews with major print and television news outlets. That compares with more than 50 for Mr. Trump, and more than 100 for Barack Obama, in the same period, according to West Wing record keepers.\", \"If the pulpit is one of a president\\u2019s most powerful tools of communication, Mr. Biden has opted to rely more heavily on fleeting, impromptu exchanges with White House reporters, often taking a few shouted questions as he boards a helicopter or exits a photo-op. He has not sat for interviews with The Associated Press, The New York Times, Reuters, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal or USA Today. Even friendly venues like \\u201cLate Show with Stephen Colbert\\u201d have gone unvisited.\", \"It\\u2019s a Rose Garden strategy in decidedly un-rosy times. As Mr. Biden\\u2019s approval ratings have sagged in recent weeks, and his party confronts a tough outlook for next year\\u2019s midterm elections, some Democrats have asked if the president has yielded too much control of the public narrative of his administration to others.\", \"\\u201cWhat I believe in is sell, sell, sell,\\u201d James Carville, the veteran Democratic strategist, said in an interview. \\u201cWhat they\\u2019re missing is salesmanship. Everybody wants to be a policy maven, and no one wants to go door to door and sell pots and pans.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Carville expressed concern about a poll last month showing roughly 7 in 10 Americans knew \\u201cjust some or little to nothing\\u201d about the president\\u2019s signature domestic policy plans. The leader of the House Democrats\\u2019 campaign arm, Representative Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, recently criticized the White House for \\u201cnot getting the job done on messaging.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cFree Joe Biden,\\u201d Mr. Maloney said, urging the president \\u201cto get himself out there.\\u201d\", \"White House aides reject the idea that Mr. Biden is avoiding the spotlight. Jen Psaki, Mr. Biden\\u2019s press secretary, noted that on a day-to-day basis, the president has entertained informal questions from White House reporters more often than either Mr. Trump or Mr. Obama in their early tenures (although these exchanges, and his answers, tend to be brief).\", \"\\u201cTaking 30 questions from the national press in a week, or over the course of 10 days or two weeks, is an opportunity for the national press corps to ask him tough questions and do follow-ups,\\u201d Ms. Psaki said in an interview. \\u201cHe fully expects it and he engages in it.\\u201d\", \"And after months of negotiations in Congress leading up to passage of the newly signed public works bill, Ms. Psaki said the president was now \\u201cin the early stages of a massive selling plan across the country.\\u201d Last week, he visited a General Motors plant in Detroit, where he zipped around in an electric S.U.V. \\u2014 \\u201cThat Hummer is one hell of a vehicle, man,\\u201d the president remarked \\u2014 and toured a dilapidated bridge in Woodstock, N.H. On Monday, he presided over a pomp-filled signing ceremony on the White House lawn that was carried live on national TV.\", \"Whether these efforts are coming too late is an open question. One recent poll showed a declining number of Democrats with favorable views of Mr. Biden\\u2019s job performance. The president\\u2019s social safety net and climate bill passed the House, but now faces an arduous path in the Senate. The danger, journalists and media strategists say, is that Mr. Biden has allowed his opponents too much room to set the terms of debate.\", \"\\u201cThe first impression of these packages was framed already by the Republicans,\\u201d said Kurt Bardella, an adviser to the Democratic Party. \\u201cNow that we see more activity from the White House, they\\u2019re coming up against a narrative that was painted by other people, and it becomes a little bit more challenging to stem that tide.\\u201d\", \"Scott McClellan, who served as press secretary to former President George W. Bush, said that presidents \\u201ccan be overly cautious to your own detriment at times.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere are risks, and certainly Biden has a history of sometimes going off-script and off-the-cuff, and message discipline is really critical at a time like this,\\u201d Mr. McClellan said. \\u201cBut those high-profile interviews give you the opportunity to really get across key points that you want to make, that are important in building public support.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Psaki said concerns that Democrats have already lost the framing battle \\u201csounds awfully defeatist to me,\\u201d pointing to polls showing that the underlying policies of Mr. Biden\\u2019s legislative agenda remain broadly popular.\", \"Mr. Biden\\u2019s messaging team also prides itself on adapting the traditional White House media playbook to a new age of microscopic attention spans and 24/7 social media, where politicians are as likely to shape public perception with a TikTok video than a sit-down with a baritone-voiced news anchor. The Biden digital campaign has featured cameos from YouTube stars and celebrities like Olivia Rodrigo and Ciara. \\u201cWe want to meet people where they are in 2021,\\u201d Ms. Psaki said.\", \"Still, there are moments where Mr. Biden seems to have set aside some of the unique advantages of his office.\", \"Last week\\u2019s bill-signing ceremony at the White House began at 3 p.m., a contrast from Mr. Trump\\u2019s inclination to hold major events, like the naming of a Supreme Court nominee, in the evening to capture prime-time levels of viewership. Those events were criticized as reality-show-style stunts, but they usually proved effective in dictating the national news cycle.\", \"\\u201cEvery network would give him time if he asked for it,\\u201d Mr. Bardella said, speaking of Mr. Biden. \\u201cHe needs to use the trappings of the presidency.\\u201d\", \"The president has sat for a few major televised interviews with anchors from CBS, NBC, and ABC (twice). He also enjoys venues where he can answer questions from voters rather than reporters, appearing on three prime-time town halls on CNN. But his most recent CNN appearance, with Anderson Cooper in October, required some cleanup: His remarks suggesting muscular American support of Taiwan against a Chinese attack had to be clarified later by his press team.\", \"The viewership for the October town hall on CNN also left something to be desired \\u2014 a point in favor of the White House\\u2019s argument that traditional media simply matters less these days. The 90-minute event attracted fewer viewers than simultaneous programming on MSNBC, and Fox News\\u2019s hosts Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity were seen by more than double Mr. Biden\\u2019s audience that night.\", \"\\u201cI suspect that they are of the understandable view of, \\u2018What difference does it make?\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Carville said of the Biden team\\u2019s cautious approach. \\u201c\\u2018Why do I have to sit there and be interrogated for 20 minutes when all I can do is make a mistake, and I can\\u2019t move a Popsicle in terms of poll numbers?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"How a president meets the media is just as often determined by personality as politics.\", \"Mr. Obama was less enthused about facing gaggles of reporters, preferring one-on-ones where he could sidestep \\u201ctopic of the day\\u201d lightning rounds and delve into a subject of his choice. Mr. Trump relished his jousts with journalists, even as he vilified the news media in increasingly menacing ways.\", \"There is little doubt that Mr. Biden takes a brighter view than his predecessor of the news media and its role in the democratic process. Mr. Trump revoked White House press passes, labeled the media as the \\u201cenemy of the people\\u201d and increasingly restricted his appearances to Fox News opinion shows and other sympathetic stages. His administration also withheld press briefings for months on end. By contrast, Ms. Psaki holds extensive briefings nearly every day.\", \"Still, Mr. Biden \\u2014 who built his appeal on a colloquial, off-the-cuff style that leaves him vulnerable to gaffes \\u2014 has never been especially chatty with reporters. One of his key advisers, Anita Dunn, was opposed to Mr. Biden regularly opening himself up to queries, an exercise that Ms. Dunn believed offered little upside and lots of downside.\", \"Mr. Biden\\u2019s reluctant media habits set off a minor revolt from his press corps last week: After he broke precedent by skipping a news conference with the leaders of Canada and Mexico, the White House Correspondents\\u2019 Association formally complained. \\u201cIs the worry that you don\\u2019t want the president taking questions?\\u201d one reporter asked a Biden press aide. (Reply: \\u201cThe president often takes questions throughout the course of the day.\\u201d)\", \"\\u201cA calculation is made about the risk versus benefits of talking extemporaneously,\\u201d said Jonathan Lemire, the host of \\u201cWay Too Early\\u201d on MSNBC and Politico\\u2019s White House bureau chief. \\u201cBut you sacrifice part of the megaphone by not having the president do these interviews.\\u201d\", \"Mr. McClellan, of the Bush White House, cautioned that Mr. Biden\\u2019s advisers should work to avoid letting the perception of a disengaged Mr. Biden become ingrained in the public imagination.\", \"\\u201cThey may have been waiting until they\\u2019d gotten the legislation passed,\\u201d he said, referring to the infrastructure law. \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure, given where things are right now in his presidency and given the outcome of the November elections \\u2014 and looking ahead to where the midterms are trending \\u2014 that they can wait too much longer.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"57fa28b04c6811ec831219420a7066b2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"57fa28b04c6811ec831219420a7066b2"}},
