A 4ft maypole around which the deranged and the weak and the unemployable can dance and chant and make a nuisance of themselves.\\\"\", \"Clarkson continued to criticise the activist in his column saying if she truly wanted results she should go to countries where they are not as aware of climate change as others.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"So here's a tip, Greta: lecturing me on what needs to be done is pointless. It'd be like standing in my bedroom every morning ordering me to wear clothes.
