The pair soon uncovered a further 64 objects during their expedition, the BBC reported.\", \"The find from a field near Royston, Hertfordshire, is even more extraordinary as Milly had only just taken up her father's favorite hobby of metal detecting and hadn't quite learned the ropes.\", \"\\\"It was my third time out and I didn't quite know what I was doing,\\\" the budding young detectorist told the BBC. \\\"I got a signal and yelled at my dad and when he started digging he went 'this could be an axe,' and he was joking around about it.\\\"\", \"The father and daughter duo continued to unearth items, collecting a further 20 artifacts before the site had to be covered for archeologists to investigate the following day. The archeologists excavated the entire hoard of 65 objects which will be transferred to the British Museum in London.\", \"The British Museum says that the period of 1300 BC represents what is known as the Middle Bronze Age.\", \"The Bronze Age is generally believed to have begun in Britain when bronze tools and weapons were brought over from continental Europe in around 2000 BC.\", \"This made both bronze, comprised of 90 percent copper and 10 percent tin, and stone readily available as materials. The Ancient Sumerians in the Middle East were probably the first people to enter the Bronze Age and Crete is generally considered by historians to have been the center of the expansion of the bronze trade throughout Europe, BBC History says.\", \"The arrival of the Bell Beaker folk to Britain, bring with them the ability to smelt metal, likely signaled the beginning of the Bronze Age for this region of the globe. The period marks the adoption in Britain of Wessex Culture.\", \"This culture is characterized by the placement of grave goods such as stone battle axes, metal daggers with elaborately decorated hilts, and precious ornaments of gold and amber into round barrows. The practice has led to the discovery of some of the most beautiful and important prehistoric objects ever found in Britain.\", \"Milly's mother, Claire Hardwick, explained to Wales Online that other metal detectorists were pleased for the 13-year-old, who was even featured on the cover of the metal detecting magazine, The Searcher. \", \"The teenager said that if the find raised any money for her, she would split it with the landowner. Hardwick, who aims to become an archeologist, told the BBC that with her share of the money she would like to invest in a \\\"diggie tool\\\"\\u2014a small shovel used by detectorists to unearth their finds.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939580/carn-gloose-bronze-age-burial-chamber.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Carn Gloose Bronze Age Burial Chamber at St Just Cornwall.
