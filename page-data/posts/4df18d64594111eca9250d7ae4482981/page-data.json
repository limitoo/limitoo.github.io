The move clears the way for several million teenagers to receive an additional shot.\", \"The C.D.C. promptly endorsed the F.D.A.\\u2019s action. So far, the other two coronavirus vaccines, from Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, are only authorized for adults.\", \"The agency\\u2019s decision comes as a first batch of laboratory tests suggests that the Omicron variant seems to dull the effectiveness of two doses of the Pfizer vaccine.\", \"Pfizer said yesterday that tests with blood samples from people who had received only two doses showed much lower levels of virus-fighting antibodies against Omicron than against an earlier version of the virus. Antibodies are the immune system\\u2019s first line of defense against the virus, and the results suggest that two doses may not be sufficient to protect against infection.\", \"But with a booster, the level of antibodies working to neutralize the Omicron variant were comparable to those combating the original variant after two doses, the company said. \", \"Support for boosters has been growing among public health experts in the face of the Omicron variant. Data from both Israel and Britain has shown that an extra dose can sharply lower a person\\u2019s likelihood of catching the coronavirus and getting sick, leading many countries to expand their booster programs.\", \"But the W.H.O. cautioned about the risks that booster campaigns presented, as tens of millions of people in lower-income countries have not had access to a single dose.\", \"There is a risk that wealthy countries will go back to hoarding vaccine supplies to confront Omicron, said Dr. Kate O\\u2019Brien, the W.H.O.\\u2019s vaccine director. Currently, more boosters are being administered than first shots around the world.\", \"But Andrea Taylor, who tracks vaccine production for the Global Health Innovation Center at Duke University, said that while it was hard to know the true status of vaccine supply and delivery because of a lack of transparency, booster campaigns should not significantly affect supplies for lower-income countries.\", \"\\u201cGlobally, we are producing a staggering 1.5 billion doses a month, and we theoretically have enough doses now to provide boosters across wealthy countries, as well as first and second doses to at least 40 percent of the population in other countries,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIn reality, however, these doses are not where they need to be.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cToo many of them are sitting unused in wealthy countries,\\u201d she said, adding that estimates showed that the world\\u2019s wealthiest nations would have about 770 million excess doses on hand at the end of this month.\", \"An estimated 167,000 children have lost parents or caregivers to Covid-19. For every four Covid deaths in the U.S., it is estimated that one child is left without a caregiver, a loss that has more severely affected communities of color.\", \"While Congress has allocated trillions of dollars to combat the pandemic, the Biden administration and lawmakers haven\\u2019t yet created initiatives to help these children. But behind the scenes, as my colleague Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports, a bipartisan coalition of experts \\u2014 lead by two former governors \\u2014 have been meeting with White House officials, urging them to do more.\", \"That group, the Covid Collaborative, is asking President Biden to initiate a national campaign to identify these children and take steps to improve their emotional and economic well-being. In a report released today, the group recommended offering them mental health care and creating a \\u201cCovid-19 Bereaved Children\\u2019s Fund,\\u201d similar to a fund established after the Sept. 11 attacks, to provide up to $10,000 to families in need.\", \"The collaborative envisions $2 billion to $3 billion for the bereavement fund, possibly supplemented by money from private foundations. It would help parents struggling to make rent payments, boost their children\\u2019s academic performance and find the right therapy at a reasonable cost, among other things.\", \"Some parents whose spouses were frontline workers say they would like at least some recognition from Washington that their loved ones died while trying to protect others.\", \"\\u201cYou invite athletes to the White House because they\\u2019ve won a championship; why not invite families who lost their loved one because they went into a hospital, they went into a school that wasn\\u2019t really safe?\\u201d said Pamela Addison, whose late husband was a hospital speech pathologist. She runs a support group called Young Widows and Widowers of Covid-19. \\u201cYou see when a military person dies there is this big celebration of their life and the kids know their parent is a hero. Our kids need that.\\u201d\", \"I brought today\\u2019s question to Carl Zimmer, who covers science for The Times. (If you have a question, you can fill out this form.)\", \"Soon after the variant was identified, it began to be discovered all over the world, which implies that it was already widely dispersed. Why does it take identification in one place to jump-start the identification elsewhere? Are variants usually not identified when people are tested or hospitalized? \\u2014 Margaret Pierpont, New York, N.Y.\", \"Carl: A positive Covid test only tells you that you have SARS-CoV-2 inside you. It doesn\\u2019t tell you what kind of SARS-CoV-2 is in there. For that, you need to take an extra step and run a test that can detect a variant. There are ways to test for variants we already know about, like Alpha and Delta. But the only way to detect a new variant is to sequence all the genetic material in a virus sample. Only a fraction of positive tests get fully sequenced. In South Africa and Botswana, some very perceptive doctors and scientists noticed something odd about a few cases and decided to look closer. It turned out those cases were caused by a previously unknown variant, which we now call Omicron. Once other countries knew what to look for, they started finding Omicron in their own samples.\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic.
