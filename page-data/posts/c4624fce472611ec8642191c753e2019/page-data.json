Through interviews, archival images and illustrated sequences, the movie, directed by Dani Menkin, offers a treacly biography of the overseas celebrity athlete whose career was ultimately derailed by an addiction to heroin.\", \"Born in Newark, N.J., the 6-foot-10 Perry always saw basketball as his calling. Hoop dreams propelled him to the N.B.A., but after he was promptly cut from the Knicks, Perry took a chance: He accepted a spot with Maccabi Tel Aviv. The team proved a solid fit, and Perry led Maccabi to European Champions Cup victories in 1977 and 1981, before drug addiction and a trafficking charge forced him to shelf his remarkable career.\", \"There is a contagious thrill to the movie\\u2019s portrait of its subject\\u2019s achievements, especially his whirlwind romance with the Israeli supermodel Tami Ben Ami. But when it comes to Perry\\u2019s moments of struggle, \\u201cAulcie\\u201d trips up. Schmaltzy music and fuzzy pictures give a hard tug at the heartstrings, and footage of Perry missing shots on an empty court is frequently deployed as a superficial visual metaphor for hardship. The movie also declines to engage with Israel\\u2019s evolving politics or culture and where Perry fit in, opting instead for a melodramatic portrait of a star that fell too soon.\"]","href_hash":"c4624fce472611ec8642191c753e2019"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c4624fce472611ec8642191c753e2019"}},
