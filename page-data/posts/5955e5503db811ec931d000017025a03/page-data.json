I often talk to people about the old joke about coming to school to eat your lunch and there's an element of truth in that in relation to the value of social interaction,\\\" he said.\", \"Davis said attendance this week was about the mid-80 percent figure and the absent students were continuing with online learning.\", \"Onehunga High principal Deidre Shea said about 55 percent of her senior students were back, and she had heard that attendance at other schools ranged from 30 to 94 percent.\", \"\\\"Where we are in Onehunga, and we draw from Onehunga and Mangere Bridge, there have been numbers of cases ... so I think that's the sort of thing that impacts as well,\\\" Shea said.\", \"\\\"If you're in a community that's affected big time, then you can expect lower attendance on site.\\\"\", \"Students and teachers had adjusted well to a new requirement for senior students and teachers in alert level 3 regions to wear masks indoors, she said.\", \"However, she said the masks muffled teachers' voices, forcing them to speak more loudly so their students could hear them.\", \"\\\"By the end of the day, I think it's fair to say teachers are a little tired from having to project their voice that much more from behind the mask.\\\"\", \"Shea and Davis said there was wide variation in students' preparedness for NCEA and Scholarship exams, which would begin on 22 November.\", \"Davis said his school had decided not to stop teaching in the traditional study break during the week before exams begin. Instead, it would provide workshops right through that week.\"]","href_hash":"5955e5503db811ec931d000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5955e5503db811ec931d000017025a03"}},
