From underwater, in a shot aimed toward the pool\\u2019s surface, we see Kendall drop his bottle of beer into the water. From the camera\\u2019s perspective, it appears his face is also submerged. He looks \\u2026 dead?\", \"Whether this is a literal or figurative death remains unresolved when the closing credits roll. (Surely the show wouldn\\u2019t kill off a major character in such an ambiguous way?) We do know, though, who is responsible \\u2014 in a roundabout way \\u2014 for putting Kendall into that pool. It\\u2019s the same people who brought him into this world: his mother, Caroline (Harriet Walter), and his father, Logan.\", \"This week, Kendall joined his family in scenic Italy for the wedding of Caroline and her old flame Peter Munion (Pip Torrens). He appears to be on a mission to straighten out his life after last week\\u2019s calamitous birthday party. His hair is buzzed down to stubble \\u2014 \\u201cstripping down,\\u201d he says \\u2014 and he seems determined to make peace with his siblings and to settle his Waystar business.\", \"But as soon as Kendall arrives, his mother pulls him aside and tells him about Peter\\u2019s awful \\u201citinerary of events,\\u201d asking if her son can help divvy them up in such a way that he won\\u2019t be in the same space as Logan \\u2014 per Logan\\u2019s request. That is the first blow to Kendall\\u2019s confidence.\", \"The second comes when Kendall is talking with Comfry about some last-ditch opportunities to keep his crusade against corporate malfeasance alive in the media. A popular podcast is investigating \\u201cthe Curse of the Roys\\u201d and would love to have him participate. The problem? The hosts are going to dig deep into all the family scandals \\u2026 including the death of the cater-waiter whom the media thinks Logan bullied to death but whom Kendall actually drove into a lake at Shiv\\u2019s wedding.\", \"The third strike to Kendall\\u2019s psyche \\u2014 the finisher \\u2014 comes when he has dinner with Logan. Kendall has given this meeting a lot of thought. He consulted with Logan\\u2019s doctor to make sure the menu fit with his dad\\u2019s restricted diet. (\\u201cAfraid I\\u2019m going to Jim Jones you with an olive?\\u201d Kendall jokes.) And he prepared a reasonable proposal. He will cash out of Waystar for two billion dollars while keeping one of the company\\u2019s media assets for himself. He also promises to stay out of Logan\\u2019s life forever. \\u201cI won\\u2019t even speak at your memorial,\\u201d he says.\", \"But Logan won\\u2019t play along. He calls in Kendall\\u2019s autistic son, Iverson, to taste his food, to make sure it isn\\u2019t poisoned. This is icy not only because it demonstrates a lack of trust but also because Logan seems blithely willing to sacrifice his grandson. (In a further dig, he then asks Kendall of Iverson, \\u201cIs he getting better?\\u201d) And although he seemed willing to buy his son out before, he hesitates now that he has a counteroffer in hand.\", \"This whole scene \\u2014 intense and emotional \\u2014 neatly encapsulates the whole Logan Roy mentality. He wants his family and his employees at his beck-and-call, but he doesn\\u2019t want to grant them any real boon. Whenever someone he is negotiating with seems satisfied, Logan gets restless.\", \"Like nearly every other one of his corrosive personality traits, this combination of greed, envy and paranoia has been passed on to his children \\u2014 and to Shiv, in particular. While Logan is having a miserable dinner with Kendall, Shiv is stuck at a \\u201cgirls night\\u201d with Caroline and some of her future in-laws. The conversation she has with her mother is just as revealing about \\u201cthe Curse of the Roys.\\u201d\", \"Shiv has long kept Caroline on the list of childhood disappointments she had to overcome. But Caroline won\\u2019t let her get away with this revisionist history. In Shiv\\u2019s memory, her mother took a payout from Logan and then pushed her and her brothers to go live with their dad when she was 10 years old, all because Caroline didn\\u2019t want to play mommy any more. The real story? Shiv was 13; and she made an active decision to move in with Logan. (\\u201cI\\u2019ll have the carbonara and daddy,\\u201d is how her mother describes her daughter\\u2019s casual cruelty.)\", \"This revelation fires up Shiv, who heads back to her room and tells Tom that she is ready to fight for the top Waystar job \\u2014 and to have a baby with him. But their night of passion goes poorly, as she slips into a curious bit of dominatrix-style role play, which sees her seducing Tom while purring, \\u201cYou\\u2019re not good enough for me,\\u201d and, \\u201cI don\\u2019t love you.\\u201d\", \"The next day he wants to discuss this, wondering, \\u201cShould I maybe listen to things you say directly in my face when we\\u2019re at our most intimate?\\u201d But Shiv insists none of it should be taken seriously. (\\u201cWhat happens in Sex Vegas \\u2026?,\\u201d she offers weakly.) She also modifies their pregnancy plan, offering to freeze their embryos instead, and then wraps up the conversation with, \\u201cI may not love you, but I do love you.\\u201d Such is the way a Roy expresses affection.\", \"This deep fickleness is evident also in the way Logan handles the continuing negotiations with Lukas Mattson and GoJo. At the start of this episode Logan brings Stewy and Sandi into the office to inform them about the acquisition, pretending it\\u2019s a courtesy but really wanting to rub it in their faces a little. But he also insists that he will kill the deal if they don\\u2019t like it; and truth be told, he is a little nervous about the way Mattson seems to be driving up his share price with reckless, emoji-filled tweets. (\\u201cI\\u2019m not used to negotiating via eggplant,\\u201d Logan sighs.)\", \"So Roman is dispatched to the Mattson compound to find out whether the GoJo boss is mentally unstable or just making \\u201ca move.\\u201d The two men have an unsettling discussion about the thrill of failure; and Roman may have come away from this meeting with the impression that Mattson is a flake. But he hedges his bets with Logan regardless, telling his dad that their potential business partner really wants \\u201ca merger of equals\\u201d \\u2014 something he figures will torpedo the deal.\", \"Instead, surprisingly, Logan is open to the idea of letting GoJo be the acquirer while Waystar runs the business \\u2014 so long as he knows that Mattson is \\u201ca serious person\\u201d and not \\u201ca Twitter panty flasher.\\u201d (\\u201cI can win any bout with a boxer,\\u201d Logan says. \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t know how to knock out a clown.\\u201d)\", \"What does give the old man pause, though, is that while Roman is celebrating what he thinks is another big win for himself, he accidentally texts a picture of his penis to his father, thinking that he is harassing Gerri. Now Logan has reason to question Roman, Gerri \\u2026 really his whole command structure.\", \"Amusingly, when Roman tries to explain the whole concept of sending photographs of genitalia, Logan reassures him that he is aware of this phenomenon, saying, \\u201cWe do publish a number of popular newspapers.\\u201d This echoes something he says to Kendall as they wrap up their bitter meal together with nothing settled. Kendall tries to deliver a closing statement on his time at Waystar, telling his dad, \\u201cYou won because you\\u2019re corrupt and so is the world,\\u201d and, \\u201cYou\\u2019ve turned black bile into silver dollars.\\u201d Logan smirks and says, \\u201cJust noticed, did you?\\u201d\", \"Logan counters Kendall\\u2019s self-righteousness first by standing up for his revolutionary vision for the news: \\u201cA bit of spice, a bit of fun, a bit of truth.\\u201d Then he stabs his son through the heart, referencing the dead waiter again by asking, \\u201cHow long was that kid alive before he started sucking water?\\u201d\", \"And so, as day follows night, Kendall ends up sucking water himself, mired in self-loathing in a Tuscan paradise. Dead or not, at this moment, he certainly isn\\u2019t alive.\"]","href_hash":"53014272564411ecb2d871c790cddb7b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"53014272564411ecb2d871c790cddb7b"}},
