They are essential to our very survival,\\\" said Johnson, who is chairing the summit. \\\"With today's (Tuesday's) unprecedented pledges, we will have a chance to end humanity's long history as nature's conqueror, and instead become its custodian.\\\"\", \" The signatories include Brazil and Russia, which have been singled out for accelerating deforestation in their territories, as well as the United States, China, Australia and France.\", \" The government of Brazil, much criticized for its environmental policies, announced on Monday at the summit that it would cut 2005-level greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2030 \\u2014 up from a previous pledge of 43%.\", \" \\\"We are presenting a new, more ambitious climate goal,\\\" Environment Minister Joaquim Leite announced in a message transmitted from Brasilia to Glasgow. Leite also said Brazil would aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.\", \"Almost a quarter of all man-made emissions of carbon dioxide can be attributed to land use activity such as logging, deforestation and farming.\", \" President Joko Widodo of resource-rich Indonesia said his own archipelago's rainforests, mangroves, seas and peatlands were key to restricting climate change.\", \" \\\"We are committed to protecting these critical carbon sinks and our natural capital for future generations,\\\" he said in a U.K. government statement.\", \"The summit pledge to \\\"halt and reverse deforestation and land degradation by 2030\\\" encompasses promises to secure the rights of indigenous peoples, and recognize \\\"their role as forest guardians.\\\"\", \" While Johnson described the pledge as \\\"unprecedented,\\\" a U.N. climate gathering in New York in 2014 issued a similar declaration to halve the rate of deforestation by 2020, and end it by 2030.\", \" However, trees continue to be cut down on an industrial scale, not least in the Amazon under the far-right government of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro.\", \"Humans have already cut down half of Earth's forests, a practice doubly harmful for the climate when CO2-sucking trees are replaced with livestock or monoculture crops.\", \" Greenpeace criticized the Glasgow initiative for effectively giving the green light to \\\"another decade of deforestation.\\\" \", \" \\\"Indigenous peoples are calling for 80% of the Amazon to be protected by 2025, and they're right, that's what's needed,\\\" said Greenpeace Brazil executive director Carolina Pasquali. \\\"The climate and the natural world can't afford this deal.\\\"\", \"Swedish activist Greta Thunberg, meanwhile, urged the leaders gathered for COP26 to act, and stop their \\\"blah blah blah,\\\" during a demonstration in Glasgow.\", \"Many studies have shown that the best way of protecting forests worldwide is to keep them under the management of locals with generations of preservation knowledge.\", \"The commitment comes a day after U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres harangued the gathered leaders to act to save humanity.\", \" \\\"It's time to say: enough,\\\" he said. \\\"Enough of brutalizing biodiversity. Enough of killing ourselves with carbon. Enough of burning and drilling and mining our way deeper. We are digging our own graves.\\\"\", \"Summit host Johnson warned of the \\\"uncontainable\\\" anger of the younger generations if the leaders failed to act decisively on climate change.\", \" The U.N. COP26 conference will continue for another two weeks to try to craft national plans to forestall the most devastating impacts of global warming.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"5a141c1a3bbe11ecae25000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5a141c1a3bbe11ecae25000017025a03"}},
