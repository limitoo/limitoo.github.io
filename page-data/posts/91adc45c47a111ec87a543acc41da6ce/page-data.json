Not us. And we are not encouraging independence [...] Let them make up their mind. Period.\\\"\", \"At a regular press conference in Beijing, China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian didn't address Biden's apparent endorsement of Taiwanese self-determination, but he repeated Beijing's recent insistence that the U.S.'s \\\"one China\\\" policy is wrong.\", \"\\\"What the United States should be abiding by is the 'one China' principle and the China-U.S. Three Joint Communiques. They are an important political consensus between the two countries,\\\" Zhao said.\", \"He added: \\\"The so-called 'Taiwan Relations Act' and the 'Six Assurances' to Taiwan were cooked up by domestic forces in the United States and are contrary to the China-U.S. Three Joint Communiques.
