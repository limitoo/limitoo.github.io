So if we pick it up early, it's possible we could still stamp it out. But if Omicron became established in the community I expect it would spread very very quickly at a similar speed to what we've seen in New South Wales,\\\" Plank said.\", \"\\\"Watching New South Wales over the next few weeks will give us a really good guide as to what we could expect if Omicron came here. There's early evidence Omicron is a bit milder and the hospitalisation rate is a little bit lower than Delta ... but there's still a risk that the sheer number of people being infected would put significant pressure on our healthcare systems.\\\"\", \"Plank said the traffic light system relied on vaccinations and early data showed vaccinations were less effective against Omicron, although they reduced the chance of hospitalisation.\", \"He believed mask wearing and venue capacity limits would only slow the spread slightly.\", \"On December 22 the number of people in MIQ with Omicron was 28.\", \"To stop the variant getting out, the government has lengthened MIQ stays for arrivals, delayed quarantine-free travel from Australia until at least late February, and shortened the time for pre-departure tests.\", \"Plank also wanted rapid tests for returnees right before they flew, and he backed calls from epidemiologist Michael Baker for the number of new arrivals to be slashed.\", \"Nurses Society director David Wills agreed.\", \"\\\"Given the way Omicron has spread you have to regard every country as a potential threat. That's why reducing numbers is really important.
