Killer robots \\u2014 drones, guns and bombs that decide on their own, with artificial brains, whether to attack and kill \\u2014 and what should be done, if anything, to regulate or ban them.\", \"Once the domain of science fiction films like the \\u201cTerminator\\u201d series and \\u201cRoboCop,\\u201d killer robots, more technically known as Lethal Autonomous Weapons Systems, have been invented and tested at an accelerated pace with little oversight. Some prototypes have even been used in actual conflicts.\", \"The evolution of these machines is considered a potentially seismic event in warfare, akin to the invention of gunpowder and nuclear bombs.\", \"This year, for the first time, a majority of the 125 nations that belong to an agreement called the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, or C.C.W., said they wanted curbs on killer robots. But they were opposed by members that are developing these weapons, most notably the United States and Russia.\", \"The group\\u2019s conference concluded on Friday with only a vague statement about considering possible measures acceptable to all. The Campaign to Stop Killer Robots, a disarmament group, said the outcome fell \\u201cdrastically short.\\u201d\", \"The C.C.W., sometimes known as the Inhumane Weapons Convention, is a framework of rules that ban or restrict weapons considered to cause unnecessary, unjustifiable and indiscriminate suffering, such as incendiary explosives, blinding lasers and booby traps that don\\u2019t distinguish between fighters and civilians. The convention has no provisions for killer robots.\", \"Opinions differ on an exact definition, but they are widely considered to be weapons that make decisions with little or no human involvement. Rapid improvements in robotics, artificial intelligence and image recognition are making such armaments possible.\", \"The drones the United States has used extensively in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere are not considered robots because they are operated remotely by people, who choose targets and decide whether to shoot.\", \"To war planners, the weapons offer the promise of keeping soldiers out of harm\\u2019s way, and making faster decisions than a human would, by giving more battlefield responsibilities to autonomous systems like pilotless drones and driverless tanks that independently decide when to strike.\", \"Critics argue it is morally repugnant to assign lethal decision-making to machines, regardless of technological sophistication. How does a machine differentiate an adult from a child, a fighter with a bazooka from a civilian with a broom, a hostile combatant from a wounded or surrendering soldier?\", \"\\u201cFundamentally, autonomous weapon systems raise ethical concerns for society about substituting human decisions about life and death with sensor, software and machine processes,\\u201d Peter Maurer, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross and an outspoken opponent of killer robots, told the Geneva conference.\", \"In advance of the conference, Human Rights Watch and Harvard Law School\\u2019s International Human Rights Clinic called for steps toward a legally binding agreement that requires human control at all times.\", \"\\u201cRobots lack the compassion, empathy, mercy, and judgment necessary to treat humans humanely, and they cannot understand the inherent worth of human life,\\u201d the groups argued in a briefing paper to support their recommendations.\", \"Others said autonomous weapons, rather than reducing the risk of war, could do the opposite \\u2014 by providing antagonists with ways of inflicting harm that minimize risks to their own soldiers.\", \"\\u201cMass produced killer robots could lower the threshold for war by taking humans out of the kill chain and unleashing machines that could engage a human target without any human at the controls,\\u201d said Phil Twyford, New Zealand\\u2019s disarmament minister.\", \"The conference was widely considered by disarmament experts to be the best opportunity so far to devise ways to regulate, if not prohibit, the use of killer robots under the C.C.W.\", \"It was the culmination of years of discussions by a group of experts who had been asked to identify the challenges and possible approaches to reducing the threats from killer robots. But the experts could not even reach agreement on basic questions.\", \"Some, like Russia, insist that any decisions on limits must be unanimous \\u2014 in effect giving opponents a veto.\", \"The United States argues that existing international laws are sufficient and that banning autonomous weapons technology would be premature. The chief U.S. delegate to the conference, Joshua Dorosin, proposed a nonbinding \\u201ccode of conduct\\u201d for use of killer robots \\u2014 an idea that disarmament advocates dismissed as a delaying tactic.\", \"The American military has invested heavily in artificial intelligence, working with the biggest defense contractors, including Lockheed Martin, Boeing, Raytheon and Northrop Grumman. The work has included projects to develop long-range missiles that detect moving targets based on radio frequency, swarm drones that can identify and attack a target, and automated missile-defense systems, according to research by opponents of the weapons systems.\", \"The complexity and varying uses of artificial intelligence make it more difficult to regulate than nuclear weapons or land mines, said Maaike Verbruggen, an expert on emerging military security technology at the Centre for Security, Diplomacy and Strategy in Brussels. She said lack of transparency about what different countries are building has created \\u201cfear and concern\\u201d among military leaders that they must keep up.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s very hard to get a sense of what another country is doing,\\u201d said Ms. Verbruggen, who is working toward a Ph.D. on the topic. \\u201cThere is a lot of uncertainty and that drives military innovation.\\u201d\", \"Franz-Stefan Gady, a research fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies, said the \\u201carms race for autonomous weapons systems is already underway and won\\u2019t be called off any time soon.\\u201d\", \"Yes. Even as the technology becomes more advanced, there has been reluctance to use autonomous weapons in combat because of fears of mistakes, said Mr. Gady.\", \"\\u201cCan military commanders trust the judgment of autonomous weapon systems? Here the answer at the moment is clearly \\u2018no\\u2019 and will remain so for the near future,\\u201d he said.\", \"The debate over autonomous weapons has spilled into Silicon Valley. In 2018, Google said it would not renew a contract with the Pentagon after thousands of its employees signed a letter protesting the company\\u2019s work on a program using artificial intelligence to interpret images that could be used to choose drone targets. The company also created new ethical guidelines prohibiting the use of its technology for weapons and surveillance.\", \"Others believe the United States is not going far enough to compete with rivals.\", \"In October, the former chief software officer for the Air Force, Nicolas Chaillan, told the Financial Times that he had resigned because of what he saw as weak technological progress inside the American military, particularly the use of artificial intelligence. He said policymakers are slowed down by questions about ethics, while countries like China press ahead.\", \"There are not many verified battlefield examples, but critics point to a few incidents that show the technology\\u2019s potential.\", \"In March, United Nations investigators said a \\u201clethal autonomous weapons system\\u201d had been used by government-backed forces in Libya against militia fighters. A drone called Kargu-2, made by a Turkish defense contractor, tracked and attacked the fighters as they fled a rocket attack, according to the report, which left unclear whether any human controlled the drones.\", \"In the 2020 war in Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan fought Armenia with attack drones and missiles that loiter in the air until detecting the signal of an assigned target.\", \"Many disarmament advocates said the outcome of the conference had hardened what they described as a resolve to push for a new treaty in the next few years, like those that prohibit land mines and cluster munitions.\", \"Daan Kayser, an autonomous weapons expert at PAX, a Netherlands-based peace advocacy group, said the conference\\u2019s failure to agree to even negotiate on killer robots was \\u201ca really plain signal that the C.C.W. isn\\u2019t up to the job.\\u201d\", \"Noel Sharkey, an artificial intelligence expert and chairman of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control, said the meeting had demonstrated that a new treaty was preferable to further C.C.W. deliberations.\", \"\\u201cThere was a sense of urgency in the room,\\u201d he said, that \\u201cif there\\u2019s no movement, we\\u2019re not prepared to stay on this treadmill.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f601fcd0603711eca6a0b1b01d73fd61"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f601fcd0603711eca6a0b1b01d73fd61"}},
