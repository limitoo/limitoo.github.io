We also ask them to gather to discuss their years in reading in broader detail. This time we welcome our newest critics, Molly Young and Alexandra Jacobs, to the conversation. Below, Dwight Garner, Jennifer Szalai, Young and Jacobs talk about older books they read for the first time, authors who inspired and disappointed them, and more. \\u2014 John Williams\", \"What were some of the books published in 2021 that you didn\\u2019t review but admired?\", \"MOLLY YOUNG Jeff Chon\\u2019s \\u201cHashtag Good Guy with a Gun\\u201d was superb enough that I read it despite two powerful obstacles: 1) The presence of the word \\u201chashtag\\u201d in the title and 2) The fact that I spilled chili oil all over my copy, which turned the first 30 pages completely transparent and orange. A very funny book about conspiracy theories, masculinity and the internet.\", \"DWIGHT GARNER Andrew Sullivan\\u2019s stuff is astringent and humane and, crucially, unpredictable, and I read his \\u201cOut on a Limb: Selected Writing, 1989-2021\\u201d in three or four sittings. Gary Shteyngart was back in top form this year; we\\u2019re lucky to have that guy. The new books of poetry from Kevin Young and Louise Gl\\u00fcck, two favorites, were treats. Lauren Oyler\\u2019s novel, \\u201cFake Accounts,\\u201d was more than promising; I\\u2019m not alone in wondering what she\\u2019ll do next.\", \"JENNIFER SZALAI Eyal Press\\u2019s \\u201cDirty Work\\u201d \\u2014 about hard, morally troubling jobs, like piloting kill drones and working in slaughterhouses \\u2014 was terrific: learned, patient, unflinching, powerful. I was impressed by Clint Smith\\u2019s \\u201cHow the Word Is Passed,\\u201d which traces the geographical legacy of slavery. Reading Tove Ditlevsen\\u2019s \\u201cThe Copenhagen Trilogy\\u201d was so unsettling as well as so pleasurable that it\\u2019s bound to be one of those books I return to again and again. \\u201cThe Loneliest Americans,\\u201d by our colleague Jay Caspian Kang at Opinion, has been subject to a lot of spirited discussion already, and I think his exploration of class and identity among Asian Americans will be talked about for years to come.\", \"ALEXANDRA JACOBS I reviewed so much less than you all this year that this is more a cloverleaf than a roundtable, but: especially in the light of Stephen Sondheim\\u2019s recent death, his collaborator James Lapine\\u2019s memoir and oral history \\u201cPutting It Together\\u201d \\u2014 let\\u2019s call it a \\u201cthem-oir\\u201d \\u2014 for pulling back the curtain on \\u201cSunday in the Park With George,\\u201d one of the most meaningful musicals in (and on) creation; Heather Clark\\u2019s biography of the little-explicated poet Sylvia Plath, \\u201cRed Comet,\\u201d for defiantly coming in at a \\u201cPower Broker\\u201d-like 1,100-plus pages; and the novels by Sally Rooney, Patricia Lockwood and Lauren Oyler addressing how the internet has transformed interpersonal communication \\u2014 though I\\u2019m still waiting for something like what Nicholson Baker\\u2019s \\u201cVox\\u201d did for phone sex.\", \"Who are some of the best writers that emerged (on your radar) this year? Or writers who took a step forward in their work (in ambition or craft) that you considered significant?\", \"GARNER Quentin Tarantino\\u2019s novelization of \\u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\\u201d was pure power pop. Reading it was like finding Cheap Trick on the radio in 1978. Anthony Veasna So\\u2019s posthumously published story collection, \\u201cAfterparties,\\u201d made you feel he was only getting started. \", \"The novel of the year, to my mind, was Atticus Lish\\u2019s \\u201cThe War for Gloria.\\u201d I was as thrilled by it as Mencken said he was upon first reading Dreiser\\u2019s colossal \\u201cSister Carrie.\\u201d Lish is really going for it in this realistic novel. It\\u2019s a roughly textured rush of sensation, and largely indifferent to style, because he can afford to be.\", \"YOUNG I freaked out over \\u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\\u201d too. It made me titter, chortle and howl \\u2014 all the different genres of laughter. You can tell Tarantino had so much fun writing it.\", \"JACOBS I was dazzled by the daring and imagination of \\u201cThe Final Revival of Opal & Nev,\\u201d by Dawnie Walton, which I reviewed before officially becoming a critic for The Times. And I noted with interest Alison Bechdel brightening her color palette in her timely yet highly personal examination of exercise and mind-body transcendence, \\u201cThe Secret to Superhuman Strength.\\u201d (Goddess knows we need that right now!)\", \"SZALAI I was happy to be introduced to the work of Albert Samaha, whose family memoir, \\u201cConcepcion,\\u201d merges a roiling history of the Philippines with an intimate portrait of his immigrant mom. \", \"I had already been reading the philosopher Amia Srinivasan in The London Review of Books, but there was something exhilarating about reading her at length in \\u201cThe Right to Sex.\\u201d She engages so deeply with the ideas of others, showing what\\u2019s useful while also acknowledging what\\u2019s troubling \\u2014 a real feat at a time when it seems as if nearly every discourse lurches between two modes: worship or denunciation.\", \"Did anyone in particular disappoint you?\", \"SZALAI I wanted more from \\u201cA Splendid Intelligence,\\u201d Cathy Curtis\\u2019s biography of Elizabeth Hardwick \\u2014 but then maybe I should have taken a cue from Hardwick herself, who derided the entire genre of literary biography (unfairly, I think, but she was unfailingly stylish about it).\", \"JACOBS I very much admire Lionel Shriver and plunged eagerly into \\u201cShould We Stay or Should We Go,\\u201d her novel about an aging couple who make a suicide pact, but I found its Choose Your Own Adventure-style looping, while technically impressive, more confusing and less convincing than a similar, simpler device in \\u201cThe Post-Birthday World.\\u201d (Though maybe its confusions were meta-commentary on dementia? Scratching chin emoji.)\", \"Also: the cover designers who persist in pandering to Instagram with those titles in Futura or \\u201970s-retro fonts against lush, colorful backgrounds. They are this decade\\u2019s version of \\u201cthe plague of women\\u2019s backs\\u201d that Chlo\\u00eb Schama identified in 2013 (bicycles were a thing for a while, too), and they\\u2019re starting to weary the eye before the spine is even cracked.\", \"YOUNG Yes! Revenge of the blobs. I loved this piece on the trend. These days you really have to turn to the university presses and small presses for satisfyingly unexpected book covers.\", \"GARNER Joy Williams is one of my heroes \\u2014 her novels and stories are, for me, desert island choices \\u2014 but her new novel, \\u201cHarrow,\\u201d sort of wanders into the weeds and doesn\\u2019t quite come back out. It\\u2019s still Joy Williams, though, so you could easily do worse. Richard Powers! His new novel, \\u201cBewilderment\\u201d \\u2014 perfect title \\u2014 was so soft and earnest and coyly proud of its ecological politics (what reader thinks we shouldn\\u2019t save the planet?) that it made me want to leap to my death from a scenic overlook.\", \"What about books not published in 2021 that you read in the past 12 months? Anything you would especially recommend?\", \"GARNER I read Elmore Leonard\\u2019s \\u201cSwag\\u201d for the first time, or rather I listened to it on Audible. The witty, bone-dry dialogue made a long car ride go by in a flash. I wrote Larry McMurtry\\u2019s obituary this year. Afterward, several people wrote to tell me I\\u2019d neglected to mention what they thought was his best novel, \\u201cAll My Friends Are Going to Be Strangers.\\u201d They were right: it\\u2019s a stone, hilarious classic.\", \"YOUNG Jade Sharma\\u2019s \\u201cProblems\\u201d is a dagger of a novel from 2016. The narrator is a young woman juggling three dysfunctional relationships: one with her husband, one with her lover, one with heroin. I raced through the book in one spurt and had to switch from chair to foam roller midway through so I could reach the end without ruining my neck. The author died in 2019 at age 39, which is a terrible loss. But what a book she left us.\", \"I also got pretty obsessed with Jos\\u00e9 Eduardo Agualusa\\u2019s \\u201cA General Theory of Oblivion,\\u201d first published in 2012 and translated into English in 2015. It\\u2019s about a woman who barricades herself into an apartment on the eve of Angolan independence and lives off pigeons for 30 years. With a premise like that\\u2026\", \"JACOBS Honestly, in 2021, desperate for escape from current events, I read mostly books not published in 2021, or even in the last century, like \\u201cThe Eustace Diamonds,\\u201d by Anthony Trollope. I also savored Edith Wharton\\u2019s \\u201cRoman Fever and Other Stories\\u201d this summer, having happened upon it at the great Manchester by the Book. Speaking of Wharton, I see even she has been blobbed! Is nothing sacred?\", \"Molly and Alexandra, you both started as book critics for The Times in September. Any all-time favorite books of criticism that you would recommend people delve into over the holidays?\", \"JACOBS John Updike\\u2019s \\u201cHugging the Shore\\u201d and \\u201cOdd Jobs\\u201d are the bookends of my Updike Shelf (about which, another time). Here was someone who didn\\u2019t have to review or consider his contemporaries or predecessors, and yet industriously, prolifically did. What generosity.\", \"YOUNG Martin Amis\\u2019s collection \\u201cThe War Against Clich\\u00e9.\\u201d His flow is insane.\", \"JACOBS Wait, I meant to say that! Well, Amis has written about Updike and Updike about Martin\\u2019s father, Kingsley, so maybe this is a male literary turducken\\u2026.\", \"What offerings in the culture this past year were most likely to draw you away from reading a book?\", \"GARNER I lived for five months this year in New Orleans, and it was a delirious place to be as Covid restrictions began to ease. I spent a lot of nights in jazz clubs on Frenchman Street, and in the backyard at Kermit Ruffins\\u2019s Mother in Law Lounge. \", \"I burned out on Netflix and other streaming services this year. They began to make me feel like a bird trapped in a shopping mall. I spent more time on YouTube. The trick is to make lists of people \\u2014 let\\u2019s say, Dick Gregory and Jessica Mitford and Isaiah Berlin and Rita Dove and The Fabulous Moolah and Oscar Zeta Acosta \\u2014 and watch what turns up after your search. It\\u2019s like having a network of one\\u2019s own.\", \"SZALAI I\\u2019m jealous of Dwight\\u2019s nightlife in New Orleans because I still haven\\u2019t so much as seen a movie in theaters \\u2014 but I\\u2019m planning to remedy that soon. I did take advantage of my family being away recently to stream some of the horror movies they refuse to see, including \\u201cThe Wicker Man,\\u201d which I thoroughly enjoyed, though the creepy-to-campy ratio was off for me; maybe the idea of a chaste, frantically uptight police sergeant swooning over a weird innkeeper\\u2019s daughter seemed less silly in 1973, when the movie was made. \", \"The film production company A24 recently came out with a cookbook, \\u201cHorror Caviar,\\u201d which includes the pastry chef Natasha Pickowicz\\u2019s recipe for a white chocolate mousse and walnut dacquoise torte (try saying that fast five times in a row). The photographs of the smashed torte, its bright red jam oozing, make it look both delicious and macabre. I can\\u2019t wait to make it, and to see \\u201cPossession,\\u201d the film from 1981 that inspired it.\", \"YOUNG I like to keep the voices in my head company with other voices, often in podcast form. I stockpile episodes of Open Source and then listen nonstop on days when I have to machete my way through a jungle of household chores. I suggest starting with the episode featuring Cornel West and Susannah Heschel or the conversation with Rebecca Solnit about George Orwell. The host, Christopher Lydon, is a generous and spirited interlocutor who can talk about anything. Anything! Sometimes I try to think up topics that might stump him and then inevitably find an episode on that exact topic lurking in the archives.\", \"Whenever a new episode of Alex Kaschuta\\u2019s Subversive Podcast appears, I contort my entire schedule to fit it in. As with many of the best things in life, it costs money \\u2014 you need to subscribe to access the full library \\u2014 but some episodes are available for free, so you can try a little taste on your podcast app of choice and see if you like it.\", \"JACOBS On the contrary, finally watching \\u201cThe Crown\\u201d made me want to read everything I could on English royalty, a subject that hasn\\u2019t attracted me since I was, oh, 9? Specifically Prince Philip and Wallis Simpson, both itchy outsiders who played along up to a point. (No desire to see the \\u201cDiana\\u201d musical, though, even before reading Jesse Green\\u2019s review in the Times \\u2014 this seems like the epitome of too soon.) And not unrelatedly, I look forward all weekend to \\u201cSuccession,\\u201d and the morning-after analysis on Twitter.\", \"Any reading plans already on the horizon for 2022?\", \"JACOBS My father was a psychiatrist who after his death left behind a remarkable professional library, including works by Bruno Bettelheim, Julian Jaynes and Jeffrey Masson (known for that\\u00a0decadelong libel case\\u00a0against The New Yorker over a profile of him by Janet Malcolm,\\u00a0who died herself this year). So I\\u2019d like to devote part of \\u201922 to sorting through that. Actually I\\u00a0need\\u00a0to, because it\\u2019s taking up a lot of shelf space. Analyze that!\", \"SZALAI Even though J.M. Coetzee has written some of my favorite novels \\u2014 books that seemed to shift my center of gravity, so that the world as I understand it has looked different\\u00a0ever since \\u2014 I\\u2019ve been putting off reading his Jesus trilogy (the first volume appeared in 2013). Part of it had to do with the usual dull reasons of not getting around to something, time being the big one \\u2014 or at least the big excuse. But now that I\\u2019ve had my sense of time distorted and in some ways destroyed by this pandemic, I no longer want the weeks to melt into years without experiencing the last decade of his work.\", \"GARNER Next up for me is Anne Moody\\u2019s 1968 memoir, \\u201cComing of Age in Mississippi,\\u201d which I\\u2019ve only just learned about. My friend the satire freak tells me I must track down a copy of James Dugan\\u2019s 19th-century book \\u201cDoctor Dispachemquic\\u201d (say it out loud), a forgotten medical satire that\\u2019s subtitled: \\u201cA Story of the Great Southern Plague of 1878.\\u201d What this friend says, I do.\", \"YOUNG I\\u2019d like to amass a little pile of Japanese crime fiction in translation. At the top of the pile will be \\u201cOut,\\u201d by Natsuo Kirino \\u2014 I\\u2019ve been told by a friend with expertise in the genre that the book is \\u201ccold and flatly described, occasionally violent and cruel but not operatic about it,\\u201d and that when the crime at the center of the plot is solved I will be imbued with the uneasy feeling that it is symptomatic of a larger social problem.
