Australia were able to feed the shooting circle 26 times in the opening quarter, compared to 14 for their counterparts, gifting their shooters ample opportunity to extend their lead.\", \"Gretel Bueta and Steph Wood were a perfect 17/17 through that first period to set the foundation for victory.\", \"Taurua fielded Maia Wilson and Tiana Metuarau under goal, and Wilson looked far more assured than she had during the domestic season, eventually converting 24/26 attempts for the match.\", \"But neither Metuarau nor fellow rookie Grace Nweke could provide her with the support she needed to mount a comeback, as the match wore on. Nweke's added size provided a momentary challenge to the Diamond defenders, but they quickly adjusted.\", \"Trailling by nine goals at halftime, New Zealand went scoreless for almost five minutes after the restart, as their deficit swelled by another seven goals.\", \"Only when Australian coach Stacey Marinkovich began running her bench in the final quarter did the Ferns make any kind of run in response.\", \"\\\"There were some good moments, mainly in the second half, especially defensively,\\\" reflects Dame Noeline. \\\"I thought we were able to turn over some ball and were quite structured, but probably in our attacking end, we weren't able to do the job in our own positions.\", \"\\\"As individuals, we will take away at our shooting end and what it feels like to be under that intense pressure, and still be able to put the shot up and do your job.\", \"\\\"Defensively, we still need to turn over ball and there needs to be more pressure on the ball, instead of dropping off to give them more space.\\\"\", \"The Silver Ferns don't have long to absorb those lessons, because they taken on hosts England on Monday morning, after the Roses dispatched South Africa 71-47.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Australia 53 (Bueta 31/33, Wood 19/22, Koenan 3/4) New Zealand 39 (Wilson 24/26, Metuarau 12/18, Nweke 3/5)\", \"Join us at 5am Monday for live updates of the Silver Ferns v England Northern Quad Series encounter\"]","href_hash":"4e4617b8764311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4e4617b8764311ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
