You've already got a cost of living crisis, add in some mortgage pressure, it could be tough times for a lot of families.\\\"\", \"A lot of households were having to spend a lot more, and getting less bang for their buck, he said.\", \"This was especially the case for families on lower incomes, who were spending more on necessities like food and utilities, he said.\", \"\\\"For the average household, as they deal with those cost pressures, we think they are going to wind back their spending over the coming year. If you think about the average amount of goods that you're taking home on a weekly basis, it's probably going to fall by about 2 percent in the few years.\", \"\\\"That's a pretty big contraction because that's about 60 percent of the economy that's accounted for by household spending. I think that'll be an important drag in economic activity over the next couple of years.\\\"\", \"Ranchhod thought we would see the economy going sideways in the next couple of years.\"]","href_hash":"0dd112e41f7a11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0dd112e41f7a11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
