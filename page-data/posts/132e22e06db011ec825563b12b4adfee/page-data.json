Our impressions are novel, ours are the way ahead.\", \"But people way back, despite how quaint they might seem to us now, felt the same way we do. E.L. Doctorow got this just right in \\u201cThe Waterworks,\\u201d set in the Gilded Age in New York City, in which the story\\u2019s narrator reminds us early on: \\u201cYou may think you are living in modern times, here and now, but that is the necessary illusion of every age. We did not conduct ourselves as if we were preparatory to your time. There was nothing quaint or colorful about us.\\u201d\", \"And yet just as that waistcoated, mutton-chop-whiskered, horse-drawn New York looks antiquated, if charming, to us now, we, too, in many of our takes on things (not to mention our attire) will look quite antique and peculiar before we know it.\", \"This occurred to me when I was recently referred to a piece about language from 1946. It was by one of the intellectuals I most revere, Jacques Barzun. He was a historian (as if one academic classification could describe this mega-intellectual Renaissance man) at my own Columbia University during much of the 20th century, a career that included helping develop Columbia\\u2019s Great Books courses \\u2014 the same curriculum I wrote about last month. He lived an unusually long life, dying at 104 in 2012, and was vigorously productive until close to the end.\", \"And speaking of Great Books, one of the 10 greatest books I\\u2019ve ever known is one Barzun finished in his 90s, \\u201cFrom Dawn to Decadence: 1500 to the Present \\u2014 500 Years of Western Cultural Life.\\u201d This survey of Western intellectual history has left me in utter awe for years now, and eternally influenced my writing style, my bookshelf and my worldview. One must revisit it yearly along with one\\u2019s photo albums, cherished recipes, and either Coltrane or Brahms depending on mood (maybe I\\u2019m getting a little specific).\", \"But visiting Barzun in his 1946 review, in The Atlantic, of H.L. Mencken\\u2019s \\u201cThe American Language,\\u201d a survey of American English words and expressions, and their history, was an education. Reading Barzun on Mencken reminded me that if the only reason we disapprove of something people are saying \\u201cthese days\\u201d is that we just find it off-putting for reasons more of the stomach than the head, then we should consider a test: Could we defend our disapproval 100 years from now, to people who never knew an English without it, and are perplexed that people of our time found it unpleasant? Potential candidates for this test include the expression \\u201cI could care less\\u201d and using \\u201cimpact\\u201d as a verb synonymous with \\u201caffect\\u201d (which, I\\u2019ve learned, The Times\\u2019s stylebook frowns on).\", \"In the review, Barzun shows that he\\u2019s an academic of easygoing, demotic leanings, celebrating assorted developments in English grammar that others at the time (and today) dismiss as decay. Alongside his erudition, he loved popular culture, including baseball, and in keeping with that real-world touch, approved of Mencken\\u2019s celebration of various American vernacularisms, noting that \\u201cpreferring aint I? to the prissy am I not?, getting rid of whom and accepting he dont (with no apostrophe in this or similar contractions) would really be \\u2018modernizing\\u2019 in a fashion tolerably practical and democratic.\\u201d He also saw the logic in dropping the \\u201c-ly\\u201d in forms such as \\u201crest easy\\u201d and \\u201cdrive slow.\\u201d\", \"To know Barzun as a solon, so deeply knowledgeable about the antique and the classical, is to be somewhat surprised by this catholicity about grammatical constructions \\u2014 people of his stripe tend to be more conservative about matters of language and expression. And I, at least, am thrown by his opinions about language beyond this. He wrote, on the one hand, that \\u201cvernacular grammar not only simplifies; I also think its reasoned acceptance would teach us something about the genius of the language.\\u201d OK. But he then appends that this genius is \\u201cobscured by our shoddy and excessive word-making.\\u201d And what exactly did he find shoddy and excessive in this regard?\", \"Words. It was isolated words he found inutile, if not offensive, and here are some: \\u201cevaluate,\\u201d \\u201cabsenteeism,\\u201d \\u201cfinalize,\\u201d \\u201cdirective,\\u201d \\u201cto implement\\u201d and \\u201ccheeseburger.\\u201d\", \"To Barzun, an endlessly granular and elevated vocabulary \\u2014 an encyclopedic knowledge of the dictionary \\u2014 wasn\\u2019t the point. Rather: \\u201cTo trust to the digestive powers of usage alone seems, in these conditions, rather too blithe. It amounts to fatalism, a gay and even perverse fatalism, since its adherents call any attack on these parasitic growths meddlesome and inimical to \\u2018life\\u2019 \\u2014 as if life in a language were not simply the power to remain intelligible over wide areas and reasonably long periods of time.\\u201d Fair enough.\", \"But he felt that there were grounds for pruning English of certain words as almost vulgar in their unnecessariness, at least in his view. For example, he considered \\u201cabsenteeism\\u201d a word \\u201cmisused\\u201d when describing \\u201cabsences from work,\\u201d even though if anything today, this is the readiest association the word elicits. As to \\u201cevaluate,\\u201d he disliked that it was used for \\u201ceverything at every turn,\\u201d which reminds me of a caller to a radio show that asked listeners which words most annoyed them in 2021. The caller chose \\u201calgorithm\\u201d because it seems to be used so often for so many subjects. In other words, he was merely weary of hearing it.\", \"Intriguingly, Barzun, brilliant and insightful though he was, saw his take on constructions and expressions such as \\u201che dont\\u201d as compatible with his contrasting take on isolated words such as \\u201cevaluate.\\u201d \\u201cOddly enough,\\u201d he wrote, \\u201cthe same Americans who do not hesitate to confuse, misuse, duplicate, and miscegenate words remain absurdly conventional about grammar.\\u201d For Barzun, \\u201che dont\\u201d? Yes. \\u201cEvaluate\\u201d? No.\", \"The last thing I intend is to single Barzun out for judgments on language that don\\u2019t stand the test of time. I found his article interesting only as a demonstration of a pattern, exemplified by legions in the past and legions even now, including me.\", \"Go back to 18th century and Robert Lowth, an Anglican bishop and pioneering grammarian of the English language, wrote what he intended as a guide to proper usage, including \\u201cspitten\\u201d as the past participle of \\u201cspit,\\u201d as in \\u201cI have spitten.\\u201d How usable is that now? A century later, Richard Grant White was seen as an authority on how to write and speak. Among the words he didn\\u2019t like was \\u201cstandpoint.\\u201d But when you boil down his reasoning, it was because when you said it you weren\\u2019t actually standing anywhere!\", \"We are all, always and forever, all but unable to see ourselves from a distance and perceive how trivial that which irks us is in the grand scheme of things, that scheme which is so hard to see or feel.\", \"And for all that we may think that we get that, we ought to evaluate quite carefully the commonly enumerated \\u2014 nay, lamented \\u2014 language pet peeves that I so often hear about, such as the verb \\u201cliaise\\u201d inferred from the noun \\u201cliaison.\\u201d We must reassess any discomfort with those who refer to \\u201cex-presso\\u201d instead of mimicking the Italian pronunciation \\u201cess-presso,\\u201d especially considering that far fewer take umbrage at anyone calling croissants \\u201ccruh-sahnts\\u201d rather than \\u201ccrwa-sawhns,\\u201d which few Anglophones who didn\\u2019t happen to study French find natural. If \\u201cet cetera\\u201d shouldn\\u2019t be pronounced \\u201ceck setera,\\u201d then why don\\u2019t we say \\u201cvee-chay versa\\u201d or even \\u201cvee-kay versa\\u201d for \\u201cvice versa\\u201d?\", \"The thing to remember is that someone as erudite as Barzun evaluated the word cheeseburger as unwelcome.\", \"Rarely are our language peeves of a kind that would stand the test of time any better. And that includes supposed concerns about clarity: Some 19th-century pedants once advised that the constructions \\u201cthe first two\\u201d and \\u201cthe two first\\u201d were both potentially correct \\u2014 but \\u2014 what you call \\u201cthe first two\\u201d things have would have to be ones that form a united pair; otherwise, when simply referring to the first and second things of a series, you were to say \\u201cthe two first.\\u201d For clarity, you see. That peeve came and went, and here we are. It\\u2019s the reason for that permissiveness among linguists that perplexes so many.\"]","href_hash":"132e22e06db011ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"132e22e06db011ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
