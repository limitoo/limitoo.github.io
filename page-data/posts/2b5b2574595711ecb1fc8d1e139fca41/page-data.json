But doing so will be much harder after its fund-raising came up short and if its stock remains depressed.\", \"At it current share price, BuzzFeed, which bought HuffPost last year, has a market value of $775 million.\", \"BuzzFeed\\u2019s difficult first week will send a chill through the boardrooms of other digital media companies that have been hoping to go public or raise new money.\", \"The speed and depth of the decline in BuzzFeed\\u2019s stock may in part be because there is a small number of shares available to trade.
