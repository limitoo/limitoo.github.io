We\\u2019ll look at what Mayor-elect Eric Adams said about his plans for his administration \\u2014 and what his sense of style says about him. We\\u2019ll also look at where Republicans made unexpected inroads in local races.\", \"Eric Adams tacitly acknowledged that challenges lie ahead as he took a victory lap on Wednesday, appearing on early-morning television programs.\", \"He said on WPIX-TV that he would have to \\u201cdeal with the perception and the actualization of crime.\\u201d He repeated an argument he had made during the campaign that controlling crime was \\u201cthe prerequisite to prosperity.\\u201d\", \"And, perhaps with an eye to the potential $5 billion deficit he may inherit, he complained about municipal dysfunction. \\u201cWe hemorrhage too much money,\\u201d he declared, saying that \\u201cwe create our crises\\u201d but do not treat the causes.\", \"That was about an hour after he told MSNBC that he planned to be progressive and practical.\", \"\\u201cListen, you can be as philosophical as you want,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI am not going to be a philosophical mayor. I\\u2019m going to be a mayor that\\u2019s going to be a G.S.D. mayor, \\u2018get stuff done.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Later, on the phone with my colleague Emma Fitzsimmons, he re-emphasized his campaign commitment to improving public safety, citing two examples of what \\u201cgetting stuff done\\u201d would look like in his first 100 days in office. He said he intended to address the crisis at the Rikers jail complex by making some immediate changes like separating gang members, and he would bring back a plainclothes police unit that was disbanded last year.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not anti-crime, but an anti-gun unit,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s having well-trained officers who are going to use their body cameras so that we can see their interactions.\\u201d\", \"Adams, who breezed to victory on Tuesday, will now start building a leadership team. He has picked Sheena Wright, the president and chief executive of United Way of New York City, to lead his transition team. He has been focused on two key positions: police commissioner and schools chancellor. He has promised to hire the city\\u2019s first female police commissioner.\", \"One big unknown is who will be the next City Council speaker. Several of his allies are running for the job; Adams said he would let the Council make the choice on its own.\", \"\\u201cNo matter who it is, I\\u2019m going to work with them,\\u201d he said.\", \"But first, he will fly to Puerto Rico for a gathering of New York elected officials and lobbyists staged by the nonprofit Somos. He will also visit the Dominican Republic.\", \"Adams easily defeated Curtis Sliwa, the Republican nominee, on Tuesday. Sliwa\\u2019s wife, Nancy, also posted an Election Day loss. She ran for City Council on the Upper West Side, but the Democrat in the race, Gale Brewer, the Manhattan borough president, got 87 percent of the vote.\", \"Adams pays a lot of attention to what he wears. Our chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, says you should, too. He is more than willing to use clothes to stand out \\u2014 as he did when he wore a bright red blazer to a Hamptons fund-raiser in August or when he posted a photograph of himself in a new Midtown tower with his aviators reflecting the gleam of the building.\", \"\\u201cWhether he\\u2019s talking or not, he\\u2019s always saying something with his dress,\\u201d said George Arzt, a Democratic political consultant who was also Mayor Ed Koch\\u2019s press secretary. \\u201cAnd it\\u2019s: \\u2018I\\u2019m here. I\\u2019m in charge. I mean business.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Adams won easily. But my colleagues Katie Glueck and Nicholas Fandos write that Republicans landed blows in other races, from City Council contests in Queens and Brooklyn to the district attorneys\\u2019 elections on Long Island.\", \"And in Buffalo, India Walton, a democratic socialist whom left-wing leaders considered a rising progressive star, conceded to Mayor Byron Brown. He ran as a write-in candidate with Republican backing after she defeated him in the June primary.\", \"Democrats\\u2019 hopes of flipping a City Council seat in Queens fizzled when Felicia Singh, a teacher who had been endorsed by the left-wing Working Families Party, lost to Joann Ariola, the Queens Republican leader, by more than 35 percentage points.\", \"A closely watched race in Brooklyn ended with Inna Vernikov, a Republican who had the support of Donald Trump Jr., defeating the better-funded Democratic candidate, Steve Saperstein. And on Staten Island, David Carr, a Republican, trounced Sal Albanese, a transplanted former Brooklyn City Council member, by almost 2 to 1.\", \"Nowhere did Republicans turn in a stronger showing than on Long Island, where they won both district attorneys\\u2019 seats and where Laura Curran, the Nassau County executive, trailed her Republican challenger, Bruce Blakeman.\", \"\\u201cLong Island is very much like the rest of the country: There was a red wave,\\u201d said Jay Jacobs, the chairman of the New York State Democratic Committee who also leads the party in Nassau County. \\u201cRepublicans were energized because they\\u2019re angry and they\\u2019re unhappy with the direction of the country.\\u201d\", \"Democrats had also expected easy passage of amendments to the state Constitution that would have cleared the way for no-excuse absentee voting and same-day voter registration, But they were voted down.\", \"Gov. Philip Murphy was re-elected in New Jersey after an unexpectedly close race. Murphy became the first Democratic governor to win a second term in 44 years, defeating Jack Ciattarelli, a Republican who made Murphy\\u2019s tough policies on the pandemic a defining issue in the campaign.\", \"Gov. Kathy Hochul did not go back to the drawing board with one of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo\\u2019s signature projects; she merely scaled it down. She opted not to add more tracks to Penn Station, even though many transit experts consider extra rail capacity there essential to improve New York\\u2019s transit infrastructure. Her plan also modestly shrinks the size of 10 new towers that will be built nearby and adds below-market residential units.\", \"She said she thought the station should be renamed, possibly after a New Yorker, rather than for a \\u201cneighboring state.\\u201d In fact, the station was named for its original owner, the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, which operated until 1968.\", \"The renaming idea prompted suggestions on Twitter that included Shirley Chisholm; Dr. Zizmor, of the famed subway skin-care advertisements; the Naked Cowboy, a habitu\\u00e9 of Times Square; Andrew Cuomo, her predecessor; his father, Mario Cuomo, the governor from 1983 to 1994; and \\u201cIf Hell Had a Hell Station.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s another sunny day, New York, with temps in the low 50s dropping to the 40s at night.\", \"Suspended today (Diwali).\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"I was cycling eastward across a quiet Williamsburg Bridge just after midnight when I noticed a glowing smartphone on the pavement.\", \"I stopped, picked it up and then continued to climb my way over the bridge. I peeked at the device to see if I could figure out whose it was.\", \"Then it hit me that if I did figure it out, I would probably end up having to meet the person someplace, and to do that we would have to plan and text and so on.\", \"So I decided I had to get rid of it, and by then I had reached the juncture on the bridge that divides cyclists from pedestrians.\", \"A man and a woman were standing there, and because I had decided to shift this sudden burden of mine onto them, I figured I might as well be unfriendly about it.\", \"\\u201cI found this smartphone back there,\\u201d I said, pointing toward Manhattan. \\u201cBut I don\\u2019t want it, so I\\u2019m going to leave it here.\\u201d\", \"I placed the phone onto the pavement and had started to pedal off when I heard the man speak.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s mine,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThanks so much.\\u201d\", \"\\u2014 Thomas Carrow\", \"Illustrated by Agnes Lee.
