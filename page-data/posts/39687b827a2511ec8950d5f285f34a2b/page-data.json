How does Edgard Var\\u00e8se\\u2019s pensive \\u201cOctandre\\u201d sound alongside Scott Joplin\\u2019s \\u201cMaple Leaf Rag\\u201d?\", \"These aren\\u2019t questions most audiences have ever been asked to consider. But the answers might permit a fuller understanding of the broad range of American music in the first half of the 20th century, a period when this country began to export its own brand of sound.\", \"Unusual but telling juxtapositions abound in \\u201cThe Making of an American Music, 1899-1948,\\u201d this year\\u2019s Focus festival at the Juilliard School, which opens for a week of performances on Sunday. Each year Focus zeros in on a specific topic in modern music; the 2022 iteration brings together \\u2014 and demonstrates the substantial overlap between \\u2014 worlds not often united in the history books or on concert programs: ragtime, jazz, Broadway, Americana, global music, dance and the Europe-descended avant-garde.\", \"Joel Sachs, the festival\\u2019s organizer and the longtime doyen of new music at Juilliard, said that \\u201cThe Making of an American Music\\u201d emerged out of brainstorming for the 2021 festival. With a presidential inauguration then looming, he thought of 1921, the start of Warren G. Harding\\u2019s term, and its implications for international affairs.\", \"\\u201cMusic in times of trouble\\u201d was to have been the theme, Sachs said by phone recently, with a week focusing on the two decades from the end of the First World War to the eve of the Second, including politically charged pieces by the likes of Charles Ives, Stefan Wolpe and Hanns Eisler. But Sachs hadn\\u2019t gotten past rough plans before the festival was canceled because of the pandemic.\", \"\\u201cThen came 2021,\\u201d he said, \\u201cand things beginning to look better, and a sense we might be getting out of this situation, which turned out to be not quite right. But I started to think that was too gloomy a subject.\\u201d\", \"He turned his attention specifically to the American repertory, and, using the enormous New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, put down all the composers writing in the first 50 years of the 20th century; there were almost 300 names. He and David Ludwig, the new dean and director of Juilliard\\u2019s music division, then independently drew on that for lists of 15 \\u201cmusts\\u201d and 15 \\u201cmaybes.\\u201d (Their top tiers, as it happened, were almost identical.)\", \"\\u201cIt blossomed into a kind of monster,\\u201d Sachs said, chuckling. \\u201cThe program book is 88 pages. But it\\u2019s a really interesting period.\\u201d\", \"These are the six Focus programs, starting on Sunday evening:\", \"A set of Joplin\\u2019s rags \\u2014 the phenomenally popular sheet music for \\u201cMaple Leaf Rag\\u201d helped put American music on the global map \\u2014 leads directly into two of Ives\\u2019s bustling, changeable Ragtime Dances, performed by Sachs\\u2019 New Juilliard Ensemble. The rapidly shifting moods of the dances will offer a new context for the similarly jittery \\u201cOctandre,\\u201d written for a small group of winds and brasses and ending in a bright scream. Var\\u00e8se, a native Frenchman, spent the last 50 years of his life in America, and his influence here made him a natural for this Focus.\", \"Sachs wrote a biography of Henry Cowell, who was part of a circle of experimental composers with Var\\u00e8se, and whose brooding Sinfonietta follows \\u201cOctandre.\\u201d Ruth Crawford was also part of the group, and the program includes her angular \\u201cThree Songs to Poems by Carl Sandburg,\\u201d before closing with Ives\\u2019s Third Symphony, \\u201cThe Camp Meeting,\\u201d a characteristically Ivesian explosion of European styles and 19th-century Americana.\", \"The military marches of John Philip Sousa, a major American presence in Europe during this period, are rarely heard alongside modernists like Milton Babbitt and Leon Kirchner, and Amy Beach\\u2019s String Quartet is rarely heard, period. Beach\\u2019s warm, thickly chromatic, intensely elegant single-movement quartet \\u2014 which incorporates, after the model of Dvorak, the Native American melodies \\u201cSummer Song,\\u201d \\u201cPlaying at Ball\\u201d and \\u201cItitaujang\\u2019s Song\\u201d \\u2014 looks both backward and forward.\", \"The quartet and chamber works by Babbitt, Kirchner, Conlon Nancarrow (best known for his wild player-piano studies) and Virgil Thomson lead, however unexpectedly, to Sousa\\u2019s \\u201cThe Stars and Stripes Forever,\\u201d represented by Vladimir Horowitz\\u2019s virtuosic \\u2014 and, in this company, truly progressive-sounding \\u2014 piano arrangement.\", \"Among the week\\u2019s most intriguing rediscoveries is \\u201cDeep Song,\\u201d a Martha Graham solo that she first danced in 1937 as a cri de coeur during the Spanish Civil War. The score, by Cowell, was lost, so when the dance was revived in the 1980s, it was with another Cowell piece.\", \"The correct music \\u2014 created using an innovative technique that let the choreographer rearrange modular phrases as needed \\u2014 was rediscovered in the early 2000s. So this collaboration with Terese Capucilli, a Graham expert who teaches at Juilliard, will be the modern premiere of a substantial re-creation of the original, set alongside chamber works by John Cage, Walter Piston, Roger Sessions and Aaron Copland.\", \"A very brief history of the transition from ragtime to jazz \\u2014 including pieces by Eubie Blake, Mary Lou Williams, James P. Johnson and Duke Ellington \\u2014 is the climax of a program that also includes an aria from Gian Carlo Menotti\\u2019s popular opera \\u201cThe Medium,\\u201d William Grant Still\\u2019s eloquent \\u201cIncantation and Dance\\u201d for oboe and piano, and works by Vincent Persichetti, Wolpe and Elliott Carter.\", \"Refractions of other cultures by Colin McPhee (drawing on Balinese melodies) and Alan Hovhaness (on the kanun, an Armenian zither) join a two-piano arrangement of Carl Ruggles\\u2019s \\u201cOrganum\\u201d and the slow movement of Samuel Barber\\u2019s Op. 11 String Quartet, which he later arranged as the famous Adagio for Strings.\", \"The \\u201cFestival Prelude\\u201d for organ by Horatio Parker, Ives\\u2019s teacher at Yale, is delightfully paired with Ives\\u2019s own nutty organ variations on \\u201cAmerica\\u201d; Harrison\\u2019s cembalo sonatas; and a sampling of Broadway songs by Berlin, Kern, Porter and Rodgers \\u2014 capped by a two-piano version of Gershwin\\u2019s variations on \\u201cI Got Rhythm.\\u201d\", \"The culminating event features, as usual, the Juilliard Orchestra, the school\\u2019s main symphonic ensemble; Mei-Ann Chen, the music director of the Chicago Sinfonietta, conducts. Joplin is once again on the program, in the form of the lively overture to his 1910 opera \\u201cTreemonisha,\\u201d which was first staged in 1972 and for which he was posthumously awarded a Pulitzer Prize.\", \"Another long-overlooked composer, Florence Price, is represented by her lyrical Violin Concerto No. 1, with Timothy Chooi as soloist. And Ives, that great masher of genres, closes this genre-mashing festival with his grandly impassioned Second Symphony, which weaves American songs and hymns throughout.\"]","href_hash":"39687b827a2511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"39687b827a2511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
