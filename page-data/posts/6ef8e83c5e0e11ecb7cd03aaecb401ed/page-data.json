These officers disregarded policy and instructions and failed in their duty to take care of Mr Ball, who was reliant on them to provide him with urgent assistance,\\\" authority chair Judge Colin Doherty said.\", \"On the night of his arrest, Ball's partner said he had threatened to harm himself before leaving the house.\", \"When police found him a short time later he was repeatedly asked if he had taken anything other than alcohol and he said he hadn't.\", \"His partner also said she did not believe his threat to harm himself was serious.\", \"After being arrested, Ball fell asleep on the way to H\\u0101wera police station, and when the police vehicle arrived officers could not rouse him.\", \"\\\"Six people carried him into the station on a blanket and placed him in the recovery position on a cell floor,\\\" the IPCA report said.\", \"At about 2.30am an officer found Ball's condition had deteriorated. Officers performed CPR and an ambulance was called, but he was pronounced dead a short time later.\", \"The IPCA investigation found that all the officers involved considered Ball to be merely intoxicated and failed to turn their minds to the possibility that he had taken anything other than alcohol.\", \"\\\"They should have given more consideration to Mr Ball's self-harm threat given his rapid decline into unresponsiveness,\\\" an IPCA media statement said.\", \"\\\"Officers should have taken Mr Ball directly to hospital rather than into the police station when he became unresponsive.
