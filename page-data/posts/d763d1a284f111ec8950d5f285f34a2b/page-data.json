The NRO plans to refly the booster on a downstream mission, tweeting \\\"this gives this core the ability to launch not one, but two NRO payloads into #space!\\\"\", \"The mission got underway at 3:27 p.m. EST when the Falcon 9's nine first stage engines ignited with a roar, pushing the rocket away from pad 4 at the Space Force base northwest of Los Angeles.\", \"The climb out of the lower atmosphere on a southerly trajectory went  smoothly and the first stage fell away as planned about two minutes and  20 seconds after liftoff. The second stage carrying the NROL-87  satellite continued toward space, but as usual with classified missions,  SpaceX ended its ascent commentary at that point.\", \"But the company provided spectacular video of the first stage's return to the launch site, firing three of its engines to reverse course and then again to slow down for descent into the thick lower atmosphere.\", \"A final single-engine firing lowered the stage to touchdown on four landing legs. It was SpaceX's 105th successful booster recovery, including 4 in California, 22 in Florida and 79 at sea.\", \"Next up: launch of 49 Starlink internet satellites Thursday from historic pad 39A at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. SpaceX has launched 2,042 Starlinks to date as the company builds out a globe-spanning constellation of commercial broadband relay stations.\", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News. He covered 129 space shuttle missions, every interplanetary flight since Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune and scores of commercial and military launches. Based at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Harwood is a devoted amateur astronomer and co-author of \\\"Comm Check: The Final Flight of Shuttle Columbia.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"d763d1a284f111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d763d1a284f111ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
