Rocah. Rocah's office initially announced they had convened a grand jury to review the charge in late October.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The District Attorney's Office reinvigorated its investigation into Robert Durst just 10 months ago when I took Office, launched the Cold Case Bureau, and dedicated the resources and skill that I thought this case deserved,\\\" Rocah said in a statement.\", \"A warrant has been issued for Durst's arrest. He was sentenced last month at the age of 78 to life in prison without parole after a jury found him guilty of the murder of Berman, a confidante whom prosecutors alleged helped him cover up Kathie Durst's killing. Los Angeles prosecutors say Durst shot her in 2000 before she could tell police.\", \"Investigators had long suspected Durst murdered his wife. Kathleen Durst was 29 when she vanished from her South Salem, New York, home on January 31, 1982.\", \"Her body was never found, but at the request of her family, she was declared legally dead in 2017.
