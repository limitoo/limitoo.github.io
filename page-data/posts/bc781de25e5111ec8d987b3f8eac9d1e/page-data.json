We\\u2019ll look at the moment when Eric Adams, the incoming mayor, found his police commissioner. We\\u2019ll also see why Thursday will be a big day for two city parks.\", \"The selection process that led to the choice of a new police commissioner included a mock news conference. The candidates were given a hypothetical situation \\u2014 a white New York City police officer had just shot and killed an unarmed Black man. Then they were asked what they would say if they had to face reporters.\", \"Keechant Sewell, the chief of detectives in Nassau County, got the attention of Eric Adams, the incoming mayor, with what she said \\u2014 and got the job.\", \"Others competing for the job recited the details of the shooting. Sewell began by acknowledging that someone had been killed.\", \"\\u201cThat made me sit up because she understood that there was a tragedy because a life was lost,\\u201d Adams said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what we have to understand.\\u201d\", \"Three of my colleagues \\u2014 Ashley Southall, Ali Watkins and Troy Closson \\u2014 write that Adams\\u2019s choice of Sewell will put her at the front of a movement to remake policing from within.\", \"This comes in the wake of last year\\u2019s protests against police brutality and systemic racism that were prompted by the persistence of police killings of Black people. It also comes as the city continues to struggle to add Black and female officers, who have long been underrepresented in the ranks and now account for about 15 and 18 percent of the force.\", \"It also fulfills Mr. Adams\\u2019s campaign promise to name a woman to lead the department where he served for 22 years.\", \"Even the location where he announced Sewell\\u2019s appointment was symbolic: the Queens headquarters of Community Capacity Development, an anti-violence organization that uses former gang members to defuse conflicts and prevent shootings. Adams has said that his administration will seek to work more with community organizations to give the public a greater role in helping the police to fight crime.\", \"Sewell is expected to play a major role in finding the balance that Adams wants to strike between community-led strategies and traditional policing practices, including some that Adams plans to reinstate, like the use of plainclothes units to target illegal guns.\", \"But that is hardly the only challenge she will face. Morale in the Police Department has sunk under the pressures of the pandemic, the protests and stalled efforts to arrive at a new contract with the union that represents its police officers. Sewell will also inherit a tense relationship with the City Council and State Legislature. Her predecessors were unusually vocal in their criticism of laws aimed at making the criminal justice system fairer, saying such measures put the police at a disadvantage and gave criminals the upper hand.\", \"Adams said on Wednesday that Sewell\\u2019s emotional intelligence and composure in handling the hypothetical shooting case had vaulted her past candidates who had attained higher ranks and had more experience. He said she had demonstrated that she has the capacity to lead in tough situations, from terror attacks to social unrest.\", \"\\u201cThose are the scenarios we\\u2019re going to be facing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHopefully we don\\u2019t have a shooting like that, but if we do, I need the police commissioner to stand in front of the room and let New Yorkers know we\\u2019re going to be all right, because it\\u2019s not only substantive, it\\u2019s the perception, right?\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s mostly cloudy with wind gusts and temps in the low 60s. Late in the evening, there\\u2019s a chance of rain as temps dip into the low 50s.\", \"In effect until Dec. 24 (Christmas Eve).\", \"Broadway, where performers long prided themselves on singing through strain and dancing through pain, has been rattled by Covid cancellations. \\u201cTina,\\u201d a jukebox musical about Tina Turner, canceled both of its performances on Wednesday, and \\u201cHarry Potter and the Cursed Child\\u201d canceled its matinee. Three other shows have canceled some performances this week.\", \"In each case, at least one member of the cast or crew tested positive. Either for lack of replacements or concern about contagion, performances were called off. As my colleague Michael Paulson writes, they were not the first, and almost certainly won\\u2019t be the last.\", \"It\\u2019s shaping up as an important day for two parks. Battery Park in Lower Manhattan will celebrate its new \\u201cplayscape\\u201d \\u2014 a playground three times the size of the one that was destroyed by Hurricane Sandy in 2012. And Prospect Park in Brooklyn will announce that the city is allocating $40 million to restore an area named by a long-ago mayor\\u2019s wife.\", \"The $18.3 million Battery Park project replaces a playground from the 1950s. \\u201cIt was unimaginative,\\u201d said Warrie Price, the president of the Battery Conservancy, the nonprofit group whose mission is to reinvigorate the Battery. \\u201cWhen I started to reach out to families to say what did they want in a new playground, they said, \\u2018We know how terrible this one was, but it had a lot of space to run and be totally safe.\\u2019 So many places are chockablock with equipment. They said keep the circulation. We\\u2019ve done that.\\u201d\", \"The new playground also has a improv and puppet theater, which Ms. Price said was the first at a playground in New York City. The project was designed by BKSK Architects and Starr Whitehouse Landscape Architects and Planners.\", \"As for Prospect Park, the Irish poet Thomas Moore asked: \\u201cWho has not heard of the Vale of Cashmere, with its roses the brightest that earth ever gave?\\u201d\", \"The Prospect Park Alliance, which runs the park, has heard of the Vale of Cashmere \\u2014 that was the name given to a part of the park by Grace Chapin, the wife of a 19th-century mayor of Brooklyn. The Vale of Cashmere is now a defunct reflecting pool filled with vegetation. It is not far from the Rose Garden, which Susan Donoghue, the president of the Prospect Park Alliance, said has not had any roses for years.\", \"That is about to change with the $40 million from the city for the restoration of the Vale and the Rose Garden. \\u201cThis area is a beautiful natural area, active with the birding community,\\u201d Donoghue said. \\u201cWe did a whole lot of outreach with the community. We said we have to hear what the public wants. What came back was people liked the contemplative nature of the space, the fact that it\\u2019s woodlands and it\\u2019s quiet. We want to respect and enhance that.\\u201d\", \"In tribute to a New York City institution, this week\\u2019s Metropolitan Diaries offers readers\\u2019 tales of encounters with Stephen Sondheim.\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"One Sunday night in the early 1980s, I dropped by my office on Park Avenue and 48th Street. As I was heading across Park Avenue to a parking garage in my small two-seater, a car ran a red light and T-boned me.\", \"My car was crushed, and I was pretty shaken up. The police came to the scene. The other driver told the officers that I had run the light.\", \"There were three people on a nearby corner who had seen the whole thing. Without hesitating, one approached the officers. He told them what he had witnessed and confirmed my story: The other driver had run a red light before crashing into me.\", \"Still shaken, I approached the man and thanked him. He was reserved, humble and forthcoming. I asked for his name and phone number in case my insurance company needed to contact him. It was only when he told me his name that I learned this witness was Stephen Sondheim. Extraordinary!\", \"The insurance company said later that the other driver\\u2019s claim had been closed because of the witness\\u2019s account. I called Mr. Sondheim to thank him again for stepping forward.\", \"He asked how I was feeling.\", \"\\u2014 Barry A. Bryer\", \"Illustrated by Agnes Lee.
