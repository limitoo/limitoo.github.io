With fast-track visas and promises of permanent residency, many wealthy nations are sending a message: Help wanted. Now.\", \"The push is especially focused on immigrants with skills that fall somewhere between physical labor and specialized higher education.\", \"A new Immigration Act in Germany offers accelerated work visas and six months to visit and find a job. Officials had warned that the country needs 400,000 new immigrants a year to fill jobs in a range of fields from academia to air-conditioning work.\", \"Canada plans to give residency to 1.2 million new immigrants by 2023. Israel recently finalized a deal to bring health care workers from Nepal. And in Australia, where mines, hospitals and pubs are all short-handed after nearly two years with a closed border, the government intends to roughly double the number of immigrants it allows into the country over the next year.\", \"Big picture: By keeping so many people in place, the pandemic has made demographic imbalances more obvious \\u2014 rapidly aging rich nations produce too few new workers, while countries with a surplus of young people often lack work for all.\", \"What\\u2019s next: Many developed nations are building more sophisticated immigration programs, while the U.S. is stuck in place. The Biden administration is first trying to unclog what\\u2019s already there: Its social policy bill would free up hundreds of thousands of green cards dating back to 1992.\", \"Here are the latest Covid updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other news:\", \"The U.S., Britain, China, India, Japan and Korea are going to release tens of millions of barrels of crude oil to combat soaring global prices.\", \"In the U.S., President Biden ordered the release from the nation\\u2019s emergency stockpile of crude, the largest in the world, amid a jump in gas prices. It comes after Biden pushed OPEC to increase production, but was rebuffed. The OPEC Plus nations may reconsider at their meeting next week after such a coordinated release.\", \"It remains unclear how much it will impact the price of oil. Traders had been expecting a larger release of as much as 100 million barrels, said Richard Bronze, head of geopolitics at Energy Aspects, a market research firm. China, he said, is holding off announcing on Tuesday.\", \"Details: The U.S. will tap into 50 million barrels. Bronze estimated that India will contribute up to five million barrels, and that Japan and South Korea will add another four million to five million barrels each. Britain said it would authorize the release of up to 1.5 million barrels.\", \"The crunch: Oil-producing nations cut output as demand fell early in the pandemic. In the U.S., the oil rig count was down nearly 70 percent in summer 2020.\", \"Rising prices and a weakened currency are straining households in Pakistan. Inflation surged 9.2 percent in October from the year before.\", \"While the strain is expected to ease as bottlenecks of the global supply chain are unsnarled, Pakistan feels it can\\u2019t wait. The government on Monday announced an agreement with the International Monetary Fund for the first $1 billion of what is expected to be a $6 billion rescue package.\", \"Protests have broken out across the country in recent weeks, shifting regional politics, and everyone from small shop owners to banks have felt the squeeze of the supply and inflation crisis combined with a longstanding government debt.\", \"The government has chased loans from Saudi Arabia, which pledged $4.2 billion in cash assistance, and from China.\", \"Risks: The government, under Prime Minister Imran Khan, has distributed cash to 20 million of Pakistan\\u2019s poorest families and subsidized the cost of grains, legumes and cooking oil. If Pakistan finalizes an agreement with the I.M.F., it will have to tighten its purse strings, which could hurt Khan politically.\", \"Context: Pakistanis have seen standard gas prices jump 34 percent in the last six months, to about 146 rupees a liter.\", \"Our reporters were at the opening of Britain\\u2019s first Popeyes fried chicken in London. Britons who tried out the southern American fast food joint were surprised to find that the biscuits served with the chicken were not the kind they were used to. \\u201cIt looks like a scone,\\u201d said one woman, \\u201cbut it doesn\\u2019t taste like one.\\u201d\", \"Lives lived: Chun Doo-hwan, South Korea\\u2019s most vilified former military dictator, died at 90. He ruled with an iron fist for most of the 1980s.\", \"Whether your literary habits include sci-fi, poetry or nonfiction, The Times Book Review\\u2019s annual roundup of 100 notable books includes options for you. \\u201cWe whittled down an initial list of something like 500 books,\\u201d Gregory Cowles, who helped edit the project, said. Here\\u2019s a sample:\", \"Fiction: \\u201cStrange Beasts of China,\\u201d by Yan Ge, is an enchanting novel about a cryptozoologist pursuing fabled creatures.\", \"Memoir: \\u201cSomebody\\u2019s Daughter,\\u201d by Ashley C. Ford, begins with a phone call in which the author learns that her father is coming home after almost 30 years in prison.\", \"Nonfiction: \\u201cA Little Devil in America: Notes in Praise of Black Performance,\\u201d by Hanif Abdurraqib, makes powerful observations about race through music, television, film, minstrel shows and vaudeville.\", \"Stories: \\u201cAfterparties,\\u201d by Anthony Veasna So, is a deeply personal, frankly funny and illuminating debut about Cambodian life in California, published eight months after the author\\u2019s death at 28.\", \"Make sheet-pan chicken chilaquiles.\", \"These six podcasts about unsolved mysteries.\", \"Ever think of retiring to Italy? Here\\u2019s how one couple did it.\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: \\u201cAs a matter of ___ \\u2026\\u201d (four letters).\", \"And here is today\\u2019s Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.
