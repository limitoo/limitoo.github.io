However, two months after the criminal mystery first sparked national headlines, law enforcement officials still consider the investigation open and active.\", \"Laundrie, who remains the sole person of interest in Petito's death, was found dead on October 20 near Florida's Carlton Reserve after a monthslong search by local police and the FBI.\", \"The discovery came more than a month after Petito was reported missing by her family. She was later found dead near Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming. An autopsy determined that she died from strangulation after traveling on a cross-country road trip with Laundrie, who returned home to Florida without her in September.\", \"Though police were quick to name Laundrie a person of interest in her death, the FBI has yet to officially name him as her killer, NewsNation Now reported. Local and federal law enforcement officials are still working to piece together exactly what happened to the couple as they traveled across the country in a van and documented their adventures on social media.\", \"\\\"We can surmise, we make an assumption, but right now the responsible party for the homicide of Gabby Petito, arguably, is still unsolved,\\\" former FBI special agent and attorney Stuart Kaplan told People magazine in October.\", \"Laundrie's skeletal remains and some items, including a notebook and backpack he owned, were uncovered by police, but investigative efforts were made difficult by the fact that his body was found in a location that had been underwater.\", \"An initial autopsy on his body was inconclusive in determining the cause of death, prompting officials to send his body to an anthropologist for further evaluation. The results of that report have not yet been released but could come as soon as November 23 or 24, according to NewsNation Now reporter Brian Entin.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1938700/gabby-petito.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The investigation into Gabby Petito's death reportedly remains open and active, with the FBI not naming her deceased fianc\\u00e9, Brian Laundrie, as the person responsible.

You can imagine it may be a long, tedious process, but they can do it,\\\" Coffindaffer told NewsNation Now.\", \"Eventually, Coffindaffer added, the bureau will likely make an official announcement regarding the outcome of the case.\", \"\\\"The FBI will release some sort of presser indicating who they believe was responsible for this crime,\\\" Coffindaffer said.\"]","href_hash":"cdbdddf54c8211ec8c95a3d4ab45c753"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cdbdddf54c8211ec8c95a3d4ab45c753"}},
