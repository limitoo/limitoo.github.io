According to the producer Thor Sigurjonsson in notes provided for journalists, his death occurred late in the filmmaking process, just before \\u201cwe were about to start on the final music.\\u201d\", \"Yet even describing \\u201cLast and First Men\\u201d as a movie, while accurate, is misleading; it often feels closer to a literary exercise or fine-art photography. (A live, multimedia version was shown in 2017.) It combines a complex, \\u201cDune\\u201d-like mythology with the sonorous, hypnotic line readings of the British essay films of Patrick Keiller (\\u201cRobinson in Ruins\\u201d).\", \"Based on the 1930 science fiction novel by Olaf Stapledon, the film mainly consists of 16-millimeter black-and-white images of abandoned monuments, identified in the credits as being in the Balkans. No humans appear. While the camera surveys the asymmetries of the monolithic sculptures, often pondering the sky through negative space in the stonework, Tilda Swinton delivers a voice-over that begins with an epic poem-style invocation (\\u201clisten patiently\\u201d) and is framed as a dispatch from two billion years from now, when our descendants, bracing for extinction, share a telepathic hive mind and have appearances that would look grotesque to us.\", \"The landscape, with the occasional sight of a bird or a cloud streak from an airplane, pierces the illusion that we\\u2019re observing the colonized Neptune that Swinton speaks of. Color \\u2014 in the green of an oscilloscope or in the fiery hues of the sun \\u2014 intermittently punctures the monochrome. And Johannsson\\u2019s stark, uncompromising passion project is always striking to the eye even in moments when the narrative lulls.\"]","href_hash":"e1c5cfa158e911ec860041a44871c280"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e1c5cfa158e911ec860041a44871c280"}},
