Plus: A roundup of the best reviews of “And Just Like That.”","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-10T14:30:35.000Z","content":"[\"So is Samantha just a handbag now?\", \"Early Thursday morning, the first two episodes of \\u201cAnd Just Like That\\u201d arrived on HBO Max, heralding the click-clack return of the \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d universe, the first new installment since the misbegotten 2010 film \\u201cSex and the City 2.\\u201d Kim Cattrall had already departed the franchise, declining to return for a planned third film. Trailers for this new series had failed to explain the absence of her character, Samantha. Fans noted a ladies-who-lunch scene, in which the chair normally reserved for Samantha is instead occupied by a blond bucket purse and an Oscar de la Renta garment bag. Cold.\", \"The first moments of the first episode, which checks in on Sarah Jessica Parker\\u2019s Carrie, Cynthia Nixon\\u2019s Miranda and Kristin Davis\\u2019s Charlotte in their mid-50s, quickly explain Samantha\\u2019s disappearance. So if you can tolerate a small spoiler, read on. And if you can stomach a much, much bigger one, read even further.\", \"While waiting for their table, the women run into Bitsy von Muffling (a beloved character played by the equally beloved Julie Halston). When Bitsy asks after Samantha, they reveal that Samantha has moved to London for work. (Is this a sneaky nod to reality? Cattrall herself spends a lot of time on the London stage.)\", \"\\u201cSexy sirens in their 60s are still viable over there,\\u201d Bitsy says approvingly.\", \"In a post-lunch scene, Carrie and Miranda discuss the estrangement. The state of the book business meant that Carrie no longer needed a personal publicist. And when she let Samantha go professionally, Samantha fired her as a friend. All of the women have called and texted, but Samantha has never responded. This conversation seems to allude, elliptically, to the rumored real-life feud between Parker and Cattrall. Elle has an exhaustive timeline of it, which begins in the 2000s with some veiled comments about pay disparities, continues through the 2010s when Cattrall declines to do the third movie and climaxes in 2018, in the most 2018 way imaginable \\u2014 with some extremely heated Instagram exchanges.\", \"\\u201cI always thought the four of us would be friends forever,\\u201d Carrie says wistfully. Oh well. (Somewhat less charitably, she also says: \\u201cI thought I was more to her than an ATM.\\u201d)\", \"Without Samantha\\u2019s libertine ways, this new version has a more somber feel, underscored by a big twist that comes at the end of the first episode. In an article previewing the new series, the showrunner Michael Patrick King told The Times, \\u201cNobody\\u2019s dead. Nobody.\\u201d That\\u2019s only true for about half an hour.\", \"That scrapped third movie was rumored to have begun with Carrie\\u2019s husband Big (Chris Noth) having a heart attack in the shower. Noth denied it at the time, but that\\u2019s how the first episode ends. Well, technically the heart attack is shower-adjacent, but still. Samantha sends an elegant casket spray to the funeral, signaling a rapprochement. Or it could be that associating the character with a coffin indicates something darker.\", \"There are other changes, too, like the inclusion of four new characters of color played by Sarita Choudhury, Nicole Ari Parker, Karen Pittman and Sara Ram\\u00edrez. The first episodes introduce those latter three characters, Choudhury\\u2019s high-end real estate agent arrives later. (And while Willie Garson\\u2019s Stanford Blatch is in the first several episodes, Garson died during filming, so the creators have devised a brisk exit.) Carrie co-hosts a podcast now. Miranda has traded corporate law for human rights work. Charlotte is pretty much still Charlotte. The heels? Quite high. The reviews? Pretty mixed.\", \"\\u2018Review: \\u201cAnd Just Like That,\\u201d It All Went Wrong\\u2019 (The New York Times)\", \"In a muted review, James Poniewozik argues that the revival is really two shows, which don\\u2019t seem especially well integrated. \\u201cOne, which tries to grow with the women as they navigate their 50s and mortality, is a downer,\\u201d he writes, \\u201cbut it takes risks and in moments is very good. The other, which tries to update its sassy turn-of-the-century sensibility for an era of diversity, is painful.\\u201d\", \"\\u2018\\u201cAnd Just Like That\\u201d is \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d for 2021: A bloated, laugh-free comedy about grief\\u2019 (The Washington Post)\", \"The Washington Post ran a riotously negative review of the original \\u201cSex and the City.\\u201d (See below.) And Inkoo Kang hates the revival, too, even as her analysis avoids the misogyny of that earlier critique. \\u201cThis year has been a bummer, and so is the sequel series,\\u201d she writes.

Parker is particularly articulate when discussing the culture around women and age. \\u201cIt almost feels as if people don\\u2019t want us to be perfectly OK with where we are, as if they almost enjoy us being pained by who we are today, whether we choose to age naturally and not look perfect, or whether you do something if that makes you feel better,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI know what I look like.
