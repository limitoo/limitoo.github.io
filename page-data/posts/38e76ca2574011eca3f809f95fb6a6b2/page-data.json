Today we\\u2019ll look at Mayor Bill de Blasio\\u2019s vaccine mandate for private businesses. We\\u2019ll also look at whether Eric Adams will enforce it after he succeeds de Blasio on Jan. 1.\", \"All employees in New York City, from bodega owners to banking executives, will be required to get vaccinated against the coronavirus under a plan that Mayor Bill de Blasio announced.\", \"My colleague Emma Fitzsimmons writes that this is the most sweeping local mandate in the country. De Blasio called the mandate a \\u201cpre-emptive strike\\u201d amid rising case counts and concerns about the new Omicron variant. \\u201cWe cannot let Covid back in the door again,\\u201d he said.\", \"The mandate will apply to roughly 184,000 businesses. It is set to take effect on Dec. 27, days before de Blasio leaves office. It is almost certain to face legal challenges and pose new hurdles for employers responsible for enforcing it \\u2014 and for the next mayor, Eric Adams. He has not said whether he supports this kind of mandate, although he has generally supported de Blasio\\u2019s earlier vaccine requirements for city workers and his approach to indoor dining.\", \"It was not clear if Adams would enforce de Blasio\\u2019s edict or defend it from potential legal challenges. Adams, who has said that he is fully vaccinated and has had a booster shot, is on vacation. His spokesman, Evan Thies, said in a statement that Adams will evaluate de Blasio\\u2019s mandate once he takes over at City Hall. De Blasio said he had briefed the mayor-elect on his mandate plans twice, once before and once during Adams\\u2019s current trip.\", \"\\u201cHe has been tremendously clear that he respects the health care professionals and their guidance,\\u201d de Blasio said.\", \"[New York City to Mandate Vaccines for Employees at Private Businesses]\", \"Some business owners reacted with shrugs. Others said that to keep their employees and their customers safe, they already had their own mandates in effect. Still others raised concerns about how difficult the new mandate would be to enforce and how they had received no word that it was coming.\", \"\\u201cWe were blindsided,\\u201d said Kathryn Wylde, the president of the Partnership for New York City, a prominent business group.\", \"De Blasio did not say whether, under the new mandate, businesses would face fines if they failed to comply. Nor did he spell out how it would be administered. Under the mandate for municipal workers that took effect last month, the city had the power to put unvaccinated employees on leave.\", \"Some retail workers questioned the rationale of requiring vaccinations for employees but not customers. And Andy Churchill, the brand director of Canine Styles, a pet grooming salon on the Upper West Side, questioned the mayor\\u2019s decision to put the mandate into effect just before turning City Hall over to Eric Adams.\", \"\\u201cI think it\\u2019s de Blasio\\u2019s last-ditch effort to go out with a bang,\\u201d he said.\", \"It\\u2019s a mostly sunny day, with temps in the high 30s. The evening will be mostly cloudy with temperatures dropping to the low 30s, and there\\u2019s a slim chance of snow during the night.\", \"In effect today. Suspended tomorrow (Immaculate Conception).\", \"Max Rose announced that he would run for his old seat in Congress. Rose is a moderate Democrat who lost by six percentage points last year in a conservative district that includes Staten Island as well as part of Brooklyn.\", \"Representative Nicole Malliotakis, who defeated him, is a Republican who has tied herself to former President Donald J. Trump. Republicans signaled on Monday that they will once again assail Rose, an Army veteran who was awarded a Purple Heart and a Bronze Star for injuries he suffered in Afghanistan and a critic of the \\u201cdefund the police\\u201d movement, as too radical.\", \"The race could become one of the Democrats\\u2019 more promising opportunities for picking up a seat next year, depending on how the state draws the borders for the congressional district.\", \"There is water, water everywhere around New York, from the Atlantic Ocean to narrow little creeks. There is also water underground, in streams that were buried as streets and sewer pipes were laid and buildings went up.\", \"Now the city is looking to bring one subterranean stream back to the surface as part of an ambitious green infrastructure project.\", \"As my colleagues Winnie Hu and James Thomas explain, one goal is to prevent another flood like the one after Hurricane Ida, when the stream in question \\u2014 Tibbetts Brook in the Bronx \\u2014 poured onto the Major Deegan Expressway, stranding dozens of cars, buses and trucks. Another goal is to reduce pollution in the Harlem River from sewer overflows.\", \"The $130 million project would unearth Tibbetts Brook, an engineering feat known as \\u201cdaylighting.\\u201d Environmentalists and local activists have campaigned to unearth it for years. A changing climate with more frequent and intense storms is now making it necessary. Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic majority leader, has said he will work with city officials to arrange funding from the $1 trillion infrastructure deal and federal pandemic relief money.\", \"Submerging Tibbetts Brook did not stop the 2.2 billion gallons of water that it carried every year. The water went into the same pipes that carry household sewage and rainwater runoff on their way to wastewater treatment plants. And when the remnants of Ida overwhelmed the pipes in September, the brook found its way onto the Major Deegan and \\u201cmade us an international symbol of what happens when the city doesn\\u2019t prepare for flooding,\\u201d said Robert Fanuzzi, the president of the Bronx Council for Environmental Quality, an advocacy group.\", \"[Why New York Is Unearthing a Brook It Buried a Century Ago]\", \"There is nothing new about resurrecting long-buried waterways. Cities from Auckland, New Zealand, to Detroit to Seoul have looked into peeling back pavement and exposing creeks and streams to help with the twin crises of outdated infrastructure and climate change, according to Jenny Hoffner, a vice president for conservation strategies for American Rivers, an advocacy group.\", \"The plan to daylight Tibbetts Brook involves rerouting it above ground for one mile, part of the way along a new greenway on a former railroad right-of-way. Taking the brook out of the sewer system would reduce combined sewer overflows in the Harlem River by 25 percent, or by 220 million gallons annually, according to the city. \\u201cIt makes this one of our most cost-effective projects,\\u201d said Angela Licata, a deputy commissioner at the city\\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection.\", \"The city has tried for years to buy the land along the old rail line. Schumer and other elected officials have accused the owner, the railroad freight company CSX Transportation, of stalling the project. CSX said in a statement, \\u201cWe maintain our commitment to determining if a mutually beneficial transaction can be agreed upon.\\u201d\", \"Bronx residents like Dart Westphal, a longtime environmental advocate, have campaigned to bring Tibbetts Creek above ground since the 1990s, at first to improve access to parkland fragmented by roads and development. Climate change has given him reason to believe the long-buried creek may finally see the light of day again.\", \"\\u201cYou have to do this to make the city sustainable,\\u201d he said.\", \"Dear Diary:\", \"My wife, Tina, and I were both born in New York City. When we married, in 1969, we didn\\u2019t have much in the way of furniture or other household items.\", \"In her purse, which seemed like a well-stocked suitcase to me, Tina carried a small book. In it were measurements for things she wanted for our home: a chair, a sofa, pieces of fabric.\", \"The measurements I loved most were the ones she kept for an old church pew she imagined putting next to the kitchen window. The measurements were very precise because the pew could be only so long and so high and could not block the radiator.\", \"When I asked Tina how she would know she had found the right pew if she saw one, she pulled a tiny measuring tape from her purse.\", \"\\u2014 Jim Trautman\", \"Illustrated by Agnes Lee.
