She\\u2019s not a profitable influencer, self-made YouTuber, or an overnight TikTok celebrity. Still, Ms. Hamilton has become something of a cult figure for a young generation of actors and people who love talented messes. On Twitter, Instagram and Substack, the 29-year-old New Yorker has been creating a mesmerizing, mirthful, at times harrowing, narrative of her bicoastal life.\", \"She posts self-taped auditions for roles she failed to get; glamour shots paired with photos of her shoe-mangled feet; and tales of rejection and loneliness and cigarettes. Ms. Hamilton can feel like a throwback to one of Warhol\\u2019s Factory Girls, balanced between self-importance and self-destruction in a Manhattan of yellow cabs, pay phones, tabloid crime and a rumored portal to dreams coming true.\", \"\\u201cI had known about Annie Hamilton as a Twitter personality,\\u201d said former Interview editor Nick Haramis. \\u201cShe fascinated me from afar. Then I was at a birthday party in New York and Annie emerged from the fire escape, having had a cigarette. I screamed \\u2018Annie Hamilton!\\u2019 I was like, \\u2018I don\\u2019t care what else is happening at this party, I want to spend the night talking to Annie.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"In one 60-second Instagram video, Ms. Hamilton, wearing a dark blue T-shirt and jeans, kneels outdoors on a sunny brick patio in Los Angeles, looking into the camera: \\u201cI feel\\u2026really sad. I\\u2019m stuck here, I\\u2019m stuck in like this sunny hell.\\u201d Before the viewer can process what they are seeing, Ms. Hamilton\\u2019s tear-streaked face announces, \\u201cWait I\\u2019m gonna pee.\\u201d Seconds later, as urine pools between her feet on the bricks, Ms. Hamilton sobs: \\u201cIt\\u2019s not that I owed it to you all to show how I feel, it\\u2019s that I am a miserable person, who wants to show everyone how I feel because I don\\u2019t know what else to do with my feelings.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s shocking, endearing and impossible to categorize. Part of the draw of Ms. Hamilton\\u2019s social media is trying to sort out where the stress falls in the shadowland between fact and fiction. What is an audition, and what is real?\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s all an act, but it\\u2019s not a lie,\\u201d said Ms. Hamilton\\u2019s friend Dasha Nekrasova, who plays Comfrey on the HBO series \\u201cSuccession.\\u201d\", \"On a cold, sunny afternoon in November, Ms. Hamilton stood smoking Parliaments and drinking black coffee outside Cafe Gitane on Mott Street in Manhattan\\u2019s Lower East Side neighborhood.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t like just acting for the camera,\\u201d Ms. Hamilton said. \\u201cI like acting in real life, too. I like putting myself in situations. It gets me into a lot of trouble.\\u201d\", \"She was dressed in a red Sonia Rykiel sweater she bought from The Real Real, a blue-and-white striped shirt, her grandfather\\u2019s leather bomber jacket from World War II, Levi\\u2019s vintage, dark wash bluejeans and red Hogan sneakers.\", \"She was in a bright mood: A few weeks earlier she\\u2019d done standup at The Jane Hotel, for a mixed-age crowd. (\\u201cAt 11 years old, I lied about the worst thing a person could lie about,\\u201d she told the sold-out room. \\u201cI lied that my Nana was a Holocaust survivor. My to-be best friend had a Nana who was a real Holocaust survivor, and I really wanted to bond up.\\u201d) The show was a hit, and The Jane has booked her for a monthly showcase, starting January 25.\", \"\\u201cA year or two ago, I became aware that I had made sort of a character online,\\u201d said Ms. Hamilton. \\u201cAnd now I play into that. If I recognize that I could do something crazy or kooky or wild or sensationalist, I will do it and then put it online. But I don\\u2019t view any of it as particularly honest. What I\\u2019m willing to tell people is all smoke and mirrors. I might flaunt a disgusting habit or story about myself, but really that is to conceal what truly is disgusting.\\u201d\", \"Her friend Lorraine Nicholson, a Los Angeles-based screenwriter and director, said, \\u201cThe thing that\\u2019s so attractive about Annie to women is that what she\\u2019s doing and saying publicly is what so many of us feel privately.\\u201d\", \"After living in Los Angeles as an actor for nine years and working odd jobs such as karaoke hostessing, nannying, and canning and labeling organic body oils in a garage in Beverly Hills, Ms. Hamilton moved back to New York City last year. She lives in a sporadically heated studio apartment for $1,000 a month near Dimes Square, five miles south of NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital where she was born. Ms. Hamilton\\u2019s mother is a stylish, intellectual, Jewish, Upper West Side mom. She dressed in all-black Agn\\u00e9s B. and doted on Ms. Hamilton and her brother, introducing them to writers like Sylvia Plath and Allen Ginsberg and plays like \\u201cThe Glass Menagerie\\u201d and \\u201cThrough a Glass Darkly.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI would come home from a play date and the first thing my mom would say is, \\u2018How many books do they have?\\u2019\\u201d said Ms. Hamilton. \\u201cAnd if I liked the kid and they didn\\u2019t have many books, I\\u2019d say, \\u2018They have a lot of books,\\u2019 because otherwise I wouldn\\u2019t be allowed to go back there.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Hamilton said her father spent most of his time away from home working on real estate deals in Rapid City, S.D., where he lived in a 6,000-square-foot, Frank Lloyd Wright-style house with an indoor pool. He drove two Ferrari\\u2019s and considered himself something of a wild man. He grew a mustache that swooshed up at the ends. The family started spending summers there.\", \"\\u201cI felt very lonely,\\u201d said Ms. Hamilton. \\u201cI really wanted to be Catholic. The cool girl at the country club was Catholic and I went to a Catholic summer camp, where I took an unwarranted First Communion and got in trouble for it. Everyone was going up to take a cracker, so I took one.\\u201d Her parents split up when Ms. Hamilton was 15; she didn\\u2019t speak to her father for years; her mother still lives on the Upper West Side.\", \"Ms. Hamilton and her mother text seventeen times a day. \\u201cI\\u2019m not sure how I feel about that but I can\\u2019t quit her and she can\\u2019t quit me,\\u201d she said.\", \"Ms. Hamilton wanted to be a ballerina, and when she was 11 she was accepted to the Alvin Ailey school of dance. \\u201cI had a teacher named Miss Howard \\u2014 who called me \\u2014 my real name\\u2019s Antonia \\u2014 and she coined the term that I was Tornado Toni,\\u201d said Ms. Hamilton. \\u201cI was good at jumping and good at spinning and I would throw my body around pretty violently.\\u201d\", \"For her high school yearbook, at the Ethical Culture Fieldston School, Ms. Hamilton chose a quote from the actor Zo\\u00eb Tamerlis Lund, who\\u2019d been director Abel Ferrara\\u2019s muse and collaborator on the 1992 movie, \\u201cBad Lieutenant.\\u201d According to Ms. Hamilton, Fieldston didn\\u2019t approve of the choice, \\u201cbecause Zo\\u00eb was a raging heroin addict.\\u201d But the line (\\u201cThat which is not yet, but ought to be, is more real than that which merely is\\u201d) captured something Ms. Hamilton still feels. \\u201cMy dreams are more real to me than my life right now,\\u201d she said.\", \"Ms. Hamilton attended U.S.C.\\u2019s highly competitive BFA program in theater. Her first year out of U.S.C., she booked several small acting jobs, including \\u201cDance Camp,\\u201d a YouTube Red movie, directed by Bert & Bertie, also known as Amber Templemore-Finlayson and Katie Ellwood. They also recently cast Ms. Hamilton opposite Florence Pugh in an upcoming episode of the Marvel series \\u201cHawkeye.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s something about Annie that\\u2019s not of our time, like she is out of joint with the current culture in a really special way,\\u201d said the artist Aria Dean, who directed Ms. Hamilton in a play in Geneva, Switzerland.\", \"\\u201cShe\\u2019s like this 1940s kind of archetypal Hollywood broad, fire-crackery and fast-talking, with her sort of clipped speech, a quick-wittedness and brazenness that you don\\u2019t see onscreen these days. The one who\\u2019s like, \\u2018I\\u2019m not going to shut up, but I\\u2019m still onscreen to get the guy.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Aside from \\u201cHawkeye,\\u201d Ms. Hamilton has minor roles in Shonda Rhimes\\u2019s upcoming Netflix series, \\u201cInventing Anna,\\u201d in which she plays a movie star, and a scene with Diane Keaton in Kate Aselton\\u2019s comedy, \\u201cMack & Rita.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAnnie is one of the actors who can do more than one thing,\\u201d said Cassandra Kulukundis, Paul Thomas Anderson\\u2019s casting director on films such as \\u201cMagnolia,\\u201d \\u201cThere Will Be Blood\\u201d and \\u201cPhantom Thread.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYou can see her coming and think she\\u2019s one thing \\u2014 and then you\\u2019ll realize she\\u2019s completely another. Those are the surprises that keep audiences coming back, when they don\\u2019t know if you\\u2019re going left or right.\\u201d\", \"Lately, Ms. Hamilton has been spending time in her Chinatown apartment, wearing three pairs of socks, writing her upcoming Jane show and continuing to perform for her followers on Instagram.\", \"Over coffee, she described a fantasy she used to calm herself while driving down the freeway in Los Angeles. In it, she was interviewing someone to be her personal assistant. \\u201cI would say, \\u2018I know I can be a lot. I know I have a temper. And I\\u2019m extremely vain. And I\\u2019m always applying makeup, and I cry when I can\\u2019t get the right outfit. And I\\u2019m a total terrorist emotionally and you\\u2019re going to have to deal with all this stuff.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"That vision evolved into another car fantasy where she was on the David Letterman show. Men would call in and claim they had sex with her and all of their claims would be true. \\u201cEveryone would expect me to deny these claims, but instead I would sit and be held accountable for my torrid and wild sexual past. And instead of being the actress that they want me to be, I\\u2019d be some sort of truth sayer.\\u201d\", \"Whether it\\u2019s true or not, Ms. Hamilton knows it\\u2019s compelling.\", \"\\u201cUltimately stories are stories \\u2014 what does it matter if they\\u2019re real or not?\\u201d said Odessa Young, her friend and actress who appeared in the film \\u201cShirley\\u201d opposite Elisabeth Moss. \\u201cAnnie has been lied to her whole life. She\\u2019s a young woman \\u2014 of course she\\u2019s been lied to her whole life. Annie is saying, \\u2018Oh, you want to make me a story? I\\u2019ll give you a story.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"c8552708705911ecba48f9320749a9a3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c8552708705911ecba48f9320749a9a3"}},
