The Detail takes a closer look at how it came to light and what happens next.\\u00a0\", \"Another year, another Wellington Water scandal.\\u00a0\", \"But the NZ\\u00a0Herald\\u2019s Wellington Issues correspondent Georgina Campbell says this one\\u2019s a bit different: no burst pipes here, no raw faeces running down Lambton Quay. No direct link to the chickens coming home to roost after decades of underinvestment in crucial public infrastructure.\\u00a0\", \"No \\u2013 this one is much more perplexing, Campbell says.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cThis story is shocking. It is outrageous, it is such a scandal. I just want to make that clear, how serious this issue is.\\u201d\\u00a0\", \"It\\u2019s been revealed that thousands of residents in some parts of the Wellington Region have been drinking unfluoridated water for nearly a year.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cBasically at the beginning of last week, Wellington Water issued a press release \\u2026 that said for the past four years, the machines that control the dosage of fluoride into our drinking water haven\\u2019t been up to scratch.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019ve been ageing, and they\\u2019re a bit unreliable, and they said that how they\\u2019ve been managing that is to put a smaller dosage of fluoride through (the machines), so there\\u2019s not a risk of overdose,\\u201d Campbell says.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cBut the consequence of that is there hasn\\u2019t been an effective amount of fluoride in the drinking water for four years.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cIt also said fluoride had been turned off last month \\u2013 about six weeks ago \\u2013 at two of the plants that supply water to Porirua, Wellington and Upper Hutt.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cLater that week, Wellington Water issued\\u00a0another statement. It turns out that information was wrong: fluoridation at one plant had actually been turned off in May last year \\u2013 10 months ago \\u2013 and at another plant in November last year.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cSo residents in Wellington have been getting water that doesn\\u2019t have any fluoride in it, and they haven\\u2019t been told until now.\\u201d\\u00a0\", \"Wellington Water\\u2019s board sprang into action \\u2013 belatedly, in the eyes of some \\u2013 launching an independent inquiry into what happened, and how.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cI guess what this independent inquiry will get to the crux of is, at what point did this issue get to in the Wellington Water hierarchy where somebody said, \\u2018oh no, we don\\u2019t need to take this any further?\\u2019\\u201d\\u00a0\", \"Campbell says aside from the baffling bureaucratic decisions, there are very real public health implications.\\u00a0\", \"According to Dental Association spokesperson Rob Beaglehole, children living in areas with fluoridated water have 40 percent less chance of having tooth decay.\\u00a0\", \"And many of the areas where the water was unfluoridated\\u00a0have high levels of socio-economic deprivation, like Porirua.\\u00a0\", \"Campbell herself reported in 2020 on a Porirua doctor who was bending the rules to get poor children with mouthfuls of rotten teeth hospital appointments. \\u00a0\", \"The saga\\u00a0has been seized upon by politicians as an argument in favour of the government\\u2019s Three Waters reform, as Grant Robertson told Newstalk ZB\\u2019s Mike Hosking last Friday. \\u00a0\", \"Work is underway in the meantime to sort out the run-down machines the lack of fluoridation stems from.\\u00a0\", \"While the costs aren\\u2019t yet known, the work is expected to take at least nine months \\u2013 and in the interim, water supplies will continue to be unfluoridated. \\u00a0\", \"Campbell says while this story isn\\u2019t directly related to the infrastructure issues that have plagued the capital city, it speaks to wider issues about management of one of society\\u2019s most precious resources. \\u00a0\", \"\\u201cIt is 2022. Residents in the capital city of New Zealand deserve to have pipes that function as they should, and do not burst randomly and discharge wastewater into the harbour.
