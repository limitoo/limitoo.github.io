In most images of first-wave punk musicians, their eyes are filled with negativity and contempt. In footage from a new film, Styrene\\u2019s are bright with possibility.\", \"The singer and creative force behind X-Ray Spex died from cancer in 2011, 34 years after her London band released its seismic first single, \\u201cOh Bondage Up Yours!\\u201d The world is still catching up. A new documentary due Feb. 2 titled \\u201cPoly Styrene: I Am a Clich\\u00e9\\u201d \\u2014 taken from one of her song titles that mixed self-aware humor and cultural critique \\u2014 is the latest ambitious project to chronicle her story, following an oral history book and a roving exhibition of her visual art, both from 2019.\", \"\\u201cMy mum believed she was psychic,\\u201d Styrene\\u2019s daughter, Celeste Bell, who co-directed the film with Paul Sng, said in a video interview. \\u201cYou can see that in her lyrics. She had this uncanny ability to predict what was going to happen.\\u201d\", \"Perhaps Styrene saw the future by paying attention. She set dynamite to the patriarchy on \\u201cOh Bondage Up Yours,\\u201d and \\u201cGermfree Adolescents,\\u201d the band\\u2019s sole album released just months before its 1979 split, is filled with blazing anthems that address identity, consumer culture, environmental ruin, information overload and punk itself. (Its title track, a dubby postmodern love song, was her most successful single.) She wore Day-Glo colors and brought in saxophones and science fiction. She could sing cool hooks or turn her voice into a rocket. Over bionic riffs, her lyrics told rich stories, forming a folk music of her own creation. The effect was sonic Pop Art.\", \"A biracial woman in a predominantly white scene, Styrene was not a typical punk. And \\u201cI Am a Clich\\u00e9\\u201d is by no means a typical punk film. Bell, who was finishing a master\\u2019s degree in political philosophy in 2015 when she began to face her role as caretaker of Poly Styrene\\u2019s legacy, appears onscreen and narrates her mother\\u2019s complicated life \\u2014 from teenage runaway to punk sensation to Hare Krishna, all while struggling with bipolar disorder, all before her mid-20s \\u2014 through her perspective as the (frequently neglected) child of a totemic, explosive figure in punk history.\", \"Was she a good mother? Not exactly. But while Bell poses the question and answers it early, she spends the duration of the film bearing out what her mother was always searching for in her lyrics \\u2014 a complexity scaled large enough to show the truth.\", \"The film\\u2019s timing is apt: Styrene\\u2019s influence on and relevance within culture keeps growing. Where her brash vision once seemed futuristic, it now feels shockingly attuned to reality. Artists from the vanguard of pop, like FKA twigs, and the heart of punk, like the New Orleans group Special Interest and the London trio Big Joanie, cite her as a formative inspiration. Her influence can also be traced through the still-emerging impact of the riot grrrl movement. It spans decades and generations.\", \"The singer, songwriter and rapper Neneh Cherry, who appears in \\u201cI Am a Clich\\u00e9,\\u201d said in an interview that she found her own voice by singing along to X-Ray Spex, and recalled listening to the band with her parents, the jazz musician Don and the textile artist Moki Cherry, who \\u201cabsolutely got\\u201d Styrene\\u2019s fearlessness and honesty.\", \"\\u201cWhen we used to listen to her, they would be like: That\\u2019s what we\\u2019re talking about,\\u201d Cherry said. She noted that it was singing along to her father\\u2019s piano playing and entering \\u201ca Poly place, tonally,\\u201d that her voice first emerged. \\u201cInside of hers is how I found my own voice,\\u201d she explained. \\u201cI also started listening to her when I was at a space in my life where \\u2014 I knew who I was, but I didn\\u2019t always know how to be who I was, or how to feel that great about it. Poly was and still is like medicine for me.\\u201d\", \"The feminist punk icon Kathleen Hanna first heard X-Ray Spex in 1989 \\u2014 the year before her band Bikini Kill formed in Olympia, Wash. \\u2014 and was awed by the breadth of ideas in her writing.\", \"\\u201cI was really blown away by the lyrics and how much there was a critique of capitalism,\\u201d she said in an interview, and how that extended, sometimes subtlety, to critiques of sexism and racism within punk. \\u201cPoly obviously is a poet. It was such a perfect marriage of emotion and technique. I was like, How have I never heard of this band before? It seemed better than the Sex Pistols.\\u201d\", \"STYRENE WAS BORN Marianne Joan Elliott-Said in 1957 to a Somali father and an English mother, who raised Styrene and her siblings alone in a Brixton council estate. In her teenage years, struck with art and rebellion, Styrene fled home to hitchhike to hippie music festivals, stoking an ecological consciousness she would bring to punk. She immersed herself in theater, fashion, poetry and music. A bookish autodidact who left school at 15, she gravitated toward philosophy, the occult, Freud and Jung. As a cinephile she favored the retrofuturism of \\u201cBarbarella.\\u201d Her rock idols were David Bowie and Marc Bolan. She loved soul and reggae, and Bell said she cited singer-songwriters like Joni Mitchell, Carole King and Joan Armatrading as huge inspirations.\", \"Styrene\\u2019s first pre-punk single was a pop-reggae song called \\u201cSilly Billy\\u201d about teenage pregnancy. It was produced by a man 16 years her senior named Falcon Stuart who would become her boyfriend and the manager of X-Ray Spex. (Bell said she received conflicting stories about Stuart, who died in 2002, over the years, noting in the film: \\u201cSometimes she\\u2019d say he was the love of her life; other times, that he\\u2019d ruined it.\\u201d)\", \"When punk hit, Styrene, at 19, was galvanized. Enamored of the Sex Pistols \\u2014 a previously unseen clip of Styrene dancing in the crowd at one of their gigs recurs in the film \\u2014 she placed an ad in Melody Maker searching for \\u201cyung punx\\u201d to \\u201cstick it together,\\u201d and assembled a crew that included the bassist Paul Dean and, briefly, the saxophonist Lora Logic (until Styrene kicked her out).\", \"The band signed with Virgin for the classic \\u201cOh Bondage Up Yours\\u201d \\u2014 its opening declaration, \\u201cSome people think little girls should be seen and not heard/But I think, oh bondage, up yours!\\u201d became feminist punk scripture \\u2014\\u00a0before moving to EMI for \\u201cGermfree Adolescents.\\u201d (Styrene was an uncredited producer on the album, Bell said.) The LP took them to \\u201cTop of the Pops\\u201d and the BBC, which broadcast a television documentary called \\u201cWho Is Poly Styrene?\\u201d where the singer famously described that she picked her stage name because it is plastic and disposable: \\u201cThat\\u2019s what pop stars are meant to mean, therefore I thought I might as well send it up.\\u201d\", \"The early BBC film and \\u201cI Am a Clich\\u00e9\\u201d both depict Styrene\\u2019s mental health struggles, which the pressures of fame exacerbated. In 1978, she was misdiagnosed with schizophrenia; she was in a psychiatric hospital the first time she saw herself singing on television. Bell believes her mother\\u2019s condition was worsened by the media\\u2019s sexist scrutiny of her body as well as the destabilizing nihilism in punk.\", \"\\u201cA lot of people think X-Ray Spex were a lot more underground than they were. But my mum did have that brush with celebrity,\\u201d Bell said. \\u201cThere is a kind of fame where you can never escape from it, and that was the kind of attention that my mum had, even though it didn\\u2019t last very long. It didn\\u2019t last very long because she got out.\\u201d\", \"Styrene went on to release the gentle, tabla-flecked solo album \\u201cTranslucence\\u201d in 1981, and, around then, met the musician Adrian Bell. They married three months later and she gave birth to Bell. Not long after, Styrene eschewed the material world she had observed in her songs by joining the Hare Krishna movement and moving with her daughter to Bhaktivedanta Manor, a country house George Harrison had donated to the group in 1973. But her mental health struggles persisted. She left the temple, and Bell, then 8, went to live with her grandmother.\", \"Bell said her mother never had a steady job after X-Ray Spex. She lived off meager royalties, continuing to write and release music. Heartbreakingly, in the film, Bell recalls her mother saying \\u201cbeing broke and famous is the worst of both worlds.\\u201d\", \"By the early 2000s, Bell and her mother had reconciled. Styrene moved to seaside Hastings, which energized her, and she began to write a retrospective diary of her punk past. (Excerpts are threaded throughout the film.) Styrene had recently recorded a new solo album, \\u201cGeneration Indigo,\\u201d when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. Bell said her mother believed in reincarnation, viewing death as \\u201cthe next great adventure.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cMy mum didn\\u2019t have an easy life,\\u201d she said. \\u201cShe had a lot of barriers to break through as a mixed race woman, but she did, and she did it on her own terms. She took the DIY ethic and really lived it.\\u201d\", \"In her diary, Styrene called herself \\u201can ordinary tough kid from an ordinary tough street.\\u201d Her daughter said that she fought back when other children mocked her appearance: \\u201cShe was always getting beat up. She\\u2019d been chased down the street by skinheads.\\u201d\", \"Styrene explored her heritage directly in early poems, which led to intersectional statements on tracks like \\u201cOh Bondage Up Yours!\\u201d \\u2014 an indictment of the bondage aesthetic in punk fashion, which she loathed, as much as a liberationist rallying cry. She asked, presciently, in the X-Ray Spex song \\u201cIdentity\\u201d:\", \"WHEN HANNA FOUND Styrene, her forebear\\u2019s influence was musical as well as philosophical. \\u201cShe could do a vulnerable high-pitched voice and also a loud bellow,\\u201d she said. \\u201cShe used the roundness in her voice, the piercing in her voice. There\\u2019s not a fear of pop music with Poly.\\u201d\", \"For Alli Logout, the vocalist for Special Interest, Styrene was thrilling proof that a person of color had helped invent punk while critiquing it; that vulnerability can exist in chaos; and that punk can be incisive but fun.\", \"\\u201cMy original exploration with music in general was a sadness that I didn\\u2019t see any Black bodies occupying that space,\\u201d Logout, who uses they/them pronouns, said of their earliest experiences headbanging at metal shows in their small Texas town. But leafing through a stolen book on punk history, \\u201cI remember very clearly seeing a picture of Poly Styrene and her braces and being like, what?\\u201d Watching a live \\u201cBondage\\u201d video, \\u201cI felt the otherness that she encapsulated by just being fully herself. Whenever I heard that song, I knew that it was the attitude that I have to present myself in every single day.\\u201d\", \"Beginning in middle school, the singer-songwriter Shamir felt such a connection to X-Ray Spex that by the fall of 2016, he decided to get Styrene\\u2019s face tattooed on his thigh. \\u201cPoly was one of the main influences on me to keep the spirit of punk alive as a Black person,\\u201d he said in an interview. \\u201cShe\\u2019s constantly staring at me when I wake up in the morning.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cSo much of the time, what\\u2019s considered punk to everyone else is rage, but I don\\u2019t think anyone would categorize her as rageful,\\u201d he noted, saying Styrene communicated via different emotions. \\u201cI learned from that in a lot of ways.\\u201d He added, \\u201cYou\\u2019re always going to be in the margins, but that doesn\\u2019t mean you have to be quiet. A lot of times we have to be the loudest in order to be heard slightly.\\u201d\", \"As Bell organized her mother\\u2019s archive, she was struck by the intensity of her process, uncovering many drafts of a single set of lyrics, or a mixed-media collage, like a piece that layered various forms of contraception packaging atop feminist comic strips to explore the nature of modern relationships. (Styrene created all of the band\\u2019s art herself.) \\u201cShe walked away at the height of their popularity,\\u201d she said. It\\u2019s a decision Bell finds gives the film a hopeful message: \\u201cShe could have made a lot more money, but she prioritized her health and her spiritual longings over fame and success.\\u201d\", \"Ultimately, Bell said with conviction, \\u201cAll my mum wanted, musically and artistically, was to be taken seriously.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ffa8cf2c838011ec8c9ed3b214d8ba24"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ffa8cf2c838011ec8c9ed3b214d8ba24"}},
