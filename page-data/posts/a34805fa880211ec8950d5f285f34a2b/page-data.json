He reported to SEAL training in Coronado in July, the Union-Tribune said. \", \" The Hell Week test is part of the BUD/S class, which involves basic underwater demolition, survival and other combat tactics. It comes in the fourth week as SEAL candidates are being assessed and hoping to be selected for training within the Naval Special Warfare Basic Training Command.\", \" The SEAL program tests physical and psychological strength along with water competency and leadership skills. The program is so grueling that at least 50% to 60% don't make it through Hell Week, when candidates are pushed to the limit. \", \" The last SEAL candidate to die during the assessment phase was 21-year-old Seaman James Derek Lovelace in 2016. He was struggling to tread water in full gear in a giant pool when his instructor pushed him underwater at least twice. He lost consciousness and died.\", \" His death was initially ruled a homicide by the San Diego County Medical Examiner. A year later, after an investigation, the Navy said it would not pursue criminal charges in Lovelace's drowning. An autopsy revealed he had an enlarged heart that contributed to his death, and that he also had an abnormal coronary artery, which has been associated with sudden cardiac death, especially in athletes.\", \" It was unclear from the autopsy report how much Lovelace's heart abnormalities contributed to his death.\", \" The latest death also comes just two months after a Navy SEAL commander died from injuries he suffered during a training accident in Virginia. Commander Brian Bourgeois, 43, fell while fast-roping down from a helicopter, and he died several days later.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"a34805fa880211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a34805fa880211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
