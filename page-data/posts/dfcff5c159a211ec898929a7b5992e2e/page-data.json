Each time Congress weighs taxing them, the merely rich rush to run interference for the fabulously rich.\", \"Adam Wyden, 37, made it clear he does not want to push his familial dispute too far.\", \"\\u201cThe issue is bigger than my father. I\\u2019m not interested in discussing anything personal,\\u201d he said in a brief phone call before declining to go further. He said he was \\u201cnot a Trumper\\u201d and \\u201cnot an Ocasio\\u201d \\u2014 referring to Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, an icon of the Democratic left. He is a libertarian, he said, raised in Washington, D.C., who moved to Florida \\u201cto get away from the food fight.\\u201d\", \"But he has gone public with his grievances against his father\\u2019s proposals, in an appearance last month on CNBC that he recommended for viewing, and in a tweet responding to the elder Mr. Wyden\\u2019s assertion that Elon Musk and other billionaires should not get to decide whether to pay taxes based on a Twitter poll.\", \"\\u201cWhy does he hate us / the American dream so much?!?!?!?!\\u201d Adam Wyden said in the Twitter post last month. \\u201cReality is: most legislators have never built anything \\u2026 so I guess it\\u2019s easier to mindlessly and haphazardly try and tear stuff down.\\u201d\", \"His father would like to avoid the subject all together.\", \"\\u201cHe doesn\\u2019t talk to me about his business, and I don\\u2019t talk to him about mine,\\u201d Senator Wyden, 72, said in an interview on Wednesday.\", \"But as President Biden\\u2019s $2.2 trillion social safety net and climate change bill has languished in the Senate, Mr. Wyden has kept alive the proposals his son has spoken out against. One would tax the annual wealth gains of about 700 American billionaires, some of whom were shown in a series of ProPublica reports to have paid a tiny fraction of their wealth in taxes, while some paid no income taxes at all. The proposal would raise $557 billion over 10 years and turn the Build Back Better Act into a bona fide deficit reducer.\", \"Another would change the rules that business partnerships have used to avoid taxation and evade Internal Revenue Service audits. Still another would close the so-called carried-interest loophole, which allows some hedge fund and private equity managers to claim the fees they charge clients as capital gains, not income \\u2014 and pay much lower tax rates.\", \"Monte A. Jackel, an expert on the taxation of partnerships and a counsel at the tax practice Leo Berwick, said Adam Wyden would undoubtedly pay higher taxes under some of his father\\u2019s proposals. The senator\\u2019s efforts to close the carried-interest loophole would mean income on which his son now pays a 20 percent tax rate would instead be taxed annually as high as 37 percent.\", \"Efforts to shut down offshore partnerships could hurt the younger Mr. Wyden indirectly, by costing him some clients, Mr. Jackel said. He pointed to the structure of Mr. Wyden\\u2019s fund, which includes a \\u201cmaster fund\\u201d partnership in the United States and an \\u201coffshore feeder\\u201d foreign corporation, which allows tax-exempt and foreign investors to avoid U.S. taxation.\", \"But Adam Wyden is hardly one of the big whales that most Senate Democrats are eyeing to pay for their spending. With three employees, a little more than 150 investors and $329 million in assets under management, ADW Capital Partners is successful but no titan. Citadel Advisors, a large hedge fund, has $235 billion in assets and more than 2,000 employees.\", \"\\u201cAt a maximum,\\u201d Adam Wyden might have $12 million in adjusted gross income, said Steven N. Kaplan, a finance professor at the University of Chicago\\u2019s Booth School of Business.\", \"He would in no way be hit by his father\\u2019s wealth tax, which would be levied only on people with $1 billion in assets or $100 million or more in income over three consecutive years. He might be affected by a provision in the House-passed version of the social policy bill, which would impose a 5 percent surtax on income over $10 million. But his father has said he would much rather hit billionaires than millionaires, and has complained that the House plan taxes N.B.A. players while letting team owners off the hook.\", \"Yet Adam Wyden burst into view by defending one of his father\\u2019s real targets, Mr. Musk, after the Tesla founder asked Twitter followers whether he should sell shares of the company and pay taxes on them, and then insulted Senator Wyden with what appeared to be a vulgar slight.\", \"\\u201cThankfully, I think I can compound\\u201d investment gains \\u201cfaster than my dad and his cronies can confiscate it,\\u201d Adam Wyden wrote.\", \"Lauded on CNBC\\u2019s \\u201cSquawk Box,\\u201d he elaborated on air. \\u201cAmazon, Netflix, Google, Tesla: I mean, we are the envy of the rest of the world,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople come to this country to build amazing businesses, and I want that to continue.\\u201d\", \"Without referring to his son, the elder Mr. Wyden suggested a possible reason for his stance: \\u201cMany millionaires perhaps may consider themselves tomorrow\\u2019s billionaires.\\u201d\", \"Dennis Kelleher, who heads Better Markets, a group that works against income inequality, said the marshaling of little guys to protect the big guys \\u201chappens all the time.\\u201d Small-business owners protest estate taxes they will never pay. Community banks protest regulations aimed at the large banks that are their biggest competitors. Minimum-wage workers are somehow framed as the targets for I.R.S. enforcement proposals aimed at the ultrarich.\", \"\\u201cNot only does it distort discussion of incredibly important policy,\\u201d he said, \\u201cit ends up advancing the interest of this very small number of people and industries that have a chokehold on public policy in Washington.\\u201d\", \"Adam Wyden is a reluctant rebel. He said he had \\u201cno interest in engaging in a Wyden-versus-Wyden\\u201d story, and was more interested in talking about his Jewish grandfather cheating on his medical exam to win the chance to invade Normandy on D-Day and become a decorated war hero.\", \"He is hardly the only wealthy person sticking up for the fantastically rich. The billionaire class has long leaned on farmers and ranchers to beat back efforts to tax inheritances more heavily. This year, the tactic worked to kill a proposal from Mr. Biden that would have set the value of inherited assets at their original purchase price, not their worth at the time of the original owner\\u2019s death.\", \"That \\u201cstep up\\u201d in the value of an inherited asset means that its unrealized gains over a lifetime are often never taxed, a boon to wealthy heirs, protected in Washington by those considered politically untouchable. That includes family farmers, who are actually unlikely to be affected given the Democratic proposals include protections for farms, ranches and small businesses.\", \"Two former Democratic senators from rural states, Max Baucus of Montana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, lobbied against the Biden proposal and quickly won over Senator Jon Tester, the current Democrat from Montana, who killed it in October in the name of \\u201cour family farms, ranches and small businesses.\\u201d\", \"Senator Wyden insists he is not giving up.\", \"\\u201cNext year when people are sorting this out, after hearing over and over that billionaires are paying little or nothing,\\u201d he said, they need to see that has changed. He added, \\u201cWe\\u2019re going to be staying at it.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"dfcff5c159a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"dfcff5c159a211ec898929a7b5992e2e"}},
