There is a complete ban on outdoor water use.\", \"The town of Westport is currently using 5,500 cubic of metres each day. Restricting use to essential needs will hopefully slow down the depletion of the supply, Cleine said.\", \"The water supply to Westport was shut off from 1pm-7pm on Thursday 17 February while contractors repaired leaks in the trunk main supply line to town, as part of a concerted effort to prevent further losses.\", \"Cleine said engineers were also working on a long-term fix to the pipe, as the ongoing supply of safe water was essential.\", \"\\\"This is the biggest issue we are facing right now. There has been significant, serious damage to a lot of infrastructure including roading and bridges. But right now, we are most concerned about the supply of safe drinking water to the community.\", \"\\\"If we all pitch in, we will be able to maintain our supply while we find a long-term solution.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"0da6184f906711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0da6184f906711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
