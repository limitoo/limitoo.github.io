It was eventually broken up by more than 600 police officers using riot gear, pepper spray and fire hoses; towing cars and trucks that had been blocking nearby streets and forcing the protesters off the precinct.\", \"There were at least 89 arrests, about 40 officers were injured, with eight admitted to hospital.\", \"In the final days of the occupation, Ardern said there would be a review to determine if more could have been done to prevent it from happening.\", \"She talked about two pieces of work, one of which would look at ensuring parliamentary security was sufficient; the government would also look at enforcement powers, police resources and any threats to critical infrastructure, she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/139360/eight_col_pm7edit.jpg?1646279053\\\" alt=\\\"No caption\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPrime Minister Jacinda Ardern at Parliament Grounds after protesters were removed \\nPhoto: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone\\n</div>\", \"Last week, Police Minister Poto Williams said there had been no discussion at Cabinet of any broader review but noted about 1600 complaints to the IPCA \\\"from the protest activity itself so they will be well versed on the actions of the participants in that protest\\\".\", \"Ardern says the government is waiting for final decisions by IPCA and the scope of its inquiry, which is separate to those complaints: \\\"The government indicated an interest in looking into what happened - we've never given an indication of how that would be done\\\".\", \"\\\"But it does seem they would be a body that we should give consideration as to whether or not they are covering the full ambit, because there would be no point whatsoever in replicating what would I imagine be probably quite an intensive investigation.\\\"\", \"National Party justice spokersperson Paul Goldsmith says New Zealanders saw \\\"an unprecedented occupation and trashing of Parliament's grounds and its surrounding streets, followed by a fiery and riotous conclusion\\\".\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/139645/eight_col_CleanUp-3March-3.jpg?1646721997\\\" alt=\\\"Rubbish left at Parliament grounds on 3 March, 2022, following a three-week occupation by anti-mandate and other protesters.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nRubbish left on Parliament Grounds by protesters \\nPhoto: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone\\n</div>\", \"The fundamental question is \\\"how did it come to this?\\\", he asks.\", \"\\\"An IPCA investigation is appropriate, but it won't cover all the aspects that need to be reviewed and it may be many months before we hear anything from it.\", \"\\\"What about the role of the Speaker?

They have the knowledge, the experience, the operational understanding and the inquiry powers to do that.\", \"The IPCA says it's \\\"currently determining the scope of an independent review of the policing of the occupation on and around Parliament grounds ... this will include the complaints the Authority has received about this operation\\\".

As such, any changes to the way that the public is able to access the grounds will need to be carefully considered and thoroughly consulted on.\", \"\\\"Though we have begun the reflective process around what happened and how we responded to it, at this stage are unable to comment on any official reviews, internal or external, of the grounds or their security.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"45db7de8a96d11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"45db7de8a96d11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
