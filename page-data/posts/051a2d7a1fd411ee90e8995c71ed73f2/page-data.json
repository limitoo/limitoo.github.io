We encourage everyone to follow the guidance from their local emergency management officials,\\\" the Corps' New England District\\u00a0tweeted.\", \"And William Fraser, the city manager of Vermont's capital, Montpelier, warned in a Facebook post overnight that, \\\"The Wrightsville Dam only has 6 feet of storage capacity left.

Unfortunately, there are very few evacuation options remaining. People in at risk areas may wish to go to upper floors in their houses.\\\"\", \"Fraser added that, \\\"Computer and radio systems at the Police Station may become incapacitated if floodwaters increase.\\\"\", \"He estimated Monday night that knee-high waters had reached much of downtown and were expected to rise a couple more feet overnight.  \", \"For good measure, the Montpelier city government said on Facebook that, \\\"It's not just your imagination that this is a big flood.  This has been the second highest recorded Winooski River level in history, behind only the historic 1927 flood.  This is higher than 1992 and both 2011 flood events.\\\"\", \"Montpelier and nearby Barre, Vermont issued emergency health orders closing their downtowns until at least noon, Vermont Public Television reported.\", \"Troy Caruso, who owns a golf course, five restaurants and a motel in Ludlow, Vermont, said he's been checking the damage to his properties and in the town of about 800 people.

Phil said, referring to Tropical Storm Irene in August 2011. That storm killed six in the state, washed homes off their foundations and damaged or destroyed more than 200 bridges and 500 miles of highway.  \", \"What's different is that Irene lasted just about 24 hours, Scott said. \", \"\\\"This is going on. We're getting just as much rain, if not more. It's going on for days. That's my concern. It's not just the initial damage.

The village police station itself was full of mud and leaves after being flooded with about 5 inches of water, Basile said. \", \"Atmospheric scientists say destructive flooding events are spurred by storms forming in a warmer atmosphere, making extreme rainfall a reality. The additional warming that scientists predict is coming will only make it worse. \", \"The storm also interrupted travel.
