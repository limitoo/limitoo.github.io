They wanted to take a more cautious approach, because demand is starting to outstrip supply it's driving the prices up.\\\"\", \"It is not the news Aucklanders were hoping for, with many already thinking about changing their driving habits to avoid a nasty pinch at the pump.\", \"\\\"I drive a car and a motor home, so I'm buying both petrol and diesel so I'm following it quite closely.
