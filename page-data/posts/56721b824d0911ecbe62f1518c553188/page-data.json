The border will open in stages to different countries, with fully vaccinated New Zealanders and visa holders able to travel from Australia from Jan. 16 and from elsewhere in the world starting Feb. 13. Foreign nationals will follow from April 30.\", \"Experts have for weeks questioned the need for requiring new arrivals to quarantine when the virus is already in the community, and experts say international arrivals seem to pose no additional risk. No fully vaccinated travelers from Australia, for example, have tested positive in New Zealand\\u2019s hotel quarantine system since Aug. 23.\", \"Some 84 percent of people in New Zealand age 12 and up are fully vaccinated against the coronavirus. And representatives from the country\\u2019s tourism industry, which has struggled to contend with the long absence of foreign visitors, decried the seven-day isolation requirement.\", \"New Zealand has been on edge since August, when an outbreak of the Delta variant erupted in Auckland and put an end to the country\\u2019s \\u201czero Covid\\u201d approach.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s very encouraging that we as a country are now in a position to move towards greater normality,\\u201d Chris Hipkins, the minister responsible for New Zealand\\u2019s pandemic response, said at a news conference on Wednesday. \\u201cI do want to emphasize, though, that travel in 2022 won\\u2019t necessarily be exactly the same as it was in pre-2020 travel.\\u201d\", \"For over a year, New Zealand has operated a lottery system for citizens and permanent residents who want to return, locking people out of the country and creating a large backlog. The system has faced legal challenges from people desperate to return home from overseas and be reunited with their families.\", \"New Zealand is waiting until April to fully open to permit time for airlines to plan, he said, as well as to allow a transition to the country\\u2019s new \\u201ctraffic light\\u201d pandemic management system that starts Dec. 2. That system will end lockdowns and place significant restrictions on the unvaccinated, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced at a news conference on Monday.\", \"On Dec. 15, Auckland \\u2014 where the country\\u2019s outbreak is concentrated \\u2014 will open its border to the rest of the country.\", \"Before the pandemic, tourism was a big part of the New Zealand economy, employing nearly 230,000 people and contributing 41.9 billion New Zealand dollars ($30.2 billion) a year. About 3.8 million foreign tourists visited between 2018 and 2019, with the majority coming from Australia. Though domestic tourism has surged while borders have been closed, the industry has struggled to make up its losses, as international tourists spend about three times as much per person as their domestic peers.\", \"Defending New Zealand\\u2019s caution, Mr. Hipkins pointed to the new virus wave that is crashing through Europe. \\u201cAs we move into 2022, we know that the pandemic is not over,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not going to suddenly end, and we only need to look at Europe to know that the path out of the pandemic is not a straightforward one.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"56721b824d0911ecbe62f1518c553188"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"56721b824d0911ecbe62f1518c553188"}},
