The bishops also said they planned to set up working groups, presided over by laypeople, that will draw up concrete proposals by 2023 on issues like the training of priests.\", \"Olivier Savignac, a member of De la parole aux actes!, an umbrella association of victim groups established after the report was released, said that a culture of opaqueness and secrecy had been \\u201cbroken.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cNow we want to see how things are going to be implemented,\\u201d Mr. Savignac said, citing the staffing of the working groups and of the reparations body, which will be led by Marie Derain de Vaucresson, a legal expert who specializes in the rights of children.\", \"The devastating church-ordered report last month estimated that 200,000 to 300,000 children or vulnerable people had been abused over the past 70 years by clergy members or people affiliated with the church \\u2014 a projection based on a general population survey, a public call for victims\\u2019 testimony, archival analysis and other sources.\", \"For the first time last week, France\\u2019s 120 bishops recognized that the church bore an \\u201cinstitutional responsibility\\u201d for \\u201csystemic\\u201d abuse.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s the sign of a positive dynamic, which must still be confirmed,\\u201d J\\u00e9r\\u00f4me Chapuis, the editor in chief of La Croix, a respected Catholic newspaper in France, wrote in an editorial on Sunday. \\u201cBecause this fragile process is only in its early stages.\\u201d\", \"The announcement on compensation was widely awaited by victims of clerical abuse, who had balked at earlier suggestions by France\\u2019s Catholic leadership that the victims compensation fund should be financed mainly by parishioner donations.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s what we were hoping for,\\u201d said Mr. Savignac, who was sexually abused by a priest at age 13. \\u201cBecause it\\u2019s the institution that is taking responsibility and paying.\\u201d\", \"The Church will sell assets, including real estate, and could even take out a loan if needed, Archbishop de Moulins-Beaufort said. Each victim will also be compensated individually \\u2014 another key demand from victims groups, who had rejected suggestions of a flat fee and said each case needed to be evaluated separately. Some victims say they need to recoup years of medical bills and other expenses linked to the trauma caused by the abuse.\", \"Parishioners can still donate money directly to the compensation fund, but general parishioner donations, which account for a large portion of the Catholic Church\\u2019s funding in France, will not be used, the bishops said on Monday.\", \"Archbishop de Moulins-Beaufort did not provide any details about how much the church expected that the compensation fund would grow, but said it would be endowed gradually as victims came forward. Nor did he provide an inventory of what the church expected to sell. Some French dioceses, like the one in Paris, have sizable real estate assets, but others are struggling financially.\", \"\\u201cObviously we must gather sums that are far greater than what we had imagined, given the scope of the abuse,\\u201d he said.\", \"The bishops have also asked Pope Francis to send a team of \\u201ctrusted\\u201d advisers to help evaluate the French church\\u2019s child-protection measures. The Vatican\\u2019s role in the handling of abuse scandals in the Catholic Church has been criticized by victims\\u2019 groups, who argue that it is an obstacle to reform on some issues, like holding negligent bishops accountable, requiring that allegations be reported to civil authorities, and, in rare cases, using confession to keep abuse secret.\", \"The bishops voted on Monday to create a special canonical court that will handle abuse cases nationwide, to avoid having priests accused of abuse judged by local church leaders who may be inclined to protect them.\", \"But other issues related to canon law are outside of the French church\\u2019s purview and would require a policy shift in Rome. French Catholic leaders are expected to meet with Pope Francis in December.\", \"\\u201cWe are not at the end of the path,\\u201d Archbishop de Moulins-Beaufort said in his closing speech on Monday. \\u201cBut a path is possible, it has been laid out for us, and we must follow it step by step.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b716ed9c40c911eca858b9a44e9e8b4e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b716ed9c40c911eca858b9a44e9e8b4e"}},
