Even still, some viewers stayed home.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-28T20:38:17.000Z","content":"[\"Hollywood has stopped running from the pandemic: For the first time since March 2020, movie theaters had a wide array of new films for exclusive screening over the holiday weekend. And studios did not hedge their bets by offering simultaneous streaming options. To see the gloriously reviewed \\u201cEncanto,\\u201d the campy crime drama \\u201cHouse of Gucci\\u201d or the latest installment in the \\u201cResident Evil\\u201d science-fiction action franchise, you had to leave the sofa, just like in the old days.\", \"But some moviegoers are proving very difficult to lure back.\", \"\\u201cEncanto,\\u201d an original Disney animated musical about a gifted family in Colombia, took in $40.3 million at 3,980 theaters in North America between Wednesday and Sunday. That total, which was enough for No. 1, equated to about 3.7 million patrons, or about 35 percent of the available seats, according to Steve Buck, the chief strategy officer for EntTelligence, a research firm. Ticket buyers gave the film an A grade in CinemaScore exit polls.\", \"In wide release outside the United States, with the notable exceptions of China and Australia, \\u201cEncanto\\u201d collected an additional $29.3 million. \\u201cIt may take some time for people to discover \\u2018Encanto\\u2019 through word of mouth and reviews,\\u201d Disney said in a results email on Sunday, referring to audiences overseas, where the weekend was not a holiday. News of the Omicron variant may have dented European turnout, box office analysts said.\", \"Disney, which spent roughly $175 million to make \\u201cEncanto,\\u201d not including tens of millions in marketing costs, had hoped that the family audience was finally ready to return to theaters on a vast scale. Children as young as five became eligible for coronavirus vaccinations in the United States on Nov. 2. For the first time this year, Disney did not send reporters a prerelease advisory about poor market conditions.\", \"\\u201cThis is a fair opening by pandemic standards, and a weak opening by Disney historical standards,\\u201d David A. Gross, who runs the film consultancy Franchise Entertainment Research, said in an email on Sunday.\", \"\\u201cEncanto\\u201d features songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, whose music helped Disney\\u2019s animated \\u201cMoana\\u201d sell $82.1 million in tickets during the five-day Thanksgiving period in 2016. In part because studios have routed animated films away from theaters and toward streaming services \\u2014 Pixar\\u2019s \\u201cLuca\\u201d played exclusively on Disney+ in the United States over the summer \\u2014 the genre accounts for one of the bigger pieces of the box office that has been lost during the pandemic. In 2019, animated wide releases collected $4.6 billion worldwide. Mr. Gross estimated that animation will finish this year with about $1.65 billion in ticket sales, a decline of about 64 percent.\", \"Domestic ticket sales for \\u201cEncanto\\u201d nonetheless set a pandemic-era record for an animated film. That glory is somewhat hollow, given that every other major animated film since March 2020 has been released simultaneously in theaters and on streaming services. (They have included \\u201cThe Boss Baby: Family Business\\u201d from Universal and \\u201cPaw Patrol: The Movie\\u201d from Paramount.) \\u201cEncanto\\u201d is scheduled to arrive on Disney+ on Dec. 24.\", \"The ultimate performance of \\u201cEncanto,\\u201d both in theaters and on Disney+, is likely to inform Disney\\u2019s release plans for animated films well into the coming year. \\u201cMost of the franchises that we\\u2019ve had at the Walt Disney Company have been built through the theatrical exhibition channel of distribution,\\u201d Bob Chapek, Disney\\u2019s chief executive, told analysts on an earnings-related conference call on Nov. 10. \\u201cAt the same time, we\\u2019re watching very, very carefully different types of movies to see how the different components of the demographics of that market come back.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re still unsure in terms of how the marketplace is going to react when family films come back with a theatrical-first window,\\u201d he added.\", \"For the holiday weekend in North America, \\u201cGhostbusters: Afterlife,\\u201d from Sony, was a strong second, collecting $35.3 million between Wednesday and Sunday, for a two-week domestic total of $87.8 million, according to Comscore, which compiles box office data. \\u201cGhostbusters: Afterlife,\\u201d released Nov. 19, siphoned some family business away from \\u201cEncanto,\\u201d box office analysts said.\", \"\\u201cHouse of Gucci,\\u201d with Lady Gaga leading an ensemble cast, was a healthy third. It sold about $21.8 million in tickets over the five-day period. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, which spent roughly $70 million to make the R-rated crime drama, not including robust marketing expenses, noted on Sunday that only 34 percent of ticket buyers were 45 or older.\", \"\\u201cAs with families, older moviegoers have been reluctant to return to the movies, watching more entertainment at home,\\u201d Mr. Gross said. \\u201cThe film would be opening 50 percent higher under normal circumstances, but this is very good.\\u201d\", \"In a positive sign for prestige films \\u2014 December is peak season, with Oscar hopefuls rolling out every weekend \\u2014 Paul Thomas Anderson\\u2019s \\u201cLicorice Pizza,\\u201d released by United Artists sizzled in limited release. The R-rated period film, a blend of comedy, drama and romance, took in $335,000 at four theaters \\u2014 two in New York and two in Los Angeles \\u2014 for a per-theater average of $83,852. It was the best specialty-film debut in nearly two years.\"]","href_hash":"09efaad8508b11ec8ebb658b75bef5fc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"09efaad8508b11ec8ebb658b75bef5fc"}},
