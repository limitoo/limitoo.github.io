Like, 'I don't trust any Black people. I don't trust any white people.'\\\"\", \"Smiley pointed out that people of color are \\\"not the ones causing the problem\\\" of racism, prompting Maher to read the MSNBC article headline \\\"Glenn Youngkin's victory proves white ignorance is a powerful weapon.\\\"\", \"Maher criticized the story, saying he doesn't think it \\\"helps.\\\"\", \"\\\"I'm an old-school liberal,\\\" Maher said. \\\"I believe in a colorblind society. That's not where woke is, okay? There's a lot of resegregation going on. There's a lot of 'You're either a racist or you don't know you're a racist.'
