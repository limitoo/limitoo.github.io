Sweet, sweet dog.\\\"\", \"After contacting the police, the dog's microchip was scanned and they were able to identify the owners, Robert and Dr. Nickie Bell.\", \"When the couple was first contacted, Nickie said the dog \\\"was throwing up, hair was falling out, he wasn't breathing, he wasn't walking,\\\" Fox 31 reported.\", \"She told the officer that the couple wrapped the dog in a blanket and \\\"put him to rest\\\" in the dumpster.\", \"When the Bells went to city hall to retrieve their dog after being told he was in fact alive, their conversation with authorities was recorded by body cams and retrieved by Fox 31.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935888/yorkshire-terrier-neglect.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Two dog owners were charged with animal neglect after their Yorkshire Terrier was found in a dumpster.
