The pained attempts to connect or to disappear are bad enough; the added burdens of anxiety or depression make the teenage need to fumble towards an understanding of self and of the world feel downright impossible.\", \"Dear Evan Hansen, the adaptation of the Tony Award-winning musical directed for the screen by Stephen Chbosky, is a close study of that discomfort: raw enough to make you cringe, exposed enough to make you weep, and designed to take you right back to the panic of teen suffering.\", \"The plot is almost ghoulish. It turns on the deeply anxious Evan Hansen, played by Ben Platt, who originated the part on stage and became the youngest solo recipient of the Tony Award for Leading Actor in a Musical.\", \"Evan is starting the school year with a cast on his arm, gritted-teeth-cheerful support from his mother Heidi (Julianne Moore), whose busy work schedule and night classes make her a reluctantly absent parent, and a new therapist, who has given him an assignment: he must write a letter of encouragement and affirmation to himself.\", \"Through a series of chance encounters, that letter finds its way into the hands of Connor Murphy (Colton Ryan, a standby from the Broadway cast), a kid who almost vibrates with angry despair. (A fellow student, devastatingly, calls Connor's black nails \\\"very school shooter chic\\\".)\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/6faf8b149652485e32836ff8488e8631\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Chbosky told Vanity Fair: \\u201c[Ben's]\\u00a0understanding of the character is so complete and so profound. I couldn\\u2019t imagine anybody else playing it.\\u201d(Supplied: Universal)</div>\", \"When Connor dies by suicide, his grieving parents (Amy Adams and Danny Pino) discover Evan's letter amongst their son's possessions and assume that the two boys were friends. Evan, anxious and a little desperate for connection \\u2013 and still recovering from his own suicide attempt \\u2013 leans into the lie.\", \"There are ample opportunities for Evan to recant, but the Murphys are attentive and kind, and their daughter Zoe (Kaitlyn Dever) just happens to be someone Evan has had a crush on for years \\u2013 so he doubles down.\", \"It quickly becomes difficult to watch, as Evan recruits classmate Jared (Nik Dodani), a Hansen family friend, to craft a series of fake emails between Connor and Evan. When their classmate Alana (Amandla Stenberg) organises \\\"The Connor Project\\\" to raise awareness for young people struggling with their mental health, Evan's lie is at the heart of it. He goes inspo-viral, the Murphys all but adopt him, and the more Evan talks about Connor's hidden depths and relaxes his guard around the family, Zoe finds herself falling for him.\", \"But how far can this lie truly stretch?\", \"Written by Steven Levenson (Tick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!) and based on his script for the stage, the movie carves out space for its audiences to cry \\u2014 and hopes you cry so much you forget to interrogate its premise.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/27048655edc65c698d2250f220261f20\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Adams first saw the musical\\u00a0on Broadway in 2019 and\\u00a0knew immediately that\\u00a0she wanted to be a part of any potential movie adaptation.(Supplied: Universal)</div>\", \"This is helped along by the score, written by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (The Greatest Showman), creators of an inoffensively generic empowerment pop catalogue that prizes weepy catharsis over depth. Indeed, You Will Be Found, the film's backbone number, is The Greatest Showman's This Is Me for audiences who aren't yet ready to stand apart from the crowd.\", \"There's a little grit to balance out the film's heightened emotions, in large part due to Chbosky. It's an example of a director being a perfect match for the material: this musical is in clear conversation with angsty teen comings-of-age like Chbosky's own The Perks of Being a Wallflower (both his 1999 MTV Books novel and the 2012 film, which he directed).\", \"It's a refreshing adaptation, and the story moves smoother and easier on screen than it did on the stage \\u2014 the benefit of a questing and compassionate camera to guide us into the messy plot.\", \"Chbosky tackles the near-unforgivable story with sensitivity and a focus on detail \\u2013 close shots focus on\\u00a0Evan's nervously twisting fingers; the distraught curve of his lips \\u2013 to ensure that the audience, as much as it can, empathises with the protagonist.\", \"As such, much of the film's success rests on Platt's shoulders: we can't be against him.\", \"Dear Evan Hansen debuted on Broadway in 2016, where critics raved about Platt's nakedly emotional performance, and the film lingers on Platt's face so that we can observe the actor's commitment to Evan's pain. Vocals were, for the most part, recorded live on set, granting Platt the space and time to find his way into a song.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ad28c870eeb58845a9376db01243f739\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Platt, who faced backlash for taking the screen role, told YouTuber Zach Sang critics didn\\u2019t understand he had originated the part. \\\"Were I not to do the movie, it probably wouldn\\u2019t get made.\\\"(Supplied: Universal)</div>\", \"It's one of the smartest choices of the film, because while Platt's performance is overwrought and affected on screen (not helped by the fact that, at 27 during filming, he looks much older than his character), he's a superlative interpreter through song; when he acts through music, it feels as natural as breathing.\", \"Songs unspool from scenes like a gentle exhale; it's the language of unspeakable fears, sorrows, and love. In this way, the film soars: music is the least embarrassing of its emotional outbursts.\", \"Levenson's smart revisions from Broadway smooth out the rough edges of the stage show, which used theatrical suspension of disbelief to avoid discussing Evan's mental health with any specificity, and skirted around the true harm of Evan's lies \\u2014 not to mention, treated its supporting characters carelessly, leaving the young women dangerously underdeveloped.\", \"Now, Evan openly discusses his diagnoses and medication with Connor Project founder Alana. The Anonymous Ones, a new number created for the film (written by Pasek, Paul and Stenberg herself), helps to flesh out Alana's character and to better explain her motivations in committing to the cause of keeping Connor's memory alive; she sees herself in him.\", \"Zoe, too, is more clearly defined and compassionately drawn on the screen, thanks in part to Dever's complex performance, the stand-out of the film.\", \"But her romantic relationship with Evan still feels underwritten and ill-considered. On stage, the relationship began much earlier and felt much more manipulative; it benefits from taking its time on screen, but it remains an uncomfortable element, the deception at its centre making it almost unbearable to watch.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/754e7d23a2b0f5e28efa5c447114a20f\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Platt told NME that he shaved off his beard and lost weight to look \\u201cauthentic\\u201d as a 17-year-old in the film.(Supplied: Universal)</div>\", \"The score has been smartly trimmed (in time-honoured musical tradition, fragments of songs that have been cut are repurposed for the cinematic world, now played by the school's jazz band in an early pep rally scene) and other cuts ensure that we keep the focus mostly on Evan, and that the music \\u2013 the language of any musical's soul \\u2013 always swells for his pain.\", \"But what of Connor, the boy remembered through Evan's fantasy friendship?\", \"For a story that examines what happens when a tragedy is used for personal gain, Dear Evan Hansen often fails to heed its own warning. While Connor is finally given a new song of his own for the film, sung sweetly by Ryan, he remains more catalyst than character.\", \"It's easy to forgive Evan, who we know inside out, when we barely understand Connor at all. This is the fundamental problem that both the film and the stage show before it cannot solve: how can it investigate the reprehensibility of Evan's actions while ensuring we still love him? How can it uphold its message of caring for everybody when it forgets to care for the boy who died?\", \"While we spend much more time with Evan's comeuppance and redemption in the film than we do on stage, we still zip past the fallout Evan and the Murphys suffer once the lie is finally, inevitably revealed.\", \"But Dear Evan Hansen is heading somewhere else: to a big warm hug of an ending. It's neat and sentimental; we're left with a tear-jerker for the sake of tears.\", \"It's hard not to feel manipulated.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/9b5adbed864113a1fbdad094e8e1640a\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Platt told Vanity Fair about the movie\\u2019s \\u201cextended third act\\u201d redemption arc. \\u201cWe get to see a little bit more of \\u2026 the work that he does subsequently to make amends.\\u201d(Supplied: Universal)</div>\", \"Still, you might feel it tug at your inner teen. And it's not hard to imagine young, lonely viewers finding this film an outstretched hand they can squeeze for comfort \\u2013 a reminder that, as Heidi sings to her son when the sky is falling, the thing that feels too big to bear will one day \\\"all feel so small\\\".\", \"For those who need to hear they are worthy of love, the film provides. For those who want a satisfying, fearless story, a meaning behind all the tears, it does not.\", \"Dear Evan Hansen is in cinemas from December 9.\"]","href_hash":"e6aed56c57a111ecb6fc7f7833e9e965"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e6aed56c57a111ecb6fc7f7833e9e965"}},
