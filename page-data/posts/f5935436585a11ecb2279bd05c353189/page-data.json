I knew it was time.\\u201d\", \"Shuler has a long history with City Center. At 13, she danced there, as the young lead in \\u201cThe Nutcracker,\\u201d with New York City Ballet. Later, as a member of the Joffrey Ballet, she performed frequently at the theater, a neo-Moorish building, built in 1923 as a meeting hall for the Shriners, and dedicated by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia in 1943 as Manhattan\\u2019s first major performing arts center.\", \"\\u201cIt felt like coming home,\\u201d Shuler said, of taking the job at City Center, in 2003. Before that, Shuler, who received a law degree from Columbia University, held senior positions at several arts-related organizations, including the National Endowment for the Arts, Volunteer Lawyers for the Arts and the Howard Gilman Foundation.\", \"During her tenure, she has transformed City Center from a mostly rental space for dance companies to a producing house that commissions and presents, on average, around 60 percent of its annual programming, which also includes Encores!, a series of semi-staged revivals of Broadway shows that was started by her predecessor, Judith Daykin. In 2013, Shuler created Encores! Off Center to focus on Off Broadway musicals and underrepresented voices.\", \"A year after she began, Shuler started Fall for Dance, an eclectic annual smorgasbord of dance companies, with several different programs and $10 tickets. (In 2012 the price of a ticket went up to $15.) It was a masterstroke that redefined the theater\\u2019s identity, broadened its public and cemented relationships with artists.\", \"Kate Levin, who was the commissioner of the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs from 2002 to 2013, and who now oversees Bloomberg Philanthropies, said: \\u201cFrom Day 1, Arlene was astute about asking the right questions, like, \\u2018Is this giving rich people a cheap ticket? Who will come?\\u2019 She did her research properly first.\\u201d\", \"Shuler said that it was important to her to go back to the idea of a theater for the people that La Guardia had evoked in 1943. \\u201cNew York City Ballet was founded there, the Ballets Russes, American Ballet Theater, the Joffrey, Paul Taylor were there,\\u201d she said of City Center. \\u201cI wanted to give many different kinds of companies that opportunity, and make it accessible for people from all over New York.\\u201d\", \"David Hallberg, the former Ballet Theater principal who has performed in Fall for Dance and is now on City Center\\u2019s board, said that Shuler had been a mentor to him. \\u201cArlene is the same in all contexts,\\u201d he said. \\u201cShe doesn\\u2019t put one face on for an artist, another for a board member or the audience.\\u201d Now the director of the Australian Ballet, Hallberg said he had learned from her diplomatic, levelheaded, but truthful approach. \\u201cShe is passionate, but not dictatorial,\\u201d he said.\", \"Fall for Dance\\u2019s success greatly increased support from donors and foundations; Shuler said that City Center\\u2019s budget has increased from under $10 million in 2003 to $27.6 million today.\", \"Increased resources have enabled City Center to consistently present large-scale companies like Pacific Northwest Ballet, Nederlands Dans Theater, Christopher Wheeldon\\u2019s Morphoses, and Matthew Bourne\\u2019s New Adventures, and undertake partnerships with Sadler\\u2019s Wells in London and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, which has performed at the theater since 1971.\", \"Weathering the pandemic, Shuler said, was \\u201cextraordinarily hard and challenging, like it was for everyone.\\u201d Her decision to film work onstage, in the theater, commissioning new pieces from Jamar Roberts, Kyle Abraham and Wheeldon, among others, proved highly successful and worth the elaborate protocols and expenses, she said. City Center\\u2019s donors stayed on course, and government programs and some staff cutbacks enabled the theater to emerge without a deficit this year.\", \"\\u201cArlene is leaving with fiscal foundations in place, an artistic vision intact, and under some inspired leadership,\\u201d Levin said, referring to Stanford Makishi, the artistic director of dance programs, and Lear deBessonet, the new director of Encores! \\u201cThere is solidity and latitude; a great transition point.\\u201d\", \"Shuler said she would not be involved in choosing a successor, so couldn\\u2019t speak to whether the new hire would continue her strong focus on dance. \\u201cBut this is so much a part of what City Center does,\\u201d she said, \\u201cit seems unlikely they would hire someone who doesn\\u2019t have a strong interest in supporting dance and musical theater.\\u201d\", \"She added that she was not going to retire. \\u201cI love working in the arts,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI have plans.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"f5935436585a11ecb2279bd05c353189"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f5935436585a11ecb2279bd05c353189"}},
