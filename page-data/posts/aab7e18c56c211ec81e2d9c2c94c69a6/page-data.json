Yet he secured a stunning election win in May 2019.\", \"On Monday the closely watched Newspoll showed Morrison's coalition government would lose office to Labor.

The government was damaged after allegations this year of a rape in parliament house, fed by criticism of how senior government lawmakers handled the complaint.\", \"Spurred by public anger, Morrison commissioned a report into the workplace culture of parliament house. Published last week, it showed that one in three of those working there had experienced sexual harassment.\", \"The issue grew when the minister for education stood aside last week pending an investigation into allegations of abusive behaviour during an extramarital affair with a staffer, accusations the minister strongly denied.\", \"Morrison has also been wounded by attacks on his integrity after French President Emmanuel Macron said the prime minister had lied to him over a cancelled submarine deal.\", \"Labor used parliament to repeatedly raise questions of Morrison's credibility and trustworthiness, and the issue seems to have gained some traction with voters.\", \"Morrison concedes he is the underdog in the election, but government sources say the he is confident he can repeat the miracle win of 2019.\", \"\\\"He is a good campaigner, he does have that everyman feel to him, and people like him in key parts of the country,\\\" said Peter Chen, a professor of political science at the University of Sydney. \\\"He can definitely turn this around.\\\"\", \"- Reuters\"]","href_hash":"aab7e18c56c211ec81e2d9c2c94c69a6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"aab7e18c56c211ec81e2d9c2c94c69a6"}},
