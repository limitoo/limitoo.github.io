They must be well represented in the climate talks. \", \"\\\"The world cannot risk unambitious and unfair decisions being taken at COP26, there is far too much at stake.\\\"\", \"This follows a coalition of 1,500 green groups calling for the summit to be delayed because of Covid arrangements. \", \"But the UK government and the UN say they are planning to go ahead because the massive gathering is so important and they are working to keep it safe. \", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">So what are the risks? </div>\", \"Bringing together 30,000 people from every country on the planet - regardless of whether they've got the disease under control or not - is a challenge.\", \"Especially when the talks will be face-to-face, last for two weeks indoors during a Scottish winter when few will welcome opening windows to bring in virus-dispersing fresh air.\", \"And the event will be opened by people in the most vulnerable demographic: the Queen (aged 95), David Attenborough (95), the Pope (84) and President Biden (78). \", \"It comes as other events on a similar scale have not gone ahead as planned. \", \"China was due to hold a UN conference on biodiversity next month but switched to virtual sessions for the opening and normal talks next year.\", \"And while France has just hosted a congress in Marseilles on nature conservation, the numbers were far lower than usual with many joining via video. \", \"By contrast, officials planning COP26 say the future of the planet is at stake and that Zoom is no substitute for meeting in-person.
