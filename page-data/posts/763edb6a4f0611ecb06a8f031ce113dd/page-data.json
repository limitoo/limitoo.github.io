Territory government says it is pushing ahead with plans to reopen the Territory's borders next month\\u00a0despite repeated calls from Aboriginal health groups to delay the changes until remote vaccination rates improve.\", \"The NT government fast-tracked reopening plans last week when it halved the quarantine period for some vaccinated hotspot travellers and announced quarantine requirements would be scrapped altogether from December 20.\", \"Instead, all arrivals would be required to undergo a more stringent testing regime, with unvaccinated travellers barred from coming to the Territory.\", \"But as the Territory grapples with its worst coronavirus outbreak \\u2014 which has seen three remote communities locked down this month \\u2014 the Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance NT wants that plan delayed\\u00a0while another vaccine blitz is undertaken in remote communities.\", \"Aboriginal health groups including AMSANT have called for quarantine requirements to be maintained until remote communities reach 90-95\\u00a0per cent vaccination coverage.\", \"There are 55 remote communities across the NT with a full vaccination rate below 70 per cent, according to the latest NT government data.\", \"At a press conference on Friday, Health Minister Natasha Fyles said people in the Territory needed to \\\"learn to live with COVID\\\".\", \"\\\"We're not going to fall over at the final hurdle,\\\" Ms Fyles said.\", \"\\\"We have a regime of testing that will take place, we will learn over the next few weeks how that works and then everyone arriving into the Territory will be tested so that we can stop the spread of COVID-19, but we certainly won't be changing our measures dramatically.\\\"\", \"In a fiery speech\\u00a0yesterday condemning online misinformation about the army's role in the outbreak response, Mr Gunner said the protection of the NT's Aboriginal communities and \\\"tens of thousands of years of history, lore, custom and song\\\" was his main focus.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Current rates 'won't work':\\u00a0Congress</div>\", \"Central Australian Aboriginal Congress\\u00a0Chief Medical Officer Dr John Boffa said current vaccination rates will not be sufficient to protect the Indigenous community once the NT's borders\\u00a0reopen.\", \"Helped by a significant\\u00a0spike\\u00a0in the past\\u00a0two weeks, Dr Boffa said, double dose vaccination rates of Congress clients\\u00a0would, at best, only reach about 70 per cent by the time\\u00a0borders reopen.\", \"\\\"Once we hit December 20, if we go to no quarantine, soon after that we'll have\\u00a0COVID in the\\u00a0community,\\\" he told ABC Alice Springs on Friday.\", \"\\\"What we're relying on to control that is vaccination rates, and we still don't have them at\\u00a0a level that is\\u00a0going to work.\", \"\\\"The Doherty modelling made it really clear: we need to be at 90 per cent double dose\\u00a0to get good protection and stop an outbreak spreading.\\\"\", \"Dr Boffa pointed to the\\u00a0current COVID-19 outbreak in South Australia, which recently opened its borders to vaccinated travellers, as an example of how quickly COVID could enter the NT once borders open.\", \"\\\"People need to realise, we're at risk now \\u2026\\u00a0we've got to get our double\\u00a0dose rate up by December 20.\\\"\", \"On Thursday, Congress\\u00a0published a tweet saying it was\\u00a0communicating with clients and they were \\\"now in a race with a deadline to get everyone vaccinated\\\".\", \"\\\"The government is opening our borders on December 20,\\\" reads a new placard that has been placed in Congress clinics, according to the tweet.\", \"\\\"Get vaxxed now!\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Some remote vaccine rates improve</div>\", \"Concerted vaccination drives and the Katherine region coronavirus outbreak have led to a boost in vaccination rates in some remote communities, according to NT government data.\", \"The NT government has said the three remote communities sent into lockdown \\u2014\\u00a0Robinson River, Binjari and Rockhole \\u2014\\u00a0have all seen major jumps in first dose coverage.\", \"Further south, the overall first-dose vaccination rate for 24 Central Australian communities has jumped by 16 per cent this month, with 67 per cent of residents 16 and older now partially vaccinated.\", \"All remote communities across the Top End and East Arnhem regions now have a first-dose vaccination rate above 70 per cent.\", \"There are still at least four communities with vaccination rates below 20 per cent.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5d844ed63048c2469b68cb3ecde5796b\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">
