Google\\u2019s cloud unit prioritized preparation for a bid on a Pentagon contract, The New York Times revealed earlier this month, pulling engineers off other projects to focus on creating a winning proposal.\", \"The rush to pursue the contract is a dramatic shift for Google, which said in 2018 that it would not bid on a major cloud computing contract with the Defense Department, known as the Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, or JEDI, because the work would conflict with its A.I. principles.\", \"The JEDI cloud computing contract was estimated to be worth $10 billion over 10 years, and was awarded to Microsoft in 2019. But facing legal challenges from Amazon, the Pentagon scrapped the contract in July and announced a new plan to purchase cloud computing technology. The new version of the contract, known as the Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability, will split the work between multiple companies.\", \"The segmented nature of the contract allows Google to work on parts of the Pentagon cloud without violating its ban on weapons, Google executives told employees in the videoconference meeting on Thursday, a recording of which was obtained by The Times.\", \"The exact scope of the work is still unclear because the government has not submitted a formal request for proposal. While it has not been invited to bid, Google has said it is interested.\", \"In a blog post published the same day as the meeting, Thomas Kurian, who oversees the company\\u2019s cloud unit, wrote: \\u201cIf we are invited to be part of the J.W.C.C. contract, we will absolutely bid.\\u201d\", \"At the meeting, Mr. Kurian said there are many areas where Google\\u2019s capabilities and expertise can be applied \\u201cwith no conflict to Google\\u2019s A.I. principles.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe have governance processes that provide guidance and oversight into what A.I. products we will offer and what custom A.I. projects we will and we will not pursue, and we will follow those governance processes,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. Kurian\\u2019s remarks, which were reported earlier by CNBC, were made in response to a question from an employee about Google\\u2019s interest in the Pentagon contract and The New York Times\\u2019s reporting on it.\", \"\\u201cWe understand that not every Googler will agree with this decision, but we believe Google Cloud should seek to serve the government where it is capable of doing so and where the work meets Google\\u2019s A.I. principles and our company\\u2019s values,\\u201d Mr. Kurian said.\", \"Google\\u2019s chief executive, Sundar Pichai, echoed his remarks. \\u201cI think we are strongly committed to working with the government in a way that\\u2019s consistent with our A.I. principles,\\u201d Mr. Pichai said.\", \"A spokesman for Google declined to comment.\"]","href_hash":"1cf2f760466e11ec87ff0d1058909feb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1cf2f760466e11ec87ff0d1058909feb"}},
