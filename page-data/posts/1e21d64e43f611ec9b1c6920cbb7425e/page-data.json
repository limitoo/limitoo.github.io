It was as if all absurdity, all outrageousness was kept bottled up inside this kind and friendly young man, but once triggered could seemingly never be contained again. You released his hilarity at your peril. It could dissolve everything.\", \"I met Christos \\u2013 Chris, back then \\u2013 at university, in the dying days of a free university education, when being queer was still something to be fought for when everything was hugely, intensely political, even when it patently wasn't. (I still remember dating someone a bit older than me and not from campus when we spotted some graffiti: \\\"All sex is political\\\". He laughed and shook his head. \\\"No it's not \\u2013 between the sheets it's everyone for themselves.\\\")\", \"Chris was, of course, a brilliant writer even then. He became co-editor of the student paper and his year's edition bristled with chin and cheek.\", \"Many others knew him so much better than me; we orbited each other in a circle of boisterous and argumentative friends all of whom seemed set to burst with the impatience of their promise.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7757656c8f57a97b5e09120448485f4a\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> My boisterous, argumentative university friends seemed set to burst with the impatience of their promise.(ABC News: Kala Lampard)</div>\", \"But I was drawn to the warmth and rudeness in his shining eyes and his ease with the mess of people, their choices, their mistakes. I loved that about him. I love that always in his writing.\", \"We were both onlookers to a campus controversy, a kind of \\\"Me Too\\\"\\u00a0story of those times, and now have an\\u00a0agreement that if I don't get off my butt and write it within a certain time frame then it's his to tell. You know who'd do it better, of course.\", \"On Thursday, just a week or so after releasing his immensely moving and powerful roman a clef 7\\u00bd, Tsiolkas won the $60,000 Melbourne Prize, in recognition of an outstanding body of work and I found myself reading the news with the most ridiculous grin crinkling my eyes until the tears came.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Success isn't\\u00a0finite</div>\", \"There's something immensely moving about seeing the people you grew up with fulfilling their promise, completely becoming themselves.\", \"I know Gore Vidal famously said that every time he saw one of his friends succeed a little part of him died, but I don't regard success as so finite. We make our own, or it mysteriously comes to us. Either way, it seems to be an endlessly renewable source even if its spring can't always be found by everyone.\", \"I went to high school with a bunch of hilarious and easy-going boys and girls, where there seemed to be no divisions between us, academically or socially. We celebrated our successes in an unusually egalitarian way. Admiration ran in concentric circles, and it had no limit.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/7223d5246151f652f4928ba546f888c6\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> I went to high school with a bunch of hilarious and easy-going boys and girls, where there seemed to be no divisions between us, academically or socially.(Supplied: Unsplash/Vonecia Carswell)</div>\", \"(Our famous Year 10 prank was to swap uniforms one lunch time, a couple of year nine's running between the girls' and boys' toilets with the clothes. We reappeared for the afternoon classes seemingly appropriately attired, our teacher bewildered but unsure why: something was wrong \\u2013 but what was it? I'd never so much as kissed a boy by then, and I still remember the shock and thrill of slipping on a boy's shirt, damp under the arms from his sweat, his trousers still warm.)\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Look at her \\u2014 I know her!'</div>\", \"In the passing years my schoolyard friends have become such astonishingly complete versions of the kids they were. They have had their trials, and I shouldn't claim to have foreseen the changes brought about by their challenges, but I know they were there. Their successes are so varied, they are big and very small, and they prompt such a familiar little swell of my heart every time.\", \"It's that rush of pride at proximity to something you admire, of astonishment at one's good fortune or good judgement at knowing someone so grand: look at her \\u2013 I know her!\", \"A friend this week was appointed to a role so powerful that it was only until recently the sole preserve of a man, and we took her to dinner and toasted her, agape at her achievement.\", \"I have friends who do painful, hard, unheralded work that makes life a little easier for others whose names I will never know. I have friends who have grown up and now grow things themselves, or make things or design things or lead things and even though I know exactly why I have always loved them, their capacity still astonishes me.\", \"And I have friends who have raised such wonderfully kind, funny and insightful human beings from the soft bundles I cradled so many years ago that my faith in the future of the planet is immediately restored. Look what they have made.\", \"I watch all those I have known and loved as the years go by, and my surprise at life's circumstance placing me anywhere near them is unending. I want to shout to someone, anyone:\\u00a0look at these lovely people, look at my beautiful friends.\", \"This weekend I hope you'll read Luke Goodsell's terrific homage to the culture-changing cycle of Bond films that Daniel Craig now leaves with his final 007 turn, No Time to Die. I still count Craig's debut and the franchise's reboot, Casino Royale,\\u00a0 not only the best Bond film of all time, but a top 20 movie favourite. It also has one of the greatest, most thematically perfect Bond themes ever written, and sorry \\u2013 no correspondence will be entered into here.\", \"And Zan Rowe has perfectly captured the soaring joy of the return of live music with her beautiful interactive: I'll meet her at the sound desk any time.\\u00a0\", \"Have a safe and happy weekend and now that my diary is starting to whine and complain whenever I try to cram something else into it, I think it needs a little reminder of why I'm grabbing every moment of life right now \\u2013 there's nothing more than this.\", \"Go well.\", \"Virginia Trioli is presenter on Mornings on\\u00a0ABC Radio\\u00a0Melbourne and the former co-host of\\u00a0ABC\\u00a0News Breakfast.\"]","href_hash":"1e21d64e43f611ec9b1c6920cbb7425e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1e21d64e43f611ec9b1c6920cbb7425e"}},
