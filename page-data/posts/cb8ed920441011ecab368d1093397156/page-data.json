Al Sharpton in the courtroom this week had been \\u201cintimidating\\u201d to jurors \\u2014 and then added, \\u201cWe don\\u2019t want any more Black pastors coming in here\\u201d \\u2014 Mr. Sharpton, like many others, seemed equally offended and astonished.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve been through a lot of trials over the decades,\\u201d Mr. Sharpton, the 67-year-old civil rights veteran and TV personality, said in an interview with TMZ. \\u201cI\\u2019ve never had a lawyer ask that I not be able to come to court.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gough\\u2019s call on Thursday for Judge Timothy R. Walmsley to ban what Mr. Gough called \\u201chigh-profile members of the African American community\\u201d from the Brunswick, Ga., courtroom has been widely condemned. \\u201cIt says something that has been long part of the racist mind-set, that Blackness equals intimidation,\\u201d said the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, another civil rights leader who visited the Glynn County Courthouse this week.\", \"The statements also seem to fit a pattern of provocation from a lawyer who, both during this trial and long before, seems to thrive on it.\", \"Last week, Mr. Gough tried to call for a mistrial in the case before opening statements. He sought to convince Judge Walmsley that it was unconstitutional to have jurors come to court on Veterans Day. And he tried unsuccessfully to have peaceful demonstrators \\u2014 most of whom are calling for justice for Mr. Arbery \\u2014 moved from the front lawn of the courthouse on grounds that they might \\u201cintimidate or influence the jury.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gough represents the defendant William Bryan, who goes by Roddie. He is facing a possible life sentence for his role in trying to detain Mr. Arbery as he ran through the Satilla Shores neighborhood near Brunswick in February 2020.\", \"On Friday morning, after the outrage over his comments spread online, Mr. Gough issued an apology in court to \\u201canyone who might have inadvertently been offended.\\u201d In a brief phone interview on Friday evening, he added: \\u201cI have nothing against Al Sharpton. But I don\\u2019t represent Al Sharpton. Not today, anyway. In this trial, I represent Roddie Bryan, and my duty is to ensure that Mr. Bryan receives a fair trial.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gough, 59, is a well-known presence in the small legal community of Brunswick, population 16,000, in contrast with the other two defendants\\u2019 lawyers, who hail from the larger metropolitan areas of Atlanta and Macon.\", \"It is Mr. Gough\\u2019s demeanor that most closely resembles that of an aw-shucks country lawyer character from the movies, with a voice that honks and drawls and tends to ladle on the folksiness. On Thursday, as he called for \\u2014 and then appeared to backpedal on \\u2014 a ban on Black preachers in the courtroom, Mr. Gough wondered aloud what it would be like \\u201cif a bunch of folks came in here dressed like Colonel Sanders with white masks sitting in the back.\\u201d\", \"But Mr. Gough\\u2019s presentation is, like so much about him, confounding, and sometimes contradictory. Though he attended law school at the University of Georgia, Mr. Gough grew up on Long Island. He spent a number of years heading up the Republican Party in Glynn County, Ga., and said he served for two years as legal director of a group called the Poor and Minority Justice Association. From 1989 to 1993, he served as a prosecutor in the local district attorney\\u2019s office. For four years starting in 2012, he represented the poorest defendants in his community as the Brunswick Judicial Circuit public defender.\", \"He was fired from the public defender job for a number of reasons. Among them was the allegation that he fomented a culture of \\u201cfear and intimidation\\u201d in the office, according to statements during his appeals hearing from Bryan P. Tyson, who was then the executive director of the state public defender council.\", \"Mr. Tyson, in a letter firing Mr. Gough, noted that a female employee in Mr. Gough\\u2019s office had accused him of retaliation after she had filed a sexual harassment complaint against another employee. The state public defender \\u201ccredited her claim of retaliation,\\u201d Mr. Tyson wrote, and \\u201ctook remedial action.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Tyson also chided Mr. Gough for engaging in a \\u201cmedia campaign\\u201d that took aim at the Brunswick-area district attorney at the time, Jackie Johnson. Mr. Gough had publicly accused Ms. Johnson of failing to file cases in a timely manner, a move that he said wasted taxpayer money and impeded indigent clients\\u2019 right to a speedy trial.\", \"Mr. Tyson said in his letter that Mr. Gough had also accused the district attorney of being too cozy with the local police, and said that Mr. Gough had complained that the Superior Court was being run \\u201cas a debtors\\u2019 prison,\\u201d issuing steep restitution and probation fees to the poor.\", \"On Friday, Mr. Gough declined to comment on the firing. But at the time, his dismissal was fervently opposed by the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter.\", \"\\u201cTake the person who is most capable of defending the poor, the needy and the downtrodden and remove him from the office, what will they replace it with? With someone who will go about to get along,\\u201d the Rev. Dr. Leonard Small, an African American civil rights activist, said at that time in his defense of Mr. Gough, according to a TV news report.\", \"Mr. Gough threatened to go on a hunger strike if a number of demands by the N.A.A.C.P. pertaining to the local justice system were not met.\", \"Last year, Ms. Johnson was voted out of office amid criticism of her role in the Arbery case, in which his three pursuers walked free for weeks after the killing. This year, a grand jury indicted Ms. Johnson on the charges of obstruction of the police and violating her public oath, on grounds that she showed \\u201cfavor and affection\\u201d to one of the defendants in the case, Gregory McMichael, who had formerly worked in her office as an investigator.\", \"Long before the trial about Mr. Arbery\\u2019s death started, Mr. Gough raised eyebrows by appearing on CNN with his client, who had not yet been arrested, and intervening when the anchor, Chris Cuomo, tried to ask Mr. Bryan questions about the case.\", \"\\u201cMy client is a mechanic with a high school education, and if you\\u2019ve ever been to the high schools around here, that\\u2019s not necessarily saying much, OK?\\u201d Mr. Gough said.\", \"Three days before Mr. Bryan\\u2019s arrest, Mr. Gough released a statement saying that his client, who had recorded the killing of Mr. Arbery on his phone, was merely a witness to the February 2020 shooting.\", \"Mr. Gough even pleaded with two high-profile lawyers working with Mr. Arbery\\u2019s family, Ben Crump and S. Lee Merritt, to stop calling for Mr. Bryan to be charged, arguing that they had made Mr. Bryan a \\u201csitting duck\\u201d for retaliatory attacks.\", \"\\u201cKilling off the star witness for the prosecution will not help bring Ahmaud\\u2019s killers to justice,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"cb8ed920441011ecab368d1093397156"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cb8ed920441011ecab368d1093397156"}},
