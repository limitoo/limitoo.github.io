Suave 24-Hour Protection Aerosol Antiperspirant Fresh. The recall covers all products with an expiration date through September 2023.\", \"The company said exposure to benzene can cause leukemia, blood cancer and blood disorders \\u2014 but noted that people can be exposed to benzene on a daily basis.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Based on an independent health hazard evaluation, daily exposure to benzene in the recalled products at the levels detected in testing would not be expected to cause adverse health consequences,\\\" the company said.
