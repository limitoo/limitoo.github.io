In 2018, the numbers rose by 1 percent, then rose another 2 percent in 2019. That year, the rate of abortions per 1,000 women of child-bearing age rose another 1 percent.\", \"However, the CDC said this data must be interpreted cautiously, as it is based on voluntary reporting. Also, it does not include data from three states, including California, the country's most populous state.\", \"The Guttmacher Institute, a New York-based nonprofit research organization that supports abortion rights, told the AP this means that as much as 30 percent of U.S. abortions might not have been reflected in the data. The CDC also worries that some states might have significant undercounts.\", \"The Guttmacher Institute conducts a survey of all U.S. abortion providers every three years. Rachel Jones, the project's lead researcher, told the AP the CDC and the institute's reports have historically shown similar trends, despite the CDC's data gaps. The institute's next survey is due to come out next year.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939932/abortion-pro-choice.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">U.S. abortions appear to be inching up after a long decline, though officials are cautious about calling it an upward trend because a government report issued November 24 is incomplete.

The abortion rate was 11.4 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15\\u201344 years. That year, 56 percent of the reported abortions were surgical and about 44 percent were through use of the so-called abortion pill.\", \"The report also showed about 18 percent of all pregnancies in the U.S. ended in abortion.\", \"Jones noted that it is hard to make general statements about U.S. abortion trends because there can be dramatic differences from one state to the next. And numbers in one state can increase if women are traveling there from other states.\", \"It's not yet clear what abortion trends will look like for 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. Some states\\u2014including Indiana, Iowa and Kansas\\u2014have reported increases. But it's possible that abortions declined in many places during lockdowns, Jones said.\", \"\\\"Whatever happened in 2020 wasn't just a matter of a long-term trend. It also was impacted by COVID,\\\" she said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939941/abortion-pro-choice-pro-life-protest.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Though 2017 marked the lowest rate of abortions since 1973, CDC data is showing it inching back upward, though the data is incomplete.
