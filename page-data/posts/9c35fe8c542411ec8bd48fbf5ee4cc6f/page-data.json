But the two became close enough to decide together that they wanted to attend Stratton Mountain School, an independent boarding and day school in Stratton, Vt., that focuses on college preparatory academics and competitive winter sports.\", \"After graduation they spent several years apart, though always kept in touch. Mr. Davis, at 18, began to make a name for himself on the snowboarding circuit and bought a home in Truckee, Calif., which became his base of operations.

He did not disagree.\", \"\\u201cI was so nervous that when I got down on one knee, I could not think of anything to say, and I just froze,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI have been interviewed a million times, but in a situation like that, I just could not find a way to string two words together.\\u201d\", \"The couple\\u2019s Nov. 29 marriage took place at the clerk\\u2019s office of the County of Nevada in Nevada City, Calif. Carrie McReynolds, the deputy commissioner of marriages, solemnized their license.\", \"Earlier that month, they hosted a wedding celebration on Nov. 19 at the TeiTiare Estate, a rental property in Sayulita, Mexico, during which the bride and groom exchanged personal vows before 122 mostly vaccinated guests.\", \"For the celebration, the bride wore a Vera Wang wedding gown and veil, shoes by Prada and a diamond necklace and sapphire earrings supplied by her mother.

Now a bit old for a game that involves death-defying tricks in midair, he said that some of his crowd-pleasing favorites are \\u201cthe 1080, the 1260, the 900, and the McTwist, among others.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Davis, who was voted 2006 rookie of the year in the Transworld Snowboarding Riders\\u2019 Poll Awards, was also asked if he thought his best snowboarding days were behind him, or if he had plans to become snowboarding\\u2019s version of Tom Brady.\", \"\\u201cTom Brady?\\u201d said Mr. Davis, laughing along with Ms. Simpson at the question.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know about that, but I will do this snowboard thing as long as my sponsors will allow me to do it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI would hate for my career to end but if it does, I can live comfortably for the rest of my life knowing that had I not gotten involved with snowboarding, I would have never met Haley, who means the world to me.\\u201d\", \"When Nov. 29, 2021\", \"Where The clerk\\u2019s office of the County of Nevada in Nevada City, Calif.\", \"Party Planner Mr. Davis said the idea for the couple\\u2019s larger celebration was inspired by Ms. Simpson\\u2019s sister\\u2019s wedding. \\u201cA couple of years ago, Hayley\\u2019s sister, Shelby, got married and everyone was having so much fun and looking so beautiful. I never had as much fun at a wedding as I did that night.\\u201d\", \"Remembering Jerry The couple left their three-day wedding celebration in Mexico a day early, after receiving word that their 12-year-old Irish wolfhound, Jerry, who was suffering from cancer, was taken to an emergency room. He died three days later. \\u201cHe was an amazing dog with a big personality,\\u201d Ms. Simpson said of Jerry, who was rescued by Mr. Davis from the Reno Humane Society when he was two years old. \", \"Games Off Mr. Davis, citing a busy schedule, said he will not be trying out for a spot in the upcoming 2022 Olympic Games in Beijing. \\u201cMy focus is elsewhere in snowboarding right now, the halfpipe event at the Olympics is quite a grind.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9c35fe8c542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9c35fe8c542411ec8bd48fbf5ee4cc6f"}},
