I'm here picking up sticks and woodchips to burn in my kiln. This is the oldest graveyard in L.A.\\\"\", \"He zooms in on the ground and films what appears to be a wooden box, tied with what could be string, with one side loose after years of decay.\", \"\\\"What is this?\\\" he continues, as he films with one hand and uses the other to unwrap the box.\", \"Tarpit continues: \\\"No part two we're opening this right now. I can see something in there but it looks kind of gross. It's all wrapped up, is that a mummy?\\\"\", \"Inside the box is a small, figurine-type object, which appears to have been tightly bound with string or thread.\", \"He says: \\\"Okay I have seen what I needed to see. It's something tiny all wrapped up in string. And we're going to put it back to rest, don't you think?\\\"\", \"Tarpit put everything back where he found it and covered it up with some wood.\", \"The clip, shared last week, amassed more than 200,000 views, and can be seen here.\", \"Underlining what he thought he found, he added the on-screen caption \\\"mummy,\\\" while also adding the hashtags #mummy #graveyard #scary and #cursed.\", \"The clip drew numerous comments, as some people claimed what he found may have been a fetus.\", \"Christina Breen said: \\\"People used to do that with babies that were miscarried. They would bind them and stick them in trees. Pretty sure that is what you found.\\\"\", \"Lil Walt agreed, saying: \\\"Maybe a fetus.\\\"\", \"Shelby Lynn Gruhn commented: \\\"When you go to walk the dog and bring home a fetus spirit.\\\"\", \"Adreena thought: \\\"I think it's baby.\\\"\", \"\\\"Small pet or miscarried fetus, most likely the latter,\\\" Dayan Marquina said.\", \"In response, Tarpit added in the comments: \\\"It never crossed my mind it could be human remains. Letting it get mulched with the stump seemed fitting and fine.\", \"\\\"It seems more proportioned for a doll or a bird imo [in my opinion]. But I can totally go back and we can rebury somewhere it won't get disturbed.\\\"\", \"Others had similar opinions, or thought he'd unleashed some bad energy, with Mark W. Caponigro reckoning: \\\"Someone's pet buried by the tree decades ago?\\\"\", \"Jonathan Bessey wrote: \\\"General rule of thumb. If you find a weird box or a bottle filled with odd stuff that was buried; no touchy.\\\"\", \"Joshaperans joked: \\\"Great... can't wait to see what curse you unleashed for 2022.\\\"\", \"MatImmortal asked: \\\"Why would you open anything in a graveyard.\\\"\", \"WhilemSarah Bartell added: \\\"My friend. Do you want a haunted house? Cuz this is how you get a haunted house.\\\"\", \"According to travel website and book, Atlas Obscura, the cemetery has graves dating back to the 1830s, as families relocated their loved ones there after it opened.\", \"It said: \\\"Tucked away in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of East L.A., this 67-acre park is the final resting place for many of Los Angeles' past mayors, prominent citizens, and pioneers.\\\"\", \"The graveyard, which has more than 300,000 people buried there, has areas dedicated to Armenians, Serbs, Chinese-Americans, and hundreds of carnival workers.\", \"A monument in the center pays tribute to soldiers of Japanese descent who fought in the 442nd Infantry Regimental Combat Unit in WWII.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1944886/file-photo-graveyard.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">File photo of a graveyard.
