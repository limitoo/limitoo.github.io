The sketch soon went viral across the Internet, with social media abuzz over the bizarre image.\", \"Maxwell had interacted with Rosenberg during the trial a number of times, the artist said. This included smiling and waving at her on the day that the viral courtroom sketch was drawn.\", \"Rosenberg stated that Maxwell continued to smile and wave at her during the trial beyond when she had been sketched the first time, including the past few days.\", \"She also said that Maxwell had even spoken to her once during the proceedings.\", \"On that occasion, Maxwell had reportedly gotten close to Rosenberg, and quietly mentioned through her attorney that it was a \\\"long day, isn't it?\\\", to which Rosenberg agreed with her.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946358/ghislaine-maxwell.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Newsweek spoke to courtroom sketch artist Jane Rosenberg regarding a bizarre encounter she had in court with Ghislaine Maxwell where Maxwell appeared to draw her own sketch.

[Maxwell] sketched me a few times in a row,\\\" Rosenberg told Intelligencer. \\\"Then she started nodding at me and waving at me.\\\"\", \"\\\"It's really great for me. I'm not going to wreck it. I'm going to keep it going,\\\" she added.\", \"Rosenberg also added that there were some challenges in sketching anonymous victims who were called to testify.
