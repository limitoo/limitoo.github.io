A Gen Z model blew out birthday candles. A book signing at Gucci. The tropical bacchanal of art fairs, private dinners and A-list parties known as Art Basel Miami Beach has returned with a vengeance. Here are some highlights from Wednesday night.\", \"There was a long line at the Gucci store in Miami\\u2019s Design District, but this time it was for a book. Mickalene Thomas and her partner Racquel Chevremont were signing copies of their new art book, \\u201cMonograph.\\u201d Less bookish fans posed in front of neon lights and disco balls for the perfect selfie.\", \"Occasion: A book signing and cocktail party for Ms. Thomas.\", \"The Room: The second floor of Gucci\\u2019s shiny store, with images of Ms. Thomas\\u2019s work displayed on giant screens.\", \"In Attendance: Ms. Thomas; Ms. Chevremont; Michael Chow, the restaurateur, and his wife, Vanessa Rano; Tourmaline, an activist; and models including Selah Marley.\", \"The Food: Nina Compton, a chef from New Orleans, served hot fried chicken, tuna tartare and jerked tofu.\", \"The Mood: \\u201cI\\u2019m really excited to see the work at the Untitled Art Fair tomorrow,\\u201d Ms. Thomas said. \\u201cThey do a beautiful job of displaying the work, and it doesn\\u2019t look like you\\u2019re going through a mall.\\u201d\", \"Jordan Barrett, a model once labeled, by Vogue, an \\u201cIt Boy,\\u201d said he has never had a proper birthday party before. So he invited 40 of his closest friends at Art Basel to help him celebrate.\", \"Occasion: Mr. Barrett turned 25. He was also promoting his sparkling sake brand, Hape.\", \"The Room: Gitano Miami, the South Beach outpost of the clubby Mexican restaurant in Tulum.\", \"The Food: Small shared plates like queso with chorizo, guacamole and branzino with kiwi.\", \"In Attendance: Mr. Barrett; his partner Fernando Augusto Casablancas; Ricky Thompson, an actor; Chloe Wise, an artist; Candice Swanepoel, a model; and the musician Duckwrth.\", \"Moment of the Night: Around 11 p.m., Mr. Barrett blew out the candles on two large cakes, one that resembled his sparkling sake can.\", \"The Mood: \\u201cThe moment I leave here I really want to get away from as many people as I can and be alone for a moment,\\u201d Mr. Barrett said of his holiday plans. \\u201cI want to be in the jungle and in nature, so hopefully I can go to the waterfall in Las Palmas.\\u201d\", \"The mezcal was flowing, and the dance floor was wet with spilled drinks. After midnight, partygoers squeezed themselves into a basement lounge for a late-night performance by Offset.\", \"Occasion: Flaunt, a fashion magazine from Los Angeles, celebrated its latest issue.\", \"The Room: The downstairs lounge at Gale, a South Beach hotel, decorated with tropical wallpaper.\", \"In Attendance: The hip-hop musicians Offset and Quavo; Michele Lamy, the fashion designer; the actor Ansel Elgort; Shaun Ross, a model and musician; and Cuba Gooding Jr., the actor.\", \"Moment of the Night: After some technical glitches, during which Offset requested a few shots of tequila to fill the awkward silence, he performed two songs including \\u201cBad and Boujee,\\u201d around 1:30 a.m.\", \"The Mood: \\u201cI was signing books that featured me doing a few things with Offset, but mainly I am here in Miami for Virgil,\\u201d Ms. Lamy said, referring to Virgil Abloh, who died last week. A Louis Vuitton show on Monday became an impromptu tribute. \\u201cThe show was absolutely great, it was the best thing we ever saw of him. It\\u2019s difficult, but it brought people together. On Monday I\\u2019m going to Chicago for the funeral.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"adf02dd8546e11ec840eede6e8a4b73a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"adf02dd8546e11ec840eede6e8a4b73a"}},
