It is all around us in our oceans, rivers, clouds and our bodies.

of mineral grains attached to asteroids or as dust particles, we find a very thin layer of water that is associated with a very thin layer of hydrogen that has a solar contribution,\\\" said study co-author Steve Reddy of Curtin University.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Light vs heavy water</div>\", \"Most of the water on Earth, known as light water, is made up of two atoms of hydrogen bound to one atom of oxygen (H2O).\", \"But a small amount of water on Earth is made out of heavier atoms of deuterium \\u2014\\u00a0an isotope of hydrogen with an added neutron \\u2014\\u00a0bound to an atom

\"Most comets and asteroids contain water with a slightly higher ratio of deuterium to hydrogen than on Earth.\", \"\\\"So there's always\\u00a0been a bit of\\u00a0an ongoing debate about how that light component of water gets to Earth,\\\" Professor Reddy said.\", \"Only one type of asteroid, known as an enstatite chondrite, contains a similar ratio to water on Earth, but they are very rare, so they can't account for the total amount of light water.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Getting down to an atomic level</div>\", \"To find the missing source of water, the team led by Luke Daly turned to a technique known as atom probe tomography to study the chemical structure of grains of dust from an asteroid called\\u00a0Itokawa.\", \"<img

words, the hydrogen breaks the bonds of silicon and oxygen in the olivine, and combines with oxygen to make hydroxl (OH) and water (H2O).\", \"The team said\\u00a0the discovery also meant\\u00a0there could be untapped reservoirs of water on the Moon, as well as asteroids.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Really neat' for the Moon \\u2026</div>\", \"The ability to trace water in the crust of a speck of dust is \\\"really neat\\\", said geochronologist Trevor Ireland of the Australian National University, who was not involved in the study.\", \"\\\"It's an amazing result in terms of being able to resolve differences in the content in the last 50 microns to be able to establish that it's water,\\\" said Professor Ireland, who previously analysed samples from Itokawa.\", \"He said the potential of the solar wind to generate water had\\u00a0important implications for establishing a base on the Moon.\", \"\\\"If you can establish that there is actually water being generated in the lunar soil by proton bombardment by solar wind, then that gives a potential resource in the future for water supply.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">But what about Earth?</div>\", \"Whether or not the solar wind was a major contributor of water to the dust that made up Earth is still up for debate.\", \"\\\"Going back 4.5 billion years and trying to assemble players and the timing becomes rather complicated,\\\" Professor Ireland said.\", \"But, he said, the finding opened up the possibility that light water was delivered to the Earth on asteroids later on.\", \"Different types of asteroids have different levels of water content, while some, like Itokawa, are only wet on their surface, others can contain up to 10 per cent water.\", \"\\\"There are lots of potential sources of water in the Solar System and they all have distinct signatures, both in hydrogen, as well as oxygen isotopes.\", \"\\\"So going forward, we'd like to see some of those predictions tested by looking at oxygen isotopes and potentially nailing down the proportion of these sources in the early Solar System,\\\" he said.\", \"<img
