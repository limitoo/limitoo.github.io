A boat with 157 migrants on board, two of them women, has arrived on July 4, 2023 at the port of Los Cristianos, in the municipality of Arona, in the south of Tenerife, on the Spanish Canary island of Tenerife, Red Cross sources have reported. The vessel was located through the Integrated External Surveillance System (SIVE) when it was about 8 miles from the Punta Rasca area, and the Maritime Rescue's vessel Salvamar Alpheratz came out to meet it. The Salvamar Alpheratz accompanied the boat to the port of Los Cristianos, where it arrived at around 4:00 p.m. on July 4, 2023.
