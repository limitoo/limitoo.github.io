It was the second Houthi attack in a week targeting the United Arab Emirates, which is part of the Saudi-led coalition that has been at war with the Houthis in Yemen for years.\", \"\\u201cU.S. military forces successfully reacted to multiple inbound threats during an attack near Abu Dhabi,\\u201d the U.S. Air Force said, without providing further details.\", \"At Al Dhafra Air Base in Abu Dhabi, which hosts the U.S. Air Force\\u2019s 380th Air Expeditionary Wing, American forces were on a heightened state of alert and spent about an hour in security bunkers after the missile alert sounded, according to a statement from Lt.
