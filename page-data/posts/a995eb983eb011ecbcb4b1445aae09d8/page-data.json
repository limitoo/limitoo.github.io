A broken fence was also discovered, police said, which is likely how the thieves made their way onto the property.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927632/condom-wrappers.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Two vehicles holding around $90,000 CAD worth of the highly rated Skyn condoms and other sexual supplies were stolen from a parking lot in Ontario, Canada, authorities said.</div>\", \"Police were unsure if the thieves had chosen a random trailer to carjack, or if they had specifically chosen their target because of its contents.\", \"It is also unclear exactly how many thieves took part in the ploy. Police are reportedly looking for at least two suspects, but have said there could be more.\", \"Police are currently reviewing surveillance footage and are urging members of the public to come forward if they have any information.\", \"\\\"Hopefully if the person(s) responsible try to get rid of these products, either by giving them away, selling or even dumping them somewhere, someone will see it and report it,\\\" Constable Patti Cote of the Ontario Provincial Police told CBC News.\", \"The $72,000 was mostly made up of Skyn condoms, a brand of non-latex-based condoms sold across the world. Skyn is run by LifeStyles Global, which also manufactures popular condom brands like LifeStyles in the United States and Manix in the United Kingdom and other countries in Europe.\", \"It is also one of the oldest companies of its type in existence, with a history dating to at least 1905.\", \"Originally an Australian corporation, LifeStyles Global was bought out by a Chinese company in 2017. Today, it calls itself \\\"a global leader in the sexual wellness sector.\\\"\", \"The corporation owns a number of the top-selling condoms across the world, and The New York Times named a pair of LifeStyles varieties as two out of the three best condoms on the market in 2021.\", \"The theft comes as the value of condoms and sexual wellness brands continues to skyrocket. Statista estimates that the global condom market will be worth over $11 billion within the next two years.\"]","href_hash":"a995eb983eb011ecbcb4b1445aae09d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a995eb983eb011ecbcb4b1445aae09d8"}},
