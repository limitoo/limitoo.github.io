It was also believed that their bodies would quickly destroy 10% of their red blood cells to balance this shift, and red blood cell count would return to normal after 10 days in space, the release said.\\u00a0\", \"But the research team discovered that being in space was actually the cause of the red blood cell destruction by measuring the red blood cell counts of the 14 astronauts over six months in space. The researchers didn't measure red blood cell counts directly, but they used a measurement of carbon monoxide \\u2014 which is released when a part of a red blood cell is destroyed \\u2014 as a proxy.\\u00a0\", \"On Earth, human bodies create and kill 2 million red blood cells every second \\u2014 but in space, they destroy 3 million every second, the researchers said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Our study shows that upon arriving in space, more red blood cells are destroyed, and this continues for the entire duration of the astronaut's mission,\\\" Trudel continued.\\u00a0\", \"Both male and female astronauts experienced the same red blood cell destruction, and five of 13 astronauts were clinically anemic upon landing, the researchers said in the release. One astronaut did not have blood drawn upon landing.\", \"\\\"Thankfully, having fewer red blood cells in space isn't a problem when your body is weightless,\\\" Trudel said. \\\"But when landing on Earth and potentially on other planets or moons, anemia affecting your energy, endurance, and strength can threaten mission objectives. The effects of anemia are only felt once you land, and must deal with gravity again.\\\"\", \"After the astronauts returned to Earth, it took three to four months for red blood cell counts to return to normal \\u2014 but the scientists found that a year after landing, red blood cell death was still 30% higher than it was before the space mission.\", \"\\\"This is the best description we have of red blood cell control in space and after return to Earth,\\\" said Trudel. \\\"These findings are spectacular, considering these measurements had never been made before and we had no idea if we were going to find anything. We were surprised and rewarded for our curiosity.\\\"\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"1bb492bc758c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"1bb492bc758c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
