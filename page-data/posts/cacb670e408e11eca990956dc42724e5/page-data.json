The experience was a once in a lifetime experience. It was absolutely beautiful! ... I saw the co-captain crying, I was right next to her, and the captain [was] shocked. I knew this was a once in a lifetime experience. So I started feeling in awe and speechless.\\\"\", \"In a blog post about the trip, San Diego Whale Watch said the company had not seen this pod of orcas, known as CA216S, for three years. It said the pod surfaced \\\"right near the boat\\\" and that the albino newborn had been dubbed \\\"Frosty\\\" as it lacked the dark pigmentation that would normally produce the regular black and white skin tone. \\\"A special day on the water for all who were lucky enough to experience the magical sight that left everyone speechless,\\\" it said.\", \"The pod was also filmed by Gone Whale Watching San Diego, which said in a Facebook post that the calf was \\\"extremely playful.\\\"\", \"White orca are extremely rare, with very few cases recorded. The cause behind their coloration is unclear, but it is thought to be the result of leucism, which is characterized by the loss of pigmentation causing a white or pale coloration.\", \"Another young white orca from a different pod was filmed by researchers working off the coast of Alaska in 2020. In an Instagram post, marine biologist Stephanie Hayes said this animal, named Tl'uk, was two years old and appeared to be a healthy member of the pod T046. She said there are only around five live white orcas in the world.\", \"Earlier this year, two white orcas were spotted off the coast of Japan during a whale watching expedition. In a Facebook post, Gojiraiwa Kanko Whale Watching shared images of the pair saying it was their first ever observation of white orcas.\", \"Laura Millen said the tour guides knew the white orca was a baby as it was swimming \\\"right up against the momma.\\\"\", \"\\\"They were so graceful and were swimming right around the boat,\\\" she said. \\\"When they went under the co-captain said she was going to wait seven minutes for them to come back up. That's when they were swimming in a row. It was like they wanted us to watch them swim together.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"cacb670e408e11eca990956dc42724e5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cacb670e408e11eca990956dc42724e5"}},
