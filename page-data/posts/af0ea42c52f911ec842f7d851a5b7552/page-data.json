The causeway was dredged to accommodate the runway barge, which was decorated with birch trees and black paper airplanes, a recurring theme in Mr. Abloh\\u2019s work.\", \"The front row included longtime supporter Kanye West, who sat next to Kim Kardashian and their daughter North. Also making their first major appearance since the 2020 presidential election were Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, who wore a bright pink Louis Vuitton dress.\", \"Attendees were instructed not to grant interviews, out of respect for Mr. Virgil\\u2019s family.\", \"Also seated front row were Rihanna and ASAP Rocky, Pharrell Williams, Joe Jonas, Ricky Martin, Venus Williams, Bella Hadid, 21 Savage and Joan Smalls. The Arnault clan, who originally were not intending to come, walked in just as the show began around 6 p.m., clad in black.\", \"A hush fell over the crowd as Michael Burke, the brand\\u2019s chief executive, gave a short and emotional speech. \\u201cLike all of you, Virgil\\u2019s passing remains inconceivable to me,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHe was born the same year as my oldest child, and I considered him like a son.\\u201d\", \"He was not the only one who held back tears. After the 18-minute show, which included a few new looks and outfits from Vuitton\\u2019s spring 2022 men\\u2019s wear collection, Mr. Abloh\\u2019s voice filled the dark stadium: \\u201cLife is so short that you can\\u2019t waste even a day subscribing to what someone thinks you can do, versus knowing what you can do.\\u201d\", \"The arena was illuminated in rainbow colors, and huge fireworks sparkled in the sky. Many in the crowd embraced as tears streamed down their faces. \\u201cIt feels like we\\u2019re at a beautiful funeral,\\u201d one attendee was overheard saying.\", \"Guests departed the barge and followed a red carpet to the after-party, stopping to pose in front of a three-story statue of Mr. Abloh wearing sunglasses and carrying a branded portfolio.\", \"Just before 7 p.m., as the mood shifted from somber to party mode, a drone light show filled the sky. It began as a paper plane, before morphing into iterations of the Louis Vuitton monogram, a palm tree and the initials \\u201cL.V.,\\u201d which turned into \\u201cV.A.\\u201d For the finale, the drones spelled \\u201cVirgil was here\\u201d; within moments, photos of the display could be seen across social media.\"]","href_hash":"af0ea42c52f911ec842f7d851a5b7552"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"af0ea42c52f911ec842f7d851a5b7552"}},
