In nearly all these docs, there\\u2019s a scene like Kendall\\u2019s 40th birthday party in this week\\u2019s episode of \\u201cSuccession\\u201d \\u2014 some preposterously lavish and borderline cultish shindig, celebrating a business culture about to collapse under its founding genius.\", \"In the case of the event Shiv calls \\u201cKenFest,\\u201d the party is like an endless version of that scene in \\u201cCitizen Kane\\u201d in which the brash young media magnate Charles Foster Kane dances and sings along to a jaunty pop song about himself. Moments like these are equal parts awkward and reckless. They\\u2019re a grand illustration of the whole concept of \\u201chubris.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cToo Much Birthday\\u201d is an often very funny episode, which curdles into devastating drama by the end. But most of all, it is a triumph of production design. Nearly every set reflects some aspect of Kendall Roy \\u2014 whether he intends it to or not. A lot of the d\\u00e9cor is meant to straddle the line between amusingly ironic and cockily sincere. If a guest considers some piece of design to be over the top, Kendall can always say, \\u201cBut it\\u2019s funny, right?\\u201d\", \"Here are just a few of the attractions awaiting those guests:\", \"And then there is the treehouse.\", \"This episode is credited to the screenwriters Tony Roche and Georgia Pritchett, with Lorene Scafaria in the director\\u2019s chair. I don\\u2019t know if credit for the treehouse goes to one of these people or to the series\\u2019s creator, Jesse Armstrong, or to someone else; but it is a conceptual masterstroke. This week, all the Roy kids reunite to fight about whom their dad wants to be in charge. And here is Kendall, standing in front of a literal treehouse, built in the middle of his party, telling his siblings they can\\u2019t come in.\", \"Kendall\\u2019s pettiness is, to some extent, justified. When Roman, Shiv and Connor first show up at Kendall\\u2019s party, he seems genuinely happy, giving them hugs that appear to be heartfelt. But then he learns the real reason Shiv and Roman are there.\", \"Waystar needs to upgrade its streaming platform by partnering with the tech company GoJo, run by the mercurial Lukas Matsson (Alexander Skarsgard), who earlier that day skipped a meeting with Logan and sent his underlings. Kendall has Matsson \\u2014 whom he calls \\u201cthe Odin of codin\\u2019\\u201d \\u2014 stashed away in his treehouse, where any illicit thing he needs is supplied by Kendall\\u2019s own \\u201cone-man dark web.\\u201d (\\u201cHe\\u2019s not a good guy,\\u201d Kendall says to Matsson about his drug dealer. \\u201cEnjoy.\\u201d)\", \"When Roman and Shiv try to enter, Kendall personally blocks them, saying, \\u201cThe treehouse is cool and you\\u2019re not cool.\\u201d He calls his siblings Nazi-lovers while he is \\u201ca defender of liberal democracy.\\u201d As his brother and sister argue that landing GoJo could raise the family\\u2019s net worth, Kendall replies, \\u201cI have to weigh that against the consideration that no losers are allowed.\\u201d\", \"Ultimately, Roman weasels his way into the treehouse anyway, where he appears to connect with Matsson. Roman pitches Waystar\\u2019s library of broadly popular entertainment and news content (not the \\u201cgay moms\\u201d or \\u201cwheelchair kids\\u201d the other media companies are selling); and he talks up GoJo\\u2019s platform, which unlike Waystar\\u2019s doesn\\u2019t take over 30 seconds to load a page. Matsson seems amenable to some kind of deal, so long as he never has to interact with the meddling, out-of-touch dinosaur Logan. (\\u201cWhen will your father die?\\u201d he asks earnestly, to which Roman chuckles and then mutters, \\u201cWe\\u2019re laughing here, but that is my dad, so \\u2026\\u201d)\", \"This is the second \\u201cSuccession\\u201d in a row where Roman notches a big win; and he is not gracious about it. He skewers Shiv, who has been excluded from the offer to buy Kendall\\u2019s shares, shielded from the decision to send private investigators to harass Kendall\\u2019s children and is absent when Roman gets a tentative yes from GoJo. Roman also insinuates that Shiv might be annoyed by rumors that the Justice Department is ending its investigation into Brightstar without sending Tom or anyone else to prison. If true, that would squelch her secret hope that the wicked Waystar dudes might be shoved out of her way by the long arm of the law.\", \"Shiv can take comfort, though, in knowing that on this show, no Roy thrives for long. Roman is likely overestimating how much power he has to make deals on his father\\u2019s behalf; and it is possible that deep in his bones he senses something is off. That may explain why he later tries to goad Kendall into hitting him and then gives his brother a shove in the back that sends him sprawling. Maybe Roman is trying to hasten his own inevitable comeuppance.\", \"It\\u2019s too bad for Roman, then, that Kendall is already too beaten down to stand up for himself. From the moment he gets Logan\\u2019s term sheet, Kendall starts to spiral \\u2014 first slowly, and then in a hurry. He abandons his plan to sing Billy Joel\\u2019s \\u201cHonesty\\u201d in front of his guests while hanging from a cross. He falls into a maudlin mood, making what may be references to tragic F. Scott Fitzgerald characters (and, yes, \\u201cCitizen Kane\\u201d) by promising to buy his girlfriend, Naomi Pierce, \\u201ca diamond the size of the Ritz-Carlton and a couple of newspapers.\\u201d\", \"The real triggering moment for Kendall, though, is when his ex-wife tells him to keep an eye out for a present from his kids, wrapped in rabbit-patterned paper. The missing gift eats at Kendall \\u2014 almost as much as it bothers him that his brother Connor refuses to pay him the simple respect of taking off his coat at the party. Finally, he starts tearing through his pile of presents until he breaks down sobbing. Here is a man who seemingly has everything, except for some cheap handmade trinket that represents his children\\u2019s love.\", \"Surely somewhere off in the distance, an old man is whispering, \\u201cRosebud.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"efa533ee50c311ec84ebc9444c172d57"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"efa533ee50c311ec84ebc9444c172d57"}},
