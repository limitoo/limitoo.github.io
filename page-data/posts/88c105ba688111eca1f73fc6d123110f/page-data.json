But this year, since Britain left the European Union, Netherton Foundry\\u2019s sales into the bloc have plummeted.\", \"For 12 months, British businesses have been confronting the reality of the country\\u2019s decision to distance itself from its largest trading partner. Initially, the new system collapsed: Perishable goods got stuck at ports, retailers discovered their supply chains were obsolete and trucking companies stopped delivering to the whole island of Ireland.\", \"The worst of the problems (outside of Northern Ireland) eased after a few months. But what remains is a frustrating regime of higher costs, time-consuming customs paperwork and countless lost opportunities.\", \"Netherton Foundry\\u2019s website sales to the European Union are \\u201cjust draining away,\\u201d Mr. Currie said. They have dropped 40 percent this year.\", \"Before Brexit, the only discernible difference about sales to the continent were the extra delivery costs. Arranging the shipment took less than a minute. Now, for every different product leaving Britain \\u2014 whether it\\u2019s a specially designed tortilla press or a popular frying pan with locally sourced oak handles \\u2014 a four-page customs form needs to be completed, which takes up to 20 minutes per shipment.\", \"For customers, there\\u2019s sticker shock. Items cost at least 8.50 pounds ($11.25) more because couriers charge extra to cover the additional administration of customs checks and taxes. And every product takes longer to arrive at its destination. Besides the lost online sales from individual buyers, many European independent shops that used to stock Netherton Foundry\\u2019s products have concluded it\\u2019s just not worth the cost or the hassle.\", \"\\u201cWe can sell to people, we can do it, but it\\u2019s more expensive,\\u201d Mr. Currie said. \\u201cBut there is a perception \\u2014 and I think this is possibly even worse \\u2014 that it\\u2019s too difficult.\\u201d\", \"In its first seven months, the new trade deal reduced Britain\\u2019s exports to the union by 14 percent and imports by 24 percent, according to an estimate by the UK Trade Policy Observatory, a research group. That\\u2019s about \\u00a344 billion in lost trade. Most of the exports were lost in January as many logistics companies stopped moving goods, overwhelmed by the number of deliveries that were being sent with inaccurate customs paperwork. Since that initial drop, exports have mostly recovered, official statistics show.\", \"But the data doesn\\u2019t capture how much harder businesses are having to work just to retain the customers they have as they become less competitive.\", \"One of Netherton Foundry\\u2019s largest customers, a department store in Germany, has required that the pans be sold to it via an intermediary in Belgium so it doesn\\u2019t have to take on the extra work of importing directly from Britain. \\u201cWith, of course, all the additional costs,\\u201d Mr. Currie said. \\u201cWe all know it\\u2019s crazy.\\u201d\", \"The trade deal granted goods made in Britain tariff- and quota-free access to the European Union. But the paperwork required to cross the border and prove the goods met the bloc\\u2019s regulatory standards have become a nuisance. Some companies decided it was not worth the extra costs. Marks & Spencer, a large British retailer, closed its 11 food stores in France, citing \\u201csupply chain complexities\\u201d created by Brexit.\", \"Goods trade with Europe was nearly 16 percent below what it would have been in a world without Brexit, according to the latest report by the Center for European Reform, a group that supports the European Union.\", \"These are only the beginnings of the long-run impacts of Brexit, which is expected to make the British economy 4 percent smaller than it otherwise would have been, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility. That\\u2019s twice as much scarring to the economy than the pandemic is expected to cause, it estimated.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve had a year of two halves,\\u201d said Sally Jones, who leads the trade strategy and Brexit team at EY. Early on, companies were asking granular operational questions about how to keep their businesses running under the new rules. Now, they are working out the long-term issues that require substantial changes. For example, some retailers that relied on a single European distribution center in Britain are finding they can\\u2019t afford to keep paying the additional tariffs imposed by moving imported goods back out of Britain. They are looking into opening other centers on the continent, relocating jobs and money.\", \"It\\u2019s something that Luceco, which makes and imports lighting and wiring products from China and sells them to retail stores, is having to consider. It mostly sells the imported products within Britain, but about \\u00a33 million to \\u00a34 million of the sales are made in the Republic of Ireland.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not, thankfully, the biggest chunk,\\u201d said Matt Webb, the chief financial officer. But \\u201cit\\u2019s been extremely difficult. The paperwork now that\\u2019s involved in selling to even Northern Ireland is prohibitive,\\u201d he said. In addition, tariffs on the items have to be paid twice: when they enter Britain from China and leave for Ireland.\", \"\\u201cThere was always going to come a time when it made sense for us to have a hub in Ireland,\\u201d Mr. Webb said. \\u201cAll that Brexit has done is brought that day a little closer.\\u201d\", \"The added costs and challenges of Brexit have arrived while businesses are already desperately trying to navigate the constant tumult of the pandemic, which has led to international shortages of goods, exorbitant shipping costs and surging commodity prices, particularly for energy.\", \"At Netherton Foundry, the first thing that lands in Mr. Currie\\u2019s inbox each morning is an email from his purchasing manager of the top five expenses that have increased in price overnight. Luceco sees increases, too: It used to spend \\u00a32 million a year on sea containers shipping its goods from China. Now it\\u2019s \\u00a316 million. For customers, Luceco\\u2019s prices have jumped 12 percent.\", \"Recently, butter and cheese prices have risen 20 percent to 30 percent, said Michael Harte, the managing director of Bridge Cheese, which imports some of its cheeses from Europe and sells bespoke blends to food manufacturers and wholesalers, such as pizza companies, in Britain, on the continent and in the Middle East. And there are soaring energy prices to contend with. Bridge Cheese absorbed these extra costs as long as it could, but since September has passed on double-digit price increases to its customers.\", \"\\u201cAs opposed to singular issues, everything is layered on top of each other,\\u201d Mr. Harte said.\", \"In an effort to keep Brexit-related costs under control, Bridge Cheese is willing to export only large orders because goods going to the European Union now all have to undergo veterinarian inspections to certify they met health regulations and to check labeling and storage. It costs the same to have 20 pallets inspected as it does just one, Mr. Harte said.\", \"One of his frustrations is that Brexit means there is a \\u201cmassive market on your doorstep\\u201d that can\\u2019t be reached competitively for specialty products, he said. In the nine months through September, exports of food and drink to the European Union dropped 14 percent from the year before, according to an industry group. Cheese exports were down 13 percent, it said.\", \"And there are more Brexit impacts to come. Starting Jan. 1, Britain will impose customs checks on goods being imported from the bloc. Also in the new year, companies will have to prove their products are sufficiently British-made to qualify for tariff-free trade. From the middle of next year, additional export border checks, including physical inspections of plant and animal products, will begin.\", \"While the British government insisted on the success of its European trade deal, it was keen to shift companies\\u2019 focus to the promises of trading with countries farther afield. The real opportunities lie in the Indo-Pacific, officials have said.\", \"Companies have sought out more distant customers, but out of necessity, not choice. Since the start of the year, Netherton Foundry\\u2019s sales to the United States have increased, but they haven\\u2019t made up for the sales lost in Europe.\", \"Some specialized retailers in Europe have remained customers, but the everyday cook shops haven\\u2019t, Mr. Currie said. A dedicated cohort of individual customers remain, too. Many of them are \\u201creal Anglophiles,\\u201d he added.\", \"\\u201cBut we must be losing lots of people who are mildly indifferent to us,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s those lost opportunities that we have at the moment, and those are hard to measure.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"88c105ba688111eca1f73fc6d123110f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"88c105ba688111eca1f73fc6d123110f"}},
