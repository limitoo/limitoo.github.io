The World Health Organization on Friday labeled Omicron a \\u201cvariant of concern,\\u201d the first coronavirus variant to warrant that designation since Delta.\", \"For me, the developments felt a little too similar to the fast-mounting pandemic anxiety of Thanksgiving 2020. Turkey, pumpkin pie and, of course, a side of scary coronavirus news.\", \"Still, there\\u2019s a lot we don\\u2019t know about Omicron, which makes it difficult to discern exactly how alarmed we should be by its imminent arrival in the U.S. There\\u2019s some evidence that Omicron is particularly easy to transmit, but also that it causes only mild illness.\", \"We\\u2019re likely to learn plenty in the coming days \\u2014 how contagious this new variant is, how sick it makes people, where it has already spread and how well vaccines limit infections.\", \"As my colleague Apoorva Mandavilli reports, scientists are racing to answer that last, and perhaps most important, question.\", \"Here\\u2019s why experts are concerned: Omicron has more than 30 mutations in its spike protein, the part of the virus that vaccines train the body to recognize and fight against. In other words, Omicron\\u2019s highly mutated spike might be able to evade antibodies produced by a previous infection or a vaccine.\", \"While some experts believe the existing vaccines will continue to ward off severe illness and death, even if more people become infected, the vaccine manufacturers Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna are already preparing to reformulate their shots to target Omicron. It will be at least a few weeks before we have a clearer picture, Apoorva writes.\", \"If this sea of unknowns is making you feel anxious, it might be helpful to remember that we understand much more about the coronavirus than we once did. And the recommendations for staying safe from Omicron are similar to what officials have been saying for weeks as they try stave off a winter surge of infections.\", \"California officials on Sunday reiterated the need for everyone who is eligible to be vaccinated and for high-risk people to seek boosters. They also recommended wearing masks in indoor public places and being tested if you have any symptoms of Covid-19.\", \"Because of the news about Omicron, California is increasing Covid testing at airports for American citizens and permanent residents arriving from eight African nations. All other travelers from those countries are barred from entering the U.S. starting today.\", \"The state will also continue to test coronavirus samples to track whether Omicron is circulating here. So far, 99.7 percent of specimens sequenced in California this month were found to be the Delta variant.\", \"\\u201cCalifornia is closely monitoring the new Omicron variant, which has not yet arrived in California or the U.S.,\\u201d Dr. Tom\\u00e1s J. Arag\\u00f3n, the state\\u2019s public health director, said in a statement on Sunday. \\u201cVaccines continue to be our best way through the pandemic.\\u201d\", \"For more:\", \"The U.S. has a dismal history of pulling off major infrastructure projects.\", \"This couple followed their hearts to Los Angeles.
