The new variant is changing some minds.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-01T23:35:46.000Z","content":"[\"As recently as last week, many public health experts were fiercely opposed to the Biden administration\\u2019s campaign to roll out booster shots of the coronavirus vaccines to all American adults. There was little scientific evidence to support extra doses for most people, the researchers said.\", \"The Omicron variant has changed all that.\", \"Scientists do not yet know with any certainty whether the virus is easier to spread or less vulnerable to the body\\u2019s immune response. But with dozens of new mutations, the variant seems likely to evade the protection from vaccines to some significant degree. \", \"Booster shots clearly raise antibody levels, strengthening the body\\u2019s defenses against infection, and may help offset whatever advantages Omicron has gained through evolution.\", \"Many of the experts who were opposed to boosters now believe that the shots may offer the best defense against the new variant. The extra doses may slow the spread, at least, buying time for vaccine makers to develop an Omicron-specific formulation, if needed.\", \"\\u201cBased on what we know about the potential for immune evasion, I would err on the side of giving the booster,\\u201d said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center who had opposed the Biden administration\\u2019s boosters-for-all push.\", \"The administration isn\\u2019t waiting for scientific consensus. Alarmed by the preliminary reports about Omicron, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Monday that all American adults should receive booster shots.\", \"The first confirmed Omicron infection in the United States was reported on Wednesday in San Francisco, in a traveler who returned to California from South Africa on Nov. 22. The individual had been fully vaccinated \\u2014 but had not received a booster \\u2014 and showed mild symptoms that were said to be improving.\", \"The Omicron variant, first identified in southern Africa, has been discovered in at least 20 countries, and the World Health Organization has warned that the risk posed by the virus is \\u201cvery high.\\u201d After news of the variant\\u2019s spread in South Africa, countries around the world have curtailed air travel to and from southern Africa.\", \"Omicron carries more than 50 genetic mutations, more than 30 of them on the virus\\u2019s spike, a protein on its surface. Vaccines train the body\\u2019s immune defenses to target and attack these spikes.\", \"Until now, experts like Dr. Gounder had argued that while the vaccines\\u2019 potency against infection with the Delta variant seemed to be waning, they still shielded most people from severe illness, hospitalization and death. Booster doses should be recommended only for adults older than 65 and those who are in long-term care facilities or have weak immune systems, they said.\", \"If Delta were the only threat, boosters would still not be warranted, Dr. Gounder and other researchers said. But Omicron may be a more formidable foe.\", \"\\u201cIf it is highly resistant to antibodies, which seems likely but unproven, then additional doses are appropriate,\\u201d said John Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine in New York.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019d like to see more data, but it won\\u2019t do anybody any harm to have additional protection.\\u201d\", \"Even before Omicron\\u2019s arrival, some experts were coming around to boosters for all adults, as cases in the United States inched upward again in recent weeks.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s impacting things like elective procedures at multiple hospitals in Massachusetts and elsewhere,\\u201d said Dr. Camille Kotton, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital and an adviser to the C.D.C. \\u201cWe really need to put an end to this.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cNow, more than ever, is a great time to get vaccinated for people who are not yet vaccinated, or to go get boosters,\\u201d she said.\", \"Dr. Kotton\\u2019s initial hesitation was partly rooted in a dearth of research regarding the safety of booster shots in young adults. Given certain rare heart problems in young men after receiving the second dose of an mRNA vaccine, it was not clear that the benefits outweighed the risks.\", \"But the data now available has eased her concerns, she said \\u2014 so much so that she has urged her college-age sons to receive booster doses.\", \"\\u201cOh yeah, I changed,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThinking about risks and benefits, it is a really good idea to get booster doses for people who qualify.\\u201d\", \"Greater support for boosters among scientists may eventually complicate efforts to deliver limited supplies of the coronavirus vaccines to poor countries. The World Health Organization has said for months, long before Omicron\\u2019s appearance, that the clamor for extra doses in rich countries was robbing poorer nations of the first doses they desperately need.\", \"Despite the W.H.O.\\u2019s designation of Omicron as a high risk, the organization has not changed its position on boosters.\", \"\\u201cRight now, there is no evidence that I\\u2019m aware of that would suggest that boosting the entire population is going to necessarily provide any greater protection to otherwise healthy individuals against hospitalization or death,\\u201d Dr. Mike Ryan, a director at the W.H.O., said at a news conference on Wednesday.\", \"He and other scientists have said that the unchecked spread of the coronavirus through largely unvaccinated populations, like those in Africa, is likely to give rise to variants like Omicron.\", \"Not all experts are lining up in support of booster shots.\", \"The push for extra doses is predicated on the idea that antibodies are the central aspect of immunity, a false perspective that overlooks the importance of other parts of the immune system in preventing severe illness and death, said Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center at Children\\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and an adviser to the Food and Drug Administration.\", \"He said he would be more worried if vaccinated people infected with the Omicron variant were hospitalized in droves. But limited evidence to date suggests that the vaccines still prevent severe illness, he said.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s always been true \\u2014 it\\u2019s been true for the first three variants, and it\\u2019s likely to be true here,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re setting the goal as protection against mild illness, then we\\u2019re going to be boosting until the day we die.\\u201d\", \"Even if Omicron turns out to be resistant to vaccines, an extra shot of the original vaccines may not be the best solution, Dr. Offit said: \\u201cI just think that\\u2019s a detour from what is really going to be the way to get on top of this pandemic, which is to vaccinate the unvaccinated.\\u201d\", \"But waiting may not be an option.\", \"If laboratory tests indicate that Omicron sidesteps the vaccines, manufacturers say that they are poised to tailor new versions. That process will take at least a few months, and booster shots of current vaccines may be needed to help keep the variant in check until then.\", \"Even if the antibodies stimulated by those shots are not quite as effective at fending off Omicron as they were against prior variants, the rise in quantity alone could compensate, Dr. Gounder said.\", \"\\u201cYou\\u2019re able to override some of that lower affinity by having the higher numbers,\\u201d she said.\", \"If necessary, multiple booster doses \\u2014 first with the current vaccines, then with Omicron-specific versions \\u2014 would need to be exquisitely timed, so that certain immune cells don\\u2019t stop responding to vaccination, Dr. Moore said.\", \"\\u201cThis is where it all gets complicated \\u2014 certainly, nobody should be sitting on dogma here,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re reacting in a low-information environment where the consequences are potentially quite serious.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"433fdbac52ff11ec8d4b7700a7ac8474"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"433fdbac52ff11ec8d4b7700a7ac8474"}},
