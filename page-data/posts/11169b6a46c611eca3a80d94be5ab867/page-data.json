According to a homeland security executive who was in the room, who requested anonymity because he is discussing classified matters, the discussion was intense and technical, the two men drilling into the details.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1655554/donald-trump-bill-barr-joe-biden.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Attorney General William Barr listens as President Donald Trump speaks in the Oval Office in Washington, D.C. </div>\", \"Was there any way that the Dominion Voting Systems machine could change votes? The answer was no. Was there any veracity to the claim that the microchips in the machines, made in China, could be programmed a certain way or manipulated in the machines? The answer was no. Was there any way that other systems used to count votes could or were penetrated? The answer was no. Was there any way mail-in ballots were thrown away, fraudulently submitted, falsely counted? The answer was no: nothing even close to what the Trump camp was claiming.\", \"There was discussion of the intelligence on Russian and Iranian attempts to interfere in the elections through social media as well as attempts traced back to them to penetrate state-level databases. But after 2016, holes had been plugged up and the two agencies\\u2014along with the CIA, the NSA and U.S. Cyber Command \\u2014were this time focused on thwarting any interference. Was there any way that the integrity of the elections were questionable? The answer was no. What about fraud on the part of vote counters and local officials? No sign, said the FBI.\", \"The conclusion was definitive. All of the claims were false and concocted. There was no way votes had been stolen from anyone. Maybe there were mistakes in tabulating at the county or state-level. Yes, mail-in ballots were processed after November 3.
