The agency, which is based in Paris, said that the oil market remained \\u201ctight by all measures, but that a reprieve from the price rally could be on the horizon.\\u201d\", \"The forecast, contained in the agency\\u2019s Monthly Oil Report, could lend support to the arguments of the producers\\u2019 group, known as OPEC Plus, which in recent meetings has shrugged off requests from the Biden administration to accelerate production increases.\", \"The United States is contributing the largest increases of any country, the report said. Oil output in the Gulf of Mexico has recovered more rapidly than expected from the ravages of Hurricane Ida in August and the pace of shale drilling is picking up, encouraged by high prices.\", \"The I.E.A. reported that global production increased by a hefty 1.4 million barrels per day in October, or more than 1 percent of supplies, and that it expected another 1.5 million barrels a day to come on the market over November and December.\", \"The report said that growth in demand was strengthening as countries including the United States opened their borders for international travel, spurring consumption of jet fuel that has so far lagged other petroleum products.\", \"OPEC Plus, which is led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, agreed in July to raise output by a modest 400,000 barrels per day each month. OPEC Plus has expressed concern that bigger increases could result in supplies outstripping demand next year, potentially causing prices to plummet.\", \"The group also has argued that although oil prices may have risen sharply this year \\u2014 presently about $82 a barrel for Brent crude, the international benchmark, and $81 per barrel for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. standard \\u2014 the increases have been modest compared to the rocketing prices of other energy including natural gas and electric power.\"]","href_hash":"2a255b2846da11ecbc562189a82ed26e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2a255b2846da11ecbc562189a82ed26e"}},
