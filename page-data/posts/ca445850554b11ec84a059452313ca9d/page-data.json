It also follows the killing of an Israeli tour guide by a Palestinian gunman last month, and a spike in violence by Israeli settlers against Palestinians in the West Bank.\", \"The nature of the assailant\\u2019s death on Saturday led to accusations that the Israeli police had killed him after he was felled and incapacitated.\", \"In one video from the scene, which does not include footage of the initial attack, the stabber is seen being shot three times after dropping to the ground. The recording also appeared to show a third police officer signaling to colleagues to stop firing. The two officers, from the Israel Border Guard, were placed under investigation, the state broadcaster reported.\", \"The incident led to fears of renewed unrest in East Jerusalem, the center of one of the most intractable issues in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The Old City, which lies just inside East Jerusalem, houses the most sacred site in Judaism, the Temple Mount, and the Aqsa Mosque, one of the most hallowed places in Islam.\", \"Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in 1967 and later annexed it. But Palestinians consider it occupied territory and hope it will one day form the capital of a Palestinian state.\", \"Disputes over Palestinian land rights in East Jerusalem, coupled with several Israeli raids on the Aqsa Mosque compound led Hamas, the militant Islamist group in Gaza, to fire rockets toward the city in May, setting off an 11-day war with Israel. Following Saturday\\u2019s incident, a Hamas leader condemned the nature of the attacker\\u2019s killing, Palestinian media reported.\", \"In silent footage of the incident released by the Israeli government, the attacker walked calmly across a pedestrian crossing leading to a plaza beside the Damascus Gate, a major entry point into the Old City, and a focus of Palestinian communal life in Jerusalem. Reaching a traffic island, he suddenly turned and repeatedly stabbed an ultra-Orthodox Jewish man behind him. The victim was identified in the Israeli news media as Avraham Elmaliah, a 20-year-old who had been praying at the Western Wall, one of the last remaining parts of an ancient Jewish temple compound.\", \"The attacker was identified by the Israeli state broadcaster as Muhammad Salima, a Palestinian from the occupied West Bank who had served a jail term for incitement.\", \"The footage showed Mr. Salima then attempting to stab an approaching policeman, before running toward a second nearby officer. At least one of the officers then shot him and he was seen falling to the ground. A second video, filmed from a passing car, showed that the attacker had subsequently been shot at least three times after falling.\", \"Interviewed in the hospital by the Israeli news media, Mr. Elmaliah thanked the police for having intervened. \\u201cThey saved me,\\u201d he was reported to have said by Yediot Ahronoth, an Israeli newspaper. \\u201cWithout them, I would not be here today.\\u201d\", \"The Israeli prime minister, Naftali Bennett, also defended the police officers.\", \"\\u201cThe two combatants took very swift and determined action, as expected of Israel\\u2019s police, when confronted with a terrorist who tried to murder an Israeli civilian,\\u201d Mr. Bennett said on social media. \\u201cI should like to express my full support for them. This is how we expect our combatants to act, and this is how they acted. We must not allow our capital to become a focus of terrorism.\\u201d\", \"But Ahmed Tibi, a lawmaker in the Israeli Parliament, and an Arab citizen of Israel, called the episode \\u201ca coldblooded execution\\u201d of an injured man \\u201cwho presented no danger to anyone.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Tibi added: \\u201cThis is a criminal act that requires investigation.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ca445850554b11ec84a059452313ca9d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ca445850554b11ec84a059452313ca9d"}},
