One child needed leg surgery, according to relatives, and another had brain trauma injuries. Another child, witnesses said, was found curled up on the street, unconscious.\", \"Jessalyn\\u2019s pelvis was broken, her skull fractured and her liver and kidneys lacerated, family members said. Just before she was intubated at the hospital, she asked her family to \\u201ctell them to glue my back and everything back together,\\u201d her uncle, Ryan Kohnke, said.\", \"On Tuesday evening, the family of Jackson Sparks, 8, said that the brain surgery he had undergone on Sunday after the parade had failed to save him: He was the sixth person \\u2014 and the only child \\u2014 to die in the tragedy. \\u201cThis afternoon, our dear Jackson has sadly succumbed to his injuries and passed away,\\u201d Alyssa Albro, the child\\u2019s cousin, shared on the family\\u2019s GoFundMe page.\", \"The grief in Waukesha had been concentrated on the loss of adults \\u2014 five of them were killed on Sunday, including four members of an amateur dance group that celebrated grandmothers. But the close-knit Milwaukee suburb also is reeling from the toll on children, scores of whom were hospitalized in the aftermath.
