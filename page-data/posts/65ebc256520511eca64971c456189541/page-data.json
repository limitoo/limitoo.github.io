Most of the people in the group are reported to be fleeing \\\"violence, poverty and growing hunger crises\\\" in their home nations.

The leaders of these caravans said they intended to reach the U.S.-Mexico border.\", \"These groups left Tapachula after they spent time waiting in the city to receive permits to move through Mexico and eventually became fed up with the slow speed of processing. Caravan organizer Irineo Mujica, who led the October group, called the city an \\\"open-air prison,\\\" and said waiting for the immigration processing system to play out left too many unknowns.\", \"While he expressed discontentment over the Mexican government's perceived lack of progress in processing paperwork, Mujica also criticized the U.S. at the time for its handling of immigration.\", \"\\\"They're just in denial of their own fault. They haven't been able to handle immigration,\\\" he told reporters in October. \\\"If I tell you the truth, I believe at least with Donald Trump we knew what we had. With Biden, we don't know. He doesn't seem to have a clue what to do with immigration because he says one thing and does another.\\\"\", \"Since President Joe Biden took office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection has reported more than 1.6 million encounters at the southern border.
