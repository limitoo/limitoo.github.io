Like I don't need to write stuff down in games and that. I know exactly what I need because I've seen it,\\\" Wright said.\", \"\\\"It probably just means I'm a bit odd and I've embraced that and the players know I'm a bit different, and they accept me as I am, which is really cool.\", \"\\\"And it's something that I've always tried to embrace ... I don't try and change anyone I coach because sometimes the very best people, they're a little different and when you allow people to be themselves, you get the very best of them.\\\"\", \"He's particular when it comes to colours he doesn't like.\", \"\\\"I don't like white and I don't like pink and I don't like purple, they're the only three colours that I don't like.\", \"\\\"White's a bit plain for me so I'm always at the players about their white sneakers.

I ended up with head injuries ... it took time to get back to where I was but I wasn't killed so I think there's a positive.\", \"\\\"I've actually had a couple of accidents ... I've been run over twice. But I always believe everything happens for a reason and I obviously wasn't able to play during that time, so that's when I started taking up coaching, it allowed me to get into coaching, so yeah lucky me I think.\\\"\", \"In 2014 Wright created history becoming the first male head coach in the old trans-Tasman netball league when he took over at the New South Wales Swifts.\", \"It was the culmination of years of working his way through the coaching ranks from school teams to club, to age group reps, to the elite levels.\", \"Wright is regarded as one of the game's most technical minds and a tough coach who pushes players to achieve their full potential.\", \"His motto is simple - make players better, faster.\", \"Former Australian Diamond captain Sharni Norder (nee Layton) in her book 'No apologies' wrote about a phone call with Wright that convinced her to move to the Swifts for the 2014 season.\", \"\\\"'Sharni Layton, you are good,' he said, 'but you are not great. Your footwork needs a lot of work.

The game? I had to use quick footwork to get the ball without letting him whack me with this giant crash pad. It was hilarious.\\\"\", \"Wright said he likes to find drills that have real purpose.\", \"\\\"I still use that kind of stuff because I think it really mimics what happens in a game and really challenges people to find a way to do things ...I just come up with ways of trying to make people better, and hopefully that works most of the time,\\\" Wright said.\", \"\\\"I love that stuff because defensively I think the game is really designed for attack. And so it's hard on defenders and often it's that you've just got to keep going and finding ways and you've got to grind your opposition down at times.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/124185/eight_col_210419MysticsvMagic_023.JPG?1623297803\\\" alt=\\\"Grace Nweke (left) and Elisapeta Toeava\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nGrace Nweke (left) and Elisapeta Toeava \\nPhoto: Photosport\\n</div>\", \"At the Mystics, Wright now focusses on the attacking end, working with talented shooters Grace Nweke, Monica Falkner, Filda Vui, and feeder Peta Toeava.\", \"Wright got to know former Silver Ferns' defender Michaela Sokolich-Beatson last year when she was battling her way back from a second achilles injury and is thrilled she's back on court.\", \"\\\"Michaela is the ultimate competitor, incredibly driven, and I think that shows in the work she did to get back from those two achilles ruptures.
