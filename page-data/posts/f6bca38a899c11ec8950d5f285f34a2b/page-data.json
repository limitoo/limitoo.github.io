Andrews was a popular one, and I remember it getting passed around one summer at sleep away camp when I was 11. It scared the daylights out of me.\", \"I was a voracious reader, and some of what I read in my tweens and teens was prurient and had close to zero literary value. (For instance, \\u201cGo Ask Alice,\\u201d a cautionary tale of drug use masquerading as a teen\\u2019s diary, which I thought was a true story until I was 30.) Other books provided tools for identity formation, in ways that in retrospect are hilarious and myopic. Like many dramatic, bookish teenagers, I loved \\u201cThe Bell Jar,\\u201d which I\\u2019m pretty sure was on my sophomore English summer reading list.\", \"After that, I read biographies of Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes on my own, because I love mess and gossip. In college, I told at least one suitor that I wanted a passionate romance like theirs: The first time they met, at a party, Hughes ripped off Plath\\u2019s headband and earring, and Plath bit Hughes on the face. In true adolescent fashion, I glossed over the depressing ending of their story. I doubt that was the takeaway my teachers intended when \\u201cThe Bell Jar\\u201d was assigned.\", \"I mention all this because of the recent ongoing public debate, mostly among adults, about which books are \\u201cappropriate\\u201d for teenagers to read in schools. Book bans, even book burnings, are on the rise, and the latest round of discussion took off with the McMinn County, Tenn., school board\\u2019s decision to remove \\u201cMaus,\\u201d a graphic novel about the Holocaust, from their district\\u2019s eighth grade curriculum.\", \"For the record, I think bans are terrible for many reasons, including because they\\u2019re frequently about political fights among adults that spill into children\\u2019s lives when it\\u2019s not really about them. As my Times colleague Margaret Renkl wrote Monday in an Opinion essay, \\u201cthe vast majority of teenagers in McMinn County already carry the modern world around in their pockets \\u2014 the cussing and the sex and the violence and all of it.\\u201d Many recent bans are part of the general, misguided push against so-called critical race theory. Other bans are against books depicting any kind of non-heterosexual sex or romance. The American Library Association has a list of the top 10 most challenged books from 2001-2020 on its website, and sexual and racial content are popular recent reasons for banning.\", \"More alarming are the threats to criminalize distribution of what politicians deem \\u201cpornographic\\u201d books. One Texas high school librarian told NBC News she was retiring earlier than planned because of these threats. \\u201cI got out because I was afraid to stand up to the attacks. I didn\\u2019t want to get caught in somebody\\u2019s snare. Who wants to be called a pornographer? Who wants to be accused of being a pedophile or reported to the police for putting a book in a kid\\u2019s hand?\\u201d\", \"While it is distressing, none of this is new. An article published more than 40 years ago in Time magazine called \\u201cThe Growing Battle of the Books\\u201d discusses a strikingly similar dynamic to the one we\\u2019re witnessing today, with books that have sexual, racial and religious content among the most banned.\", \"The entire article is worth a read, but this paragraph stuck out to me as particularly relevant to our current struggle:\", \"It\\u2019s not surprising to me that after two years of pandemic uncertainty and chaos, we\\u2019re in a moment where some parents want to exert control over something, anything for their kids, and I do have some empathy for that feeling, if not for the expression of it. Particularly because the early quarantines, when virtual schooling was happening everywhere, brought curriculum and teachers into our homes in much more intimate ways. In that moment, teenagers were at home instead of starting to grow away from their families, which is what they\\u2019re supposed to do. While parents always have some sway over their kids, this period of enforced togetherness possibly gave some parents the illusion that they still had full authority over their adolescents\\u2019 intellectual lives.\", \"My mother, who practiced psychiatry for 40 years, used to tell me that you have until your kid is 12 to, if you will, brainwash them with your set of moral values. After that, their peers become as, if not more, influential than their parents. In the \\u201990s, Judith Rich Harris, an independent researcher, promoted the theory that parental influence matters less than we think in terms of child development.\", \"Harris, who died in 2019, once wrote, \\u201cIf teenagers wanted to be like adults they wouldn\\u2019t be shoplifting nail polish from drugstores or hanging off overpasses to spray I LOVE YOU LI\\u01a8A on the arch,\\u201d and that \\u201cIf they really aspired to \\u2018mature status\\u2019 they would be doing boring adult things like sorting the laundry and figuring out their income taxes. Teenagers aren\\u2019t trying to be like adults: they are trying to distinguish themselves from adults!\\u201d\", \"And thank goodness they are. In December, NPR ran a segment on book bans, and noted that in North Kansas City, Mo., a parent-led group got \\u201cAll Boys Aren\\u2019t Blue\\u201d by George M. Johnson and \\u201cFun Home\\u201d by Alison Bechdel, which are both memoirs by gay writers, removed from school libraries. \\u201cThe district ended up putting those books back on shelves after students protested. Sixteen-year-old Aurora Nicol spoke at a school board meeting after the books were returned,\\u201d Nomin Ujiyediin reported.\", \"Despite parental outbursts, teens are going to continue to find ways to assert themselves publicly and privately, and to get their mitts on whatever their parents don\\u2019t want them to read, see or discuss.\", \"I'm so glad I read so many different kinds of books as a teenager, even the supposedly bad ones. Because it was fun, because I bonded with my friends over those books, because they gave me goofy ideas I could explore in my head without acting them out in real life; and some ideas that I had to act out in real life to experience the consequences of my choices. My older daughter is currently reading a book about sinister dolls who are constantly plotting against each other and attempting to avoid something called \\u201cpermanent doll state.\\u201d I have no idea if she\\u2019s learning a damn thing from it, but she sure is enjoying herself.\", \"If you want a chance to get your Tiny Victory published, find us on Instagram @NYTparenting and use the hashtag #tinyvictories; email us; or enter your Tiny Victory at the bottom of this page.
