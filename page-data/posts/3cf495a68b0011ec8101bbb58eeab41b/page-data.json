They are particularly keen on this year\\u2019s race, which is being contested at 3 a.m. Eastern time on Friday, because of a rivalry with Nils van der Poel of Sweden. You can bet that from Rotterdam to Amsterdam, fans will be riveted by the men skating in circles with their hands behind their backs.\", \"Van der Poel, who won the 5,000-meter race on Saturday in Olympic record time, has won every distance race he has entered this year.\", \"The 10K is the longest race on the program and is restricted to men. (The women max out at 5,000 meters.) Two skaters hit the ice at the same time, but they are really racing against the clock and not each other. Six miles and 13 minutes or so later, they finish up, and two more skaters go. Repeat.\", \"The skater who finishes the fastest wins the gold medal.\", \"Unlike some of the longer speedskating races, the mass start, a roughly 6,500-meter race in which all of the skaters go at once, tends to generate more widespread excitement. That race has quickly become a fan favorite.\", \"\\u201cThere is no waiting for 25, 30 minutes to see who else is going to do the time trial and how is it going to unfold,\\u201d the American speedskater Joey Mantia told The Associated Press in 2018, when the mass start was introduced to the Olympics. If you want to mark your calendars, the men\\u2019s and women\\u2019s mass start will be held on Feb. 19, as the marquee final speedskating event of the Beijing Games.\"]","href_hash":"3cf495a68b0011ec8101bbb58eeab41b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3cf495a68b0011ec8101bbb58eeab41b"}},
