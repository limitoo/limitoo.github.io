Of course, one of the biggest draws is that you can also share each of these discoveries with your followers on social media, giving everybody else a sneak peek at your private listening habits.\", \"Not to mention, this year's edition of Spotify Wrapped also has a new section dedicated to characterizing your \\\"Audio Aura\\\" (choosing a swirl of color that best represents your music taste), as well as quiz cards that test how well you know your own library.\", \"In short, there are a ton of unique features associated with Wrapped 2021 that you will want to play around with. However, you won't have an unlimited amount of time to do this, as the annual roundup will disappear from the Spotify platform, sooner rather than later.\", \"Here is everything you need to know about when Wrapped 2021 will close.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">When Does Spotify Wrapped 2021 End?</div>\", \"This year's Spotify Wrapped debuted globally on Wednesday, December 1, although there was a brief delay for some users. Like with all previous iterations of the feature, the results are based on analytics from between January 1 and October 31.\", \"This consistent cut-off means that (once New Year's Day rolls around) Spotify will already be recording your data for the next version of Wrapped. As such, the current roundup will not linger on the home page forever and will need to be removed once we properly get into the swing of 2022.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945942/spotify-wrapped-2021-banner.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">After January 14, 2022, you will no longer be able to see this banner at the top of your screen in the Spotify app. </div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Will the 2021 Spotify Wrapped Playlists Be Accessible After January 14?</div>\", \"Spotify preserves your individual playlists from Wrapped, alongside the global ones that are based on the collective data of every user. The slideshow presentations (with all the infographics and factoids) are not kept though.\", \"You can easily revisit the Wrapped archives (from 2016 onwards), by just typing in the following URL format into your internet browser:\", \"https://open.spotify.com/genre/[year]-page\", \"Obviously, where it says \\\"[year]\\\", you will need to substitute that generic placeholder text for either 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 or 2020.\", \"Once Spotify Wrapped 2021 has closed, and is no longer being promoted on the app's homepage, it will be archived in the exact same way. In this case, you will be able to find the playlists by searching https://open.spotify.com/genre/2021-page.\", \"For more on Spotify Wrapped, check out our exclusive interview with the project's lead, who talked about how it has evolved into a global phenomenon over the years.
