An interactive permanent show guides visitors through the historical development of Western music; celebrates the contribution of Hungarian composers like Liszt, Bartok and Kodaly; and traces Hungary\\u2019s folk music tradition to its Central Asian roots. One room, painted in the colors of the Hungarian flag, features video displays on the country\\u2019s political history and famous athletes, with the national anthem as a soundtrack.\", \"Yet beyond the House of Music\\u2019s glass walls, which are animated by reflections of construction elsewhere in the park, this new building is mired in controversy.\", \"Critics have said that the government\\u2019s plans to develop the 200-year-old City Park into a museum district disturbs the natural environment, deprives locals of much-needed public space and raises concerns about corruption. But those behind the project say the site has always been more than a public park, and that the undertaking is Europe\\u2019s largest urban development project. In a speech, Orban described the transformation as an \\u201cunfinished work of art.\\u201d\", \"In 2012, Orban\\u2019s government announced an ambitious plan to transform the park, in disrepair after decades of neglect, into a district of five museums. The estimated cost at the time was about $250 million, but that had ballooned to nearly five times original projections by 2017.\", \"There had been a virtual consensus that the park needed work, but the government and park conservationists disagreed about the fate of the park\\u2019s natural features.\", \"A special legal designation allowed the project to skirt existing development rules, meaning the municipality of Budapest had little say over the government\\u2019s plans. And legislation adopted by Orban\\u2019s party placed the park under the purview of a newly created, state-owned company controlled by his allies. Sandor Lederer of K-Monitor, an anti-corruption watchdog, said that public records indicate the House of Music alone had cost Hungarian taxpayers as much as $100 million.\", \"\\u201cThe project is a good example of how public investments work under Orban,\\u201d Lederer said. \\u201cThere are no real needs and impact assessments done; citizens and affected parties are excluded from consultations and planning.\\u201d\", \"He added that poor planning and corruption have benefited companies widely seen as Orban\\u2019s clientele, saying, \\u201cNot only present, but also future generations will pay the costs of another Orban pet project.\\u201d\", \"Laszlo Baan, the government commissioner overseeing the project, declined to be interviewed, but a spokeswoman said in a statement that the government had so far spent 250 billion Hungarian Forint, about $800 million, on the project. Fujimoto\\u2019s office did not respond to an interview request.\", \"In 2016, private security guards clashed with park conservationists at the future site of the House of Music. Gergely Karacsony, an opposition politician who was elected mayor of Budapest in 2019, did not attend the House of Music\\u2019s Jan. 22 unveiling, which took place on the Day of Hungarian Culture, a national celebration. The building, he wrote on social media, was born not of culture, but of violence.\", \"In a radio interview, Karacsony recently likened construction in a public park to urinating in a stoop of Holy Water: \\u201cYou can do it, but it ruins why we are all there.\\u201d\", \"Orban, however, has sought to frame the museum district as a legacy project, and he has used it as a cudgel in his own war against what he sees as the West\\u2019s cultural decline. Unveiling the House of Music, he attacked critics of the park\\u2019s transformation as leftists who opposed beauty.\", \"\\u201cThe Hungarian nation never forgets the names of those who built the country,\\u201d Orban said in a speech at the ceremony, adding that detractors are not remembered, \\u201cbecause the Hungarian nation simply casts them out of its memory.\\u201d\", \"He added that national election\\u2019s in April would be \\u201ca period\\u201d that would end debate over the future of the park.\", \"Since returning to power in 2010, Orban and his allies have taken over public media, as well as most of the country\\u2019s private media, to promulgate far-right conspiracy theories, attack the regime\\u2019s critics and advance Orban\\u2019s culture war (which has also reached academia and the arts.) Hungary\\u2019s cities are currently blanketed in political ads featuring Orban\\u2019s main political opponent as Mini-Me from the Austin Powers movies.\", \"Orban\\u2019s political machine interprets culture as \\u201csomething that must be occupied or conquered,\\u201d said Krisztian Nyary, an author who grew up near City Park. \\u201cThey are only capable of thinking in terms of political logic, but culture is different.\\u201d\", \"He added: \\u201cDo we need a House of Music? I don\\u2019t know. I see it\\u2019s a beautiful building, and I\\u2019m sure they\\u2019ll have exciting events, but it doesn\\u2019t belong there.\\u201d Repurposing the park transforms its function, he said, jeopardizing a valuable natural environment that has served as \\u201cthe lungs\\u201d of surrounding neighborhoods.\", \"The park is bordered by the Sixth and Seventh districts, which Gabor Kerpel-Fronius, Budapest\\u2019s deputy mayor, said have the fewest green spaces in the city. The museum district, he added, could have been planned elsewhere, such as in a rundown rust zone nearby.\", \"Imre Kormendy, an architect, served as president of the Hungarian Society for Urban Planning when the museum district project began. He quickly learned that the government had no intention of meaningful consultation with stakeholders, he said.\", \"\\u201cNa\\u00efve professionals such as myself had no idea this project had already been decided,\\u201d he said. \\u201cNot even the Guggenheim was constructed inside of Central Park. Why should a city park be burdened with such development?\\u201d\", \"Yet Eszter Reisz, who raised her family in the area, said the park\\u2019s development was \\u201cfantastic\\u201d in comparison with its previously unkempt condition.\", \"For Klara Garay, a 71-year-old biology teacher who has lived near the park for decades, the repurposing of the park epitomizes the general climate in Hungary. She has been protesting against the park\\u2019s redevelopment since it began.\", \"\\u201cI feel despair,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThis country is morally at such a low point.\\u201d\", \"Although the House of Music aims for community-building and education, the strife over its genesis is a reminder of why many of Hungary\\u2019s most celebrated musicians \\u2014 such as Bartok, or Gyorgy Ligeti \\u2014 left the country.\", \"\\u201cThe political past of Hungary has been very problematic in certain phases of its history,\\u201d said the musicologist Felix Meyer, who runs the Paul Sacher Foundation in Switzerland. Many of the country\\u2019s talented musicians, he added, chose to live in the West.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s as simple as that,\\u201d Meyer said. \\u201cHungary was a small country and could be very repressive, and not all of them felt appreciated. These are great minds, very liberal minds, people who needed space and opportunities, so it\\u2019s natural they made big careers outside of Hungary.\\u201d\", \"The acclaimed Hungarian pianist Andras Schiff, who has been in self-imposed exile for over a decade in protest of Orban\\u2019s politics, said by phone that \\u201cThe way Orban supports culture is very selective.\\u201d Schiff added that Orban \\u201cwill support everything that follows him, everybody who joins the bandwagon.\\u201d\", \"Orban\\u2019s government, Schiff said, tried \\u201cvery hard to change history and change the facts, but it would be better to work on that, to admit faults and mistakes.\\u201d\", \"Asked if he would consider returning to Hungary if Mr. Orban is ousted in April, Mr. Schiff said, \\u201cYes, certainly.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI would love to come back,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThis is the place I was born, it\\u2019s my mother tongue, and I deeply love Hungarian culture.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8b4077fc844d11ec8bf951e3bd044eab"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8b4077fc844d11ec8bf951e3bd044eab"}},
