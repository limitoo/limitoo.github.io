Another video on social media appeared to show police firing on the vehicle as it crashed through street barriers. Police did not believe shots had been fired from the vehicle, Thompson added, contrary to earlier reports.\", \"Belen Santamaria, her husband, and their three-year old daughter were planning to join the parade with their Catholic Church.

And then we heard a loud bang, and just deafening cries and screams from people who are struck by the vehicle,\\\" Angelito Tenorio, an alderman in nearby West Allis, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\", \"The local CBS affiliate later showed a picture on Twitter of what appeared to be the red SUV involved with its hood crumpled and front fender hanging off, parked in a driveway.\", \"US President Joe Biden was briefed by aides about the events, a White House official said.\", \"\\\"The White House is closely monitoring the situation in Waukesha and our hearts go out to everyone who has been impacted by this terrible incident. We have reached out to state and local officials to offer any support and assistance as needed.\\\"\", \"Photos and videos of Waukesha circulating on Twitter showed police cars and ambulances crowding a street decked out with Christmas lights in the aftermath of the incident, which occurred shortly after 4:30pm (local time).
