She fell on her second run, under-rotating and slipping, but it did not matter. Her first run was more than enough to carry her to the finals as the favorite for the gold again.\", \"\\u201cI feel really good,\\u201d she said afterward, through a U.S. Olympic official because Kim did not stop to speak to reporters gathered at the base of the halfpipe. \\u201cObviously I\\u2019m going to have to bump it up tomorrow, so I\\u2019m looking forward to that. It\\u2019s going to be like a whole new competition.\\u201d\", \"Another American with designs on a gold medal was Maddie Mastro, a California quietly riding in Kim\\u2019s shadow the past few years.

He and the other men were scheduled to go through their qualifications later on Wednesday.\", \"The morning belonged to the women. Each of the 22 competitors were allowed two runs down the pipe, with its 22-foot walls. The best of their two scores, judged by an international panel, was used to rank them.\", \"The top 12 advanced to ride for medals the next day. Among them were a pair of veteran Chinese riders, Liu Jiayu and Cai Xuetong. Japan\\u2019s Mitsuki Ono finished second in qualifications behind Kim. \", \"Kim, 21, won the gold medal four years ago in Pyeongchang, South Korea. A year later, burned out and pondering retirement, she left the public eye and went to Princeton for a year of college. She went 22 months without stepping on a snowboard, the longest break since she began riding as a toddler.\", \"She returned to competition a year ago, though, independent, refreshed and as dominant as ever. She arrives in China as the favorite to win again, though the competition appears to have crept closer to Kim\\u2019s level. \", \"Liu was the silver medalist four years ago. Cai was fifth. Liu fell on her first run, the first run of the competition, catching an edge off a relatively easy maneuver.\", \"Kim followed, a bit tentative, perhaps, from what she had witnessed from her rival, but still received a strong score.\"]","href_hash":"ea0bdfc6895f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ea0bdfc6895f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
