Although Xi did not attend the U.N. climate conference this month, and China remains the world\\u2019s biggest polluter, the two countries did announce a joint agreement to \\u201cenhance ambition\\u201d on climate change.\", \"Background: Barack Obama tried a similar balancing act with the Chinese, securing promises from Xi to avoid militarizing the South China Sea and to reduce cyberconflicts. But since then, China has built up its military presence in the South China Sea, and cyberclashes have intensified.\", \"Related: Wall Street banks are finally being allowed to expand their businesses in China. But the access may not last for long.\", \"The Indian government announced that vaccinated foreigners from certain countries could travel to the country for the first time in more than 20 months.\", \"The return of tourism will be a major boost for the country, which in 2020 drew about a quarter of the travelers it had in 2019. However, India\\u2019s new rule only allows travel from 99 countries that have reciprocated. Travelers from several major countries, including China, Britain and Canada, are not yet allowed in because their countries have not reopened to visitors from India.\", \"The new rules are a sign of confidence in the country\\u2019s vaccination campaign. India recently administered its billionth vaccine dose, and more than 30 percent of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated. New cases are averaging about 20,000 daily, down from a May peak of more than 400,000.\", \"India joins a host of Asian countries that are lifting travel restrictions on foreign tourists. Cambodia also announced the end of its quarantine for inbound vaccinated travelers yesterday. South Korea and Singapore began a travel arrangement this week that allows fully vaccinated visitors to travel to either country without having to quarantine.\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"Life in Japan was disrupted by two major setbacks during the third quarter: a supply crunch that hit major manufacturers and the country\\u2019s worst coronavirus outbreak of the pandemic.\", \"From July to September, Japan\\u2019s economy shrunk by an annualized rate of 3 percent, reflecting the nation\\u2019s struggles to free itself from the virus-induced quagmire. Japan\\u2019s slow return to prepandemic life has left it lagging behind its peers in some ways, but the issues may not last long.\", \"Japan now has one of the highest vaccination rates among major nations, and it has lifted virtually all restrictions on its economy. Covid cases have dropped about 99 percent since their August peak. Foot traffic has nearly returned to prepandemic levels. Also, the semiconductor and the auto industries are expected to rebound relatively quickly as the pandemic begins to wane in Southeast Asia.\", \"What\\u2019s next: The Japanese government is expected to pass a stimulus package in the coming days, providing cash handouts to families with children, giving aid to small businesses and implementing measures to offset rising fuel prices.\", \"Restrictions: Other factors will continue to weigh on growth. The country remains closed to tourists and difficult to enter for many businesspeople and students.\", \"In remote southwestern Bulgaria, the Rhodope Narrow-Gauge Railway \\u2014 a 100-year-old railroad and the last of its kind in the country \\u2014 is the only means of transport connecting locals to the nearby market town, which sustains their incomes. But ridership is down and maintenance costs are high, threatening the railway\\u2019s survival. See what it\\u2019s like for the daily riders who rely on the train.\", \"An international Crypto\\u2019s Got Talent contest is now underway. Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Malta, Mexico, Thailand and Vietnam are all in the race. But tech entrepreneurs like Ukraine, and Ukrainians like crypto.\", \"Ukrainians are among the most avid cryptocurrency users in the world, ranking fourth in an index compiled by Chainalysis, behind Vietnam, India and Pakistan. The volume of cryptocurrency transactions each day, about $150 million, exceeds the volume of interbank exchanges in government-issued currency.\", \"Residents lack better options. Banks in Ukraine are so sclerotic that sending or receiving even small amounts of money from another country requires an obstacle course of paperwork. The country itself has suffered through too many scandals to expect a major influx from international investment banks.\", \"The government is hoping to bury its anything-goes reputation with an assist from cryptocurrency. Step one in the ambitious campaign was legalizing and regulating Bitcoin.\", \"But the status quo is still attractive for some. \\u201cI like that it\\u2019s corrupt here,\\u201d one crypto entrepreneur from New Jersey said. \\u201cHere, we get to play the game that only elites in the U.S. play.\\u201d\", \"This lemony chicken soup is lighter than a traditional stew.\", \"These four stretches combat too much screen time.\", \"\\u201cThe 1619 Project,\\u201d a new book based on the Times Magazine project, is \\u201csearing\\u201d and \\u201crich in unfamiliar detail,\\u201d the historian Adam Hochschild writes in a review.\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: Charming and smooth (five letters).\", \"And here is today\\u2019s Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.
