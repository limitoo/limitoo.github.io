New Zealand needs immigration at all skill levels, and we need to welcome migrants back to New Zealand and acknowledge the contribution they make to the economy and our communities,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"With borders now opening up, we also risk a net outflow of workers from New Zealand and an even bigger skills shortage crisis if we don't get immigration settings right.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"9a2abfa2b0c611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9a2abfa2b0c611ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
