The post was quickly deleted by Chinese state-run media, and news about the incident has been heavily censored across the country.\", \"Since then, world tennis bodies and the U.S. and British governments have expressed concern over Peng's disappearance. They have called on China to provide verifiable proof that the tennis player is safe.\", \"On Sunday, Peng was reportedly seen in photos and videos published from a tennis tournament organized by China Open. In the online footage, the 35-year-old player could be seen smiling among guests wearing a dark blue jacket and white trousers, Reuters reported.\", \"The night before, Peng was also allegedly seen dining with a group of people at a restaurant in downtown Beijing.\", \"However, officials with the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) and the International Tennis Federation (ITF) said the images were \\\"insufficient\\\" in proving Peng's safety and that they failed to address the international community's concerns.\", \"\\\"While it is positive to see her, it remains unclear if she is free and able to make decisions and take actions on her own, without coercion or external interference. This video alone is insufficient,\\\" WTA Chairman Steve Simon said, per Yahoo Sports.\", \"\\\"As I have stated from the beginning, I remain concerned about Peng Shuai's health and safety and that the allegation of sexual assault is being censored and swept under the rug,\\\" Simon added.\", \"Earlier this week, the WTA was allegedly sent an email from Peng stating that is safe at home and that the sexual assault accusation was a lie. Simon, however, believes that message was written by Chinese-state media.\", \"\\\"I have a hard time believing that Peng Shuai actually wrote the email we received or believes what is being attributed to her,\\\" Simon said. \\\"Peng Shuai must be allowed to speak freely, without coercion or intimidation from any source. Her allegation of sexual assault must be respected, investigated with full transparency and without censorship.\\\"\", \"ITF President Dave Haggerty also told Reuters that while the latest footage \\\"appears to be a positive step,\\\" officials will continue to seek direct confirmation from Peng that she is safe.\", \"Both tennis bodies have told media outlets that they have repeatedly tried to contact Peng but have been unable to reach her.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1937240/peng-shuai-disappearance-photographs-beijing.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Tennis star Peng Shuai was reportedly photographed this weekend in Beijing following concerns that she disappeared following a sexual assault allegation she made.
