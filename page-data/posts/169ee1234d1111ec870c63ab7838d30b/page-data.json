Waiting for help, she saw that everything was red: her face, her hands, the ground.\", \"Martin had been transformed into a \\u201cblurred figure,\\u201d she writes, her torn face \\u201cslicked over with internal tissue,\\u201d as if a birth had taken place, \\u201cfor it is manifestly not a death.\\u201d In contrast to the crush of her ravaged features, she experienced a sharpening of her other senses, a kind of extreme lucidity. She could hear the rescue helicopter long before it arrived: \\u201cA few minutes later an orange metal monster, a refugee from the Soviet era, comes to pluck us from this place.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIn the Eye of the Wild\\u201d is Martin\\u2019s haunting, genre-defying memoir of the year that followed, though in Sophie R. Lewis\\u2019s elegant translation from the French, it becomes clear that \\u201cmemoir\\u201d is another word that doesn\\u2019t quite fit this slender yet expansive book. Martin writes as an anthropologist, recounting her work among the Indigenous Even people who live in Kamchatka\\u2019s Tvayan area; she writes about philosophy, too, noticing that everyone around her tries to find a reason for what happened because \\u201cit is hard to leave sense unmade.\\u201d She questions the human propensity to try to assimilate everything into familiar terms \\u2014 to domesticate it, often as a prelude to dominance and control. But her mutilated body \\u201chas become a place of convergence,\\u201d she writes, of \\u201climinality.\\u201d Inside and outside, human and animal: \\u201cA bear and a woman meet and the frontiers between the two worlds implode.\\u201d\", \"The bear tore off part of Martin\\u2019s jaw and two of her teeth; Russian doctors installed a metal plate in her face, which French doctors later replaced. (\\u201cMy jaw is made the scene of a Franco-Russian medical Cold War.\\u201d) \\u201cI see myself mechanized, robotified, dehumanized,\\u201d Martin writes. But she also felt an enormous gratitude to her French surgeon and \\u201cher civilized hands, which seek solutions to the problems of wild animals.\\u201d\", \"Martin was 29 years old at the time, and we learn little about her life before. Her father died during her adolescence, and as a child she was always in search of adventure: \\u201cThe anti-life consisted of the classroom, mathematics and the city.\\u201d Before the encounter, the Evens were already calling her matukha, or \\u201cshe-bear.\\u201d It sounds like a coincidence, but Martin describes the encounter as something else. \\u201cI had to go to meet my dream,\\u201d she says of the event, realizing that it sounds absurd. But \\u201cabsurdity\\u201d and \\u201ccoincidence\\u201d are categories that cease to be useful to her. \\u201cThere is only resonance,\\u201d she writes.\", \"Returned to the ostensible safety of civilization, Martin noticed that the things people said to her were often oblivious and cruel. One hospital therapist asked her how she was feeling, \\u201cBecause, you know, the face is our identity.\\u201d Others murmured how \\u201cpretty\\u201d she must have been \\u201cbefore.\\u201d A visiting relative, presumably trying to comfort her, said, \\u201cIt could be worse, you just look like you\\u2019re fresh out of the gulag.\\u201d Martin decided that she had to go back to Kamchatka. A friend compared her to Persephone, \\u201cwho returns annually to the underworld in order the better to climb back up into the light.\\u201d\", \"As an anthropologist, Martin had spent her career learning about animism, the belief that the world is imbued with spiritual forces beyond human intention. She found herself drawn to \\u201cthe tanglement of ontologies, the dialogue between worlds\\u201d \\u2014 intriguing ideas, or that\\u2019s what she told herself. Animism was something that was \\u201cnice material to write about,\\u201d she says, before she was yanked out of her presumption that she could somehow keep herself at a distance, as an observer, without also being acted upon. Before the bear, she had started to dream \\u2014 chasing a wolf, following a beaver. This, she says, marked an \\u201cinner disturbance\\u201d; she was still herself, but her unconscious was in search of something else.\", \"After the bear, the Evens called her medka \\u2014 a human who has been \\u201cmarked by the bear\\u201d and lives between worlds. Some of them wanted to avoid her, while others tried to reassure her. \\u201cThe bears give us a gift: You, by leaving you alive,\\u201d said Daria, one of her Even friends in Tvayan. Martin felt both moved and repulsed \\u2014 touched by the awareness of something beyond human intention, but also irritated that these \\u201cabsent participants\\u201d felt entitled to interpret an event that had happened not to them but to her. \\u201cThis is precisely why I keep coming up against reductive and even trivializing interpretations, however lovingly meant,\\u201d she writes. \\u201cWe are facing a semantic void, an off-script leap that challenges and unnerves all categories.\\u201d\", \"What Martin describes in this book isn\\u2019t so much a search for meaning as an acceptance of its undoing. Asked a few years before to describe the collapse of the Soviet Union, Daria said: \\u201cOne day the light went out and the spirits came back. And we returned to the forest.\\u201d On her return to Kamchatka, Martin found the beginning of what she was looking for. \\u201cNo matter how it appears, the world is collapsing simultaneously everywhere,\\u201d she writes. \\u201cThe only difference is that in Tvayan, they live knowingly amid the wreckage.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"169ee1234d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"169ee1234d1111ec870c63ab7838d30b"}},
