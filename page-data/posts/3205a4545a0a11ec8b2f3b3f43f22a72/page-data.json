But the matchups offer a diverse showing of fighters whom the company has leaned on for several years, a circumstance that was evident on Thursday as the fighters stared each other down after a news conference.\", \"The U.F.C.\\u2019s president, Dana White, said he appreciated the fighters\\u2019 different approaches. The lightweight champion, Charles Oliveira (31-8-0), and the No. 1 contender, Dustin Poirier (28-6 -0), who will headline U.F.C. 269, looked each other in the eyes intently, but briefly talked.\", \"Amanda Nunes (21-4-0), who will defend her bantamweight belt, wore a Gucci bucket hat while she bickered with her challenger, Juliana Pe\\u00f1a (11-4-0). White said each card had a unique dynamic regardless of the common spotlight.\", \"\\u201cFans respect these types of fights,\\u201d White said in a telephone interview.\", \"These fights conclude a year that heavily featured Poirier, who will be competing for the lightweight title for the second time in his career. In July, he fought McGregor, the brash Irish star, in the U.F.C.\\u2019s most heavily marketed event of 2021. He defeated McGregor by technical knockout in the first round of what was their third fight since 2014. McGregor landed awkwardly after a blow and fractured his left tibia, a surprise conclusion to a week of hostility as McGregor repeatedly insulted Poirier and Poirier\\u2019s wife, Jolie.\", \"Beyond money and elevated stardom, the fight was risky. Poirier, who entered the U.F.C. in 2011, had won six of his last seven fights \\u2014 the loss coming against the former champion Khabib Nurmagomedov in 2019 \\u2014 and could have argued instead for a title shot with Oliveira. He jeopardized an essentially guaranteed championship fight and risked having to climb up the ranks again if he lost. But he bet on himself and is now in position to potentially end the year with gold and leather.\", \"\\u201cThese lessons I\\u2019ve learned, I\\u2019m very grateful for,\\u201d Poirier told reporters. \\u201cBeing the world champion is forever \\u2014 25 minutes until eternity. That\\u2019s what\\u2019s going through my head every night when I go to sleep.\\u201d\", \"Oliveira became the champion in May when he defeated Michael Chandler by technical knockout in the second round. Nurmagomedov (29-0-0) retired in 2020 with an unblemished record and when he competed, he essentially held the division hostage. This will be Oliveira\\u2019s first title defense, and an interesting matchup for him as a jiu-jitsu specialist against a well-rounded fighter like Poirier. The parity at the top of the lightweight division for the first time since 2018 excites White.\", \"\\u201cYou never know who is going to win, and there\\u2019s going to be some exciting fights,\\u201d White said. \\u201cKhabib was incredible and dominating everybody, and now you don\\u2019t know who could possibly be the champion.\\u201d\", \"Nunes, similar to Nurmagomedov, has cemented herself as one of the best athletes in the sport. She entered the U.F.C. in 2013 and has lost just once in the company. Women\\u2019s mixed martial arts grew through fighters such as Ronda Rousey, Holly Holm, Miesha Tate and Cris Justino, known as Cyborg.\", \"Nunes defeated Tate to become bantamweight champion in 2016 and easily dispatched the rest afterward, showing versatility in all of her fights with strong punches, head kicks and submissions. Her knockout of Justino in 2018 for the featherweight belt made her the first woman in U.F.C. history to be a simultaneous champion in two weight classes.\", \"Nunes, who is a lesbian, and her partner became parents last year, and Nunes has been open about motherhood and her sexuality. In a bloody, male-dominated sport like mixed martial arts, White said her identities are important for representation.\", \"\\u201cShe touches so many different types of people and that\\u2019s awesome for reaching them and converting them to fans,\\u201d White said. \\u201cBut above all that and everything she is, she\\u2019s an awesome human being and I love working with her.\\u201d\", \"Nunes contracted the coronavirus in July, canceling an earlier scheduled fight with Pe\\u00f1a in August. The delay frustrated Pe\\u00f1a, and she has mentioned it frequently during media tours. Pe\\u00f1a has for years said she felt Nunes was avoiding her. Now, the matchup is set.\", \"\\u201cNo matter what she does Saturday, I will finish her,\\u201d Nunes said. \\u201cThis belt isn\\u2019t going anywhere.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"3205a4545a0a11ec8b2f3b3f43f22a72"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3205a4545a0a11ec8b2f3b3f43f22a72"}},
