Minister Michael Gunner had released his\\u00a0government's updated plan for managing clusters among remote and vulnerable residents.\", \"\\\"The most important public health measure you can do if you get a COVID case in a remote community is to rush to that community with the vaccine,\\\" he said.\", \"He based his rationale on modelling by the Doherty Institute that showed \\\"vaccination surges\\\" would significantly decrease the risk, particularly in places where the majority of residents were yet to be inoculated.\", \"\\\"If you get a COVID case in a remote community and you do a vaccination surge in that community, you will reduce \\u2014 halve \\u2014 the risk of hospitalisation in the community and, therefore, deaths.\\\"\", \"The total number of cases in the
