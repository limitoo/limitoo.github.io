Its inspectors and cameras have been the prime source of information about Iran\\u2019s atomic program, which many in the West believe is coming ever closer to having the know-how and material to fashion a nuclear weapon, despite Iran\\u2019s repeated insistence of peaceful intent.\", \"The agency\\u2019s director-general, Rafael M. Grossi, told a quarterly meeting of its board of governors in Geneva that two days of talks in Tehran had not produced an agreement to reinstall surveillance cameras at a centrifuge-parts workshop in Karaj, Iran. The workshop was the target of apparent sabotage in June, an attack that Iran blames on Israel.\", \"After what he called intense negotiations, Mr. Grossi told reporters: \\u201cWe could not agree yesterday, in spite of my best efforts.\\u2019\\u2019 He vowed to continue trying, saying, \\u201cWe must reach an agreement.\\u2019\\u2019\", \"The Karaj factory is once again producing parts for centrifuges, which enrich uranium, but without monitoring by the agency. In September, Iran had reached an agreement with Mr. Grossi to allow agency inspectors access to monitoring devices, including cameras with full memory cards and automated measuring devices under seal, in various nuclear facilities. But Iran has since denied inspectors access to change the memory cards and retrieve the data.\", \"Mr. Grossi said talks with Iran would continue, but that time was running out.\", \"\\u201cWe are close to the point where I would not be able to guarantee continuity of knowledge\\u201d of activities at the workshop, he said, adding that the information is \\u201cwidely recognized as essential in relation to a return\\u2019\\u2019 to the 2015 nuclear deal that put tough limits on Iran\\u2019s nuclear enrichment and other activities.\", \"According to The Wall Street Journal, Iran refused to offer the agency access to Karaj unless it dropped parts of a long-running inquiry into the discovery of undeclared nuclear material in Iran, raising concerns that Tehran is hiding past or current nuclear military activities.\", \"President Biden is in negotiations to bring the United States back into the 2015 deal, which former President Donald J. Trump renounced more than three years ago. But since the last round of those negotiations ended in June, Iran elected a more conservative president, Ebrahim Raisi. He has expressed deep skepticism about the value of the negotiations unless the United States immediately lifts all punitive sanctions against Iran and commits to never leaving the deal again. Both those conditions are impossible to meet, senior American officials say.\", \"On Monday, for the first time since Mr. Raisi took office this summer, Iranian negotiators plan to meet with their European, Chinese and Russian counterparts in Vienna to resume talks on the deal. But the Europeans, and American negotiators following the talks, are far more pessimistic than when they left Vienna five months ago. Today, the nuclear deal looks dead, and President Biden\\u2019s vision of re-entering the agreement in his first year, then building something \\u201clonger and stronger,\\u201d appears all but gone.\", \"Iran breached the terms of the 2015 deal in response to what it said was the United States\\u2019 reimposition of punitive sanctions under Mr. Trump and European countries\\u2019 failure to fulfill economic promises they had made to Iran as part of the agreement.\", \"American officials estimate that Iran could now have enough highly enriched uranium for one bomb within about two months, although its ability to create a weapon \\u2014 a goal Iran has always denied \\u2014 would be perhaps two years away.\", \"In Tehran, Mr. Grossi met Mohammad Eslami, the head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, and Iran\\u2019s foreign minister, Hossain Amirabdollahian, who said that Tehran wanted \\u201cconstructive engagement\\u201d with the agency.\"]","href_hash":"958b6a9d4d3d11ec8360318d29265bc7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"958b6a9d4d3d11ec8360318d29265bc7"}},
