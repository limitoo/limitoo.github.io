Another said Satan must be pleased with the conflict regarding LGBTQ rights, Duke said.\", \"Duke, who has been a Methodist minister for thirty years, had thought most of the 400-member congregation shared his views on inclusion, having been making a reputation as an LGBTQ supporter.\", \"\\\"It was a matter of sadness and disappointment and heartbreak on my part ... realizing I was losing the ability to lead,\\\" he said to the Associated Press.\", \"He said the email attacks \\\"felt very personal\\\" and he was concerned about his mental health.\", \"Duke said regional superintendent Mitch Gieselman made it clear that he needed to resign, despite no option to under United Methodist Church protocol.\", \"Duke was invited by an LGBTQ Pride group in Evansville to come on the \\\"We're Here\\\" show, which has three known drag performers go to towns and small cities around the U.S. and have locals join them as drag queens. Duke accepted partly in support of Tiffany, his 23-year-old daughter who identifies as pansexual.\", \"The episode in which Duke appears was filmed in July and aired on November 8. In one scene, he is seen in a dress, high-heeled boots, a pink wig, and heavy make-up.\", \"A few congregation members complained that Duke failed to give them a notice of his decision before the episode aired, which had scenes taped at the church.\", \"Duke wrote an apology to the congregation in August, saying he was sorry his leadership's trust was damaged, but defended himself by saying, \\\"I was willing and excited to share God's love with the LGBTQ community on a national level.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947985/craig-duke-methodist-church-minister-termination.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">This image released by HBO shows Pastor Craig Duke, of Newburgh, Indiana, appearing in drag in a scene from the HBO series \\\"We're Here.\\\" Duke\\u2019s pastoral duties have been terminated--the result of a bitter rift surfacing in his Indiana church after he sought to demonstrate solidarity by appearing in drag alongside prominent drag queens in the reality show. </div>\", \"On November 26, Gieselman\\u2014who had been hearing from the pastor's critics and supporters\\u2014sent a letter to the NUMC congregation announcing that Duke \\\"is being relieved of his pastoral duties.\\\"\", \"Through the next three months, Duke said he and his wife will be allowed to continue living in the NUMC parsonage, while he incurs a 40 percent pay cut. They must relocate no later than February 28, when his pay will be halted, Gieselman said.\", \"While Gieselman noted in his letter that Duke's actions had \\\"polarized\\\" the congregation, he said none of those actions constituted formal violations of UMC's Book of Discipline, which functions as a legal code for Methodist clergy.\", \"The rift within Duke's congregation reflects broader divisions within the United Methodist Church, the largest mainline Protestant denomination in the United States.\", \"Conservative leaders in the UMC have unveiled plans to form a new denomination, the Global Methodist Church, with a doctrine that does not recognize same-sex marriage. The move could hasten the long-expected breakup of the UMC over differing approaches to LGBTQ inclusion, including whether LGBTQ people should be ordained as clergy.\", \"Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the UMC's General Conference\\u2014at which the schism would be debated\\u2014has been postponed for two consecutive years and is now scheduled for August 2022 in Minneapolis.\", \"According to Duke, one of the reasons he was invited to appear on \\\"We're Here\\\" was because of the divisions in both his own church and the UMC.\", \"\\\"My only hope and goal was and is to bring the message of God's unconditional love to a community that has been greatly marginalized,\\\" Duke wrote to his congregation.\", \"The decision to terminate Duke's duties already has had ripple effects. His wife, Linda, who was pastor of youth ministry, resigned. So did church administrative assistant Erin Sexton, who, along with her husband Chris, organized a GoFundMe campaign to help the Dukes.\", \"As of Wednesday morning, more than $52,000 had been pledged by more than 900 people, scores of whom added comments thanking Duke for his LGBTQ advocacy.\", \"Chris Sexton said he had been a member of Newburgh United Methodist since childhood and described Duke as \\\"one of the most captivating and genuine\\\" of the many pastors who served over the years. But the Sextons said many congregants shied away from the conflict over \\\"We're Here,\\\" allowing Duke's critics to dominate the debate.\", \"Duke is unsure what his next step will be, though he doesn't plan to return to pastoring. One possibility, he said, would be for him and his wife to establish \\\"an inclusive camp\\\" for youths and young adults.\", \"\\\"My heart is moving in a new direction,\\\" he said. \\\"There are so many people who have been hurt by religion, felt rejection, who are reaching out, who are hopeful this will spark me to do something different on their behalf.\\\"\", \"The Associated Press contributed to this report. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947988/were-here-craig-duke-minister-termination.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Reverend Craig Duke received attacking emails from some of his congregation members of the Newburgh United Methodist Church after appearing on the Emmy-nominated show \\\"We're Here,\\\" with one of the emails saying \\u201cYou have thrown NUMC under the bus to elevate a minority of individuals.\\\" Above, Shangela, Bob the Drag Queen, and Eureka O'Hara attend the \\\"We're Here\\\" Season 2 Premiere at Sony Pictures Studios on October 08, 2021, in Culver City, California. </div>\"]","href_hash":"d686746c586c11ecab842f401e8d7384"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d686746c586c11ecab842f401e8d7384"}},
