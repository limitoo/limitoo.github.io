The injuries were caused by the animal wandering the Spanish island of La Palma under a volcanic ash cloud.\", \"The cat, called Magma, was hurt, but survived the ordeal.

The cat had several examinations, including one on its eyes, which had been affected by the ash and fumes.\", \"In addition, the cat's paws, burned from walking on the hot ground, were wrapped by the vet to aid recovery. Magma was fed before being put in a cage with a thick blanket to rest and recover.\", \"Leales.org has been advocating for better protection of pets on the island since the eruption began. It is calling on local government to dispatch drones to monitor the location and status of abandoned pets while prepping plans to rescue distressed animals.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931935/cumbre-vieja-volcano.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Lava flows after a partial cone collapsed near the Cumbre Vieja volcano\\u2019s emission vent.
