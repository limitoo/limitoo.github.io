Doherty is stationed at northern Vermont\\u2019s Camp Ethan Allen Training Site, where 11,000 acres are home to the Army Mountain Warfare School, the 86th Mountain Infantry brigade combat team and, somewhat incongruously, a dedicated biathlon training course and rifle range.\", \"Doherty, 26, is one of nine biathletes at the camp, most of whom live in barracks-like rooms when they\\u2019re not competing in Europe during the winter. Each dutifully carries out nearly all of the responsibilities of a typical National Guard member, and that includes the possibility that they could be deployed to serve around the world. Two recently returned from duty in Djibouti.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s part of what you signed on for; it comes with the job,\\u201d said Doherty, who has competed in two previous Olympics.\", \"It is next to impossible that Doherty\\u2019s impending Beijing Olympics journey will be interrupted by an assignment on the Russian-Ukraine border. But his concern that a faraway war could impact his post-Olympics life highlights the uncommon nature of the Army\\u2019s program in the biathlon, a sport that mixes cross-country skiing and rifle shooting into one demanding race.\", \"Competitors dash around a hilly course on skis with a rifle strapped to their backs and stop at designated spots to fire at targets from 50 meters. Targets are as small as a half dollar, and missed shots can earn penalty loops that add to a competitor\\u2019s distance skied.\", \"The Army National Guard\\u2019s biathlon program dates to 1973 and became attractive to athletes in the sport because the Army pays for nearly all the expenses for training, high-level coaching and travel to European competitions. Olympic-level athletes in sports like track and field, boxing and bobsledding can reap similar benefits from joining the Army.\", \"In addition to attracting new National Guard recruits, officials overseeing the biathlon program insist it pays dividends by developing valuable skills of use to the Army.\", \"\\u201cLearning how to shoot accurately when your heart is beating 180 times a minute is a great combat skill,\\u201d Kevin Elmer, an Army major and the coordinator of the National Guard program, said with a nod to the recurring aerobic challenges of biathlon races that can be as long as 12 miles.\", \"\\u201cWhen people are shooting at you,\\u201d Elmer added, \\u201cthat is how fast your heart beats.\\u201d\", \"The biathlon has centuries-old military roots. Hunters in Scandinavia were forced to traverse snow-covered forests in the winter with rifles draped over their shoulders, as were armed forces defending home turf. By the mid-1800s, skiing regiments of soldiers organized contests that mixed shooting and marksmanship for recreation and training.\", \"For Vermont\\u2019s National Guard biathletes, based about 50 miles from the Canadian border, the mix of military exercises and their sport\\u2019s specific training is never far from their minds.\", \"The athletes, for example, are frequently awakened by gunfire.\", \"\\u201cIt was kind of weird in my first couple months in camp that in the mornings we\\u2019d hear some kind of heavy machine gun going off or something exploding up on the top of a hill,\\u201d said Lina Farra, 20, a top-ranked junior biathlete who joined the National Guard last summer. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s actually kind of cool to be running up a hill for a workout and you\\u2019ve got soldiers marching down the hill. You understand the environment pretty quick.\\u201d\", \"Deedra Irwin, who was the Vermont National Guard soldier of the year in 2021, has learned to call ahead before she runs on trails at the base.\", \"\\u201cBecause there\\u2019s always somebody coming out of the forest in camo,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSometimes they spook me. And I think I spook them, too. We\\u2019re each practicing our jobs but hopefully they\\u2019re not looking for me.\\u201d\", \"In biathlon, various club teams nationwide also sponsor athletes, but Max Cobb, the president and chief executive of the U.S. Biathlon Association, said that many of those athletes \\u201chave to have jobs in the off-season to try to make ends meet, and it\\u2019s a struggle.\\u201d\", \"Having time to work out in the off-season unencumbered by the need to hold down a full-time job can be essential to competing at an elite, international level. Or as Doherty said: \\u201cPrior to joining the Army, I had good support, but I also had to work really hard to find sponsors and to create some funding for equipment and so many other expenses. As a soldier, the approach to those things is much simpler.\\u201d\", \"Three years ago, when Irwin, 29, was explaining to her family why joining the National Guard was a good idea, one selling point was the ability to help pay off the college loan debt she had accumulated while attending Michigan Tech. Irwin, like any soldier in the National Guard, is also paid a salary.\", \"\\u201cGetting my student loans paid is awesome,\\u201d Irwin said. \\u201cI was able to pretty much live the lifestyle I wanted with the support that I needed, and without all the extra hassle.\\u201d\", \"Still, she conceded, \\u201cEverybody has to ask themselves: Is the Army the right choice for them?\\u201d\", \"It was a question Irwin contemplated a few times during portions of her grueling, 10-week basic training at Fort Leonard Wood in the Missouri Ozarks three years ago.\", \"\\u201cThere were some really dark moments where you\\u2019re saying, \\u2018Did I make the right decision?\\u2019\\u201d she said. \\u201cLike when you\\u2019re getting woken up at 4 a.m. by somebody yelling in your ear. It\\u2019s very stressful for everybody and there\\u2019s some clashes.\", \"\\u201cBut you learn how to deal with that, how to learn from it and how to trust people. It\\u2019s a life-changing experience.\\u201d\", \"Asked if it prepared her mentally to serve in a war zone, if necessary, Irwin said the Army made sure that each biathlete was aware that they were making the same commitment as any National Guard member.\", \"\\u201cWe sign the same contract as everybody else,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIf given the opportunity to deploy, maybe once I\\u2019ve retired from biathlon, I would gladly go.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"05786b908b0d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"05786b908b0d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
