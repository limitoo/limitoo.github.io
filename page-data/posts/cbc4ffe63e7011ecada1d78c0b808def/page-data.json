The field in which the runners will be on has also shrunk by nearly 40 percent, according to the Associated Press. They will start at the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge, then wind their way toward Central Park. Spectators are being encouraged to maintain social distancing.\", \"Organizers, particularly Director Ted Metellus, hope the event will bring together New Yorkers in a way not seen before the pandemic.\", \"\\\"When I think about this year, I will be excited, I'll be energized,\\\" he told AP, \\\"but I also realize how much it means to everybody else in the city.\\\"\", \"New York has been in the process of slowly reopening after the COVID-19 pandemic. The city has been reopening businesses and districts since the spring, with the marathon being held to celebrate the tenacity of its citizens. But the race had to be changed to consider the continuing pandemic.\", \"\\\"The classic line of, 'We've always done it that way,' that wasn't going to be an option,\\\" Metellus said.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927442/new-york-city-marathon-2019.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The New York City Marathon will return on November 7 with some significant changes. Above, supporters are seen during the 2019 marathon on November 3. </div>\", \"Gary Muhrcke was an amateur when he became the first runner to cross the finish line at a New York City Marathon, and none of the 54 men who followed him were pros, either.\", \"Which isn't to say they weren't serious.\", \"\\\"They turned the clock off at 3:59,\\\" he recalled this week.\", \"The race's 1970 debut\\u2014staged entirely in Central Park\\u2014hardly resembled the five-borough track that has drawn millions into the Big Apple's streets on the first Sunday of nearly every November since. Adaptation, though, has seemingly always enabled the second oldest of the world's marathon majors to do more of what it does best\\u2014inspire and celebrate.\", \"The 50th edition of the NYC Marathon will certainly test that.\", \"No turning the clock off after four hours this time\\u2014the last group won't take off until noon, four hours after the professional wheelchair division is the first to hit the streets.\", \"Several Olympic medalists will compete in the open division, with the men's and women's champions earning $100,000 each. The most anticipated by fans locally will be Molly Seidel, an American woman who won bronze in the Tokyo Olympics marathon in just her third race at the distance. She was the first U.S. woman to medal since Deena Kastor won bronze in 2004.\", \"Seidel's medal-winning run was only 13 weeks ago, a short turnaround for marathon runners. Seidel said she was entering Sunday without expectations. Her top competitor, Peres Jepchirchir of Kenya, is coming off the same limited rest after winning gold in Tokyo.\", \"It's a big turn into the spotlight for the 27-year-old Seidel, who has never run a marathon amid this kind of fanfare. Spectators at the 2020 U.S. Olympic trials created energy but not on New York's scale, while the 2020 London Marathon was held behind locked gates at St. James Park. Some locals lined the streets for the Olympic marathon in Sapporo, Japan, but Seidel said \\\"it was very low key, a lot of like, golf clapping.\\\"\", \"Her family also will be able to watch her race in person for the first time since the U.S. trials.\", \"\\\"I'm looking forward to the crowds, getting to have that energy again,\\\" she said. \\\"And I don't know, I mean, this is my dream job, every time I get to go out and do a marathon.\\\"\", \"Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia is the headliner for the men's race. The four-time Olympic champion is among the most decorated distance runners ever, and at 39, he might be running his last race on U.S. soil.\", \"The top American in the men's field should be Ben True, a six-time national champion at other distances who is making his marathon debut.\", \"American Daniel Romanchuk is seeking a third straight victory in the men's wheelchair race, while former champs Manuela Sch\\u00e4r of Switzerland and Tatyana McFadden of the U.S. lead the women's wheelchair division.\", \"There will be some gold medals in the non-competitive waves, too: U.S. women's national soccer team alumni Abby Wambach, Lauren Holiday, Kate Markgraf and Leslie Osborne are among the celebrities running this year.\", \"Former New York Giants running back Tiki Barber is racing for the seventh time, while two members of British rock band Mumford & Sons are running NYC for the first time. Tony Award-winning actress Kelli O'Hara will perform the national anthem and then hit the course, and former contestants on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette, Matt James, Tyler Cameron, Tayshia Adams and Zac Clark, are also participating.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1927438/kenenisa-bekele.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The New York City Marathon will be run on November 7, 2021, with Ethiopia's Kenenisa Bekele as the headliner for the men's race.
