At that time, he predicted that widespread vaccinations, along with more government spending and business reopening, would spur the economic recovery for several years.\\u00a0\", \"To be sure, there have been dramatic changes in the U.S. economy and the geopolitical situation since 2021. For one, inflation picked up in the middle of 2021, surging to 7.9% in February. And Russia's invasion of Ukraine is likely to \\\"slow the global economy,\\\" Dimon wrote on Monday.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"America must be ready for the possibility of an extended war in Ukraine with unpredictable outcomes,\\\" he wrote. \\\"We need to pursue short-term and long-term strategies with the goal of not only solving the current crisis but also maintaining the long-term unity of the newly strengthened democratic alliances.\\\"\", \"JPMorgan stands to lose $1 billion due to Russia's war on Ukraine, he noted. But the U.S. should increase sanctions against Russia, direct \\\"billions of dollars in aid\\\" to Ukraine and help with Europe's migration crisis as a result of the war, Dimon said.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"5c7d6e8eb42211ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5c7d6e8eb42211ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
