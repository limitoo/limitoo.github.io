In place of the usual crowded dance floor, people were lying on blankets in the middle of the club. Instead of bumping beats, the music was calming, and the space was filled with candles. Rather than dancing body to body, guests engaged in gentle forms of touch: caressing, hugging and leaning on each other.\", \"They had gathered for an event called \\u201cUnder the Tongue: A Hibernation Temple and Ceremony,\\u201d organized by Nocturnal Medicine, a nonprofit that hosts parties meant to encourage spiritual healing. Together, the group would work to ease each other\\u2019s worries about the seasonal transition to winter \\u2014 the second since the coronavirus outbreak was declared a pandemic in March 2020.\", \"\\u201cWe noticed, in ourselves and in our friends and in the people we were speaking to, an uneasiness about winter approaching,\\u201d said Michelle Shofet, 33, who founded Nocturnal Medicine with Larissa Belcic, also 33. \\u201cThere was this kind of discomfort, uncertainty, fear, anxiety of returning to the cold, to this time of being shut in.\\u201d\", \"As the pandemic closes in on its second year, people are continuing to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety at a high rate. Many still feel socially isolated and deprived of human touch. Some have tried adopting pets to combat loneliness, or went to therapy. Others have sought relief through nonclinical means: by creating new rituals and immersing themselves in new social settings, where conversation and connection can lead to new realizations.\", \"Though some of Nocturnal Medicine\\u2019s events are referred to \\u201craves,\\u201d they don\\u2019t involve shoulder-to-shoulder dancing or rely on hedonistic drug consumption. Rather, the organization borrows principles from rave culture such as the power of crowds and the sense of release that parties can provide.\", \"That evening\\u2019s offerings included a sound bath, a guided meditation, a candle-lighting ritual and an invitation to interact with an art installation in the center of the dance floor.\", \"The installation, which consisted of sculptures made of tree stumps, horseshoe crab bodies, stone and dirt, was meant to serve as a \\u201cvisual cue for the concepts of cycles and time,\\u201d Ms. Shofet said. \\u201cThe stone is meant to reference geological time scales that are moving much more slowly than us. With horseshoe crabs, which are one of the oldest living species on earth, we wanted to have this sort of ancient creature present.\\u201d\", \"Donesh Ferdowsi, 33, an architectural designer who lives in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, said that engaging with the installation helped him feel more connected to the earth. \\u201cTouching the dirt, holding the logs, putting my hand by the fire, it\\u2019s sort of this return to the elemental,\\u201d he said. \\u201cMy whole job is all in my head, so you forget that you\\u2019re not just a disembodied brain.\\u201d\", \"Ambient music helped set the tone. \\u201cI was trying to find tracks that can meet different moods,\\u201d said Ian Kim Judd, the night\\u2019s DJ. \\u201cThings that emanated a lot of light, things that also tend to have some darker edges underneath.\\u201d\", \"For Mr. Ferdowsi, the fact that the event fell on a Wednesday night, rather than on a weekend, was also significant. \\u201cIt\\u2019s incredible that it\\u2019s in the middle of the week because you can\\u2019t wait for the right time,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s in the middle of everything, and that\\u2019s how winter is. I wanted to be able to drop everything and go to something that touches on sacredness in a universal way.\\u201d\", \"Kelsa Trom, 33 who works with writers and lives in Ridgewood, agreed that the gathering was well timed. \\u201cWho doesn\\u2019t need a hug before another pandemic winter?\\u201d she said, as she waited for the sound bath and meditation to begin. \\u201cI\\u2019ve been to Nowadays as a club. I haven\\u2019t been here as a ritual space. It\\u2019s calmer, easier to speak and listen in.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Shofet said that the decision to host the event at a nightclub \\u2014 rather than at, say, a meditation center \\u2014 was intentional. \\u201cThe dance floor is a space that\\u2019s already charged with so much collective energy, it\\u2019s already used for this kind of communication with things outside of ourselves like music or other people,\\u201d she said. \\u201cOne of our big underlying goals and desires is to knit together contemporary clubbing and raving with environmental awareness.\\u201d\", \"Though attending a healing rave might not solve all of one\\u2019s anxieties, the sense of connectedness it may bring about can be beneficial, said Scott Hutson, a professor of anthropology at the University of Kentucky, who has researched the ways raves have helped foster spiritual transformations.\", \"\\u201cThe therapeutic rave experience comes precisely from being in community, in unity with others,\\u201d Mr. Hutson added. \\u201cThe ability to break down barriers between other people and yourself, to sort of be away from your own anxieties and your own ego, to basically unite and forge bonds with a whole crowd of people.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Trom refers to that as a \\u201cbeautiful anonymous intimacy.\\u201d \\u201cIt\\u2019s a feeling that is hard to come by in New York City, and maybe everywhere,\\u201d she said after the event. \\u201cIt felt like a gift.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"42bc42c45a6b11ecbe906fd414f47516"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"42bc42c45a6b11ecbe906fd414f47516"}},
