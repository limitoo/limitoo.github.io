However, despite that, the red and grey sleeping bag remains missing.\", \"It's considered a critical piece of evidence, featuring on a number of missing person posters that were plastered around Australia and online as police spent 18 days looking for Cleo.\", \"According to news.com.au, motorists travelling on the North West Coastal Highway in Western Australia have been asked to keep an eye out for the bag.\\u00a0\", \"Officers are currently still examining the house where Cleo was found, going through a number of items as well as 50 cubic metres of rubbish found in bins in the area. There was no sign of the sleeping bag at the Carnarvon house.\\u00a0\", \"Investigators rushed back to the property this week after Cleo said a woman would come to her alleged kidnapper's house to look after her by dressing her and brushing her hair.\\u00a0\", \"However, local Deputy Commissioner Col Blanch has ruled out a woman being involved. He would not though rule out a second person being linked to the case.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The investigation is ongoing, that's all I'll say at this time.\\\"\", \"When Kelly appeared before the Carnarvon Magistrates Court last week, he swore at media, saying \\\"I'm coming for you\\\" and \\\"why are they here?\\\".

Early in the morning, it was discovered that Cleo was not in her tent and her sleeping bag was missing. Her mother, Ellie, said Cleo wouldn't have left by herself and police agreed she had likely been abducted, noting the tent's zip was higher than she would have been able to reach.\", \"After an extensive search operation and pleas to the public for information - including a AUS$1 million reward - a tip-off prompted police to raid the Carnarvon property last Wednesday. Police Commissioner Chris Dawson described it as \\\"one of the most remarkable days in policing in Western Australia\\\".\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"5f43541c428f11ec8637d9481abd1e86"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5f43541c428f11ec8637d9481abd1e86"}},
