Al Sharpton spent a day observing the trial in the courtroom\\u2019s public gallery. On Monday, the Rev. Jesse L. Jackson came to the courtroom and sat between Mr. Arbery\\u2019s parents, prompting a second effort from Mr. Gough to ban the prominent civil rights leaders from the proceedings.\", \"\\u201cWhich pastor is next? Is Raphael Warnock going to be the next person appearing? We don\\u2019t know,\\u201d said Mr. Gough, referring to the Atlanta minister who was elected to the Senate this year. \\u201cYour honor, I would submit, with all respect to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, that this is no different than bringing in police officers or uniformed prison guards in a small town where a young Black man has been accused of assaulting a law enforcement officer or corrections officer.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gough\\u2019s statements have inspired a rally, scheduled for Thursday, in which more than 100 Black pastors are planning to join Mr. Sharpton and the Arbery family in forming a \\u201cwall of prayer\\u201d in front of the courthouse in Glynn County, Ga. In a statement announcing the rally, Mr. Sharpton said Mr. Gough\\u2019s words demonstrated \\u201cbasic bias \\u2014 the same bias that killed Ahmaud Arbery.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gough, in an interview with The New York Times last week, said he was trying to ensure a fair trial for his client.\", \"In recent days Judge Timothy R. Walmsley has rejected Mr. Gough\\u2019s request for a mistrial declaration, his call for a ban on Black preachers in court and a motion to have protesters moved away from the area directly outside the courthouse. The judge told Mr. Gough on Monday that some of his statements have been \\u201creprehensible,\\u201d specifically mentioning a moment last week when Mr. Gough wondered aloud what it would be like \\u201cif a bunch of folks came in here dressed like Colonel Sanders with white masks sitting in the back.\\u201d\", \"The failed effort to seek a mistrial was the most dramatic moment in the seventh day of testimony in the trial, which was mostly given over to interviews with investigators who handled forensic evidence in the case.\", \"Mr. Jackson spoke briefly Monday morning on the courthouse steps, his voice seemingly ravaged by Parkinson\\u2019s disease, the neurological disorder with which he announced he was afflicted in 2017. He called the fight over his presence a \\u201cdiversion\\u201d in a case he compared to that of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old murdered by white Mississippians in 1955. Mr. Jackson also spoke of a \\u201cdecency factor\\u201d in the South, and said he sensed a \\u201cstreak of fairness\\u201d in the jury.\", \"Mr. Gough had previously called for a mistrial. But the fact that he was joined in his effort on Monday by lawyers for the two other defendants, Travis McMichael and his father, Gregory, demonstrates how widespread the skepticism has become over whether this trial can be considered fair. Those doubts have been loudly voiced by supporters of Mr. Arbery, who have noted that the jury hearing the case is made up of 11 white people and one Black person, even though Glynn County is about 27 percent Black.\", \"Jason Sheffield, a lawyer for the younger Mr. McMichael, said on Monday that he was \\u201cconstrained to join\\u201d in calling for a mistrial. He referred to a moment on Monday morning when Mr. Arbery\\u2019s mother, Wanda Cooper-Jones, burst out in sobs after her son\\u2019s photo was shown to the jury. Mr. Sheffield said several jurors looked toward Ms. Cooper-Jones sympathetically, and in so doing also saw Mr. Jackson, whom Mr. Sheffield referred to as \\u201cthe ultimate figure of fairness and justice and equality.\\u201d\", \"In moving for a mistrial, Franklin J. Hogue, a lawyer for Gregory McMichael, said he disagreed with some statements that Judge Walmsley made this month as he ruled on the composition of the jury. The judge said at the time that there had been an appearance of \\u201cintentional discrimination\\u201d when the defense moved to reject several Black people during jury selection.\", \"The comments, Mr. Hogue said, have \\u201ccontinued the difficulty we have had from the beginning in trying to determine, is this the right venue for this case?\\u201d\", \"After the jury was dismissed in the afternoon, Mr. Gough told Judge Walmsley that he had hoped to \\u201chear back from the court\\u201d over remarks he made this morning.\", \"\\u201cOn what?\\u201d the judge replied, tartly. \\u201cI\\u2019m confused \\u2014 what are you waiting for, Mr. Gough?\\u201d\", \"Mr. Gough backed off.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re in recess,\\u201d the judge said.\"]","href_hash":"59d98bc4467a11ec92ec816ff41676be"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"59d98bc4467a11ec92ec816ff41676be"}},
