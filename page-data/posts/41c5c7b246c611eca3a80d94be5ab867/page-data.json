And the simple truth about the last year of the Trump presidency is that his lies turned deadly and shook the foundations of our democracy.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBetrayal\\u201d is presented as an inside look at what happened in the last months of the Trump White House, beginning on Feb. 10, 2020. At the time, news about a novel coronavirus in China was percolating throughout the United States, but staffers in the White House seemed more immediately threatened by Johnny McEntee, a 29-year-old former college quarterback who went from carrying President Trump\\u2019s bags to becoming the director of the Presidential Personnel Office \\u2014 \\u201cresponsible for the hiring and firing of more than 4,000 political appointees across the federal government.\\u201d\", \"McEntee saw it as his duty to purge from the executive branch anyone deemed insufficiently loyal to the president; less than a year later, on Jan. 1, McEntee would send a text message to Mike Pence\\u2019s chief of staff insisting that the vice president had the authority to overturn the results of the November election. He pointed speciously to an episode involving Thomas Jefferson as an example.\", \"The full (and absurd) text of the memo is one of several scoops Karl offers in this book, along with another memo from McEntee\\u2019s office, sent less than a month before the election, outlining why Defense Secretary Mark Esper should be fired. (Esper\\u2019s supposed transgressions included focusing the department on Russia and \\u201cactively pushing for \\u2018diversity and inclusion.\\u2019\\u201d) Karl also says that Trump threatened to create his own political party, backing down only when Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, countered by threatening to give away the valuable email list of his 40 million supporters for free \\u2014 \\u201ceffectively making it impossible for Trump to make money by renting it out.\\u201d\", \"McDaniel and Trump have since denied any such standoff \\u2014 Trump even denied it to Karl\\u2019s face, in one of the last interviews he granted for \\u201cBetrayal.\\u201d During the same interview, Trump reminisced about the speech he gave on Jan. 6, 2021, shortly before the attack on the Capitol, calling it \\u201ca very beautiful time with extremely loving and friendly people.\\u201d Karl, at least inwardly, was aghast. \\u201cI was taken aback by how fondly he remembers a day I will always remember as one of the darkest I have ever witnessed,\\u201d he writes, adding that Trump seemed to justify the death threats made against his own vice president. \\u201cIt boggled my mind,\\u201d Karl says.\", \"It did? The author\\u2019s expressions of surprise are so frequent and over-the-top that they are perhaps the most surprising parts of this book. \\u201cBetrayal\\u201d is less insightful about the Trump White House and more revealing of Karl\\u2019s own gradual, extremely belated awareness that something in the White House might in fact be awry. Events strike him as \\u201cwacky,\\u201d \\u201ccrazy,\\u201d \\u201cnuts.\\u201d He delves into the outlandish conspiracy theories around the presidential election, earnestly explaining why each of them is wrong. He scores a number of on-the-record interviews with Trumpworld insiders \\u2014 nearly all of whom insist that even as they publicly sided with Trump, they were bravely telling the president some very tough truths in private.\", \"Karl recalls Sept. 10, 2020, as a turning point for him: the day he asked \\u201cthe most forcefully confrontational question I had ever asked of a president \\u2014 or any other political leader.\\u201d By that point Trump had been playing down the pandemic for half a year, insisting the coronavirus \\u201caffects virtually no one.\\u201d Karl, who until that moment had \\u201ccringed\\u201d when he heard other reporters use the word \\u201clie,\\u201d was sitting in his front-row seat at a briefing and moved to press Trump: \\u201cWhy did you lie to the American people, and why should we trust anything you have to say now?\\u201d\", \"It was a good question, though it simply got turned, like so many exchanges during those briefings, into more Trump theater, with the president scowling and calling Karl \\u201ca disgrace to the ABC television network.\\u201d You also wonder how Karl, who mentions in his previous book that George W. Bush took the country to war with Iraq under false pretenses, had spent two decades covering politics without asking anything so \\u201cforcefully confrontational\\u201d before. \\u201cFront Row\\u201d includes a conversation in which Karl informed Trump that calling the press \\u201cthe enemy of the people\\u201d was perhaps dangerous: \\u201c\\u2018Some sick person might take your words to heart,\\u2019 I told him. \\u2018I hope people take my words to heart,\\u2019 he said, missing the point that I was warning of possible violence against journalists.\\u201d\", \"Or perhaps it wasn\\u2019t Trump who was missing the point of that exchange \\u2014 something that didn\\u2019t seem to occur to Karl, apparently so entrenched in his establishmentarian assumptions that until very recently he deemed certain distressing possibilities simply unfathomable. More than a year before the 2020 election, Karl asked John Kelly, Trump\\u2019s former chief of staff, what would happen if Trump lost and refused to concede. Kelly was sure that Trump would leave \\u2014 and \\u201cif he tried to chain himself\\u201d to his Oval Office desk, \\u201cthey would simply cut the chains and carry him out.\\u201d\", \"Karl recalls being impressed by Kelly\\u2019s tone of confident authority. \\u201cI didn\\u2019t ask any more questions, but I still had a few,\\u201d he writes \\u2014 a strange admission for the chief Washington correspondent of a major network. \\u201cThe scenario described by John Kelly seemed too disturbing \\u2014 and too absurd \\u2014 to consider any further. I tried not to think about it again.\\u201d\", \"The Trump era blew a hole through all kinds of institutional norms and presuppositions, revealing vulnerabilities and blind spots. It probably speaks to Karl\\u2019s decency as a person that he didn\\u2019t want to contemplate anything so terrible, but for all the high-minded talk in his books about the journalistic pursuit of accuracy, he gives little indication that he had the imagination to handle the truth.\"]","href_hash":"41c5c7b246c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"41c5c7b246c611eca3a80d94be5ab867"}},
