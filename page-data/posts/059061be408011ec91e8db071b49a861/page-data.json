Here’s how she got the shot.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-08T02:39:05.000Z","content":"[\"An article published in The New York Times\\u2019s Arts section last week, \\u201cA \\u2018Conceptual Artist\\u2019 at Work,\\u201d explores the life, artistry and new book of the photographer Annie Leibovitz. The portraits of Ms. Leibovitz that accompany the article, shot by the photographer Gillian Laub, are just as illuminating: Intimate and inviting, the photos capture the vulnerable, often unseen side of a person who is normally behind the camera.In an interview, Ms. Laubshared her experience photographing Ms. Leibovitz \\u2014 and what is so uniquely challenging, slightly intimidating and deeply rewarding about working with somebody renowned in their shared field. Her responses have been lightly edited and condensed.\", \"How were you feeling heading into this assignment?It was a true honor to receive this commission. But along with the excitement was a ton of nerves. The task of making a portrait of a photographic and portrait legend was daunting, to say the least. But it was also really exciting.\", \"Did you approach the assignment differently from a normal shoot?My approach doesn\\u2019t change; it\\u2019s not determined by who I\\u2019m photographing. I always approach every shoot with an open mind and an open heart. There\\u2019s some planning involved, of course, but I like to let there be enough room for discovery and spontaneity.\", \"What are the greatest challenges in photographing a photographer?There\\u2019s a level of self-consciousness and awareness of the camera that\\u2019s unique to photographing another photographer. It felt like we were both sympathetic to the other because I think she knew how intimidating it is for somebody to photograph her. And I recognize that someone who\\u2019s always behind the camera, like Annie, is rarely in front of the camera. \", \"The first portrait we did was in Annie\\u2019s kitchen. She was so sweet; she felt so bad because the light was tricky, and she said she\\u2019s never been able to make a great picture in her kitchen. So we were actually trying to problem-solve it together.\", \"How do you help your subjects feel comfortable enough to open up?There\\u2019s no formula. I always want to learn about what makes each of us unique and special. When I talked to Annie before the shoot, and she asked where I\\u2019d like to do it, there was no question I wanted to do it at her home in Rhinebeck. I\\u2019d seen many images of her at work and in the studio, and that\\u2019s really the Annie that we\\u2019ve seen publicly. \", \"Vulnerability is really about trust. And we\\u2019re all vulnerable, so it\\u2019s really the one thing that connects us all. How to capture it? Well, that\\u2019s in the magic that\\u2019s photography. That\\u2019s what\\u2019s exciting for me.\", \"When your subject is a photographer, does the relationship between you and the subject become more important?Yes. It was everything that I had hoped for and more, because it felt collaborative. In fact, one of the photographs I wanted to make was at her pond. It was so clear by how she described her pond that it was a very, very special place to her and her family. Unfortunately, when we got to the pond by the end of the day, the light wasn\\u2019t great. She was so excited to show me the photograph that she took of the pond that morning. It was this magical, mystical photograph. She said: \\u201cI\\u2019m not showing it to you to show off. You have to see how beautiful it looks.\\u201d She knew that it killed me that it wouldn\\u2019t be possible for me to make that photo there. So Annie offered for me to come back in the morning to capture the light. She had a family birthday party to go to very early, but she so respected the creative process that she offered that. So I woke up at 3:30 in the morning to drive back to Rhinebeck to make that portrait. It wasn\\u2019t very convenient for her, so I was really grateful that she was so generous to offer that.\", \"What was the biggest thing you learned or took away from the shoot?I\\u2019ve always heard how meticulous and thorough Annie is about the research she does before her shoots, so to get a window into that and her creative process was pretty amazing. I laughed when I saw her desk, because there was a big file on me and many printouts of my work, Google images, articles on me and my recent book. I had every one of her books \\u2014 I brought very heavy bags filled with her books so she could sign them.\"]","href_hash":"059061be408011ec91e8db071b49a861"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"059061be408011ec91e8db071b49a861"}},
