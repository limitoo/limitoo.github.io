Firefighters responding to the blaze went door to door checking each unit, eventually finding a 32-year-old man and his 6-year-old son, Aiden Hayward, passed out in a hallway.\", \"The boy later died from smoke inhalation after being taken to a nearby hospital, where he stayed throughout Saturday. As of Sunday, the father was still receiving treatment. The cause of the blaze has not yet been determined.\", \"Resident Alberto Revilla's dog, Loki, also perished in the fire. Revilla had left the building to get food prior to the fire breaking out. Once he was let back in, he found that firefighters had broken his lock to his apartment and found Loki dead on the floor. To make matters worse, Revilla reported seeing two burglars ransacking his apartment on a live security feed.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1928185/bronx-fire-thieves.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">After an apartment building caught fire in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx, a resident reported seeing thieves ransack his home.

On top of everything, Revilla said that they are struggling to explain their dog's death to their young daughter. The beloved pet had only been with them for a year.\", \"\\\"She's 4 years old and she's been asking for him,\\\" Revilla said. \\\"I don't know how to tell her.\\\"\", \"Revilla's family were not the only residents to be burglarized in the wake of the Mott Haven blaze. Shaar Wright, who lives on the 10th floor, also found numerous valuables missing from her unit, including televisions, video games and jewelry.\", \"\\\"I realized everything is missing,\\\" Wright told NBC New York. \\\"I come home to nothing. It's like I worked for nothing. My husband worked for nothing. I made a beautiful home for my kids for nothing.
