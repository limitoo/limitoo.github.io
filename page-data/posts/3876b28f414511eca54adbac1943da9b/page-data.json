Elinor Hanson, a former model who is desperate to break into journalism, is on a plane bound for North Dakota, where she\\u2019s researching a story about how the oil boom has changed the landscape where she grew up. She\\u2019s jittery, nervous and wants to sleep, but her salesman seatmate is in the mood to schmooze. She rebuffs his cringe-inducing advances and he becomes miffed, then petulant. \\u201cI was only making conversation,\\u201d he says. \\u201cDon\\u2019t flatter yourself. You\\u2019re not my type.\\u201d\", \"When Elinor falls asleep, he does not stay on his side of the armrest. Welcome to the intersection of fear and trying to be polite, where a little red light of panic will blink in your peripheral vision for the duration of this novel.\", \"Yun\\u2019s Mack truck of a story transports us to Avery, N.D., \\u201cwhere thousands of itinerant oil workers from recession-ravaged parts of the country\\u201d have descended \\u201cupon a town of 4,000 that was unprepared to take them in.\\u201d Elinor\\u2019s hotel is booked to the hilt. The local watering hole has a fraternity-basement vibe, with an air of desperation hanging over its mostly male clientele. Every resource \\u2014 food, decency, kindness, peace, even air \\u2014 is in short supply. Yun creates such a sense of claustrophobia, it\\u2019s as if the sky has been cranked down a few notches.\", \"Elinor is in the area on behalf of the Standard, a Very Important Magazine, completing an assignment that was originally intended for her former professor and love interest, Richard, who has been waylaid by hip surgery. At his recommendation, she has been dispatched to conduct previously scheduled interviews and tell the story he envisioned: a postcard from a place altered by greed, desperation and competing interests.\", \"But there\\u2019s more to the oil boom than meets the eye, and Elinor is well positioned to make sense of it. She\\u2019s both insider and outsider, having grown up on a nearby Air Force base as the daughter of an American officer and a Korean woman (who eventually bolted, leaving Elinor and her sister with their father). Yun writes, \\u201cFor as long as she can remember, people have been pushing her out of one circle or another, making her feel less American, less Korean, and now even less North Dakotan than she thinks she is.\\u201d\", \"Elinor follows her instincts, paying close attention to the women she meets along the way. There\\u2019s the widow whose husband sold mineral rights to their land so he could pay his medical bills; now she can\\u2019t drink the tap water in her own home. There\\u2019s the club dancer living in a parking lot with her abusive boyfriend, the bartender who\\u2019s seen it all and Elinor\\u2019s sister, Maren, whose attempts to reconnect come with a slimy ulterior motive. Oddly, Elinor\\u2019s ties to strangers feel stronger than the slack connection she shares with her own flesh and blood.\", \"The loudest voices in \\u201cO Beautiful\\u201d are the ones we never hear. They\\u2019re the perspectives and experiences of women who have disappeared: 27-year-old blond, blue-eyed Leanne Lowell, last seen jogging eastbound on Rural Route 1; and the 28 women, teenagers and girls (\\u201ca figure that\\u2019s both shockingly high and surely an undercount\\u201d) from the Mahua tribe who have been reported missing over a period of two years.\", \"When Elinor turns her attention to their stories, her article \\u2014 and her future as a woman of words \\u2014 begins to take shape.\", \"\\u201cNomadland,\\u201d by Jessica Bruder. This is the book that inspired the movie starring Frances McDormand (worth watching, if you haven\\u2019t already). Bruder follows an ever-growing community of older people who move, as she puts it, \\u201clike blood cells through the veins of the country,\\u201d living out of Jeeps, campers and repurposed buses as they chase seasonal jobs.\", \"\\u201cAmity and Prosperity,\\u201d by Eliza Griswold. It takes a writer who is both a journalist and a poet to muster the scientific knowledge and the sensitivity that Griswold brings to the subject of fracking in this evenhanded account. \\u201cAmity and Prosperity\\u201d is, as our critic wrote, \\u201cneither an outraged sermon delivered from a populist soapbox nor a pinched, professorial lecture.\\u201d Two communities are cracked open.
