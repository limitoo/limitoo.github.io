Mr. Nosey is minding everyone else\\u2019s business. Little Miss Curious asks a lot of questions. There are nearly 100 characters, each with a self-titled children\\u2019s book in which his or her defining feature causes a bit of a predicament. By the end, however, they learn the error of their ways. And so do the children reading along.\", \"This year marks the 50th anniversary of the publication of the first book in the series, \\u201cMr. Tickle,\\u201d which the author, Roger Hargreaves, wrote and illustrated after his 8-year-old son Adam asked what a tickle looked like. Hargreaves, a British copywriter, continued to invent characters, developing their signature look \\u2014 brightly colored minimalist figures, drawn against simple backgrounds \\u2014 and winding up with 43 Mr. Men, 21 Little Miss characters and a thriving publishing brand before he died of complications from a stroke in 1988.\", \"Adam Hargreaves, 25 when his father died, took over the business and, after years of practice, adopted his father\\u2019s style. He has now created 13 characters and written and illustrated 150 titles, including ones with fairy tale, travel and holiday themes. Today, over 250 million books have been sold in over 28 countries, according to Sanrio, the Japanese company best known for Hello Kitty, which bought the brand in 2011. The books have been translated into 17 languages, including French, Hebrew and Korean.\", \"According to Adam Hargreaves, the popularity of the books stems from the clean look and clear messages that his father had a knack for because of his advertising career.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s all got to be quick and snappy. An idea\\u2019s got to be instantly understood,\\u201d he said in a video interview from his studio in a 19th-century stable next to his home in Sussex, England. \\u201cSo I think he transferred some of that ideology into how he wrote Mr. Men, and how he drew them as well. They\\u2019re kind of instantly recognizable.\\u201d\", \"The books, published in Britain by Farshore, a division of HarperCollins, and in the United States by Penguin Random House, quickly led to other media and merchandising. A cartoon series ran on the BBC for 10 years starting in 1974, which helped solidify Mr. Men and Little Miss in British pop culture. Under Roger Hargreaves, items like Mr. Bump bandages and Mr. Greedy sweets were introduced.\", \"Silvia Figini, a Sanrio executive who oversees the Mr. Men Little Miss brand, said that Sanrio was drawn to it because it fits with the \\u201ckawaii\\u201d cuteness aesthetic personified in Hello Kitty.\", \"Under Sanrio, Mr. Men Little Miss collaborations and licensing agreements have grown to encompass fashion, fast food and luxury goods. There are Mr. Happy and Little Miss Fabulous hoodies by the French fashion house Sandro, perfume by the fragrance company Adopt and kidswear emblazoned with Mr. Bump, Little Miss Sunshine and others at Tesco, the British retail chain. Earlier this year, in honor of the anniversary, McDonald\\u2019s offered Mr. Men Little Miss-themed Happy Meals.\", \"The series holds nostalgic appeal for some of the Gen Xers and millennials who grew up with it. In 2016, the fashion designer Stella McCartney approached Hargreaves to Little Miss-ify her in a book and later developed a line of children\\u2019s clothes inspired by Little Miss Stella. The Spice Girls starred in their own individual books in 2019, the same year that Adam Hargreaves created a Doctor Who collection featuring the characters from the sci-fi series rendered in Mr. Men style. Hargreaves continues to write and illustrate titles, including \\u201cMr. Bolt,\\u201d inspired by the track star Usain Bolt, which was published in November.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019re like Pop Art in a way. They really can be easily elevated because of their simplicity and their iconic look,\\u201d said the children\\u2019s book author and illustrator Jay Cooper. \\u201cThey\\u2019ve got thick lines and simple colors \\u2014 there\\u2019s no primary thing you\\u2019re supposed to be looking at and no secondary thing. It\\u2019s all one thing, like a piece of Lichtenstein artwork.\\u201d\", \"The books\\u2019 merits go further than their visual appeal. According to children\\u2019s book experts, the key to their longevity is the straightforward way the characters personify emotion and behavior, which helps children learn and understand themselves.\", \"\\u201cA parent is going to say: \\u2018My child is being kind of greedy. I\\u2019m going to read him this little book that has a lesson that\\u2019s gentle.\\u2019 They\\u2019re not didactic books,\\u201d said Cecilia McGowan, a former children\\u2019s librarian and past president of the Association for Library Service to Children, a division of the American Library Association. \\u201cI see them as interactive books. They\\u2019re meant to be read to a child and when you\\u2019re reading it, you\\u2019re explaining it, there\\u2019s a conversation between the adult and the child going on.\\u201d\", \"But the books have drawn some criticism for how they pair different behaviors or traits to a \\u201cmister\\u201d or a \\u201clittle miss.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI remember them as sweet little funny books, and they certainly reflect the lives of the child who\\u2019s reading it or the parent reading it to them, but it really is so gendered,\\u201d said Lisa Von Drasek, the curator of the Kerlan Collection of Children\\u2019s Literature at the University of Minnesota. \\u201cThe gendered girlie stuff for Little Miss and the gendered masculine stuff for Mr. Men all could be Mx. You could have girlie Mx and masculine Mx. What better way to celebrate than reflect present day and include all children?\\u201d\", \"In a possible nod to such concerns, Little Miss Inventor, an engineer, was introduced in 2018. Earlier this year, an online contest was held to name new characters, and Mr. Calm and Little Miss Brave won. Their books were published in September.\", \"\\u201cLittle Miss Brave and Mr. Calm are not necessarily stereotypes,\\u201d said Casey Nugent, an associate publishing manager at Penguin Random House, the series\\u2019 U.S. publisher. \\u201cIt\\u2019s saying girls can be brave and strong, and boys can relax and be meditative. There\\u2019s a growing tradition in these books to buck standards as time goes on.\\u201d\", \"In October, Endeavor Content, the production arm of the entertainment and sports conglomerate Endeavor, struck a deal with Sanrio to create a Mr. Men Little Miss television series.\", \"\\u201cThe events of the last two years have really highlighted for us how young children, now more than ever, need a way to better understand themselves and their feelings,\\u201d said Tamara Rothenberg, a senior vice president at Endeavor. \\u201cWe see Mr. Men Little Miss as an absolutely incredible way to facilitate that understanding and conversation though a fun and playful brand.\\u201d\", \"Adam Hargreaves keeps the original \\u201cMr. Tickle\\u201d boxed in a drawer in his studio. It\\u2019s written with Magic Marker on cardboard, the same size as the books today, and bound with gaffer tape. Of all the characters in the series, he said, his father is best embodied by Mr. Silly.\", \"\\u201cIf you have a character like Mr. Grumpy or Little Miss Naughty, there\\u2019s a comeuppance at the end. There\\u2019s sort of a small moral or lesson learned from the book, but I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s the principal driving idea behind them,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s about entertaining and amusing children.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9c421f99580f11eca8558baf2e88c715"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9c421f99580f11eca8558baf2e88c715"}},
