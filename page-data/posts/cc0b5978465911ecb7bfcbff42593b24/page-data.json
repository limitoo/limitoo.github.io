It is clear, from here on the front line, that Alabama's judiciary has unequivocally been hijacked by partisan interests and unlawful legislative neglect.\\\"\", \"The complaint against Todd said she went too far.\", \"\\\"Despite her arguable intent to accomplish what she perceived as noble purposes, [for example] elimination of the death penalty [at least in its current form], of selective prosecution, of racial discrimination in imprisonment, etc., her intent to achieve a noble purpose does not excuse apparent disregard of the law or her failure to maintain competence in the law,\\\" judicial prosecutors charged.\"]","href_hash":"cc0b5978465911ecb7bfcbff42593b24"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cc0b5978465911ecb7bfcbff42593b24"}},
