I was really fortunate to be able to grab a spot.\\\"\", \"But the stress and uncertainty paid off for the 32-year-old, who feels she's returned an improved player and leader.\", \"\\\"It was huge for me. As a captain, I certainly took a lot of learnings away from it, being able to lead a team through a really tough competition and then to be able to perform at crunch time in front of 15,500 people.\\\"\", \"\\\"I think it will hopefully hold me in really good stead in terms of being able to stay calm under pressure.
