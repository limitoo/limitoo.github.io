Even as his project widened fissures in the bloc, his fellow national leaders mostly looked the other way, committed to staying out of one another\\u2019s affairs.\", \"But now Mr. Orban\\u2019s defiance and intransigence has had an important, if unintended, effect: serving as a catalyst for an often-sluggish European Union system to act to safeguard the democratic principles that are the foundation of the bloc.\", \"Early this year, the European Court of Justice will issue a landmark decision on whether the union has the authority to make its funds to member states conditional on meeting the bloc\\u2019s core values. Doing so would allow Brussels to deny billions of euros to countries that violate those values.\", \"The bloc has consistently worked on political consensus among national leaders. But Mr. Orban has pushed Brussels toward a threshold it had long avoided: making membership subject to financial punishments, not merely political ones.\", \"The new frontier could help solve an old problem \\u2014 what to do about bad actors in its ranks \\u2014 while creating new ones. Not least, it could invite the European Commission, the bloc\\u2019s executive branch, to exercise a new level of interference in the affairs of member states.\", \"How Mr. Orban has forced the European Union to such a juncture, and why it seemed helpless to stop him for so long, says much about the bloc\\u2019s founding assumptions and why it has stumbled in the face of populist and nationalist challenges.\", \"Interviews with over a dozen current and former European officials show how sentiments toward Mr. Orban and his illiberal project evolved from complacency and incomprehension to a recognition that he had become a serious internal threat \\u2014 despite Hungary\\u2019s having fewer people than Paris and a language so esoteric that it bears no relationship to those of its neighbors.\", \"The willful neglect was encapsulated neatly in 2015 at a meeting, when Jean-Claude Juncker, then the European Commission\\u2019s president, saw Mr. Orban arriving and said, \\u201cThe dictator is coming,\\u201d before greeting him with \\u201cdictator,\\u201d and giving him a friendly pat on the face.\", \"No one in power wanted to confront Mr. Orban over issues like rule of law and corruption \\u2014 especially not his fellow national leaders, who each have a seat on the powerful European Council.\", \"\\u201cAt the council myself I felt the reluctance of Orban\\u2019s peers to deal with these kind of issues,\\u201d said Luuk van Middelaar, an aide to Herman Van Rompuy when he was council president. He added that the council was \\u201clike a club, where Viktor is just one of them \\u2014 and they are political animals, and they respect each other for the simple fact of having won an election.\\u201d\", \"The leaders \\u201cprefer not to deal with hot potatoes or each other\\u2019s business when they can avoid it,\\u201d Mr. van Middelaar said.\", \"Some European lawmakers recognized early on that Mr. Orban was trampling on democratic norms but were stymied by national leaders, particularly those from the European People\\u2019s Party, the powerful center-right political grouping that has dominated the European Parliament for the past decade.\", \"Among those conservatives who protected Mr. Orban was Angela Merkel, the chancellor of Germany at the time. German companies had major investments in Hungary, and Ms. Merkel saw the Hungarian leader as a political ally in Brussels. One prominent member of the European People\\u2019s Party said Ms. Merkel and her aides brushed off complaints about Mr. Orban, saying that he could be difficult, but that it was important to keep him in the family.\", \"\\u201cThe biggest failing \\u2014 the one that we are still paying the price for today \\u2014 is the European Council,\\u201d said Rui Tavares, a former European legislator who helped write a report on Hungary\\u2019s violations adopted in 2013. \\u201cThe European Council did nothing.\\u201d\", \"When Mr. Orban proposed \\u2014 and later introduced \\u2014 a new Constitution that violated European principles, Didier Reynders, then Belgium\\u2019s minister of foreign and European affairs, said he tried to raise the problem in a meeting with E.U. leaders in 2011 but was shut down.\", \"\\u201cThe reaction was that this is not an issue for the member states,\\u201d said Mr. Reynders, who is now the E.U. commissioner for justice, adding that \\u201cmaybe the commission, maybe the court\\u201d should deal with it.\", \"\\u201cBut now it\\u2019s a permanent discussion,\\u201d he said.\", \"Ivan Krastev, a Bulgarian analyst of Europe, said Mr. Orban was careful for several years after his election in 2010 \\u201cnot to cross Brussels\\u2019s red lines but to dance along them in what he called \\u2018the peacock dance.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Mr. Krastev said many European leaders assumed that the nations that joined the bloc in 2004 would be grateful, relatively compliant partners and miscalculated how \\u201ccountries like Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic felt later that you have to assert your own identity and reject Brussels to differing degrees.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Orban\\u2019s party adopted the new Constitution and a new media law that curbed press freedom. It overhauled the country\\u2019s justice system, removed the head of its Supreme Court and created an office to oversee the courts led by the wife of a prominent member of the governing party, Fidesz. Election laws were changed to favor the party.\", \"External factors strengthened Mr. Orban as well, including in 2015 when a record number of migrants made their way to Europe and when the right-wing Law and Justice party of Jaroslaw Kaczynski came to power in Poland. He suddenly had an ally there, and his tough stance against migrants won him support elsewhere, too.\", \"\\u201cWhat liberated Orban was 2015 and the migration crisis,\\u201d said Mark Leonard, the director of the European Council on Foreign Relations. \\u201cHe was suddenly standing for more than Hungary but for wider issues of migration, with support in Germany and Austria and the other Central European states, and that gave him power.\\u201d\", \"A sharper inflection point came in May 2018 at a meeting between Mr. Orban and the leaders of the European People\\u2019s Party: Joseph Daul, the party president, and Manfred Weber, the German Christian Democrat who ran Parliament.\", \"They warned him that his party risked being expelled from the parliamentary grouping. Fresh from another electoral victory the month before, Mr. Orban \\u201cfelt he was on steroids\\u201d and struck back, according to an official who was immediately briefed about the meeting.\", \"\\u201cIf you try to kick me out, I\\u2019ll destroy you,\\u201d Mr. Orban said, according to the official.\", \"It would take 10 months before Fidesz would be suspended. Two years after that, in March, Mr. Orban quit the conservative alliance when it became clear that it was going to oust his party.\", \"Mr. Weber still regrets the loss of Fidesz. \\u201cOn one level, it is a relief,\\u201d he said. \\u201cBut Orban leaving is not a victory, but a defeat\\u201d in the effort to hold the center-right together as \\u201ca broad people\\u2019s party.\\u201d\", \"It has helped Mr. Orban that the European Union has few and ineffective instruments for punishing a backsliding nation. Even the Lisbon Treaty, which gave enhanced powers to the European Parliament, has essentially one unusable tool: Article 7, which can remove a country\\u2019s voting rights, but only if passed by unanimity.\", \"In 2017, Frans Timmermans, then the European Commission first vice president responsible for the rule of law, initiated the article against Poland. The European Parliament did the same against Hungary in 2018.\", \"But both measures inevitably stalled because the two countries protect each other.\", \"The treaty also allows the commission to bring infringement procedures \\u2014 legal charges \\u2014 against member states for violating E.U. law. But the process is slow, involving letters and responses and appeals, and final decisions are up to the European Court of Justice. Most cases are settled before reaching the court.\", \"But according to studies by R. Daniel Kelemen of Rutgers University and Tommaso Pavone of the University of Oslo, the commission sharply reduced infringement cases after the addition of new member states in 2004. Jos\\u00e9 Manuel Barroso, a former commission president, \\u201cbought into this to work more cooperatively with governments and not just sue them,\\u201d Mr. Kelemen said. Mr. Barroso declined to comment.\", \"Attitudes have shifted. With taxpayer money at stake, the next seven-year budget in the balance and the disregard for shared values shown by Mr. Orban and Mr. Kaczynski on leaders\\u2019 minds, Brussels may have finally found a useful tool to affect domestic politics, with a mix of lawsuits charging infringement of European treaties combined with severe financial consequences.\", \"A marker has finally been laid down, Mr. Reynders said.\", \"The big moment comes this month, when the European Court of Justice issues its ruling.\", \"If Hungary and Poland lose the case, as expected, it is unclear what will happen if both countries simply refuse to comply. The European Union will be thrust deeper into unknown territory.\"]","href_hash":"6a9eb6fb6c7c11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6a9eb6fb6c7c11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
