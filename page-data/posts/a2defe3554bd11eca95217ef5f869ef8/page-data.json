County since Oct. 3, SCAQMD said, according to NBC Los Angeles. There were times when they reached 100 complaints a day.\", \"The situation was declared a local emergency by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors the previous month. This resulted in the Department of Health going door-to-door to over 8,900 Carson residents. The Department of Public Works even gave or reimbursed residents for air purifiers, air filters, and temporary relocation, totaling around $5.4 million in costs.\", \"The stench is because of a fire that started Sept. 30, SCAQMD said. The district said it was at a warehouse in Carson where two companies kept a lot of wellness and beauty products. The fire, which burned over several days, caused the chemicals from the products, like ethanol, to leak into the channel from the sewer system, said SCAQMD.\", \"The leakage caused organic materials in the channel to decay, as well allowing for high amounts of hydrogen sulfide to be deposited in the air.\", \"Rep. Nanette Barrag\\u00e1n had originally called attention to the problem, saying it was an \\\"issue of health and environmental injustice,\\\" The Los Angeles Times reported. She asked Gov. Gavin Newsom to declare the stench a state of emergency on Oct. 18.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below. \", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945511/dominguez-channel-smell-complaints-violation-notices.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The stench in from the Dominguez Channel was declared a local emergency by Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors in November.
