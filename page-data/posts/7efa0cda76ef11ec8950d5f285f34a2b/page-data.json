One of the tricky things about tsunamis is that they happen very infrequently; think about the Japanese tsunami and its predecessor was over 1000 years beforehand.\", \"\\\"We haven't seen very many volcanic tsunamis. We've certainly never seen a volcanic tsunami that has affected the entire Pacific in this way.\\\"\", \"Lane said the only similar volcanic tsunami event was Indonesia's Krakatau eruption in 1883, which killed tens of thousands of people and obliterated the island.\", \"Atmosphere pressure disturbances from the volcano saw sea level disturbances recorded across the Pacific afterwards, including in New Zealand, where tsunami waves higher than one metre above sea level were recorded in areas including Warkworth and the upper reaches of Waitemata harbour.\", \"\\\"Tsunami scientists are literally going, 'Wow', about this,\\\" Lane said.\", \"RNZ\"]","href_hash":"7efa0cda76ef11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7efa0cda76ef11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
