A similar case out of Maine ended the same way in October. \", \"The court does not typically include explanations with rulings on emergency applications like the one from the New York City teachers, and Justice Sotomayor did not offer one on Friday.\"]","href_hash":"73c315448cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"73c315448cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}},
