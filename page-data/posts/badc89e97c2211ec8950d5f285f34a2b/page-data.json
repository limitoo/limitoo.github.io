It was a new start.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-01-23T00:03:47.000Z","content":"[\"PHOENIX \\u2014 There were moments when Paul Davis questioned his decision to join the crowd that marched on the United States Capitol last January. When he was publicly identified and fired from his job as a lawyer. When his fianc\\u00e9e walked out.\", \"But then something shifted. Instead of lingering as an indelible stain, Jan. 6 became a galvanizing new beginning for Mr. Davis. He started his own law practice as a \\u201clawyer for patriots\\u201d representing anti-vaccine workers. He began attending local conservative meetings around his hometown, Frisco, Texas. As the national horror over the Capitol attack calcified into another fault line of bitter division, Mr. Davis said his status as a Jan. 6 attendee had become \\u201ca badge of honor\\u201d with fellow conservatives.\", \"\\u201cIt definitely activated me more,\\u201d said Mr. Davis, who posted a video of himself in front of a line of police officers outside the Capitol but said he did not enter the building and was expressing his constitutional rights to protest. He has not been charged with any crime from that day. \\u201cIt gave me street cred.\\u201d\", \"The post-mortems and prosecutions that followed that infamous day have focused largely on the violent core of the mob. But a larger group has received far less attention: the thousands who traveled to Washington at the behest of Mr. Trump to protest the results of a democratic election, the vast majority of whom did not set foot in the Capitol and have not been charged with any crime \\u2014 who simply went home.\", \"For these Donald Trump supporters, the next chapter of Jan. 6 is not the ashes of a disgraced insurrection, but an amorphous new movement fueled by grievances against vaccines and President Biden, and a deepened devotion to his predecessor\\u2019s lies about a stolen election.\", \"\", \"\", \"In the year since the attack, many have plunged into new fights and new conspiracy theories sown in the bloody chaos of that day. They have organized efforts to raise money for the people charged in the Capitol attack, casting them as political prisoners. Some are speaking at conservative rallies. Others are running for office.\", \"Interviews with a dozen people who were in the large mass of marchers show that the worst attack on American democracy in generations has mutated into an emblem of resistance. Those interviewed are just a fraction of the thousands who attended the rally, but their reflections present a troubling omen should the country face another close presidential election.\", \"Many Jan. 6 attendees have shifted their focus to what they see as a new, urgent threat: Covid-19 vaccine mandates and what they call efforts by Democratic politicians to control their bodies. They cite Mr. Biden\\u2019s vaccine mandates as justification for their efforts to block his presidency.\", \"Some bridled at Trump\\u2019s recent, full-throated endorsements of the vaccine and wondered whether he was still on their side.\", \"\\u201cA lot of people in the MAGA Patriot community are like, \\u2018What is up with Trump?\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Davis, the Texas lawyer, said. \\u201cWith most of us, the vaccines are anathema.\\u201d\", \"In interviews, some who attended the Capitol protests gave credence to a new set of falsehoods promoted by Mr. Trump and conservative media figures and politicians that minimize the attack, or blame the violence falsely on left-wing infiltrators. And a few believe the insurrection did not go far enough.\", \"\\u201cMost everybody thinks we ought to have went with guns, and I kind of agree with that myself,\\u201d said Oren Orr, 32, a landscaper from Robbinsville, N.C., who had rented a car with his wife to get to the Capitol last year. \\u201cI think we ought to have went armed, and took it back. That is what I believe.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Orr added that he was not planning to do anything, only pray. Last year, he said he brought a baton and Taser to Washington but did not get them out. \", \"More than a year later, the day may not define their lives, but the sentiment that drove them there has given them new purpose. Despite multiple reviews showing the 2020 elections were run fairly, they are adamant that the voting process is rigged. They feel the news media and Democrats are trying to divide the country.\", \"The ralliers were largely white, conservative men and women who have formed the bedrock of the Trump movement since 2016. Some describe themselves as self-styled patriots, some openly carrying rifles and handguns. Many invoke the name of Jesus and say they believe they are fighting a holy war to preserve a Christian nation.\", \"The people who went to Washington for Jan. 6 are in some ways an isolated cohort. But they are also part of a larger segment of the public that may distance itself from the day\\u2019s violence but share some of its beliefs. A question now is the extent to which they represent a greater movement.\", \"A national survey led by Robert Pape, the director of the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago, concluded that about 47 million American adults, or one in every five, agreed with the statement that \\u201cthe 2020 election was stolen from Donald Trump and Joe Biden is an illegitimate president.\\u201d Of those, about 21 million, or 9 percent of American adults, shared the belief that animated many of those who went beyond marching and invaded the Capitol, Mr. Pape said: that the use of force was justified to restore Mr. Trump to the presidency.\", \"\", \"\\u201cThey are combustible material, like an amount of dry brushwood that could be set off during wildfire season by a lightning strike or by a spark,\\u201d he said.\", \"Some downplay Jan. 6 as a largely peaceful expression of their right to protest, comparing the Capitol attack with the 2020 racial-justice protests that erupted after George Floyd\\u2019s murder. They complain about a double standard, saying that the news media glossed over arson and looting after those protests but fixated on the violence on Jan. 6.\", \"They have rallied around the 700 people facing criminal charges in connection to the attack, calling them political prisoners.\", \"Earlier this month in Phoenix, a few dozen conservatives met to commemorate the anniversary Jan. 6 as counterprogramming to the solemn ceremonies taking place in Washington. They prayed and sang \\u201cAmazing Grace\\u201d and broadcast a phone call from the mother of Jacob Chansley, an Arizona man whose painted face and Viking helmet transformed him into an emblem of the riots. Mr. Chansley was sentenced to 41 months in prison after pleading guilty to federal charges.\", \"Then it was Jeff Zink\\u2019s turn at the microphone. Mr. Zink is one of several people who attended the Capitol protests and who are running for public office. Some won state legislature seats or local council positions in last November\\u2019s elections. Now, others have their eyes on the midterms.\", \"Mr. Zink is making an uphill run for Congress as a Republican in an overwhelmingly Democratic swath of Phoenix and said he will fight for Jan. 6 defendants \\u2014 a group that includes his 32-year-old son, Ryan.\", \"Father and son marched up the Capitol steps together and were steps away as police subdued a man who smashed a window. Mr. Zink said he and Ryan were peacefully documenting the event, and never actually entered the building. A federal criminal complaint accuses Ryan Zink of unlawfully entering a restricted area of the Capitol and obstructing an official proceeding.\", \"The complaint against Ryan Zink quotes a Facebook message from Jan. 6: \\u201cBroke down the doors pushed Congress out of session I took two flash bangs I\\u2019m OK I\\u2019ll be posting pictures in a little bit when we get back I\\u2019m hurt but we accomplished the job.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Zink, a onetime church deacon, referenced the biblical Book of Proverbs as he outlined why he believed Covid-19 was a bioweapon meant to convert the United States to socialism, and lamented that the United States \\u201cwas no longer a Christian nation.\\u201d And despite the fallout from their decision to join the Jan. 6 rally, Mr. Zink said he would \\u201cabsolutely\\u201d do it again.\", \"\\u201cGodly men and godly women need to stand up,\\u201d he said.\", \"Julie McKechnie Fisher, who went to Washington to hear Mr. Trump speak on Jan. 6 last year, helped organize more than 30 candlelight vigils nationwide like the one where Mr. Zink spoke, to honor the defendants. She is working with a right-wing group called Look Ahead America, which aims to register new voters in states like Virginia and Pennsylvania, and train them to lobby for what the group\\u2019s website calls \\u201cAmerica First initiatives,\\u201d like changing election laws and \\u201chelping to clean up voter rolls.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cWe just can\\u2019t become complacent,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI can\\u2019t see anything good that this administration has done for us, and it doesn\\u2019t feel like he loves our country.\\u201d\", \"Several people who marched on the Capitol described the day as a kind of Trumpian Fort Sumter \\u2014 part of a life-or-death fight against socialism, anti-Christian secularism and the tyranny of President Biden\\u2019s masking and vaccine mandates.\", \"Their views began to take shape in the hours just after Jan. 6, and have been buttressed by a flood of misinformation on social media, talk radio and from revisionist documentaries. Some said they had watched a program by the Fox News host Tucker Carlson that floated conspiracy theories suggesting Jan. 6 was a \\u201cfalse flag\\u201d operation.\", \"Several people charged in the breach of the Capitol have expressed remorse as they pleaded guilty and made requests for sentencing leniency, telling federal judges they now feel duped or wish they could do it over. A Colorado man wrote that he was \\u201cguilty of being an idiot.\\u201d A Kansas City man said he was \\u201cashamed.\\u201d\", \"Still, those who have been charged have supporters whose movement is wrapped not only in feelings of anger, but also of belonging. It is a reason the spirit of that day carries on.\", \"That sense of community resonates for people like Greg Stuchell, a city councilman from Hillsdale, Mich., who took an overnight bus to Washington last year with his teenage daughter to protest the election results. He said he did not enter the Capitol. For him, Jan. 6 is like the annual March for Life in Washington, he said, where people simply show up to protest laws and values they believe should fall. For every one person who attends, there are another hundred who wish they could have too, he said.\", \"Since the election Mr. Stuchell, a Catholic convert who opposes abortion, has channeled his anger by marching with other men around the Hillsdale courthouse on the first Sunday of every month. He found solidarity, he said, in similar men\\u2019s groups growing in Hungary and Poland. \\u201cMen got to step up, we don\\u2019t have that many men any more,\\u201d he said. At the machine shop he manages, some male co-workers have been tossing around ideas to protest what they see as a rigged government and election system going forward, like not filling out W2s, or not paying taxes, he said.\", \"\\u201cIf they don\\u2019t fix it, I don\\u2019t know what happens,\\u201d he said.\\u201cPeople need to stand up and say, \\u2018Enough.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"\"]","href_hash":"badc89e97c2211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"badc89e97c2211ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
