Wild-eyed Chilean surrealist Alejandro Jodorowsky had grand designs \\u2013 a 14-hour version he hoped would star Salvador Dali, Mick Jagger and Orson Welles \\u2013 that proved way too ambitious to realise. Ridley Scott toyed with the idea before giving up and moving on.\", \"David Lynch \\u2013 a filmmaker in sync with Herbert's psychic visions \\u2013 made it all the way to the screen with a memorably grotesque piece of pop art in 1984, only to have it chopped down to the point of near incoherency.\", \"The latest filmmaker to put their hand in the pain box, Canadian writer-director Denis Villeneuve, seems like a bit of an odd choice by comparison. He's the kind of filmmaker dubiously marketed as a 'visionary' by studios, even as his recent sci-fi forays \\u2013 Arrival (2016); the deeply unnecessary Blade Runner 2049 (2017) \\u2013 seem better suited to show off flatscreen TVs in designer apartments than evoke any kind of sweeping mystical future.\", \"So it's a pleasant surprise to report that his take on Dune, which finally descends upon cinemas this week, is an engrossing, well-mounted adaptation that makes good on his potential as a sci-fi craftsman \\u2013 not exactly enough to qualify as a visionary work, but an ambitious and largely satisfying space opera that rises like an oasis against the desert of Hollywood's current superhero cinema.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b7c782f49d075d12c981a489dd2173e0\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Villeneuve told director Guillermo del Toro in Interview Magazine that he wanted to make Dune feel \\u201cimmersive\\u201d. \\u201cThe camera is just above his [Paul\\u2019s] shoulder and we\\u2019re trying to understand the reality all around him.\\u201d(Supplied: Warner Bros./Chiabella James)</div>\", \"Boosted by Hans Zimmer's speaker-rumbling score \\u2013 with its metronomic thump and guttural alien chants \\u2013 the film is burnished and commanding, full of immense wide shots that dwarf the screen, jagged spacecraft that seem to emerge from misty oil paintings, and an admirable commitment to big, earnest movie myth-making.\", \"But Dune's prettiest effect might be its cast, especially its young leads, baby-faced androgyne Timoth\\u00e9e Chalamet and galaxy-eyed princess Zendaya \\u2013 two kids who're enough to suggest a brighter, or at least hotter, cosmic future.\", \"Chalamet is Paul, teenage heir to the noble House Atreides, a mall-goth glowerpuss who divides his time between learning mind tricks from his witchy mother, Lady Jessica (a soulful Rebecca Ferguson), and putting off the politics of the family business with dad, house boss and resident dreamboat, Duke Leto Atreides (Oscar Isaac).\", \"It's the very distant future \\u2013 never mind the swords, faux-medieval trimmings and bagpipes \\u2013 and the galactic Emperor has dispatched House Atreides to take custody of Arrakis, the desert planet rich in the spice that is essential to space travel.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/50eeeabe1bafc8ba45c46137eb85d741\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> \\u201cIt\\u2019s about human personality and human emotion \\u2026 That informed every decision that I made,\\u201d Australian cinematographer Greig Fraser told The Screen Show.(Supplied: Warner Bros.)</div>\", \"The appointment isn't going down well with the Atreides's bitter rivals House Harkonnen, a planet of sinister creeps who bathe in black slime, keep giant spiders as pets, and whose leader, Baron Vladimir (Stellan Skarsg\\u00e5rd), seems modelled after Marlon Brando's performance in Apocalypse Now (1979).\", \"Exploited for its natural resource, Arrakis \\u2013 also known as Dune \\u2013 is inhabited by the indigenous Fremen, a band of blue-eyed nomads who include Zendaya's Chani, the desert warrior who's been turning up in Paul's dreams.\", \"These premonitions also suggest that Paul might be a kind of space messiah;

Arrival) give the story a sense of scale and lived-in detail, welding the wide-screen vastness of Lawrence of Arabia (1962) to the scrappy grit of the first Star Wars (1977), a film whose desert sequences were famously inspired by Herbert's writing.\", \"The vistas are enhanced by all the special effects a reported $165 million dollar budget can buy: combat holo-shields that glitch and glimmer, insect-like ornithopters that swoop through sandstorms, and titanic spacecraft that seem to have teleported right off the pulp paperback covers of the 60s and 70s.\", \"For sci-fi nuts, it's hard to resist.\", \"But the showy effects are also offset by an attention to less expected, human-sized details: Jason Momoa's easy, movie-star charm as Duncan Idaho, a swordmaster who Paul adores;
