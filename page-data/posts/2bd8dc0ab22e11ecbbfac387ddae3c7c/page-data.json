The company in mid-2021 said it had just under a million US employees, and it now has a market capitalization of about $US1.7 trillion.\", \"Walmart Inc, the number one US private employer, has nearly 1.6 million US employees, and is not unionised.\", \"Labour expert and professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University Dan Cornfield called the vote a \\\"momentous victory for working people who are doing homegrown union organising.\\\"\", \"Cornfield said he expects the win to accelerate the already rapidly growing labour activism across the US retail sector.\", \"\\\"It's almost like a David and Goliath type of victory,\\\" Cornfield said. \\\"There's already a wave (of activism) occurring, and this will encourage more of that.\\\"\", \"US President Joe Biden was glad to see Amazon workers' voices were heard, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said. Psaki added that Biden believes that \\\"every worker in every state should have a free and fair choice to join a union\\\" and that Amazon workers on Staten Island \\\"made their choice to organise a grassroots union, bargain for better jobs and a better life.\\\"\", \"Other recent labour drives are picking up momentum. Nine US Starbucks stores have voted to organise, with more than 150 more seeking elections.\", \"At an Amazon facility in Alabama, by contrast, a majority of workers rejected unionisation, though the outcome was not final.\", \"The Alabama contest could hinge on 416 challenged ballots to be adjudicated in the coming weeks, which are sufficient to change the result, the NLRB said. The situation is far different from last year when workers sided with Amazon by a more than 2-to-1 margin against unionising.\", \"Amazon workers responded to more in-person outreach by labour activists as the pandemic subsided. A second company warehouse in Staten Island, LDJ5, will also vote on whether to unionize, starting on 25 April.\", \"The number of employees eligible to participate in the Staten Island vote was 8325, the NLRB said.\", \"-Reuters\"]","href_hash":"2bd8dc0ab22e11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2bd8dc0ab22e11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
