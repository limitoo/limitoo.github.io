It is demanding security guarantees from the West, including a promise by NATO never to admit Ukraine. Moscow sees the former Soviet republic as a buffer between Russia and NATO countries.\", \"Following multiple rounds of US-Russia talks over Ukraine that failed to reach a breakthrough, Biden, who has long warned Moscow of economic consequences, upped the ante on Tuesday by saying Putin could personally face sanctions.\", \"Biden told reporters that if Russia were to move into Ukraine with the estimated 100,000 soldiers it has massed near the border, it would be the \\\"largest invasion since World War Two\\\" and would \\\"change the world.\\\"\", \"Asked if he would see himself imposing sanctions on Putin directly if Russia invaded Ukraine, Biden responded: \\\"Yes.
