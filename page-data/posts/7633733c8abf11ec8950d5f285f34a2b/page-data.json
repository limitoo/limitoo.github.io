The show follows Charlie and Pim, two employees at a company that vows to put smiles on its clients\\u2019 faces, and there\\u2019s a cheery grotesquerie to most episodes. \\u201cSmiling Friends\\u201d feels like a cross between the earnest strangeness of \\u201cAqua Teen Hunger Force\\u201d and the procedural style of \\u201cCupcake and Dino.\\u201d If you\\u2019re the kind of person who feels warm sunshine in your heart when a lady shrimp is named \\u201cShrimpina,\\u201d watch this.\", \"\\u2018Whitney\\u2019s Anthem\\u2019When to watch: Friday at 8 p.m., on ESPN.\", \"This documentary is an interesting if hurried look at Whitney Houston and her performance of \\u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\\u201d at Super Bowl XXV in 1991. (Friday is the 10th anniversary of Houston\\u2019s death, and Super Bowl LVI is Sunday.) \\u201cAnthem\\u201d covers both the social context of the moment \\u2014 Operation Desert Storm had just begun \\u2014 and the artistic context, with the music director Rickey Minor explaining how he arranged the anthem to best suit Houston\\u2019s style. Prepare to be struck by how na\\u00efve and ancient everything and everyone in 1991 suddenly seem.\", \"\\u2018Bel-Air\\u2019When to watch: Debuts Sunday, on Peacock.\", \"What started as a viral video in 2019 is now a full-on reboot of \\u201cThe Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,\\u201d eliminating nearly all of the original\\u2019s humor and replacing it with the sleek bleakness of modern dramas. Jabari Banks stars as Will, who, as in the original, is from West Philadelphia and gets in \\u201cone little fight\\u201d that frightens his mother, who sends him to live with his aunt, uncle and cousins in California. Everything is impressively done if vaguely inessential; \\u201cBel-Air\\u201d fits in fine with \\u201cAll American\\u201d or the reboot of \\u201cGossip Girl,\\u201d moody and well-intentioned, and hey, we all like when somebody gets pushed into a pool during a fight at a party. The first three episodes arrive Sunday, and the next seven arrive Thursdays after that.\"]","href_hash":"7633733c8abf11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7633733c8abf11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
