Be prepared.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-15T09:42:19.000Z","content":"[\"Rerouting, rebooking, diverting, you name it. Making last-minute flight changes can be an enormous challenge amid the stressful holiday travel season. Now add COVID-19 and the fast-spreading Omicron variant to the mix.\", \"Hundreds of flights have already been canceled last-minute due to pandemic-related staffing shortages. Many airlines remain understaffed and overbooked as the country returns to air travel after pandemic shutdowns.\", \"Spirit Airlines cast bad weather and labor shortages as the main culprits behind travel chaos that led to the low-cost carrier\\u00a0canceling more than 1,700 flights\\u00a0in August. The scenario replayed in September, when\\u00a0Southwest canceled hundreds of flights\\u00a0during the course of a weekend, and again in October when thousands of fliers were grounded after American shelved more than\\u00a01,800 flights nationwide\\u00a0over a three-day period.\", \"Perhaps a coronavirus variant surge forces you to cancel your trip. Or what if a winter snowstorm prevents you from taking off? No matter the reason, be prepared for last-minute flight changes or cancellations this year. Here's how to quickly get on another flight:\", \"Many major cities are served by multiple airports, so broaden your airport search. John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City might be backed up from a blizzard, but that doesn't necessarily mean nearby airports Newark Liberty International or LaGuardia are out of commission.\", \"And look beyond the major airlines. JSX is a semiprivate jet service, but fares often aren't much more than commercial airfares.\", \"Even if you're accustomed to booking via an individual airline's website, tools like Google Flights will allow you to quickly compare routes across multiple airlines, nearby airports and selected dates. Booking tools may help surface an available route you'd otherwise miss.\", \"Don't limit your options by searching for round-trip tickets. In a pinch, book a one-way ticket and find the return flight later.\", \"And, if you're traveling with others, rather than searching for group tickets, consider searching for individual ones \\u2014 especially if your group is comfortable splitting up. If one flight has only four seats left but another flight has two, then a search for your party of six wouldn't show any available tickets. But if some folks are OK being left behind and catching up later, you improve your odds of getting to your destination, period.\", \"Fly direct when possible. If it isn't, try to connect through destinations that are less likely to be affected by bad winter weather (San Diego over Chicago, for example). While the flight with the layover might be cheaper, it might not be worth it if weather issues in the layover city are the reason you can't take off.\", \"There also are ways to improve your chances of getting a refund for flights interrupted by winter storms or COVID-19. One of the best methods for getting money back for canceled flights (or to get reimbursed for additional costs incurred during delays) is booking with a credit card that offers travel insurance.\", \"Exact terms vary by card, but you can typically expect coverage for flights affected by severe weather. And usually, this type of insurance will cover not just the flight itself, but ancillary expenses, such as an additional hotel night to take a next-day flight.\", \"If your credit card doesn't include travel insurance as a benefit, consider purchasing coverage separately. Look closely at the terms and conditions as they vary significantly between plans.\", \"Technology can help you. Many airlines are embracing social media as a customer service tool, and account managers may even be equipped to directly help passengers rebook, issue flight credits and more.\", \"If the delay is an airline's fault, you might get compensation. For example, Southwest Airlines' October 2021 meltdown cost the company $75 million, according to its third quarter earnings report. Much of that figure was attributed to customer refunds and \\\"gestures of goodwill,\\\" as Southwest offered vouchers to many customers who were affected.\", \"You might not think the scramble to make a last-minute flight change will happen to you \\u2014 until it does. And given the challenges of travel this holiday season, you should be more prepared than ever.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"fc4874b65dcd11ec87d345d49f11332b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fc4874b65dcd11ec87d345d49f11332b"}},
