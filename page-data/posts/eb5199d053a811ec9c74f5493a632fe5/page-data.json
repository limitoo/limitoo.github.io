(Henry Holt & Company, $50.) This mountainous new oral history of HBO follows the channel from its start in 1972 through its transformative \\u201cSopranos\\u201d years and up to the present day. It includes a landslide of corporate history in addition to details about shows like \\u201cSex and the City,\\u201d \\u201cSix Feet Under,\\u201d \\u201cGirls\\u201d and \\u201cGame of Thrones.\\u201d \\u201cThere\\u2019s enough animosity, jealousy, score-settling and killing gossip\\u201d in the book, \\u201cto fill an Elizabethan drama,\\u201d our critic Dwight Garner writes.\", \"IN THE EYE OF THE WILD, by Nastassja Martin. Translated from the French by Sophie R. Lewis. (New York Review Books, $14.95.) In 2015, the anthropologist Nastassja Martin barely survived a bear attack in the mountains of eastern Siberia. This haunting, genre-defying memoir is about the physical and philosophical fallout of the year that followed. Our critic Jennifer Szalai writes: \\u201cWhat Martin describes in this book isn\\u2019t so much a search for meaning as an acceptance of its undoing.\\u201d\", \"THE LOFT GENERATION: From the de Koonings to Twombly: Portraits and Sketches 1942-2011, by Edith Schloss. Edited by Mary Venturini. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $32.) The German American writer and artist Edith Schloss\\u2019s memoir, discovered in rough-draft form after her death in 2011, has been polished into a glowing jewel of a book. It recounts an era of great creative vitality and the time that Schloss spent with Willem and Elaine de Kooning, Merce Cunningham, Leo Castelli and others. \\u201cIf nostalgia is a sixth and often fogging sense,\\u201d our critic Alexandra Jacobs writes, \\u201cit is absent in a book that feels manifestly present, clear and alive even while describing the past.\\u201d\", \"ALL OF THE MARVELS: A Journey to the Ends of the Biggest Story Ever Told, by Douglas Wolk. (Penguin Press, $28.) To trace the innovations and strange experiments that made the Marvel magic work, Wolk did the seemingly impossible: Read all 27,000 comic books that the company published from 1961 until today. Impressively, he never gets lost in the labyrinth. The result, in the words of Junot D\\u00edaz\\u2019s review, is a \\u201cbrilliant, eccentric, moving and wholly wonderful attempt to distill it all into a coherent narrative. \\u2026 Wolk illuminates much that is important about our strange mutant Marvel century.\\u201d\", \"AMERICAN COMICS: A History, by Jeremy Dauber. (Norton, $35.) Dauber\\u2019s scholarly survey of comics history is opinionated and frequently funny. Starting with the 19th-century political cartoons of Thomas Nast, it traces the boom in newspaper comics, the advent of comic books, underground comics, fan culture, and finally graphic novels and web comics. \\u201cDauber is particularly nuanced in dealing with the many controversies buffeting comics past and present, from debates over comics codes and depictions of sex and violence to questions of diversity, representation and authority \\u2018played out through the stretch of spandex,\\u2019\\u201d Michael Tisserand writes in his review. \\u201cDauber ably demonstrates that comics, as much as or more than any other art or literature, can handle the most serious of topics, including one of the most serious of all: our ability to laugh at ourselves.\\u201d\", \"MURDER UNDER HER SKIN, by Stephen Spotswood. (Doubleday, $27.) In this delightful continuation of Spotswood\\u2019s quirky old-school mystery series, the private investigator Lillian Pentecost and her young assistant, Willowjean \\u201cWill\\u201d Parker, try to uncover who killed the \\u201cAmazing Tattooed Woman\\u201d in the traveling circus where Parker once worked. Parker\\u2019s fire-eating former mentor is the prime suspect \\u2014 but, as Sarah Weinman writes in her latest crime column, \\u201cPentecost and Parker, of course, know better. It\\u2019s a pleasure to watch them arrive at that knowledge after sifting through red herrings and peeling secrets back like layers of an onion, all while revealing even more of themselves without guilt or shame.\\u201d\", \"FIGHT NIGHT, by Miriam Toews. (Bloomsbury, $24.) Toews\\u2019s eighth novel is the story of three generations of women as told by the youngest of them, a 9-year-old named Swiv who combs her grandmother\\u2019s hair and doles out her heart medications. Toews is a master of dialogue, swirling the adults\\u2019 perspectives through Swiv\\u2019s imperfect ventriloquism as if she were mixing paints. \\u201cThe reader is pulled into the intimacy of a dysfunctional family whose unconditional love would make any truly dysfunctional family jealous,\\u201d Nadja Spiegelman writes in her review. \\u201cThe three women stand alone, together, against the universe, so closely molded against one another\\u2019s jagged edges that their individual outlines blur.\\u201d\", \"THE DEEP PLACES: A Memoir of Illness and Discovery, by Ross Douthat. (Convergent, $26.) Shortly after buying a Connecticut farmhouse, the Times columnist grapples with a confounding tick-borne illness in this darkly thoughtful memoir of attempting to make peace with discomfort, uncertainty and unsatisfying answers. \\u201cDouthat sees symbols everywhere; he is telling a story not only of his own illness, but also about the stories we tell ourselves, secular and religious, to make sense of illness,\\u201d Sara Austin writes in her review. \\u201cWrithing in pain on the bathroom floor, breaking down halfway through a speech or stumbling into empty churches to pray for relief, Douthat lays himself bare in ways that can be affecting.\\u201d\", \"HARSH TIMES, by Mario Vargas Llosa. Translated by Adrian Nathan West. (Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $28.) Vargas Llosa\\u2019s new novel turns its sights on Guatemala, exploring the U.S.-backed coup of 1954 with its devastating misinformation campaign and the underlying web of conspiracy and coercion. \\u201cVargas Llosa has constructed a compelling and propulsive literary thriller, deeply informed by his experience as a public intellectual and a practicing politician,\\u201d Hari Kunzru writes in his review. \\u201cIn \\u2018Harsh Times,\\u2019 Vargas Llosa has pulled back the curtain on a terrifying world of cynical realpolitik, and in a certain sense, has had the last word, demonstrating that no matter how powerful a dictator may be, ultimately his legacy will be shaped by writers.\\u201d\", \"BORN IN BLACKNESS: Africa, Africans, and the Making of the Modern World, 1471 to the Second World War, by Howard W. French. (Liveright, $35.) This elegant history of the rise of the West, by a former Africa correspondent for The Times, places that continent \\u2014 with its wealth of resources, both natural and human \\u2014 at the center of the story. \\u201c\\u2018Born in Blackness\\u2019 is filled with pain, but also with pride: pride at the endurance of oppressed millions, at the many slave uprisings and rebellions culminating in the Haitian revolution \\u2026 and in the cultural riches of the African diaspora,\\u201d Nigel Cliff writes in his review. \\u201cI found the book to be searing, humbling and essential reading.\\u201d\", \"THOSE WE THROW AWAY ARE DIAMONDS: A Refugee\\u2019s Search for Home, by Mondiant Dogon with Jenna Krajeski. (Penguin Press, $28.) A member of the Democratic Republic of Congo\\u2019s Tutsi minority, Dogon fled the 1990s genocide as a child. Yet his memoir is girded by a beguiling delicacy of spirit. \\u201cFlotsam and jetsam of the modern world, refugees are engaged in a dogged battle to endow a modicum of dignity to lives over which they exert almost no control,\\u201d Michela Wrong writes, reviewing the book. \\u201cDogon rises to that challenge far better than most of us would.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"eb5199d053a811ec9c74f5493a632fe5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"eb5199d053a811ec9c74f5493a632fe5"}},
