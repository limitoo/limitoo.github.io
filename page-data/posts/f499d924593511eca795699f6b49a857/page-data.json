If so, it would be less than 48 hours after the proposal was drafted.\", \"The bill represents a role reversal for Republicans and Democrats in the Legislature. Republicans typically resist government involvement in the affairs of private businesses but are now pushing to restrict a reason\\u2014no vaccination\\u2014for letting employees go.\", \"\\\"I ask that the business community stand with [the Democrats] as we fight against an unprecedented effort by Republicans to dictate how you run your business. Their crusade against public health is an attack on job creators in South Carolina,\\\" House Minority Leader Todd Rutherford of Columbia tweeted Wednesday night.\", \"Conservative lawmakers in the state say the bill is a necessary response to vaccination mandates ordered by President Joe Biden, which cover health care workers and businesses with 100 or more employees. The mandates are pending because of suspensions ordered by federal judges.\", \"South Carolina's Chamber of Commerce and 27 other business groups around the state have publicly opposed the new bill, saying it runs contrary to the state's pro-business reputation.\", \"\\\"South Carolina has a long-held tradition of being a pro-business state that allows businesses to operate with minimal government intervention,\\\" the groups said in a statement. \\\"Employment decisions have been left to individual businesses in our state, subject to what each business believes is right for their operations.\\\"\", \"If the bill passes in the House Thursday, it will likely not be considered by the Senate until the next legislative session begins, on January 11.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948758/south-carolina-vaccine-mandate-ban.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">South Carolina House Majority Leader Gary Simrill and Representative Gilda Cobb-Hunter talk Thursday before a House Ways and Means Committee meeting to consider a bill banning businesses from requiring COVID-19 vaccination for employees.</div>\", \"Business groups including the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce are asking lawmakers to oppose the bill, which also would prevent COVID-19 vaccine mandates for state and local government employees, contractors and public school students.\", \"Democrats suddenly find themselves in an unusual position\\u2014champions of businesses and the right of employers to determine requirements for their workers. Only two other states\\u2014Montana and Tennessee\\u2014have passed similar bans.\", \"The bill passed the Ways and Means Committee on a 12-6 vote Thursday morning less than two hours before the full House was set to meet. A Rules Committee meeting at noon was expected to pass a resolution to allow the bill to bypass the typical waiting period and be heard immediately and stay before the House until it is finished.\", \"They brought about 100 protesters with signs calling for \\\"medical freedom\\\" when the special session held mainly for redistricting started last week.\", \"To defeat the bill, Democrats will need to get about 20 Republicans on their side, depending on who all shows up for the session Thursday. In the Ways and Means Committee, one Republican representative, Shannon Erickson of Beaufort, voted against the bill. GOP Representative Kirkman Finlay said he voted for it \\\"with great reluctance\\\" and five more Republicans weren't at the meeting.\", \"Republican Governor Henry McMaster may be against the bill also. While he has been forceful against government mandates for vaccines, he also has said he does not like government telling private businesses how to operate. He said Wednesday he wasn't ready to give his thoughts on the proposal.\", \"Senators at the end of their redistricting special session Tuesday were wishing colleagues and staff a merry Christmas and a happy New Year and saying they would see them in January.\", \"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948759/todd-rutherford-south-carolina-vaccine-mandate.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">State Representative Todd Rutherford publicly criticized a South Carolina bill proposed by House Republicans that would ban private companies from firing employees who refuse to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.
