Protesters attended several sites, shouting into megaphones and handing out pamphlets with warnings widely dismissed by the scientific community.\\u00a0\", \"Glenn Mulholland, an anesthesiologist, tweeted: \\\"Watch out for anti-vaxxers at the Glenfield vax centre - walking down line of cars scaremongering with leaflets about contents of vaccine.\\\"\", \"\\\"I think allegedly is the word that we would use,\\\" Ardern told reporters on Monday, in response to the warnings spread by the COVID-19 vaccine sceptics.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"My overall message is the same as it has always been: I still absolutely believe that we are all motivated by the same thing and it's that we want to look after one another,\\\" Ardern said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"We know from the evidence, from the data, from our scientists and from our experts that the best way to look after one another is to be vaccinated, and that means receiving a booster.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"To families: we listen to our experts, and they've advised us that the best thing we can do to look after children and their families is for them to also receive the vaccine.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I would just implore people, it's not about the Government here. It's about what the best advice possible is telling us.

What kind of person goes out to yell at kids!?\\\"\", \"Ardern shared a similar sentiment.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Of course, my preference would be that no one would have any barrier or obstruction to them accessing what is ultimately medical support.

I have confidence the Pfizer vaccine is very safe for children,\\\" she said on Monday.\", \"\\\"The best thing a parent can do to prepare their children to be immunised is to talk to them about what is going to happen.
