These are the Grammys, after all.\", \"But Jon Batiste \\u2014 the most-nominated artist overall? And \\u2026 Abba? Who knew.\", \"The contenders for the 64th annual Grammy Awards in January were announced on Tuesday. The New York Times music team \\u2014 reporter Joe Coscarelli, chief pop music critic Jon Pareles and pop music critic Jon Caramanica \\u2014 are here to break them down.\", \"JOE COSCARELLI Let\\u2019s just start with the real shocker: A jazz pianist leads the field with 11 total nominations.\", \"Yes, Batiste is a genre-crossing multihyphenate who works as the bandleader and musical director for CBS\\u2019s \\u201cThe Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\\u201d He\\u2019s already won a Golden Globe and an Oscar (best original score for Pixar\\u2019s \\u201cSoul,\\u201d alongside Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross) and is liable to pop up anywhere music is played \\u2014 even alongside Madonna, as she promoted her \\u201cMadame X\\u201d concert movie in Harlem.\", \"Yet seeing him not only in the R&B, jazz, classical and American roots categories but also in the general field \\u2014 record and album of the year \\u2014 alongside those I considered shoo-ins (Rodrigo, Eilish, Taylor Swift, Doja Cat) was the sort of surprise that only the Grammys can consistently provide.\", \"Which is to say, was this actually a twist or was this the most Grammys thing that could have possibly happened? I\\u2019m torn, because on one hand, it felt like we were moving away from this. On the other, Jacob Collier got an album of the year nod last time around.\", \"JON CARAMANICA Last year, when talking about the ubiquity of the retro rock-soul band Black Pumas, we underscored a now-familiar Grammy sleight of hand: Rather than nominate older musicians well past their prime popularity, the show instead nominates younger musicians who make music in an old-fashioned way. That can mean Black Pumas, and it can mean Billie Eilish.\", \"This year, it means Jon Batiste, who is 35, but pointedly carries on the long tradition of New Orleans music, and who in recent years has become an institutionalist, a slightly less progressive version of his bandleader competitor, Questlove of \\u201cThe Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.\\u201d\", \"The Grammys are, naturally, the ultimate institution \\u2014 I would not be surprised if, a decade or two from now, Batiste becomes the show\\u2019s musical director. That he is also the bandleader on the marquee late-night show on CBS, the network that also broadcasts the Grammys, isn\\u2019t evidence of a fix, but it\\u2019s a reminder that the presumed and actual audiences for the awards show and the network both skew old \\u2014 and that in this echo chamber, and perhaps only in this echo chamber, Batiste qualifies as a pop star.\", \"JON PARELES Batiste is an impressive musician and performer \\u2014 pianist, singer, dancer \\u2014 and his album, \\u201cWe Are,\\u201d is a trove of good intentions and good playing, including New Orleans connections with appearances by Trombone Shorty and the Hot 8 Brass Band. Like Black Pumas (also nominated this year!), Batiste\\u2019s album harks back to vintage soul and R&B, clearly a sweet spot for Grammy voters, although it also ventures toward hip-hop. The album is a serious, thoughtful statement, celebrating New Orleans roots \\u2014 Batiste is a member of a longstanding musical family \\u2014 and his own memories of growing up. It also has positive-thinking message songs like \\u201cFreedom\\u201d and \\u201cWe Are.\\u201d But Batiste\\u2019s nightly broadcast exposure clearly has a lot to do with all his nominations; someone\\u2019s still watching network TV.\", \"You get a lot of Grammy nominations by qualifying for multiple categories \\u2014 and a lot of nominations does not guarantee a lot of wins. Batiste is in R&B, jazz, American roots, soundtrack (for \\u201cSoul\\u201d), music video and even contemporary classical for one of the album tracks, \\u201cMovement 11\\u201d \\u2014 which is a stretch, since it shares far more similarity to a two-minute jazz improvisation with added strings than it does to its fellow nominees, like the Dutch composer Louis Andriessen\\u2019s knotty orchestral song cycle, \\u201cThe Only One.\\u201d\", \"COSCARELLI Rounding out album of the year, in addition to Batiste\\u2019s \\u201cWe Are,\\u201d you have \\u201cLove for Sale\\u201d by Tony Bennett and Lady Gaga, \\u201cJustice (Triple Chucks Deluxe)\\u201d by Justin Bieber, \\u201cPlanet Her (Deluxe)\\u201d by Doja Cat, \\u201cBack of My Mind\\u201d by H.E.R., \\u201cHappier Than Ever\\u201d by Billie Eilish, \\u201cMontero\\u201d by Lil Nas X, \\u201cSour\\u201d by Olivia Rodrigo, \\u201cEvermore\\u201d by Taylor Swift and \\u201cDonda\\u201d by Kanye West.\", \"Many of those artists are also represented in song and record of the year, where you also get a mix of Brandi Carlile, Ed Sheeran, Silk Sonic and Abba\\u2019s \\u201cI Still Have Faith in You,\\u201d which is apparently a record that moved people? That means no Halsey, Ariana Grande, BTS, Megan Thee Stallion, Chris Stapleton or Tyler, the Creator in the major categories, which plenty will see as galling.\", \"The 2019 best album winner, Kacey Musgraves, was also eligible again, for her latest LP, \\u201cStar-Crossed,\\u201d which wasn\\u2019t nominated as a body of work. Instead, she landed only two nods overall: best country song and best country solo performance for \\u201cCamera Roll,\\u201d despite the album being reportedly removed from the country categories by the Recording Academy\\u2019s genre police.\", \"PARELES One thing that struck me, as a writer for a sometime print publication, was the sheer typographical burden of this year\\u2019s Grammy nominations. The list simply has not looked like this before. The album of the year category goes on for three full pages to name all the songwriters, producers and engineers credited on albums by Batiste, Bieber, Doja Cat, H.E.R., Lil Nas X, Swift and West.\", \"It\\u2019s a reflection of how albums are made now. It\\u2019s not a band and a producer sequestered in the studio. It\\u2019s about beat-shopping, samples, songwriting camps, remote collaborations, multiple tweaks and iterations \\u2014 and all the participants want those credits and publishing points. The nominees alone are going to be a sizable voting bloc for each album, especially in a category split 10 ways.\", \"COSCARELLI But then there\\u2019s Gaga and Bennett, Eilish and Rodrigo, whose credits are minuscule by comparison. That could potentially give them an edge with more conservative voters who remain concerned with the bespoke quality of the music.\", \"Along with expanding the Big Four categories to 10 nominees each \\u2014 and lowering the bar for how much any one collaborator has to contribute to be among those recognized in the best album field (hello, Zadie Smith!) \\u2014 this year also marked the end of the so-called Nominations Review Committees. (These were the source of the Weeknd\\u2019s frustration last year, after he was snubbed and eventually decided to boycott.)\", \"Rather than some shadowy cabal taking the members\\u2019 top vote-getters, considering them and then making their own final decision on the nominees anyway, the Recording Academy says these picks are pure: Whoever got the most votes from their music industry peers is who is appearing on the final ballot.\", \"Do you see that reflected here? My sense is that it benefits those with wide name recognition and enduring industry connections and respect \\u2014 Bieber, Abba, maybe even Carlile, who has a record of the year nomination and two for song, including an Alicia Keys duet. At the same time, you could imagine the secret committees keeping out something like Lady Gaga and Bennett\\u2019s \\u201cLove for Sale,\\u201d because it\\u2019s so stereotypically Old and Stuffy Grammys \\u2014 the kind of thing it felt like they were distancing themselves from in recent history.\", \"CARAMANICA I will not lie: my heart palpitated a little erratically (and worryingly) when I read the first name in the first category, record of the year: Abba. Now look, I exult at weddings just like the next sap, and I honor anyone whose albums were in my parents\\u2019 vinyl collection. But this new Abba music is thin, thin, thin. It exists primarily as an advertisement for the old Abba music, and the group\\u2019s avatar-led stage show that\\u2019s debuting next year.\", \"PARELES That\\u2019s obviously one of the Grammys\\u2019 better-late-than-never nominations. Abba never got a Grammy in its prime; this nomination is the apology.\", \"Meanwhile, count me surprised that Arooj Aftab turns up in the best new artist category. She is a Pakistani musician who studied at the Berklee School of Music and is based in Brooklyn, mingling South Asian music, jazz and chamber music; some of the songs on her (third) album, \\u201cVulture Prince,\\u201d presumably the one that caught the Grammys\\u2019 attention, have lyrics by the 13th-century Persian mystical poet Rumi. It\\u2019s a lovely album, but I hardly expected to see her name alongside Rodrigo and Saweetie. Persian aside, there\\u2019s also still a language barrier for Grammy voters in this category; where are streaming blockbusters like Rauw Alejandro, whose debut album came out last November?\", \"COSCARELLI Best new artist is confusing, especially with the removal of the nomination committees taken into account. Enough people knew Aftab, Baby Keem and Japanese Breakfast to put them ahead of, say, Polo G, Tems, Jack Harlow and Maneskin (shudder)?\", \"I do miss the secret committees when it comes to rock. Last year, they seemed to make a point to shake up typically staid categories like best rock song, album and performance, the latter of which was all women for the first time, including Fiona Apple, Phoebe Bridgers and Haim. This year it\\u2019s back to basics: AC/DC, Black Pumas (for a live release), Chris Cornell, Deftones and Foo Fighters. Kings of Leon, Weezer and Paul McCartney also turn up in the rock field.\", \"That can\\u2019t help but feel like regression, even if it\\u2019s what the voters wanted.\", \"CARAMANICA Joe, you see that shift also in the best rap album nominations. Last year, they consisted of purist-oriented artisanal albums at the intersection of process and aesthetic that the Grammys has long valorized in other genres. This year, the nominees are \\u2026 reasonably popular and generally respected rap albums.\", \"That includes \\u201cDonda,\\u201d which is also nominated for album of the year. West received five total nominations this year, representing something of a coming in from the cold for someone who, in Grammy terms, now qualifies as a legacy artist. He has been nominated over 70 times in his career, but apart from last year\\u2019s win for best contemporary Christian music album, hasn\\u2019t taken home a trophy since 2013. He also hasn\\u2019t been nominated for album of the year for an album of his own since his 2007 album \\u201cGraduation.\\u201d (He has been nominated as a producer on others\\u2019 albums.)\", \"The nominations of \\u201cDonda\\u201d and \\u201cHurricane\\u201d (best melodic rap performance) also means nominations for the Weeknd, even after his boycott. (He is also nominated for his contributions to Doja Cat\\u2019s album.)\", \"COSCARELLI The inclusion of \\u201cDonda\\u201d in album of the year can\\u2019t help but highlight the lack of Drake\\u2019s \\u201cCertified Lover Boy,\\u201d which earned a rap album and a rap performance nod (for \\u201cWay 2 Sexy\\u201d) but nothing in the top categories. Both are among the year\\u2019s biggest albums commercially.\", \"Also on that best-seller list? Morgan Wallen, who has outperformed both rappers but came away with absolutely no nominations amid his soft industry banishment for drunkenly shouting a racial slur in a video captured by a neighbor. Does that count as a snub, or just a cultural land mine avoided?\", \"CARAMANICA It\\u2019s also worth mentioning Taylor Swift here \\u2014 a lonely nomination for album of the year, for \\u201cEvermore,\\u201d perhaps the least commercially impactful album of her career, and also another nomination in the same category by dint of her writing \\u201ccontributions\\u201d to Olivia Rodrigo\\u2019s \\u201cSour.\\u201d\", \"PARELES In a way, Swift\\u2019s album nomination is the appropriate one: \\u201cEvermore\\u201d is an old-fashioned full-length album, made to be heard as a whole. Also on the absentee list: Lana Del Rey and Lorde, even though their (and Swift\\u2019s) producer Jack Antonoff is nominated as producer of the year, in part for his work with them.\", \"COSCARELLI I see neither of you want to touch the subject of Wallen right now \\u2014 just like the Grammys.\", \"CARAMANICA On the other hand, there are a handful of TikTok hits that have now led to Grammy nominations: Giveon\\u2019s slow and aching \\u201cHeartbreak Anniversary\\u201d is nominated for best R&B song, and the British rock band Glass Animals had a huge TikTok hit this year with \\u201cHeat Waves,\\u201d and now the band, which has been releasing music for several years, is nominated for best new artist. Walker Hayes\\u2019s goofy country stomper \\u201cFancy Like\\u201d started its ascent on TikTok and now is nominated in best country song.\", \"PARELES Well, at least they\\u2019re trying. You have to sympathize, a little, with how difficult it is for the Grammys to try to sum up all of music when there are so many niche audiences that barely intersect. But we\\u2019re lucky that hardly anyone who cares about music takes the Grammys as the ultimate judgment.\"]","href_hash":"451f7aeb4c9711ecad53cb42208f3a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"451f7aeb4c9711ecad53cb42208f3a03"}},
