In this debut, a young Chinese-American woman spends nine months nannying for a wealthy white family in TriBeCa, which prompts her to revisit her own tumultuous childhood. \\u201cWu\\u2019s finely crafted sentences and crisp imagery render visceral Willa\\u2019s inner disquiet,\\u201d noted our reviewer, YZ Chin.\", \"EXERCISED: Why Something We Never Evolved to Do Is Healthy and Rewarding, by Daniel Lieberman. (Vintage, 464 pp., $17.) Unlike other fitness books, \\u201cExercised\\u201d is not trying to sell any diets or fitness plans, our reviewer, Jen A. Miller, observed. Instead, \\u201cLieberman, drawing on his expertise and knowledge of the way evolutionary forces work, takes ideas that have been spun and spun again, often based on shaky information, and cracks them open.\\u201d\", \"THE KNOWLEDGE MACHINE: How Irrationality Created Modern Science, by Michael Strevens.

Translated by Lara Vergnaud. (Other Press, 208 pp., $15.99.) This autofiction debut was a literary hit in France, and follows a young, lesbian Algerian woman as she wrestles with the friction of her conflicting identities while living in a majority-Muslim suburb of Paris.\", \"THE NATIONAL ROAD: Dispatches From a Changing America, by Tom Zoellner. (Counterpoint, 272 pp., $16.95.) Zoellner, the politics editor of The Los Angeles Review of Books, is an \\u201cold-fashioned American vagabond,\\u201d our reviewer, Jody Rosen, wrote.
