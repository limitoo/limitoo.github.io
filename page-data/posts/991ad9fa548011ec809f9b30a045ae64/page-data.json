Unfortunately, the shell got \\\"lodged inside his rectum,\\\" and he \\\"sought medical assistance after realizing he couldn't get it out.\\\"\", \"Upon arrival, he was admitted to the hospital's Accidents and Emergencies (A&E) department, said Gloucestershire Live. There, medical staff called experts from an Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team, out of fear that the object might explode, reported Unilad.\", \"\\\"It was a solid shot round. It was a chunky, pointed lump of lead designed to rip through a tank's armor,\\\" said a source, according to Unilad. \\\"It was basically an inert lump of metal, so there was no risk to life\\u2014at least not to anyone else's.\\\"\", \"Gloucestershire Live further explained that the mortar round \\\"was used by the Royal Artillery in the Second World War as anti-tank rounds, though it would later also be used by British tanks in North Africa.\\\"\", \"Other military weapons have been found throughout Europe, though none of them were found lodged inside of a human being.\", \"In February, the Manchester Evening News reported that an unexploded mortar shell was found in Glossop, Derbyshire, England. At the time, police described the discovery as \\\"something very dangerous and unusual.\\\"\", \"A beach in Brighton, England was temporarily closed in April after an unexploded mortar shell was found, said the BBC. However, it \\\"washed away,\\\" before experts could dispose of the munition.\", \"And on Wednesday, a WWII bomb \\\"exploded at a construction site next to a busy railway line in Munich,\\\" reported NBC. Four were injured.\", \"\\\"Bavaria's state interior minister, Joachim Herrmann, said the 550-pound bomb was found during drilling work,\\\" stated NBC.\", \"\\\"Herrmann said authorities must now investigate why it wasn't discovered earlier,\\\" the station continued. \\\"He noted that such construction sites are usually scanned carefully in advance for possible unexploded bombs.\\\"\", \"According to a 2016 article in Smithsonian Magazine, this is because \\\"more than 2,000 tons of unexploded munitions are uncovered on German soil every year.\\\"\", \"In a statement obtained by Gloucestershire Live regarding Wednesday's ordeal, a spokesperson for Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust said: \\\"As with any incident involving munitions, the relevant safety protocols were followed to ensure that there was no risk to patients, staff or visitors at any time.\\\"\", \"The patient has since been released and is expected to make a full recovery.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1945359/mortar.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A bomb squad was called to the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital in England on Wednesday after a patient arrived with a World War II munition \\u201cstuck inside\\u201d him, reported the BBC.
