Heels click purposefully into a room. A piano lid is confidently opened, a marble slab floured, a knife honed. Lighting pools warmly amid expensive-looking wood. Swells of music coalesce into momentary silence; something of quality is about to start.\", \"The instructors in this nave of learning have unequivocally made it in their fields. Margaret Atwood speaks on writing, Frank Gehry on design and architecture, Misty Copeland on ballet. If you want to learn about acting, here is Samuel L. Jackson; if you\\u2019re interested in directing, here is Ron Howard. Lately the topics have also edged into softer territory, bathing everyday challenges in celebrity wisdom. Some feel like unboxing videos for admirable personality traits. Anna Wintour had a lockdown hit with a course on \\u201ccreativity and leadership.\\u201d RuPaul\\u2019s, on \\u201cself-expression and authenticity,\\u201d touches on the craft of drag but mostly focuses on concepts like conquering your inner naysayer and cultivating stillness.\", \"Into this mix comes Pharrell Williams, pop star, producer, designer, reality-TV judge, guy with a skin-care line. In the first frames of his new course, he slides into a chair dressed in knee-shorts and a shrunken schoolboy blazer, as if to sartorially convey that every student is a teacher. His skin is amazing, his head chiseled into gorgeousness, his gaze unswerving, as if blinking were for the less focused. He is not here to teach us hitmaking, or streetwear design, or even multitasking. He\\u2019s here to give a class on empathy.\", \"\\u201cI think empathy is the most important thing,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not a natural thing to just literally think of others all the time. It\\u2019s just not. You constantly have to challenge yourself to be a little bit more open to what other people are going through.\\u201d With that, we\\u2019re full steam into a seriously weird offering of 21st-century moral instruction, or self-help, or celebrity branding, or whatever this edutainment golem is \\u2014 10 segments in which the pop star will show us how to become more boundlessly compassionate humans.\", \"For this job, he has been teamed with a brain trust that includes Cornel West, Roxane Gay, Walter Mosley and Gloria Steinem, among others. All the guests also teach their own, more specific Masterclasses; judging by the wardrobe, they seem to have taken time in their own class shoots to drop some off-the-cuff wisdom on what Williams calls \\u201cthe art and sport of considering others.\\u201d The result feels like a compilation of commodified theory of mind, generously spiked with images of pride flags, Black Lives Matter placards and people in kaffiyehs smiling warmly.\", \"Empathy has had a hot ride in America lately. The word saw a nearly fivefold increase as a Google search between the first inauguration of Barack Obama \\u2014 who defined empathy as being able to \\u201cstand in someone else\\u2019s shoes\\u201d and famously talked of America\\u2019s \\u201cempathy deficit\\u201d \\u2014 and the summer of 2020, when interest spiked to an all-time high. Now C.E.O.s are being encouraged by organizational psychologists and consultants to cast themselves as \\u201cChief Empathy Officers,\\u201d in an attempt to reimagine their offices as places workers might actually desire to return to. The concept seems to have become a cure for any societal ill. A recent HealthDay headline asked, \\u201cHow to Counter the Anti-Mask Backlash?\\u201d and then answered with, you guessed it, \\u201cEmpathy.\\u201d The word has expanded in such fascinating directions that there is a Damien Hirst-designed \\u201cEmpathy Suite Sky Villa\\u201d at the Palms Casino Resort in Las Vegas \\u2014 the most expensive hotel room in the world, featuring formaldehyde-preserved sea animals and a transparent bar filled with medical waste.\", \"Such concepts don\\u2019t float through popular culture at random. They come when they are needed most. Interest in mindfulness, for instance, grew as the popularization of the smartphone fractured our focus. Similarly, the rapid rise of empathy \\u2014 at least as a word you might see inscribed on a river-rock keychain or kitchen poster \\u2014 paralleled the bifurcations of the Trump presidency. It\\u2019s as if the word spent the era expanding into a mantra of secular transcendence, some spirit of better angel, containing all that is good and bonding and human.\", \"Williams is one of many celebrities to have jumped into this cultural current. Back in the early 2000s, he started a streetwear label called Billionaire Boys Club, a name shared with a notorious 1980s Ponzi scheme; in 2013, he co-wrote the Robin Thicke hit \\u201cBlurred Lines,\\u201d which was criticized by feminists for its \\u201crapiness.\\u201d Now he sells goods under the brand name Humanrace, \\u201cin the belief that taking better care of ourselves can teach us to take better care of each other,\\u201d and talks about having his \\u201cmind opened up\\u201d by reactions to the Thicke song and realizing \\u201chow it could make someone feel.\\u201d From a branding perspective, his Masterclass makes perfect sense.\", \"But from most other perspectives, it\\u2019s a strange offering. For one thing, its takeaway tends to be disappointingly self-serving. In his second lesson, Williams describes how his solo hit \\u201cHappy\\u201d made him a less selfish person \\u2014 because he\\u2019d made a song that made others genuinely happy, and then watched as it became hugely successful. Gloria Steinem talks about starting Ms. Magazine as an act of empathy. The ultramarathon runner and Peloton executive Robin Arz\\u00f3n tells of a sudden diabetes diagnosis that did not stop her from running an important race, and how this inspired other diabetics. Much of what\\u2019s described seems to climax with personal achievement, rather than anything having to do with others.\", \"Self-actualization is, of course, different from empathy. And while some forms of empathy are surely teachable \\u2014 there are books, meditations, soup kitchens, hospices and family members that offer great opportunities for empathetic practice \\u2014 it feels very unlikely that watching impressive people talk about their lives is going to do it. The selling point here seems to be more about comfort and validation. The course is as cozy as reading a picture book about Ruth Bader Ginsburg to a child at bedtime, as righteous as planting an \\u201cIN THIS HOUSE WE BELIEVE NO HUMAN IS ILLEGAL\\u201d sign on an upscale suburban lawn overlooked by security cameras. It presents a cast of thoughtful, optimistic, largely Black and brown figures patting their assembled audience on the back, in effect assuring them that, yes, they are on the right side of history, part of the solution, just for paying to be there.\", \"Perhaps the course could be a gateway to action for some, in the same way that watching a baking show might make them hungry for cake. But mainly, what this Masterclass offers is a chance to feel nearer to the people whose shoes we\\u2019d already love to be standing in. It has less to say about any of the shoes that might be tougher to imagine walking in, the ones that actually need filling.\"]","href_hash":"9c97964c5cc811ec9d251f7281e97d2c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9c97964c5cc811ec9d251f7281e97d2c"}},
