Greg Gianforte said. But wildlife advocates warned of overhunting if protections are lifted.\", \"Northwest Montana has the largest concentration of grizzlies in the Lower 48 states, with more than 1,000 bears across Glacier National Park and nearby expanses of forested wilderness, an area known as the Northern Continental Divide Ecosystem.\", \"In March, U.S. government scientists said the region's grizzlies are biologically recovered, but need continued protection under the Endangered Species Act because of human-caused bear deaths and other pressures.\", \"Hunting of grizzlies is banned in the U.S. outside Alaska.
