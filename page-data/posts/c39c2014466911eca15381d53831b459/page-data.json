Chokshi, the city\\u2019s health commissioner, provided it has been at least six months since their second shot of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccine, or at least two months since they received the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot.\", \"\\u201cClinicians should allow adult patients to determine their own risk of exposure based on their individual circumstances,\\u201d said Dr. Chokshi.\", \"Federal regulators currently allow booster shots for people who are 65 and older, as well as adults who live in long-term care settings, have underlying medical conditions, or work or live in high-risk settings. Last week, Pfizer and BioNTech requested that the Food and Drug Administration expand eligibility of their booster to all adults.\", \"\\u201cFor qualifying for a booster, if you\\u2019re over 18, one of the specific criteria is being at higher risk and I view all New Yorkers, because of the density of our city, of being at higher risk,\\u201d said Dr. Mitchell Katz, the head of the city\\u2019s public hospitals.\", \"A growing body of early global research has shown that the vaccines available in the United States have remained highly protective against the disease\\u2019s worst outcomes over time.\", \"But a number of published studies show that their protection against infection, with or without symptoms, has fallen. Public health experts say it does not mean the vaccines are not working. But the significance of waning effectiveness \\u2014 and whether it suggests that all adults should be eligible for a booster \\u2014 is still up for debate.\", \"Mayor Bill de Blasio and Dr. Chokshi encouraged New Yorkers and health providers to interpret the current federal guidelines more loosely to allow more adults to get the booster now. More than 630,000 New Yorkers have already received a booster shot, Dr. Chokshi said Monday.\", \"The move is part of an effort to slow the spread of the virus before the winter and ahead of the holiday season, when spending more time indoors amid dropping temperatures may increase exposure.\", \"In New York City, new cases have increased recently, according to a New York Times database: The average of daily cases stood at 1,074 as of Sunday, which is 32 percent higher than it was two weeks ago. Average hospitalizations have fallen 17 percent over the same time period.\", \"The city\\u2019s encouragement comes after California, Colorado and New Mexico have broadened access to boosters.\", \"On Monday afternoon, Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York echoed city leaders\\u2019 pleas. \\u201cI am strongly encouraging all New Yorkers who live or work in a high-risk setting to get the booster,\\u201d she said in a statement. \\u201cI received the booster, and believe no one who feels they are at risk should be turned away from getting a Covid-19 booster shot.\\u201d\", \"In Arkansas, Gov. Asa Hutchinson said on Monday that he had directed the state health department to issue new guidelines on boosters to allow all adults to get one, provided they meet the timing rules.\", \"In an statement, a spokeswoman for the department said it had updated its recommendations and would be advising health care providers that they can administer the boosters to adults.\", \"\\u201cWhat we\\u2019re finding is that we want more people to get their booster shot and that this is somewhat confusing and limiting as to the eligibility of those that ought to be getting their booster shot and so in consultation with the Department of Health, this, we\\u2019re changing that,\\u201d Mr. Hutchinson said.\", \"If federal regulators sign off on Pfizer and BioNTech\\u2019s request, it would make official what health authorities say they already see happening frequently \\u2014 that many people appear to be getting boosters whether or not they are technically eligible. In mid-August, President Biden announced plans to make boosters available to all adults, but the beginning of the campaign was delayed after regulators insisted they needed more time to review data.\", \"On the news show \\u201cFox News Sunday,\\u201d Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, said that \\u201cmillions of people are eligible who have not yet gotten their booster shot, and we want to focus on that.\\u201d He also acknowledged that some states were seeking \\u201cbroad protection\\u201d for their residents in making their own moves, and that the F.D.A. will weigh in after analyzing the data and ensuring that the booster shots are safe and effective for those not yet eligible.\", \"Dr. Chokshi also advised health care providers to continue reaching out to vulnerable populations about booster shots, especially those who are 65 and older, those who have underlying medical conditions, and those who received a Johnson & Johnson vaccine.\"]","href_hash":"c39c2014466911eca15381d53831b459"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c39c2014466911eca15381d53831b459"}},
