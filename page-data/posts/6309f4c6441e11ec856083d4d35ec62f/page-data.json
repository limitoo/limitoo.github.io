counts of contempt of Congress after defying\\u00a0a congressional subpoena from the House committee investigating the insurrection at the US\\u00a0Capitol.\", \"The Justice Department said on Friday local time Mr Bannon, 67, was indicted on one count for refusing to appear for a deposition and the other for refusing to provide documents in response to the committee's subpoena.\", \"It was not immediately clear when he would face court.\", \"It came\\u00a0as a second witness, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, defied a similar subpoena from the committee.\", \"The chairman of the panel, Mississippi representative\\u00a0Bennie Thompson, said he would recommend\\u00a0contempt charges against Mr Meadows next week.\", \"Attorney-General Merrick Garland said Mr Bannon's indictment reflected\\u00a0the Justice Department's \\\"steadfast commitment\\\" to ensuring the department adhered to the rule of law.\", \"Each count carries a prison sentence of up to one\\u00a0year.\", \"Mr Bannon's attorney did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Joe Biden to waive privilege</div>\", \"This is not the first time Mr Bannon has been in legal peril.\", \"In August last year, he was pulled from a luxury yacht and arrested over\\u00a0allegations he and three associates ripped off donors trying to fund a southern border wall.\", \"Mr Trump later pardoned Mr Bannon in the final hours of his presidency.\", \"Mr Meadows had been in discussions with the committee since his subpoena was issued in September, but his lawyer said on Friday that Mr Meadows had\\u00a0a \\\"sharp legal dispute\\\" with the panel as Mr Trump had\\u00a0claimed executive privilege over the testimony.\", \"Mr Thompson had threatened contempt charges against Mr Meadows in a letter to the lawyer, George Terwilliger, on Thursday, saying if he failed to appear to answer the committee's questions it would be considered \\\"wilful non-compliance\\\".\", \"The committee would first have to vote on the contempt recommendation, then the full House would vote to send it to the Justice Department.\", \"Mr Meadows's refusal to comply comes amid escalating legal battles between the committee and Mr Trump, with the former president claiming\\u00a0privilege over documents and interviews the politicians are demanding.\", \"The White House said in a letter on Thursday that US President Joe Biden would waive any privilege that would prevent Mr Meadows from cooperating with the committee, prompting his lawyer to say Mr Meadows would not comply.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/d15559a1e534151bad68e6a7fd00379e\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows\\u00a0defied a similar subpoena from the committee.(AP: Patrick Semansky)</div>\", \"\\\"Legal disputes are appropriately resolved by courts,\\\" said the lawyer, George Terwilliger.\", \"\\\"It would be irresponsible for\\u00a0Meadows to prematurely resolve that dispute by voluntarily waiving privileges that are at the heart of those legal issues.\\\"\", \"As the sitting president, Mr Biden has so far waived most of Mr Trump's assertions of privilege over documents.\", \"US\\u00a0District Judge Tanya Chutkan has backed Mr Biden's position, noting in one ruling this week that \\\"presidents are not kings, and plaintiff is not president\\\".\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Three dozen people subpoenaed\\u00a0</div>\", \"The panel's proceedings and attempts to gather information have been delayed as Mr Trump has appealed against Judge\\u00a0Chutkan's rulings.\", \"On Thursday, a federal appeals court temporarily blocked the release of some of the White House records the panel is seeking, giving that court time to consider Mr Trump's arguments.\", \"The House panel is continuing its work\\u00a0and representatives have already interviewed more than 150 witnesses so far as they attempt to build the most comprehensive record yet of how a violent mob of Mr Trump's supporters broke into the Capitol and temporarily halted the certification of Mr Biden's victory.\", \"The committee has subpoenaed almost three dozen people, including former White House staffers, Trump allies who strategised about how to overturn his defeat, and people who organised the giant rally on the National Mall on January 6.\", \"While some, like Mr Meadows and Mr Bannon, have balked, others have spoken to the panel and provided documents.\", \"Mr Meadows, a former GOP congressman from North Carolina, is a key witness for the panel.\", \"He was Mr Trump's top aide in the time between Mr Trump's loss in the November election and the insurrection, and was one of several people who pressured state officials to try to\\u00a0overturn the results.\", \"He was also by Mr Trump's side during much of the time\\u00a0and he could provide information about what the former president was saying and doing during the attack.\", \"\\\"You were the president's chief of staff and have critical information regarding many elements of our inquiry,\\\" Mr Thompson wrote in a letter accompanying the September\\u00a023 subpoena to Mr Meadows.\", \"\\\"It appears you were with or in the vicinity of President Trump on January\\u00a06, had communications with the president and others on January 6 regarding events at the Capitol and are a witness regarding activities of that day.\\\"\",
