A gold one, at that. \\u00a0\", \"Jackson won the 500 meters Sunday with a time of 37.04 seconds, giving the American speedskating program its first speedskating medal of the Beijing Games and first individual medal since 2010.\", \"But this one meant much more than national pride.\", \"The 29-year-old Jackson, a former inline skater who switched to the ice shortly before the 2018 Pyeongchang Olympics, joined fellow American Shani Davis as the only Black athletes to win speedskating medals at the Olympics.\", \"The silver went to Miho Takagi of Japan, while Angelina Golikova of the Russian team took the bronze.\", \"Jackson's gold came after the native of balmy Ocala, Florida, slipped at the U.S. trials and shockingly finished third, putting her spot on the Olympic team in jeopardy.\", \"But teammate Brittany Bowe, who finished first at the trials, gave up her spot on the team to ensure Jackson would get to skate in Beijing.\", \"At the time, Jackson praised Bowe, calling her an \\\"amazing friend, teammate and mentor.\\\"\", \"\\\"This is an act I'll never forget,\\\" she wrote. \\\"You can bet I'll be the loudest voice in the oval cheering for her in the 1000 and 1500 next month.\\\"\", \"As it turned out, the Americans received a third place in the 500 when the final allocations were made, so Bowe got to skate as well. She finished 16th.\", \"Jackson skated in the next-to-last of 15 pairs with Takagi's time of 37.12 - set about a half-hour earlier in the fourth pairing - in her sights.\\u00a0If she was still thinking about that slip at the U.S. trials, it sure didn't show.\\u00a0Jackson bolted off the line and was under Takagi's time as she veered into the first turn. She kept up her speed through the crossing straight and into the final turn, swinging both arms furiously as she came to the finish of speedskating's shortest race.\\u00a0As soon as her skates crossed the line, Jackson's head turned toward the scoreboard.\\u00a0She broke into a big smile when she saw the \\\"1\\\" beside her name. Her coach, Ryan Shimabukuro, pumped his arms and slapped hands with her as she glided by.\\u00a0There was still one pairing left, but Jackson knew she could do no worse than bronze.\\u00a0A few minutes later, the gold was hers.\\u00a0Jackson sat on the padding along the infield, appearing to shed a few tears with her head bowed.\", \"\\u00a0She was no doubt reflecting, too, on her remarkable journey.\\u00a0The inline and roller derby skater knew she would have to trade her wheels for blades if she wanted to go for Olympic glory.\\u00a0Making the switch just months before the Pyeongchang Games, she was such a fast study that she earned a spot on the U.S. team. She finished 24th in the 500, but it was clear that she had barely tapped into her potential.\\u00a0During the current World Cup season, Jackson suddenly emerged as one of the world's best sprinters. She won four of eight 500 races - the first Black woman to earn one of those titles, as well - and came to the Olympics as one the favorites.\\u00a0She lived up to the billing in Beijing, becoming the first American woman to win an individual Olympic medal since 2002.\\u00a0She grabbed an American flag and did a victory lap around the Ice Ribbon oval, the stars and stripes fluttering above her head.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"c1337c7d8cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c1337c7d8cec11ec8b63ede4e8d1544d"}},
