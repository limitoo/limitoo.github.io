Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968, at the Lorraine Motel in downtown Memphis, drained all the life out of the surrounding urban center. Overnight, people and money fled to the eastern part of the county, far from the Mississippi River that defined the Bluff City.\", \"Russell Wigginton, who is now director of the National Civil Rights Museum, located in the former motel, said he didn\\u2019t venture downtown 10 times as an undergraduate at Rhodes College in Memphis during the mid-80s. \\u201cIt felt abandoned,\\u201d he recalled. \\u201cIt was not a place that felt inviting or safe, or that it was a place to wander without a destination.\\u201d\", \"The withering of the downtown district encapsulated the decline of the entire metropolis. Outside investors stayed away. Many Memphians \\u2014 Black and white \\u2014 said they lost confidence in the future. \\u201cThe assassination of King just killed us economically as well as morally,\\u201d said Pitt Hyde, the founder of the retail chain AutoZone and, with his wife, Barbara, the backer of the city\\u2019s leading philanthropic organization.\", \"With a steady pace that has escalated over the last five years, downtown has been pulsing back to vitality. Two ambitious new projects by leading architecture firms are at the forefront of the renaissance, using design to lift Memphis\\u2019s image in the eyes of its citizens and the outside world. In a city where the gap between rich and poor, white and Black, can seem to yawn as wide as the river, the architects behind the projects cite their ambition to bind Memphians together. The glass facade of the Memphis Brooks Museum of Art by Herzog & de Meuron, revealed for the first time this week in detailed renderings, will signal a welcoming storefront feel. Tom Lee Park, a green space overlooking the Mississippi, is being renewed by Jeanne Gang, of Studio Gang, with inviting pavilions, plantings and better access for families and older people.\", \"Still, naysayers worry that development will sap the soul of this majority-Black city, where W.C. Handy and B.B. King immortalized Beale Street as the home of the blues, and Elvis Presley hybridized blues and country in the form of rock \\u2019n\\u2019 roll. The fear is that an influx of money will turn a friendly, slightly sleepy place, in which the relative merits of rival barbecue joints is the favorite topic of conversation, into a version of Nashville, the hard-driving, corporate-heavy rival city to the east.\", \"The architects of the new museum and park, which are both several years from completion, are determined to overcome these misgivings. \\u201cIt\\u2019s much more than an art museum,\\u201d Ascan Mergenthaler, a partner at Herzog & de Meuron, said of the Brooks, speaking from the Basel home office of the firm that designed the Tate Modern and the Beijing Olympics \\u201cbird\\u2019s nest\\u201d stadium. \\u201cIt will also be a place for people to meet and engage with others and come together. The entire design is developed around the idea of a very inviting, open, permeable building. It is important that you see deep into it.\\u201d\", \"The museum is currently housed in a 105-year-old building with modern annexes in midtown Overton Park, removed from the urban core. The move downtown carries a message. \\u201cThe idea of being on the river is very powerful,\\u201d said Mark Resnick, acting executive director of the Brooks, who last June replaced Emily Ballew Neff, the driving force behind the relocation. \\u201cYou don\\u2019t want to be viewed simply as the Beaux-Arts palace in the park.\\u201d\", \"At Tom Lee Park, a short walk from the site where the new Brooks is scheduled to open in 2026, Gang, who is Chicago-based, is overseeing the redesign in collaboration with Kate Orff of SCAPE in New York. Both Gang and Orff expressed enthusiasm about reorienting the city to the river, which was long viewed as a place for commercial, not recreational, activities. \\u201cIt was exciting to think about reconnecting with it and making it accessible to all,\\u201d Gang said.\", \"Striding vigorously down a new winding path there, compliant with the Americans With Disabilities Act, from the light-rail line on the bluff to the river 30 feet below, Gang said, \\u201cWhat does accessibility to all mean? Not just physical accessibility. It is so that people view it as their waterfront, too. How can they be made to feel welcome?\\u201d\", \"There is a lot of history here to overcome. To the north of Tom Lee Park, another civic project is underway: the $10 million restoration of Cobblestone Landing, the largest stone-paved riverfront wharf in the country. Completed after the Civil War, it was used for unloading cotton and timber, but in earlier days, enslaved people were made to assemble there. A nearby thoroughfare was called Auction Avenue before it was renamed A.W. Willis Avenue, after the civil rights lawyer, in 2008. Parks that glorified the Confederacy leaders Jefferson Davis and Nathaniel Bedford Forrest have also been renamed, with statues of the two removed in 2017.\", \"And not all the past is distant. Until 1960, the Brooks admitted Black people only on \\u201cNegro Thursdays,\\u201d and the stigma lingers. \\u201cThere hasn\\u2019t been an acknowledgment of that time,\\u201d said Victoria Jones, executive director of Tone, a nonprofit organization that promotes Black artists in the African American neighborhood of Orange Mound. \\u201cThere\\u2019s this conversation that Black folks are allowed in, why aren\\u2019t they coming. There hasn\\u2019t been reconciliation or an effort to draw people in.\\u201d\", \"Jones paid her first visit to the Brooks as a college student fulfilling an assignment. \\u201cI was in that museum for two hours before I saw a painting with a Black face in it,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI thought, this space was never intended for me. I have no reason to want to come to the space if we haven\\u2019t acknowledged why I wasn\\u2019t wanted at that space.\\u201d\", \"Tom Lee Park, a 30-acre grass strip with little shade that stretches a mile down the river, commemorates an African American worker who in 1925 rescued on his small motorboat 32 passengers from a capsized steamer. In 1954, two years after his death, the park was renamed for him. A bronze statue that represents Lee pulling a survivor to safety went up in 2006.\", \"But the park has been underused. An annual high-profile music fair and barbecue festival, Memphis in May, keeps it off-limits to the public for about 40 days of the nicest weather. For much of the rest of the year, the park is an inhospitable scruffy lawn. Orff\\u2019s landscape team will plant trees to bring shady relief and add contoured hills. A major part of the budget will go to soil remediation. \\u201cTom Lee is a place that is so exposed and windswept and hot and sunny, if you\\u2019re there on a July day, you are there for five minutes and then you are running for shade,\\u201d Orff said.\", \"Festival leaders opposed the design, arguing that the new topography would curtail their activities. But the group submitted to arbitration. Three grassy fields were preserved for events. Still, Jim Holt, the president and chief executive of Memphis in May, said, \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to cause a dramatic reduction of our usable space and capacity.\\u201d\", \"The festival, which drew 200,000 in 2019, caters to the old-school Memphis establishment. \\u201cYour social status in the city of Memphis is directly correlated to the number of invitations you get to go to the various booths,\\u201d Holt said. For proponents of the park redesign, that is the problem. Some corporate teams can invest $50,000 in a barbecue booth. The music festival in 2019 charged $65 for a general admission day pass. \\u201cIt is very exclusive and expensive,\\u201d Tyree Daniels, a charter school board chair and investment banker, said. \\u201cWhat are we losing when we have to close the park for the entire month you want to be in the park? People don\\u2019t look at the significant impact it has on people who look like me.\\u201d\", \"Part of Orff\\u2019s efforts have gone to restoring the centrality of the park\\u2019s namesake. With the collaboration of the Chicago artist Theaster Gates, the team kept the statue of Tom Lee in mind while planning the park\\u2019s topography, which meanders and coalesces much like the Mississippi\\u2019s oxbows and wetlands. \\u201cWe want to pull people through the park and integrate the pedestal into the design,\\u201d Orff said. \\u201cSo you gradually find yourself at the same height as Tom Lee on his pedestal. It elevates you.\\u201d Gates is designing an outdoor seating area that will foster storytelling and guided walks to bring that point home.\", \"Memphis, with a poverty rate of almost 25 percent, struggles with an inferiority complex. Johnathan Martin, a photographer whose work has been acquired by the Brooks, said he questioned his worth after he was awarded subsidized artist housing downtown. \\u201cWhen I arrived at my apartment, I didn\\u2019t think I qualified, I didn\\u2019t think I deserved it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s internalized racism.\\u201d Many Memphians, when asked, seemed incredulous that so much money (through private donations and tax rebates) is being allocated to these projects: $120 million for the museum building, plus an additional $30 million for the endowment, and $61 million for the park redesign. (The Hydes, the major donors for each, contributed $20 million for the Brooks and $5 million for Tom Lee.)\", \"\\u201cIf we\\u2019re going to be a world-class city, we have to invest in world-class amenities,\\u201d said Paul Young, chief executive of the Downtown Memphis Commission. \\u201cBut we need to make sure as we design downtown that the amenities are open to everyone.\\u201d\", \"In both Tom Lee Park and the Brooks Museum, programming is key to expanding the audience. In a city that is 64 percent Black, \\u201cthere is no success that doesn\\u2019t robustly include Black people, Black neighborhoods, Black businesses,\\u201d said Carol Coletta, a city native who runs the Memphis River Parks Partnership, a nonprofit that oversees six miles of Mississippi riverfront comprising five parks, including Tom Lee. (Daniels is the partnership\\u2018s chair.) Studio Gang assembled focus groups of African American teenagers to gauge what amenities they would value there. The participants asked for basketball courts, barbecue grills, benches, exercise areas. \\u201cIt\\u2019s ordinary things that you\\u2019d find in any park,\\u201d Gang said. \\u201cBut putting them on the river elevates everyday activities and makes it something different.\\u201d\", \"Still, some Black Memphians view these initiatives skeptically. \\u201cI\\u2019m not convinced that that effort was authentic,\\u201d said Adriane Johnson-Williams, a management and education consultant. \\u201cWe do a lot of box-checking in Memphis. You say, \\u2018We\\u2019re going to talk to people,\\u2019 and you come out with the plan you had going in.\\u201d\", \"Placing African American leaders in positions of authority is slowly helping to win over the doubters. Daniels, at the Memphis River Parks Partnership, and Carl Person, the president of the Brooks, are leading figures in the city\\u2019s vibrant Black upper middle class. \\u201cThe new leadership of the museum has changed from two perspectives,\\u201d said Person, who assumed his position last January. \\u201cAn African American is president. That itself is a change. Now they\\u2019ve progressed enough that they have a diverse board and staff. And we are also changing through African American art we have and that we are in the process of acquiring.\\u201d\", \"Elliot Perry, a star basketball player for Memphis State who went on to the N.B.A. before retiring in 2002, started collecting African American art 25 years ago. He is actively advising the Brooks on acquisitions. \\u201cIf people come in and see art that looks like them, that makes a huge difference,\\u201d he said. Barbara Hyde, the philanthropist, concurred. \\u201cI think it would be amazing if Memphis became a destination for people interested in the art of the African diaspora,\\u201d she said.\", \"During her job interview at the Brooks Museum, Rosamund Garrett, then an old masters specialist at the Courtauld Gallery in London, was asked to recommend a new acquisition. She looked for a depiction of Balthazar or St. Maurice, two Africans who are portrayed in Renaissance art, and found a Balthazar made in Antwerp about 1515 that was modeled on a Black freeman. The painting was for sale in a Mayfair gallery.\", \"The picture now hangs at the Brooks, where Garrett, hired as its chief curator, is reinstalling the collection \\u201cto be radically honest and radically transparent,\\u201d she said, and \\u201cto think about where the museum is equitable and where it isn\\u2019t.\\u201d She analyzed the museum\\u2019s holdings and found that 7.6 percent were by women artists, compared to the national museum average of 14 percent. She is seeking to rectify that.\", \"A recently endowed fellowship to support a curator who would stage an exhibition on an African American artist resulted in a show last summer of Elizabeth Catlett\\u2019s linoleum-cut prints of Black women, which had been languishing in museum storage. Black Memphians thronged to see the exhibition, organized by Heather Nickels, the fellow. But for some, the enthusiasm was tinged with bitterness. \\u201cThe anger was that how do you have this for 20 years in a Black city and never show them?\\u201d Johnson-Williams, the management consultant, explained. \\u201cAlso gratitude that someone showed up and finally did it. It\\u2019s evidence that the museum is trying to be a museum for all of Memphis.\\u201d\", \"And not just for African Americans. The museum has partnered with local L.G.B.T.Q. organizations for an exhibition of photographs that Mark Seliger took of transgender people on New York\\u2019s Christopher Street. The Brooks is also eager to collaborate with the National Civil Rights Museum and with the Cossitt Library next door. The first Southern library to be desegregated, the Cossitt is now undergoing a renovation. It reopens at the end of the year with studios to record videos and podcasts, a cafe and a new collection of books with an emphasis on African American history. Like the Brooks, the library, which was white-only until 1960, is courting a broader audience.\", \"The cultural boom downtown is echoed by a flurry of commercial construction. \\u201cToday it\\u2019s the hottest real-estate area in town,\\u201d Hyde said. On the east end, a mixed-use development christened The Walk and budgeted at almost $1 billion has begun clearing an 11-acre blighted site.\", \"Alongside the Mississippi, another developer, Chance Carlisle, the 37-year-old scion of a wealthy Memphis family, is constructing three Hyatt hotels. (The first one is already open.) A neighboring upscale rental building, The Landings Residences, was thought to be too expensive for downtown. All 232 units have been rented, Carlisle said, and tenants range from doctors to bartenders. \\u201cYou can get something for $1,200 to $1,500,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s still dirt cheap.\\u201d But for the majority of Memphians, $1,200 in monthly rent for a 450-square foot studio is far from dirt cheap.\", \"Carlisle extolled the Brooks and Tom Lee Park redesigns. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t undercut the importance of what it is like to have great museums and parks,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s how you grow a middle class.\\u201d He added that \\u201cdowntown is everybody\\u2019s neighborhood.\\u201d But South City, a Memphis neighborhood that is Tennessee\\u2019s poorest ZIP code, is only six blocks away. Whether the people who live there regard downtown as theirs is still an open question.\", \"\\u201cThere is already the clear drumbeat that what\\u2019s going on downtown isn\\u2019t for us,\\u201d Johnson-Williams said. \\u201cThe cost of housing is too much for the wages here. Too expensive to live there, nothing being built for us. We can\\u2019t be Nashville, we don\\u2019t want to be Nashville. Stop building all these things for rich white people. When the proportion of white people goes up, the proportion of Black people goes down.\\u201d\", \"What she is decrying is not the typical story of gentrification and displacement, because virtually no one was living in the downtown areas that are now being developed. It is the vague anxiety that what makes the city special \\u2014 a culture world-famous for its music and barbecue \\u2014 might be lost.\", \"Other African American Memphians are less fearful. \\u201cDowntown Memphis is never going to feel like downtown Nashville,\\u201d Wigginton said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s still going to be kind of funky down here. You\\u2019re not going to be more than two or three blocks away from the reality of most people in the world. It\\u2019s still very reasonable to live here. I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s ever going away.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b71e3b293e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b71e3b293e1811ecb8510f28b00ffebd"}},
