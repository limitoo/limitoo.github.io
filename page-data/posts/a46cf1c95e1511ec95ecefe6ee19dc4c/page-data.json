'No legislative act,'\\u00a0 wrote Alexander Hamilton in Federalist No. 78, 'contrary to the Constitution, can be valid.' The court in Hubbard v. Lowe reinforced this truth: 'That an unconstitutional statute is not a law at all is a proposition no longer open to discussion.' 226 F. 135, 137 (SDNY 1915), appeal dismissed, 242 U.S. 654 (1916).\\u00a0 Following this rationale, an unconstitutionally appointed elector, like an unconstitutionally enacted statute, is no elector at all.'\\\"\", \"Meadows had cooperated up to a point with the select committee, handing over some emails and text messages, but he stopped sharing documents and refused to sit for a deposition last week.

The department last month indicted Steve Bannon, whom the House had found in contempt on the same charge.

Lawmakers were sent fleeing amid the riot, which led to the deaths of five people and the arrests of hundreds more. Trump, who encouraged his supporters to \\\"walk over\\\" to the Capitol during the Stop the Steal rally, was impeached by the House one week later for inciting the riot but was later acquitted by the Senate.\\u00a0\", \"CBS News reporter covering the House.\"]","href_hash":"a46cf1c95e1511ec95ecefe6ee19dc4c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a46cf1c95e1511ec95ecefe6ee19dc4c"}},
