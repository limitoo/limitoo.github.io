But he does have his eye on something big.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-05T15:53:25.000Z","content":"[\"Kamaru Usman, one of the fiercest men on the planet, is content with the level of fame he has achieved in this bloody sport of mixed martial arts.\", \"In his profession of violently battering other fighters, Usman said he does not want to reach an upper echelon of celebrity. If he does, it may inhibit him from riding down water slides and amusement attractions with his daughter.\", \"For about one minute, Usman (19-1), the Ultimate Fighting Championship\\u2019s welterweight champion, thought out loud about whether he would enjoy elevated stardom. In mixed martial arts circles, he is revered as one of the best. Since becoming the 170-pound champion in 2019, he has defended the belt four times \\u2014 three of those fights ending by knockout. But his r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 has not generated the mainstream stardom Conor McGregor and Ronda Rousey received. He is OK with that.\", \"Last year, Usman said he took his 7-year-old daughter, Samirah, to a water park, and he appreciated that relatively few people interrupted him for selfies and autographs. Still, during other instances, Usman said fans in different cities in the last eight months approached him at restaurants, so much so that his daughter asked, \\u201c\\u2018Daddy, why do people want to take pictures with you?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"This middle tier of recognition, Usman said, is where he would like to stay.\", \"\\u201cI wrestle with that every day,\\u201d Usman said in an interview. \\u201cI understand this level of fame and I understand that there are levels above this. I don\\u2019t think I want to reach certain levels.\\u201d\", \"On Saturday, he may not have a choice. A stellar performance against rival Colby Covington (16-2) at U.F.C. 268 at Madison Square Garden will undeniably thrust him further into the spotlight, and perhaps set up Usman's desired crossover event with boxer Sa\\u00fal \\u00c1lvarez, who also fights Saturday on a pay-per-view card in Las Vegas.\", \"Usman and Covington headline a stacked card with another championship bout, the women's strawweight champion Rose Namajunas facing Zhang Weili, and a lightweight No. 1 contender fight with Justin Gaethje and Michael Chandler. It\\u2019s the U.F.C.\\u2019s first event in New York since the Covid-19 pandemic began and is filled with fights that will impact multiple divisions.\", \"Usman and Covington fought in December 2019, in Usman\\u2019s first title defense after stripping the belt from Tyron Woodley. It was a competitive back-and-forth battle rife with subjective controversies. The referee, Marc Goddard, temporarily stopped the fight twice \\u2014 once in the second round and once in the third \\u2014 for a shot near Usman\\u2019s groin and an eye poke that Covington claims Usman exaggerated. At the end of the third round, Usman landed a hard punch to Covington\\u2019s jaw. Covington fought through the injury for two more rounds.\", \"Usman in the fifth round threw a straight right that sent Covington to the canvas. He got up quickly, but Usman followed with another powerful punch that again forced Covington to the ground. As Usman laid sprawled on Covington and delivered punches to his head, Goddard ended the fight, a stoppage Covington disagreed with because he said he was still defending himself.\", \"\\u201cHe knows who daddy is, he knows who really won that fight,\\u201d Covington said at a news conference, an event where he noticeably drew a large and loud fan base. \\u201cIf he didn\\u2019t fake timeouts in the first fight, I would have destroyed him.\\u201d\", \"The buildup to their last fight was hostile, and the feelings intensified since. After Covington finished Woodley via technical knockout in September 2020, the Usman and Covington participated in a heated television interview.\", \"\\u201cI broke your face,\\u201d Usman said.\", \"\\u201cWait until I see you next time,\\u201d Covington screamed. \\u201cYou\\u2019re dead.\\u201d\", \"Covington latched himself onto the former President Donald J. Trump, and consistently wears \\u201cMake America Great Again\\u201d hats. Trump called him after his fight with Woodley to congratulate him, and the fighter insulted the Black Lives Matter movement at a news conference. Covington also took a picture with Trump in the Oval Office. Covington has said his theatrics and political leanings has made him a more interesting fighter than Usman. Usman disagrees.\", \"\\u201cI know the persona and the facade that he puts out to the rest of the world and that\\u2019s not my lane,\\u201d Usman said.\", \"\\u201cEven Trump doesn\\u2019t really rock with him like that,\\u201d he added. \\u201cHe knows who the true winner is. I guarantee you Trump likes me more as a fighter than he likes that guy.\\u201d\", \"Usman recently became the U.F.C.\\u2019s top-ranked pound-for-pound fighter, a distinction he earned after the Las Vegas police arrested Jon Jones in September after a domestic violence incident. Jones, the former light-heavyweight champion, had not fought in more than a year partly because of a disagreement with his contract as he transitioned to heavyweight.\", \"It reinforced a problem the U.F.C. continually experiences with retaining dependable, marketable stars for mainstream audiences. McGregor, the flashy Irishman and the highest-grossing fighter in U.F.C. history, has lost three of his last four fights since 2018, and has faced legal troubles in the United States and Ireland, including a lawsuit in Ireland alleging he sexually assaulted a woman.\", \"Rousey, considered a pioneer for women\\u2019s mixed martial arts, retired from the sport after only two losses, defeats that clearly drained her confidence. Usman said he respects the ability to be a U.F.C. champion and a face of the company, but would rather continue in his current promotional status.\", \"\\u201cEvery time you hear about Conor, it\\u2019s \\u2018Conor did this to this person, Conor did that, Conor is getting sued,\\u2019\\u201d Usman said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a double-edged sword. It gets to a certain point where it\\u2019s too much, and I don\\u2019t think I want to be in that place.\\u201d\", \"Usman said he would next like to fight the boxer Sa\\u00fal \\u00c1lvarez, known as Canelo, if he defeats Covington because it would be a fan-favorite fight. None of the other welterweight contenders enticed him, he said, and a crossover event with \\u00c1lvarez, the top pound-for-pound fighter in boxing, would align with the continued blurred lines of combat sports. \\u00c1lvarez if fighting Caleb Plant in Las Vegas on Saturday night.\", \"If that crossover bout does not happen, Usman would just like to go to more water parks.\", \"\\u201cNo one else really motivates me to get up at 6 a.m. and train \\u2014 I\\u2019d rather just spend time with my daughter,\\u201d Usman said. \\u201cHave you ever seen the two best pound-for-pound fighters in their sports compete at their primes? That\\u2019s motivation right there.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"6dcbc5703e5011ecba5fa11a6fd972b7"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6dcbc5703e5011ecba5fa11a6fd972b7"}},
