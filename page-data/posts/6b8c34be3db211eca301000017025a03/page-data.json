(New episodes debut Thursdays at 10 p.m. on FXX.)\", \"Individual episodes of the comedy collage series \\u201cCake\\u201d feel a little like the heyday of Channel 101 \\u2014 segments are quick, surprising, artistically daring and often very funny. Many of the sketches are installments of short-form serialized stories, though, so marathoning several episodes of \\u201cCake\\u201d is a richer experience for those who thrive on ongoing sagas. This season\\u2019s recurring cartoons, \\u201cPoorly Drawn Lines\\u201d and \\u201cSwan Boy,\\u201d are clever and distinctive, and even brief interstitials on the show are sometimes dazzlingly surreal. If you\\u2019ve ever treasured an online video that made you laugh but also filled you with ennui because you knew somehow none of your friends would find it funny, and there are parts of your life defined by this tension between bliss and isolation, uh \\u2026 watch this.\", \"\\u2018The Oratorio: A Documentary with Martin Scorsese\\u2019 and \\u2018Da Ponte\\u2019s Oratorio: A Concert For New York\\u2019\", \"When to watch: Friday at 9 and 10 p.m., on PBS. (Check local listings.)\", \"In 1826, the performance of an oratorio in New York City helped popularize opera in the United States, and the tale of just how that piece came to be staged in St. Patrick\\u2019s Old Cathedral, in what\\u2019s now Little Italy, could probably be an opera itself. Instead, it\\u2019s this affectionate documentary. Martin Scorsese and others unpack the overlapping histories of artistry, Catholicism and Italian culture in Manhattan, and the wild biographical details of the figures in the original production are enough to keep a history hound happy for weeks. In a triumph of contextualization, the special is followed by the 2018 restaging of the oratorio.\", \"\\u2018For All Mankind\\u2019\", \"When to watch: Now, on Apple TV+.\", \"If you\\u2019re in the market for something substantive and thoughtful but cannot stomach another murder show, or if you\\u2019re tired of slow high-end series in which it feels as if nothing really happens, watch this alternate history space-race drama and enjoy the ride. Impatient viewers should skip ahead and start with Episode 3, \\u201cNixon\\u2019s Women,\\u201d which is essentially \\u201cA League of Their Own\\u201d but for astronauts, and from there the show quickly builds its narrative momentum. I will caution you that many episodes end on semi-cliffhangers, so the urge to watch \\u201cjust one more\\u201d is dangerously powerful.\"]","href_hash":"6b8c34be3db211eca301000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6b8c34be3db211eca301000017025a03"}},
