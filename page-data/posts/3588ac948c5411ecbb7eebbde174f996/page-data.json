This was a curious development. Mere weeks earlier, I had purchased my own copy on eBay for $19.90, which isn\\u2019t cheap for a used book \\u2014 but it\\u2019s not $50! I had to wonder whether the recommendation had led to an eBay price hike. This was not my intention.\", \"A sinister thought then occurred to me. \\u201cIf I were an unsavory person, I could make a big lump of dough by recommending old books and then turning around and selling copies on eBay for exorbitant prices under a false user name.\\u201d Don\\u2019t worry; I\\u2019m not evil, and I don\\u2019t want to get fired from my job for executing an easily traceable pump-and-dump scheme. (Not YET, at least.)\", \"But @RidgewoodJoe did raise a valuable point. One problem with recommending \\u201chidden gems\\u201d is that they can be \\u2026 hard to find. My hope is that these books can be unearthed at libraries, where gems often linger in the dust. A second hope is that a savvy publisher might take note of such titles and move quickly to reissue the book in question. (This happened once before, and it was very exciting!) A third option would be to put that $50 book on your back-burner list and wait until the market cools down.\", \"I wish I could craft a system wherein my own copy of each book, complete with self-incriminating marginalia, might be mailed free to the first person who comments with a request. But I live a mile away from the nearest post office, and as much as I cherish that institution, my patience for standing in 90-minute lines is nearing an all-time low.\", \"All of which is to say, if anyone has ideas for making out-of-print books more widely obtainable: I\\u2019m all ears. Meantime, I\\u2019ll try to stick to books that won\\u2019t destroy your wallet.\", \"\\u2014Molly\", \"Fiction, 1962\", \"This rec goes out to all my lesbian zoologists. Make some noise, ladies! Before the rest of you skip forward, I should quickly offer myself as proof that you needn\\u2019t meet the above description to savor this silvery, suggestive novella of love and friendship.\", \"The year is 1944, the place is London, and all the young men are at war. We find ourselves at Horsham Science College with a group of women who spend their time dissecting mammals and navigating material privations (bombs go off, pipes freeze) and emotional detonations (ruptured affairs, thwarted t\\u00eate-\\u00e0-t\\u00eates).\", \"It\\u2019s a bleakly cinematic book, full of unkempt gardens and smoky cafes. The author, a physician of Chinese and Belgian descent, became famous after publishing \\u201cA Many-Splendored Thing,\\u201d which was adapted into the William Holden movie. But I think this little novella, which she wrote 10 years after her megahit, is much better!\", \"Read if you like: Sally Rooney, E.M.

You heard me, Michael Keaton. What makes this so special?\\u201d\", \"I\\u2019ll tell you. The journalist Evan Hughes has selected an under-examined nook of the crisis for his contribution. Rather than focusing on the machinations of Big Pharma, he zeros in on a start-up named Insys Therapeutics, which developed and marketed a fentanyl spray that was intended for cancer patients but \\u201csomehow\\u201d found its way into the hands of patients suffering from, for example, moderate back pain.\", \"\\u201cThe Hard Sell\\u201d asks (and answers) the question of how this happened. Part of the answer lies in org charts. Hughes shows how Insys constructed a bureaucratic system that allowed each component of the company to blame someone else for malfeasance, in a never-ending ouroboros of buck-passing: The sales reps blamed the managers, the managers blamed the executives, the executives blamed the sales reps and the doctors, the doctors blamed the sales reps, everyone blamed the F.D.A. and so on.\", \"Read if you like: Michael Lewis, procedurals, the Michael Mann film \\u201cThe Insider,\\u201d Jane MayerAvailable from: Penguin Random House\", \"Sign up for Read Like the Wind\", \"Plunge further into books at The New York Times\", \"See past editions of Read Like the Wind\", \"Friendly reminder: Check your local library for books!
