Appeals were rejected.\", \"\\\"I couldn't pay rent for two weeks, I had to do something,\\\" Santos told Stuff earlier this week. \\\" I didn't receive a wage subsidy and that\\u2019s why I needed to do something for my family. I wish I hadn't done this, but it is too late.\\\"\", \"He said he's been to church every week since asking for forgiveness, but Immigration declined his appeals because he didn't have exceptional circumstances. He works full-time on building sites, and his wife is a nurse.\\u00a0\", \"Auckland Action Against Poverty (AAAP) said the punishment was \\\"extremely over the top\\\", considering his income was halved during the alert level 4 restrictions.\\u00a0\", \"\\u201cHe did what he needed to do in order to survive. Feeding your family shouldn\\u2019t be a crime and he\\u2019s done nothing wrong,\\\" said coordinator Brooke Pao Stanley.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"They've already set up a life for themselves in Aotearoa and they deserve to stay. The Philippines has one of the strictest military lockdowns in the world, it\\u2019s hard to find work there and having to relocate on Christmas Day is an extra kick in the face.\\\"\", \"AAAP said Immigration Minister Kris Faafoi should intervene to stop the family's deportation. But Faafoi isn't responding to media - emails to his office come back with a message that it's closed until January 10.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"All media queries will be responded to by a staff member in the new year,\\\" it reads.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Minister Faafoi has an opportunity to ensure his legacy won\\u2019t include deporting families who struggled throughout a pandemic on Christmas Day,\\\" Green MP Ricardo Men\\u00e9ndez March said in a tweet.\", \"\\\"Kris Faafoi is claiming that Phil Twyford (his associate minister) chose not to intervene and so he won\\u2019t review the Santos\\u2019 family case. But how could one not see that Twyford made the wrong decision by not allowing the Santos family to stay?\", \"\\\"It pains me to see the Santos family feeling like they have to profusely and publicly apologise for trying to feed their children. They were not in the wrong. It was our safety net systems that set them up to fail by criminalising their survival.\\\"\", \"Santos told Stuff he intends to come back when he legally can in about five years' time, his current boss saying a job will be waiting for him.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I will come back as a new Jeffrey, not a silly Jeffrey. It is a big lesson to learn. Honesty is the best policy.\\\"\", \"\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"329c1334642e11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"329c1334642e11ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
