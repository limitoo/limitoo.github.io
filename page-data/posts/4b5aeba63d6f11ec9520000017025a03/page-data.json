Gavin Newsom has asked us to reduce water consumption by 15 percent. Yet in August, the most recent month for which data is available, we\\u2019d brought usage down just 5 percent compared with the same time last year.\", \"Of course, not all water-saving is the responsibility of California households. Eighty percent of California\\u2019s water goes toward agriculture, and other businesses play a big role too.\", \"But that doesn\\u2019t mean we can\\u2019t conserve more \\u2014 and many of us seem to be trying. You wrote to me about letting your cars get dusty and your lawns turn brown and collecting cold shower water to boil pasta and fill your dog\\u2019s bowl.\", \"The state offers these simple water conservation tips, and below I\\u2019ve shared some of the more creative ones you sent me:\", \"\\u201cEasy to save water by showering every other day, and taking shorter showers. No reason we need showers every single day unless we are totally covered with dirt due to jobs. And that doesn\\u2019t apply to a lot of people.\\u201d \\u2014 Amy Skewes-Cox, Ross\", \"\\u201cMy husband and I switched to a \\u2018If it\\u2019s yellow, let it mellow\\u2019 rule in our house and have been very pleasantly surprised with how effective it is at reducing water consumption. It\\u2019s so much more impactful than watering our lawn less, taking shorter showers and doing fewer loads of laundry.\\u201d \\u2014 Meredith Alcala, Alameda\", \"\\u201cWe are installing a laundry-to-landscape greywater system. Instead of using sprinklers to irrigate our 75-foot blue Atlas cedar, 75-foot redwood and three smaller redwoods, we will be watering them every time we do laundry.\\u201d \\u2014 Roger Bergman, Santa Barbara\", \"\\u201cWe started keeping a sizable metal bowl in the bottom of our kitchen sink. When we wash fruits or vegetables or rinse something off with just water, we capture the water and use it on our container plants. So the more fruits and vegetables we eat, the more we grow!\\u201d \\u2014 Jessica Koning, Big Sur\", \"\\u201cI bought a shower clock. I am amazed at how helpful it is. I note the time as soon as I turn on the water and I try to shower as fast as I can.\\u201d \\u2014 Diane E. Johnson, Mission Viejo\", \"\\u201cMy boys (13, 16) don\\u2019t love that we urge them to take on-off showers, but they do it. Strange that a 13-year-old would even be aware of our drought. Growing up in the Bay Area, I certainly had no idea of the California water situation when I was that young.\\u201d \\u2014 Hunter Hubby, Berkeley\", \"\\u201cWe have been in California for 36 years and, from the very beginning, have been meticulously careful with our water usage knowing we were now living in a semi-desert land. We use a bowl in the kitchen sink where all water goes, emptying it on the plants many times a day. We use the dishwasher every six days, wear most clothing longer between washes, gave up the swimming pool and lawns many years ago, changed many plants to those that don\\u2019t need much water, use much less water on the garden, flush the toilet less frequently, and do \\u2018up and downer\\u2019 body washes in between less frequent showers. We don\\u2019t smell!!\", \"It\\u2019s going to be hard for us to cut back 15 percent from our water usage with the way we already conserve. We will do our very best to help save this beautiful state.\\u201d \\u2014 Rosalind Roberts, Los Gatos\", \"For more:\", \"Slow cooker mushroom and wild rice soup.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip comes from Lynn Beldner, who recommends the city of Woodland in the Central Valley:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.
