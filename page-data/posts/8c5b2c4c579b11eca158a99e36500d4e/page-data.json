I easily dispatched silver, jewelry and war medals, but I struggled with those fake-leather photo albums that showed my dashing father, then sober, beaming at his pudgy grandchild; my proud mother, eyes frightened, stiffly posing at a poker table with my father\\u2019s leering military buddies; my 6-year-old self, refusing to look at the camera on the first Christmas after my parents\\u2019 divorce. Decades later, staring dumbly at this catalog of distress, I somehow softened, seeing only clumsiness. We really had done our best. \\u2014 Melissa Beckham\", \"I was in his living room again. After a six-month relationship and multiple stints of reconciliation, I was standing behind him, twisting his hair into starter locs. Hair was always a topic for us. I often wore mine naturally in a curly Afro. He grew his out. We compared lengths and joked about the frequency with which I switched up hairstyles. But that night, as I sectioned his hair into little twists, I was given some permanence: Every time he\\u2019d get his locs retwisted, he\\u2019d remember my initial handiwork, even if our relationship didn\\u2019t work. \\u2014 Tierra Taylor\", \"I\\u2019ve had eczema all my life \\u2014 a huge and ever-present insecurity. One summer afternoon, when I was 15 and my cousin Carley was 8, we were sitting together on our grandparents\\u2019 couch when Carley pointed out a patch of eczema on my neck and asked if it itched. Embarrassed, I said yes and quickly changed the subject. Then, without saying a word, she started scratching it. I was taken aback. I expected disgust, or at least the sort of blunt, amusingly rude remark typical of children. But Carley wasn\\u2019t disgusted. Someone she loved had an itch, so she scratched it. \\u2014 Juliet Brown\", \"I had been on many socially distanced dates, but I hadn\\u2019t felt excited on any of them; I was just scared of getting sick. Then I met Maggie. We shared a bottle of wine in Prospect Park and watched the sunset. She made me laugh, and in those moments my anxiety would fade. I could enjoy being with her. \\u201cIs this your first?\\u201d she asked. \\u201cFirst what?\\u201d I replied. \\u201cYour first date with a woman,\\u201d she said, smiling. I nodded. Under the stars that night, I felt desire overshadow fear. \\u2014 Gabriela Josebachvili\"]","href_hash":"8c5b2c4c579b11eca158a99e36500d4e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8c5b2c4c579b11eca158a99e36500d4e"}},
