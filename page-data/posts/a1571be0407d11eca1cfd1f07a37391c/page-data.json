Who says democracy isn\\u2019t efficient?\", \"Bret Stephens: Defeat has a wonderful way of concentrating the political mind.\", \"Gail: You\\u2019ve always been a fan of the infrastructure bill, right? Any reservations on that front now that it\\u2019s going to be signed into law?\", \"Bret: As someone who occasionally drives the Pulaski Skyway in New Jersey \\u2014 gripping the wheel with both hands while idly wondering if a bridge that was built in the Hoover administration will hold for another five minutes or collapse into the Hackensack River \\u2014 I remain a committed fan of the infrastructure bill.\", \"Gail: Bridges of America, rejoice!\", \"You wrote a terrific column about the elections last week, Bret. Can\\u2019t say I agreed with all your conclusions but it was, as always, very smart. If you were on the phone with Nancy Pelosi today, what would you advise her to do next?\", \"Bret: First, madam speaker, please don\\u2019t hang up on me.\", \"Second, put the social spending bill in the basement ice box and don\\u2019t take it out until Democrats have the kind of majorities that can pass it.\", \"Third, look for a bipartisan win on immigration reform, starting with a trade on citizenship for Dreamers in exchange for more border security and a firm \\u201cRemain in Mexico\\u201d policy for migrants.\", \"And finally, find ways to separate the Democratic Party brand from Toxic Wokeness.\", \"Gail: I\\u2019m with President Biden that the next stop is his social spending program. Admittedly it\\u2019ll be carved down, but it has to include support for workers who temporarily need to stay home to take care of newborns or aging family members. And of course that universal preschool education.\", \"Bret: Maybe you\\u2019re right and over time those programs will prove wildly popular and successful. But I\\u2019m struggling to see how anything the Democrats are doing these days directly addresses the sorts of issues that average voters worry about day to day. Inflation is at a 30-year high, while personal incomes are down. Gas prices (at least where I live in the far suburbs) are close to $4 a gallon. Illegal crossings at the southern border are the highest they\\u2019ve been since at least 1960.\", \"Gail: As a person who very seldom attempts to justify her positions by pointing to the stock market I will refrain from noting that the Dow Jones rose on better-than-expected job numbers.\", \"Bret: Hehe. We should all enjoy this tulip mania while it lasts.\", \"Gail: And I\\u2019m with you on some of your immigration points \\u2014 certainly citizenship for Dreamers. As far as the message of the election goes, I think the biggest lesson for the Democrats after Virginia is not to run against Donald Trump unless Donald Trump is running. And to remember that when voters decide if they like their governor, they don\\u2019t necessarily think much about national issues.\", \"Bret: Also: Don\\u2019t infuriate that itty-bitty voting bloc known as \\u201cparents of school-age children.\\u201d\", \"But I also think Democrats need to take a step back and see the broader message of the election, which is that the party has shifted waaaaaaay too far to the left. How else did the Republican Ann Davison get elected city attorney in Seattle? Or the Republican Jack Ciattarelli nearly win the governor\\u2019s race in deep-blue New Jersey?\", \"Gail: For me, New Jersey was mainly about people yearning for a fresh face now and then. And in Seattle I guess you have a point \\u2014 if your message is that the voters shouldn\\u2019t have picked a candidate for city attorney who had once praised whoever had apparently set off explosives inside a police precinct. Duh.\", \"And local elections are \\u2026 local. Some of our Seattle readers were quick to point out that their mayor-elect was far from a traditional law-and-order candidate. That\\u2019s the guy who promised to \\u201cput Seattle on fire with our love.\\u201d\", \"Bret: True, though he was the least-leftist candidate in the race.\", \"Gail: Pretty clear that the future, for local government, lies in candidates who promise to reform the police while also giving them strong budgetary support. Our own incoming mayor Eric Adams comes to mind.\", \"Bret: Hope Adams can save the city. He\\u2019s got a big job ahead of him. The city hasn\\u2019t seemed so dirty in decades. There\\u2019s an infestation of giant rats. The other day I watched a drug deal go down on Eighth Avenue in sight of two cops who stood around pretending nothing was going on. (For the record, I was not part of the deal.) Addicts are shooting up near our office in broad daylight. All of this brought to you by the Worst-Mayor-Ever-From-The-Rosy-Fingered-Dawn-Till- The-Bitter-End-Of-Time-Bill-expletive deleted-de Blasio.\", \"Gail: Hehehehe. That would make a great nickname if de Blasio ever tried, God help us, to run for president again.\", \"Bret: Or governor! Also, many Americans don\\u2019t take well to being lectured on, say, MSNBC about how Glenn Youngkin\\u2019s win in Virginia is a sign of a racist white backlash when Virginians also elected a Republican, Winsome Sears, to become the first Black woman to serve as lieutenant governor.\", \"Gail: Well, the results from Virginia\\u2019s governor\\u2019s race were pretty normal given the state\\u2019s history of voting against the party of a new president. Looking at that, I didn\\u2019t make the racist backlash argument.\", \"However, I would say that given the Republicans\\u2019 crazed howling about teaching the history of racism in America, voters were being misled in the way they were being urged to think there was something wrong with the schools.\", \"Bret: We agree on teaching the history of racism. I\\u2019m less keen on using teachers to propagate the ideological legerdemain that goes by the name of \\u201cantiracism.\\u201d\", \"But leaving aside the policy issues themselves, all of these Democratic fixations are gifts to the populist right. Someone needs to start a \\u201cSanity Democrats\\u201d caucus to save the party from the progressive \\u201cJustice Democrats.\\u201d\", \"Gail: Certainly important for prominent Democrats not to sound didactic or obsessive when it comes to race and racism, but I sure as heck don\\u2019t want to discourage them from taking it into context when they\\u2019re passing legislation.\", \"Bret: In the meantime, Gail, have I ever mentioned how relieved I am never to have used Facebook?\", \"Gail: This doesn\\u2019t count the fact that your column goes up there, right? I\\u2019m all for using Facebook to pass along written pieces you like. But I haven\\u2019t had time to engage in any conversations there for years.\", \"Bret: Does my column really post on Facebook? Didn\\u2019t know that.\", \"This probably sounds horribly misanthropic, but when Facebook came around I feared it would be a handy way of connecting with people \\u2026 to whom I didn\\u2019t particularly want to be connected. So-and-so from graduate school? Maybe we fell out of touch for a reason. Second cousin, twice removed in Melbourne? Hope they\\u2019re having a nice life. It\\u2019s hard enough to be a good friend to people in our real lives to waste time on virtual friendships in digital spaces.\", \"Now I\\u2019ve been reading a multipart investigation in The Wall Street Journal on the perils of the platform, which include less sleep, worse parenting, the abandonment of creative hobbies and so on. Facebook\\u2019s own researchers estimate that 1 in 8 people on the platform suffer from some of these symptoms, which amounts to 360 million people worldwide. As someone pointed out, the word \\u201cuser\\u201d applies to people on social media just as much as it does to people on meth.\", \"I guess the question is whether the government should regulate it, and, if so, how?\", \"Gail: This takes me back to early America, when most people lived in small towns or on farms and had very little input from the outside world.\", \"They were very tight-knit, protective, familial \\u2014 and very inclined to stick to their clan and isolate, discriminate, persecute and yes, enslave, the folks who weren\\u2019t part of the group. You had a lot of good qualities of togetherness and helping the team, but a lot of clannishness and injustice to nonmembers.\", \"Bret: Almost sounds like an academic department at a placid New England college. Sorry, go on \\u2026\", \"Gail: The Postal Service brought newspapers and letters and changed all that. And of course there were also unfortunate effects \\u2014 a lot of mobilizing to fight against the newly discovered outside world.\", \"I think the digital revolution is maybe as important \\u2014 people are making new friends around the globe, discovering tons and tons of new information, but also ganging up on folks they don\\u2019t like. Discriminating not only against minority groups but also the less popular members of their own.\", \"Bret: The moral of the story is that there\\u2019s no substitute for in-person relationships, whether it\\u2019s between colleagues, acquaintances, friends, family members or even two columnists who agree about 40 percent of the time. Which reminds me that there\\u2019s this Cabernet that we still need to share, so that we can mourn \\u2014 or celebrate \\u2014 last week\\u2019s news.\"]","href_hash":"a1571be0407d11eca1cfd1f07a37391c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a1571be0407d11eca1cfd1f07a37391c"}},
