In June, Williamson again was sidelined by the issue in Birmingham for New Zealand's second test against England.\", \"And while the Kiwi skipper played on through pain for the World Test Championship win, and Twenty20 World Cup campaign, the injury's recurrence before the second test against India in Mumbai earlier this month will see Williamson sit out of the upcoming test series against Bangladesh.\", \"Tom Latham will lead the Blackcaps in Williamson's place, with hopes resting on him recovering in time to face South Africa in two tests later this summer, beginning in Christchurch on February 17.\", \"But as coach Stead says, while Williamson taking the field against the Proteas would be his preference, he won't take chances with his skipper's fitness.\", \"\\\"We are hoping that, but again we're not putting timeframes on that,\\\" Stead says.\", \"\\\"The thing to remember with Kane, is that he played in the T20 World Cup and he played the World Test Championship final, both at times when perhaps rest may have been the best thing for him.\", \"\\\"It's not like he's picking and choosing when he wants this to flare up.
