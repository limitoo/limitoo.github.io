Melissa Clark is in the newspaper we delivered to the vicinity of our subscribers\\u2019 front doors this morning, with a new recipe for what she\\u2019s calling brown-butter orzo with butternut squash (above). It\\u2019s a lovely, one-pot affair, rich and creamy and almost risottolike in consistency: Sweet and velvety squash takes well to a dollop of cooling ricotta against the heat of red-pepper flakes and a zip of lemon, a near-perfect rejoinder to the chill and damp of a December evening. Maybe you could give it a try tonight? Fortifying!\", \"Some will be entertaining this week, drawing friends and family close in evenings of celebration in advance of the winter solstice, Christmas, the end of the year. David Tanis is ready for those with a lively menu of fennel and radicchio salad, followed by an ad-lib fish stew and a ruby grapefruit granita for dessert.\", \"For myself, I\\u2019m thinking a tourti\\u00e8re, or a brisket and Guinness pie, to serve alongside a simple salad of watercress dressed in olive oil and a lot of lemon juice, with flaky sea salt. (Both can be fortified with a healthy cup of this amazing concoction the chef Fergus Henderson calls trotter gear, a gelatinous cross between stock and magic that\\u2019s made from pig\\u2019s feet, vegetables and Madeira. I know. It\\u2019s a lot. But make some for your next pot of beans and you\\u2019ll be a convert.)\", \"Still, others will simply be trying to get a meal on the table against a backdrop of work and holiday drinks and children and the press of our current circumstances. For them, perhaps, this simple cold noodle salad with spicy peanut sauce, or maple-baked salmon, or a cheesy, spicy black bean bake. (Not your speed? Here are our most popular recipes of 2021.)\", \"There are thousands and thousands more recipes to appeal to your specific interests and needs waiting on New York Times Cooking. You need a subscription to access them, it\\u2019s true, same as you need one for Netflix to watch \\u201cUnorthodox.\\u201d\", \"But we think it\\u2019s worth the expense: all our recipes, along with the tools and features we\\u2019ve built to help you use them, and the helpful notes of fellow subscribers. Subscriptions support our work and allow it to continue. I hope you will subscribe today, if you haven\\u2019t already.

And she\\u2019s got a good crew lined up to do that: She\\u2019ll be joined by Laurie Anderson, Lynn Nottage and Sarah Schulman. RSVP here.\", \"Vulture ranked the 101 best New York City movies. There is plenty to debate in that.\", \"Finally, in case you missed it, here\\u2019s Bill Friskics-Warren\\u2019s obituary for Stonewall Jackson, the country-music star who spent six decades as a cast member of the Grand Ole Opry in Nashville. He died last week at 89. His biggest hit: \\u201cWaterloo.\\u201d Listen to that, and I\\u2019ll be back on Friday.\"]","href_hash":"2f0c3974584411ecbfd25de2a05e4bc5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2f0c3974584411ecbfd25de2a05e4bc5"}},
