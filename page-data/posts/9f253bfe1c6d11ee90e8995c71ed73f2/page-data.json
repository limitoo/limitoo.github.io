While some native species' populations are improving, many are in decline. Reversing this decline and making sure our native plants and animals are healthy and resilient is a priority for our government,\\\" he said.\", \"A biodiversity credits system would allow people and philanthropic organisations to finance \\\"native-positive\\\" actions, including on whenua M\\u0101ori, Shaw said.\", \"\\\"Landowners, land managers, farmers, and Ma\\u014dri should be looking at their wild spaces as a taonga, but also as a valuable source of supplementary income. This can then be used to support on-the-ground conservation, like reforestation, wetland restoration, or planting native vegetation,\\\" he said.\", \"It could also help close the economic gap between exotic and native forestry - promoting more effective emissions reduction and improving stormwater absorption.\", \"The government's discussion document seeks feedback on how such a system should be set up, and what role the government should have in it.\", \"After consultation closes on 3 November, the Department of Conservation and Ministry for the Environment will make recommendations to the government.\", \"The National Policy Statement for Indigenous Biodiversity would also for the first time require all regional councils to prepare a strategy for biodiversity.\", \"Shaw said councils had been required for the past 30 years to \\\"take care of important wildlife habitats\\\" but that had not been clearly defined or supported.\", \"The specific changes for land use would depend on how each council identified and managed its \\\"Significant Natural Areas\\\" which until recently had no clear definition.\", \"The move to impose a single method for identifying SNAs came under fire from protesters and landowners who feared it would mean losing control of private land, or facing restrictions on what they could do with it.\", \"The policy statement however applies to councils rather than landowners, giving the local authorities flexibility on how they manage adverse effects in SNAs.\", \"Shaw on Friday said activities including grazing could continue, provided their effects remained at the same level and did not increase the loss of native plants.\", \"He also said a tailored approach had been created for M\\u0101ori land, which was often a home to a significant amount of indigenous vegetation.\", \"\\\"This will prevent M\\u0101ori land from being excessively affected by the NPSIB and will allow M\\u0101ori to meet their aspirations for the use of their land and care for the environment,\\\" he said.\", \"Councils would also need to restore important areas that had degraded over time, and monitor biodiversity. Their policy statements and plans will need to be in place within five years from when the NPS takes effect, with changes publicly notified within eight years of implementation.\", \"The government also announced a series of new tools being funded and worked on for protecting biodiversity.\", \"These include:\"]","href_hash":"9f253bfe1c6d11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9f253bfe1c6d11ee90e8995c71ed73f2"}},
