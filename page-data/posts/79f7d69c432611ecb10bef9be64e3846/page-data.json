For most Americans, it's the latter.\\u00a0\", \"Seventy-one percent say they hold onto their electronic devices for as long as they can, while just 15% say they buy new ones as soon as they come out. For another 13%, it depends.\", \"This is true of Americans of all ages, though there are differences: younger adults are more likely than older Americans to buy new electronic devices as soon as they come out. Twenty-four percent of adults under 45 do, too, compared to just 5% of adults 55 and older.\", \"Income also plays a factor, indicating perhaps that more Americans might buy new electronic devices as soon as they come out if they have the means to do so.
