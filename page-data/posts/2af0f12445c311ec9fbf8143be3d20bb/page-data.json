Kendall had come to the meeting to show he could be the commanding, charismatic figure to lead Waystar into the future. And for a few seconds at least, he had his host\\u2019s undivided attention.\", \"Then Logan walked through the door, and Josh literally pushed Kendall aside to greet the old man. Point made: Logan is still Waystar\\u2019s star.\", \"This week\\u2019s episode is titled \\u201cRetired Janitors of Idaho.\\u201d It refers to the faction Roman fears will determine the fate of the Roy family if the Waystar shareholders get the chance to vote on the company\\u2019s leadership. Nearly all the action takes place in a luxury hotel and conference center, where the powerful people are sequestered in stew-rooms, scarfing down snacks and strategizing. The general feeling among the Roy loyalists is that Logan needs to address the assembly, calming their nerves with his star power.\", \"\\u201cJust get the body up there,\\u201d Karl says.\", \"But just as Logan broke down physically in front of Josh last week, this week his body failed him again. He has a urinary track infection; and when his assistant isn\\u2019t around to remind him to take his pills, Logan becomes disoriented. He calls Shiv \\u201cMarcia.\\u201d He asks to go the bathroom seemingly every few minutes. He does not appear to know where he is or why he is there. And he is convinced there is a dead cat under his chair.\", \"So no, there will be no Logan Roy wow factor at this shareholders\\u2019 meeting. But the Roys have an even bigger problem. Before Logan loses his wits, he gives the order that they should reject the big peacemaking deal their opponents have offered them. But did he really know what he was saying at the time, or was he already slipping? (Roman: \\u201cCan we just give him some cranberry juice and then ask him about the deal again?\\u201d)\", \"This of course is the problem with staking everything on one imposing figurehead. Leaders can flag. They age, they weaken. While the Roys are making multibillion-dollar decisions based on their patriarch\\u2019s mumbling about imaginary cats, Sandi Furness (Hope Davis) is in a suite nearby, consulting with her own father, Sandy (Larry Pine). He has chronic medical problems, too, leaving him mostly immobile and inaudible. When Sandi meets with Shiv to try to find what Gerri likes to call \\u201ca deal-space,\\u201d each of these two highly intelligent, highly capable women claim, \\u201cI just do what my dad tells me.\\u201d\", \"Instead of bringing their own fresh ideas to the family business, Sandi and Shiv are left defending the decisions their clearly diminished dads are making, even when those choices seem driven more by spite and paranoia than by sound business sense. Sandy, for one, seems motivated primarily by a desire to make a deal that robs the Roys of any of the trappings of power. First, he asks to be granted the right to veto any decision to make a Roy family member a future chief executive. Then, when he gets a begrudging \\u201cyes\\u201d to that, he comes back with a demand that the Roys give up their private jets. (Roman: \\u201cFirst they came for the P.J.s, and I said nothing. \\u2026\\u201d)\", \"As for Logan, even though he is under criminal investigation and in danger of losing control of everything he has built, he still refuses to believe that he is not holding all the trump cards. Any time the Sandy and Stewy side offers a concession \\u2014 just to avoid the uncertainty of a vote \\u2014 Logan sees it as a sign they are scared. Before he lapses into incoherence, he suggests either calling their bluff or leaking to the press that they\\u2019re wavering, to show the shareholders who is really the boss.\", \"One of those shareholders is Logan\\u2019s own brother Ewan: another old man stifling a youngster. In Ewan\\u2019s case, he is making life difficult for Greg, who has disappointed his grandfather by signing onto the Waystar joint defense agreement, throwing his lot in with the people Ewan calls, \\u201cMy brother and his gang of crapulous shills.\\u201d He informs Greg that he has changed his will, giving all of his money to Greenpeace. (\\u201cEven my part?\\u201d Greg asks. \\u201cThat was the first part,\\u201d Ewan replies.) Trying to shake his grandson up, he says, earnestly, \\u201cYour life is not a bagatelle,\\u201d adding: \\u201cYou need to take yourself seriously, kid.\\u201d Greg nods, then later asks someone else, \\u201cDo you think it\\u2019s possible to sue a person \\u2026 a grandparent, for example \\u2026 in a way which is, like \\u2026 in an affectionate way?\\u201d\", \"The last old man playing a major role in this story is the president of the United States \\u2014 \\u201cthe Raisin\\u201d \\u2014 who has been feeling real pressure ever since ATN pivoted from backing him unconditionally to questioning his mental fitness. The Raisin calls the Roys, asking to speak directly to Logan, who is still indisposed. So they pass him off to Roman, who is the closest thing to \\u201cbootleg Logan.\\u201d After Roman bumbles through the small talk and is sworn at by the commander in chief, he gets the news that the president is withdrawing his re-election bid.\", \"This is not really how the Roys wanted their whole \\u201cIs the President secretly senile?\\u201d maneuver to work out. Their access to the Oval Office gives them crucial leverage in their business deals \\u2014 and, they had hoped, in the Justice Department\\u2019s Brightstar investigation. They have outsmarted themselves and are losing a major asset. (Roman, with maximum irony, looks on the bright side: \\u201cIt\\u2019s kind of nice to know we can puppet-master the whole American republic project.\\u201d)\", \"The outcome isn\\u2019t much better with the agreement Sandi and Shiv hurriedly hammer out: The Roys will eat the P.J.s, the Sandy and Stewy side will get four seats on the board (including one for Sandi), and Waystar will grab another seat as well (possibly for Shiv). When Logan regains his faculties, he is peeved, certain that any agreement that satisfies Sandy must be a dud. He can\\u2019t say what he would have done differently. He just knows it would have been better.\", \"But the real loser from all the frantic deal making is \\u2014 as it so often seems to be \\u2014 Kendall, who never gets to be in any room where a final decision is made. Early on, he boasts to Stewy that his suite is \\u201cthe real annual meeting,\\u201d insisting he has back channels to everyone who matters. But Shiv ignores him when calls to offer insights and gossip, Roman screams at him when he pops by the main Roy room, and even Stewy busts his chops a little, saying, \\u201cShouldn\\u2019t you be standing on a rainbow soapbox somewhere screaming, \\u2018Time\\u2019s up!\\u2019?\\u201d In danger of being left out of the day\\u2019s narrative altogether, Kendall makes a sad, desperate final showboating move, storming the stage in front of the shareholders to speak up for the Brightstar victims.\", \"In one last twist of the knife, Logan asks for a quick end-of-the-day meeting with Kendall but then ghosts him, leaving his son sitting completely alone in a tiny room. Kendall tries to call his dad, but Logan blocks his number \\u2014 permanently.\", \"So just as Logan has no access to the Raisin, Kendall now has no access to Logan. And both men are about to find out whether their power has more to do with who they are or who they know.\"]","href_hash":"2af0f12445c311ec9fbf8143be3d20bb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2af0f12445c311ec9fbf8143be3d20bb"}},
