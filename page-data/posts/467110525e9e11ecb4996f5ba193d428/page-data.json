Cashe, in his fuel-soaked uniform, went back into the burning vehicle to rescue those who were left and lead them to medical treatment. Cashe made it to the U.S. for medical care but died three weeks after the rescue.\\u00a0\", \"Cashe is the first Black service member who served in Iraq or Afghanistan to receive this award.\\u00a0\", \"In Afghanistan in 2018, Celiz used his body as a shield when his unit was attacked. He braved machine gun and small arms fire to allow others to maneuver to safety and begin treatment of the critically wounded. When a medevac helicopter arrived, it was immediately targeted by the enemy forces. Although injured, Celiz motioned to the aircraft to depart rather than remain to load him. He remained engaged with the enemy so the aircraft could take off with the casualty.\\u00a0\", \"Celiz died as a result of his wounds on July 12, 2018.\\u00a0\", \"Plumlee was serving in Afghanistan in 2013 when his base was breached by enemy fighters. He and a group of soldiers fought off the attackers, some of whom detonated suicide vests.
