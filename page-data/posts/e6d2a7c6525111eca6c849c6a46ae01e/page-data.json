You are all about taking over our country. Don't worry. There are plenty who would love the opportunity to take you off the face of this f**king earth. Come get it.

Tlaib said she wanted to send a message to Muslims that Americans speak out against violent rhetoric like Boebert's. Carson pointed out that Muslim-Americans work in the U.S. judicial system, including numerous police officers who assisted following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\", \"The conference occurred in response to Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's tepid statement about Boebert's remarks. McCarthy's statement didn't condemn the remarks. Republican Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson criticized McCarthy for not \\\"publicly condemning\\\" Boebert's comments.\", \"In a video that surfaced last week, Boebert referred to Omar as a member of the \\\"Jihad Squad\\\" while telling a story in which she implied that a Capitol police officer mistook Omar as a potential suicide bomber.\", \"In the second video containing similar remarks, Boebert tells a modified version of the story: \\\"One of my staffers, on his first day with me got into an elevator in the Capitol,\\\" Boebert tells the crowd. \\\"And in that elevator, we were joined by Ilhan Omar.\\\"\", \"Someone in the audience moans, \\\"Oh God.\\\" Another person remarks, \\\"Press the emergency button.\\\" The audience then laughs.\", \"Boebert continues, \\\"Well, it was just us three in there and I looked over and I said, 'Well, lookie there. It's the Jihad Squad.'\\\" The crowd laughs and applauds at her comment as Boebert smiles and looks around the room.\", \"\\\"I do have to say,\\\" Boebert adds, \\\"She doesn't have a backpack, she wasn't dropping it and running, so we're good.\\\"\", \"In a Tuesday morning broadcast, CNN political reporter Andrew Kaczynski said that the lack of a Capitol police officer in this retelling of Boebert's story lends \\\"a little bit of credence to the fact that this is a made-up story that she's telling a crowd for laughs, maybe. I guess the joke is that Muslims are terrorists.\\\"\", \"In her response to Boebert's Islamophobic remarks from the first video, Omar replied, \\\"Fact, this buffoon looks down when she sees me at the Capitol, this whole story is made up. Sad she thinks bigotry gets her clout.\\\"\", \"Omar added, \\\"Saying I am a suicide bomber is no laughing matter. ... Normalizing this bigotry not only endangers my life but the lives of all Muslims. Anti-Muslim bigotry has no place in Congress.\\\"\", \"Last Friday, Boebert tweeted a 41-word apology to the Muslim community for her remarks, calling the incident an \\\"unnecessary distraction.\\\" Then, on Monday, Boebert called Omar to discuss the matter.\", \"According to Boebert, Omar demanded a public apology \\\"because what I had done wasn't good enough.\\\" Boebert told Omar that \\\"she should make a public apology to the American people for her anti-American, antisemitic, anti-police rhetoric.\\\"\", \"The rhetoric Boebert mentioned may refer to Omar's past controversial statements. She has said that Israel's allies in American politics were primarily motivated by money. She has also compared American war atrocities to those committed by terrorist groups.\", \"Omar hung up on Boebert after deciding the call was \\\"unproductive,\\\" Omar said on Monday.\", \"\\\"Instead of apologizing for her Islamophobic comments and fabricated lies ... she instead doubled down on her rhetoric,\\\" Omar said.\", \"In a Monday Instagram video recounting the call, Boebert accused Omar of \\\"sympathizing with terrorists.\\\" Boebert has previously, baselessly called Omar an advocate \\\"for state-sponsored terrorism\\\" and an \\\"honorary member of Hamas.\\\"\", \"Georgia Republican Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene has also inserted herself into the controversy, referring to Omar as a part of the \\\"Jihad Squad\\\" via Twitter on Tuesday morning.\", \"Greene and Boebert have also both baselessly claimed in the past that Omar is in an incestuous marriage with her brother.\"]","href_hash":"e6d2a7c6525111eca6c849c6a46ae01e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e6d2a7c6525111eca6c849c6a46ae01e"}},
