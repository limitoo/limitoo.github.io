In the hours since Mr. Abloh\\u2019s death at 41, of a rare cancer, was made public, people struggled to characterize a man whose contributions to the industry extended far beyond any individual design. He was variously termed kaleidoscopic, a Renaissance man, a protean force in the history of fashion, and yet, looking back on his brief tenure at the apex of the business, what seems clear is that the word that best describes Mr. Abloh was there all along. He had provided it himself.\", \"Mr. Abloh was prismatic, a designer capable of capturing the varied colors and lights of an evolving culture, refracting and then beaming them out to a waiting world. Justly heralded as one of the first Black designers to head a European luxury goods house (Olivier Rousteing began his successful run in the top job at Balmain back in 2011), Mr. Abloh treated that achievement, if not its accompanying stature, with a seriousness that was impressive in and of itself.\", \"\\u201cWhat is diversity?\\u201d Mr. Abloh once asked a visitor to Vuitton headquarters in Paris just hours before one of his men\\u2019s wear presentations.\", \"The answer was everywhere you looked. Since Mr. Abloh\\u2019s arrival at the label, Vuitton\\u2019s drab corporate offices on the Right Bank had been transformed into something more closely resembling a communal gathering space.\", \"\\u201cI want all this to mean something,\\u201d he said then, words that echoed something he had told this reporter just months before he was officially named to his post at Louis Vuitton.\", \"On that occasion, in June of 2017, Mr. Abloh was a guest designer at the summer edition of Pitti Uomo in Florence. Most designers in that position understandably exploit the unusual platform \\u2014 Pitti Uomo is the world\\u2019s largest men\\u2019s wear trade fair \\u2014 to hype their brands. Yet rather than promoting his own Off-White label, Mr. Abloh used his stipend to engage the artist Jenny Holzer in a collaboration that saw the two of them excerpting fragments of poems by exiles caught up in the global immigration crisis and projecting them onto the walls of the ancient Palazzo Pitti.\", \"Two years later, at the Vuitton studio on the afternoon of my visit, models of varied colors milled around trying on designs for seemingly every permutation of gender. Friends of Mr. Abloh\\u2019s like Kid Cudi and others from overlapping spheres of hip-hop, skating, art and design crowded around a table laden with the absurdly costly accessories that kept most everyone there employed.\", \"Mr. Abloh, whose fingernails were painted gray that day, had just returned to work from what he referred to as a period of rest and reflection \\u2014 a break from a punishing schedule that had once kept him on planes at least once a week for years \\u2014 and that may in fact have been for the cancer that eventually claimed his life. If anything, he seemed more committed than ever to an expansive view of what constitutes both fashion and its message.\", \"\\u201cMe being here, in this space is about so much more than just making stuff that\\u2019s cool because it\\u2019s luxury,\\u201d Mr. Abloh said.\", \"Yet right from the start he created cool \\u201cstuff,\\u201d in volume, through regularly timed drops and with a maximalist aesthetic that was often far from the sleek refinement of those designers that dominated the upper reaches of men\\u2019s wear when he was on his way up. Whereas seminal late 20th-century designers like Helmut Lang and Jil Sander worked from an aesthetic of crisp, if still sexy, subtraction, Mr. Abloh generally favored a pile-on, whether of garments themselves or of references. (At one of his last Vuitton shows, it was coats atop tunics over trousers with hats clamped on hoodies and bags slung around waistlines, across bodies and strapped to backs.)\", \"He was notably liberal in his samplings from other designers \\u2014 to wit: a cloud print collection Italo Zucchelli designed for Calvin Klein in 2014 (and that Drake would later wear on tour) turned up again on a Vuitton fall 2020 runway in pretty close replica \\u2014 or uninflected by invisible quotation marks. He mixed with abandon, snagging exoskeleton shapes from Rick Owens\\u2019s tool chest, creating $550 flannel shirts for his cult label Pyrex Vision from logoed Ralph Lauren deadstock.\", \"As a designer, he was a stealth sentimentalist, someone whose late \\u201980s and early \\u201990s influences \\u2014 whether they were Saturday morning cartoons; or \\u201cThriller\\u201d-era Michael Jackson (in a collection that was pulled by LVMH in response to the \\u201cLeaving Neverland\\u201d documentary that detailed allegations against the singer of sexual abuse); or the dewy young Princess Diana, circa her chiffon and pussy-bow period; or the Statue of Liberty as reimagined as a Sudanese infant; or else the flags of the African continent \\u2014 he wore on his sleeve.\", \"At times his shows could be as campy as a revival house matinee of a Warner Bros. musical. For his Louis Vuitton men\\u2019s show debut in 2018, Mr. Abloh covered the gravel paving at the Palais Royal gardens in Paris with an ombr\\u00e9 rainbow carpet and then opened the gates to a guest list including 600 students from local architecture, art and fashion schools. For his Michael Jackson-inspired show, he reconstructed a grubby Lower East Side street in a tent erected in the Tuileries Gardens. (Guests smoking weed added a touch of Alphabet City verisimilitude.)\", \"For his spring 2020 show, which closely followed a devastating fire that toppled the spire on Notre Dame and came close to destroying the beloved cathedral, he took over the nearby Place Dauphine, where he installed a Louis Vuitton bouncy castle, had aproned waiters serve Champagne to invitees seated at cafe tables set on the ancient cobblestones and gave away Vuitton-branded trinkets like ashtrays and miniatures Eiffel Towers to guests who wholeheartedly shoveled these souvenirs into their bags.\", \"\\u201cI was stuck with this idea of celebrating what\\u2019s here while we\\u2019re here,\\u201d said Mr. Abloh, the designer, who also remained throughout his life Virgil Abloh, the suburban kid who could hardly credit where his own good fortune and hard work had gotten him.\", \"The inner child Mr. Abloh often claimed as his creative North Star, the person he said he thought of when he sat down to design, had never been tutored in fashion, learning instead to sew from his mother Eunice. No matter how high-flying his life became, he returned with regularity to the Midwest, to his wife and two children and to the extended Ghanaian-American family from whom he learned \\u2014 in the words of his father, Nee \\u2014 the importance of having \\u201ca distinguishable career.\\u201d\", \"From this critic\\u2019s vantage, what will distinguish Mr. Abloh\\u2019s truncated career in fashion most durably may not be the goods he had a hand in creating \\u2014 his sneaker collaborations, his fashion collections or his highly coveted accessories. What people will remember Mr. Abloh for above all is the structural changes he was instrumental in bringing into effect.\", \"Once again, he foresaw that for himself.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s one level of the work that\\u2019s designing at Louis,\\u201d Mr. Abloh said in January 2021 in an interview Pharrell Williams conducted with him and the artist KAWS for his OTHERtone podcast. His real mission, as Mr. Abloh saw it, was \\u201cto make sure there\\u2019s, like, six young Black kids that take my job after me.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"86376ce0516511eca43e95ba21fc3283"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"86376ce0516511eca43e95ba21fc3283"}},
