He later specified in a tweet that a $6.6 billion donation would \\\"avert famine\\\" next year.\", \"After seeing the interview, Musk said on Twitter that he would immediately sell shares of the electric car company, which is worth more than $1 trillion, if the U.N. could explain how the money would \\\"solve\\\" hunger.\", \"\\\"If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6 billion will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it,\\\" tweeted Musk, who\\u00a0Bloomberg ranks as the richest person in the world.\", \"If WFP can describe on this Twitter thread exactly how $6B will solve world hunger, I will sell Tesla stock right now and do it.\", \"Beasley defended his comments in a reply to Musk on Twitter and told the entrepreneur that \\\"with your help, we can bring hope, build stability and change the future.\\\"\", \"\\\"Let's talk,\\\" Beasley tweeted to Musk, a South Africa native. \\\"It isn't as complicated as Falcon Heavy, but too much is at stake to not at least have a conversation.\\\"\", \"About $3.5 billion of a roughly $6 billion donation would go toward buying food for people mostly in Africa and the Middle East, including Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of the Congo,\\u00a0 Sudan, South Sudan and Yemen, according to the U.N. The money would also fund the distribution of food in those and other countries by air, river or truck.\\u00a0\", \"All told, the U.N. said its proposed plan would feed 42 million starving people. The WFP proposal also calls for:\\u00a0\", \"The proposal doesn't break down how much money, if any, would go toward combating hunger in the U.S.\", \"The U.N. emphasized that $6 billion would not eradicate world hunger.
