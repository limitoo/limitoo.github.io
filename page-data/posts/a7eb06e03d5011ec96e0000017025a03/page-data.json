The know-how, and wealth, of the Industrial Revolution led Victorians to embrace this innovation with gusto, resulting in more than 100 such resort towns dotting the coast by century\\u2019s end.\", \"\\u201cThey were incredible feats of architecture and engineering \\u2014 even to attempt one now would be an extraordinary thing,\\u201d said Alex Fisher, editor of Coast, a magazine that celebrates life around Britain\\u2019s seafronts.\", \"By the 20th century, they continued to thrive, and most had become synonymous with a brassy, carefree affect: saucy postcards, kiss-me-quick hats and an occasional sunny day on a spit of sand. The rise of cheap package holidays abroad starting in the 1970s slowly siphoned off their core market, though, leaving many foundering through the 1980s and 1990s.\", \"But thanks to the British government\\u2019s restrictive, pandemic-related travel policies, which all but forced Britons to embrace domestic vacations again, they\\u2019ve seen a revival this year, Ms. Fisher noted. And that might have a future: Flexible working, she said, will make it easier to attract residents, rather than visitors, to such locales in the long term.\", \"The best way to understand these changes, now and going forward, is to look at three very different seaside resorts around Britain. One has weathered the downturns almost frozen in amber; another is regenerating at warp speed thanks to a combination of convenience and cachet; and a third struggles, even as glimmers of hope appear.\", \"It was a Victorian industrialist who, quite literally, put Frinton-on-Sea on the map: Sir Richard Powell Cooper created the town as it exists now in the 1890s, pumping his fortune into creating a tiny exclusive enclave controlled by strict bylaws. There would be no pier, no ice cream stands \\u2014 even the color of beach huts would be regulated. And there certainly would be no pubs (the first opened, amid predictable hullabaloo, more than a century later).\", \"Today, Frinton-on-Sea is home to 5,000 people. One of them is Clive Brill, a 61-year-old actor and producer who now runs its seven-week summer theater festival after first visiting as a performer. \\u201cFrinton adjoins one of the best beaches in the U.K., which spreads for six miles \\u2014 it\\u2019s golden sand and has the most fantastic tides,\\u201d he said.\", \"His adoptive hometown has bucked the downturn of most of its peers in part thanks to a focus on upscale tourism from the outset. It resisted any effort to expand, or attract a broader audience despite the economic potential \\u2014 compare it to nearby Clacton-on-Sea, a typically exuberant, mass-market seaside resort just 20 minutes\\u2019 drive away, which has struggled in recent decades.\", \"Frinton-on-Sea also features impressive housing stock, including several houses designed by C.F.A. Voysey, the Arts and Crafts designer and architect. \\u201cI\\u2019ve had many a tour around it,\\u201d Mr. Brill said of one such home, \\u201cand it\\u2019s absolutely fantastic. It was designed with a view that people who had some money were moving in.\\u201d Prices can be surprisingly reasonable for waterfront property: An eight-bedroom detached house close to the seafront, for instance, is for sale at about $1.4 million.\", \"Mr. Brill said that the town relished its almost Big Brother-like approach, as well as its prim gentility, with a knowing wink, citing the local maxim that compared it with a huge, nearby port: Harwich is for the continent, while Frinton is for the incontinent.\", \"Indeed, more than one-third of locals are of pensionable age, but recent additions to town nod to the influx of younger people, Mr. Brill suggested \\u2014 take the local tapas and wine bar, Different, whose name seems equal parts challenge and explanation.\", \"Gizzi Erskine was amazed during her first visit to Margate eight years ago. The cookery writer and TV presenter who grew up in London came down to visit after friends from the capital\\u2019s artsy East began flocking there.\", \"\\u201cMargate had a gritty glamour, and the sunsets are unbelievable \\u2014 I\\u2019ve seen colors in that sky that I\\u2019ve never seen anywhere else in the world. The light is something to behold,\\u201d Ms. Erskine, 42, said.\", \"Last month, she became the latest D.F.L. \\u2014 that\\u2019s \\u201cDown from London,\\u201d in Margate-speak \\u2014 after opening a new restaurant, the Love Cafe, in an old diner. Her business partners include Carl Bar\\u00e2t, a member of the louche rock band the Libertines; he already co-owns a hotel, the Albion, in the town \\u2014 where visiting musicians can stay while they record in some of the new studios that have also opened here.\", \"It was hard to predict such a drastic upturn when Margate\\u2019s Turner Contemporary gallery opened in April 2011 (J.M.W. Turner had lived here as a child and painted the community regularly). That same year, one in four shops in Margate closed, the worst rate of anywhere in Britain, according to the Local Data Company, a British retail location data company; it was a stronghold for the United Kingdom Independence Party, the right-wing, anti-European Union party.\", \"Yet the gallery served as a beacon to lure creative types to the town, expanding the population and perspective here in equal measure. The return of the acclaimed contemporary artist Tracey Emin, who grew up in Margate, was a boost, too; another D.F.L., she left her longtime base in Spitalfields, East London, and plans to turn her Margate home into a museum after her death.\", \"The renaissance of this seaside resort is undoubtedly buttressed by its location \\u2014 an hour and a half from London by high-speed train. That Margate was one of the first seaside wellness resorts also played a role in the recent rebound. The Royal Sea Bathing Hospital, the first of its kind in Britain, opened in 1791, and many of the adjoining homes date from the immediate decades that followed \\u2014 large Georgian townhouses that remain well-priced and well-built, but primed for renovation.\", \"\\u201cPeople who couldn\\u2019t afford to buy in London could buy here,\\u201d Ms. Erskine said, sounding a note of discomfort that\\u2019s familiar in any gentrified locale. One recent report from the Property Market Index noted a surging premium for seafront homes, which could fetch around $943,000, almost triple that of the typical price there, and likely a direct result of their desirability among the D.F.L.s. \\u201cI do feel slightly concerned about the socio-economics of it, all the rich white people taking over.\\u201d\", \"Two years ago, when the British government examined England\\u2019s poorest neighborhoods, eight of the top 10 most deprived areas in the country were part of Blackpool. The resort city in Lancashire doesn\\u2019t lack for visitors \\u2014 18 million people visited in 2019, according to the local council; residents numbered just under 140,000 in 2021 \\u2014 but that influx of visitors hasn\\u2019t translated into much regeneration.\", \"Michael Trainor, a once-local artist (he now lives in Scotland), explained that it\\u2019s mostly thanks to a combination of location and size. Sun can be elusive on the Irish Sea coast, even in summer, he noted.\", \"\\u201cIt was the original Victorian chutzpah to put it on a chilly bit of northwest coastline. Mad from start to finish.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, much of the housing here is nondescript and recently built, with little detailing to inspire (the Edwardian homes around Stanley Park are a noteworthy exception). The average house price in the United Kingdom to the year end in August was $387,000; Blackpool\\u2019s average selling price in July 2021 was about $170,000.\", \"Mr. Trainor, 54, said that Blackpool\\u2019s attractions, including its landmark Eiffel Tower-inspired tower, were built as mass-market crowd-pleasers, mostly for the working classes of Manchester\\u2019s factories. Luring new creative talent is much harder as a result; the costs, and risks, are much higher.\", \"Yet Mr. Trainor, who is the former head of LeftCoast, an arts organization in the city, doesn\\u2019t discount Blackpool\\u2019s chances. He first came to the city for a commission and helped champion its arts scene for several years. And it is getting some national attention: Britain\\u2019s Arts Council named it an area of priority in September.\", \"One of Mr. Trainor\\u2019s most exciting projects is the Art B&B, a 19-room reimagining of a typical bed-and-breakfast, with each room uniquely conceived by an artist. Christopher Samuel, for example, designed one intended to make ambulatory guests understand the inconvenience he encounters at most hotels as a wheelchair user.\", \"Art B&B\\u2019s profits are earmarked for reinvestment in the local creative scene, and Mr. Trainor proudly noted that income from the hotel this summer exceeded all expectations.\", \"\\u201cBlackpool has the same issues that all the U.K. seaside towns have got,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut it\\u2019s by far the most visited, so becomes a concentrated version of everything that happens in them, good and bad.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"a7eb06e03d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"a7eb06e03d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}},
