At least, for now.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-25T10:19:54.000Z","content":"[\"A funny thing happened on Nov. 8 on the set of \\u201cThe Voice\\u201d: Ariana Grande, the show\\u2019s newest coach, came to work in a Versace dress that had been widely worn as a Halloween costume just a week earlier.\", \"The colorful minidress \\u2014 with its crystallized straps, cutesy empire-waist cutouts and chunky stripes in shades of turquoise, lime green and scarlet \\u2014 appeared on the Italian luxury brand\\u2019s spring 2003 runway. But the style is best known for its brief turn in the 2004 romantic comedy \\u201c13 Going on 30,\\u201d worn by Jennifer Garner as her character, Jenna Rink, performs the \\u201cThriller\\u201d dance at a work party.\", \"Nearly two decades after its introduction, that dress has found a new life, thanks in part to online retailers selling uncannily similar styles for less than $20. Vogue predicted in mid-October that the vibrant look would be \\u201ceverywhere on Halloween.\\u201d If TikTok is any indication, it was.\", \"The re-emergence of the dress coincides with a burning nostalgia for Y2K-era dressing, from head (hair clips and bucket hats) to toe (flared jeans and platform sandals).\", \"But its popularity goes beyond capturing the turn-of-the-millennium aesthetic: Celebrities and influencers have been seeking out specific archival pieces associated with pop culture moments of the aughts, said Marian Park, a youth strategist at the trend forecasting agency WGSN.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s less about costume and more about opulence or decadence,\\u201d she said, pointing to a tiger-striped, high-slit Roberto Cavalli dress from 2000, worn by Aaliyah to that year\\u2019s MTV Video Music Awards. More recently it\\u2019s been worn by Paloma Elsesser, a model; Bretman Rock, an influencer; and Kim Kardashian.\", \"Consider TikTok\\u2019s queen bee Addison Rae wearing Gucci by Tom Ford (circa 2003) to the Met Gala. Or Olivia Rodrigo wearing a plaid skirt-suit to the White House, a reference to the plaid skirt-suit worn by Alicia Silverstone in \\u201cClueless.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI think we can only expect playfulness in dressing up more and more \\u2014 and the affiliation with it being a costume, or something specific to a movie or a pop cultural moment, gets more diminished,\\u201d Ms. Park said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s more about the look.\\u201d\", \"Susie DeSanto, the costume designer for \\u201c13 Going on 30,\\u201d said the renewed interest in the film\\u2019s fashion has been \\u201ccrazy.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cAround Halloween, I cannot tell you how many people sent me pictures of all kinds of people \\u2014 little girls, teenagers, drag queens \\u2014 doing that dress,\\u201d Ms. DeSanto said. \\u201cI\\u2019ve had teenagers with fashion podcasts in Spain and Brazil contacting me and doing interviews about the clothes, sending me pictures, like: \\u2018Where did you get this? Where can I find this?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"The movie\\u2019s script called for designs that would plausibly appeal to both a 13-year-old girl and 30-year-old woman \\u2014 fun and sweet and na\\u00efve, bordering on sexy-baby \\u2014 and \\u201cthe designers and the trends of the early 2000s could not have been more on point for telling this story,\\u201d Ms. DeSanto said. Ms. Garner\\u2019s character wore a rotation of Miu Miu, Moschino and Marc Jacobs. (It helped that the director, Gary Winick, was a fashion enthusiast, Ms. DeSanto said.)\", \"The Versace dress had been introduced the previous fall at a runway show in Milan, where Britney Spears sat in the front row and which Cathy Horyn, then the New York Times\\u2019s fashion critic, compared to \\u201cbeing mugged by a gang of angry Barbies.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt was a dress that worked for the scene, for the character, and that\\u2019s why we picked it and that\\u2019s why she wore it,\\u201d Ms. DeSanto said.\", \"While the costume may be losing some of its affiliation with the film, the dress owes its resurgence largely to one of the movie\\u2019s stars. Last Halloween, Christa B. Allen, who played the younger version of Ms. Garner\\u2019s character, bought a re-creation of the dress on Etsy, then recreated a scene from the movie while wearing it on her TikTok account. The video has more than four million likes.\", \"\\u201cCosplay is huge on TikTok,\\u201d Ms. Allen said. \\u201cI realized: People love Jenna Rink, and I feel like I can give them a way to revisit that character and spend more time with her.\\u201d\", \"Around the same time, the model Elisha Herbert shared photos of herself on Instagram wearing a re-creation of the dress she had commissioned from Nasteski, a small Australian festival and swimwear label whose customers idolize the style of 2000s celebrities like Paris Hilton.\", \"When Anthea Nasteski, the designer, reposted those photos, she received dozens of comments and a handful of commissions \\u2014\\u00a0like the Etsy seller, she was charging more than $400 \\u2014 but didn\\u2019t really advertise the dress, she said. She felt at the time \\u201cit was in bad taste that I would resell someone else\\u2019s design,\\u201d even if that someone was Donatella Versace.\", \"Ms. Nasteski had also made the dress fairly quickly; with only had a few days between Ms. Herbert\\u2019s commission and Halloween, she used Lycra and tie-dyed fabric scraps she already had in her studio.\", \"Yet months later, in the summer of 2021, when the dress was suddenly being sold by sites including Cider and Amazon for less than $20 \\u2014 and going viral because of it \\u2014 these new replicas used the same tie-dye effect as Ms. Nasteski did. The photos on the Amazon listing are the same as those on Ms. Herbert\\u2019s Instagram.\", \"To Ms. Nasteski, this was another example of small designers seeing their work, without credit, on the platforms of large e-commerce companies. But it was also more complicated. It was her altered design, but it was also not her original design.\", \"When the cheaper versions of the dress were introduced, \\u201call of a sudden it was everywhere,\\u201d Ms. Allen, the actress, said. \\u201cI think if you wear it out, and people around you know the movie and know the character, then you get to share this special fun moment. But if they don\\u2019t know the dress and the character, then it\\u2019s still a great dress.\\u201d\", \"Ahead of her 30th birthday on Nov. 11, Ms. Allen reached out to Versace to see if she could borrow the original. But, she said, was kindly informed that the dress had already been committed to someone else. (She later discovered it was Ms. Grande.)\", \"Today, the dress no longer seems dependent on nostalgia for or even familiarity with the film, said Mandy Lee, a trend analyst with a large following on TikTok. She recently reported seeing one in the wild, worn by a shopper at the vintage store Beacon\\u2019s Closet, who had styled it with fishnet tights.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think it\\u2019s really a costume anymore,\\u201d Ms. Lee said. \\u201cSome Gen Z don\\u2019t know the reference, so when they\\u2019re looking at it for the first time, they might not have that memory sparked from the movie. It\\u2019s no longer the \\u201813 Going on 30\\u2019 dress. It\\u2019s just another cute dress.\\u201d\", \"Still, she is not convinced that the dress has longevity after this most recent bout of exposure. At under $20, it was \\u201cthere for the taking,\\u201d she said, which helped the dress go viral. But that may also have killed it, turning it into a micro-trend that people come to hate because they see it so much, fated for the garbage can or a thrift store.\", \"\\u201cThe hyper-exposure you have online now can sometimes ruin things,\\u201d Ms. Lee said.\"]","href_hash":"179cd9324dd911eca04fcf809600a91b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"179cd9324dd911eca04fcf809600a91b"}},
