The murder weapon is the subtitle.\", \"Oh, there\\u2019s blood, all right. That\\u2019s what Showtime\\u2019s righteous-serial-killer franchise promised from 2006 to 2013, and we get it in the very first episode of this revival, in snow-staining buckets. What we don\\u2019t get, in the four competent but redundant episodes screened for critics, is the \\u201cnew\\u201d: any hint of a fresh creative impulse in a series that had worn itself out years before it left the air.\", \"Then again, in \\u201cNew Blood,\\u201d as in so many of TV\\u2019s ubiquitous revivals, novelty is not really the point. The point is to give people more of what they already expect, by pulling out the electroshock paddles and reanimating any property with a following.\", \"You might have thought that interest in a \\u201cDexter\\u201d comeback would have been squelched by the (supposed) series finale, a contender for the TV disappointment hall of fame. Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), whose foster father taught him to channel his bloodlust into killing only the deserving, seemed to end his story by piloting a boat into a hurricane off the coast of Miami, to join his murdered sister, Debra (Jennifer Carpenter), in death. That is, until the final scene upended the closure and consequence, revealing our slayer alive and working in a lumber yard.\", \"\\u201cNew Blood,\\u201d which begins Sunday on Showtime, finds Dexter living a new life \\u2014 but not that one. He\\u2019s living in upstate New York (played by picturesque Shelburne Falls, Mass.) as \\u201cJim Lindsay\\u201d (a seeming nod to the novelist Jeff Lindsay, whose \\u201cDarkly Dreaming Dexter\\u201d the series was based on). Hall\\u2019s distinctively icy delivery now has a climate to match.\", \"Jim\\u2019s a solid citizen, dating the local police chief (Julia Jones), chopping firewood, going out line dancing and working at a sporting goods store selling knives and guns. (In the original series, he worked as a forensic blood-spatter expert; \\u201cDexter\\u201d loves its wry vocational choices.)\", \"Do we need to call it a spoiler that Jim/Dexter finds it not so easy to control the \\u201cdark passenger\\u201d that drives him to kill? That his romance with a law officer becomes uncomfortably complicated, as his relationship with the police officer Debra once was? That he still retains the knowledge of how to set up a home slaughter shack? Then consider all eight seasons of \\u201cDexter\\u201d a spoiler, because \\u201cNew Blood\\u201d gives you little that you aren\\u2019t used to, beyond the temperature.\", \"It even brings back Debra, now a taunting imaginary presence in Dexter\\u2019s mind. It\\u2019s a fun, flashy role for Carpenter, but it does little dramatically except to rehash Dexter\\u2019s past torments and manically externalize his inner state, which is already amply told-not-shown through the series\\u2019s voice-over.\", \"The newish wrinkle is the sudden appearance of his son, Harrison (Jack Alcott), last seen as a tot heading off into exile in Argentina. He is now a teenager with Dexter\\u2019s thousand-mile stare and a lot of questions.\", \"His inopportune visit, and Dexter\\u2019s worry that Harrison has inherited the dark passenger, has the potential to emotionally complicate the story. But it mostly serves as one more source of pressure in the season\\u2019s busy cat-and-mouse game. There\\u2019s also a string of missing young women in the area; a potential school shooting; and the appearance of that staple of brooding cable dramas, a Symbolic Mystical Deer.\", \"Sanguinary and superfluous, \\u201cNew Blood\\u201d ends up being an example of the worst traits of two different TV eras at once.\", \"The original \\u201cDexter\\u201d began well into cable\\u2019s antihero period, a flourishing of difficult protagonists that, at best, gave us \\u201cThe Sopranos\\u201d and \\u201cBreaking Bad,\\u201d series that forced their audiences to confront the moral implications of being invested in the villain. At worst, it simply offered audiences excuses to revel in the vicarious thrill of bad behavior.\", \"For its first couple seasons, \\u201cDexter\\u201d was a mischievously provocative narrative. It offered a funhouse-mirror reflection of gory police shows like \\u201cCSI\\u201d \\u2014 Dexter was both spatter-analyzer and spatter-maker. And it invited us to wonder about the nature of morality: Was Dexter actually a moral person, or just a monster who\\u2019d learned a neat trick?\", \"But as it went on, the show gave its protagonist and its audience more and more loopholes. Interrogating the show\\u2019s premise \\u2014 basically, a permission structure for the audience to have fun with a vigilante murderer \\u2014 would ruin the fun. Instead, the show let you enjoy Dexter\\u2019s macabre handiwork and even cheer him on to evade capture, because his victims were evil, because without him someone would commit even worse crimes, because he was in the end a kind of victim.\", \"The new series likewise seems to be mostly comfortable as a darkly comic romp, opening with a stalking sequence set to Iggy Pop\\u2019s \\u201cThe Passenger\\u201d \\u2014 get it? \\u2014 and quickly setting up new cartoon antagonists who are basically begging to get themselves serial-killed. The series\\u2019s promise of guilt-free bloodletting hasn\\u2019t aged well, even on ice.\", \"In the current era of TV, \\u201cNew Blood\\u201d is the latest revival indulging the idea that fans always deserve to get more of the things they liked, because they can \\u2014 creative dead-ends and supposedly final endings be damned. But this time at least, Dexter did not act alone.\", \"This fall brought us the \\u201cSopranos\\u201d prequel movie, \\u201cThe Many Saints of Newark,\\u201d a well-made and pointless exercise in remember-when (as Tony once put it, \\u201cthe lowest form of conversation\\u201d) that allowed stars like Vera Farmiga and Corey Stoll to trot out their impersonations of beloved characters while adding nothing to the original story beyond a hint of sadness.\", \"Because fan bases existed and the checks cleared, we got more \\u201cGilmore Girls,\\u201d \\u201cRoseanne,\\u201d \\u201cWill & Grace,\\u201d \\u201cArrested Development\\u201d and \\u201cVeronica Mars,\\u201d plus the \\u201cBreaking Bad\\u201d movie \\u201cEl Camino\\u201d \\u2014 efforts that played on the affection for TV classics without building on them. This December, a de-Samantha-fied \\u201cSex and the City\\u201d will return in the form of HBO Max\\u2019s \\u201cAnd Just Like That \\u2026\\u201d\", \"Not every revival or spinoff is a bad idea \\u2014 but it needs to have an idea beyond \\u201cI want more.\\u201d \\u201cBetter Call Saul\\u201d can stand with the original \\u201cBreaking Bad\\u201d because the prequel developed its own picaresque story and voice. \\u201cTwin Peaks: The Return\\u201d in many ways surpassed the original, by embracing artistic adventure rather than nostalgia.\", \"Good, bad or adequate, though, the collective effect of all these continuations and extensions is to rob finales of finality. It denies artists and audiences the power of believing that \\u201cThe End\\u201d is the end. Maybe the \\u201cNew Blood\\u201d season could serve as a do-over, a for-real-this-time finale for \\u201cDexter\\u201d after its unsatisfying first try. But would anyone bet on that?\", \"Of course, nobody wants critics saying that John Updike shouldn\\u2019t return to Rabbit or Margaret Atwood to Gilead; no one wants to squelch the next \\u201cGodfather, Part II\\u201d in the name of preventing the next \\u201cGodfather, Part III.\\u201d Sometimes franchises genuinely have more creative life in them.\", \"But often they just need to stay buried. As \\u201cJim Lindsay\\u201d says in \\u201cNew Blood,\\u201d explaining why he changed his name: \\u201cDexter had to die.\\u201d Amen, brother, and yet here we are. You had one job.\"]","href_hash":"58f322923d6f11ec9520000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"58f322923d6f11ec9520000017025a03"}},
