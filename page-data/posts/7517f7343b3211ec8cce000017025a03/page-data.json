His job approval rating now sits at 42 percent, lower than that for every one of his predecessors over the past 70 years, except for Trump, but his rating isn't far behind Biden's.\", \"A poll from NBC News, released Sunday, found that 40 percent of those surveyed had a positive view of Biden, down from the 43 percent he had in August.
