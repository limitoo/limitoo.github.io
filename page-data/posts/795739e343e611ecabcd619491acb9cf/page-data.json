Her recipes are superb, precisely choreographed dances of flavor and texture. The honey-glazed chicken below is a great example, a five-star recipe that people are loving.\", \"I\\u2019m thinking of Yewande right now not only because of that chicken, but for her buttery new cornbread dressing. This recipe has thoroughly complicated my Thanksgiving menu planning. Am I going to make two stuffing-like dishes now, since I already picked another one? If I do that, should I cancel the roasted squash and just do salad? And what about these stuffed onions? I was informed that I do need to roast a turkey, no matter what. (Apparently it\\u2019s my house but not my rules? So it goes on Thanksgiving.)\", \"Speaking of turkey: The amazing Tejal Rao is here to speak the truth, which is that the sides are in fact the best part of the meal. Be sure to check out Sidesgiving, a collection of 20 meatless recipes that will make you hungry, and pick up a copy of The New York Times on Sunday to see it in print. (And if you haven\\u2019t signed up for her vegetarian newsletter, The Veggie, you can do that right here!) I'm dearemily@nytimes.com for anyone who wants to talk weeknight or Thanksgiving recipes.\", \"Yewande has graced us with this one-pan recipe, in which chicken is glazed with a pan sauce of honey, chile, garlic and lime juice. Caramelized shallots, tossed with vinegar and parsley, complete the hot-sweet-tangy picture. Do not miss this one.\", \"View this recipe.\", \"This clever one-pot recipe from Ali Slagle is reminiscent of creamed spinach, but far more satisfying. (That\\u2019s partly because creamed spinach is often pretty bad. I said it!) There\\u2019s no cream here, only milk, but the end result is still rich. Lemon peel perks it up, and a pinch of red-pepper flakes would do the same.\", \"View this recipe.\", \"Like a lot of people, I\\u2019m trying to eat less meat. Also, like a lot of people, I really enjoy a bowl of chili. Last night, I tried J. Kenji L\\u00f3pez-Alt\\u2019s excellent chili with plant-based meat, which accompanied his article about how best to cook with Impossible and Beyond products. (Use them in recipes that start with breaking up the \\u201cmeat\\u201d in a pan, like rag\\u00f9 Bolognese.) I used chile powder here, rather than blending my own chile paste, which saves some time. Top abundantly with jalape\\u00f1o, cheese, sour cream, crushed tortilla chips, etc.!\", \"View this recipe.\", \"I have squash in my kitchen right now that\\u2019s earmarked for this recipe, one of my favorite fast dishes on New York Times Cooking. It\\u2019s adapted from the blogger and cookbook author Cynthia Chen McTernan, and it calls for stir-frying squash with scallions, then quickly braising the mixture in broth. My husband and I eat this for dinner over rice with a fried egg and chile sauce.\", \"View this recipe.\", \"Simple fish doesn\\u2019t need to be boring fish. Ali Slagle adds a mixture of herbs and panko breadcrumbs, inspired by the spice blend za\\u2019atar, to bring freshness and crunch to fast-cooking trout. (You could also just use za\\u2019atar itself.) The squeeze of lemon to finish is essential.\", \"View this recipe.\", \"Thanks for reading and cooking.
