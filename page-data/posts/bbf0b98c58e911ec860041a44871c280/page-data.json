In it, she acknowledged that there were \\\"indications of more mild disease\\\" from South Africa, but noted that she \\\"wanted to caution against any conclusions about [the] severity of Omicron yet, because right now we really have anecdotal information. We don't really have studies yet.\\\"\", \"And last weekend, Jerome Adams, a former U.S. Surgeon General, stated that a substantially higher transmission could cancel out lower severity in any case.\", \"Severity is only one aspect of Omicron that we don't know a lot about so far. Scientists are keen to get a clearer picture of how well the variant can resist vaccines and how transmissible it is.\", \"Some early information has been released regarding Omicron and vaccines, suggesting that vaccines do elicit some neutralization activity against the variant despite its high resistance.\", \"Two studies\\u2014one in South Africa from the Africa Health Research Institute and one from Pfizer/BioNTech\\u2014suggested that a booster shot would increase patients' capacity to combat severe disease from Omicron.\", \"Meanwhile the U.S. is experiencing a sharp rise in COVID cases overall this week, with a seven-day average of just over 117,000 daily new cases recorded on December 7, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data, marking an increase from 86,318 on December 1.\", \"There was also a seven-day average of 1,097 daily deaths on December 7, the CDC data showed, up from 842 on December 1.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1948313/maria-van-kerkhove.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Maria Van Kerkhove, COVID technical lead for the WHO, speaking at a press conference in Geneva in July, 2020.
