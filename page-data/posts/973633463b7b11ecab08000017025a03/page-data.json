news agenda around the world, but it could also have implications for sport.\", \"What exactly is COP?\", \"COP stands for \\\"conference of the parties\\\" and is an annual meeting of the 197 parties

five years ago relating to global warming.\", \"Agreement was reached at COP21 in Paris to limit global warming to well below 2C and, preferably, to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels.\",

consequences\\\" and be a \\\"climate catastrophe\\\".\", \"The meeting is being seen as of elevated importance after last year's was postponed during the pandemic and also coming after a year of unprecedented weather events: flooding in western Europe (killing at least 170 people) and China (displacing nearly 2m people), as well as the \\\"heat dome\\\" in Canada and the United States which

example of a major winter sports event which needed to use artificial snow to supplement the melting snow at Olympic venues.\", \"Matches at the 2019 Rugby World Cup, including England's meeting with France, were cancelled because of Typhoon Hagibis.\", \"The marathon at the Tokyo Olympics in 2021 was moved because of concerns about extreme heat, while competitors spoke of the brutal conditions in
