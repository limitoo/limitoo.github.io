Two-and-a-half minutes after liftoff, the stage fell away and the single engine powering the Falcon 9 second stage took over for the remainder of the ascent.\", \"The reusable first stage, meanwhile, flipped around, restarted three engines to reverse course and flew itself back to Vandenberg, touching down at Landing Zone 4 about eight minutes after liftoff. Landing marked SpaceX's 114th successful booster recovery and its fifth in California.\", \"As usual with classified payloads, SpaceX did not provide any details about the mission other than to confirm the second stage reached orbit as planned. The NRO did not release any information about the satellite payload, but confirmed mission success in a statement.\", \"\\\"I'm proud of the teamwork, skill and determination that went into making this launch a success and ultimately to delivering critical information to our nation's policymakers, military, and intelligence community,\\\" NRO Director Chris Scolese said.\", \"Added Col. Robert Bongiovi, director of the Space Systems Command's Launch Enterprise: \\\"It was superb. The integrated team, the rocket, the satellite, everything was go and this launch went smoothly.\\\"\", \"Based on the launch time and a variety of other factors including military procurement documents, independent space analysts speculated the Falcon 9 likely carried two Naval Ocean Surveillance System, or NOSS, satellites into orbit that work in pairs to electronically monitor and locate ships at sea.\", \"Bill Harwood has been covering the U.S. space program full-time since 1984, first as Cape Canaveral bureau chief for United Press International and now as a consultant for CBS News. He covered 129 space shuttle missions, every interplanetary flight since Voyager 2's flyby of Neptune and scores of commercial and military launches.
