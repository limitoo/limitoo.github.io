The central government also announced over the weekend that it was sending over 200 police reinforcements.\", \"On Monday, the remains of charred cars littered roads and schools remained closed as President Emmanuel Macron of France appealed for calm and order.\", \"\\u201cOur priority is to continue convincing that vaccination is the best protection,\\u201d Mr. Macron told reporters during a visit to Amiens, his hometown in northern France. \\u201cAnd to yield nothing to lies, disinformation and the manipulation by some of this situation.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere is a very explosive situation, tied to a very local context, to historical tensions that we know of,\\u201d Mr. Macron acknowledged, as he accused some of the government\\u2019s critics of \\u201cusing this context and these anxieties\\u201d to aggravate the situation.\", \"Over 40 percent of the adult population in Guadeloupe is fully vaccinated, but that figure is nearly 90 percent for all of France including overseas regions, according to official statistics.\", \"The unrest started last week with a strike by local unions that are opposed to France\\u2019s vaccine mandate for health workers. Those unions say it was imposed by the central government with little consultation, and are particularly infuriated that unvaccinated health professionals are suspended without pay.\", \"\\u201cThat is an unheard level of violence against them and their families,\\u201d Jean-Marie Nomertin, the secretary general of the Conf\\u00e9d\\u00e9ration G\\u00e9n\\u00e9rale du Travail de la Guadeloupe, one of the protesting unions, said in a statement last week.\", \"Protesters have also rejected France\\u2019s health pass, which is needed to gain access to restaurants, museums and other public places and can only be obtained through full vaccination, proof of Covid recovery, or a recent negative test \\u2014 which must now be paid for out of pocket for those who are not vaccinated and do not have a prescription.\", \"As in other overseas departments like R\\u00e9union or French Guiana that are a legacy of France\\u2019s colonial empire, Guadeloupe has long felt overlooked by policymakers in Paris, with decades-old anger over stagnant unemployment, high living costs and dysfunctional public utilities that have fueled protests in the past.\", \"Suspicion of public health policies is especially high in the French Caribbean, where the government authorized the use of a highly toxic pesticide called chlordecone on banana plantations for decades, despite repeated health warnings.\", \"\\u201cPeople are afraid, they have no trust,\\u201d Harry Durimel, the mayor of Pointe-\\u00e0-Pitre, told Franceinfo on Monday, adding that local residents were \\u201cready for a confrontation\\u201d over vaccine rules if they felt they were being forced \\u201cto inject a product in their body.\\u201d\", \"On the nearby island of Martinique, unions on Monday called for a general strike over similar concerns.\"]","href_hash":"c9a479234bbc11ec8fdeab451454f86b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c9a479234bbc11ec8fdeab451454f86b"}},
