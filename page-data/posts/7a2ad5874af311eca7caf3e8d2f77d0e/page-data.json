The sign was just broken.\\\"\", \"In the clip, the bus driver opened the doors and could be heard beginning to tell Benner that the sign was simply broken.\", \"\\\"This is a message operators can display in case of emergency, while simultaneously contacting SEPTA police via dispatch. This could also be for a medical emergency too, not just a police response,\\\" said SEPTA public information manager John Golden in an email.\", \"\\\"It should be noted that in the video the voice states that the driver told him he was ok and the sign was just broken temporarily,\\\" he added.\", \"Despite TikToker Benner's reassurance, many on TikTok were concerned about the welfare of the driver and, as TikTok so often does, created detailed theories surrounding what could have happened.\", \"Benner once more took to TikTok to explain that the bus driver was not a part of a hostage situation or forced to say the sign was an accident. \\\"I could see that the bus was empty, logically if this person was being held, the hostage taker wouldn't know that the sign was on (and the driver wouldn't have opened the door to say anything)\\\"\", \"\\\"But again, the bus was empty, it was just the driver and the driver let me know that the sign was just broken.\", \"\\\"Also, I grew up in Philly, these signs are often broken, i've never seen this explicit one, but the signs are often broken,\\\" he added.\", \"Benner continued that he contacted SEPTA through a Twitter DM after the popularity of the video. \\\"As the operator stated. These types of technical errors do occur,\\\" replied SEPTA.\", \"The story might not have had the ending TikTok users had theorized, but it has raised awareness of the emergency signs buses are able to use in most cities across the U.S.\", \"Boston buses, for example, also flash \\\"Emergency. Call Transport Police\\\" in cases of emergency. Massachusetts Bay Transport Police advise citizens to call Transport Police or 911 if they ever see this sign.\", \"In New York City, Metropolitan Transport Authority buses also are able to display an emergency sign reading: \\\"Emergency. Call Police.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"7a2ad5874af311eca7caf3e8d2f77d0e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7a2ad5874af311eca7caf3e8d2f77d0e"}},
