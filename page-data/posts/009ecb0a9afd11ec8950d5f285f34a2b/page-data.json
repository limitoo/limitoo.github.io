Yana Balytska traveled there from Vyshneve, near the capital Kyiv. Russian forces are poised between 20 and 40 miles north of Kyiv, and the U.S. has warned they could move to surround it within a week, but like many of the country's major cities, it has already suffered major damage from shelling. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"We left because of the shooting. They were not shooting in our town, but Kyiv was under fire and areas nearby,\\\" Balytska told Reuters. \\\"Yesterday we were standing on a platform waiting for the commuter train and literally over my head, flew the missile that hit the TV tower.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"The United Nations human rights office says at least 227 civilians have been killed since Putin launched the attack last on February 24.
