However, there are a lot of other factors at play so we have to see what happens,\\\" he said.\", \"The rising cost of fuel was described as an \\\"energy crisis\\\" by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern yesterday, as the government announced it would reduce the fuel excise duty and road user charges by 25 cents per litre, for three months.\", \"However, petrol prices are expected to continue climbing, meaning motorists would keep paying well above average over the coming months.\", \"Page believed hybrid and EVs would remain popular in the short to medium term, because motorists had become more fuel conscious when considering the cars they wanted to buy.\"]","href_hash":"3cabf34ea3ee11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3cabf34ea3ee11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
