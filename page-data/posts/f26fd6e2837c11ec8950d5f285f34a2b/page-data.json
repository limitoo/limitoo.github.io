a surprising development given that the tsunami near Tonga was relatively small.\", \"Tsunami waves, driven by gravity, travel at around 200 metres per second - roughly the speed of a jetliner.\", \"But the shockwave from the Tongan volcano had moved at more than 300 metres per second and was so powerful, scientists said, that it caused the atmosphere to ring like a bell.\", \"Through the transfer of this energy from the atmosphere to the ocean, the shockwave amplified ocean waves around the world, pushing them farther afield and accelerating their travel time - something tsunami warning centres weren't equipped to handle.\", \"The possibility of atmospheric pressure waves needs to \\\"be added to tsunami warning centres' suite of modelling and forecasting tools\\\", Fritz said.\", \"- RNZ/Reuters\"]","href_hash":"f26fd6e2837c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f26fd6e2837c11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
