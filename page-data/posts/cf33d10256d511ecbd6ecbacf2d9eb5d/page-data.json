Other more hawkish members of Congress, including Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas, have called for a total boycott of the Beijing Games.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think we felt it was the right step to penalize athletes who have been training, preparing for this moment,\\u201d Ms. Psaki said.\", \"Mr. Biden had raised the possibility of not sending the American delegation days after having a virtual meeting with China\\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, that was meant to calm boiling tensions between the two nations. Both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, as well as human rights advocates, have called on the White House to use the Winter Games to pressure Beijing over abuses against the Uyghur community and a crackdown on free speech in Hong Kong.\", \"The calls for the boycott have only intensified after the disappearance from public life of tennis star Peng Shuai, who accused a top Communist Party leader of sexual assault.\", \"Senator Bob Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, called the boycott \\u201ca powerful rebuke of the Chinese Communist Party\\u2019s campaign of genocide in Xinjiang.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis boycott is a necessary step to demonstrate our unwavering commitment to human rights in the face of the Chinese government\\u2019s unconscionable abuses,\\u201d Mr. Menendez said, adding that he hoped other nations would join the United States.\", \"Ms. Psaki said administration officials made Beijing aware of the diplomatic boycott before Monday\\u2019s announcement.\", \"China\\u2019s foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijan, previously said those calling for a boycott were \\u201cgrandstanding.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIf the U.S. insists in willfully clinging to its course, China will take resolute countermeasures,\\u201d he said.\", \"It appears the administration will move forward with the boycott without other allies. European nations are under pressure but have not made a decision on any potential diplomatic boycott.\", \"Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken told The New York Times last month that the United States was discussing with allies \\u201chow they\\u2019re thinking about participation\\u201d in the Olympics. He called it \\u201can active conversation.\\u201d\", \"The U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee previously said in a statement that it did not support a boycott preventing American athletes from competing in Beijing.\", \"The announcement of the boycott also comes ahead of Mr. Biden\\u2019s virtual global democracy summit later this week, an effort to take a public stand against authoritarianism and corruption.
