Our pop and jazz critics surveyed the latest releases and picked out 13 worthy of a seasonal spin.\", \"The standards on Kelly Clarkson\\u2019s second Christmas album are almost unfair to other interpreters \\u2014 she is that nimble a singer. (See \\u201cLast Christmas,\\u201d especially, rendered here as a vivid roller coaster.) However, it\\u2019s Clarkson\\u2019s originals \\u2014 which she sings with the kind of verve most singers not named Mariah Carey don\\u2019t bother putting into their holiday releases \\u2014 that make \\u201cWhen Christmas Comes Around \\u2026\\u201d truly stand out. \\u201cSanta, Can\\u2019t You Hear Me\\u201d with Ariana Grande is pure Motown, and \\u201cGlow\\u201d with Chris Stapleton is a worthy howl-off between two powerhouse vocalists. It\\u2019s also striking just how uncelebratory some of these songs are: \\u201cMerry Christmas (to the One I Used to Know)\\u201d is haunting; \\u201cChristmas Isn\\u2019t Canceled (Just You)\\u201d is a blissful tsk-tsk; and \\u201cMerry Christmas Baby,\\u201d about sloughing off a deadbeat partner, is deliciously icy: \\u201cHave yourself a merry Christmas/Hope it\\u2019s not as cold as you.\\u201d JON CARAMANICA\", \"Nat King Cole isn\\u2019t the only dead-and-gone genius having his voice scraped off original recordings and given the reinstall. But why is it that producers seem to feel especially entitled to pick up Cole\\u2019s voice in particular and move it around as they please? The original recordings, after all, leave almost nothing out of place. But a couple of Christmases ago, Cole got slapped together with Gregory Porter on a rewiring of his classic take on \\u201cThe Girl From Ipanema.\\u201d This year, it\\u2019s an album of Cole\\u2019s old vocal tracks pasted over flamboyant new orchestrations. A few tracks also feature manufactured duets with living vocalists: a full-frontal synth-and-strings assault on \\u201cDeck the Halls\\u201d and \\u201cJoy to the World,\\u201d combined together and sung \\u201cwith\\u201d Johnny Mathis; a more tender read on \\u201cA Nightingale Sang in Berkeley Square,\\u201d with Gloria Estefan; and \\u201cThe Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting on an Open Fire),\\u201d with John Legend. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO\", \"This is the first Christmas-themed album from Kat Edmonson \\u2014 a dapper young nostalgist, equally beguiled by Blossom Dearie and Norah Jones \\u2014 but we doesn\\u2019t need the LP\\u2019s title to tell us that it won\\u2019t be her last. The shoe fits. On Saturday, she\\u2019ll do a Christmas version of \\u201cThe Kat Edmonson Show,\\u201d her livestream series; it will be the first episode to feature her full band, which will play tunes from the album at a studio in New York. RUSSONELLO\", \"As the leader of the Gaslight Anthem, Brian Fallon had often been a full-tilt, Springsteen-style rocker. But \\u201cNight Divine\\u201d is restrained and devotional. The thoughtful arrangements, recorded at his home, are mostly folky and acoustic, and the song list leans toward hymns and the more reverential carols. Fallon digs out less frequently heard verses of songs like \\u201cO Holy Night\\u201d \\u2014 \\u201cChains He shall break, for the slave is our brother/And in His name all oppression shall cease\\u201d \\u2014 and stays humble before the messages of the songs. JON PARELES\", \"A four-time-platinum talisman of American Christmas culture, Vince Guaraldi\\u2019s piano-trio soundtrack to \\u201cA Charlie Brown Christmas\\u201d has arguably become even more iconic than the animated TV special it accompanied. Now that album \\u2014 with its coolly swinging, West Coast-jazz renditions of \\u201cO Tannenbaum\\u201d and other seasonal fare, plus Guaraldi\\u2019s classic \\u201cLinus and Lucy\\u201d \\u2014 is getting a limited-edition reissue on both vinyl and cassette; both the LP and the tape are a gleaming silver color. The LP version includes an embossed foil jacket and a vinyl album with a Charles M. Schulz illustration pressed onto it. RUSSONELLO\", \"A severely tasteful album of standards from the jazz singer Jos\\u00e9 James. \\u201cHave Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\u201d is slick and steady. \\u201cThe Christmas Song\\u201d is slick and steady. \\u201cLet It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!\\u201d \\u2014 also slick and steady! James has such an authoritatively resonant voice that even his two originals sound decades old. CARAMANICA\", \"Norah Jones is slyly understated, as both a singer and pianist, on \\u201cI Dream of Christmas.\\u201d The album intersperses new songs of her own with tunes like \\u201cBlue Christmas,\\u201d \\u201cChristmas Time Is Here\\u201d and \\u201cRun Run Rudolph,\\u201d which she borrows from Chuck Berry and turns into a slinky rumba. Yet behind the poise of her own new songs, like \\u201cIt\\u2019s Only Christmas Once a Year\\u201d and the gospelly \\u201cYou\\u2019re Not Alone,\\u201d there\\u2019s a tinge of genuine loneliness and longing, hinting at the toll of pandemic isolation. PARELES\", \"Steve Perry, formerly of Journey, must be proud of his high notes. On \\u201cThe Season,\\u201d he pushes a familiar repertoire \\u2014 \\u201cWinter Wonderland,\\u201d \\u201cAuld Lang Syne\\u201d \\u2014 down to slow tempos and up into the range where his tenor verges on falsetto. The arrangements take a vintage 1950s approach, jazz-inflected piano with a backdrop of strings. But Perry\\u2019s voice no longer soars as smoothly as it did in the \\u201cDon\\u2019t Stop Believin\\u2019\\u201d days. It hits grainy, shaky patches so often that songs built for reassurance are strained and filled with tension instead: Is he going to make it through the take? PARELES\", \"Pistol Annies \\u2014 the songwriting and vocal-harmony alliance of Miranda Lambert, Ashley Monroe and Angaleena Presley \\u2014 wrote 10 new songs for \\u201cHell of a Holiday,\\u201d dipping into retro styles like Western Swing, girl-group rock and Laurel Canyon pop-folk. Their scenarios encompass holiday cheer, faith and flirtations (\\u201cCome on Christmas Time,\\u201d which confesses to a \\u201ccrush on Santa\\u201d). But they also recognize that the holidays can be a strain. Among the handful of covers is Merle Haggard\\u2019s \\u201cIf We Make It Through December,\\u201d a stoic song from 1973 about a laid-off factory worker, while Pistol Annies also wrote about seasonal depression (\\u201cMake You Blue\\u201d) and family strife. Over the Southern rock of \\u201cHarlan County Coal,\\u201d a wife struggles to get through Christmas with a drunken husband and \\u201c47 dollars in the gol-durned bank.\\u201d PARELES\", \"Joe Robinson, an Australian guitarist, delivers an assortment of familiar Christmas songs \\u2014 among them \\u201cSilent Night,\\u201d \\u201cLet It Snow\\u201d and \\u201cHappy Xmas (War Is Over)\\u201d \\u2014 with self-effacing virtuosity on \\u201cChristmas au Chalet.\\u201d His versions are real-time acoustic guitar solos, filled with so much springy counterpoint that sometimes it\\u2019s hard to believe he\\u2019s playing alone. PARELES\", \"As She & Him, the actress and vocalist Zooey Deschanel and the sepia-tinged singer-songwriter M. Ward have always wanted to sound like they were coming to you from another time. Now they can: She & Him\\u2019s holiday album is 10 years old, and that\\u2019s seemingly reason enough for Merge Records to reissue \\u201cA Very She & Him Christmas\\u201d in a new set of throwback-themed packaging. The 10th-anniversary-edition vinyl includes a bonus seven-inch single featuring new covers of Wham!\\u2019s \\u201cThis Christmas\\u201d and Madonna\\u2019s \\u201cHoliday.\\u201d \\u201cHoliday\\u201d is a highlight: Deschanel and Ward add some synth, pick up the tempo and loosen up on the carefully cultivated aesthetics just a bit. RUSSONELLO\", \"The Nashville-based songwriter Amanda Shires rewrote \\u201cSilent Night\\u201d as a despondent, minor-key dirge \\u2014 \\u201cNothing\\u2019s calm/nothing\\u2019s been right\\u201d \\u2014 on her album \\u201cFor Christmas,\\u201d which includes nine other songs of her own. They often revolve around holiday romance, whether it\\u2019s going well (\\u201cBlame It on the Mistletoe\\u201d) or not so well (\\u201cHome to Me\\u201d). With her reedy, tremulous voice and a piano-centered band, Shires works mostly for high drama. But she allows some comedy, too, as in her cheerful shuffle, \\u201cGone for Christmas\\u201d: a wish list capped by \\u201cI want you gone for Christmas.\\u201d PARELES\", \"\\u201cChecked the fireplace and your stocking\\u2019s missing,\\u201d the R&B star Bryson Tiller sings on \\u201cBe Mine This Christmas,\\u201d a woozy, clenched, lightly sensual hymnal full of regret. On \\u201cA Different Christmas,\\u201d Tiller\\u2019s first holiday release, his vocals are heavily processed and the production is contemporary and varied, all in service of a range of holiday moods: a tender duet with his daughter on \\u201cWinter Wonderland\\u201d; snappy Atlanta bass energy on \\u201cAin\\u2019t a Lonely Christmas Song\\u201d; and on \\u201cLonely Christmas,\\u201d about a post breakup holiday, his guest Justin Bieber moodily recalling how \\u201cwe used to get our lights from Walmart.\\u201d CARAMANICA\"]","href_hash":"e1998fdc590311ec9a5fd57a4cff446e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e1998fdc590311ec9a5fd57a4cff446e"}},
