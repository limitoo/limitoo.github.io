I strongly encourage the 47 million adults who are not yet vaccinated to get vaccinated as soon as possible and to vaccinate the children and teens in their families as well because strong immunity will likely prevent serious illness. I also want to encourage people to get a COVID-19 test if they are sick. Increased testing will help us identify Omicron quickly.\\\"\", \"Prior to this statement, the CDC only recommended boosters shots to anyone age 50 or older, as well as anyone 18 or older that lived in long-term care. This was only a recommendation, however, and adults have been able to get a booster shot if they want one since October.\", \"President Joe Biden on Monday said that a new COVID-19 strategy is in the works for the winter, to be submitted by Thursday, but stressed that further lockdowns or shutdowns would not be included. When asked if such measures are still a possibility, Biden said no, stressing that the situation would not get severe enough to warrant them should enough Americans get vaccinated and wear masks.\", \"\\\"If you're 18 years or over, and got fully vaccinated before June the 1st, go get the booster shot today,\\\" Biden said, echoing the recommendation from the CDC.\"]","href_hash":"f0abe779516911ec870475b9a9963c94"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f0abe779516911ec870475b9a9963c94"}},
