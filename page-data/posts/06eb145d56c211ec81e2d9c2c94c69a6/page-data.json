told the ABC\\u00a0the results have come from a study it commissioned eight years ago after becoming worried about the impact of dust from the South32 Gemco mine.\", \"The land council said it was working with South32, which operates the mine, to reduce dust because of the high levels that were found.\", \"It said the tests on the hair and nails of children and adults living in\\u00a0Angurugu\\u00a0showed \\\"concerning\\\" levels of manganese.\", \"The problem only came\\u00a0to light because a teacher heard about testing and has raised questions about the long-term impacts of manganese exposure.\", \"Teacher Jeff Aschmann told the ABC he became concerned while working in the nearby mainland community of Numbulwar, which Groote Eylandt people regularly visit.\", \"\\\"I've been very concerned and other people have been very concerned in case there is a major impact on the wellbeing, and particularly the cognitive wellbeing of children and adults,\\\" he

to put human beings' wellbeing ahead of the money being derived from this manganese mine.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Concerning levels, but no cognitive development impact'</div>\", \"The Anindilyakwa Land Council's chief executive, Mark Hewitt, said the organisation commissioned the research after being approached by a non-government organisation,\\u00a0which was concerned manganese may have been affecting the learning abilities of local children.\", \"\\\"So the land council instigated a scientific study on that with the University of Queensland, who'd already been doing other studies of the animals here, particularly the northern quoll,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"They came and they measured levels of manganese in children and adults;\\u00a0it was a large study, and they also tested the other communities as well.\", \"\\\"But what they found was there was no indication that it had an impact on cognitive development at all.\\\"\", \"Mr Hewitt said the research on the community could not yet be released to the ABC because it hadn't yet been published.\", \"\\\"While we don't like that that is being absorbed into people who are living in the vicinity of where there is manganese, I need to say that manganese is there whether there's mining or not \\u2014\\u00a0it's just in the soil, it's just a feature of the landscape here,\\\" he said.\", \"<div

said, rather than continue to fund the research, the land council decided to work with the mining company to find and fund solutions to the dust problem.\", \"\\\"South32, to their credit, immediately embarked on extensive measures to prevent their manganese dust entering into the communities, which are in proximity to mining activities, and that work has been going on for three to four years, and it has definitely made a significant reduction,\\\" he said.\", \"Mr Hewitt said the company had\\u00a0also set up dust monitors in the community.\", \"\\\"When there is a high dust exceedence of what we consider to be acceptable, we find out the reason for that \\u2014\\u00a0often its due to the wind changing,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"They've also looked at avoiding the use of machinery close to the

accommodate that and we prioritised revegetating the bushland around Angurugu to make sure it's got that natural dust screening,\\\" he said.\", \"Mr Stower said the company's dust monitoring showed it was\\u00a0not breaching national air quality guidelines.\", \"\\\"That monitoring has shown that the ambient dust in the community of Angurugu is below the National Environmental Protection Measure, the NEPM guidelines, so that gives us a high level of confidence about the health and wellbeing of our community,\\\" he said.\", \"The Northern Territory Environment Protection Authority (EPA) does not have independent air quality measurement stations on Groote Eylandt.\", \"In a recent assessment of the risk posed by dust from the mine for an expansion onto some eastern leases, the

concentrations in their blood compared to the non-Indigenous people who lived in the township.\\\"\", \"Dr Stauber said her research showed the high manganese levels had not just come from mine dust, but also because local Aboriginal people were eating more locally grown vegetables and bush tucker.\", \"\\\"Their vegetables were grown in high manganese-enriched soil, manganese outcrops surface on Groote Eylandt in many places,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"Yams, for example, have high manganese;\\u00a0the billy tea that they used to drink was very high in manganese as well.\", \"She said to get accurate data on the level of manganese in peoples' bodies it was important to test the bit of the hair closest to the scalp, because hair quickly absorbs manganese through dust\\u00a0blood testing also provides limited information.\", \"\\\"When manganese gets into the body, it gets cleared from blood fairly quickly, and can end up in organs, such as the liver and brain;\\u00a0manganese in blood doesn't give you an indication of long-term body burdens and long-term exposure to manganese.\\\"\", \"According to the US National Institutes of Health, manganese is an essential trace element that is naturally present in many foods and available as a dietary supplement. It plays a role in enzyme and bone formation, reproduction, immune response and blood clotting.\", \"Deficiency is very rare in humans, but manganese toxicity has occurred in among certain occupations\\u00a0through chronic inhalation of manganese dust or by consuming tainted water. This mainly affects the central nervous system and can cause tremors, muscle spasms, tinnitus, hearing loss, and the feeling of being unsteady on one's feet. Additional symptoms include mania, insomnia, depression, delusions, anorexia, headaches, irritability, lower extremity weakness, changes in mood and short-term memory, altered reaction times, and reduced hand-eye coordination.\"]","href_hash":"06eb145d56c211ec81e2d9c2c94c69a6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"06eb145d56c211ec81e2d9c2c94c69a6"}},
