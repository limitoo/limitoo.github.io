Southern Living said another important factor is considering why an heirloom ring feels like the right choice.\", \"\\\"Is it because you have fond memories of time spent with your great aunt, or is it because her diamond was a flawless three-carat oval?\\\" Liz Bryant, president and founder of Liz Bryant Business Etiquette told the magazine.\", \"Though either answer is valid, Bryant advised, the emotional cost of using a family ring is important to think about.\", \"For the Redditor, her pushback about the ring is related to the ring's history\\u2014and its previous owner.\", \"The ring, which was originally her future mother-in-law's engagement ring, was given to the poster's boyfriend, Adam's, sister-in-law as her engagement ring when she wed his brother. They have since divorced leaving the Redditor with a bad taste in her mouth.\", \"\\\"Adam was excited with the idea but I was uncomfortable solely by the fact that this ring was proposed with more than once and also it belonged to my former [sister-in-law] for years and she had memories attached to it,\\\" the Redditor wrote. \\\"I feel like [that] ring already had more than one love story and I feel I have the right to wear a ring that represents our relationship and one that belongs to me and Adam.\\\"\", \"After hearing about her opinion on the matter, the Redditor's future-mother-in-law asked to meet with her to discuss the situation. She said it was \\\"a must\\\" for her son to use the ring, being the youngest, and called the Redditor disrespectful for taking issue with it given its \\\"high sentimental value.\\\"\", \"\\\"After basically shaming & wearing me down for hours about it I flatout told her that is between me and Adam but he agreed with her and said my logic don't [sic] make sense.\\\"\", \"She wrote that her boyfriend compared the matter to an apartment, asking her if she wouldn't live in an apartment just because someone else had before. She said the two were not the same and felt the ring should be a \\\"symbol\\\" of their love\", \"\\\"[M]y statement was met with a 'I don't get it. you really think a ring is more important than us being on the same page and understanding each other? Besides, that's what my mom want [sic] and to be completely honest with you here, I'm just trying to keep the peace and stay on her good side which what you should be doing TOO right now instead of already starting an unnecessary drama and setting a bad tone for your relationship with mom,'\\\" she wrote.\", \"Commenters backed the Redditor saying her boyfriend's actions showed a glimpse into how their relationship will be for years to come.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1950510/engagement-ring.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A woman took to Reddit to seek advice over a feud surrounding her boyfriend's family engagement ring.
