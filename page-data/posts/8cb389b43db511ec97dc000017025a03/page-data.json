the doorsteps of those who need them.\", \"But for Te Kura Kaupapa M\\u0101ori o Hoani Waititi tumuaki Hare Rua, the desperation runs deep due to some of his school's own tamariki testing positive to Covid-19, meaning the school is staying closed for the time being.\", \"Rua asked the Northern Region Health Coordination Centre for $120,000 to support extra vaccination drives at the school, incentives to hand out to wh\\u0101nau, and funds to run vaccination events like Super Saturday.\", \"But last week when their application was rejected, the T\\u0101maki Makaurau-based kura was forced to spend money from its own curriculum.\", \"\\\"I'm disappointed and gutted really,\\\" Rua said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/279239/two_col_Hare.jpg?1636005441\\\" alt=\\\"Te

that you know of who have tested positive for Covid 19 over the last two weeks, we've gotten behind those wh\\u0101nau and supported those wh\\u0101nau in multiple ways and the DHB turned around to us and said no, we can't help you.\\\"\", \"Rua said they were committed to mobilising into the hard-to-reach areas, but to not even receive part of the funding was upsetting and he felt that the DHB body did not truly understand how tough the fight had been on the ground.\", \"\\\"We're just a small kura doing everything we can.\", \"\\\"To me, it just felt like, 'oh well, no, we know how you feel, but we don't feel the same way'.\\\"\", \"Hoani Waititi marae, while working alongside the kura to support vaccinations, has also been delivering kai and essential items to those most

a washing machine for them, because they didn't have those.\", \"\\\"We wouldn't even have known, the only thing that really pushed them to reach out to the marae was Covid coming in and trapping them inside their house.\\\"\", \"RNZ contacted the Northern Region Health Coordination Centre, who would not confirm in a statement whether they had rejected the funding request or not.\", \"They said they were working closely with dozens of M\\u0101ori and Pacific providers and hundreds of GPs and pharmacies who were delivering vaccinations.\", \"\\\"Hoani Waititi Marae and Te Kura kaupapa Hoani Waititi are one of the many partners we have worked with on this programme and we are incredibly grateful for the support and guidance they have provided,\\\" a spokesperson said.\", \"\\\"The request

Henare said while he had not seen the application from the kura kaupapa, it does suggest poor relations between DHBs and organisations who had direct connections to neigbourhoods and communities.\",

should be doing, they should be able to do that and just get in and back us up, support us with whatever we need,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Nevermind asking questions or saying 'I don't know, does that qualify or not qualify?' because what they did was they looked at the application and business plan that I put forward to them and they said 'that doesn't qualify.\\\"\", \"The school would not reopen
