He died in late November almost a month after he was diagnosed with sepsis - an infection unrelated to COVID-19.\", \"His daughters believe he may have survived if he was admitted to a large hospital where he would've received advanced testing and prompt surgery. Instead, he stayed for 15 days at a small rural medical facility because bigger hospitals had no beds for him due to overcrowding by severely ill COVID patients needing treatment.\", \"\\\"It's infuriating that people who are not vaccinated are clogging it up,\\\" one of Weeks' children, Jenifer Owenson, tells the Des Moines Register.\\u00a0\", \"When Weeks first began feeling ill, he thought it was a side effect of the flu vaccine and booster COVID-19 shot. On November 1, he went to the hospital in Centerville, a small city near his home, where staff diagnosed him with sepsis.\", \"\\\"They told my dad and his wife right away they had no beds,\\\" Owenson says.\", \"The staff called different facilities for hours trying to find an open hospital bed. At first, the closest one they could find was in neighbouring state Illinois. But by midday the next day, they'd found a spot in MercyOne Medical Center, a small facility in Newton, about 130km north of Centerville.\", \"Owenson says despite the Newton hospital staff doing the best they could for Weeks, his infection didn't go away and the family asked if he could be moved to a more advanced hospital.\", \"\\\"We kept being told he was on a 'list of degrees of severity', and his number had not come up,\\\" Owenson says.\", \"\\\"[My dad] was extremely frustrated. He was like, 'Why can't something be done?'\\\"\", \"After 15 days, he was taken to the University of Iowa Hospitals and doctors there determined he needed surgery to clear a severe infection of an artery near his stomach.\", \"The surgery lasted 17 hours, but his family says Weeks was still struggling. One surgeon told them it was \\\"one of the worst infections\\\" they'd ever seen.\", \"A second, shorter operation didn't reverse his decline and he died on November 28.\", \"A representative of MercyOne Medical Center says they acknowledge the frustration for patients and families caused by overcrowding.\", \"\\\"In addition to an increased number of COVID-19 cases and spread of the Delta and Omicron variants, hospitals across the country are dealing with traumas and experiencing multiple types of illness,\\\" spokesperson Marcy Peterson told the Washington Post.\", \"\\\"This demand is coupled with a reduced number of staff to care for patients. These challenges can strain available resources and contribute to delays in care or other complications for patients.\\\"\", \"She also says \\\"a large percentage\\\" of COVID-19 patients at the facility are unvaccinated.\", \"According to data the Iowa Department of Public Health released on Wednesday, 80.6 percent of those hospitalised are not fully vaccinated, including 83 percent of those in intensive care.\"]","href_hash":"ed4d8f5269e011ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ed4d8f5269e011ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
