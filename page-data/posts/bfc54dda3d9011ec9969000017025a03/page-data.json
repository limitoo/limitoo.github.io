The senator said on Monday he doesn't intend to support the legislation until he knew more about the impact it would have on both the national debt and inflation.\", \"The framework for the bill released at the end of October includes what Biden's administration described as the \\\"largest effort to combat climate change in American history.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1926352/joe-manchin-climate-protesters.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Senator Joe Manchin was confronted Thursday morning by climate and hunger activists who are calling for his removal as chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.

They also called upon Biden and leading Democrats in Congress to remove Manchin from his role as chair of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee.\", \"\\\"We want to live.

Protesters were to meet east of the Washington Channel at Westminster Presbyterian Church at 6 a.m. local time on Thursday.\", \"More than 100 people participated in the protest, according to a Sunrise Movement press release. The protest followed an earlier hunger strike that participants said lasted two weeks and ended when the decision was made \\\"to eat as fuel for the rage we feel toward Joe Manchin and any Democrat who sides with him.'\", \"Lauren Maunus, the advocacy director of the Sunrise Movement, said in the organization's press release that it \\\"is egregious and completely unacceptable that Joe Manchin, who has profited millions of dollars from his family's own fossil fuel firm is in charge of creating consequential climate agenda.\\\"\", \"Maunus' statement continued by calling for Manchin's removal from his position on the committee.\", \"A protest participant identified in the Sunrise Movement's release as Kidus Girma reiterated the group's calls for progress on the proposed legislation.\", \"\\\"Our lives are worth more than his coal money and we'll keep fighting until President Biden, Joe Manchin and Democrats pass a climate and jobs package that meets the moment of the climate crisis,\\\" Girma said in the release. \\\"One sad, greedy man, cannot stand in the way of life saving climate legislation.
