hours to 8pm last night taken from 10,015 rapid antigen tests and 15,153 PCR swabs.\", \"The number of patients admitted to the state's hospitals dropped slightly to 2743, while ICU admissions were down to 209.\", \"The NSW government modelling predicted the Omicron wave would peak this week followed by a stabilisation of hospital numbers.\", \"Nearly 30 percent of the state's eligible population have had their booster shot and 93.8 percent of those aged 16 and over have had two doses.\", \"Victoria reported 20 more deaths from Covid-19 and there are 1096 people in hospital, down

be delayed indefinitely, Premier Mark McGowan has announced.\", \"McGowan called a press conference last night to announce the delay, which he said was due to the escalating health risks posed by the Omicron Covid-19 variant.\", \"The Premier said the state disaster council met on Wednesday and he received advice from the chief health officer on Thursday morning about delaying the reopening.\", \"He said a new date would be considered during the next month.\", \"Some travel conditions were still set to change on 5 February, including expanding the list of people exempt from the hard border,
