Hotels will, however, close to tourists not already staying there when the lockdown began.\", \"Austrian Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg also announced last week that Austria would\\u00a0introduce a vaccine mandate as of February\\u00a01.\", \"The details of how the mandate will work are not\\u00a0yet clear, but the government has said that people who do not adhere to the mandate will face fines.\", \"Mr Schallenberg apologised to all vaccinated people on Friday, saying it wasn't fair that they had to suffer under the renewed lockdown restrictions.
