The lawyer, Robert G. Rubin, said that because Mr. Arbery confronted and fought with Mr. McMichael at the end of the chase, Mr. McMichael had \\u201cno choice\\u201d but to fire on Mr. Arbery, \\u201cbecause if this guy gets his gun, he\\u2019s dead, or his dad\\u2019s dead.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Rubin portrayed Mr. McMichael as a selfless helper, saying he had felt a \\u201cduty\\u201d to protect his neighborhood, which had suffered a series of property crimes before the afternoon of Feb. 23, 2020, when the killing occurred.\", \"Mr. McMichael, he said, had probable cause in executing a citizen\\u2019s arrest under Georgia law because he had seen Mr. Arbery and confronted him after one of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s repeat visits to a partly constructed house in the neighborhood nearly two weeks before the shooting.\", \"The lead prosecutor, Linda Dunikoski, painted a starkly different picture of Mr. Arbery\\u2019s pursuers. She said that Mr. McMichael and the other two defendants \\u2014 Mr. McMichael\\u2019s father, Gregory McMichael, and a neighbor, William Bryan \\u2014 had made a series of reckless \\u201cdriveway decisions\\u201d that day as they decided to chase Mr. Arbery.\", \"Ms. Dunikoski said the men had \\u201cassumed the worst\\u201d about Mr. Arbery and were unjustified in pursuing him because they had no knowledge that he had committed a crime.\", \"\\u201cAll three of these defendants did everything they did based on assumptions,\\u201d said Ms. Dunikoski, a senior assistant district attorney for Cobb County, Ga. \\u201cAnd they made decisions in their driveways based on those assumptions that took a young man\\u2019s life.\\u201d\", \"The general thrust of these arguments had been telegraphed by lawyers in pretrial motions and interviews. On Friday, they were presented to a jury that had taken more than two weeks to select, and ended up composed of one Black person and 11 white people \\u2014 a lopsided ratio that prompted some activists, residents and relatives of Mr. Arbery to wonder whether the trial would be fair.\", \"The first witness called in the trial gave a gruesome account of the scene after the killing. When William Duggan, a Glynn County police officer, arrived in the Satilla Shores neighborhood that afternoon, he said he saw Mr. Arbery lying on the ground with people milling about. Seated on the ground nearby was Travis McMichael.\", \"\\u201cI could see he was covered in blood,\\u201d Mr. Duggan said. \\u201cThere was blood all over, and I remember at some point asking if he was OK.\\u201d\", \"Mr. McMichael replied, \\u201cNo, I\\u2019m not OK,\\u201d Mr. Duggan testified. \\u201cI just eff-ing killed somebody.\\u201d\", \"A good portion of the opening statements focused on the fact that Mr. Arbery had been spotted inside the partly built house on the McMichaels\\u2019 block moments before the men chased him. Mr. Arbery had been captured on surveillance cameras visiting the house four other times, but no evidence has emerged that he ever took anything.\", \"Judge Timothy R. Walmsley of Superior Court has prohibited the jury from hearing that Mr. Arbery, according to court documents, was suffering from mental illness, and had reported auditory delusions that sometimes commanded him to \\u201crob and steal.\\u201d The judge also prohibited jurors from hearing about Mr. Arbery\\u2019s criminal record, saying it was \\u201cneither relevant or admissible.\\u201d\", \"On the afternoon of Feb. 23, another neighbor saw Mr. Arbery in the house and called the police. But Ms. Dunikoski, the prosecutor, said the defendants themselves lacked any \\u201cimmediate knowledge\\u201d that Mr. Arbery had committed a crime that day. \", \"Asked by the police later if Mr. Arbery had broken into the house, Gregory McMichael said he did not know. \\u201cMy intention was to stop this guy so that he could be arrested or be identified at the very least,\\u201d he told the police, according to Ms. Dunikoski.\", \"The prosecution\\u2019s assertion that the three men had no \\u201cimmediate knowledge\\u201d that a crime was committed represents an effort to push back against the defense lawyers\\u2019 assertion that the men were making a legal arrest under Georgia\\u2019s citizen\\u2019s arrest law, which was largely repealed by the state Legislature after widespread outcry over Mr. Arbery\\u2019s killing. That law previously stated that a private person may arrest someone \\u201cif the offense is committed in his presence or within his immediate knowledge.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Dunikoski described at length how the three men chased Mr. Arbery for five minutes as he ran through their neighborhood, trying to evade them \\u2014 the McMichaels in one pickup truck and Mr. Bryan in another. \", \"At some point during the pursuit, she said, Gregory McMichael, who was armed with a handgun, said to Mr. Arbery, \\u201cStop or I\\u2019ll blow your fucking head off.\\u201d\", \"She said that Mr. Bryan, who had joined the chase later than the McMichaels, tried to hit Mr. Arbery four times with his pickup truck, at one point forcing him into a ditch.\", \"Ms. Dunikoski stressed that Mr. Arbery was unarmed. And she played the video that Mr. Bryan recorded on his cellphone, showing the moments when the two trucks had pinned Mr. Arbery in. She said that Gregory McMichael later contended that Mr. Arbery had been \\u201ctrapped like a rat.\\u201d\", \"The video shows Travis McMichael pointing the shotgun at Mr. Arbery as he ran toward the McMichaels\\u2019 truck. The two men appear to meet head-on in front of the vehicle.\", \"\\u201cWhat did McMichael do with that shotgun?\\u201d Ms. Dunikoski said. \\u201cHe stepped around that open door and moved toward Mr. Arbery.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Dunikowski said that in interviews with the police, Travis McMichael said that Mr. Arbery attacked him and that he was acting in self-defense.\", \"But she also said that when the police asked him if Mr. Arbery grabbed his shotgun, Mr. McMichael said, \\u201cI want to say he did, but I honestly cannot remember.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Rubin, the lawyer for Travis McMichael, spent the first part of his statement focusing on the break-ins and property crimes in Satilla Shores, where Mr. McMichael was living in his parents\\u2019 house. It was a neighborhood \\u201con edge,\\u201d Mr. Rubin said. \", \"In some of the instances in which Mr. Arbery was captured on video inside the partly built house, its owner, Larry English, had called the police, but Mr. Arbery had vanished before they arrived. Mr. English, Mr. Rubin said, had been telling neighbors that a suspicious person had been visiting the house and that items had been taken from a boat he sometimes kept on the property.\", \"On the day of the confrontation and the killing, Mr. Rubin said, Mr. McMichael had probable cause to assume that a burglary had occurred \\u2014 thus giving him the right to make a citizen\\u2019s arrest. And, he said, Mr. McMichael had encountered Mr. Arbery himself 12 days before the shooting and had reason to suspect that he might be armed.\", \"After the shooting, Mr. Rubin said, Mr. McMichael was \\u201cdistraught\\u201d and \\u201cupset.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s no glee in having done what he just did. It\\u2019s awful,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"294fe2d43e8f11ecb58cb1b3d2f52980"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"294fe2d43e8f11ecb58cb1b3d2f52980"}},
