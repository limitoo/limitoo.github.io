The city announced that barricades would be erected to prohibit access to the city after 4 p.m. Monday. \", \"Flooding then disabled the city\\u2019s waste water system, a municipal notice said, warning that anyone who stayed faced a \\u201crisk of mass sewage backup\\u201d that could threaten their health.\", \"\\u201cMerritt residents cannot use any water, including running faucets and flushing toilets,\\u201d British Columbia\\u2019s minister of public safety, Mike Farnworth, said at a news conference on Monday.\", \"Merritt officials said floodwaters had also inundated two bridges that spanned the river, which flows for 59 miles from the Cascade mountain range, and overwhelmed a third bridge, making it impassable.\", \"As of Monday afternoon, there had been no confirmed reports of fatalities from any accidents related to the severe weather, Mr. Farnworth said. \", \"\\u201cTo the people of Merritt, and to all British Columbians affected by the flooding: please stay safe,\\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Twitter on Monday. \\u201cWe\\u2019re ready to provide whatever assistance is needed as you deal with and recover from the flooding and this extreme weather.\\u201d\", \"Bill Blair, the minister of emergency preparedness, said the government was \\u201cclosely monitoring\\u201d conditions in southern British Columbia.\", \"In Agassiz, a small community east of Vancouver, Mayor Sylvia Pranger declared a state of emergency after a landslide occurred and a flood watch warning was issued for the District of Kent, which includes Agassiz. The landslide blocked traffic along two roadways, officials said: Rockwell Drive, stretching about 1.5 miles, and the Lougheed Highway, which runs for about 95 miles and is also known as Highway 7.\", \"Martina Martinkova, who was driving with her daughter on that highway near Agassiz, spent more than half a day in her car, which was one of at least dozens of vehicles brought to a standstill by the muck.\", \"\\u201cMany people\\u201d in the area were rescued by helicopter on Monday, Mr. Farnworth said, without providing exact numbers. \", \"In an interview aired by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, Ms. Martinkova, sitting in her dark car with her child peering over her shoulder from the back seat, said people in vehicles around her were sharing food and water throughout the ordeal.\", \"\\u201cWe were very lucky it didn\\u2019t hit us,\\u201d she said of the landslide, adding that the group had fruit and Coke. \\u201cIt is very scary.\\u201d\", \"Paul Doel, who became trapped with his family in a pickup on Sunday night because of two mudslides north of Hope, British Columbia, told the CBC that he and other stranded motorists had \\u201cbuilt a little bit of a community.\\u201d\", \"He said that at the largest of the two slides, \\u201cit looks like the side of the mountain has just come apart,\\u201d leaving a huge pile of debris along a large stretch of the highway.\", \"On Sunday, before he became stuck, Mr. Doel said that the heavy rain had washed out several sections of the highway and created deep potholes that destroyed the tires of several vehicles.\", \"About 150 people were trapped in Mr. Doel\\u2019s group, he said, including health care workers and a highway department crew member. Despite the long hours without word from the authorities, he said no one had panicked. \\u201cWe\\u2019re just hanging out,\\u201d he said, adding: \\u201cWe\\u2019ve got internet so that\\u2019s saving a lot of people.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Farnworth told reporters on Monday that about 80 to 100 vehicles had become trapped on Highway 7, and that emergency workers had rescued many people in the area, adding that exact numbers were being assessed. \", \"\\u201cProgress had been made,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve heard from people who are concerned about their loved ones being in their vehicles and trapped on these slides. We hear you, and we know it\\u2019s difficult. But help is on the way.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Farnworth said Monday afternoon that crews were working to rescue \\u201cthe remaining people\\u201d in Agassiz and Hope over the next few hours. \", \"\", \"On Monday afternoon, a Royal Canadian Air Force squadron was assisting with the rescue efforts using helicopters.\", \"The heavy rainfall extended into the Pacific Northwest of the United States, including Washington State. The weather system was caused by an atmospheric river, part of a convergence of storms that was so vast that it swept from California into Washington and southern British Columbia.\", \"Heavy rains caused flooding across parts of Washington on Monday, including in the city of Forks, in a northwest corner of the state, where helicopter crews were needed to evacuate 10 people from a residential area, according to the U.S. Coast Guard of the Pacific Northwest.\", \"In Whatcom County, in a northern part of the state that borders Canada, flooding prompted rescue operations, according to the Whatcom County Sheriff\\u2019s Office, and a mudslide shut down part of Interstate 5, according to the Washington State Patrol. \", \"Justin Pullin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service Seattle, said the region has experienced a \\u201creally wet fall this year.\\u201d\", \"This week, the region was under a \\u201clong-duration rainfall event,\\u201d resulting in saturated grounds that, combined with the strong winds, have made bluffs unstable.\", \"The severe weather comes after weeks of wildfires in the region. The authorities have warned that areas where vegetation has been shorn by fires could become susceptible to streams of rushing mud during heavy rains. Merritt had experienced record high temperatures and wildfires during the summer.\"]","href_hash":"57e3ee05467a11ec92ec816ff41676be"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"57e3ee05467a11ec92ec816ff41676be"}},
