The bullwhip effect travels from the customer to the retailer to the distributor to the manufacturer, which furiously increases production to meet demand that turns out to be phantom.\", \"My question: If the bullwhip effect is well known \\u2014 and it certainly is, judging by the recent spate of Wall Street reports and news stories \\u2014 why does it continue to wreak such havoc? Why don\\u2019t the various players along the supply chain recognize that the orders they\\u2019re getting aren\\u2019t a sign of lasting demand and adjust accordingly? Is there any hope of suppressing the bullwhip effect? I asked some experts that question and got some fascinating answers.\", \"First, why this matters. The bullwhip effect is a major contributor to the current burst of inflation, which is the worst in decades. Consumer prices rose 6.8 percent in November from a year earlier, the most since 1982. The Producer Price Index for final demand rose 9.6 percent in November from a year earlier. The gyrating prices of lumber, iron and coal are a classic indication that a bullwhip is at work.\", \"In theory, the bullwhip effect is nothing more than a short-term phenomenon. To the degree that prices of goods are inflated by an artificial spike in demand, they should recede quickly as production jumps and shortages become gluts. But there\\u2019s a risk that if the spike lasts a long time, people will start to expect higher inflation, which would become a self-fulfilling prophecy through higher wage demands and so on.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s something of a race against time here because if this lasts, it\\u2019s going to feed into these classic wage-price spirals that will make the inflation much more persistent,\\u201d Hyun Song Shin, the economic adviser and head of research at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland, told me this week.\", \"To see how the bullwhip effect works, think about how a whip cracks. A jerk of the handle sends a wave down the length of the whip. Because momentum is conserved and the mass of the part of the whip as you get toward the tip approaches zero, the velocity at the tip becomes extreme, exceeding the speed of sound. (I recommend this totally cool YouTube video of some whip experiments by Smarter Every Day.)\", \"The same thing occurs in supply chains. An auto manufacturer gets nervous about Covid-19, so it preorders computer chips. The distributor interprets the order as a sign of increasing demand, so it orders more from the factory, with a safety cushion of extra orders. And so it continues, going all the way back to the chip fabricator and its suppliers at the far end of the whip, which are suddenly overwhelmed by a cascade of orders. And when products aren\\u2019t delivered on time, purchasing managers panic and place fresh orders, making the problem even worse.\", \"The problem is thoroughly understood and well documented. In 1938 the economist Mordecai Ezekiel proposed the cobweb theorem of price setting in a U.S. Department of Agriculture bulletin. Farmers raise production when prices are high, but that causes prices to fall, so farmers cut production the next season, which causes prices to rise again. Depending on the shape of the supply and demand curves, prices can spiral inward on the cobweb toward stability or outward toward chaos.\", \"In the 1950s Jay W. Forrester, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, discovered the bullwhip effect (a.k.a. the Forrester effect) while studying how mistakes in inventory management produced a boom-bust cycle at a General Electric refrigerator plant in Lexington, Ky. He created a teaching tool originally called the refrigerator game but later called the beer game: Teams of students try to run a supply chain for beer production and delivery as efficiently as possible.\", \"What\\u2019s hilarious about the beer game is that participants routinely fail \\u2014 and badly. What\\u2019s less hilarious is that generations of students at business schools around the world who failed at the beer game are now making purchasing decisions at big, important companies and presumably failing once more.\", \"The question, again, is why it\\u2019s so hard to fix this problem. Human nature is partly to blame. John Sterman, who holds the Jay W. Forrester chair at M.I.T.\\u2019s Sloan School of Management and runs the beer game there now, said it\\u2019s natural to hoard when there\\u2019s a risk of shortages. In a 2020 article he cited a cartoon from World War II in which a shopper who\\u2019s caught loading up on cans of food says: \\u201cI\\u2019m not hoarding. I\\u2019m just stocking up before the hoarders get here!\\u201d\", \"The voice in the purchasing manager\\u2019s head that says \\u201cOrder more\\u201d comes straight from the amygdala and limbic system, ancient parts of the brain that overwhelm the rational prefrontal cortex. \\u201cPeople are not very good at keeping track of the supply line,\\u201d Sterman told me. \\u201cThe most salient information that they\\u2019ve got is, do they have inventory? The on-hand inventory plays an outsize role in conditioning their decisions.\\u201d\", \"Sterman said that when he played the beer game with executives in an executive education program last week, one team racked up costs on paper of $190,000. Correct play should keep costs under $1,000. \\u201cMany of them said, \\u2018Absolutely, we\\u2019re living this right now,\\u2019\\u201d he told me. \\u201cOne guy said, \\u2018This game was my whole career flashing before my eyes.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Information technology can help by offering greater transparency. If people can see that the goods they\\u2019ve ordered are en route, they\\u2019ll be less likely to double- or triple-order.\", \"But tech isn\\u2019t a cure-all. Replacing emotional people with unemotional algorithms won\\u2019t solve the bullwhip effect because the effect isn\\u2019t just about emotions. It can be rational to overorder if you\\u2019re worried about shortages. And it can be rational for a producer to ramp up production to satisfy those orders if it wants to make some money and stay in the good graces of its customers.\", \"What would work better is fixing incentives. Ted Stank, the faculty director of the Global Supply Chain Institute at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, said that companies need to change how executives are paid, \\u201cso that everyone feels the pain of excess inventory.\\u201d That seems straightforward, but it\\u2019s not, he said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s empire building within organizations. People will say, \\u2018I have autonomy. I don\\u2019t want metrics on my list of key performance indicators that I don\\u2019t have direct control over.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Aligning incentives to suppress the bullwhip effect is hardest in big organizations, Stank said. \\u201cIf you have a 100,000-person organization operating across 150 countries, it just becomes really, really messy.\\u201d\", \"Even if you get the incentives right within a company, you still have the problem of communications between companies, which don\\u2019t know how seriously to take each other\\u2019s orders. Shin, of the Bank for International Settlements, sees a role for government in facilitating communication between the various players. He likens the opportunity to how the Federal Reserve Bank of New York convened 14 banks and brokerage firms to invest in the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management to save it from collapse in 1998.\", \"The Biden administration is already doing that, to some extent. It has a task force for supply chain disruptions whose mission is to \\u201cact as an honest broker to encourage companies, workers and others to stop finger-pointing and start collaborating.\\u201d\", \"Said Shin: \\u201cWe typically don\\u2019t think about public authorities going in and directing resources on the real side of the economy. It\\u2019s a fine line. You don\\u2019t want to be in there shifting boxes of goods here and there. But to facilitate, that\\u2019s entirely legitimate.\\u201d\", \"Alabama is pretty good in football and UConn in women\\u2019s basketball, but it\\u2019s rare to find a dynasty as durable as the Pace University Federal Reserve Team, which last month won the national College Fed Challenge for the fifth time in eight years. Competitors in this event act as the Fed\\u2019s rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, analyzing economic and financial conditions and formulating a monetary policy recommendation. Fed officials choose the winners. Eighty percent of the Pace team\\u2019s members this year are women; Yuwei Liu, a co-captain, hails from Beijing. Since 2004, students at Pace, which has campuses in Lower Manhattan and Westchester County, N.Y., have won the competition more than any other school. This year the University of Pennsylvania finished second and Dartmouth third.\", \"\\u201cEspecially in digital markets where quickly achieving scale and amassing data is paramount, firms may determine that pursuing unfair or deceptive tactics is worth the cost of business, given that even an early lead can result in a long-term advantage.\\u201d\", \"\\u2014 Lina Khan, chair of the Federal Trade Commission, in a speech on Dec. 6\"]","href_hash":"2e66cdc05de611ec88b9511de08d1ced"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2e66cdc05de611ec88b9511de08d1ced"}},
