The two adolescents, best friends since the second grade, walk hand in hand through the thrills and pains of growing up \\u2014 first time drinking, first time in a motel room with an older guy who thinks you\\u2019re in college, the casual stereotypes of Asian Americans that get tossed around casually and cruelly. Jane distinguishes their friend Won from the spoiled sons of fathers \\u201cwho owned a chain of liquor stores or gas stations or SAT cram schools. We knew Koreans like that, sure.\\u201d\", \"While Ho, born in Taiwan and raised in California, circles sexuality, money and religion with grace, the most moving parts of the book are about the two women\\u2019s respective family roots. Jane\\u2019s father is a gay man who begins a new life in Taiwan while she and her Christian mother live in California, and he tells Jane about his sexuality when she visits Taiwan as a teenager. What follows is a string of events that feel to her like a turning point in her life\\u2019s trajectory. Fiona on the other hand spends her early years in Taiwan, not knowing her father is alive until right before she and her mother move to America. Her father, it turns out, never knew about her.\", \"The two women grow apart in their 20s, as Ho provocatively examines culpability and personhood through defining moments in her characters\\u2019 disparate lives \\u2014 quitting law school, stealing a lover\\u2019s Rolex, caring for a friend with cancer. When Jane spills her father\\u2019s secret, he \\u201ckept saying it was OK, over and over again, as if that might make it true.\\u201d When Fiona confesses that a lover has taken all of her savings, her mother offers to give her what little savings she has of her own. Again and again Ho reveals the protagonists\\u2019 actions to be not just inevitable, but forgivable.\", \"Certain descriptions feel overdone and stilted: A passing waiter is immediately \\u201ca Lower East Side hipster with a Sailor Moon tattoo.\\u201d Jane\\u2019s dad\\u2019s cherished comic books play a significant role in one story, only to be fully reintroduced in a later one, as if the reader has never encountered them before. The collection wraps too neatly, when Jane, a writer, tells Fiona she wants to write about their friendship in a book, titled \\u201cJane and Fiona.\\u201d\", \"But regardless, over the course of the book Fiona and Jane become real and electric and precious people. The stories move through intimate, cinematic scenes \\u2014 of Fiona\\u2019s tender, final lovemaking with an ex-boyfriend in New York, of a quiet moment when Jane passes from room to room in her apartment in California, feeling alone and \\u201cturning on the lamps, as though searching for something.\\u201d The world Ho creates between the two women feels like one friend reading the other\\u2019s story, wishing she were there.\", \"In \\u201cGo Slow,\\u201d there is a moment when the two women are parked in a car eating taquitos with Won. The music is turned off, the ocean waves are beating against the night and no one is saying a word. \\u201cHere with Fiona and Won, I didn\\u2019t want to be saved,\\u201d Jane thinks. \\u201cI made a silent wish to stay like this forever, the three of us, perfect.\\u201d In \\u201cFiona and Jane,\\u201d it is through compassion that the characters belong like this to each other, and to the reader, too.\"]","href_hash":"84e6147c6c7c11eca8dc1f37e034c768"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"84e6147c6c7c11eca8dc1f37e034c768"}},
