Next on his agenda: Kyiv and Moscow.","country":"us","create_time":"2022-02-06T18:10:39.000Z","content":"[\"BERLIN \\u2014 One headline asked, \\u201cWhere is Olaf Scholz?\\u201d A popular magazine mocked the German chancellor\\u2019s \\u201cart of disappearance.\\u201d And his ambassador in Washington wrote home that Germany was increasingly seen as an unreliable ally in a leaked memo that was all the buzz this past week and began with the words: \\u201cBerlin, we have a problem.\\u201d\", \"With the threat of war hanging over Europe and rising tensions in the standoff with Russia over Ukraine, Mr. Scholz is headed to Washington on Monday for his first meeting with President Biden since taking over as chancellor in December. Foremost on his agenda: Show the world that Berlin is committed to the Western alliance \\u2014 and, well, show his face.\", \"Less than two months after taking over from Angela Merkel, his towering and long-serving predecessor, Mr. Scholz is drawing sharp criticism at home and abroad for his lack of leadership in one of the most serious security crises in Europe since the end of the Cold War.\", \"His Social Democrat-led government, an untested three-way coalition with the Greens and Free Democrats, has refused to send arms to Ukraine, most recently offering 5,000 helmets instead. And it has been cagey about the type of sanctions that could be imposed in the event of a Russian invasion.\", \"As for the chancellor, he has made himself conspicuously scarce in recent weeks \\u2014 so scarce that the newsmagazine Der Spiegel described him as \\u201cnearly invisible, inaudible.\\u201d\", \"While President Emmanuel Macron of France and Prime Minister Mario Draghi of Italy have been busy calling President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Mr. Scholz has so far neither picked up the phone to Moscow nor visited. He has not gone to Kyiv, Ukraine, yet, either, and his visit to Washington, some note, took almost two months to organize.\", \"Last week, Emily Haber, Germany\\u2019s ambassador to the United States, sent a memo to Berlin, warning of \\u201cimmense\\u201d damage to Germany\\u2019s reputation. It was not just the news media but many in the U.S. Congress who questioned Germany\\u2019s reliability, she reported. In the view of many Republicans, she wrote, Berlin is \\u201cin bed with Putin\\u201d in order to keep the gas flowing.\", \"It has not helped that since then, Gerhard Schr\\u00f6der, a former German chancellor from Mr. Scholz\\u2019s Social Democrats, accused Ukraine of \\u201csaber rattling\\u201d and just on Friday announced that he would join the board of Gazprom, Russia\\u2019s most prominent energy company.\", \"\\u201cScholz\\u2019s central mission for his Washington visit has to be restoring German credibility,\\u201d said Thorsten Benner, a founder and the director of the Global Public Policy Institute in Berlin.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not how Mr. Scholz envisaged his first U.S. trip as chancellor,\\u201d Mr. Benner added. \\u201cBut international security was never near the top of his agenda.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Scholz, 63, has been a familiar figure in German politics for more than two decades. He was general secretary of his party and mayor of the northern port city of Hamburg before serving in two governments led by Ms. Merkel\\u2019s conservatives, most recently as her finance minister.\", \"A labor lawyer and lifelong Social Democrat, Mr. Scholz narrowly won the election last fall on a platform promising workers \\u201crespect\\u201d and a higher minimum wage, while nudging Germany on a path to a carbon-neutral future.\", \"Foreign policy barely featured in his election campaign, but it has come to dominate the first weeks of the new administration. Rarely has a German leader come into office with so many burning crises. As soon as Mr. Scholz took over from Ms. Merkel in early December, he had to deal not just with a resurgent pandemic but with a Russian president mobilizing troops on Ukraine\\u2019s borders.\", \"\\u201cIt wasn\\u2019t the plan,\\u201d said Thomas Kleine-Brockhoff, the vice president of the Berlin office of the German Marshall Fund. \\u201cThis is a government that has huddled around an ambitious plan of industrial transformation, but the reality of a crisis-ridden world has interfered with their plans.\\u201d\", \"Of all of the crises, the standoff with Russia has proved particularly uncomfortable for Mr. Scholz. His Social Democrats have traditionally favored a policy of working with Moscow. During the Cold War, Chancellor Willy Brandt engineered \\u201cOstpolitik,\\u201d a policy of rapprochement with Russia.\", \"The last Social Democratic chancellor, Mr. Schr\\u00f6der, is not just a close friend of Mr. Putin\\u2019s, he has also been on the payroll of various Russian energy companies since 2005, notably Nord Stream 1 and Nord Stream 2, the two gas pipelines connecting Russia directly with Germany under the Baltic Sea.\", \"It was not until last week, after Mr. Schr\\u00f6der\\u2019s comments about Ukraine, that Mr. Scholz felt compelled to publicly distance himself from the former chancellor.\", \"\\u201cThere is only one chancellor, and that is me,\\u201d he told the public broadcaster ZDF.\", \"His party\\u2019s divisions over Russia are one way to explain why Mr. Scholz has shrunk away from taking a bolder lead in the standoff with Russia, prompting some to lament the loss of leadership of his conservative predecessor.\", \"Mr. Scholz won the election last year primarily by convincing voters that he would be very much like Ms. Merkel. Terse, well briefed and abstaining from any gesture of triumph, he not only learned to sound like the former chancellor, he even emulated her body language, holding his hands together in her signature diamond shape.\", \"But now that he is running the country, that is no longer enough. German voters are hungry for Mr. Scholz to reveal himself and increasingly impatient to learn who he is and what he actually stands for.\", \"As the current crisis unfolds, Mr. Scholz\\u2019s imitation of Ms. Merkel is also less and less convincing. She was understated and studious, and often kept her work behind the scenes, but she was not invisible.\", \"In the spring of 2014, after Mr. Putin invaded Crimea, Ms. Merkel was on the phone to him almost every day. It was Berlin that united reluctant European neighbors behind costly sanctions and persuaded President Barack Obama, distracted by domestic affairs, to focus on a faraway conflict.\", \"At that point, of course, Ms. Merkel had already been chancellor for nine years and knew all of the protagonists well.\", \"\\u201cThe crisis came very soon for Scholz,\\u201d said Christoph Heusgen, a veteran diplomat and Ms. Merkel\\u2019s foreign policy adviser during the last Ukraine crisis.\", \"Mr. Scholz\\u2019s advisers have been taken aback by the level of criticism, arguing that Mr. Scholz was merely doing what Ms. Merkel had so often done: Make yourself scarce and keep people guessing while engaging in quiet diplomacy until you have a result.\", \"When Mr. Scholz has spoken up on the current crisis \\u2014 referring to the Russia-owned gas pipeline Nord Stream 2 as a \\u201cprivate-sector project\\u201d before pivoting to saying that \\u201ceverything\\u201d was on the table \\u2014 he has conspicuously recycled language that Ms. Merkel used before.\", \"But given the escalation in the current crisis, that language is long outdated, analysts say.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s overlearned the Merkel style,\\u201d Mr. Kleine-Brockhoff of the German Marshall Fund said. \\u201cHe\\u2019s Merkel-plus, and that doesn\\u2019t work in a crisis.\\u201d\", \"After facing mounting criticism from Kyiv and other Eastern European capitals, Mr. Scholz\\u2019s leadership is increasingly being questioned at home, too.\", \"In a recent Infratest Dimap poll, Mr. Scholz\\u2019s personal approval rating plummeted by 17 percentage points, to 43 percent from 60 percent in early January, the sharpest decline for a chancellor in postwar history, the firm says. Support for his Social Democrats fell to 22 percent, lagging the conservatives for the first time since last year\\u2019s surprise election victory.\", \"Mr. Scholz\\u2019s team announced that after returning from Washington, the chancellor will pivot to a full schedule that he hopes will shift German diplomacy into high gear. Following his meeting with Mr. Biden, he will meet with Mr. Macron; the Polish president, Andrzej Duda; and the three leaders of the Baltic States. The week after, he will travel to Kyiv and Moscow, in that order.\", \"Senior diplomats say it is high time for such a pivot, starting with Monday\\u2019s visit to the White House.\", \"Mr. Scholz has a seeming center-left ally in Mr. Biden, who has so far refrained from publicly criticizing Berlin. Not since President Bill Clinton\\u2019s second term have both the White House and the German chancellery been in the hands of center-left leaders, and for all of the wavering on the German side, the two administrations have been in close contact throughout.\", \"But patience is running thin, and Mr. Scholz will have to bring something to the table.\", \"\\u201cThere has to be a visible sign of commitment to the alliance,\\u201d Mr. Kleine-Brockhoff said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s what other allies are doing: The Spanish, the Baltic countries, the Poles, the Brits \\u2014 everyone has offered something to strengthen deterrence on the eastern flank.\\u201d\", \"In a televised interview before leaving for the United States on Sunday, Mr. Scholz hinted that Germany might beef up its troop presence in Lithuania. He also mentioned the possibility of additional air patrols in eastern and Central Europe.\", \"As important as any material commitment may be the words Mr. Scholz uses \\u2014 or does not use \\u2014 to publicly communicate that commitment.\", \"\\u201cMaybe for the first time he could mention Nord Stream 2 by name when talking about possible sanctions,\\u201d Mr. Kleine-Brockhoff said. \", \"\\u201cHe needs to make a clear statement that Germany gets the situation and will stand with its allies.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b6e05de487ba11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b6e05de487ba11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
