Users will bring their own drugs.\", \"New York, the country\\u2019s most populous city, will become the first U.S. city to open officially authorized injection sites \\u2014 facilities that opponents view as magnets for drug abuse but proponents praise as providing a less punitive and more effective approach to addressing addiction.\", \"Other cities including Philadelphia, San Francisco, Boston and Seattle have taken steps toward supervised injection but have yet to open sites amid debate over the legal and moral implications of sanctioning illegal drug use.\", \"The two Manhattan sites are already operating as needle exchange programs, and some residents in the communities have already raised concerns about the decision to place them in less affluent areas of the borough.\", \"In an interview, Dr. Dave A. Chokshi, the city\\u2019s health commissioner, said the city was moving forward to address a public health crisis.\", \"\\u201c2020, unfortunately was the deadliest year on record for overdoses both here in New York City as well as nationally. Every four hours, someone dies of a drug overdose in New York City,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe feel a deep conviction and also sense of urgency in opening overdose prevention centers.\\u201d\", \"Mayor Bill de Blasio began championing safe injection sites in 2018, citing their use and success in European and Canadian cities. The decision to officially allow the sites to open comes during the mayor\\u2019s last few weeks in office and as he considers a run for governor. He said in a statement that the decision will show other cities that \\u201cafter decades of failure, a smarter approach is possible.\\u201d\", \"The mayor also sent a letter to the providers promising \\u201cnot to take enforcement action\\u201d against their operations and saying that the city has secured the support of law enforcement agencies. Four of the city\\u2019s five district attorneys \\u2014 excluding only the Staten Island district attorney, Michael McMahon \\u2014 support supervised drug sites.\", \"\\u201cWe have always been trying to strike the right balance between enforcement, rehabilitation and prevention,\\u201d Cyrus R. Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney, said in an interview. \\u201cI would rather have people who are going to shoot up do it in a safe and secure venue as opposed to a McDonald\\u2019s bathroom, an alleyway or a subway staircase. \\u201d\", \"Nationally, overdose deaths rose to more than 100,000 in the 12-month period that ended in April, according to the National Center for Health Statistics, an increase of close to 30 percent from the 78,000 overdose deaths during the same period in the previous year.\", \"More than 2,000 people died of a drug overdose in New York City in 2020, the highest total since the city began keeping track of overdose deaths in 2000. During the first three months of 2021, there were close to 600 overdose deaths, according to preliminary data.\", \"The city will not operate or staff the drug injection sites, Dr. Chokshi said. The two nonprofits that run the needle exchange programs \\u2014 New York Harm Reduction Educators and Washington Heights Corner Project \\u2014 are merging to form OnPoint NYC and will expand their services to offer supervised injection at the current sites, he said. The city provides funding to the two nonprofits.\", \"\\u201cI know deep in my soul that we are doing the right thing,\\u201d said Sam Rivera, the executive director of OnPoint. \\u201cThe data doesn\\u2019t lie.\\u201d He said the sites expected to start operating on Tuesday.\", \"Federal law, however, has yet to catch up. A federal law often referred to as the \\u201ccrack house statute\\u201d makes it illegal to operate, own or rent a location for the purpose of using illegal substances. The Justice Department, under the Trump administration, sued in 2019 to stop a supervised injection facility in Philadelphia from opening.\", \"The Biden administration has embraced harm reduction methods but has not explicitly endorsed supervised injection sites. Dr. Chokshi said the city has had \\u201cproductive conversations\\u201d with federal and state health officials, and he believes that the facilities will be allowed to operate because of a \\u201ca shared sense of urgency\\u201d about addressing the overdose crisis.\", \"Michael Botticelli, the former director of the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy under President Barack Obama, said the Department of Justice did not prosecute states when recreational marijuana use began to be legalized around the country.\", \"\\u201cMany cities have been waiting for someone to go first, particularly to see what the federal Department of Justice reaction is going to be,\\u201d Mr. Botticelli said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s hugely important, not just from a public health perspective but for other communities around the country that have been contemplating this to be able to point to New York City and say we are doing this in the United States.\\u201d\", \"In East Harlem, already home to a heavy concentration of methadone clinics and other drug treatment centers, Eva Chan, a member of Community Board 11, has been bracing for the opening of an injection site and lamented that it would just further cement the neighborhood\\u2019s status as a place where drug use and sales are tolerated.\", \"\\u201cIf every district in New York City has one site and it\\u2019s not right next to my home, I\\u2019m not against it,\\u201d Ms. Chan said. \\u201cBut the root cause of why people are shooting up here is that they\\u2019ve been using East Harlem as a dumping ground for a long time. So they don\\u2019t address the root cause.\\u201d\", \"Proponents of supervised injection sites argue that the facilities will not only prevent overdose deaths but can actually stem the problem of public drug use that often leaves a trail of used syringes on the street and in parks.\", \"An official with a network of homeless shelters in the Bronx, which is home to some of the neighborhoods with the highest overdose rates in the city, said that safe injection sites could also help to reduce street homelessness.\", \"\\u201cFor a lot of our street-homeless clients, the reason they\\u2019re out there is because they have serious addiction,\\u201d said Scott Auwarter, assistant executive director of Bronxworks. \\u201cFor them to be in a facility, to be able to use safely, gives us a chance to engage them and maybe convince some of them to take a low-threshold bed someplace.\\u201d\", \"Supporters of the injection sites have been gearing up for this moment. On Nov. 7, there was a celebration at the East 126th Street site in anticipation of the announcement.\", \"Dr. Chinazo O. Cunningham, a deputy commissioner in the city health department who has since been named commissioner of the State Office of Addiction Services and Supports, popped a bottle of Veuve Clicquot. \\u201cIt\\u2019s really an amazing moment,\\u201d she said in a speech captured on a video that was provided to The New York Times. \\u201cTo bring evidence-based lifesaving treatment and initiatives to people who deserve it, finally to do that with love and respect and with dignity, I really am incredibly proud to be here at this moment.\\u201d\", \"Though the celebration may have seemed premature, the East 126th Street needle exchange has already been operating as an unofficial injection spot for months, at least, according to two former heroin users who said they shot up there several times in the spring. (Mr. Rivera confirmed that \\u201cunsanctioned\\u201d use has occurred.)\", \"Inside the space, there are bathrooms set aside for drug users, equipped with a chair, a desk and a diaper-changing table, said the couple, who asked to be identified only by their first names and last initials, Jonathan D. and Kira D., so as not to jeopardize Jonathan\\u2019s job.\", \"\\u201cIf you\\u2019re in the bathroom longer than 15 minutes, they knock on the door and ask if you\\u2019re OK,\\u201d said Kira, 26. \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t answer, they come in.\\u201d\", \"After injecting, users are encouraged to come out to a waiting room lined with chairs \\u2014 \\u201ckind of like the D.M.V.,\\u201d said Jonathan, 36 \\u2014 where workers in medical scrubs stand by ready to treat overdoses.\", \"\\u201cPeople that are nodding out too hard, they go over and make sure you\\u2019re nodding out and not falling out,\\u201d Jonathan said.\", \"Jonathan, who is now on methadone, was delighted to hear that the city would finally allow the site to operate openly.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s about time,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"9d888a3551c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9d888a3551c711ecb53695cef2c5bb35"}},
