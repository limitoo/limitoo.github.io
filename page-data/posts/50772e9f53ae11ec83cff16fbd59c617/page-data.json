Clegg III’s “The Black President” looks at the often surprising reactions of African Americans to the Obama administration.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-02T20:28:38.000Z","content":"[\"\", \"THE BLACK PRESIDENT\", \"Hope and Fury in the Age of ObamaBy Claude A. Clegg III\", \"The election of the 44th president of the United States was not only a nationally historic event but, for Black Americans, a transformative moment. It marked the transition to a wholly new conception of themselves as citizens of America, one that shattered the centuries of ingrained pessimism concerning what was ultimately possible in the country to which they have been forced to give so much, and from which they had learned to receive so little. The president himself foretold this as his greatest achievement. When his wife warily asked him, upon his announcement that he would run for the presidency, \\u201cWhy do you need to be president?\\u201d he gave as his primary reason that on the day he became president \\u201ckids all around this country \\u2014 Black kids, Hispanic kids, kids who don\\u2019t fit in \\u2014 they\\u2019ll see themselves differently, too, their horizons lifted, their possibilities expanded. And that alone \\u2026 that would be worth it.\\u201d His answer was prophetic.\", \"Claude A. Clegg III\\u2019s \\u201cThe Black President: Hope and Fury in the Age of Obama\\u201d explores at length \\u201cthe impact and meaning for African Americans\\u201d of Obama\\u2019s presidency. And while he discovers that the Black American response was \\u201ccomplex, layered and fractured,\\u201d as one would expect from a population of nearly 47 million people, the main conclusion of his comprehensive, interpretive study is the steadfast commitment of Black voters to the president, despite the disappointments expressed by many Black leaders with the degree to which his policies changed the actual condition of African Americans.\", \"Beyond the fact that the presence of a Black couple in the White House transcended all for Black Americans, four factors stood out in complicating Obama\\u2019s relation to many influential Black leaders: his political pragmatism; his moderation on race and reluctance to publicly engage with it; his steadfast commitment to the view that a universalist, race-neutral approach to policy, rather than one that targeted Blacks for special attention, worked best for the nation and for Black people themselves (best exemplified in his historic health program); and his view that while every effort had to be made by government to correct the persistent wrongs of racism, Black Americans had a personal responsibility to change those self-immiserating patterns of behavior that inhibited their progress, like the high rate of father absence. These positions were sources of teeth-gritting irritation to many Black leaders, at least one of whom, Jesse Jackson (himself an absent father), was overheard wishing for Obama\\u2019s emasculation.\", \"The first part of the book examines Obama\\u2019s background and early development, and his political career from the Illinois legislature up to his victorious presidential campaign. This is the most challenging period of Obama\\u2019s extraordinary career for any biographer. Like some figure from mythology, Obama burst upon America from a strange and wondrous background of vastly different souls and places \\u2014 Hawaii, Indonesia, Seattle, Kansas \\u2014 the son of two \\u201cwanderers and dreamers,\\u201d an adventurous white mother from the American heartland, a roving Black father from the east of Africa, who soon disappeared. How from these unlikely comminglings emerged the luminous figure channeling his \\u201cfierce ambition\\u201d and preternatural social and rhetorical skills into the young candidate who captivated a racially fraught nation is a mystery that many have already tried to unravel. Clegg, the Lyle V. Jones professor of history and African American studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, effectively assesses and summarizes available accounts with some new materials of his own.\", \"Part 2 explores Obama\\u2019s first term, from the early legislative successes to Republican intransigence and the Tea Party reaction. It examines his complex, strained relationship with the Congressional Black Caucus and growing criticism from Black critics, his \\u201chigh wire\\u201d performances as signifier in chief in matters of race, his relations with Africa and the essential role of Michelle Obama, the Black \\u201cRenaissance woman,\\u201d in maintaining his popularity with African American voters. It concludes with an account of the second election.\", \"The title of Part 3 is taken from Obama\\u2019s own description of his second term, \\u201cthe best of times, the worst of times,\\u201d in which Obama\\u2019s \\u201cracial funambulism\\u201d was on full display, especially in response to the growing complaints from Black leaders about his failure to sufficiently address the problems of Black incarceration and police violence, the relatively small number of Blacks in his government and his \\u201cuncommon lapse of empathy\\u201d in refusing to exercise his clemency powers until the last quarter of his presidency; his 5.3 percent rate of approving requests was among the lowest of all presidents. Although the pace is sometimes too leisurely and the interpretation might have been, in areas, more probing, the book overall is a gracefully written, scrupulously balanced and quite satisfying account of what Obama meant for Black Americans.\", \"Clegg repeatedly claims that he brings the special \\u201ccontextual tools and scholarly perspectives\\u201d of the historian to bear on his subject, but when that subject is as recent and momentous as the Obama presidency, the dynamics of which are still being played out in America\\u2019s banefully corrosive politics, it is questionable what the historian, qua historian, brings. There is, in fact, a real danger of hindsight bias in attempting to explain too soon so unforeseen and contingently interlaced a series of events as Obama\\u2019s rise, presidency and impact. This Clegg largely avoids by hewing close to the outer layers and signals of his subject. The Trump disaster, the recent near-death experience of America\\u2019s democracy, the election of the first Black and female vice president, and even the victory of a septuagenarian on his third try at the presidency, were all made possible by, and are all part and parcel of, the Obama era.\", \"Obama is said to have been so shocked by the election of Donald Trump that he repeatedly wondered aloud whether he had been elected too early, that perhaps the nation had not yet been quite ready for a Black president. Clegg disagrees, correctly. The president\\u2019s lament was too conditioned by the proximate chaos of the present. For Clegg and other Black Americans, for all America, the age of Obama has yet to run its course. Just wait.\"]","href_hash":"50772e9f53ae11ec83cff16fbd59c617"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"50772e9f53ae11ec83cff16fbd59c617"}},
