The highly fractured left-hand side has been very unkind to us, with shear zones in about the worst possible places, bisecting both the top and bottom of the spillway.\\\"\", \"He said these geological issues were not known at the beginning of 2021 when they were under 50 metres of hill.\", \"The solutions engineered for this area and the need to import sand and rock for the embankment's safety-critical material had added significantly to the construction costs.\", \"Scott said there had been a tight focus on financial management and the company was doing all it could to minimise costs without compromising safety, reliability and sustainability.\", \"Waimea Water plans to transition from construction to operations later this year with the dam structures due to be completed by September, so the reservoir can be filled.\", \"However, Scott said that could be further delayed due to Covid-19 site restrictions, resource and material constraints in the construction sector and further delays in the delivery of internationally-sourced components.\"]","href_hash":"9d8b4042951711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9d8b4042951711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
