And the story is a reminder of Bob Dole\\u2019s Washington.\", \"Mr. Dole, a Kansas Republican who overcame the poverty of the Great Depression and grievous injuries sustained during World War II, brought his prairie values and no-nonsense manner when he arrived in Washington in 1961. Over the next 35 years \\u2014 through eight years in the House, 27 in the Senate and three failed attempts to win the presidency \\u2014 he operated in a city that was conducive to his instincts as a deal maker.\", \"It is perhaps trite to reminisce about and romanticize a \\u201cbygone era\\u201d in Washington, when politicians of opposing parties fought by day and socialized with one another at night. There was plenty of partisanship \\u2014 some of it every bit as bitter as what exists today \\u2014 during Mr. Dole\\u2019s time in the Capitol.\", \"But there also is no denying that the climate was different, and the facts speak for themselves: Both as a senator and as the Republican leader, a job he held from 1985 until 1996, Mr. Dole reached across the aisle to help push through a string of bipartisan legislation, such as a bill to rescue Social Security, the Americans With Disabilities Act and a measure to overhaul the welfare system.\", \"Among his proudest accomplishments was teaming up with George McGovern, the liberal Democrat from South Dakota, to completely revamp the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly called food stamps. They continued to work together on nutrition issues after they both left the Senate.\", \"\\u201cPeople believed in working with each other, and they kept their word,\\u201d Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who counted Mr. Dole as a friend, said in an interview on Sunday. He recalled the close ties between George J. Mitchell Jr., the Maine senator who preceded Mr. Daschle as the Democratic leader, and Mr. Dole.\", \"\\u201cWhen George Mitchell was leader, he\\u2019d go down to Dole\\u2019s office two and three times a day and vice versa,\\u201d Mr. Leahy said. \\u201cAnd I recall they both said the same thing about the other: \\u2018He never surprised me.\\u2019 You don\\u2019t see that happen today.\\u201d\", \"Not only that, Mr. Mitchell and Mr. Dole had dedicated phone lines on their desks that let them communicate directly with the touch of a button, one aide recalled.\", \"The button came in handy in November 1994, when Republicans won back the majority. Mr. Mitchell, who had not sought re-election, asked that Mr. Dole be alerted that he was coming to his office to congratulate him. Mr. Dole sent a quick message back that he didn\\u2019t want Mr. Mitchell to make the humbling trek and that Mr. Dole would instead go to his office, a gesture that Mr. Mitchell and his team regarded as decent and thoughtful.\", \"\\u201cHe operated in a different era, when the idea of bipartisanship was very much in vogue and politicians understood that in a democracy you simply have to work, not just with your fellow party members, but with people from the opposite side or the other side of the aisle,\\u201d said Robert Dallek, the presidential historian. \\u201cHe was masterful at that.\\u201d\", \"That is not to say that Mr. Dole lacked sharp elbows or conservative ideology. Newt Gingrich, the former Republican speaker of the House who is widely credited with ushering in Washington\\u2019s era of partisan warfare, said he worked closely with Mr. Dole to push through tax cuts and to defeat President Bill Clinton\\u2019s plan for universal health care.\", \"In an interview on Sunday, Mr. Gingrich likened Mr. Dole to the current Republican leader, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, an object of loathing for Democrats.\", \"\\u201cI think there\\u2019s a lot of parallels between Dole and McConnell,\\u201d Mr. Gingrich said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re both creatures of the Senate; they\\u2019re both very, very good tactically. They both understand how to stop things, and they understand how to get things done.\\u201d\", \"Despite their partnership, Mr. Dole could not embrace Mr. Gingrich\\u2019s bomb-throwing style. When Mr. Gingrich and House Republicans refused to pass federal spending bills, forcing the government to shut down in 1995, Mr. Dole took to the Senate floor to declare that he had had enough.\", \"\\u201cWe ought to end this,\\u201d Mr. Dole said at the time. \\u201cI mean, it\\u2019s gotten to the point where it\\u2019s a little ridiculous as far as this senator is concerned.\\u201d\", \"In Washington, Mr. Dole and his wife, Elizabeth Dole \\u2014 who later became a senator and ran for president herself \\u2014 were seen as a power couple, the embodiment of the city\\u2019s institutions. Mr. Dole came to stand for World War II and the Greatest Generation, and an earlier era of dignity and honor. He was the driving force behind the World War II Memorial on the National Mall, and could often be found greeting veterans there.\", \"\\u201cHe was in a sense Mr. America,\\u201d said Mr. Dallek, the historian. \\u201cHe came from the heartland, and he stood for a kind of shared values.\\u201d\", \"In 1996, Mr. Dole left the Senate \\u2014 an institution in which he had served for more than a quarter century \\u2014 to run for president. Washington was changing. Mr. Gingrich was at the height of his power. Mr. Clinton would later be impeached over his affair with an intern, Monica Lewinsky, exacerbating the growing partisan tensions.\", \"But when Mr. Dole, who at that point was the Senate\\u2019s longest-serving Republican leader, went to the chamber to deliver a speech announcing his departure, the old ways of the Capitol were still intact.\", \"\\u201cThat day he announced he was leaving the Senate, almost every Democratic senator was on the floor,\\u201d Mr. Leahy said. \\u201cNow, he was going to go out to run against Bill Clinton. And when he finished speaking, we all stood and applauded and applauded.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e8df0ad1563111ecbb3387a4438d397c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e8df0ad1563111ecbb3387a4438d397c"}},
