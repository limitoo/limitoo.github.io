The code collected not only people's names, but also taxpayers' filing status, approximate adjusted gross income, refund amount, the names of dependents and the amount of federal tax owed, among other items, the investigation found.\", \"Sharing such taxpayer information without their consent is a \\\"breach of taxpayer privacy by tax prep companies and by Big Tech firms that appeared to violate taxpayers' rights and may have violated taxpayer privacy law,\\\" the lawmakers added.\\u00a0\", \"The lawmakers, who also include Senators Ron Wyden, D.-Oregon; Richard Blumenthal, D.-Connecticut; Tammy Duckworth, D-Illinois; Sheldon Whitehouse, D.-Rhode Island; and Representative Katie Porter, D.-California, asked the federal agencies to \\\"fully investigate this matter and prosecute any company or individuals who violated the law.\\\"\", \"In an email to CBS MoneyWatch, H&R Block said it \\\"takes protecting our clients' privacy very seriously, and we have taken steps to prevent the sharing of information via pixels.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"Meta said its policies are clear that advertisers \\\"should not send sensitive information about people through our Business Tools,\\\" according to a company spokesman.

Our system is designed to filter out potentially sensitive data it is able to detect.\\\"\", \"Google, TaxAct and TaxSlayer didn't immediately respond to requests for comment.\", \"The investigation comes amid a push by the IRS to develop its own free electronic tax-filing system that could compete with tax-prep programs from the likes of Intuit's TurboTax and H&R Block. The IRS plans to roll out its pilot program in early 2024.\\u00a0\", \"Preparing and filing taxes is big business in the U.S., with Americans spending an average of $250 and 13 hours each filing their annual returns, the lawmakers noted.
