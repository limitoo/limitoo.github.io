Trump\\u2019s isolationist instincts and pro-Russian sentiment.\", \"Republican leaders, by and large, have struck an aggressive posture, encouraging Mr. Biden to get tougher on Russia, through immediate sanctions on Russian energy exports and more lethal aid to Ukraine\\u2019s military. But that message has been undermined by the party\\u2019s far right, which has questioned why the United States would side with Ukraine at all, and has obliquely suggested with no evidence that the president is bolstering his son Hunter Biden\\u2019s business interests.\", \"Driven by a steady diet of pro-Russian or anti-interventionist rhetoric from the Fox News host Tucker Carlson, the Republican right has become increasingly vocal in undercutting not only U.S. foreign policy but also the positions of Republican leaders.\", \"The Republican representatives Matt Rosendale of Montana, Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Paul Gosar of Arizona, Thomas Massie of Kentucky, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia; Donald Trump Jr.; and the Ohio Senate candidate J.D. Vance have weighed in to oppose confronting Russia or to suggest nefarious intentions on Mr. Biden\\u2019s part. Mr. Trump told the conservative podcast host Lou Dobbs that Mr. Biden\\u2019s reported plan to send as many as 50,000 troops to bolster Europe\\u2019s defenses was \\u201ccrazy.\\u201d\", \"Representative Mike Turner of Ohio, the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, went on Fox News to confront Mr. Carlson.\", \"\\u201cWhy would we take Ukraine\\u2019s side and not Russia\\u2019s side?\\u201d Mr. Carlson pushed. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a sincere question.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Turner responded: \\u201cUkraine is a democracy. Russia is an authoritarian regime that is seeking to impose its will upon a validly elected democracy in Ukraine, and we\\u2019re on the side of democracy.\\u201d\", \"Such confrontations have muddied the Republican response, but more concerning are worries that the right could prompt U.S. allies to question Washington\\u2019s resolve. On a conference call on Wednesday with Ukrainian Americans, Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, expressed alarm about \\u201cthe rhetoric of the far right.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cOur allies are watching closely for signs of division here,\\u201d he said in an interview after the call. \\u201cThe good news is, I detect no real traction of those messages from my Republican colleagues.\\u201d\", \"The bad news, he allowed, is that most Republicans are willing to disown it only in private.\", \"Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, said legislation to impose sanctions on Russia and bolster Ukraine\\u2019s military and economic position could be on the Senate floor as soon as next week, and he hopes it will counter any message of division.\", \"\\u201cThis is a moment for us to come together and pass a strong, bipartisan sanctions package to send an unmistakable signal of support for Ukraine, Ukraine\\u2019s independence and for President Biden\\u2019s leadership,\\u201d he said on Wednesday.\", \"Publicly, Republican leaders have been talking tough. After Mr. Biden\\u2019s gaffe last week, when he seemed to suggest that a \\u201cminor incursion\\u201d into Ukraine would not merit a forceful allied response, Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the No. 2 Republican, asked: \\u201cDo you think the strong, wonderful people of the Ukraine think it would be a minor incursion if Putin moved tanks into Ukraine, even a piece of the Ukraine? Of course they don\\u2019t.\\u201d\", \"This week, speaking to reporters in Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, indicated such criticism had pushed the administration to toughen its stance.\", \"\\u201cWhat I\\u2019ve been hearing since then is encouraging, that they\\u2019re prepared to take steps before an incursion, not afterwards,\\u201d he said, adding, \\u201cIt appears to me the administration is moving in the right direction.\\u201d\", \"But that direction \\u2014 and that message \\u2014 may not be what the most partisan Republican voters want. A Yahoo News/YouGov poll released this week found that 62 percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents view President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a stronger leader than Mr. Biden. But a survey released on Wednesday by the Pew Research Center found views of Russia\\u2019s military buildup near Ukraine did not differ much by partisan affiliation at all.\", \"Representative Tom Malinowski, Democrat of New Jersey, said on Wednesday that some callers into his district office had begun parroting Mr. Carlson\\u2019s assertions that the United States should be allied with Russia, not Ukraine, or that he should be supporting Russia\\u2019s \\u201creasonable\\u201d demands for NATO withdrawal from Eastern Europe.\", \"\\u201cMost Republicans in the House are totally solid; to the extent they want Biden to do more, that\\u2019s at least a healthy instinct,\\u201d Mr. Malinowski said on Wednesday in a phone interview from Brussels, where a bipartisan House delegation is visiting NATO after meetings in Ukraine. \\u201cI do think some of them are slightly in denial about this other force in their party.\\u201d\", \"For now, Mr. Malinowski said, the United States\\u2019 allies in Europe are united in their response to Russian aggression. Though they remain wary of American constancy after four years of Mr. Trump\\u2019s anti-NATO rhetoric, so far they trust that the Biden administration and Republican leadership will stand by the alliance if Russian forces invade Ukraine.\", \"But, he warned, Republican leaders should not be fooled into thinking their foreign policy views could survive a resurgence of Trumpism in the White House, either with a return of the former president or the election of one of his acolytes. He pointed to the memo drafted in the closing days of the Trump White House to justify the firing of Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper. Those reasons included his focus on Russia and \\u201cevery facet of competition\\u201d with Moscow, and his opposition to withdrawing U.S. troops from Germany.\", \"In some sense, the taunts, insults and isolationist sentiments coming from the Republicans\\u2019 far-right flank are consistent with the Trump era, when Mr. Trump stood beside Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, and said he trusted the Russian strongman over his own intelligence agencies.\", \"\\u201cDespite claims by war hawks on both sides of the aisle, it is not in our national interest to spill American blood and treasure in Ukraine,\\u201d Mr. Rosendale wrote in a statement.\", \"Mr. Gosar wrote: \\u201cWe have no dog in the Ukraine fight. Not one American soldier should die there. Not one American bullet should be fired there. We just lost Afghanistan to sandal wearing goat herders. I assure you Russian military is no joke either.\\u201d\", \"Others were simply insulting. Ms. Greene again called for Mr. Biden\\u2019s impeachment. Ms. Boebert brought up Burisma, the Ukrainian company that Hunter Biden did work for, leading to outlandish accusations of corruption from Republicans, which were later dispelled by a Senate Republican inquiry that found no evidence of improper influence or wrongdoing by the elder Mr. Biden.\", \"Just as significant, some said on Wednesday, is the silence from Republicans, who have refused to speak out against their fringe.\", \"Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, told Ukrainian Americans on Wednesday that a group of senators who just returned from Ukraine had been working for three days on a tough new bill that would impose broad sanctions on Russia.\", \"That legislation would be a vehicle to show \\u201cthere\\u2019s no daylight between Republicans and Democrats when it comes to the fundamental questions of whether we should provide significant economic and security support to Ukraine right now at unprecedented levels in order to make sure that Ukraine can defend itself,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd there is no daylight between Republicans and Democrats as to whether Putin should and will pay a devastating price if he were to launch an invasion.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"0607bec37f0411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0607bec37f0411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
