A trader at a major Russian bank told Reuters the market had partly reacted to a comment from Ryabkov, in reply to a question, that he would neither confirm nor rule out the possibility that Russia might deploy \\\"military infrastructure\\\" in Cuba and Venezuela.\", \"U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told MSNBC in an interview: \\\"The jury's out on which path Vladimir Putin is going to choose. Is he going to choose the path of diplomacy and dialogue to resolve some of these problems or is he going to pursue confrontation and aggression?\\\"\", \"Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba said: \\\"I believe that the only way for the Russians to confirm their lack of intention to solve problems by force is to continue the discussion in the established formats, in particular in the OSCE.\\\"\", \"Russia denies plans to invade Ukraine but its military build-up has forced the United States and its allies to the negotiating table.\", \"It says it is threatened by the fact that NATO has expanded towards its borders by taking in 14 new members from former communist eastern Europe since the Cold War ended. It wants to draw \\\"red lines\\\" to stop the alliance from admitting Ukraine as a member or basing missiles there.\", \"Washington has rejected those demands but said it is willing to talk about arms control, missile deployments and confidence-building measures to move on from one of the most fraught moments in East-West relations since the Cold War.\", \"Ambassador Lukashevich told the OSCE that unless Moscow received a constructive response, \\\"we will be forced to draw appropriate conclusions and take all necessary measures to ensure strategic balance and eliminate unacceptable threats to our national security.\\\"\", \"He went on: \\\"Russia is a peace-loving country. But we do not need peace at any cost. The need to obtain these legally formalised security guarantees for us is unconditional.\\\"\", \"NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said after talks with Russia on Wednesday that countries must be free to choose their own security arrangements.\", \"Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov criticised a sanctions bill unveiled by U.S. Senate Democrats on Wednesday that would target top Russian government and military officials, including Putin, as well as key banking institutions, if Russia attacks Ukraine.\", \"Peskov said sanctioning Putin would be tantamount to severing relations.\", \"\\\"We view the appearance of such documents and statements extremely negatively against the background of an ongoing series of negotiations, albeit unsuccessful ones,\\\" he said.\", \"Peskov was quoted by the TASS news agency as saying Putin was receiving regular updates on the talks and the Kremlin was clear about the outcomes, but was waiting for replies from the other side in writing.\", \"Carpenter told the OSCE meeting: \\\"As we prepare for an open dialogue on how to strengthen security for the benefit of all, we must decisively reject blackmail and never allow aggression and threats to be rewarded.\\\"\", \"Russia has said it will decide on its next moves after this week's talks and threatened unspecified \\\"military -technical measures\\\" if its demands are rejected.\", \"U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said on Wednesday that if Russia walked away, it would show it was never serious about diplomacy in the first place.\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"4c7aa366749511ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4c7aa366749511ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
