At the time, a family member found five bruises, approximately 4 inches long, on Sortwell's child while giving them a bath, Green Bay Police Department records showed according to The Green Bay Press-Gazette.\", \"The relative brought the child to the hospital. When police questioned Sortwell, he explained that the Bible was \\\"very specific\\\" about corporal punishment. He loosely cited a Bible verse from Proverbs: \\\"Whoever spares the rod hates their child,\\\" police said.\", \"Sortwell also told police that he and his wife inflicted corporal punishment by striking the child twice whenever they were \\\"being defiant.\\\" He said they used an object to strike their child rather than their hands because \\\"hands are for loving.\\\" He also denied that the child's marks were inflicted out of anger. He told police that hitting the child was a form of love for \\\"teaching what needs to be taught.\\\"\", \"After hitting his child, Sortwell wouldn't inspect the child for injuries, but they would hug the child and give them a Rice Krispies treat.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1924993/shae-sortwell-republican-child-abuse-christian.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Shae Sortwell, a Republican representative in the Wisconsin State Assembly, was investigated in a possible felony child abuse case in 2013 after a family member told police about bruises they found on his child's body.

It involved \\\"four police officers, two social workers, a child forensic officer \\u2014 a trained agent who interviews child victims of physical and sexual abuse \\u2014 a child advocacy staff member and a nurse practitioner,\\\" the Press-Gazette reported.\", \"Police suggested pursuing a felony charge of child abuse against Sortwell, as well as a felony charge against his wife for failure to act to prevent bodily harm. Both charges are punishable by up to six years in prison.\", \"However, Deputy District Attorney Dana J. Johnson chose not to pursue the charges. Johnson told police they weren't confident that they could prove Sortwell's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\", \"The investigation occurred before Sortwell was elected to the state Assembly. At the time, he was active in national politics and had served on the Green Bay City Council.

The policy requires masks for all unvaccinated visitors. Vaccinated visitors can go unmasked if they show their vaccination cards.\", \"\\\"The Gestapo wants to see your papers, please,\\\" Sortwell wrote above the image on his Facebook post.\", \"The Gestapo were the secret police force of the Nazis, German leaders in the 1930s and '40s who sent millions of Jews, LGBTQ people and social outcasts to death camps to be systematically tortured and killed.\", \"Museum director Cory Rusch said the museum received harassment from callers and emailers after Sortwell's post.
