But from May to August, the volcano produced its magnum opus, unleashing 320,000 Olympic-size swimming pools\\u2019 worth of molten rock from its eastern flank.\", \"Dr. Stovall, the deputy scientist-in-charge at the U.S. Geological Survey\\u2019s Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, recalls moments of being awe-struck by the eruption\\u2019s incandescence: lava fountains roaring like jet engines, painting the inky blue sky in crimson hues. But these briefly exhilarating moments were overwhelmed by sadness. The people of Hawaii would suffer hundreds of millions of dollars in economic damage. The lava bulldozed around 700 homes. Thousands of lives were upended. Even the headquarters of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory itself, sitting atop the volcano, was torn apart by earthquakes early in the crisis.\", \"Like many volcanologists who were there during the eruption, Dr. Stovall is still processing the trauma she witnessed. Sadness is not quite the right word to describe what she feels, she said: \\u201cMaybe it\\u2019s an emotion that I don\\u2019t even have a word for.\\u201d\", \"But not only trauma has resulted from the crisis: It has also produced something of a sea change in the way scientists and their emergency services partners are able to respond to volcanic emergencies.\", \"During Kilauea\\u2019s devastating outburst, responders found novel ways to deploy drones and used social media to help those in the lava\\u2019s path. They also achieved more ineffable insights into how to keep cool in the face of hot lava. And this pandemonium of pedagogical experiences will prove valuable in times to come. The United States is home to 161 active or potentially active volcanoes \\u2014 approximately 10 percent of the world\\u2019s total. When \\u2014 not if \\u2014 a Kilauean-esque outburst or something more explosive takes place near an American city, scientists and emergency responders will be better prepared than ever to confront and counter that volcanic conflagration.\", \"In volcano preparedness, knowing where the next socially disruptive eruption may take place is half the battle.\", \"Not all of America\\u2019s active volcanoes are equally hazardous. Many in Alaska are situated on extremely remote islands. The Yellowstone supervolcano may sound frightening, but this cauldron does not deserve to be a boogeyman. \\u201cThe odds of a supereruption happening are infinitesimally small,\\u201d said Emilie Hooft, a geophysicist at the University of Oregon.\", \"California is home to at least seven potentially active volcanoes. Although they are \\u201cmostly where the people aren\\u2019t, a lot of California\\u2019s infrastructure crosses these volcanic zones,\\u201d said Andy Calvert, the scientist-in-charge at the Geological Survey\\u2019s California Volcano Observatory. An eruption at any of them could destroy power lines, highways, waterways and natural gas pipelines.\", \"The volcanoes of the Pacific Northwest are not dissimilar to bombs lingering in the background of populous American ports, towns and cities. Some, like Mount St. Helens, are infamous for giant explosions and superheated, superfast exhalations of noxious gas and volcanic debris.\", \"Others, like Washington State\\u2019s Mount Rainier, are more insidious. The volcano is known for making concrete-like slurries called lahars, in which freshly erupted ash mixes with snow or rainwater and gushes downslope, consuming everything in its path. These lahars \\u201care a huge and real hazard,\\u201d Dr. Hooft said. Populous settlements within or at the terminus of the volcano\\u2019s many valleys, including parts of the Seattle-Tacoma metropolis, are built on ancient lahar deposits \\u2014 and as the geologist\\u2019s refrain goes, the past is the key to the present.\", \"Another major concern is America\\u2019s poorly understood volcanic fields: sprawling collections of cones, craters and fissures nestled between countless towns stretching from California to Washington State. Except for Mount St. Helens, said Dr. Stovall, \\u201cit is statistically more likely that an eruption will occur from any one of these volcanic fields than from one of the charismatic stratocones of the Cascades.\\u201d\", \"While constantly watching Kilauea, the eyes of the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory also remain fixed on Mauna Loa, Kilauea\\u2019s colossal neighbor.\", \"It has not erupted since 1984 \\u2014 a disquietingly long pause. But in recent years, Mauna Loa has been grumbling. Several of this titan\\u2019s lava flows have come agonizingly close to obliterating the city of Hilo in the past century, and although they have serendipitously stopped short, they may one day succeed.\", \"When Ken Hon, the scientist-in-charge at the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory, was asked if a future Mauna Loa eruption concerned him, he replied with a question of his own.\", \"\\u201cAre you wary of a tiger when it\\u2019s sleeping?\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a sleeping tiger in your yard, and there\\u2019s no cage, and you\\u2019re just kind of watching it.\\u201d\", \"Fortunately, the lessons learned from the 2018 eruption have strengthened the armor of America\\u2019s volcanic vanguard.\", \"Kilauea took not just the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory but the entire U.S. Geological Survey to school. During the 2018 crisis, staff from the Alaska, California, Cascades and Yellowstone observatories headed to Hawaii to assist, like white blood cells from throughout the body rushing to the site of a pathogen\\u2019s incursion. Despite some parts of America not seeing an eruption for over a century, this across-the-spectrum response allowed scientists from the Geological Survey to \\u201ckeep the tools sharp,\\u201d Dr. Calvert said.\", \"Hawaii\\u2019s lava factories are now better understood. They may sometimes be the deliverers of destructive horrors, but \\u201cvolcanic eruptions are this amazing opportunity for scientists to do basic research,\\u201d said Ken Rubin, a volcanologist at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. The eruption in 2018, revealed that \\u201cthere\\u2019s a lot of ways this volcano can operate,\\u201d he said.\", \"Some key observations made during the 2018 crisis are likely to apply to countless other volcanoes, including those enigmatic volcanic fields on the West Coast. For instance, Kilauea stopped erupting despite retaining most of its magma. A change in the rhythm of its seismic soundtrack also revealed changes in the magma\\u2019s gloopiness, a key factor in an eruption\\u2019s explosive capacity. Monitoring such changes may help forecast how future eruptions will evolve, and how long they will continue once they start.\", \"Kilauea\\u2019s outburst also changed the way scientists communicate with the public.\", \"\\u201cIt was the first big eruption we\\u2019ve had in the social media age,\\u201d said Tina Neal, director of the Geological Survey\\u2019s Volcano Science Center. During the eruption, her colleagues provided a constant stream of updates on Facebook and Twitter, debunking misconceptions and rumors. This proved to be one of the most effective ways of providing lifesaving advice to those fleeing the eruption.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ll admit that I was skeptical of spending too much time delivering information via social media,\\u201d said Ms. Neal, who was the Hawaiian Volcano Observatory\\u2019s scientist-in-charge during the 2018 eruption. She was concerned that in doing so she would mainly be catering to curious but unaffected parties further afield.\", \"But she said she was happy to be proved wrong \\u2014 and added that she thinks the Geological Survey\\u2019s volcanologists now have an effective social media operation that can spring into action whenever a volcano starts twitching.\", \"The 2018 crisis also kick-started a nationwide technological revolution. It had long seemed strange to Angie Diefenbach, a geologist at the Cascades Volcano Observatory, that management did not appear to see the value of using drones to study erupting volcanoes in the United States, particularly as academics both inside and outside the country had been doing just that for several years.\", \"Kilauea\\u2019s dramatic eruption was a paradigm-shifting moment. Ms. Diefenbach, who was already equipped with a pilot\\u2019s license, was sent to the effervescing volcano with a handful of keen colleagues and a small fleet of flying robots.\", \"The pilots had a steep learning curve. The drones frequently flitted over the incandescent fury emerging from fissure eight, one of the two dozen cracks in the volcano\\u2019s flank, to film the seemingly endless flow of lava and sniff the chasm\\u2019s noxious gases.\", \"\\u201cThat fissure eight plume was intense, and the river of lava was extremely hot,\\u201d Ms. Diefenbach said. Every now and then, an upswell of heat would knock the levitating robots skyward by a couple hundred feet, threatening a loss of control that might plunge them into molten rock. Fortunately, they all survived to fly another day.\", \"Immediately, she said, the powers that be recognized that drones \\u201creally add a fundamental piece to the story\\u201d for volcano monitoring. Bird\\u2019s-eye views of lava flows allowed scientists to study the evolution of the eruption in real time. And communities in the path of the lava could be given advance warning; at one point, a man trapped in his home at night and surrounded by lava was led by a drone through the maze of molten rock to safety.\", \"Ms. Diefenbach, who works with uncrewed aircraft systems like drones for the Volcano Science Center, is now training more drone pilots across all five volcano observatories. While awaiting the next socially disruptive eruption, some of her drones are being used to study volcanoes that could one day reawaken, including inaccessible snowcapped peaks in Alaska.\", \"This is not to say that the scientists of the U.S. Geological Survey have been \\u201ctwiddling their thumbs waiting\\u201d for a ruinous eruption like Kilauea, Ms. Neal said.\", \"The agency\\u2019s staff are working constantly with their academic partners to improve their understanding of America\\u2019s fiery mountains. They are also continually learning from the way other countries respond to their own volcanic crises. The scientists regularly team up with emergency managers to conduct drills, including the annual evacuation exercises near Mount Rainier.\", \"But the path to volcanic enlightenment is not a straight line. Although all of America\\u2019s active volcanoes are monitored, some considered to be high risk are not adorned with sufficient sensors. This can be a result of budgetary constraints, the difficulty of instrumenting treacherous volcanoes and, in some cases, red tape preventing the placement of sensors in wilderness areas.\", \"\\u201cThere are some volcanoes where we\\u2019re more at the starting line,\\u201d said Seth Moran, a seismologist at the Cascades Volcano Observatory, citing Washington\\u2019s Glacier Peak and Mount Baker.\", \"Climate change and California\\u2019s increasingly intense wildfires are also aggravating the situation. A newly installed ground deformation sensor on Mount Shasta, for example, was taken out by this summer\\u2019s furious Lava fire, Dr. Calvert said.\", \"Despite these setbacks, the Geological Survey continues to strengthen its monitoring efforts, with its network of instruments on several particularly hazardous volcanoes being upgraded and expanded. It also participates in tabletop exercises to test everyone\\u2019s mettle. One that took place over several days last November pitted scientists against a hypothetical eruption of Oregon\\u2019s Mount Hood.\", \"Like the Kilauean eruption, this virtual volcanic gauntlet served up an underappreciated reminder: The people responding to volcanic crises may have extraordinary skill sets, but they are not superhuman.\", \"\\u201cThe general feeling afterwards was just of overwhelming exhaustion,\\u201d said Diana Roman, a geophysicist at the Carnegie Institution for Science and one of those who ran the exercise. \\u201cAnd that was part of the point.\\u201d\", \"When it comes to America\\u2019s readiness for the next eruption, preparing scientists psychologically for the reality of a prolonged volcanic crisis is a necessity.\", \"In 2004, when Mount St. Helens began to cough and splutter in a concerning manner, Dr. Moran became wrapped up in a surfeit of tasks. \\u201cIt was about week three when my wife brought our kids to say good night to me,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat was my indication that I was probably doing too much. I should at least be able to get home and say good night to my kids.\\u201d\", \"These experiences have taught Dr. Moran and his colleagues an invaluable lesson: \\u201cYou can\\u2019t have people getting burned out right off the bat,\\u201d he said. Giving individuals clear roles ahead of time, and making their teams small and manageable, will hopefully prevent this sort of exhaustion in the future.\", \"Though it\\u2019s not only scientists who can get drained during lengthy volcanic eruptions. As the weariness over the pandemic is grimly demonstrating, \\u201cit\\u2019s hard to keep people\\u2019s attention on something for a long time,\\u201d said Brian Terbush, the program coordinator for earthquakes and volcanoes at Washington State\\u2019s Emergency Management Division. \\u201cThey get really tired of it. I\\u2019m tired of it.\\u201d\", \"And protecting the public is considerably more difficult if people are not paying attention.\", \"The location, timing and effects of America\\u2019s next volcanic disaster remain unknown. Even after a significant eruption begins, forecasting its evolution will be difficult.\", \"\\u201cEven on the world\\u2019s best instrumented volcano,\\u201d said Dr. Hon, referring to Kilauea, \\u201cwe still don\\u2019t really understand it that well.\\u201d\", \"And yet, despite having so many dangers and complications to contend with, no one died and thousands of lives were saved during the 2018 crisis.\", \"Those who were involved in the Kilauea response hope that the public will remember the role geoscientists played during the next volcanic emergency and see them as trustworthy protectors.\", \"Not everyone will. \\u201cWe often get told that we\\u2019re lying, and we\\u2019re hiding things, because we\\u2019re the government,\\u201d said Dr. Stovall \\u2014 an uncomfortable echo of the similarly unfounded charges of conspiracy that many have directed toward public health professionals during the pandemic.\", \"But the volcanologists and their peers say they will remain unwavering in their mission to decipher the country\\u2019s beguiling but occasionally menacing volcanoes.\", \"\\u201cWe are doing our best,\\u201d Dr. Stovall said. \\u201cAnd we\\u2019re in it for the greater good.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"59e79ab6413911ec8990a915c4c52602"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"59e79ab6413911ec8990a915c4c52602"}},
