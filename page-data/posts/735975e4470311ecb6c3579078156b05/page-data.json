Prosecutors called Dr. Edmund Donoghue, who examined Arbery's body on February 24, 2020 \\u2014 the day after he was slain \\u2014 as a witness.\", \"Donoghue testified that Arbery was hit by two of the three shotgun blasts fired at him. He said both gunshots caused severe bleeding that could have killed the 25-year-old.\", \"The first shot at close range tore through an artery in Arbery's right wrist and punched a gaping hole in the center of his chest, Donoghue said. The second shot missed entirely, while the third shot fired at point-blank range ripped through a major artery and vein near his left armpit and fractured bones in his shoulder and upper arm.\", \"\\\"Is there anything law enforcement or EMS could have done to save his life at the scene?\\\" prosecutor Linda Dunikoski asked the medical examiner.\", \"\\\"I don't think so. No,\\\" Donoghue replied.\", \"The jury saw close-up photos of his injuries, which included several large abrasions to Arbery's face from when he fell facedown in the street following the third gunshot. Photos of his clothing showed his T-shirt stained entirely red. Cellphone video of the shooting shows it had been white.\", \"Father and son Greg and Travis McMichael armed themselves and pursued the 25-year-old in a pickup truck after spotting him running in their neighborhood on February 23, 2020. Their neighbor William \\\"Roddie\\\" Bryan joined the chase and took cellphone video of Travis McMichael shooting Arbery.\", \"Defense attorneys say the men had a right to make a citizens arrest of someone they suspected of stealing from the neighborhood, and that the younger McMichael fired the gun in self-defense after Arbery tried to take it from him.\", \"Tuesday testimony followed the judge's refusal to declare a mistrial over defense claims that jurors were tainted when Arbery's mother wept over evidence photos, calling attention to the presence of the Reverend Jesse Jackson, who was sitting beside her in the courtroom's public gallery.\", \"Defense attorney Kevin Gough on Monday asked the judge to make the civil rights leader leave to avoid unfairly influencing the jury, all but one of whom are white.\\u00a0\", \"Rejecting the defense's complaints about Black pastors at the trial as \\\"reprehensible,\\\" Superior Court Judge Timothy Walmsley said no group would be excluded from his courtroom.\", \"Jackson acknowledged Monday that Arbery's mother wept \\\"very quietly\\\" in the courtroom after prosecutors showed a photo of her son to a witness.\", \"\\\"As the judge said, it was my constitutional right to be there,\\\" Jackson said later outside the courthouse. \\\"It's my moral obligation to be there.\\\"\", \"The Reverend Al Sharpton sat last week with the victim's parents, Wanda Cooper-Jones and Marcus Arbery Sr., inside the Glynn County courtroom. He pledged to return to the courthouse, and activists said 100 Black pastors will join him.\", \"Sharpton has criticized the\\u00a0disproportionately white makeup of the jury.\\u00a0He said last week his attendance was \\\"not disruptive in any way\\\" and was \\\"at the invitation of the family.\\\"\", \"Cooper-Jones was emotional Monday during testimony from the state's 18th witness, Georgia Bureau of Investigations special agent Lawrence Kelly. According to the courtroom pool reporter, she bowed her head and held Reverend Jackson's hand when prosecutors and Kelly reviewed frame-by-frame cell phone footage of the shooting. She also closed her eyes when high-contrast versions of the footage at slowed and regular speeds were admitted into evidence.\", \"Bryan and the McMichaels are charged with murder and other crimes. Prosecutors say they chased Arbery for five minutes to keep him from exiting the Satilla Shores subdivision outside the port city of Brunswick. The chase ended when Arbery, trailed by Bryan's truck, tried to run around the McMichaels' truck as it idled in the road ahead. The video shows Travis McMichael confronting Arbery and then shooting him as he throws punches and grapples for the gun.\", \"The McMichaels told police they suspected Arbery was a burglar after security cameras recorded him several times inside a home under construction, five houses away.\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"735975e4470311ecb6c3579078156b05"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"735975e4470311ecb6c3579078156b05"}},
