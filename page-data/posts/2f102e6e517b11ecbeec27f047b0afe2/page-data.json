There will be no new restrictions on travel between regions under the new traffic light system.\", \"\\\"Other than the existing Auckland boundary, which lifts on January 17, there will be no new restrictions on travel between regions.\\\"\", \"The Auckland boundary will still open on 15 December to those who are fully vaccinated or have received a negative Covid-19 test within 72 hours of their departure.\", \"On 17 January, it is expected that those measures at Auckland's border may be eased.\", \"She said the vaccine passes would allow vaccinated New Zealanders to do many of the things previously treated as high risk, regardless of which colour setting each area was in.\", \"\\\"Like safely going to bars and restaurants, getting a haircut, and going to a concert or the gym. In Auckland, it means seeing friends and family indoors again,\\\" she said.\", \"For Auckland, she said: \\\"You can now see family and friends again in their homes, and use the bathroom inside. Luxury. If you are unvaccinated you can gather with others but the gathering limits are lower across each of the levels.\\\"\", \"She said life for the unvaccinated would be more restricted. \\\"That is the best way that we can ensure that the unvaccinated are protected too.\\\"\", \"Factors considered in determining the regions' settings include vaccination rates, the state of the health system, testing, contact tracing and case management capacity, as well as the rate and effect of Covid-19 transmission, she said.\", \"She said at every colour setting, there were three key things to remember - having your vaccine pass with you, wearing a mask, and scanning in wherever you go.\", \"\\\"At orange, the big change here for parts of the country which will enter into this setting is that for the vaccinated and where vaccine passes are used, there are no gathering limits.\", \"\\\"People can gather again safely. At red, it will feel a lot like level 2. Your vaccine pass lets you go everywhere but number limits of 100 will apply to most activities.\\\"\", \"She said the policing of the vaccine passes would be about \\\"supporting compliance at venues, ensure that they're able to operate the vaccine pass safely.
