Maxwell, 60, was convicted on December 29, 2021, of sex trafficking and other crimes.\", \"Andrew's lawyers have called the lawsuit \\\"baseless\\\" and accused Giuffre of seeking a payday. They argued that Giuffre signed away her right to sue the prince in a 2009 settlement with Epstein, and on January 4 urged US District Judge Lewis Kaplan to dismiss the lawsuit for that reason.\", \"Andrew, 61, told the BBC in November 2019 that he could not have had sex with Giuffre at Maxwell's home because he had returned to his house that night after a children's party.\", \"Kaplan said it was too soon to decide whether Giuffre and Epstein - a convicted sex offender - intended for the 2009 settlement to release Andrew.\", \"He also said it was premature to consider the prince's efforts to cast doubt on Giuffre's claims, though he would be able to do so at a trial.\", \"The allegations have done significant damage to the prince's reputation. On Thursday, Buckingham Palace said Andrew would no longer be known as 'His Royal Highness' after losing his royal and military links, and said he was defending the Giuffre case as a private citizen.\", \"Andrew had already stepped down from public duties days after a November 2019 interview with the BBC in which critics said he failed to address key questions about his ties to Epstein.\", \"If the case goes to trial and Giuffre wins, Andrew could be ordered to pay Giuffre damages. She has asked for an unspecified amount.\", \"No. Andrew has not been charged criminally, and no criminal charges could result from Giuffre's lawsuit since it is a civil case.\", \"Andrew repeatedly declined requests by federal prosecutors in the United States for an interview about their probe into Epstein's sex trafficking, former US Attorney for the Southern District of New York Geoffrey Berman said in June 2020.\", \"A spokesman for the US Attorney's office declined to comment. It was not clear if prosecutors still want to talk to Andrew.\", \"The settlement agreement said \\\"any other person or entity who could have been included as a potential defendant from all, and all manner of, action and actions of Virginia Roberts\\\" was released from liability.\", \"David Boies, a lawyer for Giuffre, earlier this month called the liability release in the 2009 settlement \\\"irrelevant\\\" to the case against Andrew.\", \"The litigation is at an early stage. Kaplan has said a potential trial could start between September and December 2022.\", \"No. Giuffre did not testify in Maxwell's criminal trial, and her allegations did not form the basis of any of the six sex abuse counts against her.\", \"Diplomats are often entitled to a certain degree of legal immunity in the countries in which they are posted. Heads of state - such as Andrew's mother, Queen Elizabeth II - are entitled to a degree of immunity as well.\", \"Even before the removal on Thursday of his royal patronages and military links, Andrew did not appear to fit either category, according to Craig Barker, a law professor at London South Bank University.\", \"\\\"There's nothing I can see in the law that would suggest that he would have any entitlement to immunity whatsoever, whether that be in civil or indeed in criminal matters,\\\" Barker said.\", \"Reuters\"]","href_hash":"cd150d8675ad11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"cd150d8675ad11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
