The cases, which are all from one household, were cause for concern because officials don't have a clear lead on an index case linking them to the border. They had also recently travelled to Auckland for a wedding.\\u00a0\", \"As a result, the country moved into the highest traffic light setting at 11:59pm on Sunday.\\u00a0\", \"While Kiwis were generally supportive of the move, former Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan was not.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Given over 90% of New Zealand's eligible population has had at least 2 doses of covid vaccine, and Omicron is indisputably a significantly less severe strain of the virus, I'm not sure why Jacinda Ardern is implementing draconian new restrictions & cancelling her wedding?\\\" he tweeted.\", \"During yesterday's stand up, Ardern said she had postponed her wedding in light of the new restrictions.\\u00a0\", \"Under the red light setting events such as weddings can go ahead with a gathering limit of 100 people if vaccine passes are required and a limit of 25 if they aren't.\\u00a0\", \"The Prime Minister was planning to marry her fiance Clarke Gayford in Gisborne over the summer.\\u00a0\", \"Morgan has previously commended Ardern for her leadership during the COVID-19 pandemic.\\u00a0\", \"In 2020, after New Zealand managed to contain the virus and lift all restrictions, the broadcaster said he \\\"wished\\\" the UK had a leader like her.\\u00a0\", \"The red setting still allows relative freedom for vaccinated people with services such as stores, cafes, restaurants, hairdressers, schools and workplaces allowed to stay open with some COVID-19 measures. Vaccine passes are used to access many services in red along with the use of face masks.\\u00a0\", \"The move comes as COVID-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins warns there could be tens of thousands of cases of the variant a day soon.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"It certainly could be into the tens of thousands reasonably quickly, so within weeks,\\\" Hipkins told Newstalk ZB on Monday\\u00a0\", \"\\\"That is certainly [possible], if you look around the world that's certainly what's happened for a lot of places.\\\"\", \"Although determining the trajectory of the outbreak is currently based on \\\"crystal ball gazing\\\", Omicron is not going to play out in the same way as earlier variants, he said.\", \"\\\"We do know that Omicron is a far more transmissible variant, so highly infectious, so therefore for every person who gets it, there will be a lot more extra people that get it - rather than with previous variants where we were aiming to keep that replication value down below 1 - we're not going to be able to do that with Omicron.\", \"\\\"We expect that in those early stages, it will start off small but it will grow quickly.\\\"\", \"However the outbreak is expected to be better than some other countries due to New Zealand's high vaccination rate. Ninety-five percent of Kiwis are fully vaccinated and 96 percent are partially inoculated. Nearly 1 million people, 974,784, have also received a booster shot.\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"fb3d0e787c8511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fb3d0e787c8511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
