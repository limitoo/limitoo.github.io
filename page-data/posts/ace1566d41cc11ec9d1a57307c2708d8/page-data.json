after the company involved pulled out.\", \"Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews announced the deal with SEA Electric ahead of the 2018 election.\", \"The deal was meant to create jobs in the region, which is home to Victoria's coal-fired power stations, after the Hazelwood plant closed in 2017.\", \"News of the project's demise comes amid a renewed focus on electric vehicles after the COP26\\u00a0climate summit in Glasgow\", \"Documents released to the ABC under Freedom of Information show the factory was meant to be built by December 2019.\", \"But amid questioning before Parliament's Public Accounts and Estimates Committee (PAEC) yesterday, the government revealed SEA Electric had advised it last month\\u00a0of its desire to end the agreement.\", \"The government has refused to say how much money had been paid to the company or whether any had been repaid, saying the matter was\\u00a0commercial in confidence.\\u00a0\", \"<img

discussions with Latrobe City Council about becoming the first tenant at its planned Gippsland Logistics Precinct in Morwell.\", \"Latrobe City mayor Sharon Gibson said the government needed to come up with an additional 500 jobs to replace those that had been lost.\", \"\\\"Not just the 500 jobs that were promised, but the extra jobs [from other businesses in the precinct],\\\" Cr Gibson said.\", \"Independent Morwell\\u00a0MP Russell Northe said the project enjoyed widespread community support and people would be disappointed that it would not go ahead.\", \"\\\"People feel let down and quite reasonably ask why the project was even announced if the government couldn't deliver it,\\\" Mr Northe said.\", \"<img

considering SEA Electric's application for funding, the Latrobe Valley's unemployment rate was 8.1 per cent, 2.9 percentage points higher than the state average.\", \"The project would have hired ex-Hazelwood power station workers as well as disadvantaged community members.\", \"A briefing paper prepared for then Industry and Employment Minister Ben Carroll, released under FOI, shows the Department of Jobs, Precincts and Region's Investment Committee classified the project as \\\"high risk\\\" before the grant was approved.\", \"The papers also show there was no guarantee the project would have created 500 jobs.\\u00a0\", \"Community groups and the opposition began questioning whether the project would eventuate when no site was secured.\", \"Earlier this year, SEA Electric chief executive Tony Fairweather said the government would need to modify the agreement for the factory to go ahead.\", \"He did not respond to a request for comment about the deal's collapse.\", \"<div

project.\", \"After The Nationals' Danny O'Brien began quizzing Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions officials about the status of the project, Ms Blandthorn directed him to stop.\", \"She said the project was not relevant to its inquiry into the 2020-21 budget.\", \"But Mr O'Brien told the hearing it was \\\"silly\\\"\\u00a0for PAEC to stop discussing the project when it had considered it at its previous four sittings.\", \"\\\"There were\\u00a0commitments made by the government for 500 jobs in the Latrobe Valley and they haven't come to fruition,\\\" he said.\", \"A government spokesperson said the support for the project was\\u00a0based on SEA Electric's \\\"promise to deliver jobs for the Latrobe Valley\\\".\", \"She said government had created 3,000 jobs in the
