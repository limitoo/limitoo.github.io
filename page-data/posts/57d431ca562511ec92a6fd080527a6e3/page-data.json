Under fire even from some fellow Republicans, Mr. Dole denied using the phrase \\u201cDemocrat wars,\\u201d then did damage control. His point, a spokesman said, had been that it was as unfair to blame Democrats for those wars as it was to blame President Gerald Ford \\u2014 who was at the top of the ticket Mr. Dole was running on \\u2014 for Watergate.\", \"The only thing that stood out about the episode was that Mr. Dole seemed to recognize he had taken his characteristic sarcasm too far.\", \"But he never stopped using it \\u2014 against Democrats, Republicans and often himself. After his death on Sunday at age 98, here is a sampling of his sharp tongue, including his jabs at supply-side economics and his venomous letter to a former White House official.\", \"In his first campaign for the presidency, in 1980, Mr. Dole joined the pile-on against President Jimmy Carter.\", \"\\u201cI once called Carter a chicken-fried McGovern,\\u201d Mr. Dole said, referring to the former Democratic nominee George McGovern. \\u201cAnd I take that back because I\\u2019ve come to respect McGovern.\\u201d\", \"Much like Mr. McGovern\\u2019s 1972 general election campaign, Mr. Dole\\u2019s 1980 primary campaign crashed and burned. He won just 607 votes in New Hampshire.\", \"The next day, he \\u201cslept like a baby,\\u201d Mr. Dole said afterward. \\u201cEvery two hours I woke up and cried.\\u201d\", \"If 1980 was a bad year for him, it was a great year for his party: Ronald Reagan won the presidency and Republicans retook the Senate. But Mr. Dole was less than happy with the particular Republicans who had done so, some of whom he felt had risen on an anti-Democratic wave rather than on their own merits.\", \"\\u201cIf we had known we were going to win control of the Senate,\\u201d he said, \\u201cwe\\u2019d have run better candidates.\\u201d\", \"In 1982, as members of the Senate Finance Committee worked late on a bill to eliminate billions in tax breaks, Mr. Dole declared that lobbyists and lawyers \\u201cmay be wearing Guccis tonight, but they\\u2019ll be barefoot by morning.\\u201d\", \"As the Democratic primary elections got underway in 1984, Mr. Dole commented on the failing presidential campaign of Senator Ernest F. Hollings with a jab whose relevance to his own campaign was surely not lost on him.\", \"\\u201cThe early campaign has shown that Fritz Hollings has the best sense of humor,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd with 1 percent of the vote, he\\u2019ll need it.\\u201d\", \"Four years later, Mr. Dole again ran unsuccessfully for the Republican nomination. Accused of lacking \\u201cvision,\\u201d he said: \\u201cWe thought of having a vision-of-the-month club just for the media. They\\u2019d say, \\u2018That\\u2019s the wrong vision,\\u2019 and I\\u2019d say, \\u2018That\\u2019s all right, I got another one.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Mr. Dole reached the apex of his career after Republicans seized control of Congress in 1994, making him the Senate majority leader. The victory was led by Representative Newt Gingrich, who would become speaker of the House. But Mr. Dole was not a fan.\", \"\\u201cYou hear Gingrich\\u2019s staff has these five file cabinets, four big ones and one little tiny one,\\u201d he told The New York Times Magazine in 1995. \\u201cNo. 1 is \\u2018Newt\\u2019s Ideas.\\u2019 No. 2, \\u2018Newt\\u2019s Ideas.\\u2019 No. 3, No. 4, \\u2018Newt\\u2019s Ideas.\\u2019 The little one is \\u2018Newt\\u2019s Good Ideas.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Later that year, during a government shutdown, Mr. Dole and Mr. Gingrich announced that they supported paying federal workers who were furloughed because of the shutdown.\", \"Wasn\\u2019t it absurd, a reporter asked, to pay workers to stay home rather than just have them work?\", \"Mr. Dole \\u2014 whose home state, Kansas, benefited from federal payments to farmers to leave some land fallow for environmental reasons \\u2014 replied, \\u201cIt\\u2019s like a farm program.\\u201d\", \"According to The Tampa Bay Times, Senator John McCain of Arizona liked to tell a story about a dinner Senate Republicans had with President Bill Clinton. Someone asked Mr. Clinton if he had read a murder mystery written by a Republican senator, and the president said yes, noting, \\u201cIt\\u2019s a Democratic senator who gets murdered.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cYeah,\\u201d Mr. Dole said. \\u201cIt has a happy ending.\\u201d\", \"In 1996, Mr. Dole ran for president once more.\", \"When one of his rivals for the Republican nomination, Pat Buchanan, accused him of distorting Mr. Buchanan\\u2019s record, The Orlando Sentinel reported, \\u201cDole mumbled that he was only reporting what he had read in Buchanan\\u2019s syndicated columns, and he just always assumed they were accurate.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Dole won the nomination. (He then lost to Mr. Clinton, 159 electoral votes to 379.) His running mate was Jack Kemp, a former football player who had spent 18 years in the House of Representatives, and whom Mr. Dole had previously mocked.\", \"\\u201cThere was a certain football player who forgot his helmet and then started talking supply-side theory,\\u201d Mr. Dole said in an undated remark recounted by The Tampa Bay Times.\", \"It was not the first time Mr. Dole had expressed disdain for supply-side economics, the Reaganite gospel that cutting taxes and decreasing regulations would strengthen the economy enough to recoup lost tax revenue.\", \"\\u201cA bus filled with supply-siders goes over the cliff, killing all aboard,\\u201d he once said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s the good news. The bad news is that there were three unoccupied seats.\\u201d\", \"Not that he supported raising taxes.\", \"\\u201cI remember one day on the floor, I said, \\u2018Now, gentlemen, let me tax your memories,\\u2019\\u201d he said in one of his presidential debates with Mr. Clinton, name-checking Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts. \\u201cAnd Kennedy jumped up and said, \\u2018Why haven\\u2019t we thought of that before?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Because he had given up his Senate seat to run for president, Mr. Dole had no job to return to after he lost.\", \"In a startling move, he agreed to star in a commercial for Viagra when it was introduced in 1998. He knew that talking about erectile dysfunction was \\u201ca little embarrassing,\\u201d he said in the ad, \\u201cbut it\\u2019s so important to millions of men and their partners.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Dole embraced the association, including on \\u201cThe Tonight Show With Jay Leno\\u201d in 2002. After Mr. Leno mentioned research showing that Viagra might cause blindness in rare cases, Mr. Dole emerged to roars of laughter from the audience.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s a lot of rubbish, Jay,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI hate to see this misinformation being spread. I know a little about Viagra, Bob Dole knows a little about Viagra, and my vision is perfect. It\\u2019s 20/20.\", \"\\u201cAnd,\\u201d he said, pointing to Mr. Leno\\u2019s band leader, \\u201cyou ought to know better, Jay Leno.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Dole was a repeat guest on late-night shows. He fired off several one-liners in an appearance on the \\u201cLate Show\\u201d with David Letterman in 1998, including musing on the length of his Senate career: 35 and a half years.\", \"Of course, he added, \\u201cSenator Thurmond\\u2019s been there \\u2014 well, let\\u2019s see, he came in with Chester Arthur.\\u201d\", \"When Mr. Letterman asked if he still visited the Senate, Mr. Dole replied, \\u201cI don\\u2019t go up very often, because I can\\u2019t vote anymore and the rest of them vote wrong.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Dole was not above criticizing the institution he spent 35 years in. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re hanging around with nothing to do and the zoo is closed, come over to the Senate,\\u201d he once said, according to former Senator Ben Nelson\\u2019s memoir. \\u201cYou\\u2019ll get the same kind of feeling and you won\\u2019t have to pay.\\u201d\", \"Like many members of the old guard of Republicans, Mr. Dole became increasingly critical of the party\\u2019s direction \\u2014 but still endorsed Donald J. Trump for president in 2016.\", \"The Republican National Committee should put up a sign \\u201cthat says \\u2018closed for repairs\\u2019 until New Year\\u2019s Day next year and spend that time going over ideas and positive agendas,\\u201d he told Fox News in 2013. Discussing who could be elected in today\\u2019s party, he added: \\u201cReagan wouldn\\u2019t have made it. Certainly Nixon couldn\\u2019t have made it, because he had ideas.\\u201d\", \"There was some irony to the criticism, because Mr. Dole had excoriated a former White House press secretary who wrote a critical book about the George W. Bush administration.\", \"\\u201cThere are miserable creatures like you in every administration who don\\u2019t have the guts to speak up or quit if there are disagreements with the boss or colleagues,\\u201d he wrote in a blistering 2008 letter to the former official, Scott McClellan, adding: \\u201cWhen the money starts rolling in you should donate it to a worthy cause, something like, \\u2018Biting the Hand That Fed Me.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"But Mr. Dole was nothing if not self-aware.\", \"\\u201cI was supposed to go for the jugular,\\u201d he once said, reflecting on his \\u201cDemocrat wars\\u201d comment in 1976. \\u201cAnd I did \\u2014 my own.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"57d431ca562511ec92a6fd080527a6e3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"57d431ca562511ec92a6fd080527a6e3"}},
