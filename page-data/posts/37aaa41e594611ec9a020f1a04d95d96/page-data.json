By leading with shared faith in each other, we become America at its best.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Dole, who died on Sunday at 98, became only the 30th known man to lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda, its entryways draped in black bunting, his coffin set upon the catafalque built in 1865 to hold the coffin of Abraham Lincoln. One woman, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has lain in state in the Capitol, but her coffin was placed in National Statuary Hall, adjacent to the Rotunda.\", \"In a short ceremony, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky was the only Republican to eulogize Mr. Dole, whom he eclipsed in 2018 as the longest-serving Senate Republican leader. Mr. McConnell honored the man who had been grievously wounded in the Italian campaign during World War II as the last of the \\u201cgreatest generation\\u201d to run for president, in 1996.\", \"\\u201cBob was blessed with long life to watch his legacy take effect,\\u201d Mr. McConnell said.\", \"The Democrats who spoke \\u2014 Mr. Biden, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the current majority leader \\u2014 all extolled virtues in Mr. Dole that they implied were lacking in his successors.\", \"Mr. Schumer called him \\u201ca principled, pragmatic Kansan\\u201d who \\u201cnever hesitated to work with Democrats.\\u201d Ms. Pelosi also spoke of principle, as well as patriotism.\", \"But it was the president who used the moment to appeal to the gathering \\u2014 and the country at large \\u2014 to rediscover what Americans hold in common.\", \"\\u201cThe truth of the matter is, as divided as we are, the only way forward for democracy is unity, consensus \\u2014 the only way,\\u201d Mr. Biden said. \\u201cMay we follow his wisdom and his timeless truth and reach consensus on the basic fundamental principles we all agree on.\\u201d\", \"Thursday morning at the Capitol seemed to recall a less bitter time, in honor of a man who himself spoke to a more perfect union. Not long after Mr. Dole began his presidential campaign, his opponent, Bill Clinton, was impeached amid extraordinary ill will. As Mr. Dole was leaving the Senate in 1996 to assume the mantle of his party\\u2019s nominee, he famously took a call from Mr. Clinton, spoke warmly to him and concluded, \\u201cI want to just thank you for all the times we\\u2019ve been able to work together.\\u201d\", \"Just months after Mr. Clinton defeated Mr. Dole, the president awarded his vanquished opponent the Presidential Medal of Freedom.\", \"\\u201cUpon receiving this medal, Senator Dole challenged us, in his words, \\u2018not to question American ideals or replace them, but to act worthy of them,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Pelosi said.\", \"Mr. McConnell recalled a particularly acerbic quote that Mr. Dole had for the conservative \\u201crevolutionaries\\u201d who helped the Republicans win majorities in both houses of Congress in 1994; the new majority leader said that if he had known Republicans would win the majority, he would have recruited better candidates. The anecdote may have been a dig by Mr. McConnell at his own right flank, which has been working against his efforts to keep the government from defaulting on its debt in the coming weeks.\", \"Before the ceremony, the building was buzzing with friendly joshing. Lloyd J. Austin III, the secretary of defense, chatted with Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the majority leader. Pat Roberts, a former Republican senator, joined a reunion of fellow Kansans in bidding goodbye to the man from Russell, Kan.\", \"And in the spirit of bipartisanship that was being celebrated \\u2014 or mourned \\u2014 two former Senate majority leaders, Tom Daschle, a Democrat from South Dakota, and Trent Lott, a Republican from Mississippi, met in Mr. McConnell\\u2019s office and walked together to the Capitol\\u2019s rotunda.\", \"The ceremony, in all its solemnity, was known well to Mr. Dole. In one of his last public appearances, he rose from his wheelchair in 2018 to pay his respects to former President George H.W. Bush as he lay in state under the dome, in the geographic center of the nation\\u2019s capital. Nine years ago this month, another senator, Daniel K. Inouye of Hawaii, also lay in state and received a send-off from Mr. Dole, a lifelong friend with whom Mr. Inouye had convalesced in a Battle Creek, Mich., military hospital recovering from life-changing war wounds.\", \"As Mr. McConnell noted, Mr. Dole had lived long enough to see politics \\u2014 and his party \\u2014 change. Just weeks before Mr. Inouye\\u2019s death in 2012, Mr. Dole sat slightly slumped in his wheelchair on the Senate floor and accepted the well-wishes of senators he was imploring to vote for a United Nations treaty that would ban discrimination against people with disabilities. He reasoned with them that the United States was already in compliance, and that he merely wanted the rest of the world to recognize the advances that he and other Americans with disabilities already enjoyed.\", \"Then, after Mr. Dole\\u2019s wife, Elizabeth, rolled him off the floor, Republicans voted down the treaty that the ailing Mr. Dole so longed to see passed \\u2014 but that they insisted would infringe on American sovereignty.\"]","href_hash":"37aaa41e594611ec9a020f1a04d95d96"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"37aaa41e594611ec9a020f1a04d95d96"}},
