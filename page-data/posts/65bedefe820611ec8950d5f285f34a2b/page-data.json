But it\\u2019s the opening scene in \\u201cThe Collision and What Came After, or, Gunch!,\\u201d a play being presented alongside \\u201cThe Martyrdom\\u201d by Two Headed Rep at 59E59 Theaters. Despite the comic potential of this setup, these works, inspired by the writing of the 10th-century nun and playwright Hrotsvitha of Gandersheim, are neither as funny nor \\u2014 at two hours and 40 minutes \\u2014 as snappy as they could be.\", \"In \\u201cThe Collision,\\u201d written by Nadja Leonhard-Hooper, the patient Sister Gudrun (Emma Ramos) and the critical Sister Anise (Lizzie Fox) try to teach the young Sister Gunch (Layla Khoshnoudi) the responsibilities of the ideal nun: doing chores, praying, hand-copying Bibles \\u2014 you know, the usual. But Gunch is foul-mouthed, blunt and curious about more than just God. \\u201cAll of nature is vile and fecund and touching itself,\\u201d she says with lustful wonder, recounting a time she watched one goat mount another.\", \"When a giant meteorite lands near the convent, the abbess goes the way of the Wicked Witch of the East and Gunch suffers a fatal attack that she miraculously survives. The event forces the characters to reconsider the lessons in faith they\\u2019ve been taught \\u2014 which messages are prophetic and which ones heretical, and why.\", \"The script has a few delicately written passages, for example, when Gudrun describes \\u201cgray-black clouds\\u201d that gather \\u201cas if trying to bind the sky like a wound.\\u201d The performers also have some standout moments: Halima Henderson, who plays a couple of secondary characters, has a priceless bit as a messenger with no grasp of social cues. And Khoshnoudi, with her dreamy glances and devilish grin, could have her own play, her own TV series, in fact, as the delightfully peculiar Gunch.\", \"As for the story itself, it\\u2019s zany, though to what end isn\\u2019t always clear; Lily Riopelle\\u2019s direction, which incorporates physical humor and playful props (a severed hand, a dead pigeon and a chicken called \\u201clittle queen,\\u201d designed by Liz Oakley), often reads as amateurish. Though the play gets a lot of mileage from its narrative twists and turns, which pull the story into the realms of science fiction and absurdism, the script can\\u2019t successfully pull off its final maneuver, an explicit criticism of institutional religion and a grand statement on storytelling.\", \"\\u201cA story is a snake, and we are mice inside it, swallowed whole but still alive,\\u201d a character says at one point. That sentiment can be applied to this play, which swallows its characters \\u2014 and some narrative logic \\u2014 in its bizarre contortions.\", \"If \\u201cThe Collision\\u201d is more enamored with its quirks than with cohesive storytelling, then \\u201cThe Martyrdom\\u201d is its antipode, a play so procedural that it leaves little space for strangeness and wonder.\", \"After a brief intermission, the four actresses return for this second play, the full title of which is so long that reading it requires its own intermission: \\u201cThe Martyrdom of the Holy Virgins Agape, Chionia, and Irena, by Hrotsvitha the Nun of Gandersheim, as Told Throughout the Last Millennium by the Men, Women, Scholars, Monastics, Puppets, and Theater Companies (Like This One) Who Loved Her, or: Dulcitius.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe Martyrdom,\\u201d directed by Molly Clifford, is based on Hrotsvitha\\u2019s play \\u201cDulcitius,\\u201d about three pious sisters who try to remain chaste despite the intentions of lascivious politicians. \\u201cDulcitius\\u201d appears throughout the course of \\u201cThe Martyrdom,\\u201d though in different pieces and different forms.\", \"With translation by Lizzie Fox and new text by Amanda Keating, \\u201cThe Martyrdom\\u201d is a history lesson, celebrating the legacy of Hrotsvitha, who is considered to be the first female playwright to have her work recorded, by providing a timeline of major incarnations of \\u201cDulcitius.\\u201d\", \"So the show begins in a monastery during Hrotsvitha\\u2019s lifetime, where a council or monks reviews the playwright\\u2019s work. Then centuries later, Hungarian nuns write a modern, vernacular adaptation of \\u201cDulcitius.\\u201d Then there are the French artists who use marionettes to tell the tale of the three sisters. Then the British suffragist in the 1800s, and an American nun at the University of Michigan in the 1950s. It\\u2019s a clever move for such dated material: In each scene the characters act out parts of the play, each version reflecting the changing context of the material over time. After each section, a fourth-wall-breaking educational moment occurs when the actresses provide more details about Hrotsvitha\\u2019s text and its various productions.\", \"The result, unfortunately, is colorless and, like \\u201cThe Collision,\\u201d unnecessarily long. \\u201cThe Martyrdom\\u201d tries to stretch out scenes of Hrotsvitha\\u2019s play across history to suit its structure, despite the fact that the play\\u2019s plot is already pretty anemic, so there\\u2019s not enough action to go around.\", \"It doesn\\u2019t help that Cate McCrea\\u2019s set design for the tiny theater, which seats about 50, is rather bland: a plain back wall, a long rectangular bar that bisects the length of the stage, serving as a table or desk or bench as needed.\", \"Somewhere between \\u201cThe Collision\\u201d and \\u201cThe Martyrdom\\u201d is a holy middle ground of oddity and structure, chaos and order, that would make even a Saxon nun from the 10th century say, \\u201cAmen.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"65bedefe820611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"65bedefe820611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
