He was 98.  \", \"His death was announced by the Elizabeth Dole Foundation. It did not say where he died. He had announced in February that he had Stage IV lung cancer and that he was beginning treatment.\", \"A Republican, Mr. Dole was one of the most durable political figures in the last decades of the last century. He was nominated for vice president in 1976 and then for president a full 20 years later. He spent a quarter-century in the Senate, where he was his party\\u2019s longest-serving leader until Mitch McConnell of Kentucky surpassed that record in June 2018.\", \"As the old soldiers of World War II faded away, Mr. Dole, who had been a lieutenant in the Army\\u2019s storied 10th Mountain Division and was wounded so severely on a battlefield that he was left for dead, came to personify the resilience of his generation. In his post-political career, he devoted himself to raising money for the World War II Memorial in Washington and spent weekends there welcoming visiting veterans.\", \"In one of his last public appearances, in December 2018, he joined the line at the Capitol Rotunda where the body of former President George H.W. Bush, an erstwhile political rival and fellow veteran, lay in state. As an aide helped him up from his wheelchair, Mr. Dole, using his left hand because his right had been rendered useless by the war, saluted the flag-draped coffin of the last president to have served in World War II.\", \"Politically, Mr. Dole was a man for all seasons, surviving for more than three decades in his party\\u2019s upper echelons, even though he was sometimes at odds ideologically with other Republican leaders.\", \"He was national Republican chairman under President Richard M. Nixon in the early 1970s; the running mate to President Gerald R. Ford in 1976; chairman of the Senate Finance Committee during Ronald Reagan\\u2019s presidency in the 1980s; and presidential standard-bearer during Newt Gingrich\\u2019s \\u201crevolution\\u201d of the mid-1990s, when the Republicans captured the House for the first time in 40 years and upended the power dynamic on Capitol Hill.\", \"More recently, Mr. Dole, almost alone among his party\\u2019s old guard, endorsed Donald J. Trump for president in 2016, after his preferred candidates had fallen by the wayside. On the eve of his 93rd birthday, he was the only previous Republican presidential nominee to appear at the party\\u2019s convention in Cleveland, where Mr. Trump was nominated.\", \"Mr. Dole himself ran three times for the White House and finally won the nomination in 1996, only to lose to President Bill Clinton after a historically disastrous campaign. He had given up his secure post in the Senate to pursue the presidency, although, as he acknowledged, he was more suited to the Senate.\", \"As the Republican leader, he helped broker compromises that shaped much of the nation\\u2019s domestic and foreign policies.\", \"He was most proud of helping to rescue Social Security in 1983, of pushing the landmark Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 and of mustering a majority of reluctant Republicans to support Mr. Clinton\\u2019s unpopular plan to send American troops to Bosnia in 1995. (Mr. Dole was not wild about the deployment either, but he long believed that a president, of either party, should be supported once he decided something as important as committing troops abroad.)\", \"A skilled legislative mechanic, Mr. Dole understood what every senator wanted and what each could live with, and he enjoyed the art of political bartering.\", \"He was so at home in the Senate\\u2019s marble corridors that during his last campaign, in 1996, he constantly had to remind voters that he was \\u201cnot born in a blue suit\\u201d \\u2014 Dole shorthand for saying that he had a life before arriving in Washington in 1961. In fact, he had been shaped profoundly by the twin experiences of growing up poor in Depression-era Kansas and enduring the shattering wounds of war.\", \"With dust storms blackening the skies of his tiny hometown, Russell, in north-central Kansas, and destroying the wheat economy, the Doles moved into the cramped basement of their home and rented out the upstairs to make ends meet.\", \"As for the war, it changed the course of Mr. Dole\\u2019s life. A star athlete who lettered in football, basketball and track and who was voted best looking in his class at Russell High School, he had planned to become a surgeon. Instead, he came home from the war in Europe in a body cast, mostly paralyzed.\", \"He spent 39 months convalescing, much of it in surgery \\u2014 as a patient, not as the surgeon he had hoped to become. Instead, he became a lawyer and a politician, though his injuries kept him from many of the fundamental rituals of politics. His right hand was so damaged that he couldn\\u2019t shake hands, and he would clutch a pen in his fist to discourage people from trying. Unable to cut his meat with a knife, he tended to avoid political dinners and ate at home.\", \"Mr. Dole began his political career as a conservative and evolved into a pragmatist, even forging relationships with prominent liberals. With George S. McGovern of South Dakota, he expanded the food stamp program, and with Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota, he made school lunches a federal entitlement. Kansas farmers applauded both efforts.\", \"He was such a good deal-maker that his own convictions were not always apparent. By the end of his long career, Mr. Dole had cast more than 12,000 votes, having stood on both sides of many issues.\", \"He opposed many of the Great Society programs of President Lyndon B. Johnson, but he supported the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\", \"Avoiding budget deficits had been his North Star, given his hardscrabble youth. Sometimes he supported tax increases, which led Mr. Gingrich to brand him \\u201cthe tax collector for the welfare state.\\u201d But in 1995, he tried to recast himself as a tax-cutter, memorably telling party leaders, \\u201cI\\u2019m willing to be another Ronald Reagan, if that\\u2019s what you want.\\u201d He then signed a pledge not to raise taxes as president, a pledge he had previously rejected.\", \"\\u201cIt adds a certain poignancy,\\u201d Richard Norton Smith, the former director of the Robert J. Dole Institute of Politics at the University of Kansas, said in an interview for this obituary in 2009, \\u201cthat he found himself chasing the caboose of movement conservatism at the height of his career.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Dole thrived as chairman of the Finance Committee, a powerful position that attracted big corporate donors often seeking favors. At one point he raised more money from special interests than any other senator. A particularly generous donor was Dwayne Andreas, chairman of Archer Daniels Midland, the giant agribusiness; over two decades, the company received millions of dollars in tax breaks and federal subsidies.\", \"\\u201cWhen these political action committees give money, they expect something in return other than good government,\\u201d Mr. Dole bluntly told The Wall Street Journal, pinpointing why the system benefited wealthy interests over poor ones.\", \"His fellow Republican senators elected him their leader in both the majority and the minority for a combined 11 years, from 1985 to 1996.\", \"He conducted much of his bargaining with other senators on the balcony off the Republican leader\\u2019s office. When he left the Senate in 1996, his colleagues unanimously passed a resolution naming it the Robert J. Dole balcony. It overlooked the National Mall and the Washington Monument, affording him what he wistfully called \\u201cthe second-best view in Washington.\\u201d Unofficially, the balcony was called \\u201cDole Beach,\\u201d because he often escaped there to soak up the sun and refresh his perpetual tan.\", \"But away from Capitol Hill, Mr. Dole was a fish out of water. His insider skills as a tactician and deal closer did not translate to the presidential campaign trail.\", \"During the 1996 race, he was faulted as having no overarching vision \\u2014 for his campaign or for the country. He chafed at handlers who tried to package him, and he never adapted to the scripted politics of the television age. During speeches, he often lapsed into legislative lingo and referred to himself in the third person. He was detached as a candidate, more wry commentator than engaged participant.\", \"\\u201cStayed on message,\\u201d Mr. Dole congratulated himself in front of reporters after one campaign event, then went on to mock the process in which he was involved: \\u201cEvery time I do that \\u2018reconnect the government to values\\u2019 stuff, I feel like a plumber.\\u201d\", \"After that final quest for the presidency, Mr. Dole became a lobbyist for the powerhouse international law firm Alston & Bird. Despite his standing as a well-connected Washington insider, he cultivated a new persona, one unexpected for a man of Mr. Dole\\u2019s dark visage and mordant wit: that of self-deprecating loser.\", \"\\u201cPlaying up the image of the downtrodden also-ran was great fun,\\u201d he wrote in his 2005 book, \\u201cOne Soldier\\u2019s Story: A Memoir.\\u201d He starred in Super Bowl commercials for Visa (\\u201cI just can\\u2019t win\\u201d) in 1997 and for Pepsi in 2001 and later made a cameo in a Pepsi ad featuring Britney Spears. He spoofed previous ads he had made for the male potency drug Viagra, for which he had become a spokesman after undergoing surgery for prostate cancer.\", \"\\u201cOnce you lose,\\u201d he told The New York Times, \\u201cpeople like you.\\u201d\", \"It was a surprising turn for Mr. Dole, who was long linked in the public mind with the glowering Nixon. He had defended that beleaguered president so fiercely that one critic branded him Nixon\\u2019s \\u201chatchet man,\\u201d a label that stuck.\", \"Like Nixon, Mr. Dole had overcome struggles early in life. And like Nixon, he felt embittered toward people for whom he thought things came easy.\", \"\\u201cI trust in the hard way, for little has come to me except in the hard way,\\u201d he said when he announced he was leaving the Senate in 1996.\", \"His bitterness found an outlet in partisanship, which he often expressed in acerbic asides. It flared in public during a vice-presidential debate in 1976, when he blamed Democrats for all the wars of the 20th century, and again in 2004, when some fellow Vietnam veterans challenged the military record of Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the Democratic presidential nominee. Mr. Dole, who had received two Purple Hearts and a Bronze Star with an oak leaf cluster, joined in, questioning whether Mr. Kerry had deserved his Purple Hearts.\", \"\\u201cThree Purple Hearts,\\u201d Mr. Dole said of Mr. Kerry, \\u201cand never bled that I know of.\\u201d\", \"Robert Joseph Dole was born in his parents\\u2019 house in Russell on July 22, 1923, the second of four children of Doran and Bina (Talbott) Dole. His mother was an expert seamstress and sold sewing machines; his father worked in a creamery and later ran a grain elevator.\", \"Mr. Dole enlisted in the Army Reserve during college and was called to active duty in 1943. On April 14, 1945, in the mountains of Italy outside the small town of Castel D\\u2019Aiano, about 65 miles north of Florence, the Germans began firing on his platoon. When he saw a fellow soldier fall, Mr. Dole went to pull him to safety. But as he scrambled away he was struck by flying metal. It blew apart his right shoulder and arm and broke several vertebrae in his neck and spine.\", \"His men dragged him back to a foxhole, where he lay crumpled in his blood-soaked uniform for nine hours before he was evacuated. He was just 21.\", \"It was a horrifying turn of events for one of Russell\\u2019s most promising young men. Unable to feed or care for himself, he feared he was doomed to a life of selling pencils on the street.\", \"He spent more than three years recovering and underwent at least seven operations. Back in Russell, he devised a homemade weight-and-pulley system to rebuild his strength. The townspeople rallied around him, pooling their nickels and dimes for his treatment.\", \"Russell was a speck on the flat Kansas prairie, but in the Dole biography it took on mythic significance. In his political campaigns, Russell was cast as the shaper of noble, small-town virtues and Mr. Dole as their personification.\", \"Remembering that period, and the generosity of his neighbors, often brought him to tears. In his first appearance with President Ford in Russell in 1976, with 10,000 well-wishers crammed into the downtown business district, he thanked the townspeople for their support after the war. Then he started to cry and couldn\\u2019t go on. The audience fell silent. Finally, Mr. Ford stood and began clapping, and the audience joined in.\", \"Regaining his composure, Mr. Dole said: \\u201cThat was a long time ago.\\u201d\", \"And yet even in 1996, long after Russell and his recovery had become a staple of his origin story, he could hardly mention that period without choking up. When his image-makers wrote references to it in his prepared remarks, he would often skip over those passages or truncate them to avoid the inevitable tears.\", \"He could not avoid them on the final leg of his presidential campaign, however, by which time it was clear that he was going to lose. At a bowling alley in Des Moines, his friend Senator John McCain, a former naval aviator and Mr. Dole\\u2019s wingman in those last days on the road, delivered a spontaneous tribute to him.\", \"\\u201cThis is the last crusade of a great warrior,\\u201d Mr. McCain told a small crowd over the clatter of falling bowling pins, \\u201ca member of a generation of Americans who went out and made the world safe for democracy so that we could have lives that were far better for ourselves and for our children.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Dole, standing nearby, wept.\", \"After the war, during his recuperation, he met Phyllis Holden, an occupational therapist, and married her three months later, in 1948. He returned to college on the G.I. Bill. He already had credits from the University of Kansas, where he had studied pre-med. With Ms. Holden\\u2019s help, he earned a dual bachelor\\u2019s and law degree in 1952 at Washburn Municipal University (now Washburn University) in Topeka, Kan. They had a daughter, Robin, in 1954.\", \"Readjusting his aspirations from medicine to the law, Mr. Dole had to develop his mind, he said, because he could not use his hands. His life, he said, would be \\u201can exercise in compensations.\\u201d\", \"Russell Republicans approached him in 1950 to run for the Kansas State Legislature \\u2014 they saw the hometown war hero as an easy sell. But Mr. Dole had not yet picked a party, though his parents were New Deal Democrats. He said later that he had signed on with the Republicans after he was told that that\\u2019s what most Kansas voters were.\", \"After a stint in the Legislature and as Russell County attorney, he won a House seat in Congress in 1960 and ascended to the Senate in 1968.\", \"Nixon won the presidency that same year and became the driving political influence in Mr. Dole\\u2019s life. Mr. Dole saw them as soul mates. Both were self-made men, politically ambitious loners disaffected from their party\\u2019s elite Eastern establishment, Nixon hailing from California.\", \"Mr. Dole made a name for himself by zealously defending Nixon, particularly in the president\\u2019s continued prosecution of the Vietnam War and his controversial Supreme Court nominees. He could be so snarly, though, that Senator William B. Saxbe, Republican of Ohio, memorably derided him as Nixon\\u2019s \\u201chatchet man\\u201d and said he was so disagreeable, \\u201che couldn\\u2019t sell beer on a troop ship.\\u201d\", \"Even Nixon worried that Mr. Dole\\u2019s lust for the fight would undermine his effectiveness. In a memorandum made public years later, Nixon wrote that it was \\u201cimportant that we not let Dole destroy his usefulness by having him step up to every hard, fast one.\\u201d\", \"Nixon named him chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1971. It was a role Mr. Dole relished as he raked in political chits. The travel kept him far from home, and he and Phyllis divorced in 1972.\", \"Three years later he married Elizabeth Hanford, then a federal trade commissioner; she later became a cabinet secretary, president of the American Red Cross and a senator from North Carolina. They became one of Washington\\u2019s original power couples.\", \"Elizabeth Dole as well as Mr. Dole\\u2019s daughter, Robin Dole, survive him. His first wife, Phyllis Holden Macey, died in 2008. \", \"After Nixon won re-election in 1972 and the Watergate scandal was closing in, he dumped Mr. Dole as party chairman, saying the senator was too independent. But Mr. Dole remained loyal, so much so that he tried to shut down the live television coverage of the Watergate hearings.\", \"When Nixon died in 1994, Mr. Dole delivered a sentimental eulogy, sobbing as he described the disgraced former president as a \\u201cboy who heard train whistles in the night and dreamed of all the distant places that lay at the end of the track.\\u201d\", \"He also recalled Nixon\\u2019s advice that while failure was sad, \\u201cthe greatest sadness is not to try and fail, but to fail to try.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Smith, the historian, said he believed that Nixon, in his preparations for his own funeral, had a political motive in asking Mr. Dole to deliver the eulogy. Nixon, Mr. Smith said, expected that Mr. Dole would become emotional, and that his \\u201cauthentic display of grief\\u201d would reveal Mr. Dole\\u2019s human side and perhaps help his presidential bid.\", \"Ford, who was Nixon\\u2019s vice president and successor as president, gave Mr. Dole his first shot at national office, choosing him as his running mate in 1976. Ford needed to shore up strength with conservatives and also hoped that the selection would appeal to voters in farm states. But Mr. Dole\\u2019s performance during the vice-presidential debate on Oct. 15, 1976, against Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic nominee, was so harsh that some analysts say it contributed to Ford\\u2019s loss to Jimmy Carter.\", \"In response to a question about Ford\\u2019s 1974 pardon of Nixon, Mr. Dole veered off topic and in an inexplicable tangent said: \\u201cI figured up the other day, if we added up the killed and wounded in Democrat wars in this century, it would be about 1.6 million Americans, enough to fill the city of Detroit.\\u201d\", \"A stunned Mr. Mondale said he could not believe that Mr. Dole would cast the war against Germany and Japan in partisan terms. Mr. Dole, he said, \\u201chas richly earned his reputation as hatchet man.\\u201d Even Republicans joined in the post-debate criticism, as did Mr. Dole himself.\", \"\\u201cI went for the jugular,\\u201d he said later. \\u201cMy own.\\u201d\", \"The reaction was so negative that he sought out an image consultant and paid her to help him appear more likable.\", \"Still, he ran for president in 1980, a misbegotten venture that ended almost as soon as it began. He tried again in 1988 and won his party\\u2019s Iowa caucus, but couldn\\u2019t overcome Vice President Bush\\u2019s forces in New Hampshire, where Bush had the invaluable support of the governor, John Sununu, and ran a TV spot suggesting that Mr. Dole would raise taxes.\", \"The ad infuriated Mr. Dole, who snapped that Bush should \\u201cstop lying about my record.\\u201d The comment only reinforced the impression that Mr. Dole was too mean to be president.\", \"But by 1996 his party seemed incapable of denying him the nomination. At that point, President Clinton was popular, the nation was enjoying a period of peace and prosperity, and the strongest potential Republican contenders \\u2014 Gen. Colin L. Powell among them \\u2014 declined to run.\", \"Mr. Dole prevailed over a weak primary field that included Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, former Gov. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Patrick Buchanan, a conservative broadcast journalist. But then Mr. Dole ran a terrible general election campaign, offering voters little rationale for denying Mr. Clinton a second term. At times, he made no pretense that he was even taking his task seriously.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re trying to get good pictures,\\u201d he told reporters on his campaign plane the day after he quit the Senate to devote himself full time to running for president. \\u201cDon\\u2019t worry very much about what I say.\\u201d\", \"In 1995, Richard Ben Cramer, one of Mr. Dole\\u2019s biographers, asked him to name the first thing he might do in the White House.\", \"\\u201cHaven\\u2019t thought,\\u201d he replied in clipped Dole-speak, as quoted by Mr. Cramer.\", \"\\u201cIf I get elected, at my age, you know,\\u201d he trailed off, revealing a paucity of plans for the presidency. \\u201cI\\u2019m not goin\\u2019 anywhere. It\\u2019s not an agenda. I\\u2019m just gonna serve my country.\\u201d\", \"His lack of preparation stood in stark contrast to his wife\\u2019s tendency to over prepare. Mrs. Dole delivered a polished star turn for her husband at the Republican National Convention in San Diego in 1996. But her choreographed precision only highlighted how much her husband was winging it.\", \"\\u201cWatching Bob Dole campaign for the presidency,\\u201d the journalist Michael Kelly wrote in The New Yorker, \\u201cis a curious and dislocating experience, like showering clothed or eating naked.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Smith, the historian, said he was always puzzled about why Mr. Dole, who had sought the nomination for so long, seemed to take it so casually and \\u201cwasn\\u2019t willing to adapt himself to the changing media climate.\\u201d Mr. Smith concluded that this was a mark of Mr. Dole\\u2019s integrity. \\u201cHe couldn\\u2019t jackknife himself into a persona that was fundamentally at odds with the real thing,\\u201d he said.\", \"Others said his goal was not the presidency but winning the nomination \\u2014 and proving he could rehabilitate himself politically just as he had physically.\", \"Mr. Dole won 41 percent of the popular vote, with Mr. Clinton taking 49 percent and Ross Perot, a Reform Party candidate, winning 8 percent. The magnitude of Mr. Dole\\u2019s loss was more evident in the electoral votes; he won just 159 to Mr. Clinton\\u2019s 379.\", \"In his memoir almost a decade later, Mr. Dole framed his crushing defeat in a way that would have made Nixon proud.\", \"\\u201cLosing means that at least you were in the race,\\u201d he wrote. \\u201cIt means that when the whistle sounded, life did not find you watching from the sidelines.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4320dcae55f011ec84d48fe74a98f66f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4320dcae55f011ec84d48fe74a98f66f"}},
