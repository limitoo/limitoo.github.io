Additional arguments state that Facebook told investors it had \\\"the most robust set of content policies out there,\\\" but knew that this was false.\", \"This information comes from recent congressional testimony from Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen, who has repeatedly described the platform as \\\"dangerous.\\\" A former company executive, Haugen produced internal documents showing that the company was aware that Facebook was used to spread dissidence and caused harm to users, but \\\"refused to correct these issues.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931885/meta-facebook-logo.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Facebook's parent company, Meta, is being sued by investors who argue that the company's practices caused the price of their stocks to unfairly rise.

This includes the use of Facebook by drug cartel members and human traffickers.\", \"Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook has become the world's largest social networking platform, with an estimated 3.5 billion users across its sites.\", \"The suit alleged that the combined actions of the company revealed by the whistleblower amounted to the \\\"[employing of] devices, schemes, and artifices to defraud.\\\"\", \"This lawsuit is the latest in a number of legal issues that Facebook has seen in recent weeks. On November 4, an antitrust lawsuit was filed against the company by Phhhoto, a now-defunct startup, accusing the tech giant of copying its work, according to The New York Times. \"]","href_hash":"c9eefdbc443211ec8062a7d8bc5e790f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c9eefdbc443211ec8062a7d8bc5e790f"}},
