So Ms. Gonzales, who works remotely for a medical research company, looked 100 miles north to Bakersfield. In January, she snagged a three-bedroom house with hardwood floors and a pool for $342,000, and joined a wave of in-state migration to one of the last affordable frontiers in California\\u2019s frenzied housing market.\", \"For generations, Bakersfield has been the Golden State\\u2019s defiant outlier, a place Americans are unlikely to picture when they imagine California. At one of the city\\u2019s premier parks, a jogging trail winds along a bluff top with vistas not of the glittering sea, but of nodding pump jacks scattered across the vast, brown landscape of the Kern River Oil Field. Residents, many of whom proudly claim their descent from \\u201cOkies\\u201d fleeing the Dust Bowl and from migrant farmworkers from Mexico, joke that Bakersfield is the Texas of California.\", \"Now, amid a housing crisis that has helped halt the soaring population boom that made California the economic and cultural powerhouse it is, Bakersfield has emerged as unusual in another respect: It is growing, as homes are snapped up by people like Ms. Gonzales, searching for backyards, extra bedrooms or crosstown commutes measured in minutes, not hours.\", \"Last year, when state demographers recorded California\\u2019s first population decrease, Bakersfield grew the fastest of the state\\u2019s 10 biggest cities, bringing its population to almost 400,000. Apartment vacancies are at historic lows. And while home values have increased significantly, experts say there aren\\u2019t yet the signs they\\u2019ve seen in other once-affordable refuges, such as Fresno and Sacramento, that the market is spiraling out of reach.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s still a bargain, price-wise, compared to most places in California,\\u201d said Jenny Schuetz, an urban economist with the Brookings Institution.\", \"The median price of a house in Kern County, the largely rural expanse that includes Bakersfield, was $340,000 in October, less than half the state number. In Riverside County, an inland community that has drawn thousands of people priced out of Los Angeles, it was $580,000.\", \"But growth has inevitably brought change and questions about a civic identity defined by Bakersfield\\u2019s difference. And the influx of newcomers is arriving as the city\\u2019s historic industries, oil and agriculture, face existential challenges amid deepening climate crises.\", \"Gov. Gavin Newsom has vowed to end fossil fuel production in California by 2045. Kern County is a state leader in solar and wind production, but local officials fear the oil industry will be gutted before renewable energy or other industries can replace the relatively high-paying jobs it provides.\", \"Richard Gearhart, an associate professor of economics at California State University, Bakersfield, said the average pay for farmworkers is less than a third of the $2,000 per week that workers without college degrees can make in the oil fields.\", \"The economic pinch is a political issue in a region where on-the-ground debates often belie a reputation for conservative partisanship.\", \"\\u201cShow me the jobs, and show me the money,\\u201d said Rudy Salas, a Democratic state lawmaker from Bakersfield who is running for Congress in one of the nation\\u2019s most closely fought political battlegrounds. \\u201cIf somebody\\u2019s making six figures right now in the energy sector, and you\\u2019re promising them a minimum wage job to install solar panels, they just want to be made whole.\\u201d\", \"The debate has increased pressure to diversify the kinds of jobs available to residents and to market the city less as the southern gateway to California\\u2019s agricultural heartland than as an outer borough of Los Angeles.\", \"When Andrae Gonzales first joined the Bakersfield City Council in 2017, he recalled, \\u201cthe mantra was, \\u2018How do we do less with less?\\u2019\\u201d These days, he said, leaders are having a different conversation: \\u201cHow do we improve amenities for people so that they can enjoy the city?\\u201d\", \"Bakersfield\\u2019s core, he added, is uniquely poised for a revival, as young professionals drive up costs in urban centers across the country.\", \"As evidence, Mr. Gonzales led a whirlwind tour of his downtown district, where for decades antique malls have filled the storefronts of the sturdy midcentury buildings that give its streets the look of a movie set.\", \"He ducked into the nation\\u2019s last operating Woolworth\\u2019s luncheonette, where nostalgic diners were getting their final burgers before the building closed for renovations. The owners of the Five and Dime Antique Mall, which occupied most of the space, were retiring. Moneywise Wealth Management was moving in.\", \"Mr. Gonzales also stopped outside the 17th Place Townhomes, whose clean, modern design might not garner a second look in another city. But to Anna Camp Smith, one half of the couple that developed and owns the complex, they\\u2019re a symbol of a promising future.\", \"\\u201cJust for people to see that kind of dense, urban housing in their town is opening their minds to the idea that we can really, actually have an urban environment here,\\u201d she said on a recent afternoon, chatting over quinoa bowls and salad at a cafe across the street.\", \"Two-bedroom townhouses rented for $1,800. They\\u2019re all occupied now, and Ms. Smith and her husband, the son of a city councilman, are developing another 49 units a couple of blocks away.\", \"Autumn Paine, 45, said she and her husband wanted to find a place where they could largely abandon their cars; both had routinely spent hours in Bay Area traffic for work. During a visit to see Ms. Paine\\u2019s family in the spring of 2020, they stumbled upon the townhomes and were intrigued.\", \"\\u201cWe were like, \\u2018Should we do this?\\u2019\\u201d she recalled between sips at a bar marked by a 1950s-style neon sign, steps away from her front door. \\u201cLike, who moves to Bakersfield?\\u201d\", \"Now, Ms. Paine, a lawyer, walks a block to an office near the courthouse. Her kids love their new home.\", \"Developers are also scrambling to reel in would-be suburbanites.\", \"Near the western edge of town, workers hammered away at Spanish Mission and modern farmhouse-style mansions in Stockdale River Ranch, a \\u201cmaster-planned community\\u201d developed by Bolthouse Properties, founded by one of the region\\u2019s most storied farming families.\", \"And at a time when many of the state\\u2019s most desirable suburbs are hemmed in by development, like Irvine in Orange County, there\\u2019s lots of open land around Bakersfield.\", \"Just south of Kern County and north of Los Angeles, Tejon Ranch Co., another historic landholder-turned-developer, has been fighting for decades to build a community of more than 19,000 homes. The effort got a boost this month when an environmental group agreed to drop opposition to the project in exchange for promises to make it greener.\", \"Still, many are skeptical that Bakersfield will transform into another glossy, white-collar California exurb.\", \"Kern County has among the nation\\u2019s worst air, in part, experts say, because of the presence of the oil and gas industry and in part because of topography. On a recent morning drive, bright sunshine in Los Angeles suddenly gave way to a thick, gravy-colored haze in Kern County.\", \"Local elected leaders have clashed with state officials over pandemic restrictions, and the region has been one of the state\\u2019s hardest hit by illness and death.\", \"Like the rest of the state, Kern County is also plagued by inequality. And experts say that wealthier newcomers could widen the gaps and push out the most vulnerable residents, in what has become a troubling cycle throughout the state.\", \"\\u201cGentrification is the wolf that lurks on my shoulder all the time,\\u201d said Lorelei Oviatt, Kern County\\u2019s planning director. \\u201cHow do you lift the quality of the community while preserving the culture?\\u201d\", \"Ultimately, Kern County is part of California \\u2014 for better and worse, said Representative David Valadao, a Republican whose district encompasses part of Bakersfield. Mr. Valadao, who is facing a challenge from Mr. Salas, the state lawmaker, blamed state policies for the eye-popping gas prices, prohibitive housing costs and hiring difficulties for employers that have driven away some Californians.\", \"\\u201cIf they can find a way to save a lot more money on the cost of living, they\\u2019re not going to stay in California,\\u201d he said.\", \"Ms. Gonzales, the recent transplant from Los Angeles, said that someday she might consider moving to another state. But not now.\", \"She has loved being closer to her parents, who still live in Delano, the agricultural community where she grew up. And she is relishing spending time at home, hosting dinner parties or lounging by the pool, with company from her Doberman pinscher, Kali, who thrives in the big yard. Recently, a friend visited her from New York City.\", \"\\u201cShe was like, \\u2018I love this,\\u2019\\u201d Ms. Gonzales recalled. \\u201c\\u2018I want to move to a place like this.\\u2019\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"474877945ab711ec9ba443da26b17799"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"474877945ab711ec9ba443da26b17799"}},
