The elevators were always broken, his small room faced a brick building and he needed permission every time he wanted to venture out.\", \"So last year, during the height of the pandemic, he traded up to the Watermark at Brooklyn Heights, a new luxury \\u201csenior living community\\u201d housed in a former 16-story hotel from the 1920s, with colonnaded towers that evoke an Italian palazzo, an indoor swimming pool and a small army of caregivers to anticipate his needs.\", \"Mr. Morin\\u2019s son, Tim, who lives nearby and suggested the Watermark to his father, is amazed by the opulence. \\u201cThis is never what I would have envisioned assisted living for my aging parent to look like,\\u201d said Tim Morin, the president of an executive coaching firm. \\u201cIt\\u2019s the nicest building he\\u2019s ever lived in. And he lived in a nice co-op in Murray Hill for 30-something years.\\u201d\", \"His father would concur. Relaxing with a Lee Child thriller at the Watermark\\u2019s rooftop lounge with sweeping views of the Brooklyn Bridge and Manhattan skyline, Mr. Morin smiled and said, \\u201cTake a look around you. The ambience here is fantastic. The chef comes out and asks, \\u2018Was that meal good enough?\\u2019 I didn\\u2019t even know the chef at the other place.\\u201d\", \"The Watermark is one of several luxury assisted-living homes that have sprung up in the last few years, especially in places like New York City with its many affluent retirees with upmarket tastes and cosmopolitan demands. Others include the Sunrise at East 56th and Insp\\u012br Carnegie Hill, a purpose-built hi-rise on the Upper East Side that opened last spring.\", \"These upscale retirement homes cater to the affluent end of the \\u201cthe silver tsunami\\u201d \\u2014 the coming wave of aging baby boomers who are still socially and culturally active, and who have become accustomed to a certain quality of life.\", \"The vibe at these places is less dreary nursing home and more five-star wellness resort. (Indeed Watermark has recruited an executive from Canyon Ranch to run its fitness offerings.)\", \"During a recent tour of Watermark, Rocco Bertini, its executive director, pointed out \\u201cthe several F and B rooms on the property\\u201d \\u2014 hospitality-speak for food and beverage \\u2014 including the main 140-seat dining room with plush seating and double-height ceiling; a \\u201cEuropean-style\\u201d cafe with freshly baked pastries, smoothie bar and eco-friendly packaging; and a Mediterranean-style gastro pub with a pizza oven and exposed brick.\", \"\\u201cWhat we\\u2019re selling is a lifestyle,\\u201d Mr. Bertini said.\", \"Insp\\u012br, meanwhile, brims with opulent finishes and luscious amenities. The soaring, light-filled lobby features a Yamaha grand piano, Roman travertine floors, a green onyx wall and Seguso chandelier. A concert by Yo-Yo Ma at the nearby 92nd Street Y streams to the in-house TV channel. The 17th floor \\u201csky park\\u201d has a wraparound terrace, bistro and lounge with a fireplace. The expansive view of the East River from the 23rd floor penthouse is breathtaking.\", \"One resident, Marilyn Snyder, describes it as \\u201cthe QE2 on the East River.\\u201d\", \"Luxury comes at a high cost. Monthly fees at the Watermark range from $8,295 for studio apartments, to $20,295 for a two-bedroom. That does not include a one-time membership fee ($50,000 for independent living, $20,000 for assisted living and memory care).\", \"Fees at Insp\\u012br start at $13,500 a month and includes room and board, a concierge and special events and programs. Medical care is extra. A penthouse starts at $29,750 a month.\", \"By contrast, the median cost for assisted living in the United States is about $4,000 a month, according to a recent report by Genworth Financial, an insurance firm. And Medicare isn\\u2019t footing the bill at these \\u201cprivate pay\\u201d facilities.\", \"But the Watermark may also be the easiest exclusive club in New York to get into: A year after opening last October, it had just 30 residents (capacity is 275). The common spaces were empty, the solicitous staff stood around a bit aimless.\", \"The 215-unit Insp\\u012br was slightly more bustling, with roughly 60 residents so far. The pandemic and the its devastating toll on nursing homes have no doubt posed a challenge.\", \"Tim Mullaney, the editor of Senior Housing News, a trade publication, said places like Insp\\u012br and the Watermark are promoting \\u201cthe idea of affinity rather than exclusivity\\u201d \\u2014 that is, to live among like-minded people. And in cities like New York, the high cost of living and urban setting means that there is a large pool of highly educated, financially successful and culturally curious retirees who are seeking similar company.\", \"David Freshwater, the chairman of Watermark Retirement Communities, said giving seniors three squares and meeting their basic living needs, as many nursing homes have done for the World War II generation, is not going to cut it for more demanding boomers.\", \"\\u201cBoomers question things,\\u201d Mr. Freshwater said. \\u201cThey don\\u2019t want to be entertained so much as engaged.\\u201d\", \"To that end, the Watermark has a 16-seat movie theater and an art gallery. A recent exhibit, \\u201cNot Another Second,\\u201d told \\u201cthe stories of 12 LGBT+ seniors and the years they lost not living their authentic selves,\\u201d according to the show\\u2019s website. Insp\\u012br offers a class in memoir writing, meditation and other forums for self-actualization. At another luxury facility, Atria West 86, in Manhattan, Billie Jean King is the \\u201cwell-being coach,\\u201d providing residents the glow of celebrity.\", \"Perhaps the strongest concession to boomer vanity is how these rich retirement residences sell a vision of wellness and renewal, and avoid any mention of aging and mortality.\", \"By adopting the look and language of hospitality (at the Watermark, help getting dressed is called a \\u201cdiscreet service\\u201d), keeping residents busy with cultural and personal enrichment, and obscuring medical services, these members of the rock \\u2018n\\u2019 roll generation don\\u2019t feel they are in the old folks\\u2019 home. If not for the red pull cords in the showers and bedside, residents could fool themselves into thinking they were forever guests at a luxury resort.\", \"Ms. Snyder, the Insp\\u012br resident, said the decision to move from her Upper East Side apartment into assisted living was not an easy one. A former actress known professionally as Maggie Burke, she still remembers visiting her grandmother in a dreary nursing home with \\u201ca little cot bed and rather crude facilities,\\u201d and did not want the same for herself, she said. A tour of Insp\\u012br, not far from her old apartment and favorite restaurants, changed her mind.\", \"\\u201cI decided I would get good health care here and also live in a very luxurious setting,\\u201d said Ms. Snyder, who declined to give her age.\", \"Ms. Snyder started a film club and she\\u2019s taking the memoir-writing class. \\u201cI\\u2019ve made some lovely friends,\\u201d she said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s a very stimulating population.\\u201d\", \"Back at the Watermark, Mr. Morin was enjoying the view from the rooftop lounge, where he reminisced, \\u201cI was sitting up here with a glass of wine and there\\u2019s a jazz band playing over here and I looked up at God in heaven and said, \\u2018I\\u2019m home.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Mr. Morin said his one-bedroom, two-bathroom apartment with its kitchenette, marble shower and tasteful modern furniture reminds him of the finest hotels, \\u201cbut better,\\u201d he said, because he\\u2019s a resident. The cost is largely covered by a long-term care policy he took out ages ago.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m a lucky dog,\\u201d Mr. Morin added, pointing out how quickly the elevators there zoom up and down. \\u201cI went to four other homes before I came here, OK? This is paradise.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"79e842d54f6c11ec8baa4d62fa3f3a26"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"79e842d54f6c11ec8baa4d62fa3f3a26"}},
