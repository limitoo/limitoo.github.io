Results are expected within two weeks.\", \"Health Ministry director-general Nachman Ash, whose approval is needed to launch a new booster campaign, did not immediately announce a decision, with some experts say there was not enough scientific data to justify fourth shots.\", \"Ash told a news conference on Thursday (local time) he had decided that, for now, a second booster would be offered only to immunocompromised people, such as cancer patients and organ transplant recipients.\", \"\\\"In light of the existing gaps in knowledge in the world about the effectiveness of a fourth dose, in the present situation, we are acting cautiously and responsibly,\\\" Ash said.\", \"\\\"If we see signs showing severe illness is expected to rise among the older populations then we will make that decision.
