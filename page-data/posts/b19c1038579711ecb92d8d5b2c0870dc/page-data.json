She was 82.\", \"The death was confirmed by Patrick Leimberger, a representative from Agence Goodwin, the company that represented Ms. Blais. He said that the cause had not been determined.\", \"Ms. Blais burst onto the Canadian literary scene in 1959 when, at just 20, she published her first novel, \\u201cLe Belle B\\u00eate\\u201d (\\u201cThe Beautiful Beast\\u201d), which was later published in English as \\u201cMad Shadows.\\u201d The book revolves around a girl who is jealous of the attention her mother ladles on her developmentally disabled brother, and it shocked many readers with its depiction of violence, including murder, and implied incest.\", \"The book appeared at the dawn of the \\u201cquiet revolution,\\u201d a time of rapid secularization and social change in Quebec, and Ms. Blais became a standard-bearer for a new, assertive era of Quebecois culture.\", \"\\u201cLe Belle B\\u00eate\\u201d was relatively conventional in its prose, but by the mid-1960s, Ms. Blais had begun to shove aside literary conventions, drawing critical attention.\", \"She made unbelievably long sentences a hallmark of her work; the opening sentence of \\u201cLe Sourd Dans la Ville\\u201d (1979), published in English as \\u201cDeaf to the City,\\u201d occupied 55 pages. Dialogue might appear without quotation marks. Within each sentence she might shift time, place and points of view, stranding readers unable to go with the flow of her sometimes hallucinatory prose.\", \"\\u201cThe narration drops the reader into the flow of the characters\\u2019 psyches like white-water rafters negotiating a particularly rocky cataract,\\u201d the critic Steven W. Beattie wrote in July in Quill and Quire, a magazine about the Canadian book industry.\", \"Raised in a working-class family in Quebec City and educated at Roman Catholic schools, Ms. Blais wrote about venal nuns, street-corner philosophers, drug addicts, lechers, prostitutes, farmers and fishermen, her characters rarely upstanding and their situations never much better than grim.\", \"Her most famous work, \\u201cUne Saison Dans la Vie d\\u2019Emmanuel\\u201d (\\u201cA Season in the Life of Emmanuel\\u201d), centers on a family whose members suffer poverty, child abuse, reform school and untimely death. The book was a smash, winning the Prix M\\u00e9dicis, a French award given to rising literary talent, in 1966, the year it was published in French (it was translated to English a year later).\", \"Ms. Blais was encouraged along her ascent by the American critic Edmund Wilson, who called her a \\u201cgenius\\u201d in his 1965 book \\u201cOh Canada: an American\\u2019s Notes on Canadian Culture,\\u201d and later helped her win two grants from the Guggenheim Foundation.\", \"He also introduced her to his literary circle in Wellfleet, on Cape Cod, including the painter Mary Meigs. Ms. Blais and Ms. Meigs became both professionally and romantically involved; Ms. Meigs illustrated several books by Ms. Blais, and the couple moved to France and then to Montreal.\", \"The couple later separated and Ms. Blais moved to Key West in the mid-1980s, eventually becoming an American citizen. But she continued to write in French, for a Quebecois audience, and while her books achieved renown in the Francophone world, they were less read in the rest of Canada, and she was largely unknown in the United States.\", \"\\u201cWill American Readers Ever Catch On to Marie-Claire Blais?\\u201d read the headline to a 2019 article in The New Yorker by the Canadian writer Pasha Malla. His answer on whether they would was equivocal, but on whether they should, he left no doubt.\", \"Her last 10 novels, the focus of his article, composed a cycle Ms. Blais called \\u201cSoifs,\\u201d which she translated as \\u201cthirst for everything.\\u201d They were set in unnamed but obviously American locations, including a stand-in for Key West, and they explored how intimate turmoils led to grand-scale consequences: nuclear annihilation, racism, climate change.\", \"\\u201cThe \\u2018Soifs\\u2019 novels,\\u201d Mr. Malla wrote, \\u201cseem both to encompass entire lives and to take place in the course of a single day; the effect of reading them is not be to be anchored concretely in a fictional universe but to be swept away in a current of language and sensation.\\u201d\", \"Like William Faulkner, another writer with whom she was often compared, Ms. Blais believed that collective human experiences, including evils like white supremacy and world war, were the result of inner personal conflicts, and that it was the duty of the writer to explore them.\", \"\\u201cIn writing you are obliged to probe humanity\\u2019s wounds,\\u201d she told The Globe and Mail newspaper in 1985. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not amusing.\\u201d\", \"Marie-Claire Blais was born on Oct. 5, 1939, in Quebec City. Her family was poor; her mother, V\\u00e9ronique (Nolin) Blais, had left her job as a teacher to raise Marie-Claire and her four siblings, and her father, Fernando, was a refrigerator technician.\", \"She is survived by all four of her siblings, Michel, Robert, Th\\u00e9r\\u00e8se and Helene.\", \"Ms. Blais attended Roman Catholic schools but left at 15 when her parents ran out of money. She rented her own apartment, worked in a cookie factory and a clothing store, and took night classes in writing at the Universit\\u00e9 Laval in Quebec City.\", \"She drew the attention of Jeanne Lapointe, an English professor, and Father Georges-Henri L\\u00e9vesque, the vice president of the Canada Council for the Arts, who helped her secure grants that allowed her to write \\u201cLa Belle B\\u00eate.\\u201d\", \"Some 50 books followed over the next six decades, including 29 novels, nine plays and three volumes of poetry. She won practically every prize available to Canadian writers, including four Governor General\\u2019s Academic Medals, one of the country\\u2019s highest literary honors.\", \"She also won praise from fellow Canadian writers. Robertson Davies, one of the country\\u2019s leading novelists of the 20th century, called her a \\u201cwriter with an enormous capacity for imaginative creation,\\u201d in a 1966 review of \\u201cA Season in the Life of Emmanuel\\u201d \\u2014 though he also faulted her work as morose, saying he wished \\u201cthat Mlle. Blais had a dash of humor in her composition, so that she could tell a gothic phantom from a Halloween pumpkin.\\u201d\", \"But Ms. Atwood, writing in The New York Times in 1974, saw in her writing a sense that \\u201csuffering unites.,\\u201d and other critics found a vision of solace, even hope, in her works.\", \"Ms. Blais agreed, insisting that it was only by exploring pain and tragedy that one can find an affirmation of life.\", \"The reason she wrote, she explained in her 1968 novel \\u201cManuscrits de Pauline Archange,\\u201d published in English as \\u201cThe Manuscripts,\\u201d was \\u201cto go down into that depth of mud and dried leaves to take a last look at all the living and the degenerate dead from whom, more than my birth, more than my life, I had to extract my resurrection.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b19c1038579711ecb92d8d5b2c0870dc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b19c1038579711ecb92d8d5b2c0870dc"}},
