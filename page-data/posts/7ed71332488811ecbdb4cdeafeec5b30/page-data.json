Blackstone closed its deal to acquire a majority stake in shapewear brand that values it at $1.2 billion on Thursday.\", \"Founded more than 20 years ago, Spanx has become synonymous with the foundation garments it sells. Ms. Winfrey helped put the brand on the map in its early days when in 2000 she named Spanx her favorite product of the year.

Blackstone also recently acquired Ms. Witherspoon\\u2019s Hello Sunshine production studio, adding her to the board of its parent media company.
