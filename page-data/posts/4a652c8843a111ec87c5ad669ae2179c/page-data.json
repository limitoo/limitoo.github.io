The disclosure blindsided the family of the victim, whose name he never mentioned.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-12T10:15:16.000Z","content":"[\"PHILADELPHIA \\u2014 Late at night on Sept. 30, 1965, Edward David White, 18, walked toward his family\\u2019s rowhouse in the West Philadelphia neighborhood after his shift at a suburban diner. Known as David to his family and friends, he had a son who was 8 months old, and his girlfriend was pregnant with their daughter. They planned to marry in the spring.\", \"Mr. White did not make it home. A 16-year-old gang member, drunk on cheap wine and seeking retribution for the stabbing death of a member of his crew, shot him with a .38-caliber handgun, piercing his heart and his right lung. Mr. White, who was unarmed and had no police record, was left to die in the street.\", \"His killer went on to a prosperous life as a sports and marketing executive. He is Larry Miller, now 72, a former team president of the Portland Trail Blazers and the head of the Michael Jordan brand at Nike. He kept the secret of his murderous past for more than half a century, revealing it in a recent Sports Illustrated interview and a forthcoming book.\", \"Mr. Miller wonders in the book how he became fortunate enough to leave his old neighborhood. But he never names his victim in an advance copy of the book viewed by The New York Times, and he spends little time reckoning with the devastating implications for Mr. White, who never got a chance to hold his daughter, to see his son become a high school basketball star, to spoil his grandchildren. Fifty-six years after Mr. White\\u2019s death, his family members say they have been blindsided again by Mr. Miller and left grieving anew, caught unaware that the magazine article and the book were going to be published.\", \"A family member saw the Sports Illustrated article by chance online. Mr. White\\u2019s name was mentioned in the article, and Mr. Miller said he planned to reach out to the family. But relatives say they still have not heard from Mr. Miller. They are upset that he did not mention Mr. White\\u2019s name or details of his life in the book. Mr. White remains thinly drawn as an anonymous victim, a stranger, \\u201canother Black boy.\\u201d\", \"A onetime Cub Scout, Mr. White had earned spending money as a youngster by helping shoppers carry their groceries home from the supermarket. He could be mischievous, too. He sometimes drove his sister\\u2019s 1960 Chevy, even though he did not yet have his driver\\u2019s license, and once, after an overnight trip, had to explain to his parents how he had suddenly obtained a basket of food from his grandmother\\u2019s house in Maryland. He got his job at the diner through the city\\u2019s Youth Corps program six months before he was killed, his parents said at the time, and wanted to become a chef.\", \"At the least, the family would like Mr. White\\u2019s name and story to be inserted into Mr. Miller\\u2019s book before it is published, if possible. \\u201cJump: My Secret Journey From the Streets to the Boardroom,\\u201d written by Mr. Miller with his eldest daughter, Laila Lacy, is scheduled to be published in January by William Morrow, an imprint of HarperCollins.\", \"\\u201cYou know his name, give him that respect, especially since you took his life,\\u201d said Mariah Green, an elementary schoolteacher in Philadelphia who is a great-niece of Mr. White\\u2019s.\", \"Mr. Miller did not respond to messages on Thursday requesting a comment. Reached by telephone, his executive assistant asked a reporter to send her an email, which neither she nor Mr. Miller responded to. A representative for William Morrow, the publisher, also did not answer emails requesting comment.\", \"Mr. Miller was arrested on the night of the shooting. He pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, was placed in a prison for young offenders and was released after four and a half years. He served five more years for a series of armed robberies. But in his 30s, he found ballast in his capsized life, earned a bachelor\\u2019s degree and a Master of Business Administration and began to climb the corporate ladder, hobnobbing with star athletes like Jordan and Derek Jeter and producing fashion shows that featured Miss Universe and Tyra Banks as models for the Jantzen swimsuit company.\", \"He considers himself the beneficiary of redemption that is possible when corrections officials provide education and rehabilitation and hope for inmates instead of mere warehousing.\", \"Mr. Miller does express remorse in the book. He acknowledges that the killing was unprovoked and senseless, and that he did not know his victim or whether he belonged to a rival gang. His regret for the murder \\u201cwould never ease \\u2014 nor should it,\\u201d Mr. Miller wrote, adding, \\u201cI will forever mourn his loss.\\u201d\", \"Writing the book, Mr. Miller says, began to free him from nightmares and migraines. He hopes it will help inspire youths to understand that a life\\u2019s troubled crossroads does not have to mean a dead end. But while Mr. Miller has been able to move forward, Mr. White\\u2019s family members say they find themselves handcuffed to the past.\", \"Josaphine Hobbs, 75, the mother of Mr. White\\u2019s children, said she was so distraught at Mr. White\\u2019s death that she tried to climb into his grave at the funeral. She said she dropped out of nursing school to raise her young son and daughter as a single mother and was unable to claim Social Security survivors\\u2019 benefits for the children. And because she had not graduated high school, she soon lost a clerical job at an insurance company.\", \"She has repressed so many memories of the killing that she can remember nothing of a man accused, a sentence handed down.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t think my mom ever got over that trauma,\\u201d said Azizah Arline, Mr. White and Ms. Hobbs\\u2019s daughter, now 55, who owns a day care center and lives in Pennsauken, N.J. \\u201cIt changed the entire pattern of her life.\\u201d\", \"Four years after Mr. White\\u2019s death, Ms. Hobbs married and had two more children. She resumed her career as a secretary. But a question continues to burn in her heart: What did Mr. White do to inflame such malice in Mr. Miller? She asks but knows the answer. Mr. White did nothing.\", \"\\u201cDavid wasn\\u2019t in a gang; he didn\\u2019t get into fights,\\u201d Ms. Hobbs said. \\u201cHe got shot going home.\\u201d\", \"Mr. White\\u2019s eldest sister, Barbara Mack, now 84 and echoing other family members, said she did not understand how Mr. Miller was released from prison after serving only four and a half years for murder, even though he was a juvenile when he committed the crime.\", \"\\u201cThat shows that Black on Black crime, no one really cared,\\u201d Mrs. Mack said.\", \"For years, she said, she avoided the West Philadelphia corner of 53rd and Locust Streets, where her brother died. It was too painful even for the family to discuss the killing. Hasan Adams, 56, Mr. White\\u2019s son, honored his father by giving his own eldest son, also named Hasan, the middle name David. Until he read the Sports Illustrated article last weekend, he knew only that his father had been shot while coming home from work.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s mind blowing,\\u201d said Mr. Adams, a Philadelphia postal worker. \\u201cThe furthest thing from my mind was that the killer of my father was a wealthy and successful businessman and he\\u2019s writing a book.\\u201d\", \"When he tried to tell his wife, Mr. Adams choked up and couldn\\u2019t get the words out.\", \"\\u201cI was scaring her,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mrs. Mack, Mr. White\\u2019s sister, has written to William Morrow, saying that the revisiting of an \\u201cungodly act reopens a wound, the hurt, the tears\\u201d of what happened decades ago. She wants the publishing company, and Mr. Miller, to know that her brother was not merely a stranger shot with no regard, but a teenager loved by his parents and four siblings.\", \"Mr. White\\u2019s family says it wants something more than remorse from Mr. Miller. It wants some kind of atonement. A formal apology. A letter. A meeting with the family. A scholarship in Mr. White\\u2019s name. Perhaps some financial reparation for Mr. White\\u2019s children from the profits of the book.\", \"In the Sports Illustrated article, powerful figures like Adam Silver, the N.B.A. commissioner, and John Donahoe, the Nike chief executive, praised Mr. Miller for disclosing his past. Mr. Silver said Mr. Miller\\u2019s experience \\u201cmade him an especially supportive and understanding friend when it came to dealing with others\\u2019 foibles and mistakes.\\u201d He said he was amazed by Mr. Miller\\u2019s career, but was ultimately \\u201cleft with a feeling of sadness that Larry had carried this burden all these years without the support of his many friends and colleagues.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Donahoe called Mr. Miller\\u2019s story \\u201can example of the resilience, perseverance and strength of the human spirit\\u201d and said he hoped it would \\u201ccreate a healthy discourse around criminal justice reform.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Miller is to be commended for rebuilding his life, said Willie Gray, 79, a longtime friend of the White family and a former warden at Holmesburg Prison in Philadelphia. But, Mr. Gray added, \\u201cIf he wanted to be truly redeeming, before he set pen to paper he would have reached out to the remaining members of the family and let them know how bad he felt and asked, \\u2018Can you find it in your hearts to forgive me?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Mr. Miller and Mr. White lived eight blocks apart in large middle-class families. Mr. Miller\\u2019s father worked at a factory that made drywall; his mother was a stay-at-home parent. Mr. White\\u2019s father was a self-employed painter and hung wallpaper; his mother was a nurse. Neither teenager liked school.\", \"Mr. Miller describes himself as a straight-A student who found a sense of cool and belonging in a gang instead of in a classroom. Two years after the killing, he was named valedictorian of the 157 teenage inmates who received their high school diplomas at a correctional institution.\", \"Mr. White did not graduate from high school, preferring to work. He was known for his sense of style \\u2014 a fedora worn at a jaunty angle, sunglasses, sharply creased slacks, brogues known locally as \\u201cold man Comforts.\\u201d Mr. Adams keeps a photo of his dapper father on his phone.\", \"\\u201cI always heard that he was so cool and nothing bothered him too much,\\u201d he said.\", \"Mr. White also had what his eldest sister, smiling, described as a vocabulary like a profane jukebox loaded with the music of \\u201cmaybe 500 curse words,\\u201d uttered with the same gleefulness with which he danced and sang to songs by the Temptations. \\u201cMy Girl\\u201d was his favorite.\", \"Before heading to work on Sept. 30, 1965, Mr. White stopped and bought two sweaters. As he came home that night, he encountered Mr. Miller and several other allies of the Cedar Avenue gang. Earlier that month, a member of that gang had been stabbed to death by a rival from the 53rd and Pine Streets gang. Mr. Miller was out for revenge.\", \"Mr. Miller writes that he carried a .38-caliber handgun given to him by his girlfriend. He and three companions surrounded Mr. White on the corner of 53rd and Locust.\", \"Mr. White pleaded that he was not in a gang and raised his hands. Mr. Miller shot him in the chest and kept walking, thinking to himself \\u201cthat was one down\\u201d and that he was \\u201con the hunt\\u201d for another rival gang member. It would be decades before he could come to terms with what he had done in killing \\u201ca boy who was just like me.\\u201d\", \"Years later, as his criminal life became a corporate life, Mr. Miller says that he lost a job offer from the Arthur Andersen accounting firm after acknowledging the murder. After that, he says, he did not lie about it but omitted the truth. Until now.\", \"Mr. White was pronounced dead at a hospital visible from his parents\\u2019 home. He was interred 20 miles away in Rolling Green Memorial Park in West Chester, Pa., buried near his parents, George and Pearl White, and an older brother, George Jr.\", \"He died before all of them. His 75th birthday would have been Nov. 21.\", \"\\u201cI never met the man,\\u201d said his daughter, Mrs. Arline. \\u201cThat\\u2019s not fair.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"4a652c8843a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4a652c8843a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}},
