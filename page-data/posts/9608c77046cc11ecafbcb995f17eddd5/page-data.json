One mother stood outside the gate, crying. Another yelled through it, demanding to put in touch with her child in Jonestown. A reporter walked into the backyard. All were barred from entering.\", \"Then the relatives made their way to the U.S. embassy, where a flustered Ambassador Burke told the despairing group that his hands were tied; Jonestown was private property. If they trespassed, they would be arrested.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932966/georgetown-peoples-temple-base.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The People's Temple headquarters, 41 Lamaha Gardens, Georgetown. Up to 60 or 70 people lived and worked at the residence. </div>\", \"At the hotel, Ryan held a press conference questioning the Temple's tax exempt status, noting that he hadn't seen any religious symbols in the Georgetown house or on the group's letterhead. Jonestown sounded a lot like a \\\"prison\\\" to him, he said, and he worried about residents' \\\"mental health.\\\"\", \"In Jonestown, when he recounted the day's drama to his followers later, Jim Jones was full of angry swagger.\", \"Again and again, he expressed a desire to die. He took yet another suicide vote.\", \"After a brief pause, he continued his tirade against the Temple's enemies in a defeated tone. If he didn't let the delegation in, Congressman Ryan would return to the States and put even more pressure on Jonestown. And eventually another, larger, group would fly down to assail them.\", \"In Georgetown, Ryan announced to the concerned relatives and reporters that he'd located, and chartered, a twenty-passenger plane, which would fly them up to Port Kaituma the next afternoon.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1932298/port-kaituma.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Port Kaituma airstrip. Leo Ryan chartered a 22-seat plane to visit Jonestown in November 1978.</div>\", \"His aide, Jackie Speier, would later state that the congressman believed the presence of the media would protect him from danger; he didn't believe Jones would do anything rash in front of a large group of journalists. The surviving newsmen would later say they believed the opposite to be true as well: that Ryan's stature as a congressman would protect them.\", \"Julia Scheeres is an award-winning journalist and author.
