Should this tenant get her deposit back?\\\"\", \"The video starts with him unlocking the door and explaining that there was a putrid smell coming from inside.\", \"As the door opens, the source of the odor becomes clear, with feces visible on floors, walls and even door handles.\", \"Narrating the footage, Nunya said: \\\"So, this is a tenant of mine that has been evicted\\u2014Section 8.\\\" This refers to an affordable housing program for very low-income individuals and families in Oregon.\", \"He went on: \\\"So, this is me checking it out to see what that smell was. And it's very obvious what the smell is coming from. You can see all the feces on the floor from the German shepherd she left in there. That's more on the door knob, disgusting.\\\"\", \"The apartment opens out into the kitchen, with nearly every surface covered in trash or decaying food.\", \"Brown smears are visible on the floor, while a tell-tale discoloration can also be seen around the door handle to the bathroom and on the door.\", \"Nunya added: \\\"And that's feces in an ice cube tray.
