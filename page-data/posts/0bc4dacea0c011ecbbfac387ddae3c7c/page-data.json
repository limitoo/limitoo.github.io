Applicants will be offered jobs on the spot, the agency said.\", \"\\\"Available positions include temporary, term and permanent jobs. Many are entry-level clerk and tax examiner positions in the Wage and Investment Division,\\\" the agency said. \\\"No prior tax experience is required.\\\"\", \"The Wage and Investment Division handles tasks including processing taxpayer submissions and payments, as well as providing filers with updates about the status of their returns.\\u00a0\", \"The IRS is attempting to make a major hiring push at a time when the labor market is historically tight, with not enough workers to fill the nation's current pool of 11.3 million open positions. Workers are also engaged in the so-called \\\"Great Resignation,\\\" with many quitting their jobs in search of better pay and opportunities.\\u00a0\", \"The IRS might struggle to lure workers based on pay alone: Federal workers are guaranteed a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour.

That comes after only 1 in 10 phone calls got through to an IRS employee last season, leading to frustration among taxpayers trying to get answers about their refund delays.\", \"The IRS said the bots can answer questions about making one-time payments, provide answers to FAQs and clarify collection notices.\\u00a0\", \"The agency said the voice bots will handle more complicated issues later this year, such as authenticating a user's identity to create a payment plan, request a transcript and get information about their accounts.\"]","href_hash":"0bc4dacea0c011ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0bc4dacea0c011ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
