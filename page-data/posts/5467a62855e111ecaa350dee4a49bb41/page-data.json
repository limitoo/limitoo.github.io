Java island erupted with fury, killing at least 14 people with searing gas and ash.\", \"Mount Semeru in Lumajang district in East Java province spewed thick columns of ash more than 12,000 metres\\u00a0into the sky in a sudden eruption that was partially\\u00a0triggered by heavy rains on Saturday.\", \"Villages and nearby towns were blanketed with ash and several hamlets were buried under tonnes of mud from volcanic debris.\", \"Flows of hot gas and lava travelled up to 11 kilometres\\u00a0to a nearby river at least twice on Saturday and three times on Sunday at\\u00a0the\\u00a0smaller distance of up to 2 kilometres, according to Indonesia's Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation Agency.\", \"Authorities warned the thousands of people who fled the volcano's wrath not to return during Sunday's lull in activity but some were desperate to check on livestock and possessions left behind.\", \"In several areas, everything \\u2014 from the thinnest tree branch to couches and chairs inside homes \\u2014 was caked with ash.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5ed73d0cf628f328135dc92728b0c966\\\"

\\u2026 trees, farms, houses are scorched, everything is covered in heavy grey ash,\\\" said Haryadi Purnomo of East Java's search and rescue agency.\", \"He said that several other areas were virtually untouched.\", \"Search and rescue efforts were temporarily suspended on Sunday afternoon because of fears that hot ash and debris could tumble down from the crater due to heavy rains.\", \"On Saturday, a torrent of mud destroyed the main bridge connecting Lumajang and the neighbouring district of Malang, as well as a smaller bridge, said Thoriqul Haq, the district chief in Lumajang.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/9a728287f9270a7a73b1e2be4e7ec3da\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> It is believed days of rain

warned that the dome could still further collapse, causing an avalanche of the blistering gas and debris trapped beneath it.\", \"A thunderstorm and days of rain, which eroded and partly collapsed the dome atop the 3,676-metre\\u00a0Semeru, triggered the eruption, said Eko Budi Lelono, who heads the geological survey centre.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Second eruption\\u00a0this year</div>\",

times over the last 200 years, and\\u00a0is one of 129 under watch in Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago \\u2014 where more than 62,000 people call Sumeru's fertile slopes home.\", \"It last erupted in January, with no casualties.\", \"Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 270 million people, is prone to earthquakes and volcanic activity because it sits along the Pacific \\\"Ring of Fire,\\\" a horseshoe-shaped series of fault lines.\", \"Currently 54 per cent\\u00a0of the country's population live on Java, the country's most densely populated area.\", \"Officials said earlier they had hoped they could avoid casualties by closely monitoring the volcano.\", \"National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said 56 people had been hospitalised, mostly with burns.\", \"He said rescuers were still searching for nine residents of Curah Kobokan village.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ae6e819c64dd2533117cd54dca2af423\\\"
