We simply do not have the resources or facilities, and we don't yet have high enough vaccination rates, to allow Covid to take hold in our local area. We are doing the same and restricting our own staff movements up the coast to an absolute minimum as requested by the iwi.\", \"\\\"As a council, we want certainty for our communities and for our businesses and organisations, keeping Covid under control and making sure the limited heath care facilities we do have are running well.\\\"\", \"Lawrie said vaccinations, social distancing, contract tracing, hygiene and masks continue to be important in the fight against Covid-19.\", \"\\\"Asking people not to travel into vulnerable communities is another way we can help protect each other, and we support our local iwi in their request to keep Covid out of their rohe,\\\" she said.\"]","href_hash":"171499b9590e11ec8d485151c9f69347"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"171499b9590e11ec8d485151c9f69347"}},
