Fiction, October\", \"Some of my favorite songs contain a \\u201cplot twist\\u201d: You think it\\u2019s going to be one type of song, and then, whammo, it turns into another. Classic examples include Soft Cell\\u2019s \\u201cTainted Love\\u201d and Phil Collins\\u2019s \\u201cIn the Air Tonight.\\u201d Some of you may recall that the Collins plot twist was at the heart of a viral video last year that simply consisted of twin brothers filming themselves listening to the song for the first time. A viewer witnesses the precise moment Collins\\u2019s audio sorcery hits the listeners, and the pleasure is pure and true.\", \"I mention that because this novel contains a meta plot twist. It opens with a police officer interrogating a suspect, saying things like \\u201cYour statement doesn\\u2019t add up\\u201d and \\u201cYou\\u2019d better fess up,\\u201d so you think: OK, we are dealing with a noir or possibly a comment on the noir genre. But then, on Page 21, the mystery introduced on Page 1 is solved, leaving us in uncharted waters. I initially kept reading to figure out what, exactly, the book\\u2019s genre would turn out to be, which is admittedly a limited way to read a book \\u2014 not unlike picking a scab to see if it is ready to freely depart or whether the underlying boo-boo will reanimate and bleed. This one (novel, not scab) slipped into a compact tale of state corruption and the interpersonal dynamics of teenagers in modern Seoul.\", \"RIYL: \\u201cJennifer\\u2019s Body,\\u201d the first season of \\u201cSerial,\\u201d Bong Joon Ho, eating alone in a restaurant, eavesdropping\", \"Available from: Other Press\", \"Fiction, 1880\", \"Recently I was attempting to reorganize my books \\u2014 well, that\\u2019s a lie, I was attempting to ORGANIZE my books, which had never been organized \\u2014 and I found a copy of \\u201cWashington Square,\\u201d by Henry James. It\\u2019s a tiny novel, \\u201ca slip of a thing,\\u201d and was originally serialized, so it\\u2019s snappy and swift. (James\\u2019s later novels are the opposite: byzantine, subtle, even the subtexts have subtexts, etc. They are wonderful but require deep concentration.) Anyhow, I hadn\\u2019t read \\u201cWashington Square\\u201d for a decade, and happily dove into what Wikipedia calls \\u201ca structurally simple tragicomedy that recounts the conflict between a dull but sweet daughter and her brilliant, unemotional father.\\u201d\", \"While technically accurate, that summary undersells the book. It is a roller coaster. Catherine is the daughter in question, and she is an affecting character, even if James compares her intellect to \\u201ca bundle of shawls.\\u201d The conflict between Catherine and her father centers on a scheming guy who courts Catherine for her money. Catherine\\u2019s father sees right through this gold digger, but Catherine falls victim to his masculine wiles. The back of my copy has a blurb from Graham Greene that states \\u201cWashington Square\\u201d is \\u201cperhaps the only novel in which a man has successfully invaded the feminine field,\\u201d which is offensive to all genders \\u2014 but a terrific entry into the Backhanded Compliment Blurb Hall of Fame!\", \"I\\u2019ll take the chance here to share a curious datum about James that may or may not influence your reading. One of his close friends was Edith Wharton, and many years ago I visited Wharton\\u2019s estate in Lenox, Mass. (You can take a tour! The gardens are magnificent.) Wharton built special guest quarters for James at the mansion, including an en-suite bathroom. When I visited, I couldn\\u2019t help but notice that his bathroom had no toilet. I\\u2019m pretty certain the other bathrooms had toilets, which are generally considered a staple of the bathroom genre. Was the lack of toilet something James had \\u2026 specifically requested?
