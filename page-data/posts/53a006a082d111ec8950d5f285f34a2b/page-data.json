What makes Tonga especially vulnerable, is that the Kingdom only has one.\", \"\\\"(Cables) are - long term - the most cost effective, and they give you the maximum capacity and reliability... but across the Pacific the cost of building, on a per capita basis, is exorbitant,\\\" says Henderson.\", \"\\\"A rule of thumb is about $US20,000 ($NZ30,370) per kilometre ... and in the Pacific, every cable is a long cable.\\\"\", \"Henderson talks about using satellites, and whether they are a better option.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/183535/eight_col_Screenshot_2019-01-28_Tonga_Portal_%28_tongaportal%29_Twitter.png?1548715534\\\" alt=\\\"A ship has arrived in Tonga to begin cable repairs\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nThe equipment being used to repair the broken cable. \\nPhoto: Twitter/ @tongaportal\\n</div>\", \"The Detail also speaks to The Spinoff's Pacific Communities Editor, Sela Jane Hopgood, about her experience of trying to reach loved ones in Tonga after the eruption.\", \"\\\"For some of them I was literally messaging them the day before talking about random stuff on Facebook and Instagram, so to suddenly lose contact with them so abruptly was really scary\\\" she says.\", \"All of them are safe but Hopgood says there are about 60 people currently living at her aunt's house.\", \"\\\"A lot of her neighbours in the village have had to take refuge there ... because their houses were damaged,\\\" she says.\", \"Hopgood and her family in New Zealand have sent over food and supplies to Tonga but that will take a week to get there.\", \"\\\"They were saying they were down to their last pot of food ...
