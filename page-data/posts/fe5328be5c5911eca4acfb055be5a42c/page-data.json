More than 300 members of the National Guard were going door to door and removing debris.\", \"\\\"We're still hoping as we move forward for some miracles to find more people,\\\" the governor said during a visit to the town of Mayfield, one of the hardest hit.\", \"However, no-one has been found alive since Saturday morning.\", \"Mr Beshear said a tornado had wrecked places all along its 227-mile (365km) path. Thousands of people had their homes destroyed though the exact number was still not clear.\", \"Previously, the longest a tornado had travelled along the ground in the US was a 219-mile storm in Missouri in March 1925 that claimed 695 lives. Such major events outside of the spring and summer months are extremely rare.\", \"In Mayfield, the fire station and the city hall were flattened. \\\"I don't think there's a pane of glass in any vehicle or property that the city owns that isn't shattered,\\\" Mayor Kathy Stewart said.\", \"Eight deaths were confirmed at a candle factor that was hit when 110 employees were believed to be inside, a spokesperson for the company told Reuters news agency.
