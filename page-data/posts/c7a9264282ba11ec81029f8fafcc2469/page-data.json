These surprising social media stars are becoming powerful content creators and influencers \\u2014 affectionately called \\\"granfluencers.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"CBS News correspondent Jamie Yuccas met several of these tech savvy super-agers, who are spreading positivity, smashing stereotypes and making money as social media sensations.\", \"One of those is 68-year-old Lyn Slater. Known on social media as \\\"Accidental Icon,\\\" this former social justice professor is using fashion to fight stereotypes about aging.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"That was the reason I did become popular and I did become successful, because I was conveying this attitude, 'Look at how cool I am and I have gray hair and wrinkles, and I'm not going to let anybody make me be invisible,'\\\" Slater said. \\\"It involves getting out of your comfort zone. For me, if I don't keep growing, that's when I'm going to wither up.\\\"\", \"Marketing strategist Rahel Marsie-Hazen has helped companies connect with granfluencers, presenting growth opportunities for both the seniors and established brands looking to expand their markets.\", \"\\\"People are really craving authenticity,\\\" she said. \\\"So people of all ages are really looking for real people that they can connect with online.\\\"\", \"Younger people feel \\\"really inspired\\\" when they see granfluencers living their lives, dating, traveling and dancing, Marsie-Hazen said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The time is ripe for seniors who've been largely overlooked,\\\" she said.\", \"And the new partnerships can mean an economic boon for seniors.

I'm the same person at 57 that I was at 25. I just have more tattoos and I drive a better car.\", \"\\\"Life is too short to not be the best us we can be,\\\" she said.\", \"The fearsome foursome who call themselves \\\"The Old Gays\\\" have been friends for years.

They have a great deal of respect for us, and that's just absolutely heartwarming to me,\\\" Lyons said.\", \"\\\"It was harder being young, because you're worried about what people think of you, and at 68 I say: This is it, baby. Just be yourself,\\\" said Jessay Martin, another member of the group.\", \"For them, the term \\\"influencer\\\" runs deeper than their social media stats.
