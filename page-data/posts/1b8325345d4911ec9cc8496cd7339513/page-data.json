UK, there is one question everyone wants to know.\", \"How bad is it?\", \"New South Wales today recorded its biggest jump in COVID cases in months \\u2014 with the superspreader event in Newcastle believed to be caused by\\u00a0the Omicron variant.\", \"But authorities are still monitoring local infections, with only one hospitalisation so far attributed to Omicron.\", \"In Australia, local scientists say the relatively small\\u00a0number of\\u00a0cases right now means it is too early to tell.\", \"But overseas,\\u00a0studies are starting to emerge.\", \"This is the latest.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Is it more contagious?</div>\", \"Early data from overseas suggests that the new variant is spreading faster than previous versions of the virus.\", \"In South Africa, the UK and Denmark, the number of new Omicron infections has been doubling every two days, in what one expert described as\\u00a0\\\"an alarming rate of growth\\\".\", \"It has now been detected in 77 countries and the World Health Organization is predicting the peak wave of infections is still weeks away.\", \"On\\u00a0Monday, WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Omicron was spreading at a rate not seen with any previous variant.\", \"\\\"Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems,\\\" he said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">So, is it less severe?</div>\", \"Short answer: It looks like this\\u00a0is the case.\", \"In the first study\\u00a0since Omicron was first detected\\u00a0last month, South African private health insurer\\u00a0Discovery Health assessed\\u00a0211,000 positive COVID-19\\u00a0cases.\", \"Of those, 78,000 were attributed to Omicron, which now accounts for more than 90 per cent of new infections in South Africa.\\u00a0\", \"It showed that the risk of hospital admissions among adults who contracted COVID-19 was 29 per cent lower than in the initial pandemic wave that emerged in March 2020.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/85edcadb71594dd83574c2df880503ac\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Early studies on Omicron are emerging out of South Africa.(Reuters: Siphiwe Sibeko\\u00a0)</div>\", \"However, the study, which has not been peer-reviewed, said the disease may be less severe in South Africa because more than 70 per cent of the population had already been exposed to COVID-19.\", \"Tony Cunningham, a virologist from Sydney's Westmead Institute, said he'd been \\\"watching carefully\\\" the death rate after hospitalisation from the Omicron variant.\", \"\\\"From the\\u00a0early reports I've seen it suggests the\\u00a0death rate after hospitalisation with Omicron is at 3\\u00a0per cent, compared to 20 per cent of Delta,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"But we have seen more\\u00a0younger people being infected, so that is something to keep an eye on.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">But what about the vaccines?\\u00a0\\u00a0</div>\", \"In a nutshell, the vaccines continue to offer protection against severe disease and death.\\u00a0\", \"But with Omicron, early studies suggest they are less effective in stopping the spread of the virus.\", \"The South African study from Discovery Health\\u00a0during the current Omicron wave\\u00a0found two-dose Pfizer vaccination provided\\u00a070 per cent\\u00a0protection against severe complications of COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation.\", \"It also found\\u00a033 per cent\\u00a0protection against COVID-19 infection, which is generally much\\u00a0lower than the previous strains.\", \"\\\"Basically it means Omicron is more spreadable, less virulent, and more able to evade infection immunity,\\\" Professor Cunningham said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"But we don't have really good data yet on the [overall]\\u00a0effectiveness [of the vaccines], that takes time.\", \"\\\"But I suspect natural levels of antibody to remain [with Omicron] and\\u00a0to protect against severe disease and death.\", \"\\\"But it's why boosters are required\\u00a0to improve the antibody levels.\\\"\", \"<img

infectious diseases physician and clinical virologist, said scientists would be watching the data as it came in.\\u00a0(ABC News: Chris Taylor)</div>\", \"The Australian government over the weekend reduced the recommended time for booster shots from six months after the second dose of the vaccine to five months.\\u00a0\", \"And it has encouraged all Australians to get a booster shot to protect themselves from the looming Omicron threat.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">What does it mean for Australia?\\u00a0</div>\", \"It's all wait-and-see right now.\\u00a0\", \"As Australia opens up, there is nervousness in the community, particularly in states such as Queensland, Tasmania \\u2014 and the Northern Territory \\u2014 which have remained relatively COVID free over the past 18 months.\\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Epidemiologist Catherine Bennett from Deakin University said Australians did not need to be as \\\"fearful\\\" as they had in the past.\\u00a0\", \"<img
