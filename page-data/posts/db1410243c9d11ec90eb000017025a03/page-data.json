The claim, which made no specific reference to timing, was the latest sign of mounting tension between the two countries as the prospects of a new agreement on\\u00a0Iran's nuclear program faded.\", \"Since former President Donald Trump's unilateral withdrawal from the 2015 international nuclear agreement with Iran, the U.S. has imposed strict economic sanctions on the country, including restrictions on its sale of oil \\u2014 the lifeblood of Iran's beleaguered economy.\", \"The Iranian regime has for months vowed to revive its oil exports despite the U.S. sanctions, which it considers illegal. \", \"The Biden administration and the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet, which has responsibility for American naval operations in the Persian Gulf and surrounding waters, did not issue any immediate response to Iran's claim on Wednesday. Iranian officials also issued no immediate comment, though the nation's state media serve as a mouthpiece for the regime.\\u00a0\", \"The state-run Mehr news agency's brief report described a \\\"recent\\\" confrontation between speedboats operated by the elite Revolutionary Guard and an American vessel, which it did not identify, in international waters in the Gulf of Oman.
