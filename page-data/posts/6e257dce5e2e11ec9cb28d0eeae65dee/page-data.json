On Monday, 37 players tested positive, the league\\u2019s highest single-day total since the pandemic reached the United States. While the outbreaks haven\\u2019t yet caused the postponement of games, the potential absences of high-impact players could alter the results of matchups with playoff implications for the teams involved.\", \"They kick off with Thursday night\\u2019s A.F.C. West battle between Kansas City, the winner of six straight games, and the Los Angeles Chargers, who are a game behind in the division. The Covid-19-depleted Cleveland Browns need to win Saturday\\u2019s game against the Las Vegas Raiders to keep their postseason hopes alive, while the Indianapolis Colts and New England Patriots should provide an old-school, ground-based game that night.\", \"And the potential Aaron Rodgers vs. Lamar Jackson showdown between the Green Bay Packers and the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday should show what both teams have left in the tank ahead of playoff runs.\", \"Below is a look at N.F.L. Week 15, with all picks made against the spread.\", \"Last week\\u2019s record: 8-6\", \"Kansas City at Los Angeles Chargers, 8:20 p.m., NFL Network and Fox\", \"Line: Kansas City -3.5 | Total: 50.5\", \"This has the potential to be the best Thursday night game of the season, or at least in the conversation with Cowboys vs. Buccaneers in Week 1 and Cardinals vs. Packers in Week 8.\", \"Kansas City (9-4) has won six consecutive games and its defense has not allowed more than 20 points in a game during that stretch. But consider its opponents:the Packers without Aaron Rodgers in Week 9, the Cowboys without Amari Cooper in Week 11, interspersed with the Giants, the Raiders and the Broncos. Yeccch!\", \"The Chargers (8-5) will test Kansas City\\u2019s revived defense, which played horribly in the first half of the season. Los Angeles Coach Brandon Staley was optimistic that safety Derwin James (hamstring) could play, and his availability would help in guarding tight end Travis Kelce. Chargers receiver Keenan Allen returned from the Covid-19 reserve list this week, and running back Austin Ekeler (ankle) should also play.\", \"Both teams will have key players out because of Covid-19, with the Chargers missing left tackle Rashawn Slater and Kansas City playing without defensive tackle Chris Jones, but the Chargers have consistently played Kansas City well, and three of the last five matchups have been decided by one score. The over is appealing in this one, too. Pick: Chargers +3.5\", \"Las Vegas Raiders at Cleveland Browns, 4:30 p.m., NFL Network\", \"Line: Browns -3 | Total: 40.5\", \"The Browns (7-6) placed eight players on the Covid-19 list Tuesday, including two of their best offensive weapons, receiver Jarvis Landry and tight end Austin Hooper, followed by positive tests from their quarterback, Baker Mayfield, and head coach, Kevin Stefanski, on Wednesday. It is nearly impossible to forecast who will be available as the team deals with an outbreak, but Cleveland should still beat the Raiders (6-7), which has lost five of their last six games.\", \"The Browns\\u2019 postseason chances hinge on this one \\u2014 Cleveland\\u2019s playoff odds increase to 56 percent with a win, according to the playoff predictor \\u2014 while Las Vegas is playing its most embarrassing football of the year, plagued by offensive sloppiness, turnovers and defensive inefficiencies. Pick: Browns -3\", \"New England Patriots at Indianapolis Colts, 8:15 p.m. NFL Network\", \"Line: Colts -2.5 | Total: 45.5\", \"This game should be good, and, to be honest, the close spread is somewhat of a surprise. The Colts (7-6) are ascending thanks to Jonathan Taylor, the league\\u2019s leading rusher. The Patriots (9-4), though, hold the A.F.C.\\u2019s top seed thanks to efficient, risk-averse play by the rookie quarterback Mac Jones, a strong running game and a stout defense.\", \"New England is mediocre against the run, allowing an average of 136 yards over the last three games, but against the Colts, Coach Bill Belichick needs only to focus his game plan to combat Taylor (hint: Make Carson Wentz win it.) Opposing defenses have yet to stop the Patriots\\u2019 offense, and until someone offers a blueprint, it\\u2019s safer to bet with the Patriots. Pick: Patriots +2.5\", \"Green Bay Packers at Baltimore Ravens, 4:25 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Packers -4.5 | Total: 43.5\", \"Having vaulted into the N.F.C.\\u2019s top seed this week, the Packers (10-3) can put some distance between themselves and the Buccaneers and Cardinals, who are also 10-3, with a win against the Ravens (8-5), who have been one of the most injured teams in the league this season.\", \"Baltimore quarterback Lamar Jackson sprained an ankle last week, but Coach John Harbaugh expects him to play. Baltimore is missing its top two cornerbacks, Marcus Peters and Marlon Humphrey, and so it needs Jackson to control the clock and cut down his turnovers to keep the ball away from Aaron Rodgers and the Packers\\u2019 offense. That predicament that seems nearly impossible since Jackson is also the team\\u2019s most reliable rusher. Green Bay can definitely exploit the Ravens\\u2019 absences better than other teams have. Pick: Packers -4.5\", \"Tennessee Titans at Pittsburgh Steelers, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Titans -1.5 | Total: 41.5\", \"The spread on this one should probably be larger. Yes, the Titans (9-4) are without running back Derrick Henry (foot) and receiver A.J. Brown (chest), but they have shown that they can still move the ball well on offense \\u2014 as long as they don\\u2019t commit turnovers.\", \"The Steelers (6-6-1), conversely, are inept at stopping the run \\u2014 they\\u2019ve allowed an average of 182 rushing yards over the last three games \\u2014 and the offensive line must want Ben Roethlisberger to retire even before the season ends. He has taken eight sacks over the last three games. Those issues, along with Chase Claypool\\u2019s drama over celebrating a first down last week, have the Steelers sprinting toward a rebuild. This game should add another loss to Pittsburgh\\u2019s record. Pick: Titans -1.5\", \"New Orleans Saints at Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 8:20 p.m., NBC\", \"Line: Buccaneers -10.5 | Total: 46.5\", \"Alvin Kamara\\u2019s return last week against the Jets lifted the Saints (6-7), who desperately needed their best offensive weapon after he missed four games with a knee injury. But Kamara will likely find little room to run against the Buccaneers (10-3), who allow the third-fewest rushing yards per game (91.2), have won four straight games and are hitting their stride heading into the final leg of the regular season.\", \"Leonard Fournette has rushed for 100 yards in two of the last three games and asserted himself as a strong complement to the Tom Brady-led passing attack. Richard Sherman has also returned for the first time since October and recorded an interception last week. Pick: Buccaneers -10.5\", \"Washington Football Team vs. Philadelphia Eagles, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Eagles -5 | Total: 44.5\", \"Washington\\u2019s (6-7) loss to Dallas last week essentially locked up the N.F.C. East for the Cowboys, and now the Footballers and Eagles (6-7) can scrap for a potential wild-card spot. Washington quarterback Taylor Heinicke (knee) is expected to play, but Terry McLaurin (concussion), the team\\u2019s leading receiver and best offensive player, potentially could not. That would be a brutal blow, with Washington also contending with a Covid-19 outbreak. The Eagles had an extra week of rest after a bye and should outpace Washington. Pick: Eagles -5\", \"Seattle Seahawks at Los Angeles Rams, 4:25 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Rams -4 | Total: 45\", \"The Rams (9-4) added nine players, including wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., to the Covid-19 list Tuesday after already placing five on the list Monday. With the team in enhanced mitigation protocols, most work is being done remotely, potentially hampering the team's momentum coming off a big Monday night win against the Cardinals.\", \"The Seahawks (5-8), have reported only one positive coronavirus test this season and have won their last two games, including a game in which they allowed over 300 passing yards to the lowly Texans. Doing so against a Sean McVay offense won\\u2019t produce the same result, though. Even with the coronavirus disruptions, the Rams should win. Pick: Rams -4\", \"Carolina Panthers at Buffalo Bills, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Bills -10.5 | Total: 43.5\", \"A slow start doomed them against the Buccaneers last week, but the Bills (7-6) could spot the Panthers (5-8) a touchdown and Carolina would likely still lose this one. No matter their quarterback \\u2014 P.J. Walker and Cam Newton have shared snaps since Sam Darnold went down with an injury \\u2014 the Panthers\\u2019 offense has underwhelmed, averaging only 19.8 points per game. Newton has completed only 58.7 percent of his passes since returning as the starter (yuck).\", \"Josh Allen sprained his left foot and is listed as day-to-day, but even if he doesn\\u2019t play Sunday, the Bills\\u2019 offense is more trustworthy, especially at home in near-freezing temperatures. Pick: Bills -10.5\", \"Jets at Miami Dolphins, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Dolphins -8.5 | Total: 42.5\", \"Don\\u2019t count the Dolphins (6-7) out of the hunt in the wild A.F.C. Their postseason chances are currently teetering at 8 percent, according to the playoff predictor, but if they win out and other teams collapse, there\\u2019s still a possibility. A resurgence of the Dolphins\\u2019 aggressive, blitz-happy defense and efficient play from quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has Miami on a five-game win streak.\", \"The Jets (3-10) have not been as successful without their top two receivers, Elijah Moore (quad) and Corey Davis (core), giving quarterback Zach Wilson few options in the passing game. Three of Miami\\u2019s running backs and safety Jevon Holland were placed on the Covid-19 list, but the Dolphins are still a safer bet to cover. Pick: Dolphins -8.5\", \"Arizona Cardinals at Detroit Lions, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Cardinals -13.5 | Total: 47.5\", \"Inaccurate passes, turnovers, poor clock management. That sounds like a description for a Lions (1-11-1) game, but those aspects defined how the Cardinals (10-3) lost to the Rams in Week 14.\", \"Arizona is still on top of the N.FC. West, but slid to the No. 3 seed in the conference. The team will reportedly rest DeAndre Hopkins (knee) for the rest of the regular season ahead of a playoff push. But quarterback Kyler Murray and the Cardinals should still bounce back Sunday because the Lions rank second-to-last in the league in sacks (20), and worked remotely this week while dealing with a Covid-19 outbreak. Even at 100 percent, Detroit would\\u2019ve been an underdog, but those challenges should make this a rout. Pick: Cardinals -13.5\", \"Dallas Cowboys at Giants, 1 p.m., Fox\", \"Line: Cowboys -10.5 | Total: 44.5\", \"In a shocking reversal, the Cowboys\\u2019 (9-4) offense is now underwhelming while their defense is excelling. Dak Prescott has thrown eight touchdowns and six interceptions in the last six games, a trend that even the team owner Jerry Jones said is \\u201cfair\\u201d to characterize as a slump. Offensive lineman Tyron Smith is out with an ankle injury and running back Ezekiel Elliot is still playing through a knee injury.\", \"Still, Dallas should easily beat the Giants, who will likely be without quarterback Daniel Jones (neck) for a third consecutive game. That should excite Micah Parsons, the versatile linebacker who could add more sacks (he\\u2019s got 12) to his Defensive Rookie of the Year application. Pick: Cowboys -10.5\", \"Houston Texans at Jacksonville Jaguars, 1 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Jaguars -3.5 | 39.5\", \"Both the Jaguars (2-11) and the Texans (2-11) are jostling for draft positioning at this point, and players on those teams who are on expiring contracts are just hoping to put out good tape for potential suitors this off-season. On paper, they may seem evenly matched: Davis Mills, the Texans\\u2019 rookie quarterback, snatched back the starting job by merely not being Tyrod Taylor and the Jaguars\\u2019 Trevor Lawrence is tied for the league lead in interceptions (14).\", \"But Houston is poised for an \\u201cupset\\u201d given the disarray in Jacksonville, amid reports that the first-year N.F.L. coach Urban Meyer has already worn out his locker room welcome. The Jaguars\\u2019 players will be there, technically speaking, but don\\u2019t expect them to show up. Pick: Texans +3.5\", \"Cincinnati Bengals at Denver Broncos, 4:05 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: Broncos -1.5 | Total: 43.5\", \"At this point, we know the Broncos (7-6) are unbearably average and will beat up on bad teams and lose to good ones. The Bengals (7-6) have shown some up-and-down spurts, too, but have displayed more flashes of talent from their young stars as they continue to grow. Cincinnati pushed the 49ers to overtime last week and nearly won, and that momentum should carry over. The Broncos have not put back-to-back wins together since the start of November, and they are due for another potential loss this week. Pick: Bengals +1.5\", \"Atlanta Falcons at San Francisco 49ers, 4:05 p.m., CBS\", \"Line: 49ers -9.5 | Total: 46\", \"The formula is out on beating the Falcons (6-7): Cover Kyle Pitts, contain Cordarrelle Patterson, and when Matt Ryan hangs onto the ball trying to find an option, sack him.\", \"Limiting Patterson is hard, though, as the Falcons continue to force feed their breakout playmaker with so many touches that he\\u2019s tied for the sixth-most touchdowns from scrimmage. The 49ers (7-6) have their own version of Patterson \\u2014 Deebo Samuel \\u2014 and he\\u2019s better. Samuel is tied for fifth in touchdowns from scrimmage (11) and is fifth in total yardage (1,268). He should have fun against Atlanta\\u2019s meager defense. Pick: 49ers -9.5\", \"Minnesota Vikings at Chicago Bears, 8:15 p.m., ESPN\", \"Line: Vikings -4 | Total: 44\", \"The Bears (4-9) no longer deserve prime time games, yet here we are. The offense is horrible, scoring only 17.8 points per game. Justin Fields\\u2019s development has been, well, what you\\u2019d expect from a rookie in a bad situation. He\\u2019s shown strong glimpses, as in the first-half scoring outburst against the Packers last week, but is completing less than 60 percent of his passes.\", \"The Vikings\\u2019 offense is on an upswing in a roller coaster season. Dalvin Cook rushed for over 200 yards last week and Justin Jefferson has caught at least one touchdown in three of the last four weeks. Minnesota (6-7) has struggled with one-score games and allowed inferior opponents to stay competitive, but this should be a good statement game ahead of a playoff push. Pick: Vikings -4\", \"A quick primer for those who are not familiar with betting lines: Favorites are listed next to a negative number that represents how many points they must win by to cover the spread. Raiders -5.5, for example, means that Las Vegas must beat Chicago by at least 6 points for its backers to win their bet. Gamblers can also bet on the total score, or whether the teams\\u2019 combined score in the game is over or under a preselected number of points.\"]","href_hash":"6e257dce5e2e11ec9cb28d0eeae65dee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6e257dce5e2e11ec9cb28d0eeae65dee"}},
