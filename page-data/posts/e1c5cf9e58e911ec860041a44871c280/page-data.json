Theaters have again opened their arms to nunsploitation this month with \\u201cBenedetta,\\u201d Paul Verhoeven\\u2019s latest shocker, and now \\u201cAgnes,\\u201d from the wildly prolific director Mickey Reece \\u2014 it\\u2019s his 18th feature film to come out in the last 10 years.\", \"Unfortunately for Reece, quantity is no indicator of quality; this choppy film has little to say, particularly about cloistered women, despite being named after a possessed sister and dedicating a plotline to an ex-nun.\", \"Though \\u201cAgnes\\u201d opens during a Mass in the convent before introducing its titular character (Hayley McFarland) \\u2014 a satanic sister who reveals her wickedness by cursing and levitating teacups \\u2014 it quickly centers the religious men tasked with exorcising Agnes. Men like the jaded Father Donaghue (Ben Hall), who is soon to be relocated to some faraway country after being accused of child molestation. He warns Benjamin (Jake Horowitz), a priest-in-training just shy of taking his vows, against the lifestyle.\", \"The second act focuses on Agnes\\u2019s friend, Mary (Molly C. Quinn), after she leaves the convent. As she navigates normal life, she connects with Agnes\\u2019s former lover, a comedian named Paul Satchimo (Sean Gunn).\", \"If that all sounds confusing and pointless, that\\u2019s because it mostly is. There is a clear through line of faithlessness in the script by Reece and John Selvidge, but it is otherwise so aimless and underdeveloped as to turn this 93-minute film into a plodding slog. (If you\\u2019re expecting to learn anything substantial about Agnes herself, for instance, you won\\u2019t.) Couple that with erratic editing and endless horror clich\\u00e9s and you have a boring movie that, like its titular character, causes some bloodshed but for the most part does absolutely nothing at all.\"]","href_hash":"e1c5cf9e58e911ec860041a44871c280"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e1c5cf9e58e911ec860041a44871c280"}},
