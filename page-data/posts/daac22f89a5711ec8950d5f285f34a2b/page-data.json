Hankison is charged with endangering Napper, her 5-year-old son and her boyfriend, Cody Etherton, while his fellow officers exchanged gunfire with Taylor's boyfriend during the raid next door.\", \"Hankison was fired by police for shooting \\\"blindly\\\" during the raid on March 13, 2020. He fired 10 shots, none of which hit Taylor or Walker. No police were charged in the Black woman's death.\", \"Walker told investigators that he had fired a single shot with a handgun because he thought intruders were breaking in. Walker's bullet hit Mattingly in the leg, and Mattingly and another officer, Myles Cosgrove, opened fire in response, killing Taylor.\", \"Hankison told investigators about two weeks after the raid that he had looked inside once officers broke open Taylor's door and thought he saw \\\"a figure in a shooting stance\\\" with a long gun or AR-15 rifle. His lawyer said Hankison then backed away, rounded a corner and fired shots through Taylor's sliding glass door and bedroom window to \\\"defend and save the lives of his fellow officers.\\\"\", \"No long rifle was found in the apartment, only Walker's handgun.\", \"During opening statements, prosecutors emphasized to jurors that the case is not about the killing of Taylor or police decisions that led to the raid. They said the focus should be on Hankison's shots and the harm they caused.\"]","href_hash":"daac22f89a5711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"daac22f89a5711ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
