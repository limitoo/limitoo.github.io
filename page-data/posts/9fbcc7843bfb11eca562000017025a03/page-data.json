In most school districts, the review and selection of individual library materials traditionally has been an administrative responsibility managed by professional district staff.\\\"\", \"It adds: \\\"Of course, school board trustees care deeply about parent concerns and community input. That's why local school boards have policies and processes in place for parents to express their concerns about any matter affecting their local school community\\u2014including the challenge of library materials.\\\"\", \"Abbott's letter comes after state Rep. Matt Krause, a Republican who chairs the House General Investigating Committee, informed the Texas Education Agency and some Texas school superintendents that he is \\\"initiating an inquiry into Texas school district content.\\\"\", \"In his letter, first reported by The Texas Tribune in October, Krause provided school officials with a 16-page list of about 850 books, and asked them to inform the committee of how many copies of the books they possess, where the books are located and how much they were bought for.\", \"Included in the list are acclaimed novels such as the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Confessions of Nat Turner by William Styron and the graphic novel version of The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood.\", \"Other books on the list cover topics such as teenage pregnancy, abortion, sexuality and racism. Titles by Black writers include Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates and How to Be an Antiracist by Ibram X. Kendi.\", \"Krause, who is running for Texas attorney general, also demanded school districts identify \\\"any other books\\\" containing material that could make students \\\"feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other form of psychological distress because of their race or sex or convey that a student, by virtue of their race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously.\\\"\", \"He gave officials until November 12 to respond, but did not say why he wanted the information or specify the consequences for not complying.\", \"Earlier this year, Abbott signed a bill into law that is aimed at banning the teaching of critical race theory, an academic framework examining history through the lens of racism that has become a political flashpoint in the debate about how race and racism should be taught in schools.\", \"Ovidia Molina, the president of the Texas State Teachers Association, said nothing in that law gives Krause the authority \\\"to conduct this type of witch hunt.\\\"\", \"\\\"Rep. Krause's letter demanding that school superintendents provide him with lists of books dealing with certain subjects on their school bookshelves is disturbing and political overreach into the classroom,\\\" Molina said. \\\"What will Rep. Krause propose next? Burning books he and a handful of parents find objectionable?\\\"\", \"Abbott and Krause have been contacted for further comment.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1924467/texas-governor-greg-abbott-speaks.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Texas Governor Greg Abbott speaks during the Houston Region Business Coalition's monthly meeting on October 27, 2021 in Houston, Texas.</div>\"]","href_hash":"9fbcc7843bfb11eca562000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9fbcc7843bfb11eca562000017025a03"}},
