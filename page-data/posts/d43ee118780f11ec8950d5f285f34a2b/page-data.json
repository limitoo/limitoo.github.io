Others are in a pre-epidemic phase.\", \"This season, France has so far recorded 72 serious cases of flu, with six deaths.\", \"DOMINANT STRAIN\", \"Further complicating matters, the dominant flu strain circulating this year appears so far to be the H3 of the A virus, which usually causes the most severe cases among the elderly.\", \"Penttinen said it was too early to make a final assessment of flu vaccines because a larger number of ill patients was needed for real-world analyses. But lab tests show the vaccines available this year \\\"are not going to be optimal\\\" against H3.\", \"That is largely because there was very little or no virus circulating when the vaccines' composition was decided last year, making it harder for vaccine makers to predict which strain would be dominant in the coming flu season.\", \"Vaccines Europe, which represents top vaccine makers in the region, acknowledged the strain selection was made more difficult by very low flu circulation last year, but added there was not enough data yet to assess the effectiveness of this season's shots.\", \"Flu vaccines are adapted every year to make them as effective as possible against ever-changing flu viruses. Their composition is decided six months before the flu season kicks in, based on circulation of viruses in the opposite hemisphere. That gives time for drugmakers to develop and make the shots.\", \"Europe-wide data on flu vaccine uptake is not yet available. But national figures for France show coverage is not as broad as authorities hoped for.\", \"The authorities there extended by one month the vaccination period to the end of February to boost inoculations. According to figures released last week, 12 million people have so far been vaccinated, about 45 percent of the targeted population.\", \"\\\"There is still a large room for improvement to limit the impact of the flu epidemic,\\\" the health ministry said in a statement on Jan. 11. This year's target is to vaccinate percent of people at risk.\", \"Vaccines Europe said the industry had supplied large numbers of flu shots, despite the strain on production facilities posed by the pandemic.\"]","href_hash":"d43ee118780f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d43ee118780f11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
