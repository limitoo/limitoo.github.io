Then I let other people decide what they think.\\u201d\", \"In September, Medvedev, 25, of Russia, served as the ultimate spoiler when he upset the world No. 1, Novak Djokovic, 6-4, 6-4, 6-4 to win his first major at the U.S. Open. Djokovic had already won the Australian and French Opens and Wimbledon in 2021, and a win at the U.S. Open would have made him just the sixth singles player, and third man, to capture the Grand Slam. Medvedev\\u2019s win also denied Djokovic a record-breaking 21st career major. Instead, he, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal are still tied with 20 majors apiece.\", \"\\u201cHe has definitely improved a lot, and the Grand Slam win at the U.S. Open did not come as a surprise to me,\\u201d Djokovic said. \\u201cHe has a tremendous serve, and he hits his spots in the box incredibly well. That\\u2019s the biggest weapon of his game, without a doubt.\", \"\\u201cThen, of course, that backhand is very flat, and he\\u2019s just as strong as a wall from that side,\\u201d Djokovic added. \\u201cHe just doesn\\u2019t miss. And he\\u2019s improved his forehand a lot. He\\u2019s very professional and very smart on the court. He\\u2019s game savvy. He understands how to use the court, how to position himself when he\\u2019s defending, when he\\u2019s attacking. His net game has improved as well, so he doesn\\u2019t hesitate to come forward. Nowadays he\\u2019s become a more all-around player, more complete and, as a result, he\\u2019s a Grand Slam champion.\\u201d\", \"Medvedev is trying to defend his championship at the season-ending Nitto ATP Finals, which begins Sunday and has moved from London to Turin, Italy, this year. Last year, Medvedev beat Alexander Zverev, Djokovic, Diego Schwartzman, Nadal and Dominic Thiem to capture the title.\", \"When Medvedev first ascended to No. 2 in March, it was, in large part, because he won his last 10 matches of 2020 and his first 10 of 2021. He was finally stopped by Djokovic in the Australian Open final in February.\", \"\\u201cDaniil has perfected the game that he\\u2019s playing that not many players can play,\\u201d said the fourth-ranked Stefanos Tsitsipas, who has lost to Medvedev six of the eight times they have played. \\u201cI call him \\u2018octopus\\u2019 for a reason. He\\u2019s just able to get balls that not many people are able to.\\u201d\", \"It is odd, then, that Medvedev constantly refers to his flagging self confidence.\", \"\\u201cThere was a moment when I was not confident in myself,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI was doubting a few things about my physical abilities, my tennis abilities. I was in doubt, which is what tennis is all about. Then I won these two amazing tournaments [2020 Rolex Paris Masters and Nitto ATP Finals], beat a lot of top players, got a boost of confidence where I was like, \\u2018OK, I believe in myself. There is no reason not to believe anymore.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Medvedev was never a prodigy. He was not ranked No. 1 in the juniors, never even went beyond the third round at any of the major junior tournaments. But that did not stop him from aspiring to play among the best.\", \"\\u201cI was never even in the quarters of a slam,\\u201d Medvedev said. \\u201cBut when you come to these Grand Slams, no matter if you\\u2019re ranked 30, 20 or I think I was 13 at the max, you see all these top players that you look at on TV and they actually do normal things. They eat, they take a shower, they go play matches, they can even laugh with you juniors. And you actually feel in a way that you belong with this group.\\u201d\", \"Before Medvedev ever played tennis, he said he was known in the family for his temper tantrums around the house. His two older sisters, Julia and Elena, were powerless to control him.\", \"\\u201cI remember when I was 4 years old, I was a little bit \\u2018wanty,\\u2019\\u201d Medvedev said with a chuckle. \\u201cLike if I wanted something I could start crying. I think that\\u2019s the part that could sometimes show on the tennis court, especially when I was younger, because the thing is, what do you want on the tennis court? You want to win.\\u201d\", \"Medevedev has proved his petulance more than once in his pro career. In 2016, he was defaulted from a Challenger match in Savannah, Ga., for suggesting that the chair umpire was favoring his opponent based on race.\", \"Then, during the 2019 U.S. Open, Medvedev was booed by the New York crowd during a match against Feliciano Lopez when he got a warning from the umpire for tossing his racket and then snatching a towel from a ball man. As the fans roared their disapproval, Medvedev tugged on his ear, imploring them to continue.\", \"Then, during his post-match interview, Medvedev told the crowd: \\u201cThank you all, guys, because your energy tonight gave me the win. If you were not here, guys, I would probably lose the match. So I want all of you to know, when you sleep tonight, I won because of you.\\u201d\", \"The crowd responded by booing even louder. Medvedev won his next three matches before he was beaten by Nadal in the final.\", \"Just before the start of the Paris Masters in October, Medvedev and Djokovic had a two-hour practice session at the Mouratoglou Academy on the French Riviera. It was the first time the two had seen each other since their U.S. Open final in September. They chatted for 15 minutes after the practice, but neither one mentioned their encounter in New York.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s normal, no matter if you lose or win you don\\u2019t speak about these matches because there\\u2019s going to be one loser who\\u2019s not going to want to speak about it,\\u201d said Medvedev, who also lost to Djokovic last Sunday in the final of the Paris Masters. \\u201cAnd when I win I also don\\u2019t want to say, \\u2018Hey, remember \\u2026\\u2019\\u201d\", \"When Medvedev was about 14, he said, he read the book \\u201cEragon\\u201d by Christopher Paolini. He was so captivated by the fantastical story about magic, glory and power that he read all 528 pages in three nights, at the same time imagining he was part of that world.\", \"Now that he is enmeshed in his own fantastical world, Medvedev refuses to revel in it.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t look back too much in my life,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI like to think about the present and the future more than the past, even if the past is good. I use it more as confidence, to say, \\u2018Wow, I managed to win, to beat Novak in the final of a slam.\\u2019 I\\u2019m going to use it more if I have doubt in my career, which can happen.\", \"\\u201cIf you lose first round or quarters of some tournaments, maybe two in a row, you\\u2019re always going to have questions, like \\u2018Am I going to be able to come back?\\u2019 That\\u2019s when you can look back at this match and say to yourself, \\u2018Wow, it\\u2019s possible.\\u2019\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"0967d39843c911ecaf0561449bd9cf69"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0967d39843c911ecaf0561449bd9cf69"}},
