For Australian curlers Tahli Gill and Dean Hewitt, the first Australians to qualify for the Olympic sport, their drama began just after midnight on Saturday when their JL8681 flight from Tokyo touched down in Beijing.\", \"They were met by more PPE-clad security staff than there were passengers on their plane.\", \"The immigration process was further delayed by the need to first have another COVID test, despite already showing proof of two negative tests in the three days before flying.\", \"The Beijing airport test is fast, efficient\\u00a0and a little brutal. It feels like they are scraping not just inside your nose for any evidence of the virus, but prodding up into your brain to search the dark corners for hiding COVID fragments intent on sneaking into the Olympics and ruining the Games.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/aa80afe696f5f3b51b9f85b4ae3ae74d\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Tahli Gill tested positive, but said the AOC's processes kept things calm.(WCF:\\u00a0Steve Seixeiro)</div>\", \"Hewitt was fine.
