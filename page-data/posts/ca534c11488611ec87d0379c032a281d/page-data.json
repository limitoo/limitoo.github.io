Until, that is, you consider the comparatively low number of documentaries about women in rock and pop, especially focusing on the creation of a record. Just look at how few female musicians are represented in the long-running documentary series \\u201cClassic Albums.\\u201d\", \"Kudos, then, to the director Alison Klayman for getting \\u201cJagged\\u201d done in the first place.\", \"It kicks off with Morissette\\u2019s start as a teen sensation in the 1980s and tracks her transformation into a generation\\u2019s electrifying bard. Klayman (\\u201cThe Brink\\u201d) is at her best illustrating Morissette\\u2019s candid, thoughtful reminiscences with period footage, and documenting the wild year that followed the release of \\u201cJagged Little Pill,\\u201d when the newly minted star toured nonstop, backed by male bandmates who now semi-sheepishly confess to preying on the girls and young women flocking to the concerts.

Taken together, they paint an unsettling portrait of the structural and behavioral sexism pervasive in the music world \\u2014 a former radio program director interviewed in \\u201cJagged\\u201d remarks, for example, that \\u201cit was regarded as a no-no to play female artists back to back.\\u201d\", \"This makes the vision of Morissette reclaiming her life and art in great, powerful yelps while pacing arena stages in baggy T-shirts all the more thrilling: We know the cost.\"]","href_hash":"ca534c11488611ec87d0379c032a281d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ca534c11488611ec87d0379c032a281d"}},
