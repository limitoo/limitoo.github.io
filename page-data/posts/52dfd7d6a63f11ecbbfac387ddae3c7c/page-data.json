As protesters gathered outside the office where he was stationed in Dresden, in East Germany, Putin was told Moscow was silent.\", \"Putin \\\"went from being a member of the most powerful organization, living the good life in East Germany, to somebody who was completely helpless, defending that position. I think that left a deep impression on him and it motivated him to rebuild \\u2014 not necessarily the Soviet Union, but greater Russia. This is what he is after,\\\" Barsky said.\", \"Barsky told CBS News that in other wars, Putin sought to escalate the conflict \\u2014 and if the pattern holds, will go after more civilian targets.\", \"\\\"He doesn't really care as much for the suffering of the Russian people. He's lashing out against his own people,\\\" Barsky said.\", \"The Russian leader has \\\"a tight grip on power,\\\" Barksy said. \\\"As long as he satisfies his inner circle \\u2014 the folks that are directly supporting him \\u2014 he doesn't have much to fear.\\\"\", \"While a military revolt could be a potential long-term scenario, Barsky said, right now \\\"he is very well protected.\\\"\", \"\\\"Assuming that he can survive this, assuming there isn't a sort of coup against him \\u2014 so long term, he'll be in trouble if this keeps going like this, if more soldiers keep dying. He'll have an Afghanistan on his hands,\\\" said Barsky. Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in late 1979, toppling the Afghan leader and kicking off a nearly decade-long conflict with the mujahideen. \\\"And as you know, Afghanistan was the beginning of the end of the Soviet Union \\u2014 and Ukraine may become the beginning of the end of Putin as a dictator.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"52dfd7d6a63f11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"52dfd7d6a63f11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
