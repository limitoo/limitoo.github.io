Instead, speak to a member of your wh\\u0101nau or your local iwi or M\\u0101ori Health Provider.

That doesn't mean you're not going to use contraception or a seatbelt.\", \"\\\"The vaccine is not a cure. It's a layer of protection - up to 95 percent and protects you from getting severe symptoms from the virus so that you don't die.\", \"\\\"It also reduces the risk of spreading the virus so that other people you care about don't die.\", \"\\\"Unfortunately, we have seen from this latest outbreak how quickly this virus has spread within our region, and we need our population to get vaccinated before our borders open.\\\"\", \"Northland's vaccination rate is sitting at 84 percent for first doses and 75 percent for second doses.
