Hours later, the C.D.C. followed suit.\", \"The moves simplify eligibility, fulfill a pledge by President Biden to offer the shots to every American adult and formalize what is already happening in at least 10 states.\", \"But many experts are skeptical that boosters can turn the tide on coronavirus cases, in part because the shots aren\\u2019t getting to the vulnerable people who need them most. More than 85 percent of the adult population is already eligible for an extra dose, but only about 17 percent has chosen to get one. \", \"Coronavirus infections are inching up again, particularly in colder parts of the country. Roughly 100 million Americans have yet to receive a single dose of the coronavirus vaccine. And holiday travel \\u2014 which officials expect to approach 2019 levels \\u2014 could send cases skyrocketing, as it did last year.\", \"Still, most public health experts agree that it\\u2019s OK to make Thanksgiving and other holiday plans with your favorite people, as long as you\\u2019re taking precautions.

Here are a few tips:\", \"For all families, here are more suggestions and precautions for the holiday:\", \"In Opinion: Emily Esfahani Smith, a doctoral student in clinical psychology, offered reflections on hard conversations. \\u201cIt\\u2019s possible to navigate this year\\u2019s unique holiday conflicts gracefully,\\u201d she argues. \\u201cDoing so requires understanding what\\u2019s really driving family tension this year, both political and personal.\\u201d\", \"More than 100 people wrote in to share their plans, excitements and strategies for the holiday. Here are a few ways you\\u2019re all celebrating this year:\", \"Barbara Sloan, who lives in Conway, S.C., will be dining with her brother and his wife. \\u201cThis is better than last year, when I spent every holiday alone at home, as did everyone else,\\u201d Barbara wrote. \\u201cIt\\u2019s not the food, but the company that matters. As we get older, it feels more important to see each other more often.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis year, my husband and I dropped a truth bomb that we weren\\u2019t attending any Thanksgiving activities with unvaccinated people,\\u201d Ethan Zachery Scott, who lives in Los Angeles, wrote. \\u201cThat quickly alienated us from almost every family event. Instead, we\\u2019re spending the day with close friends and going to see \\u2018House of Gucci.\\u2019 Honestly, this is probably the best outcome I could have asked for!\\u201d\", \"Aniyah Zachery, 13, lives in San Francisco. \\u201cWith everything that\\u2019s been going on these past years, I haven\\u2019t gotten to see my family a lot,\\u201d Aniyah wrote. \\u201cThis year, family members of mine with the vaccination will be able to attend our Covid-safe dinner.\\u201d Aniyah added: \\u201cNot only will I be able to reunite with my family, but I will also be able to fill it with love, joy and laughter.\\u201d\", \"Not all the kids in Gwen K.\\u2019s family are old enough to be vaccinated, and some have not yet received both doses. \\u201cSo this year, after our annual Thanksgiving football game with friends, our family is gathering at noon (hopefully the warmest part of the day) outdoors for a modified meal,\\u201d wrote Gwen, who lives in Haverford, Pa. \\u201cWe are serving turkey sandwiches.\\u201d\", \"This year, Cathy, who lives in Vancouver, Wash., plans to have a meal, maybe with some at-home Covid tests as an appetizer. \\u201cI\\u2019m not even asking who is vaccinated,\\u201d wrote Cathy, who is fully vaccinated and got a booster. \\u201cI figure everyone who wants the shot has gotten it, and each can make their own decisions about risks of gathering.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cLast year I got Mexican takeout and watched the sunset from beach chairs on the beach in San Diego with a friend,\\u201d Sarah Mearon wrote. \\u201cThe rolled tacos were great, but I\\u2019m looking forward to a hone-cooked meal this year.\\u201d\", \"Christine Owens, a teacher who lives in St. Johnsbury, Vt., is on the fence about whether to fly down to Virginia to see her brother and his family. \\u201cShould I risk the health of my family to travel for a meal with 15-plus family and friends from all over the country?\\u201d Christine wondered. \\u201cI asked my brother if he was asking guests about vaccines or getting tested before traveling.
