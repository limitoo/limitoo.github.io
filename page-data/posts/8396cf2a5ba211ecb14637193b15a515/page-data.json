So he went to the C-team players and got that,\\\" Christie added.\", \"The former Republican governor said that the January 6 committee's investigation will eventually reveal the facts relevant to the Capitol attack, but he added, \\\"Let's not kid ourselves.

But what I will say is this: When I ran for re-election in 2013, I got 60% of the vote. When he ran for re-election, he lost to Joe Biden.\\\"\", \"The former governor supported Trump and his policies and said that he voted for him in the 2016 and 2020 elections.
