One woman alleged Watson forced her to perform oral sex.\\u00a0Eight of the women who sued Watson filed criminal complaints against him with Houston police and appeared before the grand jury. Two other women who didn't sue Watson also filed police complaints. The FBI also had been reviewing the allegations.\", \"\\u00a0Watson and his lawyers have denied the accusations. His lawyers have said \\\"some sexual activity\\\" happened during some of the massage appointments but that he never coerced anyone. They have sought to balance their defense of the NFL star while simultaneously condemning sexual violence against women.\\u00a0Watson's attorneys have called the lawsuits against him a \\\"money grab\\\" and claimed that all 22 women who filed suits are lying \\u2014 a strategy some experts and advocates say relies on long-used tropes designed to minimize such accusations. The 22 women are being represented by Tony Buzbee, who has said some of his clients have faced criticism and even death threats.\\u00a0Even before the lawsuits were filed in March 2021, Watson had asked to be traded. The trade request and the lawsuits kept Watson out all last season. The Texans were expected to try and trade Watson this offseason.\", \"The civil case against Watson will continue as attorneys for the 22 women have begun questioning him during depositions that are part of the lawsuits. Most of the women have already been deposed by Watson's attorneys. No trial date has been set for the lawsuits.\"]","href_hash":"ca1dd8b8a18811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ca1dd8b8a18811ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
