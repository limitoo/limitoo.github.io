It would be the first major city to have fallen to Russian forces since the 24 February invasion.\", \"\\\"The situation is very difficult\\\" in Mariupol, President Volodymyr Zelensky told the Ukrainska Pravda news portal.\", \"\\\"Our soldiers are blocked, the wounded are blocked. There is a humanitarian crisis ... Nevertheless, the guys are defending themselves.\\\"\", \"As Russia launched more long-range attacks following the sinking of its Black Sea fleet's flagship, Moscow said its warplanes had struck a tank repair factory in Kyiv. An explosion was heard and smoke rose over the south-eastern Darnytskyi district. The mayor said at least one person was killed and medics were fighting to save others.\", \"Also targeted was the Ukrainian factory near Kyiv which made the Neptune anti-ship missiles that sank the flagship on Thursday.\", \"The Ukrainian military said Russian warplanes that took off from Belarus had fired missiles at the Lviv region near the Polish border and four cruise missiles were shot down by Ukrainian air defences.\", \"The western city has been relatively unscathed so far and serves as a haven for refugees and international aid agencies.\", \"In the port city of Mariupol, Reuters journalists in Russian-held districts reached the Ilyich steelworks, one of two metals plants where defenders have held out in underground tunnels and bunkers. Moscow claimed to have captured it on Friday.\", \"The factory was reduced to a ruin of twisted steel and blasted concrete, with no sign of defenders present. Several bodies of civilians lay scattered on nearby streets, including a woman in a pink parka and white shoes.\", \"Someone had spraypainted \\\"mined\\\" on a fence by an obliterated filling station. In a rare sign of life, one red car drove slowly down an otherwise empty street, the word \\\"children\\\" scrawled on a card taped to the windshield.\", \"The Russian defence ministry said its troops had \\\"completely cleared\\\" Mariupol's urban area of Ukrainian forces and blockaded the \\\"remnants\\\" in the Azovstal steelworks, RIA news agency said. It said that as of Saturday, Ukrainian forces in the city had lost more than 4,000 people, RIA added.\", \"Speaking in an online address, Zelensky accused Russia of trying to wipe out the city's inhabitants but did not address Moscow's claim that its troops had cleared the entire urban area of Mariupol of Ukrainian forces.\", \"\\\"There's a huge humanitarian crisis; there's a lack of food, of water, of medicine - however the guys are heroically defending themselves. We're grateful to them for that, but gratitude is not enough so other plans and negotiation processes are being developed.\\\"\", \"Zelensky said peace talks would stop if Russia killed Mariupol's remaining defenders.\", \"The governor of Kharkiv province in the east said at least one person had been killed and 18 were injured in a missile strike.\", \"Smoke billowed from burning cars and the remains of what appeared to be an office building at the scene of an attack in the city as rescuers cleared mounds of debris that blocked the road outside.\", \"In Mykolaiv, a city close to the southern front, Russia said it had struck a military vehicle repair factory.\", \"The attacks followed Russia's announcement on Friday that it would intensify long-range strikes in retaliation for unspecified acts of \\\"sabotage\\\" and \\\"terrorism\\\", hours after it confirmed the sinking of its Black Sea flagship, the Moskva.\", \"Kyiv and Washington say the ship, whose sinking has become a symbol of Ukrainian defiance, was hit by Ukrainian missiles. Moscow says it sank after a fire and that its crew of around 500 were evacuated.\", \"Russia's Defence Ministry published video of the head of the navy, Admiral Nikolai Yevmenov, meeting on a parade ground with about a hundred sailors it said were members of the crew.\", \"A month and a half into President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, Russia is trying to capture territory in the south and east after withdrawing from the north following an assault on Kyiv that was repelled at the capital's outskirts.\", \"The New York Times reports some attacks are weakening Ukraine's ability to withstand Russian tanks in the coming big battle in its east, on open plains.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/291727/eight_col_000_328F3ZR.jpg?1650146119\\\" alt=\\\"A woman examines the debris of her destroyed house in the village of Rusaniv, in the Kyiv region on 16 April.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nA woman examines the debris of her destroyed house in the village of Rusaniv, in the Kyiv region. \\nPhoto: AFP or licensors\\n</div>\", \"Russian troops that pulled out of the north left behind towns littered with bodies of civilians, evidence of what US President Joe Biden this week called genocide - an attempt to erase Ukrainian national identity.\", \"Russia denies targeting civilians and says the aim of its \\\"special military operation\\\" is to disarm its neighbour, defeat nationalists and protect separatists in the southeast.\", \"If Mariupol falls it would be Russia's biggest prize of the war so far.

He did not give evidence for the assertion.\", \"Last month, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia would resort to nuclear weapons only in the case of a \\\"threat to the existence\\\" of the country - and not as a result of the Ukraine conflict.\", \"An advisor to Zelensky said the country needed a swifter supply of weapons from its European Union partners.\", \"\\\"Ukraine needs weapons. Not in a month. Now,\\\" Mykhailo Podolyak said in a Twitter post.\", \"The Russian defence ministry said its anti-aircraft systems in the Odesa region shot down a Ukrainian transport plane delivering weapons supplied by Western governments.
