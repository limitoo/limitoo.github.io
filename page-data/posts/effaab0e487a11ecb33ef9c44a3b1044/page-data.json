When it completes its circuit, the departed souls from the previous age return in new forms.\", \"This is the cosmology of Amazon Prime Video\\u2019s new fantasy spectacle, \\u201cThe Wheel of Time,\\u201d hence the title. It\\u2019s also a philosophy of TV programming, in which the old inexorably becomes new again. \\u201cGame of Thrones\\u201d left this mortal plane in 2019, and it is not far-fetched to assume that Amazon hopes \\u201cWheel,\\u201d whose first three episodes debut Friday, is its second coming.\", \"Here is where I need to pre-empt readers of the fantasy novels the series is based on. (Review a fantasy-saga adaptation and you will inevitably need to deal with the readers.) Robert Jordan\\u2019s cycle of 14 novels (plus supplemental reading) began years before the George R.R. Martin books that were the basis of \\u201cGame of Thrones.\\u201d And both Jordan and Martin were following, or responding to, the likes of J.R.R. Tolkien\\u2019s \\u201cThe Lord of the Rings.\\u201d (To complete the circle, or re-spin the wheel, Amazon will also have a \\u201cRings\\u201d series next year.)\", \"But as a TV adaptation, \\u201cThe Wheel of Time\\u201d sure looks as if it wouldn\\u2019t mind your confusing it with \\u201cThrones,\\u201d right down to the opening credits with their circular Ouroboros-like logo, not unlike the emblem in the \\u201cThrones\\u201d credits.\", \"The good news for fantasy-hungry viewers is that this lush and ambitious series quickly approaches \\u201cThrones,\\u201d and even Peter Jackson\\u2019s Tolkien films, in grandeur and polish. It\\u2019s in the verve of life and depth of character that \\u201cWheel\\u201d is a few revolutions behind.\", \"Vast series like Jordan\\u2019s (which was completed by Brandon Sanderson after Jordan\\u2019s death in 2007) can be quagmires to adapt; an abortive pilot aired like a thief in the night on FXX in 2015. This new attempt, developed by Rafe Judkins, hints at a mammoth world and mythology to be built out, based on a mix-match of eastern and western philosophies and aesthetics.\", \"But it begins simply and approachably, in what you could call Modified Frodo\\u2019s Quest Mode: There\\u2019s a prophecy, a wizard, a band of ordinary folk swept up in history, a perilous journey, a shadowy foe and talk of a decisive final battle.\", \"The Gandalfian figure here is Moiraine (Rosamund Pike) of the Aes Sedai, an all-female order of enchanters who weave smoky strands of magic. She turns up in Two Rivers, a region nestled amid \\u201cSound of Music\\u201d mountains, because the auguries say that one of the local young people is the incarnation of the Dragon, an epochal figure who appears at the end of each age.\", \"The twist: She doesn\\u2019t know who it is. When an army of trollocs \\u2014 beast-faced minions of the unseen Dark One \\u2014 show up to unleash Dungeons & Dragons havoc, she flees Two Rivers with her swordsman-sidekick, Lan (Daniel Henney), and a gaggle of potential reluctant saviors.\", \"Their journey to the Aes Sedai stronghold, which takes up much of the six episodes screened for critics (of eight in the first season), give us time to take in the scenery and get to know the characters.\", \"The former is splendid. Scene after painterly scene looks like the lavish cover of a 1980s fantasy paperback. The latter are mostly bland stock types, especially the young Dragons-in-waiting.\", \"Rand (Josha Stradowski) is a moony, earnest shepherd boy smitten with Egwene (Madeleine Madden), the empathetic apprentice to the village healer, Nynaeve (Zo\\u00eb Robins). The blacksmith Perrin (Marcus Rutherford) is a gentle giant; Mat (Barney Harris) is a cynic with a sad past and a knack for trouble. Two of the more distinctive performances come from antagonists: \\u00c1lvaro Morte (\\u201cMoney Heist\\u201d) as an uprising\\u2019s leader and Abdul Salis as an inquisitor for a band of religious fanatics who oppose the Aes Sedai.\", \"The series\\u2019s dramatic drive comes from Pike, who gives Moiraine a burdened gravity and fearsomeness. But she\\u2019s too often saddled with Fairport Convention lyrics like \\u201cThe Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,\\u201d and try saying that 10 times fast.\", \"The ideas behind \\u201cWheel\\u201d do have potential. Its worldview is not as realpolitik as that of \\u201cThrones,\\u201d but its concept of good and evil is promisingly complicated.\", \"The Aes Sedai, for instance, are high-minded but ruthless, riven by internal politics and not to be trusted even by one another. There are doubts about whether the prophesied Dragon will be the salvation or the ruin of the world. Even some followers of the Dark One \\u2014 so far, a vague offscreen threat \\u2014 believe that their master means to do good by breaking a historical cycle of suffering.\", \"The series\\u2019s gender dynamic may be its most thinkpiece-friendly feature. Women control magic in the world of \\u201cWheel\\u201d for historical-mythological reasons \\u2014 something-something about the One Power being tainted in a way that afflicts males who try to use it \\u2014 which in turn leads some men to resentment or fear of being superfluous.\", \"It is a provocative premise, though it\\u2019s not clear what, if anything, \\u201cWheel\\u201d is trying to say with it. In general, the show\\u2019s long game \\u2014 that is, why you should care enough to commit \\u2014 is elusive, even as it strings episodes together with matinee-serial cliffhangers. Somehow it manages to feel fast-paced and static at the same time.\", \"\\u201cWheel\\u201d does have time to develop; it has already been picked up for a second season. What it lacks is a voice. Or rather it has one, but it\\u2019s the stiff New Agey dialect of generic high fantasy. Maybe this is a carry-over of Jordan\\u2019s ponderous prose; maybe it\\u2019s the effect of too much cautious respect for the source material. But listening to one character after another hold forth on the turnings of the Wheel, I longed for a Gollum or an Arya Stark to kick some life into the works.\", \"From its opening minutes, \\u201cThe Wheel of Time\\u201d is epic in scale. But deep into its first season, it is not yet human in scale. It\\u2019s pretty to look at, though. Early on, the wanderers take refuge in a cursed city, its deserted streets lined with baroque architecture and statuary. \\u201cWheel,\\u201d as a production, feels like that. It\\u2019s a breathtakingly detailed edifice with no people in it.\"]","href_hash":"effaab0e487a11ecb33ef9c44a3b1044"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"effaab0e487a11ecb33ef9c44a3b1044"}},
