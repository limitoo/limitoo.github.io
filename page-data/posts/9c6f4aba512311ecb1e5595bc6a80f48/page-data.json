SARS-CoV-2.","country":"au","create_time":"2021-11-29T14:50:12.000Z","content":"[\"The Omicron coronavirus variant is likely to spread internationally, posing a \\\"very high\\\" global risk of infection surges that could have \\\"severe consequences\\\" in some areas, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Monday.\", \"The UN agency urged its 194 member states to accelerate vaccination of high-priority groups and, in anticipation of increased case numbers, to \\\"ensure mitigation plans are in place\\\" to maintain essential health services.\", \"\\\"Omicron has an unprecedented number of spike mutations, some of which are concerning for their potential impact on the trajectory of the pandemic,\\\" the WHO said.\", \"To date, no deaths linked to Omicron had been reported, though further research was needed to assess Omicron's potential to escape protection against immunity induced by vaccines and previous infections, it said.\", \"\\\"Increasing cases, regardless of a change in severity, may pose overwhelming demands on health care systems and may lead to increased morbidity and mortality.\", \"\\\"The impact on vulnerable populations would be substantial, particularly in countries with low vaccination coverage,\\\" it said.\\u00a0\", \"More data is expected in the coming weeks.\\u00a0\", \"<img

variant?</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Cases identified in Portugal\\u00a0</div>\", \"Meanwhile, Portuguese health authorities say\\u00a0they have identified 13 cases of Omicron, the new coronavirus variant believed to be more contagious, among team members of a professional soccer club.\", \"The Ricardo Jorge National Health Institute said one of those who tested positive at the Lisbon-based Belenenses soccer club had recently travelled to South Africa, where the Omicron variant was first identified.\", \"The others, however, had not travelled to South Africa, indicating that this may be one of the very first cases of local transmission of the virus outside of southern Africa.\\u00a0\", \"Those who have been in contact with the positive cases have been ordered to isolate, regardless of their vaccination status or their exposure to possible contagion, and will be regularly tested for COVID-19, the institute said.\", \"Portugal has one of the highest rates of vaccination in the world.\", \"The variant was identified days ago by researchers in South Africa\\u00a0and much about it is still unclear, including whether it is more contagious, more likely to cause serious illness or more able to evade the protection of vaccines.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Japan becomes latest country to shut borders</div>\", \"As cases of a new coronavirus variant are confirmed around the world, Japan announced\\u00a0it will suspend entry of all foreign visitors, joining an increasing number of countries that are tightening their borders as fear spreads of yet another extension of pandemic suffering.\\u00a0\", \"Japan, which has yet to detect any Omicron cases,\\u00a0reimposed border controls that it eased earlier this month for short-term business visitors, foreign students and workers.\", \"Japan has kept its border closed to foreign tourists from all nations.\", \"Mr Kishida urged people to continue wearing masks and pursuing other basic anti-virus measures until further details of the new Omicron variant are known.\\u00a0\", \"Despite the global worry, however, scientists cautioned that it is still unclear whether Omicron is more dangerous than other versions of a virus that has killed more than 5 million people.\", \"Some countries are continuing with previous plans to loosen restrictions, with signs of reopening in Malaysia, Singapore and New Zealand.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Omicron cases reported in Scotland, the Netherlands, Canada</div>\", \"Israel decided to bar entry to foreigners\\u00a0and Morocco said it would suspend all incoming flights for two weeks\\u00a0\\u2014 among the most drastic of the growing raft of travel curbs being imposed by nations around the world as they scrambled to slow the variant's spread.\", \"Scientists in several places\\u00a0\\u2014 from Hong Kong to Europe to North America \\u2014 confirmed its presence.\", \"The Scottish government announced the discovery of six new cases of the Omicron variant of coronavirus, taking the UK\\u00a0total to nine.\", \"It has asked public health authorities to undertake enhanced contact tracing in all cases.\", \"Over the weekend, British health authorities found three cases of the variant.\", \"The Netherlands has 13 confirmed cases, while Canada has found two.\", \"In Malaysia, however, officials went ahead with the partial reopening of a bridge connecting it to the island city-state of Singapore.\", \"And New Zealand announced it will continue plans to reopen internally after months of shutdown, while also restricting travel from African nations.\", \"But Omicron has not changed New Zealand's plans to ease restrictions in Auckland and move the nation into a new, more open phase of its pandemic response, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said.\", \"The World Health Organization, noting that the variant has already been detected in many countries and that closing borders often has a limited effect, called for frontiers to remain open.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">One of the world's busiest land borders reopens</div>\", \"Malaysians working in Singapore held joyful reunions with loved ones after returning to their homeland following the partial reopening of a land border that was shuttered for nearly two years because of the pandemic.\", \"Buses ferried fully vaccinated passengers across the Causeway Bridge that connects the island of Singapore with the Malaysian peninsula.\", \"Strict measures included pre-departure and on-arrival COVID-19 tests.\\u00a0\", \"Malaysia's health minister tweeted that a COVID-19 case was detected during a screening, but did not elaborate.\", \"The causeway was one of the world's busiest land borders before the pandemic struck.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">No data yet to suggest Omicron more\\u00a0virulent</div>\", \"Dr\\u00a0Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health in the United States, meanwhile, said no data as yet suggest the new variant causes more serious illness than previous COVID-19 variants.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I do think it's more contagious when you look at how rapidly it spread through multiple districts in South Africa. It has the earmarks therefore of being particularly likely to spread from one person to another,\\\" he said.\", \"Dr Collins echoed several experts in saying the news should make everyone redouble their efforts to use the tools the world already has, including vaccinations, booster shots and measures such as mask-wearing.\", \"The US's top infectious diseases expert, Anthony Fauci, said it\\u00a0will take approximately two more weeks to have more definitive information on the transmissibility, severity and other characteristics of Omicron, according to a statement from the White House.\", \"The US has banned\\u00a0travel from South Africa and seven other southern African countries.\", \"South Africa's government\\u00a0responded angrily to the travel bans, which it said are \\\"akin to punishing South Africa for its advanced genomic sequencing and the ability to detect new variants quicker\\\".\", \"AP/ABC\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5d844ed63048c2469b68cb3ecde5796b\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> What COVID-19 travel insurance doesn't cover you for(Emilia Terzon)</div>\"]","href_hash":"9c6f4aba512311ecb1e5595bc6a80f48"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9c6f4aba512311ecb1e5595bc6a80f48"}},
