She was the embodiment of authority and command, practically unrivaled in her day and studiously copied by later generations.\", \"But throughout \\u201cJanet Jackson,\\u201d a four-hour documentary that premiered over two nights on Lifetime and A&E, the highs and lows of Jackson\\u2019s career are often presented as a kind of collateral asset or damage. Her brothers were famous first; Jackson was the spunky younger sister who came after. When her brother Michael, then the most famous pop star on the planet, faced his first allegations of sexual impropriety, Jackson lost her opportunity for a lucrative sponsorship with Coca-Cola. When a wardrobe malfunction derailed Jackson\\u2019s performance at the 2004 Super Bowl halftime show, it is her career that\\u2019s tanked, and not that of her collaborator, the rising star Justin Timberlake.\", \"It\\u2019s a curious choice for the first official documentary about one of the most influential musicians of the last few decades. But what makes it even more curious is that Jackson herself is the executive producer (along with her brother, and manager, Randy). It is a bait and switch, using the lure of access and intimacy \\u2014 cameras followed her for five years, we\\u2019re told \\u2014 as a tool of deflection.\", \"\\u201cJanet Jackson\\u201d is a sanctioned documentary with the feel of a YouTube news clip aggregation. Jackson is interviewed extensively, but largely provides play-by-play, rarely color commentary. In some parts, especially when she\\u2019s shown in conversation with Randy, she\\u2019s the one asking questions, especially when the pair return to the family\\u2019s Gary, Ind., home. At almost every emotional crossroads, the film drops a whooshing thwack sound effect, an unconscious echo of the \\u201cLaw & Order\\u201d cha-chunk, and cuts to commercial. That choice renders fraught moments melodramatic, and melodramatic moments comic.\", \"In between elisions, \\u201cJanet Jackson\\u201d is bolstered by some phenomenal archival footage, mainly shot by Jackson\\u2019s ex-husband Ren\\u00e9 Elizondo Jr., who toted a camera throughout their time together \\u2014 as romantic and professional partners \\u2014 with an eye toward some future omnibus archive. We see Jackson in the studio with Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, in a tug of war of wills while working out the sound of \\u201cJanet Jackson\\u2019s Rhythm Nation 1814,\\u201d her second album with them and the follow-up to the career-making \\u201cControl.\\u201d During the recording for the 1995 single \\u201cScream,\\u201d we see Jackson and Michael talking about lyrics, and Michael asking for her to tap into the voice from her rock hit \\u201cBlack Cat.\\u201d There\\u2019s sleepy but telling footage of a meeting with Coca-Cola as Jackson is being offered that sponsorship, and also scenes from the table read of the 1993 film \\u201cPoetic Justice,\\u201d in which Jackson starred alongside Tupac Shakur.\", \"As for drama \\u2014 there is no drama, this film insists. Everything is fine. Joe Jackson, the family patriarch, is presented as a beacon of hard work and discipline, not abuse, without whom the children\\u2019s success would have been impossible. Jackson\\u2019s exes \\u2014 James DeBarge, Elizondo, Jermaine Dupri \\u2014 are largely forgiven for their improprieties. Her third husband, Wissam Al Mana (they split up in 2017), is never named, but the son they share, Eissa, is mentioned and briefly shown. As for the Super Bowl performance that derailed her career, well, Jackson and Timberlake are great friends, she says.\", \"Or maybe something else is going on. \\u201cShe continually suffers privately, and doesn\\u2019t involve any of you,\\u201d says Wayne Scot Lucas, her longtime stylist.\", \"That seems to include Benjamin Hirsch, the film\\u2019s director and the one peppering Jackson with questions. In several segments, Hirsch uses the audio of his query in order to provide a more complete picture of the incomplete answer he receives. His asks are gentle but direct, with only a shadow of the awkwardness that comes with pushing a famous and famously private person in an uncomfortable direction. Often when he\\u2019s probing, Jackson is in the back seat of an S.U.V., being chauffeured to a location designed to trigger a memory; the most vulnerable aspect of these scenes is the physical proximity, a space-sharing closeness that\\u2019s a proxy for actual feeling-sharing closeness.\", \"When the spotlight is ceded to others, especially Jackson\\u2019s behind-the-scenes collaborators like Lucas and the dancer Tina Landon, little flickers of clarity emerge. And a fuller appreciation of Jackson\\u2019s artistry comes from Jam and Lewis (who also serve as music supervisors on the documentary), and her former choreographer Paula Abdul. Plenty of other superstars are corralled \\u2014 Whoopi Goldberg, Mariah Carey, Samuel L. Jackson, Barry Bonds (!), Missy Elliott \\u2014 simply to shower Jackson with platitudes, a colossal missed opportunity.\", \"It\\u2019s churlish to linger over what\\u2019s not covered here, but given that official documentaries can tend toward the hagiographic, there\\u2019s perilously little analysis or appreciation of Jackson\\u2019s music or videos, just assertions of their greatness. The one exception is Questlove, who discusses advocating for her election to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. Jackson\\u2019s life has spanned many traumas, but this film mostly recalls them gauzily, and doesn\\u2019t argue strongly enough for her triumphs. What\\u2019s more, the editing is choppy, and the lighting is often garish \\u2014 a tabloid-style production for an artist who merits vanity treatment.\", \"But the pall is coming from inside the house. Even at her pop peak, Jackson was often reluctant, and years of public scandal that tarred her even from a distance have not seemingly inclined her to do much beyond shrug and retreat.\", \"By that measure, the film is a success. And sometimes the reticence is rendered literal. When Jackson\\u2019s mother is asked about Michael\\u2019s death, she falters a bit, and someone off camera, seemingly Jackson, asks her if the questioning is too much for her. She indicates that it is, and they move on. And when Jackson is discussing her father\\u2019s death \\u2014 \\u201cI got the opportunity to thank him, thank God\\u201d \\u2014 it\\u2019s the rare moment where emotion gets the best of her. After just the faintest shudder, though, she erects a wall: \\u201cOK, Ben, that\\u2019s enough.\\u201d And yet.\"]","href_hash":"4048728482ce11ecb1a65f1e27718681"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4048728482ce11ecb1a65f1e27718681"}},
