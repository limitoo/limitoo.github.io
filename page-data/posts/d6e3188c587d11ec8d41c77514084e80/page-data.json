He was 79.\", \"His family announced the death in a statement but did not cite a cause. He had been admitted to a hospital for unspecified reasons two days before his death.\", \"Mr. Williams was the rare manager whose name featured as prominently in the world of Formula One racing as his team\\u2019s drivers, who included stars like Damon Hill, Nigel Mansell, Nelson Piquet and Ayrton Senna.\", \"He achieved that status as much through his team\\u2019s extraordinary record as through his own outsize public persona, at once ebullient and withdrawn, friendly and cutthroat. He exuded a childlike love for speed and cars; during interviews he would sometimes pause when he heard the approach of a roaring engine, a boyish smile creeping across his face.\", \"The Williams team dominated Formula One in the early 1980s and again in the \\u201990s, when its focus on technical innovation gave it an edge over teams sponsored by much larger and more well-financed corporate outfits.\", \"\\u201cThe Williams car of the early 1990s,\\u201d The New York Times wrote in 2016, \\u201cwith its active suspension, semiautomatic gearbox, fly-by-wire controls and traction control, was so advanced that it led the series into banning most of the concepts for fear that the cars would end up being able to drive themselves with no need for a driver.\\u201d\", \"Except for a few years early in his career, Mr. Williams never raced, nor did he design the cars driven to glory. Instead, his genius was in the wheeling and dealing, the hiring and firing of drivers, the nurturing of engineering talent, and the thousands of other strategic and tactical decisions that go into making a successful racing team.\", \"During his 43 years at the helm of Williams Grand Prix Engineering, his drivers won 114 races, a number exceeded only by Ferrari, McLaren and Mercedes. Seven of his drivers were crowned world champions, and his team won nine constructors\\u2019 championships, an honor given to the people or groups that design the cars \\u2014 a feat that only Ferrari has surpassed.\", \"Many of Mr. Williams\\u2019s greatest achievements came after an auto accident rendered him a quadriplegic. After he rolled his rented Honda off a French country road in 1986, doctors in Marseilles declared him clinically dead three times in the following days. But within six months he was back at work.\", \"He also confronted other challenges that might have led a less driven man to quit the sport.\", \"Piers Courage, his best friend and driver for his first team, Frank Williams Racing Cars, died in an accident during the 1970 Dutch Grand Prix.\", \"Decades later, Mr. Williams hired Ayrton Senna, one of the sport\\u2019s most promising young drivers, who died in an accident at the San Marino Grand Prix in 1994. He spent more than a decade fighting charges of manslaughter before finally winning his case in an Italian court in 2005.\", \"By then the Williams team was past its heyday, finally overtaken by its better-funded corporate rivals. Its last title before Mr. Williams\\u2019s death was in 1997, and in his final years its drivers rarely placed, let alone won races.\", \"Mr. Williams ceded day-to-day control of the team to his daughter, Claire, in 2013, the same year his wife, Virginia (Berry) Williams, died. After years of mounting financial and professional losses, the team was sold to Dorilton Capital, an American investment firm, in late 2020.\", \"Francis Owen Garbett Williams was born on April 16, 1942, in South Shields, a suburb of Newcastle upon Tyne in northeastern England.\", \"His father, Owen Williams, flew Wellington bombers for the Royal Air Force during World War II but left the family when Frank was a few months old. His mother, Clare (McGrath) Williams, was a teacher.\", \"His mother eventually sent him to a Roman Catholic boarding school in Scotland, where he found his love for cars and speed, especially after getting a ride in a friend\\u2019s Jaguar.\", \"Though he excelled at languages \\u2014 he spoke several fluently, including Italian \\u2014 and passed his university entrance exams, he skipped college to go into racing. He supported himself with a series of workaday jobs, including as a Yorkshire representative for the Campbell Soup Company.\", \"In between jobs he traveled around Europe, working as an unpaid mechanic in pit crews on some of the continent\\u2019s smaller racing circuits. He raced as well, on occasion, but with little success.\", \"Instead, he found he had a knack for the business side of the sport. As he moved around Europe, he bought and sold parts, brokering the flow of spark plugs and tires among scores of racing teams and building up a small pile of money to start his own team.\", \"He founded Frank Williams Racing Cars in 1966, with Piers Courage as his driver, competing in Formula Two races. Three years later they had risen to Formula One, auto racing\\u2019s elite level, and Mr. Courage, the wealthy, dashing heir to a brewing fortune, was suddenly one of Britain\\u2019s most recognized sports figures.\", \"Though Mr. Williams said he never considered quitting the sport in the wake of his friend\\u2019s death, it clearly had an impact on him, and on his team. Unable to find a winning driver, he was soon deep in debt, dodging debt collectors and working out of a phone booth after he stopped paying his phone bills.\", \"His wife, Virginia, whom he had married in 1974, kept him afloat, juggling bills and lending him money her parents sent her. He spent it freely on his obsession; once, when she gave him eight pounds for groceries, he spent it on spark plugs instead.\", \"Along with his daughter, he is survived by two sons, Jonathan and Jaime, and three grandchildren.\", \"Mr. Williams sold 60 percent of his company to Walter Wolf, a Canadian oil magnate, in 1975. But he found himself unhappy working for someone else and left the team a year later.\", \"He took with him a young engineer named Patrick Head, and the two of them founded Williams Grand Prix Engineering in a carpet factory in Oxfordshire. Though Mr. Williams was often recognized as the face of the team, he deferred credit to Mr. Head, whose brilliant technical innovations, like an \\u201cactive suspension\\u201d that kept a car level as it cornered a turn, gave drivers a few split seconds of an advantage, often enough to win a race.\", \"Mr. Williams rarely showed emotion off the track, and he led an ascetic lifestyle that set him apart from the glamorous, globe-trotting drivers who made auto racing synonymous with masculine luxury in the 1980s. He eschewed alcohol and tobacco and ran marathons in his spare time.\", \"He lit up, though, whenever the subject of speed arose.\", \"Among his most beloved memories, he told The New York Times in 2009, was a visit to an Air Force base in Arizona. The colonel giving him the tour asked if he wanted to watch a set of F-15s take off. He could barely contain his excitement, even years later.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve never forgotten it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe noise! The power! And they got to the end and they went whoosh, it was almost vertical. Fantastic. Speed and noise.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"d6e3188c587d11ec8d41c77514084e80"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d6e3188c587d11ec8d41c77514084e80"}},
