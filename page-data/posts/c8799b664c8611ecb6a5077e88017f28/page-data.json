Blue Origin has not disclosed the ticket price for paying customers.\", \"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who heads Blue Origin, said that his own recent trip into space brought him perspective and new goals. He used his experience to speak at the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow, Scotland, where he announced that seeing the fragility of the Earth from space urged him to pledge $2 billion to fight climate change.\", \"\\\"Looking back at Earth from up there, the atmosphere seems so thin, the world so finite and so fragile.

Passengers are subjected to nearly 6 G's, or six times the force of Earth's gravity, as the capsule descends.\", \"Bezos and Star Trek star William Shatner flew to space on separate New Shepard flights this year.
