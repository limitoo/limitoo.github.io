On the other hand, conservative greens will tell you that the world is ending, but that we can\\u2019t burden people with a carbon tax or a gasoline tax to slow global warming.\", \"On a third hand, suburban greens will tell you that the world is ending, but that they don\\u2019t want any windmills, solar farms or high-speed rail lines in their backyards.\", \"On a fourth hand, most of today\\u2019s leaders will tell you that the world is ending, so at Glasgow they\\u2019ve all decided to go out on a limb and commit their successors\\u2019 successor to deliver emissions-free electricity by 2030, 2040 or 2050 \\u2014 any date that doesn\\u2019t require them to ask their citizens to do anything painful today.\", \"This is not serious \\u2014 not when you\\u2019re talking about reversing all the ways that we have destabilized Earth\\u2019s systems, from ice caps and ocean currents to coral reefs and tropical forests to the density of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This is pretend.\", \"Serious was how we responded to Covid-19, when it really did feel like the world economy was ending: We fought back with the only tools we have that are as big and powerful as Mother Nature \\u2014 Father Profit and New Tech.\", \"We combined innovative biotech firms \\u2014 like Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and some small start-ups \\u2014 with today\\u2019s massive computing power and a giant market demand signal, and what did we get? In a little over a year after first being locked down by the virus, I had an effective mRNA vaccine against Covid-19 in my body \\u2014 followed by a booster!\", \"That was an amazing feat of biotechnology and computerized logistics to develop and deliver vaccines. And I hope the scientists, employees and shareholders of those vaccine innovators make boatloads of money \\u2014 because it will incentivize others to apply a similar formula to stem climate change.\", \"I have nothing against Glasgow. I admire those leaders who are trying to inspire the world to cut CO2 emissions, preserve biodiversity and hold each other to account. But we will not decarbonize the global economy with a lowest-common-denominator action plan of 195 countries. Not possible.\", \"We will get there only when Father Profit and risk-taking entrepreneurs produce transformative technologies that enable ordinary people to have extraordinary impacts on our climate without sacrificing much \\u2014 by just being good consumers of these new technologies.\", \"In short: we need a few more Greta Thunbergs and a lot more Elon Musks. That is, more risk-taking innovators converting basic science into tools yet to be imagined to protect the planet for a generation yet to be born.\", \"The good news \\u2014 it\\u2019s happening. Two examples:\", \"The first is Planet.com, which I alluded to briefly in last week\\u2019s column from Glasgow. Founded in 2010 by three former NASA scientists based in San Francisco, Planet has some 200 earth-imaging satellites in orbit, most the size of a loaf of bread, to observe the entire global land mass every 24 hours in high resolution \\u2014 in order to make the changes unfolding on the ground \\u201cvisible, accessible and actionable.\\u201d No government in the world has this capacity.\", \"With these new deep transparency tools we can begin to reshape capitalism. For years, the rules and incentives of capitalism enabled oil and coal companies to extract fossil fuels \\u2014 and industries to use them \\u2014 without paying the true cost of the damage they were causing. That was easy to do because nature was hard to value; destruction was often hard to see in real time; and consumers had no tools to react. They had to wait for the courts.\", \"\\u201cCapitalism has produced enormous wealth, but in part that\\u2019s because it has been able to treat nature as self-replenishing, hyper-abundant and free,\\u201d explained Andrew Zolli, Planet\\u2019s chief impact officer.\", \"That will not be so easy anymore. Satellites are now \\u201cenabling us to put natural capital on every company and every country\\u2019s balance sheet,\\u2019\\u2019 so it will not take account of just your business profits and losses, \\u201cbut all of your impacts\\u2019\\u2019 on the environment as well, Will Marshall, one of Planet\\u2019s three co-founders and its C.E.O., said to me.\", \"Planet\\u2019s satellites plus AI, Marshall explained, can track a country\\u2019s trees, farmlands, coral reefs, coastal mangroves and smokestack emissions with incredible precision \\u2014 down to three meters \\u2014 and provides transparency to show which trees are being illegally logged by whom and whose factories are violating their carbon dioxide emissions promises.\", \"That data can then be used \\u2014 in theory \\u2014 to trigger consumer boycotts, spread through social networks, against the government or the food or mining company doing the damage, or it can stimulate foreign aid or investment in the country or community protecting its natural resources.\", \"For instance, Planet, with a group of scientific and philanthropic partners, has helped create a detailed map \\u2014 the Allen Coral Atlas \\u2014 of all the world\\u2019s remaining coral reefs. The Philippines is using the atlas\\u2019s data about sea grass to plan nine new marine-protected areas throughout the country. At the same time, in a partnership paid by Norway, Planet is tracking deforestation in 64 tropical rainforest countries, including Brazil. Using Planet\\u2019s pinpoint accuracy, the Brazilian government has vastly increased the number of cease-and-desist citations against illegal loggers, according to Planet\\u2019s Brazilian partner, MapBiomas.\", \"Even more important, Marshall said, is how Planet\\u2019s commercial business also helps by, for example, enabling farmers to do precision agriculture by giving them fine-grain images of their crops so they know exactly where to add water and fertilizer or when to harvest. \\u201cThis may have the biggest ecosystem impact of all,\\u201d he said. More efficient crop yields that use less water and fewer fertilizers end up \\u201creducing the need to plow up more tropical forest and strengthens the environment generally.\\u201d\", \"The other company I am watching is Helion Energy, based in Redmond, Wash., which is working on \\u201cthe world\\u2019s first fusion power plant.\\u201d Fusion energy has long been the holy grail for clean power generation \\u2014 and it always seems 20 years away. As the International Atomic Energy Agency notes on its website: \\u201cThe sun, along with all other stars, is powered by a reaction called nuclear fusion. If nuclear fusion can be replicated on earth, it could provide virtually limitless clean, safe and affordable energy.\\u201d\", \"Last June, as the website New Atlas reported, Helion published results confirming that its latest system had managed to heat a fusion plasma to a temperature over 100 million degrees Celsius, \\u201cwhich is significant, since it\\u2019s around the point at which there\\u2019s enough thermal energy to create large amounts of fusion.\\u201d\", \"On Nov. 5, in the midst of Glasgow, Helion, across the Atlantic in Redmond, announced that it had raised $500 million in new financing in a round led by Sam Altman, C.E.O. of OpenAI and former president of Y Combinator, along with a Who\\u2019s Who of tech entrepreneurs.\", \"The current generation of Helion\\u2019s system, Techcrunch.com reported, \\u201cwouldn\\u2019t be able to replace your Tesla Powerwall and solar panels \\u2014 the size of a generator is roughly the size of a shipping container. But at 50 megawatts, the generators could power around 40,000 homes.\\u201d As New Atlas pointed out, \\u201cHelion projects it will generate electricity at rock-bottom prices of around $10 per MWh \\u2026 less than a third the price of coal-fired power or today\\u2019s solar PV installations.\\u201d\", \"Is Helion THE holy grail? Don\\u2019t know. There are other companies with promising approaches \\u2014 like Commonwealth Fusion Systems \\u2014 all racing to the same goal. I just know this: We got into this hole thanks to the worst of capitalism \\u2014 letting companies privatize their gains from despoiling the environment and warming the climate \\u2014 while socializing the losses among all of us.\", \"We can get out of it, in part, by accelerating the best of American capitalism. We need to re-energize our innovation ecosystem to where government funds basic research that pushes the boundaries of physics, chemistry and biology and then combines that innovation with immigration policies that amass the world\\u2019s best pools of engineering talent and then unleashes that talent \\u2014 propelled by risk-takers \\u2014 to invent new clean technologies to slow global warming at the warp speed and scale we need.\"]","href_hash":"defabe42474f11ecafdddda8d8416c7a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"defabe42474f11ecafdddda8d8416c7a"}},
