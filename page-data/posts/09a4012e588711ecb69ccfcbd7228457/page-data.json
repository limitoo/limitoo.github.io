If so, do you feel popular or besieged?\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m an election lawyer,\\u201d said Daniel Weiner, \\u201cand on Thanksgiving my relatives kept asking: \\u2018Why am I getting these emails and can you do something about it?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Weiner, deputy director of the Brennan Center\\u2019s Election Reform Program, would certainly be a good person to ask, and he\\u2019ll tell you one option is to click the little \\u2014 some cynics would say itty-bitty \\u2014 unsubscribe note on each missive.\", \"Another is to just suck it up and give something. If you want candidates to be responsive to ordinary voters rather than wealthy special-interest donors, there\\u2019s got to be some way to wring cash out of normal, non-rich Americans. \\u201cPolitics costs money. If you care about politics, and have the means, consider making small donations,\\u201d Weiner advised.\", \"There are many, many folks out there attempting to make a (large) living by compiling and selling monster mailing lists. As a result, some requests for donations may seem to come from far afield. \\u201cBig news \\u2014 check out our new ad,\\u201d says an email I got, hoping I\\u2019d send money to Erick Allen, a candidate for lieutenant governor of Georgia.\", \"Still, a lot of this email exhaustion is simply the fault of \\u2014 yes! You guessed it! \\u2014 Donald Trump.\", \"I got more than 50 emails from Democrats seeking campaign cash right after Thanksgiving, but that paled beside the flood from Trump, who seems intent on pitching every person in America several times a day.\", \"\\u201cPresident Trump\\u2019s Exclusive Wine Glasses are running extremely low on stock, and we saw you haven\\u2019t claimed your pair yet,\\u201d warned an email this week. \\u201cThere are only A COUPLE of Trump Wine Glasses left, and our team can only hold YOURS for the next 15 minutes.\\u201d\", \"How many of you believe the team is really low on Trump wine glasses? Well, if you do, act fast, \\u201ccontribute $70 or MORE right away\\u201d and you\\u2019ll get your very own set.\", \"The wine glasses, by the way, actually look like something used to provide water for members of a charter revision committee during a long public hearing. And if you hit the contribution button you\\u2019ll see the really important thing \\u2014 a set of prechecked boxes asking that your $70-or-more become \\u201ca monthly recurring donation.\\u201d\", \"Watch out for anything that authorizes recurring donations. It\\u2019s like those robocalls trying to get you to press 1 for further information. Never press 1! Never authorize recurring donations! OK, unless you\\u2019re really in love with one particular politician, have complete confidence he or she won\\u2019t break your heart over the next 11 months, and don\\u2019t want to be bothered recommitting on a regular basis.\", \"Not something you need to consider when it comes to Trump making sneaky attempts to get a recurring donation commitment in return for terrible thank-you gifts. \\u201cFor a short time, when you make a contribution of $75, we\\u2019ll send you one of our ICONIC Trump Save America Christmas Ornaments FOR FREE,\\u201d said one email this week. Now, the ornament is not the absolute worst holiday item on Trump\\u2019s list. (Have you seen the Christmas stocking with his face on it?) But do you find it strange that he wants $75 for that \\u201cFREE\\u201d decoration?\", \"The emailers like to toss in personal details, just to show that we\\u2019re pals. I\\u2019d gotten used to being addressed as \\u201cFriend,\\u201d but more and more seem to know my name. A recent letter to \\u201cGail\\u201d from the Democratic National Committee explained how important it was that I be \\u201cone of 16 more supporters from Flushing to contribute $7 to ensure Democrats have the resources they need to compete and win everywhere.\\u201d\", \"The only problem, as you may have guessed, is that I don\\u2019t live in Flushing.\", \"Right now everybody wants to help you prepare for holiday giving. You may have gotten a gift guide from the \\u201cOfficial Democratic Store\\u201d that features, inevitably, a presidential \\u201cCup o\\u2019 Joe\\u201d coffee mug, as well as a \\u201cDogs for Democrats\\u201d collar. Sorry to say the Joe Biden ice cream scoop was already sold out.\", \"Rafts of non-presidential candidates are mailing, too. Unlike Trump and Biden, they\\u2019re probably people you\\u2019ve never heard of. But if you make a donation, you will most definitely hear from them again.\", \"And from a lot of other folks. Give once and your name is probably going to wind up on donor lists that are compiled, traded and sold all over the political world.\", \"\\u201cOnce you get on that list it\\u2019s almost impossible to get off,\\u201d said Rick Hasen, a professor at the University of California, Irvine, School of Law.\", \"So what to do? Well, you can treat the emails like spam, or hit the unsubscribe option. Can\\u2019t promise they won\\u2019t return in some new form, but it\\u2019s a start.\", \"Or you can just jump into the fray, pick some candidates you like, and respond to their emails with donations. Active citizens make for better politics and being a reasonable person who takes part helps beat back all the lunatics who seem to be thinking of nothing but bombarding you with email around the clock.\", \"No offense, Donald.\"]","href_hash":"09a4012e588711ecb69ccfcbd7228457"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"09a4012e588711ecb69ccfcbd7228457"}},
