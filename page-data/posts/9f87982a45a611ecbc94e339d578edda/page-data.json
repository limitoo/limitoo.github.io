Guiteau, the lawyer who shot President James A. Garfield in 1881.\", \"Guiteau aims his gun at the audience, panning over us slowly, deliberately, in tension-filled silence. The music is stopped. The menace is visceral.\", \"\\u201cFacing the barrel of a gun, even when it\\u2019s just in a musical, is the kind of shock that can exist only in live theater,\\u201d Sondheim wrote in his 2011 book \\u201cLook, I Made a Hat,\\u201d in which he called this lingering, life-or-death moment in \\u201cAssassins\\u201d his favorite in a show rife with gun-waving murderers and murderers manqu\\u00e9.\", \"I\\u2019d wondered how that confrontation would land in John Doyle\\u2019s current revival at Classic Stage Company, not so much because of the state of our armed-to-the-teeth nation but because of the shooting last month on the set of the Alec Baldwin film \\u201cRust,\\u201d where a real gun fired a real bullet that killed a real person, when it was all meant to be pretend.\", \"The surprising answer is that it doesn\\u2019t land at all, because Doyle has defanged the moment, speeding it up to a manic pace. His jittery Guiteau, played by a creepily unnerving Will Swenson, swings the gun left, right and center so fast that there\\u2019s no time for us to feel endangered, no time for the threat to lodge inside us and turn to fear.\", \"Granted, maybe we\\u2019re all too freaked out right now anyway to have a prop gun pointed at us. But I wish that Doyle had plastered the lobby with unmissable posters explaining, as the digital program does, that the show\\u2019s guns \\u201care replicas that were provided, checked, and rendered inoperable\\u201d by a weapons specialist. I wish he\\u2019d had leaflets printed with the same message, and handed to each person on the way in.\", \"I wish he\\u2019d kept that long, scary moment. Because racing through it undermines the potency of the show, Classic Stage\\u2019s first since the shutdown.\", \"Even with a powerhouse cast, this stripped down, off-balance production \\u2014 originally slated for spring 2020 as part of the Sondheim 90th-birthday festivities \\u2014 never does find a way to make the audience feel the stakes of its characters\\u2019 actions. That\\u2019s true whether we view the assassins purely as historical figures or also as metaphors for an aggressive strain of lethal discontent as American as Old Glory.\", \"The show\\u2019s vaudevillian patchwork of stories about volatile 19th- and 20th-century misfits who murdered a president, or tried to, makes us laugh and leaves us humming. But we are ultimately unperturbed.\", \"And maybe that, too, is a sign of the times: that we have lately lived through such virulent, brutal threats to our democracy that this motley bunch (John Wilkes Booth! Lee Harvey Oswald! Lynette (Squeaky) Fromme!) hardly seems ominous. What risk they posed, what damage they did, is past.\", \"But there are also plenty of parallels to the present in Sondheim\\u2019s sharp-eyed song cycle of the ostensibly dispossessed and in Weidman\\u2019s often casually violent dialogue. Doyle, a Sondheim veteran who staged the 2017 revival of the Sondheim-Weidman \\u201cPacific Overtures,\\u201d infers one contemporary correlation outright with his final stage image, which I will not spoil.\", \"\\u201cNo one can be put in jail for his dreams,\\u201d Booth \\u2014 the alpha assassin, played by Steven Pasquale as a smooth Southern shark \\u2014 sings to the others in the delusion-packed opening number, \\u201cEverybody\\u2019s Got the Right.\\u201d\", \"Gathered at a fairground shooting gallery, they are encouraged to kill a president to win a prize. On Doyle\\u2019s set, above a bare thrust stage painted with the Stars and Stripes, a giant round target flashes with projections (by Steve Channon) of the various presidents\\u2019 faces.\", \"That same screen, bordered with lights that shine red, blue and \\u2014 peculiarly \\u2014 not white but pale yellow, is pretty much all the scenery the show gets, which is in keeping with Doyle\\u2019s pared-back aesthetic. But the storytelling would have benefited from more visual cues. Many projections are too coldly literal and too far removed from the action to aid it properly.\", \"When Giuseppe Zangara (Wesley Taylor), the would-be assassin of Franklin D. Roosevelt, is executed, an image of an electric chair is projected above him. When Guiteau ascends to the gallows for his hanging while singing, with increasing franticness, \\u201cI am going to the Lordy, I am so glad,\\u201d Swenson has no stairs to dance on; there\\u2019s merely a distant projection of an empty noose.\", \"Similarly, when Booth is in hiding, having shot Lincoln, there is no visual indication that he himself is injured, his leg broken. Pasquale is darkly charismatic, though: singing softly, beguilingly of \\u201cblood on the clover\\u201d from the Civil War in \\u201cThe Ballad of Booth,\\u201d before the mask of romance slips and he spits a racist slur about Lincoln at venomous volume.\", \"The three-piece orchestra, led by Greg Jarrett, is supplemented in trademark Doyle style by some of the cast, notably Ethan Slater as the appealing Balladeer, who strolls the stage in a blue jumpsuit, playing an acoustic guitar. (Costumes are by Ann Hould-Ward.) Later he transforms into Oswald, a despondent young man with a powerful gun that \\u2014 like many things here \\u2014 comes wrapped in the flag.\", \"Heretical as it sounds, comic dialogue, not song, is this production\\u2019s strongest suit. But aside from a curiously underwhelming rendition of \\u201cUnworthy of Your Love,\\u201d the pretty, poppy duet between Fromme (Tavi Gevinson) and John Hinckley Jr. (Adam Chanler-Berat, who is suitably skin-crawling as the man who attempted to assassinate Ronald Reagan in 1981), it\\u2019s not that the musical performances are lacking.\", \"It\\u2019s that the lighter book scenes really shine, especially the hilariously mercurial ramblings of the wannabe Richard Nixon killer Samuel Byck (Andy Grotelueschen) and the terrifically lively scenes between Gerald Ford\\u2019s foiled assassins, Fromme and Sara Jane Moore (Judy Kuhn, handily transcending the role\\u2019s scatterbrained-broad stereotype).\", \"\\u201cAssassins\\u201d has been faulted since its premiere three decades ago for a supposed failure to make its disparate parts cohere. It\\u2019s also proved many times that they can, yet Doyle\\u2019s staging never manages to harness that cumulative power. Faithful though it is to the show\\u2019s sung and spoken text, it\\u2019s missing some vital connective tissue.\", \"Of course, the same could be said of the country. This is a musical with a deep, warning sense of something frighteningly wrong in the fabric of the United States \\u2014 a nation where, as the song goes, \\u201cSomething just broke.\\u201d\", \"You can still hear that alarm in this production. But don\\u2019t expect to feel it more than distantly.\"]","href_hash":"9f87982a45a611ecbc94e339d578edda"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9f87982a45a611ecbc94e339d578edda"}},
