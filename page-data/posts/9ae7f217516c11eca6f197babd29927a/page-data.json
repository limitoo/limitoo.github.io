The planned studies include a review of the current nuclear forces and a review of the policies that go along with their potential use, set to be finished early in 2022.\", \"The Pentagon is reportedly also working on revisions to the National Defense Strategy, the framework for the administration's defense policies including the role of nuclear weapons, modernizing the nation's armed forces, cyber threats and international alliances.\", \"In September, the U.S. announced a partnership with Britain and Australia to improve coordination of their defense, security and diplomatic efforts in the Asia-Pacific region, along with Australia acquiring nuclear-powered submarines from the U.S. and Britain, a move seen by many as one made with China specifically in mind.\", \"An official who spoke anonymously to reporters including the AP before the report's release said multiple other adjustments to placement of forces in the Asia-Pacific region are being worked on, but require further conversations and approval with foreign governments.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941840/defense-secretary-pentagon-lloyd-austin-us-military.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The Pentagon announced Monday the results of a study initiated by Austin in March that reviewed U.S. troop deployments around the globe.

At the time of Austin's announcement, U.S. and European officials were expressing concern about a buildup of Russian forces near Ukraine's border. That crisis abated, but in recent weeks it has returned amid worry that Moscow might be planning a military incursion into Ukraine.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941841/defense-secretary-pentagon-lloyd-austin-us-military.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Ukraine and Russia's influence on the nation was part of the study of global troop placements concluded by the Pentagon recently.
