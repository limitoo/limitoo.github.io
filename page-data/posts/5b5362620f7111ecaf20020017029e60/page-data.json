I was also nervous since the film involved transition and as a pre-transition person I'm shown as a man with a beard.\", \"\\\"But when I read the story and researched about the director, I said yes.

Many transgender people are thrown out of their homes by their families, and most still make a living by singing and dancing at weddings or child births, or through begging and prostitution. \", \"Kerala is India's most trans-friendly state - in 2015, it became the first to unveil a Transgender Policy to end stigma and discrimination towards the sexual minority group. But transphobia remains as real in Kerala as anywhere else in India.\", \"Navya Rao, online marketing head at Bhima and the brain behind the ad, told the BBC that her proposal for the campaign was met with \\\"fears and apprehensions\\\" from her colleagues.\", \"\\\"All our previous ads had happy heterosexual brides. So we were worried about how people would perceive it and react to it.\", \"\\\"Most of our stores are in rural parts of the state. We were not sure how much exposure people there would have had to these issues.\\\" \", \"But the 96-year-old jewellery house, with dozens of stores in southern India and a branch in the United Arab Emirates, decided to go ahead with the ad to \\\"give a social message\\\" and \\\"start a conversation\\\".\", \"Ms Rao says she was well aware that the campaign could backfire. Memory of last year's controversy over an advertisement by popular jewellery brand Tanishq also instilled fear - that campaign with an interfaith couple was withdrawn after a right-wing backlash on social media. \", \"Meera says she \\\"was expecting a lot of conflict, especially since the ad shows a Hindu wedding which directly challenges the Hindu hetero-patriarchal system\\\".\", \"<img src = 'https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/17F79/production/_120396189_two.jpg' class=\\\"abcImg\\\" />\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Meera Singhania in the ad film</div>\", \"But Pure as Love has received little hate and the response, Ms Rao says, has been \\\"overwhelming\\\". \", \"\\\"There was some criticism of the ad and we were accused of lending a voice to a cause that's unnatural and not supposed to exist in society. But our inboxes have been filled with positive messages. Many from the LGBTQI community reached out to us saying the ad had touched their heart,\\\" she said. \", \"Sudha Pillai, a writer and brand strategist at Firework, a video platform, described the ad as \\\"revolutionary\\\".\", \"\\\"I watched it on a Malayalam news channel and I thought they might not sell any jewellery, but if the idea was to grab eyeballs, they did it,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"I've never seen any traditional brand do something so drastic. To take that kind of a risk for a traditional jeweller was revolutionary,\\\" she added.\", \"On Instagram, many described it as \\\"brilliant\\\" and \\\"beautiful\\\" and confessed that they were \\\"moved to tears\\\" watching it.\", \"\\\"Thank you for giving me someone I can aspire to be on screen,\\\" read one comment on YouTube. \\\"I am moved to tears to know that you've used a trans person for this film\\u2026 For the first time it feels like my story matters TOO... and our lives deserve to be happy TOO.

There can be a bit of resistance to them initially, but they can be a game-changer.\\\"\", \"Ms Pillai says when she praised the ad on social media, she mostly expected responses from conservative Indians and angry trolls. \", \"\\\"There were some differences in opinion, but the number of those who felt threatened was tiny.
