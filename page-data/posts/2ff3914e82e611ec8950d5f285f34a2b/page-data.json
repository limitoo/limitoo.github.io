They have helped me make these six years such a rich and rewarding experience,\\\" she said.\", \"Day was also elected as the deputy mayor in 2016.\", \"She said being the first wahine M\\u0101ori councillor was a \\\"profoundly bittersweet milestone that underscored the council's historic failure to reflect the very diversity that makes Wellington such a dynamic city\\\".\", \"\\\"But when it comes to meeting the council's obligations under Te Tiriti to address historic injustices and engage as true partners with mana whenua - in substance, not just symbolism - there has been considerable improvement during my time on council. I am honoured to have played some part in bringing about such long-overdue change.\", \"\\\"These include; Te Tauihu, a te reo M\\u0101ori policy to make Wellington a te reo M\\u0101ori city by 2040, putting mana whenua back into a decision-making position around our council committee table as of right and with voting rights, creating a M\\u0101ori Ward for Te Whanganui-a-Tara for 2022 and beyond, and Increasing the funding for M\\u0101ori development from $2 million over 10 years to $29m so this work can deliver meaningful results.\\\"\", \"\\\"It is gratifying to see the eagerness with which Wellingtonians from all walks of life have embraced these changes, signalling broad and deep acceptance and understanding of the obligations and opportunities of giving Te Tiriti o Waitangi its rightful place in our civic life. This would have been unimaginable as recently as a decade ago.\", \"\\\"We must honour and celebrate the courage, activism and leadership of earlier generations who made this change possible but, in too many cases, did not live to see the fruits of their mahi. A truly bicultural Wellington is, and will remain, their legacy, their gift to us,\\\" Day said.\", \"She said she is pleased with what had been achieved in the Takap\\u016b Nothern Ward during her time on council.\", \"\\\"It was great to see the Linden Community Centre open its doors again in 2019 after years of neglect. Likewise, getting the Alex Moore Park sports hub off the ground was a highlight, as was delivering a vital upgrade to Pukehuia Park in Newlands, and seeing work on the Frank Kitts Park playground finally get underway.\\\"\", \"Day was the chair of the council's P\\u016broro Rangaranga Social, Cultural and Economic Committee, and was entrusted with policies relating to children and young people.\", \"\\\"I was delighted to have put in motion the creation of a youth hub in the city centre, as well as the adoption of the city's first ever Children and Young Person's Strategy, much of it inspired by the fantastic contributions at the 2018 Youth Summit, Youth Council and Te Ahi o Ng\\u0101 Rangatahi,\\\" Day said.\", \"\\\"I came to council as a parent and teacher with deep concerns about the housing crisis, especially as it affects young people across the city. While it is never easy to fix a problem left unaddressed by successive generations, I am pleased to have been part of a council that, over both terms, has made some important steps and continues to advocate and make decisions that tackle growing inequality.\", \"\\\"On this and other intergenerational challenges like climate change and transport, many residents are understandably frustrated with the pace and direction of change - including me. But my frustration is tempered by a cautious optimism arising from the belief that, on several fronts, leaders and residents alike are finally willing to delve into the 'too hard basket' after decades of inaction, indecision and short-term thinking,\\\" she said.\", \"As for the future, Day was not sure what she will do next.\", \"\\\"It would be my dream to find a way to contribute to implementing and upholding Te Tiriti o Waitangi in other organisations in Wellington. I see a profound shift underway throughout government, business and NGOs where they are grappling with how to uphold Te Tiriti o Waitangi in new and authentic ways. That is a journey I want to continue being part of\", \"\\\"I feel so privileged to have met so many creative, passionate and generous people from so many different backgrounds who make Wellington their home, and together who make Wellington the city we know and love. To all of them, thank you,\\\" Day said.\"]","href_hash":"2ff3914e82e611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2ff3914e82e611ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
