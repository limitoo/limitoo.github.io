But the ending of Campion\\u2019s simmering Western drama has been anything but loud or clear. The movie\\u2019s subtle conclusion has a \\u201cbig reveal\\u201d that takes a moment to comprehend \\u2014 probably not the grand gesture you might expect from the story\\u2019s battle of wills.\", \"Adapted from Thomas Savage\\u2019s 1967 novel, the movie begins with two rancher brothers, Phil (Benedict Cumberbatch) and George (Jesse Plemons), and follows what happens when George\\u2019s new wife, Rose (Kirsten Dunst), and her son, Peter (Kodi Smit-McPhee), move in with them. Larger than life and ornery as hell, Phil immediately starts tormenting both mother and son. Rose numbs herself with alcohol, but Peter proves to be a dark horse. He\\u2019s awkward but fiercely protective of his mother, and he focuses his watchful intelligence on somehow bringing Phil to justice.\", \"By the end \\u2014 maybe you know where we\\u2019re going with this \\u2014 Phil is dead. But if you blink you might miss how exactly that happens. We hear that Phil dies from anthrax, but it\\u2019s not stated outright that the source was some contaminated rawhide that Peter gives to Phil. Campion offers the barest of clues: an early mention of anthrax, Peter\\u2019s discovery of a carcass, Phil\\u2019s cutup hands and washing of the rawhide.\", \"Campion\\u2019s adaptation departs from Savage\\u2019s book, which ends unmistakably with a passage about Peter and anthrax. The beauty of Campion\\u2019s directorial decision is that there\\u2019s no revenge with a flourish. Instead, we are left to feel the release of tension and anguish that has built up throughout the film. (Truth is stranger than fiction: Savage\\u2019s actual step-uncle died of anthrax from a splinter, and was apparently a model for the character of Phil.)\", \"On a storytelling level, the enigmatic ending is partly a matter of point of view: like Phil, we aren\\u2019t aware that all this is happening. (Peter knows but he\\u2019s definitely not telling.) Yet the ambiguity of the ending also echoes the unspoken nature of the deep emotion at the movie\\u2019s heart. Phil is obsessed with a \\u201creal man\\u201d cowboy from his past named Bronco Henry \\u2014 an attachment that feels romantically intense. But Campion works in the realm of suggestion, giving the film a mysterious pull.\", \"Campion has long shaped her stories around the desires that drive their characters. As in \\u201cThe Power of the Dog,\\u201d she understands that we can be mysteries to ourselves. In her most famous film, \\u201cThe Piano,\\u201d Holly Hunter\\u2019s Ada moves from being stuck in a coercive bargain over her prized possession, to finding sexual release with her captor. \\u201cIn the Cut\\u201d finds Meg Ryan\\u2019s Frannie drawn to a smoldering police detective while suspecting that he\\u2019s committed the killings he is supposedly investigating.\", \"The nuanced ending of \\u201cThe Power of the Dog\\u201d isn\\u2019t the first time a Campion film has challenged audiences. Her Henry James adaptation \\u201cThe Portrait of a Lady\\u201d ended with a haunting, hanging moment as Nicole Kidman\\u2019s Isabel contemplates a bereft future. With her latest, Campion undertakes a fresh storytelling experiment: sharing in the mystery of its complicated characters without giving away all their secrets.\"]","href_hash":"8952ffee546111ecae851517112385c5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8952ffee546111ecae851517112385c5"}},
