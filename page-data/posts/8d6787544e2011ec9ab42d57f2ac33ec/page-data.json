That\\u2019s an honor,\\u201d Beatriz said of the fan-favorite character.\", \"But 2021 was largely a year of fresh starts for the 40-year-old actress. Early in the summer she appeared as Carla, one of the salon ladies in the film adaptation of the Lin-Manuel Miranda musical \\u201cIn the Heights.\\u201d She also became a mother for the first time.\", \"Voice acting, a skill she can trace back to when she and her sister pretended to host radio shows with a Fisher-Price tape recorder, also represents a steady aspect of her output, most recently in Netflix\\u2019s acclaimed animated limited series \\u201cMaya and the Three.\\u201d\", \"A self-anointed \\u201cDisney adult\\u201d\\u2014 her bachelorette party was held at Disneyland \\u2014 Beatriz felt overjoyed when she was cast to voice Mirabel, the Latina heroine in the studio\\u2019s 60th animated feature \\u201cEncanto,\\u201d set in Colombia. Becoming part of the legacy of magical tales she grew up watching (\\u201cSleeping Beauty\\u201d is a personal favorite), in an adventure about her father\\u2019s homeland, stunned her.\", \"\\u201cWhen your actual dream comes true, it\\u2019s very bizarre,\\u201d she said.\", \"By phone from London, with her newborn by her side, the actress discussed finding Mirabel\\u2019s voice and reminisced about her favorite animated shows growing up. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.\", \"You were born in Argentina to a Colombian father and a Bolivian mother, and you grew up in Texas. How do you understand your Latino identity?\", \"I feel like an American Latino, meaning that there\\u2019s stuff that I cling to that feels specifically American in my Latinidad, which is my love of Selena [Quintanilla] and of country music, because I grew up in Texas. But there\\u2019s stuff that feels specifically Bolivian and Colombian, and there\\u2019s stuff that feels very much my experience as an immigrant growing up here from the time I was 2. The thing that I identify with the most about Mirabel is her feeling of not belonging. That\\u2019s reflective of my own identity in the United States.\", \"In your formative years, did you feel represented in American media?\", \"We recently did a bunch of media interviews and John Leguizamo and I were paired together. He is an icon to me and one of the first Latinos I ever saw on TV. I saw him in the filmed version of \\u201cFreak,\\u201d one of his one-man shows. In that production, he talks about seeing the character Diana Morales in the play \\u201cA Chorus Line\\u201d for the first time. And so here I am watching this Latino actor talking about watching another Latino in a play and deciding that that was the moment he realized he wanted to be an artist. For me, watching him was when I realized I wanted to be one too.\", \"Tell me about the process of finding and creating Mirabel\\u2019s voice for \\u201cEncanto.\\u201d\", \"I originally thought that she should sound younger, and I was leaning into a higher pitch. But the directors pushed me toward making her sound more mature. We discussed how she\\u2019s often had to take care of herself because there are so many stars in her family. It\\u2019s up to her to make sure that her needs are getting taken care of, and with that comes a level of maturity. At the same time, she\\u2019s playful. Unlike so many Disney heroes, she doesn\\u2019t have a sidekick to guide her through the story. Mirabel sometimes is the sidekick and the therapist for her family. She uses comedy all the time. There wasn\\u2019t some other character doing sight or audio jokes. It was Mirabel, and that was very freeing and fun.\", \"You\\u2019ve found a career in voice performance for popular animated series such as \\u201cBob\\u2019s Burgers\\u201d and \\u201cBoJack Horseman.\\u201d What do you enjoy most about this work?\", \"Voice work is one of the only places where it really doesn\\u2019t matter what you look like, meaning that you can suddenly become a toucan or a princess or a monster. Your face is not the most important part, and your imagination has no bounds. When you\\u2019re in that recording booth, you close your eyes, and you follow the lead of the animators and the director. I\\u2019ve been very lucky in that it has been a big part of what I\\u2019ve done and that it was something that I could continue doing over the last two years during this global pandemic.\", \"What excited you about voicing Chimi, a character with a traumatic past, in Jorge R. Guti\\u00e9rrez\\u2019s Mesoamerican-set animated epic \\u201cMaya and the Three\\u201d?\", \"Jorge is such a giving creator. I would drop anything anytime to work with him again. There\\u2019s a lot of pain in Chimi, which is something that excites me about both \\u201cMaya\\u201d and \\u201cEncanto.\\u201d People underestimate the ability of children to access and understand their own emotions. We do them such a disservice when we talk down to them. We don\\u2019t think of them as these incredible little minds. In their own different ways, both projects address this by saying, children are capable of naming, discussing and moving through very adult emotions, because they\\u2019re just human emotions at the end of the day.\", \"Besides the Disney classics, what cartoons were you watching on TV as a kid?\", \"I watched a ton of stuff: \\u201cAnimaniacs,\\u201d the old Road Runner and Bugs Bunny cartoons. I loved Tom and Jerry, the eternal battle of good and evil. Also, the \\u201cBatman\\u201d animated series with Mark Hamill as the Joker. It was so smart and adult. That was my after-school block. But then I was also heavily influenced by \\u201cSailor Moon,\\u201d which was on TV early in the morning in Texas. My sister and I would get ready for school around 5 a.m. and I would turn on \\u201cSailor Moon.\\u201d\", \"Given that \\u201cEncanto\\u201d features a racially diverse cast of Latino characters, I wonder what your thoughts were on the colorism controversy around \\u201cIn the Heights\\u201d?\", \"\\u201cEncanto\\u201d does an amazing job of celebrating the fact that Latinidad does not look one way. Latinos don\\u2019t look all one way. The film that we made was really strong and John Chu had a beautiful vision for the film, but I absolutely understand why the casting of \\u201cIn the Heights\\u201d gave the Black Latino community an issue. Colorism is real, dark-skinned Latinos aren\\u2019t given leading roles. That their stories are at the forefront is so important.\"]","href_hash":"8d6787544e2011ec9ab42d57f2ac33ec"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8d6787544e2011ec9ab42d57f2ac33ec"}},
