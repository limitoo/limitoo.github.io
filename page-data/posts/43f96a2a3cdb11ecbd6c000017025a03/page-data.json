That’s just one reason two new releases are so surprising.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-11-03T19:22:04.000Z","content":"[\"The newly released \\u201cThe Souvenir Part II\\u201d and \\u201cBergman Island\\u201d are both films by modern masters that not only delve into the filmmaking process but also draw from the personal lives of the filmmakers themselves.\", \"Sound familiar? Self-reflexive movies like these practically double as auteurist rites of passage \\u2014 think \\u201c8 \\u00bd,\\u201d Federico Fellini\\u2019s beguiling ode to creative block with Marcello Mastroianni playing a version of the filmmaker; \\u201cDay for Night,\\u201d Fran\\u00e7ois Truffaut\\u2019s chaotic comedy about artistic collaboration starring Truffaut himself in the on-camera director\\u2019s chair; and, more recently, \\u201cPain and Glory,\\u201d Pedro Almod\\u00f3var\\u2019s melodrama about an aging filmmaker (Antonio Banderas) in crisis. The list goes on, but with the newest films, there\\u2019s a crucial distinction: the masters in questions are women.\", \"Joanna Hogg\\u2019s \\u201cThe Souvenir Part II\\u201d and Mia Hansen-Love\\u2019s \\u201cBergman Island\\u201d revolve around two women filmmakers, avatars for the directors, navigating their desires, relationships and creative pursuits in ways that fully reinvigorate the self-referential genre. Spotlighting the intellectual doubts and processes of two very different types of women, these films also raise subtle questions about gender disparity in the movie business and the unique ways in which women artists come into their own. And refreshingly, these films never dabble in obvious, self-congratulatory screeds about sexism \\u2014 theirs is a magic much more potent and revelatory.\", \"\\u201cThe Souvenir Part II\\u201d is the follow-up to Hogg\\u2019s 2019 drama about a soft-spoken student filmmaker who falls into a fraught and ultimately tragic romance with an alluring heroin addict. The new movie again draws generously from Hogg\\u2019s early years attending the National Film and Television School in Beaconsfield, England. Still reeling from her lover\\u2019s death, Julie (Honor Swinton Byrne) must build herself back up. The demands of completing her thesis film \\u2014 a relationship drama based on her memories, that is, the events of the first film \\u2014 propel her to become a more self-assured individual, transformed by the cathartic powers of creative work. In the end, the presentation of Julie\\u2019s finished film doubles as a plunge into her subconscious, a Technicolor fantasia akin to the deliriously joyous endings of golden age movie musicals and a brilliant shorthand for the marriage of art and life.\", \"In the press notes, Hogg said that despite being \\u201cterribly introverted\\u201d in film school, she had \\u201ca very clear idea of where I wanted to go, so I was able to blank out the voices, usually of men, that said \\u2018you can\\u2019t do a film like that.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Indeed, we see Julie contend with skepticism from her own cast and crew, sharing their doubts about her directorial style behind her back or directly to her face in one particularly blustery spat initiated by a boorish male colleague. In conversation with an academic advising committee, Julie must stand her ground in the face of dubious filmmaking veterans accustomed to certain rigid practices.\", \"Hogg\\u2019s methods are highly improvisatory \\u2014 her scripts contain little dialogue and are instead filled with descriptions, references to particular memories and images that might encourage ad-libbing and a more organic kind of creation.\", \"Now 61, and decades into her career, Hogg has room to experiment. Though she\\u2019s not exactly working on expensive and elaborate studio films, she enjoys privileges and leeway not typically afforded to female directors.\", \"To this day the word \\u201cauteur\\u201d brings to mind a boy\\u2019s club. Consider how new films by male directors labeled visionaries like Christopher Nolan, Quentin Tarantino, or Wes Anderson are treated as events. The cult of male genius more pertinently extends to the kinds of money, time and space given for such so-called genius to flourish. Correcting the gender imbalance in the film industry isn\\u2019t just a matter of creating more opportunities for women \\u2014 in effect meeting quotas \\u2014 but believing in the unique visions of women artists and robustly investing in the cultivation of those visions.\", \"Hogg and Hansen-Love are hardly the only women filmmakers to get personal and explore the emotional twists and turns in getting a new movie off the ground. The work of the provocateur Catherine Breillat often has an autobiographical bent. Her \\u201cAbuse of Weakness\\u201d (2014) starred Isabelle Huppert as a filmmaker who experiences a stroke, as Breillat did, and in \\u201cSex Is Comedy\\u201d (2004), the director restaged the behind-the-scenes drama leading up to the filming of one of her most infamous sex scenes. Cheryl Dunye\\u2019s \\u201cThe Watermelon Woman\\u201d (1997), starred the director as a video store worker struggling to make a documentary about a forgotten actress from the 1930s. The recent restoration and release of \\u201cThe Watermelon Woman\\u201d certainly helped pull Dunye\\u2019s ingenious autofiction out of obscurity. Nevertheless portraits of female filmmakers aren\\u2019t exactly well known or particularly numerous.\", \"The discrepancies between the way male and female filmmakers are treated are put under a magnifying glass in \\u201cBergman Island.\\u201d Chris (Vicky Krieps) and Tony (Tim Roth), directors both, retreat to the island where Ingmar Bergman shot several of his films in order to focus independently on their new scripts. Mia Hansen-Love, who was in a 15-year relationship with the filmmaker Olivier Assayas (\\u201cIrma Vep,\\u201d \\u201cPersonal Shopper\\u201d), shows Chris procrastinating and suffering from extreme writer\\u2019s block, while Tony diligently fills page after page of his notebook with sexually questionable material. Ah, to be an auteur! As Chris, riddled with self-doubt, wastes time exploring the island on her own terms, the more well-known Tony hosts public Q. and A.\\u2019s and fields compliments from devoted fans. And when Chris finally shares the details of her latest idea for a movie, Tony seems distracted.\", \"No matter, Hansen-Love seems to say. If not Tony, the audience will be fully captivated by Chris\\u2019s dream world. A film-within-a-film unfolds, a sweltering romance between a younger couple (Mia Wasikowska and Anders Danielsen Lie) that also takes place on Faro Island and seems to reconfigure Chris\\u2019s frustrations and anxieties into new and visceral form.\", \"Both \\u201cBergman Island\\u201d and \\u201cThe Souvenir Part II\\u201d show an intimate understanding of art\\u2019s liberating potential, the power that fiction and fantasy afford individuals still in search of themselves. These aren\\u2019t exclusively female ventures \\u2014 anyone who understands what it means to be diminished and looked down upon will find solace in the possibility of an alternative, an outlet for self-expression that transforms trauma and fear and insecurity into a source of fulfillment and strength.\", \"Crucially, Julie and Chris aren\\u2019t shown reveling in the success of their films, getting revenge on their male skeptics, or landing multimillion-dollar deals. Their triumphs are private, premised as they are on the satisfaction of creating something true and beautiful in spite of their vulnerable creators \\u2014 Chris falls asleep in Bergman\\u2019s study and awakens in the future as her own film shoot comes to a close, her husband\\u2019s approval and the towering cinematic figure so central to her artistic development a twinkle in the past. We\\u2019re in her territory now.\"]","href_hash":"43f96a2a3cdb11ecbd6c000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"43f96a2a3cdb11ecbd6c000017025a03"}},
