Why, she wondered at the time, did New York City not have a company on the same level as a Nederlands Dans Theater or a Ballet BC?\", \"To be honest, that never really struck me as a problem. The aesthetic direction of those groups \\u2014 choreography with slippery swirls and hollow gestures \\u2014 wasn\\u2019t something I pined for. But Gibney has accomplished what she set out to do: She has established a contemporary repertory company of 12 dancers that made its debut at the Joyce Theater exactly when she planned for it to happen: now.\", \"On Tuesday, the Gibney Company presented three premieres, by Sonya Tayeh, the Tony Award-winning choreographer of \\u201cMoulin Rouge! The Musical\\u201d; Alan Lucien Oyen, the Norwegian writer, director and choreographer; and Rena Butler, Gibney\\u2019s choreographic associate who also dances. (Gibney is the company\\u2019s artistic director, founder and chief executive; Nigel Campbell and Amy Miller are the company directors.)\", \"If not quite an empire, Gibney Company is an enterprise. The dancers are referred to as artistic associates and, in addition to performing, they also contribute as community activists in the dance field.\", \"So where does the art come in? Gibney\\u2019s debut program was overstuffed and at times puerile; after more than two hours of watching hyper-mobile performers bend and flex, I was more depleted than enlightened. Much of the choreography seemed to be generated by similar improvisation exercises. Butler\\u2019s \\u201cLusus Naturae,\\u201d a trio exploring King Kong from the angle of decolonizing the self, was the most illuminating; at times, it could have been more subtle, but at least it was concise.\", \"As Alexander Anderson, Jesse Obremski and Jake Tribus morphed and melted from sculptural lifts into deep, swaying squats, they also crumbled and rose to climb over one another as Earthgang\\u2019s \\u201cMissed Calls\\u201d played. (Darryl J. Hoffman did the sound design.) Eventually, pulling apart, they moved in sync finding a groove \\u2014 and exuding an underlying vulnerability \\u2014 as the lyrics rolled by: \\u201cAnd I suggest you trace your scars if you get lost, my dears.\\u201d\", \"At one point, the dancers even joined in \\u2014 urgently reciting lyrics in tandem from the lip of the stage. Did I sense, in moments, the work of Kyle Abraham, with whom Butler once danced and who was her choreographic adviser on this piece? Sure. But I could also feel her touch in the way softness revealed strength. It was as if they were extinguishing \\u201ckong\\u201d to take ownership of \\u201cking.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cLusus Naturae\\u201d was book-ended by two longer, more ponderous works: Oyen\\u2019s \\u201cThe Game Is Rigged\\u201d and Tayeh\\u2019s \\u201cOh Courage!\\u201d set to an original composition played live by the indie-folk duo, the Bengsons. While \\u201cOh Courage!\\u201d had a raucous side, courtesy of the music, \\u201cThe Game\\u201d was more internal; the cast members spoke (or mumbled) their anguish. Near the start, Leal Zielinska \\u2014 at first smiling and inserting little giggles \\u2014 said, \\u201cWhere is?\\u201d and \\u201cWhere is here?\\u201d She slapped the air around her head, as if she were under a mosquito attack, adding, \\u201cThe game is rigged.\\u201d\", \"It\\u2019s the game, it seems, of life. While these artistic associates were skilled at expressing the fervor of their minds with extreme torque and spasms \\u2014 here and in \\u201cCourage!,\\u201d it was as though they were constantly being electrocuted \\u2014 they were less credible when reciting text while moving.\", \"The dialogue amounted to little more than journal entries. \\u201cThe Game,\\u201d emotionally underwhelming and spiraling forward with seemingly no end in sight \\u2014 it lasted around 45 minutes \\u2014 felt dated, like a dance-theater experiment from the 1990s, seen through the lens of the pandemic and self-isolation. Its biggest mystery was why the women were continually flung around like objects.\", \"If \\u201cThe Game\\u201d was about inner turmoil, \\u201cOh Courage!\\u201d was about finding resilience. \\u201cI\\u2019m coming to you!\\u201d shouted Abigail Bengson, one half of the music duo with her husband, Shaun Bengson. \\u201cPalm open!\\u201d\", \"During what seemed like an evocation \\u2014 it was all a little cultish \\u2014 Butler, arching back and sinking to the floor in deep pli\\u00e9s, made her way to a pile of speakers placed in between the musicians. Standing on them, she waved and rippled her arms. The set, by Rachel Hauck, who designed \\u201cHadestown,\\u201d took up a good portion of the stage, leaving less room for dancing than the creation of tableaux in which the performers, arranging themselves around the musicians, stared meaningfully into the distance.\", \"Directives from Abigail persisted: \\u201cJump the life back into you!\\u201d\", \"As the dance continued, the performers swept back and forth across the stage in unison or rocked in place as if they were about to pounce; their bodies were in a continual stage of wilting and blooming as the singers drove them on, encouraging them to illustrate their courage, their daring.\", \"\\u201cShake these bones!\\u201d Abigail urged, later becoming preacher-feverish in her delivery with the chant, \\u201cHope is an action!\\u201d\", \"The dancers gathered in a tight circle, jumping and reaching toward some unattainable object. Finally, the music stopped, and they parted ways, taking up as much space as they could while lifting off the floor in hops propelled by a leg that swung forward and back. It was a lesson in fortitude \\u2014 all around.\"]","href_hash":"ae8a14ee3cd511ec9d22000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ae8a14ee3cd511ec9d22000017025a03"}},
