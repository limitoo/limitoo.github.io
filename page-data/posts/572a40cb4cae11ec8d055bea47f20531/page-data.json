He then tried to get in the driver's seat, and fought with the officer who tried to get him out of the vehicle.\", \"Womack then disarmed the officer, pointing the gun at both officers, which led to the officer who was still armed shooting and killing Womack, in an incident that began and ended in less than half a minute.\", \"\\\"Those officers had no choice\\u2014this whole incident took place in 26 seconds,\\\" Oakman said, also remarking the incident was all captured on body cameras and the dashcam of the car.\", \"Last year, Womack filed an excessive force lawsuit alleging that Kiowa County Sheriff's Deputy Jeremy Rodriguez intentionally hit him with a car in August 2020, in an incident captured on dashcam video. Rodriguez has denied the allegations and said qualified immunity applies in the case.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below:\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939030/lionel-womack-kansas-city-police.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Lionel Womack, a former Kansas police detective who last year sued a sheriff's deputy for running over him in a rural field, has been fatally shot by a police officer in Kansas City after disarming an officer and pointing a gun at another, police said Tuesday.

His wife and mother are police officers in Kansas City, Kansas, and his stepfather is a retired police sergeant. Two aunts are city police dispatchers.\", \"His wife, Zee Womack, tearfully told the Associated Press that her husband was killed in the altercation and that at least one of the officers involved knew him. She declined to comment further because she is still employed as a Kansas City police officer, and the investigation is ongoing.\", \"\\\"The family of Lionel Womack thanks the members of the Kansas City community for your outpouring of support after their devastating loss yesterday,\\\" said Michael Kuckelman, the attorney representing him in that lawsuit. \\\"They are asking for privacy and your prayers, as they grieve.\\\"\", \"Police spokesman Thomas Tomasic said \\\"we were all friends with the guy,\\\" adding that everybody knew him and nobody had a problem with him.
