Chicago Public Schools, the third-largest US education district, were closed for a third day on Friday amid a teacher walkout over COVID-19 protections.\", \"US and other officials have said schools can be safely opened, especially amid widely available vaccines and boosters, and the CDC on Thursday issued new guidelines for schools on isolation policies.\", \"While the United States is fighting a surge right now, the country will have to face the long-term impacts, Walensky said.\", \"\\\"We are definitely looking at a time ahead of us where COVID ... will be an endemic virus,\\\" the CDC director told NBC.\", \"Officials continue to press vaccinations as the best protection against COVID, although federal mandates requiring them have become politically contentious.\", \"Later on Friday, the US Supreme Court will weigh requests to block President Joe Biden's vaccine mandate for larger employers and a separate similar requirement for healthcare facilities.\\u00a0\", \"The US Food and Drug Administration on Friday shortened the interval between the primary series of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine and a booster dose by a month for people aged 18 or above to at least five months.\", \"The regulatory decision comes days after the agency made a similar move and cut the interval for booster shot eligibility to five months from six for the Pfizer and BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. The Pfizer booster shot has also been authorised for use in children aged 12 to 15.\\u00a0\", \"Reuters\\u00a0\"]","href_hash":"de1cd0926fe911ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"de1cd0926fe911ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
