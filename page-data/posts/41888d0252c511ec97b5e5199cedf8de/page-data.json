NFTs have become increasingly popular, accounting for one-third of online sales, or two percent of the overall art market, according to the database Artprice.\", \"Earlier this month, thousands of cryptocurrency fans \\u2014 calling themselves the ConstitutionDAO \\u2014 pooled their money to bid on an original printing of the Constitution at Sotheby\\u2019s (having raised about $40 million, they lost out to the collector and hedge fund mogul Kenneth C. Griffin, who paid $43.2 million). Last March, the digital artist Beeple (a.k.a. Mike Winkelmann), sold his NFT \\u201cEverydays: The First 5,000 Days\\u201d for $69 million at a Christie\\u2019s online auction.\", \"Longtime collectors remain skeptical of NFTs and art experts say the Particle enterprise is just the latest iteration of a virtual art world that has yet to be proven. \\u201cA work of art is a unique object and collectors who love art want to own the object itself,\\u201d said Megan Fox Kelly, the president of the Association of Professional Art Advisors. \\u201cThe NFT is a separate entity from the object. I think we\\u2019re still in very early days of understanding how these NFTs exist as works of art,\\u201d Kelly added. \\u201cRight now they appear to be investment vehicles, with potentially very significant returns, and the conversations around them are focused on that.\\u201d\", \"The physical Banksy painting \\u201cLove Is in the Air,\\u201d which features the image of a bomb-thrower hurling a bouquet of flowers, is to be exhibited starting Dec. 3 at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Miami, during Art Basel week.\", \"The Banksy was divided into a 100 x 100 grid, resulting in 10,000 unique squares, or Particles, which will be sold as NFTs for about $1,500 each. Every particle represents a minority ownership in the painting and will come with a collector\\u2019s card that shows the whole artwork as well as the particle\\u2019s location on the painting.\", \"Gouzer said that his experience last April selling the artist Urs Fischer\\u2019s first NFT \\u2014 a unique digital token encrypted with the artist\\u2019s signature and individually identified on a blockchain \\u2014 for about $98,000 on his auction app Fair Warning prompted him to explore similar sales. \\u201cI noticed that so many people were interested in art, but had no way to be part of it,\\u201d Gouzer said.\", \"A former chairman of postwar and contemporary art at Christie\\u2019s, Gouzer started the new venture with Shingo Lavine and Adam Lavine, the co-founders of ethos.io, recently rebranded Voyager, which connects financial institutions with the blockchain. The other founders are Philip Eytan, the co-founder and chairman of Voyager, and Oscar Salazar, the founding chief technology officer and chief architect of Uber.\", \"Particle has raised $15 million in seed funding and Gouzer said they would be raising more to expand their inventory. The group was encouraged by the recent example of the ConstitutionDAO, which raised the cryptocurrency Ether for its losing bid. (According to the Verge, the group is now trying to refund the money to backers, and encountering high transaction fees.)\", \"\\u201cThat showed people want to be part of something greater,\\u201d said Shingo Lavine. \\u201cThere is a tremendous appetite for being able to tap into fine art masterpieces and expensive relics.\\u201d\", \"The founders said they are also responding to the widespread desire for ownership. \\u201cThere is a difference between the person who has that image and has downloaded it and the person who owns it and says \\u2018It\\u2019s mine,\\u2019\\u201d Shingo said, adding of NFT buyers, \\u201cPeople are accepting this new narrative of owning things.\\u201d\", \"But legal questions of piracy and fraud in the NFT market have not been tested in the courts, creating an element of risk. Also unclear is whether other countries will recognize the validity of an NFT sale. \\u201cBecause you have these marketplaces, third parties with their own contracts and currency issues it\\u2019s much more complicated from a legal perspective,\\u201d said Diana Wierbicki, a partner and the global head of art law at Withersworldwide.\", \"The company has established the Particle Foundation, a nonprofit that will maintain its purchased artwork and tour it for exhibitions. One percent of its purchases will be donated to the Foundation, which will act as a so-called protective shard, ensuring that no single person can claim possession of the physical painting. \\u201cThe work can never be resold,\\u201d Gouzer said.\", \"Interested buyers may apply starting Dec. 13 and in the meantime can sign up for the waitlist on particlecollection.com. The sale of Banksy units begins the week of January 10 and will be held on the Avalanche blockchain platform. The Particle company says it will try to ensure the units are distributed among different buyers rather than have an individual buyer acquire more than one.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re not selling you the image of the painting,\\u201d said Harold Eytan, Particle\\u2019s chief executive. \\u201cWe\\u2019re selling you this concept of ownership of a piece of the painting, where some buy shares. This is a different collecting experience.\\u201d\", \"As for starting with the Banksy work, Gouzer said the painting\\u2019s rebellious spirit was an apt metaphor for what Particle itself is trying to do \\u2014 challenge the status quo.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s a piece for revolution,\\u201d Gouzer said. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not trying to change the world here, but we are trying to reach a new community, and to compete with some of the biggest collectors in the world.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"41888d0252c511ec97b5e5199cedf8de"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"41888d0252c511ec97b5e5199cedf8de"}},
