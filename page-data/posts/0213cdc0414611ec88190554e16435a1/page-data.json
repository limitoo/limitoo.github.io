The flagellation has come not just from gleeful Republicans, but from many in the Democratic ranks.\", \"Reasons put forward for the party\\u2019s losses included President Biden\\u2019s slipping approval in polls, impressions of a party that is incompetent at governing after months of infighting in Congress, rising inflation and crime in big cities, and tin-eared Democratic campaigns.\", \"One of the least envied jobs in politics at the moment belongs to Representative Sean Patrick Maloney of New York, who as chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee must steer his caucus through the extremely choppy midterm waters. Mr. Biden\\u2019s approval numbers are lower than President Barack Obama\\u2019s were at the same point in his first term, ahead of the 2010 midterms when Democrats lost more than 60 House seats.\", \"In an interview with The New York Times on Monday, Mr. Maloney acknowledged the party\\u2019s challenges, but he rejected the idea that any major stocktaking was needed in terms of the Democratic agenda or the party\\u2019s focus on running against former President Donald J. Trump even without him on the ballot in 2022.\", \"Mr. Maloney maintained that the ground was already shifting in Democrats\\u2019 favor after the House\\u2019s Friday passage of the $1 trillion infrastructure bill, which is headed for the president\\u2019s desk.\", \"Mr. Maloney\\u2019s big takeaway from the electoral thumping was that Democrats need to do a better job getting the message out about their achievements \\u2014 and that starts at the very top, with Mr. Biden. The interview has been lightly edited and condensed.\", \"There are about 50 Democratic-held House seats in congressional districts that President Biden won by less than he carried Virginia. Now that a Republican, Glenn Youngkin, has won the Virginia governor\\u2019s race, is it time for Democrats to make a radical readjustment to save themselves next year?\", \"The results in Virginia and elsewhere ought to be a wake-up call that we\\u2019re not getting the job done on messaging. It starts with the president.\", \"The No. 1 thing is to grow the economy and end the pandemic. But close behind that is telling people what you\\u2019ve done. I think it\\u2019s a fair criticism to say we haven\\u2019t done enough of that, and I think the White House needs to do more. I don\\u2019t think the president has been served well in this regard. It needs to happen right away.\", \"The president needs to get himself out there all around the country and do events in local media markets to punch through these key messages. I think the White House should do 25 presidential events in the next couple months just on infrastructure. And we should do 1,000 congressional events alongside those presidential events.\", \"My message is \\u201cfree Joe Biden.\\u201d That campaign needs to start now before the next crisis takes over the news cycle.\", \"Since Terry McAuliffe\\u2019s loss in Virginia, Democratic strategists have said his efforts to tie Youngkin to Trump \\u2014 virtually his No. 1 campaign issue \\u2014 didn\\u2019t work. You\\u2019ve been advising House members in vulnerable seats to run against \\u201cTrump toxicity without Trump on the ballot.\\u201d Didn\\u2019t we just see why that won\\u2019t be a winning playbook for Democrats in the midterms?\", \"Let\\u2019s unpack that. Glenn Youngkin ran like a teenaged girl in a slasher movie away from Donald Trump. They\\u2019re making fun of him on \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d for how much he tried to run away from Donald Trump.\", \"The competitive congressional districts are in largely suburban swing areas, and in those areas, Glenn Youngkin underperformed Mitt Romney. I think it\\u2019s more complicated than people are saying. Trump\\u2019s toxicity continues to be a tremendous liability with suburban swing voters.\", \"Democrats took the majority in the House in 2018 and the White House in 2020 because of suburban voters. But it would appear that after last week, when Republicans made inroads in suburbs in Virginia, New Jersey and on Long Island, N.Y., that you were only \\u201crenting\\u201d those voters.\", \"Youngkin did better in the suburbs than Trump did, that\\u2019s true. But Kevin McCarthy [the Republican House minority leader] is no Glenn Youngkin. He\\u2019s got 12 of his top recruits spreading the big lie about the election being stolen.\", \"I think what you\\u2019re seeing is that there\\u2019s real damage to the Republican brand in suburban areas and even Glenn Youngkin couldn\\u2019t overcome it. When he was able to add to his totals a strong turnout among the Trump base in rural counties, he was able to beat McAuliffe, but only by two percentage points.\", \"In a competitive congressional district, I think it\\u2019s still very true that the violent attack on the Capitol, spreading conspiracy theories about the pandemic and denying the results of the election are lousy politics.\", \"Youngkin\\u2019s most effective message was that parents have been shut out of influencing how schools are run \\u2014 including everything from school closures to mask mandates to how America\\u2019s racial history is taught. The G.O.P. believes \\u201cparents\\u2019 rights\\u201d is a winning message in 2022. Is it enough for Democrats to do what McAuliffe did, which was to simply say that the critical race theory attacks were a dog whistle for racist voters?\", \"Every House Republican voted against the most important funding for our public schools in decades, which we passed in the $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan in March.\", \"Democrats are the party of education. If we engage on that subject, we\\u2019ll win that debate with Republicans, who are all talk and no action. We will take seriously and respond aggressively to the lies and distortions that Republicans substitute for having good ideas on education, starting with critical race theory.\", \"Representative Abigail Spanberger of Virginia, one of the most endangered Democrats next year, told The Times last week that Biden was elected to put an end to Trump\\u2019s chaos, not to enact sweeping policy changes. \\u201cNobody elected him to be F.D.R.,\\u201d she said.\", \"We just passed the most important infrastructure bill in our country\\u2019s history and it will be wildly popular with voters. I think those comments are already out of date. What is wrong with F.D.R. if you get the achievements?\", \"James Carville, the longtime political strategist, blamed what he called Democrats\\u2019 \\u201cstupid wokeness\\u201d for the losses last week. In deep-blue Minneapolis, voters defeated a measure to replace the Police Department with a public safety department in a year of rising crime, and in deep-blue Seattle, a Republican won the city attorney race against a Democrat who called herself a police abolitionist. Does Carville have a point?\", \"It sounds like he\\u2019s buying into the false choice between fighting for racial justice and public safety. We can do both. Or he\\u2019s buying into a false choice between guaranteeing equal rights for all our citizens or success at the polls.\", \"What bothers me about James Carville\\u2019s remarks is that he\\u2019s glib about the fight for racial equality or full equality for all our citizens. I understand what James is trying to say, but I think it\\u2019s just a false equation. But he did win some elections back in the \\u201990s.\"]","href_hash":"0213cdc0414611ec88190554e16435a1"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0213cdc0414611ec88190554e16435a1"}},
