Parker had spent his entire career under Barry's tutelage, but a series of indifferent performances convinced the former WBO heavyweight champion it was time to move on.\", \"After dismissing Chisora, Parker insists he's buoyed by the room left to improve under Lee, as he charts his way back to the top.\", \"\\\"I didn't get the knockout, but I got too excited a few times when I hurt him,\\\" Parker says.\", \"\\\"The positive thing is we made improvements and adjustments from the first fight. The exciting thing is there's still a lot of work to be done with Andy.\", \"\\\"I just need to take a break now, enjoy time with the family, quality time with my wife and my kids.\", \"\\\"I think I needed more time with Andy - the first fight was after a short time. I think, with longer time, more time together, you can see the improvements.\", \"\\\"I think the next camp we'll keep working, keep improving [and] get better.\\\"\", \"That excitement goes both ways. While still a relative unknown as a trainer, Lee's pedigree is undeniable and he boasts current WBC heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury among his admirers.\", \"\\\"It's just about being consistent, going for a knockout,\\\" Lee says. \\\"It's heavyweight boxing, being spiteful.\", \"\\\"Joe followed instructions perfectly in the fight and did exactly what we did in the gym, but there were still mistakes, still lots to improve on and that's exciting for me.\", \"\\\"I'd say we're about at 50 percent in our journey. There's still a lot more to come.\\\"\", \"For now, the big question will be what next for Team Parker. The Kiwi will understandably take some time off over Christmas and New Year to be with his family - unable to return to New Zealand, due to the MIQ lottery system.\", \"A world title shot against either Fury or Oleksandr Usyk is unlikely, both facing mandatory fights in defence of their world titles, before any prospective unification fight.\", \"But Matchroom Boxing promoter Eddie Hearn has no shortage of names whom Parker could face in the meantime, as he builds towards another tilt at one of the heavyweight belts.\", \"\\\"For me, no-one's going to get a world title shot until later in the year,\\\" Hearn says.\", \"\\\"He's boxed twice - once in May, once in December. It's nice to stay active.\", \"\\\"I'd like to see him fight in Australia or New Zealand. There's so many fights he could have.\", \"\\\"You've got [Filip] Hrgovic in a final eliminator - a tough fight, but it gives you the key to the world title in a big split with the IBF.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"You've got an Andy Ruiz rematch, you've got Deontay Wilder or Dillian Whyte, after he knocks out Tyson Fury. We'll have to see.\", \"\\\"I think he's in a great position. It's one thing winning, but it's winning well in exciting fights - that's the difference.\", \"\\\"Joseph Parker won tonight and makes people want to watch him again. We'll see what Mr Higgins says.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I like the idea of, if you want to stay active, fight at home.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"2a689f2d609611ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2a689f2d609611ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
