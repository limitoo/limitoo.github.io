I\\u2019m not an expert in literally anything and if I had to pick ONE thing to know a LOT about, I\\u2019ve decided that thing is going to be Prince. I\\u2019m a lifelong Prince fan, but am only super familiar with his stuff from the \\u201970s and \\u201980s and completely fell off with his weirder work from the 2000s. I want to listen to every bootleg European live show recording and every secret rehearsal jam session, watch all the \\u2018unreleased\\u2019 short films/videos that leaked out, read/listen to/watch everything I can get my hands on. This is an open call to anyone who used to follow him around on tour to send me links. I\\u2019m open to it all and I\\u2019m getting a new hard drive for Prince stuff and Prince stuff ALONE!!\\u201d \\u2014 Sarah Sherman, 28, comedian, actress and \\u201cSaturday Night Live\\u201d cast member\", \"\\u201cI like to do things with my hands. I\\u2019ve wanted to take piano lessons for years, but something edible always gets in the way, like that one time I spent months, and an unmentionable amount of rice flour, on creating the perfect gluten-free biscuit. While there\\u2019s no way to ever learn all there is to know in the culinary world, I certainly don\\u2019t see why food and music can\\u2019t make acquaintances. I guess what I\\u2019m trying to say is that I\\u2019d love to keep my hands busy with something my mouth can\\u2019t eat but my ears can.\\u201d \\u2014 Sophia Roe, 33, chef, writer and Emmy-nominated TV host\", \"\\u201cOne thing I\\u2019m dying to try is cooking the food that\\u2019s already in my fridge. I don\\u2019t need it to become a habit. I just want to try it. Just once. Just once in my stupid, pointless life I\\u2019d like to skip the takeout and say to myself, \\u2018OK you self-righteous, needy, two-faced, unfunny, lecherous baritone, eat your groceries.\\u2019 That might sound small, but I believe in being gentle with myself.\\u201d \\u2014 Cole Escola, 35, comedian and actor\", \"\\u201cI was thinking about New Year\\u2019s resolutions and how everyone wants to be fit and look great and also feel young. And the one thing I\\u2019d like to try that I\\u2019ve never done that will help me feel young in some ways is TikTok. Opera is in a constant state of emergency and TikTok has a thinly-veiled chaos. So I think there\\u2019s some similarities, but to be an opera singer, you have to live this very disciplined life. And I\\u2019m attracted and drawn to the kind of spontaneity that seems like it\\u2019s required for TikTok. And I\\u2019m always trying to get insight into what different communities and different generations are thinking and try to find bridges between that and this kind of seemingly foreboding world of classical music.\\u201d \\u2014 Anthony Roth Costanzo, 39, Grammy-nominated opera singer with the Metropolitan Opera and artist-in-residence at the New York Philharmonic\", \"\\u201cI think 2022 is maybe going to be the year that I learn how to drive. I never learned how to drive. My wife and I bought a car during the first pandemic summer, and I have been insisting to her ever since that I would learn how to drive it. And I think as much as I love being driven, I think it\\u2019s finally time that I need to learn how to contribute my weight.\\u201d \\u2014 Mars Hobrecker, 28, tattoo artist \", \"\\u201cI want to learn how to cook. I think as a 45-year-old man, it\\u2019s embarrassing that I don\\u2019t know how to cook. Because right now, if society collapses, all I could do is tell jokes, and I don\\u2019t know if that\\u2019s going to get the job done. I want to have something tangible to offer. Right now I can make scrambled eggs, and I used to be able to make spaghetti really good. Oh yeah, and toast. People underestimate the technique involved to make the perfect toast, and I am not one of those people. I take it very seriously: The thing about toast is you want to put the dial between 2 and 3, and then you want to push it down, but you cannot let it pop out. You have to look at it. And just when you see a little bit of brown on there, that\\u2019s when you pop it up. You want it to be firm and yet soft in the middle, so then you could put that butter on there.\\u201d \\u2014 Bashir Salahuddin, 45, writer, comedian and co-creator and star of \\u201cSouth Side\\u201d on HBO Max\", \"\\u201cHaving just moved to the seaside in southeastern England, I plan to do my laps in the ocean. I\\u2019d been convinced this would involve a wet suit, but I now see that\\u2019s not the done thing and everyone around here just braves the cold water. There were a bunch of Christmas Day swimmers (they dashed in then huddled under blankets), and I didn\\u2019t join, so not a great start. I may also (or instead) devote time to the local refugee community group, who aid those who arrive at this shore in search of safety and a new start.\\u201d \\u2014 Jeremy Atherton Lin, 47, author of \\u201cGay Bar\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThis year I would like to learn a martial art or combat sport. Certainly for fitness and more bodily control, but also as a new way of relating to and being inside of the body. Currently deciding between Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai. I think that combat sports are great for most people, even for a new mind-body experience. I write every day, and a large portion of each day is centered in stillness, so I would love something very present and exhilarating in a completely different way!\\u201d \\u2014 Yrsa Daley-Ward, 37, author of \\u201cBone,\\u201d \\u201cThe Terrible\\u201d and \\u201cThe How: Notes on the Great Work of Meeting Yourself\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"ed164f286d7911ec8be16bbca41a25bd"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ed164f286d7911ec8be16bbca41a25bd"}},
