number of COVID-19 patients has been sitting at about 300 for the past few weeks, but intensive care clinicians aren't expecting it to drop by much as the pandemic enters its third year.","country":"au","create_time":"2021-12-10T20:26:35.000Z","content":"[\"For weeks, there's been an encouraging direction to Victoria's COVID-19 hospitalisation figures.\", \"From the October peak of 851 they've dropped\\u00a0to around 300,\\u00a0where they've largely stayed for the past couple of weeks.\", \"But what does it mean if that hospitalisation number doesn't drop any lower as the state heads into its third year of the pandemic?\", \"For senior intensive care specialist Jamie Cooper, it means another year of strain on exhausted teams at the Alfred Hospital, who have already made extraordinary sacrifices to ensure every COVID-19 patient that needs an ICU bed can get one.\", \"\\\"The next 12 months is going to be, I think, very, very demanding because I don't see any real sign that COVID is going to go away,\\\" Professor Cooper said.\", \"Simple figures at his hospital tell the story: 40 ICU beds have had to expand to 65, and 400 ICU nursing staff have swelled to 600.\", \"He said he had been struck by the dedication and care of all the eager junior nurses who had come forward, and the supervising nurses and doctors who for two years now had trained and looked after those junior staff.\", \"Professor Cooper said it had been harder in Victoria than in New South Wales, due to the state having \\\"substantially fewer\\\" ICU beds per head of population.\", \"That observation is reflected in a 2021 nationwide survey of ICU capacity, which found New South had roughly 10.8 staffed ICU beds per 100,000 people compared to 7.1 in Victoria.\", \"\\\"But we have managed, with all the things that we've been able to do like shifting nursing staff and reconfiguring intensive care units,\\\" Professor Cooper said.\", \"The Austin Hospital's Rinaldo Bellomo is also preparing for another year of sustained demand.\", \"The senior intensive care clinician and researcher\\u00a0estimates there are roughly 400,000 unvaccinated Victorians at increased risk of ending up in ICU if, or when, they catch COVID-19.\", \"He said another year of similar demand on Victoria's ICUs would be sustainable \\u2014 but only because there was no other option.\", \"Professor Bellomo said some workers would probably resign due to the ongoing pressure.\", \"\\\"I don't think the community fully understands how difficult it is for nurses working long shifts in full PPE and small spaces,\\\" he said.\", \"The harm done by overloaded ICUs\\u00a0is\\u00a0felt by many, including those on ballooning elective surgery waiting lists, as the government imposes\\u00a0capacity limits and freezes.\", \"On\\u00a0Thursday\\u00a0there was a note of optimism there, as the state government announced up to 75 per cent of surgeries, including cosmetic surgeries, could resume at private hospitals across the state from December 15.\", \"The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons'\\u00a0Matthew Hadfield said it was a welcome development that was urgently needed to prevent a backlog of surgeries from building up.\", \"\\\"We're of the opinion that in this stable environment, it's quite possible to fully utilise the non-public hospital operating facilities to try and keep on top of things,\\\" he said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Almost all of the ICU patients are unvaccinated</div>\", \"Despite clouds of uncertainty over the introduction of Omicron, there is one thing intensive care clinicians know could turn the tide.\", \"\\\"Ninety-four per cent of intensive care patients with COVID are not double vaxxed,\\\" Professor Cooper said.\", \"Professor Cooper said many of the remaining patients who were double-vaccinated had underlying complications including immunosuppression, or had only recently received their second dose and were yet to benefit from the full immune response it triggered.\", \"He said many of his intensive care colleagues had shared the by-now familiar accounts of those previously adamant about their rejection of vaccines pleading to be given one at the point of intubation.\", \"\\\"And the doctors just have to say, it's too late, you can't have it,\\\" he said.\", \"Professor Bellomo said it was \\\"very upsetting\\\" to see unvaccinated patients dying in ICU, when \\\"two little mosquito bites\\\" of vaccination shots could have prevented it.\", \"\\\"Protect yourself, the people you love and the community,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"Vaccinate and get a booster next year. You really do not want to end up in ICU.\\\"\", \"While there's lots we still don't know about the Omicron variant beginning to circulate in Victoria, early evidence suggests a third mRNA vaccine booster shot will make a big difference in protecting people from severe illness.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Doctors are still learning the long-term cost of a trip to ICU\\u00a0</div>\", \"Doctors are still learning about the full cost borne by COVID-19 survivors who end\\u00a0up in ICU and receive\\u00a0some of the most dramatic interventions.\", \"Ventilation is one thing, but at the far end is ECMO, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\", \"Large catheters are inserted into an artery and a vein, and the patient's blood is artificially oxygenated outside the body and pushed back in, doing the work of the heart and lungs.\", \"It's something only attempted after ventilation has failed, with the patient placed into an induced coma.\", \"Most patients on ECMO treatment will need it for about a month, and will remain in hospital for several weeks afterwards to recover from the ordeal.\", \"At the peak of the recent third wave, there were 18 patients on ECMO at the Alfred Hospital.\\u00a0That's since fallen to about 10.\", \"\\\"So it's a high-demand thing, as you can imagine,\\\" Professor Cooper said.\", \"In the midst of the pandemic, Professor Cooper and Professor Bellomo helped lead the creation of a national COVID intensive care registry, to track the outcomes for the most critically ill patients.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/bc2ce12d102fef7658f6ac999aeca4e2\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Intensive care clinicians Jamie Cooper (left) and Rinaldo Bellomo's research collaboration was recognised with one of Australia's most prestigious research prizes this week.(Supplied)</div>\", \"Rapidly, the teams have been able to pair up researchers and clinicians and have produced globally significant treatment trials which have led to published papers in the world's most prestigious medical journals.\", \"This week the collaborative research effort earned national recognition as winner of the 2021\\u00a0GSK Award for Research Excellence.\", \"Professor Cooper said results from the second wave last year showed that about 75 per cent of the patients put onto ECMO treatment survived, making it a \\\"very worthwhile\\\" treatment.\", \"The team is still waiting to see how ICU patients in the current wave will fare when it comes to their experience of \\\"long COVID\\\".\", \"\\\"Many of the patients are still in hospitals, particularly those who are on ECMO \\u2026 their long-term outcomes won't become clear until time passes and all of them come off all of the supports,\\\" Professor Cooper said.\", \"\\\"But it seems very similar to the second wave which which is well and truly completed in terms of their substantial survival, which is\\u00a0great.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/72f313d9f7f5c33fbe32f5bf4d22d280\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Why we hear about some COVID-19 variants more than others</div>\"]","href_hash":"682140c859f711ec9006252ba2d45082"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"682140c859f711ec9006252ba2d45082"}},
