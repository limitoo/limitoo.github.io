A federal judge must still approve the settlement.\", \"The approximate $4.4 million payment, which is the largest monetary settlement the DOJ has acquired in a case alleging sexual harassment in housing, will be distributed through a compensation fund, the DOJ said. On top of the settlement, Centanni must also pay a $107,000 civil penalty to the government.\", \"Centanni owned many properties around the city of Elizabeth that accept federal Section 8 housing vouchers, according to the lawsuit. In exchange for helping residents keep their housing or giving rent assistance, he allegedly demanded oral sex. He also allegedly threatened to evict those who denied him.\", \"The lawsuit said that Centanni would frequently take tenants or potential tenants to empty apartments or storage rooms and request massages, expose himself, and force them to sexually touch him. On Tuesday, the DOJ said the total number of victims is in the dozens, although more could be identified.\", \"\\\"The need for housing is a basic human need,\\\" said acting U.S. Attorney of the District of New Jersey Rachael A. Honig, NJ.com reported. \\\"Joseph Centanni exploited that need, and the important federal programs that attempt to meet it, by threatening to deny his victims a roof over their heads if they did not submit to his demands for sexual acts.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1951990/joseph-centanni-settlement-sexual-harassment-housing.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The lawsuit said that Joseph Centanni, a landlord, would frequently take tenants or potential tenants to empty apartments or storage rooms and request massages, expose himself, and force them to sexually touch him.
