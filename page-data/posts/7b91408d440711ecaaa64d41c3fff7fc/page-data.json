Asa Hutchinson has officially supported Sarah Sanders' campaign for Arkansas governor. Although several Democrats are running for the spot, Sanders is now the only Republican campaigning after Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge dropped out of the race earlier this week.\", \"\\\"Sarah has earned the Republican nomination and I'm delighted today to endorse her for governor,\\\" Hutchinson said in a statement. \\\"The state of Arkansas will be in good hands with Sarah as governor, and she has my full support.\\\"\", \"Rutledge also backed Sanders after she left the race, saying that the former White House press secretary \\\"will stand strong against the onslaught of the liberal left's attack on our home state.\\\"\", \"Other endorsements that Sanders will run with include Lieutenant Governor Tim Griffin, Senators Tom Cotton and John Boozman, and former President Donald Trump. The politician, who is also the daughter of former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee, served as the Trump administration's press secretary from 2017 to 2019, being succeeded by Stephanie Grisham.

Scientists quickly began to praise the results of Operation Warp Speed, but by then the damage was already done.
