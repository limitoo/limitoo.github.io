At home, don't advertise on social media that you are, or will be, away and try to leave your home looking lived in by having neighbours clear your mailbox and keeping an eye on your home,\\\" he says.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Fit an alarm and keep valuables out of sight. Security cameras are increasingly affordable and are a great deterrent.\", \"\\\"Every Christmas, insurers payout to put things right following thefts, loss and damage.
