[Corrections staff] worked really hard and fast and really quickly to try and contain what was happening, to try and get the prisoners to safety,\\\" he said.\", \"Since the destruction of the building, prisoners and staff have had to be transferred to other jails. All hot meals are now cooked at Springhill Prison in North Waikato and taken to Waikeria.\", \"Whitley said Waikeria was now a vastly different place.\", \"''They only have only got low security prisoners. A lot of staff from there are assisting at other prisons around the country that were short-staffed.\", \"\\\"There are staff working up at Springhill at the moment. So they are left in a little bit of a quandary of what was going to happen. They were staffed for quite a large prison, half of it disappeared.''\", \"The construction of a new 500-bed facility was well underway at the time of the riot and is due to open in 2023.\", \"Could a similar riot happen again in a New Zealand prison?\", \"Whitley cannot rule it out.\", \"''Prisons aren't nice playgrounds. They can be violent places. Staff show a lot of courage doing what they do on a daily basis, so you never know what is going to happen to be honest.''\", \"Tamatea agrees. ''Prisons, especially high-security sites - let alone remand units - contain folk that aren't run of the mill people necessarily with run of the mill issues.\", \"\\\"Remand units in particular are quite susceptible to specific kinds of stress. For instance prisoners on remand face a lot of uncertainty. On top of the uncertainty of being in a prison environment there is life-plans and adjustments that need to be kind of considered.''\", \"A total of $1.3m was paid out to prisoners and staff at Waikeria who lost belongings in the prison fire.\", \"Seventeen prisoners have been charged in relation to the riot and protest and they are due back in court in March.\", \"An independent report from the Prison Inspectorate is yet to be released.\"]","href_hash":"c79c5adb685111ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c79c5adb685111ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
