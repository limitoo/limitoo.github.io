Thirty-five deaths have been attributed to the virus over the past 24 hours, increasing the country's overall death toll to 3,363.\", \"The increase in cases could be attributed to the country loosening social distancing measures. Despite Reuters reporting that 80.8 percent of the country's population has been fully vaccinated, the majority of those infected are either unvaccinated or seeing their immunities decrease since the vaccine rollout in February.\", \"Many patients that have been checked into hospitals or intensive care units are over age 60. The Ministry of Health and Welfare is currently considering re-enacting measures to decrease the number of cases.\", \"\\\"The rise in serious cases has been considerably higher than what we had expected,\\\" Son Youngrae of the Health Ministry said in a briefing.\", \"In addition to potential new measures, officials are encouraging booster shots. According to Son, a rise in breakthrough cases is being reported among fully vaccinated older people. Orders to designate more hospital beds in Seoul for virus patients have been issued.\", \"For more reporting from The Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939666/south-korean-woman.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">South Korea is experiencing a rapid surge in COVID-19 cases, most of which were reported in the Seoul area.

In allowing larger social gatherings and longer indoor dining hours at restaurants, officials had hoped that improving vaccination rates would keep hospitalizations and deaths down even if the virus continues to spread.\", \"Officials are now creating plans to share hospital capacities between the greater Seoul area and other regions with smaller outbreaks to prevent hospital systems from being overwhelmed.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1939671/south-korea-covid-testing.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">South Korea is experiencing a rapid surge in COVID-19 cases, most of which were reported in the country's capital area.
