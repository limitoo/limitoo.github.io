The Senate confirmed 18 federal judges in Donald Trump’s first year.","country":"us","create_time":"2021-12-18T22:42:06.000Z","content":"[\"WASHINGTON \\u2014 The Senate confirmed President Biden\\u2019s 40th federal judicial nominee early on Saturday morning, the most judges confirmed in a president\\u2019s first year in the last 40 years.\", \"In a pre-dawn mad dash before leaving Washington for the holidays, lawmakers confirmed 10 district court judges, bringing the year-end total to 40 and notching an achievement not seen since former President Ronald Reagan. It underscored how the White House has set a rapid pace in filling vacancies on the federal bench, even besting the records set by the Trump administration, which maintained a laser focus on reshaping the judiciary.\", \"The milestone came as a welcome victory for frustrated congressional Democrats whose legislative agenda continues to hit roadblock after roadblock, including their attempts to pass Mr. Biden\\u2019s signature social safety net, climate and tax bill, and their efforts to bolster voting rights and overhaul immigration.\", \"The Senate confirmed 18 circuit and district court judges in President Donald J. Trump\\u2019s first year in office, and 12 in President Barack Obama\\u2019s inaugural year.\", \"Mr. Biden, a former chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, pledged to counter the Trump era\\u2019s aggressive efforts to transform the judiciary with young right-wing judges who are mostly white and male. Since January, the president has sent the Senate an extraordinarily diverse roster of nominees, both in terms of ethnic background and professional experience.\", \"Many of the nominees confirmed were \\u201cfirsts\\u201d \\u2014 including the first Muslim American federal judge and the first openly lesbian judge to serve on any federal circuit court. And Mr. Biden\\u2019s administration has also taken pains to nominate not just corporate attorneys, but public defenders and civil right attorneys.\", \"\\u201cBecause of the commitment to restoring the federal judiciary by President Biden and Senate Democrats,\\u201d said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, \\u201cit is no longer a bench that is simply prosecutors, partners in large law firms \\u2014 but rather many, many others from walks of life with different and needed perspectives on the federal bench, such as public defenders, civil rights lawyers, election experts and more.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Biden and Mr. Schumer \\u201cnot only shepherded more confirmations in Biden\\u2019s first year than any president in recent history; they have led a revolution in the way Democrats think about who should serve as judges by selecting lawyers who have represented everyday people,\\u201d said Christopher Kang, the chief counsel of Demand Justice, a progressive advocacy group that was created after the 2016 presidential election and the Republican stonewalling of Mr. Obama\\u2019s final Supreme Court nominee.\", \"The rapid speed of confirmations this year came despite an evenly divided Senate, with Vice President Kamala Harris serving as a tiebreaker. But like Mr. Biden\\u2019s legislative agenda, his judicial agenda is also facing challenges of its own.\", \"Democrats have overwhelmingly racked up judicial victories in states represented by two Democratic senators. They are facing stronger headwinds in states represented by at least one Republican senator. Tennessee Republicans have already raised objections to Mr. Biden\\u2019s pick for an influential appeals court there, the administration\\u2019s first judicial nominee from a state represented by two Republican senators.\", \"Beyond Republican-led efforts to slow-walk such nominees, Mr. Biden is also facing limited appellate vacancies from Republican appointees \\u2014 which means he has little room to reshape the ideological balance of the courts. Of the appellate nominees Mr. Biden has named, only three of 10 would replace Republican appointees.\", \"At the moment, the vacancies Mr. Biden is facing in the appeals courts are those created by Democratic appointees, said Russell Wheeler, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies the federal courts. \\u201cSo far, the percentage of Republican appointees on the court of appeals is almost unchanged from when Biden took office,\\u201d he said.\", \"The greatest threat the administration\\u2019s effort may face, however, is the risk of losing control of the Senate in the 2022 midterm elections. Mr. Wheeler noted that Mr. Trump had nominated 54 circuit court judges over four years with a Republican-controlled Senate.\", \"\\u201cIf Biden loses the Senate, it\\u2019s not going to be talking about \\u2018How many appointees,\\u2019\\u201d Mr. Wheeler said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s going to be talking about whether there\\u2019s going to be any at all.\\u201d\", \"In total, Mr. Biden has sent 71 judicial nominees to the Senate for consideration.\", \"The Senate also early Saturday confirmed on a voice vote 41 ambassadors, including Rahm Emanuel, the former mayor of Chicago, as U.S. ambassador to Japan. That vote came about as part of a deal with Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, who had blocked the nominees in his push for a vote on sanctions over a Russian-backed gas pipeline. After Mr. Cruz finally won a promise for a vote on the sanctions, Mr. Schumer was able to push the nominees through.\"]","href_hash":"8c6514c6605311ecb77dd9a53978a70c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8c6514c6605311ecb77dd9a53978a70c"}},
