There was also the current Australian women's sevens captain,\\\" Gaze said.\", \"The World Schools Sevens has grown year on year, though Gaze said the 2021 version was pushed back to this weekend by the pandemic.\", \"\\\"Prior to Covid we had 17 teams from around the world. We had Canada, Japan, Fiji, USA, Tonga, Australia, Australian Indigenous as well as our New Zealand based teams. So, pre-Covid, we were heading towards 40 or 50 teams.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/284742/eight_col_barbarians_5.jpg?1642701934\\\" alt=\\\"NZ Asian Barbarians train ahead of World Schools Sevens tournament, 2022.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nPhoto: Supplied\\n</div>\", \"With Aotearoa's borders closed, this year's tournament will have 20 teams, including a Samoan, Tongan, Niuean, Cook Islands and Fijian side, made up of entirely New Zealand based players.\", \"Gaze said the Warriors rugby league club have entered a team and the very first NZ Asian Barbarians side has been created.\", \"\\\"It's probably a first to have a NZ Asian side actually playing within a New Zealand tournament. From a New Zealand Rugby (NZR) perspective, it may even open up their eyes to go 'wow' there are so many Asian players that are playing in New Zealand and it's time to give them an opportunity.\\\"\", \"Gaze said the tournament gives players a chance to represent their country of heritage.\", \"\\\"Kids get to play for their culture and they get to experience their culture. They often go into camp for a week. So, it's an amazing time for them to go back to the roots of their parents or grandparents. It's a pretty special week for a lot of them.\\\"\", \"The Asian Barbarians will be able to access a wealth of sevens knowledge from former long time New Zealand coach Tietjens.\", \"\\\"A little bit of history. There's the Samoans have got a team and Tonga and Fiji etc and with this Asian team as well, there's a lot of raw talent there and it does make the tournament really exciting,\\\" Tietjens said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/284740/eight_col_Barbarians_3.jpg?1642701879\\\" alt=\\\"NZ Asian Barbarians ahead of World Schools Sevens tournament, 2022.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nThe Asian Barbarians are sponsored by Japanese sports wear company, Samurai Sports. \\nPhoto: Supplied\\n</div>\", \"It's also exciting for the players, including 18-year-old Jordi Viljoen of Hastings Boys' High.\", \"\\\"One hundred percent. It's a pretty special moment to get the Asian heritage out there and hopefully we do well in the tournament and get a NZ Asian girls team in the competition next year.\\\"\", \"Viljoen isn't Asian, but has been given a chance with the team. He's South African and his Dad Joggie played halfback for the Springboks before relocating to Manawat\\u016b with his family when Jordi was two.\", \"The younger Viljoen said meeting Tietjens this week is something he will never forget.\", \"\\\"That was an unreal moment, just seeing him in person. You don't even have to be around him for very long and you just have so much respect for him and you can really see the boys fully focused when he's talking. It's been pretty special to be coached by him.\\\"\", \"Viljeon's sentiments are shared by his Asian Barbarians team-mate Max Ogata-Johnston of Christchurch Boys' High, who has Japanese heritage.\", \"\\\"I was pretty nervous to meet him (Tietjens) haha. It was a great honour and I was pretty excited to come up to Auckland. He's been around the block and knows his stuff!\\\"\", \"Ogata-Johnston is also enjoying being around other players with Japanese links, sharing experiences, culture and food.\", \"\\\"I didn't get very much of that in the First XV at Christchurch Boys', but there's a few Japanese boys here (Asian Barbarians) and it's really cool. It's very special being part of this team and I think the Asian Barbarians will just grow from here. It's great being able to represent Japan in a way.\\\"\", \"While Viljoen has his sights set on higher honours, he plays the game for a simple and honest reason.\", \"\\\"Everyone who goes hard in sevens would love to play for the All Blacks Sevens or whatever country or culture they're from. That's one of my goals. But, being able to say you're having lots of fun playing footy is probably the main thing.\\\"\", \"The tournament starts on Saturday, with the boys and girls finals on Sunday afternoon.\"]","href_hash":"9e87611a7a5511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9e87611a7a5511ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
