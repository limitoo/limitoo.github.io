One of the sisters tells us that. They all talk a lot, though very little about grief.\", \"Something is clearly wrong. The sisters are anxious and depressed. They can\\u2019t always tell one another apart; their own identities aren\\u2019t stable. One sister has become allergic to the sun. The water isn\\u2019t clean. They have many ideas about how to fix the problems: doctors and diets, new lighting and other purchases and changes of scene, vacations to exotic locales or just a retreat to the room of the title.\", \"Even without a program note, you might guess from the sisters\\u2019 speech and from the interior d\\u00e9cor that we are in the early 1980s \\u2014 a 1980s that hasn\\u2019t ended. The production, which Big Dance Theater debuted at BAM Fisher on Tuesday, takes its text from \\u201cFive Sisters,\\u201d a 1982 work by the Conceptual artist Guy de Cointet. Born and raised in France, he lived in Los Angeles and captured the self-absorption of some of the city\\u2019s inhabitants with a mixture of amusement and alarm.\", \"In a program note, Parson calls de Cointet \\u201can artistic soul mate,\\u201d and it is remarkable how much his text seems to call for her customary approach. Roaming an elegantly tacky interior of fringe curtains and beige carpeting (kudos to the designer Lauren Machen), the sisters emphasize the artificiality of their speech, drawn from commercials and soap operas and bits of Chekhov\\u2019s \\u201cThree Sisters,\\u201d all treated equally. Often before underlining a word, they pause and pose.\", \"That pausing and posing is pure Parson. The sisters dance a lot here, sometimes in girl-group formation, step-touching as a disco ball revolves. But every second of the show is tightly choreographed, tightly controlled, down to how they hold their water glasses and dangle their feet. The anxious mood derives from this exertion of control, especially as the sisters react to and remark upon shifts in light and sound.\", \"The addition of music by the experimental laptop artist Holly Herndon is an inspired choice. Full of vintage noises, it\\u2019s like a spliced memory reel of the era, echoing Laurie Anderson without sampling or recognizable quotation. The sisters keep characterizing it differently (\\u201cwhat odd music,\\u201d \\u201cwhat thoughtful music\\u201d) and yet accurately.\", \"The cast is also expert: Kate Moran as the sister with the sun allergy, Elizabeth DeMent as the sleepy-eyed workaholic, Myssi Robinson as the clean-lined dancer with hearing and hip problems, Michelle Sui as the painter. Theda Hammel, appearing briefly without the other sisters, introduces a welcome, looser humor \\u2014 at once the most Chekhovian and contemporary, dishing about a guy she\\u2019s met, rearranging household objects before saying, \\u201cThat\\u2019s how I remember it.\\u201d\", \"That earns a laugh, but otherwise, humor is thinly spread. Across an hour, sisters accumulate and one finally leaves, but nobody really changes. Which is the point, a static point perhaps more suited to museums and art galleries than a theater. The program note cites \\u201cthe enduring damage of the Reagan era\\u201d and consumerism consuming civic engagement, but the production doesn\\u2019t carry that much political weight. Yes, such people as these sisters exist, in Los Angeles and in all of us. The question is: Are you in the mood to spend time with them?\"]","href_hash":"8225d80952cd11ec9cede12ea1232b67"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8225d80952cd11ec9cede12ea1232b67"}},
