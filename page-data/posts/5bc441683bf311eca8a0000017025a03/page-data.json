Consciousness is what distinguishes being awake from being in a coma or a state of dreamless sleep. I am now conscious, and so (presumably) are you. Many animals \\u2014 probably all mammals \\u2014 have conscious minds, but plants and bacteria do not. Nor do computers (so far). Nor do stars, or rocks.\", \"Why is consciousness important? Well, in a way, it\\u2019s the basis of everything that\\u2019s important. Without consciousness, there would be no pleasure or pain; no good or evil; no experiences of beauty, or of love. In a universe that never evolved conscious minds, nothing would matter.\", \"Intimately familiar though we are with it, consciousness confronts us with a mystery. It doesn\\u2019t readily fit into our scientific conception of the world. Consciousness seems to be caused by neural firings in our brains. But how can these objective electrochemical events give rise to ineffable qualitative experiences, like the smell of a rose, the stab of a pain or the transport of joy? Why, when a physical system attains a certain degree of complexity, is it \\u201clike something\\u201d to be that system?\", \"This is the \\u201chard problem\\u201d of consciousness: the problem of how subjective mind arises from brute matter. (There is also an \\u201ceasy problem,\\u201d that of determining what role consciousness plays in the information-processing economy of the mind. But one thing at a time.)\", \"In the last few decades, the mystery of consciousness has exercised thinkers of all stripes, sometimes driving them to rather desperate-sounding devices. Philosophers (Thomas Nagel, David Chalmers) have flirted with \\u201cpanpsychism,\\u201d the idea that consciousness might be a fundamental ingredient of all matter, right down to the atomic level. The Nobel-laureate physicist Roger Penrose has speculated that some kind of quantum magic might be behind it. In his mega-best-selling \\u201cG\\u00f6del, Escher, Bach,\\u201d the computer scientist Douglas Hofstadter argued that consciousness arises when the brain becomes intricate enough to form self-referential \\u201cstrange loops\\u201d \\u2014 neural equivalents of G\\u00f6del\\u2019s notorious formula that says, \\u201cI am not provable.\\u201d\", \"Meanwhile, neuroscientists have tried to understand consciousness as a biological phenomenon \\u2014 like, say, digestion. Using brain-imaging and other empirical techniques, they have sought out the neural signatures of conscious thought within the gray spongy matter in our skulls. Among them have been the Nobel laureates Francis Crick and Gerald Edelman, each of whom produced a book outlining his own favored take on consciousness. Today, one of the most distinguished researchers working along these lines is Antonio Damasio, a Portuguese American who holds a chair in neuroscience at the University of Southern California.\", \"\\u201cFeeling & Knowing\\u201d represents a distillation of themes Damasio has explored in earlier books, which include \\u201cDescartes\\u2019 Error\\u201d (1994) and \\u201cSelf Comes to Mind\\u201d (2010). The most prominent of his preoccupations is the importance of feeling. It is feeling, he thinks, that can bridge the conceptual abyss between the physical body and the conscious mind.\", \"Before getting down to substance, a word about style. In a prologue, Damasio tells us that readers of his earlier books often missed the key ideas amid all the scientific details. So he set out to write \\u201ca focused and very brief book on consciousness.\\u201d Brief the new book is: It consists of 40-odd sections, some less than a page long, surrounded by ample white space. Each of these mini-chapters reads rather like a prose poem \\u2014 often soaring to lyrical heights, though sometimes weighted down by bits of neuroscientific argot. \\u201cFocused,\\u201d though, is not the mot juste for it: Despite its brevity, it can be meandering and repetitious (\\u201cFeelings again, must we? We must indeed\\u201d). Crucial ideas often lie enshrouded in an elegant mist of metaphor. Still, the quality of the author\\u2019s mind, the boldness of his aims and the suspense of his argument propelled me through the book.\", \"Put with brutal succinctness, Damasio\\u2019s brief goes like this: Mental activity consists of a stream of \\u201cimages\\u201d that map aspects of the world around us. But these images, by themselves, cannot be conscious. For that, they must be related to a perspective, an \\u201cowner,\\u201d a self \\u2014 this, after all, is what subjectivity means. And here is where feeling comes in. As Damasio uses the term, \\u201cfeelings\\u201d are \\u201cthe hybrid, interactive processes of the interior, at once mental and physical.\\u201d They register how well or badly its various subsystems are doing at maintaining homeostasis, at keeping the organism alive and flourishing. So feelings point within, to the interior; images point without, to the world. And when feelings and images come together in the brain, the result is conscious thought. To adapt a simile of Damasio\\u2019s, feelings are like a musical score that, when added to the silent reel of images in the mind, produces cinematic consciousness.\", \"This is Damasio\\u2019s solution to the mystery of consciousness. What\\u2019s not to like? Plenty!\", \"First, Damasio has adroitly dodged the \\u201chard problem.\\u201d An image of (say) a bear is, in his account, a pattern of neural firing in the brain. A feeling of (say) fear is another such pattern. Put them together and you\\u2019ve just got a bigger and more complicated pattern of neural firing. Why should it be accompanied by qualitative consciousness? For Damasio to use the terms \\u201cimages\\u201d and \\u201cfeelings\\u201d to refer to these electrochemical events is to make them sound already conscious \\u2014 which might be called the fallacy of tendentious nomenclature.\", \"Second, for Damasio consciousness requires possessing a sense of self, an ability to entertain \\u201cme-ish\\u201d thoughts. But most mammals seem to have no such sense of self. They are incapable of recognizing themselves in a mirror. This is also true of human children in the first months of life \\u2014 are we to suppose that they are not conscious? This might be called the \\u201cUnfair to babies!\\u201d objection.\", \"Third, Damasio\\u2019s category of \\u201cfeeling\\u201d is too capacious. It encompasses not only emotions, but also desires, and states of pleasure and pain. Is all of this really necessary for consciousness? Might not rational thought plus value-based goals be enough? Call this the \\u201cUnfair to Mr. Spock!\\u201d objection.\", \"I could go on.\", \"But if Damasio\\u2019s account of consciousness is not an unqualified success, that merely puts him in the company of all the other distinguished scientists and philosophers who have tried to crack this conundrum. And happily, \\u201cFeeling & Knowing\\u201d has supplementary virtues that make it well worth reading.\", \"Chief among these is how beautifully Damasio expatiates on the theme of feeling \\u2014 on how feelings \\u201carise in the interior of organisms, in the depth of viscera and fluids where the chemistry responsible for life in all its aspects reigns supreme.\\u201d Here the master scientist unites with the silken prose-stylist to produce one thrilling insight after another. For instance: The neural channels that convey feeling, in contrast to those tasked with other mental functions, are uninsulated from the cells that environ them, and from the blood itself. This biochemical nakedness permits \\u201cintimate cross talk between body structures and nervous system.\\u201d (D. H. Lawrence\\u2019s \\u201cthinking with the blood\\u201d is not, alas, a pure metaphor.)\", \"Damasio may not have dispelled the mystery of consciousness in this book. But he has succeeded brilliantly in narrowing the gap between body and mind.\"]","href_hash":"5bc441683bf311eca8a0000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5bc441683bf311eca8a0000017025a03"}},
