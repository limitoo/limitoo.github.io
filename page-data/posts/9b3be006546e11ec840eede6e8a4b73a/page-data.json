Fauci, the top medical adviser to President Biden, said at a press briefing that the scientists are closely monitoring the rate at which cases double to see whether Omicron will overtake Delta to become the dominant variant in the United States \\u2014 and if so, when. The variant has now been detected in six states, though most cases involve returning travelers. \", \"Within about two weeks, he said, \\u201cwe\\u2019ll know more about transmission, immune evasion and severity of disease.\\u201d\", \"He suggested that with the emergence of the new variant, which has multiple troubling mutations that have yet to be fully assessed, booster shots were even more important. He said that studies now indicated that a third dose of the vaccines made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna markedly increased recipients\\u2019 level of antibodies, and raised the levels of memory B and T cells. All three are important indicators of how well the immune system can protect against the coronavirus.\", \"\\u201cAlthough we haven\\u2019t proven it yet, there\\u2019s every reason to believe that if you get vaccinated and boosted that you would have at least some degree of cross protection, very likely against severe disease, even against the Omicron variant,\\u201d he said.\", \"On Thursday, the day after the first reported case of an Omicron infection in the United States, more people got vaccinated than any day since May, according to Jeffrey D. Zients, President Biden\\u2019s coronavirus response coordinator. Mr. Zients said 2.2 million shots were administered, including more than one million booster shots.\", \"While drawing conclusions from one-day totals is risky, especially when the holiday season could cause lags in reporting, Mr. Zients called the uptick \\u201cimportant progress.\\u201d\", \"Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the nation is better equipped to fight the virus than it was a year ago, citing more prevention and treatment methods, and \\u201cmore knowledge and experience from addressing other variants such as Delta.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"9b3be006546e11ec840eede6e8a4b73a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9b3be006546e11ec840eede6e8a4b73a"}},
