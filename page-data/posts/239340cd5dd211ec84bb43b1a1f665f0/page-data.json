Think of Lady Gaga and Jared Leto, who go so daringly big in \\u201cHouse of Gucci,\\u201d or Jessica Chastain and Andrew Garfield as televangelists in \\u201cThe Eyes of Tammy Faye,\\u201d where they pitch their performances nearly as wide as Tammy Faye Bakker\\u2019s mascara-laden eyes.\", \"In \\u201cThe Last Duel,\\u201d Ben Affleck has outrageous fun playing his costume-drama blowhard to the hilt, and the fact that he does it all in a blond wig and a nu-metal goatee makes the role even more over the top. And then there\\u2019s Kristen Stewart, who eschews her trademark minimalism for the awfully maximalist \\u201cSpencer,\\u201d where she is asked to wobble, shout, dance and heave, sometimes all within the same scene.\", \"After the last Oscar season celebrated the quiet, naturalistic \\u201cNomadland,\\u201d it\\u2019s a kick to see so many of this year\\u2019s prestige dramas go in a different direction and embrace enormousness. In an era dominated by superhero movies, perhaps smaller films now need a performance that feels event-sized. Or maybe, after a period when so many of us have led circumscribed lives, it\\u2019s invigorating simply to watch actors shake off their shackles and go for broke.\", \"Whatever the case, it\\u2019s working. \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!\\u201d is animated by Garfield\\u2019s gusto as the composer Jonathan Larson, a man who operates at an 11 at all times. Watching him, I remembered the \\u201c30 Rock\\u201d joke where Jenna Maroney lobbied the Tonys to add a category for \\u201cliving theatrically in normal life.\\u201d And this month brings a double dose of big Cate Blanchett performances in \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up,\\u201d which casts her as a terrifyingly \\u201cyassified\\u201d cable-news host, and \\u201cNightmare Alley,\\u201d in which she treats the film\\u2019s eye-popping production design as if it were all custom-made for her femme fatale to slink on.\", \"I don\\u2019t mean to suggest that these outsize performances are a miscalculation. Quite the opposite: An actress like Blanchett is as tuned in to the tone of her movies as a singer who asks for the intended key and then begins belting. When a skilled performer is able to hit all those high notes, it\\u2019s more than just technically dazzling: It makes the softly played notes to come feel even more resonant.\", \"But hey, there\\u2019s nothing wrong with simply being dazzled for the sake of it. It\\u2019s fun when Bradley Cooper shows up in \\u201cLicorice Pizza\\u201d to terrorize the young leads with wild, nervy electricity: Just when it feels like the film is coming to a close, Cooper adds enough of a jolt to power \\u201cLicorice Pizza\\u201d for 30 more minutes. Part of the thrill of watching such a big performance is that you know how much derision is at stake if the actor fails to nail it. Just think of poor Ben Platt in the film adaptation of \\u201cDear Evan Hansen\\u201d: His crying jags, so potent on the stage, proved unfortunately memeable in the movies.\", \"And sometimes, the most fascinating thing about a film is the frisson between a performer who goes big and co-stars who don\\u2019t. The first time I saw \\u201cThe Power of the Dog,\\u201d I\\u2019ll admit I didn\\u2019t connect with Benedict Cumberbatch, whose performance as the sadistic cattle rancher Phil Burbank felt far too broad. After all, his primary scene partners are Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons, a real-life couple who happen to be two of the best practitioners of American naturalism: They can do anything onscreen and not only will you believe it, you\\u2019ll hardly even catch them doing it. Up against them, I found Cumberbatch too mannered, like an actor determined to show his work.\", \"But the second time I watched the film, I realized all of that artifice is perfect for Phil, who is concealing more than just his silver-spoon upbringing and degree from Yale. Put the pieces of his back story together and you\\u2019ll realize that Phil\\u2019s grime-covered cowboy act is all shtick, a performance of machismo so fraught that an interloper like Dunst threatens it because she doesn\\u2019t have to put on any sort of act at all. It took nerve for Jane Campion, the movie\\u2019s director, to assemble that sort of cast and trust that it would work, just as it took nerve for Cumberbatch to push things just a little further than some actors would deem comfortable.\", \"And hey, at least those bigger-than-average performances will make for some good Oscar clips. Many of the stars who\\u2019ve gone for broke have been earning awards attention, though I do want to go to bat for Affleck, who is delicious as the pompous count in \\u201cThe Last Duel\\u201d and deserves serious supporting-actor consideration. The Golden Globes instead nominated him for his low-key work in \\u201cThe Tender Bar\\u201d \\u2014 a mistake, since the only thing Affleck has done this year that\\u2019s even comparable to \\u201cThe Last Duel\\u201d is the contribution he made to pop culture as one half of Bennifer 2.0.\", \"Maybe that\\u2019s part of the fun of these supersized performances: They\\u2019re finally scaled to the level of celebrity that we count on someone like Affleck or Gaga to serve. So often, Hollywood has asked the stars who live largest to shrink themselves down for critical acclaim. But where\\u2019s the fun in that? They made that screen big for a reason.\"]","href_hash":"239340cd5dd211ec84bb43b1a1f665f0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"239340cd5dd211ec84bb43b1a1f665f0"}},
