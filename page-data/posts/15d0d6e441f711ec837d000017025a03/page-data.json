He said about 1,800 flight attendants are coming back from leave starting Monday, and more are being hired by year-end. The airline is also hiring pilots and reservations agents, he said.\", \"American continued to blame cancellations on last week's weather long after the howling winds subsided in Texas, and that didn't sit well with some longtime customers.\", \"\\\"The whole weather thing irritates me because that's how they get out of financial responsibility.
