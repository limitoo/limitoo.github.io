Resuming on 70, Hasan Joy cut Wagner straight to the hands of Henry Nicholls at gully, departing for 78 at 184/3.\", \"Wagner should have had his fourth wicket not long after, finding the outside edge of Bangladesh captain Mominul Haque through to Tom Blundell behind the stumps. But New Zealand's celebrations quickly turned as replays showed Wagner had overstepped the no-ball line, giving Mominul a life on just nine.\", \"At the other end, Trent Boult struck with the new ball, knocking Mushfiqur Rahim's stumps over for 12 to have Bangladesh 203/4.\", \"The visitors batted through until lunch without further loss as part of an opening session that saw them add 45 runs for the loss of two wickets, trailing by 108 runs.\", \"After lunch though it was all Bangladesh. Coming together for the fifth wicket, Mominul and Liton Das added a century stand with each passing a half-century as the Blackcaps struggled for ideas.\", \"Mominul and Das batted through the entire session without loss as Bangladesh cut New Zealand's lead to just 21 runs at 307/4. After the break, Bangladesh compounded Kiwi woes even further by taking a first innings lead in the early stages of the final session.\", \"By reaching 329/4, Bangladesh took a first innings lead batting second outside of Asia for the first time in history and kept building against a Blackcaps side in desperate need for a breakthrough.\", \"A Mominul cover-drive off the bowling of Rachin Ravindra raised the 150-run stand with Das as the pair could each think about converting their respective scores into hundreds in the final hour of the day.\", \"They couldn't. Coming back after drinks with the old ball, Boult sparked the magic New Zealand had been lacking all day.\", \"With the final ball of the 141st over, Boult trapped Mominul in front lbw, and ended Das' stay at the crease a few overs later as he edged a wide ball through to the gloves of Blundell as Bangladesh lost both set batters in 24 balls.\", \"Bangladesh's seventh wicket pair of Yasir and Mehidy negotiated the remaining overs to end the day's play without further loss as the visitors look to avoid defeat in a test match on New Zealand soil for the first time.\", \"The Blackcaps meanwhile will hope to wrap up Bangladesh's first innings as quickly as possible, needing to take the final four wickets, with the third new ball still four overs away.\"]","href_hash":"31b595ce6c5a11ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"31b595ce6c5a11ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
