But this past week, as Republicans stormed to marquee victories powered in part by turnout in rural areas like Bath County, local voters cheered.\", \"\\u201cWe got our Virginia back,\\u201d said Elaine Neff, a 61-year-old resident. \\u201cAnd we haven\\u2019t had a win in a long time.\\u201d\", \"Ms. Neff said she cried from a mix of happiness and relief after the election. She does not want to take the coronavirus vaccine and believes Glenn Youngkin, the winning Republican candidate for governor, will relax state mandates. Outside a nearby grocery store, Charles Hamilton taunted the Democrats.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re a county of old country folk who want to do what they want,\\u201d said Mr. Hamilton, 74. \\u201cThey found out the hard way.\\u201d\", \"In the jigsaw puzzle that is electoral politics, Democrats have often focused their energy on swingy suburbs and voter-rich cities, content to mostly ignore many white, rural communities that lean conservative. The belief was, in part, that the party had already bottomed out there, especially during the Trump era, when Republicans had run up the numbers of white voters in rural areas to dizzying new heights.\", \"Virginia, however, is proof: It can get worse.\", \"In 2008, there were only four small Virginia counties where Republicans won 70 percent or more of the vote in that year\\u2019s presidential race. Nowhere was the party above 75 percent. This year, Mr. Youngkin was above 70 percent in 45 counties \\u2014 and he surpassed 80 percent in 15 of them.\", \"\\u201cLook at some of those rural counties in Virginia as a wake-up call,\\u201d said Steve Bullock, the Democratic former governor of Montana who made a long-shot 2020 presidential run, partly on a message that his party needed to compete in more conservative parts of the country. \\u201cFolks don\\u2019t feel like we\\u2019re offering them anything, or hearing or listening to them.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Youngkin not only won less populated areas by record margins \\u2014 he was outpacing former President Donald J. Trump\\u2019s 2020 showing in even the reddest counties, including by six percentage points in Bath County \\u2014 but he also successfully rolled back Democratic gains in the bedroom communities outside Washington and Richmond, where many college-educated white voters had rejected Republicanism under Mr. Trump.\", \"The twin results raise a foreboding possibility for Democrats: that the party had simply leased the suburbs in the Trump era, while Republicans may have bought and now own even more of rural America.\", \"Republicans have never had a demographic stronghold as reliable as Black voters have been for Democrats, a group that delivers as many as nine out of 10 votes for the party. But some Democratic leaders are now sounding the alarm: What if rural, white voters \\u2014 of which there are many \\u2014 start voting that reliably Republican?\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s not sustainable for our party to continue to tank in small-town America,\\u201d said Representative Cheri Bustos, the Illinois congresswoman who led the House Democratic campaign arm in 2020.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019ve got a branding problem as Democrats in way too many parts of our country,\\u201d said Ms. Bustos, who is retiring from a downstate and heavily rural Illinois seat that Mr. Trump carried twice. She called it \\u201cpolitical malpractice\\u201d and \\u201cdisrespectful to think it\\u2019s OK to run up the score in big cities and just neglect the smaller towns.\\u201d\", \"There is no easy solution.\", \"Many of the ideas and issues that animate the Democratic base can be off-putting in small towns or untethered to rural life. Voters in Bath County, many of whom are avid hunters and conservative evangelicals, have long opposed liberal stances on gun rights and abortions. Some Democrats urge the party to just show up more. Some believe liberal ideas can gain traction, such as universal health care and free community college. Others urge a refocus on kitchen-table economics like jobs programs and rural broadband to improve connectivity. But it is not clear how open voters are to even listening.\", \"Representative Dean Phillips, a Democrat who flipped a Republican-held seat outside Minneapolis in 2018, said that when it comes to issues that concern rural America, his party is afflicted with a \\u201cdisease of disinterest.\\u201d\", \"He especially lamented how his party\\u2019s strategists routinely tell candidates \\u201cto fish where the Democratic fish are instead of taking that canoe out a little further out on the lake.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cFor a party that predicates itself on inclusivity,\\u201d he added, \\u201cI\\u2019m afraid we\\u2019re acting awfully exclusive.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Phillips called for Democrats to include \\u201cgeographic equity\\u201d in their agenda along with racial and economic equity, noting that he is a proud member of the state\\u2019s Democratic Party, which is formally known as the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. \\u201cI\\u2019m a D.F.L.-er and yet the F\\u2019s and the L\\u2019ers aren\\u2019t voting for us,\\u201d he said.\", \"The rural share of the vote in America has been steadily shrinking, but remains sizable enough to be politically potent. National exit polling in 2020 estimated that one in five voters lived in rural or small-town America. The Democratic data firm TargetSmart, which categorized voters based on population density, labeled 30 percent of the electorate as rural.\", \"But while some Democratic politicians now recognize the scope of their rural problem, the words of voters in Bath County expose the difficulty in finding solutions. In interviews with a dozen white, rural voters who backed Mr. Youngkin, policy was less important than grievance and their own identity politics. And the voters, fueled by a conservative media bubble that speaks in apocalyptic terms, were convinced that America had been brought to the brink by a litany of social movements that had gone too far.\", \"A monument to Confederate soldiers stands next to the sheriff\\u2019s office in Hot Springs, a visual representation of the cultural gap between its residents and the Democratic base. The town is accessible only by a two-lane highway that winds through mountains near the West Virginia border. It\\u2019s best known for The Homestead, a luxury resort founded in the late 1800s that has hosted golf tournaments, conferences for the United Nations and presidents, including William Howard Taft and Theodore Roosevelt.\", \"Ms. Neff, who owns a hardware store adorned with images of Mr. Trump as Rambo and the Terminator, was in Washington on Jan. 6 to support the former president \\u2014 but refused to go into further detail. Citing false evidence, she called the coronavirus vaccine a \\u201cpoison\\u201d and said she worried that Democrats were planning extermination camps of Mr. Trump\\u2019s supporters.\", \"Karen Williams, a Bath County resident who manages vacation rentals, said she resented the current Virginia governor, Ralph Northam, a Democrat, for keeping schools shut down during the pandemic, embracing progressive policies focused on race and removing Confederate statues and monuments. She called this an example of critical race theory, a graduate-level academic framework that has become shorthand for a contentious debate on how to teach race and racism in schools.\", \"White children \\u201care no longer allowed to be kids, we\\u2019re treating them like little monsters,\\u201d Ms. Williams said.\", \"Mr. Hamilton, a veteran of the Vietnam War, said his vote for Mr. Youngkin was really a proxy vote for Mr. Trump. Of President Biden, he said, \\u201cthe best thing that can happen is to get him and that woman out of there.\\u201d\", \"John Wright, a 68-year-old retiree, said he listened only to pro-Trump programming.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t care if the media said the moon was full of cheese, and there was an astronaut who brought back some cheese,\\u201d Mr. Wright said. \\u201cIf the media said it, I won\\u2019t believe it.\\u201d\", \"Some of these voters are simply out of reach for Democrats, incompatible with the party\\u2019s embrace of Black Lives Matter, transgender rights and #MeToo.\", \"But the politically urgent problem for Democrats is that rural America has moved faster and further from them in the last 20 years than urban America has moved away from Republicans. From 1999 to 2019, cities swung 14 percentage points toward the Democrats, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center report. At the same time, rural areas shifted by 19 percentage points toward the Republicans. The suburbs remained essentially tied.\", \"Amanda Litman, the executive director of Run for Something, which looks for Democrats to run for local offices nationwide, said it could be challenging to recruit candidates in deep red small towns \\u2014 and to lure money into what are most likely losing causes.\", \"\\u201cWe just have to try and lose by less,\\u201d she said. \\u201cAnd \\u2018investing to lose by less\\u2019 is not a fun sell to Democratic donors. But it is what it is.\\u201d\", \"Those Democrats who do run in conservative territory often distance themselves from the national party brand. When Monica Tranel, a Democrat, kicked off her bid for Montana\\u2019s new congressional seat over the summer, she lamented how few of the people she grew up with still vote Democratic. \\u201cThey feel like Democrats look down on rural America,\\u201d she said in her campaign launch video.\", \"Ben Tribbett, a Democratic strategist in Virginia, has watched his party\\u2019s vote share in rural areas wither for three decades.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t know what our message is there,\\u201d Mr. Tribbett said. \\u201cWhich is a problem, because I\\u2019m supposed to be creating content for political campaigns.\\u201d\", \"Just how much further can the party fall?\", \"\\u201cIn rural America the bottom for the Democratic Party is zero,\\u201d said Ethan Winter, a senior analyst at the group Data for Progress, who studies voter behavior. \\u201cI am serious about this.\\u201d\", \"Rural, white voters in the past in the North had historic ties to the labor movement and an affinity for the Democratic Party. Increasingly, Mr. Winter said, those voters are more akin culturally to their neighbors to the South than to their local cities and suburbs.\", \"Tom Bonier, one of the Democratic Party\\u2019s leading experts on voter data and the chief executive of TargetSmart, agreed. \\u201cYou look at places in the Deep South where the white, rural vote is approaching 90 percent Republican,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThat\\u2019s absolutely the concern.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Youngkin carried Virginia\\u2019s mountains with 70 percent of the vote, up from Mr. Trump\\u2019s 63 percent last year, according to exit polling. And among white voters without college degrees, Mr. Youngkin won 76 percent \\u2014 a stark improvement from Mr. Trump\\u2019s 62 percent in 2020 and higher than in 2016, as well.\", \"In Bath County, a smaller group of voters cited economic concerns for why the area has become more conservative. They spoke of a time in almost mythical terms, when both parties had a foothold in the region \\u2014 before rising gas prices, inflation and stagnant wages.\", \"Sharon Lindsay, a 69-year-old librarian, said people were offended that today\\u2019s liberals assume their area is inherently racist or bigoted. \\u201cWe know they wrote us off,\\u201d Ms. Lindsay said. \\u201cThey never talk to us. We never see them. And we see Republicans all the time.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"5b7231023f2711ec99e9cb55b485580d"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5b7231023f2711ec99e9cb55b485580d"}},
