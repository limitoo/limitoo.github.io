City officials hope the system can help trace the recent movements of people who tested positive for the coronavirus, their interactions with other people and whether masks were worn.\", \"Bucheon is not the first city to explore the use of facial recognition as it tries to cope with the heavy demands on labor and resources that contact tracing often entails. Moscow has used the technology to check if people placed under quarantine have tried to leave their homes.\", \"The details of the system being tested in South Korea were outlined in a proposal by the city of Bucheon that was approved in February by the federal Ministry of Science and Information and Communications Technology.\", \"Facial recognition has its limitations. The technology has struggled to identify people whose faces are blocked by masks. The huge amount of data required to identify individuals in large populations had also stymied engineers. To make such a system work, authorities must generally have a large database of citizens\\u2019 photos for the technology to draw on, raising privacy concerns.\", \"The Bucheon plan seeks to address such concerns, though details are limited. A person\\u2019s consent must be obtained before the system may access his or her information, the proposal said, and the data would be provided only to quarantine authorities. It was not clear whether the system would pull on a broad database of photos of citizens, or just a local one.\", \"South Korea, where 81 percent of the population is fully vaccinated according to Our World in Data, has had a steady increase in daily new cases over the past few months, going from the 1,000s in October to a record of 7,174 last Wednesday.\", \"The country, which had originally rolled out a plan to \\u201clive with Covid\\u201d in November, has reinstated some social distancing regulations, including a cap on social gatherings and mandatory quarantine for inbound travelers until Thursday.\"]","href_hash":"0ac079145c1711ec86e06b2d114f458f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0ac079145c1711ec86e06b2d114f458f"}},
