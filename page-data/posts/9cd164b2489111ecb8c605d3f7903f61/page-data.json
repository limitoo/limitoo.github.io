A poll released this week by Marquette University Law School found 71 percent of respondents do not want him to run.\", \"Just 28 percent of the adults surveyed nationwide favored a Trump run. However, the survey found that a majority of Republicans favored the former president making a run for a second term. Sixty percent of Republicans surveyed said they felt he should run while 40 percent of Republicans surveyed said they did not want to see him on the ballot. In turn, 73 percent of independents who responded to the survey said they felt he should not run, and 26 percent said they wanted to see Trump on the ticket.\", \"The former president continues to stand behind his disproven claims that he lost the 2020 election as a result of fraud. In statements submitted through his Save America website, Trump continues to refer to himself as President Donald J. Trump as opposed to former President Trump.\", \"Over the past several months, Trump has hinted at a potential run. He told FOX News host Sean Hannity in late June that he'd made up his mind regarding a potential run, saying \\\"it's not that I want to\\\" but that \\\"the country needs it.\\\" When pressed on the question by reporters, Trump has carried out a strategy of offering back subtle hints about his potential candidacy in 2024.\", \"\\\"Everybody wants me to do it, the polls are all saying I have to do it,\\\" Trump told conservative talk show host Joe Pags in May. \\\"I don't know exactly when I can say it but it's something I am very very strongly considering.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1935634/topshot-combo-us-vote-debate.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Despite reports of plummeting polls, President Joe Biden remains the preferred candidate over former President Donald Trump for 2024, according to a new poll from Marquette Law School.
