Indeed, it could be the saviour for Finch's men as they prepare for their last group game against West Indies on Saturday night looking to secure their place in the semi-finals.\", \"But fans could be forgiven for asking: How does it work again?\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Australia vs West Indies permutations</div>\", \"Put simply, a team's net run rate (NRR) is how many more runs it scores per over than its opponent, averaged over the whole tournament.\", \"Based on the Group 1 table, English batters score on average three runs more per over than their bowlers concede.\", \"In the much-anticipated climax to the group tonight, Australia plays\\u00a0the West Indies then England meets South Africa.\", \"A\\u00a0big win for Australia\\u00a0will almost certainly send Finch and co\\u00a0through to the semi-finals as the second-placed team, even if South Africa is victorious.\", \"If the West Indies can procure a victory, Australia needs England to beat South Africa by a similar margin to ensure Australia's net run rate doesn't drop below South Africa's.\", \"If Australia only wins narrowly, things get complicated.\", \"Say the Australians chase down a West Indies target of 150 with an over to spare, the side's net run rate will actually fractionally reduce.\", \"Under that scenario, if South Africa was to score 150, it would have to restrict England to 110 runs, or if chasing 150 it would need to get there with about four overs remaining in order to leapfrog Australia.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Wild variations</div>\", \"ABC Sport statistician Ric Finlay says net run rate is the established, accepted method of splitting teams in tournaments tied on points, but it's not perfect.\", \"\\\"Because it's only over a small number of games, there can be wild variations from match to match and these wild variations would be dampened by a longer competition,\\\" he says.\", \"Even beyond five matches, it still throws up unusual results. In the WBBL this season, the Melbourne Renegades sat atop the ladder after eight games (as of Saturday morning) \\u2026 with a negative NRR.\\u00a0\", \"One aspect of net run rate that creates skewed results is a dismissed team's run rate is always calculated as if it used its\\u00a0entire allotment of overs.\", \"For example, in Australia's triumph over Bangladesh on Thursday night, Bangladesh's run rate for the purposes of NRR was calculated as 3.65, even though the side scored its 73 runs across 15 overs for an actual run rate of almost five per over.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/3247d6a2bce0f3760d8135d523c865d1\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Five wickets from Australia's Adam Zampa helped dismiss Bangladesh inside 20 overs \\u2014\\u00a0a net run rate no-no.(Reuters:\\u00a0Hamad I Mohammed)</div>\", \"\\\"The rule was created to stop teams trying to manipulate their run rate by going absolutely berserk and committing kamikaze basically, getting all out for 55 in four overs \\u2014 teams trying to lift their run rate that weren't worried about the result,\\\"\\u00a0Finlay says.\", \"Conversely, the winning team's NRR is based only on the number of overs used. In the match against Bangladesh, Australia reached 78 to win in the seventh over with the loss of just two wickets.\", \"\\\"The official view is that wickets are irrelevant, provided you haven't lost them all,\\\" Finlay says.\", \"\\\"For example, Australia could have gone absolutely crackers and lost seven wickets getting to their 74 in three overs or something \\u2026 it wouldn't have mattered that they lost seven wickets.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">The alternatives</div>\", \"The early 50-over world cups were decided on average run rate, not net run rate.
