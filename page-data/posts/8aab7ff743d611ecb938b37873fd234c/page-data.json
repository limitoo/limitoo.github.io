A Starlink beta service is currently available in 19 countries on a limited basis.\", \"The latest Starlink mission that is now scheduled for Saturday will be SpaceX's 25th launch of 2021, all of which have used the company's partially reusable Falcon 9 rocket. B1058, the Falcon 9 booster that will hopefully carry the 53-satellite batch into orbit on Saturday, has been involved in eight previous missions.\", \"After lifting off, the Falcon 9's first stage booster is expected to separate around two-and-a-half minutes into the mission, and will subsequently try and land on SpaceX's drone ship \\\"Just Read the Instructions\\\" located around 400 miles away from the launch site in the Atlantic Ocean.\", \"If all goes to plan on Saturday, the latest Starlink mission will be SpaceX's second launch this week. On Wednesday, another Falcon 9 rocket launched carrying a crew of four astronauts to the International Space Station as part of NASA's Commercial Crew Program.\", \"You can watch the launch live via SpaceX's website or the company's YouTube channel.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931436/spacex-falcon-9-rocket.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket sits on launch Pad 39A at NASA\\u2019s Kennedy Space Center on September 15, 2021 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.</div>\"]","href_hash":"8aab7ff743d611ecb938b37873fd234c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8aab7ff743d611ecb938b37873fd234c"}},
