Russia denies that and says it is Ukraine's growing relationship with NATO that has caused the standoff to escalate. It has compared it to the 1962 Cuban missile crisis, when the world came to the brink of nuclear war.\", \"President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday Russia wanted to avoid conflict but needed an \\\"immediate\\\" response from the United States and its allies to its demands for security guarantees.
