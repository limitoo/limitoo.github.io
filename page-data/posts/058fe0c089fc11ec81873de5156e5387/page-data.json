Cook and Philip N. Jefferson and a longtime government official and lawyer, Sarah Bloom Raskin \\u2014 said they would \\u201ccommit not to seek employment or compensation\\u201d from any financial services company after leaving the board, which oversees the largest banks.\", \"Their promises came at the urging of Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat who has criticized the so-called revolving door between government and finance. Fed officials regularly go to work for Wall Street after leaving the institution, making the commitment notable.\", \"\\u201cThese are the strongest ethics standards ever agreed to by Federal Reserve Board nominees,\\u201d Ms. Warren said in a statement on Wednesday. \\u201cU.S. Senators and the American people can be confident that these public servants will make sound economic policy decisions in the public\\u2019s best interest.\\u201d\", \"Republicans have been questioning Ms. Raskin\\u2019s nomination by highlighting her stint on the board of directors for a financial technology company, Reserve Trust.\", \"The company got a critical account with the Fed \\u2014 known as a master account \\u2014 while Ms. Raskin was on the company\\u2019s board.

Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, asked Ms. Raskin to respond in writing by Wednesday about the Reserve Trust situation.\", \"Ms. Raskin, in her response, said she did \\u201cnot recall any communications I made to help Reserve Trust obtain a master account. Had I done so, I would have abided by all applicable ethics rules in such communications.\\u201d\", \"Amanda Thompson, the communications director for Republicans on the Banking Committee, called those responses a \\u201ccase of selective amnesia.\\u201d\", \"The White House has continued to stand behind its nominees.
