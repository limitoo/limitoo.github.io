\\\"thoughtful\\\" deal, intellectual property experts say.\\u00a0\", \"On Tuesday, the federal government announced it had paid more than $20\\u00a0million to Luritja artist Harold Thomas and licence holders to secure copyright for the iconic flag.\", \"But with the flag now freely available for public use by all Australians, there could be future disagreements about what is appropriate and respectful.\", \"While the terms of the agreement have not been made public, intellectual property expert Rebecca Giblin from the Melbourne Law School said it was important the flag's designer\\u00a0was satisfied with the deal.\", \"\\\"It looks like Harold Thomas has come up with a thoughtful deal and this is the best we could hope for,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"This [the Aboriginal flag] is a really simple but highly evocative design that has gained its value through its adoption by First Nations people in Australia.\", \"\\\"The artist has tried to reflect that in the deal he has reached\\u00a0by sharing the value with Indigenous communities.\\\"\", \"Mr Thomas said he would use $2 million to establish an Australian Aboriginal Flag Legacy not-for-profit organisation to support the \\\"interests of Aboriginal Australians and the flag\\\".\", \"The Commonwealth has also agreed to put all future royalties from commercial flag sales towards the work of NAIDOC and to establish an annual scholarship worth $100,000 for Indigenous students in Mr Thomas's honour.\", \"University of Sydney law professor Kimberlee Weatherall said while the $20 million figure seemed reasonable, it was hard to judge if the price was right.\", \"\\\"This is not your usual copyright case,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"The value comes from its adoption, from its use \\u2026 and its ongoing significance depends on its use by First Nations people.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/15e368528d0120dff44e6de21529a3f2\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

1970, Mr Thomas first claimed copyright in 1995 when the Commonwealth officially proclaimed the Aboriginal flag as \\\"a flag of Australia\\\".\", \"His copyright was contested and in 1997 the artist won a legal battle in which the Federal Court recognised him as the designer.\", \"Mr Thomas retained sole copyright of the flag after that\\u00a0time and licensed its use.\", \"Professor Weatherall said the copyright issue had \\\"come to a head in the last few years because of the exclusive licence for certain commercial uses to WAM clothing\\\".\", \"\\\"They've been sending cease and desist\\u00a0letters and seeking substantial licensing fees from organisations who have been using the flag, including Indigenous-led organisations \\u2014\\u00a0and WAM clothing is not Indigenous-run,\\\" she said.\", \"While this is legally within the rights of a licence holder, Professor Weatherall said it had caused a lot of controversy.\", \"\\\"People think the flag should be
