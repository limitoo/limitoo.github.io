And they are racing to get a piece of the potential boom.\", \"One of those towns is Taylor, a city of about 17,000 about a 40-minute drive northeast of Austin. Leaders here are pulling out all the stops to get a $17 billion Samsung plant that the company plans to build in the United States starting early next year.\", \"The city, its school district and the county plan to offer Samsung hundreds of millions of dollars in financial incentives, including tax rebates. The community also has arranged for water to be piped in from an adjacent county to be used by the plant.\", \"But Taylor is not alone. Officials in Arizona and in Genesee County in upstate New York are also trying to woo the company. So, too, are politicians in nearby Travis County, home to Austin, where Samsung already has a plant. Locations in all three states \\u201coffered robust property tax abatement\\u201d and funds to build out infrastructure for the plant, Samsung said in a filing. Congress is considering whether to offer its own subsidies to chip makers that build in the United States.\", \"Where Samsung\\u2019s plant will land remains anyone\\u2019s guess. The company says it is still weighing where to put it. A decision is expected to be announced any day.\", \"The federal government has urged companies like Samsung, one of the world\\u2019s largest makers of the high-tech components, to build new plants in the United States, calling it an economic and national security imperative. Intel broke ground on two new plants in Arizona in September and could announce the location for planned new manufacturing campus by the end of the year.\", \"This could just be a warm-up act. The Senate passed a bill this year to provide chip makers $52 billion in subsidies this year, a plan supported by the Biden administration that would be Washington\\u2019s biggest investment in industrial policy in decades. The House has yet to consider it. Nine governors said in a letter to congressional leaders that the funding would \\u201cprovide a new, powerful tool in our states\\u2019 economic development toolboxes.\\u201d\", \"In Taylor, even the possibility of Samsung\\u2019s arrival is generating hope. Business owners say that it would bring more patrons to the local brewery and to the city\\u2019s quiet downtown. Parents think that the factory\\u2019s cutting-edge assembly line would inspire the town\\u2019s high school students. Residents believe land prices would rise quickly \\u2014 values have already edged up in recent months just on the possibility, one real estate agent said.\", \"\\u201cSomething like this can be a shot in the arm,\\u201d said Ian Davis, the chief executive of Texas Beer Company, which opened a taproom in downtown Taylor five years ago.\", \"The vast majority of semiconductors \\u2014 an industry that generated nearly $450 billion in revenue in 2020 \\u2014 are made in Taiwan, Korea and mainland China. The United States controls just 12 percent of global production.\", \"Lawmakers say the chip shortages illuminate how America\\u2019s limited role in the industry puts the nation\\u2019s economy in a precarious position. Politicians also fear that China is taking steps to increase its control of global semiconductor supplies, potentially leaving the United States at a technological disadvantage against a geopolitical rival that would have national security implications.\", \"But the cities\\u2019 attempts to lure the plants are raising questions about how far communities should go \\u2014 and how much taxpayer money they should pay \\u2014 to get a piece of the high-tech economy.\", \"Chandler, Ariz., approved up to $30 million in water and road improvements to support an Intel plant that broke ground in September. Phoenix will spend roughly $200 million on infrastructure for a new factory by the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, another major chip maker. When the company announced the plant in 2020, it said subsidies were crucial to its plans.\", \"Critics of corporate tax incentives say the money could be better spent on basic infrastructure and on public schools. They say cities might be spending taxpayer funds needlessly, because factors like the availability of talent and of natural resources are more important to chip makers than subsidies. And they argue that cities end up sacrificing the most important thing a big industrial project can contribute: tax revenue.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s clearly benefits,\\u201d said Nathan Jensen, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin who studies subsidy programs. \\u201cThe problem is if you\\u2019re literally giving away a lot of those benefits to land the company.\\u201d\", \"Many residents in Taylor said that was the price they needed to pay to supercharge the city\\u2019s revival.\", \"Taylor \\u2014 named for a railroad executive \\u2014 was once a hub for shipping cattle and cotton. Louie Mueller Barbecue opened in 1949 and still draws carnivores with its brisket and beef ribs.\", \"But in recent decades, residents said, Taylor\\u2019s downtown has lost some vitality.\", \"They have tried to change that by luring newer small businesses to the city and by renovating an old building that now houses Mr. Davis\\u2019s taproom, converted lofts and a coffee shop that serves babka and chocolate-tahini brownies. Another group repurposed the town\\u2019s old high school to house small businesses including restaurants and a pinball bar. The city spruced up a downtown park.\", \"\\u201cBringing that in, something that\\u2019s going to be here indefinitely, the revenue that it brings for our city and for our schools, particularly, is going to be enormous,\\u201d said Susan Green, a Taylor resident who has children in its school system.\", \"Steve Adler, the mayor of Austin, said that subsidies Austin gave to to Samsung in the 1990s had had a positive effect on the city, which has seen rapid growth in recent years. Tesla and Oracle recently moved their corporate headquarters to Austin, and Facebook and Apple have large operations there. By one estimate, the city is the nation\\u2019s top site for commercial real estate investment.\", \"Austin and its surrounding county have held their own talks with Samsung about the new factory the company has planned. Mr. Adler said that he wanted the city to be a competitive site for the Samsung plant. \", \"\\u201cIt certainly paid a huge benefit to our city and our region, having them here,\\u201d Mr. Adler said about Samsung. But Pat Garofalo, the director of state and local policy for the American Economic Liberties Project, a liberal group that is critical of large tech companies, said the money would better spent on projects that make a city attractive to a wide range of businesses \\u2014 like public schools \\u2014 instead of on a single suitor.\", \"He said that the manufacturers sensed the \\u201cvery real problem\\u201d of the semiconductor shortage and \\u201care using it to capitalize on the tendency among state and local officials to pay a lot of taxpayer money for hosting one of these facilities.\\u201d\", \"Vanessa Fuentes, a member of the Austin City Council, said that residents of her district worried about being pushed out of their homes or seeing corner stores replaced by expensive grocery stores. She said the city had the \\u201cupper hand\\u201d in dealing with tech companies and should make sure that any deal it cut with tech companies did enough for existing residents.\", \"\\u201cIf it\\u2019s not good enough, then we don\\u2019t need to do it, quite frankly,\\u201d she said. \\u201cBecause there\\u2019s too much at risk of what could happen with this type of growth, in terms of displacement specifically.\\u201d\", \"In Taylor, Samsung\\u2019s boosters believe that they can manage those concerns if they get the project.\", \"\\u201cYes, it\\u2019ll be more traffic. Yes, there\\u2019ll be some rising property values,\\u201d Mr. Davis said. \\u201cBut I think it will also help create jobs.\\u201d\", \"To sweeten the deal, Mr. Davis recently made another offer to the chip maker at a public meeting: He\\u2019ll make a Samsung pale ale.\", \"\\u201cI think having 5,000 daily construction workers patronize all these small businesses \\u2014 pros will outweigh the cons by a mile,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"fe8e861047e711ec8cfa3fbb487d9f73"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fe8e861047e711ec8cfa3fbb487d9f73"}},
