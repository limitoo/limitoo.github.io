That began to change about a decade ago, when the first of dozens of young, white workers flew in from South Africa on special guest worker visas. Mr. Strong and his co-workers trained the men, who by last year were being lured across the globe with wages of more than $11 an hour, compared with the $7.25 an hour that Mr. Strong and other Black local workers were paid.\", \"Growers brought in more South Africans with each passing year, and they are now employed at more than 100 farms across the Delta. Mr. Strong, 50, and several other longtime workers said they were told their services were no longer needed.\", \"\\u201cI never did imagine that it would come to the point where they would be hiring foreigners, instead of people like me,\\u201d Mr. Strong said.\", \"From the wheat farms in the Midwest to the citrus groves in California\\u2019s Central Valley, growers have increasingly turned to foreign workers as aging farmworkers exit the fields and low-skilled workers opt for jobs in construction, hospitality and warehouses, which offer higher pay, year-round work and, sometimes, benefits.\", \"The agricultural guest worker program, known by the shorthand H-2A, was once shunned by farmers here and elsewhere as expensive and bureaucratic. But the continuing farm labor shortages across the country pushed H-2A visas up to 213,394 in the 2020 fiscal year, from 55,384 in 2011.\", \"\\u201cOur choice is between importing our food or importing the work force necessary to produce domestically,\\u201d said Craig Regelbrugge, a veteran agricultural industry advocate who is an expert on the program. \\u201cThat\\u2019s never been truer than it is today. Virtually all new workers entering into the agriculture work force these days are H-2A workers.\\u201d\", \"In the Mississippi Delta, a region of high unemployment and entrenched poverty, the labor mobility that is widening the pool of fieldworkers is having a devastating effect on local workers who are often ill-equipped to compete with the new hires, frequently younger and willing to work longer hours.\", \"The new competition is upending what for many has been a way of life in the rich farmlands of Mississippi. \\u201cIt\\u2019s like being robbed of your heritage,\\u201d Mr. Strong said.\", \"In Mississippi, where the legacy of slavery and racism has long pervaded work in the cotton fields, a federal lawsuit filed by Mr. Strong and five other displaced Black farmworkers claims that the new foreign workers were illegally paid at higher rates than local Black workers, who it said had for years been subjected to racial slurs and other demeaning treatment from a white supervisor.\", \"Two additional plaintiffs are preparing to join the suit, which says farmers violated civil rights law by hiring only white workers from South Africa, a country with its own history of racial injustice.\", \"\\u201cBlack workers have been doing this work for generations,\\u201d said Ty Pinkins, a lawyer at the Mississippi Center for Justice, which is representing the Black farmworkers in the lawsuit. \\u201cThey know the land, they know the seasons, they know the equipment.\\u201d\", \"A vast flood plain, the Mississippi Delta boasts some of the country\\u2019s richest soil. It also is the poorest pocket of the poorest state. In Indianola, a town of almost 10,000 about 95 miles north of Jackson, the median household income is $28,941.\", \"The hometown of the blues legend B.B. King, Indianola is the seat of Sunflower County, where empty storefronts line forlorn downtowns and children play outside crumbling shacks.\", \"The region, which is more than 70 percent Black, remains rigidly segregated. Black children attend underfunded public schools while white students go to private academies. Black and white families bury their dead in different cemeteries.\", \"The Delta is only one of a number of places where South Africans have been hired for agricultural work in recent years. While Mexicans accounted for the largest share of last year\\u2019s H-2A visas, or 197,908 of them, the second-largest number, 5,508, went to South Africans. Their numbers soared 441 percent between 2011 and 2020.\", \"Garold Dungy, who until two years ago ran an agency that recruited foreign farmworkers, including for Pitt Farms, the operation that employed Mr. Strong and the other plaintiffs, said South Africans represented the bulk of his business. They are \\u201cthe preferred group,\\u201d he said, because of their strong work ethic and fluency in English.\", \"Under the program, growers can hire foreign workers for up to 10 months. They must pay them an hourly wage that is set by the Labor Department and varies from state to state, as well as their transportation and housing.\", \"Farmers must also show that they have tried, and failed, to find Americans to perform the work and they must pay domestic workers the same rate they are paying the imported laborers.\", \"According to the Black workers\\u2019 lawsuit, Pitt Farms paid the South Africans $9.87 an hour in 2014, a rate that reached $11.83 in 2020. The plaintiffs who worked in the fields were paid the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour or $8.25 on weekends, plus occasional bonuses.\", \"Both Walter Pitts, a co-owner of Pitts Farms, and the farm\\u2019s lawyer, Timothy Threadgill, declined to discuss the farm\\u2019s hiring strategy because of the pending litigation.\", \"The reliance on South Africans may reflect the nature of agriculture and the demographics in the Mississippi Delta, compared with places like California.\", \"\\u201cIn the Mississippi Delta, row-crop production requires fewer workers but workers who have skills to use machinery and equipment,\\u201d said Elizabeth Canales, an agricultural extension economist at Mississippi State University. \\u201cWe hardly have any Latinos in this remote region. Naturally, it\\u2019s easier to hire South Africans where language will not be a barrier, especially because in this area, you have a very small Spanish-speaking population.\\u201d\", \"The South Africans arrived in the region willing to work weeks that sometimes stretched to 75 hours or more, grueling schedules that might have been difficult for older local workers to maintain, industry analysts said.\", \"There was initially no public controversy over the program in Indianola. Growers in the region described the South Africans as \\u201cgood workers,\\u201d said Steve Rosenthal, a three-term mayor of Indianola who lost his bid for re-election in October. Until the lawsuit was filed, he did not realize that some Black workers had been let go.\", \"\\u201cIf you have a man that you\\u2019ve trained and worked with for years and he knows how to get stuff done,\\u201d he said, \\u201chow in good conscience can you bring somebody over and pay him more than a man that\\u2019s been with you five, eight, 10 years?\\u201d\", \"The Strong family has worked for generations for the Pitts family, which has farmed in the Mississippi Delta for six decades. Richard Strong\\u2019s grandfather Henry and grandmother Isadora worked their land. So did his father and his uncle.\", \"Mr. Strong and his brother got hired in the 1990s; he eventually operated not only tractors, but big equipment like combines and cotton pickers. He mixed chemicals to control weeds and pests. He ran irrigation pivots in 19 fields, covering some 3,000 acres. He rose to manager, driving across the farm to verify that everything was in working order.\", \"When he first heard that Africans were coming to work on the farm, about eight years ago, \\u201cI didn\\u2019t question it. I just went along doing my job,\\u201d he said.\", \"But when four white men showed up, they were not the Africans he had expected. Even so, Mr. Strong said, the men, a good 20 years younger than him, were \\u201ccool guys.\\u201d\", \"He taught the men how to properly plow, how to input GPS settings into the tractors\\u2019 navigation systems, how to operate the irrigation system so just the right amount of water was sprinkled on the crops.\", \"Over the next few years, more South Africans came, until more than half the farm\\u2019s work force was there on foreign visas.\", \"One of them was Innes Singleton, now 28, who learned about the opportunity to work in Mississippi from a friend in 2012.\", \"He had recently finished secondary school and did not know what to do next.\", \"He arrived in Indianola in early 2013, and is now earning $12 an hour, making in one week what would take a month for him to earn in South Africa, where the unemployment rate now exceeds 30 percent.\", \"\\u201cI learned a lot here,\\u201d he said, adding that he sometimes had to work up to 110 hours a week. South Africans now do the main work on the farm, he said, and four locals \\u201chelp us out.\\u201d\", \"After the 2019 season, Mr. Strong traveled to Texas to visit his ailing father-in-law. When he returned, the Pitts Farm truck that he drove had disappeared from outside the house he had rented from the grower for about a year. He was told to vacate and was not offered work for the 2020 season.\", \"A year later, others were let go, including his brother, Gregory, who said he had devoted much of his life to Pitt Farms.\", \"\\u201cI gave them half my life and ended up with nothing,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI know everything on that place. I even know the dirt.\\u201d\", \"Andrew Johnson, another plaintiff in the lawsuit, is 66 and said he had worked 20 years at the farm.\", \"\\u201cI used to work rain or shine or anything,\\u201d he said.\", \"But before the 2021 season began, he said, one of the Pitts owners told him \\u201che didn\\u2019t need me no more.\\u201d\", \"Since the lawsuit was filed, other Black workers have come forward, saying they had labored in the fields and catfish farms of the Delta before unfairly losing their jobs, Mr. Pinkins, the lawyer, said.\", \"In late October, as the harvesting season came to a close, eighteen-wheelers in Indianola rumbled down the highway, loaded with bales of cotton. Driving alongside the farm where he spent 24 years, Mr. Strong scanned the rows of neatly carved earth as far as the eye could see. \\u201cI put in all that,\\u201d he said, with a certain pride.\", \"Then a tractor passed by, a young South African man at the wheel, and Mr. Strong looked away. \\u201cI miss working the land,\\u201d he said.\"]","href_hash":"3b163bc843a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"3b163bc843a111ec87c5ad669ae2179c"}},
