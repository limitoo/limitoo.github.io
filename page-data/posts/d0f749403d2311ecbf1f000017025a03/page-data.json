Here, Bridgestone Arena, the Predators' home rink, can be seen. </div>\", \"Bridgestone Arena also implemented this new policy in regard to other events such as concerts or other large gatherings.\", \"The relaxed policy, which will go into effect on November 13, is reportedly due to a lowering of new cases in Nashville and the surrounding area.\", \"Bridgestone Arena and Predators CEO Sean Henry said that \\\"we are encouraged that the data trends are moving briskly in a positive direction; today's announcement is consistent with our original intention to update our protocols as case counts and transmission levels evolved.\\\"\", \"Nashville has dropped below the CDC's \\\"substantial\\\" transmission level\\u2014which tracks new COVID cases per 100,000 people each week\\u2014prompting the change in the Predators' vaccination policy.\", \"The Predators were joined in this new policy by the NBA's Dallas Mavericks.\", \"The Mavericks announced Monday that, similarly to the Predators, fans visiting their arena, the American Airlines Center, would also not need to show proof of vaccination or a negative test.\", \"Masks, however, are still required to be worn at all times.\", \"The new policy, which will be implemented on November 15, will be effective for all fans sitting at least 15 feet away from the playing court. For people sitting closer, proof of vaccination or a negative test will still be required.\", \"Unlike the Predators, the Mavericks share the building with another professional club, the NHL's Dallas Stars. While the Stars also require masks, they do not have any such vaccine screenings in place.\", \"Mavericks owner Mark Cuban stated that this decision was also based on similarly falling case rates in and around Dallas. He did warn, however, that the policy was subject to change based on the CDC's community transmission guidelines.\", \"\\\"We have always followed the science. Now we are instituting protections for those who need it and responding to the 70+ percent decline in cases per day,\\\" Cuban tweeted. \\\"If the numbers get worse again, we will bring back the policy.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"d0f749403d2311ecbf1f000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d0f749403d2311ecbf1f000017025a03"}},
