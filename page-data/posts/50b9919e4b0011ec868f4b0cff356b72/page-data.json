Splashed with projections, those planks shaped themselves into the sprawling four-opera cycle\\u2019s various locales, from the heavens to the depths. And \\u201cthe machine,\\u201d as it became known, kept making news, with its 45 tons, its technological sophistication, its phenomenal expense, its creaks and malfunctions.\", \"It worked, the Met insisted, more than it didn\\u2019t. But working or not, the machine was always the focus \\u2014 not the music, the characters or the intellectual themes of Wagner\\u2019s deeply human, politically charged magnum opus.\", \"Richard Jones\\u2019s new production \\u2014 the first installment of which, \\u201cDie Walk\\u00fcre,\\u201d was presented on Friday by English National Opera at the London Coliseum \\u2014 could not be more different. (\\u201cDas Rheingold,\\u201d \\u201cSiegfried\\u201d and \\u201cG\\u00f6tterd\\u00e4mmerung\\u201d are scheduled to roll out here over the next few years before it all comes to New York starting in 2025.)\", \"Simple, straightforward, clear and grim, Jones\\u2019s \\u201cRing\\u201d thus far features sets that are pared down \\u2014 even, by the end, nonexistent: The final act of his \\u201cWalk\\u00fcre\\u201d takes place on a bare stage, dusted with black snow and ringed with plain dark curtains. The machine is no more.\", \"In these austere surroundings, designed by Jones\\u2019s longtime collaborator, Stewart Laing, the interactions of the opera\\u2019s emotionally wounded, invariably disappointed characters feel bleaker than ever. Amid the starkness, Siegmund and Sieglinde\\u2019s covert love in the first act offers them less ecstasy than barely momentary relief. In the third act, without Lepage\\u2019s planks noisily shaping a snowy mountain around Br\\u00fcnnhilde and Wotan, the audience has no distraction from the shattered relationship of this father and daughter.\", \"The setting is contemporary \\u2014 but vaguely so, stylized, almost abstract. In the opening act, the hut in which Sieglinde lives is a lonely cabin of ominous newness, as if a band of survivalists had recently constructed a hideaway. (This may not be far off: Her husband Hunding\\u2019s gang all have the same obscure symbol printed, militia-style, on their shirts.) At the start of the second act, Wotan, dressed in a bright red ski jacket, is staying at a lodge; Br\\u00fcnnhilde wears sneakers, a baggy T-shirt and shorts, with her name printed down the sides.\", \"But though the soprano Rachel Nicholls, who plays that role, said in a recent interview that Jones\\u2019s vision of Br\\u00fcnnhilde, the cycle\\u2019s heroine, is loosely inspired by Greta Thunberg, that seems more a reference to Thunberg\\u2019s youthful assertiveness than to her environmental activism. This is a current but not (at least not yet) explicitly current-events \\u201cRing.\\u201d Wotan and his furious wife, Fricka, chic in white, are identifiably bourgeois here, but there is not a strong social or political message driving the opera\\u2019s conflicts.\", \"Like many recent productions of the \\u201cRing,\\u201d the overall modern gloss of this one is shot through with traditional touches, and little here truly violates the libretto. A tree grows in the center of the hut in Act I, just as Wagner wrote, its branches tearing through the roof and a mighty sword buried in its trunk. The Valkyries have horses \\u2014 shivering cloth-draped actors with animal heads \\u2014 and spears. At the end, Br\\u00fcnnhilde, who wears a breastplate over her T-shirt, is encircled in a blazing ring of fire. (Well, more on that later.)\", \"And the production, while spartan, doesn\\u2019t stint on theatrical flair, as when the Valkyries, charged with carrying slain warriors to Valhalla, attach cords to the men\\u2019s bodies, which then float up in solemn limpness. Without scenic spectacle, small events \\u2014 like Hunding\\u2019s hut moving slowly upstage \\u2014 register as almost thrilling.\", \"Jones elicits tiny yet revealing moments from his performers, too. Climbing on all fours over a daybed, the eloquent, lyrical bass Matthew Rose conveys in an instant the essential childishness of Wotan, the king of the gods. And when Fricka reaches out a couple of inches, trying to take his unreceptive hand, it\\u2019s a miniature portrait of a broken marriage. Siegmund lifts Sieglinde\\u2019s sleeping body and walks with her so that her toes are dragging on the floor, a strangely poignant intertwining of love and death.\", \"This is altogether more detailed, moving, stimulating and satisfying than the Met production it will replace. And tellingly, Jones\\u2019s single use of projections is more haunting than anything Lepage came up with: The nefarious Alberich, who forged the all-powerful ring of the title, appears, grinning with gold-capped teeth, as Wotan\\u2019s waking nightmare.\", \"The applause at the end for Jones \\u2014 hardly euphoric cheers, but not a boo to be heard \\u2014 must have been gratifying for a director whose history with the \\u201cRing\\u201d is troubled. After an aborted cycle at Scottish Opera, begun in the late 1980s, he made another effort at the Royal Opera in London a few years later, in the spirit of the influential Brechtian, absurdist \\u201cRing\\u201d that Ruth Berghaus staged in Frankfurt in the mid-80s.\", \"Jones\\u2019s \\u201cRing\\u201d was a notorious fiasco, with the catcalls \\u2014 brought on by Rhinemaidens in fat suits, Fricka driving what looked like a black cab, Beckettian giants, childlike drawings and tribal masks \\u2014 making the front pages of local newspapers. It was enough, in his telling, to scare Jones off opera for a bit. (During his break, among other projects, he directed the 1997 musical \\u201cTitanic,\\u201d which surmounted a raft of early technical issues to become a Broadway hit.)\", \"But he has since returned in earnest to opera houses with productions including a melancholy, dreamlike \\u201cH\\u00e4nsel und Gretel\\u201d that has been a frequent holiday presence at the Met since it arrived there in 2007. A surreal image from that production recurs in Jones\\u2019s \\u201cWalk\\u00fcre\\u201d: The fish and trees in dress suits from \\u201cH\\u00e4nsel\\u201d are now shadowy figures on the margins of the set, with human bodies and the oversize heads of birds.\", \"English National Opera \\u2014 performing, as is its custom, in English translation \\u2014 has brought together an excellent British cast committed to Jones\\u2019s vision. Nicholls\\u2019s voice isn\\u2019t huge, but it\\u2019s penetrating and sweet, and she\\u2019s convincingly a smart, brave if headstrong teenager. The tenor Nicky Spence is a robust, ne\\u2019er-do-well Siegmund; Emma Bell\\u2019s strong yet mellow soprano, full through its range, vibrates with emotion as Sieglinde; the bass Brindley Sherratt is a brooding, bruising Hunding.\", \"Suffering from a cold, Susan Bickley acted Fricka while the mezzo-soprano Claire Barnett-Jones \\u2014 one of the Valkyries \\u2014 sang it, with articulate power, from the side of the stage. Martyn Brabbins, the company\\u2019s music director, led a lethargic first act that later improved in responsiveness, without ever feeling truly urgent. (At the Met, Yannick N\\u00e9zet-S\\u00e9guin will conduct a different set of singers.)\", \"Not everything works in the staging: When the action is this exposed, any false step is magnified. Siegmund and Sieglinde end the first act running around in big circles, which came across as silly. And while the agonizing stillness of Br\\u00fcnnhilde and especially Wotan in their long final scene is effective in theory, Rose and Jones do not quite sell his endless impassivity, and the tension sometimes slackens.\", \"But all in all, this will be a tonic for the Met and its audience, conditioned by the Lepage era \\u2014 and the monumental, 19th-century-style Otto Schenk staging that preceded it \\u2014 to think that the \\u201cRing\\u201d can\\u2019t be put on without impossible extravagance and expense. Jones offers a reacquaintance with the intimate drama at the heart of the magic fire.\", \"Oh, but about those flames. Even with a production this seemingly uncomplicated, it just wouldn\\u2019t be a \\u201cRing\\u201d without technical complications. Days before Friday\\u2019s premiere, the local government vetoed the crucial, climactic fire effect to ensure the safety of the century-old Coliseum. So Br\\u00fcnnhilde, wrapped in Wotan\\u2019s jacket, was lifted toward the flies \\u2014 and remained suspended there as the stage stayed cold and bare.\", \"Yes, the Jones \\u201cRing,\\u201d just like its Lepage predecessor \\u2014 whose rainbow bridge stalled on the opening night of \\u201cDas Rheingold\\u201d \\u2014 has officially begun with a headache. Perhaps the Met should start working on those fire code approvals now.\"]","href_hash":"50b9919e4b0011ec868f4b0cff356b72"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"50b9919e4b0011ec868f4b0cff356b72"}},
