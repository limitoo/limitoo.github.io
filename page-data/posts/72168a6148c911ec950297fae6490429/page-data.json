This included more than 2000 overdue Priority 1 tasks that were critical to getting clients set up and on the road to recovery.\", \"This was down from around 55,000 overdue tasks in July, ACC said.\", \"Most of the backlog was \\\"Assisted Recovery\\\" where most ACC clients were managed by teams of people. There was currently a queue of more than 31,000 tasks overdue.\", \"RNZ reported in August that staff had told their union colleagues were dropping like flies as a result of overwhelming caseloads following a $74 million restructure of its case management system designed to improve efficiency.\", \"ACC executives later admitted to MPs it was struggling to clear some 41,767 overdue tasks, with some more than seven months overdue.\", \"The Public Service Union said staff caseloads were still high.\", \"PSA organiser Brodie Croucher said \\\"I'd like to say that we've seen a big improvement in the workload, but that's not what our members are saying\\\".\", \"Some members reported several tasks belonging to a client were being merged into one in order to make the numbers look better, he said.\", \"\\\"I have heard that has happened.
