Onstage, Spears maintained control over her body, otherwise the subject of constant scrutiny \\u2014 about her virginity, her weight, her wardrobe. Through movement, she conjured a world of her own making in which she really was the boss.\", \"With her expansive arm gestures, rapid-fire turns and abdominal dexterity, Spears has always used dance to communicate her strength. Brian Friedman, the choreographer responsible for some of Spears\\u2019s most famous routines, noted that there was a visible change in her approach to dancing after the conservatorship was put in place in 2008.\", \"\\u201cI feel like that was her way of being able to be in control of something, because she didn\\u2019t have control over so much,\\u201d Friedman said in a phone interview. \\u201cSo by being able to step into the studio and say \\u2018I don\\u2019t want to do this, I want to do this, I\\u2019m going to make up my own thing,\\u2019 it gave her some kind of power.\\u201d\", \"When Spears announced \\u201can indefinite work hiatus\\u201d in early 2019, she began posting videos of herself dancing to Instagram. Most of these clips show her twirling alone, in a loose, visibly improvised style, on the marble floor of her California home.\", \"In the videos, she looks straight at the camera, breaking her gaze only for the occasional turn, or to flip her hair. This isn\\u2019t the movement of the practiced stage performer and pop star; it\\u2019s more exploratory, as if she were searching for the right step or feeling instead of trying to nail it.\", \"Under the conservatorship, Spears\\u2019s videos became the subject of debate and speculation. While some fans cheered her on, others were bothered by her lack of polish and level stare. \\u201cDoes anyone ever feel awkward or uncomfortable watching this?\\u201d someone asked in the comments of a post in February.\", \"For Spears, though, the point was simple. It\\u2019s about \\u201cfinding my love for dancing again,\\u201d she wrote in a March post. In others, she said that she moves like this for up to three hours a day, taping her feet to avoid getting blisters.\", \"For dancers and choreographers who have worked with Spears, her Instagram\\u2019s focus on dance made sense. \\u201cIn a period of time when she did not have freedom, that gave her freedom,\\u201d Friedman said.\", \"Sharing her improvised dance sessions also allowed her to connect directly with fans. Brooke Lipton, who danced with Spears from 2001 to 2008, said in a phone interview that Spears\\u2019s \\u201cdancing told the world she needed help \\u2014 without saying anything, because she couldn\\u2019t.\\u201d\", \"If Spears can still show off the occasional fouett\\u00e9 turns, in which she spins on one leg, it\\u2019s because of a lifetime training in the dance studio. Lipton, Friedman and others say that Spears matched the range and commitment of professional dancers, with a preternatural knack for picking up choreography on the fly.\", \"\\u201cShe grew up dancing,\\u201d said Tania Baron, who started performing at shopping malls with the budding star in 1998. \\u201cThere are artists who dance certain parts of a show. There are artists who are just natural movers. Then you\\u2019ve got people like Britney, who can really dance just like her dancers.\\u201d\", \"Spears\\u2019s care and attention to how she presented herself in movement speak to how she understood her body as a dancer does \\u2014 as an artistic instrument. Top-level choreographers might have been creating dances for her, but they were also working for other pop stars. The difference, Elizabeth Bergman, a scholar of commercial dance, said in a phone interview, is \\u201cthe way she\\u2019s doing them.\\u201d\", \"In the years before the conservatorship, Spears carefully chose the choreographers she worked with. Valerie Moise, also known as Raistalla, who danced in Spears\\u2019s concerts and videos in 2008 and 2009, points out that these collaborations contributed to the longstanding popularity of jazz funk, known for its defiant, hard-hitting moves.\", \"\\u201cThis is a style that is almost like a culture to her,\\u201d Moise said in a phone interview. \\u201cIt accentuates how she wants to express herself.\\u201d\", \"And Spears did something more than just continue in the tradition of the pop artists who danced before her.\", \"\\u201cOf course there was Madonna, and Michael and Janet, and they were fantastic,\\u201d Lipton said. \\u201cBut dance was also evolving at a time when Wade and Brian were stepping up the expectations of what dancers could do,\\u201d she added, referring to Spears\\u2019s frequent choreographers, Wade Robson and Friedman. Their routines were faster than those of the previous generation, with more movement and action per beat. \\u201cEvery count was being filled,\\u201d Lipton said.\", \"When learning routines from choreographers, Spears would speak up when they included steps that did not feel right on her body, sometimes suggesting her own moves instead. \\u201cShe was very much the boss,\\u201d Baron said about Spears at the beginning of her career. \\u201cNot in a mean way. But if she didn\\u2019t like something, she would make it known.\\u201d\", \"From an early age, Spears recognized dance as a medium in which presence and artistry can\\u2019t be faked. \\u201cWhen you\\u2019re dancing, you just can\\u2019t do a step, you\\u2019ve got to get into it,\\u201d she said when she was a 12-year-old star of \\u201cThe Mickey Mouse Club.\\u201d\", \"Randy Connor, who choreographed Spears\\u2019s routine in the classic \\u201c \\u2026 Baby One More Time\\u201d video, said he believed her ability to convey her feelings with and through her body was a major part of her initial star appeal. \\u201cIt resonated with so many people because of her conviction in the movement,\\u201d he said in a phone interview.\", \"Coming up in an industry known for its artifice, Spears used dance as a means of transparency with fans. Everyone knows there is no such thing as dance-syncing.\", \"\\u201cThat was truly how she communicated as an artist,\\u201d Friedman said. Even before the start of Spears\\u2019s conservatorship, he added, \\u201cshe couldn\\u2019t really say everything she wanted in public, in interviews. But when she danced, it was unapologetic.\\u201d\", \"Spears\\u2019s songs became coming-of-age and coming-out anthems, and learning her moves enabled fans to explore aspects of their identities with the same boldness she projected with her body. Imitating her performances allowed them to \\u201cfeel the spirit of Britney,\\u201d as Jack says on the TV show \\u201cWill & Grace,\\u201d after doing the shoulder lifts and arm pumps that are part of the routine to \\u201cOops! \\u2026 I Did It Again.\\u201d\", \"Lipton emphasizes that Spears chose her steps so that anyone watching could move along with her.\", \"\\u201cShe would do the choreography just a little bit less,\\u201d Lipton said. \\u201cIn a moment where we\\u2019re doing all of these turns and slams, she just smiles and points her fingers out, before joining back in. It wasn\\u2019t unattainable.\\u201d\", \"If Spears embraced her strength in movement along with her fans, many commentators did not, often describing her dancing as if it were a ploy used to compensate for lack of talent. Other young female pop stars like Jessica Simpson and Avril Lavigne boasted about not dancing, as if this made them more authentic artists. In 2002, The Associated Press identified a crop of \\u201cAnti-Britneys\\u201d who supposedly challenged the idea that you have to \\u201ccavort in tight clothes to be sexy and successful in pop music.\\u201d\", \"Friedman says that Spears\\u2019s dancing was about her artistry, not manufactured sex appeal.\", \"\\u201cAs Britney\\u2019s choreographer for many years, I never set out to make movements to pleasure anyone else,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt was about how I could make her feel empowered in her body.\\u201d\", \"In the 2008 documentary \\u201cBritney: For the Record,\\u201d filmed in the early days of the conservatorship, Spears speaks as if already aware of how important dance would become for her under the control of others.\", \"\\u201cDancing is a huge part of me and who I am. It\\u2019s like something that my spirit just has to do,\\u201d she says. \\u201cI\\u2019d be dead without dancing.\\u201d\", \"Arguing for the conservatorship\\u2019s termination 13 years later, she identified one of her breaking points as the moment when she was refused the right even to this control over her body. Spears said that at a dance rehearsal in early 2019, after saying that she wanted to modify a step in the choreography, she was informed that she was not cooperating.\", \"She declared her response firmly in court: \\u201cI can say no to a dance move.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"b04728cc6fa111ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b04728cc6fa111ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
