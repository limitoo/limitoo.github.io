The additional ICU beds are planned to be operational in Canterbury, Waitemat\\u0101, and Bay of Plenty DHBs next year.\\u00a0\", \"Little argues that additional ICU beds are only part of the solution and that the Government's strategy was to prevent people needing ICU by driving vaccination. The latest data shows 89 percent of the eligible population is fully vaccinated.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Andrew Connolly will correct me if I'm wrong, but 100 percent of those who wound up in ICU are unvaccinated,\\\" Little said.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Exactly right minister, the double dose appears to have prevented any New Zealander entering the ICU,\\\" Dr Connolly replied.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Certainly no fully vaccinated patients with COVID have ended up in ICU.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"There have been, of course, very elderly patients double dosed who due to their general comorbidities and so forth have died with COVID, not necessarily of, but clinicians discussing with their families felt that ICU care was not appropriate.\\\"\", \"Dr Reti is disappointed there will be no extra ICU beds until June 2022 - a revelation Little made in Parliament last week.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"The Government has wasted the best part of two years pretending this wasn't an issue and has now lost valuable time in building our COVID defences, putting the health of New Zealanders at risk,\\\" Dr Reti said.\\u00a0\", \"Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has defended the Government's ICU capacity by pointing to the nearly 1400 extra nurses trained to be able to work in an ICU environment under supervision.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"One of the most important things that needed to be provided are not just the beds but the staffing of the beds. Five nurses are required for every ICU,\\\" she said in Parliament.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"Five ICU nurses are required per bed, so not only have we got 300 ICU or high dependency unit beds and the ability to surge to 500, we put aside funding in the Budget to ensure that we could train the staff required for the additional beds that we have.\\\"\\u00a0\", \"But despite the Government allocating 300 spaces in managed isolation and quarantine (MIQ), for critical healthcare workers in October, the Ministry of Health said only about 79 slots available to December 15 were filled - and that was for all healthcare workers, not just nurses.\"]","href_hash":"71ccfe075e5211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"71ccfe075e5211ecb4996f5ba193d428"}},
