Right from the outset, he has led by example - both in the way he trains, prepares, and in the way he contributes to the culture of our team.

God works in mysterious ways, to be here and then called into the Moana Pasifika team, it was something I didn't think twice about.\", \"\\\"From the bottom of my heart, on behalf of my family, my wife, my village, I want to thank Aaron and the management team, and the team for the support and for allowing me to lead them into battle as the first ever Moana Pasifika team.
