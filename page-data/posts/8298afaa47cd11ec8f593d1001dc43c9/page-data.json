political system underwent major reforms in 2010.\", \"The former king relinquished many of his powers, enabling voters to elect the majority of MPs.\", \"Today approximately 64,000\\u00a0eligible voters will have their say by electing 17\\u00a0members\\u00a0of parliament, or the commoners as they are\\u00a0known in the kingdom.\", \"The other nine seats in the Fale Alea (Legislative Assembly) go to nobles, who are still chosen by their peers rather than the people.\", \"Pacific political commentator Associate Professor\\u00a0Malakai Koloamatangi said this election had particular significance as it was the first\\u00a0since the death of former prime minister\\u00a0\\u02bbAkilisi P\\u014dhiva, who died in 2019.\", \"<img

prime minister, is not a part of,\\\" Associate Professor\\u00a0Koloamatangi said.\", \"Prime Minister Pohiva Tu\\u02bbi\\u02bbonetoa\\u00a0was elected soon after Mr Pohiva's death.\\u00a0\", \"Additionally, pandemic-related border closures mean thousands of Tongans\\u00a0either stuck or working overseas,\\u00a0will not be able to cast their vote, including\\u00a0an estimated 5,000

get to a ballot box, the key issue for most voters will be the drugs crisis that Tonga is struggling to cope with.\", \"\\\"It's taking everyone by surprise,\\\" Mr Halahala said.\", \"\\\"Tonga is not used to this stuff and the change that comes with it; it's just overwhelming for everyone.\\\"\", \"Tonga is no longer just a transit point for drug smugglers taking their product from South\\u00a0America to large markets in Australia and New Zealand \\u2014 the kingdom has seen a dramatic rise in the use of illicit drugs including cocaine and methamphetamine\", \"\\\"We visit a lot of communities ... here in Tonga, all around the other islands, and we've seen the problems.\\\"\", \"Mr Halahala\\u00a0said a higher number of students dropped out of school this year than the past three years\\u00a0and that substance abuse was one of the main factors.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/652ed1224294d7dce5faeca7ad8cc808\\\"

women and children.(Supplied:\\u00a0Women and Children Crisis Centre)</div>\", \"Director of Tonga's Women and Children Crisis Centre (WCCC) Ofa Gutenbeil Likiliki\\u00a0agrees the country is at crisis point, with the situation worsening significantly in the past five years, since Tonga's last election.\", \"\\\"What the crisis centre is trying to do [is to] get decision-makers and key stakeholders to understand the strong link between the drug impact on gender-based violence and ... all forms of violence against women and children,\\\" Ms Gutenbeil Likiliki said.\", \"\\\"Because right now, there's a disconnect, thinking that they\\u00a0are two separate issues.\", \"\\\"All our issues are interconnected, we can't just deal with one as an isolated issue, we have to kind of address all our issues together, because it impacts on each other.\\\"\", \"With a population of just 100,000, Ms Gutenbeil Likiliki and Mr Halahala believe fixing the country's drug problem is possible, but Associate Professor Koloamatangi said\\u00a0it was only possible through help\\u00a0from wealthier neighbours.\", \"\\\"It's difficult because the problem is not created in Tonga and the reason for the [drug] trade is also not found in Tonga specifically,\\\" Associate Professor Koloamatangi said.\", \"\\\"So other nations will have to come to the party for Tonga to be able to resolve this issue.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Government corruption 'a major issue'</div>\", \"Anti-corruption organisation Transparency International surveyed 6,000 adults from across Pacific Islands and found\\u00a061 per cent\\u00a0thought corruption was a significant problem in their government.\", \"Mapa Taumololo, an independent candidate running\\u00a0in today's election, said Tonga was\\u00a0no exception.\", \"\\\"That's the major issue I've heard from the communities,\\\" Mr Taumololo said.\", \"\\\"They really want leaders to fight against corruption.\\\"\", \"At 33, he is one of the youngest in the field of 73 candidates in the running\\u00a0for one of the 17 seats.\", \"Mr Taumololo previously worked\\u00a0in the public service, but now he wants to try and create change from within the government.\", \"\\\"I realised there's lots of loopholes in the system, and also the parliamentary procedures,\\\" he said.\", \"In July, a government minister and her husband were\\u00a0jailed for misappropriating money from a vocational education program that had received Australian government funding.\", \"While in March 2020, former prime minister Lord Tu'ivakan was found guilty over his role in a passports-for-sale scandal involving Chinese nationals.\", \"Mr Taumololo believes voters in his constituency have had enough of poor behaviour.\", \"\\\"They are very supportive of trying to establish the anti-corruption commission to fight against corruption in Tonga,\\\" he said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">COVID in Tonga</div>\", \"Tonga recorded its first case of\\u00a0COVID-19 in October this year after\\u00a0a case was detected in a traveller\\u00a0from New Zealand.\\u00a0\", \"According to the World Health Organization, it remains Tonga's only case to date.\", \"Associate Professor Koloamatangi said, like elsewhere in the world, today's elections will be \\\"a COVID-19 election\\\".\", \"\\\"That means a lot will depend on what the government has done in managing the pandemic and keeping the country safe in terms of border closures and lockdowns.\\\"\", \"But Mr Taumololo\\u00a0said voters\\u00a0will\\u00a0also be looking ahead to how a new government handles COVID-19 and how it might reopen Tonga's border.\", \"\\\"They're concerned that the Ministry of Health does not have the capacity ... to cater for, I think, more than 15 or 16 [active] cases,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We are at risk, the whole of our communities, because we're not ready, facility-wise and capacity-wise.\\\"\", \"Associate Professor Koloamatangi said as\\u00a0the world moves\\u00a0to living with COVID, international aid from countries like Australia will be vital in Tonga's reopening and management of the disease.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Female numbers 'aren't looking great'</div>\", \"Currently, Losaline Ma'asi is the only female MP in Tonga and of the 73 candidates running in the election, just 12 are women.\", \"\\\"We're still struggling to get more women into parliament, even though we've had some constitutional and legislative reforms.\", \"\\\"That's connected back to ... our cultural and our traditional and religious kind of thinking that the biggest decision making positions should be reserved for men.\", \"\\\"And so to change that it will mean a generational kind of investment.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"8298afaa47cd11ec8f593d1001dc43c9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8298afaa47cd11ec8f593d1001dc43c9"}},
