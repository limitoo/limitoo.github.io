Is it valid to negatively judge Democrats for being forced to use dark money to level the playing field after Republicans\\u2019 long history of influencing elections with dark money? Dark money shouldn\\u2019t be legal, but it is. Until that changes Democrats can\\u2019t be held to a higher standard that puts their candidates at a serious disadvantage to Republicans.\", \"Gail M. BartlettChicago\", \"To the Editor:\", \"While your front-page story provided a great analysis of \\u201cdark money\\u201d spending in the 2020 election, it did not highlight who is working for and against regulation and transparency in campaign spending.\", \"For the past three years, my organization has been part of the Declaration for American Democracy coalition, working to pass the For the People Act. This legislation will reduce the influence of money in politics and create more robust ethics rules for elected officials.\", \"Almost every House and Senate Democrat has endorsed this legislation, and it has broad support from Democratic, independent and Republican voters. Conversely, every Republican member of Congress has voted against these bills when they\\u2019ve come up for a vote.\", \"I encourage all of us, when writing about subjects that significantly shape our elections, to think about who is working for the people and who is standing in the way of change.\", \"Alex MorganChicagoThe writer is executive director of the Progressive Turnout Project.\", \"To the Editor:\", \"While it would be healthy for the nation to regulate or eliminate dark money, I cannot criticize Democratic large donors for preserving their anonymity. There was a fair chance that Donald Trump, the most vengeful president in my time and probably in the nation\\u2019s history, was going to be re-elected.

He said they \\u201care being treated so unfairly.\\u201d\", \"These words are important on three levels. First, he\\u2019s seriously thinking about running in 2024.
