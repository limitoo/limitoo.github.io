Nathan. The jurors were a part of an initial pool of 600 candidates. Nathan reduced the candidates down to 40 to 60 potential jurors where the final 12 jurors and six alternates were selected.\", \"Maxwell's lawyer previously asked the judge for the jury questionnaire and the oral questions of the jurors to be placed under seal. The judge denied that request. However, the judge did agree to allow the jurors to only be identified by number to protect privacy, something that is common in federal trials, Law and Crime reported.\", \"The jurors will remain anonymous throughout the trial and will only be referred to by their numbers. They are expected to listen to opening statements later in the day Monday. The trial is expected to last six weeks.\", \"Maxwell, 59, has pleaded not guilty to the charges brought against her.

Authorities charged Maxwell in July 2020, arresting her after tracking her to a $1 million New Hampshire estate where she had been holed up during the coronavirus pandemic.\", \"Maxwell vehemently denies any wrongdoing. The British socialite, jailed in Brooklyn since her arrest, has called the claims against her \\\"absolute rubbish.\\\" Maxwell's lawyers and family said she was Epstein's pawn, now paying \\\"a blood price\\\" to satisfy public desire to see someone held accountable for his crimes.\", \"The wealthy, Oxford-educated Maxwell is the daughter of British newspaper magnate Robert Maxwell, who died in 1991 after falling off his yacht\\u2014named the Lady Ghislaine\\u2014near the Canary Islands.
