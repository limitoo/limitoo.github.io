A limited edition poster of \\u201cHigh Noon.\\u201d Some rare postage stamps featuring Frank Sinatra. These were just some pieces of the thousands of dollars\\u2019 worth of Golden Age Hollywood memorabilia that Christopher and Susan Edwards had amassed by the time they turned themselves over to police in London on Oct. 30, 2013.\", \"The reclusive British couple, who were convicted the next year of murdering Susan\\u2019s elderly parents and sentenced to a minimum of 25 years in prison, are now the subjects of a tragicomic four-part television drama that leans surprisingly heavily on their Hollywood fixation. It was a consuming obsession financed, according to prosecutors, by the more than 285,000 pounds (more than $475,000 at the time) the couple stole from Susan\\u2019s parents after killing them.\", \"\\u201cLandscapers,\\u201d which premieres Monday on HBO and will air weekly, is so named because a judge concluded that Christopher Edwards killed his in-laws, at his wife\\u2019s insistence, and then buried their bodies in their back garden, planting shrubs atop the makeshift grave, where they lay undiscovered for 15 years. (The couple has always maintained that it was Susan\\u2019s mother who killed her father and that Susan then shot her mother.)\", \"The series, which stars Olivia Colman and David Thewlis as Susan and Christopher, is the first scripted drama to be written by Colman\\u2019s husband, Ed Sinclair, an actor and producer. \\u201cI studied law at university and have always been interested in what makes people commit crimes,\\u201d Sinclair, 50, said in a recent video call. \\u201cSo there was this idea of reopening the case in a more human way, because criminal justice by necessity has to see things in a very black-and-white way in terms of pure criminal guilt or not.\\u201d\", \"In a stylistic choice that may polarize viewers, Sinclair opted to explore the couple\\u2019s interior lives through the prism of Susan Edwards\\u2019s unusually fertile, movie-fueled imagination. The series is intercut with scenes from Susan\\u2019s favorite Hollywood movies, notably \\u201cHigh Noon,\\u201d whose hero (played by Gary Cooper) she associates with her husband\\u2019s staunch loyalty. There is also a lengthy sequence in which Susan imagines herself and Christopher as outlaws being hunted down by a posse dressed in Western garb.\", \"Such flights of fancy reflect the real couple\\u2019s behavior: One of many outlandish details to emerge during the trial was that Susan once tried to raise her husband\\u2019s spirits, after his brother died, by sending him letters that she pretended were from the French actor G\\u00e9rard Depardieu, one of Christopher\\u2019s favorite movie stars.\", \"But the result of these quirky elements is less a true-crime dramatization than a fantastical exploration of an emotionally fragile criminal whose misdeeds appear to have been driven by a sense of her own victimization. If this approach creates a surprising amount of sympathy for convicted murders, Sinclair also sees it as a valid way to plumb the mysteries of human motivation.\", \"He attempted to deepen his understanding of the couple by establishing a correspondence with Susan and Christopher through Susan\\u2019s solicitor, Douglas Hylton, who is played in the series, a coproduction of HBO and Britain\\u2019s Sky by the British actor Dipo Ola.\", \"\\u201cOne of the things I discussed in my first letter to Susan was that there were some things in this story that were hard to believe and frankly comical, and she agreed,\\u201d Sinclair said. \\u201cShe was definitely aware of that.\\u201d\", \"The letters gave Sinclair a chance to add texture to the couple\\u2019s back story, but there was no discussion of the crime. (Sinclair asked the Edwardses about the killings in at least one letter, but they told him later that they never received it, he said.) In the script, Sinclair homed in on accusations Susan had made that her father sexually abused her. These allegations, which the judge said he believed during the trial, provided Sinclair with the \\u201cemotional heart\\u201d of his story.\", \"\\u201cI always had this idea that Susan\\u2019s childhood experience meant that she was essentially an alien who landed on earth aged 11, when the abuse stopped,\\u201d he said.\", \"Colman, 47, whose performance as Queen Anne in \\u201cThe Favourite\\u201d (2019) won her an Academy Award for best actress, plays Susan as an unfailingly polite woman with a fragile grasp on reality.\", \"\\u201cI have heard of many stories of women, in particular, who have taken a life because they have been at the hands of an aggressor or been tortured, or victims of domestic violence for years, sometimes decades,\\u201d she said in a recent telephone interview. \\u201cHumans get to the point where they snap.\\u201d\", \"One of the biggest challenges about the role, which the actress found exciting, was having to segue between reality-based scenes and the alternative fantasy universe that Susan has dreamed up for herself.\", \"\\u201cI think with a survivor of childhood abuse, the fact that they\\u2019ve kept going \\u2014 there\\u2019s got to be an enormous strength in there,\\u201d she said. \\u201cI can really understand why you would want to go into an imaginary world.\\u201d\", \"Bringing this imaginary universe to life was the task of the Japanese-English filmmaker Will Sharpe, who directed all four episodes. Sharpe, 35, had already directed Colman in two seasons of the British television series \\u201cFlowers\\u201d and in the recent biopic \\u201cThe Electrical Life of Louis Wain.\\u201d He stepped in after Alexander Payne, the original director, withdrew.\", \"Sharpe used a variety of techniques to express the vagaries of Susan\\u2019s imagination and Walter Mitty-like existence. These included colored lens filters, dramatic re-enactments of past events told from multiple perspectives and heightened romantic scenes in which Christopher and Susan are presented as idealized Hollywood versions of themselves.\", \"\\u201cI was trying to understand Susan as somebody who found herself in a reality where she felt a bit trapped and was longing for some kind of freedom,\\u201d Sharpe said in a recent video interview. \\u201cMaybe what she got from these films and the open plains of the Wild West was some sense of fleeting freedom.\\u201d\", \"Sharpe, who has bipolar II disorder, has shown in series like \\u201cFlowers\\u201d (which he also wrote and acted in) that he is attracted to characters who exist on the fringes and who struggle with mental health problems.\", \"\\u201cI want to understand the world from their point of view, rather than just dismiss them as people who are oddballs,\\u201d he said.\", \"The director felt himself drawing on his own feelings of alienation. \\u201cAnother factor is having moved to the U.K. from Japan when I was a kid,\\u201d he said. \\u201cOr maybe just being mixed-race means that in Japan I feel British, and here I feel Japanese. It means that I don\\u2019t feel completely somewhere, if that makes any sense.\\u201d\", \"Sinclair credits Sharpe for \\u201cfinding a visual language for the psychological elements and I suppose the mental health elements of this show.\\u201d Both saw the comic aspects of the story as a way to balance out its darker themes.\", \"\\u201cI think that my natural bent is to look for humor in things,\\u201d Sinclair said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s partly out of an English embarrassment of talking about anything too serious.\\u201d At the same time he does not want audiences to over-empathize with Susan and Christopher.\", \"\\u201cThey committed, in all likelihood, terrible crimes,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThere\\u2019s no escaping that, and there are surviving relatives of the victims. I hope that this is not too upsetting for them to watch.\\u201d\", \"But while his aim was not to rehabilitate the couple\\u2019s image, he concluded that humanizing them could be productive, from a dramatic standpoint.\", \"\\u201cI kept asking myself what makes us do certain things,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHow much agency do we have over what we do? I thought that was an interesting enough question to ask to justify taking a sympathetic approach to the perpetrators.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"45157fce56c211ec81e2d9c2c94c69a6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"45157fce56c211ec81e2d9c2c94c69a6"}},
