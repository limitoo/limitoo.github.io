Sometime during the interminable weekend, my mother, probably in an alcohol-fueled moment of candor, spilled the beans.\", \"I had never heard of a Josephite marriage, a union inspired by the relationship between Joseph and the Virgin Mary, the mother of Jesus. And to this day, I am astonished that my parents undertook a similar path with the blessing of the Roman Catholic Church. While their arrangement did not comply with the strict definition of a Josephite relationship \\u2014 for they entered marriage without the intention of a celibate union \\u2014 such pacts remain an option for Catholics seeking a higher spiritual plane.\", \"My father was a worldly 32 and my mother a winsome 19 when they met. He was a doctor completing his training at Queens General Hospital, now known as Queens Hospital Center. She was a student nurse in clinical training there. He was agnostic, though his parents were Presbyterian. She was Catholic. They eloped, were married by a Lutheran minister, and produced four children. Dad had a severe heart attack at 46. This brush with death prompted him to convert to Catholicism.\", \"After he recovered from his heart attack, my father undertook religious training from our assistant pastor, the Dublin-born Rev. Patrick O\\u2019Brien, a rosy-cheeked, rotund fellow who could have come from central casting. I remember that every Wednesday night my mother would serve roast leg of lamb with mint jelly for the benefit of our ordained visitor. This was far from the typical weeknight fare in our Texas household.\", \"Not long thereafter, my three siblings and I noticed that our parents\\u2019 double bed was replaced by twin beds. My younger sister inquired about this. The sharp tone of our mother\\u2019s answer precluded further discussion: \\u201cYour father needs his rest!\\u201d\", \"My three siblings and I accepted this without question.\", \"What we didn\\u2019t know was that my father had been married before meeting my mother. His first marriage lasted about two years, and because the church refused to recognize the divorce and end of that union, my parents could not receive the sacrament of matrimony.\", \"During my father\\u2019s immersion into Catholicism, it was pointed out that without the sacrament of matrimony performed by a priest, my parents were technically living in sin. Mortal sin. Every Catholic schoolchild knew the consequences: Mortal sin without absolution meant eternal damnation! And what of the legitimacy of the children?\", \"My father tried repeatedly to have his first marriage annulled. The church declined. Grounds for Catholic annulment were much more strict before reforms introduced in the U.S. in 1968. To the best of my knowledge, my father\\u2019s first marriage did not meet the church\\u2019s requirements of that era.\", \"But it did offer a different solution. Mom and Dad, with the bishop\\u2019s permission, and after taking a solemn vow, could leave the marital bed and replace it with chaste cohabitation.\", \"According to an official document that still bears the embossed seals and signatures of various church officials and Catholic entities, they could \\u201ccontinue to cohabit in the manner of brother and sister.\\u201d I have the letter, dated March 5, 1962, from a diocesan marriage tribunal, a \\u201ccuria matrimonialis,\\u201d in which both my parents swear to adhere to this arrangement \\u2014 or face losing access to the sacraments and the blessing of the church. Mom was 34; Dad was 47.\", \"Dad and I, as well as my younger sister, were later confirmed by the bishop on the same night at Shrine of the True Cross Church in Dickinson, Texas.\", \"Secrecy was paramount. \\u201cNo one is to know of the brother-sister relationship except the Advocate Father O\\u2019Brien, the Pastor, the Tribunal, and the confessors of the parties,\\u201d the tribunal\\u2019s letter said. It mentioned avoiding \\u201cnotoriety\\u201d and \\u201cscandal.\\u201d Of course, even in the 1960s, one would think that not having sex with your spouse would fall on the low end of the scandal spectrum.\", \"[Sign up for Love Letter and always get the latest in Modern Love, weddings, and relationships in the news by email.]\", \"All this may seem like an artifact of the past, but a 2010 article in the publication Catholic Exchange explained that in addition to conventional marriage, there still exists \\u201cthe type of marriage Joseph and Mary had and is sometimes referred to as a Josephite marriage.\\u201d Married celibates, according to the article, give up sex \\u201cbecause they hope to live a life that points the way to what will come in the next life, to something better and higher.\\u201d\", \"Robert Sullivan, a regular writer for the Catholic Exchange and a lawyer from Nebraska, told me that Josephite-like arrangements can be used to circumvent \\u201csome kind of impediment to marriage\\u201d as well as to \\u201cdeepen a person\\u2019s faith.\\u201d\", \"I couldn\\u2019t help but wonder if the Catholic church continues to structure these arrangements for couples who request such a union.\", \"\\u201cIt is extremely rare that people today request a Josephite marriage,\\u201d said Christopher West, the president of the Theology of the Body Institute, which promotes a healthy understanding of sex within the teachings of the Catholic Church. \\u201cI do know of a couple who a few years ago discerned that they were called to live a Josephite marriage. Their motivation was carefully evaluated by their local diocese.\\u201d\", \"Mr. West added, \\u201cThe normal path to holiness in marriage is to sanctify the marriage bed, not to sacrifice the marriage bed.\\u201d\", \"The prevailing view of theologians is that the special physical relationship of Mary and Joseph \\u2014 the original Josephite marriage \\u2014 endured throughout their lives.\", \"As for my parents, nine years after my father\\u2019s heart attack and their decision to have a celibate marriage, his first wife died. On an ordinary Tuesday evening in 1970, Mom and Dad were married in secrecy at our parish church. Two tight-lipped family friends served as witnesses. My mother said, \\u201cAs I recall, we went out for a drink afterward.\\u201d\", \"The twin beds in my parents\\u2019 bedroom were replaced by one big one. Yet again, my younger sister asked about the rearrangement.\", \"My mother\\u2019s brusque reply: \\u201cYour father is feeling much better!\\u201d\", \"Yes, I suppose he was feeling better, reunited with Mom and, at long last, their union recognized for what it was.\", \" \", \"I told this story when I delivered the eulogy at my mother\\u2019s funeral mass at Shrine of the True Cross in May 2019. I\\u2019m sure it was news to most of her many friends in the church that day.The current pastor didn\\u2019t know about her complicated marital history, and I was a little nervous about how he\\u2019d respond.\", \"But after I sat down, he took the pulpit. \\u201cI can\\u2019t explain or excuse the things the church asked of people more than 50 years ago,\\u201d the priest said. \\u201cBut it\\u2019s clear how important it was to Betty and Bill that their marriage be blessed by the church. Without judging what they went through, we can admire and appreciate their resolve and their sacrifice to enter the sanctity of marriage.\\u201d\", \"There is still a lot I don\\u2019t understand about a celibate union, but what harm did it do? Our brood of four siblings might have been increased by a few more souls. But my parents didn\\u2019t seem to feel shortchanged, so who am I to question things. During her long years as a widow, Mom recalled, \\u201cIt was what we had to do to be together. It wasn\\u2019t so bad.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e2bec083479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e2bec083479011ec95f0355d5e14661e"}},
