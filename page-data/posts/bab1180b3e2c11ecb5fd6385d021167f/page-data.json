Donald Trump's margin over Joe Biden with this segment of women voters was 12 points, a far smaller margin.\", \"There was little change in vote preference among White women with college degrees. They mostly remained in the Democratic camp.\\u00a0 McAuliffe's winning margin with this group was similar to Joe Biden's in 2020.\\u00a0\", \"In recent elections, we've seen divides among White voters by education: College-educated voters have been more likely to vote Democratic and those without college degrees more likely to vote Republican, but the shift among the latter group in this election is notable.\", \"Here's a closer look at what drove the vote among this group of women voters:\", \"Sixty-three percent of White women without college degrees said they \\\"strongly disapprove\\\" of the job Biden is doing as president. This figure is higher than the 56% of voters in this demographic group who voted against Biden in 2020. Moreover, four in 10 White women without degrees said one reason for their vote in the race for governor was to oppose Biden. \\u00a0\", \"Considering their strong support for Youngkin, it's not that surprising that this group of women voters were far more likely to have a favorable view of him than McAuliffe, but more of them also had a positive opinion of Youngkin compared to former President Trump. Seventy-two percent of White women without college degrees viewed Youngkin favorably, while 60% viewed Trump favorably.\", \"Youngkin made schools and education a key part of his campaign, and this resonated with White women without college degrees. Two-thirds said parents should have \\\"a lot\\\" of say in what's taught in their child's school, compared to just 39% of White women with degrees who said parents should have that much say.\", \"Democrats can win elections, and often have, without majority support from White voters without college degrees \\u2014 both men and women. But it becomes more difficult for them to assemble a majority coalition with such low support from such a large group. \\u00a0\", \"For Breaking News & Analysis Download the Free CBS News app\"]","href_hash":"bab1180b3e2c11ecb5fd6385d021167f"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"bab1180b3e2c11ecb5fd6385d021167f"}},
