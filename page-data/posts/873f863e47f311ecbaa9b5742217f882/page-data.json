That's probably twofold, one, there's a whole lot of people who've been a bit nervous to commit and so the first one would be visiting friends and relatives and then the second one is people that have been holding off taking a holiday and going a little bit stir crazy not being able to get out of Auckland.\\\"\", \"Accommodation bookings had been rising steadily over the past few weeks, and those booking were asking about health and safety, he said.\", \"\\\"People are very much looking to providers that have some evidence or some form of information around the Covid policy as it relates to cleanliness and sanitisation.\\\"\", \"But buyer beware.\", \"Consumer New Zealand chief executive John Duffy said the traffic light system could change from orange to red in a region, or a traveller could test positive and have to head home.\", \"Those booking needed to check terms and conditions, he said.\", \"\\\"We know that there is a risk that there could be a lockdown and there are some accommodation providers who are saying no there will be no refunds if you can't travel due to restrictions put in place by the government.
