So it's excellent news.\\\"\", \"Northland Chamber of Commerce chief executive Steve Smith said he had mixed feelings about the change as the normally booming summer period was nearing its end.\", \"\\\"You could argue of course, and I know it's easy in hindsight, that we shouldn't have been in red to start with. I guess orange is a step forward.\\\"\", \"While businesses are celebrating this step-change in traffic lights, Tai Tokerau Border Control (TBC) has slammed the move as \\\"bloody ridiculous\\\".\", \"The group - which helped police run December's checkpoints - maintain that Northland should stay at red until 90 percent of the population has received both doses.\", \"Northland District Health Board's vaccination rate currently sit at 86 percent fully vaccinated.-\\u00a089 percent have had a single dose.\", \"TBC leader Hone Harawira said they were given a day's notice to provide feedback on moving Northland to orange, and any feedback that was put to the Government had been ignored.\", \"\\\"Kaimaumau is the only place in Northland that should be switching between red to orange. Switching the COVID-19 traffic lights from red to orange though is bloody ridiculous, and is not supported by either the iwi or health authorities in Northland.\\\"\", \"TBC regional coordinator Reuben Taipari said he felt stressed and disappointed when he heard Thursday's news.\", \"He argued that Northland - with a larger M\\u0101ori population, lower vaccination rates and worse economic and health indicators - was unique, and should be treated as such.\", \"Taipari was also concerned the move to orange would affect Tai Tokerau Border Control's ability to protect its community, with Waitangi commemorations just around the corner.\", \"\\\"With the right security and authority we could do initiatives, run good campaigns and do vigilant checkpoints to ensure the events are managed and safe for our communities.\", \"\\\"It's our responsibility to push for better conditions for them and be part of that solution and it gets reduced when we can't stand up checkpoints or take our authority as enforcement officers.\\\"\", \"Waitangi draws an influx of visitors to Te Tai Tokerau but whether this will be the case this year remains to be seen as the Government warns Omicron could be in the community any day now.\", \"Northland Chamber of Commerce's Steve Smith said businesses would be hoping to claw back any lost revenue in the coming days and weeks but the threat of Omicron may mean Te Tai Tokerau's stint in 'orange' was short-lived.\", \"\\\"It'll be interesting to see how long we stay in orange with respect to the Government's decisions in and around Omicron, but I guess that's something we can't really guess at this stage. We just don't know.\\\"\", \"The Government has made it clear that if Omicron pops up in the community, in cases not related to the border, all regions will move to the 'red' traffic light setting within 24 to 48 hours.\", \"RNZ\"]","href_hash":"37cd2c747a2911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"37cd2c747a2911ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
