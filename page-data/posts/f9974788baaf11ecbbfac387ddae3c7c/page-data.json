Here we have a clear breach of the international rules-based order.

It could save so many more lives and make so many more people safe.\\\"\", \"Ghahraman said she believed New Zealand's contribution to weapons for Ukraine was driven by diplomatic relations and alignment with international partners.\", \"\\\"In terms of where New Zealand is best-placed to get engaged in this war, it isn't by providing weapons and being that kind of actor.
