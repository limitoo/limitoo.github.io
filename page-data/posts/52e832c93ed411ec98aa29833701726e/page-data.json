In a statement, the Ministry of Health said there were 200 cases in Auckland, four in Waikato and two in Northland.\", \"The Ministry said 159 are yet to be linked to earlier cases, with 623 unlinked cases in the past 14 days.\", \"The ministry later sent through another statement saying an additional case in Northland had been confirmed. All Northland cases are close contacts of existing cases. They had all been isolating since been told they were close contacts, and as such there are no new locations of interest, Northland District Health Board said via the ministry.\", \"The DHB also said further testing of samples from the recent Mangamuka and Hokianga cases has established a link between these and an Auckland case.\", \"There are now 18 cases in the region. All are isolating at home.\", \"Two of the four new cases in Waikato have been linked to earlier cases.\", \"The Ministry said the 206 community cases numbers reported today are \\\"a reminder of the infectiousness of Covid-19, and particularly the Delta variant, and the importance of vaccination as the number one protection against the virus\\\".\", \"There are now 73 people in hospital with the coronavirus, including seven in intensive care.

Reports from hospitals was that new available treatments were making a difference, she said.\", \"\\\"We regularly check in with our health teams on the ground as to what they're seeing with hospitalisations.
