Older women, some in their 80s and 90s, hustled to pass, steal and shoot. They dribbled and wove skillfully as they sprinted toward the basket.\", \"Kirsten Cummings, a former professional basketball player, recalled the first time she walked into this Y.M.C.A. in San Diego\\u2019s Mission Valley neighborhood.\", \"\\u201cThere\\u2019s this group of women who were playing and I was so mesmerized by them. They were 75 years old,\\u201d Cummings told me. \\u201cI got goose bumps.\\u201d\", \"This is the San Diego Senior Women\\u2019s Basketball Association, one of the largest leagues in the nation for women 50 and over. California\\u2019s second-biggest city is home to several senior sports teams and hosts the San Diego Senior Games, which draws thousands of competitors from across the state for an Olympics-style event each year.\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re very outdoor-oriented, fitness-oriented, so it was a natural thing that Senior Games would flourish here,\\u201d said Cummings, who grew up in San Diego and now oversees the event. \\u201cSan Diego has people who don\\u2019t think twice about learning basketball at the age of 79.\\u201d\", \"On a recent Sunday morning, I chatted on the Y.M.C.A. court sideline with Marge Carl, who has played in the women\\u2019s league since it was founded in the mid-1990s.\", \"Carl, now 92, wore a blue jersey that matched her bright eyes. Her team, the Splash, which is for women 80 and over, was scheduled to compete in 45 minutes.\", \"The league includes 75 women across 13 teams, roughly grouped by skill level, who face off every Sunday. The games are three-on-three for 30 minutes on a half court.\", \"Carl, like most of the women here, came of age before Title IX, the 1972 civil rights law that significantly increased opportunities for women to participate in school sports. So she didn\\u2019t learn how to play basketball until her 60s.\", \"But that\\u2019s kind of her style. She graduated from college in her seventh decade. She retired well into her 80s.\", \"Carl pointed to her temple and warned me, \\u201cThis doesn\\u2019t die unless you let it.\\u201d\", \"For her 90th birthday, she went skydiving: \\u201cThere was a man strapped to my back. How bad could it be?\\u201d\", \"Newbies to the basketball league learn to guard and rebound in its rookie training program. And once on a team, players might have 40 years or more to fine-tune their skills.\", \"Cummings, who has coached the Splash as a volunteer, said she was initially surprised by the older women\\u2019s desire to improve. She once slept through a practice and was reprimanded by a player in her 80s.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ll tell you, I never missed practice after that,\\u201d Cummings said. \\u201cThe more I coached them the more I got to see past that facade of, you know, they\\u2019re sweet old ladies. No, these are serious senior athletes.\\u201d\", \"The league also thwarts the slow creep of loneliness that comes with aging.\", \"Carl told me that her childhood friends have died. Other women have outlived their spouses by decades. Their children are often consumed with the responsibilities of their own families.\", \"But these teammates meet on the court several times a week. Players have officiated one another\\u2019s weddings and taken trips together.\", \"Carl nodded toward a younger woman lacing up her sneakers. This year, she drove Carl to her Covid-19 vaccine appointments.\", \"\\u201cThey are the sisterhood,\\u201d Carl told me.\", \"Currently, the league\\u2019s oldest member is 95, but she was recovering from surgery when I visited. Other players were sidelined with injuries or medical conditions that have worsened over the years. The physical toll of aging is rendered in stark relief on the court.\", \"Marianne Hall, 86, coached women\\u2019s high school basketball when Title IX was being rolled out. But she hadn\\u2019t played on a team herself until the 1990s, when her friend told her about San Diego\\u2019s newly created league.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t jump anymore,\\u201d Hall recalled saying.\", \"\\u201cNone of us jump,\\u201d the woman replied.\", \"When games ceased last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, Hall wondered whether she was too old to return. She worries about falling. Though the league now has a vaccine requirement, many players have not come back since practice started up again in June.\", \"But Hall, who recently became a great-grandmother, wore her headband and jersey on that Sunday morning. She was ready to play.\", \"At noon, women scurried onto the court for the next game, between Hall\\u2019s and Carl\\u2019s teams.\", \"Players, many in masks, passed the ball quickly among one another. Some tried to intercept and block shots.\", \"Within minutes, Carl grabbed hold of the ball. She lifted her arms and heaved it toward the basket.\", \"Swoosh.\", \"Late Tuesday night, NASA launched a new mission: crash into asteroid, defend planet Earth.\", \"Pumpkin maple cornbread, an extremely versatile side dish.\", \"Today\\u2019s travel tip \\u2014 or tips, rather \\u2014 comes from Gretchen Henry:\", \"Tell us about your favorite places to visit in California.

The game will be held in Minneapolis on Dec. 5.\", \"\\u201cThat\\u2019s the most exciting part about it,\\u201d Davis said. \\u201cTo meet and play with new people and to make new brothers and bonds that I won\\u2019t ever forget.\\u201d\", \"Thanks for reading.
