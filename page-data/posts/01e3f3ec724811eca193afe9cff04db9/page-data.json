Representative David E. Price, a Democrat who currently represents much of that area, announced his retirement in October.\", \"\\u201cI intend to use my voice to deliver real results for North Carolina families, just like David Price has done for decades,\\u201d Mr. Aiken, a native of Raleigh, wrote. \\u201cI\\u2019ll always stand up for my principles and fight for inclusion, income equality, free access to quality health care, and combating climate change.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Aiken, who placed second behind Ruben Studdard in the second season of \\u201cAmerican Idol\\u201d in 2003, previously ran for Congress in a Republican-leaning part of the state in 2014. He won the Democratic primary but was defeated in the general election by the Republican incumbent.\", \"Last month, the North Carolina Supreme Court ordered that the state\\u2019s 2022 primary election, originally scheduled for March 8, be postponed until May 17, citing a \\u201cneed for urgency\\u201d in giving critics of the state legislature\\u2019s gerrymandered political maps additional time to pursue a legal battle to redraw them. New boundaries for state legislative districts and North Carolina\\u2019s 14 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives face three lawsuits filed by Democrats and voting-rights advocates in state court in Raleigh.\", \"Mr. Aiken is joining a crowded Democratic primary field that includes two state senators and a Durham County commissioner, The News & Observer reported.\", \"Mr. Aiken said his first experience with politics came when he was in the eighth grade and asked Mr. Price to speak to his class. Mr. Price agreed.\", \"\\u201cIn Congress, I\\u2019ll use my voice to advocate for common-sense policies that encourage continued job growth and healthy communities,\\u201d Mr. Aiken wrote. \\u201cMany of these political battles divide us as people, threaten our democracy, and weaken America. North Carolinians are worried about affordable health care and rapid inflation.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Aiken studied at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte and taught special education in Wake County. He is a co-founder of the National Inclusion Project, which advocates for disabled children, and he worked with UNICEF as a national goodwill ambassador, according to his website.\"]","href_hash":"01e3f3ec724811eca193afe9cff04db9"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"01e3f3ec724811eca193afe9cff04db9"}},
