infections comes amid concern for more than 700 people who attended the Sircuit and Peel Hotel nightclubs in Melbourne's inner north at the weekend with a person who later tested positive to the Omicron variant.\", \"\\\"Public health authorities are investigating seven confirmed COVID-19 cases that may be linked to the Peel Hotel and Sircuit Bar sites,\\\" the health department said on Thursday afternoon.\", \"\\\"Work is underway to determine if any of these cases have the Omicron variant.\\\"\", \"There have now been 13 confirmed cases of Omicron in Victoria, including a further three international arrivals confirmed on Thursday afternoon.\", \"The three had all been in quarantine since arriving in the country.\", \"Genomic sequencing is underway for about 30 other people
