Because of the stories I heard is that, when somebody came to visit her, she would take them and show them her bathroom.\\\"\", \"Sadly, Steven passed away last year, and Tom made the difficult decision to sell the historic home. \\\"Steven loved decorating and bringing things back to that mid-century look, and this house was the perfect style for that. I can tell you they were four layers of wallpaper everywhere, so it took almost 3 years to restore the house back to life again the way it used to be.\\\"\", \"For Tom and Steven, the restoration was a labor of love.\", \"\\\"Some of the other things, you know, the other owners had carpeted. I took the carpeting out, you know, the hardwood floors are still original.

But as I came up the sidewalk, I was reminded of the day my furniture got here. I think I was three, 1962. And it was in the spring, and we had picked out furniture for most of the house and my bedroom was coming. And so, I ran up the sidewalk and fell and skinned my knee, of course. Well, my mother and my grandmother were here. And what did you do? You cleaned it off and you put Mercurochrome on it. Now, Mercurochrome didn't burn like MethylAid. but it did make your knee orange. So, I had this little orange spot on my knee, and then they set up my pretty French provincial bedroom with the canopy and the little desk-type of vanity with the chair and the white cushiony seat. And of course, I went in there and climbed up on it with my orange knee and left a mark on it the first day.\\\"\", \"The house recently sold for over a half-million dollars. \", \"For Courtois, the idea of leaving this historic home has not been easy. \\\"I enjoy living in the house. It's a testament to the longevity of Patsy Cline that it's still here, and she's just as popular as other [stars] with such a short career. It's hard. After 10 years, you put your heart and soul into it.
