In 2011, he recruited and trained a team of ordinary citizens to compete in a forecasting tournament sponsored by the U.S. intelligence community. Participants were asked to place numerical probabilities from 0 to 100 percent on questions like \\u201cWill North Korea launch a new multistage missile in the next year\\u201d and \\u201cIs Greece going to leave the eurozone in the next six months?\\u201d Tetlock\\u2019s group of amateur forecasters would go head-to-head against teams of academics as well as career intelligence analysts, including those from the C.I.A., who had access to classified information that Tetlock\\u2019s team didn\\u2019t have.\", \"[You can listen to this episode of \\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\\u201d on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.]\", \"The results were shocking, even to Tetlock. His team won the competition by such a large margin that the government agency funding the competition decided to kick everyone else out, and just study Tetlock\\u2019s forecasters \\u2014 the best of whom were dubbed \\u201csuperforecasters\\u201d \\u2014 to see what intelligence experts might learn from them.\", \"So this conversation is about why some people, like Tetlock\\u2019s \\u201csuperforecasters,\\u201d are so much better at predicting the future than everyone else \\u2014 and about the intellectual virtues, habits of mind, and ways of thinking that the rest of us can learn to become better forecasters ourselves. It also explores Tetlock\\u2019s famous finding that the average expert is roughly as accurate as \\u201ca dart-throwing chimpanzee\\u201d at predicting future events, the inverse correlation between a person\\u2019s fame and their ability to make accurate predictions, how superforecasters approach real-life questions like whether robots will replace white-collar workers, why government bureaucracies are often resistant to adopt the tools of superforecasting and more.\", \"You can listen to the whole conversation by following \\u201cThe Ezra Klein Show\\u201d on Apple, Spotify, Google or wherever you get your podcasts.
