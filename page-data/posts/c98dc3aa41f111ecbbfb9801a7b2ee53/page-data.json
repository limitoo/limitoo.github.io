Before the pandemic, he would frequently receive 50 or more applications per advert. \", \"He has also used agencies to find staff, but when he asked for a sous chef they could only provide an employee who had never worked in a catering kitchen before. Paying above minimum wage, Mr Lee employs waiters and cleaners on \\u00a310 per hour, which increases to \\u00a313 for a sous chef. \", \"KPMG and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation (REC) polled 400 recruitment companies in June and found \\\"substantial increases\\\" in permanent and temporary job vacancies across the Midlands, the South, London and the North. \", \"The steepest increase in demand was seen for permanent private sector staff, particularly in the IT and computing, hotel and catering, and engineering sectors.\", \"Demand was also \\\"historically strong\\\" across the public sector.\", \"However, the survey found the supply of candidates had fallen for the fourth month in a row. Recruiters blamed increased hiring, Brexit, pandemic-related uncertainty and the furlough scheme.  \", \"Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG, told the BBC's Today programme: \\\"We have seen the reopening of the economy and therefore there's a surge in demand, and not all the workers we were hoping to get are readily available. \", \"\\\"Some of them need to switch sector, some of them were looking after children before or were temporarily out of the jobs market.

The jobs market is improving at the fastest pace we have ever seen, but it is still an unpredictable time. \", \"\\\"We can't yet tell how much the ending of furlough and greater candidate confidence will help to meet this rising demand for staff. In some key shortage sectors like hospitality, food, driving and IT, more support is likely to be needed to avoid slowing the recovery.\\\" \"]","href_hash":"c98dc3aa41f111ecbbfb9801a7b2ee53"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c98dc3aa41f111ecbbfb9801a7b2ee53"}},
