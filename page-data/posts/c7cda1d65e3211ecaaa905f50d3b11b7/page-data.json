Officials have not announced any further restrictions, though the prime minister, Boris Johnson, urged the public to be judicious in socializing during the holidays.\", \"Chris Whitty, England\\u2019s chief medical officer, warned that further records would be broken in coming days, with cases of the Omicron variant doubling nearly every two days in parts of the country. While the effects on hospitalizations and deaths remain unclear, the country\\u2019s health services face a deluge of patients because of the growth in case numbers, he said.\", \"Johnson has redoubled his campaign for people to get vaccine boosters. The government hopes to deliver boosters to all adults by the end of the month, a target that would require administering more than one million shots a day. About 650,000 people received shots on Tuesday, another record.\", \"Quotable: \\u201cThis is a really serious threat,\\u201d Whitty said. \\u201cIt is moving at an absolutely phenomenal pace.\\u201d\", \"Here are the latest updates and maps of the pandemic.\", \"In other developments:\", \"Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, the leaders of China and Russia, met yesterday in a video summit in a show of solidarity between the two autocrats, both of whom face growing Western pressure.\", \"At the meeting, Xi proposed that Russia and China cooperate to \\u201cmore effectively safeguard the security interests of both parties.\\u201d He also secured a public pledge that Putin would attend this winter\\u2019s Beijing Olympics, which officials from countries including the U.S. intend to boycott. It was the 37th time the two men had met since 2013.\", \"There is still plenty of friction between Russia and China, who do not have a formal alliance, over matters like Siberian logging and history. But on trade, security and geopolitics, they are increasingly on the same page, forming a bloc trying to take on American influence as both countries\\u2019 confrontations with the U.S. deepen.\", \"U.S.-China relations: China is not living up to its end of a Trump-era trade deal. Now the White House must decide whether to enforce it.\", \"Ethiopia\\u2019s prime minister, Abiy Ahmed, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2019 for making peace with his country\\u2019s enemy, Eritrea, ending two decades of conflict between the countries.\", \"In the years since then, Ahmed has used his alliance with Isaias Afwerki, the authoritarian leader of Eritrea, to secretly plot a course for war against their mutual foes in the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, according to officials.\", \"Abiy insists that war was foisted upon him. But new evidence shows he was planning a military campaign for months before the first shot was fired. Analysts say that Abiy\\u2019s journey from peacemaker to battlefield commander is a cautionary tale of how the West, desperate to find a new hero in Africa, got this leader spectacularly wrong.\", \"Analysis: \\u201cThe West needs to make up for its mistakes in Ethiopia,\\u201d said Alex Rondos, formerly the E.U.\\u2019s top diplomat in the Horn of Africa. \\u201cIt misjudged Abiy. It empowered Isaias. Now the issue is whether a country of 110 million people can be prevented from unraveling.\\u201d\", \"When you look back on 2021, what images spring to mind?

The process occurs only once a year.\", \"In many cases, the herders have worked with Loro Piana, a luxury brand known for its plush knits, for generations. The product of their work will be touched by approximately 100 hands in at least three countries, from Mongolia to Italy to its final store, over a period of 18 months to two years.\", \"Soon, the garments that cashmere becomes will include tags that trace the cashmere\\u2019s journey from herd to bale to sweater. It may seem like a simple thing: a brand knowing exactly where and how its products are made.\", \"Yet the fashion supply chain is so complicated, its many moving parts spread out over so many countries and processes, that for most of us the origin stories of our clothes are almost entirely opaque. Here\\u2019s what Loro Piana\\u2019s supply chain looks like, beginning with Ha Si Ba Gen, a rancher in Mongolia.\", \"Our columnist Yewande Komolafe explores the role of plant-based cooking in West Africa and the diaspora \\u2014 like these delicious roasted mushrooms in ata din din.\", \"The new series \\u201cStation Eleven,\\u201d based on the novel by Emily St. John Mandel, is the most uplifting show about post-apocalyptic life that you are likely to see.\", \"Four ways toward a healthier tech life in 2022.\", \"Here\\u2019s today\\u2019s Mini Crossword, and a clue: Bird with light blue eggs (five letters).\", \"And here is the Spelling Bee.\", \"You can find all our puzzles here.\", \"That\\u2019s it for today\\u2019s briefing.
