So you need to keep your testing type, not just everybody.\\\"\", \"The Ministry of Health says it will provide an update on the RAT rollout to other parts of the country later this week.\"]","href_hash":"5392bd6e92a411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5392bd6e92a411ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
