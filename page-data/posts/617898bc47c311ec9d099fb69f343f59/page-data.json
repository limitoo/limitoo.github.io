As a result of the new law, some companies in China have stopped providing data that international shippers need in order to navigate supply chains, Reuters reported Wednesday.\", \"The law, known as China's Personal Information Protection Law, blocks foreign companies from accessing the data needed for shippers to gain an understanding of cargo volumes so that they may plan their routes in a manner that allows them to avoid congested ports and reduce the overall amount of time ships spend waiting for cargo.\", \"Under the new law, the Chinese government has a greater ability to regulate how domestic and foreign entities gather and distribute Chinese data. Reuters reported while the law does not specifically address shipping companies, Chinese companies are operating under its guidelines nonetheless.\", \"Representatives from MarineTraffic, which provides information on the movements of ships globally, told Reuters that has been impacted by the law. With much of the world's manufactured goods coming from China, Anastassis Touros, a leader at MarineTraffic who oversees the Automatic Identification System (AIS) that pinpoints the locations of ships, stressed the effects of this law could be wide-reaching.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1934677/northern-germany-hub-international-shipping.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Because of a new Chinese data law, foreign shipping companies entering Chinese waters find access to vital shipping to be limited.

As the demand for shipped goods continues to surge alongside global energy shortages, this issue may only grow in its severity.\", \"\\\"With China being a major importer of coal and iron ore and one of the main container exporters globally, this decline in positional data could cause significant challenges concerning ocean supply chain visibility,\\\" Charlotte Cook, VesselsValue's head trade analyst said.\"]","href_hash":"617898bc47c311ec9d099fb69f343f59"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"617898bc47c311ec9d099fb69f343f59"}},
