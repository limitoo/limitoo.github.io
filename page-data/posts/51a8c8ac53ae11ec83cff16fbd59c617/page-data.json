A theater veteran known for his work on the NBC drama \\u201cThis Is Us,\\u201d Jones is 64 and wiry, with short waves of black hair and an almond-shaped face. In the dream, he is delivering a monologue onstage \\u2014 darkened room, white backlights \\u2014 when he notices something amiss. Everyone in the audience is looking elsewhere, in seemingly every direction but his. Jones waves and shouts, trying to draw the crowd\\u2019s attention. But no matter how desperately he screams, no one registers his presence. He is there but not there, a ghost among the living.\", \"In the new Broadway play \\u201cClyde\\u2019s,\\u201d where Jones plays a kind of spiritual leader to a beleaguered crew of recently incarcerated sandwich cooks, he is the show\\u2019s transfixing center of gravity \\u2014 the very opposite of ghostly incorporeality. But when the nightmares began, Jones really was in mortal peril.\", \"In May of last year, he received a double-lung transplant after years of suffering in secret from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Jones spent nearly two months at the Ronald Reagan U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles on and off a ventilator, learning to breathe and then eat and then walk again. The hope of one day returning to the theater was the fire that fueled his recovery.\", \"\\u201cMy whole life has been the stage,\\u201d Jones said recently, over lunch at a restaurant a few blocks from the theater where \\u201cClyde\\u2019s\\u201d is running. \\u201cThe idea of not performing again seemed worse to me than death.\\u201d\", \"Jones is the kind of actor who works like chipotle mayo \\u2014 you don\\u2019t always think to look for him, but you\\u2019re happy when he shows up. About six years ago, after three decades of working on and off Broadway in New York, he began quietly lending credence to a crop of ambitious streaming-era dramas. He added a touch of warmth to Sam Esmail\\u2019s \\u201cMr. Robot,\\u201d a note of vulnerability to Marvel\\u2019s \\u201cLuke Cage,\\u201d a foreboding undercurrent to Stephen King\\u2019s \\u201cLisey\\u2019s Story.\\u201d But his biggest breakthrough \\u2014 and two Emmy Awards, for outstanding guest actor \\u2014 came from the ratings smash \\u201cThis Is Us,\\u201d where Jones has played William, the biological father of Sterling K. Brown\\u2019s character, Randall, since 2016.\", \"On a series with no shortage of weepy story lines, William is a figure of singular pathos. The character, who is Black, bisexual, a former drug addict, an absentee father and has terminal cancer, would in lesser hands strain the limits of good taste. But Jones\\u2019s soulful performance \\u2014 the weather-beaten brow, the voice like brushed wool \\u2014 confers a lived-in texture and depth.\", \"The same year that Jones was cast as William, he complained to his doctor about difficulty breathing. An X-ray confirmed advanced emphysema, a pulmonary condition in which damage to the lungs deprives the blood of oxygen. Jones, who had been a two-packs-a-day smoker for most of his life, was told the disease was progressive \\u2014 left untreated, his lungs would grow weaker and eventually collapse. He was advised to consider a transplant. But he shut down the idea after learning the risks involved. Even if his body accepted the new lungs, there was a 31 percent chance he would be permanently bound to an oxygen tank.\", \"\\u201cI was in total denial,\\u201d Jones said. \\u201cI told myself that it would pass, or that I was just getting older. I was afraid and didn\\u2019t want to change what I wasn\\u2019t ready to change.\\u201d\", \"For a year after his diagnosis, Jones continued smoking up to 12 cigarettes a day. He finally changed course in 2017, after an incident on the set of \\u201cThis Is Us.\\u201d While filming a long outdoor scene with Susan Kelechi Watson, who plays William\\u2019s daughter-in-law, Jones became increasingly short of breath. He sensed his heart pounding and broke into a sweat. He felt as if he were underwater. After someone called an ambulance, an emergency responder resuscitated him using an oxygen tank. Denial was no longer an option.\", \"\\u201cYou can see in his eyes that he made the right decision,\\u201d said the actress Jasmine Cephas Jones, Jones\\u2019s daughter and an original cast member of \\u201cHamilton.\\u201d \\u201cI feel like I have my dad back.\\u201d\", \"Many of Jones\\u2019s characters, including Montrellous, the ex-convict he portrays in \\u201cClyde\\u2019s,\\u201d are pacific, hard-luck men in pursuit of redemption. The playwright Lynn Nottage, who met Jones in the 2000s when both were members of the Labyrinth Theater Company, said she wrote Montrellous with Jones in mind.\", \"\\u201cHe moves through the world like a cool jazz man, but is also generous and a nurturer,\\u201d Nottage said. \\u201cThe same qualities that he brings to his acting are the qualities that he embodies in real life.\\u201d\", \"Jones was first drawn to performance as a young man during the Black Arts Movement in the 1970s. Born and raised in Paterson, N.J., he took Route 4 to Harlem on weekends to see jazz at St. Nick\\u2019s Pub, or plays at the National Black Theater or Avery Fisher Hall (now David Geffen Hall) at Lincoln Center. After graduating with a theater degree from Ramapo College, in 1978, Jones immersed himself in the art scene in New York but was derailed when he developed a crippling heroin addiction. Encouraged by his mother, he moved to Los Angeles for a fresh start and spent four years working as a bus driver.\", \"Eventually, Jones turned to gambling and relapsed. He said he was arrested with 10 small bags of heroin and narrowly escaped a five-year prison sentence. A judge sent him back East \\u2014 to a rehabilitation center in Albany, N.Y. \\u2014 but the program didn\\u2019t take. Jones relapsed a second and third time. His mother, who had taken him in after Albany, kicked him out of the house and stopped answering his phone calls.\", \"\\u201cIt was the tough love thing,\\u201d Jones said. \\u201cBut it felt like everything I had loved was gone.\\u201d\", \"Jones hit rock bottom and said that for a while he slept on a bench in Eastside Park in Paterson. He was saved by an uncle who invited him to stay at his apartment in Harlem. It was there, in 1986, that he got clean for the last time.\", \"In 1990, he starred in his first play, \\u201cDon\\u2019t Explain\\u201d by Samuel B. Harps, at the Nuyorican Poets Cafe on the Lower East Side. By then he was a father \\u2014 Jasmine was born in 1989 \\u2014 and went on to a wide-ranging stage career, starring in Stephen Adly Guirgis\\u2019s \\u201cJesus Hopped the \\u2018A\\u2019 Train,\\u201d John Patrick Shanley\\u2019s \\u201cStorefront Church\\u201d and \\u201cRichard III.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cClyde\\u2019s\\u201d is his first appearance on Broadway in seven years. After his lung transplant, Jones was determined to prove that he could still perform at the highest level, and for the standard eight shows per week. In his review of the play for The Times, Jesse Green wrote that Jones perfectly embodies his character, balancing a \\u201cZen imperturbability with subtle dashes of pain and sacrifice.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt was kind of miraculous to see him up there so full-bodied,\\u201d said Nottage, who, though aware of Jones\\u2019s operation, said it was never discussed during rehearsals this summer. \\u201cYou would never know that he had any kind of struggle.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cClyde\\u2019s\\u201d opens with a monologue, in which Montrellous attempts to persuade Clyde, played by Uzo Aduba, to change the menu at her restaurant. On opening night late last month, when the curtain lifted and revealed a packed crowd, including many of Jones\\u2019s friends and family, he said he was so overcome with emotion that he nearly screamed his first line.\", \"\\u201cI was so eager that all of the air from my diaphragm just came rushing out at once,\\u201d he said. \\u201cI wanted to make sure that I could be heard.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"51a8c8ac53ae11ec83cff16fbd59c617"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"51a8c8ac53ae11ec83cff16fbd59c617"}},
