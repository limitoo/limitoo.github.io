That price last week shattered the previous high of $4.10 in 2008.\", \"Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, expects gas prices to continue receding. The surge in costs has yet to put off motorists, however.

In the fall, President Biden ordered the release of 50 million barrels of oil from the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve. A growing number of states are also considering whether to temporarily waive local gas taxes.\\u00a0\", \"Although gas prices have soared, the previous record in 2008 remains higher when inflation is factored in \\u2014at about $5.24 in today's dollars.\", \"\\u2014The Associated Press contributed to this report.\", \"Alain Sherter covers business and economic affairs for CBSNews.com.\"]","href_hash":"0eeb4b0ca6f111ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0eeb4b0ca6f111ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
