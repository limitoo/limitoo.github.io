In Germany, a spike in cases and hospitalizations has led the health minister, Jens Spahn, to warn of \\u201ca pandemic mainly among the unvaccinated and it is massive.\\u201d Unvaccinated patients are overwhelming beds in intensive care units and have prompted calls to keep them out of certain public indoor spaces.\", \"On a recent morning in Trieste\\u2019s main Unit\\u00e0 d\\u2019Italia Square, a central theater of many of its demonstrations, Dario Giacomini, a leader of the protests and a radiologist who has been suspended by his hospital for refusing to get vaccinated, sat outside the Caff\\u00e8 degli Specchi. Without a Green Pass, as the health pass is known, he was not allowed to sit inside.\", \"As protesters in the square struck yoga poses or held up signs reading, \\u201cTrieste calls, Italy answers,\\u201d he complained that the health pass sidelined the unvaccinated from the country\\u2019s work force and rendered vaccine skeptics \\u201csocially dead.\\u201d The anti-Health Pass movement would spread everywhere, Mr. Giacomini insisted, but \\u201cTrieste was the spark.\\u201d\", \"Yet while protests elsewhere in Italy have since died down as Italians have accepted the Green Pass, in Trieste officials eager to counter the city\\u2019s new reputation as the center of vaccine skepticism have had to ban further protests in the square and threaten penalties against those who disobey.\", \"Some locals have had enough. Last Sunday, Mitja Gialuz, a university law professor and leading figure in Trieste, began a petition to all the residents to state that they believe in science and the vaccine. It now has nearly 50,000 signatures.\", \"\\u201cEnough now,\\u201d said Antonio Paoletti, president of the Trieste business association ConfCommercio. \\u201cWe cannot allow a minority of a minority to block business activities and people\\u2019s livelihoods for weeks.\\u201d\", \"Many Italians have started asking what on earth is going on up in Trieste, which has often seemed a place apart.\", \"Following its central role in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Trieste served as a pivot point between empires and a crossroads of Italy, Central Europe and the Balkans.\", \"At the turn of the 20th century, it was a hotbed of the Italian movement to reclaim \\u201cunredeemed\\u201d lands on the peninsula and across the Adriatic.

Viva Free Trieste!\\u201d Guglielmo Oberdan, yelled from the gallows after failing to assassinate the Austro-Hungarian emperor in 1882.)\", \"After World War II the United States and Britain controlled Trieste, loath to let it fall into Communist Yugoslavia\\u2019s hands. They finally handed it over to Italy in 1954.

Doctors agreed.\", \"The number of new cases in Trieste last week doubled over the week before to more than 800, and the authorities were deeply concerned about Trieste\\u2019s \\u201cexponential\\u201d growth in cases.\", \"Throughout the region, positive cases have climbed while the number of swab tests have remained constant. Covid patients have taken up about 18 percent of the region\\u2019s intensive care beds, crossing a dangerous threshold.\", \"\\u201cThe biggest cluster,\\u201d said Dr. Barbone, the region\\u2019s epidemiologist, emerged in 93 people who crammed together without masks and shouted slogans at the rallies in Trieste. \\u201cAll of these people,\\u201d he added, \\u201care not vaccinated.\\u201d\", \"Italy\\u2019s measures, which went into effect Oct. 15, require proof of vaccination, a negative rapid swab test or recent Covid recovery to go to the workplace. The leader of the dock workers protesting the law was Stefano Puzzer, a local activist with political ambitions.\", \"Vaccinated himself, he argued that it was unfair to make unvaccinated people pay to work by forcing them to pay for their own swab tests. Many of his supporters pointed out that Italy\\u2019s Constitution began with the words \\u201cItaly is a democratic Republic founded on labor.\\u201d\", \"The government rejected that case, arguing that it would be too expensive to pay for millions of swab tests and that such a policy would undercut the government\\u2019s vaccination efforts. But the protests, at times broken up with water cannons, drew all sorts of anti-vaccine protesters, and a major demonstration planned at the end of October promised tens of thousands of protesters.\", \"On the eve of the rally, after speaking with the authorities, Mr. Puzzer disbanded it for fear of infiltration by violent elements. .\", \"\\u201cDon\\u2019t come to Trieste because it\\u2019s a trap, a big fat trap,\\u201d Mr. Puzzer appealed on social media, leading to new conspiracies by Mr. Giacomini and other vaccine skeptics about infiltration by government spies to incite violence and tarnish their movement\\u2019s image.\", \"Ciro Mauriello, 29, one of the unvaccinated protesters who had come from the Emilia-Romagna region with a friend from Rome for the protest before it was called off, believed the state intended to sabotage the rally. \\u201cLike Jan. 6 in the United States,\\u201d he said, asserting that Democrats had plotted the attack to make Trump supporters look bad. Behind him, other protesters played a game, trying to catch and shoot each other with a pretend vaccine.\", \"What many of them actually caught was Covid.\", \"\\u201cA few days ago, I was standing before the water cannons and I stayed out wet all day,\\u201d Fabio Tuiach, a dock worker and a former Trieste City Council member of the League party and neofascist Forza Nuova party, wrote on Facebook on Oct. 25 after he tested positive to Covid-19. \\u201cI believe that, with the temperatures in Trieste at the end of October, it is impossible not to get sick and, indeed, I tested positive via a rapid test.\\u201d\", \"Still, he insisted, \\u201cFor me, Covid only exists in the minds of those who have been hypnotized.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"8dccfb063d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8dccfb063d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}},
