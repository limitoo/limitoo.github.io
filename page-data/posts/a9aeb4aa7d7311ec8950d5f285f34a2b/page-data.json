He then punches the driver directly in the face before turning around and walking away.\\u00a0\", \"The dazed driver gets up and follows the passenger, before kicking him in the back in retaliation. The passenger stumbles, grabs onto a handrail and manages to keep his footing.\", \"Another passenger can be heard telling the shocked onlookers to call the police.\\u00a0\", \"While the culprit is yet to be found, the bus driver has been given a formal warning by NZ Bus, according to the NZ Herald.\\u00a0\", \"But Tramways Union boss Gary Froggatt told the outlet the company's reaction was unfair and \\\"heavy-handed\\\".\\u00a0\", \"\\\"I don't think he needs a warning. He just needs some retraining,\\\" Froggatt told NZ Herald. \\\"It's not acceptable for passengers to do that and it's not acceptable for bus drivers to get involved in altercations with passengers.\", \"\\\"There should be more training and making sure drivers understand what they can and can't do in situations like this.\\\"\", \"NZ Bus chief operating officer Jay Zmijewski\\u200b said the company doesn't comment on employment matters.\\u00a0\", \"\\\"NZ Bus takes the safety of our drivers, including the prevention of assaults very seriously.
