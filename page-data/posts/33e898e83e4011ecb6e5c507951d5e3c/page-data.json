If prosecutors prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants committed one or more of those crimes and also caused Mr. Arbery\\u2019s death in the process, the basis would be laid for a conviction for felony murder.\", \"Like malice murder, felony murder is punishable by death, or by life imprisonment with or without possibility of parole.\", \"One way Georgia law defines this crime is as an assault using a deadly weapon. This count charges the three men with attacking Mr. Arbery with a 12-gauge shotgun. It is punishable by imprisonment of one to 20 years.\", \"Another way Georgia law defines this crime is as an assault using \\u201cany object, device, or instrument which, when used offensively against a person, is likely to or actually does result in serious bodily injury.\\u201d This count charges the defendants with using two pickup trucks to assault Mr. Arbery. It is punishable by imprisonment of one to 20 years.\", \"This charge applies when a person without legal authority \\u201carrests, confines, or detains\\u201d another person \\u201cin violation of the personal liberty\\u201d of that person. Specifically, the defendants are charged with using their pickup trucks to chase, confine and detain Mr. Arbery \\u201cwithout legal authority.\\u201d\", \"False imprisonment is punishable by one to 10 years in prison.\", \"Georgia law defines criminal attempt as performing \\u201cany act which constitutes a substantial step\\u201d toward the intentional commission of a crime \\u2014 in this case, the false imprisonment charged in Count 8. A defendant can be convicted either of completing a particular crime or of attempting it, but not both.\", \"Because false imprisonment is a felony, attempting it is also a felony, punishable by half the attempted crime\\u2019s maximum sentence: in this case, one to five years in prison.\"]","href_hash":"33e898e83e4011ecb6e5c507951d5e3c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"33e898e83e4011ecb6e5c507951d5e3c"}},
