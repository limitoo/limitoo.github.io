The Sunday after Thanksgiving pre-pandemic was the busiest in the agency's history. On that day alone, it screened nearly 2.9 million travelers. Should this year's numbers come even close to that total, some of the nation's busiest airports will be ready.\", \"Nonetheless, to make the travel experience run smoothly, TSA Administrator David Pekoske offered a few suggestions.\", \"\\\"I recommend that travelers pay attention to the guidance that the TSA officers are providing at the checkpoint,\\\" he said in a statement. \\\"They may be directing you to a shorter line or guiding you around someone who is moving slowly. And they may be giving you some advice that will lessen the likelihood that you'll need a pat-down.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"658c69904d6f11ec8b514176fedd88ce"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"658c69904d6f11ec8b514176fedd88ce"}},
