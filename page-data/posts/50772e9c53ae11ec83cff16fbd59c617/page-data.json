Each month, we\\u2019ll choose three nonfiction films \\u2014 classics, overlooked recent docs and more \\u2014 that will reward your time.\", \"From his debut film, \\u201cTiticut Follies,\\u201d shot at the state prison for the criminally insane in Bridgewater, Mass., to last year\\u2019s \\u201cCity Hall,\\u201d filmed in Boston, the great documentarian Frederick Wiseman has created a body of work \\u2014 \\u201cthe films,\\u201d he always calls them \\u2014 that doubles as a library of institutions, primarily but not exclusively American. It\\u2019s striking to consider how consistent his unobtrusive style has remained through more than five decades, and how much of it was in place early in his career. His fourth feature, \\u201cHospital,\\u201d filmed in 1969 at Metropolitan Hospital in New York, had a degree of access that privacy rules would likely make difficult today.\", \"It is also the best Wiseman in miniature, because hospitals touch on so many of the subjects he would return to: the treatment of juveniles. The welfare system. Poverty. Abuse. Wiseman wasn\\u2019t even done with medicine: Two decades later in \\u201cNear Death,\\u201d his longest film and a plausible candidate for his greatest, Wiseman spent time in an intensive care unit at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston, watching patients at the ends of their lives and doctors arguing over difficult calls.\", \"If \\u201cNear Death\\u201d showcases humanity at its most fragile, \\u201cHospital\\u201d finds mainly compassionate doctors dealing, by proxy, with the tumult and chaos of the city itself. A patient has arrived after a transfer that a doctor says put her life in jeopardy. A man shows up with a bloody neck wound that turns out to be all right, but came close to hitting a major blood vessel. In a scene striking for the period, a psychiatrist supports a patient in accepting his homosexuality, not trying to change it. A daughter tells her mother, who\\u2019s in critical condition, not to worry, a few minutes after Wiseman has shown a priest with unkempt hair hovering nearby.\", \"But in case \\u201cHospital\\u201d sounds hopelessly grim, it also contains one of Wiseman\\u2019s funniest sequences. A hippie who has taken what he fears was bad mescaline tells anyone who will listen (including an unflappable physician) that he doesn\\u2019t want to die. After some ipecac and a round of vomiting that would be right at home in a Mel Brooks comedy, he\\u2019s fine.\", \"Streaming for free off the artist\\u2019s website.\", \"What is the task? It\\u2019s never quite clear in the conceptual artist Leigh Ledare\\u2019s riveting hybrid of documentary and psychology experiment, filmed over three days at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago in May 2017. Set entirely in one room, the movie observes something known as a \\u201cgroup relations conference,\\u201d a gathering that brings strangers together to explore the dynamics that form. (To the uninitiated, it looks more like group therapy than a business meeting.) The participants come from a range of ages, races and socioeconomic backgrounds. Interspersed among them are a handful of \\u201cconsultants\\u201d \\u2014 psychologists indistinguishable from the regular group members by sight, although their role in steering and potentially dominating the discussion will be examined and re-examined before the film\\u2019s end.\", \"Exactly what the discussion is supposed to be about is up for debate: The closest the \\u201ctask\\u201d gets to a definition is that the subjects are supposed to examine their behavior in the \\u201chere and now.\\u201d (Occasionally, even the participants profess to be confused about what they\\u2019re talking about; part of the fun is to watch reactions and facial language, and when people interrupt.) The conversations turn on ideas about vulnerability, victimhood, stereotyping and even whether people are playing power games by where they choose to sit. The presence of the cameras \\u2014 and Ledare himself \\u2014 complicates matters. The participants debate whether they would behave the same way if they weren\\u2019t conscious of being recorded. At times the chatter gets heated. When a man reveals himself as a Trump voter, a woman shuts him down and requests that politics stay off the table.\", \"\\u201cIf this is as good as it gets, then how did we get to where we are as a species?\\u201d a man asks at one point, getting laughs. But the subject of \\u201cThe Task\\u201d is deadly serious. It seems to capture nothing less than the process of people learning to trust one another \\u2014 and not quite succeeding.\", \"Anyone concerned that social media is becoming a substitute for real life will find no solace in Liza Mandelup\\u2019s surreal and often funny documentary, which takes viewers inside the world of live-broadcasting influencers. (Those are different from Instagram influencers. Keep up!) With dreams of fame, Austyn Tester, a Bieber-coiffed teenager in Eastern Tennessee, holds regular video-chats in which he lip-syncs to songs and offers compliments to his fan base of adolescent girls, who seem elated at even the slightest hint of attention. Occasionally, these interactions happen in person, as when Austyn announces that he\\u2019ll host a meet-and-greet at a food court on a Thursday afternoon. One girl tells him she drove two hours for the occasion. He is a salve for his followers\\u2019 insecurities: an all-purpose friend, boyfriend, parent and mental-health counselor whom they don\\u2019t even need the luxury of knowing in real life. Nor, at 16, does he apparently need much life experience to substitute for those things.\", \"For his part, Austyn appears sincere about his desire to brighten people\\u2019s days \\u2014 an earnestness that Mandelup juxtaposes against the grim environment around him, including a home overrun with cats. Austyn\\u2019s mother says his father had substance-abuse issues and beat them, but Austyn believes he\\u2019s good at faking happiness until he makes it. (When it looks like he won\\u2019t, his problems begin.)\", \"To show the milieu that Austyn hopes to join, Mandelup tags along in Los Angeles with Michael Weist, a manager for teenagers in Austyn\\u2019s line of work. He describes mentoring new influencers as a sort of time-bound gold rush. (This particular brand of celebrity tends to be evanescent.) He also barely looks older than his clients. But Michael doesn\\u2019t think Austyn\\u2019s \\u201clike\\u201d numbers are where they ought to be. \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t touch him,\\u201d he says.\"]","href_hash":"50772e9c53ae11ec83cff16fbd59c617"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"50772e9c53ae11ec83cff16fbd59c617"}},
