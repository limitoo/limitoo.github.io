The intersectional and circumstantial odds were stacked against us,\\u201d said Mx. Reynolds, who is nonbinary and uses gender-neutral courtesy titles and pronouns.\", \"Ms. Wilson was facing an internal battle that \\u201cwouldn\\u2019t let me be with Kelsey without feeling like I was going to hell,\\u201d she said, adding that she also struggled to overcome feelings of cultural betrayal \\u201cby being with someone from a culture that has oppressed mine for hundreds of years.\\u201d\", \"Mx. Reynolds, who attended private religious schools until college, said \\u201cthere was a lot of indoctrination that I had to work through.\\u201d They added, \\u201cWe were in a really rough spot with our relationship toward the end of 2019 and were even questioning if we wanted to get married.\\u201d\", \"Mx.

(Both are Louisiana natives; Mx. Reynolds, 30, is from Baton Rouge and Ms. Wilson, 30, is from Gonzales.) Mx. Reynolds sat diagonally in front of Ms. Wilson, who took notice of Mx. Reynolds\\u2019s spirited disposition and budding relationship with one of her friends.\", \"\\u201cIt was the perfect spot for me to watch Kelsey with intrigue. They were completely unaware that I existed,\\u201d Ms. Wilson said. \\u201cI was so annoyed by Kelsey\\u2019s boisterous personality in the classroom and the fact that they were \\u2018stealing\\u2019 my best friend, Holly Edmondson.\\u201d\", \"Over time, Ms. Wilson said her annoyance evolved into an appreciation for Mx. Reynolds\\u2019s \\u201cbig personality, humor and kindness.\\u201d But months would pass before they actually \\u201chad a proper conversation,\\u201d she added.

She arrived to find \\u201cDear True Love\\u201d by Sleeping at Last, one of the couple\\u2019s favorite songs, playing, along with a roving photographer and some friends who were in on the plan.\", \"On the ground was a path of rose petals that turned into a heart, at the center of which stood Mx.

Reynolds expected.\", \"Instead, she said, \\u201cI will if you say yes, too.\\u201d Confused, Mx. Reynolds watched as Ms. Wilson rummaged through her bag, where an engagement ring for Mx.

They came up with Lovelle. \\u201cOur heart\\u2019s desire was something unique, nearly unheard-of, with deep meaning, and something that meant or translated to \\u2018love,\\u2019\\u201d Mx. Reynolds said. \\u201cThe heart of the name is love.\\u201d\", \"At the reception, a four-layer wedding cake with four different flavors and fillings was served. The couple also had a cake pull. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a Southern tradition. You attach ribbons to charms and each person pulls out a ribbon and the charm is your fortune or your omen. It\\u2019s a very Louisiana thing,\\u201d Ms. Wilson said. \", \"Ms. Wilson also presented a gift to Mx. Reynolds, who is Irish and Scottish, that celebrated their family history: A souvenir plot of land in the Slievekirk Wood reserve in Ardmore, Ireland, which came with an honorary title. \\u201cWhen you own the land, you become a lord or lady. We are now Lord and Lady of Ardmore,\\u201d Ms. Wilson said.\", \"Their second-to-last dance was a New Orleans style Second Line that brought all of the guests to their feet. \\u201cEven the waitstaff was dancing,\\u201d Ms. Wilson said.

Mx. Reynolds jitterbugged with their mother to \\u201cMom\\u201d by Meghan Trainor \\u201cbecause she taught me how to jitterbug,\\u201d they said.
