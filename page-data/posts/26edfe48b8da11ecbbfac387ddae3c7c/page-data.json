Now on display in New York City: a new exhibit devoted to the legendary Woody Guthrie.\", \"He sang a song of America \\u2026 of its destitute and its dispossessed, of its hungry and poor and rootless. He sang of miners and sharecroppers and factory workers; of fathers who couldn't feed their children; of farmers whose soil had turned to dust. \", \"He sang, in short, about us, in all our perseverance and possibility, said \\\"Sunday Morning\\\" host Jane Pauley. \", \"I ain't got no home, I'm just a-roamin' 'round, Just a wandrin' worker, I go from town to town.

It bothered him that the song was so unapologetically patriotic and uncritical of the problems he saw in the country firsthand as he was traveling around.\\\"\", \"But not all his songs were so serious, such as \\\"Car Song.\\\" \\\"He has a funny, funny and creative side as well, and a lot of that comes through in his writing for children.\\\"\", \"\\\"A lot of these songs are very funny and playful and are full of puns. And so, that's a side of Guthrie, I think, that people are not as well aware of,\\\" said Palmer.\", \"Guthrie's heyday was relatively brief.
