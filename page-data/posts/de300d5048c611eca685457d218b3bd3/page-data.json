You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and Thursdays.\", \"Ten months into his presidency, Joe Biden has yet to deliver on some of the biggest agenda items that defined his campaign, like a national paid family leave program or a clean electricity standard to combat climate change. But the bipartisan infrastructure bill he signed into law this week is still significant: At $1.2 trillion, it\\u2019s the largest investment in roads and bridges and power lines in more than a generation.\", \"That investment, engineers and economists say, is sorely needed: Compared with many of its peer nations, the United States has patchier, pricier internet service, slower passenger trains, a less future-proof electric grid, and higher exposure to unsafe drinking water.\", \"The question, though, is whether the legislation will be enough to deliver on the lofty promise, as Biden said it would during the signing ceremony, to \\u201crebuild the backbone of this nation.\\u201d Here\\u2019s what people are saying.\", \"Of the $1.2 trillion allocated by the legislation, about $550 billion is new spending that will be spread out over five years; the remaining funds are devoted to existing transportation programs that otherwise would have expired. After adjusting for inflation, the new spending is roughly equivalent to the cost of the Interstate Highway System constructed under the Eisenhower administration.\", \"Here are some of the biggest investments:\", \"Why has \\u201cInfrastructure Week\\u201d been such a long time coming? The answer goes back to 1970, when, according to the Yale economist Ray Fair, the federal government began to steadily reduce how much it spent on infrastructure as a percentage of G.D.P. \\u2014 a trend he observed in no other country. \\u201cThe overall results,\\u201d he wrote in a 2019 paper, \\u201cthus suggest that the United States became less future-oriented, less concerned with future generations.\\u201d\", \"Americans are now living with the consequences of that disinvestment. \\u201cThe relatively decrepit state of American infrastructure acts like a tax on our economy and a drag on our well-being,\\u201d my colleague David Leonhardt wrote recently. \\u201cIt slows the movement of people and goods and reduces the quality of everyday life.\\u201d\", \"One problem the bill could go a long way toward fixing is what\\u2019s known as the digital divide. \\u201cThe past year has been one long reminder that, for all of the nation\\u2019s economic strengths, we are woefully unprepared for our digital future,\\u201d Adie Tomer of the Brookings Institution wrote in August. \\u201cThere are still about 17 million households who don\\u2019t have broadband of any kind, and the patterns of geographic disconnect follow the same stubborn neighborhood divides by income, education and race.\\u201d\", \"Fortunately, Tomer told The Times, the $65 billion in new broadband spending would suffice to expand access to 50 percent to 75 percent of those Americans who lack high-speed internet.\", \"The legislation also includes the first major U.S. investment to defray the costs of climate change, as The Times\\u2019s Coral Davenport and Christopher Flavelle write. The $47 billion allocation falls short of what many experts call for, but still, \\u201cthis greatly exceeds anything we were able to get under the Obama administration,\\u201d said Alice Hill, who oversaw planning for climate risks on the National Security Council in that period. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve made enormous progress.\\u201d\", \"The law spends comparatively little on efforts to prevent, rather than merely adapt to, climate change. But The Wall Street Journal\\u2019s Jennifer Hiller writes that the legislation could still make a significant impact in that arena by funding a network of charging stations for electric vehicles \\u2014 a vital precondition for their mass adoption.\", \"\\u201cThese are big, big numbers relative to what\\u2019s happened in the United States,\\u201d Nick Nigro, founder of Atlas Public Policy, a Washington research firm that tracks the electric vehicle market, told her. \\u201cThis is transformational for electric vehicles.\\u201d\", \"Whether the law will have any electoral payoff for the Democrats in 2022 and 2024, as the White House hopes, is impossible to say. But \\u201cBiden is making good on a key campaign promise that will benefit people in all 50 states,\\u201d The Times\\u2019s Michelle Cottle writes. \\u201cUltimately, that is what Americans care about.\\u201d\", \"Many economists, policy analysts and engineers say that $550 billion in new spending, while significant, is still insufficient to meet the country\\u2019s infrastructure needs. How much would be?\", \"\\u201cSo, it\\u2019s about half what the gap is,\\u201d Maria Lehman, the organization\\u2019s president-elect, told Scientific American. \\u201cThe bill, as it stands right now, is more than we\\u2019ve ever invested, and in some categories of infrastructure, it\\u2019s as much as double. But it\\u2019s still overall not enough.\\u201d\", \"David Van Slyke, dean of the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University, agrees. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve got to be sober here about what our infrastructure gap is in terms of a level of investment and go into this eyes wide open, that this is not going to solve our infrastructure problems across the nation,\\u201d he told The Associated Press.\", \"Take, for example, Chicago: As The Times\\u2019s Astead Herndon reported last week, the White House\\u2019s commitment to replace every one of the nation\\u2019s lead pipes has been closely watched in that city, which has more such pipes than any other in the country. Industry experts have said that making good on that promise would cost $60 billion. The White House initially proposed $45 billion, and the legislation Biden signed allocates only $15 billion. An additional $10 billion would come from the reconciliation bill that\\u2019s still working its way through Congress.\", \"\\u201cThis is the first time we\\u2019ve had the administration actually step up and say, \\u2018We want to tackle this problem head on,\\u2019\\u201d said Jeremy Orr, an environmental lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council. \\u201cBut we need more than federal dollars. They need to prioritize communities that are hit the hardest, and we know where those communities are.\\u201d\", \"Even Vice President Kamala Harris has acknowledged the law\\u2019s shortcomings. \\u201cThis legislation \\u2014 as significant as it is, as historic as it is \\u2014 is Part 1 of 2,\\u201d Harris said. \\u201cThe work of building a more perfect union did not end with the railroad or the Interstate, and it will not end now.\\u201d\", \"But the fate of the reconciliation bill is uncertain at best. And ultimately, the success of the programs that made it into the bipartisan one may depend on how they\\u2019re carried out, and much of that has been left up to the states.\", \"\\u201cProjects for bridges, transit, ports, airports, electricity substations and more that funnel money to outside consultants run the risk of producing a few new millionaires but not many other benefits,\\u201d The American Prospect\\u2019s David Dayen writes. \\u201cBottom line: If the infrastructure money is effectively stolen, you won\\u2019t have a successful investment.\\u201d\", \"Do you have a point of view we missed?
