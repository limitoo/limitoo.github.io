I thought Rachin did a great job for us toiling into the wind from that end.\", \"\\\"The surface didn't necessarily spin a whole lot, but I guess that's the conversations [to have] in the future when we play here, is what does that look like?\", \"\\\"But as I said, the most important thing is we have 100 percent backing of whoever we select in the XI.\\\"\", \"Latham also denied any notion that the Blackcaps had taken Bangladesh lightly, as the visitors secured their maiden victory against New Zealand at home in any format of the game.\", \"The loss also ended New Zealand's unbeaten home record dating back to 2017, and has meant the end of a run of eight consecutive home test series wins, since they're now only able to salvage a draw come the second test in Christchurch later this week.\", \"\\\"We prepared exactly how we usually do for any test match - whether it's at home, whether it's away, no matter the opposition,\\\" Latham said.\", \"\\\"Our preparation we did exactly what we usually do, and I certainly don't think it was a lack of effort.\", \"\\\"We certainly weren't where we expect to be, and where we've been in the past.\\\"\", \"Join Newshub for live updates of the second test between the Blackcaps and Bangladesh from 11am on Sunday, January 9.\"]","href_hash":"e7cbacd66dd111ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e7cbacd66dd111ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
