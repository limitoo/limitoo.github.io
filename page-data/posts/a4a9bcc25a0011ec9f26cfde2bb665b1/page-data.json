The deaths are up 11 percent and infections and exposures are up 17 percent since June.\", \"The union of 1.3 million workers asked the companies to offer paid sick leave to workers just in case they get a vaccine or booster and experience a reaction to the shot. Hourly wages should also be increased to offset inflated food and grocery costs for workers, the letter said.\", \"\\\"Collectively, each of the safety and protection actions outlined above represent critical steps that you and your respective company must implement to save lives and livelihoods,\\\" the letter said.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949481/union-calls-covid-protections.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The nation\\u2019s largest food and retail union is urging more than 60 retail and grocery chains to implement stronger measures to help protect hourly workers amid a surge of virus infections and the new Omicron variant.

Workers at the unionized chain are required to wear masks, he said. He's worried about getting sick as the store has become packed during the holiday season.\", \"\\\"It's little disheartening when you show for work and me and my co-workers are wearing masks, but they're not,\\\" he said.\", \"The Associated Press contributed to this report.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1949483/grocery-retail-worker-protections.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">A food and retail union is calling on more than 60 store chains to reinstate protective measures against COVID-19 as cases are on the rise and the Omicron variant has started to pop up across the country.
