The good news is that consumers are putting up a fight against it.\", \"That\\u2019s clear in the chart below, which is based on data from the University of Michigan\\u2019s long-running Surveys of Consumers. Randomly chosen people are asked every month if they think it\\u2019s a good time to buy various things: cars, houses and large household goods \\u201csuch as furniture, a refrigerator, stove, television.\\u201d You can see the share of people who said it was a good time to make purchases dropped sharply when the pandemic-led recession hit, then rebounded, and has since fallen even more, along with the steep rise in inflation.\", \"That\\u2019s a sign that people are hurting from inflation, for sure, but it\\u2019s also evidence that they see today\\u2019s high prices as temporary. If they thought inflation was going to remain this high or even go higher they would probably want to buy now to beat the next price hike. The time to really worry about inflation is when people indicate they\\u2019re willing to buy goods even in the face of sharp price increases.\", \"I like the \\u201cgood time to buy\\u201d question because it\\u2019s not explicitly about the politicized term \\u201cinflation,\\u201d so it\\u2019s less influenced by what pundits and influencers are saying or what respondents think of the current occupant of the White House. It asks people a question they\\u2019re probably asking each other at the dinner table, so the answers tend to be considered and judicious.\", \"As it happens, the University of Michigan\\u2019s direct questions about inflation give similar results. Consumers have understandably gotten more worried about inflation in the short term. The median forecast for consumer price increases over the course of the next year was 4.6 percent in September. (And it\\u2019s probably even higher now after the latest headlines.) But the median September forecast for average annual inflation over the next five to 10 years was just 3 percent \\u2014 scarcely above the 2.7 percent that inflation has averaged since 2008.\", \"The reason for focusing on inflation expectations is that they matter. A lot of the factors pushing up inflation at the moment will eventually go away, including supply-chain bottlenecks, production restraints by the oil cartel, and the infusion of pandemic relief money into the economy. For example, let\\u2019s say used car prices stay at today\\u2019s super high levels \\u2014 you know how much that will contribute to inflation over the next year? Zero. To get inflation you need prices to continually rise, not just to be high.\", \"Expectations are one of the forces that can drive prices steadily higher. Inflationary psychology might become ingrained in consumers, the business community or both. That could happen if people lose faith in the Federal Reserve\\u2019s ability or commitment to restraining inflation.\", \"That\\u2019s not to say inflation is entirely in the mind. The labor market could remain dysfunctional, with lots of potential workers remaining on the sidelines despite an abundance of job openings. That would tend to push up wages and, with it, consumers\\u2019 ability to absorb price increases. Aneta Markowska, chief economist at the investment bank Jefferies, told me this week she wouldn\\u2019t be surprised to see the U.S. unemployment rate fall to 3 percent by the end of next year, from 4.6 percent last month. \\u201cI think we\\u2019re headed for what\\u2019s probably the tightest labor market since the \\u201950s,\\u201d she said. In 1953, when economic growth was strong and women were dropping out of the labor force to raise children, the unemployment rate got down to a record postwar low of 2.5 percent.\", \"The brighter scenario is that the low unemployment rate and higher wages finally coax people back to work. That would be a positive for those workers and their families, but also for the rest of us because it would tamp down wage inflation. Markowska, despite her below-consensus forecast for the jobless rate, sees inflation receding to a range of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. Kathleen Bostjancic, chief U.S. financial economist for Oxford Economics, is looking for the Consumer Price Index to rise just 2.3 percent from the current quarter to the fourth quarter of 2022.\", \"Worldwide, inflation will be pushed upward by a retreat from globalization but downward by the continuing progress of \\u201cdigitization,\\u201d Matthew Luzzetti, chief U.S. economist for Deutsche Bank, told me. He says inflation will end up higher than it has been recently, but not nearly as high as it got to in the 1960s and 1970s, when over-easy monetary policy allowed inflation to get out of control.\", \"It all comes back to expectations. \\u201cIn the \\u201960s inflation expectations were unanchored,\\u201d Luzzetti said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s probably more difficult for that to happen today.\\u201d\", \"I am a psychiatrist who works with severely mentally ill people. The most frustrating thing is to get people working and as soon as they make a steady wage they lose their Medicaid benefits, which pay for their treatment. Private insurance doesn\\u2019t pay for this kind of treatment. In one instance I had a fellow who improved enough to obtain gainful employment that came with health insurance. He was on a long-acting injectable medication which had kept him stable and able to work. The insurance company approved it \\u2026 at 50 percent! The co-pay was $2,500! It might as well have been a million. I have countless examples like this. A simple solution is a single-payer health insurance plan like every other modern country has.\", \"Paul Gitlin, M.D.\", \"Camden, Del.\", \"\\u201cIf someone is willing to pay for sex or a kidney, and a consulting adult is willing to sell, the only question the economist asks is: \\u2018How much?\\u2019\\u201d\", \"\\u2014 Michael J.
