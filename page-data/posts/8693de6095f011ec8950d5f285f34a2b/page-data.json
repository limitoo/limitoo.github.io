Indeed health advice provided to the government was that further mandates were not required to restrict the spread of Covid-19. I am not satisfied that continuity of these services is materially advanced by the order,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"The actual number of affected staff - 164 police staff and 115 NZDF staff is very small compared to the overall workforce of over 15,000 for each of the police and NZDF. Moreover there is no evidence that this number is any different from the number that would have remained unvaccinated and employed had the matter simply been dealt with by the pre-existing internal vaccine policies applied by police and NZDF. Neither is there any hard evidence that this number of personnel materially effects the continuity of NZDF and police services.\", \"\\\"Covid-19 clearly involves a threat to the continuity of police and NZDF services. That is because the Omicron variant in particular is so transmissible. But that threat exists for both vaccinated and unvaccinated staff. I am not satisfied that the order makes a material difference, including because of the expert evidence before the court on the effects of vaccination on Covid-19 including the Delta and Omicron variants.\", \"\\\"I should make it clear what this case is not about. The order being set aside in the present case was not implemented for the purposes of limiting the spread of Covid-19. Health advice was that such a further mandate was not needed for this purpose. Neither should the court's conclusion be understood to question the effectiveness and importance of vaccination. The evidence shows that vaccination significantly improves the prospects of avoiding serious illness and death, even with the Omicron variant. It confirms the importance of a booster dose given the waning effect of the first two doses of the vaccine.\", \"\\\"But the order made in the present case is nevertheless unlawful and is set aside.\\\"\", \"The applicants were awarded costs.\", \"The Attorney-General David Parker has declined to comment on the decision or whether the government will appeal.\", \"National Party leader Christopher Luxon said all police officers and defence personnel who lost their jobs over the Covid-19 vaccine mandates should be re-employed.\", \"He said the ruling also had implications for vaccine mandates more generally, saying the mandates did make sense in the Omicron-era and should be phased out after the peak of the outbreak.\"]","href_hash":"8693de6095f011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8693de6095f011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
