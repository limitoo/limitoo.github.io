This fever dream of a film packs love potions, evil stepmothers, benevolent devils, voodoo, sex, alternate realities and more into its 104 minutes. It is bizarre and dizzying and oddly beautiful in its fervor, as fantastical props and effects distract from the nonsensical plot. But this script also clumsily insists that its protagonist, a woman named Eva (Eug\\u00e9nie Derouand) who uses a wheelchair, is murderously obsessed with overcoming her disability.\", \"The greatest achievement of \\u201cThe Advent Calendar\\u201d (streaming on Shudder) is its titular prop, designed by Christine Polis, Benoit Polveche and Thierry Gillet. It\\u2019s a grand, medieval-looking thing decked out in secret compartments and paintings of saints. Eva receives it as a birthday gift from her friend, Sophie (Honorine Magnier), who snatched it up at a Munich market. The calendar immediately presents Eva with a set of rules: Eat all the candy in the calendar or you\\u2019ll die, follow all of the calendar\\u2019s instructions or you\\u2019ll die, don\\u2019t throw away the calendar or you\\u2019ll die.\", \"\\u201cSounds grim,\\u201d Eva remarks.\", \"\\u201cGermans are grim,\\u201d Sophie counters.\", \"As December unfolds, the calendar tantalizes Eva with wealth, love and perhaps even the chance to walk again \\u2014 but it also demands sacrifices.\", \"Eva is apparently willing to forgo all morality to regain the use of her legs, a dubious representation of disability at best (made all the more questionable by casting a non-disabled person in the role). \\u201cThe Advent Calendar\\u201d is certainly aware of ableism \\u2014 Eva withstands all manner of insulting comments from co-workers and strangers \\u2014 yet it hinges on a bloodthirsty desire to rid Eva of her disability. Although the script attempts to justify that desire for this particular character, as an act of representation, the film leaves a sour taste \\u2014 particularly given the already bleak landscape for disabled characters in the horror genre.\", \"The Advent CalendarNot rated. In French, with subtitles. Running time: 1 hour 44 minutes. Watch on Shudder.\"]","href_hash":"d1b09a13536c11ec8431677512b10b72"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d1b09a13536c11ec8431677512b10b72"}},
