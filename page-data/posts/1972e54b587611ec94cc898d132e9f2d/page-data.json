Those antibody levels were comparable to those against previous variants after two doses, the companies said.\", \"Samples from people who received only two doses found much lower antibody levels against Omicron, compared with an earlier version of the virus. These results come one day after a preliminary report on laboratory experiments in South Africa also found Omicron seemed to dull the power of two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\", \"The companies said the finding indicates that two doses alone \\u201cmay not be sufficient to protect against infection\\u201d by the new variant.\", \"An important caveat: These experiments offer an incomplete picture of how well the vaccine will protect against severe outcomes from Omicron.\", \"Dr. Paul Offit, a vaccine expert with Children\\u2019s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the Food and Drug Administration\\u2019s vaccine advisory committee, said he also wanted \\u201cto sound a note of reassurance.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe virus has mutated to the point that it has become less neutralizable by antibodies,\\u201d he said. But he said there is no evidence that the vaccines have become less effective at preventing severe disease.\", \"\\u201cIn all likelihood, two doses of an mRNA vaccine will protect you against serious illness,\\u201d he said.\", \"Still, the results seemed to underscore the importance of booster shots.\", \"Dr. Albert Bourla, the chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer, said the company began developing a version of its vaccine specifically targeting Omicron right after Thanksgiving and could produce it in mass quantities within 95 days. Moderna is on a similar path.\", \"But Dr. Bourla noted that Pfizer had developed two other prototypes in response to new variants and that neither had proved necessary because the original vaccine worked against the virus\\u2019s mutations.\", \"New research has found that the coronavirus infects both fat cells and some immune cells within fat, prompting a damaging defensive response.\", \"The study could help answer one of the questions that have puzzled doctors during the pandemic: Why overweight or obese people, particularly younger adults, have been more likely to develop severe Covid-19 and more likely to die.\", \"These patients often have health conditions like diabetes that heighten their risk, but scientists have become increasingly convinced that the heightened vulnerability has something to do with obesity.\", \"If the findings hold up \\u2014 the study has not yet been peer reviewed or published in a scientific journal \\u2014 they may shed light not just on why patients with excess pounds are vulnerable to the virus, but also on why certain younger adults with no other risks become so ill.\", \"It may be that body fat, which has limited immune defenses, is a place where the virus can replicate and continue to propel harmful inflammation.\", \"\\u201cIf you really are very obese, fat is the biggest single organ in your body,\\u201d said Dr. David Kass, a professor of cardiology at Johns Hopkins, adding that the fat \\u201cbecomes kind of a reservoir\\u201d for the virus.\", \"The study found that the virus causes a type of immune cell that is specific to fat to develop a robust inflammatory response, which results in a cascading inflammation reaction.\", \"The study\\u2019s authors suggested the new evidence could point to new treatments that target body fat. They also speculated that body fat might even contribute to long Covid.\", \"\\u201cWhatever happens in fat doesn\\u2019t stay in fat,\\u201d said Dr. Philipp Scherer, a scientist who studies fat cells at UT Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas, who was not involved in the research. \\u201cIt affects the neighboring tissues as well.\\u201d\", \"U.S. news\", \"International news\", \"And the rest \\u2026\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic.
