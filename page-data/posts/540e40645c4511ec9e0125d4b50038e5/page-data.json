The fine consists of a \\u20ac1 billion confiscation order and \\u20ac800 million in damages.\", \"UBS has denied wrongdoing, and it said it would appeal the latest ruling to France\\u2019s highest court. It made a failed attempt earlier this year to get the case overturned on constitutional grounds. In seeking a reduced penalty, UBS lawyers argued that while some of its Swiss bankers met with wealthy French clients, they did not unlawfully solicit them to evade taxes.\", \"The case blew open in 2019 following a seven-year investigation by French financial authorities. Several whistle-blowers at UBS France came forward with tales of how the banks\\u2019 employees in France and Switzerland engaged in illegal activity that essentially bilked the French tax authorities of more than 10 billion euros. UBS paid a $780 million fine in the United States in 2009 to resolve accusations that it had helped rich clients there dodge taxes.\", \"Prosecutors described how bankers from UBS France, motivated by the prospect of hefty bonuses, had alerted their counterparts in Switzerland to potential \\u201cbig potatoes\\u201d \\u2014 French citizens with assets of \\u20ac500,000 to \\u20ac10 million.\", \"To lure these people to open undeclared accounts outside of France, UBS employees traveled clandestinely from Switzerland to France, where they organized swank activities \\u2014 including shows at the Paris Opera, art exhibits and hunting outings \\u2014 where the bankers could mingle with prospects in hopes of slipping around French laws prohibiting foreign companies from soliciting clients on French territory, prosecutors said.\", \"To avoid detection, the bankers involved in the scheme followed a UBS \\u201csecurity governance manual\\u201d that included instructions for using encrypted computers, business cards without the bank\\u2019s logo and switching hotels frequently, prosecutors said. If caught, the instructions described how to stash documents and USB computer keys in hidden pockets sewn into coats and backpacks.\", \"The bank also created a parallel accounting system known as the milk books, after the small notebooks used as ledgers by Swiss cow farmers, prosecutors said. The books were used to keep tabs on and mask transfers of illicit money between Paris and Geneva, prosecutors said.\", \"Four UBS bankers were given suspended jail sentences of up to one year and fines of \\u20ac300,000 each.\", \"UBS has five days to appeal the ruling. The bank\\u2019s shares jumped nearly 3 percent Monday following the court\\u2019s announcement.\"]","href_hash":"540e40645c4511ec9e0125d4b50038e5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"540e40645c4511ec9e0125d4b50038e5"}},
