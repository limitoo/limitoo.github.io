His father had purchased the gun just four days earlier.\", \"The victims were Hana St. Juliana, 14; Madisyn Baldwin, 17; and Tate Myre, 16. Three students were in critical condition late Tuesday.\", \"Students said the school\\u2019s frequent active-shooter drills had helped.\", \"\\u201cThe school made sure that we knew where to go, who to call and how to act,\\u201d said Eva Grondin, a 15-year-old sophomore at Oxford, who attended active-shooter training several weeks ago. \\u201cIf we didn\\u2019t have this training I don\\u2019t know what would have happened.\\u201d\", \"School shootings are becoming more frequent, after a pandemic lull. There have been 28 this year, according to Education Week, which tracks such shootings.\", \"\\u201cYou never think it\\u2019s going to happen to you,\\u201d said Aiden Page, a senior. \\u201cAnd then it does. It\\u2019s just insane.\\u201d Follow along with our live updates here.\", \" Minneapolis has one of the most segregated school districts in the country, with one of the widest racial academic gaps. Now, officials have embarked on an unusual integration plan: asking some white families to help do the integrating by sending their children to schools that have been mostly attended by Black students. About 33 percent of the city\\u2019s public school students were assigned to new schools this year.\", \"My colleague Sarah Mervosh took an in-depth look at North High, a beloved, predominantly Black high school that was rezoned to include students from richer, whiter areas to the south. Her article details how hard the rezoning has been on just about everyone.\", \"As a follow-up to Sarah\\u2019s reporting, I talked with Ian Good, whose son, Charles, is one of 13 white freshmen at North High. Ian, a tech manager in south Minneapolis, shares custody of his two kids with his former wife. Our conversation has been lightly edited.\", \"What were you thinking about when you were making the decision?\", \"You say the word \\u201cdecision,\\u201d as if we had a decision to make. The decision, if there is a decision, is to try to go around what the schools are trying to do by enrolling your kids somewhere else, or accepting it.\", \"If you\\u2019re wealthy, you can drive them to school half an hour away and pick them up every day, and you\\u2019re afraid of the unknown. I\\u2019m less afraid of the unknown and less capable of driving my kids half an hour each way.\", \"One thing I was struck by in Sarah\\u2019s article is that a lot of parents opted out and chose to drive their kids to the suburban schools, which is allowed under state rules. Why did you not go that route?\", \"My kids\\u2019 mom approached me in the middle of the summer and said, \\u201cI\\u2019d like to enroll Charles in some suburban high school so that he can get the best education.\\u201d I talked him about it and he said, sort of, \\u201cI don\\u2019t care where I go.\\u201d\", \"So I thought, \\u201cWell, what\\u2019s going to happen? The school has a history of poor performance according to certain standards of academic testing. But that history is no longer relevant, because, now, it\\u2019s an entirely different school body that\\u2019s coming into the program.\\u201d\", \"But in fact, the whole of south Minneapolis took their kids and put them somewhere else instead.\", \"So the student body itself didn\\u2019t change, which I found out the first week in. I picked him up from school for the first time and I see all these kids coming out, and finally he comes out, and I say, \\u201cHey, are there any other white kids in your school?\\\"\", \"He says, \\u201cI\\u2019m the only white kid in a couple of my classes.\\u201d And I said, \\u201cOh, that\\u2019s interesting.\\u201d And then when I read the Times article, I found out there are only 13 white freshmen.\", \"What was attractive to you about North High? Or, I guess on the flip side, were you nervous?\", \"I was in the summer, but now, I\\u2019m very enthusiastic. His whole life changed. He comes home every day and he\\u2019s happy and he\\u2019s engaging and he tells me all about all of the things that are going on. He loves every single one of his teachers. He\\u2019s excelling. It\\u2019s a whole different human being coming through the door after school every day.\", \"I was terrified that it was just going to be another miserable year. And academics is just one component. The social and emotional learning component is just as important \\u2014 or more important \\u2014 than academics. I feel like you get a lot more of that when there are different people around you, who can teach you about different ways and thoughts. \", \"Why is it so transformative?\", \"I think people are the difference. It\\u2019s the staff.\", \"The family dinner is a thing that we do, and that\\u2019s when we catch up on the day. In years prior: \\u201cHow was your day?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cIt was fine.\\\" \", \"Now, both of my kids are competing for time to talk and tell me more about what\\u2019s going on. I\\u2019m just so happy with that.\", \"How are you talking about race?\", \"We don\\u2019t. It\\u2019s not something that we go out of our way to talk about. The only anecdote that I have is, just the other day, we were in a suburb, at a grocery store. We had gotten our Christmas tree, and my son said, \\u201cPlease don\\u2019t ever move here.\\u201d\", \"And I said, \\u201cWhy?\\\" And he said, \\u201cHow many people of color did you see in that grocery store?\\u201d I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know, I wasn\\u2019t counting.\\u201d\", \"He said, \\u201cWell, how many white people did you see?\\\"\", \"And I said, \\u201cI don\\u2019t know, I wasn\\u2019t counting.\\u201d\", \"And he said, \\u201cI\\u2019d rather live someplace with more diversity.\\u201d\", \"I think the dichotomy between his school, and where we live, in the city, and then going out to the suburbs was apparent to him.\", \"Some of the parents in the story were talking about safety concerns. How are you thinking about that?\", \"I got an automated alert from the school early in the school year that said: \\u201cWe\\u2019re closing the doors due to unsafety in the neighborhood.\\u201d That was a powerful voice mail to get. But my perspective is: You control the things you can control, and actual risk is lower than perceived risk. There isn\\u2019t any reason for me to believe my son is in danger.\", \"I don\\u2019t feel like he\\u2019s unsafe. Otherwise, obviously, I would do something about it. If, today, he was miserable in school and he was failing out and he wasn\\u2019t learning anything and he was in danger, I would be moving his school. But none of those things are true.\", \"Race and identity\", \"College\", \"And the rest \\u2026\", \"Sometimes, Danna Lorch\\u2019s son wakes her up in the wee hours, \\u201cbellowing for potato chips and cartoons.\\u201d As it can be for so many people, Danna writes, the daily grind of parenting \\u201ccan feel tedious, lonely and exhausting.\\u201d\", \"But Danna, like so many parents, struggled to have a child.\", \"She had several miscarriages before her son was born, and often finds herself asking: \\u201cHow can parents like me, who have struggled with infertility or pregnancy loss, reconcile gratitude for having a child at all with the everyday frustrations of parenthood?\\u201d\", \"I learned a lot from her essay, which you can read here. For Danna, it seems that grief and joy have come to coexist, wrapped together in her relationship to parenting.\", \"\\u201cIt is 100 percent normal to feel conflicted about parenthood even if you went through hell to become a parent,\\u201d one psychiatrist told her.\", \"That\\u2019s it for this week\\u2019s briefing.
