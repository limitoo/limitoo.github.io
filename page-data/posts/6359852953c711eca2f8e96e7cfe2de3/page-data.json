Besides suddenly stepping down as chief executive and chairman of Twitter, he made waves over at his other day job, leading the payments company he co-founded called Square, and changed its corporate name to Block. This is not just fun with shapes, the new name is meant to refer to the blockchain (do not make me explain what the blockchain is).\", \"\\u201cNot to get all meta on you \\u2026,\\u201d the company tweeted, making an allusion to another recent corporate name change. \\u201c\\u2018Block\\u2019 references the neighborhood blocks where we find our sellers, a blockchain, block parties full of music, obstacles to overcome, a section of code, building blocks, and of course, tungsten cubes.\\u201d\", \"Tungsten cubes? For those who are not in the know, these are dense metal blocks (get it??!?) that have become an obsession among the cryptorati (look, I just made up a word!). These folks like to hold the cubes and have been buying them like there\\u2019s no tomorrow. A two-inch tungsten cube weighs over five pounds, so it\\u2019s like a toddler toy for grown-ups. Cooool.\", \"Speaking of which, all these seemingly separate moves seem to indicate that Twitter could itself be on the block (ha) soon enough, as Scott Galloway posited on the weekly Twitter Spaces chat I co-host with Casey Newton of Platformer. I have been writing about buyout interest for a while, including in 2016 when Salesforce, Google and even Disney kicked Twitter\\u2019s tires.\", \"As I noted back then: \\u201cWhy not take a gander, given the huge trove of data that Twitter sits atop globally and its unique worldwide digital distribution system? While company execs have been unable to grow the business, many think a link with a larger entity would spur Twitter\\u2019s potential.\\u201d\", \"That you could write that very same sentence today says it all, since Twitter stock has been dead in the water for years. Shares sold for around $42 in November 2013, and today they are trading for around, you guessed it, $42. This is even as other tech companies\\u2019 valuations have soared during the pandemic. Twitter is a fine and famous asset that is woefully undervalued.\", \"As much as Twitter is in the news for combating or facilitating free speech or hate speech, depending on your political bent, it\\u2019s still just a business and not a magical reflection of our very souls that we must guard like a precious tungsten cube. So, the new chief, Parag Agrawal, who is well-liked internally and more influential than his obscurity indicates, needs to figure out a way to get Wall Street excited about Twitter. Or, someone should scoop it up and make it worth what it could be.\", \"Heck, that someone could even be Dorsey\\u2019s Block, which has a market valuation of $89 billion, more than double Twitter\\u2019s $34 billion. It would fit rather nicely with Block\\u2019s other units, in fact, bringing the full Jackaverse together.\", \"In the meantime, depicting Dorsey as a disappeared victim of the new chief executive might be good trolling, as Elon Musk did in a meme tweet, putting Agrawal\\u2019s face on Stalin\\u2019s body and Dorsey\\u2019s face on that of a longtime deputy of Stalin\\u2019s who was executed. But the analogy is not quite right \\u2014 Dorsey had plenty of power for a long time, but he simply was not delivering to shareholders. That said, no surprise that Musk would back Dorsey: Dorsey told me several years ago in an interview that Musk was his favorite tweeter.\", \"(If you want more analysis, read this fine piece by my colleague Greg Bensinger, a member of the Times editorial board, on what it will take for Agrawal to fix the company, including cleaning up bots and misinformation. And, here, The Times\\u2019 Kevin Roose looked at the restlessness of tech moguls like Dorsey. \", \"I connected with Charlie Warzel and Anne Helen Petersen about the future of work. Warzel is a former Opinion writer for The Times and now writes the Galaxy Brain newsletter for The Atlantic; Petersen is the author of several books and the Culture Study newsletter at Substack. Their forthcoming book is \\u201cOut of Office: The Big Problem and Bigger Promise of Working From Home.\\u201d I\\u2019ve edited their answers.The pandemic greatly shifted how we work and will work going forward. Do you think those changes are permanent or will most of us drift back into the office?\", \"Warzel: The biggest thing that\\u2019s changed is that for years bosses told employees the office was central to productivity and that all hell would break loose if too many people worked from home. That turned out to be mostly false, and now workers are wondering what other corporate maxims were B.S.\", \"Everyone is going to find their own balance when it comes to where people are working. There are advantages to episodic office work and it\\u2019s silly to pretend otherwise. But I also don\\u2019t think humans are meant to toil in one spot 40-plus hours a week and so there\\u2019ll be a lot of finding the right equilibrium.\", \"Petersen: The hybrid work ship has sailed. Or to use another metaphor from politics: When you give people an \\u201centitlement\\u201d (like, say, Social Security or Medicare), there is truly no way of rolling it back without a massive backlash. Hence, the real resistance to any organization that is pushing people back into the office full time (or even with mandatory full-time days). I\\u2019ve been particularly surprised to see industries that have been historically super resistant to change, like law firms, try to figure out a way forward that affords a modicum of flexibility.\", \"This is the future. Organizations that resist it are going to have massive issues with attrition and hiring. And if they don\\u2019t, they\\u2019re going to end up with a work force of white dudes who either don\\u2019t have care responsibilities or have figured out a way to offload them onto someone else.\", \"What are the pros of being out of the office? What are the cons?\", \"Petersen: Pros: Not having to expend the energy to make yourself \\u201cprofessional\\u201d in whatever capacity (generally a lot more work for women; also a lot of work and discomfort for nonbinary people when dress for their industry is often really gender-conforming). Commuting when it\\u2019s most convenient. The ability to segment your day to better accommodate child-care pickups and drop-offs, elder-care responsibilities, therapy appointments, just general life. Less office generally means less white-male-office-monoculture, so a lot fewer microaggressions. Just to start.\", \"Warzel: Cons: If your organization isn\\u2019t intentional about building real, codified remote policies, you\\u2019re basically being set up to fail. If remote work is lorded over people as some perk, instead of a new way to work, then they\\u2019ll be forced into situations where they are expected to work all the time to justify it. They\\u2019ll roll out of bed and instead of getting ready or having a commute, they\\u2019ll be plunged into the workday in bed and somehow still feel guilty. If onboarding and mentorship isn\\u2019t figured out, younger employees starting out will get left behind, they\\u2019ll miss a lot of that secret knowledge that gets passed down via office gossip.\", \"What technologies or work methods need to be invented to make remote work actually work better? The metaverse? Better screens? Compulsory in-person meetings?\", \"Warzel: A big lesson we learned reporting our book is that technology is not going to fix bigger structural and ultimately human problems in company cultures. If your manager sucks, I could give you DARPA levels of technology and a 12-hour remote workweek and you\\u2019d still be miserable.\", \"But I do think there are ways to use tech to help people. The open-source developer company Gitlab is a fully remote company and uses Wikis and huge, searchable database tools to make every meeting note and every company document public so that anyone in the company can see them. These are basically instruction manuals for each employee with information like: \\u201cThis is when I\\u2019m most productive\\u201d; \\u201cThis is when I\\u2019m usually busy or cranky\\u201d; \\u201cThis is how I like to brainstorm.\\u201d It\\u2019s a great way to learn how to work with people when you\\u2019re not in the same room.\", \"Petersen: I actually think the solution is more phone calls, instead of the current default to Zooms. But maybe that\\u2019s just because I grew up in the \\u201990s?\", \"Google employees just signed a petition protesting vaccine mandates at the company. Meanwhile Apple employees are protesting going back to work. What have you seen from Big Tech that\\u2019s working well? \", \"Petersen: Big tech companies really are far more libertarian than most people recognize \\u2014 which is why the resistance to the vaccine mandate alongside the protests makes sense. The message that seems to work better in these companies: Let everyone figure their situation out, and if they\\u2019re doing their job well, does it really matter if they\\u2019re in the office or not? I think Twitter\\u2019s general posture of trying to figure out how to get employees to want to come into the office less is pretty smart.\", \"Warzel: Dropbox has been so great here. Its leaders committed early on to being a fully remote company and said employees can leave if they don\\u2019t like it. They are rebuilding all their offices across the country for episodic work (meetings, things that have to be collaborative). But what they\\u2019re also doing is rewriting the entire company culture, down to how they deal with payroll in different states. What\\u2019s refreshing is that they\\u2019re committing to rethinking things and not just tasking the H.R. department with getting people some new computer monitors. This is a corporate restructuring in order to do work that makes the most sense for their employees.\", \"And Dropbox is being humble about it. People there have told us that if this ends up as a disaster, they\\u2019ll work accordingly. The last part is most important. As the last two years have shown us, even the smartest gurus have no idea what next month will look like.\", \"The U.S.\\u2019s failure to pass substantive and thoughtful tech regulation \\u2014 particularly as Big Tech has grown to be the most powerful global force \\u2014 has opened the door for the rest of the world to take the lead, for better or worse. That started many years ago with the passage of Europe\\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation and has been followed by a series of efforts by global regulators to try to rein in Big Tech.\", \"Some of it makes sense, like what is under consideration in Europe. The Digital Markets Act would compel platforms that are considered \\u201cgatekeepers\\u201d to play fair on them, while the Digital Services Act is focused on moderation of illegal content. Margrethe Vestager, the European Union\\u2019s top antitrust enforcer, was pressing both the European Parliament and European Council to quickly pass the legislation, which will largely affect the biggest companies, even if there had to be compromises made.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s important that everyone realizes that it is best to get 80 percent now than 100 percent never,\\u201d Vestager said at a recent forum.\", \"But some of proposed rules elsewhere are more worrisome. Consider the legislation put forth by Prime Minister Scott Morrison of Australia that would force social media giants to fork over data on those who post comments that could be interpreted as defamatory.\", \"\\u201cThe online world shouldn\\u2019t be a Wild West where bots and bigots and trolls and others can just anonymously go around and harm people and hurt people, harass them and bully them and sledge them,\\u201d Morrison said at a news conference. \\u201cThat\\u2019s not what can happen in the real world, and there\\u2019s no case for it to be able to be happening in the digital world.\\u201d\", \"While we can all agree that trolls and online hate speech are a blight and the companies are hopelessly slow at moderation, the proposed law presents huge personal privacy problems. Worse, it would be an enforcement nightmare with a convoluted complaint scheme that could be easily abused by the very trolls it seeks to wrangle. Safety has not been high on the to-do list of companies like Meta but this feels like the wrong way to handle it.\", \"Better is how Meta is now moving to deal with disinformation, at least according to its new threat report, which chronicled a wide takedown of disinformation networks related to anti-vaxxers as well as state actors.\", \"Before the free-speech-no-matter-what folks get all scratchy, these are fake accounts, which are using the platform to spew toxic propaganda.\", \"The moves by Meta are getting good reviews from people who have been critical of the company in the past, such as Stanford Law\\u2019s Nate Persily. He tweeted, \\u201cThese Facebook takedowns are impressive.\\u201d \", \"I have to hope that\\u2019s a continuing trend, which it appears to be from a Twitter thread and blog posted by Meta\\u2019s head of security policy, Nathaniel Gleicher, who many inside and outside the company think is a force for positive change. It is critical that Meta open itself up even more, with transparency around the impact of the takedowns.\"]","href_hash":"6359852953c711eca2f8e96e7cfe2de3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6359852953c711eca2f8e96e7cfe2de3"}},
