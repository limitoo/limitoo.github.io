closure.\", \"The closure of oyster harvesting was put in place last month following\\u00a0reports of consumers becoming ill with Vibrio parahaemolyticus after eating raw oysters.\", \"The shutdown is estimated to have cost growers hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost stock, as hundreds of kilograms of frozen produce had to be thrown away, and fresh harvesting was put on hold.\", \"Restrictions on growers will be progressively lifted from this week as individual businesses demonstrate the safety of their systems, with final clearance to be granted by SA Health.\", \"So far, SA Health has granted three emergency orders to allow Angel Seafood, Pristine Oyster Farm\\u00a0and Southern Eyre Seafood to harvest and sell oysters from the Point Longnose Aquaculture Zone for their licensed areas only.\", \"Grower Isaac (Zac) Halman from Angel Seafood said\\u00a0it was a relief to be able to sell his produce again.\", \"<img

company had been required to throw away some frozen goods.\", \"\\\"We had to get rid of some product from September and October, which was a kick in the guts,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We are\\u00a0able to now restock that supply and that demand is starting to come back again \\u2014 and even stronger \\u2014 with the wholesalers and food services and retail.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Growers to feel ban losses 'for some time'</div>\", \"The South Australian Oyster Growers Association (SAOGA) welcomed the news but chairman Rob Kerin said it would\\u00a0still take some time before all

support them as they deal with the implementation of new control measures and get back on their feet, which could take longer for some growers than others,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"In the meantime, we hope consumers will show their support by purchasing much-loved South Australian oysters as they progressively make their way back into the shops and into restaurants ahead of Christmas and beyond.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Oysters on the table for Christmas\\u00a0</div>\", \"Mr Halman said he did not think that Coffin Bay would be left with a bad reputation due to the shutdown,
