They include Saniyya Sidney and Demi Singleton, who play Venus and Serena Williams in \\u201cKing Richard\\u201d opposite Will Smith as their father; Woody Norman, who tag-teams with Joaquin Phoenix in \\u201cC\\u2019mon C\\u2019mon\\u201d; and Daniel Ranieri as a boy learning about life from a bar-owning uncle (Ben Affleck) in the George Clooney-directed drama \\u201cThe Tender Bar\\u201d (due Dec. 17).\", \"In phone and video calls this month \\u2014 Hill, Norman, Sidney and Singleton from Los Angeles, and Ranieri from Brooklyn \\u2014 the five actors shared what it was like working with stars of the screen and court, behind-the-scenes stories and how they reacted to seeing their faces on posters for the first time. These are edited excerpts from the conversations.\", \"The 11-year-old plays 9-year-old Buddy in \\u201cBelfast.\\u201d\", \"One morning I woke up for a normal school day, and my mum showed me an email. I only read about two words of it before I started running around the house screaming that I got the role, and I was going to get to work with all these amazing people \\u2014 Jamie Dornan, Caitriona Balfe, Ciar\\u00e1n Hinds, Judi Dench.\", \"Me and Buddy aren\\u2019t that different \\u2014 we both love football [soccer] and films and have the same personality. Every second the cameras weren\\u2019t rolling, I was playing football with the other actors.\", \"Judi Dench is very, very funny, and sometimes very inappropriate. To have her play my grandma is insane. We bet two pounds to see who could guess the number of times it would take to film a scene, and I ended up winning. I\\u2019m keeping that money in my memory box forever.\", \"I\\u2019m definitely not a ladies\\u2019 man. All the scenes with that girl [whom Buddy has a crush on] were very, very awkward!\", \"The first time I saw my face on a poster I thought, \\u201cThat\\u2019s not real.\\u201d I\\u2019m still just a normal kid, and this is my first film, but I think if you work hard, then you can achieve anything.\", \"I learned so many things, but the biggest was to have fun with acting. My little sister, Georgia, who\\u2019s 9, has also started acting. Maybe she\\u2019ll become an actor, too.\", \"I cried the first time I watched the film. And I still get really emotional every time I see it.\", \"I\\u2019d love to play one of the Avengers in a Marvel film. It\\u2019s between Thor and Iron Man. That\\u2019s No. 1 on my bucket list.\", \"The 14-year-old plays a young Serena Williams in her formative years in \\u201cKing Richard.\\u201d\", \"I came to L.A. from New York City, and once I got here, Saniyya came over, we hung out and we\\u2019ve been friends ever since. We recently went to Halloween Horror Nights together, and while we were filming, we\\u2019d go to The Grove [an outdoor mall] every other weekend.\", \"Venus and Serena surprised us with a visit to the set. We spoke about everything except tennis. It was great to see their sisterly bond firsthand and really helped me and Saniyya as actresses.\", \"The tennis training was intense. I was expecting it to be so easy because I\\u2019ve been dancing for my entire life and thought it\\u2019d be much more similar to choreography. The hardest thing to master was the serve. You can be great at every other shot, but if you don\\u2019t know how to serve, you\\u2019re unlikely to win.\", \"Mr. Will was hard to take seriously in those short shorts! We would make fun of him, but we also really admire him \\u2014 he\\u2019s so kind, so humble and was always teaching us something. One thing he told Saniyya and me was to be very selective about the roles we choose because they can define who you are for the rest of your career.\", \"Aunjanue [Ellis, who plays Venus and Serena\\u2019s mother] taught me how to speak up for myself and my character. There were one or two scenes where I read it and didn\\u2019t feel like Serena would react that way, and you feel like you\\u2019re so young and aren\\u2019t supposed to say much, but she showed me it was OK to talk to the director and come up with different ways to do things.\", \"Any role that highlights how powerful women can be is a role I want to be in. I also really want to do an action movie like \\u201cWonder Woman\\u201d or \\u201cBlack Widow,\\u201d because that\\u2019s been my dream ever since I was a little girl.\", \"The 15-year-old plays Venus Williams as she\\u2019s first winning tournaments in \\u201cKing Richard.\\u201d\", \"When Venus and Serena came to set, what I took away was how close the family was. They told us, \\u201cYeah, we all shared rooms and did talent shows together; we were so close that there was never a day we weren\\u2019t together.\\u201d\", \"When you create a character from someone else\\u2019s imagination, you have the freedom to create emotions and traits, but with a real-life person, you want to make sure you\\u2019re portraying them the best you can. I spent lots of time studying videos of Venus and Serena when they were younger.\", \"The tennis training was quite intense. The way Venus and Serena play is so unique, and I worked on Venus\\u2019s serve every day. My coach, Mr. Eric [Taino], and I were both so proud the day I got the serve down. I\\u2019m left-handed, but I had to learn to play right-handed for the movie.\", \"Mr. Will is the funniest person ever. It was amazing to watch him create Richard. He inspired me to push myself because he would come to work each day better than yesterday.\", \"My family is like, \\u201cOh my goodness, we know you as Saniyya, and now we\\u2019re going around town and seeing you on a billboard \\u2014 that\\u2019s kind of crazy, girl!\\u201d They\\u2019re so proud.\", \"I hope families all go see this movie and feel like they\\u2019re represented. I also want young girls who may be seeing themselves onscreen to know that it\\u2019s important to stay humble and keep your head up. Make sure to take care of yourself.\", \"I\\u2019d love to do an action film. A Marvel movie star that plays tennis would be hilariously cool.\", \"The 10-year-old plays the writer J.R. Moehringer as a boy in \\u201cThe Tender Bar.\\u201d\", \"My mom filmed me cursing about the lockdown, and a couple of months later it went viral. Jimmy Kimmel wanted me on his show, and right after we got done with the interview, George Clooney\\u2019s casting director contacted my mom and said George wanted me to be in his next movie. I was like, \\u201cWait, what?!\\u201d\", \"Ben was so nice to me \\u2014 me and him have a connection now. The last day of filming, he got me like 10 PlayStation games, with a headset. I keep asking him, \\u201cWhen are you coming to New York?\\u201d\", \"The best advice I got was when you\\u2019re filming, don\\u2019t act like you\\u2019re filming \\u2014 just talk like you\\u2019re having a real conversation.\", \"One of my favorite scenes was with me and Tye [Sheridan, who plays J.R. Moehringer as a young man]. Tye is having a dream \\u2014 he\\u2019s drunk \\u2014 and sees his younger self, which is me, and I smack him and tell him to wake up. I tell him, \\u201cHey, I thought you were going to be a writer?\\u201d and he says, \\u201cYeah, I am,\\u201d and I say \\u201cNo, you\\u2019re not, you\\u2019re a copy boy!\\u201d\", \"I didn\\u2019t always want to be an actor. I wanted to be a race driver, and then I changed my mind and wanted to be a firefighter, but now I\\u2019m really stuck on being an actor.\", \"I did a lot of the scenes in one or two takes \\u2014 George was so easy to film with and didn\\u2019t do 100 takes. But every time we got done filming a scene, I had to go back into school on set. It was so annoying because I couldn\\u2019t really watch anyone else film or learn anything from Tye and Ben.\", \"I\\u2019d love to be someone from \\u201cStar Wars\\u201d or be in an Avengers film. My dream is to work with Dwayne \\u201cThe Rock\\u201d Johnson, Chris Evans or Chris Hemsworth.\", \"The 12-year-old Brit plays the American Jesse, a boy staying with his uncle (played by Phoenix) for a while in \\u201cC\\u2019mon C\\u2019mon.\\u201d\", \"Joaquin rolled up to the audition in his pajamas \\u2014 they were red and looked like painter\\u2019s clothes. He\\u2019s such a nice guy, so genuine. We would just play, bouncing ideas off each other. We\\u2019re still great friends.\", \"We were always laughing \\u2014 I got headaches! Joaquin\\u2019s laugh is so contagious. I just learned to always try to be as comfortable as you can on set.\", \"We\\u2019d start filming, and then I\\u2019d decide what to do. We\\u2019d never practice. Well, we\\u2019d read the lines like once, but they\\u2019re very loose, and we\\u2019d add whatever we wanted to them. There are lots of scenes that aren\\u2019t in the script.\", \"I have a good memory, but only for things that are interesting. Like, I can never remember things to do with school. I can learn a scene after reading it two or three times. I have a photographic memory \\u2014 I use that term loosely, it\\u2019s not really photographic. It\\u2019s more like, if I can\\u2019t remember, I close my eyes and imagine what it looks like.\", \"I don\\u2019t like playing people too much like me. Jesse is very different from me \\u2014 he\\u2019s introverted, I\\u2019m extroverted; he doesn\\u2019t have many friends, I have my group of friends \\u2014 so I can put a little of myself into the role, as opposed to it all just being me.\", \"What I want people watching the film to take away is that young people are humans with opinions just as valid as yours. We are not children or babies.\"]","href_hash":"2c6d68264ed711ec861bef0d7ca89dae"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"2c6d68264ed711ec861bef0d7ca89dae"}},
