Their work \\u201csuggests a way out or forward in a very serious context,\\u201d he added, referencing Northern Ireland\\u2019s long history of sectarianism.\", \"\\u201cLive art and performance has quite an august, avant-garde heritage to it,\\u201d he said. \\u201cThe way they\\u2019re doing it is new and different.\\u201d\", \"At recent abortion-rights rallies in Northern Ireland, Array turned up with lighthearted banners featuring the ancient \\u2014 and rather graphic \\u2014 figure of sheela na gig. They have also attended other rallies dressed as cakes. At Coventry\\u2019s Herbert Art Gallery and Museum, Array built a pub inside one of the galleries, papering its ceiling with political protest banners.\", \"Array is the first collective to win the prize since 2015, when Assemble, an architecture and design group, triumphed. The Belfast-based group beat four other collectives, including Black Obsidian Sound System, a group of Black queer, trans and nonbinary people who stage club nights, and Cooking Sections, whose art highlights the problems of salmon farming. The other nominees were Gentle/Radical, a Wales-based group of faith ministers and youth workers who aim to bring art to poor households, and Project Art Works, a community of neurodiverse artists.\", \"Array will receive 25,000 pounds (around $33,000), while the other shortlisted artists will each be awarded 10,000 pounds (about $13,000).\", \"The Turner Prize, first awarded in 1984, helped turn some of its recipients, like Damien Hirst and Steve McQueen, into household names in Britain. But it has also long stirred controversy here, with newspapers regularly criticizing the prize\\u2019s nominees as too conceptual or out of touch with mainstream tastes.\", \"This year was no different, with some art critics complaining about the choice of five collectives, rather than individual artists, especially since their works often seemed to be more about political activism than art.\", \"In a review of the nominees\\u2019 work, Rachel Campbell-Johnston, a critic for The Times of London, commended the artist collectives for being committed to political change. \\u201cThe problem is,\\u201d she added, \\u201ctheir art is terrible.\\u201d\", \"Some artists also took issue. Jake Chapman, one half of the Chapman Brothers who were nominated for the prize in 2003, told The New York Times last month that the prize was now serving a \\u201cvery defined and performative sense of social responsibility,\\u201d which was limiting its ability to showcase experimental and more open-ended art.\", \"Farquharson said that collectives were chosen partly because the pandemic meant few exhibitions of individual artists occurred in Britain in the past year. It was natural to look for artists working in their communities, he said, adding that Array\\u2019s victory \\u201cproved the benefit\\u201d of that decision.\"]","href_hash":"d9a5273652e211ec9720191e077c28eb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"d9a5273652e211ec9720191e077c28eb"}},
