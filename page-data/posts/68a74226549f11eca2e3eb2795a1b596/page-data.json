But believe it or not, there are things I like about our current era, including, as you know, cheering on \\u201cthey\\u201d as a singular pronoun. So, after the Thanksgiving holiday seems a good time to point out some other things I appreciate about our times.\", \"One of them is land acknowledgments. There is an increasingly common practice, especially in academic circles, of prefacing public presentations or events with a ritual acknowledgment that the land the event is taking place on was originally occupied and cared for by Native Americans, with a specification of the particular Indigenous nation of that land.\", \"I\\u2019m glad this is happening, despite the opinion of some, such as the New York Post columnist Kyle Smith, who called land acknowledgments \\u201cthe latest in meaningless self-scourging progressive fashion statements.\\u201d I\\u2019ve always found it quietly dismaying that the land that America occupies was wrested from people who had lived on it for millenniums before, and that today Native Americans represent such as small percentage of our body politic, and so much has been built up on the land, that there\\u2019s no realistic way, given the magnitude of the injustice, to reverse it or even adequately redress it. I\\u2019ve often thought, \\u201cUnder this parking lot, right where that subdivision is, whole lives and societies existed that are now utterly lost.\\u201d The least we can do is to regularly \\u2014 yes, ritually \\u2014 mention this, especially if this least is the best we\\u2019re willing to do.\", \"I like what I see on television. Particularly children\\u2019s television. I look over my daughters\\u2019 shoulders and see a heartening multiplicity of Black stars and characters on their favorite shows that just wasn\\u2019t there a few years ago. One that comes to mind: Netflix\\u2019s delightful baking show, \\u201cNailed It!\\u201d is hosted to perfection by Nicole Byer, a young Black woman. No, I haven\\u2019t forgotten that the wonderfully diverse \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d has been with us since 1969. But the sheer frequency with which today\\u2019s children\\u2019s shows (and not just the stuff of public television) are, yes, centering people of color, feels different. \\u201cSesame Street\\u201d once felt like a televised utopia; today\\u2019s fare, especially animated, commercial programming, often presents diversity as something blissfully unremarkable.\", \"The hit Nickelodeon series \\u201cThe Loud House\\u201d follows a cartoon family in which the main character, a boy named Lincoln, lives with 10 sisters. They\\u2019re white, but the show makes an effort to depict a multihued world everywhere beyond the house: Lincoln\\u2019s best friend, Clyde, is Black (and over the course of several seasons, has been voiced by two Black actors), with nothing made of it beyond the simple fact. One of the sisters\\u2019 boyfriends is Latino (voiced by a Latino actor), and one of the supporting characters is of South Asian descent (voiced by a South Asian actress). The \\u201cLoud House\\u201d spinoff, \\u201cThe Casagrandes,\\u201d is about the boyfriend\\u2019s Mexican American extended family. We\\u2019re a long way from \\u201cThe Flintstones.\\u201d\", \"Interestingly, the same thing is happening on popular animated shows for adults: On the long-running \\u201cFamily Guy,\\u201d Blackness has often been played for comedy; but on a recent episode, the main character, Peter, gets a new boss, a Black guy, whose race is incidental. He stood out not for being Black but for trying to squeeze the fun out of at-work birthday parties \\u2014 you know, like a stereotypical boss. A recent episode of the also long-running \\u201cBob\\u2019s Burgers\\u201d introduced a character as the game master of a Dungeons & Dragons-style game who was nerdy, charmingly awkward and a Black woman \\u2014 i.e. a full spectrum of a human being. The hit \\u201cTed Lasso\\u201d portrays today\\u2019s United Kingdom, where whiteness is hardly default as Black and brown people are part of the warp and woof of all levels of society. A recent \\u201cArcher\\u201d episode even jokes about today\\u2019s Britain, when Lana (voiced, as it happens, by the Black actress Aisha Tyler, who had a recurring role as Ross\\u2019s girlfriend on \\u201cFriends\\u201d back when there was a mild uproar about that show\\u2019s lack of Black friends!) wrongly assumes a Black man will stand out in a London crowd.\", \"No doubt, some of you will think these pop-cultural examples are superficial. But imagine a \\u201950s-era segregationist sitting down to watch TV now and realizing that these shows are there for the watching in just about every American home \\u2014 they\\u2019d be apoplectic. That represents genuine change, reflecting transformations in attitude and perception, which younger people, especially, see not as \\u201coh, wow!\\u201d but \\u201cof course!\\u201d \\u2014 as it should be.\", \"Another good thing about our moment is that we\\u2019re gradually shedding the idea that racism is about only individual feelings, nasty words and overt acts of bigotry. The idea of systemic racism \\u2014 societal inequities rooted in racism of the past or present that represent barriers, in many instances, for people of color \\u2014 is now common coin to a greater extent.\", \"Sure, I have documented my issues with the way we are taught to think about systemic racism, and to say that opinions about how to address it differ is putting it mildly. The argument for reparations, for instance, is not the utterly settled question some suppose. And controversy will continue over whether the take on systemic racism originating in, and taking a cue from, critical race theory is a useful one.\", \"However, I welcome the increased awareness of the notion of systemic racism. Despite my alarm at the excesses of today\\u2019s progressive politics, I\\u2019ve never argued the simplistic notion that racism boils down to cross-burnings and white people saying the N-word. I recall sadly a conversation I had, when I was a grad student, with a white woman who was an undergraduate. She said, roughly: \\u201cSo today, Black people can go anywhere they want, they can do anything they want \\u2014 what\\u2019s the problem?\\u201d And she wasn\\u2019t terribly interested in an answer. Her question was more of a declaration, what she regarded as just facts, and she felt no civic impulse to even consider otherwise.\", \"Of course, her perspective, then, is alive and well now. Yet an undergrad today would be much less likely to see race matters only that far. The racial reckoning of recent years; the cultural decentering of whiteness; and the airing of what is meant by systemic racism have brought about that positive evolution. The other day I heard some white kids \\u2014 upper-middle-class New Yorkers \\u2014 casually referring in passing to systemic racism while walking down the street from school, clearly thinking of it as an assumed concept. I was hearing no such thing in my grad student days. Gallup polling asking \\u201cAre Black people in your community treated less fairly than White people?\\u201d in situations involving the workplace, shopping, dining out, interactions with police and access to health care, shows that from 1997 until 2021, white Americans and Americans overall became more aware of racial disparities.\", \"A meaningful approach to getting past race \\u2014 and that should be the goal \\u2014 must acknowledge progress, which is evident in a variety of ways. We should also acknowledge the past, as long as we do so with a view toward improving the present. It\\u2019s OK to look back, as long as you don\\u2019t stare.\"]","href_hash":"68a74226549f11eca2e3eb2795a1b596"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"68a74226549f11eca2e3eb2795a1b596"}},
