It was not immediately clear how much money, if any, was paid.\", \"The mass kidnapping of more than a dozen American citizens, five children among them, set off an international furor, with U.S. lawmakers condemning the violence in Haiti, and the F.B.I. and the State Department working with the local authorities to win the missionaries\\u2019 freedom.\", \"Mass abductions have become commonplace in Haiti, but the brazen kidnapping in broad daylight shocked even local officials and residents accustomed to gang-fueled violence, a further sign of the country\\u2019s growing lawlessness.\", \"Security in the country has broken down in the wake of numerous natural disasters and political crises, including the assassination in July of President Jovenel Mo\\u00efse. Violence has overwhelmed much of the capital, and by some estimates, powerful gangs now control about half the city.\", \"The gangs, armed and often with political backing, have long been part of the country\\u2019s social fabric, but after Mr. Mo\\u00efse\\u2019s killing, they have turned more assertive, taking control of vast swaths of territory.\", \"A magnitude 7.2 earthquake struck Haiti in August, deepening the devastation of a country that has yet to recover from a tremor in 2010 that killed more than 200,000 people. Rescue efforts this summer were initially hampered by security concerns, and aid flowed freely only after gangs that controlled a highway connecting the southern peninsula to the rest of Haiti declared a truce. A severe storm followed days later.\", \"The surging gang violence has prompted peaceful protests of late, with groups in towns and cities demanding a government response. Some blockaded roads and set tires on fire, a common protest symbol in Haiti.\"]","href_hash":"89eae0a24b1511eca9b8ff06f4db3203"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"89eae0a24b1511eca9b8ff06f4db3203"}},
