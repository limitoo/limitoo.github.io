concerned\\u00a0about\\u00a0exposure sites\\u00a0in the state's south-east.\", \"The new cases are a man in his 40s, a woman in her 20s and a woman in her 50s, all of whom acquired their infections interstate.\", \"A fourth case, a child, has been counted in another jurisdiction but is in South Australia, bringing the number of current active cases in the state to eight.\", \"No new exposure sites have yet been added as a result of those cases, but health authorities have raised concerns about exposure sites linked to the increasing rates of COVID-19 in areas along the Victorian border.\", \"South Australia opened its interstate borders last Tuesday, but\\u00a0two\\u00a0of the exposure sites date back to last weekend.\", \"Locations in Kingston SE, Naracoorte and Mount Gambier were last night identified as exposure sites at various times on Tuesday and Wednesday, as well as a\\u00a0pub in Willalooka on Saturday and a grocery shop in Bordertown on Sunday.\", \"SA Chief Public Health Officer Professor Nicola Spurrier said some of the exposure sites were linked to cases who had travelled into the state\\u00a0as part of the border bubble arrangements and then tested positive back in Victoria.\", \"\\\"I think this would have happened regardless of the whole borders opening on the 23rd because of course we have had the border communities and that\\u00a0border bubble,\\\" she said.\", \"One of the most concerning exposure sites for health authorities this morning has been\\u00a0the Willalooka Tavern, which was listed as a \\\"close contact\\\" site from 6pm until midnight on\\u00a0Saturday, November 20.\", \"A positive case attended an event at the pub called\\u00a0Day on the Tavern Green, but\\u00a0it was only identified as \\\"close contact\\\" site\\u00a0last night.\", \"Professor Spurrier said the QR check-in data \\\"didn't seem to align with the number of people there\\\" and SA Health were trying to contact everyone who attended during the time.\", \"Anyone who attended during the exposure time must be tested immediately as well as\\u00a0quarantine for seven days if they are vaccinated\\u00a0\\u2014 which would almost be finished \\u2014\\u00a0or 14 days if they are unvaccinated.\", \"\\\"The main thing for us is getting everybody tested, we need to locate people and then get everybody tested,\\\" Professor Spurrier said.\", \"In a post on their Facebook page, the Willalooka Tavern said it would be closed until Tuesday morning.\", \"Check the table below to find all the sites and exposure windows.\", \"You can find information on testing site hours and the nearest site to you on the SA Health\\u00a0website.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'Really good' vaccination rate in the South East</div>\", \"Professor Spurrier said\\u00a0the vaccination rate in the South East was \\\"really good\\\", including 91.9 per cent double vaccinated in the City of Mount Gambier and 84.3 per cent in the Naracoorte Lucindale Council region.\", \"\\\"But if you are not vaccinated in those regional areas please avail yourself to the vaccine, it's really critical that you're protecting yourself and also don't forget all the other COVID-safe behaviours,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"We do know what to do in SA, we've done it before, we've done it last year.\\\"\", \"Professor Spurrier reminded people to keep a safe distance from others, wear a mask, keep up hand hygiene, and to stay home if sick and get tested.\", \"\\\"If you're going to have Christmas parties or get-togethers, think about doing it outdoors rather than indoors it's just a bit safer in terms of that disease transmission,\\\" she said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">New rules for interstate arrivals</div>\", \"Yesterday, SA Police announced changes\\u00a0to testing requirements for travellers entering South Australia, which will come into effect from Sunday.\", \"Anyone entering the state from low-risk or moderate-risk LGAs such as Melbourne and Sydney will need to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours prior to arriving.\", \"Previously they only needed to have a test, but not wait for a negative result.\", \"Any close contacts of positive COVID-19 cases within the past seven days will not be allowed to enter South Australia.\", \"If they have been a close contact within the previous fortnight, they must have a COVID-19 test on day 13 in addition to the usual required tests.\", \"Residents arriving from the Victorian border town of Nhill will need to have a negative test before they enter, or have a test on arrival and quarantine until they receive a negative result.\", \"Testing requirements have also been imposed for people in border communities who\\u00a0have visited a low- or moderate-risk area within the past seven days.\", \"\\\"It is complicated because people's lives are complicated, and where they move is complicated,\\\" Professor Spurrier said.\", \"Premier Steven Marshall said today the new requirements were a \\\"slight tweak\\\" to avoid high numbers of people needing to quarantine.\", \"<img

border re-opening was proceeding as expected.(ABC News)</div>\", \"\\\"Last week we did see a situation when an entire flight was put into seven days of quarantine because of a single passenger who ultimately had a very infectious case on board,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We don't want to be putting a huge number of people into quarantine.\\\"\", \"Mr Marshall said the requirements for interstate travellers would \\\"buy us some time\\\" as the state moved towards higher vaccination rates.\", \"\\\"The worrying thing from this situation was these cases that are coming through now where they are highly infectious, if we can pick those up earlier and not having those people coming\\u00a0into South Australia, it allows us to get further as we increase our vaccination rate,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We're not going to be able to keep COVID out, we've already had cases coming in, there will be more cases coming in, but we want to slow the progress of this disease in the early stages as we increase the vaccination rate.\\\"\", \"Mr Marshall said he was comfortable with the number of cases since the borders opened.\", \"\\\"We're going to see cases, we're going to see them almost on a daily basis now but because we have these speed bumps in the disease's\\u00a0way \\u2026\\u00a0we'll get onto those cases early which means it won't spread uncontrolled across South Australia.\\\"\", \"Mr Marshall said he expected the state to achieve\\u00a090 per cent for single vaccination this weekend.\", \"\\\"That means in\\u00a0three or four weeks we will be at 90 per cent for the entire population 12 and over,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"But we're being absolutely cautious as we open these borders.\\\"\", \"<img
