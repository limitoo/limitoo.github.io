The bill will now head to the Senate where it will be voted on before being signed into law.\", \"The bill regularly passes with large bipartisan support and is expected to do so in the Senate.\", \"The $768 billion defense bill will fund the U.S. military in the new year and also reform the military judicial system. It will criminalize sexual harassment and allow violent crimes to be prosecuted without requiring a commander's approval. The bill will also prohibit the use of private funding to deploy any state's National Guard to another state, except for in the case of natural disasters.\", \"Congressional Democrats had considered tying the debt ceiling increase to the defense funding bill, but Republicans opposed the idea. Senate Republicans indicated that they would vote against the combined proposal and accused Democrats of trying to force them into supporting an estimated $30 trillion debt increase, including whatever consequences the increase might have.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1947337/house-vote-debt-ceiling-defense-funding-medicare.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">On Tuesday, the House voted to approve military defense funding into the new year.

Doctors and hospitals nationwide face a potential loss of billions of federal Medicare dollars due to a combination of cuts that will soon go into effect unless Congress acts.\", \"The \\\"Pay As You Go\\\" Medicare budget requires the federal government to reduce Medicare spending by 4 percent if annual Medicare spending passes a certain point. In this case, the federal government passed that point after the March passage of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act. The act increased Medicare spending to help meet medical and economic needs during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\", \"Doctors will also face a 3.75 percent cut to their Medicare payments on January 1, 2022, as a result of expiring pay increases that Congress authorized earlier in the pandemic. In 2019, Congress also delayed a planned 2 percent cut to Medicare which expires at the end of the year.\", \"If Congress doesn't act, hospitals could face a 6 percent reduction in Medicare dollars, and doctors could face up to 10 percent reduction. The reduction could harm medical providers just as the nation experiences a resurgence in COVID-19 cases.\", \"Finally, the House is also considering a measure that would place additional limits on executive power. Its proposals are largely in response to actions taken by Republican former President Donald Trump.\", \"The measure would prohibit presidents from offering pardons in suspiciously corrupt instances, refusing responses to oversight subpoenas, secretly reallocating congressionally-approved funds for other purposes, retaliating against inspectors general and whistle-blowers; as well as accepting payments and gifts while in office.\"]","href_hash":"9761306157d611ecb0f40ba0657e84e6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9761306157d611ecb0f40ba0657e84e6"}},
