Officials had mistakenly included more than 130,000 test ballots in the count.\", \"It was not the first time the agency has come under fire. It has repeatedly received criticism over nepotism, ineptitude and corruption.\", \"The general election on Tuesday appeared to be running more smoothly. Michael J. Ryan, the executive director of the New York City Board of Elections, said around 9:30 a.m. that there had not been major disruptions to voting across the city.\", \"\\u201cYou get a sense when things are off on the right foot and that they are moving the right direction \\u2014\\u00a0and that is the sense I have this morning,\\u201d Mr. Ryan said.\", \"It was expected there would be fewer issues because of the nature of the election. The ballot is simpler because there is no ranked-choice voting, a system that was used in the primary and allowed voters to rank up to five choices in order of preference.\", \"And voter turnout has been pretty slow in this election, judging by how many New Yorkers chose to vote during nine days of early voting. Just under 170,000 people voted early in October. That figure was higher during the competitive primary in June, when about 190,000 voters cast early ballots.\", \"Still, some polling locations reported minor problems on Tuesday morning.\", \"At M.S. 137 in the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens, some voters faced wait times of up to 20 minutes in the morning because of issues with ballot machines and missing poll workers, said Aaron Fernando, a volunteer for Felicia Singh, who is running for City Council.\", \"One prospective voter was nearly turned away from the site, he said, after a worker misinterpreted instructions. Others said they considered leaving out of frustration or to get to work on time, Mr. Fernando added.\", \"But some of the problems were resolved later in the morning when the Board of Elections sent a worker to the site, he said.\", \"The outlook remained better than in previous years.\", \"Election officials mistakenly purged about 200,000 people from voter rolls ahead of the 2016 election; they forced some voters to wait in four-hour lines on Election Day 2018; and they sent erroneous ballots to nearly 100,000 New Yorkers seeking to vote by mail last year.\", \"Eric Adams, the Brooklyn borough president, is widely expected to win the mayor\\u2019s race against Curtis Sliwa, the founder of the Guardian Angels \\u2014 and the view among many that the race has effectively been decided could reduce turnout.\", \"We expect to get results in the mayor\\u2019s race shortly after polls close at 9 p.m.\"]","href_hash":"5169cad03bf311eca8a0000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"5169cad03bf311eca8a0000017025a03"}},
