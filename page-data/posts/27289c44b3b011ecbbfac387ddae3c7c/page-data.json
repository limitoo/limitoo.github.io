Campaigners express doubts that they can be made to work economically and there are also concerns that technology could be seen as an excuse not to make the major changes in energy production that are needed.\", \"Scientists though say that the situation is now so serious that carbon dioxide removal will be needed in addition to massive cuts in emissions.\", \"The discussions to approve the report's Summary for Policymakers, due on Monday, have been one of the longest in IPCC history.\", \"Delegates worked through Saturday night and well into Sunday to finish the document.\", \"- BBC\"]","href_hash":"27289c44b3b011ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"27289c44b3b011ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
