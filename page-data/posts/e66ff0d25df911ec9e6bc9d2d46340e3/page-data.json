Today we\\u2019re getting more answers. The results are mixed, but there is cause for hope.\", \"First, the bad news. Dr. Anthony Fauci shared preliminary data from his institute\\u2019s analysis of the Moderna vaccine that showed that two doses produced a negligible antibody response against Omicron in the laboratory.\", \"However, in a departure from the torrent of worrying data about the variant, Fauci said that protection increased significantly after a third dose. He added that booster doses of both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines were likely to offer a substantial increase in protection against Omicron.\", \"\\u201cOur booster vaccine regimens work against Omicron,\\u201d he said, adding that \\u201cat this point, there is no need for a variant-specific booster.\\u201d\", \"The preliminary data from Fauci is also consistent with a study from Britain, which showed that two shots of Pfizer\\u2019s vaccine were 40 percent effective in preventing symptomatic infections from Omicron, but that effectiveness rose to 80 percent after a third shot.\", \"The news suggests that Omicron will cause breakthrough infections in fully vaccinated people who have not had their booster shots. The C.D.C. reported on Wednesday that 27 percent of fully vaccinated Americans have also had booster shots.\", \"We also received some encouraging findings about immunity against Omicron from a World Health Organization meeting today. Scientists presented several laboratory studies that suggest so-called T cells in vaccinated people can put up a strong defense against the variant, which could help prevent severe disease, hospitalization and death.\", \"While it\\u2019s becoming increasingly clear that Omicron can evade antibodies produced either by vaccination or by infection with previous variants, the new research suggests that T cells might serve as an effective backup when antibodies fail, preventing many infections from turning into severe disease.\", \"Some scientists cautioned that the data comes from laboratory experiments. It will take a few more weeks of examining real infections in people before we know for sure how well T cells prevent severe disease.\", \"The C.D.C. is predicting that a wave of infections caused by the Omicron variant could arrive in the U.S. as soon as next month, and warned of two possible outcomes \\u2014 neither of them good.\", \"The first is a huge wave of infections, of both Omicron and Delta, starting in the next few weeks. The second possibility is a smaller Omicron surge in the spring. It was unclear which forecast was more likely.\", \"In Europe, where reports of cases are doubling every two to three days, officials said that Omicron could become the dominant variant by mid-January. \\u201cWe are facing another Christmas in pandemic mode,\\u201d said Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission. According to estimates this week, cases of the variant in Denmark, which is similar to the U.S. in terms of vaccination rates and average age, were doubling every two days.\", \"The U.S. is already in a precarious spot. Daily cases have plateaued at about 120,000, and states in the Northeast and the Midwest are struggling to contain surges. Hospitalizations are also on the rise.\", \"More Omicron news:\", \"For nearly two years, the pandemic has been dividing families over issues like social distancing, mask-wearing, and vaccines. Now that the holiday season is here and families are gathering, many issues that have been simmering are reaching a boiling point.\", \"Readers have shared experiences of marriages torn apart over a difference in opinion on vaccinations, siblings who are no longer talking because of disagreements over virus restrictions, and relationships with family members that have become ever more strained as the pandemic has dragged on.\", \"If this sounds familiar, we\\u2019d like to hear from you. We\\u2019re asking readers: Has the pandemic strained relationships in your family? We\\u2019re also interested in hearing how you were able to negotiate these family divides \\u2014 if you managed to do so.\", \"If you\\u2019d like to participate, you can fill out the form here. We may use your response in an upcoming version of the Coronavirus newsletter.\", \"Let us know how you\\u2019re dealing with the pandemic.
