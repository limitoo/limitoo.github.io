He was 83.\", \"His death was announced by the Mutua Madrid Open tennis tournament where Santana was honorary president. No cause was given, but Marcos Garc\\u00eda Montes, a lawyer and close friend of Santana, told a Spanish television show that he had died of a heart attack. The former player had also been diagnosed with Parkinson\\u2019s disease.\", \"Santana, the first Spaniard to win a Grand Slam event, rose to the top echelon of world tennis during the amateur era by winning the U.S. National Championships at Forest Hills, N.Y., Wimbledon and the French Open, twice. He also represented Spain to win a gold medal in singles and a silver in doubles (when tennis was a demonstration sport) at the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City.\", \"His victories inspired an armada of Spanish players who have kept Spain among the most successful countries in tennis to this day.\", \"That progeny includes Manuel Orantes, Carlos Moy\\u00e1, Arantxa S\\u00e1nchez Vicario and Conchita Mart\\u00ednez. The greatest of them all, Rafael Nadal, a 20-time Grand Slam champion, called Santana his role model on Twitter. \\u201cA thousand thanks for what you did for our country and for opening the way for others,\\u201d he said. Santana, who never played in the Australian Open, and S\\u00e1nchez Vicario are second to Nadal in Slam victories, with four each.\", \"Santana won 72 tournaments in his career. His first success in a Grand Slam came in 1961 in Paris on his favorite surface, clay. He defeated two Australian stars, Roy Emerson and Rod Laver, before capturing the final against Italy\\u2019s Nicola Pietrangeli, a two-time winner in Paris. Three years later, Santana defeated Pietrangeli again in the French Open.\", \"In 1965, Santana established his credentials on grass, the surface he had once derided as made for cows and the one used at the time by three of the Grand Slam tournaments: Wimbledon, Forest Hills and the Australian Open. He became the first European in almost four decades to win at Forest Hills that year, beating Cliff Drysdale in the final of the tournament, which was later renamed the U.S. Open.\", \"The following year, Santana skipped the French Open to better prepare for Wimbledon. The strategy worked: He defeated Dennis Ralston in the final. Upon receiving the trophy, Santana sought to kiss the hand of the Duchess of Kent, a breach of royal protocol. But the breach also endeared him further to Spanish fans, who viewed him as a charismatic and warmhearted product of society\\u2019s margins in a sport once considered a realm of the elite.\", \"Manuel Santana Mart\\u00ednez was born on May 10, 1938, in Madrid. His father, Braulio Santana, was an electrician who was imprisoned after the Spanish Civil War and died when his son, known as Manolo, was a teenager. His mother, Mercedes Mart\\u00ednez, was a homemaker who struggled to raise her four children in an apartment building in which all the residents shared a single bathroom.\", \"Santana started at the Vel\\u00e1zquez tennis club in Madrid as a ball boy, skipping school to collect tips from tennis players and earn money to support his mother. Tennis drew him, he told the newspaper La Rioja of Logro\\u00f1o, because of the distance between competitors. \\u201cFor somebody who always hated violence,\\u201d he said, \\u201ca sport in which a net prevented physical contact felt like it was made for me.\\u201d\", \"At the club, he regularly prepared the clay court for two siblings from a wealthy family, \\u00c1lvaro and Aurora Romero Gir\\u00f3n. The two took an interest in Manuel, and encouraged him to combine tennis with a commitment to school, while also providing financial support for Santana\\u2019s mother.\", \"When he was 13, he won the ball boys tournament at the Vel\\u00e1zquez club and was officially admitted as a member. His game developed, and Santana, relying on an effective topspin, powerful forehand and craftily disguised drop shots, won the Spanish junior championships in 1955.\", \"\\u201cHis game was pretty unique and even though he was one of the best clay courters ever, he could play on anything,\\u201d said Stan Smith, the American former top player and president of the International Tennis Hall of Fame, which inducted Santana in 1984. \\u201cHe was an ultimate big occasion competitor, but I don\\u2019t know anyone who didn\\u2019t like and respect him,\\u201d he added, in a statement on the hall\\u2019s website.\", \"After retiring as a tennis player, Santana went on to be captain of Spain\\u2019s Davis Cup team from 1980 to 1985 and 1995 to 1999. He managed two tennis clubs \\u2014 in Madrid as well as Marbella \\u2014 and until 2019 was the tournament director of the\\u00a0Mutua Madrid Open, whose center court was named after him.\", \"A fixture on the Spanish social scene, Santana was married four times and had five children. He is survived by his wife, Claudia Rodr\\u00edguez; three children, Beatriz, Manolo and Borja, by his first wife, Mar\\u00eda Fernanda Gonz\\u00e1lez-Dopeso; a daughter, B\\u00e1rbara, with B\\u00e1rbara Oltra; and another daughter, Alba, whose mother, Mila Xim\\u00e9nez, was a well-known Spanish journalist who died this year. His 1990 marriage to Otti Glanzelius, a former Swedish model, ended in divorce in 2009.\"]","href_hash":"c32e84ae5de911ec9107e7aecb60bb0a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"c32e84ae5de911ec9107e7aecb60bb0a"}},
