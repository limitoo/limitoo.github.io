Metabeats describes itself as \\\"an NFT marketplace and digital reality platform.\\\"\", \"NFTs use cryptocurrency and blockchain technology to sell different assets online, such as concert tickets and artworks. The assets are not interchangeable. The seller or artist can create a digital file of the asset connected to a person's private key. The key proves the individual's ownership of the NFT and it allows owners to access the NFT through a particular app or website, such as Metabeats.\", \"However, people have criticized NFTs as a \\\"fraud,\\\" particularly when an NFT of an \\\"invisible\\\" sculpture recently sold for over $18,000.\", \"NFT assets are online entities and often have no physical real-world object related to the NFT. As such, reproductions of NFTs can be digitally shared and accessed by people who didn't purchase them. Critics say that the intense amount of computations needed to encode NFTs and trade NFTs on the blockchain contributes to climate change. French artist Joanie Lemercier told Wired that the sale of his first six NFTs consumed the same amount of power as his studio did over two years.\", \"Other web users will be able to listen to the music from Crazy Frog's NFT for free on YouTube and Spotify. This has led Crazy Frog's critics to question why anyone would purchase the NFT to begin with and to accuse Crazy Frog of cashing in on a online fad.\", \"Some NFT advocates have hailed them as groundbreaking innovations in the rapidly evolving digital art marketplace.\"]","href_hash":"265a235a5c8011ecbe3fdb50efd3d3dc"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"265a235a5c8011ecbe3fdb50efd3d3dc"}},
