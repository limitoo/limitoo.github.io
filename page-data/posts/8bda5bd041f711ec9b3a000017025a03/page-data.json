Their jewelry employs a lexicon of symbols culled from a host of esoteric traditions and expressive of what they term \\u201ctenets,\\u201d such as Strength, Karma and Dream. Now they\\u2019ve teamed up with another family-run business, the Milan-based Laboratorio Paravicini, makers of fine tableware, on a line of nine hand-painted gilded porcelain plates featuring the same suggestive runic vocabulary. The idea behind the Tenets collection, explains Beth, is to create modern heirlooms. \\u201cI have a lot passed down in my family,\\u201d she says. \\u201cWhen you touch those pieces, you know how many other loving hands also used them. There\\u2019s a feeling that you\\u2019re a part of a legacy of love.\\u201d From $65, foundrae.com.\", \"Artistic collaboration is a political act, according to the painter Tschabalala Self \\u2014 whose richly colored mixed-material canvases interrogate notions of the Black female body \\u2014 one she thinks Black creatives across various disciplines ought to engage in. \\u201cWhen there\\u2019s an opportunity to show camaraderie or allegiance to one another, it\\u2019s great to take it,\\u201d she says. So when the luxury retailer Yoox invited her to curate a small edition of design objects, Self asked her friends Brandon Blackwood, a fashion designer, and Reginald Sylvester II, an artist, to work with her. The resulting two-piece \\u201cOur House\\u201d collection, launching Oct. 19, comprises an exclusive iteration of Blackwood\\u2019s chic, boxy Kuei bag in leather, which he adorned with an allover pattern lifted by Self from her 2016 work \\u201cBellyphat,\\u201d as well as a voluptuous vessel in charcoal-dyed cement by Sylvester that can serve as both vase and candleholder. The latter piece\\u2019s packaging includes a drawing by Self of its sculptural, almost figurative form, constituting a de facto bonus artwork. From $350, yoox.com.\", \"With her first book, \\u201cUntitled,\\u201d which was recently shortlisted for Aperture\\u2019s PhotoBook Awards, the photographer Sasha Phyars-Burgess arrives with a highly developed style somewhere between portraiture and social documentary. The monograph\\u2019s first part, titled \\u201cThere (Yankee),\\u201d explores the artist\\u2019s Trinidadian heritage as seen through the eyes of a first-generation American born in Brooklyn. Many other photos from the book depict Black nightlife and party cultures, and deploy dance as a metaphor as much as a physical act: In a multiway interview with the artists Juliana Huxtable and Carolyn Lazard that accompanies the images, Phyars-Burgess likens the production and circulation of Black art to a dance circle: All are welcome to watch, but only those forming part of the circle glean its deepest meaning. Shot in black and white, primarily with a large-format film camera, Phyars-Burgess\\u2019s pictures convey subtle narrative cues via dazzling dramas of light, shape and shadow, uncovering an uncanny magic at the heart of everyday interactions. $60, becapricious.com.\", \"Not long after the South Africa-based designer Rich Mnisi launched his eponymous line of bold, gender-fluid fashion in 2015, he began experimenting with making furniture. \\u201cI realized I could think of designing furniture the same way I design clothing: by accommodating the human body,\\u201d he says. \\u201cI designed the first prototype to feel like an embrace from my great-grandmother.\\u201d Indeed, Mnisi\\u2019s couches, chaises and sofas bear a remarkable resemblance to recumbent female figures \\u00e0 la Henry Moore, a phenomenon in evidence in his first full collection of furniture, now on view at Southern Guild gallery in Cape Town. Such sinuousness can also have a dark side, however: One of the most striking objects of the six-piece collection is the Nyoka console (Nyoka, which is also the title of the show, means \\u201csnake\\u201d in Xitsonga), which features a writhing serpentine form whose head is hidden behind a painted and beaded curtain. \\u201cI often play with the concept of duality,\\u201d says Mnisi. \\u201cSo much good can be born of confronting fear.\\u201d southernguild.co.za.\", \"Nikolaj Hansson may be a self-described skateboarder at heart, but during the pandemic he developed a passion for tennis while playing on the courts in Faelledparken, Copenhagen\\u2019s largest park. Soon, Hansson \\u2014 a veteran of the Danish design world, having worked as a communications consultant for Tekla Fabrics and Muuto \\u2014 got to noticing, as any sartorially sensitive serve-and-volleyer must, the parlous state of tennis fashion, saturated as it is with \\u201chigh-level performance brands,\\u201d in his words, with scant regard for style. So he stepped into the breach and developed his own brand, Palmes Tennis Society, a line of classic tennis wear for both on and off the court. Its cotton polos, paneled shorts and houndstooth Shetland-wool blazer reference just enough retro preppy chic without going full country club. But perhaps Palmes\\u2019s classiest vintage nod is its Leo vest, inspired by the sweater-vests of erstwhile tennis style icons like Bj\\u00f6rn Borg and Boris Becker. It\\u2019s fitted to allow for freedom of movement mid-forehand, but also layers well with an oxford. From $50, palmes.co.\"]","href_hash":"8bda5bd041f711ec9b3a000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8bda5bd041f711ec9b3a000017025a03"}},
