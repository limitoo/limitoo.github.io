They had navigated their Pac-12 Conference schedule and stumbled just once, in overtime, at Stanford. They rose to become the nation\\u2019s third-ranked team.\", \"But at Rice-Eccles Stadium on Saturday night, when No. 23 Utah cast the Ducks aside, 38-7, the College Football Playoff ambitions of Oregon and the Pac-12 turned as dark as the nearby Wasatch Range after sunset.\", \"It was not, after all, the kind of game that might make the selection committee think Oregon was simply a little off. It was not the kind of loss that could be easily explained away by cold weather or the time change or the thumping Third Down Jump that so often on Saturday gave Utah\\u2019s student section the appearance of levitation. \", \"No, it was the kind of game that, considered alongside Saturday\\u2019s other results \\u2014 namely No. 4 Ohio State\\u2019s shellacking of No. 7 Michigan State \\u2014 made plain how muddled this season has been. And, with the playoff picture still coming into focus ahead of Thanksgiving, it reinforced how a team\\u2019s fortunes can prove brutally fickle. \", \"The Oregon team that logged 505 yards against Ohio State mustered only 294 on Saturday night, including just 63 yards on the ground. The team that had arrived in Salt Lake City with a perfect record for field goals this season failed to make two in the first half. And those were not even the worst of the special teams debacles; as the first half ended, Britain Covey returned a punt for a touchdown to push Utah\\u2019s lead to 28-0. \", \"It was Utah\\u2019s second touchdown in 27 seconds. \", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re upset, we\\u2019re disappointed in ourselves,\\u201d Mario Cristobal, Oregon\\u2019s coach, said afterward. Oregon, which could earn a berth in December\\u2019s Pac-12 championship game against Utah with a victory next weekend over Oregon State, still had plenty of goals within reach, he insisted.\", \"\\u201cThey blocked well, and they ran the ball well,\\u201d Cristobal, whose team did not reach the end zone until nearly five minutes into the second half, said of Utah. \\u201cIt\\u2019s as simple as that. It\\u2019s blocking and tackling, and they did it better than us.\\u201d\", \"With just more than 11 minutes to play in the first quarter, Utah\\u2019s offense trotted to its own 37. Tavion Thomas, a 221-pound tailback from Ohio who later in the night broke Utah\\u2019s record for rushing touchdowns in a season, picked up four yards. Cameron Rising, Utah\\u2019s sophomore quarterback, tried a pass that wound up incomplete.\", \"The Utes went back to the ground and, in a matter of minutes, seemed to take control. Utah ran for 49 yards across the next nine plays. Then, on a third and 9 after a missed pass, Thomas gathered force, slipping through a swarm of defenders and ran 10 yards for a touchdown. The last Duck with a chance had been at least a step away.\", \"But maybe, the thinking around Rice-Eccles went, Oregon could still rouse its offense. It was a worthy thought: Helped along by a pass interference penalty, the Ducks marched 47 yards. Oregon reached Utah\\u2019s 18 before summoning a kicker, Camden Lewis, for a 36-yard try. Cole Bishop batted it away.\", \"The Oregon defense held Utah, which started this season with a 1-2 record, scoreless on the home team\\u2019s next possession. But Utah\\u2019s four succeeding drives added up to 24 points, with no score more suffocating than Covey\\u2019s return. Utah did not stop scoring until midway through the fourth quarter.\", \"\\u201cThey played the best football game I could see a team play,\\u201d Anthony Brown, the Oregon quarterback who went 17 for 35 for 231 passing yards, said. Rising, his Utah counterpart, was 10 for 18 for 178 yards.\", \"\\u201cDefensively, our biggest thing was owning the line of scrimmage,\\u201d said Devin Lloyd, a Utah linebacker who had six tackles on Saturday. \\u201cWe weren\\u2019t going to switch up our scheme or do anything special.\\u201d\", \"Utah, of course, has a glorious history of spoiling others\\u2019 big games. It is the program that embarrassed Alabama in a Sugar Bowl, that humiliated Pittsburgh in a Fiesta Bowl, that wrecked Jim Harbaugh\\u2019s debut as Michigan\\u2019s coach. (Kyle Whittingham, who led Utah in those games, on Saturday night earned his 142nd victory as a head coach, a school record.)\", \"No matter. As time ticked down on a chilly night, the stadium announcer gently pleaded with fans to thwart the joyous uprising that felt inevitable.\", \"\\u201cPlease do not rush the field,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe ask that you celebrate safely in the stands.\\u201d\", \"Plenty stormed the field anyway. \", \"They will learn their team\\u2019s ranking, which will surely climb, on Tuesday evening, when the playoff selection committee will announce its latest whims. Besides the fallout from Michigan State\\u2019s spectacular collapse in Columbus, the committee will be wrestling between now and then with where to place a second-ranked Alabama team that has lately done more surviving than thriving. \", \"And what of Cincinnati, the fifth-ranked belle of the American Athletic Conference, a Group of 5 league, that stomped on Southern Methodist, 48-14? \", \"The playoff race will gain some clarity late this week, when rivalry games will threaten teams across the country. But, with a possible playoff expansion still years from taking effect and the harsh history that no two-loss team has reached a semifinal, the Pac-12 and the Atlantic Coast Conference are effectively out of the hunt already.\", \"The A.C.C., at least, has been a playoff fixture. The Pac-12 has not placed a team there since 2016, and the conference\\u2019s great prize will, once again, at most be a Rose Bowl win.\", \"\\u201cThis season has been all over the place: I think we have the best out-of-conference win at Ohio State, and I think we took some losses out of conference that we should never take,\\u201d George Kliavkoff, the Pac-12 commissioner, said in an interview in Salt Lake City on Saturday.\", \"\\u201cIt\\u2019s frustrating, and I\\u2019m hoping for more consistency out of all of our teams going forward,\\u201d he added, \\u201cand I\\u2019m particularly looking forward to those teams in our league that are going to have the opportunity to attract some really great coaches.\\u201d\", \"Maybe so. But on Saturday night, the Ducks were in measured agony over how a season that could have featured a playoff run had come up short so soon.\", \"\\u201cWe knew what we could have been,\\u201d Brown said before adding, \\u201cThe potential was there. We just didn\\u2019t maximize it.\\u201d\", \"On Sunday morning, Kliavkoff tweeted about basketball.\"]","href_hash":"8c2a143c4bbf11ec9fb4bd9e7ed59b06"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8c2a143c4bbf11ec9fb4bd9e7ed59b06"}},
