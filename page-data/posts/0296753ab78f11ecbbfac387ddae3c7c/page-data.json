They maintained he never lied, never took a bribe and was a victim of USC's desire to cover up a \\\"pervasive culture\\\" of accepting wealthy students who could provide donation windfalls.\", \"The university, which fired Vavic after his 2019 arrest, has stressed its admissions processes are \\\"not on trial.\\\"\", \"In a separate courtroom just minutes after Vavic's verdict was read, Riddell was contrite as he faced sentencing on fraud and money laundering conspiracy charges.\", \"The Harvard graduate, who emerged as a key figure in the wide-ranging scandal, apologized to the many students that lost out on college opportunities because of his \\\"terrible decision.\\\"\", \"He said he brought shame to his family and pleaded for leniency for cooperating with law enforcement officials and for committing to make amends now and going forward for his actions.\", \"Riddell's lawyers said he should serve one to two months in prison because he was neither the ringleader of the scheme nor a university insider, like the coaches and college administrators implicated. They also noted he's already paid nearly $166,000 toward the forfeiture obligation.\", \"Judge Nathaniel Gorton, however, sided with prosecutors who had argued for the four-month sentence.\", \"He said Riddell played a key role for many years in the scheme by secretly taking the ACT and SAT for students, or correcting their answers.\", \"\\\"And for what?\\\" the judge said. \\\"You did not need the money. How could you have stooped so low?\\\"\"]","href_hash":"0296753ab78f11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0296753ab78f11ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
