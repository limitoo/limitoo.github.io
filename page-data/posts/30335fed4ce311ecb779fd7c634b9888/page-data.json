Netflix and NBCUniversal are two companies that have already secured the status, which allows for a raise of the cap on the rebates they can receive for productions in the state.\", \"\\\"These deals certainly create a long-term sustainability to this industry,\\\" Dodson said. \\\"So we're not a flash-in-the-pan place to go shoot a western anymore.
