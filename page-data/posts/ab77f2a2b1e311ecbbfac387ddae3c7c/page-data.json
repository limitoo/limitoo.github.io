We never knew when Omicron was going to hit us in the way that it has, we had hoped that it would be in the warmer months and that is what has happened. But the reality is Covid isn't going away and we don't know what's going to happen with Covid next we're always trying to follow what's happening in the rest of the world, but we have to expect that there'll be other outbreaks and other elevated levels of Covid infection.\\\"\", \"The government had secured an additional 600,000 doses of the vaccine and widened free eligibility to all M\\u0101ori and Pasifika aged 55 and over.\", \"They were already free for people who were pregnant, over 65 or at risk of becoming seriously ill because of other underlying conditions.\", \"Otago University epidemiologist Michael Baker said everyone who was eligible should get their flu vaccine.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news_crops/126097/eight_col_Post_Budget_Poverty_Event-1.jpg?1625866933\\\" alt=\\\"No caption\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nMichael Baker. \\nPhoto: RNZ / Samuel Rillstone\\n</div>\", \"\\\"Anyone who's held off getting flu vaccine up to now, I think now's the year to get it just to boost your immunity coming into the flu season. And one of the other reasons is we know that if you get Covid-19 and you get influenza on top of that, you do have a higher risk of a poor outcome and dying,\\\" he said.\", \"With New Zealand's border closed under Covid-19, the flu had essentially been eliminated here for the past two years.\", \"With its return this winter might be rough, Professor Baker said.\", \"\\\"We should plan on this being a tough winter in terms of respiratory infections because we have not been through a winter yet with Covid-19 circulating widely and obviously combined with influenza, which we haven't had for two years, so - yes it's going to harder and it's going to harder also for our healthcare system.\\\"\", \"Those in the health sector were already stretched and this winter the system could be overwhelmed.\", \"But public health measures people were now used to, like mask-wearing and staying home when sick, combined with vaccination, would help minimise the risk of overwhelming the system, Baker said.\", \"College of General Practitioners medical director Dr Bryan Betty said he was also concerned about what flu season might bring.\", \"\\\"New Zealand, I think, is particularly vulnerable because our borders were so closed we essentially had no flu in the country for the last two seasons. As a result of that we think our natural immunity is down, which means we are far more susceptible to a bad flu season this year than perhaps we normally would be.\\\"\", \"Te K\\u0101ika Covid vaccination centre clinical manager Melanie Solia said they would be encouraging people to get their Covid boosters and to get tamariki up to date with other vaccinations when wh\\u0101nau came in for their flu jabs.\", \"\\\"Obviously our vulnerable populations are our target populations. We're trying to help M\\u0101ori and Pacific Islanders, low-income families - we just do our best to reach out to them and give them the opportunity to make an informed choice.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"ab77f2a2b1e311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ab77f2a2b1e311ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
