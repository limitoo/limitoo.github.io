strikes midnight on December 15 and people from COVID-19 hotspots can enter the state.\\u00a0\", \"South Australia swung open its border to vaccinated travellers on November 23\\u00a0and as of yesterday \\u2014 Wednesday, December 2 \\u2014\\u00a0the state recorded 18\\u00a0new cases of the disease.\\u00a0\", \"Sixteen of the cases are linked to a cluster attributed to a high school reunion in Adelaide's eastern suburbs on Saturday night, with one of the positive cases including former SA premier Jay Weatherill.\", \"Deakin University epidemiologist Catherine Bennett said South Australia was \\\"unlucky\\\" to have a gathering which sparked that number of cases\\u00a0but added \\\"health authorities were on it\\\".\", \"So what does South Australia's reopening and outbreak tell us about what to expect in Tasmania ahead of the island state's opening in 13 days?\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">COVID is coming, be ready</div>\", \"Experts say it's a timely reminder that you can't keep coronavirus out of the community forever.\\u00a0\", \"Professor Bennett said it was \\\"important everyone is ready for this and precautions are in place \\u2026 because the reality is Tasmania will see a COVID case\\\".\\u00a0\", \"Tasmanian modelling\\u00a0has forecast in the first 200 days after reopening there could be around 52,000 cases of infection and 87 COVID-related deaths in Tasmania.\", \"As of December 1, the percentage of eligible Tasmanians aged 16 and over who have received their second dose is 87.8, while 94.2 per cent have had their first dose, according to Australian government data.\", \"The corresponding numbers for South Australia for the same date are 81.6 per cent at their second dose, with 89.8 per cent having had their first.\", \"All travellers entering SA must register via the EntryCheck SA website, prove they have been double-vaccinated\\u00a0and come from a council area with an 80 per cent double-dose rate.\", \"<img

than South Australia, ahead of the island's\\u00a0border opening.\", \"Tasmanian Health Department secretary Kathrine Morgan-Wicks has said with a highly vaccinated population, the \\\"majority of our COVID-positive people will experience low to mild symptoms and will be able to recover at home\\\".\\u00a0\", \"Tasmania's Director of Public Health Mark Veitch said while some states

reunited with all of mainland Australia, Professor Bennett said for some, the anticipation of the disease's arrival may be as exhausting as dealing with any locally acquired COVID-19 cases.\\u00a0\",
