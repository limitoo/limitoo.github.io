As well as drones, the company made aircraft and space vehicles.\", \"Six of the company's managers - three Chinese and three Italian - have been reported to prosecutors for their role in the sale, which estimated 75% of the firm at almost \\u20ac4m (\\u00a33.4m) rather than the \\u20ac45,000 value of the shares at the time.\", \"Lawyers for the company firmly denied that there had been any infringement of Italian law, both on the transfer of strategic, technological assets outside Italy as well as on the \\\"golden power\\\" sale rules.

A military drone was exported to a trade fair in Shanghai in 2019, while being described in Italian customs documents as a radio-controlled model plane, they added.\", \"The Italian firm's lawyers said they were bewildered that the inquiry had been made public and accused tax police of prematurely releasing details in an improper manner.\", \"The drone-maker has already been investigated by tax police on suspicion of violating an arms embargo on selling drones to Iran, Ansa news agency reports.
