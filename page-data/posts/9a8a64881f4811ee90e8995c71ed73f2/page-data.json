from a huge fejoa tree, to salad greens, chillies, apples and mandarins, and plenty of birds.\", \"At times she said she found herself with more fruit and vegetables than she knew what to do with, and thinks she has harvested 100 kilograms from one mandarin tree.\", \"Meanwhile on supermarket shelves, food prices were on the rise.\", \"\\\"I saw a man in the supermarket the other day,\\\" Plug said. \\\"He had a little tray of chillies and a bunch of coriander and some greens, and I felt like saying, 'Do you want to come to my place'?\\\"\", \"Until now, Magic Beans members have been able to connect on Facebook and on the website.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nzhttps://rnz-ressh.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--vwMUcnV5--/ar_16:10,c_fill,f_auto,g_auto,q_auto,w_1050/v1688874881/4L68VYU_Sarah_Grant_co_founder_of_the_Magic_Beans_platform_jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Sarah Grant co-founder of Magic Beans standing in a garden.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nSarah Grant is the co-founder of Magic Beans. \\nPhoto: RNZ / Kate Green\\n</div>\", \"Business co-founder Sarah Grant said the new app would open up the platform to communities all around the country, and eventually, the globe.\", \"It was free to join and use but a subscription version would also give access to a resource library with location-based planting guides and tips, Grant said.\", \"She stressed people did not need have a huge garden or be an expert gardener to join - in fact, many beginners found the community to be a huge help getting their gardens thriving.\", \"It helped people to build a community, share and find information about what grew best in their area, while reducing the distance food travelled from garden to plate, she said.\", \"\\\"One of the things that quite often happens when you do a swap with Magic Beans is that you'll get a spontaneous garden tour, which is fantastic - us gardeners love to look at each others' gardens and get some tips and tricks, and it's quite common that you'll get a cutting or some seeds, as well as what you intended to swap for.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nzhttps://rnz-ressh.cloudinary.com/image/upload/s--UpcSDIsj--/ar_16:10,c_fill,f_auto,g_auto,q_auto,w_1050/v1688874878/4L68TPV_Inside_Clare_and_her_husband_are_propogating_chilli_plants_jpg\\\" alt=\\\"Chili plants sitting on a windowsill.\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nInside, Clare Plug and her husband are propagating chili plants. \\nPhoto: RNZ / Kate Green\\n</div>\", \"During Cyclone Gabrielle, Grant said her community in Dartmoor received food drops from civil defence but most of it was non-perishable.\", \"\\\"We were all very quickly starting to miss our fresh fruits and veggies, so we started raiding each other's gardens to get that -
