Aziz and Khalil Islam, then known as Norman Butler and Thomas Johnson, were lieutenants in the Nation of Islam\\u2019s militia and worked at the Harlem mosque that Malcolm X had led before falling out with the sect\\u2019s leader, Elijah Muhammad.\", \"At the time of the assassination, Mr. Aziz and Mr. Islam were out on bail on charges that they had beaten and shot another defector, Benjamin Brown, who had set up a mosque in the Bronx.\", \"Those charges were later dismissed, but their status as Nation of Islam enforcers led the police to them in the days after Malcolm X\\u2019s assassination. Mr. Aziz, then 30, and Mr. Islam, then 26, were tried and convicted of the murder along with a third man, Talmadge Hayer, who later changed his name to Mujahid Halim.\", \"Mr. Halim confessed to the murder on the witness stand but swore that Mr. Aziz and Mr. Islam were not involved. A jury convicted them anyway on the strength of testimony from several witnesses.\", \"A decade later, Mr. Halim signed affidavits for his co-defendant\\u2019s appeal that identified four Nation of Islam members from New Jersey as his co-conspirators. But a judge dismissed his account and upheld the convictions of Mr. Aziz and Mr. Islam.\", \"Mr. Aziz, who had served in the Navy, spent 20 years in prison before he was released on parole in 1985. Mr. Islam, who was once Malcolm X\\u2019s driver, was released in 1987. Both maintained that they had been framed by the true killers and whoever had ordered the assassination.\", \"\\u201cThey picked the right guy, because even if I felt I was going berserk watching myself get framed, they knew I would never talk, never give anyone up,\\u201d Mr. Islam said in a 2007 profile in New York magazine. \\u201cThat was my mentality: straight up, what I thought was a righteous Muslim. The fact was, I was just the patsy. The perfect patsy.\\u201d\", \"They served their sentences in some of New York\\u2019s most notorious prisons. Mr. Aziz was an imam at Attica before the 1971 riots; Mr. Islam was at Auburn when riots broke out in 1970.\", \"In prison, both men changed their names and converted to a mainstream form of Islam, and Mr. Islam rejected the teachings of the Nation altogether. Mr. Aziz obtained his bachelor\\u2019s and master\\u2019s degrees in religious studies. He worked as chief of security for the Harlem mosque after his release.\", \"On the outside, their personal relationships suffered in ways that outlasted their sentences. Mr. Aziz\\u2019s wife left him, while Mr. Islam asked his wife for a divorce. Their children \\u2014 Mr. Aziz had six and Mr. Islam had three \\u2014 were all younger than 11 when they were arrested and grew up without their fathers present.\", \"\\u201cWhen I left them, the oldest was 5,\\u201d Mr. Aziz said near the end of a recent documentary series, \\u201cWho Killed Malcolm X?\\u201d He added, \\u201cI\\u2019m a father in name, I believe, only, not being there.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Islam had overcome an addiction to heroin after finding a purpose in the Nation of Islam. He maintained until death that he had nothing to do with Malcolm X\\u2019s assassination, though he said he saw it as inevitable.\", \"\\u201cHe was a sitting duck,\\u201d Mr. Islam told New York magazine. \\u201cEveryone\\u2019s got their destiny. He had his, I have mine. Our paths crossed, and we both suffered.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"0c13caa647e411ecb68dedd06570bf48"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"0c13caa647e411ecb68dedd06570bf48"}},
