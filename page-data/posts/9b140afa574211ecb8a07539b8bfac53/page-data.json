The decision to invite foreign dignitaries, Liu said, is at the discretion of each participating country's National Olympic Committee\\u2014in this case, Team USA.\", \"Read that way, Liu would be suggesting that the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee didn't invite President Joe Biden or any of his senior officials, in effect neglecting an active boycott of the Winter Games, which begin in 59 days on February 4, 2022.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1946481/us-boycotts-beijing-2022-winter-olympics.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Carina Vogt of Germany competes in the women's normal hill individual finals during the 2021/2022 FIS Ski Jumping Continental Cup, a test event for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics at the National Ski Jumping Center on December 5, 2021, in Zhangjiakou, Hebei, China.</div>\", \"The Biden administration's diplomatic boycott is considered the U.S.'s only feasible response to widespread reports of human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other minority ethnic groups in northwestern China.

And we simply can't do that,\\\" Psaki added, using the country's official title, the People's Republic of China.\", \"Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said on Tuesday that Beijing had lodged formal diplomatic protests with Washington over its decision. He also warned that China would take \\\"resolute countermeasures,\\\" without elaborating.\", \"Responding to the White House position, China's Mission to the United Nations called the boycott \\\"a self-directed political farce.\\\"\", \"\\\"The success of the Games does not rely on the attendance of a handful of countries' government officials,\\\" it said in a statement on its website. \\\"As for those who say they don't want to come, the answer is that whether you come or not, the Beijing Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games are there, and will be a success.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"9b140afa574211ecb8a07539b8bfac53"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9b140afa574211ecb8a07539b8bfac53"}},
