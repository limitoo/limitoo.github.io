Sometimes they're in a tidal area, so on the next low tide, we can just go out to some of these restored beds, count how many mussels are alive there, how many are dead - sort of just see how well they're doing,\\\" Toone said.\", \"\\\"But for some of our deeper restored reefs, we really have to scuba dive down there.\\\"\", \"So far, five tonnes of mussels have been placed.\", \"Toone and Benjamin would like to see the programme extended beyond its three-year trial (which is set to conclude next year) and would like to see it taken to other parts of the Sounds.\", \"Both said it had been a collaborative project that would not have happened without the local community's support.\", \"\\\"We've had a huge amount of help from the marine farmers that have really made this project possible. They've provided so much in kind support, whether that's the use of their boats or mussels and everything,\\\" Emilee said.\", \"\\\"Literally none of it would be possible without their help.\\\"\", \"Toone said it was the farmers who first brought up the issue, after seeing the decline in wild mussels for many years.\", \"The overall aspiration of the project is to make marine farming regenerative and have marine farmers placing their own surplus mussels into approved areas as part of their regular work.\"]","href_hash":"13d55148674611ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"13d55148674611ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
