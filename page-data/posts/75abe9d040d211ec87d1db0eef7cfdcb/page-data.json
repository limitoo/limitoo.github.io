He claimed that her death was an accident, and that he had fired his gun in the belief that an intruder had entered his upscale home in a Pretoria suburb.\", \"He was convicted of manslaughter \\u2014 later upgraded to murder \\u2014 and sentenced to 15 years. And on Monday, the Department of Correctional Services said Mr. Pistorius, 34, had served half his sentence, making him automatically eligible for parole under South African law.\", \"But first Mr. Pistorius will have to face his victim\\u2019s parents as part of the parole-consideration process \\u2014 a prospect they sounded distressed by on Monday. The parents are \\u201cshocked and surprised\\u201d at having to consider the athlete\\u2019s freedom sooner than they expected, a lawyer for the family said.\", \"At one point, Mr. Pistorius was not deemed eligible for parole until March 2023, but his lawyer asked South Africa\\u2019s Supreme Court of Appeal to take into account the more than 500 days the athlete had already served in prison after his initial conviction for manslaughter.\", \"Mr. Pistorius was at first sentenced to five years in prison on that conviction in 2014, but after prosecutors challenged the verdict, the Supreme Court of Appeal replaced it with a finding of murder. The trial judge raised his sentence to six years, but then prosecutors appealed that, too, describing the penalty as \\u201cshockingly too lenient\\u201d for murder.\", \"In 2017, the Supreme Court of Appeal more than doubled the sentence, to 15 years, the minimum for murder in South Africa.\", \"Prison has \\u201ctaken its toll\\u201d on the celebrity athlete once nicknamed the Blade Runner, said Julian Knight, Mr. Pistorius\\u2019 lawyer. \\u201cWhen Oscar is eventually released on parole, I don\\u2019t think he\\u2019ll be anywhere like the Oscar that went into prison,\\u201d Mr. Knight said.\", \"Mr. Pistorius, whose legs were amputated below the knees when he was an infant, gained worldwide fame by competing at a high level, using carbon fiber prosthetic blades, and won multiple gold medals in Paralympic Games. After a lengthy fight with sporting authorities he won the right to compete against able-bodied athletes and ran in the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, but did not win any medals.\", \"Mr. Pistorius, who has been serving his sentence at the Atteridgeville Correctional Centre in Pretoria, has already attended several rehabilitation programs to prepare for parole, a correctional services department spokesman said.\", \"He will also undergo psychological evaluations and meet with a social worker and religious leader before a mediated \\u201cvictim-offender\\u201d dialogue with his victim\\u2019s parents, June and Barry Steenkamp. Only then will a parole board consider his case.\", \"The Steenkamps are girding themselves to meet with their daughter\\u2019s killer, though they can decline to do so. The authorities have already contacted the family to begin the process.\", \"Ms. Steenkamp has publicly said her Christian faith compels her to forgive Mr. Pistorius. Her husband was described as not having found the same closure.\", \"\\u201cHe\\u2019s always said he wants that meeting, because he\\u2019s got questions,\\u201d said Tania Koen, the Steenkamp\\u2019s\"]","href_hash":"75abe9d040d211ec87d1db0eef7cfdcb"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"75abe9d040d211ec87d1db0eef7cfdcb"}},
