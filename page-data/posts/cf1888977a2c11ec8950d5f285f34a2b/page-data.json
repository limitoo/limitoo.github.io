They are exalting grapes that had been written off and expressions that had been dismissed. Spain offers so much in wine that I find exciting.\", \"Much of the work has been done by a new generation of farmers and producers, people who have been influenced not only by local traditions but by the worldwide wine conversation that has created communities linked by like-minded ideas.\", \"This month we will explore three red wines from producers who are among Spain\\u2019s new wave. As with the orange wines we have been drinking over the last month, these are disparate examples, from different regions of Spain and made with different grapes. Yet I think the wines will show a few traits in common.\", \"One of them is their importer, Jos\\u00e9 Pastor, who has done excellent work bringing producers like these to the United States. He is not the only one doing a great job in Spain \\u2014 De Maison Selections, European Cellars and Selections de la Vi\\u00f1a are three more that immediately come to mind.\", \"I would recommend many of the wines these three import, although they don\\u2019t all fit this new wave category. But coincidentally, these three are brought in by Mr. Pastor. They are:\", \"Env\\u00ednate Ycoden-Daute-Isora Benje Tinto 2020 (Jos\\u00e9 Pastor Selections/Llaurador Wines, Fairfax, Calif.) $29\", \"Goyo Garc\\u00eda Viadero Ribera del Duero Joven de Vi\\u00f1as Viejas 2019 (Jos\\u00e9 Pastor Selections/Llaurador Wines) $30\", \"Laura Lorenzo Daterra Viticultores Camino de la Frontera Vi\\u00f1o Tinto 2019 (Jos\\u00e9 Pastor Selections/Llaurador Wines) $32\", \"Don\\u2019t worry if you can only find a different vintage of these bottles, and by all means, if you see another red cuv\\u00e9e from any of these producers try it. Other producers to consider include Luis Rodriguez, Rub\\u00e9n D\\u00edaz, Comando G, Microbio, Daniel Ramos, Bodegas Ponce and La Perdida, just to name a few.\", \"As I said, these are all from different places. The Env\\u00ednate is from Tenerife in the Canary Islands, the Goyo Garc\\u00eda is from Ribera del Duero in northern Spain and the Laura Lorenzo is from western Spain, near where Portugal meets the southeastern edge of Galicia.\", \"Think of these as fresh reds that will be best served cool.\", \"Follow NYT Food on Twitter and NYT Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube and Pinterest.
