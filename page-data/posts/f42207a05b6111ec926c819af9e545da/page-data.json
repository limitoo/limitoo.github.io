On Tuesday, in a two-hour video call, President Biden himself warned President Vladimir V. Putin of unprecedented and painful economic and other sanctions should Russia move in force into Ukraine and called for de-escalation and diplomacy.\", \"But he has promised Mr. Putin some sort of diplomatic discussion of European security, which has already disturbed some American allies.\", \"Mr. Putin has laid out a set of Russian goals that seem impossible to meet, including a written NATO guarantee withdrawing a 2008 NATO pledge to take Ukraine and Georgia into the alliance at some point in the future (a demand already rejected by Washington), and a promise not to deploy weaponry to countries bordering Russia or hold military drills within a certain distance from Russia.\", \"Sunday\\u2019s warning also included Japan among the countries now condemning Russia\\u2019s military buildup, and it was issued separate from the ministers\\u2019 summary of a host of issues discussed \\u2014 including complicated relations with China and Iran and the ramping up of distribution of the coronavirus vaccine \\u2014 after two days of meetings in Liverpool, in northern England.\", \"\\u201cWhat we have shown this weekend is that the world\\u2019s largest economies are united,\\u201d the British foreign secretary, Liz Truss, told reporters in Liverpool. \\u201cWe have sent a powerful signal to our adversaries and our allies. We have been clear that any incursion by Russia into Ukraine would have massive consequences for which there would be a severe cost.\\u201d\", \"The Group of 7 \\u2014 Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States \\u2014 account for about half of the global economy.
