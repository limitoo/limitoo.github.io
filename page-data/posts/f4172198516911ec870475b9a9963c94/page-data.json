That year would see a record three inter-Korean summits as well as a landmark U.S.-North Korea leaders' summit, which was followed by another summit the following year and a meeting between all three heads of state in summer 2019.\", \"Among the ideas floated at the time was a peace treaty that would once and for all end the Korean War that pitted South Korea, officially the Republic of Korea (ROK), backed by the U.S. and United Nations forces on one side, against North Korea, officially the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), and its Chinese and Soviet allies on the other. Combat lasted from 1950 to 1953 and ended with a stalemate and armistice but no official peace, leaving the belligerents in a technical state of war up that persists to this day.\", \"A senior Biden administration official would not directly comment on the U.S.-South Korea talks, which were also reported on last week by Politico, but did reiterate that the administration continues to pursue peace between the two Koreas.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941678/south-korea-north-reunification-rally-dmz.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Pro-unification activists hold a rally on November 19 urging the South Korean government to connect the inter-Korean railroads, at Imjingak Peace Park in Paju near the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) dividing the two Koreas. The activists are wrapping up their 70-day nationwide march to mark the third anniversary of the Panmunjom declaration between South Korean President Moon Jae-in and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. </div>\", \"The senior administration official would also not \\\"get into hypotheticals\\\" about how such a declaration may be received by North Korea and how it might advance U.S. interests.\", \"But the South Korean Ministry of Unification official provided some evidence as to how the move aligned with the goals of President Moon Jae-in, whose term is set to end in March.\", \"\\\"The ROK Government aims to completely end the 68 years of abnormal ceasefire and pave the way for resuming the stalled denuclearization talks by promoting the end-of-war declaration on the Korean Peninsula,\\\" the South Korean official said.\", \"This official went on to explain how marking an official end to the conflict could serve as a gateway to realizing a broader framework for peace with little cost to the parties involved.\", \"\\\"The end-of-war declaration can be regarded as a door to a peace regime,\\\" the South Korean official added. \\\"It can be a very useful tool with a practical and sensible approach in which the two Koreas and the U.S. can build trust and start a dialogue, without having to charge an immediate expense, undergo abrupt changes in military status, and experience a shift in legal and institutional arrangements.\\\"\", \"Such a move \\\"would also weaken the justification and motivation to create military tensions between South and North Korea including the development of nuclear arms,\\\" according to the South Korean official.\", \"North Korea's development, testing and advancement of nuclear weapons has been a key area of contention with the U.S. and much of the international community, which has placed sanctions on the secretive militarized nation via the United Nations Security Council. Pyongyang paused nuclear and longer-range missile tests ahead of the peace process in 2018 and has yet to resume them, though a number of shorter-range weapons launches have taken place.\", \"While the Trump-era dialogue never panned out, Moon has continued to pursue efforts to reverse the backslide toward tensions with North Korea and restart peace talks. The North-South commitment to ending their war is enshrined in at least two key declarations, one from the first meeting between Moon and North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un in April 2018, and the other from the last inter-Korean summit prior to that, which took place in October 2007.\", \"\\\"Despite North Korea's recent request to stop applying double standards and hostile policy toward the North as prerequisites for the end-of-war declaration, it has also shown positive responses through Kim Yo Jong's statement on September 24, stating President Moon's proposal to declare a formal end to the Korean War is an 'interesting and admirable idea,'\\\" the South Korean official said.\", \"Kim Yo Jong is the sister of Kim Jong Un and serves in the elite position of vice department director of the Central Committee of the ruling Korean Workers' Party. She is also widely seen as having been delegated with the handling of some of the nation's most senior level foreign affairs, including making diplomatic statements regarding South Korea and the U.S. on behalf of her brother.\", \"As such, her openness to Moon's open support for an end-of-war declaration was viewed as a shift in the hardline approach North Korea adopted as its peace process under Trump unraveled. Shortly after her statement, Kim Jong Un announced his intention to restore communication lines between the two countries, a decision that was enacted on October 4.\", \"And while the ruler chastised South Korea during a speech last month at a defense exhibition for conducting joint exercises with the U.S. and arming itself with more advanced weapons of its own, Kim Jong Un also offered an assurance that North Korea's military buildup was not directed at its neighbor.\", \"He even walked back from earlier descriptions of the U.S. as his nation's \\\"principal enemy.\\\"\", \"\\\"Our arch-enemy is the war itself, not south Korea, the United States or any other specific state or forces,\\\" Kim Jong Un said at the time.\", \"He then called for a change in Seoul's perception of Pyongyang, explaining, \\\"all I want is that the authorities and the whole society of south Korea, in their viewpoint towards the north, get rid of their outdated and anachronistic worry and anxiety and illusory sense of mission that the north's threat should be contained, and free themselves from the excessive crisis-consciousness and persecution complex as soon as possible.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1941702/north-korea-kim-meets-south-moon-panmunjom.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un (L) and South Korean President Moon Jae-in (R) raise their jointed hands during a signing ceremony near the end of their historic summit at the truce village of Panmunjom on April 27, 2018.
