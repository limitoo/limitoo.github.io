In her view the legal aid system is already broken and in danger of collapsing if nothing is done to fix it.\", \"There's a triple-whammy of issues.

In some instances there's now a difference of thousands of dollars between the two.\", \"A single person living alone can earn $5,798 more than the legal aid cut off and still be considered in need of a Community Services Card.\", \"Attempts to adjust legal aid thresholds to inflation have been literally half-hearted. The last increase to legal aid eligibility thresholds was 6.5 percent over three years from 2016 - this adjusted them to counter half the cost of inflation since 2008.\", \"So, what happens to those that don't qualify for legal aid? Lawyers fees are beyond the reach of many. The most recent survey conducted by the New Zealand Law Society took place in 2016. It found the average hourly rate for a lawyer working at a law firm was $292.70, add GST and it's more than $330.\", \"In an Official Information Act request RNZ asked how Legal Aid Services figured that a person earning $23,821 per year had sufficient means to engage a lawyer.

Legal Aid can still be granted even if the requestor exceeds the financial eligibility threshold.\\\"\", \"She didn't say how often this happens and RNZ's request for this information was treated as another Official Information Act request, with a wait time of up to 20 working days.\", \"Rules around legal aid were tightened around 2013 to stamp down the rising cost of providing the service. Eligibility criteria were tightened, interest was added to legal aid loan debt and a $50 user charge was introduced.\", \"Legal aid eligibility settings are meant to be reviewed every three years and recommendations for change given to the Minister of Justice. Decisions to change eligibility thresholds are the responsibility of the Minister.\", \"The 2018 review highlighted eligibility thresholds hadn't kept pace with inflation, but no changes were made.\", \"This year's scheduled review of legal aid has been cancelled.\", \"Minister of Justice Kris Faafoi says he chose to cancel it because he didn't think another review would add any new information.\", \"\\\"Significant additional funding is required to address the issues identified during the 2018 review, including making any adjustments to key legal aid settings (eg, eligibility and repayment).

She focuses on taking cases which have a collective element to them, in the hope of improving systemic issues.\", \"Most weeks she turns away around four requests for help because she's overworked.\", \"She believes the legal system needs many fixes but also thinks more lawyers should take on pro bono work, pointing out that in some countries \\\"you have to do pro bono or legal aid work every year just to get your ticket.\\\".\", \"Lawyers are encouraged to do pro bono work in New Zealand, but it's not mandatory. There has been talk of setting an aspirational target of 35 hours a year of pro bono work.\", \"Darryn Aitchison is the director of Te Ara Ture.
