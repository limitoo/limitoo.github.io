We are proposing a prohibition on all Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft. These aircraft will no more be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU.\\\"\", \"She said also the EU will ban \\\"the Kremlin's media machine. The state-owned Russia Today and Sputnik, as well as their subsidiaries, will no longer be able to spread their lies to justify Putin's war and to sow division in our union.\\\"\", \"Von der Leyen added that the EU will target Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko for supporting Russia's widespread military campaign in Ukraine.\", \"\\\"We will hit Lukashenko's regime with a new package of sanctions,\\\" she said.\", \"First, we are shutting down the EU airspace for Russian-owned, Russian registered or Russian-controlled aircraft.\\u00a0They won\\u2019t be able to land in, take off or overfly the territory of the EU.\\u00a0Including the private jets of oligarchs. pic.twitter.com/o551M9zekQ\", \"The announcement came after Germany said Sunday it was committing 100 billion euros, or about $113 billion, to a special armed forces fund and would keep its defense spending above 2% of GDP from now on, a move brought on by Russia's invasion.\", \"The announcement, which came hours before Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered Russian nuclear forces put on alert, underscored how Russia's war on Ukraine was rewriting Europe's post-World War II security policy in ways that were unthinkable only a few weeks ago.\", \"Anti-war protesters, meanwhile, took to the streets in Berlin, Rome, Prague, Istanbul and other cities \\u2014 even Russian cities like Moscow and St. Petersburg \\u2014 to demand an end to the war, the largest ground offensive on the continent since WWII.\", \"Tens of thousands of people massed Sunday in front of Berlin's Brandenburg Gate, with some carrying posters with slogans such as \\\"Hands off Ukraine,\\\" \\\"Tanks to Windmills\\\" and \\\"Putin, go to therapy and leave Ukraine and the world in peace.\\\"\", \"German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's announcement of new defense funding is significant for Germany, which has come under criticism from the United States and other NATO allies for not investing adequately in its defense budget. NATO member states committed to spending 2% of their GDP on defense, but Germany has consistently spent much less.\", \"\\\"It's clear we need to invest significantly more in the security of our country, in order to protect our freedom and our democracy,\\\" Scholz told a special session of the Bundestag in Berlin.\", \"Scholz said the 100 billion euro fund was currently a one-time measure for 2022. It wasn't immediately clear whether similar funding would be allocated in future years. But Scholz indicated Germany will exceed the 2% of GDP threshold going forward, signaling an overall future increase in defense spending.\"]","href_hash":"431a126097f011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"431a126097f011ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
