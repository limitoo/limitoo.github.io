Frontier's offer in cash and stock was worth $2.9  billion when it was announced, but Frontier shares have fallen since  then, reducing the value to Spirit shareholders.\", \"Shares of Florida-based Spirit soared 22% after The New York Times first reported the JetBlue bid Tuesday.\", \"A Frontier-Spirit tie-up would combine Frontier's route map in the  western United States with Spirit's network along the East Coast and the  Caribbean. Both are discount airlines that offer rock-bottom fares and  make up some of the difference by charging extra for many things that  bigger airlines include in the ticket price, including carry-on bags and  soft drinks.\", \"JetBlue is not the same kind of ultra-low-cost-carrier.  Moreover, Frontier and Spirit are small enough that their deal might not  get close scrutiny from antitrust regulators. Those same regulators  already weighed in last year to block a much more limited partnership  between JetBlue and American Airlines, arguing that such a deal would raise fares for passengers.\"]","href_hash":"fc0612ccb52511ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"fc0612ccb52511ecbbfac387ddae3c7c"}},
