capacity to know that she ought not do\\u00a0what she did.\", \"One of the psychiatrists, Viki Pascu, testified this morning that while Ms Djurasovic did know what she was doing, she did it\\u00a0because \\\"she knew she had to end the torment for her children and for herself\\\".\", \"\\\"In her reality, those actions were very well justified,\\\" Dr Pascu said.\", \"The court has
