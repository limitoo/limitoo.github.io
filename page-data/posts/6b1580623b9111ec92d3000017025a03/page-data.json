campsite, and they believe an opportunistic abductor snatched her.\", \"Acting Police Commissioner Col Blanch told ABC Radio police were \\\"getting closer and closer\\\".\", \"\\\"And we've tracked down people that we didn't know, we've found them and we have eliminated them, and that's our focus at the moment \\u2014 eliminate as many people as possible.\\\"\", \"Four-year-old Cleo vanished from her family's tent at the Blowholes campsite, about 80 kilometres north of Carnarvon, in the early hours of October 16.\", \"She was not in the tent when her parents awoke at 6:30am, nor was her sleeping bag,\\u00a0and the tent's zipper had been undone to a height the little girl could not have reached.\", \"Lead investigator Superintendent Rode Wilde told Nine Radio\\u00a0police had interviewed more than 110 people who were at the Blowholes campsite that night and believed there were only a \\\"small handful\\\" of people they had not yet tracked down.\", \"\\\"I think it's more than likely an opportunistic type event,\\\" he said.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Police look for ground disturbance</div>\", \"Col Blanch said the forensic work on the ground\\u00a0involved creating a detailed map of every inch of the area, using drones, aircraft, and satellite technology to look for any disturbances in sand and other potential evidence.\", \"\\\"Now we're in a stage where we need to forensically go over that ground inch by inch to see what disturbances might be in nearby areas for any sort of evidence which might give an inkling as to what happened,\\\" Acting Commissioner Blanch said.\", \"\\\"It could be tyre tracks, it could be the sleeping bag, it could be anything.\\\"\", \"He said police were in process of securing\\u00a0satellite images captured over the area around that time, and\\u00a0were trawling through thousands of lines of data captured by mobile towers in the area.\", \"<img

campground\\u00a0north of Carnarvon on October 16.(ABC News: James Carmody)</div>\", \"\\\"It is an investigative function for police to find out who was in the area at the time and perhaps the direction of movement \\u2014 so what tower they started connecting to as they moved off.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Alternate escape routes investigated</div>\", \"While there has been focus placed on a mystery car seen turning off the Blowholes Road towards Carnarvon about 3:30am the morning Cleo Smith disappeared, other roads were also being investigated.\", \"Acting Commissioner Col Blanch said there were many dirt roads and other routes which could have allowed an abductor to avoid detection.\", \"\\\"The Quobba Blowholes is a very remote area, you would need vehicles that are capable of doing that, you would be looking for a four-wheel-drive type vehicle,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"But absolutely there are ways to go that aren't on the main road.\\\"\", \"While police believe it is likely to have been an opportunistic abduction, Col Blanch said they were yet to rule out the possibility Cleo had been watched or followed at the campsite or even earlier.\", \"\\\"One of the most important things in an investigation like this is to eliminate everyone that was present at the campsite,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"We need to know everyone who was there, and then we work out their movements, what they were doing, we take their DNA, their fingerprints, and that's all for elimination.\\\"\", \"\\\"We are left with a group of people that we would put more focus on.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Hard to keep up hope: police</div>\", \"The Acting Commissioner conceded that as time went on, keeping hopes high was not easy.\", \"\\\"It is difficult to keep the hope up, there is no doubt about it, the longer it goes, but I know those investigators are still focused absolutely on this case trying to bring Cleo home,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"This has absolutely hit the heart of everyone in Western Australia, the Australian community, it's gone international.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/5d6114627c119dc5e6e834673f53c8f0\\\"

also shed\\u00a0light on the make-up of the 100-officer Taskforce Rodia which is investigating Cleo's disappearance.\", \"\\\"We have nearly 50 officers up in Carnarvon, up at the Blowholes, working every day, and we have another 50 down in Perth,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"And that ranges from detectives to analysts, forensic specialists, we're going to send the TRG up there to have a closer look and do some line searches, we've got drone pilots, we've got Airwing.\", \"\\\"We basically have most of the police force specialist services and detectives working on it.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"6b1580623b9111ec92d3000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"6b1580623b9111ec92d3000017025a03"}},
