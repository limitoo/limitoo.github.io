It\\u2019s a pleasure to greet you this Friday after Thanksgiving, at the dawn of cozy season, here in the dwindling days of the year. I usually write to Times readers via the At Home and Away newsletter, where, for months, I\\u2019ve been contemplating ways we can lead a full and cultured life during the pandemic.\", \"I started working with a group of Times journalists in the early days of lockdown, endeavoring to assemble ideas and inspiration to help you navigate a world abruptly changed in almost every way. Twice a week, I gather recommendations from my colleagues and from readers for passing the time richly, wherever you are. Today, I\\u2019m here to offer some suggestions for how to spend your postprandial weekend.\", \"The day after Thanksgiving is one of those in-between days that the holiday season bestows on us: a day off from work for many, but not the actual big day. It\\u2019s a choose-your-own-adventure day, whether your particular adventure consists of Black Friday shopping (perhaps this plant-based gift guide will inspire you?), curling up with one of our 100 Notable Books of 2021, venturing out to see Paul Thomas Anderson\\u2019s new movie, \\u201cLicorice Pizza,\\u201d or doing something else.\", \"I\\u2019m a fan of a post-Thanksgiving quasi hibernation in slippers and sweats, orbiting the kitchen, where leftovers beckon. It\\u2019s the ideal weekend for streaming something you\\u2019ve been meaning to catch. (The final season of \\u201cInsecure\\u201d? Rebecca Hall\\u2019s directorial debut, \\u201cPassing\\u201d? \\u201cCowboy Bebop\\u201d \\u2014 either the original anime series or the new live-action version?) But if you\\u2019ve had your fill of the hunker-down life, I hear you, and encourage you to be safely out and about. We indoor cats will mind the hearth until your return.\", \"Holidays, in the Norman Rockwell version, are rosy-cheeked, hugs-all-around affairs. That\\u2019s not, of course, always the reality. If this weekend for you brings the welcome emptying of a too-full house, if it\\u2019s the first time you\\u2019ve unclenched your jaw in a week or if you\\u2019re just feeling out of sorts after yet another confusing year, you\\u2019re not alone. My friends and family have taken to using the vague yet all-encompassing phrase \\u201cit\\u2019s a lot\\u201d to describe how we\\u2019ve been feeling lately. It explains what\\u2019s happening without going into detail; it\\u2019s nonspecific but legible to, well, everyone.\", \"However you spend this weekend, I hope that you\\u2019re safe and warm, that you\\u2019re able to relax a bit, and that you get to connect and catch up with people you love. I hope you have leftovers (more on that below from my colleague Sanam Yar), and if you\\u2019re traveling, I hope your trip is headache-free. Thanks for making room for me at your table.\", \"As virtual worlds grow, we need to nurture our sense of touch, JoAnna Novak argues in The Times. \\u201cI, for one, will not go gentle into the metaverse.\\u201d\", \"Black Friday: This is what shopping looked like over the past 80 years. (And The Times will cover what it looks like today).\", \"College life: Turkeys are taking over campuses.\", \"The expert: Meet the go-to guy for repairs in a nation that reveres the accordion.\", \"Vintage: How a Y2K-era Versace dress made a comeback.\", \"Lives Lived: Inspired by double Dutch jump rope moves she saw growing up in Brooklyn in the 1950s, Kariamu Welsh developed an influential dance technique based on archetypes found in African art. She died at 72.\", \"If you\\u2019re lucky enough to have a mountain of Thanksgiving leftovers, a world of possibilities awaits beyond your standard turkey sandwich. (Though if you still want one, make it an Elena Ruz sandwich \\u2014 a sweet-savory concoction named for the Cuban socialite who invented it.)\", \"Perhaps you\\u2019d like a leftovers enchilada pie, which may sound a little offbeat but is easy to make and delicious. Turkey also lends itself well to tweaked versions of tikka masala, mole verde or pho, courtesy of Samin Nosrat. As for other sandwiches, Melissa Clark recommends turkey cubanos or healthy-ish pitas.\", \"If you have stuffing \\u2014 the holiday\\u2019s best side \\u2014 Sohla El-Waylly shows you how to make three clever upgrades in this video. \\u201cAnything bread can do, stuffing can do better,\\u201d she says, \\u201cand this is especially true of dumpling soup.\\u201d Who knew eggs, flour and leftover stuffing could make such a tender dumpling dough?\", \"Find more leftovers recipe inspiration. \\u2014 Sanam Yar, a Morning writer\", \"Kale soup with potatoes and sausage is comforting and comes together quickly.\", \"Disney\\u2019s new film, \\u201cEncanto,\\u201d about a magical house and the gifted family that resides in it, is \\u201cquietly extraordinary,\\u201d Maya Phillips writes.\", \"Times editors recommend eight new books to be thankful for.\", \"What is Ssense and how did it become the destination for young consumers?\", \"How well did you follow the headlines this week?\", \"The pangram from yesterday\\u2019s Spelling Bee was phenomena.
