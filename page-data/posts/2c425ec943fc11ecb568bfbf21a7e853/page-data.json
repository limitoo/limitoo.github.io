AP reported that when someone is in a mental health crisis and seeks help at a hospital's emergency room, it could take days to even months for them to be admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit. During the waiting period, the patient usually receives no mental health care.\", \"Through this bill, every hospital emergency room would have a behavioral health professional. Also, it would create an online portal where health care providers could search for open beds in psychiatric units.\", \"The bill also aims to streamline many processes involved in getting care, including making sure insurance companies approve mental health treatment, mental health professionals are sufficiently reimbursed and more.\", \"For more reporting from the Associated Press, see below.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931737/massachusetts-karen-spilka.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Massachusetts residents would be eligible for annual mental health wellness exams, akin to annual physical exams, at no cost under a sweeping mental health bill expected to be debated by the state Senate during their legislative session beginning on November 15.
