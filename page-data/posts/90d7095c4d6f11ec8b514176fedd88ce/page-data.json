(Basic, 560 pp., $19.99.) In this 2014 book, updated with a new epilogue for the paperback, Richardson looks back over a century and a half to chart \\u201cthe twists and permutations as Republicans of many eras waged their internecine battles,\\u201d our reviewer, Jonathan Rauch, noted.\", \"NOBODY EVER ASKED ME ABOUT THE GIRLS: Women, Music and Fame, by Lisa Robinson. (Picador, 272 pp., $17.) Drawing from decades of interviews with stars like Tina Turner, Stevie Nicks and Rihanna, Robinson\\u2019s oral history highlights sexism in the music industry and those who perpetuate it. \\u201cAcerbic and authoritative,\\u201d as our reviewer, Lauretta Charlton, put it, \\u201cthe book is best read as a cautionary tale for women tempted by show business.\\u201d\", \"NIGHTS WHEN NOTHING HAPPENED, by Simon Han. (Riverhead, 272 pp., $17.) This debut novel follows a Chinese immigrant family living in Plano, Texas, and is told through shifting perspectives in a voice that, according to Thessaly La Force, who reviewed the book for us, \\u201cembodies the monotony of feeling out of place, of realizing that life continues to roll forward, even if all you experience is inertia.\\u201d\", \"KRAFT, by Jonas L\\u00fcscher, translated from the German by Tess Lewis. (Picador, 224 pp., $17.) \\u201cFraudulence, in Jonas L\\u00fcscher\\u2019s world, is a universal,\\u201d Rob Doyle observed in our pages. In this book, a German professor stuck in a crumbling marriage and a mountain of debt enters a million-dollar contest where he must compose a stirring lecture arguing why the current world is still, despite all evidence, the best of all possible worlds.\", \"YOU LOVE ME, by Caroline Kepnes. (Random House, 432 pp., $17.) \\u201cCaroline Kepnes must be some kind of storytelling sorcerer,\\u201d Sarah Weinman wrote in her review. Kepnes\\u2019s absorbing narrator, Joe Goldberg, the multiple murderer who demonstrates \\u201cthe shattered barrier between id and superego,\\u201d is back for a third book.\", \"AMERICA AND IRAN: A History, 1720 to the Present, by John Ghazvinian. (Vintage, 688 pp., $18.) \\u201cUntangling facts from fictions, platitudes of ideology from the realities of politics (or policies), in the 300-year history of United States-Iran relations is an enormous task,\\u201d Abbas Milani, our reviewer, commented. Ghazvinanian\\u2019s attempt is \\u201cextensive and wide-ranging,\\u201d but it is also \\u201cdelightfully readable, genuinely informative and impressively literate.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"90d7095c4d6f11ec8b514176fedd88ce"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"90d7095c4d6f11ec8b514176fedd88ce"}},
