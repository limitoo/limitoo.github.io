The release of the period drama \\u201cBridgerton\\u201d on Netflix last Christmas led to the replacement of the pastoral nap dresses and cardigans of #Cottagecore with what TikTok fashionistas coined #Regencycore: the rise of 18th- and 19th-century-inspired regalia, including corseted silhouettes.\", \"But the corsets of late aren\\u2019t necessarily the dated, binding products of the past. Now they\\u2019re more malleable and come in a range of shapes, sizes and fabrics without being torturous to wear. This time around, there\\u2019s a lot more room to breathe.\", \"The corset has a divisive past of toeing the line between sexuality and oppression. Worn until the early 20th century, it was eventually replaced by girdles, and then more or less by diet, exercise and plastic surgery. During the punk movement, the garments re-emerged \\u201cas part of an appropriation of scandalous aspects of clothing history,\\u201d Dr. Steele said.\", \"\\u201cIt was sort of taken out of pornographic imagery and brought back onto the street,\\u201d she said. \\u201cSo girls started wearing corsets, girdles and brassieres over their clothes, and this then led to the trend for underwear as outerwear.\\u201d\", \"Part of the top\\u2019s recent appeal may also have to do with the current trend in pants. Kristen Classi-Zummo, a fashion apparel industry analyst for The NPD Group, believes the combination of growth in \\u201chigher rises and looser fits\\u201d in women\\u2019s pants is responsible for bringing corsets back to the closet.\", \"\\u201cThis baggy-bottom trend has a halo effect on the kind of tops she\\u2019s wearing, opening up the opportunity for cropped tops and corsets,\\u201d Ms. Classi-Zummo said over email, adding that corsets \\u201cadd a polished look\\u201d to sweats or straight leg jeans.\", \"The trend has also been magnified thanks to celebrities and the welcome return of the red carpet. Among the corset\\u2019s fans is the singer Olivia Rodrigo, whose style around the release of her breakout debut \\u201cSour\\u201d reflected its \\u201990s-era grunge aesthetic; she has been seen in quite a few lace bustiers and tartan corsets with Dr. Martens boots.\", \"Chloe and Chenelle Delgadillo, stylists who have worked with Ms. Rodrigo, said over email that they chose \\u201ca purple plaid Vivienne Westwood corset and matching pants for the \\u2018good 4 u\\u2019 performance on \\u2018SNL,\\u2019 which was perfect for the occasion \\u2019cause it was both feminine and punk.\\u201d\", \"Billie Eilish, who has long worn oversized clothing to avoid body shaming, drew a lot of attention for donning a satin Alexander McQueen corset dress on the cover of British Vogue earlier this year.\", \"The rapper Saweetie also frequently wears bustier bodysuits and vintage underpinnings \\u2060\\u2014 even starting a collaboration with PrettyLittleThing, a retailer in Britain, with corsets as its focal point. And the corset has also been a recent mainstay of Lizzo\\u2019s wardrobe, including a meta one she wore with her face superimposed on the Mona Lisa. \", \"Miaou, a \\u201cretro-romantic\\u201d ready-to-wear brand that debuted in 2016, pays homage to \\u201990s glamour and a midcentury French bombshell aesthetic. Its corsets \\u2060\\u2014 like the popular, fully boned Leia, which comes in a range of colorways including cow print and vegan leather \\u2060\\u2014 have become the best-selling category, generating 60 percent of the label\\u2019s revenue this year, according to the brand. Celebrities like Megan Fox and Kacey Musgraves have worn them.\", \"Alexia Elkaim, the founder and designer of Miaou, believes that the corset is appealing to the masses because it\\u2019s less costume-y and has more wearability than it did in the past. The corset gives every body \\u201ca shape that is meant to be this curvy hourglass,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s flattering on all body types.\\u201d\", \"Athleisure-inspired corsets are also now in high demand. Mia Vesper\\u2019s namesake brand, which produces playful, ready-to-wear pieces, has taken a \\u201csporty\\u201d approach to corsets with \\u201ctiny tops\\u201d \\u2014 non-stretch pieces that are reminiscent of a sports bra and come in styles like faux crocodile and neon shimmer. Since their debut in April, the label has sold over 1,500 of these tops, according to the company, making them one of its best sellers.\", \"Ms. Vesper believes that \\u201covert anti-utilitarianism\\u201d is appealing right now and people are looking to bend the rules of fashion more with these types of pieces. \\u201cIt\\u2019s low-stakes cosplay for people,\\u201d Ms. Vesper said of corsets. \\u201cIt gives a little taste of theater and romanticism at a time when life feels almost oppressively real.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"e2aa6f125dcd11ec87d345d49f11332b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e2aa6f125dcd11ec87d345d49f11332b"}},
