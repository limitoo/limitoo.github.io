Last Friday, the Biden administration announced that it would impose travel restrictions from South Africa and seven other nations after the Omicron variant was discovered in the country.\", \"The restrictions also apply to travelers coming from Botswana, Eswatini, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe. U.S. citizens are not being held to the ban, but they must show proof of a negative COVID-19 test if they are traveling from these countries.\", \"Much about the Omicron variant is still unknown to scientists, but some have warned that it may be more resistant to COVID-19 vaccines. It is not known if it causes more serious illness than other variants. The variant has a large number of mutations, which scientists have raised concern about.\", \"So far, the United States has not detected any cases of the variant, but during a COVID-19 briefing Monday, President Joe Biden said it is \\\"almost inevitable\\\" that it would arrive.\", \"The variant has been detected in several countries in all nearly all parts of the world.
