high vaccination coverage ahead of the virus entering the state gives the best protection against large outbreaks and severe disease, says one expert.","country":"au","create_time":"2021-12-16T13:58:51.000Z","content":"[\"After almost two years of border restrictions, Tasmania opened to fully vaccinated travellers on Wednesday \\u2014 including one man in his 20s who tested positive for COVID-19 that night.\", \"Premier Peter Gutwein\\u00a0said it was \\\"understandable\\\" that some people would be concerned about the case, but an epidemiologist said Tasmania's high vaccination coverage ahead of the virus entering the state gave\\u00a0the best protection against large outbreaks and severe disease.\", \"Epidemiologist Catherine Bennett of Deakin University said Tasmania had\\u00a0a much lower risk of large outbreaks compared to states that were hit before vaccination was widespread.\", \"\\\"That's a big difference \\u2014 we had to really speed [vaccination] up in New South Wales, Victoria and the ACT in that last-ditch effort to really bring Delta under control, and Delta did have a bigger impact on serious illness as well,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"You do have more chance to see more cases of Omicron when that crosses the border, but Omicron infections are less likely to cause that serious illness.\\\"\", \"She said the border opening signalled a shift from keeping the virus out\\u00a0to keeping it in check.\", \"\\\"It's moving from fear and isolation, which is where a lot of Tasmania's been, to now moving into that control period where we are just learning to control the virus as it does cross the border,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"People will bring the virus in\\u00a0and it will become part of the response from the health department to identify whether they're seeing the low rates [of transmission] they usually expect or whether it might be something they follow up because they have something like we saw in Newcastle with a spreader event.\\\"\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">High vaccination rate 'number one protection' for the health system</div>\", \"Tasmanian health workers have previously expressed concern over\\u00a0how the already stretched health system would cope once the virus began circulating in the community.\", \"But Professor Bennett said the high vaccination rate was \\\"the number one protection\\\" against an onslaught.\", \"\\\"We don't want people to get infected, but it's not the same concern that it was a year and a half ago with the original strains\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0and in the last six months with Delta\\u00a0\\u2014\\u00a0where we had those higher hospitalisation rates,\\\" she said.\", \"She also said it was important for anyone eligible for their booster to have it as soon as possible.\", \"\\\"That will mean even Omicron won't have such a good foothold when it inevitably crosses the border.\\\"\", \"Boosters will also help to protect those who cannot be vaccinated for medical reasons.\", \"\\\"The first people who would have been vaccinated are those with comorbidities and the elderly \\u2026 if [these] people have a booster, that preserves the ICU beds for people who need it for other reasons, which is important when you don't have an unlimited supply of intensive care beds,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"If you're particularly vulnerable and you get [frequent] symptoms, say you get hay fever and you're not sure if it is something else, you might consider having a rapid antigen test or two at home.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/0079ce8d1acc2295f65075ae7f7050fa\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\"> Epidemiologist Catherine Bennett says it's important for people to get their booster shots.</div>\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">Managing anxiety</div>\", \"Tasmanian clinical and health psychologist Sabina Lane said she had\\u00a0many clients with multiple medical issues, and for some, being vaccinated has helped reduce anxiety.\", \"\\\"It's been helpful for them to feel that by having the vaccine, they're not going to suffer to the same degree should they catch it,\\\" she said.\", \"But others, including people with cancer or multiple sclerosis, will be spending more time at home.\", \"\\\"Some are going to remain at home a little more, which is sad because they're looking forward to Tassie's summer, to those times of being more sociable and more festivities.\", \"\\\"For those people, feeling that they're not able to get around as much is tough.\\\"\", \"Ms Lane said everyone should feel comfortable to make decisions on how much socialising they wanted to engage in.\", \"\\\"Deciding whether we want to participate in the things that are available\\u00a0or whether we want to have a quiet summer at home with just a couple of friends is an individual choice,\\\" she said.\", \"But she encouraged people to avoid comparing the situation with that of other areas.\", \"\\\"It's very easy to look at what's happening elsewhere in Australia, and even the world, and assume that things will happen a certain way \\u2026 but it's very easy when people become anxious to catastrophise,\\\" she said.\", \"Ms Lane suggested people feeling anxious about socialising might call a friend to discuss it, or to see their GP if they felt it was interfering with their daily life.\"]","href_hash":"50e8b2165ebb11eca1c197932d42fb46"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"50e8b2165ebb11eca1c197932d42fb46"}},
