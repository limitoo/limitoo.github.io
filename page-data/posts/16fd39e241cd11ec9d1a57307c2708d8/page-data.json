I was awed by the energy of all the youth on the streets demanding that we rise to the challenge of global warming and by some of the amazing new technological and market fixes being proposed by innovators and investors. This was not the old days \\u2014 everyone waiting for the deals cut by the priesthood of climate diplomats huddled behind closed doors. This was the many talking to the many \\u2014 and I am buoyed by that.\", \"But for me, there was one question that hovered over every promise coming out of this summit: When you see how hard it\\u2019s been for governments to get their citizens to just put on a mask in stores, or to get vaccinated, to protect themselves, their neighbors and their grandparents from being harmed or killed by Covid-19, how in the world are we going to get big majorities to work together globally and make the lifestyle sacrifices needed to dampen the increasingly destructive effects of global warming \\u2014 for which there are treatments but no vaccine? That\\u2019s magical thinking, and it demands a realistic response.\", \"Here\\u2019s my reporter\\u2019s notebook that produced those conflicting emotions:\", \"For the first time, it felt to me that the adult delegates inside the conference halls were more afraid of the kids outside than they were of one another or the press.\", \"Clearly, the internet and social media are super-empowering young people, who daily are manifesting that power in Glasgow to call out the adult negotiators \\u2014 who clearly don\\u2019t want to be flamed, blamed or shamed as \\u201cblah leaders,\\u201d or \\u201cbleaders,\\u201d who just \\u201cblah, blah, blah,\\u201d as wall posters slapped around Glasgow suggest. I was warned before a panel I was on that if any young protesters disrupted the session, simply let them have their say.\", \"Gen Z \\u2014 all those who were born between 1997 and 2012 and grew up as digital natives \\u2014 is now the world\\u2019s largest population cohort, 2.5 billion strong, and their presence is palpable at the summit.\", \"They know that later is over, that later will be too late and that sticking to our business-as-usual trajectory could heat up the planet by the end of the century to levels no Homo sapiens have ever lived in.\", \"One day last week, Greta Thunberg, the 18-year-old Swedish climate activist, and hundreds of other youth gathered at a Glasgow park for a snap rally to call out global leaders with the chant, \\u201cYou can shove your climate crisis up your. \\u2026\\u201d\", \"I watched the video and couldn\\u2019t make out the last word. Must have been \\u201cglass.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThese young people don\\u2019t just want to purchase your products or vote for you. They want to take action with you,\\u201d argued Molly Voss Fannon, C.E.O. of the Museum for the United Nations \\u2014 UN Live, an independent organization that works to help people all over the world discover and flex their own power. \\u201cMy oldest daughter, who is only 10, is the person who got me to become a vegetarian. My middle daughter recently ran for student council at her school on the platform of: \\u2018Vote for me because I can talk my parents into anything.\\u2019 With her, it\\u2019s like raising Al Capone with a heart of gold.\\u201d\", \"Good news, Gen Zers: You won the debate on climate change. And thanks for that. Both governments and business are now saying: \\u201cWe get it. We\\u2019re on it.\\u201d The bad news: There is still a huge gap between what scientists say is needed by way of immediately reducing use of the coal, oil and gas that drive global warming and what governments and business \\u2014 and, yes, average citizens \\u2014 are ready to do if it comes to a choice of heat or eat.\", \"As energy experts point out, it is never a good idea to take off your belt until your suspenders are on tight. Governments will not quit dirty fossil fuels until there is sufficient clean energy to replace them. And that will take longer or require much greater sacrifices than are being discussed in any depth at the summit.\", \"Read this from CNBC\\u2019s website on Nov. 3 and weep: \\u201cThe global supply of renewables will grow by 35 gigawatts from 2021 to 2022, but global power demand growth will go up by 100 gigawatts over the same period. \\u2026 Countries will have to tap traditional fuel sources to meet the rest of the demand. \\u2026 That shortfall will only widen as economies reopen and travel resumes,\\u201d which will spark \\u201csharp rises in prices for natural gas, coal and electricity.\\u201d\", \"We need to stop deluding ourselves that we can have it all \\u2014 that we can do foolish things like close down nuclear plants in Germany that provided massive amounts of clean energy, just to show how green we are, and then ignore the fact that without sufficient renewables in place, Germany is now back to burning more of the dirtiest coal. This moral preening is really counterproductive.\", \"Energy is a scale problem. It requires a TRANSITION, and that means a transition from fossil fuels to cleaner fuels \\u2014 like natural gas or nuclear \\u2014 to wind and solar and, eventually, sources that don\\u2019t today even exist. Those who propose ignoring that transition risk producing a huge backlash against the whole green movement this winter if people can\\u2019t heat their homes or run their factories.\", \"No, but now would be a good time to start praying. Pray that technology plus artificial intelligence can close that gap between what today\\u2019s Homo sapiens are actually willing to do to mitigate climate change and what is actually needed. And pray that Homo sapiens start to understand that preserving our future almost certainly will require some pain. Because right now, without sacrifice, our only hope is to design and deploy technologies that allow ordinary people to do extraordinary things at scale.\", \"My first day in Glasgow I was walking into the New York Times media hub when I passed a gray-haired security staffer explaining to her much younger colleague what this conference was all about. She said in a thick Scottish accent, \\u201cThere was this guy, Al Gore, and he predicted all of this before anyone.\\u201d\", \"You know you\\u2019re old when a young person at a climate summit has no idea who Al Gore is.\", \"Happily, Gore is still seeing around corners. We had a few minutes to chat in a hallway and he spent most of it telling me with great excitement about a data science project he was backing \\u2014 Climate TRACE, which uses sensory data from satellites and artificial intelligence to do real-time monitoring of CO\\u2082 emissions, especially those that never get reported by governments and business.\", \"With 24/7 satellite coverage provided by the start-up Planet, whose hundreds of tiny satellites image the earth\\u2019s land mass every day in high resolution, we will be able to watch a logging truck go into the Amazon rainforest and cut a road and then count each tree chopped down. Or, conversely, we\\u2019ll be able to count trees that are planted and put a price on the carbon that each one is saving \\u2014 instead of just a price on the lumber taken from the forest.\", \"\\u201cThe era of radical climate transparency is about to be born,\\u201d said Andrew Zolli, Planet\\u2019s chief impact officer. Everyone \\u2014 your customers, your competitors, your employees and activists \\u2014 will soon know exactly what you are emitting with one click. That is a big deal.\", \"\\u201cYou can have a scale impact on the climate when you can measure, monitor, manage and monetize the value of saving a forest or a watershed,\\u201d said Andy Karsner, who was the principal U.S. climate negotiator in Bali in 2007 and whose Elemental Labs is now building more tech tools for market-based solutions for climate change.\", \"\\u201cWe humans don\\u2019t have big claws or razor-sharp teeth to survive,\\u201d Karsner told me. \\u201cInstead, we were endowed with large brains, and I still believe the enlightened self-interest of our species will drive us to come together and use our collective brains to develop and deploy the tools\\u201d we need to thrive on this planet.\", \"Yes! Plant a tree \\u2014 or prevent one from being chopped down \\u2014 by supporting Indigenous communities, whose territories contain 50 percent of all the world\\u2019s remaining forests and 80 percent of the healthiest functioning ecosystems, according to Peter Seligmann, a co-founder of Nia Tero, an organization recently started \\u201cto ensure that Indigenous peoples have the economic power and cultural independence to steward, support and protect their livelihoods and territories they call home\\u201d \\u2014 which also happen to be home to some of earth\\u2019s greatest biodiversity treasures.\", \"Seligmann (a donor to my wife\\u2019s language museum) introduced me to Teofilo Kukush, chief of the Wampis Nation, an Indigenous people, some 15,300 strong, who have been living for multiple generations on their own territory \\u2014 1,327,760 hectares (5,126 square miles) of mostly forest and watersheds, in the northern Peruvian Amazon. (When I wrote down on my notepad \\u201c1,327,000\\u201d hectares for short, Kukush pointed to the imprecision of my number and insisted that I write down the last 760 hectares.)\", \"And no wonder. Speaking in Spanish and Wampis, his Indigenous language, through a translator, Kukush explained that every year their still largely intact forested region \\u2014 with which they live in harmony, using rotating agriculture \\u2014 absorbs 57 million tons of CO\\u2082 from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and stores millions of tons of carbon by keeping those trees standing.\", \"But like so many Indigenous communities controlling tropical forests, his faces daily attacks from human predators \\u2014 miners, loggers, animal parts traffickers, drug smugglers and industrial farmers. Indigenous leaders were brought to Glasgow by Nia Tero to highlight their critical role.\", \"\\u201cWe have been taking care of this for the world, and our future generations, and we need to make sure that it is there forever,\\u201d said Kukush, who was hard to miss with his brightly colored headdress made of toucan feathers. \\u201cBut we have not benefited one cent. The carbon credits all go to the government and not us.\\u201d\", \"If you\\u2019re looking for an ordinary thing that could have an extraordinary impact, it would be protecting these biodiversity protectors.\", \"\\u201cOK, climate change is real, but it is too late to do anything serious, so let\\u2019s stop with all the green stuff and focus exclusively on adaptation. What\\u2019s so bad about golf in Minnesota in February?\\u201d\", \"If there is anything we should have learned from Covid-19, it\\u2019s that Mother Nature doesn\\u2019t play nice. Just when you think you\\u2019ve masked or vaxxed your way out of a problem, she surprises you with a Delta variant. \\u201cAdaptation\\u201d sounds so nice, so soft, so gradual \\u2014 until it isn\\u2019t. Of course, we\\u2019re going to have to adapt, but I\\u2019d prefer to have to adapt by building a single sea wall than rebuilding Miami or New Orleans every three years. The difference will be what we do to minimize climate change now.\", \"One of the most compelling voices on this subject in Glasgow was the earth system scientist Johan Rockstr\\u00f6m, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research.\", \"Mother Nature, Rockstr\\u00f6m remarked to me, has evolved an amazing tool kit to keep temperatures from fluctuating too hot or too cold and maintain us in this Garden of Eden climate that we\\u2019ve enjoyed for the last 11,000 or so years \\u2014 which enabled us to build civilization.\", \"But if the warming of the earth\\u2019s surface continues at the pace we are on, and the Greenland and West Antarctica ice sheets melt and no longer reflect the sun\\u2019s heat away from the oceans, and the Amazon flips from a tropical forest that soaks up carbon pollution into a deforested savanna that produces it, and the level, temperature and salinity of the oceans dramatically change, affecting monsoons, ocean circulation in the Atlantic and the jet stream, WATCH OUT.\", \"Our planet can go from a self-cooling, self-moderating system to a self-warming system. If that happens, adaptation will be a daily struggle for survival for hundreds of millions of people.\", \"\\u201cWe have more and more evidence that the planet is more fragile than we thought,\\u201d concluded Rockstr\\u00f6m. So, it may be hard, it may be impossible, but this is no time to give up on trying to phase out fossil fuels and prevent these tipping points from tipping.\", \"Two planets are talking to each other. One looks like a beautiful blue marble and the other a dirty brown ball.\", \"\\u201cWhat on earth happened to you?\\u201d the beautiful planet asks the brown one.\", \"\\u201cI had Homo sapiens,\\u201d answers the brown planet.\", \"\\u201cDon\\u2019t worry,\\u201d says the blue planet. \\u201cThey don\\u2019t last long.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"16fd39e241cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"16fd39e241cd11ec9d1a57307c2708d8"}},
