They left their children behind, according to federal prosecutors.\", \"On Monday, they were both sentenced in absentia. Mr. Ayvazyan received 17 years in prison and his wife received six. Artur Ayvazyan, 41, was sentenced to five years.\", \"During the hearing on Monday, Judge Stephen V. Wilson of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California said he could not recall a fraud case done in such a \\u201ccallous, intentional way without any regard for the law\\u201d and described Mr. Ayvazyan as \\u201can endemic, coldhearted fraudster.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Ayvazyan\\u2019s lawyer, Ashwin J.
