After a couple of years when the Oscars\\u2019 best-picture category vacillated between eight and nine nominees, the academy has finally resolved to go back to an even 10 this season. It\\u2019s a move I\\u2019m all in favor of, since the expanded race can make room for more distinctive movies.\", \"But here\\u2019s the bad news: When talking recently to Oscar voters, I hear too many of them complain, \\u201cAre there even 10 great films to vote for this year?\\u201d\", \"Greatness is in the eye of the beholder, but this year\\u2019s pack of Oscar contenders is at least gratifyingly varied, featuring big-studio blockbusters, intimate international dramas and an end-of-the-world comedy with a tramp-stamped Meryl Streep as the president. If voters feel the field is too sparse to fill out 10 slots, it\\u2019s only because they\\u2019re not looking hard enough.\", \"I\\u2019ve now screened all of this year\\u2019s major Oscar players aside from Guillermo del Toro\\u2019s \\u201cNightmare Alley\\u201d (which will finally begin showing just after this column goes to press), and though some consensus has begun to form about the major contenders, there is still an exciting array of movies that could fill out the rest of this year\\u2019s lineup. Here are my projections for the six movies that have the strongest best-picture chances, as well as a clutch of other worthy films that ought to give voters plenty to pick from.\", \"Could Steven Spielberg\\u2019s new musical pull off the same feat as the 1961 big-screen version and win best picture at the Oscars? After the film showed this week to standing ovations, I\\u2019ve moved \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d to pole position. Spielberg\\u2019s savvy reimagining of the source material marries old-school sweep with contemporary concerns, putting the movie right in Oscar voters\\u2019 sweet spot. And after last year\\u2019s smaller-scaled Academy Awards, a mammoth Steven Spielberg musical debuting only in theaters is exactly the sort of thing that the movie industry \\u2014 and the Oscars themselves \\u2014 will want to rally behind.\", \"As a movie, \\u201cBelfast\\u201d has an appealing modesty: It\\u2019s only 97 minutes, it never overreaches, and it ends on exactly the moment it should. But could that same modesty keep it from Oscar\\u2019s top spot? Many in the academy will adore Kenneth Branagh\\u2019s story of an Irish family navigating the Troubles, but \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d offers more pomp and circumstance and \\u201cBelfast\\u201d has so far racked up a fine but hardly eye-popping limited gross of about $5 million. The older art-house crowd that could have made the film a sleeper hit has not yet returned to theaters, so awards momentum will have to come from pure love of the movie itself.\", \"Jane Campion\\u2019s western is anchored by two very buzzy performances \\u2014 Benedict Cumberbatch as a sadistic rancher and Kirsten Dunst as his tormented sister-in-law \\u2014 and played at all the top fall film festivals, just as last year\\u2019s ultimate winner, \\u201cNomadland,\\u201d did. Much has changed since 1994, when Campion became only the second woman ever nominated for best director, and the chance to canonize her could put Campion in contention for a major Oscar. But I think the film has a better shot at winning the director race than triumphing in best picture.\", \"This inspirational drama about Richard Williams, father to tennis phenoms Venus and Serena, boasts this year\\u2019s presumed best-actor front-runner in Will Smith. That alone should secure it a best-picture berth, since the last 10 best-actor winners all hailed from films also nominated in Oscar\\u2019s top category. (That\\u2019s true of only six of the last 10 best-actress winners, another sign of how this voting body needs to take female-fronted films more seriously.) Still, a flurry of headlines about the film\\u2019s weak opening-weekend box office got \\u201cKing Richard\\u201d off on the wrong foot.\", \"The trailer for this Aaron Sorkin-directed dramedy played a very unwise game of \\u201cHide the Lucy,\\u201d treating Nicole Kidman\\u2019s performance as TV comedian Lucille Ball as an impending disaster that had to be judiciously cut around. But after the film began to screen for cheering guild audiences, Kidman\\u2019s smoky-throated transformation proved a surprise, vaulting her closer to a second Oscar. Add to all that a strong supporting cast \\u2014 including Javier Bardem as Desi Arnaz, along with J.K. Simmons and Nina Arianda \\u2014 and \\u201cBeing the Ricardos\\u201d (opening later this month) ought to be a significant awards player.\", \"The academy has gone gaga for Adam McKay\\u2019s last two issue-based comedies, \\u201cThe Big Short\\u201d and \\u201cVice,\\u201d and his new satire, \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up\\u201d (due later this month), has higher stakes and even more star wattage. Oscar favorites Streep, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Mark Rylance and Jonah Hill all star in this ensemble comedy about a comet threatening the end of the world \\u2014 a just-veiled-enough metaphor for the climate crisis, granted even more real-world resonance during the worldwide pandemic \\u2014 and amid a sea of period-piece contenders, \\u201cDon\\u2019t Look Up\\u201d and its screwed-future fatalism feels even more of the moment.\", \"Those are six sure things. So which other films are left contending for the last four spots?\", \"Like I said earlier, it helps to have a strong best-actor candidate fronting your movie. Expect a major push, then, for the musical \\u201cCyrano,\\u201d with a never-better Peter Dinklage, Lin-Manuel Miranda\\u2019s \\u201cTick, Tick \\u2026 Boom!,\\u201d featuring Andrew Garfield as the musical-theater composer Jonathan Larson, and Joel Coen\\u2019s \\u201cThe Tragedy of Macbeth,\\u201d with a galvanizing Denzel Washington in the title role. And since \\u201cC\\u2019mon C\\u2019mon\\u201d is the first film Joaquin Phoenix has starred in since \\u201cJoker,\\u201d it shouldn\\u2019t be discounted, even though I suspect this tender little drama about child-raising from the director Mike Mills could go the way of Mills\\u2019s last masterpiece, \\u201c20th Century Women,\\u201d and fly over academy heads.\", \"Let\\u2019s hope that when voters mark their best-actress choices, they realize that some of the most wonderful films of the year are contending in that category and deserve a best-picture berth, too. That group includes Paul Thomas Anderson\\u2019s \\u201cLicorice Pizza,\\u201d which features the film acting debut of the musician Alana Haim, as well as Pedro Almod\\u00f3var\\u2019s \\u201cParallel Mothers,\\u201d which won its star Pen\\u00e9lope Cruz the Volpi Cup for best actress at the Venice Film Festival. At Cannes, Renate Reinsve took best-actress honors and her romantic dramedy \\u201cThe Worst Person in the World\\u201d deserves a lot more awards attention, while at the recent Gotham Awards, the Maggie Gyllenhaal-directed \\u201cThe Lost Daughter\\u201d won several big trophies, including one for Olivia Colman\\u2019s lead performance. Many pundits think Kristen Stewart could win the Oscar for playing Princess Diana in Pablo Larra\\u00edn\\u2019s \\u201cSpencer,\\u201d though we\\u2019ll see if the film itself can manage something Larra\\u00edn\\u2019s more generally acclaimed \\u201cJackie\\u201d couldn\\u2019t and crack best picture.\", \"The academy has welcomed a big chunk of international members in the recent push to diversify its voting base, which could be good news for Asghar Farhadi: The Iranian director\\u2019s movies have twice taken what\\u2019s now known as the international-feature Oscar, but his new moral drama \\u201cA Hero\\u201d may go one step further and snag a best-picture nomination. The Oscar-vetted Italian auteur Paolo Sorrentino will attempt the same leap with his coming-of-age film \\u201cThe Hand of God,\\u201d which could also land him in the best-director race.\", \"I\\u2019m curious about \\u201cCODA,\\u201d the dramedy about the hearing daughter of a deaf family. It started 2021 off with a huge Sundance sale before landing on Apple TV+ over the summer to considerably less attention. The film is a conventional crowd-pleaser that crowds simply haven\\u2019t found, though two wins at the recent Gotham Awards may finally put some wind in its sails. And then there\\u2019s the sci-fi epic \\u201cDune,\\u201d which will be a major player in all the tech categories. The reception to \\u201cWest Side Story\\u201d may relieve the pressure to give \\u201cDune\\u201d a best-picture nod just to have something blockbuster-shaped in the final 10, but I still think the film has a good shot at the list: It\\u2019s beautifully made, and voters respect the director Denis Villeneuve for fighting a corporate mandate that shuffled his film off to HBO Max without warning. (And let\\u2019s face it: This year\\u2019s best-picture montage will look a lot cooler if it features giant sandworms.)\"]","href_hash":"b284d68452dc11ec92eaa5b254993841"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b284d68452dc11ec92eaa5b254993841"}},
