It was worth the wait to hear this 14-minute work by one of America\\u2019s most eminent composers \\u2014 who, at 83, is as inventive as ever.\", \"The piece is part of Project 19, the orchestra\\u2019s initiative to commission 19 female composers to honor the centennial of the 19th Amendment, which extended the vote to women. It began auspiciously in February 2020 with Nina C. Young\\u2019s \\u201cTread softly\\u201d and, later that month, Tania Le\\u00f3n\\u2019s \\u201cStride,\\u201d which went on to win the Pulitzer Prize this year.\", \"Ellen Reid also got her work in under the wire before the pandemic shut down the performing arts. But with the premiere of Tower\\u2019s hurtling, dark new piece, Project 19 has finally resumed. Her title juxtaposes 1920, when the amendment was ratified, with 2019 \\u2014 \\u201canother significant year for women,\\u201d as Tower writes in a program note, \\u201cthe height of the #MeToo movement, which raised the status of women to yet another level.\\u201d\", \"In her description Tower leaves the larger thematic resonances to listeners\\u2019 perceptions and focuses on the materials \\u2014 steady repeated notes, chords, runs in scales and such \\u2014 that drive the music. The piece begins with weighty blocks of orchestral chords heaving over kinetic rhythmic riffs. Rising runs and, soon, a persistent yet varying five-note motif keep spiraling forward. Imaginative writing for percussion and bustling rhythmic activity \\u2014 long traits of Tower\\u2019s music \\u2014 course through this restless, episodic score. On the surface the mood is ominous, even threatening. But the sheer intricacy lends a stirring fortitude to the music.\", \"During a long later section, the piece becomes like a little concerto for orchestra, featuring star turns for instruments in solo, duo, trio and small ensemble groups. Some observers have found Tower\\u2019s lucid music accessible almost to a fault. A better word to describe this engrossing, effective piece \\u2014 and her style overall \\u2014 is audible: All the multilayered, meter-fracturing workings of the score are laid out clearly. The Philharmonic\\u2019s music director, Jaap van Zweden drew a glittering, moody performance from the orchestra.\", \"Though the program didn\\u2019t make thematic or musical connections between Tower\\u2019s piece and the longer works that followed \\u2014 Mozart\\u2019s Piano Concerto No. 17 and Dvorak\\u2019s Seventh Symphony \\u2014 it was a pleasure to hear both those classic scores in such winning performances. Emanuel Ax was the animated and elegant soloist in the Mozart.\", \"The variety of his articulations and shadings was especially fine: sometimes crisp and sparkling, other times milky and subdued, as when the piano part shifts into wistful, minor-mode excursions during the sunny first movement. In the restrained, lyrical slow movement, Ax proved sensitive to Mozart\\u2019s evocations of his operatic aria style. The finale, a buoyant theme and variations, was splendidly stylish.\", \"Dvorak\\u2019s Seventh Symphony is suffused with the breadth, lyricism and wayward approach to harmony of his hero, Brahms. Yet Dvorak\\u2019s distinctive, rustic voice pervades the score. The Philharmonic\\u2019s performance captured the engaging yet elusive quality of the episodic first movement, and the dancing, bucolic third movement was especially vibrant. Van Zweden summoned fervor and opulent sound in the teeming finale without slipping into overdrive, as he sometimes does. And the players finally seem to be adapting to Tully, one of their temporary homes as David Geffen Hall is renovated.\"]","href_hash":"4fe94e4855ec11ecb3b78741729cb7b5"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"4fe94e4855ec11ecb3b78741729cb7b5"}},
