The opposition National and ACT parties are opposed to the first Bill and distinctly uncomfortable with the second.\", \"The Fair Pay Agreements Bill would establish a new system for collective bargaining in what Workplace Relations Minister Michael Wood has touted as an attempt to address low wages and other imbalances in New Zealand\\u2019s rather deregulated employment relations system.\", \"National and ACT have described the Bill as being too inflexible, unfriendly to employers and emboldening for unions. Some businesses have warned that it will drive up costs in a struggling economy, costs that ultimately the consumer will be lumped with.\", \"It\\u2019s a debate primed for a bit of heat in today\\u2019s first reading of the Fair Pay Agreements Bill, and also one likely to be an issue heading towards next year\\u2019s general election, with National promising to repeal the legislation if it comes to power.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://www.rnz.co.nz/assets/news/239798/eight_col_0O9A7041.JPG?1597732169\\\" alt=\\\"National MP Paul Goldsmith is the party's finance spokesperson\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">\\nNational MP Paul Goldsmith is the party's finance spokesperson \\nPhoto: VNP / Daniela Maoate-Cox\\n</div>\", \"While the opposition parties have in essence agreed to the establishment of a new holiday to mark the beginning of the new year in the M\\u0101ori lunar calendar, the Matariki Public Holiday Bill has found them scratchy as a head full of nits.\", \"In last week\\u2019s debate on the Bill, National\\u2019s Finance Spokesman Paul Goldsmith worried about the impact on businesses and productivity from having yet another public holiday. One of the other public holidays should make way for it, National argued. Labour Day was the obvious one, they suggested, with Goldsmith and others like ACT MP Simon Court musing - perhaps only half in jest - on why it was that the ruling party has a stat holiday named after it.\", \"This week the Bill is set for its third reading. While Labour\\u2019s Kiritapu Allan has clearly laid out the cultural significance for marking Matariki as well as the case for the holiday being beneficial to the economy, National is likely to continue picking at the legislation and maintain its push for the holiday to not have a M\\u0101ori name.
