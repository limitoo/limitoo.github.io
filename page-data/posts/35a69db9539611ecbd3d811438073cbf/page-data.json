He\\u2019s called Amin, and the animation adds a further layer of protection. But the voice that tells the story belongs to him, and the story itself is filtered through painful memories that he has kept to himself for a long time.\", \"At the start of the movie, Amin lies on his back with his eyes closed as Rasmussen prepares to film, a setup that suggests a cartoon version of psychoanalysis. And while the narrative moves mostly in a straight line, it also doubles back and encounters obstacles, proceeding into the past by means of association, indirection and the overcoming of repressed knowledge. That creates not only suspense, as we wonder what will happen to Amin and his family, but also a powerful feeling of intimacy. \\u201cFlee\\u201d may be about a pressing global issue \\u2014 the plight of refugees displaced by war and other emergencies since at least the 1980s \\u2014 but it\\u2019s also about a specific person\\u2019s life.\", \"The first home Amin remembers is in Kabul. As the youngest of five children \\u2014 their father was a military officer \\u2014 Amin watched as the Soviet-backed government in Afghanistan gave way to the American-financed Mujahedeen. The conflict is depicted in live-action news footage and also in shadowy, almost abstract black-and-white images. The politics are less important than the confusion and trauma a child experiences as his world unravels. Amin\\u2019s father is arrested and his older brother narrowly escapes being conscripted.\", \"Another brother lives in Sweden, and the rest of the family relies on his help once they flee to Moscow. Russia is home for a while, but after 1989 it becomes an increasingly treacherous place, a land of poverty, corruption and brutal weather. Scandinavia seems more promising, but getting there is expensive and dangerous, and requires some agonizing choices.\", \"From the start, we know that Amin made it safely to Copenhagen. His reminiscences are interwoven with scenes from his adult life. He\\u2019s about to take up a postdoc at Princeton, and he and his fianc\\u00e9, Jasper, are thinking about buying a house. \\u201cFlee\\u201d acknowledges Amin\\u2019s good fortune \\u2014 and offers quiet testimony to the decency and generosity of Danish society \\u2014 while also reckoning with what it cost him.\", \"Less a sociological case study than a psychological portrait, the film is both probing and tactful. The fact that it arose out of Rasmussen\\u2019s friendship with Amin creates a feeling of trust. The director is receptive to Amin\\u2019s secrets and aware of the nuances of his personality. As much as \\u201cFlee\\u201d is a refugee\\u2019s tale of flight and eventual settling, it\\u2019s also a coming-out story, and as such a complex reflection on different forms of outsiderhood.\", \"To be an immigrant in Denmark and a gay man in Afghanistan are hardly equivalent, but the nuances of both experiences yield some touching, surprising and funny moments. Amin discovers his sexuality via a fascination with the Belgian action star Jean-Claude Van Damme, whom he imagines winking at him from a poster on his bedroom wall in Kabul. Later, Amin experiences a brief, powerful crush on a fellow migrant during one of the legs of his journey.\", \"The animation suffuses \\u201cFlee\\u201d with a strangeness that a conventional documentary might not possess, and that perhaps mirrors Amin\\u2019s own alienation. He isn\\u2019t unhappy, but his features seem shrouded in melancholy, a condition Rasmussen addresses with sympathy rather than sentimentality. Luck and loss can\\u2019t be disentangled, and that may be the meaning of home that this patient, humane film arrives at.\"]","href_hash":"35a69db9539611ecbd3d811438073cbf"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"35a69db9539611ecbd3d811438073cbf"}},
