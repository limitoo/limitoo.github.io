Trump and Russia for what turned out to be Democratic-funded opposition research, according to people familiar with the matter.\", \"The arrest of the analyst, Igor Danchenko, is part of the special counsel inquiry led by John H. Durham, who was appointed by the Trump administration to scrutinize the Russia investigation for any wrongdoing, the people said.\", \"Mr. Danchenko, was the primary researcher of the so-called Steele dossier, a compendium of rumors and unproven assertions suggesting that Mr. Trump and his 2016 campaign were compromised by and conspiring with Russian intelligence officials in Moscow\\u2019s covert operation to help him defeat Hillary Clinton.\", \"The people familiar with the matter spoke on condition of anonymity because the indictment of Mr. Danchenko had yet to be unsealed. A spokesman for Mr. Durham did not respond to a request for comment.\", \"Some claims from the Steele dossier made their way into an F.B.I. wiretap application targeting a former Trump campaign adviser in October 2016. Other portions of it \\u2014 particularly a salacious claim about a purported sex tape \\u2014 caused a political and media firestorm when Buzzfeed published the materials in January 2017, shortly before Mr. Trump was sworn in.\", \"But most of the important claims in the dossier \\u2014 which was written by Mr. Danchenko\\u2019s employer, Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent \\u2014 have not been proven, and some have been refuted. F.B.I. agents interviewed Mr. Danchenko in 2017 when they were seeking to run down the claims in the dossier.\", \"The interview suggested that aspects of the dossier were misleading: Mr. Steele left unclear that much of the material was thirdhand information, and some of what Mr. Danchenko \\u2014 who was born in Russia but lives in the United States \\u2014 had relayed was more speculative than the dossier implied.\", \"A 2019 investigation by the Justice Department\\u2019s inspector general sharply criticized the F.B.I. for continuing to cite material from the dossier after the bureau interviewed Mr. Danchenko without alerting judges that some of what he said had cast doubt on the contents of the dossier.\", \"The inspector general report also said that a decade earlier, when Mr. Danchenko worked for the Brookings Institution, a prominent Washington think-tank, he had been the subject of a counterintelligence investigation into whether he was a Russian agent.\", \"In an interview with The New York Times in 2020, Mr. Danchenko defended the integrity of his work, saying he had been tasked to gather \\u201craw intelligence\\u201d and was simply passing it on to Mr. Steele. Mr. Danchenko \\u2014 who made his name as a Russia analyst by exposing indications that the dissertation of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia contained plagiarized material \\u2014 also denied being a Russian agent.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019ve never been a Russian agent,\\u201d Mr. Danchenko said. \\u201cIt is ridiculous to suggest that. This, I think, it\\u2019s slander.\\u201d\", \"Mr. Steele\\u2019s efforts were part of opposition research that Democrats were indirectly funding by the time the 2016 general election took shape. Mr. Steele\\u2019s business intelligence firm was a subcontractor to another research firm, Fusion GPS, which in turn had been hired by the Perkins Coie law firm, which was working for the Hillary Clinton campaign.\", \"Mr. Danchenko said he did not know who Mr. Steele\\u2019s client was at the time and considered himself a nonpartisan analyst and researcher.\", \"Mr. Durham has been known to be interested in Mr. Danchenko and the Steele dossier saga. In February, he used a subpoena to obtain old personnel files and other documents related to Mr. Danchenko from the Brookings Institution, where Mr. Danchenko had worked from 2005 until 2010.\", \"The charges against Mr. Danchenko follow Mr. Durham\\u2019s indictment in September of a cybersecurity lawyer, Michael Sussmann, which accused him of lying to the F.B.I. about who he was working for when he brought concerns about possible Trump-Russia links to the bureau in September 2016.\", \"Mr. Sussmann, who then also worked for Perkins Coie, was relaying concerns developed by data scientists about odd internet logs they said suggested the possibility of a covert communications channel between the Trump Organization and Alfa Bank, a Kremlin-linked financial institution. He has denied lying to the F.B.I. about who he was working for.\"]","href_hash":"ace229c23d7711ec88d3000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"ace229c23d7711ec88d3000017025a03"}},
