Here are some highlights from Tuesday night.\", \"Sadly, the guest of honor at the Tag Heuer party wasn\\u2019t able to make it. The basketball star Jimmy Butler, who plays for the Miami Heat, was injured at a game on the weekend and sent along a video message instead. In his absence, Fr\\u00e9d\\u00e9ric Arnault, the brand\\u2019s new chief executive, entertained guests.\", \"Occasion: An intimate dinner to promote Tag Heuer\\u2019s new watch, the Carrera Heuer 02T Tourbillon.\", \"The Room: Two long dinner tables on an illuminated Plexiglas stage were set up in the garden of a private home in Miami Beach.\", \"In Attendance: Mr. Arnault, the actress Madelyn Cline, the musician Luisi Fonsi and the television host Paulina Vega.\", \"The Food: A family-style spread of Japanese-inspired dishes like sashimi, rib-eye with truffles and citrus wasabi cod.\", \"Moment of the Night: Before dessert was served, the violinist Ezinma performed two pieces, including a cover of Mr. Fonsi\\u2019s \\u201cDespacito,\\u201d to his amusement. (He danced along.)\", \"The Mood: \\u201cIt\\u2019s my first time in Miami, and it\\u2019s been a blast,\\u201d Ms. Cline said. Is she planning to buy souvenirs? \\u201cMy favorite souvenir to get or give from anywhere would be something corny. I love those big T-shirts that say, \\u2018I Heart Whatever City.\\u2019\\u201d\", \"Jean Paul Gaultier\\u2019s name was on the invitation, but Mr. Gaultier himself was not in attendance. Still, that didn\\u2019t stop the art crowd from converging at the Faena Hotel after midnight and trying desperately to get past the bouncers.\", \"Occasion: The installation of two new pieces by Pilar Zeta at the Faena.\", \"The Room: The Theater, a space with a stage, chandelier and banquette that surrounds a dance floor.\", \"In Attendance: The musician Macy Gray; Richie Shazam, a model, photographer and activist; the model Mica Arga\\u00f1araz; the actor Josh O\\u2019Connor; the designer Jonathan Anderson; and DJ Honey Dijon.\", \"Moment of the Night: Around 12:30 a.m., the drag queen Violet Chachki performed a raunchy version of Meg Myer\\u2019s \\u201cDesire,\\u201d straddled atop a phallic sculpture.\", \"The Mood: \\u201cI\\u2019m here for the ultimate escape and to embrace art,\\u201d Ms. Shazam said. \\u201cI\\u2019m excited to be partnering with Playboy and to be doing all of the fun fantasies they have in store for us.\\u201d Her favorite Playmate? \\u201cPamela Anderson, always, everyday. I like her freedom and organic beauty, inside and out.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"11dab93f536211ec850bbdf2b1eee4a6"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"11dab93f536211ec850bbdf2b1eee4a6"}},
