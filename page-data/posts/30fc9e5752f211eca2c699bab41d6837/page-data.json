Touched on in the Oscar winner \\u201cFree Solo\\u201d and summer\\u2019s \\u201cThe Alpinist,\\u201d those relationships get screen time in \\u201c14 Peaks: Nothing Is Impossible,\\u201d about the Nepalese climber Nirmal Purja, known as Nimsdai, and his attempt to summit the world\\u2019s 14 highest peaks in seven months. (The previous record was seven years.) While his wife, Suchi Purja, charmingly attempts to explain her husband\\u2019s embrace of risk to civilians, it\\u2019s his ailing mother who underscores more tender lessons about her son\\u2019s drive but also about the mortality we all face.\", \"As a young man, Purja enlisted in his country\\u2019s legendary armed forces, the Gurkhas, and later joined the United Kingdom Special Forces. He seized on the climbing endeavor, which he called \\u201cProject Possible,\\u201d as a way to highlight the contributions of Nepalese mountaineers, who are more than the Sherpas to Western expeditions. Early on, the project\\u2019s four other climbers \\u2014 Mingma David Sherpa, Geljen Sherpa, Lakpa Dendi Sherpa and Gesman Tamang \\u2014 get introduced as vital characters. They are as devoted to Purja\\u2019s seemingly mad mission as he is.\", \"Much of the documentary\\u2019s climbing footage was taken by Purja and his team. The director Torquil Jones uses those images, as well as fresh interviews (the alpine legend Reinhold Messner waxing beautifully existential) and some vivid animation to craft a documentary exploring themes of generosity, danger, drive and national character.\", \"In widening its aperture \\u2014 from the ascents to visits to Purja\\u2019s childhood home as well as brief dives into Nepal\\u2019s history \\u2014 \\u201c14 Peaks\\u201d expands a genre often focused on the feats of individuals to celebrate lessons about vast dreams and communal bonds.\"]","href_hash":"30fc9e5752f211eca2c699bab41d6837"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"30fc9e5752f211eca2c699bab41d6837"}},
