By the same token, when Robert B. Weide, who directed this movie with Don Argott, describes the themes of a Vonnegut novel he read as a teen, he concludes by saying \\u201cWhat high school kid isn\\u2019t going to gobble this up?\\u201d A viewer with more grown-up standards, however, might make a squinchy face at that.\", \"Vonnegut\\u2019s breakthrough novel was one that was hugely difficult to write. \\u201cUnstuck in Time\\u201d chronicles \\u201cSlaughterhouse-Five\\u201d and other works by the author. \\u201cSlaughterhouse-Five\\u201d (1969), with its harrowing description of the Allied firebombing that obliterated Dresden in World War II, became a counterculture classic. Vonnegut was there, as a P.O.W. The book took him a long time to complete, in part because of his reluctance to revisit past trauma.\", \"The novel\\u2019s conceits \\u2014 including the assertion that its hero, Billy Pilgrim, is \\u201cunstuck in time,\\u201d bouncing around his own life like a pinball \\u2014 were conveyed in a deceptively relaxed, accessible style. (The book was made into a well-received movie released in 1972.)\", \"Much of the documentary is devoted to Weide\\u2019s decades-long work on the project and to the friendship he developed with Vonnegut. It\\u2019s a double portrait that undermines the movie\\u2019s title somewhat.\", \"\\u201cI didn\\u2019t even want to be in this film in the first place,\\u201d Weide, who\\u2019s helmed documentaries and several seasons of \\u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm,\\u201d tells the camera, sounding slightly disingenuous. Not being in a movie can be the easiest thing in the world, if you put your mind to it.\", \"In any event, the movie\\u2019s structure is determined \\u2014 and sometimes skewed \\u2014 by its insistence on telling the tale of a writer and his cinematic Boswell. If you can roll with that, \\u201cUnstuck in Time\\u201d does have its revelations and rewards.\"]","href_hash":"be6db53b486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"be6db53b486c11ec87e303dcce2f4e21"}},
