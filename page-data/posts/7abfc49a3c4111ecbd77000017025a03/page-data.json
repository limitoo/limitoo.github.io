This change returns to a policy that was in place before the issue was politicized, and that was utilized by both a Republican and Democrat secretary of state.\\\"\", \"As of today, those who wish to correct the sex designation on their license or ID must fill out a form, go to an SOS branch office to have their photo taken, and pay the $9 correction fee for a driver's license or $10 for a state ID, according to the Secretary of State. Also, individuals do not have to provide a birth certificate, passport, or court order to make the change. The form is currently available on the SOS department's website.\", \"Other participants in the new measure included Lilianna Angel Reyes, youth drop-in director at the Ruth Ellis Center and executive director of Trans Sistas of Color Project, and Jeynce Poindexter, transgender specialist/victims advocate for Equality Michigan and vice president of Trans Sistas.\", \"In the press release, Reyes and Poindexter expressed a number of difficulties that exist within the trans community regarding living without proper identification.\", \"\\\"For us, having a state identification that reflects how we see ourselves reduces trauma and stress when having to show your ID,\\\" Reyes said. \\\"It validates who we are, especially in a world where people and systems constantly devalue our identity.\\\"\", \"Poindexter stated that having proper identification in the transgender community \\\"helps fight discrimination and reduces the chances for misunderstandings when interacting with law enforcement, healthcare providers and others.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"7abfc49a3c4111ecbd77000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7abfc49a3c4111ecbd77000017025a03"}},
