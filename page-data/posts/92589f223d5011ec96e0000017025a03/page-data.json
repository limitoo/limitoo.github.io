Black women, and for the first time, have more women than men.\", \"Most of that did happen on Tuesday, but not exactly in the way that was anticipated. At least two of the women newly elected to the Council were Republicans \\u2014 part of a trend that saw the party unexpectedly gain seats for the first time since 2009.\", \"Though Democrats cruised to victories in the vast majority of races, Republicans defended the three City Council seats they held, including one that Democrats sought to flip. They also picked up a fourth and remained competitive in three other races that, with some ballots yet to be counted, remained too close to call on Wednesday night.\", \"Even in two races where incumbent Democrats were running for re-election on multiple party lines, they received more votes on the Republican ballot line than the Democratic one.\", \"The results reveal the extent to which Republicans were able to garner support in more moderate and conservative districts by focusing on a few salient issues \\u2014 a dynamic that was also at play in races nationwide.\", \"Elected officials and strategists from both parties said that the competitive Council contests were largely shaped by similar issues: concern over public safety, frustration over pandemic-related guidelines including vaccine mandates, and alienation from a Democratic Party that some voters worry has left them behind as the left wing has ascended.\", \"\\u201cThere is a lack of a clear message of what the Democratic Party stands for,\\u201d said Ken Sherrill, a professor emeritus of political science at Hunter College.\", \"Others said that low turnout had likely been a factor, and that Democrats had to do more to draw voters to the polls.\", \"\\u201cWe can\\u2019t take our electorate for granted and just assume that because we\\u2019re in a blue state that all voters will follow us,\\u201d said Sochie Nnaemeka, the New York State director of the left-leaning Working Families Party. \\u201cWe have to always be fighting.\\u201d\", \"Still, the broader contours of the next City Council remain unchanged from expectations. As it has been for decades, the 51-member body will be dominated by Democrats, many of them new faces from the party\\u2019s left wing. The city is poised to have one of the most diverse councils in its history, with at least 30 women holding office.\", \"The showing from Republicans is unlikely to alter the city\\u2019s immediate political direction. If Republicans picked up the final three races, they would have seven seats \\u2014 their largest faction since the mid-1990s, but likely not enough to pose a major threat to Democratic priorities. Eric Adams, the Democratic candidate, handily won his election for mayor, and four of the five borough presidents will also remain Democrats, with Staten Island, a conservative stronghold, the exception.\", \"Among the still undecided races was a re-election bid by Councilman Justin Brannan, a Democrat who is a contender to become City Council speaker next year and whose Brooklyn district includes Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst and Bath Beach. On Tuesday night, he was 255 votes behind his opponent, Brian Fox, though at least 1,456 returned absentee ballots, about 1,000 from registered Democrats, have yet to be counted.\", \"In an interview on Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Brannan said that he believed that low turnout \\u2014 about 24,000 people voted in person and 3,300 requested absentee ballots in a district where 105,000 are registered \\u2014 was a factor in the tight margin of his race.\", \"But he also said the close race was demonstrative of the headwinds that Democrats had faced nationally and accused his opponent of trying to \\u201charness these national culture wars\\u201d over hot-button issues like policing and vaccine mandates.\", \"During the campaign, Mr. Fox staunchly opposed vaccine mandates. His campaign also seized on the slogan \\u201cJustin Brannan defunded the police,\\u201d a reference to the budget negotiations last year in which city officials agreed to shift roughly $1 billion from the Police Department. Most council members, including Mr. Brannan, voted for that budget. He also voted for this year\\u2019s budget, which added $200 million back to the police budget.\", \"In Bay Ridge on Wednesday, Evan Chacker, 49, who owns an online education business, pointed to Mr. Brannan\\u2019s vote as a principal reason that the councilman lost his support.\", \"\\u201cWe have law enforcement in the family,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHe voted to defund the police.\\u201d\", \"Vincent Dardanello, the owner of a Sicilian cafe called Amuni, said that taxes and public safety were top issues for him, and that he had voted for Mr. Fox out of party loyalty, even though he knew and liked Mr. Brannan.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m a Republican, pretty much straight through,\\u201d Mr. Dardanello, 45, said.\", \"The debates were similar in other districts where Republicans won or exhibited strong showings, including in District 32 in Queens, the last Republican-controlled seat in that borough.\", \"During the campaign, which attracted spending from outside groups, Joann Ariola, the head of the Queens Republican Party, touted her support for the police, her commitment to protecting and improving the city schools\\u2019 gifted and talented program, and her focus on quality-of-life issues.\", \"Her Democratic opponent, Felicia Singh, a former teacher backed by left-leaning groups, kept her focus on education, the environment and the need for resources for often-underserved communities. Ms. Ariola, who sought to portray Ms. Singh as too left wing, won easily, by thousands of votes.\", \"The race to fill the seat in District 48 in southern Brooklyn, home to many Orthodox Jews and Russian and Ukrainian immigrants, reflected some changing political winds in parts of the city.\", \"Voters in the district have gradually shifted to the right, and the area favored former President Donald J. Trump in 2020. Inna Vernikov, a lawyer who decried vaccine mandates and to whom Donald Trump Jr. lent support, defeated Steven Saperstein there, giving Republicans a fourth seat on the Council.\", \"Races remained close in District 19 in Queens, where Vickie Paladino, a Republican community activist, leads Tony Avella, a former Democratic state senator and councilman. The Democratic candidate in District 47 in Brooklyn, Ari Kagan, was ahead of his Republican opponent, Mark Szuszkiewicz, by just 283 votes. Many absentee votes remain outstanding in both races.\", \"The winners of those races will join a Council stuffed with Democrats who won easy victories in their races and come from across the liberal spectrum. They include moderate incumbents like Francisco Moya, as well as a number of former left-wing activists with no previous ties to City Hall like Tiffany Cab\\u00e1n and Kristin Richardson Jordan, an activist who is one of the first two Black L.G.B.T.Q. women on the Council.\", \"Ms. Jordan, who narrowly won victory in her primary, said on Wednesday that her win reflected the priorities of voters in her Upper Manhattan district: affordable housing, criminal justice reform and equality in education. Those differ from the chief concerns stated by voters in districts where Republicans were more competitive.\", \"Christina Greer, a political scientist at Fordham University, said that as a whole, the Council results highlighted what has long been true: that while conservatives have been muted in the city\\u2019s political discourse, they have always been something of a force.\", \"Ms. Greer also said that the results illustrated the difficulty of characterizing the city\\u2019s electorate in broad strokes. \", \"\\u201cWe have to recognize that there\\u2019s several shades of blue in New York City,\\u201d she said.\"]","href_hash":"92589f223d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"92589f223d5011ec96e0000017025a03"}},
