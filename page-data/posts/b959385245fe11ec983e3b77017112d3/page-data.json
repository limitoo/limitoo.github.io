These renderings resulted from Neel\\u2019s grappling with the dual responsibilities of mother and artist, a dilemma she referred to as \\u201cthat awful dichotomy.\\u201d Directly born from this dichotomy is Claire Oshetsky\\u2019s searing and ethereal debut novel, \\u201cChouette.\\u201d\", \"Tiny, a professional cellist living in Sacramento, has stepped out on her dull husband to have an affair with a beloved friend from her youth, a female owl, and is now pregnant with a baby who is half human, half owl. She wrestles with the effect this baby will have on her music career, not to mention her reputation within her husband\\u2019s equally dull family. The novel is named for the owl-daughter who arrives and proceeds to overturn every system in Tiny\\u2019s life.\", \"The fable\\u2019s metaphors leap organically from the page, contouring the dichotomy as capably as do Neel\\u2019s oils: a newborn\\u2019s vulnerability and destructive power; the mother\\u2019s isolation; her tender, feral nature. A spate of recent fiction about motherhood (Claire Vaye Watkins\\u2019s \\u201cI Love You but I\\u2019ve Chosen Darkness,\\u201d Torrey Peters\\u2019s \\u201cDetransition, Baby\\u201d) has helped broaden a canon that has been historically inaccessible to writers who, whether by raising children or working long hours or caring for elders, spend their days in service of others. Sometimes these books simply reiterate the sentiment that parenting \\u2014 even when rich and white \\u2014 is difficult, but at their keenest, they offer complex reimaginings of societal roles.\", \"Sometimes I wonder how \\u201cmotherhood,\\u201d a singular noun, can encompass so many varied experiences. Do we doom the conversation \\u2014 and the mothers who fall outside of a perceived norm \\u2014 by referring to it as a monolith? Tiny is white, affluent (she flies to Berlin on a whim to attend the symphony and to consider whether to keep the baby) and squarely in the middle of a fable, yet her motherhood feels specific and surprising. She works to keep her career (wood shrews nest in her cello), her house (overtaken by nature) and her reputation, even as her heart expands to protect Chouette.\", \"The owl-daughter presents another dichotomy. To learn more about her owl side, I consulted Chris Conard, a natural resource specialist for Sacramento County, who guessed Chouette to be a Western screech, though he said the descriptions and cover image seem purposefully democratic. Oshetsky\\u2019s choice to evoke our popular idea of an owl is effectively romantic. Owls are associated with mystery and wisdom (although Conard notes that the big eyes behind that reputation are simply a result of their nocturnal nature), and they hunt by sound, one ear slightly higher than the other to triangulate prey on the ground. It makes sense that Chouette, the daughter of a cellist, would have inherited her mother\\u2019s exceptional ear.\", \"On the human side, the novel resists specifying Chouette\\u2019s behavioral challenges, referring to her only as \\u201cnonconforming.\\u201d Doctors suggest treatments that include swim therapy, a \\u201cspecial school,\\u201d tough love and \\u2014 in the novel\\u2019s most terrifying section \\u2014 experimental surgery. While ambiguity in fables allows for interpretation, a vague idea of disability in a metaphorical construction runs the risk of reducing severe disability to animalistic comparison. \\u201cChouette\\u201d seems to answer this by focusing squarely on Tiny\\u2019s fierce love as she battles her husband and nature to allow Chouette to be wild and exact, stakes that feel frightening and true to life.\", \"Eventually, owl-daughters must hunt for themselves. As Chouette grows more independent, Tiny experiences a final, awful dichotomy: twin desires to keep and let fly. In fiction, supernatural premises are notoriously hard to land, but \\u201cChouette\\u201d\\u2019s final moments are among its loveliest. Human and owl meet in equal measure on the page in a crescendo of stunning lines. Just as Tiny longs for the world to meet her daughter where she is instead of forcing her into societal norms, \\u201cChouette\\u201d is best met where it resides: as a harrowing and magnificent fable.\"]","href_hash":"b959385245fe11ec983e3b77017112d3"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b959385245fe11ec983e3b77017112d3"}},
