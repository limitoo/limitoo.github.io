Giving back to the country where their parents or grandparents come from.\", \"\\\"It's a good way to acknowledge the sacrifices that their parents and grandparents have made. I can see a lot of players heading down that path.\\\"\", \"Players must stand down from test rugby for 36 months before switching and may change unions only once.\", \"There are many ex All Blacks that could play for their country of heritage now, including Julian Savea, Victor Vito, Lima Sopoaga, Francis Saili and Steven Luatua for Samoa and Charles Piutau, Israel Folau, Vaea Fifita, George Moala, Augustine Pulu for Tonga.\", \"Poluleuligaga is confident the changes to World Rugby's eligibility rules will have an instant impact on the strength of the Pacific Island nations.\", \"\\\"It just didn't feel right that Samoa, Tonga and Fiji are at the World Cup every four years, and we don't have the best players. For players like former All Black Charles Piutau it will be amazing for him and Tonga to play at a World Cup, he's one of rugby's best and should be playing at the World Cup.\", \"\\\"For the Pacific Island countries to have access to their best players, it would be phenomenal. The 2023 World Cup is going to be full of these Pacific Island superstars we've been able to bring back into test rugby.\\\"\", \"He said the rule changes will be hugely beneficial for the likes of Samoa, Fiji and Tonga.\", \"\\\"It's huge. It's huge. The Pacific Island community have given so much to the global game. This change will benefit those teams on the field and off the field as well. I'm thinking about the likes of former All Blacks Lima Sopoaga and Steven Luatua and even the Chiefs first-five Josh Ioane being available for the next World Cup. There's a lot of potential, a lot of things to get excited about.\", \"\\\"From the commercial side of it, having these players available would really add a bit of credibility to the brands (Samoa, Tonga, Fiji) and to raise exposure of the teams to get more sponsorship on board.\", \"\\\"Everyone at the unions in Samoa, Tonga and Fiji will be celebrating all day. It honestly feels like we've won the World Cup with this announcement.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"9fbf1e764e0711ec9a3483700b8f2847"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"9fbf1e764e0711ec9a3483700b8f2847"}},
