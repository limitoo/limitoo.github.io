to vulnerable people living in chronically overcrowded housing.\", \"The town is entering its second full day of lockdown after nine new cases were recorded yesterday.\\u00a0There are now 11 cases in the Katherine and Robinson River community cluster.\", \"NT health authorities are racing to track the spread of the outbreak and determine whether the cluster is linked to cases that triggered restrictions in Darwin and Katherine a fortnight ago.\", \"The town's main Aboriginal health clinic, Wurli Wurlinjang Aboriginal Health Service, is closed for deep cleaning this morning after being listed\\u00a0as an exposure site.\", \"Katherine Hospital is also a close contact exposure site but remains operating.\", \"Wurli Wurlinjang chairwoman\\u00a0Lisa Mumbin said she was worried for local people and families already grappling with poor housing and underlying health issues stemming from\\u00a0poverty.\", \"\\\"We share a lot of things, we still live in overcrowded houses,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"All this is a\\u00a0strong risk to a lot of our people.\", \"At lunchtime yesterday authorities said contact tracers were trying to reach more than 160 people identified from a growing list of exposure sites around the town, including students at the MacFarlane Primary School.\", \"And the results of 20 \\\"priority tests\\\" conducted in Robinson River, the small community where one of the two cases recorded on Monday tested positive, are expected this morning.\", \"NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner said at a press conference on Tuesday\\u00a0that\\u00a0COVID-19 could spread particularly fast within\\u00a0overcrowded homes, as had happened in Katherine, making them a major risk for transmission of the virus.\", \"\\\"We know that Delta has a close to 100 per cent infection rate within a household, so it does concern us if it gets into \\u2026\\u00a0any household, but particularly into an overcrowded household,\\\" he said.\", \"\\\"That's obviously a lot of people that will then be positive, and then there'll be a lot of contact tracing efforts off the back of that.\\\"\", \"<img

the organisation had been calling for action to address\\u00a0overcrowding in Aboriginal communities throughout the pandemic.\", \"The homelessness rate in Katherine is twice the NT average and 31 times the national rate, according to government statistics.\", \"\\\"We've been advocating and lobbying for more housing and accommodation in these remote and regional larger communities throughout the Northern Territory,\\\" Mr Paterson said.\", \"\\\"And it's a big ask, it is a big ask for people now to go and self-isolate when they're in accommodation with up to 20, 30 family members.\\\"\", \"He said the government should be looking at providing emergency accommodation for people needing to isolate away from other family members.\", \"He also joined Labor senator Malarndirri McCarthy \\u2014\\u00a0who yesterday said the new cases recorded were all relatives of hers' \\u2014\\u00a0in urging people to get vaccinated.\", \"Katherine's overall vaccination rate is 75 per cent double
