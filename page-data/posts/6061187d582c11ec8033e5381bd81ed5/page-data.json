A decomposing body found Tuesday in the woods of New Port Richey belongs to Kathleen Moore, the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said.\", \"The sheriff's office said somebody walking in the area of Carmel Avenue called around 11:30 a.m. to report a woman's remains covered in \\\"thick brush,\\\" CBS affiliate WTSP reports. Detectives later used tattoos to identify the 34-year-old Moore, who was last seen out with friends on November 28.\", \"Collin Knapp, 30, was arrested and charged with second-degree murder in the case. Knapp and Moore had been in an on-and-off relationship for the past five years, according to Sheriff Chris Nocco.\", \"Nocco said Knapp and Moore were seen arguing at a bar on the night she disappeared, and eventually wound up at Knapp's residence.\", \"Moore's body was found 50 yards northeast of Knapp's home and was in a very heavily brushed area, according to the sheriff's office.
