The event, now in its 18th year, will feature nearly two dozen artists, with performances held at the Public and Mabou Mines in Manhattan as well as a venue in upstate New York.\", \"Those who\\u2019ve attended in past years will notice a few differences: The festival will run for three weeks instead of two and include only 15 productions at the Public \\u2014 all 90 minutes or less \\u2014 down from the 22 at the 2020 festival.\", \"\\u201cI\\u2019m happy we have a smaller festival this year so we can really concentrate on these pieces and give them the attention they deserve,\\u201d Mark Russell, the festival director, said in a phone conversation, adding that he hadn\\u2019t yet determined whether the change would be permanent.\", \"One of the pieces that Russell said he was most excited to land was Jasmine Lee-Jones\\u2019s \\u201cSeven Methods of Killing Kylie Jenner\\u201d (Jan. 12-16, 18-23, 25-29). Staged to critical acclaim at London\\u2019s Royal Court Theater last summer, the 90-minute two-hander explores cultural appropriation, queerness, friendship and the ownership of Black bodies online and in real life.\", \"A cultural re-examination is also what Annie Saunders and Becca Wolff have planned for the New York premiere of their hourlong show \\u201cOur Country,\\u201d a meeting of mythic and modern America set in California\\u2019s marijuana country and inspired by Sophocles\\u2019 \\u201cAntigone\\u201d (Jan. 12-16, 21-23).\", \"A pair of solo shows also highlight the schedule: The playwright Inua Ellams (\\u201cBarber Shop Chronicles\\u201d) will perform his 90-minute, music- and poetry-filled piece \\u201cAn Evening with an Immigrant,\\u201d which chronicles his journey from Nigeria to England (Jan. 18-20). Roger Guenveur Smith, an actor known for his roles in Spike Lee films, will return to the festival with his hourlong solo show \\u201cOtto Frank,\\u201d a historical account of the father of Anne Frank, who was the only immediate member of his family to survive the Holocaust (Jan. 13-16, 20-23).\", \"Rounding out the slate is a double bill of \\u201cMud/Drowning,\\u201d two intimate works by Mar\\u00eda Irene Forn\\u00e9s, a Cuban American playwright and director who died in 2018, which, following a sold-out run last year, will return to the experimental theater company Mabou Mines (Jan. 12-16, 18-23, 25-30). \\u201cMud,\\u201d a play by Forn\\u00e9s, is a grim consideration of ignorance, poverty and desperation, while \\u201cDrowning,\\u201d a half-hour \\u201cpocket\\u201d opera by the composer Philip Glass, is adapted from Forn\\u00e9s\\u2019s five-page surreal play based on a short story by Anton Chekhov.\", \"A new initiative, \\u201cUnder the Radar: On the Road,\\u201d will also bring a pair of Pascal Rambert monologues, \\u201cThe Art of Theater\\u201d and \\u201cWith My Own Hands,\\u201d to a venue called PS21: Performance Spaces for the 21st Century in Chatham, N.Y., which sits on 100 acres of orchards, meadows and woodlands (Jan. 14-15, 22-23).\", \"Following the Under the Radar Festival, \\u201cAn Evening with an Immigrant\\u201d will also be performed at Oklahoma City Repertory Theater (Jan. 22-23) and at Stanford University (Jan. 29-30), and \\u201cSeven Methods of Killing Kylie Jenner\\u201d will transfer to Washington, D.C., for a three-week run at Woolly Mammoth Theatre Company (Feb. 14-March 6).\", \"\\u201cWe\\u2019re acknowledging that small-scale work needs touring to survive and reach the widest audience,\\u201d Russell said.\", \"The festival will also include eight works in the \\u201cIncoming!\\u201d works-in-process series and the return of concerts by artists including Migguel Anggelo, Salty Brine and Alicia Hall Moran at Joe\\u2019s Pub in Manhattan.\", \"A full lineup is available at publictheater.org.\"]","href_hash":"8232153c513811ec829c2ff0671180f4"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"8232153c513811ec829c2ff0671180f4"}},
