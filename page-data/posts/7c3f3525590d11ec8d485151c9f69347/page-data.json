The Biden-Harris administration has made clear that efforts to bolster democracy globally begin by working diligently and transparently to strengthen its foundations at home.\", \"\\\"And you'll see messaging from President Biden and other administration officials to that effect over the course of the summit.\\\"\", \"They spoke of voting rights as a focus on this point for the president, adding: \\\"The President has been absolutely clear that protecting Americans' constitutional rights and the integrity of our elections from the systematic assault that folks\\u2014in particular, Republican legislators\\u2014have been engaged in across the country is a must and that this historic threat requires strong voting rights legislation.
