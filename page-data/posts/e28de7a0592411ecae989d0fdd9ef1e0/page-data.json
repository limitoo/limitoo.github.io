I have never been able to complain to my Ministry of Health-appointed employer, my daughter Sian.\", \"\\\"I have always complained to the Ministry of Health or the local needs assessment assessors Disability Support Link. The Ministry of Health have always dictated my working conditions and I have never witnessed them communicating with Sian about my working conditions.\", \"\\\"The never-ending battles that us parents of adult disabled children who want to be supported to care for our children at home just wears you down. The bottomless money coffer that is there to fight us through the courts is something we cannot compete with.\\\"\", \"The Ministry of Health argued it was merely the funder through the Individualised Funding system, and that this distanced it from the delivery of service.\", \"However Inglis was not satisfied the evidence supported the \\\"hands-off\\\" characterisation.\", \"\\\"The Ministry of Health was not a distant participant in the delivery-of-care process or that it is aptly described as simply a funder. Rather, I infer from the evidence that the Ministry of Health sat firmly in the driver's seat.\\\"\", \"Individualised Funding is essentially a fortnightly allowance that covered a set number of support hours.\", \"\\\"Hosts were contracted by the Ministry of Health to support people in using Individualised Funding; the disabled person or their agent was responsible for all aspects of employment, including Accident Compensation levies, employment contracts, leave and tax requirements and Kiwisaver; budget management and the quality of the services provided.\", \"\\\"Payment was made by the Ministry of Health to the host who then on-paid to the family caregiver (employee) on the provision of time sheets.\\\"\", \"The example was given in court of how impractical it was for Sian Humphreys to be considered Peter Humphreys' employer.\", \"\\\"On 4 February 2021 a letter arrived at the Humphreys' home. It was addressed to Sian. The letter advised Sian that her tax returns were overdue and that prosecution action might follow.\", \"\\\"As Mr Humphreys pointed out, Sian is not able to open a letter. Nor is she able to understand what is written, much less take steps to comply with any tax obligations. I refer to this because it reflects on the practical reality of the situation, and Sian's capacity (if it were otherwise in doubt), to discharge the onerous obligations resting on all employers in New Zealand,\\\" Inglis' judgment said.\", \"Humphreys said while he was pleased with the decision, he was bracing for the ministry to appeal.\", \"The ministry has not yet responded to a request for comment.\"]","href_hash":"e28de7a0592411ecae989d0fdd9ef1e0"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"e28de7a0592411ecae989d0fdd9ef1e0"}},
