The South African government also said that it \\\"cannot in good conscience associate itself with such.\\\"\", \"Malaysia also will not participate in the pageant, citing COVID concerns.\", \"The calls to boycott the pageant are part of the larger push to boycott Israeli goods and events over the past few years. Palestinian-led grassroots campaigns, known collectively as BDS, promote boycotts, divestment and sanctions in what they refer to as a nonviolent campaign against policies and abuses.
