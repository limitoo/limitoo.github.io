This isn't a debate about masks,\\\" Stitt said.\", \"Back in May, Stitt signed legislation blocking school boards from implementing mask mandates, a law that went into effect at the beginning of July.\", \"On August 13, McDaniel penned a letter to the district community announcing masks would be required \\\"on school property, in school vehicles, and at school-sponsored events\\\" whether individuals were vaccinated against COVID-19 or not.
