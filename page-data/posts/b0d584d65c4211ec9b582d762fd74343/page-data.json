Stroud.\", \"Consider that Young, a precocious sophomore who played behind an often leaky offensive line and delivered a sterling performance in Alabama\\u2019s upset of Georgia last Saturday in the Southeastern Conference title game, may not even be the best player on his team. That honor has been bestowed by many upon Will Anderson, a menacing pass rusher who leads the nation with 32\\u00bd tackles behind the line of scrimmage. (Anderson finished fifth in the voting.)\", \"The same could be said of Stroud, a freshman quarterback who, after some early struggles, directed the top offense in the country, which is built around a trio of elite receivers who repeatedly make themselves open. Pickett, a senior, put up similar video-game numbers and could certainly make a claim for having influenced the game: The fake-slide-and-touchdown-run play he used in the Atlantic Coast Conference title game was outlawed within a week.\", \"Hutchinson, who has 14 sacks \\u2014 including three of Stroud in Michigan\\u2019s win over Ohio State \\u2014 is only the third defensive player to finish among the top four since another Wolverine, Charles Woodson, became the only defensive player to win the Heisman in 1997. Notre Dame\\u2019s Manti Te\\u2019o also finished second, in 2012.\", \"Still, for one of American sports\\u2019 most cherished awards, there has been little evolution in how selectors make their choice. Over the last decade or so, more sophisticated statistical analysis has dramatically changed how baseball awards are determined, with old standbys like batting average and pitcher wins diminished in favor of other metrics that may even take ballparks into account.\", \"And in basketball, points and rebounds have been put into greater context to detail the efficiency with which they were compiled.\", \"\\u201cThe guys who are inefficient and put up highlights, it was easier to make a case for them 10 years ago,\\u201d said Ryan Jones, a former editor of SLAM magazine, noting that high-volume shooters, like Allen Iverson and Kobe Bryant, would be appraised somewhat less favorably today.\", \"\\u201cYou don\\u2019t have to be a hard core analytics guy to appreciate Steph Curry, or what Jokic has done \\u2014 or Giannis,\\u201d he added, referring to the N.B.A.\\u2019s best shooter and its past two most valuable players, Nikola Jokic and Giannis Antetokounmpo, both of whom have well-rounded games. \\u201cSome of it is real obvious, but the advanced stats sometimes tell you in a different way how impressive some of that stuff is.\\u201d\", \"There has been an even greater reconsideration in baseball.\", \"In 1990, Bob Welch, who posted a 27-6 record for the Oakland Athletics, won the American League Cy Young Award, comfortably outdistancing Roger Clemens, who was 21-6 for the Boston Red Sox. But Clemens registered a league-best 10.4 in wins above replacement, or WAR, a more recent metric that evaluates a player\\u2019s value to the team based on more detailed data. Welch, who recorded far fewer strikeouts and allowed far more home runs, had a modest 2.9 WAR, the lowest among the top seven vote-getters that season.\", \"Nowadays, wins have been so devalued in favor of other measures that Jacob deGrom won back-to-back Cy Young Awards for the Mets while compiling a pedestrian 21-17 record over the 2018 and 2019 seasons.\", \"A more nuanced lens has also changed how baseball Hall of Fame voters have given new life to candidates like Tim Raines, Edgar Martinez and Larry Walker who were passed over because they fell short of milestones like 3,000 hits, 500 home runs or 300 victories.\", \"\\u201cThey\\u2019ve been on the ballot for a long time, but they got put over the top by voters looking at the new metrics and giving them more weight,\\u201d said Ryan Thibodaux, who tracks Hall of Fame voting as writers have made their ballots public. \\u201cThe younger voters rely on those metrics more than the old-school voters do.\\u201d\", \"Football has taken longer to catch up to other sports in using data to explain performance. Of course, numbers have been part of the fabric of baseball as long as the box score has existed, and tracking of point totals has always been elemental to basketball. Metrics that might better explain offensive line performance or the playmaking ability of a linebacker or the context of a quarterback\\u2019s performance in today\\u2019s game are far from a common currency.\", \"Anthony Treash, who analyzes college football players for Pro Football Focus, said the Heisman Trophy \\u2014 like other awards \\u2014 had essentially become a team award. His message to voters: Go beyond the box score and what you see on the internet.\", \"\\u201cI don\\u2019t want to question the voter\\u2019s credibility, but do we really have the best information to know who the best players are?\\u201d he said. \\u201cKeep your mind open to new ideas in player evaluation.\\u201d\", \"Until that happens, players like Iowa center Tyler Linderbaum, who was given the highest grade for a Power 5 conference center in eight years by Pro Football Focus, or Cincinnati cornerback Ahmad Gardner, who allowed 96 receiving yards in 12 games \\u2014 almost all of it in press coverage \\u2014 or Alabama\\u2019s Anderson will have to watch the Heisman ceremony from home.\", \"And the rare defensive player, like Michigan\\u2019s Hutchinson, who does earn an invitation to New York will have to be content with using his front-row seat to applaud the winner.\"]","href_hash":"b0d584d65c4211ec9b582d762fd74343"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"b0d584d65c4211ec9b582d762fd74343"}},
