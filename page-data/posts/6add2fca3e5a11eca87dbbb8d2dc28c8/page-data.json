I\\u2019m talking soups, casseroles, braises and everything roasted. The farro and cauliflower Parmesan below is a good place to start.\", \"And, crazy but true, it\\u2019s also nearly time to start thinking about Thanksgiving. I\\u2019m hosting this year, and my terrible, very slow menu-planning method, which I secretly enjoy, involves me going one dish at a time, mulling it over while loading the dishwasher or running errands, until finally I settle on a recipe (usually the first one I thought of, but it\\u2019s a process). I\\u2019ve started with the stuffing, and I\\u2019m leaning toward this outrageously good mushroom bread pudding, which I made last year. \", \"There are hundreds of Thanksgiving recipes for you on New York Times Cooking. We are here to help! And I\\u2019m dearemily@nytimes.com \\u2014 I love to hear from you. \", \"I really try to never give you recipes that take an hour. But this one, by Sarah DiGregorio, is mostly unattended, so you can wander away for 40 minutes and do other things. And, with daylight saving time ending on Sunday, I believe there will be a deep need for tomatoey, cheesy farro. \", \"View this recipe.\", \"This fast recipe is far from traditional birria, the regional Mexican stew that is often made with beef, goat or lamb. (For a phenomenal, longer-cooked version of the classic, see the chef Josef Centeno\\u2019s birria de res.) But Kay Chun has figured out how you can make something approximate and delicious at the end of the workday. Eat as a stew or in quesabirria tacos. \", \"View this recipe.\", \"This salmon comes with a pleasing crunch, thanks to a crust made with herbed yogurt and a combination of seeds (think sesame, cumin, coriander). Ali Slagle also uses that yogurt as a sauce for serving, making this recipe efficient in addition to being really good. \", \"View this recipe.\", \"This great Hetty McKinnon recipe is an ode to scallions. Two bunches are sliced and stir-fried quickly with ginger before being tossed with cooked green beans and noodles. You can use store-bought chile oil to save time, though Hetty also includes directions for making your own. \", \"View this recipe.\", \"Every time I\\u2019ve talked to my doctor since this recipe was published, she tells me how much she loves it. (Yes, I talk about recipes with my doctor.) Millie Peartree\\u2019s super-simple mushrooms and spinach are very lovable, and it couldn\\u2019t be easier to make. Serve it with chicken, tofu, fish \\u2014 anything, really. I\\u2019d choose salmon, which can roast on another rack at the same time. \", \"View this recipe.\", \"Thanks for reading.
