Marjorie Taylor Greene, former intelligence analyst Sebastian Gorka, and conservative activist Charlie Kirk.\", \"\\\"People that we have been led to believe we're on our side are not on our side. People say 'Well, Wood, you're creating a division.' I'm not creating a division, I'm exposing a division that was initially built in by the enemy to infiltrate the patriot movement. They wanted us looking forward to shooting at the enemy,\\\" the Trump supporter said.\", \"\\\"Half of our people were going to be behind us shooting us in the back. I've been exposing the enemy within. And you've got to do that before you go to battle,\\\" he added.\", \"He also said that his former client, Kenosha shooter Kyle Rittenhouse, accused him of believing in election fraud and being involved with QAnon. The teenager said in November that he fired the attorney for supporting those theories.\", \"\\\"Rittenhouse is all of a sudden, he comes out [and] he hits me with A, B, C, D, E, F, saying things like that I was insane, saying that I was a believer that there was election fraud and there was none.

Last week, Wood said that he is at \\\"war\\\" with lawyer Sidney Powell and retired Lt. General Michael Flynn.\", \"He said he believed that Flynn, Powell, and others involved with the pro-Trump \\\"Stop the Steal\\\" movement were not focusing on the 2020 presidential election results.\", \"\\\"After doing the research and connecting the dots, I have reached the conclusion that the Stop the Steal organization is a Deep State organization to raise money for purposes other than to FIX 2020,\\\" he wrote on Telegram.\", \"Wood also questioned Flynn's loyalty to Trump saying: \\\"What does Mike Flynn think of President Trump? Is he fighting for Trump or has he given up on Trump? Does Mike Flynn have aspirations to run for President himself in 2024? Does Mike Flynn really want to FIX 2020 or does he want us to remain captives to a rigged election system that might benefit him in the future?\\\"\"]","href_hash":"75d08f5b552811ec9a83b94bf4a5f19c"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"75d08f5b552811ec9a83b94bf4a5f19c"}},
