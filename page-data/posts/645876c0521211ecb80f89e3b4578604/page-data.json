At left was Alvin Ailey, who formed his namesake troupe in 1958 and built it into an institution of enormous cultural pride and unparalleled popularity. In the center was Judith Jamison, the company star who succeeded Ailey at the helm after his death in 1989 and led the organization into financial stability. And on the right was Battle, who was never a member of the company but had just taken over as its director.\", \"\\u201cWow, OK, a little pressure,\\u201d Battle said, understating how he felt back then.\", \"\\u201cI wanted the job but I had doubts,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cI had this fear that the audience wouldn\\u2019t show up, that people would say \\u2018The era is over.\\u2019 But people are still showing up.\\u201d\", \"This, too, was an understatement. Even during a pandemic that kept the Ailey company offstage for more than a year, it is financially stable and artistically thriving. On Wednesday, it returns to New York City Center for its annual December season. A week or two shorter than usual (through Dec. 19), the run will be \\u2014 apart from a few excerpts at the BAAND Together Dance Festival in August \\u2014 the company\\u2019s first series of live performances since March 2020.\", \"That\\u2019s plenty to celebrate, but on Dec. 11 the company will also commemorate Battle\\u2019s 10 years in charge with an evening devoted solely to his choreography. Such a focus on his dances is rare. When he took over as director, Battle was an independent choreographer with his own company, raising the possibility that his works would come to dominate the Ailey repertory. That didn\\u2019t happen.\", \"But Battle, 49, has transformed that repertory nevertheless. While maintaining Ailey classics and the near-ubiquity of Ailey\\u2019s signature masterpiece, \\u201cRevelations,\\u201d he has brought in works by unexpected choreographers like Paul Taylor, Ohad Naharin and Wayne McGregor. He has commissioned pieces by Kyle Abraham, the hip-hop master Rennie Harris and Ronald K. Brown, who many Ailey watchers had hoped would succeed Jamison. In 2019, he chose Jamar Roberts, a dancer in the company, as its first resident choreographer, discovering and nurturing one of today\\u2019s most acclaimed voices.\", \"With Battle\\u2019s encouragement, these and other artists have taken risks both stylistic and thematic \\u2014 addressing gun violence, the impact of the prison system on Black families, lynchings, massacres. There have been a few duds and misfires, but the standard critical complaint of the Jamison years \\u2014 that the new repertory didn\\u2019t do justice to the always exceptional Ailey dancers \\u2014 is now seldom heard.\", \"\\u201cBattle has been diligent in expanding the Ailey legacy according to its inciting logics,\\u201d said Thomas F. DeFrantz, the author of \\u201cDancing Revelations\\u201d and a professor of dance and African American studies at Duke University. \\u201cHe has balanced the three-part mission surprisingly well, presenting new work by young artists, presenting works by established artists from a broad range of choreographic traditions, and telling stories of Black life in dance.\\u201d\", \"And what does Jamison think, 10 years on? \\u201cI knew Robert would have a different palette,\\u201d she said, \\u201cbut he understands the tradition of the company, which has always been forward-thinking. He\\u2019s been delivering beautifully, which is what I expected.\\u201d\", \"The Ailey legacy has also been on Battle\\u2019s mind. In his office, next to a desk he inherited from Ailey, holding a talismanic prism that Ailey owned, the man in charge spoke of second-guessing his choices, wondering \\u201cWould Ailey have liked this?\\u201d He recalled how Jamison told him to trust his own voice, and how the approval of the audience helped his confidence. Only recently, though, has he been feeling fully comfortable in his position, ready to go another 10 years.\", \"What he is most proud of, he said, are the chances he\\u2019s taken, the swerves away from what he thought people presumed he might do. One of his first moves, for example, was importing Taylor\\u2019s \\u201cArden Court\\u201d \\u2014 a bucolic modern classic set to Baroque music, not the kind of trendy selection that might have been anticipated from a new, young director making his mark.\", \"\\u201cI see evolution and revolution differently,\\u201d he said, explaining how being raised by his great-aunt and great-uncle taught him to look at things \\u201cthrough an older type of wisdom that doesn\\u2019t necessarily go with the flow.\\u201d (That upbringing might also account for the down-home humor that has characterized his public speaking.)\", \"Another example of swerving: commissioning a celebration of Ailey\\u2019s life for the company\\u2019s 60th anniversary from Harris, a hip-hop choreographer, because \\u201cnobody would expect that.\\u201d\", \"What Battle appreciates in Harris, he said, is \\u201chow his mind works and how he sees things that I don\\u2019t see.\\u201d Battle recognized something similar in Roberts\\u2019s choreography: \\u201cHow is he seeing and hearing that? Where is this movement that I don\\u2019t recognize coming from?\\u201d\", \"\\u201cI wanted Jamar to have a place to continue his investigation,\\u201d Battle continued. \\u201cI\\u2019ve never asked him to do anything specific. I want to pay it forward because that opportunity was given to me.\\u201d\", \"Battle was referring to when he was a member of David Parsons\\u2019s company in the 1990s. \\u201cI liked making little things,\\u201d he said, and Parsons \\u201csaw that and put some of it onstage.\\u201d Those works were what attracted the attention of people at Ailey, leading to commissions for the company and eventually to the directorship.\", \"But when Battle took over at Ailey, he didn\\u2019t program much of his own choreography. \\u201cI wanted to be looked at as a curator,\\u201d he said. \\u201cAnd I knew that every step I took was going to be held up against the legacy. I couldn\\u2019t create in that.\\u201d\", \"In the years since, when friends and fans of his choreography have pressed him to do more of his own work, his response has been that artistic direction is his work. \\u201cThis is my choreography now,\\u201d he tells them.\", \"Apart from \\u201cAwakening,\\u201d a major premiere for the company in 2015, he has preferred to contribute occasional pieces from his back catalog. \\u201cI find a little thing that fits into the repertory, and that makes it more personal,\\u201d he said.\", \"His new \\u201cFor Four\\u201d \\u2014 one of two stage premieres in the City Center season; the other is Roberts\\u2019s \\u201cHolding Space\\u201d \\u2014 came about \\u201cbecause we needed something for this summer\\u2019s virtual gala,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt tricked me to having a bit of fun because I didn\\u2019t feel the pressure.\\u201d\", \"The tumult of the last two years, he said, has forced him to see some things differently. He long resisted digital content, but the closing of theaters and the example of his dancers \\u2014 who, at the start of the lockdown, filmed themselves doing \\u201cRevelations\\u201d wherever they were sheltering \\u2014 taught him \\u201cthat we could move into the digital space with a purpose other than just doing what the cool kids do.\\u201d\", \"At the end of March in 2020, the company started Ailey All-Access virtual programming. \\u201cAnd now millions of people have seen the company that might not have,\\u201d he said. \\u201cWe\\u2019ve had to let go of our old thinking.\\u201d\", \"And after the racial reckoning of 2020, he is also reconsidering how Ailey can be part of topical political conversations, \\u201cnot because somebody expects us to but because it\\u2019s our mission.\\u201d\", \"He noted his decision to use the American flag pointedly in his latest dance. \\u201cI was a Boy Scout,\\u201d he said, \\u201cbut now a house with the flag has become an oppressive symbol. I wanted to show how it\\u2019s been co-opted, as if it didn\\u2019t belong to me.\\u201d Both the allusion and the explanation are unusually explicit for a spokesman who is typically careful not to offend.\", \"\\u201cThis is a real generational chasm,\\u201d Battle said. \\u201cMy great-uncle was born in 1903. If he was talking about a white person, it was in a hush. He was the strongest man I knew, but you didn\\u2019t talk about these things. Now the younger generation of dancers are saying that we need to talk about it and show where we stand as an organization.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cBut I think a bridge is being constructed,\\u201d he said. \\u201cSo much of what we do at Ailey has always been about the notion that Black lives matter.\\u201d\", \"He cited the new documentary about Ailey by Jamila Wignot as a timely reminder. \\u201cYou can sort of invent what he might have thought,\\u201d Battle said, \\u201cbut to actually hear him say \\u2018Not all my works are political, but I\\u2019m a Black man living in this country. I can\\u2019t help but be affected.\\u2019 That\\u2019s totally current.\\u201d\", \"\\u201cThe knee-jerk thing is to overcorrect,\\u201d he continued. \\u201cBut sometimes you need to double down in your mission. Sometimes you have to think about what doesn\\u2019t change, what shouldn\\u2019t change.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"645876c0521211ecb80f89e3b4578604"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"645876c0521211ecb80f89e3b4578604"}},
