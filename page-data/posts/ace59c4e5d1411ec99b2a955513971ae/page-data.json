COVID-19 infections in England\\u00a0and almost makes up the majority of infections in London, according to the UK Health Secretary Sajid Javid.\\u00a0\", \"This week he told parliament there were currently more than 4,700 active Omicron cases, but the UK's health agency has estimated that the real number of infections is 20 times higher than confirmed cases.\", \"Doctors warn the strain is so
