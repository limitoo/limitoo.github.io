Part of his role included oversight over spending and reducing fraud.\", \"The government last week defended its record of providing support to businesses during the pandemic, disputing reports that it had written off 4.3 billion pounds ($5.8 billion) in fraud across more than 80 billion pounds of job support given by the Treasury, but acknowledging that some fraud had occurred.\", \"However, Agnew said oversight of some other schemes - administered by the British Business Bank and the business ministry - had been \\\"woeful\\\", and that the Treasury had shown little interest in the wider consequences of fraud.\", \"\\\"Given that I'm the minister for counter-fraud, it feels somewhat dishonest to stay on in that role if I'm incapable of doing it properly, let alone defending our track record,\\\" Agnew told the House of Lords, listing his efforts to raise a number of problems through official channels.\", \"Italy reported 77,696 COVID-19 related cases on Monday, against 138,860 the day before, the health ministry said, while the number of deaths rose to 352 from 227 .\", \"Italy has registered 143,875 deaths linked to COVID-19 since its outbreak emerged in February 2020, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the ninth highest in the world.

Those who decline to test are required to quarantine however.\", \"Travellers must still test themselves and register upon arrival in Norway and a negative test taken before arrival is also still necessary for those who cannot document that they are fully vaccinated or recovered, Norway said.\", \"Protesters attacked police with stones in the early hours of Monday as police moved in to clear out some blockades on Guadeloupe, the authority on the French Caribbean island said, amid ongoing protests against COVID-19 protocols.\", \"The Guadeloupe authority said police had been attacked at the Riviere-des-Peres part of the island as they tried to clear out roads that had been blockaded.\", \"An 8 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew has been in force since Jan. 10 in Guadeloupe, where the vaccination rate is much lower than in mainland France, as the island grapples with a new wave of the pandemic fuelled by the Omicron variant.\", \"Croatia's conservative Most party handed 82 boxes of papers in to parliament on Monday carrying the signatures of 410,533 people calling on the government to hold a referendum on whether to abolish COVID-19 certificates.\", \"The government must check the signatures, and if they are found to be valid, the date for a referendum can be set.\", \"Croatia has one of the European Union's lowest vaccination rates, with around 55 percent of its population inoculated against COVID-19, ahead of only Bulgaria, Romania and Latvia.\", \"The EU's newest member state reported 1,823 new coronavirus cases on Monday, a significant drop from the 16,017 reported last Tuesday.\", \"Russia on Monday reported a new record number of COVID-19 cases confirmed in the past 24 hours as the Omicron variant of the virus spread across the country, the government coronavirus task force said.\", \"Daily new cases jumped to 65,109, from 63,205 a day earlier. The task force also reported 655 deaths.\", \"A district in China's capital will begin a new round of COVID-19 tests among its roughly 2 million residents on Tuesday, as flare-ups persisted in the city ahead of the Winter Olympics, while four provinces found cases linked to Beijing clusters.\", \"The Beijing municipality reported six new domestically transmitted infections with confirmed symptoms for Sunday, data from the National Health Commission (NHC) showed. It marks the seventh consecutive days of new local confirmed cases for the city.\", \"Since Jan. 15, the city has reported a total of 36 local symptomatic cases, according to the NHC.\", \"Beijing has quickly stepped up measures to block further spreading of the virus, with the Winter Olympics due to start on Feb. 4.

A full state of emergency might involve closures of venues serving alcohol, attendance restrictions at sporting and cultural events and fines for non-compliant businesses.\", \"Japan recorded more than 54,000 new COVID cases on Saturday, the highest ever, driven by the infectious Omicron variant.\", \"A stretched medical system amid the fast-spreading variant has led the government to allow doctors to diagnose those who have been in close contact with infected persons and who show COVID symptoms as being infected without testing - if such a move is judged as necessary by local governments.\", \"\\\"To prepare against further rapid spread of infected persons, we presented (new) policy that will enable local authorities to swiftly conduct appropriate testing and treatment of patients by their own judgement,\\\" health minister Shigeyuki Goto told reporters after a meeting with Kishida.\", \"The country has recorded 2.1 million coronavirus cases and 18,498 deaths during the pandemic.\\u00a0\", \"India's COVID-19 infections, led by the Omicron variant, may see a sharp rise in the coming weeks, some top experts said, noting that the variant was already in community transmission and hospitals were seeing more patients despite a decline in cases in major cities.\", \"India reported 306,064 new infections over the last 24 hours, the health ministry said, about an 8 percent decline from the average daily cases reported in the last four days. Deaths were 439, the lowest in five days.\", \"But weekly positivity rates have risen to 17.03 percent in the week to Jan. 24, from about 0.63 percent Dec. 27, led by the highly-transmissible Omicron variant.\", \"\\\"Omicron is now in community transmission in India and has become dominant in multiple metros,\\\" a report by the Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) said on Jan. 10 in a report released on Sunday.\", \"Most cases of the Omicron variant have been mild, the advisory group said, although hospitalisations and cases in intensive care were increasing.\", \"India's tally of overall infections reached 39.54 million, the second-highest globally behind the United States. The country has seen 489,848 people die of the virus.\\u00a0\", \"Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday accused conservative politicians of stoking fear that COVID-19 vaccine mandates for cross-border truck drivers are exacerbating supply chain disruptions and fueling inflation.\", \"The United States imposed a mandate, meant to aid the fight against the fast spreading Omicron variant of the coronavirus, on Jan. 22, while Canada's started on Jan. 15. The trucking industry has warned the measure will take thousands of drivers off the roads during what is already a dire labor shortage in the industry.\", \"Alberta's conservative provincial leader, Jason Kenney, called for a pause of the mandate last week, and on Monday posted pictures on Twitter of empty shelves in supermarkets, calling for \\\"immediate action\\\" by both the U.S. and Canadian federal governments.\", \"\\\"This is turning into a crisis,\\\" Kenney wrote.\", \"\\\"I regret that the Conservative Party and conservative politicians are fear mongering to Canadians about the supply chain, but the reality is that vaccination is how we're going to get through this,\\\" Trudeau told reporters when asked about supply chain disruptions resulting from the policy.\", \"Israel's health minister said on Monday he did not think Israel will offer a fourth COVID-19 vaccine dose to most people after the government made it available to over 60s and other high-risk groups.\", \"Israel has been administering the fourth dose to most vulnerable groups - such as the elderly, those with weakened immune systems and health workers - as Omicron surged.
