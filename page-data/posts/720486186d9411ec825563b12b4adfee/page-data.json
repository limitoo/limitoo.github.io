That's their tactic, it works for them, [Neil] Wagner's very good at it, but we're different, we try to bowl at the stumps a lot more and it's really pleasing to see that it worked for us.\\\"\", \"Bangladesh's record in New Zealand is horrific - losing 32 international matches against the Blackcaps, with their only win coming in the 2015 Cricket World Cup against Scotland in Nelson.\", \"Gibson says the playing group was well aware of the poor results that preceded this visit, but he always felt they were capable of doing something special against the world champions.\", \"\\\"We knew what we were getting into when we came here, we knew it was going to be tough. We had a lot of time in Christchurch in [MIQ] and we spoke a lot about what we needed to do if we're going to be successful here, and it's really pleasing to see guys have gone out and done that.\\\"\", \"One of the young crop of players that arguably turned the game late on day four is fast bowler Ebadot Hossain. Producing a\\u00a0 stunning spell that saw the right-armer bowling in excess of 140km, Hossain removed Will Young, Henry Nicholls and Tom Blundell in six balls to reduce the Kiwis to 136/5.\", \"Entering the test with an unflattering average of 81 through 10 matches, Hossain has been the only bowler in the test to consistently trouble batsmen on a dying wicket.\", \"Gibson says Hossain's rewards are well deserved.\", \"\\\"He's a joy to work with because he's so enthusiastic and he wants to learn so much. He's very high and low on confidence, when he's confident he can bowl spells like this,\\\" Gibson says.\", \"But despite having played themselves into a position where they would have to perform poorly on the final day to not walk away with victory, Gibson is wary that New Zealand have fought their way out of dire spots before.\", \"The Blackcaps are unbeaten in 17 home tests and Gibson says his side needs to refocus on Wednesday and finish the job.\", \"\\\"Maybe the New Zealand batters underestimated us. The discipline we've shown is fantastic.\", \"\\\"I'm pleased for all my team for where we are in the game. We knew the history of how we've gone in New Zealand before we came here, we knew we had to do something special and so far, it's fair to say we've dominated the game.\", \"\\\"We're not going to get ahead of ourselves. Our medical team must get the boys fresh, and then come with the same attitude and the same discipline that we had over the last hours.\\\"\"]","href_hash":"720486186d9411ec825563b12b4adfee"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"720486186d9411ec825563b12b4adfee"}},
