The video gained over 3 million views and was met with comments from other young adults who have found themselves in similar situations with parents.\", \"QAnon is a conspiracy group that believes at its core that former President Donald Trump was secretly fighting a network of Satanic pedophiles, including senior Democrats, billionaires and celebrities\\u2014despite there being no evidence to back these claims.\", \"In the years since, the conspiracy has spiraled out to cover a whole range of ever-growing other theories, from ideas of a rigged election to celebrities harvesting chemical compounds from the blood of children to recently believing JFK Jr. will reappear alive to announce Trump as president again.\", \"QAnon has come into the mainstream online as followers become intensely convinced by the baseless theories. Family members have often spoken out about mentally losing relatives to QAnon, and having a sense of mourning over their old selves\\u2014common complaints include being shunned for not believing and constant messages of links to wild online theories.\", \"Mac shared his mom's texts to the tune of \\\"Slipping Through My Fingers\\\" by ABBA, a song usually used for sweet motherhood moments. Instead, Mac showed texts from his mom ordering him to: \\\"Take the mask off,\\\" and \\\"Do not drink tap water.\\\"\", \"Further messages went deeper into the conspiracy theory rabbit hole, as she ordered him to not take a COVID test, under the impression that the vaccine was secretly on the nasal swab.\", \"His mom also sent various fake news images, including one which alleged to show a petri dish of a swab from the inside of a mask, and another which claimed the existence of a company that put \\\"aborted fetus cells\\\" in their food and drinks.\", \"The video can also be seen here.\", \"Despite such beliefs being so extreme, they're far from rare in the U.S. in 2021, as shown by relating comments on the video from fellow children of QAnon believers.\", \"\\\"I don't think anyone really gets it either. I feel like I'm slowly watching my mom lose her sanity, and she's really religious with it too,\\\" commented one user.\", \"\\\"My mom is so deep into Q it's sickening. I can't even talk to her because she can't talk about anything that isn't Q related,\\\" added another.\", \"\\\"These comments make me feel less alone. Coming to terms with having a parent like this has been really difficult and isolating,\\\" wrote one user.\", \"One TikTok user commented: \\\"My husband's extended family is like this and they are very 'vaccines cause cancer' and use our son's death from cancer as a talking point.\\\"\", \"\\\"QAnon took my mother away from me,\\\" member Susan wrote in an email. \\\"The mom as I remember will probably never be seen again. She is forever lost in the realm of fantasy and drama.\\\"\", \"Travis said he moved out of his girlfriend's family home after her parents became QAnon believers, saying: \\\"These people are so harmless looking. [Her mother] works for the VA [Dept. of Veteran Affairs], doing research on the COVID vaccine. She believes the sex trafficking, blood-libel, satanic bulls**t hook, line, and sinker. [The father] works in IT for a large financial company. It is scary how these people are integrated into our society. I truly believe they would excuse mass violence to justify their beliefs...
