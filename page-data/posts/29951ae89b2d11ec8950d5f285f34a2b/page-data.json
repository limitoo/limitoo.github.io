All the shells from his weapon were found in the parking lot, among a row of cars.\", \"She said while other officers were in the line of fire of a single shot fired by Taylor's boyfriend, Hankison was \\\"over here, shooting wildly through sliding glass doors covered with vertical blinds and drapes.\\\"\", \"Hankison's attorneys never contested the ballistics evidence that showed he fired 10 times into the side of the apartment complex. The former narcotics detective, fired by Louisville Police for shooting blindly during the raid, admitted to firing through Taylor's patio door and bedroom window, but said he did so to save his fellow officers. Asked if he did anything wrong that night, he said \\\"absolutely not.\\\"\", \"Hankison testified he believed the gunshot he saw at the door was from a long rifle or AR-15, and his fellow officers were \\\"being executed\\\" at Taylor's front door.\", \"Defense attorney Stewart Mathews told the jury Thursday morning that Hankison thought he was doing the right thing in what he thought was a gun battle, and that he's not a criminal who belongs in prison.\", \"\\\"He did what he thought he had to do in that instant. This all happened in such a short span,\\\" Mathews said.\", \"A 20-year veteran K9 officer assigned to handle a drug-sniffing dog during the raid, Hankison said he was positioned behind the officer with a battering ram, and could see the shadowy silhouette of a person \\\"in a shooting stance\\\" with what looked like an AR-15 rifle as Taylor's door swung open.\", \"No long gun was found - only the handgun of Taylor's boyfriend Kenneth Walker, who told Louisville Police investigators he thought intruders were breaking in. Investigators determined Walker fired the shot that passed through the leg of Sergeant John Mattingly, who along with Officer Myles Cosgrove, returned fire. A total of 32 rounds were fired by police. Walker wasn't hit.\", \"\\\"I don't think I ever heard so many gunshots all the same time,\\\" Walker told \\\"CBS Mornings\\\" co-host Gayle King in October 2020. \\\"I've never been to war but I assume\\u00a0 that's what war probably sounds like.\\\"\", \"Whaley said other officers next to Cosgrove and Mattingly chose not to fire, and there was no evidence of any shots from a long rifle at the scene.\", \"\\\"Nobody got shot with an AR because there was never one,\\\" she said.\", \"The killing of Taylor loomed over the trial, though prosecutors insisted in opening statements that the case wasn't about her death or the police decisions that led to the March 13, 2020, raid. Jurors were shown a single image of her body, barely discernible at the end of the hallway.\", \"Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician who had been settling down for bed when officers broke through her door, was shot multiple times and died at the scene.\", \"Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron 's prosecutors asked a grand jury to indict Hankison on charges of endangering Taylor's neighbors, but declined to seek charges against any officers involved in Taylor's death. Protesters who had walked the streets for months were outraged.\", \"Taylor's name, along with George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery \\u2014 Black men who died in encounters with police and White pursuers \\u2014 became rallying cries during racial justice protests seen around the world in 2020.\", \"The jury of 10 men and five women was selected after several days of questioning from a pool expanded to about 250 people. Before deliberations, the jury was reduced to 8 men and 4 women after three alternates were dismissed. The judge declined to release details about their race or ethnicity.\"]","href_hash":"29951ae89b2d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"29951ae89b2d11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
