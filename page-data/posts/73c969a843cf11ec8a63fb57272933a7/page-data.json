But there remains work to be done with the administration.\", \"\\\"They say that they are concerned about racial justice. They say that they're concerned about privacy. They want to protect free speech,\\\" she said.\", \"\\\"They have a stated goal of challenging mass incarceration of addressing racialized policing.\", \"\\\"And so I think that our work is to...hold them to those promises and to push them to live up to those promises and their values and their oath to protect civil rights, civil liberties for everyone.\\\"\", \"Archer added: \\\"Certainly I think there's some challenges so far, so they're not going as far as we would like them to go as fast as we would like them to go and we'll push them.\", \"\\\"But I think we imagined that there would be a different scenario under the Biden Administration, but we're still fighting them and pushing them as you would do any administration, Republican or Democrat.\", \"\\\"And then we have the added layer of that we're fighting some of those fights that we fought under the previous administration now on a state by state level.\\\"\", \"In terms of specific areas, Archer said immigration was a key point of focus.\", \"\\\"The Trump administration was allowed to do what it did in part because our immigration system has been broken for a very long time,\\\" Archer said.\", \"\\\"But also around the family separation. There are thousands of families that are still separated from their children, children who are away from their parents.\", \"\\\"And we're working with the administration, trying to push the administration to reunite those families faster and allow them to stay in the United States and to give them the kind of resources they need to recover from the trauma that we have as a country have inflicted on them.\\\"\", \"Moreover, Archer said she is \\\"not seeing enough action around policing...we're not seeing the movement there\\\" on police accountability and transparency.\", \"She continued: \\\"There's far more that the Biden administration can do itself to protect our right to vote and that they have not yet done.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1931266/deborah-archer-websummit.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">The President of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Deborah Archer delivers remarks at the Altice Arena on the final day of 2021 Web Summit on November 04, 2021 in Lisbon, Portugal.
