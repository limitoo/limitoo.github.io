Elevens are often the biggest of the big kids, yet they\\u2019re still two long years away from being teenagers. The two-faced Roman god Janus, who rules over time and transitions, may as well be the patron deity of 11s, trapped as they are between childhood and adolescence, reluctant to let go of one and unsure how to embrace the other. It\\u2019s a moment where zippers stick, crushes are crushing and personal freedom is at a premium. But it can also be a period of prodigious growth. Two new middle grade novels, by the National Book Award finalists Leslie Connor (\\u201cThe Truth as Told by Mason Buttle\\u201d) and Sara Zarr (\\u201cStory of a Girl\\u201d), explore the costs and benefits of this in-between season.\", \"In Connor\\u2019s \\u201cAnybody Here Seen Frenchie?\\u201d the titular character is on the autism spectrum and loves all things avian. Frenchie Livernoise doesn\\u2019t speak, with the exception of an occasional bird call. Aurora Petrequin, his loquacious 11-year-old neighbor, has taken Frenchie under her wing since he and his family moved to her small town on the coast of Maine. Together they have formed an unusual bond: Frenchie serves as a willing audience to Aurora\\u2019s endless discourse, while Aurora is Frenchie\\u2019s trusted interpreter and protector. In the summer, they hike the beaches and woods of their little hamlet, constantly on the lookout for Frenchie\\u2019s beloved birds, and during the school year they are always in the same class, serving as each other\\u2019s \\u201cspecial person.\\u201d This arrangement has worked beautifully since third grade, shielding both of them from the unkindness of other children when it comes to their unique personality traits.\", \"But now it\\u2019s the start of sixth grade, and Aurora and Frenchie have been placed in separate classes. As Aurora begins to make new friends and explore experiences outside their circle of two, she starts to realize what she\\u2019s been missing by having Frenchie as her only companion.\", \"When torn between playing \\u201cPreposterous Pursuits\\u201d with her new friends Leena and Joanie at recess or running her usual 100-yard dashes with Frenchie, who \\u201ccounts on things to happen the same way every day,\\u201d Aurora describes her conflicted feelings as \\u201ca little burn\\u201d: \\u201cFrustration is what that is.\\u201d\", \"Though Frenchie\\u2019s new classroom aide, Mr. Menkis, advises a guilty Aurora that \\u201chaving new friends doesn\\u2019t mean you\\u2019re leaving someone else behind,\\u201d Aurora\\u2019s worst fears come true when Frenchie goes missing from school. She is certain it is her fault for not watching over him as carefully as she used to.\", \"But when the whole community rallies together to find him, Aurora begins to understand that she doesn\\u2019t have to shoulder the responsibility of Frenchie\\u2019s well-being all on her own. He\\u2019s under the loving concern of the entire town.\", \"Connor has created a soft-focus community that reads like a contemporary Grover\\u2019s Corners with its quirky assortment of kind adults and its cozy woodland setting populated with songbirds and even a fabled piebald deer. The tone is homey, the pacing leisurely and the introduction of neurodiversity thoughtful.\", \"The ebullient Aurora is a perfect foil for the reserved Frenchie. Both characters take big developmental steps toward the land of 12 by not only trusting each other, but also becoming a little less dependent on each other. Children seeking a gentle story of rare birds being seen, supported and understood will feel right at home within these pages.\", \"The young adult author Sara Zarr\\u2019s middle grade debut, \\u201cA Song Called Home,\\u201d skews more pensive, with a deeply affecting depiction of a working-class Christian family in flux.\", \"Lou lives with her mom and her older sister, Casey, in an apartment in San Francisco. Though Mom still struggles to pay the rent, things have been better since she divorced their alcoholic father: \\u201cNo more walking on eggshells. \\u2026 No more wondering how long he\\u2019d be able to keep his job this time, or if he\\u2019d remember things like your birthday or your baptism or if it was a Saturday or a Tuesday.\\u201d\", \"On the eve of her 11th birthday, change is once more in the air, as Lou\\u2019s mom is about to marry Steve, a man from their church: \\u201cLou\\u2019s birthday was on Friday. And then Saturday, the wedding.\\u201d\", \"While this will provide some much-needed financial stability, along with separate bedrooms for Lou and Casey, it will also mean changing schools and leaving friends behind.\", \"Steve\\u2019s offer to adopt Lou and Casey does not sit well with Lou. Steve is perfectly nice, but she already has a dad. \\u201cShe didn\\u2019t need a new one. She just wanted the one she had to be different.\\u201d\", \"Lou wants everything to go back to the \\u201cwe\\u201d it used to be: \\u201cBefore Steve, we was Lou and Casey and Mom. \\u2026 Now it seemed like we was Steve and Mom, while Lou and Casey had suddenly become a separate us,\\u201d with no room for Dad at all.\", \"So when Lou is gifted a mysterious guitar for her birthday, she decides to assume it\\u2019s from Dad, though there is no name on the card. She starts taking lessons from Steve\\u2019s kind neighbor, and focuses on learning Dad\\u2019s favorite songs from his old Neil Young and R.E.M. albums. The guitar lessons, along with a new haircut, new friends and a new spelling of her name (\\u201cLu\\u201d), help ease the transition to her new school, and slowly her new life becomes just \\u2026 her life.\", \"While Dad doesn\\u2019t suddenly stop drinking, he does show up to see Lou play the guitar in the middle school talent show. And when he admits he was not the one who gave her the guitar, Lou\\u2019s disappointment is tempered by the fact that she has finally become a \\u201cwe\\u201d with the person who did: Steve.\", \"Zarr\\u2019s portrayal of Lou is achingly authentic, because she lived it. She has been candid about her evangelical Christian childhood in San Francisco, where she grew up without a father after age 10. But what Zarr captures especially well are those small moments of clinging to the past while being pushed into the future that are so quintessentially characteristic of 11-year-olds.\", \"When Mom tells Lou that the yellow kitchen table from the old apartment went to Goodwill, \\u201cLou froze, then rolled away. It felt as though something had been torn right from her hands.\\u201d\", \"On the last day in her old school, Lou is stunned to realize that \\u201cthey were all going to go on without her\\u201d: \\u201cThis classroom would still exist and everyone else would still be in it. \\u2026 All the usual games and conversations at recess and lunch would happen. It didn\\u2019t seem real or possible, but that\\u2019s how it would be.\\u201d Life will continue, and so, despite all evidence to the contrary, will Lou.\", \"When Lou\\u2019s mom says, \\u201cChange is hard. Even good change,\\u201d it speaks to the ambivalence 11s feel as they run down the up escalator of life, trying desperately to stay in place. Sometimes adults who have weathered a thousand transformations forget how tumultuous a move, a new school or a fluctuating friendship can be when a decade constitutes your whole life. So thank Janus for author-seers who share their wise insights about this turbulent time to remind both kids and grown-ups that, no matter how awkward or painful, this too shall pass.\"]","href_hash":"f963a1248afa11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"f963a1248afa11ec8950d5f285f34a2b"}},
