The ruling will likely be appealed to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which leans Democratic.\\u00a0\", \"Fourteen Republicans in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives sued last year, arguing that the law was unconstitutional. Eleven of those GOP lawmakers voted for Act 77 in 2019.\", \"In its decision, the court noted that the law has expanded access to the ballot, but the majority said that any changes to mail voting laws would require a constitutional amendment.\", \"\\\"No-excuse mail-in voting makes the exercise of the franchise more convenient and has been used four times in the history of Pennsylvania,\\\" wrote Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt, a Republican. \\\"Approximately 1.38 million voters have expressed their interest in voting by mail permanently. If presented to the people, a constitutional amendment\\u2026is likely to be adopted.
