I wasn\\u2019t quick enough to do the math, but because she, a few friends who came to lend a hand and the three people who work with her had harvested 15,000 pounds of peppers in their first pass across the fields, I figured they had a lot to do before the second harvest, and the third. All those peppers have to be picked, set in the greenhouses for a time, stemmed and seeded, dehydrated, ground, scooped and sealed into jars. \\u201cWe grow esoteric chiles,\\u201d Krissy said with a full and easy laugh, \\u201cbut we\\u2019re a down-to-earth farm.\\u201d \", \"Not all of the dozen or so chile varieties grown on the farm are \\u201cesoteric,\\u201d but the Piment d\\u2019Ville, its original crop, is unusual in the United States. It\\u2019s a California-grown chile that was planted using Espelette pepper seeds from France\\u2019s Basque Country. (Piment d\\u2019Espelette is a protected name and can only be used for peppers grown in a specified region, which is why the Boonville Barn version goes by Piment d\\u2019Ville.)\", \"The taste of the chiles isn\\u2019t easy to describe. They have some heat, but not all that much. They score 4 out of 10 on the Scoville scale, which means they\\u2019re a little milder than jalape\\u00f1os \\u2014 although nature can be capricious, and every once in a while you get a hot one. They\\u2019ve got a touch of sweetness, as you find in Aleppo or Urfa peppers. And sometimes there\\u2019s a little smokiness. I think of their flavor as warm and toasty rather than sharp.\", \"In Basque cooking, you find piment d\\u2019Espelette in everything from omelets to chocolate. It\\u2019s made into jelly, hot sauce and even syrup, which is good in cocktails. And while it\\u2019s not as widely used in America, it was beloved at the Boonville Hotel when Krissy worked as a sous-chef there.\", \"\\u201cWhen I started at the hotel in 2011, we used piment d\\u2019Espelette in lots of our signature dishes,\\u201d she told me. Roast chicken was rubbed with salt, black pepper, garlic, thyme and piment d\\u2019Espelette; steaks were served with a chile cream; prosciutto and melon were finished with lime, mint and chile powder; and croutons were made with salt, rosemary and chile.\", \"According to Krissy, they started growing their own peppers at the hotel when they realized how many of the imported chiles they were using and how counter it was to their ethos of sourcing as much local food as possible. The climate there, about 100 miles north of San Francisco, is similar to that of the pepper-growing area of the French Basque Country, and so the plants thrived. A separate farm, which would evolve into the Boonville Barn Collective, came a few years later. \", \"I asked Krissy if she had any advice for me about how to use the pepper. \\u201cWhatever you do,\\u201d she said, \\u201cdon\\u2019t treat the spices as precious. Use them!\\u201d To get to know the chile, she suggested I use it in place of black pepper for a week \\u2014 a good idea that I didn\\u2019t adopt. She also said: \\u201cGo for it! Use a tablespoon on your next chicken.\\u201d And I did. \", \"I also sprinkled the powder over roasted vegetables, into hummus and guacamole, on steamed corn and grilled fish, and into the dough for World Peace Cookies, the cocoa-and-chopped-chocolate cookies I learned from the pastry chef Pierre Herm\\u00e9, which are usually flavored only with sea salt. But the most exciting dish I made with it was a sweet-potato-and-apple galette with a velvety piment-spiked spread, kind of like an offbeat pimento cheese.\", \"The recipe for the crust is a favorite of mine: It\\u2019s unfussy and easy to work with; it\\u2019s got good flavor; it\\u2019s sturdy once it\\u2019s baked; and it keeps much of its texture even with a creamy topping. That you roll the dough out as soon as it\\u2019s made and then cut it to size and use it flat, like a pizza \\u2014 no fluting or crimping \\u2014 means it lives in the realm of attainability, even for new pie makers. The top layer of the galette is made up of slightly overlapping rounds of sweet potato and apple, a combination that plays to autumn and holds its appeal through the winter. While I scrub the potato and apple, I don\\u2019t peel them \\u2014 I like how the rust and red colors curl and burnish under heat. \", \"The galette looks beautiful, but the most intriguing part is the hidden filling, a mix of cream cheese and milk fortified with a little Parmesan. I know that the Parm is an odd addition, but it accentuates how savory the galette is. And then there\\u2019s the chile powder, the ingredient that turns all expectations for the dish topsy-turvy. When I\\u2019m using chiles, I often include honey too, but the sweet potato and apple pushed me to maple syrup \\u2014 the right choice. The syrup also made a nice glaze for the finished galette.\", \"As I measured out the chile powder for the filling, I could almost hear Krissy urging me on, saying: \\u201cGo for it! Go for it! Add a tablespoonful.\\u201d I thought about it. I dipped the spoon into the jar again, but I stopped short. Maybe next time. \", \"Recipe: Sweet Potato Galette\", \"\", \"\"]","href_hash":"7639f24c3c8711ecbccc000017025a03"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"7639f24c3c8711ecbccc000017025a03"}},
