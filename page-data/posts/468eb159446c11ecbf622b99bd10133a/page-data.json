In 2010, they cocreated costumes for Darren Aronofsky\\u2019s ballet gothic \\u201cBlack Swan.\\u201d But it was their first time designing for an animated cast of zoo animals, which included a pig (voiced by Reese Witherspoon), porcupine (Scarlett Johansson) and lion (Bono) putting on a space opera in a Las Vegas-type town.\", \"There were more questions, of course \\u2014 questions that came up for the entirety of production, Kate Mulleavy said: \\u201cHow do we get the movement right? How do we get the texture right? How do we get this as detailed as possible?\\u201d\", \"Here, in an interview condensed and edited for clarity, the sisters discuss the complexities of fashion animation, including their inspiration for the film\\u2019s standout costume (worn by Meena, that lovestruck teenage elephant): a crystal-encrusted hooded cape in several shades of blue that cloaks a long white gown with a giant train \\u2014 all ruffles and chiffon and unabashed innocence.\", \"How do you even start designing something like that gown for animation?\", \"Kate Mulleavy: There\\u2019s so much heart and soul in her character, and we wanted to reveal that in her costume change. When she takes off the cape and reveals this beautiful dress, the train kind of floats, and it\\u2019s actually so spectacular to watch. Trying to get that thing that chiffon does when you have a magic gust of wind \\u2026 animating that was just a very long process.\", \"Laura Mulleavy: Her cape, if I\\u2019m correct, took a year. There were things on it that we really wanted to achieve, like hand-smocking detail. It\\u2019s so easy in animation to make something perfect. And what we wanted to bring is the fact that what we do is either handmade or a hand-done technique \\u2014 something that makes it look special and interesting, not like a cookie-cutter item.\", \"Even down to the shape of this smocking and the crystal application and then the d\\u00e9grad\\u00e9 within the cape. It took such a long time because it wasn\\u2019t just like, \\u201cOh, let\\u2019s make dark blue and teal come together.\\u201d We had to recreate an effect that you would get from hand-dyeing.\", \"Those details, going back and forth and making sure that the blue was swishing across her in the right part \\u2014 that took a lot of work.\", \"You released a few Rodarte collections in this time period, between 2018 and 2021. Did any aspects of your work on \\u201cSing 2\\u201d seep into those collections, or vice versa?\", \"Kate: Sometimes this question comes up when you costume-design \\u2014 if you\\u2019re coming, in our case, from your own fashion company. How much should Rodarte show up in the costumes? We definitely have a viewpoint, creatively, and those things can become intertwined in a sense.\", \"Rather than having the movie influence what we were doing, it made us rethink things that we\\u2019ve done. Sometimes you compartmentalize. You do something and you never think about it again. With fashion, you\\u2019re always trying to move forward or take new steps in a different direction, even if it\\u2019s within your language; the handwork that we\\u2019ve done over the years \\u2014 aging, beading, hand-dyeing and a lot of techniques that we said at the time we\\u2019re never going to do that again.\", \"This was, in a sense, a pretty straightforward costume design project. But in fashion there has been a lot of attention lately on the \\u201cmetaverse,\\u201d and brands translating their looks for avatars in video games or animated characters. For you, did working on \\u201cSing 2\\u201d feel connected to that phenomenon at all?\", \"Laura: I don\\u2019t connect them. It\\u2019s definitely in the zeitgeist, but this is a feature film that took three years to do. It doesn\\u2019t seem like a gimmick, and that\\u2019s not what it is. Fashion going into those spaces is a way to make money, and I don\\u2019t think that\\u2019s bad. I think that\\u2019s great, it\\u2019s what we do. It\\u2019s exciting, and it\\u2019s a way to create brand awareness.\", \"Kate: But our main idea was to take some of the handmade things we\\u2019ve done and see them in a new space. So in a sense, there is something meta about it because there is a reference to things that we\\u2019ve done. I feel like if you loved Rodarte, you could watch the stage show at the end of the movie and see that.\", \"Laura: I think it all goes back to virtual reality. \\u201cSing,\\u201d yes, puts me in a space closer to understanding, like, what is the virtual reality version of what we do? That is definitely the future.\", \"Kate: I walked away and I thought, \\u201cAll this time I\\u2019ve made all these clothes that exist as objects.\\u201d We have a whole archive of what we\\u2019ve done. And here\\u2019s something I\\u2019ve made where there isn\\u2019t any physical object, and I feel like it\\u2019s as real as anything I\\u2019ve ever made and could be something that someone looks at 100 years from now. It\\u2019s creatively exciting to know that you can go beyond what is material.\", \"\\u201cSing 2\\u201d will be released Dec. 22.\"]","href_hash":"468eb159446c11ecbf622b99bd10133a"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"468eb159446c11ecbf622b99bd10133a"}},
