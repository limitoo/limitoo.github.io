But the voices of the responsible are being drowned out by the irresponsible.\", \"\\\"A case in point: Patriot Purge, a three-part series hosted by Tucker Carlson. The special, which ran on Fox's subscription streaming service earlier this month and was promoted on Fox News, is presented in the style of an expose, a hard-hitting piece of investigative journalism.\", \"\\\"In reality, it is a collection of incoherent conspiracy-mongering, riddled with factual inaccuracies, half-truths, deceptive imagery and damning omissions.\\\"\", \"Goldberg and Hayes then drew a distinction between what they saw as two sides of Fox News, one opinion and the other news, an aspect which they praised for doing \\\"what it is supposed to do.\\\"\", \"They added: \\\"Over the past five years, some of Fox's top opinion hosts amplified the false claims and bizarre narratives of Donald Trump or offered up their own in his service.\", \"\\\"In this sense, the release of Patriot Purge wasn't an isolated incident, it was merely the most egregious example of a longstanding trend.\\\"\", \"Carlson has defended Patriot Purge following an avalanche of criticism over the trailer for the three-part series.\", \"<div class=\\\"head3\\\">'True Story' Behind Capitol Riot</div>\", \"A promo for the program said it would provide the \\\"true story\\\" behind the riot carried out by supporters of former President Donald Trump.\", \"Carlson had claimed that the FBI had a role in organizing the attack on the Capitol on January 6.\", \"But critics said the show would only serve to promote \\\"wild conspiracy theories\\\" about the riot at the Capitol.\", \"Representative Liz Cheney (R-WY), the Republican vice-chair of the House select committee investigating January 6, previously tweeted that Fox News had given Carlson \\\"a platform to spread the same type of lies that provoked violence on January 6.\\\"\", \"Carlson said in response: \\\"This is not CNN. We work for Fox News. Our bosses don't pull people off the air just because some screechy little politician doesn't like what we say.\", \"\\\"Keep in mind that Liz Cheney has not even seen the film that she is so angry about\\u2014just the trailer.\\\"\", \"<img src=\\\"https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/1865410/fox-news-tucker-carlson-speaks-2019.webp\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div class=\\\"imgText\\\">Fox News host Tucker Carlson discusses 'Populism and the Right' during the National Review Institute's Ideas Summit at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel March 29, 2019, in Washington, DC.
