This most recent venture began with a mission to find a fabric that would give garments not only a comfortable fit but also an opaque finish, a process that eventually led to a signature knit that she now uses for all of the line\\u2019s pieces, from seamless ribbed sports bras to elegant long-sleeve leotards. The textile, created from a blend of strong but elastic fibers, is both quick-drying and chlorine-resistant, making it uniquely versatile. \\u201cEverything is designed to be used as swimwear, sportswear, underwear or shapewear,\\u201d Laub says. \\u201cThe fabric allows for powerful fits that provide support without a traditional under-wiring structure.\\u201d Sustainability is also at the forefront of her vision: Each collection is made in Italy using 3-D knitting techniques that create less waste. Furthermore, clothes that serve multiple purposes, says Laub, encourage shoppers to \\u201cbuy better and buy less.\\u201d\", \"When the designer Kerhao Yin joined the London-based brand Vaara as its creative director in 2020, he sought to create multifunctional pieces that skew \\u201cmore elegant than technical,\\u201d he says. Today, the line \\u2014 founded in 2015 by the entrepreneur Tatiana Korsakova and originally made up of color-blocked leggings \\u2014 shies away from the logos and flashy athletic motifs adopted by many leisure-wear brands and instead focuses on wearers\\u2019 lifestyles. \\u201cA woman can go from home to work to the gym and then on to a night out,\\u201d Yin says. \\u201cI want our pieces to seamlessly thread through all these events.\\u201d To this end, he and Korsakova prioritize performance fabrics, including jerseys and knits, that can move and adapt well in a range of settings. And the brand now releases full collections that comprise fashion-forward pieces such as oversized wool anoraks, nylon bubble skirts and gathered cotton dresses (with collapsible turtleneck collars for added versatility) that organically sync with its core workout-wear staples like rib-knit tanks and scoop-neck bodysuits made from recycled yarn. \\u201cWe never design anything just for the sake of it,\\u201d says Yin.\", \"Struck by the lack of functional, colorful women\\u2019s tennis apparel, Marguerite Wade, a creative director and an avid player of the sport, decided to take matters into her own hands and founded Full Court Sport in 2014. Produced in Portland, Ore., the line offers a variety of pieces designed with mobility and ease in mind \\u2014 think perforated stretch-knit dresses with neon trim, jersey sports bras with crossover straps and form-fitting shorts and leggings, in shades of cornflower blue or dusty pink, with carefully placed pockets for balls. \\u201cTennis has become a huge market in the last few years, but it wasn\\u2019t always so,\\u201d says Wade. \\u201cIt seems funny to think that when I started the line, it was considered a very niche area that required a lot of explanation.\\u201d In 2020, the brand outfitted the tennis player Kim Clijsters for the U.S. Open and has continued to grow since; it debuted a capsule collection with Net-a-Porter last year and in spring it will release another with Nordstrom. Much like perfecting a serve or a backhand, the company, says Wade, \\u201cis an ever-evolving project.\\u201d\", \"Over the past two years, the Amsterdam-based label Gauge81 has established itself as a popular source of minimal \\u201990s-inspired evening wear. Now, founder Monika Silva has broadened her offering to cater to her customers\\u2019 daytime pursuits. Launched in November, her debut collection of activewear includes form-hugging cross-back bodysuits, supportive high-waisted leggings and cropped hooded sweatshirts \\u2014 all available in black, white or vibrant cerulean and designed for exercise of varying levels of intensity. \\u201cThe collection works for any high-performance sport, as well as more studio-based practices like yoga and Pilates,\\u201d says Silva, who has worked in knitwear for over a decade and ensured that each garment is both breathable and moisture wicking. \\u201cThe pieces are knitted, rather than assembled using the more common cut-and-sew process, to offer high compression and movability,\\u201d she says. \\u201cIt\\u2019s as if the clothes are a second skin.\\u201d\", \"When the Manila-based brothers Patrick and Bryan Toh \\u2014 who have backgrounds in architecture and finance, respectively \\u2014 first began to discuss creating a line of technical leisure wear, they intuitively looked to Filipino culture for inspiration. Drawing on concepts of tranquillity and spirituality while also channeling the bustling energy of their home city, they founded Future Relics in 2019 with the goal of providing workout wear that balances ease and adaptability with innovation. \\u201cWe develop and choose fabrics that will perform well during high-intensity activities,\\u201d says Patrick. \\u201cBut we also want the garments to be comfortable for lounging.\\u201d Standout pieces include open-back sports bras, racer-back crop tops and perfectly cut leggings, all offered in soft, earthy tones, such as slate gray and burnt sienna, that feel like a reprieve from the loud colors and patterns so often used by athleisure lines. \\u201cWe also take into account sustainability,\\u201d says Patrick, \\u201cwhether that\\u2019s by choosing recycled materials, working with vendors who have sustainability built into their supply chains or repurposing existing fabrics.\\u201d\"]","href_hash":"632713a4882911eca88157d574c1e024"}}]}},"pageContext":{"slug":"632713a4882911eca88157d574c1e024"}},
