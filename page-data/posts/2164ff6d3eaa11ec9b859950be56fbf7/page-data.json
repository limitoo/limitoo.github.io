cent in high-risk adults, as the drugmaker joined the race for an easy-to-use medication to treat the coronavirus.\", \"Currently most COVID treatments require an IV or injection.\", \"Competitor Merck's COVID pill is already under review at the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) after showing strong initial results, and on Thursday the United Kingdom became the first country to OK it.\", \"Australia's\\u00a0Therapeutic Goods Administration has not yet approved the Merck drug but\\u00a0the federal government announced last month it had ordered 300,000 courses.\", \"Pfizer said it would ask the FDA and international regulators to authorise its pill as soon as possible, after independent experts recommended halting the company's study based on the strength of its results.\", \"Once Pfizer applies, the FDA could make a decision within weeks or months.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/c65888ab2dc168f9f8d171bfbd1c85dc\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\",

pandemic last year, researchers worldwide have been racing to find a pill to treat COVID that can be taken at home to ease symptoms, speed recovery and keep people out of the hospital.\", \"Having pills to treat early COVID \\\"would be a very important advance,\\\" said John Mellors, chief of infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh, who was not involved in the Pfizer study.\", \"\\\"If someone developed symptoms and tested positive we could call in a prescription to the local pharmacy as we do for many, many infectious diseases,\\\" he said.\", \"<div

drug along with another antiviral shortly after showing COVID symptoms had an 89 per cent reduction in their combined rate of hospitalisation or death after a month, compared to patients taking a dummy pill.\", \"Fewer than 1 per cent of patients taking the drug needed to be hospitalised and none died.\", \"In the comparison group, 7 per cent were hospitalised and there were seven deaths.\", \"\\\"We were hoping that we had something extraordinary, but it's rare that you see\\u00a0great drugs come through with almost 90 per cent efficacy and 100 per cent protection for death,\\\" said\\u00a0Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer's chief scientific officer.\", \"Study participants were unvaccinated, with mild-to-moderate COVID, and were considered high risk for hospitalisation due to health problems like obesity, diabetes or heart disease.\", \"<img src=\\\"https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/ec55f8bd7f0e6e84e6212fa97bae301b\\\" class=\\\"abcImg\\\"></img>\", \"<div

symptoms, and lasted for five days.\", \"Patients who received the drug earlier showed slightly better results, underscoring the need for speedy testing and treatment.\", \"Pfizer reported few details on side effects but said rates of problems were similar between the groups at about 20 per cent.\", \"An independent group of medical experts monitoring the trial recommended stopping it early,

has set a public meeting later this month to review Merck's pill, known as molnupiravir.\", \"The company reported in September that its drug cut rates of hospitalisation and death by 50 per cent.\",
