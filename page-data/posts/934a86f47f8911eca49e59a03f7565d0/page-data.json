And in life, sometimes you got to listen to your heart because that's the only way I could go to sleep at night,\\\" Brown said. \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"Throughout his career, he has played for four teams which includes a nine-season run with the Pittsburgh Steelers that ended abruptly in late 2018 \\u00a0\", \"He had a brief stint with the\\u00a0Oakland Raiders\\u00a0but was released after their relationship turned sour. \\u00a0\", \"Shortly after, he signed with the New England Patriots.

He told Burleson that days before the on-field incident, he let Bucs coach Bruce Arians and the training staff know that he was \\\"hobbling\\\" after an ankle injury.\\u00a0\", \"On game day he said he realized the pain was too much and he could not play anymore. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"It's, like, the third quarter, on the bench, like, 'Yo, I can't go.' I see the coach. Like, he looks back,\\\" Brown said. \\u00a0\", \"Brown said that Arians asked him to go back to the field. \\u00a0\", \"\\\"'Could you go?' I'm, like, 'Nah, I can't go.' So he [was] like, 'Yo, get the f*** outta here, You [are] done,'\\\" Brown said. \\u00a0\", \"Arians dispelled Brown's account and said at a press conference afterward that \\\"you can't force a player to play\\\" and that he was unaware that Brown was hurt.

Like, last year I knew coming into the league I was going to have to be on a prove-it deal, earn-it type deal. And, like, if I could play, wouldn't you think I'd be in the game trying to make the money?\\\" Brown said. \\\"My incentives are performance-based. So I have to go out and perform to earn it. So, I mean, I got close but it's like what, I'm going to risk my ankle.\\\" \\u00a0\", \"In that moment, Brown said he didn't want to wear the Buccaneers uniform anymore. \\u00a0\\u00a0\", \"\\\"For the coach...you know, I go to war with.
